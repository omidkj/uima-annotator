Right ischemic leg/foot

History of Present Illness:
71 year-old man well-known to vascular service presents with
sudden onset of Right leg pain that began at 2 PM this
afternoon. Patient was discharged home early [**Month (only) 216**] after having
a 2nd toe amputation for osteomyelitis (done by Podiatry).
During this hospitalization, the patient was evaluated by
vascular surgery to see if his left leg had good enough blood
flow to heal a toe amp of his left foot.  At that time, his
right leg had palpable femoral and DP pulses.
His left leg had a palpable femoral pulse and dopplerable pulses
of all arteries below the popliteal.  He underwent his toe
amputation without any complications.  His hospital stay was
significant for evaluation by hematology, in which they
diagnosed him with likely HIT type 2.  They saw a drop in his
platelet count that coincided with the start of his dialysis
(early [**2167-7-7**]), which they attributed to him receiving heparin flushes
during dialysis sessions.  He was discharged home, and now
returns with severe right leg pain that begins at his hip and
shoots down to his knee, and that began at 2 PM today.  He has
never had pain like this since his Bypass graft was performed
back in [**2161**].  Pain has been constant in both the reclining and
standing positions.  His family brought him here to the ED for
further evaluation.

use; he has a remote history of tobacco use but quit in his 20s.

There is no history of alcohol abuse or illicit drug use.
Patient is widowed and lives in senior citizen home in [**Hospital1 **]
with VNA services 3 times a week.  He is independent in his ADLs
but has help with meals. He is a retired foreman for [**Company 2676**].
At
baseline, he gets short of breath walking less than one block
and
uses a walker.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 79-year-old male who was recently discharged from the
hospital 1 day ago, after debriding a left toe and doing a
primary amputation, and the patient
returns with the acute onset of right leg pain at 2:00 p.m.
today.  The patient was with his family and they called an
ambulance and he was immediately transported to the [**Hospital1 771**] emergency room.  Exam at that time
revealed no femoral pulse and no signals in his right foot along
with normal sensation and normal motor, but a cool foot with
poor capillary refill.  Due to a question of
heparin-induced thrombocytopenia the patient was bolused with
Argatrobran and started on an infusion and plans were made for
the operating room.  Immediately before going to the operating
room, he regained a femoral pulse, and he was then
brought into the operating room on [**2167-8-8**].

An emergent Angiogram/Angioplasty of his Right SFA and Right AK
popliteal artery and an emergent thrombectomy of his SFA-[**Doctor Last Name **] and
tibial vessels/grafts was done in the OR.
Subsequent trips back to the OR for adjustment of his
thromolysis catheter and repeat thromolysis were done in the
next few days. The patient tolerated each procedure well.

His post-operative course was uncomplicated until the morning of
[**8-15**] (PPD 7 from his initial thromolysis).  He developed vague
chest pain, difficulties breathing, and triggered secondary to
his hypotension with his SBP being in the 80's.  He did not
recieve his Metoprolol dose that morning.  On [**8-14**] he was only
dialysed -400 cc secondary to low BP in the dialysis unit.  The
vascular team evaluated him quickly; he indeed was hypotensive
to the 80's with an irregular irregular HR (chronic A-fib) in
the 60's.  He was mentating well but was c/o CP which was
reproducible with palpation.  He did not have any murmurs but
did have an irregular irregular rhythm on cardiac exam. His
lungs did have bibasilar crackles, L>R.  A CXR did suggest
possible effusions, L>R versus intersitial edema.  Cardiology
evaluated him and did not think this was a cardiac etiology.
Cardiac enzymes were negative X 3. EKG was unchanged.  Renal was
called but they did not want to perform an urgent dialysis as
they did not think he was volume overloaded. Instead the patient
was transfused one unit of PRBCs (chronic low hct of 27-28).
During this entire duration, his oxygen saturation was high 90's
on 2L. Discontining the oxygen did not drop his sats (96% on
RA).  We sat him up to his chair, which made him feel
immediately better.  Afterwards, the patient was more calm and
his BP was in the 100's.  He did well the rest of the hospital
course.

Because his last hospitalization questioned the possibility of
heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), per Heme-Onc, a HIT
panel was ordered.  It was negative X 2.  Further tests such as
B2 Glycoprotein, Anti-cardiolipin, and Serotonin Releasing Assay
were negative.  He was taken off his Agatroban and continued on
coumadin, although the agatroban was stopped one day before all
the tests were negative anyway given that he reached a goal INR
([**4-11**]). Given the results of these tests, heme-onc is deciding
that he is HIT negative.

Physical therapy was consulted and requested he be discharged to
rehabilitation. Case management was advised and screened him.
His PMD (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 18323**]) was [**Name (NI) 653**], and stated that after
he is discharged from his rehabilitation facility, he would be
willing to monitor the patient's INR.
