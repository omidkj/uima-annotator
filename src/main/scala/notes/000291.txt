Service:  Medicine

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 75-year-old male with
a history of nephrolithiasis and a question of
leiomyosarcoma, transferred from [**Hospital3 1196**]
for suspected urosepsis, positive troponin leak in the
setting of new atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular
response, status post cystoscopy with stent placement for
obstructing stone with pus.

He presented to [**Hospital3 1196**] with suspected
urinary tract infection based on a urinalysis and was given
Levaquin after [**Hospital3 **] and blood cultures were drawn and then
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
further management.  Here, he reported fevers, chills, nausea
and vomiting times two days.  He complained of some mild
dysuria times two days without frequency and had one episode
of nonbloody emesis and bile.  He had normal bowel movements.
He last had a urinary tract infection about seven months ago,
history requiring intervention, possible cysto.

The patient was admitted initially to the Medicine Service,
but on the morning of [**4-21**] complained of fatigue and mild
nausea without abdominal pain or back pain.  He was sleepy
and forgetful at times.  A CT scan was done to rule out stone
obstruction basically showed large right renal cyst, mild
hydronephrosis with periureteral stranding.

Overnight events on [**4-21**] were notable for atrial
fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response to 176.  He
was given Lopressor 5 mg intravenously times three.  Dinamap
showed blood pressure peaked at 140 there, with blood
pressure low of 85/58 and then up to 140s.  He spiked and was
cultured, and a dose of vancomycin was given.  Blood cultures
then came back with gram-negative rods in the blood.  He had
emesis times two on [**4-21**], and a small bowel movement on
[**4-21**].

In the afternoon of [**4-22**], he was brought to the operating
room for a cystoscopy, a right JJ stent (6 cm X 26 cm) was
placed.  Pus was drained from behind the obstructing stone.
The patient currently denies any chest pain, shortness of
breath, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.  He only
complains of thirst.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Diverticulitis.
3.  Nephrolithiasis; treated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 41116**] at
[**Hospital3 1196**].
4.  Right groin leiomyosarcoma had caused obstruction in the
past; surgery at [**Hospital6 1708**] with
orchiectomy, treated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
5.  Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine
of 1.2.
6.  Right renal complex calcified cyst last measured at
12 cm X 9 cm (as of [**2128-7-25**]).

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN causes hives.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:   Medications at home included
Vasotec and Hytrin.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Medications upon transfer from the
floor to the Intensive Care Unit included droperidol,
Dulcolax, Colace, Fleets, lactulose, intravenous fluids,
Tylenol, Ambien, aspirin, and Levaquin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a retired psychiatrist.  Son [**Doctor First Name **]
and daughter ([**Name (NI) **]).  Occasional alcohol use.  He quit
tobacco 40 years ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  In general, the
patient was sleep but easily arousable, supine, height of
5 feet 11 inches, weight of 250 pounds, temperature of 99,
pulse of 105, blood pressure of 138/56, oxygen saturation
of 96% on 2 liters nasal cannula.  Head, eyes, ears, nose,
and throat examination revealed extraocular muscles were
intact.  Normocephalic and atraumatic.  Cardiovascular
examination revealed irregularly irregular.  Normal first
heart sound and second heart sound.  No murmurs.  Pulmonary
examination anterolaterally revealed clear to auscultation.
The abdomen revealed normal active bowel sounds but
diminished overall, distended, and nontender.  Groin with a
well-healed inguinal scar, nontender.  Extremity examination
revealed no edema.  Neurologic examination revealed alert and
oriented times three, appropriate, moved all extremities.
Rectal was guaiac-negative/brown.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory data
on [**4-22**] revealed sodium of 141, potassium of 3.8,
chloride of 108, bicarbonate of 21, blood urea nitrogen
of 40, creatinine of 1.8, blood glucose of 105.  Creatine
kinase was 111, troponin was 18.3, CK/MB of 26, CK/MB index
was 23.4.  Magnesium of 1.7.  Arterial blood gas revealed
7.49/33/93/26.  Lactate was 3.8.  Blood cultures revealed
gram-negative rods, lactose fermenter not specified.  [**Month (only) **]
culture revealed pan-sensitive Escherichia coli,
gram-negative rods, lactose fermenter not speciated.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   KUB revealed nonspecific bowel gas
pattern with a few prominent gas-filled small bowel loops,
but no evidence of high-grade obstruction.

CT of the abdomen on [**4-21**] revealed a 8-mm obstructing
stone in the distal third of the right ureter producing mild
hydronephrosis, several other calcifications were noted in
the bilateral peripapillary regions, two 12-cm right renal
cysts with peripheral calcification was only partially
evaluated on the noncontrast examination.  Due to the
patient's renal failure, a renal magnetic resonance imaging
was recommended to exclude a more complex renal mass when
clinically indicated.  Cholelithiasis without obstruction or
cholecystitis.  Slight splenomegaly.  Linear soft tissue
stranding in the right inguinal region of uncertain etiology
of significance; please correlate with physical examination
and surgical history to exclude an acute inflammatory
process.  Apparent regions of focal bone loss in L3 vertebral
body and right femoral neck were likely degenerative.
Pathologic lesions could not be entirely excluded.

Electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation with a rapid
ventricular response of 160, with ST depressions in the
anterior leads of 2 mm to 3 mm.

IMPRESSION:  This is a 78-year-old man with urosepsis, atrial
fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, and positive
cardiac enzymes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE/UROLOGY:  The Urology Service followed
the patient while in the hospital, status post stent
placement with return of pus.  The stent was kept in place to
be removed several weeks after discharge when the patient was
more stable.  Only one stone was removed.  The patient had
evidence of more stones.  He was monitored for further signs
or symptoms of obstruction.

The patient was continued on intravenous Levaquin with the
consideration of adding gentamicin if his creatinine
tolerated this.  Vancomycin was discontinued.  Escherichia
coli in the [**Month (only) **] culture at the outside hospital was
pan-sensitive.  The patient was continued on aggressive
intravenous fluids.  Intravenous fluids were discontinued
because of evidence of congestive heart failure, and the
patient was encouraged to take p.o. hydration.

Cultures taken at [**Hospital1 69**] were
negative to date including blood cultures and [**Hospital1 **] cultures.
Levofloxacin was changed from intravenous to p.o. on
[**2129-4-24**].  The patient experienced some incontinence,
and his Pyridium was changed from p.r.n. to a standing dose.
Per the Urology team, he was also discharged on Urised two
tablets p.o. q.i.d. times 10 days for his incontinence.
Levofloxacin was to be continued for a total of 14 days.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Atrial fibrillation with a rapid
ventricular rate.  The patient was given doses of Lopressor
on the floor; a total of 50 mg intravenously.

In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was continued on
Lopressor for rate control.  He was anticoagulated with
heparin, and the plan was to get an echocardiogram on the
patient to rule out thrombus.  His atrial fibrillation was
thought to be triggered by his septic state.

The patient's troponin and creatine kinase leak/rise was
thought to be ischemia related to sepsis and atrial
fibrillation.  The patient had no known cardiac history.  The
patient was anticoagulated with heparin, continued on beta
blocker, and continued on aspirin.  Creatine kinases and
troponins were followed and trended down.  The patient
remained hemodynamically stable, although with some evidence
of
