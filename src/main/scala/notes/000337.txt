Allergies:
Albuterol

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2024**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
thoracentesis

History of Present Illness:
This is a 72 year old male with PMH significant for cutaneous
SCC metastatic to left axilla and lung, s/p resection ([**2162**]),
adjuvant XRT, chemotherapy (most recently on phase I protocol of
Torisel and Neratinib), atrial fibrillation on coumadin,
hypertension, and dyslipidemia who presents from clinic with two
days of shortness of breath and weakness.

Patient was seen in clinic for C5D15 of Torisel and Neratinib,
which has been on hold since [**3-9**] secondary to grade 2
mucositis.  There he was complaining of shortness of breath and
weakness.  His VS in clinic were notable for T 99.8, O2 79% on
transferring to bed which increased to 89% w/ deep breathing on
RA and 94% on 3L nc.  Patient states that his shortness of
breath started two days ago.  He endorses a light non-productive
cough at night.  He denies any fevers, chills, chest pain,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain.  He has baseline
mucositis with throat pain.

In the ED, initial vs were: 99, 112/77, 75, 28, 97% on 4L.  His
exam was notable for tachypnea despite breathing mid 90s on 4L
nc.  A rectal temp was 101.4.  Labs were notable for 91% PMNs,
but no leukocytosis (WBC 5.6), and a subtherapeutic INR 1.3. CXR
was concerning for RLL infiltrates.  CTA was negative for PE but
evident for new right pleural effusion and RLL consolidation.
CT head was negative for acute bleed.  Blood cx were drawn and
patient received iv vanc and zosyn, tylenol, and 1L NS.  In the
ED, his patient and wife expressed that should his respiratory
status decompensate he is agreeable to intubation.  He was
transferred for further monitor of his hypoxia.

On the floor, patient stated breathing much improved.

Review of sytems:

Oncology History:
Initially presented in [**2162**] with a left anterior chest lesion.
-On [**2162-10-14**], he underwent surgical resection of squamous cell
carcinoma with an advancement flap. Specimen measured 3.4 x 2.5
cm and extended to a depth of 1.1 cm. Pathology- moderately
differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with focal lymphatic and
perineural invasion.
-[**5-/2163**], he developed swelling involving the left axilla.  On
[**2163-7-11**], FNA of this lymphadenopathy was positive for
malignant cells consistent with metastatic squamous cell cancer.

-[**2163-8-5**], complete axillary lymph node dissection, [**2-18**] lymph
nodes were involved with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma
measuring up to 3.9 cm in greatest dimension with foci of
extracapsular extension.  [**8-/2163**], Adjuvant radiation therapy
to the left axilla- 5094 cGy to the left axilla with left chest
wall boost of 3000 cGy, completed on [**2163-9-19**].
-[**1-/2164**], bilateral small pulmonary nodules which increased in
size; [**2164-3-25**]-biopsy confirmed metastatic squamous cell cancer.
In [**4-/2164**], the patient received carboplatin at an AUC of 5
combined with paclitaxel 175 mg/m2.  He completed four cycles
and subsequently was treated with capecitabine and most recently
six cycles of single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] gemcitabine completed on [**2164-10-11**].

- Currently on phase I protocol #09-066. Cycle 5 day 15 of his
drugs were held in the setting of grade II mucositis and thrush.



Social History:
Patient lives at home with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] is a retired investment
banker.  He endorses drinking [**1-26**] glasses of wine weekly.  He
denies a history of smoking or illicit drug use.

Mother deceased CVA.  Father deceased MI.  Sister deceased from
renal failure r/t DM.

EKGs:
[**2165-3-20**] Atrial fibrillation, average ventricular rate 82.
Moderate baseline artifact. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2164-10-25**] the rate has slowed from 135 to 82 and the rhythm has
changed from atrial flutter with 2:1 block to atrial
fibrillation. In addition, the current tracing has regression of
the ST-T wave changes noted in leads II, III, aVF and V3-V6 at
that time.

Imaging:
[**2165-3-20**] AP CXR - IMPRESSION: Increased pulmonary edema, cannot
exclude bibasilar consolidation. Known pulmonary metastases.

[**2165-3-20**] CT HEAD - prelim - no acute bleed or sig change from
prior

[**2165-3-20**] CTA Chest - IMPRESSION:
1. No definite evidence of pulmonary embolism, slightly limited
by
respiratory motion.
2. Interval increase in size of multiple bilateral pulmonary
metastases.
3. Increase in mediastinal adenopathy.
4. Right basilar pleural thickening and nodularity with a new
moderate right pleural effusion, associated with atelectasis and
consolidation of the right lower lobe.
5. Patchy opacities in the right middle and left upper lobes,
may be
infectious or inflammatory.

[**2165-3-21**] Transthoracic ECHO - The left atrium is markedly
dilated. The right atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is
considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular
ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation
