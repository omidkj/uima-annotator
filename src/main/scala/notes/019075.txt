Pertinent Results:
Intra-op TEE [**2131-8-23**]
Conclusions
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left
ventricular cavity is dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed (LVEF= 10-15% %). with mild
global RV free wall hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild to moderate ([**2-4**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the
results on [**2131-8-23**] at 1500 hours. .

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2131-8-23**]
where the patient underwent Left mini thoracotomy, and
epicardial lead placement times 2. Overall the patient tolerated
the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the
CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.

POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery on
post-operative day #1.  Chest tubes were discontinued without
complication on POD #1.  The patient was evaluated by the
physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility.  By the time of discharge on post-operative day #4,
the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and
pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was
discharged to home with services in good condition with
appropriate follow up instructions.  The patient remained
relatively hypotensive, and Lisinopril, ISMN and Coreg were
held.  These should be resumed as an outpatient when BP allows.
