[**2104-9-21**] CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST
1. Small right pneumothorax. Posterior lung base consolidations
likely
represent a combination of aspiration and atelectasis.
2. No mediastinal vascular injury.
3. Large right hepatic lobe laceration, without evidence of
active arterial extravasation. Large volume hemoperitoneum.
4. Left femoral neck fracture partially imaged. Correlate with
dedicated left hip radiographs.
5. Possible nondisplaced fracture of the right posterior fourth
rib.

[**2104-9-21**] CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIAL W/O CONTRAST
1. Right orbital blowout fracture with fractures involving the
right lamina papyracea and lateral right orbital wall extending
to the right inferior orbital fissure. Right globe proptosis
with small amount of extraconal retrobulbar hematoma on the
right. Right periorbital and preseptal soft tissue swelling with
right preseptal soft tissue emphysema.
2. Blood layering within the paranasal sinuses.
3. Small tooth fragment embedded within the left nasal cavity
with probable fractured tooth in the right lower mandibular
region. Correlate with exam.

[**2104-9-21**] HAND (AP, LAT & OBLIQUE) LEFT
Impacted intra-articular fracture of the left distal radius.

[**2104-9-25**] LENI
[**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right common femoral,
superficial femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial and peroneal
veins were performed. Normal compressibility, flow and
augmentation was observed. The same evaluation of the left lower
extremity demonstrated a thrombus in the left common femoral
vein occluding less than 20% of the vessel by cross-sectional
area. The remainder of the left lower extremity exhibited normal
compressibility, flow and augmentation.
IMPRESSION: Small non-occlusive mural thrombus in the left
common femoral vein. No other DVT is present.

[**2104-9-27**]  CTPA
Contrast opacification is seen to the level of the proximal
lobar
arteries; majority of distal lobar and segmental arteries are
not well
evaluated on this examination. However, there is acute thrombus
involving the medial and anterior basal segments of the right
lower lobe. These demonstrate a centralized appearance with
partial occlusion and luminal expansion. Small right
pneumothorax has resolved. Multiple round ground-glass opacities
have developed in the peripheral upper lobes, as well as the
right perihilar region. There is worsening bibasilar
atelectasis, right greater than left.  The heart is normal in
size, without pericardial effusion. There is no evidence of
right heart strain. Note is made of a small sliding hiatal
hernia. No definite fractures are identified; previously
questioned right posterior fourth rib fracture is not well
appreciated on this exam. Examination is not tailored for
subdiaphragmatic evaluation, but partially reveals an extensive
right hepatic lobe laceration. There has been interval decrease
in perihepatic and perisplenic hemorrhage. Spleen remains
borderline enlarged at 14 cm.
IMPRESSION:
1. Acute right lower lobe PE. Additional segmental emboli cannot
be excluded on this examination.
2. New ground-glass opacities in the peripheral upper lobes and
right perihilar region. These may represent focal atelectasis,
late contusions, aspiration, or infection.
3. Worsening lower lobe atelectasis, right greater than left.

[**2104-9-30**] ECHO
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 5-10 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no left ventricular outflow
obstruction at rest or with Valsalva. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.

[**2104-10-2**] HIDA
Serial images over the abdomen show uptake of tracer into the
hepatic parenchyma. At 6 minutes, the gallbladder is visualized
with tracer activity noted in the small bowel at 21 minutes.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of bile leak.
