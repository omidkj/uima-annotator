Studies:
---------
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2134-1-4**] 11:35 AM
FINDINGS: PA and lateral chest x-ray dated [**2134-1-4**] is compared
to the prior from [**2130-12-21**]. The heart size is normal. The
mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The lungs are clear.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is moderate
gastric distention with elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. The
surrounding osseous structures show mild levoconvex scoliosis
centered at T11, stable.

IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
.
ECG ([**1-5**]):
Sinus rhythm. Noisy baseline signal. Mild J point elevation in
lead V2.
Mild diffuse infero-apical ST segment flattening. Compared with
prior
tracing of [**2133-9-26**], rate is somewhat faster. There are no other
diagnostic
changes.

Brief Hospital Course:
46 yo woman with asthma, DM2 and obesity presents with acute
asthma exacerbation.
.
## Acute asthma exacerbation: No infiltrate on CXR to suggest
udnerlying pneumonia as inciting event. Likely viral URI.
Received albuterol nebs, ipratropium nebs, methylprednisolone,
magnesium IV in the ED and at clinic with moderate response.
Intial ABG demonstrated 7.56/22/109. Given mild increase in
cough at night, started on PPI.  Was admitted to the ICU due to
frequent nebulizer requirement (initially albuterol q1-2hrs).
Was kept on atrovent nebs and given prednisone 60mg.  Albuterol
nebs ultimately weaned down to q6hours and patient was
transferred to the medicine floor.  Patient was afebrile with
normal WBC count, therefore antibiotics were not given.
.
## DM2: Has high insulin requirement at home. Continued on
protamine/aspart 70/30.  Metformin was held.  Patient reports
getting diarrhea with metformin at home so she did not want to
restart this in the hospital.  Fingersticks were somewhat
elevated, likely due to the prednisone.
.
## Hypertension: continued on lisinopril 40 mg daily.
.
## Depression: continued on venlafaxine 75 mg daily.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with worsening of your asthma.  This was
likely brought on by a viral infection.  You should continue to
take Prednisone for 3 more days (5 days total).  While you are
on the prednisone, your blood sugars may be higher.  You should
use your flovent inhaler daily and you can use your albuterol
inhaler as you need it.  If the albuterol inhaler is not
helping, you can use the albuterol nebulizer.  You can re-start
your Metformin and your home insulin regimen.  Try to avoid
things that might trigger your asthma.  Some of the common
things are polle
