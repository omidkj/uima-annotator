Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2145**]
Chief Complaint:
Heart failure and mitral regurgitation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
TEE
PICC
Coronary Angiography


History of Present Illness:
72 F w/ pmh of HTN, p/w slurred speech and weakness X 5-6 days.
Complained of feeling "weak in the legs", progressively worse
over the week prior to presentation. Sons also noted that her
speech was slurred and thinking was slowed. Otherwise, no
CP/N/V/LH/SOB or fever, though sons note that she is stoic and
does not often tell them even if she is experiencing symptoms.
On morning of presentation, she was still in bed at 11 am which
was unusual for her so sons brought her in to [**Name (NI) **].
.
In the ED, noted to be in sinus brady in the 30s, with BP as low
as 83/65 so received calcium and atropine w/o change so received
temp wire. Also hypothermic to 89.8. Admitted to ICU.
.
Total CKs were 259->215->136, with CK-MB 56->51->40 and Trop T
0.09->0.08->0.10. Heparin gtt was initiated. At some point
during her stay, she became hypotensive and had low UOP and was
given 3.5L IVF, and briefly on dopamine gtt. In setting of
volume resuscitation, had pulmonary edema and respiratory
failure requiring NRB. CHF by CXR.

ECHO showed w/ [**2-10**]+ TR and [**2-10**]+ MR (mild thickening) and EF
60-65%. Pulm pressure 26.
.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for catheterization for NSTEMI and possible
mitral valve surgery.
.
On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope. She has chronic lower
extremity edema and scaling for which she wears compression
stockings.


Past Medical History:
HTN
LE edema, chronic


Social History:
Quit smoking 20 yrs ago, w/ 1.5 ppd prior. 3-4 beers per day.
Lives independently alone. Independent w/ ADLs.


Family History:
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death.


Physical Exam:
VS: T 96.0, BP 141/58, HR 80, RR 19, O2 95% on NRB
Gen: Elderly female in NAD, resp or otherwise. Speaking in full
sentences. Oriented x3. Pleasant.
HEENT: NCAT. Sclera anicteric. PERRL, EOMI. Conjunctiva were
pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Neck: Supple with JVP of 15 cm.
CV: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
RR, normal S1, S2. 2-3/6 syst mur @ apex
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis. Resp
were unlabored, no accessory muscle use. Marked bilat crackles
1/2 up.
Abd: Soft, NTND, No HSM or tenderness. No abdominial bruits.
Ext: Bilateral erythema with scaling.


Pertinent Results:
Echo:
IMPRESSION: Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Mild-moderate
mitral regurgitation with with some variation (increase) with
paced vs. native conduction. Low normal left ventricular
systolic function. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
.
CTA:
CONCLUSION:
1.  No central or segmental pulmonary embolism, however, due to
atelectasis
and bibasal effusions, small subsegmental peripheral pulmonary
emboli cannot
be excluded in the lower lobes.
2.  Background emphysema with scattered ground-glass opacities
and multifocal
fibrosis likely is a combination of interstitial lung disease,
consolidation,
and fluid overload.
.
Cardiac catheterization:
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
2. Normal ventricular function

Brief Hospital Course:
#)Bacteremia:
Patient intially presented to OSH with severe hypothermia,
bradiacardia and hypotension.  At that time she had a temporary
pacing wire placed and was given significant IV hydration for
her hypotension.  On transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] she was noted to have [**5-15**]
positive blood cultures for MSSA. Surveillance cultures have
been negative to date. The source of her infection is unclear.
One possible source is the multiple cuts on her fingers, another
possible source is the central line placed at the OSH.  It is
believed that an infection/sepsis picture is responsible for her
initial presentation with slurred speach and weakness.  TEE
performed did not show any evidence of vegitations.  She will
need a total of three weeks of IV antibiotics.
.
#)History of Slurred Speech:
She was initially seen by neurology consult at OSH and they were
concerned for thromboembolic stroke in setting of Atrial
fibrillation. Unclear history of atrial fibrillation as we only
have mention of afib on an EKG discussing previous EKGs. MRI/MRA
done did not show any evidence of ischemic insult. Neuro consult
in house believed the infection most likley caused the
difficulty speaking.  She is no without symptoms.  Unclear
documentation of Afib, but even so, her chads2 score is 2 and at
this time we would not favor anticoagulation because of known
aneurysm.  This will need to be readdressed in the future by her
PCP after evaluation of the aneurysm by neurosurgery.  She was
continued on ASA 325mg daily
.
#)11-mm right posterior communicating artery aneurysm - will
need evalutation as outpatient with a neuro surgeon
.
#)Acute systolic and diastolic heart failure:
Patient initially admitted to CCU with acute pulmonary edema.
Repeat Echo showed only mild to moderate MR and low normal
ejection fraction. Her shortness of breath was attributed to
pulmonary edema from volume repletion in the OSH and she was
diuresed. Patient went for cardiac catheterization which did not
show any significant coronary artery disease. Temporary wire
pacing was initiated for bradycardia and home dose of atenolol
was held. Bradycardia resolved. CTA performed which was negative
for PE.  At the time of discharge she seemed dry and lasix were
not continued.
.
# CAD/Ischemia:
There were elevated cardiac biomarkers on presentation, cardiac
catheterization on [**12-5**] with clean coronary arteries.
Elevation likely secondary to stretched myocardium from fluid
overload.
.
# Rhythm:
She presented with bradycardia in the 30s. She required a
temporary pacer temporarily though this was discontinued after
the bradycardia resolved.
.
#)Anemia:
Unclear baseline HCT, 30 at OSH, slowly trended down initially
during this hospitalization. [**Month (only) 116**] be from frequent blood draws.
Hemolysis labs negative. Iron studies not consistenet with iron
deficiency, li
