received 1.5 LNS and 20mg valium as well as combivent nebs,
Azithromycin, and steroids for COPD flare.
.
Currently, unable to relate hx, denies current SOB, denies pain;
would like to go home. Does endorse having had cough, SOB

MICROBIOLOGY:
=============
[**6-18**] BCx x 2:  NGTD
[**6-18**] UCx: negative

STUDIES:
========
[**6-18**] EKG:
Sinus tachycardia. Left atrial enlargement. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2189-11-10**] there are non-specific
inferolateral ST segment changes and an increase in rate.
Otherwise, no diagnostic interim change.

[**6-18**] PCXR:
IMPRESSION: No cardiopulmonary process.

[**6-18**] CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolus or acute thoracic aortic
dissection.
2. Findings suggestive of esophageal diverticulum without any
the secondary signs to suggest a fistula. Consider further
evaluation with esophagram if warranted clinically.

[**6-19**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic pathology including no
pneumonia or heart failure.

6/19 ESOPHAGUS
IMPRESSION: Unremarkable barium esophagram, without evidence of
a
tracheoesophageal fistula.

TTE (Complete) Done [**2194-6-20**]
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION:
Normal study. Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
global and regional biventricular systolic function. No valvular
pathology or pathologic flow identified.

[**6-20**] CXR (PA & LATERAL)
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**6-19**], there is no
interval change.  The cardiac silhouette remains within normal
limits with no evidence of vascular congestion, pleural
effusion, or acute pneumonia. Of incidental note is contrast
material, possibly from a recent CT, in the
left upper quadrant of the abdomen.

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU COURSE SUMMARY:
=====================
Ms. [**Known lastname 5108**] is a 39 y.o. with alcohol and crack cocaine abuse
history, h/o psychosis and multiple hospitalizations for psych
issues, and no known pulmonary disorder, transferred from OSH
for dyspnea and tachycardia during her most recent inpatient
stay for detox at [**Hospital **] Hospital ([**Date range (1) 54167**]). She then was
transferred to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital because her [**Hospital 269**] noticed that
she was tachycardic, her temperature was "99". She was there for
24 hours, then transferred to [**Hospital **] Hospital for substance abuse
issues. She was noted to have increased SOB and wheezing and
treated for COPD/asthma flare. Prior to this, she reports having
a cough for about 2 weeks. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management of her medical problems.

In the ED, she was hypertensive to 160s tachycardic to the 120s
afebrile and sating 100%RA. She had diffuse wheezes on exam. Her
CXR was unrevealing and CT chest was negative for PE. She
received 1.5 L NS and 20mg Valium as well as Combivent nebs,
Azithromycin, and steroids for COPD flare.

In the MICU, pt had insp/exp stridor. CTA initially showed ?
