CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fever, hypertension and hypoxia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 42 year-old woman with
a history of schizophrenia, mental retardation who was
brought in by her care provider for having increased lethargy
and decreased po intake.  Per the report of her home care
provider, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient has had decreased po intakes in the
last few weeks and had increased lethargy over the last few
days.  She also had a low grade temperature and has been
breathing rapidly, but otherwise no abdominal pain, nausea,
vomiting or diarrhea.  No cough.  Per her care provider the
patient did have a lot of sick contacts at her day care place
where there are several cases of strep throat, upper
respiratory infection and flu.  The patient was seen by her
primary care physician four days prior to admission for a
questionable right sided abdominal tenderness.  She was sent
home after some laboratory tests.  The laboratories at the
office were notable for AST of 66, alkaline phosphatase 137,
and TSH of 7.0.  Upon arrival to the Emergency Room on the
day of admission her temperature was 102.6, heart rate 112,
blood pressure 94/50, O2 sat 78% on room air.  Finger stick
96.  Per the patient's home care provider her mental status
was at her baseline.  She was given a dose of Vancomycin and
Ceftriaxone in the Emergency Room for empirical coverage.  CT
angio was obtained, which revealed submassive PE and splenic
infarct.  She was admitted to the MICU for PE and sepsis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Schizophrenia, mental retardation.
She has been institutionalized since age 17 until two years
ago when she was finally allowed to leave institution and
live with a care provider.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] disorder, anemia, SV1
dermatitis, hypothyroidism on replacement.

ALLERGIES:  Moban.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Clozaril 100 mg po b.i.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 102.6, heart
rate 102, blood pressure 101/53.  Oxygenation 93% on 50%

 Neurological not able to fully cooperate with neurological
examination, but otherwise grossly intact.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 7.3,
hematocrit 28.3, stable at baseline, platelets at 138, MCV
36, 35% neutrophils, 16% bands, 38% lymphocytes, 10% atypical
cells.  Sodium 136, potassium 4.0, chloride 101, bicarb 26,
BUN 16, creatinine .7, glucose 90.  AST 104, ALT 50, alkaline
phosphatase 128, total bilirubin .3, ammonia 17, calcium
17.9, mag2.6, PT 15.2, PTT 43.5, INR 1.5.  Depakote 97.
Arterial blood gas on admission with nonrebreather was pH
7.46, PCO2 37, PO2 95.  Lactate 2.2. Urinalysis was specific
gravity of 1.024, pH 6, negative leukocyte esterase or
nitrites, negative protein, trace ketone, trace blood, trace
protein, 0 to 2 reds, 0 to 2 whites, no bacteria or yeast, 0
to 2 epi.  Chest x-ray showed increased opacity at the left
retrocardiac region concerning for possible pneumonia.  Chest
CT angio occlusive right middle lobe segmental PE with
extension to the right main pulmonary artery, nonocclusive
right basilar segmental emboli.  Multiple bilateral wedged
shaped areas of consolidation extending to pleural surfaces.
Bilateral ground glass opacities.  Small bilateral pleural
effusion.  Multiple enlarged hilar and mediastinal lymph
nodes.  Apparent right subclavian artery tracheal malacia.
Enlarged spleen with a posterior infarct.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to MICU, but no
pressors or intubation was needed.  She was called out to the
floor on hospital day five.  As her chest x-ray on admission
with possible pneumonia she was started on Levofloxacin and
Flagyl for both community acquired pneumonia and possible
aspiration pneumonia.  Since her electrocardiogram on
admission revealed new onset of right bundle branch block CT
angio was obtained on admission, which revealed submassive
occlusive emboli to right middle lobe segmental artery and
nonocclusive emboli to right basilar submental artery as well
as a splenic infarct.  She was started on intravenous heparin
and Coumadin for anticoagulation.  She also had a
transthoracic echocardiogram, which showed no evidence of
patent foramen ovale.  The hypercoagulable workup including
protein S, protein C, prothrombin mutation, factor 5 laden
mutation was sent in addition to antiphospholipid antibodies.
The only noticeable available results upon her discharge was
positive anticardiolipen IGM with moderately high titer.
Given her fevers, splenomegaly and atypical lymphocytes on
blood smear monospot was obtained on admission, which came
back positive.  Further workup including serologies for EBV,
toxo, HIV and CMV all came back negative except positive IGM
for EBV, VCA, which suggested acute EBV infection.  The
hepatitis panel also came back negative for hepatitis B and
hepatitis C.  The trace amylase and LDH levels were initially
trending up likely secondary to acute viral infection and
loss PE and splenic infarct.  The chest amylase and LDH
levels started to improve on their own after peaked at 300s
and 1000s range respectively.  She finished a ten day course
of Levofloxacin and Flagyl for presumptive pneumonia and
chest x-ray and CT.  Her lingering low grade temperature was
most likely secondary to viral syndrome and eventually
resolved on its own.  All of her blood cultures and urine
cultures were negative in house.

In the setting of initial septic picture the decision was
also made to taper off Clozaril given the risk of a
granulocytosis.  Olanzapine was started to replace the
Clozaril.  Since the patient had episodes of supratherapeutic
INR and complained of persistent dizziness in the absence of
orthostatic signs a head CT was obtained, which showed no
evidence of cerebellar infarct or hemorrhage, since we are
entertaining the hypothesis of induced hypercoagulable state
due to EBV induced antiphospholipid antibody formation.  The
decision was made to recheck antiphospholipid antibody in
four to six weeks and then make the decision whether the
patient should be on life long anticoagulation versus one
year.  During her hospital stay she also received 1 unit of
packed red blood cells on the floor for worsening anemia,
which was likely due to bone marrow suppression in the
setting of acute viral infection.
