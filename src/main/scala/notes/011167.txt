Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 20146**]
Chief Complaint:
Presenting from OSH for tracheal and esophageal stent placement
secondary to squamous cell lung carcinoma.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
- Tracheal Y-stent placement [**2150-8-5**]
- Esophageal stent placement [**2150-8-6**]
- Bronchoscopy [**2150-8-7**]


History of Present Illness:
In brief, this patient is a 76 yo M former smoked admitted on
[**8-3**] from [**Hospital6 1597**] for worsening dyspnea and 60 pound
weight loss over 4 months and found to have a moderately
differentiated squamous cell lung CA compressing the right
mainstem bronchus and esophagus. He underwent bronchoscopy that
showed squamous CA with no mets seen on CT head, abdomen/pelvis.
Was treated with a 15 day course of levofloxacin for
post-obstructive PNA and received 3 doses of radiation therapy.
He developed solid food dysphagia and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for esophageal stenting, but was determined to need tracheal
stenting first. Tracheal stenting was performed on [**8-5**] followed
by esophageal stenting on [**8-6**], afterwhich he developed atrial
fibrillation. He was started on metoprolol for rate control,
then spontaneously converted back to sinus. He had a CXR that
showed collapse of his RLL and RML with mild aeration of RUL. He
transferred to the MICU to undergo flexible bronchoscopy; RUL
reopened but remainder of bronchus intermedius obscured by
tumor.
.
He was started on a diltiazem gtt which was stopped on [**8-2**] and
transitioned to diltiazem PO; currently in and out of afib/sinus
rhythm. Currently on steroid taper since transfer for COPD
exacerbation. Seen by radiation oncology in consult on [**8-8**];
they recommended sending him back to [**Hospital3 **] to finish
radiation in order to avoid delay of treatment.
.
Esophageal stent is partially occluded but he is tolerating a
ground dysphagia/thin liquids diet.

Past Medical History:
- Lung cancer
- Epilepsy (age [**11-10**] yrs, was on Dilantin and stopped)
- Appendectomy

Social History:
- Lives in [**Hospital3 **] facility by himself but able to
manage ADL without assistance. Was formerly a dry cleaner.
- Long time smoker (started at age 13yr) 2ppd til 2 wks ago
- EtOH - 3 beers/night, more at younger age
- IVDU - denies

Family History:
- Rheumatoid Arthritis

CARDIOLOGY [**2150-8-4**]   Cardiology ECG: Sinus rhythm with atrial
premature beat. Rightward axis. Low QRS voltage in leads I and
aVL. Findings are non-specific and may be within normal limits
but cannot exclude possible chronic pulmonary disease. Clinical
correlation is suggested. No previous tracing available for
comparison.

RADIOLOGY
IMAGING:
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY Study Date of [**2150-8-8**]
1:59 PM
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. 2. Interval placement of
patent tracheal Y-stent. Worsening of right lower lobe collapse
and consolidation since prior CT (though improved from recent
radiographs), likely due to tumoral involvement and/or
secretions within right lower lobe airways. Similar appearance
of locally invasive hilar/mediastinal mass, consistent with
reported history of squamous cell lung cancer. 3. Increased left
pleural effusion and left basilar consolidation and atelectasis,
consistent with pneumonia and possibly aspiration. Small right
pleural effusion little changed; pleural enhancement noted and
pleural involvement by tumor cannot be excluded. 4. Status post
esophageal stent placement, which is collapsed at its waist, and
nearly completely occluded, with air-fluid levels, proximal and
distal to the waist of the stent. 5. 13 mm left upper lobe
ground glass opacity is nonspecific, and may
represent aspiration, infection, or tumor. 7 mm right upper lobe
nodule.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2150-8-8**] 10:28 AM
Since the previous study, there has been some improvement in the
aeration at the right middle lobe and right base. However, there
remains increased opacity and right-sided pleural effusion in
this location. There are no signs for overt pulmonary edema. The
left lung is clear. There are no pneumothoraces identified.


Brief Hospital Course:
76 yo M with long hx of tobacco smoking, appendectomy, and
epilepsy in youth presenting from OSH after x4 radiation
treatments, 15 day Levofloxacin course for pna, and steroid
taper for COPD exacerbation presenting for tracheal and
esophageal stent placement for lung carcinoma.

1. Squamous cell lung carcinoma: Pt received x4 sessions of XRT
at [**Hospital6 1597**] prior to transfer. During the patient's
admission, he tolerated esophageal and airway stenting, but
developed atrial fibrillation with RVR during his course.  On
discharge to Rehab, the patient will need to continue palliative
XRT at [**Hospital3 **] under the care of [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 87328**], MD, who can
be reached at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 87329**].

2. Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Post-stenting, the patient
developed AF with RVR requiring MICU transfer for diltiazem gtt.
 He was converted to a standing oral regimen on transfer to the
general floor, and was noted to be in sinus with 1:1 conduction
for the duration with intermitent episodes of rate-controlled
atrial fibrillation. He will need to continue diltiazem on
discharge. Given multiple recent interventions performed,
aspirin therapy was deferred during his admission, but can be
considered on discharge.

3. COPD exacerbation: Patient was transferred on prednisone for
a presumed COPD exacerbation.  His was stable from a respiratory
standpoint during his admission on a baseline home oxygen
requirement of 2L nc (unchanged from prior to admission), and he
will be discharged on a prednisone taper. The directions for his
prednisone are: Prednisone 20 mg daily for 4 days, then 10 mg
daily for 4 days, then STOP

4. Urinary retention: Following tracheal stent placement, the
patient developed urinary retention. A foley catheter was placed
and Tamsulosin was started [**2150-8-6**] with successful voiding trial.

5. Pneumonia: Patient completed a 15 day course of levofloxacin
during his admission.

6. Smoking cessation: Patient continued on nicotine patch during
admission.

7. Hyponatremia: Patient developed hyponatremia to 130. He will
have a repeat BMP as well as urine electrolytes, creatinine and
osmolality checked as an outpatient to determine appropriate
course of action. Ddx includes volume depletion vs. SIADH.

Prophylaxis: Patient received heparin products during admission.
