Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo female with CoreValve [**2156-2-19**], since then several
admissions to [**Hospital1 **] for weakness, one for pAfib, now presents
for HTN emergency, SBP 200s with headahces.
.
# HTN EMERGENCY - Patient was placed on a nicardipine dip in the
ED and then admitted to the CCU.  There was no evidence of
aortic dissection, papillary muscle rupture, head bleed, renal
failure, ACS, or pulmonary edema.  The patient's blood pressure
was maintained in range of SBPs 160s-170s, as that is what she
usually runs, even on multiple antihypertensives.  She came in
on lisinopril and metoprolol, and, in house, she was
transitioned from the nicardipine drip to lisinopril,
amlodipine, and carvedilol.  Her CCU course was unremarkable,
and she was transferred to the regular cardiology floor for
optimization of anti-hypertensives prior to discharge.
.
# CORONARIES: Last cath [**11/2155**] showed LAD w/ 30% stenosis in the
mid vessel and an eccentric 70% stenosis in a diagonal branch.
The LCx had a 60% stenosis proximal vessel.  Her cardiac enzymes
did not increase during her hospital stay, and she did not
report chest pain.  She was discharged on carvedilol,
lisinopril, aspirin, atorvastatin, and Plavix.
.
# PUMP: Last Echo [**6-/2156**] showed an EF > 55%.  During her
hospital stay, she had no signs or symptoms or cardiac failure.
.
# CKD (baseline Cr 1.1-1.4): Patient came it with a creatinine
within her baseline range (1.2), and stayed within her baseline
range during the admission.
.
Transitional Issues:
Patient will follow up with cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
