History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 80 year old female with PMH significant for
atrial fibrillation on coumadin, COPD on 2L NC, HTN, s/p CVA,
recurrent UTI on macrodantin who presents with 3 days of right
sided flank pain. She has been having additional dysuria and
mild nausea at home with poor PO intake but denies any vomiting.

Imaging:
[**2193-11-8**] CXR: There is little interval change. Opacity at the
left base, with associated pleural thickening is chronic,
compatible with a small effusion and associated atelectasis.
There is no superimposed focal consolidation to suggest
pneumonia. Heart size is stable, top-normal. There is mild
pulmonary vascular congestion and likely early interstitial
edema. Calcification of the aortic knob is again noted.
IMPRESSION:  Stable left basilar opacity, compatible with small
effusion and associated atelectasis, without significant
interval change.

[**2193-11-9**] CTU: There is minimal pleural thickening at the bases,
without effusion or consolidation. This is similar in appearance
to prior chest CT [**2193-3-12**]. The liver is normal in size
and appearance, without focal lesions. The patient is status
post cholecystectomy. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic
biliary ductal dilation. The spleen is normal. The pancreas
demonstrates homogeneous enhancement, without ductal dilation or
mass lesions. There are no adrenal nodules or masses. The left
kidney is notable for a punctate non-obstructing stone in the
interpolar region, and a hyperdense cyst demonstrating no
post-contrast enhancement, measuring 12 mm, in the lower pole.
There is no left hydronephrosis, and the left ureter is normal
in caliber throughout its course. However, on the right, there
is moderate hydronephrosis, with associated hydroureter and
periureteral stranding extending into the pelvis, where there is
a 6-mm obstructing stone in the distal ureter. There is a large
right renal cyst, measuring up to 8.4 cm, extending laterally
from the mid pole of the kidney. There is no further focal
hypoenhancing renal lesion or perinephric fluid collection to
suggest pyelonephritis or perinephric abscess.  However, there
is a delayed nephrogram on the right relative to the left.
Subtle urothelial enhancement is also noted. The stomach,
duodenum, and intra-abdominal loops of small bowel are normal in
caliber and configuration. There is no bowel distention or bowel
wall
thickening. There is no free fluid or free air in the abdomen.
There is no
mesenteric or retroperitoneal adenopathy. The aorta is calcified
but normal in caliber, and major mesenteric vessels are patent,
including the superior mesenteric and portal veins. There is no
fluid in the retroperitoneum.  CT PELVIS: Rectum and sigmoid
colon demonstrate scattered diverticula, without evidence for
acute diverticulitis. Uterus and adnexa are unremarkable. A
Foley catheter decompresses the bladder. There is no free pelvic
fluid, and there is no pelvic or inguinal adenopathy. BONE
WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions are
identified. Likely bone islands are seen in the right femoral
head.
_______ seen in the lumbar spine. IMPRESSION: 1. A 6-mm
obstructing distal right ureteral stone with associated
hydroureter and moderate hydronephrosis. There is slight delayed
nephrogram of the right kidney post-contrast administration, but
no focal lesions to suggest pyelonephritis or renal abscess.
There is a large right renal cyst. Minimal urothelial
enhancement is also noted. 2. Punctate non-obstructing left
renal stone, with a single hyperdense renal cyst on the left.
Otherwise, unremarkable left kidney. 3. Sigmoid diverticulosis,
without diverticulitis. 4. Aortic atherosclerosis, without
aneurysm.
.
[**2193-11-11**] Right LENIS: No evidence of DVT at the right lower
extremity.
.
[**2193-11-11**] Chest Port Line Placement: Right PICC terminates in the
upper SVC. Persistent left pleural effusion and atelectasis.
