FEMUR (AP & LAT) RIGHT  [**2180-4-14**] 10:18 AM
Four views of the right femur again show a comminuted displaced
right intertrochanteric fracture with varus deformity. The
remainder of this femur is intact. Tricompartmental degenerative
changes in the right knee with medial joint space narrowing.
(suboptimally assessed with knee radiographs not obtained, but
no fracture in this area).

CT RECONSTRUCTION  [**2180-4-14**] 9:38 AM
IMPRESSION: Comminuted intratrochanteric fracture of the right
proximal femur. The lesser trochanter is a separate fragment.
Severe degenerative changes opposite left hip, without evidence
for underlying etiology (LCPerthes or SCFE). Associated muscular
atrophy of all pelvic and proximal leg muscles on the left.
Lucency previously described in right ilium represents a normal
nutrient foramen. No other pelvic fracture is seen. Vascular
calcification are abnormal in this age group.

CT RECONSTRUCTION  [**2180-4-14**] 9:10 AM
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:
1) Hemoperitoneum, with a pocket of high attenuation fluid
consistent with blood within the small bowel mesentery,
concerning for mesenteric vascular injury. Small amount of blood
surrounding the liver, without evidence of hepatic injury.
2) No evidence of other intra-abdominal/pelvic major organ
injury or aortic injury. No evidence of extravasation of
arterial contrast or collecting system contrast.
3) Small right-sided pneumothorax.
4) Burst fracture of the L1 vertebral body (there are six lumbar
vertebrae), with extension into the right-sided posterior
elements and involving the facet joint. Approximately 50%
retropulsion of several vertebral body fragments into the spinal
canal, impinging and compressing the spinal cord at this level.
Correlate with clinical symptoms.
5) Comminuted, displaced right intratrochanteric fracture.
6) Probable subtle nondisplaced 4th right, posterior rib
fracture.
7) Subtle linear lucency at the lateral aspect of the right
iliac crest, which may represent a small nondisplaced fracture
versus a nutrient foramen. Slight assymetric enlargement of the
iliacus muscle at this level, suggesting a possible small
intramuscular hematoma. See dedicated CT pelvis bone algorithm
CT under separate clip number.
8) Cortical fragment anterior to the superior endplate of L5
which appears more likely to represent a degenerative osteophyte
than an acute fracture. Again see dedicated CT pelvis under
separate clip number.
9) Decompressed bladder with Foley, without evidence of bladder
injury, though a CT cystogram would be much more sensative to
assess for this if there is clinical suspicion.

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2180-4-14**] 9:09 AM IMPRESSION: No
cervical spine fracture. Right apical pneumothorax.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2180-4-14**] 9:09 AM IMPRESSION: No
intracranial hemorrhage

MR L SPINE SCAN  [**2180-4-14**] 12:31 PM
IMPRESSION: L1 vertebral body burst fracture with retropulsion
of the fracture fragments and compression of the conus
medullaris. Subdural hematoma centering at this level.

MR THORACIC SPINE  [**2180-4-14**] 12:30 PM
FINDINGS: In agreement with the lumbar spine MRI, there is a
fracture of the L1 vertebral body with retropulsion of fracture
fragments posteriorly and compression of the conus medullaris.
There is a right disk protrusion at T9-10, but no cord
compression at this level.
The remainder of the vertebral bodies within the thoracic spine
have normal signal intensity and alignment.
IMPRESSION: As described in detail on the lumbar spine MRI,
there is a L1 vertebral body fracture with retropulsion of the
fracture fragments and compression of the conus medullaris.


Brief Hospital Course:
TSICU [**2180-4-14**] to [**2180-4-18**]: After initial exam, survey, and
stabilization in the trauma bay, the patient was taken for CT
scan and x-ray evaluation of his injuries. His head and cspine
CT were negative for hemorrhage or fracture. The patient's
chest/abd/pelvis CT revealed hemoperitoneum surrounding the
small bowel mesentery, a small right-sided pneumothorax, burst
fracture of the L1 vertebral body with extension into the
right-sided posterior elements and involving the facet joint and
approximately 50% retropulsion of several vertebral body
fragments into the spinal canal, impinging and compressing the
spinal cord at this level, a comminuted, displaced right
intratrochanteric fracture, subtle nondisplaced 4th right,
posterior rib fracture. The patient was taken to the OR where he
had an expolartory laparotomy with resection of his small bowel
as well as placement of a right chest tube.
On [**4-15**] the patient was taken by orthopaedics to the OR for an
ORIF of his right femur. In the OR a retrievible IVC filter was
placed.
