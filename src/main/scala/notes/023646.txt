Chief Complaint:
sent from clinic for finding of rapid heart rate

Cardiac Catheterization
Temporary Pacemaker Wire Placement
Permanent Dual-chamber Pacemaker Placement


History of Present Illness:
This is an 86 year old woman w/ h/o Afib, SSS, CHF, HCM w/
dynamic LVOT gradient, schizoaffective d/o, who presented on
this admission [**2150-3-11**] from PCP's office in rapid heart rate (up
to the 150's). Of note, she was recently hospitalizated at [**Hospital1 18**]
in [**1-21**] with pneumonia, CHF, and NSTEMI, then discharged from
rehab to [**Hospital3 **] where she has been since. Pacemaker was
considered on her last admission for SSS, but given her
pulmonary status at that point it was deferred. Prior to this
admission, she c/o dyspnea on exertion which is the reason for
her presentation to clinic. She denied having any chest pain.
PCP note from the day of admission also mentioned that she was
agitated overnight with visual hallucinations.
.
On presentation to the ED, she was found to be in rapid A
flutter w/ 2:1 conduction at 150. She was given Dilt 5mg IV x 1
with good response. This brought her HR down to 70's, still w/ A
flutter w/ variable block. Trop was noted to be positive at
0.48. No new ischemic EKG changes. Cardiology fellow was called
and she was given ASA 81mg x1 and lipitor 80mg x1. CXR without
infiltrates. Her INR was found to be supertherapeutic at 8.4,
but was guaiac negative.
.
After admission to the floor, the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was
initially complicated by epistaxis requiring FFP and vitamin K.
Hemostasis achieved with nasal packing. She then triggered for
an episode of respiratory distress on the morning of [**2150-3-12**],
which was likely flash pulmonary edema [**1-16**] to volume with FFP.
She responded well to lasix. Eventually she received 1 unit
PRBCs for drop in Hct after episode of epistaxis.
.
Furthermore, overnight on [**2150-3-13**], the patient went into
polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in the setting of prolonged
QTc at which point she reportedly maintained her blood pressure
but was "unresponsive." She broke on her own prior to
cardioversion. The patient was noted to have significant
bradycardia to the 30's, up to 2 second pauses, and prolonged
QTc around the time of VT onset. After discussion with EP,
Isoproteronol was started and the patient was transferred to the
CCU for further management.
.
On the morning of [**2150-3-13**], the patient was taken for cardiac
catheterization which revealed a totally occluded RCA, and a
highly calcifed LAD with a 99% stenosis at the take off of the
diagonal. LAD s/p POBA, no stent placed. During the procedure,
the patient had sustained ventricular tachycardia with
hemodynamic collapse after injection of the LMCA. She was
sucessfully DC cardioverted out of VT with 200 Joules during the
procedure. A temporary pacer was then placed and the patient was
monitored in the CCU until a permanent pacemaker could be
placed. On [**2150-3-16**], a dual chamber Mettronic EnRhythm PM was
placed via L subclavian.
.
The patient is now being transferred out of the CCU for further
observation. Currently, she is feeling well and denies CP, or
SOB.
.

CT HEAD [**2150-3-11**]:
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. Chronic
microvascular infarction as before.
.
CXR [**2150-3-11**]: Stable cardiomegaly, without overt CHF or
pneumonia.
.
CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION [**2150-3-13**]:
1.  Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
revealed three vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had
minimal ostial disease.  The LAD was a highly calcifed vessel
with a 99% stenosis at the take off of the diagonal.  The
diagonal branch had a 70% stenosis.  There was an 805 stenosis
in the apical LAD.  The LCx was widely patent and highly
calcified.  The RCA was totally occluded at the ostium and
filled via collaterals from the conus medullaris.
2.  Left ventriculography was deferred because it was assessed
noninvasively.
3.  Resting hemodynamics demonstrated an elevated RVEDP and
LVEDP of 15 and 24 mmHg, respectively.  There was pulmonary
arterial hypertension with a pulmonary artery pressure of 65/30
mmHg.  The aortic valve was not crossed.  Cardiac output was not
calculated.
4.  There was sustained ventricular tachycardia with hemodynamic
collapse upon injection of the LMCA follow by sucessful
defibrillation with 200 Joules.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Severe pulmonary hypertension.
.
CXR [**2150-3-17**]: Standard position of the pacemaker leads.
