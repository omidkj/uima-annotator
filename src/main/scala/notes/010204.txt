CT Head [**2166-6-10**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral subdural hematoma, larger on the right, with sulcal
effacement on the right. No significant shift of normally
midline structures.
2. Subdural hematoma at the falx.
3. Soft tissue hematoma at the left frontal bone.
4. No definite fracture is seen

CT Cervical spine [**2166-6-10**]
IMPRESSION: No sign of a definite fracture or abnormal
alignment.

CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis [**2166-6-10**]
 IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of active extravasation into the mesentery.
Thickening of the bowel wall in the ileum and stranding in
adjacent mesentery may represent hemorrhage into the bowel wall.
This is not significantly changed from earlier the same date.
Free fluid around the liver and in the pelvis is similar. Fluid
in the left upper quadrant is new surrounding the descending
colon in the splenic flexure.
2. Multiple rib fractures.
3. Small lung contusion in the right middle lobe. Trace
atelectasis at the
lung bases.


Video swallow [**6-24**]:
INDICATION: A 61-year-old man status post trauma with
aspiration. Evaluate
for aspiration.

COMPARISON: Video oropharyngeal swallow study from [**2166-6-18**].

SWALLOWING VIDEOFLUOROSCOPY: Oropharyngeal swallowing
videofluoroscopy was
performed in conjunction with speech and swallow division.
Multiple
consistencies of barium were administered. Barium passed freely
through the
oropharynx and the esophagus without evidence of obstruction.
However, there
was frank aspiration of nectar thick and pudding consistencies.
The
examination was terminated early due to aspiration.

IMPRESSION: Frank aspiration. For further details, please refer
to speech
and swallow division note in OMR.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.


Neurophysiology Report EEG Study Date of [**2166-6-12**]



OBJECT: SEIZURES.


REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **]. [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]


FINDINGS:
BACKGROUND: Was generally of low voltage and sometimes fast. No
clear
alpha patterns emerged.
HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Could not be performed.
SLEEP: Most of the record was performed in drowsiness. No normal
sleep
patterns were evident.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular tachycardia with a
rate of
approximately 110.
IMPRESSION: Largely normal EEG for drowsiness. There were no
areas of
prominent focal slowing, and there were no clear epileptiform
features.
A tachycardia was noted. The excessive drowsiness may also
represent a
mild encephalopathy.

CT Torso [**6-18**]:
INDICATION: 51-year-old man with new fevers, diarrhea and
abdominal pain.

Comparison is made to the prior study of [**2166-6-10**].

TECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT images of the abdomen and pelvis were
obtained after
administration of 100 ml of Optiray intravenously. Sagittal and
coronal
reformatted images were then obtained.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: New consolidative changes of
the left
lung base. Atelectasis of right lung base. Small left pleural
effusion is
visualized.

The liver, gallbladder, adrenal glands, spleen, pancreas,
stomach, duodenum
and loops of small bowel and large bowel have normal appearance.
The
previously noted thickened small bowel loops has been removed.
Both kidneys
contain multiple small hypodense lesions which are too small to
characterize.
Simple cyst is arising from the lower pole of the right kidney
measuring 3.6 x
3.7 cm. Incidental note is made of fluid-containing left
inguinal hernia.

No free air or fluid is noted within the abdomen. Small amount
of air is
noted in the left paracardiac region above the diaphragm, most
likely
postsurgical. A 20 x 19 mm lymph node is noted within the
mesentery, seen on
series 2, image 48, which is most likely inflammatory in origin.
NG tube
distal tip is noted within the stomach.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Urinary bladder contains a
Foley catheter.
The left distal ureter has normal jet. The right distal ureter
is not well
opacified. Mild rectal wall thickening is noted.

BONE WINDOWS: No concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions are
identified.

IMPRESSION:
1. Status post exploratory laparotomy with segmental enterectomy
and
resolution of intraperitoneal hemorrhage.
2. New consolidative changes of the left lung base.
Differentials include
pneumonia and aspiration. Small left pleural effusion.
3. Fluid-containing left inguinal hernia.
4. Equivocal rectal wall thickening. Diferentials include
infectious and
inflammatory etiologies.




Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Trauma Service and transferred to the
Trauma ICU. He developed a tension pneumothorax thought to be
secondary to central line placement and required a right chest
tube to be placed.

Neurosurgery and Neurology were consulted initially. His
subdural hemorrhages were managed non operatively; serial head
CT  scans were followed and remained stable. Keppra was added to
his seizure regimen. Neurology also evaluated patient given his
seizure history; they recommended an EEG and to hold Keppra
unless had further seizures. He was noted with seizures while in
the ICU and his Depakote levels were checked which were low; his
dose was adjusted.

A Dobbhoff tube was placed and tube feeding were initiated. He
would later remove the Dobbhoff on several occasions only to be
replaced.

He remained in the Trauma ICU for several days and was
eventually extubated and transferred to the regular nursing
unit. On [**6-15**] he experienced a respiratory decompensation, became
tachycardic and was acutely agitated pulling his chest tube
which required transfer back to the ICU. His chest tube was
replaced, the leak that he had with previous chest tube
persisted with the new one. Thoracic surgery became involved and
serial chest xrays were followed. The chest tube was eventually
removed and sputum culture came back positive for Klebsiella
pneumonia and he was started on Vancomycin, Cipro and Zosyn.
Several days later he was noted with high liquid stool outpu
