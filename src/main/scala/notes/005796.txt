Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Decreased exercise tolerance

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2178-10-9**] Mitral valve replacement with a [**Street Address(2) 17009**]. [**Hospital 923**] Medical
   mechanical valve and Tricuspid valve repair with a 26-mm
Contour annuloplasty ring.

History of Present Illness:
64 year old female with known rheumatic disease and mitral
stenosis and regurgitation which has been followed with serial
echocardiograms. She has noted a gradual decrease in exercise
tolerance, particularly over the
past year. She does continue to walk up to two miles on most
days at a moderate pace. However, she notes that with any uphill
walking, she does become short of breath. In addition, she also
notes this with climbing more than one flight of stairs or when
carrying her grandson. Recent echocardiogram on [**7-30**] showed mild
mitral stenosis and moderate mitral regurgitation with
thickened/deformed leaflets characteristic of rheumatic
deformity. She was recently evaluated for ballon valvuloplasty
however this was deferred given the amount of mitral
regurgitation that she had. Given the progression of her
symptoms and severity of her disease, she has been referred for
surgical management.

Mitral stenosis and regurgitation
Hypertension

Pertinent Results:
ECHO [**2178-10-9**]:
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Mild
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left
atrial appendage. No thrombus is seen in the left atrial
appendage. The right atrium is dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve shows
characteristic rheumatic deformity. There is mild valvular
mitral stenosis (area 1.5-2.0cm2). Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate to (2+) tricuspid regurgitation
is seen. The tricuspid regurgitation jet is eccentric and may be
underestimated. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
was notified in person of the results prior to incision.
POST-BYPASS: Preserved biventricular systolic function. The
prosthesis in the tricuspid position is stable and functioning
well. The mitral bioprosthesis is well seated and functioning
well and mean transmitral gradient is 3 mm of Hg. Intact
thoracic aorta.
.
Chest x-ray [**2178-10-13**]: Small bilateral/pleural effusions are
probably unchanged since [**10-11**].  Left lower lobe
atelectasis is mild, substantially improved. There is no
pulmonary vascular engorgement or pulmonary edema. Borderline
cardiomegaly is comparable to the preoperative appearance, but
the left atrium is no longer as dilated. No pneumothorax.
Left PICC line ends low in the SVC.
.
EKG
Normal sinus rhythm. J point elevation in leads II, III, aVF and
V5-V6.
Small non-diagnostic Q waves in leads II, III and aVF. There is
Wenckebach
block. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2178-10-9**] the
Wenckebach, Mobitz I heart block is new. Otherwise, no
diagnostic interval change.

Brief Hospital Course:
Same day admission and was brought to the operating room where
she underwent a Mitral valve replacement with a [**Street Address(2) 17009**]. [**Hospital 923**]
Medical mechanical valve and Tricuspid valve repair with a 26-mm
Contour annuloplasty ring. See operative report for further
details. Post operatively she was admitted to the ICU intubated
and sedated on pressor support for hypotension. She awoke
neurologically intact, was weaned from the ventilator and
extubated. Pressors were weaned off. Chest tubes and pacing
wires were discontiued per protocol. She was started on coumadin
for mechanical mitral valve with heparin bridge. Betablockers
were initiated then stopped due to hypotension. She additionally
had short burst of atrial fibrillation and flutter that
converted without intervention. Her betablockers were slowly
restarted and she continued to progress and remained in normal
sinus rhythm.   Physical therapy worked with her on strength and
mobility. She continued to progress and was ready for discharge
to home on post operative day six
