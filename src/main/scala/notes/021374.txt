Rec'd combivent nebs, steroids. Pt. w/ some improvement on nebs,

muscle use

expiratory rhonchi, no crackles, decreased bs at bases

ABD: sl. distended, soft, NTND +bs
EXT: 2+ pulses, no C/C/E

sensation grossly


Pertinent Results:
Portable CXR [**2-8**]: A small right pleural effusion has decreased.
Small bilateral pleural effusions persist. Mild opacification at
the lung bases is probably atelectasis. Upper lungs clear. No
pulmonary edema. Heart size normal.
.
Echo [**2-2**]: There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. There is
mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
This 82 year old gentleman with COPD and CAD, and TIA's
presented with progressive dyspnea over several weeks was
admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and need for continuous nebs.
Given wheezes and history of smoking, this was believed to be
secondary to COPD exacerbation. In addition, there was evidence
of bilateral opacities on chest X-ray suggesting a concurrent
pneumonia and pt was initially covered broadly.  He was ruled
out for MI and pulmonary embolus disease.

#hypoxia/PNA: On HD 3 the patient was found to be hypercarbic
with pCO2 of 83 and was therefore intubated.  His respiratory
function improved and he was extubated on HD 5  Sputum culture
revealed strep pneumonia and antibiotic coverage was narrowed to
levofloxacin.

After extubation, the patient had a persistently high oxygen
requirement requiring face mask with nasal cannula.  He was
weaned off face mask but continued to require 6 L nasal cannula
to maintain oxygen saturations at 88-92% (which is baseline per
patient).  When attempts were made to increase o2 saturatino, he
became hypercarbic, so the goal was made to keep his sats in the
88-92% range.  He was not in respiratory distress after
extubation.  He was transferred on HD 8 to the floor.

He was continued on nebs around the clock and required 6L NC or
35% FM intitially, with continued desats on ambulation with PT.
Over his five day stay on the floor, his lung exam improved and
his oxygenation status improved such that he could tolerate 4L
o2 while ambulating with desats onlt to 85% on discharge. We
strongly recommended pulmonary rehab, but patient repeatedly
refused.  Through this time, we continued levofloxacin and
discharged him with a prescription to take him through a full 14
day course.
.
He was discharged home with home oxygen, albuterol nebulizers
and tiotroprium, salmeterol, fluticasone
.
# Cardiac:
Pt. also had elevated trops with flat CK in context of
hypovolemic ARF, which has now resolved to baseline. Also had a
brief run of sinus arrest and junctional escape (several
seconds), so cardiology recommended avoid nodal agents for BP
control and pt. was started on lisinopril. Had Echo showing
moderate LVH, normal EF, moderate RV dilitation, hypertrophy,
and mild hypokinesis.

We started asa, continued lipitor and initially started ACE-I,
which he initially tolerated in ICU, but had to be titrated down
due to hypotension on the floor.  We ended up discontinuing it,
with plans to readress whether his blood pressures could
tolerate ACE-I as an outpatient.  Of not he was asymptomatic
during these episodes of hypotension to systolics in the 90s.
.
# Volume overload:
He also was aggressively volume resuscitated resulting in a max
of 12L positive in ICU, after which he has been aggressively
diuresed with lasix.   He responded nicely with no need for
further diuretics upon discharge
.
#CRI- baseline 1.0, admission 1.7. likely elevated in the
setting of infection.
--Resolved with fluids, clearing of infection
.
