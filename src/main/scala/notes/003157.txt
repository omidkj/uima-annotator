shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
54 y/o M with a PMHx of COPD, 60 pack year tob hx, and
schizophrenia presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with progressive SOB and
dyspnea. Pt states that his sx's initially began 2 weeks ago and
have steadily worsened. He admits to a dry cough, with
subjective fevers, but no documented elevated temperature. No
prod cough or sputum production. No sick contacts. [**Name (NI) **] denies any
PND, orthopnea, or LE edema. His sx's worsened to the point
where he was having difficulty breathing at rest and he called
EMS. He was found to be breathing in the 40s and 90% on RA. He
was given a Combivent neb en route and brought to [**Hospital1 **].
.
In the ED, he received Solumedrol 125mg IV x1, Levaquin 750mg IV
x1, Albuterol nebs x2, Combivent nebs x1 and was initially

intubated. CXRs did not demonstrate any consolidation but f/u CT
demonstrated emphysematous lung with areas of ground glass
opacity and focal nodularity.

EKG [**7-15**]: NSR 97. +LAD, nml intervals. No ST elevations/

Imaging:
.
CTA Chest [**7-18**]:
1) No pulmonary embolism is identified. No pulmonary infarction
is noted.
2) Multiple non-pathologically enlarged nodes are noted within
the
mediastinum.
3) Multiple illdefined areas of ground glass opacity are
scattered in all lobes of both lungs. Additional scattered small
nodular densities are present. Overall findings are nonspecific.
Differential diagnoses include inflammatory/infectious process,
COP (cryptogenic organizing pneumonia), eosinophilic pneumonias
. Correlate clinically, with lab data and follow up

LE Venous Dopplers [**7-18**]
FINDINGS: Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of bilateral common
femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal, and calf veins were
performed. There is normal compressibility, flow, and

Brief Hospital Course:
54 y/o M with a PMHx of COPD, schizophrenia presented to [**Hospital1 18**]
with progressive SOB and dyspnea x 2 weeks, a/w subj.
fevers/sweats/diarrhea. This is likely due a COPD exacerbation
brought on by a mild infection.
.
1. COPD exacerbation
 The patient's shortness of breath and dyspnea were felt to be
due to a COPD exacerbation, given the history of subjective
fevers/chills and diarrhea. In the MICU he was placed on
steroids (solumedrol), antibiotics (azithro), nebulizers, and
supplemental oxygen. He responded quite well and never required
intubation, just BIPAP. Over the course of his MICU stay he was
weaned off of BIPAP until stable to come to the floor, where he
continued to improve on this regimen. He was continued on
azithromycin throughout his stay, and we was switch to po
prednisone with an oupatient taper planned. He benefitted from
nebulizer treatments and as such he was provided with a
nebulizer machine for his home, as well as instruction on its
use and prescriptions for nebs. His oxygen saturation on RA
ranged in the 92% range, which, given his extensive smoking
history, was presumed to be near his baseline. His symptoms and
pulmonary exam improved throughout his stay, and after passing
PT evaluation for stair climbing (lives in a walk-up) he was
cleared for discharge.
.
2. Elevated CK
Patient presented with elevated CK, unclear etiology, was likely
mild rhabdo. Responded well to aggressive IVF, and trended down
nicely over course of admission. On discharge it was in the
100s.  He had an EKG and biomarkers which were negative for
cardiac ischemia.
.
3. Hyponatremia
Was 121 on admission, resolved to 136 at best during
hospitalization, but dropped just before discharge to 126.
Euvolemic exam. Proposed etiologies include SIADH given his
extensive lung disease and CT findings, hypothyroid (TSH was
normal), HCTZ (held), and other medication related. Patient was
discharged with instructions to repeat his sodium as an
outpatient lab 2-3 days after discharge.  This information was
communicated to his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to ensure proper follow-up,
the patient has an appt with his PCP scheduled within 2 weeks of
discharge.
.
4. Schizophrenia
We continued his Abilify and Paxil home regimen. Remained well
controlled on meds. No A/V hallucinations during stay.
.
5. Ground Glass Opacities on CT
 The differential diagnosis for these findings on CT is broad
and includes inflammatory/infectious process, COP (cryptogenic
organizing pneumonia), eosinophilic pneumonia (unlikely givne
lack of eos). As the treatment for many of these conditions is
steroids, he was kept on a slow steroid taper as per pulmonary
guidance in the ICU and has a f/u appt with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from
pulm on [**8-18**] at 4PM
.
6. Elevated Blood Glucose + Leukocytosis
These effects were likely [**2-25**] steroids. He displayed no clinical
signs of infection   and had no history of diabetes. His WBC
count was trending back towards near normal by discharge. His
finsgersticks were managed with sliding scale insulin.
.
HTN - no prior diagnosis, but was hypertensive in the MICU. HCTZ
was begun, but BP remained still elevated on floor. We d/c'ed
his HCTZ given concerns about hyponatremia, and added amlodipine
5mg daily and lisinopril 10 mg daily with better BP control.
.
FEN: He ate a cardiac diet and did not require additional IVF on
the floor. His electrolytes were repleted prn. For DVT
prophylaxis, he was given Heparin sQ. He was maintained as full
code.
