Skin: Unremarkable
HEENT: Unremarkable

Heart: Regular rate and rhythm with 2/6 systolic murmur

Ext: Warm, well-perfused, -edema, mild varicosities
Neuro: Grossly intact

Pertinent Results:
[**4-12**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: 1. The left atrium is markedly dilated.
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. The right atrium is moderately dilated. 2. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. 3. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. 4. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). 5. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. 6. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. 7. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9 cm2). Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. 8. The mitral valve shows
characteristic rheumatic deformity. The mitral valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. There is moderate valvular mitral
stenosis (area 1.0-1.5cm2). Mitral stenosis may be slightly
underestimated by P1/2 time due to AI. Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. 9. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened POST-BYPASS: 1. A well-seated bioprosthetic
valve is seen in the mitral position with normal leaflet motion
and gradients (mean gradient = 2-3 mmHg). No mitral
regurgitation is seen. 2. Regional and global left ventricular
systolic function are normal. 3. Aortic contours smooth post
decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 31674**] was admitted prior to surgery for cardiac cath, IV
Heparin, and usual pre-operative work-up. She was planned to
have cardiac cath on [**4-10**] but INR was elevated. INR trended down
and she was brought for a cardiac cath on [**4-11**]. On [**4-12**] she was
brought to the operating room where she underwent a mitral valve
replacement and MAZE procedure. Please see operative report for
surgical details. Following surgery she was transferred to the
CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. On
post-operative day one she was being weaned from sedation, but
patient self extubated herself. Chest tubes and epicardial
pacing wires were removed per protocol. On post-op day three she
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further care. On
post-op day four Coumadin was restarted.  By post-operative day
5 she was discharged to her daughter's home.
