dyspnea at rest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
80 year old female with COPD on home 2L, HTN, recurrent anemia,
diastolic CHF who presents with progressive dyspnea.  She was
discharged from [**Hospital1 112**] 7 days PTA for COPD and CHF, where she was
treated with blood transfusions, steroids and diuresis. Since
discharge her dyspnea has progressively worsened.  She states
that it is exacerbated by activity and laying flat.  Symptoms
accompanied by cough with clear sputum for 1 day, palpitations,
and chest pressure associated with some gas.  No radiation to
extremities or jaw, diaphoresis.  Patient states that chest
pressure was present for many hours on admission,  consistent
with her baseline chest discomfort she has experienced for
years. Of note, the patient is on 2L home O2 at baseline, with
home O2 sat ranging from 92-95%.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 98.1, Pulse: 73, RR: 30, BP: 137/46.
 CXR revealed pulmonary edema.  Foley was placed and the patient
was given 40mg IV lasix, IV solumedrol, and levofloxacin.  She
was placed on a BIPAP.  On arrival to the MICU, patient was
satting 96% 40% BIPAP.

CXR [**2103-11-23**]:
FINDINGS: Single AP upright portable view of the chest was
obtained.  Diffuse alveolar opacities throughout the lungs,
right greater than left, which could represent asymmetric edema
and/or infection. Slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle
may be due to trace pleural effusion. The patient is status post
median sternotomy. The cardiac silhouette is top normal. The
aorta is calcified.
.
IMPRESSION: Diffuse bilateral, right much greater than left
alveolar opacities could relate to asymmetric edema and/or
infection. Correlate clinically and consider repeat after
diuresis. Comparison with prior radiographs would be helpful.
.
ECHO [**2103-11-26**]:  The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal
defect. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
normal free wall contractility. The diameters of aorta at the
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe ([**12-21**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
80 year old female with COPD, HTN, recurrent anemia, diastolic
CHF who was admitted for dyspnea and anemia.
.
#Dyspnea- The patient was admitted to the MICU with hypoxia to
the 70%s on room air.  She briefly required non-invasive
ventilation. She was covered for a possible COPD exacerbation
with nebs, prednisone and azithromycin (antibiotic course
completed).  She also was started on a lasix and nitro drip for
acute on chronic diastolic CHF (EF 60%).  Chest X-ray revealed
bilateral pulmonary opacities with pulmonary edema.  The patient
diuresed well and dyspnea improved, making acute on chronic
diastolic CHF the chief diagnosis.  The patient underwent a
transthoracic echo that showed moderate to severe MR worsened
since [**9-/2103**], which may be contributing to CHF exacerbation.
Cardiac enzymes were negative X3 for ischemic cause of heart
failure exacerbation.  Prior to transfer to the floor, lasix and
nitro drips were discontinued.  The patient was started on
torsemide (in place of home lasix) and imdur.  She continued to
diurese well.  Her oxygenation improved.  At time of discharge,
the patient was saturating well on 3L O2.  She was discharged on
torsemide for diuresis and a prednisone taper.
.
#Anemia- Patient has a history of significant anemia, with acute
decrease in HCT on admission from 30 to 21. Stools guaiac
negative.  Patient was transfused 1 unit PRBCs. Hematocrit
stabilized at 25 for the remainder of admission.  Etiology of
anemia likely multifactorial, secondary to CKD, repeated
phlebotomy.  Stools remained guaiac negative throughout
admission.
.
#Acute on chronic kidney injury - Baseline creatinine is 1.5-2.0
over the past few months.  With diuresis, creatinine increased
to 2.4-2.6 daily.  The patient should follow up regarding her
creatinine within a week of discharge.
.
#Chronic Angina/CAD- Chronic angina has been controlled on
ranolazine and isosorbide mononitrate. Stress test in [**10/2103**]
revealed reversible inferior defect on nuclear imaging.  Patient
remained chest pain free throughout admission.  The patient was
continued on atorvastatin, ASA, hydralazine and imdur.  Ranexa
was discontinued due to acute kidney injury.  The patient should
follow up with her cardiologist about rein
