Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1436**]
Chief Complaint:
Hemmorhagic Gastritis
Congestive Heart Failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**First Name3 (LF) **]
Colonoscopy


History of Present Illness:
66 Year Old Male with PMHx of CAD s/p ICD placement in [**2158**],
metallic Aortic Valve Replacement, s/p MI, CVAx4 who presents
with acute hematocrit drop due to hemmorhagic gastritis. The
patient has had recurrent bleeding over the last 8 months, and
was just discharged from the MICU on [**2166-3-31**] after episodes of
melena and hypotension. The patient has had a total of 29 blood
transfusion since [**2164-10-30**] due to this.

He has been on warfarin since [**2158**] and had only been having
problems since middle of last year. He said that he has had an
[**Year (4 digits) **] recently and it did not show any source of bleeding.
He has not had a recent colonoscopy or capsule study. He has
been having increasing dyspnea and cough over the past week and
was started on a Z-pack empirically. He also has noticed some
increased weakness and black stool over the past week.

In the ED his vitals were HR: 91, BP: 95/52, RR: 29, 98% RA,
guaiac positive stool. lasix 20mg IV x1 and tranfused 2 units of
pRBC. He was then transferred to the floor for further
management.

Past Medical History:
- CVA x 4 (most recent [**7-9**] while on warfarin, ASA and plavix -
though this CVA was not proven on MRI; last MRI in '[**59**] showed
microvascular disease but no signs of embolic stroke)
- Benign Hypertension
- CAD - single vessel distal LAD
- MI - in [**2164**], 3 stents unknown type unknown date

- Diastolic CHF - preserved EF, diastolic
- AVR - Mechanical valve [**2159-3-31**]

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2166-4-4**] 4:52 PM
IMPRESSION:
Mild congestive heart failure with small bilateral pleural
effusions and
bibasilar airspace opacities, likely atelectasis. Infection,
however, is not completely excluded.

EKG: NSR@90, QTc 456, Q II, AVF, V4-V6, Flattened ST V5-6

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2166-4-22**]
Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The distal septum may be hypokinetic. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present and
appears well-seated. The transaortic gradient is normal for this
prosthesis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. Tricuspid regurgitation is seen (views suboptimal for
quantification). There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There
is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2166-2-13**], findings are similar.

EGD [**2166-4-15**]
Findings:
Esophagus: Normal esophagus.
Stomach:
 Mucosa: Abnormal vascularity of the mucosa was noted in the
antrum and stomach body. These findings are compatible with
AVM's. No active bleeding. Other Gastritis resolved
Duodenum: Normal duodenum.
Impression: Gastric AVM's
No blood/active bleeding in upper GI tract. Otherwise normal EGD
to third part of the duodenum.
Recommendations: Follow up with in-patient GI team
Additional notes: FINAL DIAGNOSES are listed in the impression
section above. Estimated blood loss = zero. No specimens were
taken for pathology. Patient's home medication list was
reconciled.

Colonoscopy [**2166-4-15**]
Findings: Excavated Lesions Multiple diverticula were seen in
the sigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse colon, ascending
colon and cecum. Diverticulosis was severe but no active
bleeding from diverticulum.
 Other No active bleeding/blood in the colon
Impression: Colonic Diverticulosis. No active bleeding/blood in
the colon. Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum
Recommendations: Follow up with inpatient GI team
Additional notes: FINAL DIAGNOSES are listed in the impression
section above. Estimated blood loss = zero. No specimens were
taken for pathology Patient's home medication list was
reconciled


Brief Hospital Course:
65yoM with h/o chronic diastolic CHF (EF > 55%), NYHA Class III,
CAD w/ RCA stent and distal LAD occlusion w/ apical akinesis,
s/p AVR on warfarin, DM, HTN, CVA, and with gastritis and
gastric AVMs who was initially admitted on [**2166-4-4**] for GIB c/b
CHF exacerbation, transferred to the CCU for hypotension in
setting of diuresis, called out to [**Hospital1 **] [**2166-5-4**].
.
1. Chronic Blood Loss Anemia due to Gastrointestinal Bleeding:
Patient presented with a hct drop of 10.  He has been admitted
multiple times for recurrent hemorrhagic gastritis.  His INR on
admission was 2.8.  His coumadin was stopped and he was
monitored while waiting for his INR to trend down for possible
EGD.  Surgery was also consulted for possible gastrectomy given
these recurrent episodes and recommended biopsies to rule out
malignancy.  A heparin drip was started once his INR was below
2.5 gi
