Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2006**]
Chief Complaint:
Bloody diarrhea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
exploratory laparoscopy
intubation
hemodialysis

History of Present Illness:
(Initial presentation to hospital per Transplant [**Doctor First Name **]):
47F with ESRD on HD s/p right arm AV Graft on [**2101-8-31**] now
presenting with a one day history of profuse diarrhea, nausea,
vomiting and crampy abdominal pain. Patient reports feeling well
until yesterday when she started having large volume diarrhea
which was watery and bloody in consistency. She states she has
also had several episodes of nausea and vomiting. This has also
been associated with lower abdominal pain. Pain is crampy and
intermittent in nature. She also notes increasing erythema and
pain in her lower right arm which has been progressing over the
last 2-3 days.
.
Upon transfer to medicine service:
47 yo F w/ h/o End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on Hemodialysis
(HD), Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Hypertension (HTN), Schizophrenia,
Hypothyroid dz p/w abdominal pain, watery/bloody diarrhea [**9-15**]
from rehab, CT scan w/ evidence of colitis and portal venous air
and wbc 20s on labs. Pt admitted to surgical survice, and taken
to OR [**9-16**] for exploratory lap, notable for colitis but no
ischemic bowel. She was started on broad spec abx (vanc, cipro,
flagyl). Post op she was transferred to the floor. During
admission, psych meds (clozaril/lamictal) had been held and then
restarted post-operatively. After restarting these medications
patient had a witnessed seizure and was intubated for airway
protection. Neuro was consulted. MRI was wnl. EEG showed
moderate diffuse encephalopathy still with focal features and
occasional interictal epileptiform activity. Chest CT showed
opacification of LL atalectasis vs consolidation (intubation c/b
right main stem intubation), and abx switched to vanc/cefepime
for Hospital-acquired pneumonia treatment. At this time, patient
denies all pains or shortness of breath.

DISCHARGE LAB:
===========================================
IMAGING:
ECG - [**2101-9-15**]: Sinus rhythm at upper limits of normal rate. Mild
J point and ST segment elevation in the inferior leads. P-R
interval prolongation. No previous tracing available for
comparison. Clinical correlation is suggested.
[**2101-9-19**]: Sinus rhythm. Intra-atrial conduction delay. Cannot
exclude inferior myocardial infarction of indeterminate age.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2101-9-15**] the rate is slower.
[**2101-9-25**]: Sinus rhythm. Poor R wave progression. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2101-9-19**] there is loss of precordial R wave
which could be due to lead placement.
.
CXR [**2101-9-15**]: Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
.
CT abdomen/pelvis [**2101-9-15**]: 1. Circumferential wall thickening
involving a long segment of colon spanning from the hepatic
flexure to the proximal descending colon with mild surrounding
fat stranding thought most likely to be infectious/inflammatory
in etiology given the long distribution involved rather than
ischemic.
2. Small amount of portal venous in segment IV of the liver.
Etiology is uncertain, but unlikely to be from ischemic bowel
given the lack of pneumatosis or main portal or superior
mesenteric venous air, as well as the fact that the colonic
abnormalities span two vascular territories. Portal venous air
may be seen with infectious/inflammatory causes.
3. Left femoral dialysis catheter ends in the upper IVC.
4. Trace left pleural effusion versus small amount of
atelectasis.
.
CT head [**2101-9-18**]: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or
mass effect. A few hypodense foci in the right frontal lobe are
indetemriante. Correlate clinically and with neuroexamn. to
decide on further workup. In addition, CT can be less sensitive
in the detection of early cerebral edema- correlate clinically.
.
CXR [**2101-9-19**]: Poorly placed ET tube. These findings were
discussed with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7741**] at 10:01 by telephone on
[**2101-9-19**].
.
CT torso [**2101-9-19**]: 1. Intubation of the right mainstem bronchus
with near complete atelectasis of the left lung. These findings
were discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at 9:00 a.m. via telephone.
2. Mild colon dilatation ( mainly the transverse and the
ascending colon )No signs of thickening of the colon or
intra-abdominal abscesses are identified. Still, non contrast CT
is not sensitive for detection of acute
bowel ischemia and this cannot be excluded.
3. Small portal venous gas is seen that has not enlarged in
comparison to
previous examination.
4. Small amount of free air is entrapped between the liver
capsule and the
diaphragm representing residual air post laparoscopy
.
EEG [**2101-9-20**]: This continuous recording revealed a moderately
severe to severe diffuse enceph
