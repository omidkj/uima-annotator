CXR: no acute cardiopulm dz

CT ABD/PELVIS: Small amount of nonspecific free fluid within the
pelvis and minimal right sided pleural effusion. Otherwise,
normal CT of the abdomen and pelvis.

CATH: a right dominant system with no angiographically apparent
flow limiting stenoses. The LMCA, LAD, and RCA had minimal
luminal irregularities. The patent LCX supplied 2 OMs. The
cardiac index was normal (3.5 l/min/m2). Left ventriculography
showed global hypokinesis (EF 40 to 45%) with no mitral
regurgitation.


Brief Hospital Course:
1) [**Name (NI) 75996**] Pt has a hx of Type II DM with no requirement of insulin
and was only on oral hypoglycemic [**Doctor Last Name 360**] previously.  Pt
presesnted to the OSH with DKA and was managed in the ICU with
insulin drip, fluid resuccitation, and electrolyte replacement.
[**Last Name (un) **] was following her and started the patient on insulin (15
units glargine qhs, and humalog ISS).  She may have a late onset
of Type I DM, or this could be secondary to pancreatitis with
beta cell dysfunction.  She will be discharged with insulin and
a follow up with [**Last Name (un) **].

2) GPC bacteremia- Pt presented with 1/1 bottle GPC +blood cx at
OSH.  It was most likely contaminant since it grew out staph.
epi at OSH. Vancomycin was initially started but discontinued
once repeat blood cultures were negative.

3) Pancreatitis-unclear diagnosis given relatively benign
presentation.  Enzymes elevated out of proportion to clinical
symptoms but trended down on it's own.  At OSH, triglycerides
and calcium were normal.  Pt has no history of alcohol abuse and
denies any recent binge. CT of the abdomen/pelvis were normal.
It only showed small amount of nonspecific free fluid within the
pelvis and minimal right sided pleural effusion.  Since pt had a
flu-like sx several days prior to these events, pancreatitis
could be from viral infection as well.

4) Systolic dysfunction- At OSH, TTE was ordered which showed EF
of 40%.  The repeat TTE showed EF of 35%, moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the
distal half of the septum and anterior walls and apex. The
remaining segments contract well. Right ventricular chamber size
is normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis consistent with
possible mid-LAD disease.  Pt was taken to cath which showed
clean coronaries.  Work up for cardiomyapathy including
SPEP/UPEP, iron studies, [**Doctor First Name **], rheumatoid factor, Lyme titer.
HIV study was not sent since she is does not have any risk
factor.  Given the hx of flu-like sx, it could be from viral
etiology such as coxsacke virus which could also cause
pancreatitis which may have led to DKA.  Pt should be seen by
Dr.[**Name (NI) 23312**] [**Hospital 1902**] clinic and should have a follow up echo in few
months.  Pt was discharged with Toprol 25 mg qd, lisinopril 2.5
mg qd, and ASA 81 mg qd.  Lisinopril was not titrated since sBP
runs in 80's-90's at baseline.

5)Hypothyroid: Pt's TSH and free T4 level were consistent with
hypothyroid.  She was continued on Synthroid 150 mcg po qd.

6)Spine mass:  Pt reports having painful spine bony protusion
for the last 2 years.  She says that the pain is intermittent
and is paraspinal.  On exam, she has a mass that is firm
consistent with bone, nontender to palpation that is at C5-C6
level.  She has never gotten a work up for this.  Pt should get
an outpatient MRI of the spine for further evaluation.
