PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
======================
-Hypereosinophilic syndrome and associated course:
Diagnosed in [**2190-6-20**] after presenting with transient ischemic

episode (with reported exotropia) and bilateral deep venous
thrombosis. He was treated was initially treated with
prednisone, but changed to hydroxyurea as his condition was
refractory. He had a one month long trial of imatinib 400 mg
daily in the winter of [**2194**], but did not have a response. He
continued on hydroxyurea until the summer of [**2195**] when he had
two hospitalizations, one with pneumonia and another with
multiple infarctions. The infarctions were of the right
parieto-occipital lobe and left parietal infarction with sudden
onset left
homonymous hemianopsia in [**Month (only) 205**]. He subsequently deteriorated,
with weight loss and fatigue. He was started on prednisone 60 mg

daily in [**2195-10-21**], then tapered to 20 mg daily and initiated

on Sorafenib. He was seen by BMT for possible allogeneic stem
cell transplant. Campath dose was increased to 2X/wk as
eosinophil count increased to 60%. Interferon 1.5mu 3x/wk was
started on on [**6-12**], increased to 4.5 million units three times a

week. Interferon was d/c'd on [**2196-8-25**].
.

[**2197-3-6**] CT Chest s/out:
IMPRESSION:
1. Severe, global peribronchial infiltration, more likely
infection
(pneumocystis or virus) or hemorrhage than Etoposide drug
reaction,
particularly because the latter is extremely rare.
2. Persistent anemia. Progressive mild cardiomegaly, particular
left
ventricular enlargement.
3. Granulomatous lymph node calcifications, probably due to
prior
histoplasmosis. That could be the pathogen for the slowly
resolving right
upper lobe cavity, which continues to involute very, very
slowly, but is not
the cause of the diffuse infection.
4. Distended gallbladder, tiny gallstones, no evidence of
cholecystitis.
5. Chronic severe splenomegaly.


[**2197-3-6**] CT HEAD w/out:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial abnormalities. However, MRI would be
more sensitive if there is concern for acute infarct.
2. Hypodensities in bilateral PCA and left MCA regions,
compatible with
chronic infarcts at these sites.
3. Age-related parenchymal atrophy.
4. Extensive paranasal sinus mucosal thickening.

[**2197-3-7**] TTE:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity
size are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with basal inferior mild dyskinesis and
more distal akinesis as well as akinesis of the distal lateral
wall. There is mild hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF
= 30%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The posterior
leaflet is relatively fixed/immobile. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Th
