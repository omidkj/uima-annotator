Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**]
Chief Complaint:
Aphasia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
64yo W RH who was transferred due to a stroke affecting the left
mca territory. The patient was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] due to acute renal failure, hyperkalemia and fluid
overload. Afib was also found and she was started on warfarin.
She was improving her renal function and about to be discharged
on 14/11, when she developed aphasia  and right side weakness at
1:40am, witnessed. Stroke team contact[**Name (NI) **] at about 12:40 since
INR>2 and therefore IAT considered since IV tPA contraindicated.
Unfortunately, despite having the angioroom and interventional
staff ready for a potential intervention, the weather did not
allow the staff to come safely, reason why her arrival was
delayed in hours.

Past Medical History:
Smoking/COPD
Afib recently diagnosed
"Mild CHF" as per OSH records
Recent AKF resultant of contrast exposure, with a creatinine
that
reached 3.4 as per records, with subsequent improvement
"Hilar adenopathy"
"History of pleural and pericardial calcifications


Social History:
Lives with her sister. Previous heavy smoker, currently "a few
per day", does not drink.


Family History:
Mother with advanced kidney disease, refuse dialysis, died
Father died with emphisema

ECG [**2152-12-25**]: Atrial fibrillation. Diffuse T wave flattening.

Imaging:

[**2152-12-25**] MRI/MRA:
There are multiple small foci of slow diffusion seen involving
the
left precentral gyrus, left centrum semiovale, left corona
radiata, left
periventricular parenchyma- medial aspect of left caudate and
part of the left insular cortex, suggestive of acute infarcts.
No abnormal susceptibility is seen on the gradient echo sequence
to suggest hemorrhage. No other diffusion abnormalities are
seen. There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, or mass
effect seen. Multiple scattered FLAIr hyperintense foci are
noted in the cerebral white matter, non-specific in appearance.
Ventricles and sulci are normal in size and contour. Major
intracranial flow voids appear normal.
Visualized paranasal sinuses, orbits and mastoid air cells are
unremarkable.

MRA BRAIN: A 3.9x5.9 mm multilobulated, saccular aneurysm is
seen arising at the right Middle Cerebral Artery bifurcation.
Bilateral internal carotid arteries, vertebral, basilar arteries
and their major branches are otherwise patent with no evidence
of focal flow limiting stenosis or occlusion.

IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple focal, small acute infarcts in left MCA territory,
likely
secondary to proximal embolic source. Correlate clinically

2. 3.9x5.9 mm sized multilobulated aneurysm at right MCA
bifurcation.
Consider Interventional neuroradiology consult.

[**2152-12-26**] Echo: The left atrium is dilated. (Transthoracic
echocardiography not adequate to assess for atrial thrombus,
particularly appendage thrombus). No atrial septal defect or
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast with maneuvers. The estimated right atrial pressure is
at least 15 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild to
moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = ~40 %).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

No cardiac source of embolus seen other than atrial
fibrillation.

[**2152-12-26**] CXR:
1. Extensive pleural thickening and pleural calcification in the
right
hemithorax with associated volume loss and pericardial
calcification, as seen on prior chest CT, most likely the
sequelae of prior pleuropericarditis.

2. Added opacity at the right lung base, which could represent
additional
pleural abnormality or atelectasis, though if there is concern
for pnuemonia, radiographic followup is recommended.

3. Mediastinal widening, likely reflecting adenopathy seen on
recent chest
CT.

[**2152-12-26**] Carotid Series:
Minimal homogeneous plaque is seen at the proximal left internal

carotid artery. The peak systolic velocity in the right internal
carotid
artery ranges from 68 to 100 cm/sec and in the left internal
carotid artery from 46 to 86 cm/sec. The peak systolic velocity
in the right common carotid artery is 61 cm/sec and the left
common carotid artery is 79 cm/sec.
Bilateral external carotid arteries are patent. There is
antegrade flow in
the bilateral vertebral arteries. The ICA/CCA ratio on the right
is 1.63 and on the left is 1.08.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of significant carotid artery stenosis
bilaterally.


Brief Hospital Course:
64yo woman with COPD and afib who developed an acute ischemic
stroke involving her left mca territory with aphasia
predominantly and mild right sided weakness. The clot probably
broke apart since no occlusion found. She was not a candidate or
iv tPA, IA tpa, or mechanical thrombectomy. MRI showed multiple
focal acute infarcts in left MCA territory, likely secondary to
proximal embolic source. MRA brain showed a 6 mm multilobulated
aneurysm at right MCA bifurcation. The likely source of the
stroke is cardioembolic from AF. MRA brain showed good flow in
the left ICA and intracranial vessels. She was started on IV
heparin drip and admitted to ICU. We restarted warfarin.
Atorvastatin 40 qd. Amiodarone restarted for history of RVR with
a few episodes of tachycardia [**12-26**]. Carotid doppler showed mild
plaque L ICA and bilateral tortuous ICAs. Echo showed mild to
moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = ~40 %) mild
AR/MR and mild pulmonary HTN no evidence of clot or PFO/ASD/VSD.
