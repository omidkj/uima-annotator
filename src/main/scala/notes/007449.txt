Allergies:

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1943**]
Chief Complaint:
Hemorrhoid pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right femoral central venous catheter
Intubation with mechanical ventilation

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 40yo female with a history of hypertension who initially
presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED the morning of [**4-10**] complaining of
worsening hemorrhoid pain with blood spotting on the toilet
paper after defacation this morning.  She has had hemorrhoids
for several years, but they became irreducible one week ago.
From Friday until admission, she refrained from eating or
drinking due to fear of having a painful bowel movement.  Her ED
vitals were: T 100.1, HR 136, BP 161/102, RR 18, O2 100%

Of note, she was found to have a lactate of 4.8 and potassium of
2.9, for which she was given 3L of normal saline and 80 mEq KCl.
 She had a bicarb level of 19 with an anion gap=25, and ABG
revealed pH=7.47.  Her lactate came down to 2.2 after fluids
were administered.  In addition, a urinalysis revealed [**12-30**]
WBCs and +nitrites, and she was started on 400mg IV
ciprofloxacin x 1.

On the floor, the patient continued to complain of rectal pain.
She reports that one week ago, she experienced an episode of
diarrhea after which her hemorrhoids prolapsed out of her anal
canal and could not be reduced.  She has not had food or drink
since Friday.  She also reports having a heavy, painful
menstrual period beginning one week ago which was very painful
with clots.

The patient denied any symptoms of urinary tract infection,
including dysuria, increased urgency/frequency, or changes in
color or smell of urine.  Her last UTI was at age 19.  She
denied fever/chills.

After spending 3 days on the floor, during which her hemorrhoids
pain improved slightly with use of lidocaine jelly applied
directly to the area.  She did become hypertensive to the
200s/130s and tachycardic to the 140s briefly; her hypertension
was reduced with Valium x 1, and her tachycardia and
hypertension eventually stabilized to BPs 150-160/90-110 and HR
100-120 with TID labetalol.  Her bacteriuria remained
asymptomatic.  She was written for a CIWA scale given her
history of heavy ethanol use, but she failed to activate the
scale during her stay.

On the night of [**4-12**], her roommated called the nurse when the
patient became unresponsive.  Nurses found the patient had bit
her tongue with bleeding, was unresponsive, and had decreased
HR.  A code blue was called, 6mg Ativan was pushed, and the pt
stopped seizing but then required Haldol for persistent
agitation.  A right femoral line was placed;
propofol/etomidate/succinylcholine were administered, and the
patient was intubated.  She was transferred to the SICU.  The
patient received a head CT and CXR, both of which were
unremarkable.

She was extubated on [**2141-4-13**] and prepared for transfer back to
[**Wardname 27095**].  Patient complained of a swollen tongue and sore throat
but denied SOB, nausea, or vomiting.  Of note, she was febrile
on transfer (temperature spiked ~4pm), but she denied symptoms
or chills.  She had one bowel movement of normal consistency
during the day.  Her hemorrhoid pain is much improved, as she
can now sit without significant discomfort.  She is currently
receiving Tux cream directly applied to the area.  Vital signs
on transfer were: T 101.3, HR 115, BP 149/99, RR 40, O2sat 96%
on RA.
