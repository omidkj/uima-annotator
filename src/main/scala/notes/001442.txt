Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2145**]
Chief Complaint:
ARF, Hyperkalemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
75 y.o. Spanish-speaking female c/ PMHx CHF (EF 20-25%), CAD,
CRI who presented to the ED after routine labs revealed ARF w/
creat. to 3.8 and K of 6.
.
In early [**Name (NI) **], pt. was restarted on Lisinopril, a medication
which has been held in the past because of hypotension and acute
renal failure. Labs drawn after initiating a second trial of
Lisinopril revealed the aforementioned renal compromise with
associated hyperkalemia. On discovering the hyperkalemia, the
lab called the patient at home and instructed the pt. to come to
the ED when the lab recognized the abnormalities. Pt admits to
some light-headedness before coming-in to hospital.
.
In the ED, patient was hypotensive to SBP 70s, but asymptomatic.
Persistently elevated creatinine and potassium were noted.
Hyperkalemia was treated [**Last Name (un) 22121**] Kayexalate, Insulin, glucose and
calcium. Pt. additionally received small IVF boluses with
improvement in SBP to her baseline of high 90s, low 100s.
Patient was then triaged to the ICU for closer overnight
monitoring while treating for ARF and hyperkalemia.
.
Patient's hypotension improved to systolic 90's in the MICU,
which is thought to be her baseline. She was tranferred to the
service for continued treatment of renal failure and associated
electrolyte changes in the setting of prior history of CHF.
.
On admission to the floor, patient denies poor PO intake or
increased ostomy output, denies nausea/vomiting, dysuria,
hematuria, SOB, CP, lightheadedness. She does note decreased
urine output over the last two weeks.
.
OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:
Baby ASA
Lisinopril ("for past two months")
MV


.
ROS negative for h/o stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis,
pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias,
joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She
denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional
buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were
negative.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

MEDICAL DECISION MAKING

[**2108-6-19**]: CXR No acute cardiopulmonary process.

ECG [**2108-1-9**]: Sinus rhythm
Ventricular premature complex
Nonspecific ST-T abnormalities
Since previous tracing of [**2108-1-2**], ventricular ectopy present
and ST-T wave changes appear slightly less prominent


Stress: TOTAL EXERCISE TIME:  4 % MAX HRT RATE ACHIEVED:  55
 INTERPRETATION: 74 yo woman (severe cardiomyopathy with LVEF ~
20%)
was referred for a CAD evaluation. The patient was administered
0.142
mg/kg/min of persantine over 4 minutes. No chest, back, neck or
arm
discomforts were reported by the patient during the procedure.
In the
presence of baseline ST-T wave abnls, no additional ECG changes
were
noted during the procedure. The rhythm was sinus with occasional
vea;
occasional isolated VPDs, rare ventricular couplets. In
addition, rare isolated APDs were noted. The hemodynamic
response to the persantine infusion was appropriate. Three min
post-MIBI, the patient received 125 mg aminophylline IV.

IMPRESSION: No anginal symptoms or ECG changes from baseline.
Nuclear
report sent separately.

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2107-7-1**] demonstrated:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with severe global hypokinesis. [Intrinsic
left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] . No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular
chamber size is mildly increased with free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Left ventricular cavity enlargement with severe
global hypokinesis. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2106**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

LABORATORY DATA:
See below.

.
INITIAL ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 75yo fem c/ PMH of HTN, CRI
presenting with hyperkalemia and hypotension likely secondary to
exacerbation of renal failure due to Lisinopril.
.
#. A on CRF:  Recent baseline creatinine around 1.2, currently
at 3-4. DDX includes ACE-I induced ARF esp. given reported prior
history. There is no clear h/o decreased PO intake or decreased
volume, and Feena <1. There is likewise no hx suggestive for
post-renal obstruction. Intrinsic causes include her recently
started ACE-I or simple hypotension.  U/A not suggestive of ATN.
-We have D/C'd the ACE-I and expect improving renal function.
-Support BP with gentle NS boluses if SBP < 85 and symptomatic
-QD potassium and creatinine
-QD lytes in setting of metabolic acidosis
-strict I/O's
-Renal u/s --> renal consult
-Avoid nephrotoxins (ie, contrast/NSAIDS)

.
#. Pump: CHF not an active issue, but EF = 20-25% ([**12-2**])
limits [**Female First Name (un) **] of fluid resuscitation for kidneys.
-strict I/O's
-If exacerbation of CHF, gentle diuresis with non-K sparing
diuretic only.

.
#.  Hyperkalemia: Likely 2dary to ARF as discussed above. K =
5.6 this AM --> 4.4 this pm, trending down s/p Kayexalate,
Insulin, glucose and Ca yesterday. Expect further resolution as
kidneys recover function s/p Ace-I d/c.
-Replicate hyperkalemic regimen if K > 6 (Kayexalate, Insulin,
Glucose, Ca).
-Continue tele
.
#
CAD: Non-contributory to complaint.
-con't ASA
-Atorvastatin 10 mg PO DAILY
-check lipid profile

.
#Hypotension: Likely 2dary to new ACE-I. There are no signs/sx's
of evolving infection. In setting of impaired renal function,
adequate BP is necessary for adequate renal perfusion.
Currently stable without evidence of evolving HTN s/p Ace-I d/c.
-small (250-500) NS bolus for low BP
.
#Non-gap Acidosis: Pt has bicarb of 16 on transfer. Likely
represents metabolic acidosis secondary to ARF as above. Expect
resolution as compromise resolves. Other possibilities include
diarrhea from Kayexalate, or dilutional effect from boluses of
NS.

#Anemia: Baseline crit = 28-32, currently at 28.5. Pt. appears
to be within baseline range, but will f/u with iron studies.
-f/u iron studies, B-12, Folate
.
#. FEN: Follow and replete electrolytes. Cardiac diet. No IVF at
present.
.
#. Access:  PIV
.
#. PPx:  PO diet.
.
#. Code:  Full
.
#. Dispo:  Pending good BP control off Ace-I and resolved
creatinine.  Hope for d/c in [**12-28**] days.
