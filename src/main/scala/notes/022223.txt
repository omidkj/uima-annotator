History of Present Illness:
This is a 66yo male with Marfans
Syndrome. Known mitral valve prolapse with mitral regurgitation
and history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. He is currently
preop for ASC Ao/AVR/?MVR vs Bentall/AVR/?MVR.
He currently complains of chronic dyspnea with modest exertion.
He denies chest pain, orthopnea, PND, pedal edema,
lightheadedness and syncope. He attributes his shortness of
breath to his active smoking. He is able to perform his routine
ADL without difficulty.Referred for surgery.

Pertinent Results:
Intra-op TEE [**2133-3-4**]
PRE-CPB:
No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.

The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).

Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.

The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The
descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. No thoracic aortic
dissection is seen. There are three aortic valve leaflets.
[**Month/Day/Year **] to severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen.

The mitral valve leaflets are myxomatous and severely redundant,
with atrialization of insertion sites. There is [**Month/Day/Year 1192**]/severe
bileaflet mitral valve prolapse. There is a mass on the atrial
side of the a1 scallop of the mitral valve, near the base of the
leaflet. This mass appears to have mobile fronds and measures
1cm x 0.7cm. The MR jet occurs mostly in the area between a3-p3.
There is a central component and an eccentric, posteriorly
directed component. The MR [**First Name (Titles) 40124**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1192**]. Due to the
eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be
underestimated (Coanda effect).

POST-CPB:
A bileaflet mechanical prosthetic valve in the aortic position.
The valve appears well-seated with normal leaflet motion. There
are the normal washing jets. There is no apparent paravalvular
leak or AI. (The valve can only be seen in transgastric views,
it is obscured by acoustic shadowing in esophageal views.) The
peak gradient across the valve is 18mmHg, the mean gradient is
9mmHg with a CO of 6.

There is a tube graft seen in the aortic root and ascending
aorta.

There is a bileaflet mechanic valve in the mitral position. The
valve appears well-seated with normal leaflet motion. There are
the normal washing jets, and no paravalvular leak.

The LV systolic function appears mildly depressed, estimated
EF=40-45%. (The patient underwent a long bypass run and is on
norepi and epi infusions.) The RV systolic function appears low
normal.

There is no evidence of aortic dissection.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2133-3-4**] where
the patient underwent a Bentall procedure with a 25-mm St. [**Hospital 923**]
Medical valved conduit, mechanical, as well as Mitral valve
replacement with a 33-mm St. [**Hospital 923**] Medical mechanical valve with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient
was anti-coagulated with a heparin bridge and coumadin for the
mechanical valves.  The patient was transferred to the telemetry
floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were
discontinued without complication.  The patient was evaluated by
the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility.  [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted for diabetes management.  Cipro
was started for a +urinalysis, but then discontinued when urine
culture was negative.  The patient became therapeutic on
coumadin after several days, and he was cleared for discharge to
home with VNA.
By the time of discharge on POD 12, the patient was ambulating
freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral
analgesics.  The patient was discharged home with VNA in good
condition with appropriate follow up instructions.  Glipizide,
metformin and insulin were started on this admission.   The
patient is instructed to keep a log of his blood sugars and
report them to his PCP.
