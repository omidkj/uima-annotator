Intubation

History of Present Illness:
58 y/o female with h/o DM type II, Asthma, COPD, and arthritis
admitted from OSH after witnessed syncope and near drowning. She
was fishing today with her friend on a canoe and was attempting
to get out of the vessel.  She was having difficulty, so she
rolled into the water. She continued ot have difficulty so she
thought deeper water would help her get to her feet, but her
friend (on shore) witnessed that she suddenly was leanign back
facing up in her life vest. She then turned over and was face
down in the water.  Her partner called for help and the patient
was pulled from the water and CPR was initiated by a civilian..
EMS came and was found to be in PEA arrest and was intubated in
the field. She was brought to [**Hospital **] hospital and a perfusing
rhythym was restored. She was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
care.
.
Per reports, it was approximately 5 minutes from witnessed
syncope to time of CPR initiation.  EMS arrived approximately 15
minutes therafter.   In our ED initial vent settings were A/C
400/15 100%fiO2, 5 PEEP. ABG on floor 7.40/40/272/16. Came to
Unit.

Past Medical History:
Diabetes Type II - oral meds
COPD - takes "inhaler"
ASTHMA
Arthritis - darvocet
H/o prior pneumonia requiriing hospitalization

Notable studies:
.
# CXR [**2185-10-11**] 7:06 PM
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Low lung volumes.
.
# CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2185-10-11**] 6:49 PM
IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Please note an MRI is more sensitive for evaluation of acute
ischemia.
2.  Diffuse sinus disease with air-fluid levels within the right
maxillary and right sphenoid sinus which may relate to water
inhalation or acute sinusitis.  Please correlate clinically.
.
# CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST [**2185-10-11**] 6:49 PM
IMPRESSION:
1.  Limited examination due to technical artifacts as described
above.  No definite acute fracture or malalignment identified.
2.  Questionable hypoattenuating left thyroid lesion likely
represents a
benign nodule.  This can be further evaluated with dedicated
ultrasound on a nonemergent basis as clinically indicated.

Echo [**2185-10-12**]
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is no aortic valve
stenosis. There is no pericardial effusion.

# Ct head [**2185-10-13**]
FINDINGS:  The patient remains intubated.  There is newly
apparent absence of
distinction between the [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter throughout both
cerebral
hemispheres, consistent with widespread anoxic brain injury.
There is also
relative hypodensity and effacement of sulci throughout both
cerebral
hemispheres, suggesting swelling.  In addition, there is new
hypodensity of
the lentiform nuclei bilaterally, consistent with recent
infarcts.  The
ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses are largely opacified and air-fluid
levels and
mucosal thickening are present among the maxillary sinuses.  The
mastoid air
cells are clear.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Findings consistent with global ischemic brain injury.
2.  Considerable opacification among the paranasal sinuses,
which can be seen in intubation.  However, if the patient
develops signs or symptoms of
infection, the possibility of sinusitis could be considered.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P 58 y/o female s/p PEA and near drowning admitted to the MICU
intubated and sedated.
.
# PEA: estimate approximately 45min passed before perfusing
rhythym restored. Percipitant at this time not known. Per story,
appear syncopal event occured prior to her drowning episode, so
can postuale that it was vaso-vagal, hypoglycmeia, or priamry
arrhythmic event leading to drowining and hypoxia, leading to
PEA.  No known underlying coronary disease.
-CK/Trop: anticipate elevation was [**1-28**] CPR, trended downwards
- Echo was normal
-serial neurologic exam showed little change
-evidence for end organ perfusion problems from elevated
lactate.
.
# Metabolic Acidosis: lactic acid from end organ ischemia.
-IV fluids with bicarbonatex  2 L (vent can blow off CO2)
-mechanical ventilation
-acidosis and lactate resolved over course
.
# Near Drowning: was intubated in the field. Vented for airway
protection and to assist in blowign off CO2.
-As sedation was weened pt did not increase responsiveness.
- Family made pt [**Name (NI) 3225**], and ET tube was removed, and pt died
approx 1 hour later.
.
# Neurologic Deficits: Weened proprofol without improvement of
exam.  Neuro consulted and EEG showed that pt did have some
seizure activity, which resolved with propofol.
-Head CT consistent with diffuse anoxic brain damage, and
incompatable with consciousness.
- prognosis was presented to family, and after much discussion
decided to make pt [**Name (NI) 3225**] in accordance to the patients wishes.  At
that time, the ET tube was removed and pt expired at 4:23 am
