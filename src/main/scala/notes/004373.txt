Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5755**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p VT/VF arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
parathyroidectomy
ET during surgery
Right A line
Right Femoral line

History of Present Illness:
57 yo female with PMH ESRD, Afib (on sotalol), baseline QTc
prolongation, Lupus, diverticulitis (s/p resection and
ileostomy) had elective parathyroidectomy today c/b VT arrest.
Pt has a baseline PTH of 2500 with bony pain and difficulty
walking which prompted this surgery. She took sotolol this AM.
During the procedure, pt developed ventricular bigeminy. She
then developed a prolonged episode of VT/VF which lasted for
minutes. She became pulseless and CPR was initiated. The VT
spontaneously terminated. Pt was given amio 150mg bolus. She had
recurrent episode of sustained VT which terminated and was given
another amio 150mg and started on amio gtt at 1mg/min. Also
started on proporol gtt. Of note, the parathyroidectomy was
completed with removal of left upper/lower gland, right
upper/lower gland (total 3.5 glands) and thyroid. [**Name (NI) 4452**] PTH was
[**2111**]; no repeat performed in setting of acute event outlined
above.
.
On arrival to [**Name (NI) 153**], pt was hemodynamically stable. Started on
magnesium.

Physical Exam:
VS: 98.2, p55, 107/49, rr18, 99% on AC 400 (spont 424)/16/5/.60
Gen: intubated and sedated
HEENT: PERRL, clear OP, ET tube in place
CVS: RRR, nl s1 s2, holosystolic murmur at base
Lungs: coarse BS bilaterally anteriorly
Abd: soft, ND, decr BS
Ext: no edema
MSK: deformed right elbow with effusion and no warmth or
redness, bilateral ankle joint swelling w/o evidence of
infection


Pertinent Results:
EKG: NSR@59, leftward axis, QTc prolongation of 497, slight STD
lead 2 (new), LVH by voltage criteria.
.
Rhythm strips: Unable to obtain strip of sustained VT. Strip of
episode of NSVT reveals short runs of polymorphic VT preceded by
long pauses with significantly increased RR intervals.
.
Echo: [**2148-11-21**] ([**Hospital3 **])
Normal LV size and function. EF 65%. Mild concentric LVH. No
regional wall motion abnl. 2+ MR. [**Name14 (STitle) **] TR. biatrial
enlargement.
.
[**2149-5-13**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 11-15mmHg.. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is a
minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild aortic valve stenosis. Moderate mitral
regurgitation. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2149**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.
.
[**2149-5-14**] CXR: Change in lung opacities.
There has been interval extubation and removal of a nasogastric
tube. Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged with vascular
engorgement and perihilar haziness, which may be due to CHF or
volume overload. Homogeneous opacity in left retrocardiac region
and adjacent left pleural effusion are again demonstrated with
interval increase in size of left effusion. Air space opacity in
right lower lobe is difficult to compare due to positional
differences but may be slightly worse, and there is also
apparent slight increase in adjacent right pleural effusion.
Bones are heterogeneous in appearance with a lucent lesion of
the left humeral head as described on the recent study.
.
[**2149-5-14**] ECG: Technically difficult study
Sinus rhythm with PVCs with PACs
QT interval prolonged for rate
Extensive ST-T changes are nonspecific
Since previous tracing of the same date, premature beats are
new, precordial voltage lower
.
[**2149-5-15**] ECG: Sinus rhythm
Long QTc interval
Inferior/lateral ST-T changes are nonspecific
Low limb lead voltage
Since previous tracing of [**2149-5-14**], premature beats not seen,
precordial voltage higher
.
[**2149-5-16**] CXR: Probably no change in the left pleural effusion and
underlying opacity in the left retrocardiac region. Slight
decrease in the right pleural effusion, as well as airspace
opacity in the right lower lobe. Slightly improved degree of
vascular engorgement and perihilar haziness.
.
[**2149-5-16**] ECG: Sinus rhythm, rate 70. Since the previous tracing
of [**2149-5-15**] minimal shortening of the Q-T interval is present,
though it remains prolonged. Technical artifacts are noted over
the lateral precordium.
.
[**2149-5-17**] ECG: Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Prolonged
QTc interval. Clinical correlation is suggested. compared to the
previous tracing of [**2149-5-16**] no significant change.
.
[**2149-5-18**] CXR: Worsening fluid status with features of CHF and
larger effusions. New right airspace disease which is
nonspecific in nature requiring clinical correlation and
additional imaging followup.
.
[**2149-5-18**] ECG: Atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response.
Since the previous tracing of [**2149-5-17**] atrial flutter is now
present.
.
[**2149-5-19**] ECG: Sinus rhythm
Left atrial abnormality
Possible left ventricular hypertrophy
Since previous tracing of [**2149-5-19**], sinus rhythm restored
.
[**2149-5-21**] ECG: Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular
response. Low limb lead voltage. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2149-5-19**] atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular
response has appeared.
.
[**2149-5-23**] ECG: Sinus rhythm. Non-specific T wave inversion in lead
III. Baseline artifact in leads V5-V6 makes interpretation
difficult. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2149-5-21**] sinus
rhythm is now present.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
57 yo female with PMH AF (on sotalol), baseline prolonged QTc,
ESRD on HD, lupus (on chronic steroids), now s/p
parathyroidectomy c/b VT/VF arrest.
.
1. VT/VF arrest: Most likely secondary to torsade de pointes in
setting of alkalemia and hypocalcemia in this patient with
baseline prolonged QTc [**2-21**] Sotalol. Pt had ventricular bigeminy
preceding event, and PVC with post-PVC compensatory pause likely
initiated torsades.  We discontinued amio, sotalol(esp since
it's renally cleared) and plaquenil, all of them prolonged QT;
continued her tele and repeat EKG qAM; monitored and repleted
lytes aggressively.  No further events in house.
.
2. Hyperparathyroidism (s/p parathyroidectomy): Likely secondary
hyperparathyroidism [**2-21**] ESRD vs. tertiary hyperpara.  PTH 58
post surgery.  Received hydrocortisone 100mg x 1 in OR.
Developed subsequent hungry bone syndrome requiring a calcium
drip, calcitriol, and po calcium supplement.  She was we
