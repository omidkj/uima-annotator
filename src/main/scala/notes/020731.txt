Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] rigid bronchoscopy, flexible
bronchoscopy, endobronchial biopsy and tumor debridement of the
left main stem, and placement of covered metal stent [**44**] x 40 mm
in the left main stem on [**2142-12-8**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for a large
mediastinal mass with left main stem obstruction. The patient
was observed over the weekend, and discharged home on [**2142-12-11**],
after deemed safe by PT. His home medications were resumed and
needs follow up with medical oncology, which the patient and
family are aware of and will set up locally. His oxygen
saturations dropped to 88% on RA with ambulation, so he was set
up with portable home oxygen. He was sent home with a 7 day
course of levaquin for post obstructive pneumonia.

The frozen section performed in the operating room revealed the
possibility of small-cell carcinoma versus lymphoma. We will
await the final analysis by the pathologist
to determine the next step in treatment.
