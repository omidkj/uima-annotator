History of Present Illness:
This 60 year old white female underwent mechanical aortic valve
replacement on [**2191-3-4**] for aortic stenosis.  She did well and
was discharged home uneventfully.  She presented elsewhere with
dyspnea on exertion and a CXR demonstrated a left pleural
effusion. She was transferred here for evaluation with stable
vital signs and an INR of 2.5.  An echocardiogram in the ED
suggested a pericardial effusion but no evidence of tamponade.

[**Clip Number (Radiology) 89350**]
Final Report: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is
no relevant
change. No evidence of pneumothorax. Bilateral basal atelectatic
opacities, left more than right. Presence of small bilateral
pleural effusions cannot be excluded. Unchanged course of the
left-sided PICC line. Unchanged mild cardiomegaly. Sternal wires
are in constant position.

[**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT
Echocardiographic Measurements
Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  55% to 60%  >= 55%
Aortic Valve - Peak Gradient:  13 mm Hg  < 20 mm Hg
Aortic Valve - Mean Gradient:  8 mm Hg
Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the LAA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal interatrial septum.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Overall normal LVEF (>55%).
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in
descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: No AS. Trace AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Trivial MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild to moderate [[**11-21**]+] TR.
PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications.
Conclusions
This is a directed study to confirm function of heart and
prosthetic aortic valve.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).

Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There is 1 - 2+ TR.
The prosthetic aortic valve is well-seated with trace AI and a
normal residual mean gradient.
There is a small pericardial effusion which was drained in the
OR.
A large left pleural effusion was drained in the OR.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Following admission a CTA done which revealed a large
pericaridial effusion and a moderate left pleural effusion.
Coumadin was held and heparin begun in light of the mechanical
valve.
Thoracic Surgery was consulted and on [**2191-3-30**] she went to the
Operating Room for:
Left video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS)/pericardial window.
Please see operative report for details. She tolerated the
operation well and post-operatively was initially transferred to
the PACU and extubated however she required reintubation
secondary to hypercapnia. She was then transferred to the
cardiac surgery ICU for care. She woke neurologically intact,
she was weaned from the ventilator and extubated. On POD1 she
remained hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the
cardiac surgery stepdown floor. The next several days were
largely uneventful, heparin and coumadin were resumed. Her drain
was removed on POD3. She worked with physical therapy to improve
her strength and endurance. On POD8 her INR was within range to
be discharged home with VNA. Her Coumadin dosing and INR will be
followed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 35852**].
