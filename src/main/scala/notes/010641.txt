Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
RV pacemaker lead malfunction

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right Ventricle Lead extraction and ICD replacement with St.
[**Male First Name (un) 923**]

History of Present Illness:
75 year old female with h/o long QT, cardiac arrest while
vacationing in [**Country 12649**].  Had ICD placement in [**2133**], placement of a
new RV lead in [**2134**] because of diaphragmatic pacing, second
arrest in [**2134**] in the setting of Biaxin administration,
generator replacement in [**12/2138**], presented for RV pacing lead
extraction after RV impedence increased to 1000 ohms last week.
Found to have fractured lead.
.
Cardiac arrest occurred while she was vacationing in [**Location (un) 84790**]
in [**2134**] in the setting of drinking large quantities of tonic
water (quinine). She had 5 separate episodes of "arrest" prior
to ICD placement in Malaga. The patient had another arrest in
the US in the setting of Biaxin administration.  Pacemaker
placed in [**Country 12649**].  No episodes of cardiac arrests since placement
in [**2134**].
.
The patient had normal device checks in device clinic until last
month when she was found to have elevated impedence of 1900 0hms
in RV lead. Later readings were normal. However, 1.5 weeks ago
whe called clinic because her pacemaker was "beeping" and was
found to have impedence of 100 ohms on [**Male First Name (un) **] transmission. It
was determined that she required a new lead.
.
ICD and pacemaker lead from [**2133**] were removed (atrial lead still
in place).  New ICD lead placed under general anesthesia.  The
patient had 250cc of blood loss during the procedure and was
mildly hypotensive.   0.5-0.8cm pericardial effusion present
during procedure- no change in size.  Admitted to CCU.  Upon
transfer, patient stable with vitals signs as follows: T- 98, P-
97, BP- 128/62, RR- 14, SaO2- 100% on NC
.
The patient reports that on presentation she is asymptomatic.
There is no chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations,
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness,
lightheadedness, diaphoresis, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, syncope or
presyncope.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. No xanthalesma.

NECK: Supple, no JVD.
CARDIAC: RR, normal S1, S2. No m/r/g. No thrills, lifts. No S3
or S4.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis. Resp

Pertinent Results:
Echo [**2140-8-15**]: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. No thoracic
aortic dissection is seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen.
.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
regurgitation jet is eccentric and may be underestimated. TR is
directed toward the CS, with possible restriction of the septal
leaflet.
.
There is a small pericardial effusion measuring 0.6 to 0.9 cm in
thickness, this was stable throughout the procedure and also at
the end of the procedure. There are no echocardiographic signs
of tamponade.
.
CXR portable [**2140-8-15**]: No previous images. A dual-channel
pacemaker device is in place with the leads extending in the
region of the apex of the right ventricle and the right atrium.
Mild hyperexpansion of the lungs suggests underlying chronic
pulmonary disease. The cardiac silhouette is essentially within
normal limits with no evidence of vascular congestion or pleural
effusion.

# RV lead extraction - Extraced RV ICD and RV pacer lead and
implanted new single coil ICD lead and replaced the St. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 923**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] ICD. Post-procedure patient had a
small pericardial effusion measuring 0.6 to 0.9 cm in thickness,
this was stable throughout the procedure and also at the end of
the procedure. There were no echocardiographic or clinical signs
of tamponade.  Repeat echo on [**2140-8-16**] showed stable/resolving
pericardial effusion.  Estimated blood loss 250 cc, but per
report, procedure was slightly more complicated than expected.
Patient did have Hct which dropped from 33.1 to 28.2 then 26.6
(given 1 unit pRBC with appropriate rise).  She was also given 1
unit of pRBC when her Hct went from 29.7 to 27.5, with
appropriate rise.  Her physical exam showed small hematoma near
site of procedure and mild eryhema in L arm and L breast region,
for which patient received 2 doses of vancomycin and PO keflex
(to complete total 7 day course).  Patient did not have any
events on telemetry.  CXR after lead revision did not show
complications of lead implantation, no pneumothorax.  Patient is
to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 84791**] in device clinic in 1 week.
ICD site care reviewed with patient as follows: Please look at
the site daily and note if there is more swelling, tenderness or
redness. Call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for any of those symptoms or if you
develop a fever.  Keep the site covered with a dry dressing. No
pools or baths or showers for one week. Do not lift your left
arm over your head for 6 weeks. Keep your left arm on 2 pillows
while you are sitting or lying down to decrease the swelling.
