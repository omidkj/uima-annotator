Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Shellfish Derived

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2145**]
Chief Complaint:
fall with intracranial bleed


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with history of Afib on warfarin, DMII, PVD,
HTN, TIAx2, HL, CKI, severe pulmonary HTN presents s/p fall with
head trauma resulting in bitemporal IPH and SAH.  Patient
reports that she was reaching for something while seated in her
wheelchair and fell forward striking the left side of her face
on a table and then the floor.  She reports no loss of
consciousness.  Felt slightly dizzy prior to the fall, had some
sensations of palpitations.  Denies any  headache, LOC, n/v,
chest pain or blurred vision.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 98.5, 81, 156/83, 20, 98% RA.
Patient received CT of head which showed bilateral sylvian
fissure SAH.  CT maxilla found a non displaced fracture of the
left anterior maxilla. Patient was initially collared, but
C-spine was subsequently cleared with CT.  Neurosurgery
evaluated the patient in the ED, did not recommend emergent
neurosurgical intervention.  Patient was loaded with dilantin 1
g IV.  For a supratherapeutic INR of 3.6, patient was given 2
units of FFP as well as vitamin K 10 mg IV.  Patient was
admitted to the MICU for close monitoring.  Per ED report,
patient was speaking clearly, awake, not confused, prior to
transport.  Vital signs prior to transfer were: 88, 137/77, 19,
95% 2L.
.
In the MICU, patient is awake but fatigued, alert and oriented
to person place and time.  Complains of a little bit of pain in
her left face, but says that it does not bother her unless she
presses on it.

IMAGING:
.
[**2189-1-2**] CT head w/o contrast:  Bilateral Sylvian fissure
subarachnoid hemorrhages. No fractures.
.
[**2189-1-8**] CT head w/o contrast:
1. Multiple areas of subarachnoid hemorrhage that appeared to be
resolving.  This is most pronounced at the site of hemorrhage
seen in the
perimesencephalic cistern.
2. No evidence of new foci of hemorrhage.
.
[**2189-1-2**] CT sinus/mandible:  Non-displaced fracture of the
anterior left maxilla with possible involvement of the root of
the corresponding canine tooth. There is associated with soft
tissue swelling.

.
[**2189-1-2**] CT C-spine: No fractures or malalignments. Mild
degenerative change with posterior osteophytes causing mild
narrowing of the central canal. This increases the risk of cord
injury, not assessed by noncontrast CT. If clinical concern for
such injury is maintained, MRI is indicated.

.
[**2189-1-2**] CXR: Marked aortic tortuosity with widening of the
superior
mediastinum as noted previously. If there is clinical concern
for aortic
injury based upon mechanism or other clinical signs,
cross-sectional imaging is advised.

.
[**2189-1-8**] R lower extremity ultrasound:  No evidence of DVT.
.
[**2189-1-14**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free
wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal
image quality. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2187-10-19**],
right ventricular function appears mildly reduced. There is no
evidence of endocarditis on this technically limited study. The
severity of mtiral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation are
reduced.
.


Brief Hospital Course:

#. Intracranial bleed: Patient found to have bilateral
subarachnoid hemorrhages in setting of fall and supratherapeutic
INR.  INR 3.6 on admission to ED, written to receive 2 units of
