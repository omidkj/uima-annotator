Service:

The patient is a 57-year-old man who is well known to the
Trauma Service, status post pedestrian struck by motor
vehicle on [**2144-11-12**] with a subsequent prolonged hospital
stay.  The patient was discharged to rehab on [**2144-12-18**].  On
the evening of [**2144-12-20**], his percutaneous cholecystostomy
tube was inadvertently removed.  Subsequently, he had
complaints of abdominal pain and the patient was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation.  In the E.R., he had complaints of
diffuse abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, also with
complaints of difficulty breathing.  In the E.R., he had an
episode of emesis, which was witnessed, with aspiration of
gastric contents.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Pedestrian struck by motor vehicle on
[**2144-11-12**], subsequent hospital course was as follows.  Status
post exploratory laparotomy with a splenectomy and
diaphragmatic rupture repair.  The patient had a right
internal capsule and right frontal lobe intracranial bleed.
On [**2144-11-13**], he went to the operating room for external
fixation of his left tib-fib fracture.  Subsequently he was
noted to have a right MCA embolic stroke with a patent
foramen ovale.  He had an IVC filter placed.  On [**2144-11-19**],
he went back to the operating room and had an ORIF performed
of his left tib-fib fracture.  On [**2144-11-21**], status post
exploratory laparotomy, appendectomy for perforated
gangrenous appendicitis, status post tracheostomy, status
post percutaneous cholecystostomy on [**2144-11-27**], secondary to
acalculous cholecystitis, an episode of rapid atrial
fibrillation, and underwent a left lung decortication on
[**2145-1-1**].

MEDICATIONS ON THIS ADMISSION:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg q.day.
2.  Subcu heparin 5,000 units b.i.d.
3.  Flomax 0.4 mg q.day.
4.  Tylenol p.r.n.
5.  Colace 100 mg b.i.d.
6.  Percocet p.r.n.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature was 103.0??????, heart rate
110, blood pressure 110/palp, 150/80, breathing between 24 to
50, 90% saturation.  GENERAL:  He was alert and oriented
times three, appropriate.  HEENT:  Pupils were equally round
and reactive bilaterally.  Extraocular movements intact.
Oropharynx was clear.  C-collar was placed.  CARDIOVASCULAR:
Regular rate and rhythm.  CHEST:  Decreased breath sounds at
the left base, otherwise fine crackles bilaterally.  No
wheezes.  ABDOMEN:  Non-distended, diffusely tender with
guarding except at left upper quadrant where it was negative.
Negative drainage from cholecystostomy tube site.  RECTAL:
Negative mass.  Guaiac negative.  EXTREMITIES:  2+ DP pulses
bilaterally, minimal edema.

LABORATORY:  Hematocrit 45.7, white count 20.4, platelet
count 985.  Chem-7:  Sodium 137, potassium 5.4, chloride 106,
bicarb 24, BUN 19, creatinine 0.5, glucose 83, calcium 10.6,
magnesium 2.5, phosphorus 6.5, albumin 3.5, AST 110, ALT 60,
total bilirubin 1, amylase 103, lipase 43, alkaline
phosphatase 423.

Chest x-ray at that time showed feeding tube in proximal
esophagus.  Left lower lobe collapse.  No free air in the
abdomen.

At that time, the patient was aggressively resuscitated,
placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics, vancomycin and Zosyn.
The patient had ABGs on the day of admission which revealed
pH 7.33, pCO2 25, pO2 75, bicarb 25, -1 base excess.  At that
time, CT of abdomen and chest were performed, showing slight
decrease in size of the loculated left pleural effusion,
persistent collapse of the left lower lobe, and posteroapical
segment of the left lower lobe, also small amount of
perihepatic fluid as well as fluid in bilateral pericolic
gutters and the pelvis, which could represent a bile leak
consequent to the forceful extraction of the cholecystostomy
tube, with minimal right mesenteric stranding which may be
related to postsurgical changes.  An area of high attenuation
in the region of the right UV junction, small, partially
obstructing stone cannot be excluded.  A right subclavian
line was placed on the day of admission.

Given the nature of his peritoneal signs and the degree of
septic physiology, it was elected to take him to the
operating room for an exploratory laparotomy.
Cholecystectomy and right upper quadrant drains were placed.
Estimated blood loss was 500 cc.  The patient was taken to
the PACU in guarded condition.  See operative note for
further detail.  A CT surgery consult was obtained on post-op
day #1 to evaluate the multiple rib fractures in proximity to
the heart.  Thoracic team bronchoscoped the patient and found
thick yellow-green plug in left upper lobe and left lower
lobe trifurcation, which was sent for cultures and Gram
stain.  Otherwise, their recommendation was to bronchoscope
again, also chest PT, but no concern for the rib fractures.
On post-op day #2, [**2144-12-23**], the patient continued to be
afebrile and required moderate amounts of fluids.  His white
blood cell count continued to increase up to 26.

It was, therefore, decided to take him back to the operating
room to re-explore and wash out his abdomen to rule out any
other septic focus.  Again, bile peritonitis (post-op
diagnosis), no other focus for infection.  Wash-out was
performed.  Blood loss was 100 cc and no complications.  The
patient was taken to the PACU in fair condition.  See
operative note for further details.  Postoperatively, the
patient remained febrile.  On [**2144-11-23**] another bronchoscopy
was performed, which found copious thick secretions on the
left.  Chest x-ray was also done on [**2144-11-23**], which showed
improvement on the right side with little change on the left.
On [**2144-11-24**], the patient's vitals had improved to T-max
99.1??????, heart rate 88, blood pressure 117/64, respiratory rate
10, satting 98%.  He was on CPAP, PEEP of 10, pressure
support of 15.  At that point, in terms of cultures, blood
cultures had not grown anything.  Sputum had grown Staph.
aureus.  The urine culture is still pending and peritoneal
culture has just started growing MRSA.  Also Klebsiella was
growing from the [**2144-12-22**], therefore both Zosyn and
vancomycin were continued.

The patient was getting TPN for nutrition thus far through
the hospital course.  He was started on tube feeds on
[**2144-12-27**], which were increased slowly.  Tube feeds were at
goal of 110 on [**2144-12-30**].  At that point, TPN was DC'd.

The patient's respiratory status was a major issue.  The
patient continued to have a lot of secretions which made
weaning from the ventilator difficult.  The patient failed
many trach mask trials.  On [**2144-12-30**], the patient was on
trach O2, tolerated this well with a blood gas of 7.44, 42,
88, 29, base excess of 3.

As of [**2145-1-1**], the patient's neurologic status revealed he
was awake, alert, continued to have weakness on his left arm
and leg.  Plan was to continue to treat his intermittent
agitation with Ativan.

Cardiovascularly, he is on 50 mg of Lopressor b.i.d. for his
previous history of MI.  Currently, he had pulse in the 80s
and BP of 110 systolic.  Respiratory-wise, he continued to
have ongoing problems with secretions.  They did not appear
to look like tube feeds, but thick yellow secretions.  Chest
x-ray from [**2144-12-29**] showed much improved aeration in the
left lobe.  Blood gases showed good oxygenation.  Planned to
continue pulmonary toilet, which will necessitate the ICU
stay, so he does not develop significant mucus plugs that
will compromise his respiratory status.

GI:  The patient's abdomen is soft, wound is clean.  The
patient has normal bowel function.  At this point, the plan
is to continue tube feeds and to discontinue Protonix.

I.D.:  He is still on Zosyn and vancomycin covering his
Klebsiella pneumonia and Staph. pneumonia and peritoneal
culture that grew out Staph.  Plan is to continue Zosyn and
vancomycin until white counts are normal and he is afebrile
for 24 hours.  Antibiotics were DC'd on [**2145-1-3**] after a
12-day course of vancomycin and 13-day course of Zosyn.

Speech and swallow evaluation was obtained on [**2144-12-30**].
