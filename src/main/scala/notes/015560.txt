HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 31 year old male with
history of intravenous drug abuse with heroin, hepatitis B with a
recent admission from [**9-3**], to [**2181-9-30**] with a
right-sided tricuspid valve endocarditis complicated by septic
emboli to his lungs with Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus
aureus.  He was initially treated with a combination of
Vancomycin and gentamicin secondary to a penicillin allergy but
was then changed to Oxacillin and Gentamicin for three weeks time
at which point he left Against-Medical-Advice and was changed to
p.o. Linezolid.  He now returns with complaints of shortness of
breath and back pain.  Mr. [**Known lastname 931**] originally presented on
[**9-3**], with four days of fever to 104, headache,
photophobia, nausea and vomiting and meningismus.  19 of 21
blood culture bottles grew Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus
aureus.  He also had a left arm abscess at a heroin injection
site which grew Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and
Streptococcus milleri.  Initial echocardiogram showed no
vegetations but a repeat transthoracic echocardiogram several
weeks into his hospital course had a large vegetation of the
tricuspid valve and 2+ tricuspid regurgitation.  He initially was
treated with Vancomycin and Gentamicin but blood cultures
continued to be positive and therefore desensitization to
Oxacillin was performed in the Medicine Intensive Care Unit and
he was started on a combination of Oxacillin and Gentamicin with
resolution of his fevers and bacteremia.  After three weeks
of treatment of Oxacillin the patient refused transfer to
[**Last Name (un) 9301**].  He finished a six week course of Oxacillin and he
left Against-Medical-Advice.  He was given p.o. Linezolid
even though this was suboptimal treatment so that he would
have some antibiotic coverage and was discharged on [**2181-9-30**].  Of note, he also had multiple septic emboli to his
lungs on that admission.  He was then seen in clinic on
[**10-10**] and still had sweat though no fevers and
significant pleuritic chest pain.  Laboratory data showed an
increased white blood cell count, ESR and CRP.  The patient
was notified and sent to the Emergency Department.  The
patient reports no fevers since leaving the hospital but he
has had nightsweats requiring him to change his clothes up to
three times per night as well as sweats during the day.  He
reports chills as well and reports intermittent shortness of
breath at rest that has been getting worse.  He also has
pleuritic chest pain that has continued and Fentanyl patch
helps although only for a short while.  He says he has been
taking the Linezolid as described.  He also is complaining of
continuing low back pains which is chronic but then worsens
with discharge.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Intravenous drug abuse, heroin
last use [**2181-9-2**], per patient.  2.  Hepatitis B.
3.  Seizures.  4.  Right-sided tricuspid
Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis,
partially treated with septic emboli to his lung.  5.  Low
back pain since childhood.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin and Ampicillin both of which cause
rash and shortness of breath.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Linezolid 600 mg p.o. b.i.d.;
Fentanyl patch 25 mcg that the patient reports he has been
changing every 48 hours.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives with his girlfriend/fiance and has
a ten year old son from a previous relationship.  He has a
history of intravenous drug abuse and he reports his last use
of heroin on [**2181-9-2**].  He has also used cocaine in
the past and ethanol in the past, previously 30 cans of beer
per day, now only occasionally.  He also smokes two to five
packs per day of cigarettes for many years, and he has
multiple tattoos.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Only significant for alcoholism in a
brother, father and grandfather.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.7, blood pressure
104/70, pulse 102, respiratory rate 20, sating 100% on room
air.  The patient was lying comfortably in bed, watching
television, a pleasant thin man in no acute distress.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat, sclera were anicteric and his
mucous membranes were moist.  Neck, he had no jugulovenous
distension or lymphadenopathy and he had 2+ carotid pulses
without bruit.  Cardiovascular, regular rate and rhythm,
normal S1 and S2.  No murmur appreciated.  Lungs, clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  He had no costovertebral angle
tenderness but he did have lumbar spinal tenderness.  His
abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with positive bowel
sounds and no organomegaly.  His extremities were warm and
well perfused with no edema.  His neurological examination
was unremarkable.  His skin examination showed no stigmata of
systemic emboli from endocarditis, namely no splinter
hemorrhages, no ossicular nodes or [**Last Name (un) 1003**] lesions.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data on admission revealed white
count 12.0 with 60% neutrophils, 30% lymphocytes, 6%
monocytes, 4% eosinophils, hematocrit 36.9, platelets 188.
Chem-7 was unremarkable as were liver function tests.  ESR
was 42.  Toxicology screen was positive for ethanol but
otherwise negative and he was positive for hepatitis B.  His
chest x-ray showed interval improvement in multiple cavitary
lesions in the right upper lobe and left lower lobe with no
new consolidation and new cavitary lesions noted.
Computerized tomography scan of the chest was negative for
pulmonary embolism but did show multiple nodular cavitary
lesions that had all decreased in size except for two in his
right apex, one of which was new.  His electrocardiogram was
normal sinus rhythm in the 80s, normal axis and intervals and
[**Doctor Last Name 1754**] and no ST-T wave abnormality.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Endocarditis - The patient has a known
tricuspid valve Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus
endocarditis that was incompletely treated with optimal therapy
of Oxacillin due to his leaving the hospital Against-Medical-
Advice, and his symptoms have remained as well as elevated white
count and elevated ESR.  Infectious Disease and Allergy were both
consulted and it was determined that the patient would need
another four week course of Oxacillin.  He was initially started
on Vancomycin until transfer to the Medicine Intensive Care Unit
could be raised for his desensitization, which went well with no
complications and the patient was started on Oxacillin on [**2181-10-15**].  Blood cultures drawn on admission as well as the
following two days remained negative and so Gentamicin was not
included.  Repeat transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal left
atrium and left ventricular ejection fraction of over 55% and the
tricuspid valve vegetation was currently smaller and now only
moderate in size, but his tricuspid regurgitation was now
moderately severe and therefore a little worse than the previous
echocardiogram.  He continued to have mild pulmonary hypertension
with an estimated pressure of 30+ right atrial pressure.
Additionally since the patient came in complaining of worsening
low back pain, there was concern that he had a new epidural
abscess, so magnetic resonance imaging scan of his lumbar spine
was obtained that showed no abscess and some old L5-S1 disc
herniation.  The patient did well during his hospital course
on Oxacillin and had no allergic reaction to it, and his
sweats improved.

2.  Pain control - The patient had chest pain from his resolving
septic emboli as well as likely from some costochondritis.  The
Pain Service was consulted in an effort to manage his pain, given
his history of opiate abuse.  The patient came in on essentially
50 of Fentanyl patch because he was wearing two at a time.  The
Pain Service recommended pain control with additional nonopiates,
none of which were very effective.  Finally the patient was
switched from Fentanyl patch to Methadone 20 t.i.d. for a better
pain control.  He will be closely followed for his Methadone use
by his primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**La
