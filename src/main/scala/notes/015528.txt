Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3151**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension, dizziness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation.

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 57 year old female with past medical history of
aortic valve replacement, hypertension, and hypothyroidism who
presented to the emergency department with dizziness and fall
after taking all of her daily medications at one time on the
evening of [**2203-8-7**].
.
Patient relates that she usually takes her medications for the
day all at once (except a few evening medications) in the
morning, including plavix, levoxyl, klonipin, lisinopril,
triampterene/HCTZ, diovan, lopressor, imdur, lamictal, and
possibly others. She reports she became dizzy and fell after
taking her medications. Otherwise she has felt well recently.
She does relate some episodes of chest pain several weeks ago
and had seen cardiology for them. Otherwise she has felt in her
usual state of health, however some increasing fatigue. In the
ED she denied chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath,
fever, or chills.
.
Hospital Course:
.
In the ED, her vitals were: T 98.7, BP 62/30, RR 20s, Oxygen
saturation 98% on RA, HR 68. She was given 2L IVF without
improvement in her BPs, so dopamine was started. She also
received narcan w/out effect, glucagon, and charcoal, with
emesis. She was intubated for airway protection and a tiple
lumen was placed. A head CT was completed and negative for any
acute process.
.
She was transferred to the MICU where she ws kept on dopamine
and propofol while intubated, for a day, and successfully
extubated on [**8-8**] without difficulty.  She was given 4L IVF. To
work up her hypotension, a TSH was checked. An echo was
completed and cultures were sent. Her creatinine was elevated up
to 2.0, but urine output remained good. Her BP meds were held,
as were a number of her psychiatric medications, some of which
were restarted prior to transfer to the floors. SW and
psychiatry followed patient, who is adamant that the overdose
was unintentional.
.
Tonight upon reviewing the HPI and hospital events, patient
states she is feeling tired, and not quite at her baseline, but
otherwise well. She has no specific complaints, aside from
concerns about the stress that her hospitalization has created
on her and her family. Currently she is concerned about money
that she had with her and was signed out to her daughter, who
claims she never got it. She denies CP, SOB, abdominal pain,
nausea, vomiting, headache, or dizziness.

Pertinent Results:
DATA:
EKG:NSR @ 67. Norm Axis and intervals. RBBB pattern unchanged
from prior. No ST-T wave changes.
.
CXR: [**2203-8-7**]: FINDINGS:  Bedside AP examination labeled "supine
at 19:40H" is compared with the similar study obtained
approximately one hour earlier.  There has een interval
repositioning of the ET tube, with tip now approximately 3.8 cm
proximal to the carina.  An NG tube extends below the diaphragm
and beyond the film, with its side-hole in the region of the
gastric body and the gaseous distention of the stomach has
resolved.  A new right internal jugular central venous catheter
terminates in the region of the cavo-atrial junction with no
supine evidence of pneumothorax.  There is patchy, streaky
opacity involving the left lung mid-zone and base which may
represent subsegmental atelectasis.  The patient is status post
median sternotomy with CABG and probable AVR, as before.
.
CT Head: [**2203-8-7**]:
FINDINGS:  There is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, mass
effect, shift of normally midline structures, or hydrocephalus.
There are no fractures.  There is extensive opacification within
the nasopharynx and nasal cavity which is new. There is mild
mucosal thickening within the ethmoid air cells.  The visualized
maxillary sinuses, mastoid air cells, and the middle ear
cavities are clear. Soft tissues appear unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1.  No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
2.  New nasopharyngeal and nasal cavity opacification.  Direct
visualization is recommended.
.
ECHO [**2203-8-8**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is
0-5mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) Right ventricular
chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis
is present.
The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal
disc motion and
transvalvular gradients. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. A well-seated annuloplasty
ring is present.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with trivial
mitral
stenosis. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2201-2-17**],
the estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now lower. Biventircular
systolic
function and valvular function are similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:
57 year old female with HTN, AVR, depression, and hypothyroidism
presents with hypotension after taking all medications at one
time, presents to floors after stay in MICU with intubation and
pressors, now hemodynamically stable.
.
# Hypotension/Medication Ingestion: Given the acute onset of
symptoms shortly after the patient reports she took "all of her
pills," it is highly likely, as thought by the MICU and ED
teams, that the patient suffered adverse consequences of taking
too many blood pressure and sedating medications at once. It
appears that she took her klonopin, lisinopril,
triampterene/HCTZ, diovan, lopressor, and imdur, all at one
time. Psychiatry and social work followed closely with the
medical team, and did not feel that it was a suicide attempt,
although clearly there was a need to review patient's medication
list with her and try simplify her regimen.
- TSH was checked while in the MICU, was found to be decreased
