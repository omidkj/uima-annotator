Chief Complaint:
Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
HPI: Mr. [**Known lastname 32485**] is an 81-year old man with CAD,3-vessel disease,
s/p NSTEMI, s/p LAD stent placement 3 wks ago, who presents with
hypotension soon after heparin treatment was initiated at NH for
R lower segmental PE.
.
He reports sustaining a fall about a month ago requiring a rehab
stay. The fall left him w/ a R-sided shoulder and chest/flank
pain [**1-4**] to rib fx and contusions. The fall required admission
to rehab. At rehab facility, pt suffered NSTEMI and was brought
to [**Hospital1 18**]. Pt was hospitalized for cardiac cath approx 3 weeks
ago.  Cath study found 3-vessel dz  and LAD was stented. Pt
returned to rehab after being hospitalized for NSTEMI, s/p cath.
He was home from rehab for only several days prior to admission.
.
The day prior to admission, pt noted increasing worsening of RUQ
pain which he initially attributed to injuries [**1-4**] to his fall.
The RUQ pain was aggravated by inspiration and coughing. He also
admits to nausea which started simultaneously. He denies chest
pain, SOB, LH, melena, BRBPR, hematochezia, f/c/r, UTI sx. His
wife took him to [**Hospital3 628**] where he was found to have a
right lower segmental PE on chest CT. Anticoagulation with
heparin was initiated. Over several hours, BP dropped from
130/70 ?????? 62/palp.  Heparin was immediately dc??????d out of concern
for acute bleed and IVF and Dopamine @ 5 started. Pt transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2108-3-18**] 3:54 PM - IMPRESSION: 1. Small
bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis. The
opacity at the left lung base is increased compared to the prior
study and may also be consistent with aspiration. 2. No evidence
of retroperitoneal hemorrhage. 3. Minimally displaced right
posterior eighth and ninth rib fractures. No evidence of
pneumothorax.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
81 M with CAD s/p stent, dyslipidemia, chronic anemia, hx of
panhypopit, who was found to have a PE at [**Hospital **] transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] MICU for treatement of hypotension
.
HYPOTENSION - MICU course notable for wean off dopamine after
several hours. Was given 1U FFP to reverse his PTT (out of
concern for bleed). Right subclavian triple lumen was placed to
monitor CVP. Pt was placed on high dose steroids (solumedrol
100mg q8h) then switched to hydrocortisone. He maintained his
SBP in the 90s-130s off pressors, and Vanc/Flagyl were d/c'd
then Levofloxacin as pt w/o signs of infection. The etiology of
hypotension remained unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] source of bleed was identified
(CT did now show evidence of a retroperitoneal hemorrhage,
guaiac neg.). Low BP thought to be possibly related to
hypovolemia and adrenal insuff. [**1-4**] to hypopit. Sepsis was felt
to be less likely.  His Hct dropped 33.3-->26.8 over the 1st 24
hrs but then remained stable in the 27s while on heparin. No
source of a bleeed could be ID'd (concern was for RP bleed since
had cath recently and last admission had RP bleed when started
on heparin). The patient's blood pressure remained stable on his
outpatient Hydrocort dose.
.
PULMONARY EMBOLUS - At OSH chest CT demonstrated right lower
lobe segmental PE. CT at [**Hospital1 18**] was w/o contrast. Pt has had no
sx of respiratory distress while in unit. Heparin was restarted
since no sign of bleed noted and Hct and SBP remained stable. He
was placed on Coumadin, and transitioned to Lovenox upon
discharge.
.
ANEMIA - In the MICU, Hct initially dropped 33.3-->26.8 over the
1st 24 hrs but then remained stable in the 27s while on heparin.
No source of a bleeed could be ID'd. The acute drop in Hct may
have dilutional. Pt at base has chronic anemia, and iron studies
suggest anemia of chronic dz. UPEP/SPEP neg. He will have an
outpatient Colonscopy arranged with his PCP since he will be on
Coumadin therapy.
.
CARDS - the pt has elevated troponin and nonspecific EKG changes
which were felt to be demand ischemia if hypovolemic [**1-4**] to
bleed or [**1-4**] to dopamine. CKs were negative, Tn .08, .03. Bump
in troponin likely due to ischemia in setting of receiving
dopamine and having mod-severe 3-vessel CAD.  He continued on
Plavix and his statin. Lisinopril, Lopressor, and ASA were
restarted.
.
LEUKOCYTOSIS - increase in WBC from 12 to 21, but afebrile with
no signs of infection. This was thought to be secondary to
steroids.
.
PAIN - pt has back, shoulder, and flank pain thought to be
related to rib and verterbral compression fx. Pt's pain well
controlled on Tylenol 600mg-1gm q6h, and morphine was not
required on the floor. Fosamax, Vit D, Calcium carbonate
restarted. Pt's intial RUQ pain resolved. This could have been
possibly related to R lower segmental PE or MSK pain [**1-4**] to
fall. LFTs were normal and pt is s/p CCY.
.
ENDOCRINE - he was continued on Levothyroxine and testerone
patch
.
DISPOSITION - Pt was evaluated by PT who thought he was safe for
him to return home with services. Both him and his wife were
educated on Lovenox injections, and he was discharged home with
close outpatient follow-up.
