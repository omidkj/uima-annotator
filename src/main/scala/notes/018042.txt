Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
direct admit for work up of pulmonary nodules

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
*
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 46 yo female with a h/o myocardial infarction
([**4-12**] s/p stents now on ASA/[**Month/Year (2) **]) who is s/p matched unrelated
allogeneic BMT for acute monocytic leukemia 3 years ago who
presents for work-up of pulmonary nodules found on CT scan at
OSH.  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was diagnosed with M4 AML in 05/[**2175**].  She was
initially treated with daunorubicin, Ara-c and etoposide.  She
was then referred to [**Hospital 4415**] for further
evaluation, where she received further induction on chemotherapy
with daunorubicin and cytarabine in 07/[**2175**]. She underwent a MUD
transplant on [**2176-10-4**].  Her transplant course was complicated
by grade 1 acute graft versus host disease of the skin as well
as acute renal failure.  Reportedly, following her transplant,
she developed chronic graft versus host disease of the GI tract,
lungs and eyes.
*
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was in remission but her course has been complicated
by GVHD of the skin (scleroderma reaction).  She has been
treated for this with Rituxan and more recently with
Pentostatin.  Recently, her most noticable complaint has been
progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion.  She was admitted
for this in [**State 1727**] one month ago and has felt to have a component
of diastolic heart dysfuntion with an elevated BNP in the 400's.
 PFT's performed at that time revealed a significant obstructive
defect with mininal response to bronchodilators felt consistent
with interstitial lung disease.  Since this time, she notes that
her symptoms have been worsening with increasing more rapidly.
Now, she becomes SOB walking approximately 100ft or climbing [**4-14**]
steps.  In addition, over the past 3-4 days, she notes that she
has been coughing up brown-rust colored sputum.  She has also
developed some pain on
deep inspiration at her left costal margin.
*
Her oncologist at [**Hospital1 18**] (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**] referred her to see a
pulmonologist (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1007**]) at [**Hospital1 336**] the day prior to
admission.  A CT of her chest was performed showing  bilateral
pulmonary nodules.  Because of these findings, there was concern
for Aspergillus, and she was subsequently referred to [**Hospital1 18**]
given the majority of her care is under Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1557**]. The
patient decided that she would come in the following morning.
*
At the time of admission, the denies any fevers, chills, change
in weight or appetite over the past several months.  She reports
persistent nausea as well as bouts of constipation interspersed
with diarrhea.  She has also had a persistent ulceration in her
right upper buccal mucosa which has not healed despite a course
of famvir and oral diflucan.  She additionally has been followed
for persistent conjunctivitis believed to be ocular GVHD.  She
reports a sensation of facial pressure but denies any nasal
drainage, visual or hearing
changes, headache, dizziness, or any focal neurologic symptoms.

1) Acute monomyelocytic leukemia s/p allo-MUD transplant 3 years
   ago as above.
2) CAD: s/p MI and stentx2 one year ago in [**State 1727**].
3) GVHD: mostly cutaneous, questionably ocular.
4) Intersitial lung disease
5) Diastolic heart dysfunction

Social History:
Lives in [**State 1727**], smoked 1 PPD x 30 years but quit in [**4-12**] after
having MI, denies any ETOH or drug abuse.

Brief Hospital Course:
*
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 46 yo female 3 years s/p matched related
allogeneic BMT AML now severely immunosuppressed, who presented
with multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules in the setting of
persitently worsening dyspnea on exertion and brown-rust colored
sputum.
*
1) PULMONARY NODULES: The patient was significantly
immunocompromised on predisone, cellcept, prograf, and
pentostatin.  Therefore, opportunistic infections were
considered on admission.  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was initially started on
Ambisome for empiric coverage of fungal infection such as
aspergillus.  She was also started on levofloxacin.  She was
taken for VATS on [**2179-11-15**] for biopsy of the lung nodules seen on
chest CT.  A bronchoscopy with lavage was also performed during
the procedure.  The tissue biopsy obtained during VATS was
negative; however, the BAL was positive for Aspergillus.  Her
antifungal regimen was changed from Ambisome to Voriconazole and
Caspofungin.  The levofloxacin was later discontinued.  Follow
up CT scans of the chest showed findings consistent with
invasive aspergillosis.
*
2) PLEURITIC PAIN: Throughout her admission, the patient
continued to complain of right sided pleuritic pain.  The
patient also has chronic pain on top of this acute pain for
which she takes a very low dose of MSIR as an outpatient.  She
was started on MS contin 15 mg PO BID, which was later titrated
up to 30 mg PO BID.  The pain service was consulted and
recommended starting a lidoderm patch as well as neurontin.
These recommendations were implemented.  The acute pleuritic
pain was on the same side of the VATS, so it was thought to be
post-procedural pain, possibly from nerve injury.  She also had
an effusion and pleural thickening, so it may have been pain due
to pleural inflammation related to the VATS. A CTA was performed
on [**11-28**] which was negative for pulmonary embolism.  The
Pulmonary Service was consulted and their impression was that
her pleuritic pain was due to post-procedural pleural
inflammation. They recommended starting NSAIDS for
anti-inflammatory effect.  The patient was started on Ibuprofen
400 mg PO BID and her pain significantly improved.  A
thoracentesis was considered to remove fluid from her effusion;
however, it was decided that there was an insignificant amount
of fluid for the procedure to be performed safely.
*
3) MUCOSAL ULCER: The patient had an oral ulcer on admission,
which was thought to be secondary to graft vs. host disease.  At
on
