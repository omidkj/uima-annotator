HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for further
surgical therapy of his recurrent rectal cancer.  In the
operating room, the decision was made to proceed with
abdominoperineal resection.  The patient seemed to tolerate
the procedure well without complication.

Postoperatively, the patient was recovering nicely on bedrest
until the morning of [**2197-11-16**], postoperative day number two.
The patient on postoperative day number two had some mental
status changes and was initially somewhat lethargic and
became agitated and intermittently violent.  The patient
became disoriented although he was alert.  Initial workup
including cardiac and metabolic workups proved to be
negative.  The patient did have some crackles on physical
examination throughout his lung fields.  After speaking with
the family, the patient had a history of some altered mental
status changes preceding a previous episode of pneumonia that
he had had.  Working diagnosis at that time was pneumonia
versus hospital psychosis.  The patient's mental status did
not improve over the course of the following two days with
some intermittent agitation.  The patient was medicated with
Haldol and Ativan.  This had some success.

On the evening of postoperative day number four, the patient
had an acute episode of respiratory distress and required
intubation on the floor.  Subsequent to this, the patient was
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for closer monitoring
and ventilatory management.  In the Intensive Care Unit, the
patient did well and was extubated postoperative day number
six.  The patient was empirically covered for a probable
aspiration pneumonia with Levaquin, a seven day course.  The
patient was transferred back to the floor on postoperative
day number six.  His mental status was normal at that time.
Throughout the rest of his hospital course, the patient did
quite well.  His diet was advanced as tolerated.  The patient
was discharged on postoperative day number ten tolerating a
regular diet and having regular ostomy output, good pain
control on p.o. pain medications.
