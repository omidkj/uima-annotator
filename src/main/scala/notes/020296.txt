CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Patient is unresponsive.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is an 82 year-old female
with a history of coronary artery disease, status post
coronary artery bypass graft, type 2 diabetes and
hypothyroidism found down by her sister on the day of
admission.  The patient was last seen two days prior to
admission.  The patient was found in bed in the right
recumbent position with a large amount of dry blood on the
bed and with evidence of laceration on the right side of her
tongue.  Her [**Location (un) 2611**] score was 4.  She was unresponsive to
verbal and painful stimuli with spontaneous eye opening.  The
patient's airway was patent at this time. Her respiratory
rate was 22 with an O2 saturation of 100 percent.  Blood
pressure was 130/80, pulse 90, fingerstick 159.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 90.  The
patient was brought into the Emergency Room and given her
unresponsiveness and lack of gag reflex on examination she
was intubated for airway protection and a nasogastric tube
was placed.  Her arterial blood gases at this time showed pH
6.4, bicarbonate 34 and pO2 of 357.  Her lactate was 3.1.
She was subsequently put on a ventilator.  An
electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 91, LAD
normal intervals at 2 and 3 but no ischemic changes. Chest
x-ray was done which showed no infiltrates.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Was significant for type 2 diabetes
diagnosed in the late [**2155**], patient is insulin-dependent.
Also significant for coronary artery disease, status post a
myocardial infarction and status post a coronary artery
bypass graft.  Her anginal equivalent is jaw heaviness.
Patient also has a history of hypothyroidism and poor vision
per her daughter.

MEDICATIONS:  Included aspirin 325 mg p.p. q.o., Lopresor 25
mg p.o. t.i.d., Synthroid 88 mcg p.o. q.d., Colace 100 mg
p.o. b.i.d. and insulin 70/30 26 unit q A.M. and 18 units q
P.M.  Patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY: Is that she lives in a Senior Citizen home
and the patient is provided meals during the week days.  Her
older sister lives in the same building.  She uses a cane for
ambulation.  She has no tobacco or ethanol history.  Patient
speaks to her daughter weekly.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission included temperature 98,
pulse 90, blood pressure 129 to 153/70 to 80, pulse 70s, O2
saturation 100 percent on a ventilator.  Urine output was
approximately 1300 cc over an 8 hour shift.  General
examination - patient was intubated with eyes opening
spontaneously.  She was well nourished.  She had anicteric
sclera and moist mucous membranes.  Head, eyes, ears, nose
and throat - pupils were approximately 2 to 3 mm, symmetric.
She had secretions around the endotracheal tube.  Her neck
was supple but obese.  Cardiovascular examination:  Regular
rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated.
Lungs:  diffuse rhonchi.  Extremities:  no cyanosis, clubbing
or edema.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  Included CBC 15.7, 38.8 and 185
with a neutrophil count of 85 and 0 bands.  Patient had a
chem-7 performed which showed 139, 5.7.  She was hemolyzed,
103, 25,26 and 1.3 with a glucose of 154.  Calcium 9.9,
magnesium 2.4, phosphorus 3.8.  Coagulation profile within
normal limits.  Urinalysis showed a moderate amount of blood,
30 protein and 15 ketones, 3 to 5 white blood cells and many
bacteria with less than 1 epithelial cell.  Liver function
tests, amylase and lipase were within normal limits.  Cardiac
enzymes showed CPK of 1238 with an MB of 11 and a troponin of
2.1.  A head CT was also performed without contrast which
showed no intracranial hemorrhage or edema.  A lumbar
puncture was subsequently performed which showed white blood
cells in tube one of 61 and red blood cells of [**Pager number **]  Tube
number 4 showed white blood cells of [**Pager number **] and red blood cells
of 68.  She also had protein of 83 and glucose of 101.  She
had toxicology screen performed which was negative.

Given the above lumbar puncture results the patient was begun
on acyclovir 500 mg intravenous times one and Vancomycin 1
grams intravenous times one in the Emergency Room.  She was
subsequently sent to the medical Intensive Care Unit.  While
in the medical Intensive Care Unit the patient had an MRI
performed which showed mild meningeal enhancement and
question of temporal lobe enhancement suggestive of HSV.  She
subsequently had an HSV PRR done which was negative. Her
troponin leak and increased CPKs were attributed to her fall
and stress.  She was not thought to have an myocardial
infarction given her flap MPs.  After admission to the
Surgical Intensive Care Unit the patient had abdominal pain
which was presumed to be acalculous cholecystitis.  She had a
cholecystotomy tube put in the bile never grew any bacteria.
This was done because she was considered a poor surgical
candidate at the time. The patient also ad seizures while in
the Surgical Intensive Care Unit and was therefore Dilantin
loaded.  Patient self extubated herself and remained stable.
She was subsequently transferred to the floor for further
evaluation.  While on the floor the patient's main issue was
her nutritional status.  She was seen by Speech and Swallow
and by nutrition who felt that given her improving mental
status she may be able to swallow shortly.  However, given
her mental status she would require a great amount of time to
do so.  On discharge to [**Location 13698**] the patient had the following
issues:

1) In terms of her neurological status the patient was seen
by neurology who felt that her mental status had great
possibility for improvement and she could perhaps be close to
baseline within a couple weeks of time. They also felt that
she should be continued on her Dilantin with her level being
approximately 12 on discharge. They felt that the Dilantin
should be continued for approximately three months and then
slowly tapered off.

2) In terms of infectious disease with this history of
meningitis and question of encephalitis and question of
cholecystitis the patient should be continued on Ampicillin,
Ceftriaxone and acyclovir until [**2178-3-10**] to complete her
course for meningitis.  She should also be continued on
Flagyl until [**2178-3-8**] for her cholecystostomy tube.  The
cholecystotomy tube may be removed in six weeks.

3) In terms of her feeding, electrolytes and nutrition
patient should have a video swallow performed to assess her
swallow function.  If the patient still has difficulty with
swallowing perhaps a nasogastric tube or a gastric tube
should be placed.  This will need to be discussed with the
family.  In the meantime the patient was continued on
peripheral nutrition including PPN and possibly TPN.

4) Endocrine. With her history of diabetes and
hypothyroidism the patient was continued on NPH, her home
dose with which she was well managed. She also had a regular
insulin sliding scale to accompany.  The patient was given
Synthroid for her hypothyroidism intravenous.

5) Cardiac.  With her history of coronary artery disease,
status post coronary artery bypass graft, the patient was
begun on intravenous Lopressor.

6) Pulmonary.  the patient was seen by respiratory therapy.
She was subsequently titrated off nebulizers, switched
to inhalers and on discharge was saturating well on room air.

7) Prophylaxis.  The patient was given intravenous cimetidine
given her poor nutritional status and she was also put on
subcutaneous heparin for her poor mobility.

Given the above the patient will be transferred to an acute
rehabilitation center to further improve her physical
conditioning and her nutritional status.  The patient was
discharged in stable condition.  Her discharge medications
included albuterol inhalers 4 puffs q 4 p.r.n. shortness of
breath, Atrovent nebulizers 1 nebulizer q 6 p.r.n. shortness
of breath, metoprolol 2.5 mg intravenous q 6 given as
intravenous piggyback, ceftriaxone 2 grams intravenous q 12,
albuterol nebulizers 1 nebulizer q 4, cimetidine intravenous
20 mg intravenous q 12, Synthroid mcg intravenous q.d.,
insulin 70/30 26 units q A.M. and
