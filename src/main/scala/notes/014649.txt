DISCHARGE LABS:
[**2179-5-26**] ECG:
Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Diffuse non-diagnostic
repolarization abnormalities. No previous tracing available for
comparison.

[**2179-5-26**] MRI Brain:
IMPRESSION:
1. Marked interval enlargement of gyriform right occipital
enhancing mass
with marked worsening of adjacent vasogenic edema. The gyriform
pattern and associated restricted diffusion are most suspicious
for "metastatic" lymphoma from the patient's known systemic
lymphoma.
2. The other foci of enhancement in the left posterior temporal
lobe and left cerebellar hemisphere show continued decrease in
prominence.

[**2179-5-27**] ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
akinesis/aneurysm of the basal inferior and inferolateral
segments. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2).
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
mild focal LV systolic dysfunction. Diastolic dysfunction.
Likely severe calcific aortic stenosis (low-output, low-gradient
AS).

[**2179-5-28**] Head CT:
IMPRESSION: Right occipital lobe parenchymal hemorrhage
following biopsy.

[**2179-5-29**] Head CT:
IMPRESSION: Increase in size of right parietal intraparenchymal
hemorrhage, with increase in associated leftward midline shift.

[**2179-5-29**] Head CT:
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of right parietal intraparenchymal
hemorrhage with associated mass effect.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 85-year-old woman with history of lymphoma,
presenting with headaches and left visual cut, now s/p brain
biopsy showing CNS lymphoma, with course complicated by post-op
left sided weakness and hemorrhage at biopsy site now C1D4 MTX.

(1) CNS lymphoma:  Patient has known lymphoma diagnosed in [**2176**]
and found to have intracranial masses in [**2179-1-9**] but
symptoms had been stable and she was being monitored clinically.
 She now presented with headaches and left visual field cut, and
was subsequently admitted to the neurology service.
Neurosurgery was consulted and the patient underwent a brain
biopsy on [**2179-5-28**] consistent with CNS lymphoma.
Post-operatively, the patient developed a new left hemiparesis,
a CT head showed a hemorrhage in the post-op tumor bed with
cerebral edema.  She received Mannitol x1 and Decadron 10mg x1.
Her repeat Head CTs showed stability of the bleed, and her left
sided weakness slowly improved.  She also had a restaging torso
CT on [**6-3**] concerning for malignant nodules within a background
of infectious/inflammatory process. She was transferred to the
oncology floor where methotrexate was initiated which she
tolerated well.  She was continued on leucovorin until her blood
methotrexate levels cleared.  Her urine pH was monitored to
ensure alkalotic urine.  She was continued on dexamethasone
during treatment which was tapered to 4mg q12 hours. Of note,
patient was seen by ophthalmology who felt that she did not have
ocular lymphoma contributing to her visual symptoms.  She was
maintained on IV morphine and oxycodone in-house for her
headaches.  Patient was discharged with appropriate oncology
follow up.  Plans for next round of MTX will be done at [**Hospital1 4494**] under the supervision of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

(2) UTI:  Urinalysis drawn for very slightly elevated
temperature to 99.1 F.  Urinalysis borderline with cultures
growing Klebsiella sensitive to ciprofloxacin. She was treated
with 3 day course of ciprofloxacin starting [**2179-6-8**], last day
[**2179-6-10**].

(3) Depression:  Clinically stable.  She continued on sertraline
200mg daily.

(4) Hyperlipidemia:  Continued atorvastatin 80mg daily.
