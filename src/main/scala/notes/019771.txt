History of Present Illness:
60 year old male with h/o seizure disorder, ESRD on HD,
nonischemic cardiomyopathy (EF40-45%), remote h/o MI and CVA,
and hepatitis B who presented to the ED after a witnessed
seizure today.

He apparently left AMA from his rehab facility on Friday in
order to be the guest speaker at a conference in [**Hospital1 789**] on
Saturday.  He had lived at the rehab since [**5-2**].  He left
without any prescriptions and reports not taking his
anti-epileptics for the last 4 days.  Today he went to HD and
then was planning to go to the pharmacy to pick up his
medications.  However, on the way he reportedly had a seizure
and a bystander called EMS (he doesn't remember the incident).
Does endorse that he is "getting over a cold."  Also reports not
eating anything today at all.

In the ED, initial vitals were BP 100/60 HR 109 RR 18.  He
arrived "post-ictal" and had two further seizures ("generalized
tonic clonic and focal right-sided motor seizures" per ED
records).  Fingerstick glucose was 44.  He was given 1 amp D50,
Ativan 1mg x 1 then 2mg x 1.  CT head and C-spine showed no
acute process (final reads pending).  He was placed in a
c-collar.  He initially had BP of 80's/50's and was given 1L IVF
with subsequent normal BP.  He then had recurrent hypotension to
70's/40's with MAPs in the 50's and was given another 1L of IV
fluid.  ECG showed a LBBB.  He also was noted to have a
laceration of the right eyebrow that did not require suturing.
Neuorology was consulted and recommended keppra 1g IV x 1 and to
resume his home meds when able to take oral medications.  They
also recommended medicine admit with neurology consult to
follow.  He was also given a dose of levaquin as he may have
aspirated during his seizure.  Vitals on transfer were BP 102/58
HR 102 99%3L.

Review of systems: Denies any recent fever, chills, shortness of
breath, chest pain, dizziness, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea,
urinary symptoms.  Denies peripheral edema, PND, orthopnea.
Does endorse constipation at times.  Also states has had left
knee swelling since a fall 6 weeks ago.  He was last admitted to
[**Hospital1 18**] in [**7-2**] with seizures in the setting of medication
noncompliance.

Imaging:

[**9-26**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia. Since the previous tracing there is
no significant change in previously noted findings.

[**9-26**] CT head: 1. No evidence of acute intracranial process. 2.
Generalized atrophy. [**9-26**] CT C-spine: 1. No evidence of acute
fracture or malalignment.  2. Enlarged heterogeneous thyroid
with calcifications. Correlation with prior imaging and clinical
history recommended.

[**9-26**] CXR: No definite signs of pneumonia in this limited
radiograph.

Brief Hospital Course:
60 year old male with h/o seizure disorder, ESRD on HD,
nonischemic cardiomyopathy (EF40-45%), remote h/o MI and CVA,
and hepatitis B who presented to the ED after a witnessed
seizure.

#. Seizure Disorder: Admitted to the MICU after multiple
seizures.  It was felt that his seizures were due to
noncompliance in the setting of leaving rehab AMA without
prescriptions.  He was loaded with Keppra IV 1g IV in the ED and
restarted on his home medications.  There was no evidence of
infection.  He did not have any additional seizures while in the
hospital.  His blood sugar was also noted to be low at 44 on
presentation.  Pt denies history of low blood sugar or diabetes.
 A1c was normal.  He did not have any additional episodes of
hypoglycemia.

#. Hypotension: He had transient hypotension in the ED,
responsive to small boluses of IV fluids.  It was felt that he
was intravascularly volume depleted in the setting of recent
dialysis.  His lisinopril was also held.  His blood pressure
improved as well with oral hydration.  He again had an episode
of hypotension after his next session of HD, during which he
remained asymptomatic.  BP improved with gentle IV fluids.  He
had no further episodes of hypotension while on the floor.

#. Left groin + skin culture: Pt has indwelling left femoral
catheter for HD.  Renal was concerned about the appearance of
the catheter, and sent skin cultures, which grew out VRE and
staph.  Pt given a dose of vanc at HD on Monday. Pt has no
complaints of pain at the site. Per renal, antibiotics (vanc)
were continued at dialysis through [**2118-10-7**] (felt that VRE
likely contaminant).  Blood cultures show no growth to date but
will need final follow up.

#. ESRD on HD: Continued to be dialyzed on MWF, and continued on
sevelamer, calcium acetate, lanthanum.

#. Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and h/o MI: No complaints of
chest pain.  Continue home ASA and statin, held ACE-I initially
due to hypotension.

#. Anemia: Hematocrit at recent baseline.  Continued on home
folic acid and ferrous sulfate.

#. Thyroid abnormality: Incidentally found to have enlarged left
thyroid with calcificaitons.  Also has had parathyroidectomy in
the past.  TSH was normal, and pt advised that he should have a
thyroid ultrasound after discharge for further evaluation.

#.  Disposition: When he was medically ready for discharge, Mr
[**Known lastname 2026**] came up with a plan to stay at a local hotel until he is
able to secure his own apartment at the end of this week.
Although there was initially some concern about the safety of
this plan, pt was AOx3 and deemed to be competent to make his
own decisions regarding his medical care and disposition.  He
was also able to ambulate independently wi
