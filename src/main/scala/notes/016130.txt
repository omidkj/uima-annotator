History of Present Illness:
40 year-old woman with CHF, HTN, COPD, morbid obesity, sleep
apnea, hypoventilation presented with bleed around the trach
called out of MICU. Pt had PNA in [**2-15**] and was trached at
OSH. She had been weaned off of ventilator and transferred to
rehab, then readmitted to OSH ICU on [**4-7**] for desaturations. Had
fevers to 102.6, blood-tinged sputum, no leukocytosis. CXR with
? R perihilar left basilar infiltrate. Bronchoscopy revealed
granulation tissue causing 40% occlusion of the trachea and the
trach was replaced on [**4-3**]. She was started on vanco/zosyn for
empiric HAP coverage. She was noted to have bleed around the
trach. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further mgmt and
possible opening of her tracheal occlusion with laser technique.
Pt was initially admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] ICU on [**4-8**]. CT Chest done
here (results below) with ?aspiration pneumonia. Bronch
performed by IP on [**2116-4-9**] showing diffuse nodular lesions
involving the mid/distal trachea suggestive of an bacterial or
viral infection, bloody secretions and tracheomalacia. During
admission, patient also noted to be in acute renal failure
likely from pre-renal etiology (Cr peaked at 2.5 on [**4-9**] from 0.6
at OSH). Anti-hypertensives were held (including ACEI), lasix
was held and creatinine now improvement with good urine output
in past 24 hours.
.
Pt remained stable in the ICU. Continued to have hemoptysis of
dark colored bloody sputum, no frank red blood. Hct 34.7-->
30.7. Pt denies any SOB or difficulty breathing. She is still
producing copious secreations that are blood-tinged. She is
asking repeatedly to go back to [**Hospital6 6689**].

         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.
         Please contact the Microbiology Laboratory ([**6-/2414**])
immediately if
         sensitivity to clindamycin is required on this
patient's isolate.

(carinii).
   FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):
      YEAST.
[**4-11**] STOOL C DIFF: negative
.
STUDIES:
CXR ([**2116-4-8**]): Moderate cardiomegaly. The mediastinum shows
bilateral enlargement. In the left lung apex, a rounded
parenchymal opacity with apparent spiculations is seen. The core
of the lesion has about 1.5 cm in diameter. This lesion requires
CT for exclusion of malignancy. No signs of overhydration,
relatively low bilateral lung volumes. No evidence of pleural
effusion. Tracheal tube in situ.
.
CT CHEST: 1. Multifocal paramediastinal high attenuation
consolidations in both upper and lower lobes suspicious for
aspiration of blood given the provided clinical history. There
is no intracavitary lung lesion. 2. Findings suggestive of
tracheo- bronchomalacia, especially of the left main bronchus.
.
Bronch w/ BAL [**2116-4-9**]: A small amount of bloody secretions were
noted at the distal end of the tracheostomy tube which were all
suctioned clean. Evaluation of the airways revealed diffuse
nodular lesions involving the trachea suggestive of an infection
of either bacterial or viral etiology. Bloody secretions were
seen in the entire length of the trachea. Also, tracheomalacia
was evident with normal respiration.
.
RLE US with dopplers ([**2116-4-11**]): No evidence of DVT of the right
lower extremity.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 23239**] is a 40 year-old woman with history of CHF, HTN,
obesity, sleep apnea who presented from an OSH with
hospital-acquired pneumonia, hemoptysis, and tracheomalacia.
.
# Hemoptysis: Bronchoscopy revealed diffusely friable tissue in
the trachea with diffuse nodular lesions, oozing blood, and
diffuse bronchitis. This was felt to be most like a viral
tracheitis with concern specifically for HSV given the nodular
appearance. She was initially in the ICU and quickly transferred
to the floor. Hematocrit remained stable. On the day after
transfer to the medical floor she had several episodes of
hemoptysis and desaturations, felt due to mucus plugging. The
increased hemoptysis was attributed to aggressive endotracheal
suctioning. With less suctioning, the hemoptysis completely
resolved. Repeat bronchoscopy on [**4-14**] showed one blister in the
trachea, no bleeding. She was treated wit
