Service: Neurosurgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 62-year-old
gentleman, who was transferred from Life Care Rehab with
mental status changes with increased lethargy and urinary
incontinence.  He had recently been admitted under Dr.[**Name (NI) 14019**] care on [**2150-10-31**] for hydrocephalus and status post
a VP shunt placement, also had a history of subarachnoid
hemorrhage, who was treated conservatively at [**Hospital6 14430**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Subarachnoid hemorrhage.
2. Hypertension.
3. Bell's palsy.
4. Interventricular hemorrhage on CT 1.5 years ago.
5. Status post right eye surgery.
6. Status post VP shunt on 12/[**2149**].
7. PEG tube 12/[**2149**].

ALLERGIES:  No known allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  On physical exam, his temperature was 97.8,
heart rate 64, blood pressure 148/80, respiratory rate 20,
and sats 94% on 4 liters.  Neurologically, patient was
lethargic, responded appropriately, oriented to place, time,
and person.  Pupils were dysconjugate.  Left fixed and
dilated at 5 mm.  The right was 5 mm and nonreactive to
light.  Can move midline to lateral gaze.  Cranial nerve V
decreased on the left, but cranial nerve VII has a left
facial droop, which is old.  Cranial nerves IX, X, and [**Doctor First Name 81**]
intact and symmetric.  Motor exam:  His strength was [**3-24**] in
his upper extremities and lower extremities.  He had no
pronator drift.  His sensation was grossly intact.  His
reflexes are 2+ throughout.  His toes were downgoing.

He had a MRI with DWI for question of embolic stroke.  He had
a urinalysis, sputum culture, and chest x-ray, and tox
screen.

Patient is admitted to the Medical service and worked up for
a possible meningitis.  However, the patient had no signs or
symptoms or meningitis and no LP was recommended at that
time.  Patient had no white count and no fever making shunt
infection less likely.

Patient also had a chest CT to rule out PE, which was ruled
out.  Chest x-ray showed retrocardiac infiltrate.  EKG was in
normal sinus rhythm.  Head CT showed question of a left
putaminal lacunar infarct, but no bleed.

The patient was intubated for respiratory failure and
distress on [**2150-11-23**].  On [**2150-11-24**], patient had a lumbar
puncture performed with an opening pressure of 24, closing
pressure of 19, CSF was sent for culture.  CSF results show a
glucose level of 8, 1 white cell, 210 red cells, 22 polys, 68
lymphocytes, opening pressure of 24.

MRI shows restricted diffusion in the insular cortex, which
is unlikely to explain his current symptoms.  No evidence of
any other infarcts.  He continues to show communicating
hydrocephalus, which has not improved since VP shunt.  His
opening pressure was 24 on admission on his LP.

Patient had a repeat LP done on [**2150-11-25**] with an opening
pressure of 36, closing pressure of 15, 25 cc of CSF was
sent.  The patient was preoped and went for a VP shunt
revision.  Postoperatively, the patient's eyes were closed.
He shook his head yes and no to appropriate questions.  His
grasps were 3+ bilaterally.  Wiggles toes on the right,
minimally withdrawn on the left leg.  Right pupil is trace
reactive.  Left is nonreactive.  Remained neurologically
stable, this was on [**2150-11-25**].

Patient was extubated on [**2150-11-26**], and then immediately
reintubated because patient was unable to maintain a
protective airway.  CT showed decreased hydrocephalus and
size of the ventricles.  Patient on [**2150-11-28**] became
unresponsive.  Had a head CT, which showed enlarged
ventricles.  Had a LP performed, and the patient became
responsive again.

On [**2150-11-29**], neurologic exam:  Patient would squeeze the
right hand to command.  Did not open his eyes.  Pupils fixed.
Neurology was consulted regarding question of seizure
activity.  CSF cultures were sent.  He had an EEG, which
showed slowing, but no epileptiform activity, and his mental
status deteriorated on [**2150-11-29**].  His pupils were fixed and
dilated.  He had no corneals, no oculocephalic reflex.
Absent cold caloric reflex and no response to sternal rub.

CSF was sent for fungal culture, cryptococcal cytology, AFB.
Infectious Disease was consulted.  He recommended treating
the patient with vancomycin 1.5 grams IV q.12, ceftazidime 1
gram IV q.8, and amphotericin 1 mg/kg IV q.d. to treat for a
question of a nosocomial meningitis despite no pleocytosis on
CSF, but there was an elevated protein and decreased glucose
level.

On [**2150-11-30**], the patient had no corneal reflexes.  Had a
positive gag reflex.  No withdraw to pain in the upper or
lower extremities.  Head CT showed hydrocephalus again.
Therefore, a vent drain was placed on [**2150-11-30**].  The protein
level on CSF was 111, glucose is 53.  Patient remained
unresponsive.  No oculocephalic response, no corneals, no
gag, no response to painful stimulation in the upper or lower
extremities.

Continued to deteriorate, and family was approached by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] in discussion of his condition.  The family has opted
to make the patient comfort measures only, and the patient
expired on [**2150-12-2**] at 6:58 p.m.

Addendum:  a post-mortem was performed and returned with
meningeal carcinomatosis, please see pathology report.
