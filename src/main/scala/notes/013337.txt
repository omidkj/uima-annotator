History of Present Illness:
65 yo woman with hx of PVD, HTN, CRI presents with lower
extremity weakness and numbness which has been ongoing for 6
weeks. The pt reports that about six weeks ago she started to
have some hives over her arms and then developed severe pain in
her arms. Her w/u at [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital1 1474**] was negative and she
decided to have "shots" into her spine, done by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 62314**] in
[**Location (un) 2498**]. The initial injection brought her relief, however she
also developed some numbness in her finger tips. She then had
her 2nd injection and started to feel unbalanced afterwards,
leaning more to the left. She fell once. Then she had her 3rd
injection and immediately afterward fell again. In between the
injections she also started to note weakness in her legs and new
onset ptosis of her R eye with double vision. She saw a
neurologist who attributed it to "bell's palsy". She denies any
incontinence of stool or urine.  She states she has lost 37
pounds over the past 2 months.
.
ROS: negative for CP, SOB, abdominal pain, diarrhea,
constipation, f/c/ns, dysuria, changes in the color of the urine
or stool, n/v/ bowel or bladder incontinence, palpitations.
.
In the ED, initial vitals 98.1, 76, 151/57, 18, 98% on RA, the
pt was seen by ortho spine. No decreased sphincter tone. No
medications were given.

[**2101-1-2**] MR C/T SPINE
1. Signal abnormality within the T7 vertebral body with
enhancing component extending into the epidural space at this
level concerning for a neoplastic process. Probable abnormal
signal is seen within the cord at this level suggestive of
edema. 2. Probable area of signal abnormality within the pons
appears to be demonstrated on limited views, that in retrospect
appears to be confirmed on the dedicated MRI brain. It is likely
an area of chronic infarction.
.
[**2101-1-2**] CT TORSO W/ CONTRAST
1. No paraaortic masses present.
2. Large prevascular and pretracheal lymph nodes, concerning for
malignancy as described above. Clinical correlaion is
recommended.
.
[**2101-1-3**] MRI HEAD
Findings. There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses,
mass effect, or infarction. There are periventricular white
matter hyperintensities suggesting chronic small vessel
ischemia. There is no abnormal enhancement after contrast
administration. Conclusion: Chronic small vessel ischemic
changes, otherwise normal study.
.
[**2101-1-7**] BONE SCAN
1. Focal increased abnormal uptake in the T7 vertebral body
consistent with
osseous metastasis. 2. Atrophic right kidney. 3. Degenerative
change as
above.
.
[**2101-1-12**] MRI HEAD
FINDINGS: Since prior exam, there has been no significant
interval change. No new intracranial mass lesion, hydrocephalus,
shift of normally midline structures, minor or major [**Month/Day/Year 1106**]
territorial infarct is apparent. Stable appearance of the
multiple T2 hyperintense foci in the periventricular white
matter suggestive of chronic microvascular infarcts, as well as
the solitary left paracentral pontine lesion, also probably a
chronic lacunar infarct, are both observed. Following
intravenous contrast administration, no abnormal enhancement is
noted. IMPRESSION: No significant interval change from the prior
study, without clear indication as to the cause of the right
sided ptosis. As was discussed today ([**2101-1-14**]) with the house
staff, follow-up dedicated imaging of the orbits and cavernous
sinuses, as well as MR angiography, could be helpful.
.
[**2101-1-13**] T7 BONE/TISSUE BIOPSY
1. T7 bone biopsy #1 (A-B): Malignant neoplasm, most likely
carcinoma.
2. T7 bone biopsy #2 (C-D): Malignant neoplasm, most likely
carcinoma.
3. Epidermal soft tissue (E-F): Malignant neoplasm, most likely
carcinoma.
4. Bone tissue tumor (G-H): Malignant neoplasm, most likely
carcinoma.
Note:  Immunohistochemical studies for keratin AE1/AE1, CAM 5.2,
and chromogranin show focal immunoreactivity.  No
immunoreactivity is seen with LCA, synaptophysin, or TTF-1.
Additional stains will be performed, and reported in an
addendum.
.
[**2101-1-14**] T7 MASS BIOPSY FLOW CYTOMETRY
Non-diagnostic study.  Cell marker analysis was performed but
was non-contributory in this case due to insufficient number of
lymphoid cells for analysis.

Left cephalic vein thrombosis at antecubital fossa. The
remainder of the veins of left upper extremity are unremarkable.

The patient has a known T7 lesion. There are bilateral spinal
rods and a right IJ line as well as skin staples. Metallic
densities overlie two disc levels in the mid thoracic spine.
Lucency in this area are presumably relates to the site of
recent surgery. Fine assessment of bony detail somewhat limited
by high-contrast technique. Some scattered [**Month/Day/Year 1106**]
