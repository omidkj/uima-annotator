History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 17385**] is a 40 year old Caucasian male with a past
medical history of morbid obesity, steroid dependent psoriatic
arthritis, insulin dependent type II diabetes mellitus,
obstructive sleep apnea on CPAP and multiple recent admissions
for a left lower extremity wound/cellulitis s/p wound VAC
presenting from a rehabilitation facility with episodes of
shortness of breath, hypoxemia and palpitations. At the
rehabilitation facility he was receiving vancomycin and Zosyn
for a left lower extremity cellulitis. The patient was evaluated
in the ED on [**2204-9-12**] (4 days prior to this presentation) for a
question of cellulitis and an elevated INR. General surgery was
consulted and recommended conservative management and no
antibiotics. The physicians at the rehab disagreed with the
decision to withhold antibiotics and started vancomycin and
Zosyn upon his return to the facility. The cellulitis stems from
an open wound which is the result of multiple surgeries
performed on his left lower extremity. He initially presented in
[**2201-12-28**] with an idiopathic fluid collection in his left
lower extremity seen on CT performed for calf pain and erythema.
He has undergone at least 6 separate operations including I&Ds,
debridements and fasciotomies. His recovery has been complicated
by wound healing difficulties, thought to be secondary to
immunotherapies for psoriatic arthritis.

Briefly, concerning his LLE wound:
-[**Date range (2) 35634**]: Admitted to medicine for cellulitis, treated
with Vanc/Zosyn
-[**Date range (3) 35635**]: Patient presented with fever, worsening LLE
erythema, and pain while on Vancomycin and Zosyn. In the ED,
left tib/fib XR demonstrated subcutaneous gas concerning for
necrotizing fasciitis in the medial left proximal to mid calf.
He was taken emergently to the OR for LLE incision and
debridement. Some tissue and gas released medially, but no
extensive tissue necrosis was noted. Intraoperative wound
cultures were negative. Washout and dressing changes were
performed on [**2204-8-3**], followed by wound VAC placement on [**2204-8-5**].
Patient taken to the OR again on [**2204-8-6**]. He was treated with
vancomycin and Zosyn until [**2204-8-13**].
-[**Date range (1) 35636**]: Patient with low grade temperature and
increasing redness and drainage from the left leg wound. Wound
vac was removed, and there was a concern for pus in the wound.
Patient was admitted to general surgery for IV antibiotics, no
procedural interventions performed at that time.
-[**2204-9-12**]: Patient presented to the ED for erythema around the
wound vac. General surgery consulted and felt this was normal
healing and did not recommend further antibiotics. The
rehabilitation facility felt antibiotics were warranted;
initiated vancomycin/Zosyn.

Mr. [**Known lastname 35620**] recovery has also been complicated by pulmonary
emboli discovered on a CTA chest at an outside hospital on
[**2204-8-19**]. The CTA was performed for tachycardia, lightheadedness
and an O2 saturation of 81%. The CTA was 'suboptimal' due to
incorrect contrast bolus IV timing. The CTA was repeated upon
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] and demonstrated: scattered non-occlusive
emboli in the left lower lobe segmental arteries, without
evidence of right heart strain or pulmonary infarction. He was
treated with a heparin drip at the time and discharged to a
rehab facility with a heparin drip and escalating doses of
warfarin. He need a prolonged course of IV heparin due to his
apparent warfarin resistance. Per the patient and his wife, on
[**Name (NI) 766**] of this week (6 days PTA) while at rehab the patient had
a recurrent episode of tachycardia, pulsatile tinnitus,
shortness of breath, and hypoxia to 93% on RA.  He required 6L
NC to get to 95% on RA. He was brought to [**Hospital6 5016**]
and had a repeat CTA showing no new PEs; his tachycardia and
hypoxia resolved over several hours. Saturday at 5pm (1 day PTA)
he again experienced pulsatile tinnitus, tachycardia and an O2
saturation of 85%; he required 8L of O2 to get his saturation to
the mid 90s. This resolved but then similar episodes occurred
Saturday night and Sunday morning, finally dropping to 74% on RA
Sunday morning.  At that point he was placed on a NRB at rehab
and was transferred to HFH and then to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.

In the ED, initial VS were T 98.3 HR 82 BP 121/72 RR 16 Sat 96%
3L Nasal Cannula. The patient had an ECG which was normal sinus
rhythm with frequent PVCs. His INR was 1.9. CTA from HFH
reviewed w/ radiologist: no evidence of new PE to subsegmental
level. B/l small pleural effusions. Blood cx were sent and he
received a dose of Zofran 4mg IV x1 and Dilaudid 2mg IV x1.

On arrival to the floor, VS T 98 BP 159/72 HR 98 RR 22 O2sat
97%RA. The patient reports improved breathing; he denies current
cough, shortness of breath, fevers and chills. He notes
significant weight gain and abdominal distension over the past
week. He estimates that he has put on approximately 28 lbs since
restarting IV antibiotics. He states he has been using his CPAP
at rehab and has no prior history of these episodes of shortness
of breath.
