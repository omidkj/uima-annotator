Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1406**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain, dizziness


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2163-5-27**] Aortic valve replacement with 23mm Trifecta tissue valve


History of Present Illness:
84M male known to cardiac surgery service with significant
aortic stenosis who presented to the ED on [**5-22**] with complaints
of chest pain, dizziness and diaphoresis. He reports that he was
getting dressed in his rehab facility when he developed chest
pressure, dyspnea, lightheadedness, nausea and vomiting. He was
given O2 and 325mg of aspirin at the facility and his symptoms
resolved
prior to arrival at the emergency department. He reports
exertional angina for the past few years which resolved at rest,
but had not had presyncope or syncope until recently.  He was
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**157-5-28**] for syncope. He admitted at
that time with worsening substernal chest pressure, radiation to
L arm, lightheadededness and a syncopal event which lasted 5
minutes. He was found to have NSTEMI from demand secondary to
critical AS.  He was evaulated at that time for open high risk
AVR vs Corevalve and it was recently decided by the family and
the patient to decline enrollment in the study and proceed with
open AVR.  Cardiac surgery was reconsulted for evaluation.

patient.
Conclusions
PRE-CPB:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. Moderate
spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial
appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler.

There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-50 %). The RV is
normal sized with borderline normal free wall function.

The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The descending thoracic
aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. No thoracic aortic dissection is
seen. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are severely
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). Mild to moderate ([**11-29**]+) central aortic
regurgitation is seen.

The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate calcification of the posterior annulus. Mild to
moderate ([**11-29**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

POST-CPB:
After initial separation from bypass, a bioprosthetic valve is
seen in the aortic position with a paravalvular leak likely
localizing to the area of the left coronary cusp. The jet is
eccentrically directed across the face of the aortic valve. CPB
is reinitiated for repair of paravalvular leak.

After second separation from bypass, the bioprosthetic valve is
again seen in the aortic position. The valve is well seated with
normally mobile leaflets. There is trace centr
