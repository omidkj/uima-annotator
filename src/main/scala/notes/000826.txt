EGD:

 Protruding Lesions 4 cords of grade I varices were seen in the
lower third of the esophagus.
Stomach:
 Mucosa: Erythema, congestion and mosaic appearance of the
mucosa were noted in the whole stomach. These findings are
compatible with portal hypertensive gastropathy.

tylenol for pain (max dose of 2 grams per day).

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 51 yo F with h/o ETOH cirrhosis with varices, chronic
pancreatitis, and asthma, who presented with hematemesis after
binge drinking. She was initially admitted to the ICU,
stabilized, and then called out to the general medicine floor.
The following is her course by problem.
.
# Upper GI bleed: Initially admitted to the ICU and started on
octreotide gtt. Admission hct was 32.7, stable from 32.8 several
days prior. Hct dropped to 28.8 the following morning after
hematemesis and roughly 3L IVF. The hct has remained roughly
stable since without transfusion. EGD [**2182-3-21**] showed 4 cords of
grade I varices at the lower third of the esophagus with portal
hypertensive gastropathy and 2 small nonbleeding ulcers in
duodenum.  She was continued on [**Hospital1 **] PPI, carafate, and
prophylaxis with cipro for a 3 day course. Hct remained stable
at 30 at discharge.
.
# Alcoholic cirrhosis: The patient has met with SW during
previous admissions and attempts have been made to arrange for
detox and patient has had difficulty with compliance with
recurrent etoh use and missed appointments. T Bili and LFTs
elevated mildly above baseline on admission. She has remained
off lasix/aldactone over past month due to numerous binges/poor
po intake. Lactulose and nadolol were continued. Hepatology
followed the pt while in house, and the pt has follow up with
hepatology in [**4-27**].
.
# ETOH abuse/withdrawl: Pt has a history of DTs in the past.
She was treated here with valium per CIWA scale, thiamine, and
folate.
.
# Abdominal pain/Chronic pancreatitis: Pt had epigastric pain
with guarding on exam. Likely due to both vomiting, ulcers,
gastropathy, and chronic pancreatitis. Patient treated briefly
with IV narcotics, changed to po and then discharged off opiates
due to her well-documented history of opiate abuse.  On multiple
occasions, she attempted to manipulate the medical staff to
maintain IV opiates for pain or to increase her pain med doses.
Her complaints of pain were out of proportion with her
functional status.  She threatened to leave AMA when her
narcotics were changed from IV to oral.  However, this was still
done and she backed down and stayed in hospital.
.
# Asthma: Noted mild wheezes on exam. Advair was started and pt
received Albuterol nebs PRN.
.
# Pancytopenia: Likely due to marrow suppression from ETOH abuse
as well as splenic sequestration. Platelets in 30s, hct stable
at 28.  Last iron studies were borderline, and B12/folate were
WNL.
.
# Tobacco abuse: Written for nicotine patch
.
# Coagulopathy: secondary to cirrhosis.
.
