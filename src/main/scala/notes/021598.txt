[**2194-6-30**] CXR
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Evaluation of the patient after
carcinoid resection
from the left lung.

S/P resection of left main bronchus carcinoid with surgical
fractures of the
fifth and sixth left chest ribs. There is no sizable
pneumothorax or pleural
effusion. There is mild subcutaneous emphysema. The left lung is
almost
completely expanded.

[**2194-7-5**]  CXR
FINDINGS: There has been interval removal of the left chest
tube. There
continues to be left pleural thickening with probable effusion.
There
continues to be mediastinal shift to the left, likely due to
left lower lobe
volume loss. Scarring and opacities overlying the left lung are
unchanged.
