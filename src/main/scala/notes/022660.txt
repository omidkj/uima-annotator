HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 55-year-old woman with
a history of hypercholesterolemia who presented to an
outlying hospital with complaints of bilateral arm pain and
substernal chest squeezing experienced on exertion while she
was helping her son lift boxes. The patient had been in her
usual state of health until approximately 3 p.m. on the day
of admission when she developed substernal 8/10 chest pain
lasting for approximately 45 minutes.  She describes it as a
pressure/wheezing that was associated with lightheadedness
and nausea.  The pain persisted until she presented herself
to [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 **] Emergency Room where an EKG demonstrated
1.[**Street Address(2) 1755**] elevations in leads 2, 3, and AVF with [**Street Address(2) 4793**]
depressions in 1 and AVL, right sided leads showed ST
elevations in V4R.  She was started on Aspirin, Heparin,
Nitroglycerin drip and was given Morphine with persistent
chest pain.  She then developed bradycardia down to the low
20's with hemodynamic compromise and hypotension and required
approximately one minute of CPR and Atropine.  Her heart rate
then went up to the 60's to 70's.  At that point she was
given TPA 15 mg bolus over 2 minutes, 50 mg bolus over 30
minutes, followed by 35 mg over 60 minutes which led to
resolution of her ST segment changes and resolution of her
pain.  She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] Emergency Room for further evaluation.  On
arrival she was pain free and admitted to the CCU for further
management.  She received two liters normal saline en route
to [**Hospital1 69**].  On arrival at [**Hospital1 1444**] her vital signs were pulse of
69, blood pressure 115/70 without chest pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypercholesterolemia.

MEDICATIONS:  Prempro, Fosamax.

ALLERGIES:  Sensitivity to succinylcholine, sensitivity to
Codeine.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Grandmother on both sides with coronary
artery disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs, temperature 99, blood
pressure 100/60, pulse 60, respiratory rate 16, oxygen
saturation 98% on 50% face mask.  General: Well developed
woman in no apparent distress.  HEENT:  Normocephalic,

7.38, PO2 128, PCO2 31, O2 saturation 98% on two liters nasal
cannula.  Chest x-ray [**8-30**], mild CHF with small right and
possibly small left pleural effusions.  Chest x-ray [**2163-8-31**],
patchy opacity posterior basal segment of right lower lobe
which may represent atelectasis or pneumonic consolidation in
the proper clinical setting.  Based on the appearance of the
frontal radiograph, this area appears slightly improved when
compared to the prior study.  Interval improvement in the
upper zone redistribution likely reflecting improving mild
CHF with small bilateral effusions.

EKG #1 at outlying hospital, sinus rhythm at 60 with
rightward axis and intervals, [**Street Address(2) 1766**] elevations in 2, 3, and
AVF with [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions in 1, AVL and T wave inversions
in AVL, V1 to V3.  #2 at outlying hospital, sinus rhythm at
60 with rightward axis, normal intervals, small Qs in 2, 3,
and AVF and persistent T wave inversions in AVL.  EKG #3 at
[**Hospital1 69**], sinus rhythm at 100
with rightward axis and normal intervals, normal ST-T waves
in 2, 3, AVF and T wave flattening in AVL, right sided leads
without ST elevations in V4R.

IMPRESSION:  54-year-old woman with history of
hypercholesterolemia admitted with acute inferior MI status
post TPA therapy at outlying hospital and transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for further management.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiovascular:  The patient's clinical history and data
were consistent with acute inferior MI with possible RV
involvement given her transient hypotensive episode that
responded to normal saline boluses and Atropine.  The
resolution of her chest pain and ST segment changes after TPA
was reassuring, however, the patient required careful
monitoring given her hemodynamic instability at the outlying
hospital.
A)  Coronary arteries:  Patient was continued on Aspirin,
Heparin drip and Nitroglycerin drip to titrate the pain to be
helped for a systolic blood pressure of less than 90.  The
lipid panel was sent and was within normal limits, however,
in the peri MI period, lipid panel can be falsely decreased
and should be rechecked in four weeks and treated
appropriately with statins if increased.  The patient's CKs
and troponins were cycled and her CK peaked at 836 on the
morning of [**8-30**] and then continued to decrease.  The
patient's hematocrit and platelets were monitored closely
given her recent TPA treatment as well as her Heparin drip
and these remained stable.  All of her stools were guaiac
negative.   On the morning of [**8-30**] before her cardiac
catheterization the patient did have a 15 beat run of
ventricular tachycardia.  This was thought to be
peri-ischemic and she was followed without anymore runs of V
tach noted or other events.  On the morning of [**8-30**] before
her catheterization the patient did complain of chest
discomfort which responded mildly to increase in her
Nitroglycerin drip and sublingual Nitroglycerin.  Her EKG was
unchanged on that morning.  Morphine was avoided in the
patient given her history of episode of hypotension and the
risk of causing decreasing preload with Morphine.  The
patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory
on [**8-30**] with results showing LMCA long but normal LAD, mild
proximal disease, mid segment with 50-60% stenosis after the
D2 branch left circumflex R1 normal non dominant OM1 with
moderate mid segment disease.  RCA dominant vessel proximal
moderate disease distal vessel with 80% hazy lesion, PTCA of
her right coronary artery with stent was placed.  Her post
catheterization EKG did show some right bundle branch block
which resolved the following day on [**8-31**].  Her sheaths were
removed the day of catheterization and she did develop a
small hematoma which was controlled with prolonged pressure.
The patient was placed on Lopressor 12.5 mg tid which was
increased to 25 mg tid on [**8-30**].  She was also placed on
Plavix 75 mg q d and started on Captopril 25 mg tid.  Because
of slight hypotension, her Captopril was changed to Zestril 5
mg q d on [**9-1**] and she was discharged home on this.  Her
Lopressor 25 mg tid was changed to Toprol XL 50 mg q d on
discharge for a one daily dose.
B)  Myocardium:  The patient had possible RV involvement
given her hypotensive episodes and significant bradycardia.
She was gently hydrated overnight on the night of admission
before her catheterization.  Her hemodynamics remained stable
except for [**8-30**] when she was mildly hypotensive.  No diuresis
was given to the patient.  Morphine wa
