History of Present Illness:
77 year old male with multiple medical problems, pertinently
including coronary artery disease status post CABG with CHF and
EF 30-35% as of [**2157**], hypertension, and chronic renal
insufficiency, who is transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital after
an admission for pancreatitis complicated by pseudomonal UTI,
asystolic cardiac arrest, and respiratory failure.

The patient actually had a prior hospitalization in [**Month (only) 958**] of
[**2163**] when he presented with epigastric pain and was found to
have "abnormal liver function tests." Ultrasound demonstrated a
hepatic mass, confirmed by CT scan. MRI, demonstrated a 5.5 x
5.6 cm lesion in the posterior segment of the right lobe of the
liver, however it did not enhance and seemed more consistent
with focal fatty infiltration. His AFP level was normal, but CA
[**75**]-9 was elevated at 260. His hepatitis serologies were
negative. It is unclear what happened subsequently, however he
represented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on [**3-13**], again complaining of
abdominal pain radiating to the back, with nausea and vomiting.
He was found to have elevated amylase and lipase (1324, and 3500
respectively), consistent with pancreatitis. Total bili was 2.6,
with a direct fraction of 1.9. ALP 466, GGT 810, AST 210, ALT
170. A repeat CT scan again demonstrated a heterogeneous 5 cm
mass in the liver, as well as multiple gallstones. He was seen
by GI who felt that the picture was most consistent with
gallstone pancreatitis, however given the extent of alkaline
phosphatase elevation, with only minimal bilirubin elevation,
and the intrahepatic mass, they suggested ERCP, with possible
liver biopsy as well, for further workup.

While there, however, he developed respiratory distress on the
floor and was transferrred to the ICU where he desaturated and
had an asystolic arrest. He was intubated, and received 2 rounds
of epinephrine and atropine with 2 minutes of CPR. He regained a
rhythm, which reportedly was an SVT. He required pressors for a
period of time, and had a hematocrit drop requiring multiple
units of PRBCs. He was felt to have mucous plugged, and had a
bronchoscopy on [**3-20**] which demonstrated rective bronchial cells,
histiocytes, and neutrophils, but had no growth on cultures. He
was weaned off of pressors and extubated on [**3-21**], however
failed, thought secondary to pulmonary edema secondary to CHF,
and ended up getting reintubated on [**3-25**]. After diuresis they
were in the process of performing an SBT, however he
self-extubated on [**3-27**]. He was placed on 100% nonrebreather, and
ultimately required non-invasive positive pressure ventilation
on the day of transfer, though we have no ABGs. His chest x-ray
on [**3-27**] demonstrated enlarged heart with worsening pulmonary
edema, as well as left lower lobe consolidation and pleural
effusion. He failed a speech and swallow test, raising concern
for aspiration pneumonia.

His hospital course was otherwise complicated by rising BUN and
creatinine, for which a renal consult was called. His BUN seemed
to be rising out of proportion to creatinine (BUN 102,
creatining 1.9, up from 36 and 1.4, respectively, on [**3-18**]),
raising the question of GI bleeding, versus a pre-renal azotemia
from aggressive diuresis. The decline in renal function also
seems to have been after his cardiac arrest, therefore
hypotension could have contributed as well.

1) Coronary artery disease status post CABG in [**1-/2158**],
post-operative course complicated by sternal wound infections
(Oxacillin sensitive staph aureus) requiring drains, plastic

3) Congestive heart failure: Ejection fraction of 30% to 35%
with 1+ mitral regurgitation.
4) Diabetes
5) Chronic renal insufficiency

7) Hypercholesterolemia
8) Peripheral vascular disease, status post iliac stenting
9) Transient ischemic attacks, status post carotid
endarterectomy.
10) Hypothyroidism
11) Chronic renal insufficiency (baseline 1.1 in [**2157**])
12) Alzheimer's Disease
13) Vancomycin resistant enterococcus UTI in [**3-/2158**]
14) Gastroesophageal reflux disease
15) Status post abdominal aortic aneurysm repair

Imaging:
[**2164-3-28**] - CXR: There is complete opacification of the right
hemithorax increased compared to the previous film with leftward
deviation of the mediastinum thus suggesting atelectasis of the
left lung, most likely due to mucous plaque. The increase in the
diameter of the right pulmonary vessels suggesting fluid
overload.

1. 5.2 x 5.3 cm heterogeneous mass in the posterior aspect of
the right lobe of the liver. Differential diagnosis includes
metastatic disease or pseudocyst with internal debris. MRI could
be performed for further characterization.
2. Questionable mass in the left lobe of the liver with focal
dilatation of the left intrahepatic biliary ducts. Differential
diagnosis includes metastatic disease or cholangiocarcinoma.
This questionable mass can also be evaluated with MRI.
3. Peripancreatic soft tissue stranding suggestive of
pancreatitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 77 year old male with significant cardiac
history, including CAD status post CABG in [**2157**], CHF with EF
30%, chronic renal insufficiency, and AF with slow response,
admitted to [**Hospital1 1474**] with probable gallstone pancreatitis, but
also with recently discovered hepatic mass, course complicated
by respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and a pseudomonal
UTI.

1) Respiratory failure: This was felt to be multifactorial
secondary to his underlying poor pulmonary mechanics
(paradoxical chest wall movement) leading to mucous plugging,
CHF, and hospital acquired pneumonia. He completed a course of
antibiotics of linezolid and zosyn. He was initially on NIPPV
but subsequently developed mucous plugging and LLL collapse. He
had a bronchoscopy for mucous c
