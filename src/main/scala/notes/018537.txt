History of Present Illness:
Code stroke called at 4pm for R side weakness
.
History is per EMS, chart and friend/witness/caretaker([**Name (NI) 95638**]
[**Name (NI) **],
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 95639**])
.
HPI: 78-yo female with no known seizure disorder who presents
here after a seizure. She has had a gradual decline over the
past month, needing a caretaker to help her get to medical
appointments, pay her taxes and take care of finances. She has
remained able to feed and dress herself and walk independently,
but slowly. She has had visual hallucinations over this time
period, speaking to people she had seen on TV. Her speech has
been normal but rambling and repetitive.
.
Per her friend/caretaker, Ms. [**Last Name (Titles) **], the patient had a doctor's
appointment the day of admission at 3pm and she contact[**Name (NI) **] Ms.
[**Known lastname **] to remind her to get ready at 11am. Her friend came
around 2:30pm to take the patient to the appointment (PCP: [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1726**], [**Hospital1 **]). The patient had difficulty
opening the door but finally was able to do so. Her friend found
her standing in the [**Doctor Last Name **], saying that she could not see and
wanting to find her glasses. But she did not walk to do so. Per
the friend, she "looked like she was blind".
.
She told her to sit down but again the patient did not move. She
brought a chair behind her and sat her down in it. She then went
to call the doctor's office. While she was speaking to the RN,
the patient straightened her right arm, as if she was "reaching
for something" and she was leaning to her left. Her eyes then
rolled back and she had bilateral convulsions and lost
consciousness. 911 was called. On EMS arrival, they found her
unresponsive to voice with right hemiparesis and she was brought
here. En route, her right arm/leg weakness resolved, leaving
only right facial asymmetry.
.
On our arrival, the patient was awake and alert. She would
occasionally vocalize, for example, saying "wait a minute! wait
a minute! what are you doing?" when moved to the CT table. She
would not follow commands. At times, she uttered non-sensical
speech.

ROS: On review of systems, the pt's caregiver denied recent
fever or chills.  No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain.
Denied cough, shortness of breath.  Denied chest pain or
tightness, palpitations.  Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation or abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or
bladder habits.  No dysuria.  Denied arthralgias or myalgias.
Denied rash.

Pertinent Results:
CT [**2154-5-15**]
Left occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage is little changed in
appearance, currently measuring 4.8 x 2.5 cm in greatest axial
dimension. As before, hemorrhage is in contiguity with the left
subdural space, and acute left subdural hematoma is again seen,
unchanged. Local edema and mass effect on the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of
the left lateral ventricle is similar, and there is mild, 4 mm
rightward subfalcine herniation, similar to previous exam. There
is no intraventricular blood. Basal cisterns are not effaced.

Periventricular white matter hypodensity, most prominent in the
left frontal lobe most likely represents chronic small vessel
ischemic disease. [**Doctor First Name **] ganglia calcifications are unchanged.

IMPRESSION: Unchanged appearance of left occipital
intraparenchymal hemorrhage, with left subdural hematoma, and
local mass effect on the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral
ventricle. Unchanged mild rightward subfalcine herniation.

EEG [**5-16**] This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and
disorganized background admixed with bursts of generalized mixed

frequency slowing consistent with a mild encephalopathy
suggesting
dysfunction of bilateral subcortical or deep midline structures.

Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the
common
causes of encephalopathy but there are others. There were no
areas of
prominent focal slowing although encephalopathic patterns can
sometimes
obscure focal findings. There were no clearly epileptiform
features.

PATH clot [**5-20**]: Clinical: Intraparenchymal bleed, left.
Gross:  The specimen is received fresh labeled with the
patient's name "[**Known lastname **], [**Known firstname 55617**]" with the medical record number
and "blood clot".  It consists of multiple fragments of blood
clot measuring 1.8 x 1.5 x 0.7 cm in aggregate. The specimen is
entirely submitted in A-B.

CT [**5-22**]
No significant interval change compared to one day prior. The
patient is status post left parietal craniotomy. Again seen is a
moderate sized left parietooccipital hemorrhage with extensive
surrounding edema and additional foci of blood anteriorly. There
is a stable amount of pneumocephalus related to the craniotomy.
Intraventricular extension of blood and blood clots within the
lateral ventricles are stable. Ventricular size is stable. When
accounting for head position and slice selection, there is no
appreciable change in mass effect, rightward midline shift of
the midline structures and unchanged asymmetry of the
perimesencephal
