Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4765**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p v-fib arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
central line placement, arterial line placement, s/p intubation,
cardiac catheterization, ICD placement

History of Present Illness:
67 yo M with PMH significant for HTN, DM found to be in v-fib
arrest and transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for further
management. The patient was in his car this AM and rolled into
the car ahead of him. This was witnessed by a police officer who
found him slumped over in his car. He received 1 cycle of CPR
and an AED was placed that showed VF and was shocked x1 with
conversion to sinus tach. He was only down for a few minutes.
The patient had spontaneous movement at the scene. He was
intubated by EMS in the field and given 100mg IV lidocaine. The
patient was transported to [**Hospital3 **] and given 2g Mg,
150mg IV bolus of amiodarone, followed by 1mg/hr. His CE at the
OSH were trop I 0.03, CK 129. His ECG showed sinus tachycardia.
Labs were significant WBC 11.9, UA [**6-2**] WBC, 3+ bacteria, mod
epis. CXR showed well positioned ET tube, perihilar pulm edema
and no other acute abnormality. He was given 5mg pancuronium x2
and 4mg versed prior to transfer and cooling. He has PIVx2 and
right leg I/O. He was started on Arctic Sun protocol and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

STUDIES:
TTE ([**2148-1-17**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size. There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the distal [**1-28**]
of the left ventricle. There is mild global hypokinesis of the
remaining segments (LVEF = 35-40%). No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
high normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal cavity size and mild regional and global systolic
dysfunction. Mild mitral regurgitation.
.
TTE ([**2148-1-22**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with focal hypokinesis of the apex without aneurysm. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 55-60 %). The
estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). The aortic
valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2148-1-17**],
apical function is improved.
.
Head CT ([**2148-1-16**]): 1. No acute intracranial abnormality.
2. Air-fluid level in the sphenoid sinus and mild ethmoid
mucosal thickening. Clinical correlation recommended.
Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 50871**] [**Name (STitle) **] at 11:55 p.m. on
[**2148-1-16**].

NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: There is some loss of the normal
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation, diffusely, and likely sulcal
effacement over the convexities (given the patient's age),
suggestive of diffuse cerebral edema. The ventricles and
cisterns are preserved, and there is no evidence of herniation.
As above, there is no hemorrhage or sign of vascular territorial
infarction.
.
Head CT ([**2148-1-18**]): FINDINGS: Since examination from [**2148-1-23**],
there has been little interval change. There is no increasing
hypodensity to suggest evolving infarction.  The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
matter differentiation is preserved with appearance of the sulci
stable since examination from [**2148-1-16**] and slightly less
conspicuous.  There is stable appearance of basal ganglia
calcifications. Ventricles and sulci are normal in size and
appearance. Redemonstrated is an air-fluid level within the
right side of sphenoid sinus and mild mucosal thickening of the
bilateral ethmoid sinuses. Incompletely imaged are several oral
tubes, likely orogastric and endotracheal tube. Evidence of
prior left lens surgery.

IMPRESSION: No evolving hypodensity to suggest evolving
infarction. Stable appearance of sulci which are slightly less
conspicuous for the age-stable since examination from [**2148-1-16**].
Clinical correlation is recommended as CT is less sensitive in
the detection of cerebral edema. Other details as above.
.
CXR ([**2148-1-16**]): ET tube tip is 4.3 cm above the carina. There is
mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly. NG tube tip is out of view below
the diaphragm likely in the stomach. The side port is just
distal to the GE junction. There is diffuse alveolar opacity in
the perihilar regions and in the upper lobe. These are
consistent with pulmonary edema. There is mediastinal widening
likely due to engorgement of mediastinal vessels. There is no
pneumothorax or large pleural effusions.
.
CXR ([**2148-1-26**]): The position of the leads is unchanged since the
prior chest x-ray. One lies in the right
