Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8850**]
Chief Complaint:
Peripheral Edema.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known firstname 1439**] [**Known lastname **] is a 56-year-old woman with history of
metastatic breast cancer affecting brain and lungs, sarcoidosis,
coagulopathy, presenting with lower extremity edema for the last
3 weeks.

Patient reports that she has noticed the lower extremity edema
since starting dexamethasone as part of her chemotherapy, as was
noted in her neuro-oncology visit note.   Patient reports she
began having pain in her right leg that was worse with walking.
She also reports having "cold like symptoms" with a [**Known lastname **] and
some runny nose, denies any fevers or chills.  Patient decided
to come into the ED after her symptoms were not improved with
Tylenol.

In the emergency department patient vitals were T: 97 HR: 114
BP: 127/103 O2 Sat:93% on 4L.  Lower extremity ultrasound was
obtained to evaluate for DVT, CTA of the chest ordered to rule
out PE.  Patient received vancomycin and levofloxacin for
suspected post obstructive pneumonia.  Patient also given 500 ml
of saline bolus.  Patient noted to have transient desaturations
to mid 80's with movement.  Given tenuous stauts, patient
admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for close monitoring.

==================

IMAGING STUDIES:
[**2162-5-1**] LENIs: No DVT

[**2162-5-1**] CTA chest:
1. No definite evidence of pulmonary emboli.
2. Extensive lung masses and nodules involving both lungs, which
appears to have increased when compared to prior exam. Some of
these masses appear to encase the distal segmental pulmonary
arteries.
3. Extensive ground-glass opacity and septal thickening. This
could represent lymphangitic spread or edema.
4. Hypodense lesions in the liver concerning for metastasis and
fluid within the perihepatic space.
5. Sclerotic lesions in the lower thoracic vertebral bodies with
compression deformities.
6. Large left pleural effusion and small right pleural effusion.


[**2162-5-1**] CT head:
1. Unchanged small hyperdense foci in the right cerebellar
hemisphere within a known metastasis. Otherwise, no acute
hemorrhage.
2. The extent of metastatic disease is better assessed on the
[**2162-4-26**] MRI.
[**2162-5-4**] CT Abd/Pelv (to r/o IVC obstruction)

IMPRESSION:
1. Attenuation of the intrahepatic IVC due to extensive hepatic
metastatic
disease, without evidence of severe stenosis or thrombus. The
infrahepatic
IVC and iliac veins remain patent.
2. Known pulmonary metastases. Worsened ground-glass opacity
within t
