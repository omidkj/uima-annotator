Service:  VASCULAR

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Left leg dry gangrene and ulcerations.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Information was obtained from
discharge summaries and the patient.  The patient is a
reliable historian.

The patient is a 61-year-old white male with extensive
cardiac history consisting of coronary artery disease,
ischemic and alcohol cardiomyopathy, who over the last four
months has been in hospitals and rehabilitation for cardiac
respiratory problems and has developed foot and leg
ulcerations which have not resolved with conservative
treatment.

The patient admitted to left greater than right leg
claudications since his mid 30s but has been wheelchair-bound
since [**Month (only) 116**] of last year.  The patient has been hospitalized in
our institution from [**2140-2-13**], to [**2140-2-17**],
for congestive heart failure which has been compensated and
then on [**2-19**] to [**2140-2-23**], for urinary tract
infection which is treated.  The patient returned for
intravenous antibiotics, wound care and vascular evaluation.

ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.

Lisinopril 5 mg q.d., Lasix 20 mg q.d., Thiamine 100 mg q.d.,
Folic Acid 100 mg q.d., Multivitamin 1 tab q.d., Zantac 150
mg b.i.d., Flovent 110 mcg 2 puffs b.i.d., Desipramine 30 mg

History of left varicose veins with stasis ulcerations.
History of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  History of
depression.  History of intravenous drug abuse; has not used
intravenous drugs in the last 20 years.  Recent compensated
congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 40%.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  This is a 61-year-old, single male, who
lives alone.  He has a 38 pack-year history of smoking.  He
has not had any alcohol since [**2140-2-23**].  He has been
wheelchair and bed bound over the last 2-4 months.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Afebrile.  General:
Depressed, tearful male.  HEENT:  Unremarkable.  Pulse:
Palpable carotids bilaterally, with diminished right carotid,
with a [**3-8**] right carotid bruit.  The radial pulses were
palpable bilaterally.  The femorals were palpable but
diminished in intensity.  There were no femoral bruits.
Popliteal dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses absent
by palpation.  Chest:  Lungs clear to auscultation with
increased AP diameter.  Heart:  Regular, rate and rhythm but
distant in auscultation.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Abdomen:  Soft with increased girth with increased venous
prominence with enlarged liver edge.  No bruits or masses
were noted.  Musculoskeletal:  The left anterior tibial area
with linear excoriations with a clean base; no exudate or
odor.  The left malleolar ulcer was with fibrinous base.  The
left foot dorsal ulcer times two with fibrinous base.  No
exudate or odor.  There is muscle wasting of the upper and
lower extremities.  Neurological:  Unremarkable.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Vascular
Service.  He was begun on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl
given that he had been hospitalized multiple times and
admitted to rehabilitation centers.  PVRs were obtained on
[**2140-3-4**], which demonstrated significant bilateral
aorto-iliac arterial disease with no Dopplerable left
popliteal or pedal pulses.  The metatarsal pressure on the
right was 4 mm and on the left 2 mm.

Labs included a CBC with a white count of 13.6, hematocrit
31.7, platelet count 33k; PT and INR were normal; BUN was 16,
creatinine 0.6, potassium 4.0; ............... were normal.
The wound cultures grew gram-positive cocci, pairs and
clusters, coag-positive, Staphylococcus aureus.

Cardiology was requested to see the patient for perioperative
risk assessment.  Cardiology felt that the patient was in
intermediate risk factors for planned surgery and that we
should increase his Lopressor dosing to what his blood
pressure and pulse rate will tolerate and increase the
Lisinopril as tolerated for blood pressure.  No other
interventions at this time.

After reconsideration and discussion with Cardiology, the
patient was amendable to a cardiac catheterization.  He
underwent a right and left heart catheterization, coronary
angiography, abdominal aortic and right iliac femoral
angiography.  The study demonstrated three-vessel disease not
easily amendable to high risk angioplasty intervention,
severe right iliac and femoral atherosclerotic disease.  The
patient is not a candidate for intra-aortic balloon support
without PTA stenting of the iliac system.  Severe pulmonary
arterial hypertension was found, in addition to decompensated
systolic and diastolic heart failure.

The patient was transferred to the Cardiac Unit for
management of his congestive failure.  He was placed on
diuretics.  He was afterload reduced with Nitroglycerin, and
ACE inhibitors were begun, in addition to beta-blockers.

The patient was transfused preoperatively for a hematocrit of
27.  Postoperative transfusion hematocrit was 32.2.

Aspirin was held.  The patient showed significant improvement
in his heart failure, and Cardiology felt we could proceed
with a leg amputation.  The Nitroglycerin was weaned.

The patient underwent on [**2140-3-8**], a left AKA without
complication.  Postoperative electrocardiogram was without
acute changes.  Postoperative hematocrit was 28.5.  BUN and
creatinine remained stable.  Initial CK total was 130.

Postoperatively the patient was transferred to the SICU for
continued monitoring and care.  The patient remained stable
over night.  There were no acute events.  He was transferred
to the VICU for continued monitoring and care.

After reevaluation of the patient, the [**Hospital 228**] transfer to
the VICU was held.  He remained in the SICU to continue
cardiac monitoring and afterload reduction.

By postoperative day #2, the patient continued to diuresis on
oral agents.  His diet was advanced as tolerated.  His
hematocrit remained stable at 27.9.

The patient was transferred on postoperative day #2 to the
VICU for continued care.  The patient required a second unit
of packed red blood cells.  His posttransfusion hematocrit
was 30.6.  This was given because of his significant cardiac
history.  The patient continued to do well from a hemodynamic
standpoint.  His congestive heart failure was compensated.
He was delined and transferred to the regular nursing floor
on postoperative day #3.

Social Service did see the patient for emotional support.
Psychiatry was requested to see the patient, and they felt
that the patient had multiple medical problems and had a
history of depression and polysubstance abuse.  At the
present time, his mental status is currently more depressed
in context with the recent AKA and news regarding his cardiac
catheterization results, as well as the lack of social
support system.  The patient does not verbalize suicidal
ideation and does not appear to be an acute safety issue.
His Zoloft dosing was continued at 200, as well as
Desipramine at 30 mg q.h.s.  His Trazodone was increased to
200 at h.s.

Recommendations were made to be specific about treatment plan
and that once he is discharged, he should be followed by
Psychiatry at the rehabilitation facility he is transferred
to.  At the time of discharge from the rehabilitation
facility, the institution should contact [**Hospital6 25259**] Center to arrange for appropriate psychiatric
follow-up.  The patient's primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) 25260**], has notified the [**Hospital 778**] Healthcare Service regarding
the [**Hospital 228**] transfer to rehabilitation.

At the time of discharge wounds were clean, dry, and intact.
Staples were intact.  The patient was stable from
