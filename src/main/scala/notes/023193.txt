Chief Complaint:
right foot pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
NONE


History of Present Illness:
78 yo M with IDDM, AF on coumadin, CAD, dCHF presenting with
right foot pain. Patient reports that his right foot has been
red for some time, but in the last 2 days it has become painful,
and he is unable to ambulate. He fell out of bed several days
ago, banging his right knee and the right toes, with worsening
redness, however it was red before that event. He has had
chills, but did not take his temperature at home. He reports
urinary frequency but denies dysuria. He also reports shortness
of breath but no chest pain, no worsening LE edema.

In the ED, initial vital signs were 97.3 120 136/74 18 96%. Exam
was consistent for LE cellulitis, and xray of the foot showed no
evidence of subcutaneous air or fracture. Labs were notable for
WBC of 14.1 with left shift, Cr 1.8 (baseline), and positive
urinalysis. Patient received 1g IV vancomycin, 1 L NS and 5mg IV
morphine and was transferred to the floor for further
management.

On arrival to the floor, initial vital signs were 97.5 110/60 97
20 99% 2LNC. Patient reports pain in the right toe and mild
shortness of breath.

Imaging:
CXR [**2105-8-18**]:  In comparison with the study of [**2103-7-11**], there is
continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette in a patient
with intact midline sternal wires.  No definite vascular
congestion.  There is increased opacification at the right base
medially.  This could represent merely crowding of vessels
combined with atelectasis.  However, in the appropriate clinical
setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered. The
left hemidiaphragm is relatively well seen, though there may
well be some atelectatic change involving the left lower lobe.


Brief Hospital Course:
78 yo M with h/o IDDM, dCHF, afib on coumadin presenting with
right foot pain, found to have cellulitis who was transferred to
the ICU on the night of his admission for dyspnea. Was treated
with abx for e coli UTI and cardiac meds were titrated. Pt was
stable and dc-ed to rehab.

#Reason for MICU transfer: on arrival to the floor, the
patient's temperature increased to 103 and he was tachycardic
with rates in the 160-170s and tachypneic and wheezy who met
SIRs criteria and was admitted to the ICU. While in the ICU, EKG
showed  ST depressions in lateral precordial leads. Cardiology
was consulted and EKGs showed resolution of these changes with
administration of IV metoprolol, therefore likely demand
ischemia.  His cardiac enzymes were cycled and normal.

#SEPSIS from urinary tract infection: Pt. met criteria for
severe sepsis given his tachycardia, fever, and leukocytosis on
admission with elevated lactate. On admission his UA was
positive.  He was febrile to 103 with altered mental status. In
the ED he received vancomycin. ON arrival tot he floor he
recieved ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone.  While in the MICU, his
lactate did not respond greatly to fluid resuscitation, his WBC
increased, and his MAP were between 55-65, so he was broadened
to vanc/cefepime with improvement in his clinical status. His
urine grew out
