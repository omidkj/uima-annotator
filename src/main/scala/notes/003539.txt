Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3705**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]F AF on warfarin (goal INR 3 as previous atrial emboli), s/p
MVR with tissue valve, history of DVT, PE (DVT [**11-19**], PE '[**57**]),
CHF/cardiomyopathy EF 15-20 %, HTN, previous strokes presenting
from rehabilitation where she is for a recent mechanical fall
complicated by lower back pain, recurrent UTI, A. fib on
Coumadin presenting with hypotension and leukocytosis from rehab
in the context of a long term indwelling foley. EMS was called
for asymptomatic hypotension at rehab (76/54) with initial EMS
VS BP 81/46 with repeat 82/49 and HR in 60s. The impression of
the rehab per note was no constitutional symptoms such as fever,
chills, or major change in clinical appearance. She was not
started empirically on antibiotics. It was favored to be an UTI
in setting of indwelling foley for urinary retention. Her WBC on
[**8-11**] was 8.4 with WBC 18.4 on [**2175-8-16**] with 91.5 % neutrophils.


Of note, she was recently hospitalized from [**2175-8-5**] to [**2175-8-10**]
with trouble coordinating her left arm and dysarthria in setting
of a fall at rehab. An extensive neurological work-up revealed
evidence of subacute infarction in right anterior parietal lobe
favored to be embolic. She was discharged to rehab.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 10 96.6 62 73/50 1 98% RA. Exam with
no focal findings except for cloudy urine in Foley catheter.
Labs significant for WBC 17, stable Hct although MCV 81, Diff N
85.1 L 9.8, lactate 2.2, Na 132, Cl 94, BUN 41, Cr 1.8 (baseline
1.3 - 1.6), Glc 108. UA significant for large LE, Bld, RBC 13,
WBC 35, Few Bacteria, CastHy 9. She was given linezolid 600 mg
IV x 1. CXR performed showing LLL opacification consistent with
atelectasis vs. early pneumonia cannot be excluded. Blood and
urine cultures were drawn. EKG showing atrial fibrillation, LBBB
similar compared to prior. She received 1 L of NS.

She was admitted for hypotension and presumed urosepsis. Sepsis
pathway not utilized secondary to improved blood pressure with
IVF resuscitation in setting of low EF.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with a past medical history of atrial
fibrillation with previous stroke, CHF with EF 15-20%, HTN, and
previous MVR and a chronic indwelling foley found to be
hypotensive, a result of UTI and medications.

# Complicated Enterococcus UTI.  Urinary tract infection is
complicated given chronic foley placed and WBC 17 in setting of
hypotension.   Given her history of [**Age over 90 **] UTI, she was started
empirically on linezolid ([**2175-8-16**]), as well as
piperacillin/tazobactam for possible pneumonia.  Her white count
fell by the following morning and her lactate normalized and
piperacillin/tazobactam was stopped.  Patient was then
transitioned to linezolid and cefepime.  When sensitivities of
the infection returned as enterococcus, patient was transitioned
to ampicillin.  Her white count decreased and she was afebrile.
Her foley was removed and patient was able to void without
difficulty into diapers which were changed appropriately.
Patient is to finish PO course of PO ampicillin on [**8-27**].

# Hypotension.  Differential diagnosis for hypotension is quite
broad and includes cardiac versus metabolic versus
medication-related including large dose of home torsemide (30mg
TID), oxycodone which the patient is on secondary t
