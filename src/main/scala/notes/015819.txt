s/p fall down 8 steps

PICC line placement


History of Present Illness:
83M with CAD (MI [**09**] years ago, CABG #1 30 years ago at [**Last Name (un) 1724**], CABG
#2 20 years ago at [**Last Name (un) 1724**]), ICD/PCM who was in his usual state of
health until [**10-6**] when he fell while carrying a door up some
stairs. He was taken to an OSH where he was awake but
perseverating. He then started vomiting.  He was paralyzed and
intubated to protect his airway. He wastransferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
where a Head CT showed SAH (massive SAH, bilat SDH. Downward
transtentorial herniation. Effacement of the midbrain
bilaterally, uncal herniation cannot be excluded. Occ fracture
extending to the foramen magnum).
.
His course is complex and is summarized in the following
follows.  He was intubated in SICU on admission. On admission,
he got 1 unit of platelets given.  On [**10-7**], he was febrile with
worsening head CT, however, he improved in respiratory status,
was able to wean down from vent.  Due to fever and concern for
aspiration PNA, sputum cultures were sent, blood culture
negative thus far.  He was extubated on [**10-8**].  On [**10-9**],
vanc/cefepime was started.  He had a fall from bed.  Subsequent
CT head showed no significant change.  He passed Speech and
Swallow.  The following day on [**10-10**], he was cleared from
c-collar. Echo showed EF of 20-25% with LV thrombus calcified.
He was restarted on home lasix. Renal function improving.  ABX
was dc'd as sputum showed 2+GPCpc/2+GPR/sparse yeast and no
fever.  He was cleared collar and tolerated POs.
.
Of note, CT Torso showed left upper lobe lung mass and
subcarinal enlarged node is seen. Just below this there is a 3.8
cm mass, difficult to be certain whether this is in the left
atrium or just extrinsic to it. There is also a calcified left
ventricle aneurysm with thrombus. Multiple hypodensities in
Splenic, left renal and left upper quadrant concerning for
metastases.  The is a left thyroid nodule, incompletely
evaluated.
.
On transfer: VS at transfer: afebrile, 125/70, HR 90-100, RR
20-30, 90-100% on NC.

Physical Exam:
PHYSICAL EXAM:
Gen: Intubated, sedated.
Ext: cold to touch
.
Neuro:
Off propofol: Pupils 3-2 mm, no corneals, no cough, no gag, not
over breathing the vent. No movement to BUE except for some hand
twitching to noxious. No movement with the BLE except for some
twitching of his toes to noxious.
.
At the time of discharge the patient's neurologic exam was
substantially improved. He was intermittently oriented x1-2 and
responsive to basic commands. He was moving all extremities.

CT Head:
Extensive SAH, R frontal ICH, bilateral SDH that appear chronic
with some acute component. Occipital nondisplaced fracture.
There
could be some blood at the midbrain with effacement. No
hydrocephalus noted.

CTA Head:
Pre-lim read prior to recons: negative for aneurysm. This was
discussed with the neuro-radiology attending.


[**10-6**] CT head - 1. Massive subarachnoid hemorrhage.
2. Bilateral subdural hemorrhages.
3. Occipital fracture extending to the foramen magnum.

Ct C-spine - No CT evidence for acute fracture or malalignment.
However,
severe degenerative changes puts the patient at risk for cord
contusion even with minor trauma

[**10-6**] CT C/A/P - 1. Left upper lobe lung mass and subcarinal
enlarged node is seen. Just below this there is a 3.8 cm mass,
difficult to be certain whether this is in the left atrium or
just extrinsic to it. There ias also a calcified left ventricle
aneurysm with thrombus. Cardiac echo suggeted.

2. Splenic, left renal and left upper quadrant complex
hypodensities,
concerning for metastases. This finding was discussed with

3. Right mainstem intubation.

4. Left thyroid nodule, incompletely evaluated. Ultrasound could
be performed
non-urgently for further evaluation

[**10-6**] CT-Angiogram - 1. Head CT has shown diffuse subarachnoid
hemorrhage with small bilateral subdural hematomas. The
subarachnoid hemorrhage is predominantly seen at the convexity
but also seen in the right sylvian fissure greater than left
side.
No occipital fracture is seen.
2. CT angiography of the head demonstrates no definite aneurysm,
vascular
occlusion, or high-grade stenosis.
3. CT angiography of the neck demonstrates vascular
calcifications, but no
evidence of high-grade stenosis or occlusion in the carotid or
vertebral
arteries.
4. Left upper lung mass, left mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and
upper lung
scarring are noted and correlation with the torso CT is
recommended.

[**2181-10-8**] CT BRAIN
FINDINGS: In comparison to [**2181-10-7**] examination, there has
been no
substantial change in the extent of the widespread
multicompartmental
hemorrhages. Bilateral subdural collections are again evident.
Subarachnoid blood, distributed throughout the bilateral
frontoparietal and temporal regions, with clot forming in the
right sylvian fissure, does not appear substantially increased
from the prior examination. There is no shift of normally
midline structures. A small amount of layering intraventricular
blood is evident, with no significant change in ventricular size
or shape to suggest developing hydrocephalus. The imaged osseous
structures and soft tissues are unremarkable. The sphenoid
sinuses are partially opacified in this intubated patient.

IMPRESSION: Extensive multicompartmental, including subarachnoid
and subdural hemorrhage, as well as small amount of
intraventricular blood, stable when compared to the study from
[**2181-10-7**].

[**2181-10-9**] CXR
Heterogeneous opacification in the right lung is probably
largely pulmonary edema, since perihilar edema was already
present in the left lung yesterday and has worsened. Moderate
cardiomegaly is stable and there has been a slight increase in
mediastinal vascular caliber, which could be a reflection of
supine positioning rather than an indication of elevated central
venous pressure or volume. Left lower lobe consolidation has
worsened in the interim. Whether this is pneumonia or active
aspiration, or atelectasis or even asymmetric pulmonary edema is
radiographically indeterminate. Left upper lobe mass is a known
feature. Transvenous right atrial and left ventricular pacer
leads and right ventricular pacer defibrillator lead are in
standard placements. Calcified apical ventricular aneurysm is
also longstanding.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 37564**] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] intubated after OSH
imaging revealed SAH after fall down 8 stairs.  He was admitted
to NICU for further management.  A cervical collar was
maintained. But cleared on [**10-10**] after no reports of neck pain
and no fracture. The patient was admitted initially by
neurosurgery and subsequently transfered to medicine for further
evaluation of multiple medical conditions.
