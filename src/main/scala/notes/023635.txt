ADDENDUM

ADDITIONAL PERTINENT EVENTS:  That occurred during
hospitalization are as follows.
1.  Neurology.  The patient's mental status cleared
completely and he was back to baseline by the time of
discharge.

2.  Hematology.  The patient was anti-coagulated with
Coumadin 1 mg p.o. q day and had a therapeutic INR of 2.1 on
the day of discharge.  In terms of his thrombocytopenia, this
resolved completely with holding Heparin given his known
Heparin induced thrombocytopenia.  His platelet count on the
day of discharge was 168.

3.  Pulmonary.  The patient's pneumonia improved daily and we
continued him on a 14 day course of Levofloxacin and Flagyl.
We maintained him on overnight BYPAP pressure of 8 and 5 and
he did well with this.  We recommend that this be continued
for about a week after discharge to improve his postop
recovery.

4.  Cardiovascular.  From the standpoint of his congestive
heart failure we initiated a standing dose of Lasix.  This
was 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.  We recommend that once his edema
resolves that his Lasix dose be decreased to 20 mg p.o. q
day.  We initiated standing potassium at 20 mEq p.o. q day.

5.  Nutrition.  The patient continued with tube feeds through
his feeding tube during this admission.  On the final day of
hospitalization we initiated p.o. feeding with thick pureed
solids and honey thick liquids.  He tolerated this moderately
well and tired quickly.  We recommended tube feeds be
continued and perhaps a swallowing study should be performed
at rehabilitation.  However, prior video swallow study
performed in [**Month (only) 205**] of last year showed he aspirated thin
liquids.  Therefore, it was the opinion of the Speech and
Swallow service that starting him on the aforementioned thick
liquids was the appropriate even in the absence of a repeat
swallow study.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  He was discharged to Pulmonary
Rehabilitation with the intention of return to [**Hospital3 2558**]
next week.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.
