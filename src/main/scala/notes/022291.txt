None


History of Present Illness:
84 yo man with HTN, DM, CVA, COPD, and recent admission for ESBL
Klebsiella UTI treated with ertapenem who presented to [**Hospital 37895**] ED with history of recurrent falls. Patient had been
having recurrent falls for the past 2 days and was found on the
day of admission by the family to have fallen on the floor. He
was brought to [**Hospital 1263**] hospital ED, where he was felt to be
lethargic. Initial vitals at OSH were BP 145/64, P 86, R:16, and
the first noted temperature at 16:45 was 97.0, with a heart rate
of 43 at that time. Given the fall, CT Head and C-spine were
performed and were unremarkable as detailed below. He was then
transferred here because he gets most of his care at [**Hospital1 18**].
.
Patient's daughter accompanies him and provides most of the
history. Daughter's ex-husband had noted patient had been having
increased falls throughout the day. She also reports that
patient had [**4-21**] loose, voluminous bowel movements the day prior
to admission, which was very unusual for him. He had been
running to the bathroom and had been unable to make it on time a
few times. The daughter's ex-husband later heard a thud and
found the patient on the floor and brought him to the hospital.
The diarrhea was not noted to be bloody or contain mucous.
Patient recently completed a course of ertapenem for ESBL
Klebsiella UTI at [**Hospital1 18**]. He denied any fevers or chills, or any
other localizing complaints prior to ED visit.
.
In the ED here, initial vitals were HR 42, BP:119/42, RR:11,
O2Sat 97%. Temperature taken at 19:30 was 32.2. A warming
blanket was placed. Over the next 3 hours, temperature rose to
35.8 and heart rate rose to mid-60s. CT Abdomen was performed
because patient complained of abdmoinal pain and there was
concern for sepsis given hypothermia. This did not reveal any
infectious process. He received 500mg metronidazole empirically.

.
ROS: The patient denies any fevers, chills, weight change,
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation,
melena, hematochezia, chest pain, shortness of breath,
orthopnea, PND, lower extremity oedema, cough, urinary
frequency, urgency, dysuria, lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness,
focal weakness, vision changes, headache, rash or skin changes.

Imaging:
Head CT on [**2199-4-24**] at [**Hospital3 3383**] Hospital
No intraparenchmal or extraaxial hematoma.  Left frontal
encephalomalacia, c/w pervious contusion or infarction.
PRevious left thalamic lacunar infarction.  Diffuse ventricular
dilatation and widening of cortical sulci.  Periventricular
hypodensity c/w microangiopathy.  No acute hemorrhage or
infarction noted.
.
CT C-spine on [**2199-4-24**] at [**Hospital3 3383**]: No acute fracture.
.
[**2199-4-24**] CXR:
FINDINGS: Portable AP upright chest radiograph is obtained. A
large rounded density is again noted overlying the right lung
base which is seen on multiple prior chest radiographs and
thought to represent hiatal hernia. The lungs appear essentially
clear bilaterally and no evidence of pneumonia is appreciated.
No pleural effusions or evidence of CHF. The heart size is
normal. Mediastinal contour is unremarkable. There is no
pneumothorax. The visualized osseous structures are
unremarkable.
.
[**2199-5-9**] EEG:
This is a likely normal routine EEG in the waking and
drowsy states. There were no areas of prominent focal slowing
and there
were no epileptiform features. Of note, portions of the study
were
obscured by electrode or movement artifact and the patient
aborted the
study prematurely.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 year-old male with a history of HTN, DM, CVA, COPD, PVD, and
recent admission for ESBL Klebsiella UTI who initially presented
with bradycardia, hypothermia and abdominal pain. The following
issues were investigated during this hospitalization:
.
# Hypothermic, bradycardiac, unresponsive episodes - Pt's
initial presentation with this symptom constallation was
concerning for sepsis. Because this resolved quickly with
conservative measures, it did not appear that the pt was
infected. Following his initial course in the MICU, the pt' was
called out to the general medical floor where he had two
recurrent episodes (bradycardia, hypothermia, unresponsive, mild
hypotension with SBP to 90s and salivation). Given this, the Ddx
was expanded. An EEG was obtained which did not show evidence of
seizure activity. The pt's antihypertensive regimen was scaled
back significantly. Thyroid studies were unremarkable. It
remains unclear what caused these abnormalities, though they
resolved early into the hospital course and did not recur.
.
# Candidemia: Felt to be nosocomial. Ophthalmologic exam was
unremarkable. CT abdomen to evaluate the spleen and liver for
abscesses were unremarkable. Cultures eventually grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**] and patient received a total of 12 days of Caspofungin
prior to discharge from the hospital. This was continued for 2
additional days to complete a 14 day course on discharge.
.
# UTI: Cultures revealed VRE and patient completed a 7 day
course of Linezolid.
.
# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Thought most likely pre-renal
secondary to diarrhea. Creatinine remains moderately up from
baseline, but stable.
.
# Question LE vascular insufficieny: The pt was followed by the
vascular service while in house; LE arterial studies showed some
obstruction and he will f/u with vascular as an outpt.
.
# Anemia: Iron studies c/w mixed picture. Fe and B12 repletion
were continued. Consideration was given to epogen, though this
was deferred to a later time given the multiple ongoing medical
issues.
.
# H/o CVA: No acute issues during this hospitalization. ASA
325mg and simvastatin 20mg were continued.
.
# Psych: The pt was continued on his home doses of donepezil and
olanzapine.
.
# DM: Diet controlled, but maintained on Insulin sliding scale
while in-house, given infecti
