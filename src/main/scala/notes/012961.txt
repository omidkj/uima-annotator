CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypotension and falling hematocrit.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74-year-old
gentleman with a history of increased cholesterol and history
of hypertension who was complaining of exertional angina for
the past three to four weeks with increasing frequency and
severity, as well as pain radiating to his jaw.  He had a
positive exercise treadmill test on [**2196-5-7**] and was
subsequently admitted to an outside hospital on [**5-17**] for
cardiac catheterization which showed significant 3-vessel
disease including an right coronary artery 75% lesion, middle
circumflex 80%, proximal left anterior descending artery 40%,
ramus 70%, first diagonal 85%; although, he had a preserved
ejection fraction of 70%.

He was referred to [**Hospital1 69**] on
[**5-18**] for cardiac catheterization with intervention.  The
patient arrived on [**5-18**] chest pain free, good blood
pressure and underwent cardiac catheterization on [**5-19**]
through the left groin site.  The patient's cardiac
catheterization again revealed significant 3-vessel disease.
The patient underwent a proximal right coronary artery
intervention/stent of 3.5-mm X 15-mm stent was deployed in
the proximal right coronary artery.  In the holding area,
after the stent, the patient was noted to have some oozing
from the left groin site.  Pressure was held.  Subsequently,
the patient developed a drop in his blood pressure to 67/50
and a decrease in his heart rate to the 50s.  Thought this
was secondary to vagal tone after his right coronary artery
lesions and pressure on his groin.  The patient was given
2 amps of Atropine and was bolused with 2 liters of saline;
however, due to persistent hypotension, the patient was
started on dopamine.  The patient subsequently developed an
supraventricular tachycardia with a heart rate into the 160s
and rate-related ischemia with ST depressions in V1 to V3,
requiring Levophed transiently.

The patient was emergently taken back to catheterization for
a re-look.  At that point, the patient was intervened from
the right groin, and given his decreased blood pressure and
ischemic changes, he went for re-look catheterization which
showed no evidence of re-occlusion.  At that point, a
hematocrit was drawn which showed a hematocrit of 23.5.  The
patient's hematocrit was 32 at an outside hospital on
[**5-13**].  The patient was given a total of 6 units of packed
red blood cells; two in the holding area, two with the
re-look catheterization, and two in the operating room.

The patient was taken to the operating room emergently for
exploration of his left groin site for evidence of hematoma.
The patient was intubated in the operating room prior to
surgery.  In the operating room, it was negative for
hematoma, and the patient was noted to have a question of
hematemesis with pooling of blood in the oropharynx while in
the operating room; although, nasogastric tube in place was
returning bilious, the patient was transfused to the Coronary
Care Unit post groin exploration from the Postanesthesia Care
Unit intubated with marginal blood pressures.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypercholesterolemia.
2.  Hypertension.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  The patient is status post laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
2.  Herniorrhaphy.
3.  Appendectomy.
4.  Status post right hip replacement.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.,
atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d., Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.,
Zestril 10 mg p.o. q.d., terazosin 5 mg p.o. q.d.,
hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q.d., sublingual nitroglycerin
p.r.n.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco.  A World War II veteran.  The
patient is married with a daughter and son in close
proximity.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed a temperature of 98, pulse 73, blood pressure
of 90/53, respirations 12 to 14, satting 100%.  The patient
was ventilated on AC, tidal volume 700, grade of 12, FIO2
of 60%, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5, positive
inspiratory pressure of 23; first gas of 7.45/32/77.  In
general, an elderly male intubated and sedated.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose, and throat revealed pupils were equally round and
reactive to light.  The oropharynx with dried blood pooling
in the oropharynx.  There was no active ooze noted.
Endotracheal tube in site.  There was blood which was crusted
in the nares.  Jugular venous pressure not visualized.  Chest
examination revealed decreased breath sounds at the right
base; otherwise clear.  Cardiovascular examination revealed a
regular rate, no murmurs.  The abdomen revealed soft, bowel
sounds positive, and nontender.  Extremities revealed right
groin with a venous and arterial sheath in place.  Left groin
with a pressure dressing.  Faint posterior tibialis
bilaterally.  Skin revealed no evidence of rash.  On
neurologic examination, the patient was sedated.  Pupils were
reactive.  Genitourinary revealed the patient was
occult-blood negative, dark-brown stool.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on
admission revealed the patient's hematocrit was 32.5 status
post 6 units of packed red blood cells, platelets of 185,
white blood cell count of 17.8.  Coagulations were pending.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray revealed a right internal
jugular cordis in the superior vena cava and G-tube at the
gastroesophageal junction.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  (a)  Ischemia:  The patient was admitted
with unstable angina, status post right coronary artery
stent.  The patient had negative enzymes times three.  The
patient remained chest pain free after the intervention and
was started on aspirin, Plavix, and Lipitor.  Eventually,
when blood pressure tolerated Lopressor and Zestril were
added and titrated subsequently.  The patient to be
discharged on adequate doses of aspirin 325 mg p.o.,
Plavix 75 mg p.o., Lipitor 10 mg, atenolol 50 mg p.o., and
Zestril 10 mg p.o.  Again, no further episodes of chest pain
or jaw pain during his hospitalization.

(b)  Pump:  The patient was hypotensive on arrival.  He
subsequently dropped his pressures in the Coronary Care Unit
and was restarted back on Levophed.  An emergent bedside
echocardiogram was performed which was negative for
tamponade.  The patient was given two further units for a
total of 8 units of packed red blood cells.  Blood pressure
responded appropriately.  During the [**Hospital 228**] hospital
course, the patient was weaned off Levophed and eventually
restarted on his Lopressor and captopril as blood pressure
tolerated.

(c)  Electrophysiology:  The patient with a run of
supraventricular tachycardia after his dopamine; however, he
remained in sinus rhythm for the remainder of his stay.

2.  PULMONARY:  The patient was intubated on arrival to the
Coronary Care Unit.  The patient was initially on AC.  He was
kept sedated on a propofol drip; however, two after arrival
the patient was able to be weaned to pressure support and
eventually extubated.  The patient's arterial blood gases
remained well throughout his stay.  A chest x-ray was
performed which showed a question of left retrocardiac
opacity.  Given the patient's fevers in the setting of
respiratory distress, the patient was started on Levaquin for
a question of pneumonia.  After extubation, the patient's
saturations remained stable.  He was diuresed p.r.n., and
eventually the patient was stable back on room air (at 92% on
room air).

3.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient initially with a hematocrit
of 23.5.  This responded to 32 after 6 units.  Again, the
patient had a negative exploration of his left groin for
hematoma; however, given the high suspicion, the patient was
sent for a CT of the abdomen and pelvis which revealed a
4-cm X 6-cm hematoma in the retroperitoneum anterior to the
left psoas muscle.  Vascular was following.  However, it was
not intervened upon.  The patient's hematocrit remained
stable throughout his stay.  Again, he received a total of
8 units of packed red blood cells with hematocrit remaining
stable in the low 30 range.  The patient was to f
