History of Present Illness:
56 year-old woman with a history of obesity and hypertension who
was an unrestrained driver where the motor vehicle slid on ice
down a driveway, rolled down an embankment, and flipped over
into a creek. By report she was submerged for at least 20
minutes. After a lengthy extrication, she was found to be apnic
and have pulseless electrical activity. She was intubated and
ATLS protocol restored a pulse and blood pressure. She was
transferred via [**Location (un) 7622**] to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
Of note, [**Location (un) 7622**] personnel reported spontaneous eye opening en
route.

[**2112-1-30**] head CT: Persistent indistinctness of the great/white
matter differentiation, unchanged compared to the previous exam.
No acute hemorrhage. Patent basal cisterns.

[**2112-1-27**]: CT abd: 1. Patchy bilateral pulmonary parenchymal
opacities and atelectases. 2. No other evidence of acute
traumatic injury.

[**2112-1-27**]: CT cspine: Technically limited study. No evidence of
cervical spine fracture or dislocation. Scattered densities at
the lung apices, likely related to history of drowning.

[**1-30**] EEG: This is an abnormal discontinous 24-hour bedside EEG
telemetry from [**1-29**] due to bursts of
generalized
spike and slow wave discharges with intermittent brief bursts of

suppressed background. Under pentobarbital, the duration of the
depressed background increased and the bursts of generalized
spike and
slow wave discharges decreased during burst suppression pattern.
This
finding represents a severe encephalopathy from this
medication-induced
burst suppression coma.


Brief Hospital Course:
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], the pt was hypothermic (33 degrees Celsius)
and hemodynamically normal. Her pupils were equal bilaterally
and very sluggish to respond to light. She was unresponsive to
verbal and noxious stimuli. There were occasional muscle
twitches but no gross motor movements. The remainder of her exam
was unremarkable. Head CT shows mildly indistinct grey-white
matter differentiation but no obvious injuries. The chest CT was
remarkable for patchy bilateral opacities of the lungs.

She was transferred to the trauma ICU warmed and resuscitated.
Neurosurgery placed an intracranial bolt and the opening
intracranial pressure was documented as 70 mmHg but soon after
settled at around 25-30 mmHg. On follow up she developed more
muscle twitching and an upward gaze suggestive of seizure
activity. Dilantin was started and the neurology service was
consulted. A continuous EEG was performed at the bedside and was
consistent with anoxic encephalopathy with developing continuous
epileptiform discharges. There was no evidence of any typical
electrical brain activity. Given the history, the devastating
neurologic insult, and the lack of any meaningful recovery her
prognosis was dismal. After several family meetings the decision
was made to withdraw support and it was the patient??????s expressed
wish to be an organ donor. On hospital day 6 support was
withdrawn, comfort measures were instituted, and she was taken
for a DCD harvest by the transplant team.
