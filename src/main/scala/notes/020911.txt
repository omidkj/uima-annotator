Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1943**]
Chief Complaint:
Epigastric pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP [**2149-8-1**]

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 5108**] is a 79 yo M with HTN, DM II, ?AS and history of
asymptomatic gall stones who was transfered from [**Hospital3 **]
Hospital for ERCP. Patient was in his usual state of health
until today at ~5:00 am when he woke up with lower mid chest and
epigastric pain. He got up to go to the bathroom, felt
lightheaded and had 2 episodes of emesis that was non-bloody and
no coffee grounds were seen. He went back to bed and when his
pain did not get better he called his son to take him to the
hospital. He describes his pain as [**9-21**], sharp/pressure and he
has never had this kind of pain before. He had associated
chills, diaphoresis, cough productive of white sputum but no
other symptoms.

He was initially taken to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital where he was given
40 mg IV lasix, 3 g unasyn and zofran. A CT abd/pel revealed a
stone in the common bile duct and pancreatitis. He was then
transfered to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.

In the ED, initial vs were: T 99.3 BP 129/76, HR 87, RR 18, Sat
99% 2L. Patient was given 2L IVF, 3 g unasyn and 500 mg IV
metronidazole. He was seen by the general surgery team in the ED
who recommended surgical evaluation after ERCP.

On the floor, the patient states he is doing much better and his
pain is now down to 4/10.

Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD, no carotid bruits
Lungs: Crackles [**12-15**] way up bilaterally
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, II/VI SEM that
radiates to the apex and carotids, no rubs or gallops
Abdomen: soft, mild distention, TTP RUQ and epigastric area,
bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding,
reducible umbilical hernia

Pertinent Results:
WBC: 18.2 -> 8.5
Cr: 1.8 -> 1.3

ALT: 233 -> 57
AST: 316 -> 18
ALK PHOS: 174 -> 122
BILI: 4.2 -> 0.8

LIPASE: 5667 -> 128

TTE [**2149-7-31**]:  The left atrium is elongated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis
(valve area 1.8 cm2). The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

ERCP [**2149-8-1**]:
Difficult intubation with the ERCP scope as describe above.
Successful biliary cannulation
The common bile duct, common hepatic duct, right and left
hepatic ducts, biliary radicles and cystic duct were filled with
contrast and well visualized. The course and caliber of the
structures are normal with no evidence of extrinsic compression
and no ductal abnormalities.
The CBD was about 7mm.
There was a suggestion of a large stone or stones impacted at
the distal CBD
A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using
a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
Sphincteroplasty performed with 8mm dilation balloon.
Sweep of the bilary tree revealed scant sludge. No stones were
retreived.
Due to the concern for persistent impaction of a distal CBD
stone, an 8cm by 7FR Cotton [**Doctor Last Name **] biliary stent was placed in
the main duct.
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum

C-SPINE XR [**2149-8-5**]: PENDING

CT C-SPINE [**2149-8-5**]: PRELIM FINDINGS--Large osteophyte at around
C3-C4 protruding approximately 1.75 cm anteriorly.


Brief Hospital Course:
79 M with gallstone pancreatitis and choledocholithiasis.
Initially had lipase 5667 with elevated lactate and WBC; started
on unasyn and metronidazole with aggressive IVF hydration.
Underwent ERCP on hospital day #3 with sphincterotomy and stent
placement.  No stones were retrieved.  Post-ERPC did well.

Problem list:
#. [**Name2 (NI) **]sis/Gallstone pancreatitis: Follow up plan is
for repeat ERCP with stent removal and possible removal of
stone; will also follow-up with surgery for cholecystectomy.
Completed 5 days of Unasyn.

#. Hypoxia at rest to 89% on room air. Family reports that the
patient's baseline is 89-90% on room air.  O2 sat was check with
patient ambulating and O2 sat improved to 95%.  Etiology may be
hypoventilation at rest that improves with effort.  Recommend
incentive spirometry to improve breathing function at rest.

#. Moderate to severe aspiration:  Pt has had long-standing
coughing while eating (reported by the son). A bedside
swallowing evaluation revealed signs and symptoms of aspiration.
 Video Swallow Study was performed that showed impaired
epiglottal movements caused by obstruction from a protruding
cervical osteophyte.  Cervical spine imaging obtained and
Ortho-Spine consultation requested.  Patient and family did not
want to pursue further inpatient evaluation and elected to go
home and follow up with Ortho-Spine as outpatient.  They
understand that left untreated, aspiration can lead to
complications such as aspiration pneumonia. The following
recommendations from speech and swallow about diet
recommendations and oral care were passed along to them:

If pt wishes to accept the risks of aspiration and return home
on PO, safest diet is thin liquids and moist pureed or ground
solids with the following aspiration precautions:
     a. Water will be the safest liquid to drink
     b. Take small bites and sips
     c. Swallow 4-5 times for each bite
     d. Take a sip of liquid after each bite
     e. Crush pills and take with applesauce/yogurt/etc.
     f. End meals with a sip of liquid
     g. Maintain good oral hygiene especially before eating
        and drinking
     h. Recommend physical activity after meals as able

#. Acute renal failure: Likely prerenal with improvement after
IVF.

#. HTN: Anti-hypertensives held initially.

#. Aortic stenosis, moderate:  Echo showed aortic valve area of
1.8.

#. Diastolic heart failure, acute:  Occurred in the setting of
fluid resuscitation; improved with IV furosemide

#. Diabetes, type II: The patient was started on an ISS, with
appropriate blood sugar control.

#. DVT prophylaxis: Heparin subcutaneous

#. Code status: Full code
