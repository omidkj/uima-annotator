Chief Complaint:
"Not feeling well."

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2195-7-17**]: Cardiac catherization with placement of bare metal
stents to RCA.
[**2195-7-19**]: Cardiac catherization with placement of temporary
pacing wire.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 20951**] is a 61 year old man with history of HTN,
hyperlipidemia, ?DM, atrial fibrillation (on coumadin), atrial
thrombus who presented to his PCP's office today with
bradycardia and hypotension.  He reports feeling generally
fatigued and reports intermittent chest tightness x2 days.
During the previous 2 days, he also endorses decreased PO
intake.  He specifically denied chest reflux symptoms, arm pain,
jaw pain, or diaphoresis. Of note, he had been recently admitted
and discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] ([**Date range (3) 20952**]) for r/o MI with a
diagnosis of GERD after a negative P-MIBI with EF 51% and
negative serial cardiac enzymes.  On this admission, his digoxin
was discontinued and his atenolol was changed to lopressor.
.
On presentation to ED, VS: T 97.9, HR 30, BP 70s/50s, RR 17, O2
sat 95%.  Workup in ED was significant for atrial fibrillation
with HR in 30s and hypotension (SBP 80).  ST elevations were
present in II, II, and avF with reciprocal depressions in V4-V6.
 A code STEMI was called.  The patient was administered ASA 325
mg daily, plavix 600 mg daily, glucagon, Zofran, and atropine
0.5 mg for a HR in 40s.  The patient was also ?initially bolused
with heparin (5000 units IV) and integrilin (20 mg) in the ED;
however, these medications were subsequently discontinued prior
to cath as INR was elevated. He was sent to the cardiac
catheterization lab for emergent PCI.  Of note, the patient was
restrained during procedure because kept touching his groin.
Cath showed a total occlusion of the mid RCA with thrombus,
which was stented with 3 bare metal stents.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Pertinent Results:

and hypotension (SBP 80).  ST elevations were present in II, II,
and avF with reciprocol depressions in V4-V6 and Q in II, II.

[**2195-7-17**] Chest x-ray:
IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly, no radiographic evidence of pneumonia
or CHF.

[**2195-7-17**] Cardiac catherization:
COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system

revealed single vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA, LAD,
and LCX
had no angiographically apparent disease.  The RCA had a mid
vessel
total occlusion with distal vessel filling via left to right
collaterals.
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a normal systemic
arterial
blood pressure of 116/63 mm Hg.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
4. Successful ptca and stenting of the mid and mid-distal RCA
with
overlapping 2.5x15, 2.5x15 and 2.5x18mm mini vision stents.
Successful 6
french angioseal deployment. Final angiography revealed 0%
residual
stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and timi 3
flow. The
patient left the lab free of angina and in stable condition.
(see ptca
comments)

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Single vessel coronary artery disease.

[**2195-7-18**] Chest X-ray:
IMPRESSION: New right lower lobe infiltrate.

[**2195-7-18**] Transthoracic Echo:
Conclusions
The left atrial volume is markedly increased (>32ml/m2). Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe
hypokinesis/akinesis of the basal to mid inferior and
inferolateral segments. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**2-11**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

IMPRESSION: Basal to mid inferior/inferolateral
hypokinesis/akinesis. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation with
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2194-2-6**],
the wall motion abnormalities are new. The estimated PA systolic
pressure is now mildly elevated.

[**2195-7-19**] Chest x-ray:
IMPRESSION: Interval development of currently mild pulmonary
edema with asymmetric appearance involving right lung more than
the left. No pneumothorax. Small amount of right pleural
effusion.

[**2195-7-19**] Cardiac Catherization:

COMMENTS:
1.  Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system revealed
patent
stents in the RCA.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right- and left-sided
filling
pressures with RVEDP 19 mmHg and PCWP 30 mmHg.  There were
prominent V
waves on the PCWP tracing to 47 mmHg.  There was moderate
pulmonary
arterial hypertension with PASP 56 mmHg.  The cardiac output was

depressed, with CI 1.7 L/min/m2.
3.  A 7-French balloon-tipped temporary pacer was placed
successfully in
the RV apex.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Patent RCA stents
2.  Elevated right- and left-sided filling pressures with
prominent PCWP
V-wave and moderately severe pulmonary hypertension.
3.  Successful temporary pacer insertion.

[**2195-7-20**] Chest x-ray:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**7-19**], the patient has
taken a somewhat better inspiration. Moderate cardiomegaly
persists. Mild indisti
