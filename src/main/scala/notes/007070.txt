Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
Dizziness and epigastric pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization through the right radial artery


History of Present Illness:
Pt is 82 y/o man with PMH significant for HTN, dyslipidemia,
DMII, atrial fibrillation on coumadin and s/p PPM 1 month prior
who was transferred from [**Hospital3 26615**] Hospital s/p STEMI and v
fib to [**Hospital1 18**] where he received cardiac cath and RCA bare metal
stent placement for RCA occlusion.
.
Pt was en route to [**State 1727**] and stopped to eat at a restaurant with
his family. During dinner he began to complain of feeling "hot
and sweaty", dizzy, and light-headed. He aslo c/o stomach pains
that radiated from his LLQ to the mid sternum. Additionally, he
had pain radiating up the right side of his head. No CP or SOB.
EMS was called and pt was taken to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. On arrival to
[**Name (NI) **], pt was cool and diaphoretic, threw up white phlegm, and
complained of pain/pressure in abdomen radiating to chest. His
BP was 112/70, HR 71, RR 18, T 98.7 An ECG demonstrated
ventricular pacing with ST elevations most pronounced in the
inferior leads. He was given morphine 2.5mg IV, zofran 4g IV,
ativan 0.5mg IV, heparin IV drip w/bolus. During phlebotomy he
went into v fib arrest. He was defibrillated twice and had
return of sponatneous circulation. Pt was then transferred via
[**Location (un) **] to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
On admission to [**Hospital1 **] pt had BP 125/61, HR 70s, RR 20, 98% on 2L
NC. Cath was done through R radial-artery access due to pt's INR
of 2.5. RCA occlusion crossed and export thrombectomy. During
cath pt had hypotension to the SBP 60s and responded to dopa.
LVEDP was 25-30. During procedure, pt was given IV heparin, NTG,
bivallirudin, dopamine, nicardipine, diltiazem.
.
Per family, pt was in his usual state of health prior to this
episode. He has not complained of chest pain or SOB. He has a
history of DOE, which was improved after pacer placement 2
months ago. He has a history of angina.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

CT SCAN OF CHEST [**2137-5-29**]
0. No suspicious retrocardiac mass.
1. Bilateral small pleural effusions. No focal air-space
consolidtation to suggest PNA.
2. Mild-to-moderate centrilobular emphysema with upper lobe
predominance. Mild paraseptal emphysema.
3. Non-specific minimal septal thickening, in the dependent
portion of all lobes of the lungs, likely represent mild
pulmonary edema.
4. Calcified pleural plaques bilaterally, R > L, compatible with
prior exposure for asbestos.
5. Small pulmonary nodules. Recommend f/u given the history of
likely
asbestos exposure.
6. Varicarious excretion of IV contrast in the gallbladder,
likely from the recent cath procedure.
7. Trace oral contrast in the stomach.
8. Incidental findings of unusually lateral displacement of the
left kidney, incompletely assessed.

ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2137-5-28**]
The left atrium is dilated. There is mild to moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
inferior/inferolateral akinesis. LVEF 40-45%. Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. with focal basal free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left
atrial pressure. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a very small pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2137-5-26**],
mitral regurigtation may be slihgtly more prominent.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is an 82 y/o man with PMH of a fib, DM II, COPD, angina, HTN,
and hypercholesterolemia who was transferred from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
s/p inferior STEMI and v fib arrest [**12-25**] RCA occlusion. He is s/p

.
# STEMI/V fib arrest: pt had STEMI and v fib s/p defib x 2,
found to have RCA occlusion s/p right sided radial-access PCI
thrombectomy and bare metal stent to RCA. V fib may be [**12-25**] STEMI
or underlying other arrhythmia as pt has pacer. ASA 325mg and
plavix 75mg were started during this admission. His home crestor
was changed to high-dose Lipitor. Home Lasix and other preload
reducing agents were [**Last Name (un) 25359**] in the in setting of possible RV
infarction or RV dysfunction given the location of his MI. Echo
showed EF 40-45% and focal basal hypokinesis of RV free wall.
Patient was started on metoprolol, but then began to have
shortness of breath and a high O2 requirement. ECG was unchanged
and cardiac enzymes did not bump. It was thought that
particularly given the Hx of COPD, the BBlocker may have
contributed to bronchospasm, and therefore BBlocker were held
for the rest of the admission.
