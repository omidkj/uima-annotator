History of Present Illness:
This 84 year old white female with long standing complaints of
exertional chest
pressure and dyspnea and a LBBB underwent a stress test today.
The stress

for EKG changes. Nuclear imaging showed no evidence of ischemia

motion abnormalities.  She was sent to the emergency room for
evaluation and was treated for CHF on her CXR with Lasix.
She was then transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.

[**2113-11-21**] ECHO
Pre-CPB:
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed (LVEF= 40 - 45 %). Hypokinesis of the septum and
inferior walls is seen.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is severe aortic
valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Post-CPB:
The patient initally had moderate LV systolic depresson. An
infusion of epinephrine was started. LV systolic fxn returned to
mild depression. RV systolic fxn was good.
A prosthetic aortic valve is well-seated and functional. No leak
is seen. A residual peak gradient of 30 mmHg is seen.
Aorta intact.

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   s/p thoracentesis evaluate re-expansion?
Final Report
REASON FOR EXAM: Followup pleural effusion post left
thoracentesis and
pulmonary edema.
Comparison is made with prior studies of [**11-29**] and 13.
Low lung volumes are unchanged. Moderate cardiomegaly is table.
Mild-to-
moderate pulmonary edema is unchanged. Left lower lobe
retrocardiac opacity
has increased likely due to atelectasis. There is a small amount
of left
pleural effusion. NG tube tip is out of view below the
diaphragm. Sternal
wires are aligned. Left subclavian catheter tip is in the SVC.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 69335**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2113-11-21**] for surgical
management of her aortic valve and coronary artery disease. She
was taken directly to the operating room where she underwent
coronary artery bypass grafting and an aortic valve replacement.
Please see operative note for details. She weaned from bypass on
epinephrine and nitroglycerine in stable condition. She was
transferred to the ICU.

She was acidotic and treated with fluid resuscitation, Levophed
and Milrinone.  hemodynamics stabilized and lactates cleared by
the morning after surgery. Pressors were weaned and discontinued
over the first three days. She was extubated on the second day
after surgery, but required reintubation for fatigue and
increased work of breathing. Amiodarone was utilized for AF
control with eventual restoration of SR .A chest CT was done to
evaluate for effusions. A small to moderate Rt effusion was and
a thoracentesis yielded 400cc of fluid.  Bronchoscopy on [**11-27**]
for small amounts of white secretions.

Diuresis was continued and CV remained stable. AcE inhibition
and beta blockade were begun and advanced to adequate levels.
The ventilator was weaned and she was again extubated on [**11-28**].
BiPAP was utilized nocturnally and aggressive pulmonary toilet
was performed.  She improved and BiPAP was stopped after [**12-1**].
A speech and swallowing evaluation was done and she was cleared
for ground solids and thin liquids, to be advanced as tolerated.
 With strength improving and pulmonary status stable she was
ready for discharge to a rehabilitation facility.

Her CXR shows low volumes, consistent with poor inspiratory
effort, but no effusions or infiltrates.  Labs are stable.
Follow up requirements,medications and precautions are outlined
in the discharge paperwork.
