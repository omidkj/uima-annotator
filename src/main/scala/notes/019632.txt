Chief Complaint:
left hip fracture s/p mechanical fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left Hip ORIF

History of Present Illness:
83 yo female with a past medical history of coronary artery
disease, congestive heart failure, arthritis, and a AAA was
admitted to medicine s/p a mechanical fall one day ago. Pt
reports that she tripped on her rug one day ago, landing on her
left side. She remained on her left side overnight because she
could not get to her phone and was found on the morning of
admission by her neighbor.  When found by her neighbor, she was
unable to walk but was awake, alert, and oriented x 3. Patient
denies chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, loss of
consciousness, numbness or tingling. Review of systems notable
for left hip pain, which patient reports is only present with
movement of any kind and not present at rest.
Additional review of systems is notable for the following:
hearing loss - has been evaluated by audiology and found to have
mild to moderately sensorineural hearing loss; nausea and
vomiting two weeks ago which has now resolved; and loss of
vision in right eye. Patient denies fevers, chills, abdominal
pain, dysuria, diarrhea.
.
Patient has had multiple falls in the past, usually related to
decreased vision. According to her daughter-in-law, she had a
fall down stairs four years ago when she fractured her left
shoulder and had another fall down stairs 15 years ago. She has
been on Fosamax and Vitamin D with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
When seen in the ED, patient's vital signs were temp 98,3 . HR
104 / BP 138/71 / RR 18 / 94% on 4L. She received Morphine 2mg
IV x 2.

- [**2192-3-26**] CT C spine - IMPRESSION: No fracture or malalignment
within the cervical spine.
- [**2192-3-26**] CT Head - 1. No intracranial hemorrhage or mass
effect.
2. Focal parenchymal calcification in the cortex of the left
parasagittal frontal lobe. Differential diagnosis for this
lesion includes a small aneurysm, low-grade tumor, arteriovenous
malformation, or prior infection. MRI with gadolinium could be
performed for further evaluation if indicated.
- [**2192-3-26**] Left Hip XR - IMPRESSION: Acute left intertrochanteric
femoral fracture, with likely extension of the fracture line
into into the basicervical portion of the femoral neck. Slight
medial displacement and varus angulation of the distal femoral
shaft.
- [**2192-3-27**] CXR - IMPRESSION: Stable appearance to the mediastinum
and cardiomegaly, with the patient's known history of ascending
and descending aortic aneurysm. No acute cardiopulmonary
abnormalities are identified.
- [**2192-3-29**] Echo - The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right
atrium is markedly dilated;  moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy; left ventricular  cavity is unusually small.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is  normal (LVEF
70%);  no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular  chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
moderately  dilated athe sinus level. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. There are focal  calcifications in the aortic arch. The
descending thoracic aorta is mildly  dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic  stenosis is not
present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid  regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  There is no pericardial
effusion.
There are linear echodensities in the aortic arch and descending
aorta (at the
level of the left atrium) that may be acoustic reverberation
artifact
secondary to arterial wall calcification but a dissection flap
cannot be
excluded with certainty. A CT angiographic study or cardiac MR
or
transesophageal echocardiogram could help elucidate the nature
of this finding  if clinically indicated.
- [**2192-4-1**] CT Pelvis - 1. No evidence hemorrhage or new hematoma.
2. Stable appearance of the distal abdominal dissection and
aneurysm.

Brief Hospital Course:
83 yo female with past medical history significant for
congestive heart failure, arthritis, hypertension, and stable
abdominal aortic aneurysm, who presented from home with left hip
fracture. Patient underwent left hip ORIF with orthopedic
surgery. Her post-operative course was complicated by an episode
of hypotension requiring MICU care and pressors. Her hypotension
was thought likely secondary to blood loss into her hip post-op
and had resolved within 1-2 days. Upon discharge, her blood
pressure improved and she remained stable on 2L oxygen
(consistent with home).
.
1. Left Hip Fracture
Patient had mechanical fall resulting in left hip fracture.
Patient underwent left hip ORIF by orthopedic surgery without
immediate complications. Patient was maintained on lovenox for
DVT prophylaxis and upon discharge, patient's lovenox was
increased to therapeutic doses while awaiting therapeutic INR.
Patient was started on vitamin D while as an inpatient and was
continued on her outpatient calcium.  Pt to follow-up as an
outpatient with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

2. Atrial Fibrillation and Supratherapeutic INR
Patient maintained on rat
