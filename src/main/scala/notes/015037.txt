Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3151**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
suprapubic catheter replacement
strangulated right inguinal hernia repair


History of Present Illness:
86yo M with h/o CAD s/p MI [**2097**], atrial fibrillation,
osteoporosis, Parkinson's, gout, BPH s/p TURP (, h/o neurogenic
bladder with suprapubic catheter, admitted [**3-8**] with N/V and
malaise.  He was found to have a strangulated R inguinal hernia
and taken for repair.  He also had ARF on admission with a
creatinine of 4.1, which improved to normal with IVF.  His
suprapubic catheter was found to be obstructed, and was replaced
by Urology.  He received 5d vanc/levo/flagyl postop.  His postop
course was complicated by episodic shortness of breath, improved
with gentle diuresis, and atrial fibrillation with episodes of
HR to 120s.  He is being transferred to the Medicine service for
further management of his dyspnea.
.
Currently, he states he feels well.  He reports improvement in
his dyspnea.  He denies chest pain, palpitations,
lightheadedness, N/V, abdominal pain.

.
CXR ([**3-12**]): b/l pleural effusions, RLL infiltrate- atelectasis
vs. pna
.
ECG: atrial fibrillation, no ischemic changes
.
TTE ([**9-8**]): suboptimal quality, cannot evaluate LV function
.
Stress TTE ([**5-5**]): evidence of prior MI with inferobasal
akinesis

Brief Hospital Course:
# Dyspnea:  His episodes of dyspnea were thought likely
secondary to pulmonary edema and pneumonia.  His CXR showed a
RLL opacity and bilateral small pleural effusions.  His TTE
showed diastolic heart dysfunction, which was thought to be
contributing to his pulmonary edema in the setting of poorly
controlled atrial fibrillation, as well as with the IV fluids he
received perioperatively.  He was diuresed with prn Lasix.  He
was maintained on levofloxacin to treat a suspected aspiration
pneumonia.  He defervesced and his white count trended down.  As
he had been on DVT prophylaxis with both SC heparin and
pneumaboots, and his dyspnea improved with diuresis and
antibiotics, we did feel a CTA to rule out PE was necessary at
this time.  He was symptom free upon discharge.  As he has a
normal EF and his heart rate was well-controlled, he was not
discharged on oral furosemide.
.
# Leukocytosis/Fever:  He had a leukocytosis on admission,
presumably secondary to his strangulated hernia.  He received 5
days of IV vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole.  He was
then maintained on po levofloxacin by the Surgery team,
presumably to treat a suspected UTI.  His urine culture came
back with <10,000 organisms.  However, he did have a RLL
infiltrate on CXR, suspicious for an aspiration pneumonia.  A
bedside swallow evaluation revealed aspiration on a regular
diet, so he was switched to a ground diet with thin liquids.  A
video swallow showed severe dysphagia but no evidence of
aspiration on his ground diet.  A urine culture was repeated to
rule out UTI with his indwelling suprapubic catheter, and came
back with >100,000 Proteus mirabilis, resistant to
fluoroquinolones but sensitive to ceftriaxone.  Surgery reported
he is recovering well s/p his strangulated hernia repair.  He
was afebrile for 36 hours upon discharge.  His WBC count had
trended down to 14.  He was discharged on cefpodoxime for 7 days
to treat his UTI and also to complete his treatment for
pneumonia.
.
# Atrial fibrillation:  On admission, his metoprolol dose had
been halved, presumably in the setting of infection.  On
transfer to the Medicine service, he was having occasional
episodes of HR in the 120s, during which he was asymptomatic.
His metoprolol dose was increased back to his outpatient dose,
and was then titrated up for better rate control.  Per OMR
notes, he is not an anticoagulation candidate secondary to fall
risk.
.
# Strangulated hernia:  In the OR, his hernia sac was found to
be hemorrhagic, but he had normal bowel.  After the surgery, his
RLQ incision was slightly erythematous but nontender and without
discharge.  He should have his staples removed on postop day 14,
which will be [**3-22**].
.
# Hypernatremia:  Upon transfer to the medicine service, he was
hypernatremic with a sodium of 149.  His free water deficit was
calculated to be ~2.5L.  He was hydrated gently D5W, and his
hypernatremia resolved.
.
# Anemia: His hematocrit was not far off baseline last year.  It
was stable throughout his admission.  His stools were guaiac
negative.
.
# ARF:  His creatinine was markedly elevated on admission in the
setting of vomiting and decreased oral intake.  It improved to
normal with IVF and was stable for the rest of his admission.
.
# Parkinson's: He was maintained on his Sinemet at his
outpatient dose.
.
# CAD:  He is s/p MI in [**2097**].  He had a lipid panel in [**10-7**]
with total cholesterol 160, LDL 95, and HDL 52.  He was
maintained on aspirin.  His metoprolol was titrated up for his
atrial fibrillation as above.
.
# FEN:  He was found to be aspirating on his regular diet, so he
was switched to a ground diet with meds crushed in applesauce.
Nutrition consult was concerned for poor nutritional status that
may result in poor wound healing.  He was put on Boost to
supplement his nutrition.  His video swallow eval showed severe
dysphagia but no aspiration on the ground diet.
.
# Ppx:  PPI. SC heparin + pneumaboots.
.
# Code status: FULL CODE.
