Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
transferred from OSH for thrombocytosis, leukocytosis, hypoxic
resp failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
plasmapheresis

History of Present Illness:
41yo man with h/o PCV, vWF def, PSA, who p/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8**] Hosp 5d
PTA with c/o LUQ pain s/p falling down stairs, found to have
ruptured spleen, went to OR for splenectomy, then ICU post-op
2/2 blood loss, where his plt count rose to 2,019,000 and WBC to
118,000 on Post-Op Day #4.  Pt also noted to be in withdrawal
from etoh, was maintained on ativan CIWA scale and esmolol gtt
from HR control. He had a fever to 103 on Post-Op Day #2, was
started on Zosyn and Vanc empirically, blood cultures negative
to date. He was kept NPO with NGT on suction post-op "to protect
the vascular lines of the short gastrics," according to OSH d/c
summary. He was having diarrhea, C Diff toxin was negative, but
he was started empirically on IV Flagyl as well.  The patient
was in moderate hypoxic respiratory failure presumably since his
surgery, requiring 50% FiO2 on non-rebreather to maintain his
sats in the 95% range. The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
platelet plasmapheresis at the suggestion of the Hematology
consultants at the OSH.

Unremarkable (per OSH)

Brief Hospital Course:
41yo man with h/o PCV, vWF def, PSA, who p/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8**] Hosp 5d
PTA with c/o LUQ pain s/p falling down stairs, found to have
ruptured spleen, underwent splenectomy, post-op plt count rose
to 2,019,000 and WBC to 118,000 on Post-Op Day #4.  Also found
to have mod hypoxic resp distress, AMS, etoh w/d, fever to 103,
diarrhea. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for platelet plasmapheresis,
further w/u.

1. Thrombocytosis:  Peak at 2813 k.  Etiology attributed to
previous PV, exacerbated by reactive thrombocytosis s/p
traumatic splenectomy. Pt had L femoral pharesis line placed by
surgery and underwent total of 6 large volume phareses.
Mr.[**Known lastname 111152**] did complain of headache early in the course of his
hospitalization that subsided when his platelet count was
consistently less than 1.5 million.  He did not manifest other
s/s of hyperviscosity (i.e. tinnitus, erythromelalgia, visual
changes).  He did develop bluish discoloration and numbness of
his R forefinger that was attributed to a thrombotic event.  He
was maintained on aspirin 81 mg po QD to prevent further
thromboses.  Hematology was consulted and recommeneded
increasing his dose of hydroxyurea to 5g/D and also initiated
IFN-alpha tr-weekly shots.  He has tolerated these therapies
well with occasional flushing associated with IFN.  Initially,
the doubling time of Mr.[**Known lastname 111153**] platelet count was 12 hours,
requiring plt pharesis every other day.  Mr. [**Known lastname 111153**] platelt
count is now decreasing daily, currently at 1115k, just on
interferon.  Hydroxyurea was discontinued when his WBC dropped
precipitously to 7K.

2. Leukocytosis:  Peaked at 62k. Etiology thought to be [**3-17**]
combination C.diff leukocytosis, s/p splenectomy and possible
myeloproliferative disorder.  No signs/symptoms of leukostasis.
Leukocytosis improved much quicker than thrombocytosis, possibly
due to greater contribution from C.diff colitis (being treated
for). Unlikely blast crisis given lack of blasts seen on
peripheral smear,  but will need formal bone marrow biopsy to
address this problem.  Mr.[**Known lastname 111153**] white count decreased from
16-->7, so his hydrea was held.

3. Hypoxic Resp Failure:  Pt admit ABG:  7.49/33/48, CXR
revealed multilobar pneumonia and CTA was negative for pulmonary
embolism.  Pt's hypoxia improved quickly and on HD#3 was 100% on
RA.  Repeat CXR revealed resolution of multilobar infiltrates.
No definite organism was obtained.  Pt finished a 14 day course
of antibiotics for this problem. HIV negative this admission.

4. AMS: Pt was admitted with change in mental status from OSH.
His baseline mental status was not familiar to anyone and the pt
appeared agitated and had visual hallucinations.  Head CT
negative. These visions and anxiousness improved and dissapeared
with resolution of plt count.  In-depth social history revealed
occasional alcohol use, roughly 7-8 beers once a week.
Therefore, the patient's AMS was not [**3-17**] alcohol withdrawl. He
eventually related he has been diagnosed with schizotypal d/o,
but he was not seeing a psychiatrist. Psychiatry was consulted
and agreed Mr.[**Known lastname 111153**] mental status/ behavior was consistent
with schizotypal personality disorder. No antipsychotics
recommended.

5. Diarrhea:  C.diff positive from OSH.  Completed a 14 day
course of PO flagyl.  No longer C.diff positive or having
diarrhea.

6. CAD: no acute events- pt switched from diltiazem, which he
was taking as outpt, to metoprolol for optimal cardioprotection.
Continued aspirin, statin held due to LFT abnormalities- to be
followed as outpt.
