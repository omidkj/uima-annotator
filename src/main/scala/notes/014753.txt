HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 36432**] is a 64-year-old
morbidly obese male who presented to the [**Hospital **] Hospital on
[**11-30**] with acute onset dizziness, diaphoresis while playing
cards that night.  He reportedly had increased shortness of
breath over the last several weeks, on home O2 with sleep
apnea (severe although he reports not using CPAP). He also
complained of nausea and vomiting.  He denied chest pain or
chest pressure.  He had one episode similar to this one of
dizziness and diaphoresis months ago, but denies any chest
pain or pressure.  His mobility at baseline is severely
limited by his weight and shortness of breath.  His arterial
blood gases on 100% oxygen by face mask in the Emergency
Department was 729/64/236.  He was placed on BIPAP and his
subsequent arterial blood gases was 7.24/63/87 with a
bicarbonate of 29, BUN and creatinine 28/1.8, unknown
baseline.  He was felt to be in congestive heart failure by
exam and chest x-ray and was given diuretics.  He was
monitored in the Intensive Care Unit at the outside hospital
and placed on intermittent BIPAP which he tolerated poorly.
Echocardiogram by report at outside hospital also
demonstrated mild aortic stenosis with anteroseptal and
inferoseptal hypokinesis that was severe and ejection
fraction of 30% to 35%.  Subsequently, he was transferred to
the [**Hospital6 256**] for further
management.

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM:
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 97.1??????, blood pressure 140/70, pulse
80, respiratory rate 19, O2 saturations 90% to 96% on 100%
face mask.
GENERAL:  Morbidly obese male in no apparent distress, sleepy
but arousable and oriented.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Pupils equal, round and
reactive to light.  Extraocular muscles are intact.
Oropharynx dry.
NECK:  Jugular venous pressure not visualized, supple neck.
CARDIAC:  Regular rate and rhythm, 2/6 systolic murmur at
left sternal border.
LUNGS:  Fine crackles at bases bilaterally, no wheezes.
ABDOMEN:  Obese, soft, nontender, positive bowel sounds.
EXTREMITIES:  Venostasis changes bilaterally, no pitting
edema.
NEUROLOGIC:  Alert and oriented x3.  Cranial nerves II
through XII intact.

ADMISSION LABS:  White blood cell count 18.8, hematocrit
43.8, platelets 202.  Sodium 148, potassium 4.6, chloride
107, bicarbonate 32, BUN 13, creatinine 1.5, glucose 126.

IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 80,
PR interval 170, left axis deviation with poor R-wave
progression, Qs in V2, V3, no ST-T changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Echocardiogram done at our institution
showed that his AS was not severe.  Left ventricular
hypertrophy was present.  Focal wall motion abnormalities.
The patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction with CKs.
He was diuresed with Lasix and was put on a nitroglycerin
drip for preload reduction.  Given his echocardiogram
results, it was decided that the patient would not need an
emergent catheter.  A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed to assess
his pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and to guide
management of his congestive heart failure.

2.  PULMONARY:  The patient's states there had been
longstanding deterioration in his respiratory status,
etiology was unclear.  The patient has not been formally
diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea and has not had PFTs.
The patient was intubated on [**12-2**] for hypercarbic
respiratory failure.  He was empirically started on
levofloxacin.  Propofol was used for sedation during
patient's course of mechanical ventilation.  Pulmonary
consult was obtained and it was thought the patient's
respiratory problems were secondary to pulmonary hypertension
due to sleep apnea and/or chronic Ps.  On [**2139-12-4**], the
patient's sedation was discontinued in anticipation of
extubation.  The patient remained sedated, but was moving
legs and had brain stem reflexes.

On the afternoon of [**2139-12-6**], the patient had an episode of
apnea on pressure support, was subsequently changed to CMV
and had an additional episode of hypertension with systolic
blood pressures to 60.  He subsequently was started on
dopamine and blood pressure recovered slowly.  However, the
patient was observed to not have a gag reflex.  Further
neurologic exam reveals 5 mm fixed dilated bilaterally and
non reactive, no response to sternal rub or noxious stimuli.
Doll's eyes were negative.  A stat head CT was obtained which
showed a large cerebellar bleed involving mid brain obscuring
the pontine angle.  A stat neurology and neurosurgery consult
was obtained.  Upon discussion with the neurology and
neurosurgery, it was decided that since there was no sign of
brain stem function there would be no benefits to urgent
craniotomy and craniectomy, evacuation of hematoma and
decompression.  Since there was no sign of brain stem or
cerebellar function, this was thought to be consistent with
clinical brain death.

The patient's condition was discussed with the patient's wife
and next of [**Doctor First Name **].  Upon discussion with the patient's family
and medical team, it was decided to withdraw life support.
Life support was withdrawn on [**2139-12-7**] after neurology's
official certification of brain death.  The patient's family
agreed to an autopsy.
