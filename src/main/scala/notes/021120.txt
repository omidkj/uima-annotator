Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 598**]
Chief Complaint:
fatigue with sore throat, noted to have acute hepatitis at OSH,
transferred for further workup

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2193-12-30**] Tricep Muscle and Right sural nerve biopsy
[**2194-1-9**] subtotal colectomy end ileostomy
[**2194-1-16**] Tracheostomy

History of Present Illness:
36 y.o female with no pmhx. presenting
from outside hospital with labs indicating acute hepatitis, new
ascites, malaise and myalgias. Her symptoms started before
[**Holiday 1451**] when she developed a sore throat and generalized
malaise, body aches, and fever.  Her symptoms lasted for [**3-7**]
days and subsided on their own. The following week however, she
became progressively weaker. She saw her PCP and complained of
athralgias/myalgias and sore throat once again. Her PCP
prescribed Azithromycin, and a few days later she developed a
rash on her hands, arms, lower back and buttocks. Her PCP
stopped the azithromycin due to a fear that the rash was
Azithromycin-induced. Her rash continued to worsen. Labs drawn
at that time showed lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia, and she
was referred to a hematologist on [**2193-12-18**]. His impression was
that her symptoms were consistent with a viral syndrome. She
also had a mild elevation of LFTs at that time. Her fatigue
continued to worsen, and she could not ambulate. She went to
[**Hospital 1727**] [**Hospital3 **], where she improved with IV fluids and
was discharged.  She saw her PCP who, after reviewing her labs,
observing her rash, and noting her worsening LFTs, referred her
to a inland hospital.  She was then transferred to [**State 48444**] Center the same day.
.
At Eastern [**State 1727**], ultrasound of the abdomen was done on [**12-23**]
and was normal.  MRCP on [**2193-12-25**] showed no obstructive
process but was significant for ascites. CMV antibodies, Herpes
Simplex, HIV, SPEP, and UPEP were drawn and are pending at the
time of transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].  Ferritin was elevated to 1489,
platelets decreased to 68. RF was less than 10. [**Doctor First Name **] was 1:40. No
improvement in rash or clinical status. No improvement in LFTs.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup.
.
On the floor, the following additional history was obtained. The
patient's initial viral syndrome included 3-4 days of non bloody
diarrhea which spontaneously resolved. She denies any abdominal
pain and nausea and vomiting. She says her weight has been
stable, has lost 3 pounds since [**Month (only) **]. She does complain of
dysphagia in the last month. She also describes dull pain in the
substernal region with swallowing. She has been cutting her food
into small pieces as a result but denies any bloating or
dyspepsia. Last week she was noted to have thrush and was
treated with Nystatin for a couple of days. She also describes
the pain/stiffness of her joints/ muscles and weakness as
initially being worse at her lower extremities and moving up her
body to her upper extremties in the past few weeks. She is also
complaining of neck and upper back stiffness and pain.   She
notes that she received prednsione for 1-2 days in the past few
weeks which was stopped for unknown reasons. At times her rashes
have been pruritic and her hands and joints are swollen in the
morning. Both her and her husband feel like her rashes are
worsening in that they are becoming "more red" and continuous.

IMAGING:
MRCP [**2193-12-25**] - small amount of ascites in upper abdomen , no
liver lesions, no biliary pathology, trace pleural effusions
bilaterally.
Abdominal US [**12-24**] - Normal
CXR [**2193-12-27**] - Minimal bilateral pleural effusions, otherwise
normal chest radiograph.
MR [**Last Name (Titles) **] [**2193-12-27**]:
1. Limited study, though there is evidence of diffuse muscle
edema in the
right upper extremity, most evident in the triceps. A more
complete exam can be performed when the patient is clinically
able to tolerate the exam.
2. Significant subcutaneous edema. Questionable edema tracking
along fascial planes. Correlate clinically to exclude
cellulitis.
3. Moderate right pleural effusion.
[**2193-12-28**] CT head:
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. A few
hypodense foci in the braina t the vertex- which are of
uncertain
significance- ? related to volume averaging/real. MR can be
considered for
better assessment if not CI.
MRI head [**2193-12-28**]:
Multiple T2 hyperintense foci within the cortex and subcortical
white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, as well as the
left-sided
periventricular white matter. However, such other entities as
posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES),
particularly given the distributino of the lesions and diffusion
findings, venous infarction, and a rare neoplastic condition
(intravascular lymphoma) could also be considered.
CT head [**2193-12-28**]:
No major vascular stenoses or occlusive processes.
MRV head [**2193-12-29**]:
No sign of venous sinus thrombosis. Multiple enhancing lesions
within the cerebral hemispheres and left periventricular white
matter.
Differential diagnosis includes encephalitis, multiple infarcts,
and perhaps posterior reversible encephalopathy, with the
appropriate clinical context needed for the latter diagnosis.
CT torso [**2193-12-29**]:
1. Bilateral moderate pleural effusions with overlying
atelectasis.
2. Diffuse and severe anasarca with bilateral effusions,
ascites,
subcutaneous and interfascial fluid.
3. Bowel wall thickening which is most likely secondary to
third-spacing.
Pelvic US [**2193-12-30**]:
1. Essentially nondiagnostic pelvic ultrasound due to inability
to position for the examination. Grossly normal transabdominal
appearance of the uterus and endometrium; neither ovary
visualized.
2. Free fluid in the pelvis consistent with ascites.
CT torso [**2194-1-1**]:
1. No etiology for hematocrit drop identified. Specifically, no
sites of
retroperitoneal or intramuscular hematoma noted.
2. Interval worsening in degree of subcutaneous and
intramuscular anasarca.  Increased size to bilateral pleural
effusions.
3. Persistent bilateral nephrograms in the setting of prior
contrast exposure possibly related to ATN.
KUB [**2194-1-8**]:
Large pneumoperitoneum.
CT torso [**2194-1-15**]:
1. No radiologic findings to suggest bowel ischemia.
2. Diffuse opacities involving the right middle lobe and left
lung base,
largely appearing atelectatic; however superimposed infection
may be present,
especially where multiple nodular opacities are seen closely
abutting the left fissure.
3. Diffuse ground-glass opacities involving the left upper lobe,
may be
infectious or inflammatory in nature, or representing focal
edema.
4. Small left pleural effusion with adjacent areas of
compressive
atelectasis, mar
