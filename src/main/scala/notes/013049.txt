Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 46117**] was admitted to the hospital and taken to the
Operating Room where she underwent tracheal reconstruction.  She
tolerated the procedure well and returned to the SICU in stable
condition.  See formal op note for details.

She remained intubated post op and was transferred to the SICU
for further management. She was sedated and oxygenated well over
the next few days while awaiting for the edema to decrease.  On
[**2156-2-2**] she returned to the Operating Room for bronchoscopy to
evaluate the anastomosis prior to extubation. She was
successfully extubated on [**2156-2-2**] and eventually had some
increased stridor for which she underwent assessment by ENT.
She was treated with Decadron and on FOE the patient has
immobile R TVC and hypo mobility of the L TVC with glottic
airway compromise. She was also treated with Heliox for a few
additional days and gradually improved. Her voice was improving
and she had much less dyspnea.

As she was improving daily, her steroids were weaned and she
underwent a video swallow on [**2156-2-5**] and did not aspirate.  Her
diet was gradually advanced and she was able to tolerate it
well.  Following transfer to the Surgical floor she continued to
make good progress.  She was up and walking independently but
did have some sinus tachycardia to 140 with ambulation.  She had
some orthostasis and was treated with a fluid bolus with effect.
 She had no palpitations or chest pain.

On [**2156-2-10**] she underwent a diagnostic bronchoscopy to evaluate
the suture line which appeared well approximated and she also
had some mucous plugs removed.  She recovered without incident
and had no respiratory compromise.  After a long hospital stay
she was discharge home on [**2156-2-11**] with minimal pain and she was
also sent home with nebulizer treatments to assist with
pulmonary toilet.
