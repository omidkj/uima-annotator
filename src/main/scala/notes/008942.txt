Service:  MEDICINE
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 51-year-old
female with a history of hypertension, anxiety disorder and
substance abuse who was admitted to the [**Hospital3 17309**] intensive care unit on [**2120-6-27**], two days after
undergoing an uncomplicated right knee arthroscopy as an
but had become progressively more lethargic over the course
of the second day following surgery.  By the evening, she had
developed deep Kussmaul respirations.

On presentation to [**Hospital3 17310**], she was in
acute renal failure with a creatinine of 3.3; preoperatively,
it was 1.4.  She was hypotensive, requiring Levophed at 20 mg
pressure in the 80s to 90s.  She also was noted to have a
non-anion gap metabolic acidosis.  She was found to have a
leukocytosis and spiked a temperature within 12 hours of
presentation.  She was also hypoxemic, requiring 100% oxygen
with a nonrebreather mask.  She was aggressively fluid
resuscitated and started on empiric antibiotics.  She was
intubated on [**2120-6-27**] for impending respiratory failure. The
patient was weaned off pressors there initially and her renal
function returned to baseline with resolution of her
acidosis.  She still had evidence of hypoxemia, probably
secondary to pulmonary edema from hypoalbuminemia and massive
fluid resuscitation.

The patient acutely worsened on [**2120-7-2**] with worsening
oxygenation and increasing PEEP requirements on ventilation.
Her chest x-ray looked markedly worsened and she began to
spike high fevers,and was hypotensive again requiring pressors to
keep her blood pressure in the 80s to 90s.  She was transferred
to [**Hospital1 69**] at that time.

ALLERGIES:  There were no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient was on disability.  She was
unmarried with a history of ethanol use and drug abuse, but
no history of intravenous drug abuse.  She lived with a
family and visited her mother often.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, the patient had a
temperature of 100.7??????F, a blood pressure of 108/62, a MAP of
79-80, a heart rate of 118-120, respirations of 20 and an
oxygen saturation of 99%.  Her vent settings were assist
control with tidal volume of 400, respiratory rate of 20,
PEEP of 20, FiO2 of 90%, PIP of 35-40 and plateau of 24-25.

Generally, the patient was an obese white female, sedated and
intubated.  On head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination,
the head was normocephalic and atraumatic.  The pupils were
equally round and reactive to light.  The extraocular muscles
were intact.  The mucous membranes were moist.  The sclerae
were anicteric.  There was no supraclavicular or cervical
lymphadenopathy present.  A right internal jugular catheter
was in place.  There was no jugular venous distention
detected.

On pulmonary examination, the patient had decreased breath
sounds at the left base anteriorly and laterally, but
otherwise the lungs were clear throughout with no evidence of
wheezes.  On cardiovascular examination, the patient had
distant heart sounds.  She was tachycardic with a normal S1
and S2 and no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  The abdomen was
obese with decreased bowel sounds.  The abdomen was slightly
distended with no hepatosplenomegaly.

Her groin showed a moist, erythematous rash in the
intertriginous region with a mild amount of yellow exudate at
the right groin.  A Foley catheter was in place, draining
yellow clear urine.  On rectal examination, the patient was
guaiac positive grossly with normal rectal tone.  In the
extremities, she had anasarca with no pitting edema and no
clubbing or cyanosis.  She did have an ecchymosis at the left
groin.  On neurological examination, the patient was sedated
but otherwise the examination was nonfocal.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, the patient had a white blood
cell count of 19,200, hemoglobin of 10.2, hematocrit of 31.9
and platelet count of 147,000.  Prothrombin time was 13.6,
partial thromboplastin time was 30.4 and INR was 1.2.  There
was an AST of 19, ALT of 14, CK of 46, alkaline phosphatase
of 100 and total bilirubin of 0.2.  There was a sodium of
149, potassium of 4.7, chloride of 114, bicarbonate of 26,
BUN of 43, creatinine of 1.2 and glucose of 146.  Calcium was
8.2, albumin was 3.0, phosphate was 4.3 and magnesium was
2.2.

RADIOLOGY DATA:  On a CT angiogram with contrast done on
[**2120-7-4**], there was no pulmonary embolism noted.  The tip of
the endotracheal tube was in the right main bronchus with
complete collapse of the left lung.  There was also an
extensive ground glass opacity in the right lung with more
focal areas of air space disease.  The ETT was pulled back about
3 cm when the patient got back to the MICU, with re-expansion of
the left lung. A ventilation perfusion scan was done on
[**2120-7-12**]. This was a limited study. However, no massive
pulmonary embolism was noted.  Bilateral lower extremity Doppler
studies done on [**2120-7-9**] showed a partially occlusive clot
involving the left common femoral vein.  The extent of the
cephalad venous involvement was unknown.

CARDIAC STUDIES:  An echocardiogram done on [**2120-7-8**] showed
the left atrium to be mildly dilated.  The overall left
ventricular systolic function was normal with an ejection
fraction of over 55%.  Due to a suboptimal technical quality,
a focal wall motion abnormality could not be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity was dilated and a free wall
might also be hypokinetic.  There was abnormal septal wall
motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure
volume overload.  No aortic regurgitation was present.  The
mitral valve leaflets were structurally normal with 1+ mitral
regurgitation present.  Severe 4+ tricuspid regurgitation was
seen.  There was at least moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  PULMONARY:  The patient was transferred here intubated on
high pressure ventilatory support.  Her ventilator settings
were a PEEP of 20, an FiO2 of 1.0, a PIP of 40 and a plateau
of 35.  The patient's acute respiratory failure post surgery
was concerning for a possible pulmonary embolism secondary to
fat embolism.  An echocardiogram done did not reveal evidence
of right heart strain and a CT angiogram on [**2120-7-4**] did not
show evidence of pulmonary embolism.  The patient was found,
however, to have a left lung collapse from a right mainstem
intubation.

The chest x-ray initially showed evidence of pneumonia,
probably secondary to aspiration.  Her chest x-rays continued
to worsen initially during her hospital admission and she was
thought to have respiratory failure secondary to adult
respiratory distress syndrome.  She was treated for
aspiration pneumonia with a full course of Levaquin and
Flagyl.

As there was some evidence for the use of steroids in the
setting of adult respiratory distress syndrome, the patient
was started on Solu-Medrol.  She was loaded at 200 mg and
then dosed at 50 mg intravenous q.i.d. times 14 days, then 25
mg intravenous q.i.d. ti
