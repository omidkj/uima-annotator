History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 43357**] is a 61 year old man with a history of Diabetes
Mellitus, End stage renal disease, Hypertension who developed
some unsteadiness at his home and fell while in the bathroom,
striking his head on Saturday, and subsequently presented to the
emergency department at [**Hospital1 487**] with respiratory failure. He
says that he fell in the shower because he slipped on some soap,
and at that time denied any chest pain or shortness of breath.
However, subsequently upon presenting to the emergency room, he
started to develop chest pain, which felt similar to the pain he
had had a few months ago at LGH. At LGH at that time, apparantly
he was told that he might be a candidate for cardiac surgery; he
was also evaluated at [**Hospital1 2025**] several years ago for surgery, which
ultimately did not materialize. Regardless, he had an CXR at LGH
that was interpreted as congestive heart failure, and was
dialyzed with the removal of four liters of fluid. He initally
was on the step down unit, but was transferred subsequently to
the ICU after more respiratory distress. He had cardiac enzymes
that were cycled and ruled in for an NSTEMI with elevated
tropinin I. Repeat CXR post dialysis showed upper and lower lobe
infiltrates consistent with PNA, and had a fever to 103. He was
placed on Zosyn and Zithromax for a presumed pneumonia, despite
negative cultures. Further cardiac workup included angiogram
which revealed multivessel coronary disease. He was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of surgical revascularization.

Radiology Report CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2126-4-15**] 9:21 AM

Final Report: Anterior mediastinal wires appear intact. A left
IJV line tip ends in the mid SVC.
A tiny left upper pneumothorax is again noted. There is no
pneumothorax on
the right. There is no pleural effusion. Interval decrease in
small right
retrocardiac opacity since prior study [**2126-4-13**]. Subtle opacity
in the left base is less conspicuous and likely represents
atelectasis.
The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.
IMPRESSION: Tiny small left upper pneumothorax.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
61 year old man with Hx DM, ESRD, HTN who fell at home, was
found to have an NSTEMI, and diffuse 3VD on cardiac
catheterization.

# CORONARIES/NSTEMI: The patient at OSH was notd to have an
NSTEMI with elevations in his troponin to a maximum of 2.74. At
our hospital, he was noted to have stable tropinins at
approximately 0.63. An EKG done from OSH on [**4-2**] shows ?RBBB as
well as ST depressions in V5 and V6, as well as elvations in V1
and AvR. A repeat EKG at [**Hospital1 18**] shows similar findings, with less
elvation in AvR, V1, and less depressions in V4, V5. Cardiac
catheterization from OSH report can be seen in the HPI, but
briefly had very diffuse 3VD. Gi
