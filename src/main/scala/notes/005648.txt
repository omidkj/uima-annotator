Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1945**]
Chief Complaint:
cough, fever, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 87940**] is a 46 year-old man with a history of CAD s/p CABG,
CHF with EF 15-20%, who presents with four days of cough, fever,
shortness of breath.  He states that normally he can walk around
his house without shortness of breath, but for the past couple
of days he has been unable to walk for more than a few steps.
This is accompanied by a cough that is intermittently productive
of clear sputum.  He has felt feverish but his max temperature
at home was 99. He has no sick contacts or recent travel.  He is
also newly unable to lie flat.  He does not take his weight
daily and has not noted any lower extremity swelling.  He
presented today to his PCP with all of these symptoms and was
referred to the ED.
.
In the ED, initial VS: 98.2 130 160/119 25 100% 10L  Exam
notable for crackles.  CXR concerning for pneumonia.  EKG was
unchanged from prior except for rate. He received a 500 cc fluid
bolus, after which his HR fell from sinus 140s to sinus 120s.
He was also given 40 mg IV lasix, vancomycin and levofloxacin.
VS prior to transfer: RR 32, 132/94, 100% on 4L, HR 120
.
On arrival to the ICU, Mr. [**Known lastname 87940**] has no complaints.  In
particular, he denies chest pain or shortness of breath at rest.
 He denies abdominal pain, nausea, vomitting.  His cough is
ongoing.

stents.
-systolic CHF with EF 20% on echo [**7-1**]

Social History:
He drinks 1 glass of wine per month and smokes 10 cigarettes
daily.  He is self-employed as a landscaper.


Family History:
Both his father and paternal grandfather had heart disease.

GEN: pleasant, comfortable but tachypneic
HEENT: neck supple, JVP at 9 cm, no LAD
RESP: reduced breath sounds and faint crackles at the bases
bilaterally.  No wheezing.
CV: regular, unable to appreciate any murmur but difficult given
tachycardia
ABD: nontender, nondistended
EXT: trace bilateral pitting edema
SKIN: no rashes/no jaundice/no splinters

[**12-4**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Markedly limited study with cardiomegaly
and mild congestion.  Vague right upper lung opacity could
reflect pneumonia though technique is significantly limited.
Consider repeat with more optimized technique to better assess.

[**12-6**] ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is severely depressed (LVEF= 15 %) with
anteroseptal/anterior/apical akinesis and hypokinesis elsewhere.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. Mitral regurgitation is present but cannot be
quantified (may be mild to moderate). There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

[**12-8**] CT-Chest
IMPRESSION:

Right greater than left ground-glass opacities without
significant
interlobular septal thickening appear grossly stable when the
scout topogram is compared to multiple prior plain radiographic
examinations, although mild progression in the left upper lobe
is noted. Given the patient's history of severe cardiac
decompensation, this could represent pulmonary edema. However,
given the asymmetric appearance as well as the clinical
presentation and the predominantly apical distribution, a
community- acquired pneumonia or mycobacterial infection is
likely.

Brief Hospital Course:
A 46 year-old man with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy with
EF 15-20% presents with shortness of breath, fever, cough,
hypoxia consistent with PNA.
.
# Pneumonia:  Patient with fever, cough, hypoxia and evidence of
infiltrate on CXR and CT-chest, all suggestive of pneumonia. He
has no recent healthcare association.  His sinus tachycardia on
admission was most likely a manifestation of infection and
fever, although difficult to assess volume status (as below),
and he may have been total body overloaded as well. Continued
ceftriaxone and azithromycin for community-acquired pneumonia
which was completed in hospital. Sent blood and sputum cultures
as well as legionella urinary antigens.

# CHF:  EF 15-20% in [**2138**]. ICD in place for primary prevention.
CHF on admission presumably secondary to prior ischemic events.
On 40 mg PO lasix but not currently taking.  Volume status is
difficult to assess.  JVP is only slightly elevated, and hypoxia
is moderate.  For now we will treat infectious picture with IVF
and plan to diurese as needed in the future. Home lasix was
held, continued ACEI (will switch to a lower dose of
short-acting captopril), beta blocker restarted at lower dose
Volume status has been a big issue as he was initially given
IVFs given his PNA, but then developed flash pulmonary edema and
required diuresis with Lasix.  He responded extremely well to IV
Lasix and was net negative 4.5L.  With this diuresis he also
bumped his Cr and became tachycardic requiring small boluses to
rehydrate. A repeat ECHO on this admission showed a similar EF:
15-20%.
.
# History of apical thrombus:  chronically anticoagulated.
Warfarin is the only medication he has actually been taking
recently.  INR currently 3.1.
warfarin was continued during this admission with planned INR
check as outpatient.
.
# ARF: likely [**2-27**] volume status, downtrending during admission
with outpatient Creatinine follow-up scheduled.
.
# CAD:  no evidence of ischemia on admission. continued ASA,
statin, beta blocker
