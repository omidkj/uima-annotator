Chest x-ray was pending.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was brought emergently to the Neuro
Angio Diagnostic Suite on [**2181-10-5**] where she underwent GDC
embolization and coiling for grade 1 ACOM aneurysm.
Postoperatively she had a decline in mental status post her
procedure requiring reintubation.  A stat head CT showed
ventriculomegaly.   A right frontal ventriculostomy.  Catheter
was placed emergently, and the patient tolerated the
procedure well.  Patient was admitted to the Intensive Care
Unit for q. one-hour neuro checks.  She was started on Kefzol
for her drain prophylaxis.  Was kept NPO.  Started on
Protonix and Nimodipine.  Her blood pressure was kept less
than 140.

On her first postoperative day on [**2181-10-6**] temperature was
96.4, heart rate 64, blood pressure was 99 to 120s/upper 30s
to 50s.  ICT was 6 to 8, CBP 54 to 76, Dilantin was 4.9.
Patient was opening eyes to voice, following commands.
Pupils were 3.5 to 3 to ambient light.  Her right femoral
site was intact with good distal pulses.  Postoperative
hematocrit was 26.5.  She was given one unit of blood and
given a 500 mg bolus of Dilantin.  She was attempted to be
weaned from the ventilator.

She was extubated on [**2181-10-7**] without problems.  She was
awake, alert, and oriented to [**Hospital6 2018**].  Pupils were 1.5 and trace reactive.  IPs were [**5-21**].

On [**2181-10-10**] patient had a temperature of 101.2.  Blood
pressures have been in the 150s to 180s, CBP 7 to 19, ICP 3
to 9.  She remained fluid negative, 1500 cc in 24-hour
period.  She remained awake, alert, and oriented times three.
Her upper and lower extremities motor strength was [**5-21**].  Her
groin site was intact without a hematoma.  She was given
fluid boluses p.r.n. and albumin 25% q. 8 hours to keep her
CBP 8 to 10.  Systolic blood pressure ranges 160 to 180, and
Nimodipine was decreased to 30 q. 4 hours.  Her drain was
increased to 15 mm above her tragus, 50 mm of water above her
tragus, and she was kept on Triple H therapy.  On [**2181-10-6**]
her drain was increased to 20 mm above and she tolerated that
well, remaining awake, alert, and oriented times three.  Her
blood pressures were in the 180 range.

On [**2181-10-12**] patient became short of breath and tachycardiac
with hypertension and having difficulty breathing.  She was
awake, alert, had bilateral wheezing.  EKG showed some
changes in V1.  Gas was 7.39, 33, 69, -321.  CK was 192.
Respiratory distress was improved with 100% non-rebreather.
Ativan was given for anxiety.  The patient still seemed
tachycardiac with sats in the 94%.  Chest x-ray was difficult
to read.  She was given some Lopressor to help blockage her
blood pressure, and she was ruled out for a myocardial
infarction.  She was given 10 mg of Lasix, which helped, and
gave her less shortness of breath.

On [**2181-10-14**] her T-max was 101.8, blood pressure 160s to
180s, CBP 8 to 22, ICP 3 to 11.  She was awake, alert,
oriented.  No further respiratory problems.  [**Name (NI) **]
ventriculostomy drain was increased to 25 mm of water above
the tragus.  She had a chest x-ray which showed bibasilar
atelectasis, bilateral pleural effusions.  She also had an
echocardiogram which showed ejection fraction of 50 to 55%,
3+ mitral valve regurgitation, and 1 to 2+ aortic
insufficiency.  Tiny anterior pericardial infusion, no
tamponade.

On [**2181-10-14**] her drain was clamped.  She was given two units
of fresh frozen plasma and one unit of packed red blood cells
for a hematocrit of 29 with an ANR of 1.4.  Cultures had all
been negative except for some yeast in her sputum for prior
temperature workups.  With her drain increased to 25 she had
a severe headache and nauseated, so that was opened at 25 and
her headache improved.

On [**2181-10-15**] her INR was 1.7.  She was given two units of
fresh frozen plasma and she was given a Dilantin bolus due to
her Dilantin level of 5.5.  Her ICPs were in 3 to 11 range.

On [**2181-10-16**] she was started on Salt Tabs for a sodium of 131.
ICPs were in the 7 to 10 range.  Drain was again attempted
to be clamped on [**2181-10-16**], and the drain was discontinued
on [**2181-10-17**].  Repeat head CT showed no increase in size of
her ventricles.  Her culture workups were negative.

On [**2181-10-18**] she was transferred to the regular Surgical
floor, where she remained awake, alert, and oriented, moving
all of her extremities, continued on Salt Tabs.  She was seen
