noticed increasing dyspnea on exertion and chest pain/angina
which presents as indigestion.  Over the past month these
symptoms have worsened, so that now he is dyspneic with
ambulation.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  A construction worker who lives at home with
his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] reports occasional alcohol use and remote
tobacco use (quit in [**2121**]).

FAMILY HISTORY:   A positive family history with early deaths
after myocardial infarctions.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Cardiac catheterization showed severe
pulmonary hypertension with pulmonary artery pressures of
80/35, and a wedge of 18.  Right coronary artery 100%
occlusion.  Left anterior descending artery 95% occluded.
Left circumflex 100% occlusion with an ejection fraction of
25%.

Electrocardiogram showed first-degree atrioventricular block
with a rate of 55, a right bundle-branch, with Q waves in II,
III, aVF, and V6.  Flipped T waves in V1 through V4.  ST
depressions in V1 through V3.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Pulmonary
function tests revealed FEV1 was 66% of predicted value,
FEV1:FVC was 91% of predicted value, and FVC 72% of predicted
value with diffusing capacity of lungs for carbon monoxide of
46% of predicted value.  Peripheral laboratory values from
the outside hospital revealed white blood cell count was 5.2,
hematocrit was 44, platelets were 103.  Sodium was 139,
potassium was 4.8,  chloride was 101, bicarbonate was 29,
blood urea nitrogen was 40, creatinine was 1.7, and blood
glucose was 167.  PTT was 76.9 (on heparin at 1400 units)
with an INR of 1.07.  Urinalysis was negative from the
outside hospital.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed heart rate was 53, blood pressure was 110/50,
respiratory rate was 16, oxygen saturation was 94% on room
air.  In general, an older gentleman in no acute distress.
Neurologically, alert and oriented times three.  Moved all
extremities, conversant.  Cranial nerves II through XII were
grossly intact.  Sensation and motor were intact.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed pupils were
equally round and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements
were intact.  Sclerae were anicteric.  Mucous membranes were
moist.  Oropharynx with no erythema or exudate.  No lesions.
The neck was supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  No bruits.
Respiratory examination was clear to auscultation
bilaterally; although diminished bilaterally in the bases.
Heart revealed regular rate and rhythm.  Normal first heart
sound and second heart sound.  A 3/6 systolic ejection
murmur.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.
Normal active bowel sounds.  No hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities were cool with 1+ pedal edema with venous stasis
color changes.  No varicosities were noted.  Pulse
examination revealed carotids were 2+ bilaterally, radially
were 2+ bilaterally, femoral were 2+ bilaterally, dorsalis
pedis and posterior tibialis pulses were 1+ bilaterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   On the morning of [**10-5**], the patient
was brought to the operating room.  Please see the operating
room report for full details.

In summary, the patient had an off-pump coronary artery
bypass graft times two with a saphenous vein graft to the
left anterior descending artery and a saphenous vein graft to
the diagonal.  He tolerated the operation and was transferred
from the operating room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care
Unit.  At the time of transfer, the patient had Levophed at
0.6 mcg/kg per minute, Milrinone at 0.25 mcg/kg per minute,
and propofol at 10 mcg/kg per minute.

During the immediate postoperative period, the patient was
noted to have continued pulmonary hypertension with pulmonary
artery pressures in the 50/25 range, requiring nitric oxide
initially at 30 parts per million, weaned to 5 parts per
million overnight on the day of the surgery.

On postoperative day one, the patient was weaned from
sedation and successfully extubated.  His nitrous was also
weaned to off.  Milrinone, which had been shut off on the day
of surgery, was restarted at 0.25.  The patient was also
started on Levaquin postoperatively for sputum which showed
4+ gram-negative rods and 1+ gram-positive cocci.

Additionally, the Electrophysiology Service as well as the
Heart Failure Service were consulted on postoperative day two
for assistance in the management of the patient's atrial
fibrillation as well as pulmonary hypertension and advanced
heart failure.

Over the next several days, several attempts were made to
wean the patient's Milrinone to off; each time meeting with
elevated pulmonary artery pressures as well as sagging
cardiac indices requiring reinstitution of Milrinone.  During
that time, the patient was also direct current cardioverted
into a normal sinus rhythm.  By postoperative day fifteen,
the patient was finally weaned off of his Milrinone.  He
remained in the Intensive Care Unit.
