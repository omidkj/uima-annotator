Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to Dr.[**Name (NI) 12822**] surgical service on [**2150-7-21**]
for treatment of her bleeding per rectum and imaging concerns of
fre intraperitoneal air. Patient continued to pass several large
bloody bowel movements, and her hematocrit dropped as low as
18%. She was taken directly to the surgical intensive care unit
where she was resuscitated. Her coagulopathy was reversed with
six units fresh frozen plasma and a total of seven units of
packed red blood cells were transfused. Her hemodynamics
remained stable; however she did develop respiratory distress
and required fairly urgent intubation in the ICU. Given the
presence of perforated diverticulitis with free intraperitoneal
air, as well as her gastrointestinal bleeding and need for
long-term anticoagulation, the decision was made by the team and
family for an urgent total abdominal colectomy and end ileostomy
in order to remove all of the colon at risk.

On [**7-21**], she was taken to the operating room for a total
abdominal colectomy, end ileostomy, and small-bowel resection
with stapled side-to-side anastomosis. The patient tolerated the
procedure well without complications. She was transferred
directly to the surgical intensive care unit postoperatively for
monitoring. Patient remained intubated.

Neuro: On [**2150-7-23**], SICU staff noticed patient with LUE weakness.
Concerns for stroke given recent history of CVA and sudden
episode of atrial fibrillation. Stroke and neurology consulted
for complete workup. TTE, MRI of head, neck, carotid US were
ordered. Patient started on statin, aspirin and heparin drip for
possibility of embolic event. Imaging studies unchanged and did
not reveal any new onset acute processes. However, there was a
study from OSH suggesting PFO, possibly contributing to CVA.
Plan to keep patient anticoagulated with heparin drip. As per
neurology, patient was taken off heparin drip on [**2150-7-27**]. On [**8-11**]
coumadin was restarted.

With ventilatory status, patient kept on propofol for muscle
relaxation and sedative effects. She was weaned off propofol and
provided with intermittent versed on [**2150-8-1**] which she only
tolerated briefly. She remained on propofol to keep sedated
while on assist control ventilation. She eventually was taken
off propofol while ventilatory status maintained on pressure
support via tracheostomy.

Cardio: On [**7-23**], patient's cardiac rhythm spontaneously changed
to atrial fibrillation with RVR, rate 110-130. Diltiazem started
and rhythm converted back. She developed atrial fibrillation
later on during hospital stay but convereted with lopressor
dosing. Patient remained hemodynamically stable postoperatively.
She did receive 2 units of pRBC for low Hct of 23. Hct remained
stable throughout remaining of hospital course (Hct 29 for
[**2150-8-6**]). Findings of patent foramen ovale from outside hospital
imaging, possibly contributing to etiology of stroke. Will keep
anticoagulated.
[**7-24**] Diltiazem weaned ventilatror weaned and Tube feeds were
increased

leukocytosis vanco and zosyn were started empirically propofol

[**8-18**] Tolerated Trach mask; PICC replaced

Resp: Patient was first extubated on [**2150-7-22**]. However, due to
tachypnea and ongoing repiratory distress, she was immediately
reintubated. Throughout hospital course, patient's vent and
pressure support were weaned but she was not able to tolerate
trials. Patient with increased work of breathing and instant
oxygen desaturations with tachycardia. Patient does have history
of COPD and did require home oxygen for ambulating and
occasionally at night. With her pulmonary condition and poor
ability to tolerate ventilation weans, decision reached for
patient to have a percutaneous tracheostomy for long-term
ventilator dependence. On [**2150-7-31**], tracheostomy placed without
any complications. She will be discharged to vent rehab for
further monitoring and treatment.

GI: Patient placed with nasogastric tube to help with gastric
decompression after procedure. Her ileostomy was patent, stoma
was pink and ostomy started producing outflow. She was started
on
