Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory failure transfer from OSH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
- Esophagastroduodenoscopy [**2148-8-16**]
.
- Trach per OSH [**2148-8-9**]
- PEG tube per OSH [**2148-8-12**]
- L SC central line per OSH [**2148-8-10**]


History of Present Illness:
71 y.o. female with a h/o T2DM c/b PNP, systolic CHF (EF 40% in
[**2146**]), CRI (Cr baseline around 1.2-1.6), COPD, PVD s/p femoral
bypass and R great toe amputation in [**2145**], hypothyroidism p/w
AMS and respiratory distress to OSH, was intubated, now
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after trach/PEG.
.
Pt was in USOH several weeks ago until she went on a cruise in
the Carribean. One day prior to docking in [**Location (un) 2848**], the patient
became confused. She was sent to OSH ED on [**7-26**], was found to be
in respiratory distress and with continued AMS, intubated and
transferred to OSH ICU. CNS w/u only showed a questionable 3mm R
ICA aneurysm but no acute process. However, she was found to
have CHF exacerbation with pulmonary edema, was diuresed but
still could not be weaned from the vent. Her course was c/b an
NSTEMI and acute on chronic renal failure that has resolved. She
spiked at the OSH and was empirically treated with Zosyn and
Vanco but was off any abx on transfer. Cultures were
unrevealing. Due to continued failure to extubate, pt received
trach ([**8-9**]) and PEG ([**8-12**]). She was transferred for further
management to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
ROS: Not obtained due to sedation of pt.

IMAGING
CXR [**2148-8-14**]:
Findings are consistent with CHF and pulmonary edema. Interval
placement of a left-sided IJ approach central venous line with
its tip at the level of the proximal SVC. Interval tracheostomy
tube placement.
.
EGD [**2148-8-16**]:
Study showed medium hiatal hernia, nodularity in the antrum,
ulcer in the stomach body

Brief Hospital Course:
.
The following is her hospital course by problem:
.
# Respiratory failure: Pt was admitted from the OSH with a
tracheostomy (placed on [**8-9**]) for respiratory failure and
difficulty weaning  off of the ventilator. Respiratory failure
was thought likely multifactorial in etiology, including CHF
with pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions, ? hx of
COPD, hypothyroidism. Infectious process thought unlikely given
that she has been afebrile and without leukocytosis.  She was
admitted on assist control ventilation and during the course of
admission was weaned to pressure support with PS 5 and PEEP 5.
She was also treated with standing albuterol and atrovent nebs
as well as fluticasone. She was gently diuresed with IV lasix
and responded well.
.
# GI bleed: She has chronic anemia with baseline hct around
27-30 but trended down to 21 on admission. She was transfused
with one unit pRBCs and her hct bumped appropriately. EGD on
[**8-16**] found oozing ulcer in stomach. No intervention was
performed. Hct stable, 28 at discharge. On IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]. Initially
 held ASA and plavix for bleeding. Re-started ASA on discharge.
Hematocrit should be checked 2 days after discharge.
.
# New onset atrial fibrillation: Mostly likely due to CHF, has a
hx of CAD, also had NSTEMI at OSH. Pt was also found to be
profoundly hypothyroid (freeT4 of 0.71, TSH 35) so her
levothyroxine dose was increased from 50 to 100 mcg daily and
then decreased to 75 with plans to increase slowly. Converted to
sinus rhythm. She was rate-controlled on Metoprolol 50 mg TID.
Anticoagulation was deferred given recent GI bleed, however this
will need to be addressed as an outpatient.
.
# AMS: It remains unclear what caused her initial change in MS
upon admission to the OSH. Neuro w/u at the OSH was unrevealing
except for questionable CNS aneurysm, which is unlikely to be
related. Hypothyroidism possibly contributed. Pt was treated for
UTI with a 7-day course of cipro based on a dirty UA at the OSH.
On discharge, she is mentating well and stable.
.
# Systolic CHF: EF of 40% from [**2146**], low EF on ECHO from [**8-16**].
Initially with pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, and anasarca.
Volume status improved with gentle diuresis with IV lasix. CXR
showed persistent pleural effusions but peripheral edema
resolved. Continued BB and [**Last Name (un) **] therapy while in house.  She was
discharged on 40mg PO lasix [**Hospital1 **] with the goal of continued
gentle diuresis. The need for diuresis should be reassessed by
her primary care physician as an outpatient. Would check
electrolytes 2 days after discharge while on diuresis.
.
# CAD with h/o NSTEMI at OSH; also old hx of NSTEMI with cath
[**7-/2146**]:
Her BB, crestor, and [**Last Name (un) **] were continued. ASA and plavix were
held initially for GI bleed. ASA was re-started on discharge. It
is unclear when she was started on plavix, likely at the OSH.
Plavix should be held for now until she follows up with her
primary care provider.
.
# Presumed UTI from OSH: She had a dirty U/A at the OSH, urine
cx here was negative. This is also in the setting of chronic
foley. She was treated with a 7-day course of ciprofloxacin.
This may also have contributed to her altered mental status.
.
# Hypothyroidism:
On admission here she was found to be profoundly hypothyroid--
freeT4 of 0.71, TSH 35.  She was on synthroid 88 mcg daily at
home and transferred here on 50 mcg daily. Her dose was
increased to 75 mcg on discharge. Her dose will likely need to
be further increased and TFTs should be monitored as an
oupatient.
.
# DMII: Covered with lantus and RISS.  She was discharged on
this regimen.
.
# Chronic Kidney Disease: Likely secondary to DM, HTN. She has
remained at her baseline creatinine level (1.5 from OSH
records).
.
# Code: Full (confirmed with husband)
