[**2167-7-10**] Right and Left Foot XRays
LEFT FOOT:
A soft tissue defect is seen along the medial aspect of the
first MTP joint.
There is no evidence of underlying periosteal reaction,
osteopenia or cortical
destruction to suggest osteomyelitis.

Degenerative changes are seen throughout the DIP joints and
great toe IP joint
as well as the intertarsal joints. Note is made of both plantar
and dorsal
calcaneal spurs. Degenerative changes are also seen at the
tibiotalar joint.

RIGHT FOOT:
No soft tissue abnormalities appreciated on this right foot
x-ray. No
evidence of subcutaneous gas. No evidence of periosteal
reaction,
osteopenia or cortical destruction to suggest osteomyelitis.
Arterial
calcifications are visualized.

Degenerative changes are seen throughout the IP joints,
intertarsal joints and
tibiotalar joint. Plantar and dorsal calcaneal spurs are also
seen in the
right foot.

---------------
[**2167-7-10**] CXR -  Bibasilar atelectasis. No acute cardiopulmonary
abnormality.

Right LE US - [**2167-7-14**] -
Limited study. No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the
right common
femoral vein, proximal superficial femoral vein, popliteal or
calf veins.
Evaluation of the right mid and distal superficial femoral vein
was limited, and deep venous thrombosis cannot be excluded
secondary to limitations

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Foot Ulcers
She was initially admitted to the podiatry service on [**2167-7-10**]
for debridement of left foot wound. She was evaluated by
vascular surgery who performed right side angiography, revealing
significant SFA and popliteal disease which was not intervened
upon. She was covered with cipro/flagyl/vanco (Day 1 = [**2167-7-10**]),
and remained afebrile without leukocytosis throughout her
hospital course.  She was then transitioned to bactrim to
complete a 2 week course of outpatient therapy, last day
[**2167-7-28**]. She will be following up in 1 week with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. She
will have home VNA for assistance with daily dressing changes.

2. Seizures
She was to be discharged to home with TMP/SMX and then follow-up
with podiatry in one week. On the morning of likely discharge
while eating breakfast, she asked to be transferred to the
comode to pass a BM. On the comode she describes acute onset of
nausea and weakness. She then was witnessed to have multiple,
recurrent brief episodes of "staring spells" during which she
was unresponsive. In between these episodes she responded
appropriately to voice. Based on concern for seizures, she was
given ativan 1mg x 2 without response. Neurology consult was
obtained who described persistant complex partial status, and
recommended ativan 2mg x 1 with subsequent dilantin loading. The
pt remained in status for ~30-45 min.
 By report, during the episode, her O2 sats dropped to 79%RA,
but BP was stable. Post event, transfer note indicates VS 98.8
109/68 92 14 98%3L. Immediately after her the seizures, pt was
with the above vital signs, sitting up in bed, somnolent,
responsive to voice. Her somnolence intermittently resolved,
notably upon the arrival of her PCP whom she recognized and
spoke with. MICU transfer was requested in the setting of
persistent complex partial status for closer airway monitoring
and for evaluation of potential contribution by patient's
multiple medical conditions. Etiology of her seizures was
thought likely related to poorly controlled seizures, further
triggered by infection and decreased seizure threshold in the
setting of quinolone therapy.
  On the floor, she remained seizure free. She refused EEG as
recommended by Neuro. She was started on Zonegram per Neuro in
addition to her home Carbamazepine. IV Dilantin was
discontinued. CT Head was negative for bleed. She was resumed on
her home coumadin. Pt has an appt scheduled with neuro for
follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**], given limited availability of
appts with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. She was given the number to call to
check for cancellations with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
