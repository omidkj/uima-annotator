CHEST, AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE VIEW: Left basilar opacity may
represent
atelectasis, although infection/pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Heart size is normal. Mediastinal contours are normal. Dense
calcifications of the aortic arch are unchanged. Osseous
structures are unchanged.

IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe opacity, infection/pneumonia cannot
be excluded.

AP SUPINE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: There is patchy left lower lobe
opacity which
silhouettes the diaphragm and has increased since [**2178-12-23**]. The
upper lungs
are clear. There is a small left pleural effusion. There is no
pneumothorax.  Moderate degenerative changes in the
thoracolumbar spine are unchanged.

IMPRESSION: Worsening left lower lobe pneumonia.

LENIs: No evidence of bilateral lower extremity DVT

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 78 y.o female with h.o COPD, HTN, recent MVA with
R.ankle/foot fx who presented with hypoxia and LLL infiltrate.

1. [**Hospital 25730**] Healthcare associated pneumonia/[**Name (NI) 15305**]
Pt was admitted from rehab with hypoxia and tachycardia, and was
found to have LLL infiltrate concerning for HAP. She also had
leukocytosis, cough, hypotension (fluid responsive), and
low-grade temperature.
Pt was managed in the ICU with broad-spectrum antibiotics, with
Vanc and Cefepime, and these were continued on the floor for
ongoing treatment. Pt's respiratory status gradually improved to
near baseline. She will continue on vancomycin and cefepime for
HAP for 8 day course. Oxygen should be weaned at rehab (on
discharge was mid 90's on RA, 98% on 2L). Additionally her WBC
generally improved with treatment, however increased to 19 on
day of discharge. Clinically she appeared well with all VS and
exam improving and no new signs or symptoms of infection so she
was felt stable for discharge but her CBC should be monitored on
[**12-31**] to ensure it is falling.

2. COPD: provided nebulizers to treat possible superimposed COPD
flare.  Steroids were not provided considering pneumonia. She
was continued on advair as well.

3. Hypertension, benign: Initially her bp meds were held given
her sepsis, they were restarted and actually uptitrated given
hypertension so lisinopril increased from home dose of 5mg daily
to 10mg dialy, also continued on lasix.

4. Acute renal failure: Cr 2.6 on admission, returned to
baseline. Likely due to sepsis/hypovolemia. Given the change her
vanco trough was monitored and dose adjusted accordingly.

5. Anemia: likey due to operative losses (from foot repair),
iron deficiency, ACD, and critical illness. No e/o bleed. She
was started on iron supplements with bowel regimen for
constipation.

6. Depression, NOS: she was continued on fluoxetine.

7. Ankle fracture: on Lovenox DVT ppx per Ortho for 30 days
(starting [**12-10**]); continue through [**1-10**]. Given hospitalization
she missed her scheduled follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 7376**]. Repeat
appointment was attempted to be scheduled for her
unsuccessfully, so this will need to be scheduled within 1 week
of discharge.

8. Chronic pain: neurontin restarted on discharge.
