Radiographic studies:
[**12-4**] CXR:
IMPRESSION:
1. Developing right upper lobe infiltrate.
2. Continued bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar
atelectasis.
3. Findings concerning for mild congestive failure.
.
[**12-8**] CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. Migration of gastric tube into the rectus sheath. There is a
clear
connection, however, into the stomach and no evidence for free
air or free
fluid. Repositioning of tube is recommended.
2. No radiographic explanation for falling hematocrit.
3. Multiple incidental findings including right staghorn
calculus, porcelain gallbladder, anasarca, bilateral pleural
effusions with associated atelectasis, and severe
atherosclerotic disease.
.
[**12-9**] CXR:
Compared to the study from the prior day, there is increased
vascular
congestion and increased volume loss in both lower [**Known lastname **]s. An
underlying
infectious infiltrate cannot be excluded. Diffuse alveolar
opacities are
again seen.
