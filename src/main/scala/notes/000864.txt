HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient is a 55-year-old
man status post cadaveric renal transplant on [**2145-4-21**],
complicated by wound hematoma and opening of the wound.  The
patient has been managed on an outpatient basis with a VAC
dressing and has been discharged to rehabilitation prior to
this admission.  The patient presented today to the Clinic
where an exposed renal graft was noted in the wound.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.9 degrees Fahrenheit,
heart rate 83, blood pressure 182/86, respiratory rate 20 and
oxygen saturation 100 percent on room air.  The patient was
awake and alert in no apparent distress.  The patient's heart
was in regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
His abdomen was noted to have a wound VAC dressing in place;
otherwise, it was soft, non-tender, non-distended,
normoactive bowel sounds.  His extremities were warm.  Distal
pulses were two plus and he had no peripheral edema in both
lower extremities and slight peripheral edema in his left
upper extremity at the site of where he had a prior fistula
for hemodialysis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  At this point the patient was admitted to
[**Hospital1 69**] and was continued on his
prior medications from a recent discharge medicine list and
his VAC was placed to continuous suction.  The patient was
also followed by the Renal Transplant Service who also noted
his creatinine to reveal excellent graft function.  The
patient was on vancomycin during this time one gram q. 48h.
to protect against potential wound pathogens.  The plan at
this time was to have Plastic Surgery to see the patient to
evaluate a possible wound flap to cover the exposed graft.
On [**2145-6-29**], hospital day five, the patient continued to
progress well.  Was voiding without complaint and the service
was waiting for Plastic Surgery evaluation at this time for
potential wound flap coverage.  The patient's vital signs
were stable during this time.  The patient was afebrile
throughout his hospital stay up until this point.  The
patient was given nutritional supplements with meals, Boost
three times a day, and on [**2145-6-30**], the patient was
visited by the Plastic Surgery service.  On [**2145-6-30**],
the patient was found in his room to be complaining of
feeling hot and generally "not well."  Vital signs were taken
revealing a blood pressure of 204/109 with a heart rate of
144, breathing at 70 percent on room air.  The patient
received 5 mg of intravenous push Lopressor.  Blood pressure
at this point was 208/111, heart rate 137.  Blood gases were
drawn.  Electrolytes and blood cultures were sent and Foley
catheter was inserted.  A second dose of intravenous
Lopressor was given and his blood pressure was 206/90 at this
point, heart rate of 137 and at this point 10 mg of
intravenous Lopressor was hung and 10 mg was pushed.  The
patient continued to have labored breathing.  Was alert and
oriented but sleepy and arousable.  Chest x-ray revealed what
looked like a likely pneumonia.  Electrocardiogram showed
sinus tachycardia.  His blood gases at this point were pO2 of
82, pCO2 of 54 and a pH of 7.19.  The patient at this point
was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit.  A
central venous line was also placed at this point without
complications with the patient having insufficient peripheral
access for the purpose of ABG drawing, hemodynamic
monitoring.  The patient at this point was on metoprolol on
hydralazine 25 mg q. 6h.  The plan was for serial ABG's.  The
patient was placed on nonrebreathable oxygen mask.  On the
same day Plastic Surgery saw the patient and recommended that
patient would likely benefit from right gracilis flap to
protect and cover the open wound with kidney graft exposed.
The patient was then consulted to see Cardiology after this
bout of respiratory distress and sinus tachycardia who
recommended tighter blood pressure control and metoprolol was
thus restarted at a dose of 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. and aspirin
was continued 325 mg q. day.  On SICU day two, the patient
was noted to be significantly improved and vital signs were
within normal limits.  His blood pressure was 161/82 at this
point and he was saturating at 95 percent on room air with a
heart rate of 83.  The patient at this point was on
vancomycin, Zosyn and Bactrim.  This was the second day of
Zosyn.  At this point the plan was for Plastic Surgery, after
seeing the patient on hospital day eight, [**2145-7-2**], to
bring the patient to the Operating Room on Monday for likely
gracilis flap, possible rectus flap and they would pre-op the
patient for surgery.  The patient then was transferred back
to the floor later in the day after noted to be doing very
well.  His vital signs were stable.  The patient was
saturating well and his heart rate and blood pressure were
within normal limits.  Blood pressure at this point was
115/68.  He had no complaints of shortness of breath or chest
pain at this time.  On the 17th day of [**Month (only) 30676**] hospital day
nine, the patient continued to progress well and the patient
was scheduled for stress echocardiogram as preoperative
evaluation after events that led to the patient being
transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit.
Echocardiogram revealed moderate inferior wall hypokinesis
with an ejection fraction of approximately 27-28 percent and
it was determined at this point that the patient would likely
benefit from cardiac catheterization.  The patient, however,
required two negative sets of blood cultures which were drawn
on the 16th and [**7-3**] which eventually came back
negative and the patient was brought to cardiac
catheterization on [**7-9**] revealing that the patient had
normal coronary arteries.  No signs of stenosis.  Ejection
fraction at this point was noted to be in the mid 30's,
approximately 35 percent.  The patient continued to progress
well during his hospital stay, was afebrile and without
complaint and at this point was awaiting possible of Plastic
Surgery flap closure for his open wound.  The patient was
also followed by Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy
who suggested that the patient would likely benefit from a
stint in rehabilitation before being discharged to home and,
upon learning that the patient would not be able to be
scheduled for plastic surgery closure until the following
week, likely to occur on [**7-20**] or 4th of [**2144**], it was
determined that the patient could be discharged to
rehabilitation on the wound VAC.

The patient was stable on the day of discharge.  The patient
was afebrile.  The rest of his vital signs were within normal
limits.
