ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  Neck mass.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Death.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  This is a 78-year-old male with an
enlarging neck mass.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 78-year-old male with a 6-
week history of a sore throat, dysphagia and difficulty
breathing who appeared to have a thyroid mass on exam by his
physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] underwent a CT scan with fine needle aspiration
which was indeterminate in an outside hospital and he was
seen by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who felt that based on the
symptoms of his thyroid mass that it may be a thyroid cancer.
He was therefore booked for an operative thyroidectomy. The
patient was admitted to the hospital on [**4-24**] of [**2187**] for
thyroidectomy.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Past medical history is significant
for peripheral vascular disease, aortic aneurysm, CREST
syndrome, scleroderma, CAD with CHF, paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation, iron deficiency anemia, gout, chronic renal
failure, deep venous thrombosis, asbestosis, hypertension,
hypothyroidism.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Past surgical history is significant
for bilateral femoral to dorsal pedal bypass grafts with
saphenous vein for treatment of bilateral thrombosed
popliteal aneurysms.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin, Synthroid, Lopressor,
Protonix, Lasix, insulin.

ALLERGIES:  An allergy to Coumadin as well as a questionable
allergy to heparin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is married with 6 children, a retired
electrician, 1 pack per day smoking history for 4 years. He
quit 45 years ago. He rarely drank alcohol.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Significant for occasional shortness of
breath, dyspnea on exertion, otherwise unremarkable.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the surgical
service and on [**6-26**], underwent a neck exploration with
biopsy of the central portion of the thyroid and tracheostomy
for an obstructing goiter. That was subsequently revealed to
be lymphoma. On the 31st, he underwent a percutaneous
endoscopic gastrostomy for nutrition. He was seen by
hematology/oncology on [**6-28**] for treatment of his B-cell
lymphoma and he was transferred to the hematology/oncology
service for that. On [**7-3**], however, he underwent a CT scan
for abdominal pain and was found to have a ruptured
retroperitoneal aortic aneurysm. He was emergently taken to
the operating room by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] and he underwent a repair
of a ruptured aortic aneurysm. Postoperatively, he was noted
to have pale bilateral lower extremities. By postoperative
day #1, these were beginning to demarcate at the mid thigh.
At this time, he was intubated in the intensive care unit. He
was taken back to the operating room for bilateral femoral
embolectomies because of progressive ischemia of his
bilateral lower extremities. This happened on [**7-4**].
Postoperatively, however, he had persistent ischemia of both
lower extremities. By [**7-5**], he was respirator-dependent
with rising creatinine kinase. His extremities were
completely demarcated at the mid thigh and given his degree
of progressive renal failure/anuria, hypotension requiring
pressors, respiratory failure requiring ventilator support
and peripheral vascular disease with ischemia of both lower
extremities that was going to require bilateral lower
extremity amputations, his family deemed that they did not
want to pursue any further aggressive treatment options and
the patient was made comfort measures only. The patient
expired on [**7-5**] at 6:50 p.m.
