3 days. Pt reports diffuse generalized weakness, gradually
worsening, similar to her symptoms when she has acute infection.
Weakness associated with subjective fevers and chills, diffuse
abdominal pain for 1 day, foul-smelling urine, increased
confusion from baseline dementia. [**First Name3 (LF) 4273**] headache or change in
vision, no neck pain, no chest pain shortness of breath or

In the ED inital vitals were, 100.7 120 74/54 16 95% 3L Nasal
Cannula. On exam, pt has AMS.
Labs: lactate 2.4->3.3, UA with some protein, trop 0.04, Cr 1.2,
AP 198, Alb 2.5, WBC 30, HCT 25.7, PLT 246, 48 N, 4 blasts in
blood, INR 1.8, PTT 40
Bedside ECHO: no pericard effusion, complete IVC collapse,
hyperdynamic heart with good squeeze
CT abd neg for abd process. Unkown source of sepsis, likely LLL
pna as seen in CXR. Given zosyn for broad coverage.
Pt had SBP in 70-80s, HR 117 despite 2L IVF; discussed at length
the risks/benefits of central line with the family vs periph
pressors. HCP (daughter) would like peripheral pressors. Will
discuss central line as course evolves. Pt is DNR/DNI.

.
On arrival to the ICU,  family is at bedside. Had extended
coversation with family about patients wishes, goals of care,
etc... Daughter expressed that per her mother's will, she would
like to be made comfort, no interventions, no lines, no tubes,
no machines. They request patient be made [**First Name3 (LF) 3225**], they are okay
giving antibiotics and fluids at this time if it means she might
live long enough to go home tomorrow with hospice. Otherwise,
they request patient be made comfortable. They do not want a
central line placed. They request morphine if any discomfort,
they are aware that it might decreased her resp rate and hasten
her passing.

[**2193-3-18**] CT HEAD
There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, edema, shift of
normally midline structures, hydrocephalus, or acute large
vascular
territorial infarction. Periventricular and subcortical white
matter
hypodensities are consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic
disease.
Prominence of the ventricles and sulci is consistent with
age-related
involutional change. Bilateral cavernous carotid artery
calcifications are
noted. There is an old small left cerebellar hemisphere lacune
(3:7). The
visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air
cells are well
aerated. The imaged osseous structures are intact.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

[**2193-3-18**] CT HEAD
1. No acute intra-abdominal or pelvic process.
2. Splenomegaly, new compared to CT from [**2181-7-25**].
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions with evidence of mild
interstitial
pulmonary edema.
4. Large hiatal hernia.
5. Distended gallbladder with trace pericholecystic fluid that
is likely
secondary to hepatic ascites.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was an 86 year old female with a h/o AML/MDS and
symptomatic anemia, on decitabine (cycle 1) who presents with
septic shock with likely pulmonary source. Pt made [**Last Name (LF) 3225**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
family and patient wishes.

Initially admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU for septic shock. The
patient's family were present on admission and they noted that
she had a living will stating her wishes to be DNR/DNI and to
avoid invasive procedures. The family elected to avoid the
insertion of a central line and thus stop pressors. The levophed
was stopped and her blood pressure decreased to SBP 50s-60s.
Fluids and antibiotics were continued in a hope that her
infection could be treated to possibly go home. The following
day, her pressures had improved to SBP 80s-90s. Blood cultures
showed gram positive cocci in clusters. On further discussion
with the family, they opted to stop antibiotics entirely.
Patient was made [**Hospital Ward Name 3225**] and was called out to the floor on [**2193-3-19**].
The patient passed away on [**2193-3-22**]. Family declined autopsy.
