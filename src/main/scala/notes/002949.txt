Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain, dark stools

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endoscopy


History of Present Illness:
78 yo female with significant history of coronary artery disease
s/p CABG, ischemic cardiomyopathy s/p BiV-ICD placement and
ventricular tachycardia who presents with acute onset of likely
GI bleed and left-sided chest pain. The pain was located under
her left breast radiating to her back that awoke her from sleep
around 3 AM on the day of admission, [**8-7**] in severity. She
reports taking a few nitroglycerin tablets with some relief in
her pain. The pain was reported as being constant in nature as
achey in character. She also reports that she had significant
dyspnea on exertion this morning, upon walking to the bathroom,
which is not typical for her, no shortness of breath at rest. At
baseline, she can walk less than a city block without stopping
for rest. She received nitroglycerin and aspirin prehospital.
She reports no fever or chills, no cough. On further questioning
the patient does report having some dark stool intermittently
for the last month or so.
.
In the ED, initial VS were pain [**4-7**], T 97.2, P 64, BP 163/64, R
16, Sat 97%. On physical exam, patient had guaiac positive black
stool. ECG reportedly showed paced rhythm, with LAD, RBBB, new
ST depressions in V3 and V5, as well as new TWF in V3. Labs were
significant for hematocrit of 25 from baseline 34. Troponin was
noted to 0.04, which is below her baseline. In addition,
potassium was elevated at 5.5, creatinine elevated at 1.8 from
baseline of 1.5, and INR was 1.3. Patient was administered
full-dose aspirin and started on a nitroglycerin gtt. GI was
consulted for GI bleed, and recommended protonix bolus and gtt,
transfusion of 2 units PRBCs and possible EGD on [**2-20**].
Transfusion has not started at the time of transfer. Chest X-ray
was performed and showed no acute cardiopulmonary process.
Patient was chest pain free at the time of transfer. Peripheral
line and EJ line was placed in ED.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, syncope or
presyncope.

ENDOSCOPY [**2133-2-23**]:
Impression: Irregular z-line.
Abnormal mucosa in the esophagus (biopsy)
Slightly thickened gastric folds.
Polyp in the first part of the duodenum (biopsy)
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

Recommendations: Follow-up biopsy results. If duodenal polyp is
adenomatous, may need repeat endoscopy.
The findings do not account for the symptoms


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 78 year old woman with significant history of
coronary artery disease s/p CABG, ischemic cardiomyopathy s/p
BiV-ICD placement and ventricular tachycardia who presented with
acute onset of likely GI bleed with resultant
exertionalleft-sided chest pain. She underwent an endoscopy
which didnt show any active signs of bleeding and was dc/ed to
[**Hospital 100**] Rehab d/t orthostatic hypotension.
.
# Gastrointestinal bleed: Ms. [**Known lastname **] experienced a hematocrit drop
from baseline of 34 to 24 in setting of guaiac positive dark
