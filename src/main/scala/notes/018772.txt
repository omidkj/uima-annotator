[**2139-11-5**] - Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
I recently had the pleasure of seeing your patient, [**Known firstname 56584**]
[**Known lastname **] in consultation.  As you recall, he is a 83- year-old
gentleman with a history of aortic stenosis and now dizzy spells
for the past three months.  Recent EKG was performed which
showed some inferior Q waves and a follow up echocardiogram was
also performed which showed that his aortic stenosis has had now
become severe.  His aortic valve area previously was 0.8 cm2 and
now is 0.5 cm2.  Given these findings, he has now been referred
for surgical evaluation. Independent review of his cardiac
echocardiogram from [**2139-9-30**] again showed severe aortic
stenosis with an aortic valve area of 0.5 cm2.  His mean
gradient is 52 mmHg and he has mild mitral regurgitation, trace
tricuspid regurgitation, left atrial enlargement, an ejection
fraction of 65%, concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, and a
trileaflet aortic valve.  He also had a Holter monitor placed
and review of the data shows sinus rhythm with occasional PACs
and PVCs.  There are two episodes of supraventricular
tachycardia but no significant ventricular tachycardia or
ventricular fibrillation.


Past Medical History:
Past medical history is notable for hyperlipidemia, benign
prostatic hypertrophy, prior inferior wall MI based on Q waves
on his EKG, hepatitis A, memory loss, and sleep apnea.


Social History:
Currently, he is retired.  He quit smoking 20 years ago after a
45-pack-year history.  He drinks one to two glasses of wine per
day.  He lives with his wife and his last dental examination was
a year ago.


Family History:
His family history is relatively unremarkable, however, there is
a sister who had congestive heart failure in her 70s.

Physical Exam:
On physical examination, his pulse is 74 and regular.
Respirations are 12.  His blood pressure on his right is 136/78
and on his left is 130/76.  He is 6'1" tall and weighs 190 lbs.
In general, he is a well-developed and well-nourished elderly
gentleman in no acute distress.  Skin is warm and dry without
clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  HEENT examination shows him to be
normocephalic and atraumatic.  His pupils are equal, round,
reactive to light.  Sclerae is anicteric.  His oropharynx is
benign and he does have upper and lower dentures, however, has
few upper and lower gold capped teeth that remain.  His neck is
supple with full range of motion and no JVD.  His lungs are
clear are clear to auscultation.  Heart shows a regular rate and
rhythm with normal S1 and S2.  There is a III/VI systolic
ejection murmur without rub or gallop.  His abdomen is soft,
nondistended, and nontender with normoactive bowel sounds and
there is no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities are warm and well
perfused without edema.  He does have a small right thigh
superficial varicosity but overall his bilateral greater
saphenous vein appears suitable if needed.  Pulse are 2+
throughout.  Neurologically, he is alert and oriented x3.  There
are no focal deficits.  He moves all of his extremities.  Gait
is steady and there is some notable short-term memory loss on
physical examination.  There is a transmitted murmur versus
bruit over his bilateral carotid arteries.


Pertinent Results:
[**2139-11-5**] Cardiac Cath
1. Coronary angiography in this left dominant system revealed no

angiographically apparent coronary artery disease of the LMCA,
LAD, LCx
or RCA.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
arterial
pressure with SBP of 120 mmHg and DBP of 71 mmHg.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.

[**2139-11-6**] ECHO
PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is markedly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. No thrombus is seen in the left atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
2. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Transmitral Doppler and
tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade II (moderate)
LV diastolic dysfunction.
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. The NCC is immobile.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.

POST-CPB: On infusion of phenylephrine. AV pacing. Well-seated
bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position. Trivial AI and
trivial paravalvular leak prior to protamine administration.
Peak gradient now 28 mmHg. Preserved biventricular systolic
function. MR remains mild. Aortic contour is normal post
decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
83 year old white male underwent aortic valve replacement (23mm
St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] tissue), and coronary artery bypass grafting x 1
(LIMA->LAD) on [**2139-11-6**].  Cardiopulmonary bypass time waws 79
minutes, cross-clamp time was 62 minutes For further details,
please see operative report.  Overall the patient tolerated the
procedure well and post-operatively was transfered to the CVICU
for further observation and recovery.  Within twenty-four hours,
the patient was extubated and all drips had been weaned.  On POD
1 the patient was alert and oriented (with baseline short-term
memory loss), breathing comfortably and off all inotropic and
vasopressor support.  He was found suitable for transfer to the
telemetry floor at this time.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were
discontinued without complication.  The patient was diuresed
toward his preoperative weight.  The physical therapy service
was consulted for assistance with strength and balance.  The
patient went into atrial fibrillation post-operatively.
Amiodarone was started, and beta blocker was titrated up
accordingly.  He was still in atrial fibrillation on discharge,
however, rate was well controlled.  The patient developed a
fever on POD 3 and cultures were sent.  Urinalysis was positive,
and patient was started on bactrim empirically.  Hospital course
was essentially uneventful and the patient was discharged to
rehab on POD 5.
