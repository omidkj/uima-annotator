Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
63 [**Female First Name (un) **]-old male with history of schizoaffective disorder and no
known medical history who was admitted to psychiatory with
psychotic episode, question of mania.  He was transferred to
MICU with hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure.
.
Per psychiatry records the patient was brought to
[**Hospital3 1196**] by the police for "false psychiatric
issues."  He was angry at NWH and requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
On presentation, he reportedly expressed manic behaviors, had
not slept for 4 days, and denied suicidal and homicidal
ideation.  His vitals on initial presentation were (T 98.4  HR
80  BP  146/70  RR 16  98%RA).  He was noted to have an elevated
WBC 15.5, and his UA and tox screen were negative.  He received
1mg Klonopin in the ED.  He was then admitted to inpatient
psychiatry where he received 10mg Zyprexa and 1mg Klonopin for
sleeplessness and agitation.  Per report, he denied chest pain
and shortness of breath at the time.  He then became somnolent,
desaturated to 87%RA, and was transferred to the medical
service.
.
Initial vitals on tranfer to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 3 were T92.4ax HR 85 BP 151/74
 RR 16  93%4Lnc.  He desaturated to 78% and was placed on
nonrebreather; ABG 7.10/98/192.  He continued to be somnolent,
arousable to voice and pain but not responding to questions or
commands.  The pt was given Lasix 40 mg IV.  He was placed
temporarily on BiPap, and then intubated when he remained
unarousable, pulling low tidal volumes. The pts initial CXR was
more c/w pulmonary edema, but subsequent chest films are more
c/w bilateral aspiration pneumonia (most notably on AP CXR from
[**8-17**]).  The pt was started on azithromycin, ceftriaxone and
flagyl on [**8-17**] for this presumed asp pneumonia in the setting of
a WBC up to 16.3 on [**8-16**].  The pt was extubated on [**8-17**] and has
been satting well on both face tent at times and 3 L NC.  Pt was
started on hydrazalzine after SBP has been up to 180-200 s/p
extubation.  Per nurses, pt has autodiuresed over 3 liters since
his MICU transfer.
.
History was difficult to obtain from the pt due to his sleepy
state.  The pt indicates he is not in any pain and is not having
any SOB or cough at this time.

Brief Hospital Course:
63 year-old male with history of schizoaffective disorder who
was admitted to the psychiatry service and was transferred to
the MICU for hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure.  Pt
then transferred to medicine service for further management.
.
1)  Respiratory failure:  While on the psychiatry service, he
was acutely agitated and then experienced acute shortness of
breath.  At the time, his blood pressure was elevated.  He
likely experienced flash pulmonary edema.  His poor ventilation
and oxygenation was likely contributed to by some degree of
presumed OSA given his body habitus.  It is unclear whether or
not the medications (olanzapine and clonazepam) that he was
given contributed to his somnolence.  He was intubated given his
poor oxygenation and ventilation and was given a dose of
furosemide.  On hospital day 2, he had evidence of questionable
aspiration pneumonia on his chest x-ray.  It is possible that he
aspirated during the episode of somnolence.  It is also possible
that he had a community acquired pneumonia that was not evident
on earlier x-rays.  He was started on azithromycin, ceftriaxone,
and metronidazole.  An echocardiogram was performed to evaluate
for heart failure.  He had a hyperdynamic EF > 75%.  There was
evidence of mild LV hypertrophy with impaired relaxation.  He
was extubated on hospital day 3.  The pt was tranferred to
medicine on 3 L NC.  He was continued on broad spectrum
antibiotics for a total duration of 10 days (ceftriaxone IV was
changed to cefpodoxime po), and the pt was given A/A nebs.  The
pt was given 40 mg IV Lasix prior to intubation in the MICU and
received intermittent po Lasix (20-60mg po qd) during the last 3
days of his stay on the medicine floor.  AP CXR [**8-18**] revealed
improving pulmonary edema and no comment on infiltrate. CXR from
[**8-24**] was negative for interval change in LLL or bibasilar
atelectasis.  Prior to discharge the pt was satting at 98%RA
sitting and 92-94% RA walking.  Consideration may be given to
evaluating this pt for CPAP as an outpt if pt is willing to be
compliant.
.
2) Fever/leukocytosis: The likely source of his fever and
leukocytosis is pneumonia.  Once he was treated with
antibiotics, he remained afebrile.  Blood, urine, and sputum
cultures were all negative.  WBC rose to 16 on [**8-22**] but CXR was
negative for change in infiltrate, UA negative for signs of
infection, and no localizing symptoms were found.  The pt
remained afebrile at discharge.
.
3) Hypertension: He denies any history of hypertension.  He was
initially treated with hydralazine.  His blood pressures
remained under good control while he was sedated.  Once he was
extubated, is blood pressures were sometimes elevated to 200
systolic.  The pt was started on hydralazine 10 mg po q 6hr.
The pts SBP continued to be as high as 200, so the pt was also
started on metoprolol and lisinopril which were titrated up to
metoprolol 50 mg po TID and lisinopril 10 mg qd.
.
4) Psych:  Patient was initially sedated.  Once he was
extubated, he required IV Haldol and IV Ativan for agitation.
He was followed by psychiatry. The pt was continued on standing
Haldol and Ativan as well as prn haldol and ativan.  The haldol
was initially given IV, however the pt continued to pull out his
IVs so it was then given IM.  Per psychiatry recommendations,
the pt was started on Lithium [**Hospital1 **].  The pt frequently required
the prn haldol and ativan IM doses, and always had a 1:1 sitter.
 He also required 4 point leather restraints on the first 3
nights after transfer, with security being called nearly every
night for the pt attempting to leave the hospital.  The pt did
not require restraints the last 2 nights prior to discharge.  He
was much more alert and oriented prior to discharge than he had
been on days prior prior.  The pts IM Haldol/Ativan was switched
to po prior to discharge.
.
5.Lower extremity edema:  Likely secondary to some diastolic
dysfunction.  The pt had only mild bibasilar rales but did have
some pulmonary vascular congestion on CXR.  As p
