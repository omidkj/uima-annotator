History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male patient of Dr.[**Name (NI) 666**] with a
history of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], AF on coumadin, CHF (EF 50%),
critical AS (valve area 0.6) s/p valvuloplasty, CKD (baseline
2.4), dementia and failure to thrive who was discharged two days
ago ([**12-31**]) with a PICC on TPN after presenting with
hypernatremia who now presents with a GIB with a hematocrit down
to 18% from a baseline of ~27%. His family explains that they
first noticed dark red rectal bleeding yesterday. A hct at the
time was 19. He received 2 units of blood over night at his LTAC
but his HCT was still 19.4 this morning. He denies any pain and
according to his family is "acting like himself".
.
Per the ED's discussion with his family he is DNR/DNI and does
not want a central line or an NGT. They would like to give him
blood. Given his history of severe AS he is being admitted to
the ICU. In the ED he received a total of 300cc IVF. A first
unit of blood was started. Vital signs at the time of transfer
were 80s/40s, 78, 100/ra. He was AO to person only.
.
On arrival to the ICU he appeared comfortable. He was alert and
oriented to person and place. He denies any chest pain,
shortness of breath or abdominal pain. He has several family
members with him including 2 daughters and 1 [**Name2 (NI) 12496**]. They
believe the only thing that is bothering him right now is some
pain from a sacral ulcer.
.
Per family and review of records Mr. [**Known lastname 83312**] has been on a
steady decline first noticed last [**Holiday **] (when he slept
through the family [**Holiday **] party) and increasingly constant
over the past six months. Extensive involvement of palliative
team over goals of care, most recently [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2270**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1764**]) most
recently [**12-31**].
.
He has had prior GI workup for GI bleed with his most recent
scoped (both colonoscopy and EGD) in [**2113**]. These were notable
primarily for a small dulefoy lesion, diverticulosis, and
polyps.
.

Chest X-Ray:
Right PICC tip terminates in the lower SVC. Evaluation of the
cardiac silhouette size is difficult to assess given the
presence of bilateral moderate pleural effusions, right greater
than left, similar compared to the prior study. The heart size
though is likely enlarged. The aorta remains tortuous and
calcified. Bibasilar atelectasis persists. No pneumothorax is
present. IMPRESSION: Continued bilateral moderate pleural
effusions, right greater than left with bibasilar atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old gentleman with a history of severe AS, AF
recently on coumadin, CHF and dementia who is presenting with
severe anemia and hypotension in the setting of a GIB of unclear
etiology.

# Anemia/GIB: presented with an acute GI bleed, unclear if upper
or lower, has a history of prior upper GI lesion along with
diverticulosis.  He was treated with blood products, PRBC's and
FFP, GI was consulted and the plan was discussed at length with
his family along with his primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) 227**] his
multiple comorbidities and overall poor baseline health status
the decision was made not to pursue an endoscopic intervention.
The patient was re-started on IV PPI's because of his inability
to tolerate po medications and the families concerns that he was
symptomatic from reflux.  The patient was also transfused at the
end of his hospitalization without incident with lasix following
transfusion.  His discharge hemoglobin was 8.4, was transfused
at 7.6.

#  Hypernatremia
The patient had been previously admitted for hypernatremia.  The
patient is lethargic and fluctiations in sodium are likely
without any po intake.  1/2 NS was given to try and correct this
and was ineffective.  It was stopped due to concerns of too much
volume with his TPN and blood products.

# Coagulopathy
This is likely due to poor nutrition.  The patient was given
vitamin K and his INR corrected to 1.2 on discharge.  Vitamin K
can be given on an as needed basis.

#CRF Stage III
Baseline appears 1.7-1.9 was at 1.4 at discharge.  Was on
aranesp in past, unclear role at this time and not re-started.
[**Month (only) 116**] limit transfusion requirement in future.
