HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74 year old
male with a history of coronary artery disease status post
coronary artery bypass graft with ischemic cardiomyopathy
with ejection fraction of 10 to 15%, diabetes mellitus and
peripheral vascular disease, transferred to the Cardiac Care
Unit for Swan-Ganz placement and hemodynamic monitoring on
[**2119-4-27**].  The patient was initially admitted to the
hospital on [**2119-4-9**] as a transfer from an outside hospital
for evaluation of left foot ulcer as well as decompensated
congestive heart failure.  While at the outside hospital, the
patient's Lasix and ACE inhibitor had been held and the
patient subsequently experienced an approximately 10 kilogram
weight gain over that time.

On admission to [**Hospital1 69**], the
patient was initially diuresed with some success.  He was
restarted on Coreg.  Use of his ACE inhibitor was limited
secondary to low blood pressure.  The patient was
subsequently started on a Milrinone drip on [**2119-4-14**].

On [**4-14**], the patient had an episode of sustained ventricular
tachycardia which was terminated by deployment of AICD.  The
patient has had multiple episodes of non-sustained
ventricular tachycardia since that time and has been followed
by the Electrophysiology Service.  Milrinone was temporarily
discontinued for his ventricular tachycardia.  His digoxin
was discontinued and his electrolytes were aggressively
repleted.

On [**2119-4-27**], the patient was transferred to the Cardiac
Care Unit for more aggressive hemodynamic monitoring with a
Swan-Ganz catheter as well as continuation of the Milrinone
drip.  While in the Cardiac Care Unit, the patient was noted
to have depressed cardiac index and a low to normal SVR as
well as elevated biventricular filling pressures suggesting
decompensated congestive heart failure of cardiogenic origin.
The patient subsequently had his dose of Milrinone titrated
up.  The ability to increase the Milrinone was limited by
hypotension as well as ventricular arrhythmias.

The patient was initially started on p.o. Amiodarone for
control of his arrhythmias and to prevent firing of the AICD.
He ultimately required loading with intravenous Amiodarone
which better controlled his ectopy.

On [**2119-5-1**], the patient had repeat deployment of his AICD
resulting in briefly a hypotension and unresponsiveness.  The
patient subsequently recovered hemodynamically although his
mental status remained slightly altered.  Following that
deployment, the patient was started on intravenous as opposed
to p.o. Amiodarone as noted above.

Over the next several days, the patient became progressively
more hypotensive despite withdrawal of his Carvedilol,
limiting of his diuresis and decreased dose of his Milrinone.
 He also had progressive oliguric renal failure, suggesting
poor renal perfusion.  By the time of his death, the patient
was not responding to p.r.n. diuresis.  He was noted to
become increasingly dyspneic, with worsening congestive heart
failure.

Several family meetings were held over the course of the
final week of his life to discuss code status and withdrawal
of care and emphasis on comfort.  The patient, while he
anticipated his death, encouraged continuation of current
measures.

Following repeat family meeting on [**2119-5-4**], and repeat
discussion with the patient, Milrinone was discontinued for
hypotension.  The patient was continued on his other cardiac
medications.

On the morning of [**2119-5-5**], the patient was noted to be
apneic and asystolic.  He was declared deceased at
approximately 09:00 a.m.  An autopsy was not requested by the
family.
