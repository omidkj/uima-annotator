Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
This is a 51 yo male with PMH of Hep B/C and EtOH abuse induced
cirrhosis transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH for hepatic transplant
work up and implantable defibrillator evaluation.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis
Central Venous Access

History of Present Illness:
This is a 51 yo male with PMH of Hep B/C and EtOH abuse induced
cirrhosis transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH for hepatic transplant
work up and implantable defibrillator evaluation.
.
Initially, the patient was admitted to the OSH s/p fall x 2 with
loss of consciousness and bladder function following an episode
of chest pain and dizziness. After the second fall, he was found
by his son and brought to the hospital. In the ED, he was found
to be dyspneic and hypoxic and a CXR showed a right sided
pleural effusion.
.
He underwent a 1.4L thoracentesis on [**10-8**] which was consistent
with a transudate with a diff showing 12 polys, 41 lymphs, 21
eos and 41 monos, total protein of 1.9 and LDH 76. Cultures were
negative. Following the procedure, his sats improved.
.
His hospitalization was complicated by an episode of TdP on [**10-8**]
attributed to hypomagnesemia and prolonged QT, which required
CPR and 2 shocks, amiodarone loading/drip and magnesium bolus.
Although he did rule out for MI by CE, repeat surface echo
indicated a hyperdynamic LVEF from 59 to 84%. Additionally, the
patient had blood cultures + for GPC's and was started on
vancomycin.
.
On transfer, the patient is stable and complains of pain over
his chest in the location of rib fractures secondary to CPR. He
denies n/v/d, abd pain, chest pressure, palpitations, and
although he feels mildly dyspneic, he notes that he feels much
improved.

Brief Hospital Course:
51 yo M with MMP including viral and alcoholic cirrhosis
transferred s/p thoracentesis for hydrothorax complicated by
decompensated TdP requiring CPR/shock resuscitation.
.
Viral/EtOH Cirrhosis and ARDS: Gastroenterologist at OSH (Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 55386**]) evaluated the patient and felt that he may be a
candidate for liver transplant. There was no evidence of ascites
on CT or US, but patient's presentation was consistent with
hepatic encephalopathy. Hepatology was on board throughout the
patient's course in the MICU, but did not feel that he was a
candidate for liver transplant secondary to his septic picture.
The patient continued to decompensate, requiring intubation for
hypoxic respiratory failure and pressors for what was believed
to be possible ARDS/sepsis and ended up going into fulminant
hepatic failure, despite maximum supportive measures and
antibiotics. His coagulopathy was unable to be controlled even
with receiving maximum blood products and support with pressors.
His family decided to withdraw blood products and the patient
passed away on [**2111-10-23**].
