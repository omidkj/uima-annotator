Service:  [**Hospital1 212**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 79-year-old woman is
admitted for respiratory distress, hyponatremia and
hyperkalemia.  This woman has had a complicated medical
course over the past six months which has included several
episodes of respiratory failure, difficulty to wean off a
ventilator, tracheostomy placement complicated by tracheal
tear (requiring open sternotomy), anasarca, atrial
fibrillation, E.coli sepsis, pseudomonas urinary tract
infection, VRE intraabdominal abscess and Clostridium
difficile colitis.  Her ventilatory difficulties were thought
to be perhaps secondary to a myopathic process, although
muscle biopsy results were inconclusive and not demonstrative
of inflammatory changes.

Patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] [**10-28**]
through [**2183-12-18**] and successfully weaned from the
ventilator there.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 5595**] [**2183-12-18**] where she was gradually reintroduced to p.o. feed and
weaned from PEG feeds.  She currently tolerates a pureed
diet.  Her atrial fibrillation has been managed via rate
control as the Amiodarone she was previous on was felt to
possibly contribute to her myopathy.  She had been on Lasix
(40 mg b.i.d.) on transfer from [**Hospital1 **] and
nonetheless gained 12 pounds from [**12-28**] through
[**1-15**].  Lasix was decreased to 20 mg q. day on [**1-12**] because her sodium was noted to be 129.

On [**1-15**], the patient was noted to have increased
dyspnea and tachypnea.  She states she has had intermittent
dry cough for several days.  No subjective fevers or chills.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**]
today with still more dyspnea / tachypnea, sodium of 126 and
a potassium of 6.2.

[**Hospital1 5595**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission temperature 97.4 F, heart
rate 96, blood pressure 143/68, respirations 20 and oxygen
saturation 88% on room air.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat:  Pupils 2 mm, light reactive.  Sclerae anicteric.
Oropharynx dry.  Lungs:  Bilateral end expiratory wheezes.

positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  2 cm bilateral pitting
edema to mid thigh bilaterally.  Skin:  Reticular
erythematous blanching and rash bilaterally upper extremities
and trunk.  Neuro:  Alert and appropriately interactive.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White count 9.7, hematocrit
34.0, platelets 319.  INR 3.3, PTT 41.1.  Sodium 125,
potassium 6.4, chloride 84, total CO2 31, BUN 25, creatinine
0.6, glucose 119.

Arterial blood gas:  7.38 / 58 / 91.

Chest x-ray:  Dense left retrocardiac opacity, small
bilateral pleural effusions.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was admitted for
treatment of pneumonia.  This was felt to be the main
etiology of her respiratory distress.  She had a Levofloxacin
allergy on my medical record, but per patient and daughter,
she did not have an allergy.  She was placed on Levofloxacin
500 mg p.o. q. day for a 10 day course.  Her respiratory
status subsequently improved and returned to her baseline
level of saturating in the 90s on zero to two liters of
oxygen per nasal cannula.  She was monitored for additional
rash and no rash appeared.  Her previous rash symptomatically
improved throughout admission.

The patient had evidence of a urinary tract infection on
urinalysis.  A culture was performed which was contaminated.
Additional culture and sensitivities are recommended if the
patient has continued symptoms despite her course of
Levofloxacin.

2.  ELECTROLYTES:  Aforementioned, the patient had
hyponatremia and hyperkalemia on admission.  She was noted to
be extravascularly volume overloaded and intravascularly
depleted by physical examination.  Potential etiologies of
this were felt to include diastolic cardiac dysfunction and
malnutrition with hypoalbuminemia.  The patient received one
liter of normal saline at a slow rate.  Thereafter, she was
fluid restricted.  Her sodium improved to a level of 129 on
the day prior to discharge.  The patient's potassium likewise
improved to a level under 5.  A cosyntropin stimulation test
was performed to rule out adrenal insufficiency.  The test
was negative.

3.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Aforementioned, the patient was noted to
be in atrial fibrillation and possibly with diastolic
dysfunction.  Her Metoprolol was increased to 37.5 mg p.o.
B.i.d. for improved rate control.  Her Captopril was also
increased to 37.5 mg p.o. t.i.d.  She was continued on
Digoxin as her son noted that the patient diuresis well in
response to this drug.  She remained in atrial fibrillation
with good rate control throughout admission.

4.  NUTRITION:  The patient has a recent history of
malnutrition.  A nutrition consult was obtained for tube feed
recommendations as the patient has had decreased p.o. intake
of late.  She received nocturnal tube feedings with
encouraged p.o. intake throughout the day.  It is recommended
that her nutritional status be closely monitored at [**Hospital1 5595**] as
this contributes to her general well-being.

5.  ENDOCRINE:  Patient has noted history of hypothyroidism.
TSH was pending at time of this dictation.  She was continued
on her outpatient dose of Synthroid throughout admission.

6.  PROPHYLAXIS:  The patient was continued on Coumadin at
admission for her atrial fibrillation.  She had an elevated
INR on day #1 of admission and her Coumadin was held.  It is
recommended that her INR be monitored in an outpatient
setting with adjustments made to maintain an INR between 2
and 3.

7.  PSYCH:  Patient has apparent depression with depressed
mood and neurovegetative symptoms.  She was continued on
Wellbutrin SR this admission.  It is recommended that she
have a trial of Ritalin once she returns to [**Hospital1 5595**] for
activation and appetite stimulation.

1.  Pneumonia.
2.  Atrial fibrillation.
3.  Diastolic dysfunction.
4.  Depression.
5.  Malnutrition.
6.  Hypothyroidism.
7.  Retrosternal goiter.
8.  History of respiratory failure and multiple difficult
