History of Present Illness:
76 yo M w/ St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**] AVR, Afib, CHB pacer dependent, prostate
CA on lupron/ketaconazole/hydrocortisone presents from home
after acutely developed chills and vomiting this morning. After
the vomiting episode, his family reported worsening mental
status and he was taken to an OSH ED. There he was found to be
hypotensive, febrile 102, WBC 12, got trace fluids 250cc. A CT
head and CT ab/pelvis were unremarkable, UA negative, CXR was
concerning for bilaterally pulmonary infiltrates. There they
administered avelox 400mg IV, CTX 1gm IV, and vanco 1gm x1 and
he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED. On arrival, he was hypotensive
initially improved with IVF 2L, and was started on dopamine. A
CVL was placed in the right IJ and he was intubated for
respiratory failure on lying flat. Labs in the ED were notable
for WBC 14. INR 4.4. Cr 1.7 and Lactate 2.7. Blood and urine
cultures were sent. Prior to transfer, VS HR 73 BP 97/46 RR 16
100% AC 550/16/5/100%, and he was on fentanyl, versed bolus for
sedation.

On the floor, he was intubated and sedated. Family was at
bedside to confirm details as above. There have been no sick
contacts and patient has not been out of the house for the past
5 days.

CXR AP [**2130-2-17**]:
1. Appropriate positions of endotracheal tube and right IJ line
with no
pneumothorax.
2. New retrocardiac airspace opacity which may represent focal
pulmonary
edema or atelectasis, though aspiration cannot be excluded.
3. Stable cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary vascular congestion.

ECHO [**2130-2-20**]:
The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality,
a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Diastolic function could not be assessed. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta is moderately dilated. An aortic valve prosthesis is
present. The transaortic gradient is higher than expected for
this type of prosthesis. No masses or vegetations are seen on
the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal
image quality. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. There is mild valvular
mitral stenosis (area 1.5-2.0cm2). Trivial mitral regurgitation
is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body
habitus. Left ventricular function is probably normal, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right
ventricle is not well seen. There is an aortic prosthesis -
which appears most likely a bioprosthesis. The gradient is
higher than expected for this kind of prosthesis.
