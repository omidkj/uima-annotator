HD line removal

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 69F with MMP including chronic ventilator
dependence s/p trachostomy [**4-/2139**], highly resistant pseudomonal
PNA's, COPD on home oxygen, obstructive sleep apnea, diastolic
HF, and Type II diabetes mellitus. She presented to the ED today
after she was found to be hypotensive and febrile to 102.4 at
[**Hospital1 **]. Per the patient's family, she had been doing well at
[**Hospital1 **] with the exception of a PICC line infection 1-2 weeks
ago, off of the vent, and able to communicate with her family
members. Last night her son noted her to have altered mental
status, with altered speech. This morning, she developed fevers,
abdominal pain and hypotension. She was brought to the ED.
.
In the ED her vital signs were BP=76/54, HR=106, and she was
afebrile.
She was found to have a leukocytosis, with a WBC count of 12.9
(no left shift); a metabolic gap acidosis with a lactate of 7.9;
and an elevated Cr to 3.4 (baseline 1.5). A CXR was clear, and
blood cultures were sent. She had no [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] no UA or cultures
were sent. She was given 4L of normal saline, 1g of vancomycin,
1g of cefepime, and levophed, and her MAPs improved from 50's to
>65. A femoral line, right IJ, and arterial line were placed.
She was guaiac negative. Surgery was called to evaluate the
patient's distended abdomen. They felt that their was low
suspicion for ischemic bowel and preferred to monitor serial
abdominal exams and lactates, with low threshold to get an
abdominal CT if her exam changes.

[**7-13**] RUE US - RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale,
color, and pulse wave Doppler were performed to evaluate the
deep venous system of the right upper extremity. A PICC line is
identified in the right brachial, axillary, and subclavian
veins. The internal jugular vein, subclavian vein, axillary
vein, brachial vein, and cephalic vein all demonstrate normal
compressibility and normal respiratory phasicity. Color imaging
demonstrates normal, wall-to-wall flow.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the right upper extremity.
.
CXR [**7-12**] FINDINGS: Right PICC line and tracheostomy tube remain
in place. Right lower lobe density has resolved. Some left
basilar atelectasis is demonstrated and the pulmonary vascular
markings are within normal limits. A 1.1 cm nodular opacity
projects over right posterior rib interspace 5, 6 and is less
conspicuous than on the most recent prior chest x-ray. No
definite correlate was visualized on a recent CT from [**2139-5-16**].
Recommend continued reassessment with followup films
.
[**7-1**] CT HEAD CT HEAD: The study is mildly limited due to patient
motion artifact. There is no evidence of acute intracranial
hemorrhage, edema, mass, shift of the normally midline
structures, loss of the basal cisterns, hydrocephalus, or acute
large vascular territory infarction. Bifrontal prominence of the
extra- axial CSF spaces is unchanged. Multiple punctate
calcifications along the left cerebral sulci are unchanged and
again may be vascular in etiology. Dense calcifications along
the dura lateral to the right cavernous sinus is unchanged. No
fracture or region of bony destruction is seen within the
calvarium. Mucosal thickening and possible air-fluid level is
again noted in the sphenoid sinus. Otherwise, air-fluid levels
in the maxillary sinuses and ethmoid air cells have improved.
Partial opacification of the mastoid air cells is unchanged.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process. Interval
removal of endotracheal and nasogastric tubes with improved
aeration in the visualized paranasal sinuses; opacification of
the sphenoid sinus and mastoid air c
