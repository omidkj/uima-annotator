EKG [**5-30**]: Sinus tachycardia, Ant/septal and lateral ST-T changes
are nonspecific.  Since previous tracing of [**2120-5-26**], heart rate
is faster, and ectopic atrial rhythm not seen .
.
CT Abd/Pelvis [**5-30**]:
1.  Bilateral lower lobe consolidation, most consistent with
pneumonia or
aspiration.
2.  Left flank soft tissue stranding surrounding the left
external oblique
muscle with a sliver of fluid collection that has the appearance
of hematoma secondary to trauma in the appropriate clinical
setting, differential diagnosis includes cellulitis. Clinical
correlation is recommended.
3.  No evidence of small-bowel obstruction or ascites.
.
CXR [**6-1**]: Endotracheal tube has been withdrawn slightly now
terminating about 5 cm above the carina.  Central venous
catheter and nasogastric tube remain in place, with side port of
nasogastric tube remaining proximal to expected location of GE
junction.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  There
has been improvement in the degree of vascular engorgement.
Pulmonary edema has shifted in response to positional
differences of the patient, now more basilar in distribution.
Overall, degree of edema has slightly decreased.  Small pleural
effusions are more apparent on the current than on the prior
study, but may not have been readily detectable due to supine
positioning previously.
.
multiple CXR in between
CXR ([**2122-6-6**])
IMPRESSION:  Slight improved aeration at both lung bases
consistent with improving airspace disease.  Small right pleural
effusion.  Interval extubation and removal of the NG tube.
