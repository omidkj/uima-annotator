cxr-Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed with no prior
studies
available for comparison. There is right upper lobe atelectasis
with questionable right hilar mass that potentially may
represent Golden S sign suggesting central obstruction due to
mass. The right lower lobe and the left lung are unremarkable.
Minimal bibasilar atelectasis is present. Note is madethat the
costophrenic sulci were not included in the field of view
bilaterally. Thus a significant amount of pleural effusion
cannot be excluded. Cardiomediastinal silhouette otherwise is
unremarkable. A further evaluation with chest CT with contrast
is recommended. Findings were
discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3271**] over the phone by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at
the
time of dictation with the recommendation to proceed with chest
CT
.
CT chest-IMPRESSION:EXTENSIVE RIGHT UPPER LOBE CONSOLIDATION AS
WELL AS AREAS OF MULTIFOCAL OPACITIES IN THE SUPERIOR SEGMENT OF
THE RIGHT LOWER LOBE AND TO A LESSER EXTENT IN LEFT UPPER AND
LEFT LOWER LOBE. THE FINDINGS ARE CONCERNING FOR WIDESPREAD
INFECTION. GIVEN THE PRESENCe OF SOME DEGREE OF ATELECTASIS EVEN
IN THE ABSENCE OF DEMONSTRATION OF OBSTRUCTIVE AIRWAYS CENTRAL
OBSTRUCTING MASS WITH PARTIAL ATELECTASIS CAN NOT BE EXCLUDED.
EXTENSIVE LYMPHADENOPATHY IS PRESENT WHICH POTENTIALLY [**Month (only) **] BE
REACTIVE TO THE INFECTIOUS PROCESS. FOLLOW-UP OF THE PATIENT IN
2 TO 3 WEEKS WITH CHEST RADIOGRAPH WITH RECOMMENDATION OF
IMPROVEMENT OF THE ABOVE DESCRIBED FINDINGS IS RECOMMENDED. IF
PATIENT CLINICALLY IS IMPROVING AND THE CHEST RADIOGRAPHS SHOWS
IMPROVEMENT THEN EVALUATION WITH CHEST CT IN 3
MONTHS IS RECOMMENDED. OTHERWISE FURTHER EVALUATION WITH
BRONCHOSCOPY
WOULD BE CONSIDERED.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 57 year old woman with a history of GERD who
presented to [**Location (un) 620**]-ED with antecedent URI symptoms, taking
ibuprofen, found to be febrile, hypotensive, with multifocal
pneumonia and acute renal failure.  She was transferred to the
[**Hospital1 18**] [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU and was treated with aggressive volume
resuscitation (9-10 L) but averted intubation and pressor
support.  She was treated with Unasyn, Vanco and Levofloxacin
empirically.   She ruled out for influenza by DFA and her rapid
viral screen/culture was also negative.  Legionella antigen was
negative.  Her renal function rapidly improved.  She developed
atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (CHADS score
= 0).  A TTE showed normal function. She was treated with
diltiazem for rate control and converted to normal sinus rhythm.
 She was transferred out of the ICU on [**12-20**] where she has
continued to have fevers and feel generally unwell.  Unasyn was
discontinued.  Consideration of discontinuing Vancomycin was
made, but due to concerns re: her fever, it was stopped
transiently but resumed shortly therafter.     A CT of the chest
was ordered and showed no obvious changes from prior.  It did
show an incidentally noted enlarged right lobe of her thyroid
for which outpatient ultrasound is recommended.  She has not
been able to produce sputum, despite attempts with inducing it.
ID recommended Vanc/Levo and Ceftriaxone on [**12-24**].  She received 1
dose of ceftriaxone and developed a rash and lip swelling.  This
was discontinued.  She was been continued on the levoflox and
vancomycin.  On [**12-26**], given persistently negative cultures and
inability to produce sputum, Vanco was d/c'd in consultation
with Infectious disease.  She had mildly abnormal LFTs and a RUQ
ultrasound was obtained.  Preliminarily it showed no
abnormalities.   Towards the end of her hospitalization she was
noted to run low bps in the range of 80/50 at the lowest,
asymptomatic, but dltiazem was persistently being held and so
the decision was made to discharge her not on the diltiazem.
