without any difficulty or complication.

He was then transferred to the VICU for further recovery. While
in the VICU he recieved monitered care. When stable he was
delined. His diet was advanced. A PT consult was obtained. When
he was stabalized from the acute setting of post operative care,
he was transfered to floor status

On the floor, he remained hemodynamically stable with his pain
controlled. He progressed with physical therapy to improve her
strength and mobility. He continues to make steady progress
without any incidents. He was discharged home in stable
condition.
