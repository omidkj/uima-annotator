Chief Complaint:
Knee Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CVVH
Surgical washout of knee and wrist
Central Line Placement (HD line)

History of Present Illness:
72 year old male with h/o CAD s/p MI and CABG, CHF s/p ICD (3
years ago per wife), atrial fibrillation on coumadin, DM2, gout
who transfered from [**Location (un) **] with septic arthritis, UTI and
congestive heart failure.
.
On arrival patient was confused, history was obtained from wife
[**Name (NI) **] over telephone and from outside records. Per wife, patient
has had progressive right knee pain over the last week. He
usually ambulates with a walker, but it has been getting harder
to ambulate. Last week he saw his rheumatologist, who may have
performed a joint tap. His pain has gotten worse over the last
few days to the point he could not ambulate and had new right
wrist pain. + chills, no recorded fevers. Otherwise denies
CP/SOB, nausea/vomiting, dysuria.
.
At [**Location (un) **], he has x-rays of his right wrist and knee which
showed no fracture. RLE extremity U/S was negative for DVT. He
was given a dose of levaquin. R knee arthrocentesis was
performed, and showed [**Numeric Identifier **] WBC with 91% PMN and Gram stain was
positive for GPCs. Patient was started on vanc/gent and given
one dose of ceftriazone and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management. On transfer his vital signs were T 99.4, P 70, RR
22, 92% 2L O2
.
On floor, patient was confused and unable to provide a history.
He was diaphoretic, had a baseline tremor and in distress.

ECHO FROM [**2101-7-11**]
No thrombus/mass or spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the
body of the left atrium or right atrium. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened without regurgitation. No
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric jet of mild-moderate
([**12-4**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. No mass or vegetation is
seen on the mitral valve. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened with (1+) tricuspid regurgitation. No
vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve and no pulmonic
valve regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild mitral leaflet thickening without discrete
vegetation. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. No discrete
masses or vegetations identified on any of valves or visualized
RA/RV wires.

RUQ US [**2101-7-9**]
Two limited views of the abdomen. There is motion artifact. The
bowel gas
pattern is unremarkable. No free air is identified. There is no
evidence of
pneumobilia, although this would be difficult to assess on this
limited study.
Soft tissue shadows are indistinct. There are degenerative
changes in the
spine. There are multiple calcifications in the right upper
quadrant that
likely represent gallstones.

IMPRESSION: Right upper quadrant calcifications likely
representing
gallstones. Limited study.

ABDOMINAL US [**2101-7-8**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Nodular hepatic architecture, splenomegaly, and mild ascites
suggestive of
cirrhosis. No focal liver lesion identified.
2. Distended gallbladder with a stone in the neck and sludge.
The patient
could not be turned to assess mobility of the stone.
Consequently an impacted
stone and/or cholecystitis cannot be excluded. A HIDA scan could
be performed
if clinically indicated.

HIDA SCAN [**2101-7-9**]
INTERPRETATION: Serial images over the abdomen show poor uptake
of tracer into
the hepatic parenchyma with persistent blood pool throughout the
course of the
study. At 90 minutes, the gallbladder was not visualized so
continued delayed
imaging was performed with anterior and [**Doctor Last Name **] projections of the
abdomen obtained
at 3 and 1/2 hours demonstrating activity within the
gallbladder. Tracer
activity noted in the small bowel at 17 minutes.

The above findings are consistent with no evidence of
cholecystitis though with
severe hepatic dysfunction out of proportion to the current
level of elevated
bilirubin.

IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of cholecystitis with visualization
of the
gallbladder. 2. Worsening severe hepatic dysfunction out of
proportion to to the
current level of increased bilirubin.

RENAL US [**2101-7-7**]

FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 10.1 cm and the left kidney
measures 10.8
cm. There is no hydronephrosis in either kidney. No cysts or
stone or solid
mass seen bilaterally. No perinephric fluid collection is
identified.

IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis and no indication of a renal
abscess.

CT HEAD [**2101-7-5**]
FINDINGS: No prior studies are available for comparison. There
is no
evidence of acute hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or recent
infarction.
Prominence of the ventricles and sulci represents generalized
atrophy, age
related. Periventricular and subcortical white matter
hypodensity likely
represents sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
There are
calcifications of the bilateral carotid siphons. No concerning
osseous lesion
is seen. The visualized paranasal sinuses are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process.

BLE DOPPLERS [**2101-7-3**]
FINDINGS: Color Doppler and grayscale ultrasonography of the
bilateral lower
extremities demonstrates normal flow, compressibility, and
augmentation of the
bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal
veins. The
posterior tibial and peroneal veins are visualized bilaterally
and compress
normally.

IMPRESSION: No DVT.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Septic Shock: The patient developed a hypotensive picture from
an infectious source.  At first, this was thought to be [**1-4**] the
septic joints.  However, over time and after surgical washout of
the joints, the source was less certain.  We were concerned for
a possible biliary source, so a HIDA scan was done which was neg
for gallbladder disease.  SBP a concern given cirrhosis and
known ascites.  Dissemi
