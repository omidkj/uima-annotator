History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 54 yo male with a PMHx of HTN, DM2, mild mental
retardation, admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] yesterday after experiencing
GI symptoms (n/v/diarrhea and abd pain) and subjective fevers
for 1 day. While in the ED, prepping for an abdominal CT with
oral contrast, he vomited and aspirated contrast material. He
subsequently went into respiratory distress, requiring
intubation. Post-aspiration CTA of the chest revealed patchy
opacities in the RUL and lower lobes as well as bilateral
pleural effusions and no evidence of PE. CT abdomen was
unremarkable. He was started on levo/flagyl/vancand transferred
to the ICU. In the ICU, the patient's pressures dropped to 80's
SBP and the sepsis protocol was initiated. He was started on a
levophed drip and recieved IVF to maintain pressures.

An ECG done at that time revealed Q waves in the inferior leads
without ST-T changes, indicating a possible completed IMI.
Initial CE came back with a CK >[**2139**], MB >100 and trop >5.0. Pt
was started on ASA, Plavix, heparin gtt, high-dose atorvastatin,
and integrillin. The levophed gtt was switched to a dopamine gtt
with CVP goal between 15-20. At this time, the patient was
transferred to CCU.Currently, vitals stable, sedated and
intubated. AC 500 x 22 with PEEP of 10 and FiO2 65%.Echo done
[**7-20**] showed EF 20-25%, severe LV syst. dysfunction, no AS/AI,
trivial MR/TR, nl. PA systolic pressure. Cath done [**7-21**] revealed
100% LAD, 100% OM 1, RCA 100%, 2 [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 10157**] in CX. Referred for

FINAL REPORT


PORTABLE CHEST, [**2145-8-2**] AT 16:24

COMPARISON: [**2145-8-2**] at 13:16.

INDICATION: Feeding tube assessment.

A feeding tube tip is visualized in the distal stomach at the
level of the
gastroduodenal junction. A nasogastric tube has been removed.
There is
otherwise no change from the recent radiograph performed several
hours earlier
the same day.

Procedure Date:[**2145-8-2**]

FINAL REPORT


INDICATION: 54-year-old gentleman with mild mental retardation,
recent non-ST
elevation MI and refered for evaluation of aspiration.

TECHNIQUE: Video oropharyngeal swallow while patient is in
upright seated
position.

FINDINGS: Patient given mutliple consistencies of barium to
swallow and
evaluated by speech therapy with fluoroscopy. On oral phase, it
is noted that
patient has oral cavity residue with thin liquids. Patient is
also noted to
have premature spillover into the pharyngeal cavity with
evidence of
penetration. Patient has reduced laryngeal elevation and
insufficient
laryngeal valve closure. Furthermore, patient is noted to have
aspiration of
penetrated liquid. Video swallow was also done while patient in
a chin tuck
maneuver, though this was ineffective in preventing penetration
with thin
liquids.

IMPRESSION:
1. Aspiration of thin liquid.
2. Chin tuck maneuver not effective with thin liquids.
3. For more details, please see formal evaluation from speech
therapy.

THE STUDY AND THE REPORT WERE REVIEWED BY THE STAFF RADIOLOGIST.

Conclusions
PREBYPASS
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. There is severe
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed. Resting
regional wall motion abnormalities include severe hypokinesis of
the apex, mid to distal anterior, inferior, septal walls
(lateral wall functions best) .LVEF < 20%. Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic function is
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. MR increased to moderate (2+) with a
brief period of ischemia. There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

POSTBYPASS
The patient is receiving epinephrine at 0.05 ucg/kg/min.
There is improvement of the anterior and anteroseptal walls in
the setting of inotropes. LVEF~20-25%. RV systolic function
remains normal. MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 67764**]. The remaining study is unchanged

with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly, this is a 54 yo male with h/o mild mental retardation,
HTN, & DM, who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] w/ GI complaints and, during
evaluation of a possible GI illness, aspirated on CT contrast
material.  He subsequently developed respiratory failure and was
found to have an inferior MI, for which he was transferred to
the CCU.

.
#. CV:
   Shortly after admission, the pt was found to have an IMI;
however, based on the history, ECG & cardiac enzymes the timing
of the pt's MI was unclear, possibly having occured >12-24 hours
prior.  Thus, the patient was not re-vascularized at that time.
Medical management for his MI was provided with heparin gtt,
aspirin, plavix, and atorvastatin. (Of note, the atorvastatin
was later discontinued because of increasingly elevated LFTs
while on it). Plans for a diagnostic cardiac catheterization
were started.  However, because of deterioration in the
patie
