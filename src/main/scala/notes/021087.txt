Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 76-year-old male who
presented to [**Hospital6 33**] on [**12-31**] after
experiencing substernal chest pain at rest on the day prior
to admission.  Sublingual nitroglycerin had provided mild
relief, but the pain had recurred overnight.  The patient had
ST depressions on electrocardiogram, but he subsequently
ruled out for a myocardial infarction; although, he mildly
elevated troponins.

The patient continued to have episodes of chest pain while in
the hospital not associated with electrocardiogram changes.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] to undergo a cardiac catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (Past Medical History includes)
1.  Coronary artery disease; status post myocardial
infarction in [**2195-3-18**].
2.  End-stage renal disease (on hemodialysis on Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday).
3.  Peripheral vascular disease; status post aortobifemoral
bypass in [**2181**].
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
6.  Hypercholesterolemia.
7.  Status post left carotid endarterectomy.
8.  Congestive heart failure (with an ejection fraction of
35% to 40%).

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  (Medications at home included)
1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Metoprolol 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3.  Norvasc 10 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Imdur 120 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Zocor 60 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.
7.  Iron sulfate 325 mg p.o. b.i.d.
8.  Calcium carbonate 1250 mg p.o. t.i.d.
9.  Nephrocaps one tablet p.o. q.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The patient presented
to the hospital, and on admission he was afebrile, and vital
signs were stable.  Oxygen saturation was 94% on 3 liters
nasal cannula.  Lung examination revealed the patient was
clear to auscultation.  Heart examination had a regular rate
and rhythm.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent cardiac
catheterization which showed moderate diffuse disease with a
95% lesion of first diagonal.

Cardiac Surgery was consulted on hospital day two and planned
for a coronary artery bypass graft by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**].  The
patient underwent this procedure on [**1-15**]; coronary
artery bypass graft times one for unstable angina.

The patient was extubated on postoperative day one.  He had
hemodialysis as well on postoperative day one.

The patient underwent cardiac catheterization again on
postoperative day three which showed the left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending artery from the
coronary artery bypass graft to be patent.  The left anterior
descending artery had a 95% lesion at the bifurcation with
first diagonal as noted in the prior catheterization.

The patient underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty and stent of the left anterior descending artery,
first diagonal, with rescue left anterior descending artery.

The patient had an uncomplicated hospital course except
postoperative day six in the afternoon when the patient had a
6-beat ventricular tachycardia noted on the monitor.  The
patient was seen and examined.  He was in no acute distress,
and he was asymptomatic with no complaints of chest pain or
shortness of breath and was resting comfortably.  The patient
was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The patient was given
2 g of magnesium; of which only 1 g was infused before the
intravenous line was lost.  The patient was then subsequently
given 400 mg p.o. of magnesium oxide.

An electrocardiogram was checked, which showed no changes
when compared to the previous.  Electrolytes were checked in
order to make sure that any discrepancies were corrected.

Cardiology was consulted with regard to any further
intervention regarding the episode, and it was felt that he
did not merit an electrophysiology study.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  On postoperative day seven, the
patient was afebrile, vital signs were stable, tolerating a
regular diet, ambulating well, and with good oral pain
control and was felt to be ready for discharge to a
rehabilitation facility and was awaiting placement.  The
patient to be discharged to a rehabilitation facility.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  The patient was to follow
up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] in six weeks.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
 1.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
 2.  Calcium carbonate 1250 mg p.o. q.8h.
 3.  Nephrocaps one tablet p.o. q.d.
 4.  Simvastatin 60 mg p.o. q.d.
 5.  Milk of Magnesia 30 mL p.o. q.h.s. as needed (for
constipation).
 6.  Ibuprofen 400 mg p.o. q.4-6h. as needed.

facility (to be named at a later date).

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Status post coronary artery bypass
graft times one.
