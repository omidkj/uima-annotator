History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 84380**] is a 42 year old male with a history of
alcoholic cirrhosis who presents with somnolence and left leg
discomfort.  Patient was scheduled to re-establish care with Dr.
[**Name (NI) **] in the liver center today.  Upon arriving to the
clinic, there was concern about the patient's mental status and
his left leg infection.  The patient was instructed to go the ED
for evaluation.  In the ED, he was A and O x 3, but somnolent.
His initial VS were 97.5  BP 96/36, HR 59, 99% RA.  Given
concern for evolving sepsis, he received NS 2.5 liters.  LENI
was (-) for DVT in left leg.  RUQ was also obtained without
dopplers, and was equivocal, with possible non-occlusive portal
vein thrombosis.  Blood and urine cultures were obtained, and
the patient was given vancomycin.  He apparently had a reaction
to vanc, unclear if it was red man's syndrome, but received
Solumedrol 125 mg IV x 1 and benadryl 25 mg IV x 1.  He then
received clindamycin IV.  He was then transferred to the unit
for management of presumed sepsis in the setting of altered
mental status.
.
Upon arrival to the unit, the patient was somnolent but easily
arousable.  He endorsed abdmoninal pain, denied n/v/d.  He also
denied melena, BRBPR, or hematochezia.  He denied chest pain of
shortness of breath.  Remainder of ROS as noted below.  He does
state that the swelling in his legs is new over the past few
days.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denied cough, shortness of breath. Denied chest pain
or tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation.  No recent change in bowel or bladder habits. No
dysuria. Denied arthralgias or myalgias.

MICRO:
[**2169-7-7**] Blood cx: pending
[**2169-7-7**] Urine cx: no growth
[**2169-7-7**] Wound cx (left leg): S. aureus coag + rare growth
[**2169-7-7**] Periotoneal cx: no growth
.
IMAGING:
[**2169-7-7**] LLE Doppler US: No evidence of left lower extremity DVT
.
[**2169-7-7**] Portable CXR: There is interval development of left
retrocardiac opacity that is worrisome for interval development
of infectious process. Lung volumes remain low, but the lungs
are otherwise clear. There is no appreciable pleural effusion.
There is no pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
stable.
.
[**2169-7-7**] RUQ U/S: 1. Focal, apparently nonocclusive filling
defect in the main portal vein at the porta hepatis, with
hepatopetal flow just proximal, with a velocity of 40 cm/sec.
This could represent nonocclusive thrombus, or could be
artifact. Recommend dedicated liver Doppler evaluation. 2.
Moderate ascites.
.
[**2169-7-7**] CT head: 1. No acute intracranial abnormality. 2. Small
locules of gas in the cavernous sinus bilaterally. This is most
likely related to peripheral intravenous catheter. 3. Paranasal
sinus disease.
.
[**2169-7-8**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study
(images reviewed) of [**2168-8-19**], no major change.

Brief Hospital Course:
42 year old man with ETOH cirrhosis admitted with altered mental
status in the setting of cellulitis. Brief hospital course by
problem:
.
# Altered mental status: CT head neg for acute process. No
evidence of hypercarbia on VBG. No meningismus on exam to raise
concern for encephalitis or meningitis. Paracentesis negative
for SBP. Most likely secondary to hyponatremia and
encephalopathy in the setting of infection. Mental status
improved with antibiotics, lactulose, and rifaxi
