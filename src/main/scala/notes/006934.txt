Pertinent Results:
[**2145-6-22**] CTA Torso
IMPRESSION:
1. Status post ascending aortic replacement, with unchanged
appearance of the graft compared to [**2142**]. Neck vessels are
perfused from the true lumen and demonstrate good contrast
opacification. Persistent type B dissection is noted, with
marked increase compared to [**2143-1-10**] in the diameter of
the false lumen of the thoracic aorta, as well as a large focal
aneurysmal bulge extending into the left lung apex. There is
significant clot burden in the false lumen, with sluggish flow
and poor contrast opacification, making full evaluation of clot
burden difficult. If further evaluation is desired, delayed CTA
imaging or MRA could be considered.

2. Extension of type B dissection into the abdominal aorta.
Renal arteries
are perfused from the true lumen, demonstrate good
opacification. The celiac axis and SMA are primarily arising
from the false lumen, demonstrate poor contrast opacification.
The same is true for the [**Female First Name (un) 899**]. While this may be secondary to
early phase of imaging relative to contrast bolus, clinical
correlation to exclude ischemia is recommended.

3. Dependent atelectasis in the lungs, including adjacent to the
thoracic
aorta secondary to mass effect, which also causes deviation of
the trachea and central airways, with compression of the left
mainstem bronchus.

4. Bronchiectasis, most predominant at the bases.

5. IVC filter in adequate position.

6. Unchanged renal cysts.

7. Diverticulosis with no evidence for diverticulitis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 71435**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] via transfer for
further management of her back pain and aortic dissection. Upon
review of her CT scan, she was status post repair of a type A
aortic dissection however had a chronic and somewhat larger type
B dissection. Please see report from [**2145-6-22**] CTA. Her blood
pressure was tightly controlled. Her at home medications were
resumed. An attempt to reach Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 22833**] was made regarding her
coumadin however he was on vacation. It is unclear if coumadin
needs to be continued on her given her distant history of
heparin induced thrombocytopenia and DVT. She remained on it
during her hospital stay and will resume follow-up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 22833**] for anticoagulation as an outpatient. Her blood pressure
remained stable and equal in both arms. Her distal extremities
were well perfused. Her medications otherwise remained the same
and she was discharged home with a visiting nurse on [**2145-6-24**].
Prescriptions were given only for her coreg and losartan. She
will need a repeat CT scan in 6 months with echocardiogram and
follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], her primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 22833**] for coumadin dosing as an outpatient.
