Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2145**]
Chief Complaint:
status epilepticus

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation
placement of right subclavian central venous catheter
EEG monitoring

History of Present Illness:
56 year-old right-handed gentleman with a history of
frontotemporal dementia, seizure disorder, who presented to the
[**Hospital 4068**] Hospital with status epilepticus that was poorly
responsive to medications, requiring intubation + sedation,
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further eval and mgmt.
.
The pt was recently admitted twice for seizures, once to [**Hospital **]
Hospital from [**3-19**] to [**2113-3-21**], and once at [**Hospital1 18**] in late [**3-13**].
From his first seizure admit, he had a CT that showed moderate
ventriculomegaly and bifrontal atrophy, but no evidence of
hemorrhage or infarct. He also had an EEG that was unremarkable.
Then on his most recent admit to [**Hospital1 18**], he presented after a
series of seizures in the setting of PNA and fever, found to
have a left retrocardiac opacity and lactate of 4.5. He had a
lumbar puncture that was unrevealing, a repeat head CT which was
negative for a bleed but remarkable for marked frontotemporal
atrophy.  He also underwent an MRI to evaluate for a focal
lesion responsible for a seizure.  Aside from motion artifact
there was no clear focal lesion. Wellbutrin, trazodone and
Nameda were discontinued because of their associated risks with
seizures.  He was loaded with 1gram IV Dilantin at OSH. Dilantin
was continued and dose was adjusted for goal dilantin
level of [**11-19**].  An EEG was done which showed encephalopathy but

no seizure activity.  He did not have further seizures while in
house.  He was sleepy and slow to respond initially and this was
thought likely due to the ativan he had gotten in the ER and
prior to MRI. Prior to discharge he was alert and thought to be
at his baseline per family.
.
This episode, the patient was found seizing at his NH, [**Location (un) 107817**]. The EMTs transported him to [**Hospital 4068**] Hospital, and in route
noted his O2 sat to be 86% on a NRB, and his temp to be 102.1F.
Several attempts at intubation and IV access were unsuccessful
en route. At [**Last Name (un) 4068**], the pt was still in status epilepticus, and
remained so until after about 70 minutes of seizing he was
intubated and managed with valium, ativan and versed boluses.
The ED had not been able to intubate, but Anesthesia was
successful. On CXR, he was found to have a RUL PNA. He received
Tylenol, Etomidate, Succinycholine and 4.5L NS at the OSH ED.
.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**], where Neuro evaluated him in the
ED, and felt that his infection may have lowered his seizure
threshold as previously. A head CT was performed, results
stable. His blood pressure ran low in the ED (SBP 80's), and his
lactate was elevated (3.6). His pressure has improved with fluid
boluses. Also of note, his troponin is trending up (0.18 up from
0.02), and despite high CK has had normal CK-MB fraction and an
unchanged ECG. He received BCx, CTX, Vanc, Ativan, ASA,
Acyclovir, and 2L NS in the ED, as well as an LP.


Past Medical History:
-frontotemporal dementia, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. Per the
pt's wife, at baseline he is generally able to make his needs
known.  His speech consists of mostly answering questions with
"yes/no/OK."  He is fully dependent on his caretakers in all of
his ADLs.
-coronary artery disease, with history of myocardial infarction,
angioplasty and stent placement
-anxiety
-depression
-hyperlipidemia
-status-post prostate resection
-obstructive sleep apnea, on CPAP
-admitted to [**Hospital **] Hospital in [**2-10**] with pyelonephritis
-clostridium difficile enterocolitis


Social History:
The pt had been living with his wife until he was discharged
from [**Name (NI) **] in [**Month (only) 404**], at which time he was placed in a rehab
facility.  He has a distant history of cigarette use. No history
of alcohol or illicit drug abuse. He previously worked in real
estate. As above, he is now fully dependent on his caretakers
for all of his ADLs.  He is DNR, though no longer DNI (reversed
today).

Family History:
Remarkable for mother with frontotemporal dementia. No history
of seizure in other family members.

Radiology:

Head CT [**7-19**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Ventricular enlargement and cerebral atrophy, unchanged since
[**2113-3-27**].
2. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.

CXR [**7-18**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube in appropriate
position.
2. Right upper lung opacity could relate to aspiration or
pneumonia.

EEG [**7-19**]: IMPRESSION: Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow low
voltage
background with occasional generalized slowing. This indicates a

widespread encephalopathy affecting both cortical and
subcortical
structures. Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection
are
among the most common causes. There were no areas of prominent
focal
slowing, but encephalopathies may obscure focal findings. There
were no
epileptiform features.

MRI/MRA [**7-22**]: FINDINGS: Comparison was made with the previous
study of [**2113-3-28**].
Again moderate-to-severe ventriculomegaly seen involving the
latera
