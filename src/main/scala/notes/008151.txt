Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on Exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 108231**] is a 66 year old woman with PMHx s/f CHF (last EF
35%), CAD s/p recent CABG, prior PE, and Hodgkins Lymphoma s/p
XRT in 69 who presents with 1 week of dyspnea on exertion and
fatigue. The DOE has been slow onset over the past 7 days, and
demonstrates improvement with PRN lasix 20mg at home. There is
questionable orthopnea with nocturnal dry cough associatied with
3x/night awakenings. She denies fevers/chills, but espouses
worsening nausea with emesis x1, and worsening LE edema.

Upon arrival to the ED, vitals 97.8 59 113/36 18 93% RA, CBC s/f
WBC 10.4 with left shift, BNP of 7K. CXR demonstrated increased
airspace opacity in midlung, prominence of R hilum
(post-treatment), b/l pleural effusions, L basilar airspace
opacity, and bilateral airspace opacities secondary either to
pneumonia, assymetric effusions, or malignancy. 20mg IV lasix
was administered with approximately 350 cc of urine output.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, , myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or
red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative save dysphagia x the last several
years.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Past Medical History:
* CABG [**2164-4-28**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to RCA and SVG to OM, DES
to LCx in [**2163**]
* loculated left sided pleural effusion requiring left
thoracotomy and decortication with hospital course complicated
by hypoxic respiratory failure thought secondary to pneumonia-->
s/p trach and peg.
* admitted [**6-30**] s/p VT arrest which was complicated by VAP
Seen by EP during this admission and underwent an
electrophysiology study.  She did not have any ventricular
tachycardia induced, although they were able to induce atrial
flutter.  She was continued onamiodarone and it was decided not
to place an ICD at that point.
* VAP [**3-14**] resistant P. aeruginosa and Klebsiella sensitive to
pip/tazo and meropenem.
* sCHF, last LVEF = 35 % [**2164-6-11**]
* Diffuse carotid disease (45-99%)
50 to 99% right CCA stenosis. Unable to quantify right ICA
stenosis, but is unlikely to be severe. Left ICA 40-59% stenosis

* Hodgkin's disease stage 2 in '[**22**] treated with total body
radiation
* Reactive airways disease/Pulmonary Fibrosis
* Multiple PNAs, most recently in [**2164-6-10**] requiring ICU care

* Functional Asplenism s/p radiation treatment
* Radiation induced ovarian failure s/p total hysterectomy and
estradiol therapy

[**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10592**] [**Hospital Unit Name 53630**] [**2164-10-16**] 1:39 PM
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 108235**]
Reason: Are Infiltrates c/w infection? Has pulmonary fibrosis
worsen



[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   66 year old woman with history of pulmonary fibrosis and
worsening SOB x 1 week
   with R sided infiltrates on CXR with possible L sided
infiltrates as well
   (prior L sided decortication).
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   Are Infiltrates c/w infection? Has pulmonary fibrosis
worsened?
CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR IV CONTRAST:
   None.



Provisional Findings Impression: EAGg TUE [**2164-10-16**] 7:30 PM
PFI: Extensive multifocal airspace opacity and consolidation in
the bilateral
lower lungs suggests severe aspiration or pneumonia. Small
bilateral pleural
effusions. Probable concurrent mild pulmonary edema. Evidence of
pulmonary
hypertension and anemia.


Final Report
INDICATION: 66-year-old female with history of pulmonary
fibrosis and
worsening shortness of breath for one week, with right-sided
infiltrate on
chest x-ray and possible left-sided infiltrate. Evaluate for
infection or
worsening pulmonary fibrosis.

COMPARISON: [**2164-4-26**] and [**2164-6-14**].

TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained through the
lungs
according to the high-resolution CT protocol. Coronal and
sagittal reformats
were displayed.

CT CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The imaged thyroid gland is
normal. Two leads
follow a normal course from a left-sided battery pack
terminating in the right
atrium and right ventricle. The heart is enlarged without
pericardial
effusion. There is extensive coronary artery calcification.
There has been
prior CABG. Relative [**Name (NI) 13215**] of the intraventricular septum
compared to
the intraventricular blood suggests severe anemia. Increased
diameter of the
pulmonary artery up to 3.3 cm suggests pulmonary hypertension.

Mediastinal lymph nodes do not meet CT criteria for pathologic
enlargement.
There is no hilar or axillary lymphadeno
