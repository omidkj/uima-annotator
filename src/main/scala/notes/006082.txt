DATE OF DECEASED:  [**2183-4-21**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 70-year-old
male with a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma,
status post right nephrectomy in [**2157**] with known lung
metastases status post left lower lobe and right lower lobe
resection, right bronchial stent, XRT therapy, and
phototherapy on [**10/2182**] and [**12/2182**], history of CAD status
post MI in [**2174**] and [**2178**] with LAD stent, history of
congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 25
percent, diabetes mellitus with chronic renal insufficiency,
presented with increasing shortness of breath at outside
hospital, found to have whiteout of right lung and
obstructive right mainstem bronchial stent.  Transferred here
for possible intervention.  On [**2183-4-15**], the patient
underwent stent removal after the stent was noted to have
migrated distally, with some granulation tissue present.  In
the PACU, the patient was noted to have left upper extremity
and left lower extremity weakness.  Neurology was called and
MRI was limited by movement but per the neuro team showed
multiple bilaterally likely embolic CVAs.  On [**2183-4-16**], the
patient had generalized tonic-clonic seizures.  He was given
Ativan and Dilantin.  Had a recurrent generalized tonic-
clonic seizure in the afternoon and was loaded with
fosphenytoin again.  He was transferred to the Neurology ICU
and had one recurrent seizure on [**2183-4-17**] and since has
been seizure free.  He was transferred to the floor on
[**2183-4-18**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 96.8, T-MAX
97.8, heart rate 78 to 89, blood pressure 112/52 to 155/76,
and respirations 23.  Saturation 97 percent on 40 percent
face mask.  GENERAL:  He is mildly agitated with tangential
speech, alert and oriented times 3.  HEENT:  Mucous membranes
dry.  No JVD, no carotid bruits.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular
rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops with distant
heart sounds.  PULMONARY:  Breath sounds absent on the right
and left with basilar coarse crackles.  ABDOMEN:  Soft,
nontender, and nondistended.  Normoactive bowel sounds.
EXTREMITIES:  Trace lower extremity edema, 2 plus dorsalis
pedis pulses.  NEUROLOGIC:  Cranial nerves right facial
flattening, bilateral eyebrows elevated.  Tongue is midline.
Right upper extremity is 5 out of 5.  Strength in left upper
extremity is 3 to 4 out of 5.  Strength in right lower
extremity 2 out of 5 and left lower extremity 0 out of 5.
Bilateral downgoing toes.  Light touch intact bilaterally.

LABORATORY:  White count 7.8, hematocrit 31.5, and platelets
183.  Sodium 146, potassium 4.0, chloride 104, bicarbonate
32, BUN 69, creatinine 2.1, glucose 131, magnesium 2.1, and
Dilantin 21.  ABG; 7.35, 56, and 154 on 40 percent face mask.
EKG 106 beats per minute, normal sinus rhythm, normal axis
and intervals, left atrial enlargement, old inferior
myocardial infarction, and T-wave inversions in 1 and aVL.
EEG on [**2183-4-16**] showed left frontal swelling.  MRI on
[**2183-4-16**] was nondiagnostic with movement artifact but
likely shows bilateral multiple CVAs, likely embolic.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Respiratory.  The patient with metastatic
renal cell carcinoma to the lung, status post right mainstem
bronchial stent, status post removal with post-obstruction
pneumonia.  Cultured for Streptococcus pneumoniae and MRSA on
vancomycin and ceftriaxone.  Saturating 90s on 40 percent
face mask.  We will continue 40 percent face mask.  The
patient's code status was DNR/DNI and after discussion with
the family on prognosis, he was made CMO.

Cardiovascular.  CAD, status post MI and LAD stent.  CHF with
ejection fraction 25 percent, not complaining of any anginal
symptoms.  The patient was dry to euvolemic.  He was given
gentamicin and IV fluids 75 cc an hour.  History of aspirin
allergy.  He was continued on Lipitor and his ACE inhibitor
was held as the patient with single kidney.  Blood pressure
was well controlled.

Chronic renal insufficiency.  Creatinine roughly baseline
secondary to diabetes and status post nephrectomy.  He was
continued on Epogen and was given gentle IV fluids as his
urine output was low.

Renal cell carcinoma with metastases.  After discussion with
the family on patient's poor prognosis, his treatment was
converted to all palliative treatment, and Palliative Care
consult was obtained.

Neurological.  Multiple embolic bilateral CVAs, source may be
cardiogenic, although not a candidate for anticoagulation and
history of aspirin allergy.  The patient was continued on
Dilantin with a level of about 20.  He was not a candidate
for barbiturate therapy.  He was DNR/DNI.

DISPOSITION:  The patient's therapy was converted to
palliative care and the patient's code status was converted
to comfort measures only.  On [**2183-4-21**] at 6:20 a.m., the
patient was pronounced deceased.  His family was alerted.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient deceased.
