RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2137-11-10**] 8:43 AM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: eval for effusions

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
69 year old woman s/p MV repair/CABGx1
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for effusions
STUDY: PA and lateral chest [**2137-11-10**].

HISTORY: Evaluate for pleural effusion.

FINDINGS: Comparison is made to previous study from [**2137-11-5**].

The single lead pacemaker and median sternotomy wires are
unchanged. There is unchanged cardiomegaly. There is improvement
of the left-sided pleural effusion since the previous study.
There remains some atelectasis at both lung bases.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement. No mass/thrombus in the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection velocity. No thrombus in
the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA. PFO is
present. Left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum at
rest.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV cavity size. Mild regional LV systolic
dysfunction.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional left ventricular wall motion findings
as shown below; remaining LV segments contract normally.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Normal RV systolic
function.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Normal descending aorta
diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AR.


MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate
mitral annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral valve
chordae. Mild to moderate ([**12-18**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild
to moderate [[**12-18**]+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
Physiologic (normal) PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE BYPASS
The left atrium is markedly dilated. No mass/thrombus is seen in
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. A patent foramen ovale is present. A
left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at
rest. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild
inferior waqll hypokinesis. The remaining left ventricular
segments contract normally. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-18**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen
with a systolic BP of 100mm Hg. SBP was raised to 160mmHg with
phenylephrine and Trendelenberg position. This resulted in
moderate to severe (3+) MR with a posteriorly directed MR jet..
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.

POST BYPASS
Biventricular function remains unchanged from prebypass. There
is a ring prosthesis in the mitral position. NoMR is visualized.
Peak and mean gradient across MV is 7 and 3 mm Hg respectively.
Flow by Color Doppler is still visualized across the patent
foramen ovale.
I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the CCU and diuresed. Her comadin was held,
and she awaited normalization of her INR, and was started on
cipro for a UTI. She was taken to the operating room on [**11-4**]
where she underwent a MV repair and CABG x 1. She was
transferred to the ICU in critical but stable condition. She did
well in the immediate postop period and was extubated that
evening. On POD 1 her chest tubes were removed. On POD2 her PPM
was interegated and she was transferred to the step down floors
for continuing care. Over the next several days her Beta
blockade was adjusted, she was actively diuresed and her
coumadin was adjusted to a target INR of [**1-18**].5. On POD7 it was
decided she was stable and ready for discharge to rehab at [**Hospital **]

Medications on Admission:
at home:
toprol XL 50 mg daily
coumadin 5 mg
