CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Status post IMI with new onset atrial
fibrillation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old
woman with a history of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] and TIAs who awoke
at 1:00 a.m. with diffuse chest and back pain.  She called
her daughter who arrived and found the patient down and
pulseless.  The patient started breathing spontaneously one
to five minutes later.  The patient was then taken to [**Hospital3 7900**] where an EKG revealed ST elevations in the inferior
leads.  She received IV nitroglycerin and became hypotensive
so nitroglycerin was discontinued.  She was started on a
heparin drip and given aspirin and Plavix which she is
already taking as an outpatient.  She was then transferred to
the [**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac
catheterization which revealed an LCMA, normal LAD with 30
percent stenosis, LCX normal, and RCA with 100 percent
stenosis proximal with a thrombus.  The RCA occlusion was
stented.  The procedure was complicated by bradycardia and
hypotension with reperfusion and rapid atrial fibrillation of
280 during the right heart catheterization.

The patient was shocked times two and went back into normal
sinus rhythm.  She then went into atrial fibrillation again
and was shocked again.  At this time, an Amiodarone drip was
implemented with conversion to normal sinus rhythm.  The
patient was also started on dopamine for hypotension.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**].

TIAs.

Carotid disease, status post left CEA with Dacron graft.

Benign breast lump, status post excision.

Whipple disease.

Migraines with visual aura.

Mild asthma.

High cholesterol.

Esophageal spasm.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Multivitamin.
4. Mestinon 50 mg p.o. q.i.d.


ALLERGIES:  Lidocaine which causes hives, IV contrast dye
which causes hives, Demerol, codeine, Betadine, penicillin
which causes GI upset, and gatifloxacin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is a former tobacco user.  She was born
in [**Location (un) **].  She is a widow.  She lives with her daughter who
is a physician at [**Name (NI) **].

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Pulse 67, blood pressure
109/49.  General appearance:  Lying in bed in no acute
distress, refused to be examined.  Lungs:  Anteriorly clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  No rhonchi, no wheezes.
Coronary:  Regular rate and rhythm.  S1, S2.  No murmurs,
rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen:  Obese, soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Groin:  Right-sided sheath in place.
Extremities:  Dorsalis pedis are palpable bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, CBC revealed a crit of 32,
white count 13.0, platelets 331,000.  Chem-7 was all within
normal limits.  Coagulations were within normal limits.  CK
MB was 128 with an index of 16.  Troponin T was above 50.

Chest x-ray had revealed mild CHF.

EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm at 71, [**Street Address(2) 1766**] elevation in
II, III, and aVF, ST depressions in V2-V6, I, and aVL, normal
axis.  This was obtained at the outside hospital.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 74-year-old woman with a
prior history of CAD, who presented with an inferior
myocardial infarction now status post stenting of the RCA
with periprocedural atrial fibrillation required
cardioversion times three and Amiodarone drip and also with
hypotension which required a dopamine drip.

CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient is status post IMI with stenting
of the RCA with good TIMI III flow.  She, however, has
evidence of RV infarction.  She was continued on Plavix,
aspirin, and treated with an Integrelin drip for 18 hours.
Lopressor was started and increased to 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.

The rest of her hospital course was uneventful  and she was
discharged on metoprolol 25 p.o. b.i.d., Atorvastatin 5 mg
p.o. q.d., Plavix, and aspirin.

PUMP:  An echocardiogram was obtained which revealed an EF
above 55 percent with inferior hypokinesis and 1+ MR.  A
repeat echocardiogram was recommended in one to two months.
The patient remained in normal sinus rhythm.  He electrolytes
were repleted as needed.  The Amiodarone drip was stopped.

PULMONARY:  Her oxygenation initially was 100 percent on 4
liters.  On the day of discharge, her lung examination
revealed no crackles.  She had no shortness of breath and she
was breathing well at room air with normal oxygenation.

DISCHARGE PLAN:  The patient was discharged home with follow-
up with her primary care physician who is Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].  She
was also referred to Cardiology with whom she will have to
follow-up within one month with recommendation to have an
echocardiogram repeated.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Inferior myocardial infarction
complicated by rapid atrial fibrillation and hypotension.

Congestive heart failure.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Guaifenesin p.r.n.
3. Atorvastatin 5 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
5. Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
6. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
7. Pyridostigmine 50 mg p.o. q.i.d.
