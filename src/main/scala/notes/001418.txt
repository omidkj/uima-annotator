History of Present Illness:
MICU HPI:

Reverend [**Known lastname 13469**] is a 68 year old homeless man with DM, HTN,
seizure disorder, chronic pain, recently admitted [**Date range (1) 94315**] for
presumed aspiration PNA c/b rhabdo and ARF discharged on
Clindamycin and Amlodipine for elevated BP now re-presenting to
ED with initially vague complaints of SOB, ongoing productive
cough of green sputum, and weakness as well as decreased UOP.
Also had reported 60 lb weight loss over last 4 months and
constipation x 1 month.
On initial ED triage, VS 97.9 116/96 75 14 99%RA but when
brought back to room SBP 50s-60s with HR 70s. Per report, pt
mentating normally with bounding pulses at the time. BP taken
manually in all 4 extremities and persistently low despite 5L
IVF. Pt complained of CP and EKG with ST depressions precordial
leads, I, AVL, STE III so Cardiology was consulted who felt
changes were likely reflective of demand ischemia related to
hypotension. He received rectal ASA 325mg and had normal bedside
echo with preserved EF. He was started on peripheral dopa for
hypotension with SBP up to 100s-110s but was subsequently
tachycardic to 120 with more pronounced ST depressions so RIJ
placed as well as A line and he was swicthed to levophed with
decreased HR to 70s and resolution of ST changes. He was
intubated for airway protection in setting of progressive
obtundation, reportedly was never hypoxic, and recieved
vancomycin and meropenem for ? sepsis due to history of PCN
allergy. Labs significant for WBC 10.5 with 12% bands, normal
lactate, ARF with Cr 4.8 from 1.1 [**7-30**], CK 698 (from peak [**2123**]),
trop 0.05. CT head for progressive obtundation was unremarkable
and CT torso with bibasilar infiltrates consistent with
aspiration.

At time of transfer, patient on 0.06 levophed, fentnayl, versed
with BP 135/57 HR 68.
