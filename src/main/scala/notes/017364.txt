Transfer for respiratory failure

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 39602**] is a 51 yo man with a diagnosis of pulmonary
alveolar proteinosis who presents in transfer from [**Location 75548**] for treatment of pneumonia and respiratory
failure. Per H&P from OSH, the patient was in his usual state of
health until [**9-28**] when he developed URI symptoms, dyspnea,
cough, fever and chills. He presented to the hospital today and
was found to have a large LLL/lingular pneumonia on chest X-ray.
He was afebrile on admission there with RR 49, HR 143, BP
111/75. He was started on IV linezolid and levofloxacin and
admitted to the ICU. O2 sat on arrival to the ICU was 88% on
FiO2 70%. ABG was 7.48/33/51. His RR increased to 50, his HR
remained 130s and his temp increased to 100.4, and he was
intubated at that time. he was placed on ventilator support -
assist control, tidal volume 600, FiO2 100% and RR 12. He was
placed on a propofol drip for sedation. He was suctioned for
thick yellow brownish-colored sputum, blood-tinged. Gram stain
showed <10 epis, 1+ gram positive cocci. BP dropped to 89/40 and
he received a NS bolus and started on neosynephrine. Repeat ABG
was 7.43/39/222. High A-a gradient of 442. He was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

Upon arrival to the ICU, the patient was intubated, sedated, on
neo gtt. Central line and R radial A-line placed. Bronchoscopy
performed showing large mucus plug on the left.

On transfer to the floor, he felt that his shortness of breath
had improved, but was still requring supplemental oxygen.  He
reported feeling tired, but was improved since his admission

CT CHEST [**2165-10-2**] - IMPRESSION: Confluent consolidation involving
nearly the entire left lung with either bronchocentric or
vascular dissemination to the right lung with assoicated
mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy most suggestive of
infection. Alternatively, consolidative forms of
bronchoaleveolar carcinoma or lymphoma could have a similar
appearance.
Review of the outside CT from [**2161**] and [**2164**] shows near
resolution of previous extensive ground glass opacity, diagnosed
as pulmonary alveloar proteinosis which may be idiopathic or
related to inhalational exposure.  Extensive mediastinal soft
tissue and lymphadenopathy.


Brief Hospital Course:
51 yo man with IBD, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis who presented
from [**Hospital6 19155**] with pneumonia and respiratory
failure.

# Respiratory failure/Pneumococcal Pneumonia: In the setting of
an acute pulmonary process, this was initially attributed to
bacterial pneumonia, likely community acquired, supported by
intial GPC's on sputum at [**Hospital6 19155**].  However,
PCP and Nocardia were also considered given known diagnosis of
PAP and labs were sent accordingly. CXR demonstrated unilateral
disease, not c/w PAP flare and more concerning for an acute
process. Patient was intubated and intially started on an ARDS
type ventilation with low tidal volumes. Patient was also
underwent bronchoscopy with aspiration of large, thick mucus
cast. Legionella Ag was sent and was negative. The patient was
initially started on vancomycin and aztreonam.  He was
subsequently switched to levaquin after cultures (blood and
sputum) from [**Location (un) **] returned possitive for Streptococcus
Pneumoniae. On [**10-3**], patient grew agitated in the evening and
self-extubated.  He was maintained with adequate saturations on
highflow facemask.  Patient's mental status rapidly improved
over the next several days. His CXR also rapidly improved with
increased oxygenation of the RL fields.  F/u of the nocardia
culture was negative to date and PCP smear was never done in the
lab. On transfer to the floor, his oxygen requirement was
initially 4L.  Levaquin was continued.  He had no acute events
on the floor, and O2 saturation was 94% on RA on day of
discharge.  Physical Therapy evaluated him during his admission
and recomme
