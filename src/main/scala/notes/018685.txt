History of Present Illness:
[**2108-3-7**] MICU Resident Accept Note
.
cc: Transferred to MICU for acute on chronic respiratory
failure.
.
HPI: 54 yo male with Crohn's disease c/b PSC and cirrhosis
awaiting Liver transplant, pulmonary sarcoid, recent sinusitis,
admitted [**2-28**] with cc: fever, SOB, hemoptysis and calf pain. He
was amditted to the medical service He had CTA and LENI which
was negative for PE but CT showed intersitital and bronchial
opacties. His ANC was 530 and he was started on Cefepime,
azitrho, vancomycin and admitted to the medical service on the
floor. Hospital course notable for:
.
1. PNA: Seen by pulmonary consult who felt likely bacterial PNA.
Sputum cultures were normal. Urine legionella, serum
galactomanon, cryptococcal negative. IgG positive for
mycoplasma, but IgM negative ruling out acute mycoplasma. Fungal
Cx neg. Pt's Vanco and Azithro d/c'd on [**3-5**].
.
2. PANCYTOPENIA: He was seen by heme consult for pancytopenia.
DAT was positive on surface but not eluate, so he was felt to
NOT be hemolyzing (this can occur in hypergammaglobulinemic
states.) BM showed cellular BM- they felt liekly due to splenic
sequestration vs (less likely) MDS.
.
3. BRBPR: Had episode of BRBPR overnight on [**3-3**]. Colonoscpy
normal [**8-2**] (inactive chrons and polyp.). Hct stable so
observed, and c.diff checked.
.
4. Hyponatermia:NA 128 on [**3-5**]. Was felt to be due to siADH and
fluid resricted and diuresed with improvement to  132 on [**3-8**].
.
5. ID was consulted [**3-3**] who rec dc azithro, vanc. Capsofungin
was added for candidiasis.
.
6. FEN: Was not taking pos due to thrush. TFs were started on
[**3-6**] and patient was started on pos.
.
Called by NF team on [**3-7**] at 11pm to see patient for increasing
respiratory distress. VS 75%RA to 96%NRB breathing at 30 with
accesory muscle use. ABG on NRB: 7.5/39/74. CXR shows worsenig
bialteral infiltrates vs. failure. He was given lasix 40iv x 1,
MsO4 1mg, vanco 1 g, flagyl 500 and started on mask-ventilation
and transferred to the ICU team.

CXR:Worsening bibasilar infilatrates


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Respiratory Failure: History of pulmonary sarcoid and now
with worsening pneumonia. Pt was just recently started on Tube
feeds and pos-- aspiration is possible. Given fever, worsening
bibasilar infiltrates PNA likely although worsening sarcoid
cannot be ruled out. Was given Lasix/MsO4/NTG with no diuresis
by NF team. Had negative CTA/LENI on admission.
Patient was intubated for respiratory failure on am of [**3-8**].
Very hypoxic requiring Fio2 100%, high peep. Even so, he began
to desat to 40% and had a PEA arrest subsequent to this. His O2
sats were improved after about 45 minutes of coding the patient
with very high PEEPs and continued Fio2 100%. AFter patient
continued to decline, an esophageal baloon was used to measure
pleural pressures and pt. was tried on nitric oxide to
vasodilate pulm arteries without success.
.
2. CVS. Does not appear to be in pulmonary edema. Was given
lasix/MsO4/NTG without effect. Echo [**6-2**] shows normal EF.  Echo
during code with big RV but
.
3. Hepatology: PSC with cirrhosis awaiting Liver transplant. .
U/S shows diffusely heterogeneous and nodular liver, consistent
with the given history of PSC and cirrhosis, minimal ascites,
patent portal vein.
Patient developed shock liver after pea arrest.
.
4. Renal. Creatinine Stable. ABG shows metabolic alkalosis,
likely due to intravascular volume depletion. Continue to
monitor.
After arrest, pt. had significantly elevated lactate and
metabolic and resp acidosis. The resp acidosis was eventually
resolved but patient continued to be more and more acidotic with
a rising lactate to a max of 30.
.
After PEA arrest, patient was as mentioned above VERY difficult
to ventilate and oxygenate  with a rising lactate (to a max of
30 prior to his death). He was very volume overloaded and
requiring at times 4 pressors to maintain adequate MAPS. He had
multiorgan dysfunction with anuric renal failure, shock liver,
possible anoxic brain injury with fixed, dilated fluids,
respiratory failure. He also had rising INR and possible DIC
with some bleeding from the ETT tube. Renal felt HD or CVVH
would NOT be tolerated.
As the patient continued to decline and was heading  towards
another cardiac arrest despite broad specturm antibiotics
including antifungals, pressors, bicarbonate drips and boluses,
a family meeting was held and it was decided that patient would
be made comfort measures only. Patient was not, however
extubated and pressors were continued per family request.
Patient died several hours later at 8:35 PM. The family agreed
to a Post with the exclusion of the brain.
