Physical Exam:

Gen: Lying in bed, tremulous and mild distress
HEENT: NC/AT, moist oral mucosa
Neck: supple, no carotid or vertebral bruit
CV: sinus tachycardia, Nl S1 and S2, no murmurs/gallops/rubs
Lung: Clear to auscultation bilaterally but tachypneic
aBd: +BS soft, nontender
ext: no edema

Neurologic examination:
Mental status: Awake and alert but not coherent.  Rambling
speech
with incoherent content.  Does not answer questions or follow
commands.

Cranial Nerves:
Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 4 to 2 mm
bilaterally.  Left gaze preference but intact extraocular
movements with OCMs.  R UMN facial droop.  Palate elevation
symmetrical.  Tongue midline, movements intact

Motor/Sensory:
Decr'd bulk throughout and tone decr'd on the right.  Does not
cooperate with formal resistance testing but moves left arm
purposefully and leg spontaneously.  Much fewer spontaneous
movement from the right side but will withdraw to noxious stim
bilaterally, again less on the right.

CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS [**4-19**]
CT OF THE ABDOMEN: Chronic interstitial lung changes at the
bases of the lungs bilaterally are again identified, similar in
appearance. Mild cardiomegaly is again identified. Coronary
artery calcifications are again identified. Extensive
calcification of the aorta and its branches is also noted. The
patency of these vessels cannot be evaluated due to lack of
contrast. However, within the limitations of a non- contrast
scan, the small bowel loops are unremarkable. There is no wall
thickening or bowel dilatation. The spleen is unremarkable.
Within the liver, multiple low- attenuation lesions (2, 24 and
2, 29) are identified and not completely evaluated on this
single phase study. Within the pancreas, there are two hypodense
lesions (2, 27 and 2, 29). These are incompletely characterized
on this non- contrast study. Multiple bilateral renal cysts are
again identified, most of which have increased in size when
compared to the prior exam. Contrast from prior CAT scan is seen
within the collecting system of the right kidney, however,
minimal contrast appears to fill the right ureter. There has
been interval development of right- sided hydronephrosis due to
a right- sided [**Month/Year (2) 96980**] obstruction. The left kidney demonstrates
normal excretion of contrast. Scattered mesenteric and
retroperitoneal lymph nodes are again identified, none of which
meet CT criteria for pathological enlargement. Patient is status
post right hemicolectomy. There is no free fluid or free air.
CT OF THE PELVIS: The rectum and sigmoid colon are unremarkable.
There is diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
There is a Foley catheter within the bladder. Contrast is seen
within the bladder lumen. There is no pelvic or inguinal
lymphadenopathy. Extensive diverticulosis without evidence of
diverticulitis is noted. Numerous phleboliths are seen within
the pelvis.
BONE WINDOWS: Multiple old right-sided rib fractures are
identified, with delayed/non-[**Hospital1 **] of right tenth rib. No
suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are noted.
IMPRESSION: Please note there is a change from the initial wet
read; the presence of right sided hydronephrosis is now added..
1. There has been interval development of right-sided
hydronephrosis and right- sided [**Hospital1 96980**] obstruction.
2. Interval increase in size of numerous bilateral renal cysts.
3. Multiple hepatic cysts.
4. Pancreatic hypodense lesions, incompletely characterized.
4. Extensive calcifications of the aorta and its branches.
5. Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
6. Right-sided rib fractures with possible delayed/nonunion of
the right tenth rib (300B, 7).

ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No left atrial mass/thrombus
seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography). The
estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%) No masses or thrombi are seen in
the left ventricle. The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-6**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Dilated right ventricle with mild systolic
dysfunction. Preserved left ventricular systolic function.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate-to-severe tricuspid
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage,
edema, or major vascular territorial infarction evident on this
non-contrast head CT. No change since [**2153-2-3**]. Again seen
is promine
