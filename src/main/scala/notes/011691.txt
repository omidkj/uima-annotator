History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 15131**] is a 64year old male with hepatic sarcoidosis and
NASH cirrhosis complicated by refractory ascites, LE edema,
esophageal varices, s/p TIPS placement in [**Month (only) **] who initially
presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with altered mental status.

The patient was well compensated until about 1 year prior when
he had a series of medical complications including a broken
humerus c/b staph infection, interstitial nephritis, nephrectomy
for benign renal cyst, and recent left hip fracture after
another fall. The patient underwent hip surgery at the end of
[**Month (only) **] in [**State 108**] and has spent the last month at [**Hospital1 9494**] Rehab. According to MD note from rehab, the patient's wife
thought that he looked more sluggish on day of admission
compared to the last few days. Patient denies this. The patient
is on lactulose after TIPS procedure and had 4 BMs on Friday,
[**1-10**] on Saturday, 2 BMs Sunday. An ammonia level was checked and
found to be 160. The patient was brought in to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation of hepatic encephalopathy. While in the ED,
diagnostic paracentesis reviewed a WBC in 500s though on 8%PMN
and patient was started on CTX.

While on the floor, patient received 100g of albumin for SBP
treatment. Expediated transplant work-up was also started. On
day of transfer he was noted to be dyspneic and was hypoxic to
low 90s on RA. He was given nebulizer treatments without
improvement. EKG showed ?lateral ST changes with elevated
troponin to 0.48. Patient was given aspirin and monitored
telemetry. CXR revealed pulmonary edema and patient was given IV
lasix 40mg. With no response, pt was given lasix IV 80mg and
foley catheter was placed. He had total of 125cc UOP. Given
ongoing respiratory distress, patient was transferred to MICU
for closer monitoring.


Past Medical History:
1) Decompensated cirrhosis [**2-10**] NASH/hepatic sarcoidosis
---last EGD was done at an OSH last year (no report), previous
EGD @ [**Hospital1 18**] [**12/2114**] noted three cords of grade 1 esophageal
varices.
---refractory ascites requiring serial paracentesis
2) Sarcoidosis dx [**2106**] and this diagnosis was based on hilar
lymphadenopathy, raised ACE level, raised calcium and a
mediastinal lymph node biopsy that showed granulomatous change.
3) Renal mass s/p left total nephrectomy [**12/2111**] (pathology
noted
that overall, the morphologic and immunophenotypic findings are
consistent with a reactive lymphoid infiltrate.)
4) Elevated BMI.
5) Hyperlipidemia.
6) IDDM
7) Hypertension

IMAGING
==============
Coronary Cath [**2118-8-18**]:
COMMENTS:
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease with old, mid total
occlusion of the LAD which has no break and is well
collateralized.
2. Moderately severe pulmonary hypertension.
.
TTE [**2118-8-17**]:
IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
regional and excellent global biventricular systolic function.
Mild pulmonary artery hypertension.
.
CXR [**2118-8-17**]:
Moderately severe diffuse infiltrative pulmonary abnormality has
improved since [**8-16**], after worsening over the preceding two
days.  The interval change is probably resolving hydrostatic
edema.  Azygous distension persists indicating elevated central
venous pressure or volume, and indicates a potential for further
diuresis.  Heart is top normal size.  Pleural effusions are
minimal, if any.
.
Anal Warts Biopsy:
Anus, biopsy (A-B):
Low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (condyloma
acuminatum).
.
CXR [**2118-8-20**]:
FINDINGS:  The heart continues to be mildly enlarged with
bilateral alveolar infiltrates, upper lobe greater than lower
lobe.  The pulmonary vessels are ill-defined.  A few Kerley B
lines are seen.  The
