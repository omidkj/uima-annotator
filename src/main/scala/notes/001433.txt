Service:  CCU
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 73-year-old gentlemen
with a past medical history of three vessel coronary artery
disease, status post a coronary bypass graft in [**2112**] with a
saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending along with
an saphenous vein graft to an OM and an saphenous vein graft
at that time was not used.  Patient was in his usual state of
health until the morning of admission when he presented to an
outside hospital with severe substernal chest pain that
failed to radiate to the extremities, the jaw, or back.  He
did complain, however, of some shortness of breath, nausea,
and diaphoresis.  He states that his symptoms had been
increasing in intensity for about one to two weeks, but the
most intense he had experienced since his coronary artery
bypass graft 20 years ago.  He rates the pain as a 9 on a
scale of [**2-2**].  The patient attempted to relieve his chest
pain with an antacid along with sublingual nitroglycerin.  He
was rushed to the Emergency Room.  Electrocardiogram failed
to show any ST changes, however, his troponin was 1.9 and his
CK was 16.9.  He was then transferred to [**Hospital3 **] for
further evaluation.  A catheterization on the [**9-5**] revealed severely elevated filling pressures with a
wedge of 25 and a left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of
30.  Cardiac output was 5.6 liters with a cardiac index of
2.5 liters/minutes/meters squared.  The left ventriculography
revealed a moderately depressed ejection fraction of about
41% along with global hypokinesis and a more severe inferior
hypo-akinesis with 2+ MR.  The coronary angiography revealed the
left anterior descending totally occluded proximally.  The left
circumflex was a diffusely diseased vessel.  The OMs were
completely occluded.  The right coronary artery was also
completely occluded proximally and was filling by
collaterals.  The graft angiography revealed a 95% ostial
stenosis of the saphenous vein graft to the left anterior
descending.  The saphenous vein graft to the OM had a 90%
ostial stenosis along with an 80% mid stenosis and a 40%
touchdown stenosis.  The saphenous vein graft to the
posterior descending artery was known to be occluded.  A
intraaortic balloon pump was placed and the patient was
returned to the Coronary Care Unit for further management.

ALLERGIES:  Patient reports no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is retired.  He lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **]
reports a 40 pack year history.  He quit at the time of his
coronary artery bypass graft 20 years ago.  He denies any
alcohol or intravenous drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for a mother who had coronary
artery disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile.  A blood
pressure of 102/64.  Heart rate of 92 beats per minute.
Respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute.  An oxygen
saturation of 94% on six liters of nasal cannula.  In
general, this is an obese elderly gentlemen who was in no
apparent distress.  His pupils equal, round and reactive to
light and his extraocular movements were intact.  His mucous
membranes was moist and his oropharynx was clear.  Patient
had an extremely thick neck and jugular venous pressure and
lymphadenopathy could not be appreciated.  His heart was
regular rate and rhythm with distant heart sounds.  There was
a faint systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal
border.  His lungs showed diffuse crackles, predominantly in
the lower half of both lungs.  He had decreased breath sounds
in the apexes of both lungs.  His abdomen was obese,
nontender, slightly distended, but not firm.  He had positive
bowel sounds.  His extremities had chronic venous stasis changes
along with +2 pedal edema bilaterally.  Dorsalis pedis pulses
were appreciated.

LABORATORIES UPON ADMISSION:  Revealed a white blood cell
count of 9.45, a hematocrit of 28.9, a platelet count of
248,000.  Sodium of 140, potassium 4.3, chloride 102,
bicarbonate 27, BUN of 31, creatinine of 1.2 and a glucose of
268.  His calcium was 8.8, magnesium of 1.6, phosphate of
2.7.  His INR was 1.2.

Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm.  A first degree AV
block, left axis deviation, right bundle branch block, left
atria was slightly enlarged.  There were Q waves in the
inferior leads.  There was also Q waves in the anterior
lateral leads.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 73-year-old gentlemen with known
coronary artery disease, status post a three vessel coronary
artery bypass graft in [**2122**] who presented with severe
saphenous vein graft occlusion.  His problem list includes
the following:

1.  Cardiac:  The patient was evaluated by the Cardiothoracic
Surgery Team who felt that the patient was not a surgical
candidate given the lack of touchdown sites and severely
elevated procedureal risk. He was then referred to the
Interventional Cardiology Service for possible PCI intervention
on femoral-femoral bypass support.  After reviewing the
films, the Interventional Cardiology Service felt that his
two grafts were stentable but with severely elevated risk that
was lower than redo CABG. He went to the laboratory and was
placed on the bypass machine and successfully had his two
occluded saphenous venous grafts stented.  He was then
returned to the floor.  The intraaortic balloon pump was
removed and the [**Hospital 228**] medical regimen was optimized.  He had
no evidence of post-procedure myocardial infarction.
This included placing the patient on an aspirin, Plavix, a
low dose beta-[**Last Name (LF) 7005**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] angiotensin receptor [**First Name3 (LF) 7005**] and a
statin.  An echocardiogram was performed which revealed that
he had a left ventricular ejection fraction of about 40%.  It
also showed severe akinetic and hypokinetic left ventricle.
The echocardiogram also estimated the patient to have +2
mitral regurgitation.  During the patient's stay, he had no
chest pain or other myocardial infarction symptoms.  He
remained in sinus rhythm with limited ectopy on telemetry.

2.  Pulmonary:  The patient was electively intubated for
agitation.  During his time, he appears to have developed a
possible aspiration pneumonia for which he was treated with
levofloxacin, vancomycin, and Flagyl.  He was also
aggressively diuresed secondary to pulmonary edema.  He was
successfully weaned from the ventilator and remained on nasal
cannula oxygen at the time of this dictation.

3.  Renal:  The patient's baseline creatinine was estimated
at about 1.3.  Following the dye load that he received during
his two procedures, he developed acute renal failure with a
creatinine that bumped to 2.2.  His medications were renally
dosed and nephrotoxins were avoided.  At the time of this
discharge summary, his creatinine had decreased from 2.2 to
1.4.

4.  Hematology:  Following return of the catheterization
laboratory, the patient started to have some bright red blood
by the nasogastric tube.  The Integrilin was discontinued and
his hematocrit was followed.  He did receive two units of
packed red blood cells during his stay and his hematocrit
bumped appropriately.  He remained on a proton pump inhibitor
throughout his stay.  The patient's blood was cleared very
rapidly after discontinuing the Integrilin and his hematocrit
remained stable and he had no signs of hemodynamic
instabili
