History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 108855**] is an 84 yo M with history of atrial fibrillation
on coumadin, ventricular tachycardia, and systolic CHF (ejection
fraction 35-40%), and baseline rhythm complete heart block
status post pacer placements who presents after a fall down
stairs with loss of consciousness. At around 2am the morning of
admission, Mr. [**Known lastname 108855**] got up from bed and went into the
kitchen to drink scotch. He drank "[**1-16**] cup." Immediately after,
he attempted to go down the stairs to the bedroom and this was
the last thing he remembered before being in the ED. Per wife,
she heard "thumps" and immediately went to the stairs, where she
found the patient unconscious with blood behind his head. He was
completely still and she [**Month/Day (2) **] any shaking, tongue biting, or
incontinence. She immediately called 911. Upon EMT arriving, the
patient became somewhat interactive.
.
The patient [**Month/Day (2) **] feeling shortness of breath, chest pain, or
lightheaded before the fall. He does not recall tripping. He did
not feel any different than usual yesterday evening and [**Month/Day (2) **]
any recent viral illness. Of note, two days before admission the
patient did have one episode of light headedness after getting
out of bed in the morning, requiring him to lean against the
wall. He felt much better after drinking [**Location (un) 2452**] juice and felt
completely improved after lunch that day. He now complains of
chest pain since the fall.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 108855**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] fever, chills, night sweats, headache,
vision changes, sore throat, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria.

Pertinent Results:
CXR ([**2163-6-23**]) - There is moderate cardiomegaly, mild vascular
congestion, slightly increased compared to [**2162-11-20**].
Severe pulmonary artery dilatation indicating pulmonary arterial
hypertension has worsened. Transvenous pacemaker/defibrillator
leads end in the right atrium and right ventricle respectively.
There is no pleural effusion and no pneumothorax. No displaced
fractures.

CT head ([**2163-6-23**]) - No acute intracranial process.

CT cspine ([**2163-6-23**]) - No fractures and no malalignment. Moderate
denerative changes.

CT A/P ([**2163-6-23**]) - No acute process of the abdomen and pelvis
including no evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma. No splenic
injury and no left lower rib fractures. Small left pleural
effusion. Tiny small right pneumothorax and focus of mediastinal
air which could be explained by attempted line placement.

Echo ([**2163-6-24**]) - Poor image quality. The left atrium is
moderately dilated. The right atrium is markedly dilated. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably
mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %). There is no ventricular septal
defect. The right ventricular cavity is dilated The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild bileaflet mitral valve prolapse. An
eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of mild to moderate ([**1-16**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. At least mild pulmonary hypertension is
detected.There is no pericardial effusion.

CTA chest ([**2163-6-24**]) - Acute fractures of the left first through
tenth ribs, with some fracture displacement, with subjacent
moderate-sized left pleural fluid collection,likely containing
blood layering in the dependent portion. There is left lower
lobe collapse, and mild left upper lobe atelectasis. No
pneumothorax. No pulmonary embolus detected to the subsegmental
levels. No dissection.  Equivocal right 5th-7th rib injuries.
The right lung is clear.

CT torso ([**2163-6-25**]) - No evidence of active bleeding in the chest
or abdomen. Innumerable left-sided rib fractures and
questionable, right rib fractures as previously described. In
addition, there is a non-displaced fracture of the left clavicle
near the sternoclavicular junction. There is a lytic lesion in
the distal left clavicle adjacent to the aromioclavicular joint
which appears new from a radiograph in [**2163-5-15**] and is
concerning for a metastatic focus. Decreased attenuation in the
T4 vertebral body on the right may represent a second lytic
lesion. Continued atelectasis involving the left lower lobe with
left pleural effusion, not significantly increased from prior
and other, additionally described, chronic findings in the
abdomen, unchanged.

L shoulder R|XR ([**2163-6-26**]) - There is an acute fracture involving
the left distal clavicle extending into the AC joint. This was
not present on the prior study from [**2163-6-7**]. There is also
severe degenerative changes of the left humeral head with
spurring. There is a left-sided pacemaker. Moreover, there is
increased density to the left lung which may be due to
hemorrhage or pleural effusion which has increased since the
Chest CT scan


Brief Hospital Course:
[**6-23**]: Initial trauma workup in the ED including CXR, CT head, CT
c-spine, CT abdomen/pelvis did not show significant trauma and
the patient was admitted to medicine for workup for syncope. On
the SIRS team, the pati
