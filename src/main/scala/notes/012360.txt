Admission Date:  [**2167-4-30**]     Discharge Date:  [**2167-5-5**]

Date of Birth:   [**2093-9-26**]     Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73-year-old
female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, interstitial lung disease, end-stage renal disease
(on hemodialysis), moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis,
loculated pericardial effusion, and paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation who presents with a 2-day history of shortness
of breath.

The patient awoke on the day prior to admission with
shortness of breath.  He denied chest pain, nausea, vomiting,
fevers, and chills.  He went to a regular hemodialysis
session where her systolic blood pressure was low (down to
the 70s).  Her baseline systolic blood pressure runs in the
high 90s to low 100s.  The patient was given fluids, oxygen,
and was only dialyzed five or her usual seven kilograms.  The
patient was also instructed to hold her Coumadin for an
elevated INR of 7.3.

The patient returned home after hemodialysis and still felt
short of breath.  She felt her symptoms were stable and not
necessarily worse.  Later that evening, the patient started
complaining of palpitations.

The patient awoke on the morning of admission with persistent
shortness of breath, and upon her daughter's insistence was
brought to the Emergency Room.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient complains of chronic fatigue.
She makes minimal urine.  The patient was complaining of
feeling very hot and warm in the Emergency Department.  She
denied nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, chest pain, diarrhea,
melena, and bright red blood per rectum.  The patient was
supposed to get an outpatient stress echocardiogram; however,
this was cancelled secondary to the severity of her aortic
stenosis.

In the Emergency Room, the patient was found to be in rapid
atrial fibrillation with a heart rate in the 140s and a blood
pressure in the 60s to 70s.  She was given 75 mcg of Fentanyl
and 1 mg of Versed and cardioverted with 100 joules times
one. She converted to normal sinus rhythm with a blood
pressure in the 80s.  Vital signs at that time were
temperature of 97.4, pulse of 95, blood pressure of 78/52,
respirations of 20, satting 98% on 2 liters.  She had a
pulsus paradoxus measured at greater than 25 mmHg.  A bedside
echocardiogram was obtained which showed a large pericardial
effusion with right ventricular diastolic collapse.  The
patient was given 5 mg of vitamin K intravenously as well as
2 units of fresh frozen plasma for an INR of 8.8.  The
patient was also given 500 cc of normal saline bolus.  The
patient was taken urgently to the cardiac catheterization
laboratory for pericardiocentesis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with an FEV1
of 0.87 and FVC of 1.17 in [**2166-7-23**].
2.  End-stage renal disease (on hemodialysis for five years
with a left upper extremity arteriovenous fistula).
Echocardiogram in [**2167-3-23**] showed an ejection fraction
of greater than 55%, mild mitral regurgitation, a small
posterior pericardial effusion with loculation around the
atrium).
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
5.  Status post abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
6.  Status post cholecystectomy.
7.  Osteoporosis, status post thoracic vertebral fractures.
8.  Interstitial lung disease.
9.  Mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Renagel 800-mg tablets times 14
p.o. q.d., Nephrocaps 1 tablet p.o. q.d., Serax 25 mg p.o.
q.h.s., Coumadin 3 mg p.o. q.h.s. (on hold since [**2167-4-29**]).

ALLERGIES:  The patient is intolerant to CODEINE.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No prior tobacco history.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature of 97.4,
heart rate of 95, blood pressure of 79/52, respiratory rate
of 20, satting 98% on 2 liters.  In general, the patient was
alert and in no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and
throat revealed oropharynx was clear.  Cardiovascular
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  A 2/6
systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border.
Lungs with rales two thirds of the way up bilaterally.  The
abdomen was soft and nontender with normal bowel sounds.
Extremities were without lower extremity edema.  Left upper
extremity arteriovenous fistula with good bruit and a good
pulse.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on
admission revealed liver function tests were normal.  INR
of 8.8.  White blood cell count of 8.8, hematocrit of 33.4,
platelets of 311.  Chem-7 revealed sodium of 127, chloride
of 89, bicarbonate of 22, blood urea nitrogen of 21,
creatinine of 4.4, glucose of 158.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray showed marked cardiomegaly
consistent with pericardial effusion, possible small left
pleural effusion with congestive heart failure on background
of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diffuse
interstitial lung disease.

Electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm at 96 beats
per minute, T wave inversions in V1 through V3 (which were
old), intraventricular conduction delay.  No acute ST-T wave
changes.

Echocardiogram showed mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy, decreased rate and left ventricular systolic
function, at least mild aortic stenosis, trace aortic
regurgitation, large pericardial effusion with fibrin
stranding, thickened visceral pericardium overlying the right
ventricle, and right ventricular diastolic collapse.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was given intravenous vitamin
K and several units of fresh frozen plasma before proceeding
with urgent pericardiocentesis.  The patient had 700 cc of
bloody fluid drained.  Her right atrial pressure was 22
before drainage and decreased to 10 after drainage.  A
pericardial drain was left in overnight with minimal further
drainage.  It was removed the following day.

The patient's repeat echocardiogram showed normal left
ventricular size, normal left ventricular systolic function,
with a normal ejection fraction, mild right ventricular
dilation, depressed right ventricular systolic function,
small pericardial effusions with fibrin deposits on surface
of the heart with moderate effusion around the right atrium
with loculated component. No evidence of tamponade on
follow-up echocardiogram.

Post procedure, the patient's hematocrit decreased from a
baseline of 33 down to 24.  She was transfused 2 units of
blood, and hematocrit remained stable for the remainder of
her hospitalization.

As to the etiology of her pericardial effusion, it was
presumed to be secondary to hemorrhagic pericardial effusion
in the setting of an elevated INR.  Pericardial fluid had a
spun hematocrit of 33 and negative culture data.  It was
decided that in the setting of the patient's elevated INR and
recurrent bleeding risk that she would not be anticoagulated
for her paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  She was started on
amiodarone to help maintain a sinus rhythm.

The patient continued to receive regularly scheduled
hemodialysis without complications.  The patient was seen by
Physical Therapy who recommended a [**Hospital 3058**] rehabilitation
as well as possible need for home oxygen.  The patient's
oxygen saturations would decrease to 82% on room air with
activity.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged the patient to rehabilitation.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Serax 25 mg p.o. q.h.s.
3.  Nephrocaps 1 tablet p.o. q.d.
4.  Renagel 800-mg tablets 14 tablets p.o. q.d.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:   Hemorrhagic pericardial effusion in
the setting of elevated INR, status post pericardiocentesis.
