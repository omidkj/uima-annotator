History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 58 year-old right-handed woman with a history of
esophageal cancer who presented with acute onset slurred speech
and left sided weakness.

The pt was unable to offer a detailed history at the time of my
encounter.  Therefore, the following history is per EMS and the
pt's daughter.

Per the pt's daughter, she was just discharged from [**Name (NI) 5871**]
Hospital at about 4pm on the day of admission.  She had been
admitted there since past Thursday for a "rectal infection" and
dehydration.  Her daughter brought her home and she was
initially doing well.  At about 1820, per the daughter, she
started
"mumbling" but seemed to be aware of her surroundings and the
fact that she was mumbling.  She was seen to have a left facial
droop and was not moving her left side.  911 was immediately
called and she was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.

Code stroke was called at [**2050**] and Neurology was immediately at
bedside. NIHSS as follows:

1a. LOC: alert, responsive (0)
1b. LOC questions: knew age and name of month (0)
1c. LOC commands: closed eyes and gripped with right hand (0)
2. Best gaze: Right gaze preference (1)
3. Visual: Complete left hemianopia (did not blink to threat)
(2)
4. Facial Palsy: Total paralysis of left lower face (2)
5a. Left arm: No movement (4)
5b. Right arm: no drift (0)
6a. Left leg: Will only move toes, will not lift leg off of bed
(?)
6b. Right leg: Will only move toes, will not lift leg off of bed
(?)
7. Limb ataxia: absent (on right, unable to test left) (0)
8. Sensory: no sensory loss bilaterally (0)
9. Language: No aphasia (0)
10. Dysarthria: Severe (2)
11. Extinction/inattention: Neglects left side of space (2)

Total NIHSS: 13, but pt did not move either leg, so may in fact
be higher

The pt was unable to offer a review of systems.


Past Medical History:
-diabetes mellitus
-esophageal cancer, status post radiation and chemotherapy. Also
had feeding tube until about three weeks ago.
-asthma
-depression
-history of DVT, had been on warfarin until last week per
daughter


Social History:
Pt lives alone in [**Location (un) 1468**] and very much wants to go home.  She
is willing to go to rehab prior to return home.  As pt and I
were discussing this, screener from [**Hospital1 **] walked into the
room and spoke with pt about rehab.  Pt being screened by
various facilities.  Pt feeling that doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) **]'t understand
her strong wish to get home.  She is becoming frustrated with
long length of stay.
Pt has a son and a daughter who live relatively close by but
were not in to visit at the time of this conversation. Pt is
coping well but her patience is wearing thin.  Rehab screens may
help things move along for d/c.  Will meet with
family when they are in to visit with pt.

General: Lying in bed with eyes open
HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in
oropharynx

No adventitious movements noted.

-Sensory: No deficits noxious stimuli throughout. No extinction

weakness.

Radiologic Data:
CT head: There is no evidence hemorrhage.  There appears to be
slight loss of insular ribbon on the right, but no obscuration
of
the basal ganglia on that side.  I cannot appreciate a dense
artery sign.  The ventricles, cisterns, and sulci appear normal.

CT angio of the COW & neck: possible tapering of the R MCA just
prior to
the bifurcation. Heterogeneous area in the right lobe of the
thyroid, 7 mm. Recommend further evaluation of the thyroid via
ultrasound.

EKG [**10-21**]: Sinus rhythm. Old inferior myocardial infarction. Low
voltage in the precordial leads. Possible previous anteroseptal
myocardial infarction. No previous tracing available for
comparison.
   Intervals Axes
Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T
95 124 86 [**Telephone/Fax (2) 70094**] 2 -4

Head CT [**10-22**]: The exam is somewhat limited by motion. Again
seen is a rounded focus of hyperdensity in the right basal
ganglia consistent with hemorrhage. There is increasing
surrounding hypodensity and impression on the right lateral
ventricle. There is no hydrocephalus or shift of normally
midline structures. Fluid is again noted in the sphenoid
sinuses. Osseous structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Stable rounded focus of right basal ganglia
hemorrhage. Increasing surrounding hypodensity and mass effect
on the right lateral ventricle may represent edema related to
the hemorrhage or evolving right MCA infarct.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: Although there is considerable
motion artifact, there is evolution of the large right MCA
infarction since the earlier study of [**2150-10-22**]. There is no
evidence of new hemorrhage, but the infarction is largely
obscured by artifact, small to moderate amounts of bleeding
cannot be excluded

[**10-22**] ECHO: 1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial
septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color
Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.  2. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%).  3. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.  4. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.

[**10-23**] Abd CT: 1. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma. 2.
Bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis. 3. Ascites. 4.
Probable small nonobstructive right renal calculi.

[**10-23**] MRI/MRA brain: 1. Large right middle cerebral artery
infarction with sharp cut-off of the right MCA at its
bifurcation. Smaller infarcts in the left parietooccipital
watershed region and the left cerebellar hemisphere. The
infarctions are of acut
