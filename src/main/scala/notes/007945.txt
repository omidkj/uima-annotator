Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement. Elongated LA. Mild
spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the LA. No
thrombus/mass in the body of the LA. Moderate to severe
spontaneous echo contrast in the LAA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA
ejection velocity. No thrombus in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Dilated RA. A catheter or
pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD
by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size,
and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Suboptimal technical
quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Focal calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending
aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in ascending aorta. Focal
calcifications in ascending aorta. Simple atheroma in aortic
arch. Focal calcifications in aortic arch. Normal descending
aorta diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. Focal calcifications in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Severely
thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets. Critical AS (area
<0.8cm2). Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Tricuspid valve not well visualized. Mild to
moderate [[**2-10**]+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.
Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient. Left pleural effusion.
Conclusions
PRE BYPASS The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left
atrium is elongated. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in
the body of the left atrium. No thrombus/mass is seen in the
body of the left atrium. Moderate spontaneous echo contrast is
present in the left atrial appendage. No thrombus is seen in the
left atrial appendage. The right atrium is dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are
normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are focal calcifications in
the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is a left pleural effusion. There
is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was
notified in person of the results in the operating room at the
time of the study.

POST BYPASS The patient is being AV paced. There is normal
biventricular systolic function. Thre is a bioprosthesis in the
aortic position. It is well seated. The leaflets are not well
seen. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The maximum gradient
through the aortic valve is 27 mmHg with a mean gradient of 16
mmHg at a cardiac output of 3.2 liters/minute. The effective
orifice area is approximately 1.1 cm2. The tricuspid
regurgitation appears slightly improved - now mild. The thoracic
aorta appers intact. No other changes from the pre bypass
findings.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Transferred for surgical evaluation with known aortic stenosis
and coronary artery disease.  Underwent preoperative workup
including pulmonary function test, carotid ultrasound, and vein
mapping.  CT scan revealed esophag
