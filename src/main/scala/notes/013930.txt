This 64 year-old woman was involved in a MVC rollover on
[**2164-2-3**]. She was the passenger, ?restrained, with + airbag

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was evaluated in the trauma bay. She was found to have
multiple injuries including a subarachnoid hemorrhage, likely
diaphragmatic injury, R ankle and thumb fractures, R L5
transverse process fracture, and bilateral L1 transverse process
fractures. She was admitted to the trauma surgery service and
taken immediately to the OR for exploratory laparotomy. She was
found to have a L hemidiaphragm rupture with small bowel
ischemia. Repair of the diaphragm along with small bowel
resection and primary anastamosis was performed. She tolerated
the procedure well. The abdomen was left open and she was
transferred to the T/SICU. See operative note for details.
Neurosurgery was consulted for the subdural hemorrhage and
lumbar spine fractures found on CT scan. They recommended a
repeat head CT with no intervention being necessary at that
time. On the evening of hospital day 1/day 2, she was
persistently tachycardic with increasing FiO2 requirements.
Lactate was elevated at 4. A bladder pressure measured
30-35mmHg. A tentative diagnosis of abdominal compartment
syndrome was made and it was decided to take her back for a
second exploratory laparotomy. Ischemic small bowel was found
and she underwent small bowel resection x 2 followed by
temporary abdominal closure. She tolerated the procedure well
and was again transferred to the T/SICU. See operative note for
details. A repeat head CT also on hospital day 2 was stable over
the prior scan.

On hospital day 3 ortho was consulted for a right ankle fracture
found on secondary survey. Patient was again taken to the OR for
a third exploratory laparotomy. Again small bowel was resected
with a primary anastamosis, and the abdomen was closed
primarily. At the same time an ORIF was performed of her right
ankle. She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred back
to the T/SICU. Plastic surgery was also consulted for her right
thumb fracture again found on secondary survey. A CT scan of the
wrist demonstrated a right thumb [**Doctor Last Name 65097**] fracture as well as a
nondisplaced R distal radius fracture and a R trapezium
fracture. She was placed in a R thumb spica splint for these
injuries.

On hospital day 4 pt was transfused 2u pRBCs. She remained
intubated and sedated. She was started on TPN.

She continued to recover and it was attempted to wean the
sedation and ventilator. However, pt was not appropriately
arousable on hospital day 7, so a repeat head CT was performed.
This was stable over the prior head CTs.

Ventilator wean was continued slowly. On hospital day 9 she was
found to have a pneumonia and vanco/levo were started. Some
drainage was noted from the inferior aspect of the abdominal
wound, and on hospital day 10 this portion of the wound opened
and drained serous fluid. The wound was packed with wet to dry
dressings.

On hospital day 15 she was extubated successfully and on
hospital day 16 she was transferred to the surgical floor. She
continued to recover and was stable for discharge on hospital
day 19. She will need acute rehabilitation for her orthopaedic
injuries. She will follow-up with trauma surgery, plastic
surgery, and orthopaedic surgery as instructed.

L diaphragmatic rupture, s/p repair
R medial malleolar ankle fracture, s/p ORIF

Discharge Condition:
stable

Discharge Instructions:
Take medications as prescribed. Keep all follow-up appointments.
You should wear the R arm splint and R leg bivalve cast at all
times; they can be removed for bathing/showers but the R foot
incisions must remain clean/dry/out of the water.

The abdominal staples have been removed, but there is still a
small area at the bottom of the wound that is open. This area
should be packed with a wet to dry gauze changed three times a
day. It is ok to let water run over this area as long as the
gauze is changed immediately after, but the area should not be
soaked in water.

Call your doctor or return to the ER if you experience:
-chest pain or shortness of breath
-fevers or chills
-nausea/vomiting/inability to pass gas or stool
-increased pain/red
