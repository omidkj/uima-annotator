History of Present Illness:
87 year old, Cantonese-only speaking female with CAD and
cardiomyopathy who intially presented to her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2140-10-24**] for
a routine physical, found to have sodium 119, admitted here on
[**10-25**], hospital course complicated by worsening mental status,
discovered C4 fx and sub-dural hematomas and now with melena.
.
The patient's daughter, (pt's primary caregiver at home), notes
the pt has been progressively confused for the past ~2 months.
She used to be able to walk with a cane but for the week prior
to admission, was more "wobbly" and had fallen and struck her
mouth on the ground 1 week ago because she lost her balance
while walking to the bathroom without LOC.
.
During [**Hospital **] hospital stay, there was initial concern for cauda
equina syndrome as she had urinary retention and decreased
rectal tone with some decreased strength. Neuro and NeuroSurgery
was consulted and had multiple imaging studies including
ultimately an MRI spine showing C4 fracture, (she is in
C-collar) and no evidence of cauda equina. Head CT also showed
sub-dural hematomas. Patient was noted to be hyponatremic on
admission c/w SIADH on admission, possibly due to
hygroma/subdural bleed, started on fluid restriction and NS, and
repeat urine lytes with UNa < 10 consistent with pre-renal
etiology. Sodium has been trending up and on day of transfer to
MICU was 129.
.
Late on [**10-27**], pt noted to have melenic stool. Previously she
had been guaiac negative. NG lavage performed and ?very small
amount of clot that cleared quickly. Hct on [**10-25**] 24 --> 18 on
[**10-27**] at 11p.m. She was transfused 4 units and Hct increased to
39.7 (?real). 2 - 20 gauge iv placed, protonix [**Hospital1 **] started and
GI consulted. No urgent need for EGD especially given pt's C4 fx
and in a C-collar. Pt HD stable throughout although now unable
to state her name which she was able to do on admission.
Neurosurgery was to be contact[**Name (NI) **] about this issue and whether
contraindicated to remove collar. On [**10-27**], BUN increased from
26 to 51, creatinine from 0.6 to 0.8 and renal was consulted
given SIADH, worsening mental status and concern that she may be
becoming uremic. In retrospect, the BUN rise may have been due
to GI Bleed.
.
In MICU, the patient's GI bleeding resolved and her mental
status improved. Her hyponatremia was improving on fluid
restriction. Given that her mental status was improving, she was
transferred to [**Hospital1 1516**] service for continuing care.

.
CXR: Lungs clear. Heart size normal.
.
Non contrast Head CT [**10-26**]: Small left greater than right
subdural hygroma versus chronic hematoma. There are prominent
prefrontal extra-axial spaces with no evidence of collections.
There perceived slight
hyperattenuation is felt to be due to beam hardening artifact.
There is no mass effect. There is mild generalized brain
atrophy.
.
CT C-spine [**10-26**]:
1. Acute versus chronic right-based retropulsed C3-C4 disc
and/or hematoma with cord compression. A chronic disc herniation
is most likely, however (see above report).
2. Minimally displaced fractures through the right transverse
process extending through the vertebral foramen at C4. MR C
spine is recommended.
.
MR C/T spine [**10-27**]:
1.  Mild canal stenosis at C3-4 associated with posterior disc
bulge, but no signal abnormality in the cord to suggest
significant compression.  The disc bulge is most likely due to
degenerative change, with no signal abnormalities at C3-4 disc
identified or any adjacent osseous structures.
2.  T2 hyperintense focus adjacent to the right side of the
spine, at the T11 level, of unclear significance.  Correlation
with clinical factors is recommended, as the appearance could
suggest subtle presence of fluid.
3.  Known fractures involving the right vertebral artery foramen
of C4 not well demonstrated on this study, probably because of
technical factors.
.
MR L spine :
1)  No evidence of significant compression of the conus,
although multilevel degenerative changes are present, including
mild spinal stenosis, and left-sided mild neural foraminal
narrowing at L3-L4 and L4-L5. This appearance is consistent with
degenerative changes.
2)  Questionable presacral fluid or edema, based on mildly
increased signal on T2-weighted imaging.
.
MRA Neck [**10-27**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute injury,
including at the site of clinical concern involving vertebral
foraminal fractures of C4. Bilateral carotid stenoses, and a
probable short narrowing of the left vertebra at C4-C5 with
slight post-stenotic dilatation.
.
CXR [**10-28**]: A thin bore nasogastric tube ends in the mid stomach.
Lungs clear. Heart size normal. Thoracic aorta tortuous and
calcified but not dilated. No pleural abnormality or evidence of
central adenopathy.
.
TTE [**10-28**]: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
