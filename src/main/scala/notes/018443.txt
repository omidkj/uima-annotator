History of Present Illness:
68 year old male with history of Asthma, OSA, DM type 2,
hypercholesterolemia, Parkinson's, mental retardation, s/p
stroke with residual lt sided weakness began having malaise,
tiredness/weakness and trouble walking which began on [**6-21**].  The
patient was taken to see his PCP who diagnosed him with a UTI by
UA and started him on Cipro.  On [**6-23**] the patient began to have a
cough, non-productive, which was treated with albuterol.   From
[**Date range (1) 135**] the patient had increasing difficulty breathing, nasal
congestion and chest congestion.  He had increased cough but
non-productive, he was given Mucinex.  On [**6-26**] he began having
persistent cough until he became SOB, temp to 102.  Albuterol
relieved SOB but group home concerned re: fever, persistent
weakness and SOB so he was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
  In the ED he was placed on CPAP with great improvement in
sats, got ceftriaxone and levofloxacin for PNA.  A CTA was
performed which showed bilateral PEs.  He was started on Heparin
drip.

CXR:
IMPRESSION:
1) Mild congestive heart failure.
2) Interval increase in right lower lobe opacity, consistent
with effusion. Underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.
3) Left lower lobe opacity, atelectasis versus early pneumonia.

CTA:
bilateral pulmonary emboli
right base atelectasis, also left but smaller
lymphadenopathy in mediastinum
pneumobilia as seen on previous studies

Brief Hospital Course:
68 year old male with Parkinson's s/p stroke with lt sided
weakness, asthma, OSA, SM2, hypercholesterolemia, presents with
two days of acute SOB and fever to 102.

Brief hospital course, by problem:
1. Hypoxia: He was started on Heparin drip and transferred to
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further moniotring, where he remained hemodynamically
stable and was started on coumadin. He was transferred to the
floor on HD 2.  His hypoxia was thought secondary to new
bilateral PE, in combination with hx of R. partial lobectomy,
bronchitis, OSA on cpap, and a new layering effusion on the R.
side. Had micu reevaluation on [**6-28**] secondary to worsening
hypoxia (ABG was 7.38/61/60 on 80% FM) and CXR with evidence of
worsening effusion on right with ?mucus plug/collapse. We added
flagyl for coverage of possible aspiration and gave 20 IV lasix
(with resultant 1L out). Repeat CXR the next day showed
improving effusions after diuresis with lasix 20 IV x 1.  He was
diuresed further with standing lasix 20 po x 2 days.  This was
discontinued once euvolemia was acheived and as he had improving
lung exam and a normal EF (60%). He was on vancomycin for one
day for coag positive cocci in [**1-19**] bxcx bottle, but as he was
without leukocytosis or fever, we suspect that the positive
blood culture bottle was a contaminant and the vanco was d/c'd.
A speech and swallow eval was done [**6-29**], which showed no
evidence of aspiration, so flagyl was also d/c'd.  He was
titrated back to 3 liters NC oxygen although he does continue to
have occasional bouts of desaturation to mid 80's if not sitting
properly, or if nebs or chest PT are missed.
We maintained q4 nebs, aggressive chest PT, levofloxacin.
Heparin was discontinued after coumadin was therapeutic x 24h.
He appears slowly improving.
