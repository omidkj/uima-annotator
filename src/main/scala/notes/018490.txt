Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5810**]
Chief Complaint:
C. diff diarrhea, abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy
Exploratory Laparotomy


History of Present Illness:
73 yo F with hypertension, asthma and newly diagnosed PUD and
Crohn's and multiple recent admissions for persistent diarrhea
and abdominal pain who is transferred from [**Hospital3 25357**] after presenting [**2153-7-25**] with abdominal pain and
diarrhea again and found to have C.diff colitis without
improvement on vancomycin and metronidazole.
.
Patient was initially admitted [**Date range (3) 90587**] at [**Hospital3 25357**] with abdominal pain, diarrhea and fever though to be
secondary to infectious gastroenteritis treated with
metronidazole and levofloxacin x 14 days.  Stool cultures were
negative.  Also found to have peptic ulcer disease on EGD
(duodenal and prepyloric ulcer - reportedly large and deep) and
started on PPI (biopsies negative for H.pylori or malignancy and
revealed benign gastric antral type mucosa with chronic
superficial gastritis and lymphoid folicular formation with
foveolar hyperplasia per discharge summary [**2153-7-30**]).
.
Hospitalized again at [**Hospital1 189**] from [**Date range (1) 90588**] with RLQ
abdominal pain, early satiety and weight loss.  CT on admission
showed thickening of cecum and ascending colon concerning for
inflammatory versus infectious colitis.  Also showed heavy
calcified plaque at the origins of the celiac artery and SMA.
Gastroenterology was consulted, colonoscopy performed [**2153-7-13**]
and per discharge summary consistent with Crohn's disease
(biopsy per [**2153-7-30**] discharge summary was negative for
malignancy but showed inflamed granulation tissue with foreign
body giant cells).  Started on mesalamine.  Stool studies
negative for infection (negative c.diff and O/P per discharge
summary).  Of note, last colonoscopy was in [**2151**] but incomplete
study due to anatomy.  Discharge summary from [**2153-7-14**] does not
mention antibiotics however discharge paperwork from today
references that patient was treated with ciprofloxacin and
metronidazole (patient unable to recall).
.
Patient re-presented to [**Hospital6 204**] on [**2153-7-25**] with
diffuse abdominal cramping (acute on chronic), rigors, low grade
fever, diarrhea and poor po intake with relative hypotension to
100/70.  Her labs were significant for leukocytosis of 21.5K.
Patient was started on high dose methylprednisolone,
levofloxacin and metronidazole for presumed Crohn's flare.
C.diff was positive in the stool (per discharge summary, no
results reported) and methylprednisolone was discontinued
(unclear when d/c'ed). CT abdomen and pelvis on [**2153-7-29**] was
obtained which showed inflammatory changes in the colon
unchanged from [**2153-7-10**].  Also showed subacute infarcts of spleen.
 Heme/onc was consulted which recommended MRI or doppler
ultrasound to rule out splenic vein thrombosis.  Hypercoagable
work-up significant for low protein C activity.  Given that
patient continued to have abdominal pain, poor po and diarrhea
and white count has not improved, decision made to transfer to
[**Hospital1 18**] for second opinion.
.
Patient reports she continues to have diffuse ache-like
abdominal pain with sitting and intermittent sharp periumbilical
pain (which is new x 3 days).  Continues to have 3-4 episodes of
watery non-bloody diarrhea per day which she states has been
going on for months.  Reports very poor po intake due to lack of
appetite and bad taste in mouth.  Endorses weight loss however
unable to quantify (Atrius note states 28 lbs since [**Month (only) 116**]).  No
nausea or vomiting.  No fever or chills.  No history of blood
clots.  Denies history of a.fib.
