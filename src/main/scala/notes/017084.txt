Chief Complaint:
Hemoptysis, Thrombocytopenia, Hypoxia

plasmapheresis

History of Present Illness:
81 year old male emergently transferred from [**Doctor Last Name 38554**]
Hospital, with hypoxia, thrombocytopenia with concern for TTP
vs. DIC. Patient presented on [**7-5**] to AGH with 3 days of cough
and hypoxia; as he has a known COPD diagnosis, he was initially
assumed to have a COPD flare although he notes this was not
typical of his exacerbations.

On arrival in the ED, he was noted to be markedly hypoxic in the
80's with an oxygen requirement. A subsequent ABG 7.41/40/46/82%
reported to be on Face Mask. He was seen by Pulmonary with
concern for a pneumonia, so levafloxacin was started. Chest
X-Ray there showed pacemaker, old rib fractures, RUL infiltrate
with concern for hilar mass. An abdominal US was performed which
was normal.

An echocardiogram was performed which was significant for
mod-severe mitral annular calcification, borderline concentric
LVH, trace TR, LVEF 60%.

Since admission he has had a slowly increasing oxygen
requirement. He was therefore started on high-dose IV
corticosteroids. He was subsequently noted to be having some
mild hemoptysis. He also developed echymoses all over his body,
and CBC was notable for marked thrombocytopenia, with initial
platelet count at 93. On day of transfer his platelets had
fallen to 15. He denies recent fevers, although may have felt
cold recently.

On arrival to the floor at [**Hospital1 18**] he was noted with marked
hypoxia, arriving on 10L facemask with SAO2 < 90%, which rapidly
progressed to 100%NRB requirement. He proceeded to have
hemoptysis of a large clot (10cc). ICU consultation was urgently
obtained.

Preliminary Report !! WET READ !!
large right mid lung airspace opacity concerning for pneumonia,
overall
increased opacity of right lung. unilateral hemorrhage, edema
less likely.
left lung clear. d/w dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] 6pm [**2178-7-11**].



Brief Hospital Course:
81yo gentleman with h/o COPD who initially presented with
shortness of breath now transferred to the ICU with anemia and
thrombocytopenia concerning for TTP.

1. Thrombocytopenia: Pt was transferred emergently on [**7-11**] from
OSH following an admission for presumed COPD exacerbation.
Concern for DIC vs. TTP and hematology consult obtained.
Plasmapheresis catheter was placed in the ICU and emergent
plasmapheresis started.  HIT abx sent, platelet transfusion held
for <10K.

2. Hypoxia, Hemoptysis: Pts respiratory status worsened and he
required 100% NRB with desats to 88% while talking.  Chest x-ray
showed opacity in RML concern for hemorhage vs mass.  Pt was
moved to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for respiratory decompensation.  In the early
morning of [**7-13**], the patient??????s clinical status deteriorated
rapidly with the development of acute renal failure, altered
mental staus, worsening hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia.
Respiratory status was tenuous with the patient only maintaining
saturations in the 80??????s to 90??????s on 100% nonrebreather.
Oxygenation status did not improve with nebulizer treatments.
The patient became tachypnic and desaturated.  No escalation of
care was provided according to the patient??????s clearly expressed
wishes of DNR/DNI status.  The patient went into cardiopulmonary
arrest and was declared deceased at 11:30 am on [**2178-7-13**] after
checking for pulses, corneal reflex and heart sounds.  The
family was contact[**Name (NI) **] and at this time has deferred decision for
autopsy.

hospital
