Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1234**]
Chief Complaint:
Bilateral lower extremity ischemia.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
B/L CIA stents, Right EIA stent
Mediastinoscopy
Lung Cancer


History of Present Illness:
49 y/o homeless male with history of severe PVD, DM,
alcoholism, and COPD who was transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital
on [**10-3**] for management of RLE ulcer and cellulitis.He has
undergone  iliac stent placement (b/l CIA, R EIA) with an
extended PACU course  However his pre-operative work-up reveled
two opacities in the LUL. The more superior opacity is the
denser
of the two measuring approximately 2.5 x 1.3 cm.  Just inferior
to this, is a less dense more ill-defined area of spiculated
opacity, measuring 1.7 x 1.4 cm.  The patient has undergone a
full staging work-up with cervical mediastinoscopy, that
revealed
to evidence of malignancy in the nodes, a PET scan that revealed
FDG avid disease only in the LUL and a head MRI that was within
normal limits.  The initial plan was to have him undergo a LUL
lobectomy. However, given his poor pulmonary function, thoracic
surgery does not feel that he is a good candidate for resection.

Therefore, oncology was consulted to help with non-surgical
management.


Past Medical History:
PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 3100**] reports having "PTSD" and
sees Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 29306**] [**Name (STitle) 69038**] (p. [**Telephone/Fax (1) 69039**]) at [**Location (un) **]
Counseling Ctr.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 69038**] prescribes Ritalin 60 mg daily and
Seroquel 600 mg daily for the patient, which he had been taking
up until just a few weeks before coming into the hospital.  It
was not clear why he was taking these medications.  He says of
his traumatic childhood, "I was 6 [**1-30**] when my sister and I
returned from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital after having our tonsils out,
and
there was a surprise. My old man blew his head off. There was a
trail of blood. He was cold and [**Doctor Last Name 352**] on the bed in the master
bedroom."  He says that his childhood was rough and implied
physical abuse by some, but not all members of his immediate
family.  A brother reportedly broke his back and on another
occasion both shoulders by holding his hands behind his back
until "he would give" when he was 8.5 years old.  At that time
he
thought about suicide, but never since, by his report.

He denies nightmares, flashback or hypervigilance.  Of his
"PTSD"
he alludes to his childhood and says that sometimes he "will see
something on the boob tube that will make me freeze up."  The
last time that he had suicidal ideation was at 8 yo.

He says, "I don't have paranoia. ...I've never had audio or
visual hallucinations."  He mentions a time when he would tape
conversations with his sister to have a record of their
exchanges, although it was not clear why he was doing this
(?paranoia of some sort).  Mr. [**Known lastname 6203**] does have a h/o DMH
services, at least suggesting some more chronic mental illness.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Information was limited.  Per Mr. [**Known lastname 6203**], he
grew up in [**Hospital1 1474**] in a troubled home, the youngest of several
siblings.  Pls see Past Psych Hx above for add'l detail.  He
went
to vocational school in Southern [**State 1727**], learning to be a
engineering/technical drafter and worked for the Navy "running
ships."  He did not actually serve in the military.  He married
his girlfriend of 10 years, but the marriage only lasted 9 mos.
They divorced because of his drinking and her spending problems
and a disagreement on having children. He has no children. He is
no longer in touch with any family or friends, although he
reportedly has a brother who lives in the area.  He said his
sister lives in [**Name (NI) 61361**] CO.  He says that he does "get along with
people," citing nursing staff as an example.  He lived in a
boarding house until 1.5 years ago when he "got the boot" but
declined to elaborate, getting angry when inquiry was made.  He
has been living in his care since then.  Social work notes
indicate that his mother perhaps died sometime around one year
ago.
