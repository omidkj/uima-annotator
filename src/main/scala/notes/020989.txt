History of Present Illness:
76 y/o F with hx of ischemic colitis with R colectomy, carotid
endarterectomy, CAD s/p CABG, COPD, and DM who presented to AJH
on [**5-21**] with abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. Initially, she
had a CT scan on presentation which was interpreted as ischemic
colitis. Her WBC was 16. She was started on zosyn. In the ED,
she was hypotensive and admitted to the ICU where she was fluid
resuccitated and treated conservatively with TPN and bowel rest.

.
On [**5-23**], she was started on steroids for COPD exaccerbation and
with diuretics for possible CHF exaccerbation. Her breathing
improved. She was continued on the above management with zosyn
and supportive care. Her hemodynamics stabalized and she was
admitted to the floor.
.
On [**5-31**] she was noted to be more lethargic. She had a relative
bandemia and her zosyn was switched to imipenem, levaquin and
vanco. A c.diff was checked and was positive. Her antibiotics
were stopped and she was switched to IV flagyl and PO vanco. She
again stabalized on the floor.
.
On [**6-9**] She was noted to have melena. Her baseline hct of around
30 had trended down to 19.3. The trend was 31 --> 30.2 --> 28.6
--> 25.1 --> 19.3. She then had a endoscopy via GI which
revealed a duodenal clot concerning for ulcer vs. aorto-enteric
fistula. She had her hct checked again at 5 pm which was stable
at 19.5 She then received her first blood transfusion after that
hct check because she had been a hard cross-match due to
antibodies. She received a second unit while en-route here. On
arrival, she was T 98.0, BP 115/57, P 115, R 20, 98% on RA. She
denied abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath,
chest pain, dizziness, lightheadedness. She felt generalized
weakness and pain in her bilateral legs all over, consistent
with arthritic pain.

Imaging: [**5-21**] CT abd/pelvis:
Thickened colonic bowel is noted from the distal transverse
colon to the sigmoid colon with slight stranding elements along
the periphery and areas of fre fluid.  A colitis from ischemic
could be in the differential.  No free air.
.
[**5-25**] CT abd/pelvis:
Definite improvement in the areas of thickening of the colon in
the left hand side since [**5-21**].  It has not completely resolved.
Grafts extending from the aorta into both common iliac arteries,
unchanged.
.
[**5-27**] KUB:
Gaseous distension of small and large bowel loops diffusely with
slight dilation of the descending colon.  Findings are more
likely on the basis of diffuse ileus pattern.
.
[**5-29**] KUB:
Interim placement of NGT with tip in upper to mid gastric body.
No significant change in the probable ileus.
.
[**5-31**] KUB:
No improvement in the probably ileus, s/p removal of NGT.
.
[**2156-6-2**] Colonoscopy:
Significant colitis in L side of colon, could be consistent with
ongoing ischmemic colitis now with chronic changes.  Alternately
could be pseudomembranous colitis due to C.diff.  There was no
black bowel or through-and-through intestingal ischemia
appreciated during this study.
.
[**6-9**] Endoscopy: (per written note)
Normal esophagus and stomach.  No blood.  In duodenal bulb there
was a large clot with adherent white material that was shiny and
plastic-like in appearance.  On the opposite side of the
duodenal bulb, there was a non-eroded kissing lesion (not
bleeding).  The endoscope was not advance, photos taken.
.
RUE U/S:
[**2156-6-14**]: Nonocclusive thrombus in the right axillary vein.
Likely
thrombus also seen in the right basilic vein.

[**2156-6-15**]:
Slight interval progression in degree of nearly occlusive
thrombus within the right axillary and basilic veins.


Of note, CT of [**5-25**] reviewed with radiologist and GI attending,
re-read as inflammation in the duodenal bulb/head of the
pancreas.  The aortobifemoral graft is infrarenal and 8 cm away
from the bulb.  Recommended transfer to tertiary care center.


Brief Hospital Course:
76 y/o F with hx of ischemic colitis, CAD, PVD, afib, COPD and
DM who is presenting with new UGIB concerning for possible
aorto-enteric fistula.
.
# UGIB: The pt experianced a Hct drop from 30 to 19 over the
course of 2 days at an OSH. She had melena and an endoscopy
concerning for duodenal ulcer vs. aorto-enteric fistula, less
likely tumor or impacted foreign body. Her Hct on transfer was
19.3. She was s/p 1u PRBCs at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and had 1 unit
hanging in transfer. A CTA abd was performed and did not reveal
an aorto-enteric fistula. On Admission, she was continued on a
protonix gtt and GI
