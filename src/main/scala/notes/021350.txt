CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest and epigastric burning.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old
Italian-speaking male with a history of coronary artery
who presented as an outside hospital transfer from
burning which awoke him from sleep; but with no associated
symptoms of shortness of breath, diaphoresis,
lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, radiating pain. He arrived
pain free with an electrocardiogram taken.  He was
noted to have wide complex tachycardia, monomorphic.  He
converted spontaneously to atrial fibrillation but reverted
back to ventricular tachycardia.  Amiodarone was loaded on
tachycardia acceleration from 120s to 170s which decreased
after amiodarone was stopped.  He spontaneously converted
back to atrial fibrillation with ventricular rates in the 70s to
80s.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (Past Medical History includes)
1.  Coronary artery disease; status post inferior myocardial
infarction in [**2163**].
2.  Congestive heart failure.
3.  Atrial fibrillation.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Adrenal insufficiency.
6.  Chronic renal insufficiency.
7.  Status post cerebrovascular accident.
8.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease versus asthma.
9.  Status post right ureteral stent.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d., Coumadin,
Monopril 20 mg p.o. q.d., Aldactone 25 mg p.o. q.d.,
glyburide, diltiazem 240 mg p.o. q.d., Hydrocort, Florinef,
digoxin 0.125 mg.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a nonsmoker.  He lives with
his family and is minimally ambulatory.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   Review of systems was positive for
dyspnea on exertion.  He denies any paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea or orthopnea.  He has approximately three to four
admissions per year for decompensated heart failure.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Blood pressure was in
the 100s, heart rate was 60 and irregular, respiratory rate
was 22, oxygen saturation was 98% on 4 liters.  In general,
the patient was lying comfortably at 30 degrees and was
alert.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat revealed right eye
was reactive and round to light.  A nonreactive left pupil.
The mucous membranes were moist.  The oropharynx was without
exudate.  The neck was supple.  No jugular venous distention
at 30 degrees.  Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
No wheezes, rhonchi or rales.  Cardiovascular examination
revealed first heart sound and second heart sound, irregular
rate.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdominal examination
revealed bowel sounds were present.  Soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  No guarding, tenderness, or rebound.
Extremities revealed no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratory data
revealed white blood cell count was 11.8, hematocrit
was 35.9, platelets were 265.  Sodium was 134, potassium
was 4.9, chloride was 100, bicarbonate was 23, blood urea
nitrogen was 33, creatinine was 1.7, blood glucose was 249.
PTT was 40.8, PT was 24.7, INR was 4.3.  Digoxin level
was 0.9.  Creatine phosphokinase was 87, troponin I was 8.3.
Urinalysis was cloudy, large blood, 100 protein, 250 glucose,
small leukocyte esterase, greater than 50 red blood cells,
moderate bacteria.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Electrocardiogram revealed wide complex
monomorphic ventricular tachycardia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was started on an aspirin
per day as well as Lipitor 10 mg.  His cardiac enzymes were
followed which revealed a peak troponin of 9.7 and trended
down thereafter.

The patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for
continuous observation for ventricular tachycardia.  The
patient experienced two events of ventricular tachycardia;
lasted approximately 8 to 10 seconds and was asymptomatic
without any hemodynamic compromise.

On hospital day five, the patient was taken to the
Electrophysiology Laboratory and proceeded to have
ventricular tachycardia ablation.  He remained in stable
condition thereafter and was suitable for discharge to home.
After much discussion with the patient family the decision was
made not to implant a cardioverter defibrillator as the patient
did not want to have this done and as it was felt unlikely to
prolong his life or improve his quality of life.

2.  RENAL:  The patient has baseline chronic renal
insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.7.  It was
noted that his creatinine slowly rose throughout his hospital
admission to a peak of 2.2.  He ACE inhibitor was held, and
Urology was consulted with regard to evaluating his right
ureteral stent with regard to possible ureteral obstruction;
which they did not feel was the cause of his elevation in
creatinine.  His creatinine started to trend down.  His ACE
inhibitor was restarted, and he was to be sent home on his
original blood pressure medications and was to follow up with
his urologist (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 10643**] at [**Hospital3 1196**] for
possible stent removal.

3.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was noted to have
supratherapeutic Coumadin levels.  His Coumadin was held, and
he was started on heparin for his atrial fibrillation.  He
was restarted on his Coumadin prior to discharge and was to
follow up with his primary care physician for further
monitoring of his PT and INR levels.

4.  ENDOCRINE:  Upon arrival, the patient was started on
stress-dose steroids, Solu-Medrol 40 mg q.6h., and was
switched back to his original regimen of Florinef and
Hydrocort prior to discharge.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:   Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge status was to home.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:  Follow-up appointments with his primary
care physician in three to four days to follow therapeutic
Coumadin levels.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Ventricular tachycardia; status post ablation.
2.  Myocardial infarction.
3.  Chronic renal insufficiency.
4.  Adrenal insufficiency.
5.  Supratherapeutic anticoagulation.
