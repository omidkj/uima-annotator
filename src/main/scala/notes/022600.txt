Date of Birth:   [**2045-9-22**]     Sex:  F


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Bilateral leg cellulitis,
myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, type 1
diabetes.

1.  Eczema.
2.  Type 1 diabetes for 30 years with no neuropathy,
nephropathy or retinopathy.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Hypothyroidism.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
was 115, blood pressure was 148/88, respiratory rate was 16,
oxygen saturation was 94% on room air.  General appearance
revealed an elderly woman, lying on a stretcher, in no acute
distress, very pleasant and quite articulate.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose, and throat revealed extraocular movements were
intact.  Pupils were not reactive to light.  The right pupil
had an oval shape.  The mucosa were moist.  The oropharynx
was clear without any lesions.  The tongue had a fissure with
white spots in it.  The neck was supple.  There was one 2 X 1
palpable node in the right submandibular space which was
rubbery and mobile. There was no supraclavicular
lymphadenopathy.  The thyroid was not palpable.  The lungs
were clear to auscultation bilaterally with wheezes in the
left lower lobe.  No rhonchi.  No crackles.  Heart was
tachycardic in the low 100s.  A regular rhythm.  Normal first
heart sound and second heart sound.  There was a 2/6 systolic
murmur.  The abdomen was distended, soft, nontender, with
active bowel sounds.  No masses.  Extremities revealed legs
were swollen, erythematous, and warm bilaterally below the
knees.  There was clear fluid oozing from the calves, and
small ulcers over the left shin secondary to scratching.
There was 2+ pitting edema.  Skin revealed there was
erythema, pustules, and dry skin over the thighs but no
swelling or increased warmth.  There were also erythematous
spots and pustules all over the body.  Neurologically, alert
and oriented times three.  Cranial nerves II through XII were
intact.  There was some mild impaired sensation over the
medial aspects of the feet bilaterally.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on
admission revealed a white blood cell count of 11.7,
hematocrit was 35.2, platelets were 421.  Chemistry-7
revealed sodium was 140, potassium was 5, chloride was 108,
bicarbonate was 25, blood urea nitrogen was 36, creatinine
was 0.8, blood glucose was 146.  Urinalysis revealed more
than 300 protein, nitrite negative, leukocyte esterase
negative.  Creatine kinases cycled every eight hours were 57,
45, and 75.  Troponin I was 2.4, 2.5, and 2.8.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Electrocardiogram showed  a regular
sinus rhythm; and no changes from the previous
electrocardiogram from [**2120-4-25**].

Electrocardiogram on [**2120-6-25**] showed sinus tachycardia,
normal axis and intervals, a 1-mm ST elevation in leads V2
and V3.

A chest x-ray on [**2120-6-25**] revealed bilateral pleural
effusion and a right middle lobe opacification.

A chest x-ray on [**2120-6-29**] revealed interstitial and
alveolar edema, bilateral pleural effusion.  No new
inflammatory infiltrates, and no pneumothorax.

Cardiac echocardiogram on [**2120-6-24**] showed severe focal
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with apical
biventricular dysfunction; consistent with multivessel
coronary artery disease or other defuse process with an
ejection fraction of 25% to 30%.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   Ms. [**Known lastname 22917**] is a 74-year-old woman with
type 1 diabetes for 30 years and eczema who is now presenting
with a 2-week to 3-week history of worsening erythema and
swelling over the legs.  The erythema first started in the
right leg, and over the two days prior to the date of
admission she noticed worsening swelling, erythema, and
copious weeping from the skin.  She denied any pain but
admits that the feet were so swollen that she could not wear
shoes comfortably.  She denied any previous episodes of
cellulitis, but her daughter disagreed and recalled one
episode of cellulitis that required antibiotics.  She denied
any fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria,
urinary frequency, chest pain, or shortness of breath.

Ms. [**Known lastname 22917**] admitted that she scratches her skin a lot because
of unbearable pruritus and added that her medications have
not been very helpful in controlling the pruritus.

The bilateral leg edema, swelling, and erythema was found
consistent with leg cellulitis.  She was admitted for
treatment of the cellulitis and was started on Ancef 1 mg
intravenously every 12 hours.  A urine culture was also sent
which was negative, and two sets of blood cultures were sent;
the results of which were still pending.

The bilateral leg cellulitis improved rapidly on Ancef, and
after two days of intravenous antibiotics Ms. [**Known lastname 22917**] was
switched to Keflex p.o. which she was to continue for 14
days.

On the second day of her hospitalization, she developed acute
shortness of breath.  She was treated with furosemide
intravenously with no improvement.  An electrocardiogram was
repeated which showed sinus tachycardia.  No ST-T wave
changes, but a 1-mm upsloping of the ST waves in V2 and V3.
A chest x-ray was obtained which showed new bilateral pleural
effusions with the one in the left being larger than the one
in the right, and opacities suspicious for consolidation or
infiltrates in the left lower lobe and right middle lobe.
Ms. [**Known lastname 22917**] became increasingly tachycardic and tachypneic.
Her oxygen saturation dropped rapidly, and she required 100%
nonrebreather to maintain an oxygen saturation of 92%.  She
was still alert and awake, but talking with difficulty.

An arterial blood gas was obtained which showed a pH of 7.24,
a PCO2 of 52, and a PO2 of 69 on the 100% nonrebreather.
Ms. [**Known lastname 22917**] was evaluated by the Medical Intensive Care Unit
team and then transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
Her acute shortness of breath was attributed to either
congestive heart failure, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, or
myocardial infarction.  She was empirically started on
levofloxacin, Flagyl, and ceftriaxone for treatment of
possible pneumonia.  Diuresis was continued with furosemide
for treatment of the congestive heart failure.  A heparin
infusion was stared until the patient could undergo a CT
angiogram.

As soon as she became stabilized, a CT angiogram was obtained
which revealed no pulmonary embolism, but bilateral large
pleural effusions with atelectasis and collapse of the lower
lobe.  Cardiac enzymes were cycled to rule out a myocardial
infarction.  When the results of the CT angiogram were
obtained, the heparin infusion was stopped.  Creatine kinases
were cycled every eight hours were 54, 99, and 75.  Troponin
was 1.5, 3.5, and 3.8.  The increase in troponin and the
changes in the electrocardiogram suggested that the patient
had a silent myocardial infarction which probably led to the
congestive heart failure.  Ms. [**Known lastname 22917**] was successfully
diuresed with furosemide.  The shortness of breath resolved
over 24 hours.  She did not require intubation.  The
bilateral wheezes also resolved with diuresis.  She was
started on Lovenox which was continued for 72 hours.  She was
on aspirin, Plavix, Lipitor, metoprolol, and she was
continued on Losartan, and all of her previous medications.

After a 36-hour stay in the Intensive Care Unit, she was
returned to the General Medicine floor where the beta blocker
and Losartan were titrated to achieve maximum control of her
heart rate and blood pressure.  The rest of her hospital
course was unremarkable.  She was discharged on [**2120-6-30**].
