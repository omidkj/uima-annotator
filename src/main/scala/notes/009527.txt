Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
63yo F with h/o smoking, pulmonary HTN diagnosed in [**2189**],
transfered from [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] for futher workup of pulmonary HTN
including R heart catheterization. Pt states she was in her
usual state of health when polycythemia was noted on her labs at
annual physical exam in [**Month (only) 547**] or [**2189-5-24**], leading to a
workup in which she was diagnosed with pulmonary HTN. She had
noted some dyspnea on exertion prior to that time but was
generally active and not bothered by her symptoms, which she
associated with her past smoking history. PFTs showed moderate
obstructive airway disease with severely reduced DLCO; CT showed
apical bullous emphysema as well as basilar pulmonary fibrosis.
In [**8-/2189**], she reports starting home O2 that she has required
constantly since then. She reports starting Spiriva and
Symbicort around that time. Her condition worsened subacutely in
[**12/2189**], when she was found to have low blood pressure at an
outpatient visit and admitted to the hospital for a week.
She was readmitted about 3 weeks ago with 3-4 days of worsening
dyspnea and some lethargy. On admission, she had a WBC of 15 on
prednisone and was on 3L O2 with a sat of 76%. Her sat improved
on CPAP, although it was difficult for her to tolerate. She was
treated for a possible PNA with antibiotics
levofloxacin/vancomycin (completed 14 day course) and also
received solumedrol. Her sats have usually been 91-93% on a 50%
venti mask, although she desats with anxiety. She was treated
with an insulin sliding scale for new hyperglycemia in the
setting of steroids. She received diltiazem during the admission
but it was held [**2-23**] for SBP 80s which responded to a 500 cc
bolus. Pt had an episode of urinary retention, with placement of
a foley 3 days ago.
Pt reports sore throat, nasal congestion, and cough productive
of sputum that was initially dark brown (weeks ago) and is now
yellowish. She denies pleuritic chest pain, fevers/chills, and
palpitations although she notes occasional panic attacks.
+constipation.

Past Medical History:
hyperglycemia--first noted on current admission in the setting
of steroids, pt has been on insulin sliding scale as inpt
Pulmonary HTN as above, R sided heart failure.

Social History:
 Lives with daughter in [**Name (NI) 1411**], used to work in home decor until
economy crashed. Was able to walk comfortably, climb stairs
prior to diagnosis. Smoked [**1-26**] pack per day for "many" years,
quit smoking 2.5 years ago, denies history of EtOH and illicit
drugs.

Family History:
Both parents died of MI, brother has a defibrilator. One uncle
had pulmonary disease with a history of asbestos exposure.

CXR [**2190-2-24**]
Small contiguous thick septated radiolucency seen at the bases
consistent with pulmonary fibrosis. Larger pattern of
radiolucency is seen in
the upper lung fields consistent with emphysema. Pulmonary
vasculature and
interstitium is consistent with heart failure. Prominence of
pulmonary artery
is consistent with pulmonary hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 63y/o lady with pulmonary hypertension of
unknown etiology, with subacute worsening of her dyspnea, who
was transfered after 3 week admission to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] for
further workup of pulmonary HTN.  She had increasing O2
requirements and complained of worsening dyspnea throughout her
stay.  She was uncomfortable lying flat, and did not undergo
right-heart catheterization.  She eventually required 100% NRB,
and then non-invasive ventilation with PEEP and 100% FiO2 in
order to maintain oxygenation.  Her labs and ABGs suggested
respiratory fatigue and systemic ischemia (rising lactate;
antibiotics were started in case this represented sepsis).  A
family meeting was held with the patient and her family; she had
a significant risk of mortality from CPR and intubation, and
might possibly never be able to be weaned from a ventilator in
the setting of her bad emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis, and
pulmonary hypertension.  Patient and family decided to decline
intubation and her management was shifted towards
comfort-focused care.  She expired with family at the bedside.
