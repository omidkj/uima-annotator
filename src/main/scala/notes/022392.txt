Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Hay fever / sensitive to sedation

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o female with a history of systemic amyloidosis (Kidney,
autonomic, presumed heart), Aortic stenosis, CHF, IDDM, and
frequent falls [**12-20**] autonomic dysfunction presenting to the
emergency department with brief episode of syncope admitted to
the ICU for tachycardia.

This morning, the patient was using the commode and was getting
back to the bed.  The daughter witnessed that the patient LOC
for about 30 secs and caught her.  No fall occurred.  There was
no bowel/stool incontinence, tongue biting, jerking movement.
Patient was not thought to have confusion like post-ictal state.
 She cannot recall if she has any numbness/tingling or focal
weakness.  Currently she has generalized weakness and some chest
discomfort but not pain/tightness.

Had an admission [**7-/2154**] for syncope/fall, including an episode
concerning for possible seizure with post-ictal state.  MRI
brain was negative for infarct or hemorrhage.  EEG showed no
seizure. Her lasix was uptitrated during that admission.
Cardiology was consulted and thought that if patient has dCHF
from amyloid that avoiding fluid shifts would be important.
Patient has f/u with cardiology in [**Month (only) **].  Patient was sent to
rehab for about 3 weeks given the left humerus fracture.

Patient just returned home from rehab yesterday.

On arrival to the ED  97.7 130 87/63 16 96%/RA. Given
ceftriaxone for presumed UTI. CT head and chest xray negative.
Started IV heparin for presumed PE. Received 10mg IV diltiazem
which dropped pressures to 80s systolic for presumed afib with
RVR. Felt to be high risk for PE. Heme negative brown stool.
Mentating with daughter at bedside.

In the ICU, vitals are 98.3, 124, 87/61, RR 21, O2 sat 98% on
RA.  Daughter states that patient is normally on midodrine and
BP has been low.  It used to be in the 100-110 about a year ago,
but her normal over the last month or two has been in the upper
80s-90s.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o female with a history of systemic amyloidosis (Kidney,
autonomic, ? heart), aortic stenosis, CHF, T2DM on insulin, and
frequent falls [**12-20**] autonomic dysfunction presenting to ED with
fall and admitted to MICU for tachycardia. Patient and family
initially decided to transition from aggressive care to home
hospice, and plans were made to dicharge patient with home
Hospice on [**9-14**]. Patient died on the evening of [**9-13**].

ACTIVE ISSUES:

1. Atrial fibrillation: Hypotensive on arrival with rate 130s.
Initially thought to be regular, but on further review of the
EKGs from the ED, it seems that patient has been having
irregular borderline narrow complex tachycardia, which is more
consistent with atrial fibrillation.  Patient does have
underlying structural heart disease and suspected amyloidosis of
the heart, which can make her more prone to having conductive
abnormalities, such as the 1st/2nd/3rd degree block,
intraventricular conduction delay, AF, A flutter, and even
ventricular tachycardia.  TSH was only mildly elevated in
[**Month (only) **], making hyperthyroidism less likely the cause of the
AF.  Patient is a non-alcohol drinker.  Clinical exam and CXR do
not suggest significant volume overload or infectious etiology.
CHADS2 score is 3.  ED had concern about PE and started heparin
gtt empirically pending VQ scan (unable to get CTA chest given
CKD), although clinical suspicion of PE is low based on her
[**Doctor Last Name 3012**] criteria is low prob. A TEE with cardioversion was planned
for [**9-13**]. However, after discussion of goals of care with
patient and her three daughters, the decision was made to avoid
further invasive procedures and discharge patient home with home
hospice on [**9-14**]. Patient died on the evening of [**9-13**].

2. Syncope: Symptoms were primarily concerning for underlying
arrhythmia given tachycardia on admission, but orthostatic
hypotension was also high in the differential given patient is
on midodrine due to underlying autonomic dysfunction. An acute
coronary syndrome was considered as was high sensitivity to
volume status due to underlying cardiac amyloidosis. A seizure
was felt to be less likely given differences between current
presentation and prior seizure and given that patient has been
on keppra as an outpatient. Keppra was continued.

3. Elevated troponin. Patient had elevated troponins that were
likely due to demand in the setting of tachycardia and CKD.
Could also be secondary to amyloidosis. Patient was continued on
ASA and simvastatin and placed on telemetry. Goals of care were
transitioned to Hospice as above.

4. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Patient's baseline
creatinine in last 2 months has been low 2.0's from mid to high
1's in [**2152**]. A renal biopsy in [**3-/2154**] was positive for
amyloidosis. The acute elevation was most likely due to
progression of amyloid vs. prerenal azotemia, possibly in the
setting of low perfusion (low BP) and poor forward flow (AF).
Patient received IVF bolus (500cc) in the ED. Per renal, c/w
cardiorenal syndrome + poor forward flow (sodium avid per
urine).

5. dCHF, no evidence of acute exacerbation.  Given likelihood of
amyloid cardiomyopathy and the potential sensitivity to fluid
shift, fluid status was monitored closely. Her baseline weight
is about 163 lb per the daughter but more recently has been 175
lb.

6. T2DM, on insulin.  Last HgbA1C 6.8. Patient was initially
continued on home lantus and ISS.

7. Autonomic dysfunction.  Baseline SBP now in the upper 80s to
90s per family despite being on midodrine. Midodrine was
continued.

8. Hypothyroidism.  Last TSH 4.6. Now 9. Most likely subclinical
at this time. Patient was co
