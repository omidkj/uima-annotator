Pertinent Results:
results:
cath [**3-17**]: 1.  Selective coronary angiography of this co-dominant
system
demonstrated a three vessel CAD.  The LMCA had mild disease.
The LAD
was diffusely diseased with a 90% mid vessel stenosis.  The LCx
had an
80% mid vessel stenosis.  The RCA had an 80% mid vessel stenosis
with a
possibel thrombus, as well as a distal 80% stenosis.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed a moderate systemic arterial
systolic
hypertension with an SBP of 141 mm Hg.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
.
[**3-19**] echo:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
focal severe hypokinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls
and distal septum. The remaining left ventricular segments
contract normally. Right ventricular chamber size is normal with
? focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall (clip #[**Clip Number (Radiology) **]). The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is top
normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

transferred to the ICU in critical but stable condition on
epinephrine and neosynephrine. He was extubated and weaned from
his epi by POD #1. He was weaned from his neo and transferred to
the floor on POD #2. He was seen by renal and dialyzed as prior
