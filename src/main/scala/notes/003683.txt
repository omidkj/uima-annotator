History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79-year-old right-handed man with a history
of Left CEA on [**2199-11-12**] who presents with acute onset language
impairment, found to have a left occipital hemorrhage. The
history begins on the weekend before [**Holiday 1451**], about 3 weeks
prior to this. He was at that time driving alone on the [**Location (un) 81675**]
and went off the road. Apparently, it's thought that he lost
consciousness, causing him to lose control. When EMS found him,
he was awake, but reportedly "confused" and has no memory of the
events for several hours after the event. Based on this, he was
apparently diagnosed with a TIA. In the work-up for the TIA, he
was found to have 98% stenosis of his right carotid and at least
90% of the left. He underwent RIGHT CEA shortly thereafter, and
had a LEFT CEA performed on [**2199-11-12**], both at [**Hospital1 **].

After this second CEA he was doing well except for some
constipation. This afternoon, he told his wife he was not
feeling
well (not further elaborated on) and went quickly to the
bathroom. He apparently had a bowel movement, but was in the
bathroom for a while. His wife called for him, but initially got
no answer. He then flushed the toilet and came out of the
bathroom on his own, but said nothing to his wife, only [**Name2 (NI) 27723**]
at her. His wife believes he did not understand what she was
saying to him, as he was not doing as she asked. She led him to
bed. She noted that he was "wobbling" back and forth, but did
not
run in to anything. She called her daughter, his doctor, and
then
EMS.

EMS found his initial BP in the field to be 240/110. He was
taken
by EMS to [**Hospital1 **], where a head CT showed a hyperdensity in
the
left occipital lobe about 1 cm x 0.5 cm, surrounded by
hypodensity. HIs maximum BP was 270/150, and he received 10 mg
labetalol. He was seen by a neurologist, who noted right eye
deviation and thought he was having a seizure, so the pt
received
Dilantin 1.6 g IV. He developed "son[**Name (NI) 7884**] respirations" and was
intubated, receiving Ativan 0.5 mg, Etomidate 20 mg/Succ 80
mg/Lidocaine 100 mg/Vecuronium 12 mg at [**2100**], 2 mg Versed, and 2
mg Morphine. After administration of all this medication, his BP
dropped into the 80s systolic, coming up when propofol was held
for a few minutes.

In our ED, he received propofol gtt and Tylenol 650 mg PR for
fever to 101.4.

Formal ROS is not possible; per his wife, he was not complaining
of anything other than constipation

MRI brain with and without contrast: Markedly motion degraded
study. Subacute hematoma in the left occipital lobe with mild
leptomeningeal enhancement which may reflect hyperemia secondary
to subacute hematoma. No convincing underlying mass lesion is
noted; however, recommend followup imaging after resolution of
acute blood products for better assessment.

CTA head with and without contrast: No convincing evidence for
an AVM. There is very slight hyperemia in the region of the
prior hemorrhage. Recommend attention on followup imaging.
Irregularity and diminutive appearance of the basilar artery may
reflect a combination of atherosclerotic disease and fetal type
PCA distribution on the left.

ECHO: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity
size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is a very small inferolateral pericardial effusion without
evidence for hemodynamic compromise.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular
cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic
function.

EEG: This is an a
