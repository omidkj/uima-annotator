Chief Complaint:
ICH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation

History of Present Illness:
74 y/o male with unclear [**Name (NI) 3262**] who presents with massive ICH.
Per report, seemed to be in USOH until this evening when he
developed an occipital HA with L sided weakness and nausea.  He
called EMS, then developed left arm pain which concerned him for
an MI so he took aspirin.  When EMS arrived, he was given 500ml
NS and zofran, then quickly decompensated.  He was taken to
[**Hospital3 **] where he was intubated and had a head CT that
showed massive ICH.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for Nsurg
evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial VS were:  60, 16, 201/67, 100%vent. CT showed
CT head with 3.6 cm intraparenchymal hemorrhage around the left
basal ganglia. Also intraventricular hemorrhage and the lateral
ventricles, third ventricle and fourth ventricle. Extensive
subarachnoid hemorrhage filling the cisterns causing mass effect
in the mid brain and pons. 4 mm midline shift.  Neurosurgery was
consulted who felt this was a massive ICH with no chance for
recovery and no intervention was indicated.  He was admitted to
the MICU due to being intubated.

findings as this injury is irreversible and lethal. Neurosurgery
met family to discuss grim prognosis. Shortly thereafter, care
was redirect towards comfort. Patient passed away at 0225.
