Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1055**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
rigid bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
46 y/o F with a history of severe asthma on home O2, diastolic
heart failure and IDDM who presented with increasing shortness
of breath.  Per ED and EMS reports, the pt. was at home on the
day of admission and began to develop progressively worsening
dyspnea unresponsive to her nebulizers.  She apparently became
concerned and called EMS.  Upon arrival to the ED, she was very
lethargic and became progressively obtunded.  She was given
albuterol with little effect and when a chest xray was performed
and was consistent with failure, she was given 40mg of IV lasix
with some response.  Her initial ABG showed respiratory acidosis
with severe hypercapnia and hypoxemia.  She was initially placed
on CPAP but due to her continued respiratory distress, she was
intubated and placed on a ventilator.  She was transferred to
the MICU for treatment of respiratory failure.

Previous work-up at [**Hospital1 112**].  PFTs [**1-17**] showed FVC 45%, FEV1 26%,
ratio 55%, TLC 55% predicted.  Echo [**2100**] showed preserved LV
size and function.  P-MIBI [**12-18**] showed EF 65% with mild
inferior hypokinesis and inferolateral wall reversible defect.
H/o multiple admissions to [**Hospital1 112**] for COPD flares, most recently
[**12-21**].  Intubated in MICU and elective trach in [**2099**], now
removed.  At home patient reported to be on 4Lnc O2 and BiPAP
15/5.  Also with poorly controlled DM, A1c as of [**12-21**] 9.8%.
Acidemic at baseline and chronic CO2 retainer with baseline PCO2
90-100 per [**Hospital1 112**] reports.

MICU:
1. Hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure: The pt. was
admitted to the MICU with respiratory failure.  Prior to
transfer from the ED, she was intubated and placed on
ventilatory support.  Over the course of the next two hospital
days, the pt's arterial blood gases showed decreased hypercapnia
and improved arterial oxygenation.  Accordingly, the ventilator
was weaned to pressure support.  On hospital day #3, although
there was no cuff leak, she was successfully extubated without
incident.  She had occasional coughing fits post-intubation
thought to be due to laryngeal spasm, but maintained good oxygen
saturation.  She was also diuresed as treatment for right sided
CHF.  Echocardiogram showed EF >60%, mild symmetric LVH; focal
wall motion abnormality could not be excluded d/t poor study.
She is to follow up for PFTs [**2103-2-2**], and for outpatient sleep
study.

2. IDDM: The pt's blood sugar was well controlled initially on
an insulin drip in addition to half her dose of glargine while
she was not taking POs and intubated.  She was eventually
transitioned to a regular insulin sliding scale on hospital day
2 and placed back on her full dose of glargine once she was
extubated and taking full POs.

Past Medical History:
1) asthma on home O2, history of multiple intubations and
tracheotomy in [**2099**]
2) restrictive lung disease from obesity
3) psychotic disorder NOS
4) IDDM on glargine and metformin
5) obstructive sleep apnea on BiPAP at home (15/5 on 4L oxygen)
6) coronary artery disease: MIBI [**12-18**] showed LVEF 65% w/ mild
inferior hypokinesis and reversible defect in inferior wall and
mid to basal inferior lateral wall
7) vitamin B12 deficiency on monthly injections
8) s/p appendectomy
9) chronic lumbar disc disease

Social History:
The pt. lives at home with her niece and niece's 3 yo daughter.
There is a smoking history but frequency and duration uncertain.
 No clear history of alcohol or illicit drug use.  Mainly stays
at home.

Family History:
Unknown.

[**2103-1-27**] CXR: There is an ET tube in satisfactory position.
There is an NG tube extending into the stomach. The heart is
mildly enlarged. There is vascular congestion with perihilar
haze consistent with CHF, slightly improved from the prior exam.
There may be small bilateral effusions. There is no definite
pneumonia.
----
[**2103-1-28**] CXR: The heart is mildly enlarged. There is mild
vascular congestion with perihilar haze, however degree of CHF
has improved since the prior exam. There is no focal pneumonia
or large pleural effusion.
----
[**2103-1-28**] TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.  Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial
effusion.
----
[**2103-2-1**]:Airway CT
IMPRESSION:
1) Marked narrowing of the trachea at the level of the thoracic
inlet, with deformity of the tracheal cartilage. The area is
further narrowed at dynamic breathing. These findings are
suggestive of focal tracheal stenosis, with component of
malacia, associated with disruption of tracheal cartilage, most
likely due to prior intubation.
2) Fullness in glottic region which may reflect a component of
glottic edema.
3) Scattered atelectatic changes of the bilateral lungs.
4) Addendum can be issued to report when 3d reconstruction
images become available.
ADDENDUM:
3D external rendering image confirms focal tracheal stenosis.
