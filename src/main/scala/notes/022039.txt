Brief Hospital Course:
1. Neurology: Patient presented with acute parietal CVA. Initial
question of possible embolic source, given patient with
new-onset atrial fibrillation. Echo performed showed no
vegetation.  Patient given aspirin, bp was monitored. Carotid
doppler study performed and normal.  Patient remained aphasic,
only intermittently following commands.  His neurologic status
slowly deteriorated, thought to be due to neurologic insult and
concurrent infection.

2. Bradycardia:  Patient found to have bradycardia. Patient
monitored in ICU setting. Patient's HR improved and remained
stable in 60-70.  Patient was normally on b-blocker which was
held.  Seen in-house by cardiology.

3. Patient with CAD: S/P MI and two stents. We evaluated for
possible mi.  Patient kept on asa, B-blocker held given
bradycardia.

4. Respiratory Distress - In-house patient experienced episode
of respiratory distress. Xray demonstrated pneumonia vs. volume
overload. Patient initially started on abx to cover for
aspiration pneumonia.  Was given lasix for gentle diuresis.  Was
briefly on bipap, which he did not tolerated.  Per further
discussion with family, it was decided that patient would not
wish intubation or other aggressive measures, and he was made
DNR/DNI.  He was given morphine for his respiratory distress.

5. Endocrine: FS QID/ISS. Note was made of high TSH. Patient was
given synthroid.

6. Code Status - Patient's neurologic status was poor at
admission, and worsened over the course of the hospital stay, as
did his respiratory status.  His neurologic outcome was felt to
be poor, as per the neurology team.  Following a discussion with
the family, and notation of patients own wishes prior to stroke,
in the context of the prognosis given by the neurology team,
goals of care were changed to comfort / DNR / DNI.  He was
called out to the floor.  He was started on a morphine drip for
his pain.  Patient expired at 0500, with his daughter at the
bedside.  His family, and attending were notified.
