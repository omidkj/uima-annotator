History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness:
.
26 yo man D +278 after single cord transplant for hypoplastic
MDS with h/o persistent pancytopenia thought to be [**3-20**]
myelosuppression from CMV + antivirals who is now admitted for
sepsis.
.
Patient was first diagnosed with with MDS in Fall [**2136**] when he
presented with pancytopenia. Initial MDS course was complicated
by mucor infection of the tongue with prolonged ICU course for
upper airway obsturuction, followed by pericoronitis as well as
perirectal abcess. Was subsequently managed with a single cord
transplant on [**2137-6-24**] with reduced intensity Flu/MEL/ATG
conditioning. Post transplant course c/b VRE + Coag neg staph
bacteremia [**6-/2137**] (treated with dapsone); CMV viremia [**7-/2137**],
c.diff infection [**10/2137**] (treated with 14 days oral vanc),
admission on [**10/2137**] for low grade temperature attributed to +CMV
viremia with prolonged IV ganciclovir --> oral Valgancyclovir
course; last admission 10/4-6 for neutropenic fever, CT chest
showed non specific minimal peribronchial ground-glass opacity
in the left lower lobe, treated with course of levofloxacine;
Saw ID [**12-12**] Valgancyclovir was stopped as CMV viral loads
remained negative since [**10-22**], was started on valacyclovir for
HSV/VZV PPx. He also continues oral Posiconazole for mucor and
monthly pentamidine nebs for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] (most recent [**12-28**]).
.
Patient had > 97% donor on chimerism on peripheral blood from
[**2137-10-17**]. He has been intermitently leukopenic and neutropenic
throughout his illness with especially low white counts
generally ranging around 1000-3000 during the past 2 months.
This has been attributed to possible BM supression by CMV and/or
antiviral meds. Thrombocytopenia has been continous throughout
his illness and latley stable at ~ 25,000. Hct generally in the
high teens to low twenties. He also had had a stable
transaminitis for months which is attributed to drug effect +/-
hemochromatosis. Finally he is thought to be at low risk for GVH
and thus stopped immunosupressive meds in [**2137-9-16**] (was on
tacrolimus prior).  Last neupogen was given on [**2138-3-27**].
.
Over the past several months, he has had recurrent PNAs and has
been followed in pulmonary clinic.  In [**Month (only) 404**] he was found to
have fever and neutropenia and worsening tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities,
particularly in
the left side.  He was treated with meropenem, azithromycin and
oseltamivir.  Repeat CT chest on [**3-4**] showed some resolution and
he was most recently seen in pulm clinic on [**2138-3-20**].  During this
visit he was in the midst of being treated for another pulm
infection with moxifloxacin.
.
Today pt called clinic because he reported feelings of malaise
and nausea and noted that he had a low grade fever.  He went to
clinic and was found to have a fever of 103, Bp in 80's
systolic, HR of 140.  He was started on meropenem and vancomycin
and started on maintenance fluids at 150cc/hr.  WBC were 4.1
with 80%N.

on [**2137-6-24**] with reduced intensity Flu/MEL/ATG.
-Last chemo: Tacrolimus [**2138-10-5**], which was stopped after
