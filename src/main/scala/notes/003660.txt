Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7055**]
Chief Complaint:
Elective cardiac catheterization

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization [**2198-11-22**]
R femoral artery pseudoaneurysm repair [**2198-11-23**]
IVC filter placement [**2198-11-25**]


History of Present Illness:
 Ms. [**Known lastname 1924**] is a 62 year-old woman with a history of CAD s/p
NSTEMI in [**9-25**] who presented for catheterization on [**11-22**] and
who is now being transferred given worry for hematoma and
bleeding.
.
After NSTEMI in [**9-25**], she underwent cardiac catheterization
which a 90% stenosis of the LMCA and a 70% proximal RCA lesion.
On [**2197-10-20**] she underwent CABG x 3 with a LIMA to the LAD, SVG to
the OM and SVG to the RCA. Post operatively she had atrial
fibrillation and was started on Amiodarone. In addition she
developed a MRSA sternal wound
infection/high grade MRSA bacteremia and on [**2197-11-25**] she
underwent exploration of the sternal wound and sternal
debridement. Two days later she underwent sternal debridement
and bilateral pectoralis flaps.
.
Approximately 6 months prior to admission, she began to notice
that 4-5 minutes into her walks she would have to stop because
she was gasping for breath. She has also noticed similar
symptoms while doing her water aerobics, at times with
associated chest discomfort.
.
A stress test was done on [**2198-11-13**] and revealed apical ischemia
and septal hypokinesis with an LVEF of 61%. Given this, she was
referred for cardiac cath. On [**2198-11-22**] she underwent cath which
showed patent grafts. A POBA was done to the LAD.
.
Post-cath she had a failed mynx with pressure held. At
approximately 6pm, she moved her right leg and felt an acute
onset of groin pain. She was given a percocet, after which she
felt nauseated. After evaluation by the interventional fellow,
decision was made to transfer her to the CCU for observation.
.
On review of systems, she reports a history of prior [**Date Range **] in [**2182**]
at which time she experienced left facial numnbess/tingling. No
interventions were performed and this has not recurred. Also
reports bleeding after a tubal ligation when she was 25
year-old. She denies any deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary
embolism.
.
She has chronic joint pains, mostly in her knees and elbows.
Denies any hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denies
recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional buttock
or calf pain. Reports 20 pound weight gain over last 3 months;
for this she was evaluated for hypothyroidism and started on
replacement. All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

Sinus rhythm. Anterolateral ST-T wave changes. Consider
myocardial ischemia.
