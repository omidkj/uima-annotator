History of Present Illness:
67 year-old male with CHF (EF 45%), diabetes mellitus, atrial
fibrillation on warfarin presented to outside hospital after a
fall, with malaise and a left heel wound. He denies loss of
consciousness on his fall or head strike and reports being on
the floor for one hour. He was admitted to outside hospital [**8-3**]
where he was found to have temperature of 101F, left heel stage
3 decubitus ulcer with drainage (he was treated with clindamycin
for 1.5 weeks prior to admission), INR 17, WBC 29, Total Bili
>4, Alk Phos 240, and RUQ ultrasound showing gallstones,
thickened gallbladder wall, and normal CBD.

Vitamin K 10 mg IV given for INR 17. He had debridement of his
left heel ulcer on [**8-4**] at bedside with course complicated by
Proteus bacteremia.  He also had cholecystitis and a
percutaenous drain was placed [**8-4**]. His course was further
complicated on [**8-4**] by hypotension with SBP in 70's, confusion,
and unresponsiveness.  He received IV fluids, levofloxacin, and
2 units PRBC and 1 unit FFP.  On [**8-5**], he was transferred to the
[**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP evaluation and admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] ICU.

[**Hospital1 18**] ICU Course:
In ICU, received Zosyn and Vanco.  Patient has been
hemodynamically stable.

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI and chronic bilateral lower extremity sensory
neuropathy, chronic bilateral vision loss, occasional shortness
of breath from heart failure, chronic bilateral lower extremity
weakness -- left leg more than right from prior strokes.
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denies cough or wheezing. Denies chest pain, chest
pressure, palpitations, or weakness. Denies nausea, vomiting,

         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.

RADIOLOGY:
RUQ ultrasound [**8-4**]: Gallbladder distended with numeous
gallstones with diffuse gallbladder wall thickening 4mm. Pain in
RUQ. Dx of cholecytitis. No biliary duct dilation. Liver WNL,
Spleen NL. Ascites tiny along inferior edge of liver.
.
CXR [**8-5**]: Pulmonary edema, an underlying infectious infiltrate
cannot be excluded.
.
ERCP [**8-7**]:
Normal biliary tree (sphincterotomy).  Evidence of a
percutaneous cholecystostomy tube was seen in good position.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 67 yo man with CHF, Afib, DM2, decubitus heel ulcers,
recent cholecystitis c/b proteus bacteremia s/p cholecystostomy
and ERCP with sphicterotomy, s/p left guillotine BKA now s/p
revision L BKA.  Hospital course complicated by poor nutrition
and citrobacter sepsis.

#Acute Cholecystitis complicated by Proteus Septicemia: Pt was
admitted to OSH with presentation of acute cholecystitis and
underwent cholecystostomy that was complicated by proteus
septicemia of suspected biliary source. There was concern for
choledocholithiasis given history of gallstones and elevated
total bilirubin.  He was transferred to [**Ho
