Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8404**]
Chief Complaint:
acute renal failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] F w/ dementia, AF on coumadin, CHF and UVJ obstruction s/p
percutaneous nephrostomy on right with recurrent UTIs who
presented to an OSH with malaise and found to have acute renal
failure with creatinine of 6.2 and K of 6.6. Patient was sent
from her nursing home to OSH as she was feeling weak and had a
positive UA which was checked given her history of recurrent
UTIs. At OSH, patient was treated initially with IVF and
cefotaxime and vancomycin for a grossly positive UA in the
setting of a WBC of 35.5 and a history of pseudomonal and gram
positive UTIs. She was also given kayexelate, calcium gluconate,
10 units of insulin and an amp of D50 for her hyperkalemia with
improvement of her potassium to 5.6.
.
Pt made approx 200cc of UOP in foley overnight with IVF. The
following day there was no UOP from the percutaneous nephrostomy
and CXR showed volume overload with new O2 requirement. There
was concerned about giving additional IVF given her state of
volume overload. She was seen by nephrology who recommended
transitioning antibiotics to vanc and ceftaz (unclear if she
ever received a dose of this) and felt there was no acute
indication for dialysis. Also recommended renal ultrasound,
which per report showed a new atrophic kidney, and changing her
catheter, which she typically changes every 3 months. As urology
was unable to do procedures at [**Location (un) 620**] and the patient likely
will need a percutaneous drain exchange as soon as possible, she
was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. Vitals
prior to transfer were T98.8, BP:122/82 HR:86 RR:16-20 O2Sat:
92% on 2L.
.
In the MICU, patient is awake, alert and pleasant. Denies any
current complaints.
.
On ROS, patient denies confusion, dizziness, diarrhea, nausea,
vomiting, back pain, chest pain, abdominal pain, itchiness and
shortness of breath.

MICRO:

STUDIES:
[**2161-1-25**] CXR: There is cardiomegaly. There is a left retrocardiac
opacity and likely small bilateral pleural effusions which are
new since the [**2158-3-30**] study. Some streaky opacities within the
upper lung fields, which may be due to chronic changes. A
right-sided pigtail catheter is seen in the upper abdomen.
.
[**2161-1-25**] RENAL U/S: The right kidney is 7.4 cm in size and the
left kidney is 12.2 cm. The right kidney contains a nephrostomy
tube which appears to terminate in the region of the right renal
pelvis. There is no evidence of right hydronephrosis. The left
kidney is normal in echotexture, though is notable for multiple
punctate areas of echogenicity near the corticomedullary
junction, possibly calcified arcuate arteries, or crystals.
There is no hydronephrosis. Doppler evaluation of both kidneys
is technically extremely limited as the patient is slightly
tachypneic and unstable to hold her breath. The urinary bladder
is collapsed around a Foley catheter.
IMPRESSION: Limited Doppler assessment. There is no evidence of
hydronephrosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo F with history of R UVJ obstruction s/p nephrostomy tube
placement in [**2156**] c/b recurrent pseudomonal UTIs, AF on
coumadin, HTN, and [**Hospital **] transferred from OSH with acute renal
failure in the setting of UTI.
.
Patient was admitted to the MICU with acute renal insufficiency
with a creatinine of 5.6 at OSH from her baseline of 1.0 and
anuria. She was not symptomatic from her uremia and was only
mildly volume overloaded requiring 2 L supplemental oxygen, so
there was no indication for emergent dialysis. She underwent
renal ultrasound which showed an atrophied right kidney and no
hydronephrosis bilaterally, consistent with priors. Renal was
consulted and felt that in the setting of her known vascular
disease, AF with subtherapeutic INR, and extremely elevated LDH
her presentation was most consistent with renal infarct of her
left kidney (her only previously functioning kidney). Patient
declined CT of her abdomen and pelvis as well as angiography.
She was continued on vancomycin and switched over to renally
dosed cefepime for her UTI given her known history of
pseudomonas.
.
A meeting was held with Mrs. [**Known lastname 62716**], her healthcare proxy and
son [**Name (NI) **], and her daughter in law. Given her history of
recurrent hospitalizations and medical complications, a decision
was made to transition her to comfort care. The family agreed
that antibiotics will not be offered, she will not be
resuscitated, and invasive procedures and labs will be stopped.
They understood this and agreed to this plan. The family was
pleased with the care she has received to this point, but it is
clear that she no longer wants to have uncomfortable measures
and admissions. The antibiotics were stopped and she was
discharged to inpatient hospice.
