CXR PA/Lat [**2189-3-19**]: The patient is status post CABG with median
sternotomy. Note is made of cardiomegaly. Thoracic aorta is
tortuous. Again, note is made of mild congestive heart failure,
associated with bilateral effusion and patchy atelectasis.
IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly with mild CHF, small pleural effusion
and patchy atelectasis.

CXR AP [**2189-3-20**]: Upright AP chest: The patient is post-median
sternotomy. There is stable cardiomegaly, and the aorta is
tortuous. Heart failure persists and is possibly mildly
worsened, with slightly increased central edema and [**Last Name (un) 16765**]
lines. There is a left pleural effusion. In addition, there is
worsening opacity of the left lower lung zone consistent with
pneumonia.

ECG [**2189-3-19**]:  Atrial fibrillation, Left axis deviation -
anterior fascicular block.  Possible old septal infarct,
Inferior/lateral ST-T changes may be due to myocardial ischemia
or left ventricular hypertrophy, Repolarization changes may be
partly due to rhythm, Left ventricular hypertrophy

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 89 year old man with a history of coronary artery
disease, congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation who
presented with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and was found to have
hypotension, pneumonia and a urinary tract infection.

For his community acquired pneumonia, he was given ceftriaxone
and azithromycin.  Prior to discharge, the ceftriaxone was
discontinued and will be discharged on five more days of
azithromycin.

For his urinary tract infection, he was found to have a positive
UA with nitrites, leukocyte esterase, +blood) but urine culture
was negative.

His nausea/vomiting/diarrhea was likely due to a viral
gastroenteritis. O&P, fecal cultures for campylobacter, e.coli
0157:H7, yersinia, cholera and c.diff were negative.  O&P noted
the presence of charcot-leiden crystals in his stool- this is
suggestive of a parasitic infection.  His diarrhea resolved
prior to his arrival on the medical [**Hospital1 **].

For rhythm, his atrial fibrillation had been treated with
coumadin and atenolol as an outpatient.  His beta-blocker was
initially held due to his hypotension, and was restarted as
metoprolol while he was in the ICU.  After being transferred to
the medical service, his atenolol was restarted.  He continued
to have high heart rates in the 90-100's.  His atenolol dose
should be titrated up as tolerated as an outpatient.  His
coumadin dose should be watched carefully as his azithromycin
will have significant effect on his INR once it is stopped.

For ischemia, he has a history of CAD s/p CABG.  He ruled out
for MI by serial cardiac enzymes.  Beta-blocker was given as
above.

For pump, he presented to the ICU with exacerbation of his CHF.
This may have been secondard to aggressive hydration in the
emergency department.  He responded well to boluses of lasix.
On the medical service, he was given several more boluses of IV
lasix for some orthopnea and shortness of breath with good
response.  He was ultimately re-started on his home dose of
lasix and will continue this after discharge.

For endocrine, he was continued on his home dose of
levothyroxine.

For hypertension, his lisinopril was initially held and was
restarted on [**3-24**].  He was also re-started on his standing
potassium supplementation.

For F/E/N, he was kept on a cardiac diet

For prophlyaxis, he was kept on subcutaneous heparin.

His code status is DNR/DNI.
