PORTABLE ABDOMEN  [**2136-8-20**] 2:10 AM
NG tube is in fundus of stomach. There is gaseous distention of
the colon essentially unchanged since the prior study of [**8-19**], 04. Right pleural thickening/calcification.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2136-8-20**] 8:11 AM

CHEST, AP: The NGT is seen entering the stomach with the tip at
the distal stomach or proximal duodenum. Massively dilated large
bowel is again noted. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
contours are stable in appearance. Diffuse bilateral patchy
infiltrates are again noted and stable in appearance. The left
side of the chest is not included with the view of the image.
The osseous and soft tissue structures are stable in appearance.

IMPRESSION: NGT with tip at distal stomach or proximal duodenum.
Overall unchanged radiographic appearance of the chest and
abdomen compared to prior study.

RENAL U.S.  [**2136-8-19**] 4:43 PM
The left kidney measures 8.5 cm. The right kidney measures 7.8
cm. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis. A simple cyst is
seen at the upper pole of the right kidney measuring 1.7 cm. A
simple cyst is seen at the lower pole of the right kidney
measuring 3.0 cm. Two simple cysts are identified at the upper
pole of the left kidney measuring 3.8 and 3.5 cm respectively.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis. Unchanged examination
when compared to [**2136-8-16**].

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2136-8-17**] 12:09 PM

The patient is status post median sternotomy and coronary artery
bypass surgery. A permanent pacemaker remains in place with
leads unchanged in position. There is stable cardiac enlargement
and stable mediastinal widening. Vascular engorgement and
perihilar haziness are again noted. There has been overall
increase in degree of perihilar haziness and worsening of
thickened septal lines. An asymmetrical area of confluent
opacity in the right perihilar region is also noted adjacent to
an area of calcified pleural thickening. There is probably also
an associated right pleural effusion. Within the imaged portion
of the upper abdomen, distention of the stomach and adjacent
bowel loops is noted.

Comparison is also made to older chest radiographs dating back
to [**2131-12-31**]. The bilateral mediastinal widening and
calcified pleural thickening were present on the older
radiograph.

IMPRESSION: Worsening congestive heart failure. It is difficult
to fully exclude an area of pneumonia in the right lower lobe
and follow-up radiographs are recommended following diuresis.

ECHO Study Date of [**2136-8-14**]
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately
dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is
severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis. LV systolic function appears
depressed.
3. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular
systolic
function appears depressed.
4. A bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis is present. The mitral
prosthesis
appears well seated, with normal leaflet motion and
transvalvular gradients.
5. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.

KNEE (AP, LAT & OBLIQUE) LEFT  [**2136-8-14**] 2:02 PM

LEFT KNEE THREE VIEWS [**2136-8-14**]; The bones are diffusely
demineralized. There is a small suprapatellar joint effusion. No
evidence for fracture dislocation. Vascular calcification and
clips are noted. No erosions. Diffuse subcutaneous edema appears
to be present.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Cardiac:
CHF: The patient's lasix was initially held secondary to
depleted volume status on exam and acute on chronic renal
failure, possibly pre-renal.
HTN: The patient was continued on Captopril, Isosorbide DN, and
a beta-blocker.
CAD: The patient was continued on a statin, B-blocker, and
isosorbide DN.
MVR: The patient's coumadin was initially held as the patient
was supratherapeutic at 5.4 INR. An echo was obtained which
revealed severe TR and severely depressed systolic function.
Arrhythmia: The patient was continued on Amiodarone for
paroxysmal AFib.

2. Neuro: CT head negative for acute thrombosis/bleed. He had no
focal deficits on exam, and his weakness was thought to be
overall global weakness related to deconditioning and chronic
microvascular infarcts.

3. Renal: mild acute on chronic renal failure
 Likely pre-renal, gently replete fluids given h/o CHF. His
lasix was originally held.

4. Derm:
PSORIASIS: The patient initially refused treatment of his
psoriasis. Dermatology was asked to consult on the patient and
recommended topical treatment which he agreed to.
CELLULITIS: The patient was started on Cefazolin 1 gm IV Q12 on
[**2136-8-13**] empirically
