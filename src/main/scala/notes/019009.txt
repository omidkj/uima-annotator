Allergies:
Zestril

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 84-year-old woman with history of obesity,
hypertension, diabetes, type II, coronary artery disease, heart
failure (LVEF 26%), COPD, atrial fibrillation, dementia, HTN and
multiple myeloma presented from [**Hospital3 2558**] with shortness of
breath for several days and worsened lower extremity edema.


[**Known firstname 4248**] is responsive, pleasant and interactive, but dementia is
evident. She does not know why she is here and denies shortness
of breath. Shortnessof breath was noted for several days at
[**Hospital3 2558**] with some increased work of breathing. Hypoxia to
85% O2Sat on was noted on the day of admission. EMS were called.
She received furosemide 80 mg IV x 1 and nitroglycerin by EMS en
route.


In the ED, initial VS: T 96.8, HR 82, BP 121/73, RR 20,
100%4LNC. Her BNP was 12 511 (baseline 4000s). Cr was 2.3. ABG
was 7.35/57/61/33. CXR showed L base atelectasis and no
infiltrate. Head CT was negative. Patient was somnolent and had
altered mental status in ED, very similar to her known baseline.
But ED team was concerned and wanted MICU admission. On transfer
to the ICU, her vitals T 96.9, HR 69, BP 90/47, RR 16, O2 sat
99%2L. She had put out 500 cc of urine.


In the MICU her mental status was observed to wax and [**Last Name (un) **] with
periods of near unresponsiveness. Fluid balance in the MICU was
-240 cc net. BiPAP was not needed. She is now saturating to high
90s % on room air, without nasal cannula. Hematocrit was noted
to drop between the ED and MICU, but the patient has not yet
stooled, nor has guaiac been performed. There is a tinge of
blood in her urine, but a Foley was either placed or replaced on
admission (not clear if she has at baseline). In the MICU her
blood pressure has been around 100 systolic. She has been
afebrile.

with CHF exaccerbation. Currently living at [**Hospital3 2558**]. Now
patient requires wheel chair for mobility, per daughter. Denies
tobacco/alcohol.

Family History:
Sister with coronary artery disease.

Physical Exam:
Physical Exam on Transfer from the MICU (similar to status at
admission to MICU):
General: Elderly woman, slightly overweight, Alert, oriented,
apparently greater than normal work of breating with unclear
baseline. Hunched posture sitting leaning to right in bed.
HEENT: Sclera anicteric but with some injection, MMM, oropharynx
clear..
Neck: Supple, JVP not elevated when at 30 degrees (actually
flat), no LAD.
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, trivial crackles in
the bases, some transmitted upper airway sounds, impression of
some COPD based on cardiac auscultation and slightly slow
exhalation.
CV: Distant sounds, normal S1 with quiet S2, no murmurs, rubs,
gallops appreciated.
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present,
no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly.
Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis. No
pitting edema, some venous stasis dermatitis.
Skin: Some venous stasis dermatitis.
Neuro: Difficult arouse, but then to alertness, responsive.
Oriented to hospital, self, but not context. Appears
deconditioned and impression is that she likely does not walk at
baseline - gait not tested. Moving all limbs spontaneously.

CXR: There is moderate cardiomegaly, unchanged. There are low
lung
volumes. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
pneumothorax.  There is left basilar atelectasis. The pulmonary
arteries are prominent bilaterally and there is mild increased
interstitial markings. Multilevel degenerative changes of the
thoracic spine, including compression deformities are noted.
Severe degenerative changes of the left shoulder are unchanged.

Head CT: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, major
vascular
territorial infarction, mass effect, or edema. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
matter
differentiation is preserved. Periventricular white matter
hypodensity is
unchanged and consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic
disease.
Age-appropriate prominence of ventricles and sulci is consistent
with diffuse parenchymal volume loss, unchanged from prior.
There may be mild mucosal thickening in the ethmoid sinuses, but
evaluation is limited due to patient motion. The remainder of
visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well
aerated. No osseous abnormality is identified. Globes and lenses
are intact. There is calcification of the bilateral cavernous
carotids.

Brief Hospital Course:
  This 84-year-old woman had an episode of desaturation on
several days of more labored breathing. Likely CHF exacerbation.
Mental status appears to be at baseline, with dramatic variation
in level of arousal (see below), worse than typical baseline per
her daughter. Breathing improved with diuresis and mental status
also seemed improved over the course of the admission. She will
return to [**Hospital3 2558**].


Shortness of Breath and Desaturation
  Likely CHF exacerbation. BNP elevated at [**Numeric Identifier 890**] from 4800 in
[**2120-11-22**]. Respiratory status rapidly improved after furosemide
80 mg IV x 1 by EMS. Also with evidence of COPD exacerbation on
exam. No evidence of pneumonia, ACS, tachyarrhthmias. Stable
oxygen saturation on 2L NC then room air at admission at then to
99% on room air at transfer to the floor (the next day). Patient
had no respiratory distress by the time she was transferred to
the floor. For her COPD, she was given nebulizers prn.
Restarted home Lasix dose (although IV - gave 20 mg) today. Home
Lasix dose is not clear based on records from admission (not in
admission note, but 40 mg and 60 mg doses hand written on
[**Hospital3 2558**] notes). Given wheeze, is likely that COPD is also
present.  Albuterol and ipratropium nebulizer tr
