History of Present Illness:
89F Italian speaking woman with COPD, HTN, DM, recently admitted
at [**Hospital1 18**] ([**11-12**] - [**12-1**]) large mediastinal mass, diagnosed with
thyroid cancer, s/p intubation, now trached, is being
retransferred from rehab for further management of her cancer
and possible tracheal stent and PEG tube placement.
.
Pt was at OSH from [**11-3**] to [**11-12**] for 2 months of SOB, wheezing,
sputum production, found to have LLL PNA and large mediastinal
mass deviating the trachea to the right. Patient was treated
with Levo/flagyl. Course was c/b Afib requiring dilt gtt and ARF
with Cr up to 4.0 on [**11-9**].
.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**11-12**] for further
evaluation. Pt was intubated on arrival for airway protection
given stridor. Extubated on [**11-22**] but reintubated for excessive
secretions on [**11-24**], then trached. FNA of mass indeterminant but
bx during trach placement with papillary thyroid ca, follicular
type. Normal TFTs, thyroglobulin of 1170. Course c/b ARF, MRSA
PNA and [**Female First Name (un) **] tracheitis, treated with 8d of Vanc and 5d of
Fluc. Also Prednisone taper for COPD until [**12-1**]. DVT of LUE PICC
and R CVL IJ treated with heparin gtt (transiently on argagroban
for plt drop but HIT neg x2) and transitioned to coumadin.
Recurrent sputum pos for MRSA, started on linezolid (vanco
thought to have caused thrombocytopenia). Also AF/RVR during
this admission, treated with Dilt drip and transitioned to PO
dilt. Discharged to rehab with outpatient endocrine and oncology
f/u.
.
At [**Hospital 100**] rehab since [**12-1**],unable to wean from vent initially
due to secretions. Trach suture were left in place due to
concern that trach might fall out. Seen by her surgeon Dr
[**Last Name (STitle) **] who decided against surgery given past thyroid
surgery/scarring. Pt unable to see endocrine and onc as outpt
b/o ventilator and family requested transfer back to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further inpt management. Also for eval of PEG tube placement
since NG tubes fell out repetitively (no NGT since [**12-17**]).
During her rehab stay, she spiked to 102, grew MRSA from cath
tip and in blood and Proteus (intermediate sensitivities to FQ)
in trach aspirate and cath tip. Also diarrhea but C diff neg
repetitively. Pt was treated with Linezolid (to be continued
until 12/6 per DC summary), and Ceftriaxone and Flagyl (to be
continued until 12/2 per DC summary). Her coumadin was held
since her INR remained around 2.5 due to poor nutrition.
.
She is now being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible trach stent
(by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], PEG and further follow up by Endocrine and
Oncology for her thyroid cancer. On transfer, she is afebrile
and comfortable with 100% O2 on 40% trach mask.

Pertinent Results from rehab:
Labs at rehab from [**12-21**]:
.
139  109  26
---------------< 244
4.5  22  1.4
.
WBC: 12.5, 3% bands
Hct: 31.2
Plt: 277

INR: ranging 2.4-2.8 over last 4 days
.
.
Imaging:
.
Thyroid US [**11-16**]:
1. Ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration of a large vascular
left thyroid nodule without immediate complication.
2. No right thyroid lobe. Correlation with patient history is
recommended.
.
CT Torso [**11-13**]:
1. Incompletely imaged heterogenous soft tissue mass containing

calcifications extending along the left thoracic inlet and upper

retrosternal region causing compression and rightward deviation
of the trachea. The mass does not appear to invade mediastinal
structures. Diagnostic considerations include a large thyroid
mass or multinodular goiter with retrosternal component, much
less likely a thymic lesion.
2. Low position of the endotracheal tube with its tip just above

the carina.
3. Peribronchiolar nodular opacities and ground-glass
attenuation in the posterior right upper lobe may represent
evolving infectious etiology or aspiration.
4. Left lower lobe collapse with opacification of the left lower

lobe bronchus. Further evaluation with bronchoscopy is advised
to exclude an endobronchial lesion or extrinsic compression at
the left hilum.
5. 2.0 cm ill-defined low attenuation in the upper pole of the
right kidney, which is incompletely characterized on this
non-contrast study. If indicated, further assessment could be
performed with a dedicated renal ultrasound.
6. Generalized anasarca.
.
Thyroid biopsy [**11-25**]: Left thyroid, biopsy:
Papillary carcinoma, follicular variant
.
CXR [**12-22**] (read pending): Trach in good position, mediastinum
shifted to R, small b/l pleural effusions
.
EKG: NSR, nl axis, nl intervals, no acute ST changes
.
[**12-25**] CT Abd w/o contrast:
1. Bibasal effusions with atelectasis at the lung bases and
scattered parenchymal patchy lung opacities suggestive of
infection.
2. Satisfactory position of the PEG tube with no hematoma or
free fluid in the abdomen or pelvis.
3. Spigelian hernia with tiny pockets of air in the surrounding
subcutaneous tissues, but no stranding, fluid collections or
skin thickening. This is likely representing sequlae of
subcutaneous heparin injection, per discussion with the medical
resident.
.
CT Trachea (3D) [**12-25**]:
1. Enlarged left lobe of the thyroid gland with retrosternal
extension causing displacement of the trachea at the thoracic
inlet as described above.
2. Bibasal effusions with passive atelectasis of the lower lobes
and scattered ill-defined patchy opacities in both lungs
suggestive of infection.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 89F Italian speaking woman with COPD, HTN, DM, recently
admitted at [**Hospital1 18**] ([**11-12**] - [**12-1**]) large mediastinal mass,
diagnosed with thyroid cancer, s/p intubation and subsequent
trach (b/o increased secretions), now retransferred from rehab
for further management of her cancer and PEG tube placement.
.
1. Mediastinal Mass: Recent diagnosis of papillary thyroid
cancer, follicular type. Normal TFTs, Thyroglobulin 1170
recently. Recent Head/Torso CT negative metastatic w/u but
without contrast. Seen by surgery at rehab. No surgical
candidate given past thyroid surgery. A PEG has been placed one
day after admission by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1533**] from thoracic surgery. Pt
was evaluated by endocrine who deferred further discussions to
outpt setting given multiple other issues. IP has evaluated the
patient as well. Her trach was changed with fenestration for
phonation. Pt should follow up as an outpatient with
interventional pulmonary. Endocrinologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13059**] should
also be contact[**Name (NI) **] after discharge.
.
2. Respiratory Failure: During recent admission, initially
intubated for airway protection given stridor. Then MRSA
pneumonia and [**Female First Name (un) **] tracheitis s/p vanc and fluc treatment.
Extubated on [**2191-11-22**] but reintubated b/o secretions and
trached. Again secretions at rehab but eventually weaned to
trach mask. Trach sutures were to be pulled on [**12-7**] but left in
at rehab due to concerns of trach movement. On this ad
