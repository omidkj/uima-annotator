Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5552**]
Chief Complaint:
Hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bronchoscopy x 3


History of Present Illness:
66 M with history of adenocarcinoma of unknown origin p/w
hemoptysis.
He was recently hospitalized on [**8-18**] with nausea/vomitting fever
found to have a pneumonia s/p treatment but also with lung/liver
masses, s/p lung biopsy and referred to oncology and offered
systemic chemotherapy in [**8-18**]. The patient traveled to the Dubai
for alternative herbal therapy for the past few months, and has
since returned to the states 1 week prior. He notes an
increasing productive cough for yellow sputum, initially blood
tinged progressive over the week. Last evening, noted increasing
hemoptysis, [**6-17**] teaspoons, with blood clots, and presented to
the ED.
He otherwise has some mild wheezes per report, denies cp,
although with R sided chest discomfort, nonpleuritic,
nonreproducible,no clear [**Month/Day (3) 74384**], episode of vomitting 2 days
ago, food particles no blood, no brbpr,diarrhea,constipation.
Affirms weight loss over the past few months, with some
anorexia.

In the ED, VS 99 95 157/93 20 96Ra, CTA performed demonstrated
no PE, but with large R sided lung mass
.

Onc Hx:
[**2147**]- Hematuria, with ? L RCC s/p L nephrectomy (in [**Country 9819**]),
arrived to US in [**2151**], with increasing mass in chest CT. PET
scan [**2158**] with multiple foci of abnormal uptake in soft tissue
densities seen in the right lung associated with subcarinal LAD
consistent with
metstatic disease, as well as uptake in a large mass involving
the dome of the right lobe of the liver. [**8-18**] presented to [**Hospital1 18**]
with n/v A CAT scan of the torso on admission revealed the right
lower lung mass now measuring 4.4 x 2.7 cm with extension to the
right lower lobe bronchus, multiple surrounding satellite
nodules and a right hilar lymphadenopathy. In addition, there
was a 7.6 cm low density lobulated liver lesion as well as a
tiny low density lesion in the body of the pancreas, (felt to be
insignificant on review with radiology). RLL Biopsy revealed
non-small-cell carcinoma consistent with adenocarcinoma.
Immunohistochemical stains for cytokeratin 7 and
CK 20 are positive, TTF-1 is negative. These findings support
the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. The possibilities include a
tumor of pancreaticobiliary origin.
.
-MRI of the abdomen reveals a large predominantly cystic mass in

the right lobe of the liver measuring approximately 7.1 x 11 cm
x
8.3 cm. There are two smaller adjacent lesions, whose appearance

is most consistent with abscess. Renal cell metastasis seems
unlikely based on the MR appearance. Metastasis to T10 is
described as well as metastasis to the right lower lobe of the
lung. There is note made of hernia of the large bowel through
the anterior abdominal wall.


Past Medical History:
Presumed renal cell carcinoma status post left nephrectomy in
[**2147**] in [**Country 9819**].
Adenocarcinoma of Unknown origin to lung/liver ? bone
Possible Macroadenoma
ventral abdominal hernia


Social History:
Social History: The patient immigrated to the United States in
[**2151**] as a refugee from [**Country 16160**]. He denies tobacco, alcohol, and

drug use. He lives at home with his wife and children. He has
13 children. Import/Exporter from [**Country 651**]


Family History:
There are no known cancers in the family. The
patient does note that his father died of swelling in the throat

possibly related to either infection or cancer.

Pertinent Results:
[**2-3**] CXR
IMPRESSION: Progression of right-sided pulmonary masses. No
evidence of superimposed acute cardiopulmonary abnormality
.
[**2-3**] CTA
No PE in the main or segmental arteries. Subsegmental arteries
eval. limited by resp. motion and contrast bolus.
Progression of disease with massive right sided lung masses,
including large 9 x 5 cm mass with endobronchial component
involving the RLL and RML bronchi, which may contribute to pt's
hemoptysis. RML is nearly completely collapsed/infiltrated with
tumor.
.
ECG Study Date of [**2160-2-4**]  8:30:20 AM
Sinus rhythm. Normal tracing. No previous tracing available for
comparison.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2160-2-7**] 3:25 PM
The multiple pulmonary masses of the right lung including the
right upper lobe, right middle lobe, and right lower lobe appear
relatively unchanged. The right hemidiaphragm is elevated. No
new focal consolidative process is noted. The left lung is
clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
unchanged. The osseous structures of the thorax appear normal.
IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged multiple pulmonary masses of the right lung with no
new consolidative process.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2160-2-8**] 1:33 PM
FINDINGS: In comparison with earlier study of this date, the
patient has taken a much better inspiration, which has resulted
in some decrease in opacification of the right base. The large
masses persist.
.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2160-2-8**] 1:55 AM
CT CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:
CTA: There is no evidence of a pulmonary embolism in the main or
the segmental pulmonary arteries. The evaluation of subsegmental
branches is limited due to collapse-consolidation as well as
extensive tumor involvement of the right lower lobe.
There is minimal interval increase in the size of the multiple
bilateral pulmonary metastases. For example, there is a 41 x 32
mm pleural-based mass in the right upper lobe, previously 36 x
28 mm (image 33, series 9). There is a 56 x 51 mm lesion in the
right lower lobe, previously 52 x 48 mm (image 64, series 9).
There is interval increase in the collapse-consolidation in the
right lower lobe.
Right superior paratracheal loculations of air are unchanged
since [**2159-8-14**], probably tracheal diverticuli.
There also is minimal interval increase in the multi-station
mediastinal lymphadenopathy. For example, there is a 24 x 15 mm
pretracheal lymph node, previously 20 x 14 mm (image 151, series
9). The tumor in the right lower lobe surrounds the right
pulmonary artery, invading the adjacent bronchus intermedius and
may spread endobronchially. There are bronchial secretions
present in the right lower lobe bronchus--it is difficult to
distinguish endobroncheal secretions from tumor involvement.
There are multiple hepatic metastases which appear more cystic
and larger when compared to the prior examination, and this may
be related to treatment effect. There is a 73 x 56 mm metastasis
in the right hepatic dome, previously 62 x 60 mm (image 94,
series 9). There is a 94 x 49 mm metastasis in the right lobe of
the liver, previously 90 x 44 mm (image 119, series 9).
MUSCULOSKELETAL:
The lytic lesion in the inferior aspect of T10 vertebral body is
unchanged. There is no significant loss of height of the
vertebral body.
CONCLUSION:
1. No definite evidence of a central or segmental pulmonary
embolism; however, the possibility of subsegmental emboli cannot
be excluded, especially in the right lower lobe due to extensive
tumor involvement and atelectasis.
2. Minimal progression of metastatic disease with increase in
the size of pulmonary metastases and mediastinal lymphadenopathy
as described above.
3. There is interval increase in the collapse-consolidation in
the right lower lobe. There is progressive loss of volume in the
right lower lobe, likely a combination of endobronchial
extension and retention of bronchial secretions.
4. Interval increase in the size of hepatic metastases, which
appear more cystic and may be rela
