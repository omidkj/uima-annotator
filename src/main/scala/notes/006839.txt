Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath & bradycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
N/A

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 62 yo M with h/o COPD, CHF, HTN, now admitted to CCU with
bradycardia in the setting of hyperkalemia and ARF. Pt states he
had a sinus headache 5 days prior to admission and went to his
PCP's office and had blood work. He reports that his PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) 4922**], called him the following day and told him to stop
taking his lasix and to take his digoxin only every other day.
He had more blood drawn 2 days prior to admission.  He reports
that he was feeling progressively more sluggish with
lightheadedness on standing increased dyspnea on exertion.  He
felt he could not go to work. He admits to slight abd pain but
no N/V.  He denies CP, palpitations, fevers, chills. Just prior
to admission, he received a call from his PCP that he should go
to the ED because of lab abnormalities.
.
He notes that since stopping the lasix his legs have been more
swollen. His weight has increased from baseline of 285 lbs in
[**Month (only) 404**] to 291 last week and 293 today.  He states he adheres to
a low salt diet and has had no recent indiscretions. He denies
orthopnea, PND.
.
Pt came to the ED and was found to have a HR in the 20's. K was
elevated at 6.5 and digitalis level was elevated at 2.4. He was
given 30 po kayexalate, 1 amp D50, 10 units insulin IV, 1 amp
bicarb, albuterol nebs x 2, and 1mg atropine. HR improved to the
30's and sBP remained stable in the 120's and he was transferred
to the CCU.

Pertinent Results:
RENAL U/S [**2131-8-7**]:
1.  No hydronephrosis bilaterally.  Renal cortical thinning
bilaterally -
clinical correlation is recommended..
2.  Small ascites within lower abdomen.
3.  Cholelithiasis.
4.  Splenomegaly.
.
TTE [**2131-8-8**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The inferior vena cava is
dilated (>2.5 cm). Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity
size are normal. Left ventricular systolic function is normal.
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated. Right
ventricular systolic function appears depressed. There is
abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic root is mildly
dilated. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with mild
mitral regurgitation. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There
is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Compared with the
prior study (images reviewed) of [**2131-3-22**], tricuspid
regurgitation is now much more prominent (although views
suboptimal in the prior study). The right ventricle was
similarly dilated previously (dilitation was underestimated in
prior study). Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
now much higher (however may have been underestimated in the
prior study).
.
CXR [**2131-8-9**]: cardiomegaly and stable moderate pulmonary edema.
Possible anterior mediastinal mass vs. unusual LUL atelectasis.

.
CT CHEST [**2131-8-9**]: Minimal edema.  Moderately severe emphysema.
Probable pulmonary arterial hypertension, global cardiomegaly.
Tiny right pleural effusion.  Small-to-moderate volume of
ascites.  Severe splenomegaly.  Calcific cholelithiasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
62 yo M with h/o CRI, CHF, HTN, now with ARF with hyperkalemia
and dig toxicity with bradycardia.
.
1) Bradycardia/digoxin toxicity:  Upon admission, Mr. [**Known lastname 65398**]
EKG showed a heart rate in the low 30's with changes consistent
with AV block from digoxin toxicity with fixed, coupled VPC's of
different morphologies.  He continued to receive kayexalate and
agressive diuresis until his potassium level was lowered into
our target range of 4.7 - 5.2.  He remained bradycardic with HR
in the 30's in a junctional rhythm until on the a.m. of [**8-8**] he
had a non-sustained run of ventricular tachycardia.  His ectopy
subsequently progressed to intermittent ventricular bigeminy.
At the type of discharge, he had a heart rate in the 50's with a
rhythm consistent with atrial bradycardia and decreased
incidence of ectopy.  His rhythm was evaluated by EP Cardiology
consultation, and he was deemed not to be a candidate for a
pacer as long as the arrhythmia was considered to be related to
a reversible drug toxicity.  His beta-blocker regimen was
discontinued in the setting of profound bradycardia.  Digibind
was not given to reverse the digitalis toxicity, as the toxicity
was considered to be chronic and the patient remained stable
throughout the hospital course.
.
2) Hyperkalemia:  We followed his potassium levels serially
throughout hospitalization with a goal to keep levels in the
range of 4.7-5.2, as hypokalemia is known to potentiate
glycoside toxicity  by decreasing the Na-K-ATPase activity. He
was repleted with oral KCL as necessary.  At the time of
discharge, his potassium level was 4.4.
.
2) ARF: Creatinine level trended down throughout his
hospitalization from peak of 3.2->2.8->2.4->2.0->1.7->1.3 at
discharge. (baseline Cr 1.4).  His acute renal failure was
likely precipitated by acute on chronic CHF, after his Lasix was
discontinued as an outpatient. Possibly worsening CHF lead to
decreased perfusion of kidneys. Renal ultrasound showed no
hydronephrosis, ruling out post-renal obstruction.  Urine
electrolytes showed prerenal physiology and his urine sediment
was bland.  Throughout his hospitalization, he underwent
aggressive diuresis with a goal of negative 2-3 liters per day,
until his creatinine reached a nadir and further diuresis was
considered to be a risk to his preload.  He was treated
throughout his hospital course with Renagel for
hyperphosphatemia but this medication was discontinued at time
of discharged.
.
4) Hypoxia: Patient presented with pulmonary edema on chest
xray, consistent with cor pulmonale, which resolved gradually
with diuresis.  He also has a history of COPD secondary to a
long history of tobacco abuse and is maintained on 24 hour
oxygen as an outpatient.  He also has a history of obstructive
sleep apnea and has used BiPap for the past two years (home
settings 17,11) which he enjoys and tolerates well.  His
overnight requirement on BiPap is 12L most likely due to
combined cor pulmonale, COPD, and sleep apnea picture.  His
oxygen demands gradually decreased by the end of the hospital
course and he was discharged with instructions for 3L NC O2
during the day and 4L BiPAP 17/11 with a goal to maintain SpO2
>85%.

4) HTN: BP remained stable throughout h
