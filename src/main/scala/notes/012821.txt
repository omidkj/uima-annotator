History of Present Illness:
MICU admission history:
.
The patient is a 64 year old male with history of ETOH abuse who
presents with GI bleeding. Of note, the patient is intubated on

Conversation with patient's wife reveals that approximately one
week ago in the setting of increasing drinking, the patient
started reporting feeling of nausea and dyspepsia. Yesterday,
the patient's wife came home and founf dark brown fluid in the
floor which the husband reported he vomited. The patient
reportedly went to the bathroom and passed dark black stool.
After walking out of the bathroom he was noted to call out and
then fell over. EMS was contact[**Name (NI) **] and the patient was brought to
an OSH.
During his evaluation the patient is reported to have coded or
had a peri-code like event including hypotension and
bradycardia. The patient was treated with Epinephrine and
Atropine as well as levophed with question if compressions were
also started. The patient recovered but then developed Afib with
RVR for which he was given Amiodarone 300mg x 1.
The patient received 9L fluid and 3U PRBCs at the OSH and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ongoing management. In the ED the
patient received an additional 6U PRBCs as well as 2U FFP and 2U
platelets for total blood product support of 9U PRBCs, 2U FFp,
2U platelets.
.
On arrival to the floor the patient had CVP measured which was
18. The patient was treated with 40mg IV lasix x 1 for likely
volume overload contributing to afib in setting of large
transfusion load.
.
History upon admission to the floor:
.
Patient is a 64 year old male with a history of ETOH abuse who
presented with GI bleeding on [**7-13**]. Patient was intubated upon
arrival so much of the initial information was obtained from the
patient's wife and chart. Approximately one week PTA the patient
had nausea and dyspepsia in the setting of increased alcohol
use. On [**7-12**] the patient's wife came home and found dark brown
fluid on the floor, which the husband said he had vomited. He
then reportedly went to the bathroom, passed dark black stool,
walked out of the bathroom, called out and fell over. EMS was
called and took the patient to an OSH.
Per report the patient coded (?PEA arrest) or had a peri-code
event where he became hypotensive and bradycardic. He was
treated with epinephrine,atropine and levophed. It is not clear
if chest compressions were started, but he was intubated. The
patient improved but then developed afib with RVR and was given
300 mg amoidarone. At the OSH he received a total of 9L of fluid
and 3U PRBCs and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. On transfer to [**Hospital1 **]
still had large amounts of melena and NG lavage was unable to
clear blood. Hct in the ER was 33.8, INR 1.4 and platelets 45.
In the ED the patient received an additional 6U PRBCs as well as
2U FFP and 2U platelets for total blood product support of 9U
PRBCs, 2U FFp, 2U platelets. Were able to wean him off pressors.
He was then admitted to the MICU.
.
MICU course: With regard to his GIB he had an EGD and was
thought to have [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear at the GE junction, as well
as gastritis. With regard to his respiratory status, he initally
had a CVP of 18, with coarse breath sounds and appeared
overloaded. Was treated with lasix, as volume overload was
thought to be contributing to afib and hypoxia. He was
subsequently extubated on [**7-16**] and respiratory status has been
stable. Additionally he was noted to have ARF with Cr of 4.1
thought to be [**12-29**] to shock or ATN. He had good UOP in the MICU
and Cr has trended down to 1.7 He was also found to be
hypernatremic and treated with free water. He had some MS
changes while in the MICU and there was some concern as to
whether this was due to anoxic brain injury and whether this
could also be resulting in DI and hypernatremia. CT of the head
was negative for bleed or edema. Finally, the patient has been
spiking intermittent temps in the MICU and had temp to 101 on
[**7-15**], but he was not treated with antibiotics.
.
Currently the patient denies CP, SOB or abdominal pain. He
states he still has some dark stools. He recalls that prior to
admission was drinking heavily x 3 weeks and was drinking about
"a 5th per day." He was vomiting frequently and noticed bloody
emesis a day PTA and also noted black stools at that time. He
does not remember having CP or SOB.
