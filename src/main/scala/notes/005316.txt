Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**]
Chief Complaint:
headaches

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right frontal craniotomy for tumor


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 41671**] initially began with headaches in [**2183**].  An MRI was
done, which showed a 7-mm meningioma in the right frontal area.
At that time, the
headaches were thought not to be contributed by this presumed
meningioma and she was followed up.  She has been serially
followed up with investigations.  More recently, she has had a
scan on [**2189-7-15**].  This did not show any change from last
year.  However, it was compared to way back to [**2184**], and there
was thought to be a couple of millimeters increase in size.
Today, she was seen for discussion of management for this.

Ms. [**Known lastname 41671**] still has occasional headaches.  These are not
significantly increased in seriousness.  However, she is
extremely distressed from the fact that this has grown, and she
wished to consider some treatment and I would discuss all the
treatment options.

She denies any other higher function, cranial nerves, sensory,
motor, or neurological dysfunction.


Past Medical History:
Migraine headaches, fibromyalgia, low back
pain, abdominal surgery for removal of fallopian tube with cyst
formation, question nerve damage after that, TAH-BSO, and
depression.


Social History:
She is married and has two sons. + 15-pack-year smoking history
and states that she occasionally smokes.  She does not drink and
denies any alcohol use.


Family History:
Depression and diabetes in the family but no history of any
cancer.


Physical Exam:
On Discharge:
teary otherwise non focal
sutures at crani site

[**12-2**] MRI Brain:
IMPRESSION: Presumed right frontal meningioma, unchanged in size
or
appearance compared to [**2189-7-15**] study.

CT head [**2189-12-2**]
IMPRESSION: Expected post-operative changes, immediately after
right frontal craniotomy with focal craniectomy and resection of
presumed meningioma.

MRI brain [**12-3**]
IMPRESSIONS: Status post right frontal craniotomy and resection
of
extra-axial right frontal probable meningioma. Expected
postoperative changes are as described above, with no evidence
of residual mass seen. Small area of cytotoxic edema noted along
the resection bed in the right frontal lobe.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 41671**] was taken to the OR on [**2189-12-2**] for a right frontal
craniotomy for tumor. She was transfered to the SICU intubated.
Post-op CT showed no hemorrhage. She was extubated.

On [**12-3**] she was neurologically stable therefore she was
transferred to the floor. Post op MRI was performed which
revealed excellent resection. She was ambulating independently
without assistance.

On [**11-23**] she remained neurologically stable but emotional. She
also had frequent nausea and complained of lack of sleep. On [**12-6**]
she was feeling better and was ready to be discharged home.
