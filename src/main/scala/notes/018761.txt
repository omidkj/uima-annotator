History of Present Illness:
56yo man with hepatitis C/ETOH-induced liver cirrhosis with
history of decompensation with recurrent ascites and recurrent
encephalopathy s/p TIPS in [**8-/2156**], who is transferred from [**Location (un) 21541**] Hospital after presenting there with weakness. Per report,
pt called EMS with weakness x 4days with fever and chills. He
reports poor po intake/anorexia during this time. He denies any
dietary indescretion, but he reports increasing abd girth and
leg swelling. He did report a few missed doses of lactulose
prior to weakness.
.
He was found by EMS in pool of stool, BS of 42, given an amp of
D50 and brought to [**Hospital3 **] hospital. He was found to be
confused, but reorientable, incontinent of urine, 3+edema. On
labs he had k of 6.2 and was given kaexalate, insulin/dextrose,
calcium gluconate and repeat of 4.9 on transfer. He had abd CT
and u/s of his abdomen which showed ascites, TIPS occlusion. A
paracentesis was done. He had bld cxs that grew out GNRs. Pt
received 8 vials of albumin for hepatorenal ppx, 1 dose of
ceftriaxone and 1 dose of cefotaxime. He was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**].
.
Initial ROS was (+)increasing protuberance of abd with abd pain,
He reports that he has gained weight (ideal wt of 149-152),
currently 70kgs. +SOB with increasing abd distension. + maroon
stools.
(-) denies significant confusion, n/v/d/dysuria/cp or any other
symptoms.


Past Medical History:

patient was treated with pegylated interferon and ribavirin for
a period of six months. For unclear reasons, this treatment was
discontinued. The patient was subsequently enrolled in the

Brief Hospital Course:
Upon arrival at [**Hospital1 18**], patient was admitted to the [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 679**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4869**].  He was treated with Ceftrixone and  albumin for
presumed SBP and hepatorenal syndrome. Diuretics were held.
Lactulose, rifaxamin, and ursodiol were continued. Abdominal
ultrasound confirmed no flow through portal vein and likely TIPS
occlusion.  OSH cultures revealed GNR, speciation revealed
Serratia.  Ceftriaxone was continued.
.
On [**12-3**] a diagnostic paracentesis was performed. Post
procedure, he became rigorous with brief hypoxia to 80% on 2L.
He was then placed on NRB and transfered to the MICU given
concern for impending sepsis, need for high volume resuscitation
and poor respiratory status.
.
Upon arrival the MICU, patient was rigorous, VS 100.6, 126,
185/90, 27 and 100% on NRB, then 3L NC. He denied any pain or
recent fever but did report increase in diarrhea. He quickly was
weaned from the oxygen.  He remained hemodynamically stable with
no evidence of sepsis, although he did have recurrent episode of
rigors.  Blood cultures were negative.
.
Given known occluded TIPS, elevated bilirubin, and severe
ascites, there was consideration of TIPS revision.  This was
decided against out of concern for worsening liver failure.
Therapeutic tap was not performed initially because of infected
peritoneum and later out of concern for worsening renal failure
(see below).  The patient was noted to be on the top of the
liver [**Month/Year (2) **] list.  An NG tube was placed under direct
visualization in order to optimize nutrition.
.
Urinary tract infection: Urine grew enterococcus sensitive to
vanco which was started.  Vancomycin was held for 4 days for a
high level. Creatinine was elevated to 2.1 from 1.0 from three
weeks prior.  Diuretics were held.  Creatinine trended down to
1.4.  However, it then rose again.  Albumin was given for two
days for likely hepatorenal syndrome.
.
Abdominal pain and elevated WBC: On hospital day 7, a day after
beginning tube feeds, the patient complained of abdominal pain
with upward WBC trend.  KUB did not show evidence of
obstruction.  The tube feeds were stopped, and stool studies
sent for c diff.  Repeat diagnositic paracentesis demonstrated
190 leukocytes, 78% PMN.
.
Osteoporosis/hypercalcemia:  Patient had known vertebral
compression fractures and low bone mineral density. The etiology
of osteoporosis was thought to be a combination of poor
nutrition, alcoholism, and hypogonadism (see below). Spine films
to rule out new fracture showed evidence of pelvic fracture.
Follow-up dedicated pelvic films confirmed fractures involving
bilateral superior and inferior pubic rami and bilateral sacral
ala fractures.  The orthopedics consult service saw the patient
and recommended weight bearing as tolerated and brace to be worn
when oob.

The patient was initially given calcitriol and calcium
supplementation for treatment of osteoporosis.  These were
stopped in consultation with the endocrinology consulting
service given borderline elevated calcium and replete 1,25
hydoxy vitamin D levels.  His hypercalcemia was thought to be
due to prolonged immobilization, and PTH levels were
appropriately low.
.
Hypogonadism:  As part of the work-up of his osteoporosis,
testosterone, FSH, and LH were checked and found to be low.  He
was given a testosterone patch for supplementation.  Further
work-up with pitutitary MRI was deferred to the outpatient
setting.

Hypothyroidism:  The patient was found to be hypothyroid, and
levothyroxine supplementation was begun. The d
