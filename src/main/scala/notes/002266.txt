Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  A 70-year-old patient of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4469**]
status post prior silent myocardial infarction referred for
outpatient cardiac catheterization after having a positive
exercise tolerance test and recent anginal symptoms.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 70-year-old woman with a
history of silent myocardial infarction echocardiogram from
[**2134-4-7**] revealed an ejection fraction of 55% with
distal septal and apical hypokinesis and mildly dilated LV
and mild mitral regurgitation.  Over the past several months,
the patient has noticed that she is having intermittent chest
pain, can occur at any time.  She has taken sublingual
nitroglycerin in the past with relief of these symptoms.  She
has also noticed that she is having shortness of breath with
a minimal amount of walking.  She reports occasional
shortness of breath at rest.  On [**5-15**] of [**2136**] she had an
exercise tolerance test, 3 minutes [**Doctor First Name **] protocol, 70%
maximum heart rate achieved.  She had no chest pain,
electrocardiogram without ischemic electrocardiogram changes.
Imaging revealed a large area of inferior apical infarct with
moderate peri-infarct ischemia.  There was left ventricular
dilatation at rest worsening with stress.  There was also
septal dyskinesis in the lateral wall, hypokinesis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post silent myocardial
infarction
2.  Hypertension
3.  Hypercholesterolemia
4.  Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus
5.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease
6.  Cataracts

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Bilateral broken ankles, T&A and
dilatation and curettage

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:
1.  Aspirin 81 mg qd
2.  Glucophage 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **]
3.  Glucotrol XL 10 mg qd
4.  Prilosec 20 mg 3 to 4x a week
5.  [**Doctor First Name **] 60 mg [**Hospital1 **]
6.  Multivitamin 1 qd
7.  Pravachol 40 mg qd
8.  Atenolol 50 mg qd
9.  Accupril 20 mg qd

LAB DATA PRIOR TO ADMISSION:  White count 11.1, hematocrit
30.3, platelets 198.  Sodium 144, potassium 4.0, chloride
108, CO2 27, BUN 19, creatinine 0.9.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Divorced.  She lives with her son.  She is
the caregiver, as the son has cerebral palsy.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for cardiac
catheterization.  She was brought to the cardiac
catheterization lab where she underwent cardiac
catheterization.  Please see catheterization report for full
details.  In summary, catheterization showed an ejection
fraction of 20%, left main 80%, LAD serial 80% to 90%
lesions, left circumflex with diffuse disease and an RCA with
80% lesion.  Following the catheterization, cardiothoracic
surgery was consulted.  The patient was seen and accepted for
coronary artery bypass grafting.  On [**6-22**], she was
brought to the Operating Room at which time she underwent
coronary artery bypass grafting x4.  Please see the Operating
Room report for full details.  In summary, she had a coronary
artery bypass graft x4 with a left internal mammary artery to
the LAD and saphenous vein graft to OM and ramus sequentially
and saphenous vein graft to the PL.  She was transferred from
the Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.
At the time of transfer, she had milrinone at 0.5 mcg per kg
per minute and Neo-Synephrine at 1 mcg per kg per minute.
She did well in the immediate postoperative period.  Her
anesthesia was reversed.  She was weaned from the ventilator
and successfully extubated.

On postoperative day 1, the patient was weaned from her
milrinone.  She did, however, require Neo-Synephrine to
maintain an adequate blood pressure.  Also, on postoperative
day 1, the patient experienced an episode of atrial
fibrillation.  At that time, she was started on amiodarone
and electrophysiology was consulted because the patient had
been noted to have sinus bradycardia with a rate of 40 prior
to her surgery.  In addition, on postoperative day 1, the
patient's chest tubes were discontinued.

On postoperative day 2, the patient was weaned successfully
from her Neo-Synephrine infusion.  The patient remained in
atrial fibrillation and with the assistance of anesthesia the
patient was cardioverted with 150 joules to a sinus
bradycardia with a rate of 35 to 40.  She remained in the
Intensive Care Unit, given her relative bradycardia.  For the
next several days, the patient remained in the Intensive Care
Unit to monitor her heart rate and rhythm.  During that time,
she continued to receive amiodarone and she remained in sinus
bradycardia with a rate between 35 and 55.

On postoperative day 5, it was felt that the patient was
stable and ready to be transferred from the Intensive Care
Unit to Plastics for continuing postoperative care and
cardiac rehabilitation.  Postoperative day 7, the patient's
amiodarone was discontinued, given her continuing
bradycardia.  On postoperative day 8, the patient was noted
to be in a sinus rhythm with a rate of 55 to 60.
Postoperative day 9, the patient was noted to be back in
atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 90 to 110.  Low dose
beta blockers were started at that time and during the course
of that day, the patient again converted back to a sinus
rhythm with a rate of 70 beats per minute on Lopressor 25 mg
[**Hospital1 **].

After consultation with electrophysiology and given that
patient tolerated her arrhythmias well, it was decided that
there was no urgent indication for intervention on the part
of pacemaker or AICD placement/EP studies.  After
consultation with EP and the patient, it was decided to
discharge the patient to a rehabilitation center on low dose
beta blockers and Coumadin with a target INR of 2 and that
the patient would return in one month for EP studies plus or
minus pacemaker and AICD placement.

On postoperative day 11, it was decided that the patient was
stable and ready for discharge to rehabilitation.  At the
time of discharge, the patient's physical exam is as follows:

VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.6??????, heart rate 75 sinus rhythm,
blood pressure 126/78, respiratory rate 20, O2 saturation 95%
on room air.  Her weight preoperatively is 85.8 kg.  At
discharge it is 73.1 kg.

LAB DATA ON DAY OF DISCHARGE:  White count 11.2, hematocrit
33.2, platelets 371,000.  PT of 17.1.  PTT is 31.6 and INR is
2.1.  Sodium 140, potassium 4.3, chloride 102, CO2 26, BUN
24, creatinine 1.1, glucose 60.
