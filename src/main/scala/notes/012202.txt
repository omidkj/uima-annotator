.
IMAGING:
[**11-20**] CXR COMPARISON: [**2157-8-30**].
FINDINGS: Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates interval
increase of bilateral fluffy perihilar and infrahilar opacities
as well as obscured and prominent cardiac silhouette, compatible
with moderate congestive heart failure. There is persistent
opacity involving the cardiophrenic angles.  Supervening
pneumonia and or aspiration cannot be excluded in the
appropriate clinical setting. Small effusions cannot be
excluded. There is no pneumothorax. Atherosclerotic
calcifications are seen in the aortic arch.
IMPRESSION:
1. Findings compatible with moderate congestive heart failure,
with interval worsening since [**2157-8-30**].
2. Supervening lower lobe infection and/or aspiration cannot be
excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
.
[**11-22**] CXR:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-20**], there is
continued
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with decreasing pulmonary
vascular
congestion. Confluent lower lobe opacities are consistent with
regions of
pneumonia, especially at the right base.

The endotracheal and nasogastric tubes have been removed.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 88 year old male with a history of COPD and diastolic
CHF who is admitted with 1 day of shortness of breath and
intubated in the ED for hypoxia found to have CHF exacerbation
and community acquired pneumonia.
.
# CHF exacerbation:  On admission, patient was in severe
respiratory distress requiring intubation in the ED for hypoxia.
 CXR demonstrated fluid overload.  BNP was elevated only mildly,
to 1530.  Per family and patient, he did not make any diet
changes and was compliant with medications, thus cause of
exacerbation is unclear.  However, he was up 18 lbs from his dry
weight.  ACS was ruled out as a cause of CHF exacerbation with 2
sets of neg cardiac enzymes.  Patient responded well to diuresis
with Lasix 40mg IV and was transitioned to Lasix 40mg PO qd and
finally to home dose of Lasix 20mg PO qd.  On discharge, patient
was at his dry weight of 200 lbs.  Symptom control with
albuterol and ipratroprium nebs.  Continued diltiazem, losartan
for BP control. On discharge, patient was set up with VNA
services as well as telemonitoring for daily weights.
