Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
64F active smoker with h/o CHF (EF 40% [**2103-12-12**])and COPD (on 3L
at home when compliant) who presents with worsening dyspnea x 1
day.  Patient reports a long standing history of COPD for which
she has been on home oxygen.  She reports that her breathing was
tolerable in that she was able to perform activities of daily
life up until a knee surgery in [**2104-9-15**].  Since the knee
surgery, she has experienced worsening difficulty breathing and
leg swelling.
.
She saw her [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 99701**] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 575**] on [**2104-12-12**], at which
time he suspected she had a combination of left and right-sided
CHF per notes and increased her lasix from 60 to 80 mg po.  He
recommended 24 hr-O2 although patient now reports that she only
wears oxygen when her symptoms bother her.  She was admitted
[**Date range (1) 99702**] of this year for foot pain and worsening SOB thought
to be secondary to a combination of CHF exacerbation and COPD.
She was diuresed with IV lasix 80 [**Hospital1 **] and eventually refused
further diuresis and requested to be discharged per notes.  She
was discharged on a steroid taper.  She now reports that she was
still having difficulty breathing at the time of discharge.
.
On [**2105-1-10**], she [**Date Range 653**] her PCP with complaints of difficulty
breathing and was told to increase her lasix to 80 mg [**Hospital1 **] which
she did over the weekend.  She continued to have SOB and saw her
PCP today who sent her to the ED after her sats were 80% at rest
and 60s with ambulation.  Of note, she only took 40 mg lasix
this AM because she had decided that she would be coming to the
hospital.
.
She also reports greenish sputum that differs from her normal
sputum that is crystal white.  She is unable to quanitfy how
long she has had green colored sputum and says that it is
complicated by her having been intermittently on antibiotics,
although she cannot recall dates/durations.  She denies fevers,
runny nose, and sick contacts although she says that people
around her have certainly had the common cold.
.
In the ED, she was given lasix 40 mg IV, prednisone 60 mg,
albuterol/ipratropium, azithromycin 500 mg, and
hydrocodone-acetaminophen.  CTA r/o'd PE and LENIs were negative
for DVT.  CXR prelim read concerning for mild CHF and evidence
of COPD.  Per ED resident, her sx improved dramatically with
above treament.
.
Currently,  she reports feeling "not good".  She continues to
complain of shortness of breath and leg swelling.  She feels
that she has been unable to normally perform activities of daily
life such as climbing a flight of stairs since her knee surgery
and would like to have her breathing problems resolved this
admission.  She continues to smoke and thinks she should start
drinking alcohol.  Current VS: 124/60  rr16 94% on3L HR 74
afebrile.

IMAGING:
[**2105-1-12**] CXR: Cardiomegaly, no definite signs of CHF or
pneumonia.
.
[**2105-1-12**] Bilateral LE LENI: No evidence of DVT.
.
[**2105-1-12**] CTA Chest:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Multiple stable bilateral pulmonary nodules.
3. Non-specific mildly prominent mediastinal and hilar lymph
nodes.
.
[**2105-1-13**] ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF 75%). The right ventricular free
wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is dilated
with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve is not
well seen. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased
transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Tricuspid
regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Compared with
the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2103-12-12**], the left ventricle now appears hyperdynamic. Diastolic
dysfunction of the left ventricle is likely present.
.
[**2105-1-13**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**1-12**], there is
increased
engorgement and indistinctness of pulmonary vessels, consistent
with the
clinical impression of elevated pulmonary venous pressure
related to volume overload. Otherwise, little change.
.
[**1-15**] CXR: Cardiomegaly is stable. There is no pneumothorax or
enlarging pleural effusions. Mild pulmonary edema is stable.
There are no new lung opacities.


Brief Hospital Course:
64F active smoker with h/o CHF (EF 40% [**2103-12-12**]) and COPD (on 3L
at home when compliant) who presents with worsening dyspnea x 1
day.
.
# Shortness of Breath:
Patient taken to the floor, given 40mg IV Lasix, started on 60mg
prednisone, continued on Azithromycin 500mg, and initially
saturating 90% on 3L NC. Overnight, patient desaturated to
70-80%, stat CXR showed worsening fluid overload, switched to 5L
by FM and placed on continuous O2 monitoring and was given nitro
SL for possible flash pulmonary edema. ABG showed worsening CO2
retention. Antibiotic coverage was broadened to IV
vancomycin/cefepime. Patient was also noted to be intermittently
somnolent, so was transferred to the MICU for further
evaluation. CTA chest was negative for PE. An ECHO showed
diastolic dysfunction with an EF 75%. Given the CXR findings,
elevated BNP, and LE edema, the hypoxia was felt to be partially
secondary to decompensated heart failure, though unknown
trigger. Lasix was held given relative hypotension and
aggressive diuresis on the floor. Given her wheezing and cough
