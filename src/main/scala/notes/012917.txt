Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath, falls


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catherization

History of Present Illness:
78 y.o male with past hx of CABGx2 15 years ago complicated by
left hemothorax, CHF with systolic and diastolic dysfunction,
afib, and hx of melena here with complaint of shortness of
breath and falls and evaluation for potential catherization.  He
had a recent admission from [**8-24**] to [**9-1**] at LRGH for GI bleed,
had upper and lower endoscopy with capsule, no source of
bleeding was found.  Patient had been on coumadin, this had been
stopped given his long term melena and since then his melena has
stopped (now 3 days without melena).
.
He had been doing well at home until [**9-15**] when he had a fall and
could not get up.  He was taken to LRGH again and found to be in
CHF with BNP to ~[**2098**].  He was diuresed there, and then
transferred here for possible right and left heart
catherization.
.
The patient reports that he has been having shortness of breath
for 3 years duration, and 1 month ago began to retain water in
his legs.  He also has had recent falls, beginning in the last 6
months.  He describes that he has no dizziness or palpitations
prior to falling, but that his legs just feel weak and will
suddenly give out on him.  He remains conscious throughout these
episodes, and is usually able to get up on his own with the
exception of his most recent fall.  His fall prior to last, he
hit his head and went to the ED, but apparently had a negative
head CT.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
[**2108-9-20**] C.Cath- 1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful PCI of the RCA.

[**2108-9-23**]  Angio: Early active GI bleeding at the splenic flexure
in the colon.

[**2108-10-3**]  ECHO: The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %) with global hypokinesis.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with mild global free
wall hypokinesis. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function
is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid
regurgitation.] The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
78 y.o male with past hx of CABGx2 15 years ago complicated by
left hemothorax, CHF with systolic and diastolic dysfunction,
afib, and hx of melena here with complaint of shortness of
breath and falls.
.
#CAD - The patient underwent a staged catherization during which
he had angioplasty of his left circumflex and subsequent
placement of a bare metal stent to his RCA.  The patient was
started on aspirin and plavix.  He also received 18 hours of
integrelin post-stent. Plavix was continued for 2 weeks from the
day of stnet placement.  Due to GI bleed and per cardiology, ASA
was held.  Several weeks post PCI placement, ASA and plavis were
resumed after stability of hematocrit was assured.
.
#ACUTE EXACERBATION OF CHRONIC HEART FAILURE - The patient was
found to still be in some degree of congestive heart failure
given his elevated JVP and crackles on exam.  Given his aortic
stenosis, he was diuresed initially with 20 IV lasix and then
40mg PO lasix [**Hospital1 **]. He was then intubated prior to endoscopy
while in the MICU given his tenous cardiopulmonary status.  He
received a total of 14 units pRBCs and was significantly volume
overloaded.  Diuresis was hld due to renal failure and
hypotension.  Due to significant pulmonary edema contributing to
respiratory failure, Lasix was started.
.
#GI bleed - The patient had one episode of BRBPR just prior to
his first intervention, however his hematocrit was stable.  He
had one further episode post catherization and his crit dropped
from ~28 to 25.1 on [**9-21**].  He was transfused one unit of blood,
however, his crit dropped further to 23 the day after and he was
transferred to the unit.  The nadir of his Hct was 19. He was
transfused a total of 11 units PRBC, 2 units FFP, 2 bags of
platelets on [**2108-9-22**] (the day of his transfer). He underwent
endoscopy, which was normal. He had a tagged bleeding scan,
which was positive in the splenic flexure. He then underwent
embolization of the [**Female First Name (un) 899**] branches by angio. He had one further
episode of maroon stools, and was transfused one unit
prophylactically.  His hematocrit remained stable and he
required no further transfusion.
.
#Thrombocytopenia - It was noted that the patient had an acute
drop in his platelet count from admission of >50%.  The patient
had documented exposure to heparin on [**9-15**], and therefore
suspicion for heparin induced thrombocytopenia was high.
Heparin dependent antibodies returned positive, however, f/u
test were negative.  Given the timing and resoution of his
thrombocytopenia, integrelin induced thrombocytopenia was
suspected.
.
# Respiratory failure - Pt as determined to be in respiratory
failure due to volume overload [**1-30**] to fluid resucitation.  He
was diuresed aggressivly which improved pulmonary status and
improved ventilator requirements.  Extubation was attempted
however he developed a collpase of his lung due to mucus
plugging.  He underwent bronchoscopy, became hypoxic and was
reintubated.  He again underwent agressive diuresis, pt self
extubated became hypoxic and again required extubation.
Finally, he was extubated as ventilator was weaned and he
sustained a SBT for 2 hrs.  He again became acutely dyspneic,
most likely due to generalized myopathy.  He became distressed
but refused reintuation.  He was made comfort measures only,
started on a morphine drip to reduce air hunger, and passed away
several hours later.
.
#Myopathy - Unclear why, but pt appeared to have significant
difficulty with respiratory effort despite prolonged breathing
trials with which he was successful.  Consulted neurology who
believed
