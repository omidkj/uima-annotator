Date of Birth:   [**2048-12-26**]       Sex:  F

Service:  MICU ORANG

ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:  Pneumonia/respiratory failure.

DICTATION COVERS [**3-27**] THROUGH DATE OF DISCHARGE

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE:  General - no acute
distress, alert, not oriented to place, time, but was
oriented to person and family members.  [**Name (NI) 4459**] exam - sclerae
clear.  Neck supple, full range of motion.  Extraocular
movements intact.  PERRL.  Cardiovascular exam - regular
rhythm and rate, no murmurs noted.  Pulmonary exam -
bilateral breath sounds.  Coarse upper airway sounds noted
bilaterally.  Minimal wheezing heard at the bases.  Abdominal
exam - nontender to palpation, nondistended, minimal bowel
sounds.  Extremities - 2+ pitting edema bilaterally in the
lower extremities.  No clubbing or cyanosis.

LABS AT DISCHARGE:  WBC 8.7, H&H 11/32.2, platelets 152.
Chem panel - sodium 135, potassium 3.6, chloride 94, bicarb
34, BUN 16, creatinine 0.8, blood sugar 146, calcium 7.7, mag
25, phosphorus 2.4.

CHEST X-RAY AT DISCHARGE:  Showed right lower lobe pneumonia
consolidation.  No failure was noted.

HOSPITAL COURSE SINCE LAST DICTATION - 1) RESPIRATORY
FAILURE/PNEUMONIA:  The patient had an unremarkable course
after the placement of a tracheostomy.  The patient was put
on a trach mask and tolerated it well.  Gradual weaning off
the vent was attempted.  The patient was evaluated for a
speaking Muir valve and one was placed.  Chest x-ray revealed
continual consolidation.  However, the patient remained
largely afebrile with a low-grade temp spike of 100.1 on the
night of [**3-30**].  The patient remained afebrile thereafter.

2) SEPTIC SHOCK:  At the time which this discharge summary
covers, the patient remained actually  hypertensive.  The
patient was on labetalol drip.  The patient's oral
medications were titrated appropriately to wean the patient
off the labetalol drip.  The patient also had a continual
sinus tachycardia which remained until the patient's
metoprolol was titrated appropriately.

3) ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  The patient's creatinine did not
again reach abnormal levels.  The patient remained within
normal limits for renal function throughout the remainder of
the hospital stay.

4) LEFT PLEURAL EFFUSION:  No further thoracentesis was
performed for the left pleural effusion.  Minimal residual
effusion was noted on chest x-ray, but was nonsignificant
clinically.

5) COPD:  The patient remained minimally wheezing throughout
the remainder of the stay.  However, the patient was given
standing nebulizer treatments and responded well.  The
patient remained on a prednisone taper at time of discharge.

6) ANEMIA:  At the time of this dictation, the patient's
anemia had largely resolved and had returned to baseline of
low-30s and remained so throughout the remainder of hospital
course stay.

7) CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  The patient remained fluid
overloaded throughout the hospital course stay by exam.
However, the patient's respiratory status continued to
improve, and the patient was able to remain largely off the
vent throughout the day.  The patient will continue CHF meds
as an outpatient.

8) ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY:  The patient was attempted to taper
off the prednisone course started for her COPD.  However, it
appeared that the taper was premature.  Therefore, the
patient was restarted on prednisone 60 mg and will follow a
more gradual course of tapering as an outpatient.  The
patient tolerated the medication well and showed no other
signs of adrenal insufficiency.  IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT SHOULD
SHE HAVE ANY SIGNIFICAN STRESS IN THE FUTURE, ADRENAL
INSUFFICIENCY NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED, WITH AN APPROPRIATE
INCREASE IN HER STEROID RX

9) MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES:  Obtainment of proper GI nutrition
for the patient was also an issue for this hospital stay.
The patient did not tolerate NG tube placement well, and
repeatedly pulled out the NG tube despite restraints.  The
placement of a PEG was discussed with family repeatedly.  At
the time of this dictation, the family was still considering
placement.  The patient will either go to rehab center that
will accept NG tube placement, or with a PEG placed.

The patient also throughout the hospital stay had sporadic
electrolyte issues due to her aggressive diuresis.  The
patient was repleted accordingly and had no clinical
manifestation of her electrolyte abnormalities.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

for tracheostomy.
