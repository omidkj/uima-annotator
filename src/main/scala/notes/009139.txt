 and resect P1 flail leaflet-[**2124-7-21**]


History of Present Illness:
79 year old gentleman with a history of mitral and tricuspid
regurgitation followed by serial echocardiogram. He recently

Aorta - Ascending:  *3.5 cm  <= 3.4 cm

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. Normal
interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated LV cavity. Overall normal LVEF
(>55%). [Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given
the severity of valvular regurgitation.]

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. Simple
atheroma in aortic arch. Normal descending aorta diameter.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. Torn mitral chordae. Moderate to
severe (3+) MR. [**Name13 (STitle) 15110**] to the eccentric MR jet, its severity may be
underestimated (Coanda effect).

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications.
Conclusions
PREBYPASS The left atrium is markedly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Torn mitral chordae are present. Moderate
to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the
eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be
significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). There is no
pericardial effusion.

POSTBYPASS The patient is not receiving inotropic support
post-CPB. There in no mitral regurgitation. An annuloplasty ring
is well-seated in the mitral position. The peak transmitral
gradient is 4 mm Hg at a cardiac output of 5.1 L/min.
Biventricular systolic function is preserved and all other
findings are consistent with pre-bypass findings. The aorta is
intact post-decannulation. All findings were discussed with the
surgeon intraoperatively.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr.[**Known lastname **] was admitted to the hospital the day prior for surgery
for Heparin bridge and groin ultrasound to evaluate for AV
fistula at cath site. Vascular was consulted for assessment of
his right groin hematoma and no intervention was required. He
was brought to the operating room on [**2124-7-21**] where he  underwent
 Mitral Valve repair (#30mm CE Physio II ring/resection of P1
flail)with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **]. Please see Dr[**Last Name (STitle) **] operative report
for further details. Overall the patient tolerated the procedure
well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. POD 1 found the
patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.
 The patient was neurologically
