EKG: Afib with [**Month/Day/Year 5509**]
.
ECHO [**11-3**]:
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal regional and low normal
global systolic function. Normal right ventricular cavity size
with mild free wall hypokinesis. Mild-moderate mitral
regurgitation. Small secundum type atrial septal defect.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2109-12-16**],
biventricular systolic function is less vigorous, a small
secundum type atrial septal defect is now suggested, and the
peak transmitral A wave velocity is more depressed.

Brief Hospital Course:
78 M with h/o Afib s/p PVI [**11/2107**] on fleicanide, DM, HTN, HL,
who presented in Afib and heart failure with symptoms of DOE and
palpitations x3wks, now s/p DCCV complicated by hypotension.
.
# Afib with [**Name (NI) 5509**] - Pt presented with palpitations and DOE similar
to episode of afib with [**Name (NI) **] in [**2105**]. Pt now presents with Afib
with [**Year (4 digits) **] and clinical evidence of volume overload (bilateral
crackles, elevated jvp). Increased flecainide to 150mg [**Hospital1 **] on
day of admission with PRN metoprolol for further rate control.
HR still not optimally controlled despite increased flecanide
and metoprolol doses and patient continued having episodes of
palpitations and tachycardia. Pt underwent TEE and cardioversion
on [**11-3**]. His Flecainide was discontinued and pt was started on
amiodarone. Home aspirin was continued. After the cardioversion
procedure patient went to the CCU due to hypotension. He
remained asymptomatic throughout his stay in the CCU. His blood
pressure slowly trended into the normal range. The episode of
hypotension (sbp in 80s, with MAP of 60s) was attributed to the
response to medications given while on the medical floor as well
as in the procedure suite.
.
# DOE: On admission pt had clinical evidence of volume overload,
likely due to poor forward flow from Afib. He was diuresed with
IV lasix with some improvement of symptoms. In the CCU he denied
any SOB and was satting well on room air. He had some sleep
apnea at night but continued to sat above 90% on room air.
.
# HTN: Blood pressure well controlled during hospital stay off
Lisinopril and Imdur.
.
# DM: Home metformin was held during hospital stay and at
discharge. Glipizide was restarted at discharge.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: continued home atorvastatin.
.
# Acute on Chronic renal insufficiency: pt with baseline
1.1-1.5. Creatinine increased and peaked at 2.3, [**Month (only) **] to 1.8 on
day of discharge. [**Last Name (un) **] possibly due to poor forward flow from
Afib with [**Last Name (un) 5509**] as well as IV diuresis. Metformin, Lisinopril,
aldactezide and Imdur were held and not restarted at discharge.
Pt should have a chem-7 and INR drawn by the VNA on [**2110-11-6**] with
results to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3357**] on [**11-7**].
