Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Morphine / Percocet / Codeine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4679**]
Chief Complaint:
Shoulder pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC placement [**2119-8-15**]; Surgery for hiatal hernia
[**2119-8-16**] 1. Laparoscopic reduction of giant paraesophageal
hernia.
Primary repair of diaphragm. Laparoscopic G tube. Endoscopy.


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year-old female with CAD, thoracic aortic aneurysm, large
hiatal hernia, and gastritis admitted with shoulder pain. Pain
began approximately 3PM on day prior to admission. Described as
'ache', not associated with movement, chest pain, palpitations,
shortness of breath, or palpitations. Patient also with nausea.
Reports she has had previous pain in the past, but not to this
severity or duration. Per discussion with patient's daughter
([**Name (NI) **]) and review of [**Name (NI) **], pain previously attributed in part
to uncontrolled GERD. Following onset of pain, patient took 2
[**Name (NI) 9181**] without relief. Given persistence of pain, she called EMS.
Unclear if this is her anginal equivalent. Per discussion with
patient's daughter, daughter-in-law, often has 'attacks' of
gassy pain with radiation to left shoulder, at times associated
with nausea. Episodes often precipitated by eatting out. This
episode different due to severity/persistence of pain.
.
In the ED, 98 68 106/63 16 100%RA. Left shoulder pain initially
thought to be cardiac equivalent. BP came down to 90/50s soon
after admission, attributed to [**Name (NI) 9181**]. Blood pressure improved
with fluid bolus. First set cardiac biomarkers within normal
limits. EKG showed atrial fibrillation (known), without acute
ischemic changes. CTA showed stable thoracic aortic aneurysm.
Patient subsequently developed abdominal pain, nausea. Lipase
mildly elevated at 65; LFTs within normal limits. CT
abdomen/pelvis noncontrast showed large hiatal hernia and many
renal cysts, no acute change from prior imaging studies. She
received antiemetics (Zofran, Ativan, compazine, phenergan),
acetaminophen, IVF NS 2-3L. On transfer, 98.6, 95 (afib),
106/52, 16, 97%RA. HR occasionally to 120s, hemodynamic
stability.
.
On the floor, patient is drowsy and unable to provide history.
She reports left shoulder pain, nausea. She denies chest pain,
shortness of breath, abdominal pain.
.
Review of sytems:  (limited because patient is drowsy)
(+) Per HPI.  Reports intermittent constipation, last BM
yesterday morning.
(-) Denies fever, chills. Denies sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea.
Denies cough, shortness of breath. Denies chest pain or
tightness, palpitations. No recent change in bowel or bladder
habits. No dysuria.

CXR: [**2119-8-22**] FINDINGS: Since the previous study, the left
paraesophageal thoracic hernia is unchanged which is distended
with air and contains barium. This is associated with a large
left pleural effusion with atelectasis and displacement of the
mediastinum to the right.
There is also a moderate right pleural effusion with fluid in
the horizontal fissure.

Esphogus: [**2119-8-19**] FINDINGS: With the patient at approximately
45-degree incline, thin barium was orally administered which
transited through the esophagus, passed the GE junction and into
the proximal stomach. There was approximately one hour delay of
transit of contrast from the proximal stomach, which was now
supradiaphragmatic, into the more distal stomach, which was
subdiaphragmatic. The more subdiaphragmatic portion of the
stomach is approximately one-third of the total volume of the
stomach and contains a PEG tube. Residual contrast from prior
examinations is present in the colon. Marked bibasilar
atelectasis is present. On the initial fluoroscopic image, no
contrast was present in the intrathoracic stomach from the prior
examination one day ago.

CCT/Pelvic [**2119-8-18**]: IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of bowel obstruction, or herniation of bowel
loops through the hiatal defect. Fluid density structure at the
right lower mediastinum appears to represent fluid filling the
previous intrathoracic hernia sac, or possibly postsurgical
change secondary to mobilization of omentum.
2. Complex air and oral contrast-filled structure in the left
lower chest
could represent re-herniated stomach, with areas of redundant
folds collapsed on itself. However, gastric perforation/leak
cannot be excluded, and contrast-swallow evaluation is
recommended for further evaluation.
3. Stable appearance of ascending aortic dilatation, better
characterized on recent contrast-enhanced CTA of the chest.
CCT/Pelvic:[**2119-8-14**]  Minimal interval enlargement of the
ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm, now measuring 4.9 x 4.4 cm.
There is no evidence of dissection or pulmonary embolism.
2. Interval enlargement and a large hiatal hernia

PICC line [**2119-8-15**]: Left PICC line passes deep into the right
atrium, at least 8 cm beyond the superior cavoatrial junction. N
