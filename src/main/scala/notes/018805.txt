Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
No Allergies/ADRs on File

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with two bare metal stents placed to the
RCA


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]F with HTN, macular degenration, without known CAD with new
RCA STEMI s/p BMS x2.
.
Mrs [**Known lastname 46690**] first felt unwell at about 9:30 this morning. She
later developed [**2120-4-6**] chest pressure that radiated to her L arm
as well as nausea. She waited 15 minutes then her nephew brought
her to [**Hospital1 18**] where an EKG showed STE in II III AVF, with neg
troponin, a code STEMI was called and she was taken to the cath
lab. There she was found to have a tight stenosis of the
proximal RCA and complete occlusion of the distal RCA. These
lesions were angioplastied and two BMS were placed. She was also
noted to have 80-90% proximal LAD and 60-70% Circ stenoses. Her
CP completely resolved. Her groin was closed with a closure
device though she still had some oozing from the site.
.
Of note she has been having chest pressure associated with
exertion for approximately 1 year. She denies orthopnea or PND.
By report she does take some pill for lower extremity edema but
denies CHF history. There is a question of a possible CVA or TIA
in the past year. She also has someone stay with her 24 hours a
day because of forgetfulness.
.
On review of systems, she denies deep venous thrombosis,
pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias,
joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She
denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional
buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were
negative. However because of her mental status this history may
not be entirely accurate.

EKG [**10-23**]
Baseline artifact at the end of the tracing. ST segment
elevation in
leads II, III, aVF and V6 with ST segment depression in the
lateral and
the anterior precordial leads suggestive of acute injury,
probable myocardial infarction. Poor R wave progression across
the precordium - cannot rule out prior anterior myocardial
infarction. No previous tracing available for comparison.

CATH [**10-23**]
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated 3 vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had
mild
plaquing, and a 20% ostial lesion.  The proximal LAD was noted
to have
an 80-90% stenosis.  It was notable for a cuff adequate for
endovascular
treatment of this lesion without necessarily involving the LMCA.
 It was
noted to be very heavily calcified, and would thus consider
rotablation.
The LCx had a proximal 60-70% lesion.  The RCA had a thrombotic
occlusion of the distal RCA.  There was also a tight calcific
lesion
noted in the proximal RCA.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic arterial
normotension
with a central aortic pressure of 128/68, mean 94 mmHg.
3. Successful PCI to the dRCA lesion with a 3.5x18mm Vision BMS
and the
pRCA with a 3.5x15mm Vision BMS.
4. Perclose to the Right CFA.
5. No complications.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Thrombotic lesion in the distal RCA with notable disease in
the LAD
and LCx as well.
2. Systemic arterial normotension.
3. Successful PCI to the dRCA and pRCA with two Vision BMS.
4. No complications of the procedure.
5. Patient is to remain on aspirin indefinitely and clopidogrel
for at
least 9-12 months given the setting of an acute MI.

EKG [**10-24**]
Baseline artifact. Sinus rhythm. Q waves in leads III and aVF
with
deep T wave inversion in the inferior and lateral precordial
leads, consistent with an evolving inferior myocardial
infarction. Poor R wave progression in leads V1-V3 suggestive of
a prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2121-10-23**] the diffuse T wave inversions are
new, as are the inferior Q waves, consistent with evolution of
the previously seen inferior myocardial infarction pattern.

ECHO: [**10-24**]
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 35 %) secondary to inferior, posterior, and
lateral hypokinesis. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The
right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with depressed free wall
contractility. The aortic
