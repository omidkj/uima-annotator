Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Coreg / Lopressor

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea and hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Catheterization for PFO closure

History of Present Illness:
88 yo f with known ASD, CHF (EF 35%), paroxysmal a-fib, s/p DDD
pacemaker/icd and multiple admission for hypoxia, presented from
[**Last Name (un) 14991**] NH with episodes of hypoxia/hypotension (Sbp of 80s).
Patient with 18 month history of intermittent hypoxia which was
last evaluated here in [**2181-9-14**] with echo showed possible ASD and
PFTs showed restrictive lung pattern.  She was discharged on O2
supplement at 4L NC.  Since her echo showed 35% ef, her hypoxia
was thought to be multifactorial.  She was also evaluated at
[**Location (un) **] 4 weeks ago for similar episode and discharged to NH on
6 L non-rebreather.  Patient also reports L rib pain.  In ED,
EKG showed left bundle without new ST/T changes.  However, trop
was elevated at 0.12, which was new compared to last admission.
Her chest CT was negative for PE or pneumonia.  ABG: 7.45/39/61.
 Patient was given prednisone for possible reactive airway
disease and levofloxacin for possible UTI given positive
urinalysis.  She was also given 1.2L of fluid for resuscitation
with (BP up to 90s).  However, she still has intermittent
hypoxic episodes that spontaneously resolve.  She remained
afebrile with normal lactate level of 1.2.


Past Medical History:
1. CHF (EF 30%, 1+ MR, 1+ TR, significant pulmonary
regurgitation, multifocal AK/HK on TTE [**7-14**])
2. DDD pacemaker and ICD placement for sick sinus syndrome and
NSVT
3. paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
4. pre-syncope
5. pneumonia
5. hypothyroidism
6. hyperparathyroidism
7. GERD
8. L3 fracture and cauda equina syndrome s/p L2/L3 laminectomy
c/b residual severe LBP
9. osteopenia
10. obstructive sleep apnea
11. urinary retention
12. dysphagia
13. depression

Social History:
The patient normally lives at home with husband, who has
Alzheimer??????s dementia. She has a full-time male aide for her
husabnd, and "a woman" who comes into the home a few times a
week.  She has been at an extended care facility in the recent
months due to intermittent hypoxia and hypotension.  She's never
smoked cigarettes, and denies any alcohol use. The patient has 3
married daughters, one of whom is an anesthesiologist at this
hospital.

Family History:
No known history of coronary artery disease, otherwise
non-contributory.

Physical Exam:
Vitals: 96.5, 95/49. 64. 17. 95%4LNC
Gen: cachectic but comfortable
HEENT: no JVP
CV: RRR
Lungs: CTAB
Abd: soft, NT
Ext: no edema
neur: A&A and able to answer questions appropriately

Pertinent Results:
[**2181-12-17**] echo:
LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Dilated RA. A catheter or
pacing wire is seen
in the RA and/or RV. Aneurysmal interatrial septum. Rght-to-left
shunt across
the interatrial septum at rest.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated LV cavity. Moderate global LV
hypokinesis.
Moderately depressed LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
MR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor parasternal
views.
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is dilated. The
interatrial
septum is aneurysmal. A right-to-left shunt across the
interatrial septum is
seen at rest.
2. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is
moderate global
left ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is
moderately depressed.
3. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
aortic
regurgitation is seen.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.

Cath [**2182-1-3**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Venous access via the RFA using a 8F short sheath.
2. Initial hemodynamics demonstrated a mean RA pressure of 6 mm
hg, RV
pressure 37/5 mm hg.
3. Successful closure of the PFO with a 35 mm amplatzer PFO
occluded
device. Post procedure  bubble study with cough was positive,
but the o2
saturation remained >95% in the sitting position.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. PFO with symptomatic orthodeoxia.
2. Successful closure of the PFO.

[**2182-1-7**]: Hct 30.1, INR 2.1


Brief Hospital Course:
She remained stable on the floor during the first 2 days and
finished 48 hrs of IV heparin drip for NSTEMI with trop trended
downwards.  However, on the scheduled day of discharge, she had
a prolonged episode of hypoxia with O2 sat down to 70s% while on
NRB in the morning.  However, she remained relatively
asymptomatic (normal mental status, normotensive, speaking full
sentences, no tachycardia, tachypnea, chest pressure or dyspnea)
despite the severe hypoxia until she was given a slNTG for trial
of vasodilator for presumed pulmonary hypertension when her O2
sat went down to 50s% with development of chest pain and
dyspnea.  She quickly improved, however, with some IVF.  She had
remained stable since the early afternoon until the next morning
when she had another similar episode of hypoxia.

She was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and noted to have orthodeoxia.
Bedside echo showed functional tricuspid stenosis in the sitting
position, which causes increased right to left shunt via the
known PFO due to the increased right side pressure.  She was
instructed to lying flat to minimize the right to left shunt to
avoid severe hypoxia.  She was evaluated by cardiac surgery and
interventional cardiology for PFO repair.

Because the patient was deemed a poor surgical candidate due to
incrased risks from comorbidities, she was referred for
percutaneous closure of the PFO.  The device, however, had been
recalled by the manufaturer, and would not be available for two
weeks.  The patient remained in the hospital given her poor
functional status, and the device arrived early.  She was
anticoagulated with heparin pending hte procedure, and Coumadin
was restarted thereafter.  Successful procedure was performed
[**2182-1-3**] and pt was able to sit up without desaturating
thereafter. She tolerated the procedure well with a small
hematoma ensuing.

1) PFO: Now s/p procedure.  Light activity tolerated in terms of
O2 sats, patient able to sit up.  Limitation is primarily
deconditioning.

contaminated.  Bactrim x 7 day course.
5) Hypothyroid: Continue Levothyroxine
6) Hyperparathyroid: Calcitonin
7) Vaginal itching: Treat minor yeast infxn, imidazole cream x 7
days
8) Anemia: Stools guaiac negative, pt transfused one unit [**1-6**].
 Anemia likley [**2-12**] phlebotomy, chronic disease and poor
nutrition.  Pt also had small, stbale hematoma s/p cath.
9) Depression/Anxiety: Continue Ativan (prn) and Paxil, social
work following.
8) FEN: Low sodium plus shakes
9) PPx: bowel regimen
10) Code: DNR/DNI, has ICD
