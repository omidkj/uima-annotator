Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**]
Chief Complaint:
hip pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
hip reduction

History of Present Illness:
This is a 72 year-old male with PMH of diastolic heart failure
with an EF=65%, AS s/p mechanical AVR, AF on coumadin, CAD s/p
CABG, pulmonary hypertension, 3rd degree heart block s/p PPM,
and severe COPD who was discharged to LTAC yesterday after a
month-long hospitalization for MRSA bacteremia secondary to a
PICC line complicated by left prostethic hip seeding requiring
OR washout and prolonged intubation after the procedure who now
presents with worsening left hip pain and evidence of
dislocation on an X-ray taken at his LTAC. The patient was
delirious at time of discharge and unable to effectively
communicate that he was having pain in his left hip. According
to the patient's son, his mental status quickly cleared at the
LTAC and he was able to report severe pain in his left hip. This
provoked the LTAC to obtain X-rays of the hip which showed
dislocation necessitating transfer back to [**Hospital1 18**] for ortho
evaluation. He remains on vanco for MRSA bacteremia to complete
a 6 week course per ID recommendations and still has his midline
in place.
.
In the emergency department initial vital signs were 99.2, 83,
108/56, 16, 99% 2L NC. He was later noted to have a fever of
102, but his son says that he did not feel as though the patient
had a fever because he did not feel warm and his temperature
resolved quickly to 99, although he was given 1gm of Tylenol. He
received 500cc of IVFs for SBP in the 90s and his SBP climbed to
110s. He also received Zosyn 4.5gms as a CXR in the ED could not
r/o PNA and his vanco level was checked at 16.7. An EKG showed
atrial fibrillation and no changes from his prior. Orthopedics
was consulted and his hip was reduced under conscious sedation
with propofol. Repeat films after the hip manipulation showed
successful relocation of the hip. He was admitted for documented
fever on vanco in the setting of low SBP to the 90s.
.
On arrival in the ICU the patient was alert, pleasant, and
conversational. The son notes that the patient's mental status
improved dramatically after his hip was put back into place by
ortho and postulates that his delirium was likely related to
pain. Otherwise, the patient has no complaints and did not feel
febrile in the ED. He feels as though he is improved from the
time he was discharged.

course.  This brief admission is summarized below.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
This is a 72 year-old male with PMH of diastolic heart failure
with an EF=65%, AS s/p mechanical AVR, AF on coumadin, CAD s/p
CABG, pulmonary hypertension, 3rd degree heart block s/p PPM,
and severe COPD who was discharged to LTAC yesterday after a
month-long hospitalization for MRSA bacteremia secondary to a
PICC line complicated by left prostethic hip seeding requiring
OR washout and prolonged intubation after the procedure who now
presents with worsening left hip pain and evidence of
dislocation on an X-ray taken at his LTAC.  The dislocated hip
was reduced under conscious sedation  in the ED.

#. Fever:  The patient was asymptomatic and it is unclear if
this was a real fever.  All of his labs, his urinalysis, and his
chest xray appeared improved from prior.  His blood pressure was
also >90 systolic, an improvement from his recent baseline.
There was no evidence of new infection.  Vancomycin was
continued for the recent MRSA bacteremia. This was redosed for
his improved renal function..
.
#. Left prosthetic hip dislocation. The patient was having
significant pain that was relieved by manipulation of his hip
joint back into proper alignment.  Ortho recommended continuing
the abduction pillow between his legs until his follow up
appointment on [**12-6**].  He may weight bear as tolerated by taking
the pillow off temporarily and using posterior hip precautions.
.
#. Aortic stenosis s/p AVR: INR was subtherapeutic at 1.5 on
admission. Heparin gtt was continued with a goal PTT of 40-60.
His INR goal remains on the lower side with a goal INR of
1.8-2.2 given his propensity for bleeding.  Heparin drip was
continued and coumadin increased to 2 mg daily.

#. Acute kidney injury. Previous baseline creatinine was 1.5 to
2.0. His creatinine peaked at 3.9 his last admission secondary
to ATN. His creatinine was improved to 2.6 this admission.
.
#. COPD: Continue home Flovent, albuterol, ipratropium, and
tiotropium.
.
#. FEN: Regular diet
.
#. CODE STATUS: DNR (no chest compressions), but OK to intubate
