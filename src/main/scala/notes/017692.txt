Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 64**]
Chief Complaint:
left hip pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
removal of left femur intramedullary rod and left hip
hemiarthroplasty with open reduction internal fixation of
greater trochanter on [**2184-10-27**]


History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with multiple medical problems
including diabetes, chf, cerebrovascular disease and chronic
renal insufficiency, who about 5 months ago, sustained a
multiple part intertrochanteric femur fracture that extended
down into the subtrochanteric level, calcar. This was treated by
another surgeon with an open reduction and internal fixation
utilizing an intramedullary rod. Unfortunately, the patient has
had cut out of the hardware
with complete failure, nonunion of the 4 part fracture,
shortening of the leg, persistent pain and no evidence of
ongoing healing. In order for the patient to become ambulatory
again and to restore leg length, it is necessary to remove
the hardware and to perform a complex revision operation.  The
patient is thus admitted electively following medical clearance
for the above procedure.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year-old female with past medical history cad, CHF, DM, and
cri underwent removal of left intramedullary nail and
hemiarthroplasty without complication.  She had an estimated
blood loss of one liter and received three liters of LR, two
units of PRBCs intraoperatively.  She spent the night following
surgery in the intensive care unit intubated.  She was extubated
without difficulty on post-operative day number one and her
hospitalization was complicated only by a brief episode of
demand ischemia. She was transferred out of the MICU on
post-operative day number four. The geriatric service followed
the patient for her entire hospital course. Her hospital course
by problems is as follows:

1) Respiratory Support: The patient spent the first night
following surgery on SIMV and was converted to pressure support
in the morning.  On pressure support she had excellent tidal
volumes and was breathing spontaneously.  She was thus extubated
without difficulty on post-operative day number one.  Her oxygen
requirement was subsequently weaned and at the time of discharge
she had a good saturation on room air.

2) S/p hemiarthroplasty:  The patient tolerated the procedure
well, although she did require transfusion of several units of
packed red blood cells post-operatively especially in the
setting of demand ischemia.  However, by postoperative day
number three her hematocrit had stabilized at between 27 and 30.
 She received one dose vancomycin postoperatively and 48 hours
of Ancef as prophylaxis.  When she began tolerating POs,
Coumadin was started with a Lovenox bridge.  She was maintained
in an abduction pillow at all times, with anterior hip
precautions, no active abduction, and 33% weightbearing.
However, as of post-operative day number five physical therapy
was only able to get the patient to sit at the edge of the bed.
The therapists attributed her slow progress to a combination of
deconditioning, pain, and her weight.  She was given oxycodone,
Tylenol, and tramadol for pain.

3) CHF with EF 40-45%:  The patient was over one liter positive
early in her postoperative course and had a chest x-ray
consistent with mild volume overload.  However, diuresis was
restarted with Lasix on post-operative day number two.  At no
point did she clinically appear to be acutely in heart failure.

4) Type II DM:  The patient's blood sugars were slightly high
usually in the mid 100s and occasionally in the low 300s.
However, given that her oral intake was less than usual we
decided to err on the side of conservative management by keeping
her on half of her usual dose of standing NPH and a gentle
regular insulin sliding scale.

5) CRI:  The patient's creatinine remained below baseline for
the majority of her admission.  She did require several fluid
boluses early in her post-operative course.

6) Demand Ischemia:  On postoperative day number two the patient
began to complain of chest pressure.  Her EKG demonstrated some
mild ST depression. This pressure quickly abated after
sublingual nitrate.  Her troponin increased to 0.2 and was 0.2
and 0.3 on subsequent tests.  The cardiology service was
consulted and they attributed her symptoms to ischemia secondary
to demand.  They recommended only restarting aspirin, her
statin, and titrating up her beta blocker.
