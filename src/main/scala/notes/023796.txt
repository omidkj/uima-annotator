Brief Hospital Course:
54 yo male with h/o asthma and HTN presenting with SOB and CP
radiating to back found to have a R apical pneumonia and
criteria for sepsis
.
# Septicemia: Patient hypotensive, tachycardic, WBC 23.5,
creatinine 2.0, lactate 1.9.  Likely source RUL PNA as UA
negative and no other localizing symptoms. down to 0.9 after
IVF.  She received azithomycin and ceftriaxone in the ED and was
then changed to high dose levofloxacin.  She responded rapidly
to early goal directed therapy with rapid drops in her lactate,
WBC, and creatinine. She briefly required pressors to maintain
her MAP>65 but was quickly weaned off.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim test was
adequate and she was not started on steroids. Blood cultures
grew pan-sensitive strep pneumo. Surveillance cultures remain no
growth to date and an ECHO showed no evidence of a vegetation.
While on the floor, antibiotics were changed to IV vancomycin
given rising temperature and wbc on levofloxacin, despite
improving pneumonia by CXR.  Further cephalosporin was deferred
given history of shortness of breath with penicillins.  Patient
was stable but with persistent leukocytosis and R sided pain.
Repeat CXR revealed a new R sided pleural effusion.  Under
ultrasound this was too small to drain.  A CT scan was not c/w
empyema.  Patient was switched back to levofloxacin and is to
complete 14 days total.  Continue inhalers at home.  Tylenol
prn.  Patient should have repeat CXR at follow up with PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 1
week to follow progression of effusion.   She was administered
the pneumovax and influenza vaccines at her next appointment if
she is not up to date.
.
# SOB/CP: Likely [**3-11**] PNA. Patient has no cardiac history and is
not diabetic. Cardiac enzymes and EKG were unremarkable. CTA
without PE or dissection.
.
# Hypertension:  Patient's home HCTZ restarted prior to
discharge.
.
# ARF: Baseline cre 0.9. Likely pre-renal in the setting of
sepsis. Making good urine. Cre improved from 2.0 to 0.8 with
IVF.

# Asthma: Seems to be mild at home. On flovent and albuterol.
Continued on flovent and nebs.
.
# h/o positive PPD: Per patient and record (+ PPD in [**2122**]), no
exposure and negative CXR.  Per patient has not been treated
previously.  Upper lobe pneumonia resolved with fluoroquinolone.
 No night sweats, hemoptysis or other concerning features for
TB.  Consider treatment in future with further discussion with
patient.
