History of Present Illness:
68 year old male with PMHx of AV block (presumed [**2-15**] Lyme
Disease, treated w/ ceftriaxone), hypertension, type 2 diabetes,
chronic kidney disease (Cr 2.0), inferior MI with systolic CHF
(EF 35%), several admissions for GI bleeds (most recently
[**2124-11-25**] with Dieulafoy) who presents with 2-3 loose dark
black stools yesterday evening. The patient also had some nausea
("stomach queasiness"), dyspnea on exertion yesterday but
otherwise asymptomatic - denies vomiting, lightheadedness,
hematemesis/coffee grounds, abdominal pain, chest pain. He
denies recent NSAID use, alcohol consumption or anticoagulation.
His last meal was yesterday evening and did not take his
medications this morning. He saw his [**Name8 (MD) 101577**] NP yesterday
(Dr.[**Name (NI) 79913**] office) who had started him on Furosemide and Slow
Fe, which he took one dose of each.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: T99.0, HR94, BP148/66 --> SBP110s,
RR20, 100% on 4L nasal cannula. He was found to have Hct 20.5,
down from baseline 26-28, found to be grossly guaiac positive
(although brown stools) and persistently tachycardic. He was
given IV reglan, Lasix 40mg IV, pantoprazole bolus + gtt and
started on 2 units pRBC. CXR for the shortness of breath was
within normal limits. GI is aware of the patient and recommended
no lavage, admit to ICU for EGD/colonoscopy.
.
On arrival to the MICU, T98.1, BP121/63, HR88, 99% on RA. The
patient is resting comfortably in bed, lying flat and
asymptomatic.
.
Review of systems:

** GI bleed history:

-[**8-/2124**]: a GIB at [**Year (4 digits) 16962**] (hct decreased to 20) [**2-15**] Dieulafoy's or
erosion in stomach, had normal colonoscopy at that time
-[**11/2124**]: upper GI bleed thought [**2-15**] Dieulafoy's and Barrett's
esophagus s/p two endoclips.
-[**Date range (1) 90311**]/[**2124**]: upper GI bleed with two endoscopies. 1st
endoscopy showed large clot. 2nd endoscopy demonstrated erythema
in the duodenal bulb compatible with duodenitis. A red spot was
visualized which was injected and given thermal therapy. Given
PPI drip and erythromycin (to help with GI motility to mobilize
visualized clot.

Brief Hospital Course:
68 year old male with AV block, hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease (Cr 2.0), inferior MI
with systolic CHF (EF 35%), several admissions for GI bleeds who
presents with dark loose stools, and found to have acute blood
loss anemia and angioectasia of his stomach, as well as
duodenitis, s/p clipping of angioectasia.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
#. Gastrointestinal bleed
#. Acute blood loss anemia
He was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and urgent
bedside EGD by GI service.  Transfused 2 units on arrival for
hct of 20.5, started on IV PPI drip and promotility dose
erythromycin.  EGD done shortly after arrival showed showed AVM
in the stomach, which looked to be the source of the bleed and
was endoclipped.  At this point, erythromycin was stopped.  He
had one more maroon stool following his procedure and was
transfused 1 more unit PRBCs, but his hct remained stable.   He
was transferred to the general medical floor on [**2125-1-20**], and
had no further bleeding.  His hematocrit on discharge was 29.

CHRONIC ISSUES:

# Hypertension: We held home lisinopril, metoprolol, and
furosemide on admission, given GI bleed and potential for
hemodynamic instability.  These were restarted at discharge.
.
# Chronic systolic CHF: ED 35% [**12/2124**] with significant
akinesis/hypokinesis. Was started on furosemide as an outpatient
the day prior to admission, however this was held on admission
given that he had a significant GI bleed and appeared to be
compensated.  He received furosemide 40 mg po x 1 on the day of
discharge, and patient instructed to take furosemide 20 mg
starting tomorrow.  ? if patient also taking hctz at home.  Med
is on [**Location (un) 2274**] EPIC medication list, but unclear he should be taking
both hctz and lasix concurrently, espcecially with creatinine of
2.2.  I have emailed PCP separately to discuss this.

# Type 2 diabetes: Complicated by CKD, retinopathy and
neuropathy.  Continued home lantus and humalog insulin sliding
scale
.
# Hyperlipidemia/coronary artery disease: Continued high-dose
atorvastatin
.
# First degree AV block: Thought to be secondary to Lyme disease
and completed ceftriaxone course [**2124-12-20**]. PR interval
previously 146, now 134
.
Key transitional issues:
1.  Recurrent GI bleeding:  He will need GI follow up in 2
weeks, for consideration of non-urgent endoscopy to assess the
etiology of his recurrent episodes of bleeding.
