History of Present Illness:
64 yo with h/o schizophrenia, mental retardation, CVA with
residual L sided deficit, and seizure d/o who presents from
group home with altered mental status.  Per group home, patient
is independent with ADLs at baseline and was well all day today
until 9:30pm, when she was noted to have upper extremity and
head "flinches."  Per group home, patient thought that she was
having a seizure.  Shortly after, she "stopped talking" and
became "unresponsive" x ?1h despite being awake.  Patient "not
herself."  Also had more trouble ambulating. Not much
information came with patient from group home; history obtained
from the case worker who accompanied the patient.  Patient
denies HA/visual changes/CP/SOB/abd pain and complains of
needing to urinate despite having a foley in place.

ED course: Patient initially tachycardic to 130's with BP
122/60.  HR to 80s with 500cc fluid bolus.  However, pt became
hypotensive to 67/37 and dopamine gtt started.  Also given
Narcan, ASA, Ceftriaxone, and Flagyl.  LP performed in ED and
was unremarkable.

EKG: ST @133, nl intervals, nl axis, ST depression I,aVL, V3-6

Head CT: Study limited by patient motion. No intracranial
hemorrhage or mass effect.

CXR:1. Stable appearance of retrocardiac opacity that was imaged
on the recent chest CT, which may represent sequestration,
sequela of prior granulomatous infection, however a neoplastic
process cannot be fully excluded.  2. Stable calcified
mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes.  3. No congestive heart
failure or new focal consolidations.


Brief Hospital Course:
64 yo f w/ h/o MR, sz d/o on depakote, CVA who p/w altered MS in
setting of questionable sz episode, initially normotensive in
ED, w/ subsequent hypotension requiring dopamine gtt.  In [**Name (NI) **] pt
rec'd only 500ml NS, underwent head ct and LP both of which were
negative and was covered w/ ceftriaxone, flagyl (?), and started
on dopamine drip, eventually requiring up to 18 mics.  Admitted
to MICU, titrated off dopamine gtt over several hours and
subsequently remained normotensive, w/ MAPs>70, but tachycardic
in the 110s to 120s.  Tachycardia resolved with additional 2L
IVF.
.
1) Altered Mental Status- CVA vs seizure vs infection vs
toxic/metabolic (h/o hyperparathyroid, although calcium not very
elevated). Depakote level nl, so sz less likely but by no means
ruled out given the compelling story.  No ongoing evidence of
infxn: ruled out for meningitis (completely aseptic), nl wbcc,
afebrile. Urine and blood cultures negative.  CXR clr.  On
discharge PTH level still pending (although calcium normal).
Unclear etiology of this episode.  Felt likely related to
previous seizure prior to arival in hospital w/ prolonged
postictal period.  Patient scheduled for outpatient Neurology
follow up.
.
2. [**Name (NI) **] unclear etiology.  Pt with h/o hyperparathyroid.
 Other possibilities included hypovolemia, sepsis, cardiogenic
etiology.  No obvious source of infection to support sepsis
since blood and urine culture remained negative. TTE nl, [**Last Name (un) 104**]
stim was appropriate.  Felt likely related to hypovolemia given
response to fluid administration.
.
3. Dynamic EKG changes- EKG with demand ischemia.  No history of
CAD/MI.
Ruled out for MI.  TTE without significant abnormalities.
Started on aspirin while in house.
.
4. prophylaxis- continued on pneumoboots, bowel regimen while in
house.
.
