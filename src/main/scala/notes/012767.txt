CHF Exacerbation

none


History of Present Illness:
72-year-old male with a history of systolic CHF with the last EF
being 15% here in 4/[**2113**].  He presented to [**Hospital1 882**] yesterday
morning with SOB. In ED he was thought to be volume up as the
CXR showed R effusion and mild edema. Got lasix 40mg IV and he
felt better. He put out 1600cc urine. He had a low grade temp to
100.3, a WBC of 13 and ?right sided infiltrate and was started
on vanco and ceftazidime. He was admitted to ICU as was
transiently in BiPAP and was off by the time he arrived there,
on 2L NC and comfortable.
.
While in the ICU, his weight was 183lbs (Dry weight [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital1 882**]
is 180, here it is listed as 198). Additional diuresis was
attempted with 40mg IV lasix but to no avail. Creatinine rose
from 0.74 to 1.38. His respiratory status remained at baseline,
with no shortness of breath.  He was ready to go out to floor
with presumed acute sCHF and ?PNA but then went into AF with RVR
with a pressure of 98 after 5 of lopressor IV.  He was noted to
be cool and ?clamped down and his fingers were blue. He received
250cc IVF and 150 mg IV amiodarone. An ABG was 7.18/42/66/18
while on 5L nasal cannula with a bicarb of 22 a lactate of 4.
There was thought that the AF resulted in transient
hypoperfusion causing lactic acidosis.
.
With the above lopressor and amiodarone, his AF broke. His
rhythm returned to a paced rhythm.  He reportedly felt better,
however shortly thereafter, he again had an episode of feeling
poorly. He was not in AF but was hypotensive to 70-80's with
intermittent PVC's/paced and there was concern that maybe he was
not perfusing then. His BP normalized with no intervention, but
on physical examination, his carotid pulse was felt only on
every 3rd beat when compared to telemetry. He was placed on
dobutamine 2mg for inotropy.
.
A repeat lactate was 7.4 but he was not complaining of any
localizing symptoms. Manual BP measurement was shown to be
90/60mmHg. CXR was repeated and was unchanged (no change in
?infiltrate seen on admission).  Blood and urine cultures were
negative. The WBC decreased to 7.4.  He was started on a heparin
gtt as he had a history of PE while on coumadin and has an IVC
filter in pace.  INR was 1.2 on admission so it was unclear if
he was taking his coumadin. His chest was not scanned in light
of his ARF. Also reportedly has h/o TIA.
.
He was transferred here as volume status was felt to be
difficult to assess. On transfer, he had low BP's and was
started on peripheral levophed.
.
On arrival to to the CCU, he had an entirely negative ROS
including no CP, SOB, abd pain, diarrhea, dysuria, cough,
headache, back pain or leg pain.
.
On review of systems, he denied any prior history of stroke,
deep venous thrombosis, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. He denied recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denied
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems was notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
