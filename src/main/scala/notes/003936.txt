Admission Date:  [**2141-6-15**]       Discharge Date:  [**2141-6-18**]

Date of Birth:   [**2073-8-31**]       Sex:  M

Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fevers, chills.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 67 year old male
with a history of bladder cancer, status post bladder
resection with ileal conduit in [**2112**] who has a history of
nephrolithiasis and multiple urinary tract infections who now
presents with fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting and a recent
urine culture positive for gram negative rods.  The patient
was recently admitted to [**Hospital6 256**]
in [**2141-4-23**] for an elective lithotripsy of a left renal
stone which was complicated by Corynebacterium urosepsis for
which he was treated with ten days of Vancomycin.  During
that admission he also had multiple bilateral lower lobe
pulmonary emboli and negative lower extremity noninvasive
studies.

The patient was in his usual state of health until four to
five days prior to admission when he experienced fatigue and
fevers to 102 degrees.  He presented to his primary care
clinic and was started on Levofloxacin by his primary care
physician on [**6-13**].  On [**6-14**], he developed severe left
flank pain and was sent to the Emergency Department with a
fever of 102.7 degrees.  Computerized axial tomography scan
showed severe left hydronephrosis with gas requiring urgent
decompression.  The patient was given one unit of fresh
frozen plasma in order to correct his Coumadin-induced
coagulopathy before his interventional radiology procedure,
however, he developed a pruritic rash while receiving his
fresh frozen plasma, so he only received one out of three
proposed units.  At Interventional Radiology he had a
temporary inferior vena cava filter placed through his right
jugular and a left percutaneous nephrostomy tube was placed
as well under local anesthesia.  Immediately after the
procedure, the patient desaturated to 66% oxygen saturation
which then increased to the 90s of 100% FIO2 with a
nonrebreather mask.  The patient was then transferred to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Bladder cancer with bladder resection
in [**2112**] with an ileal conduit.  This was transitional cell
carcinoma, diabetes Type 2, hypertension, coronary artery
disease, status post myocardial infarction ten years ago,
status post stent to the left circumflex in [**2140-1-22**], at
which time catheterization showed an ejection fraction of
65%, hypercholesterolemia, left nephrolithiasis with
recurrent urinary tract infection, bilateral pulmonary emboli
in [**2141-4-23**], requiring, anticoagulation, status post
diskectomy.

ALLERGIES:  Codeine causing a rash.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Vancomycin 1 gm intravenously q.
12, ten day course completed [**2141-5-12**].  Coumadin 2 mg
h.s. alternating with 3 mg h.s., 3 mg on Tuesday and
Thursday, Metoprolol XL 200 daily, iron 150 daily, Senna one
tablet daily, Lisinopril 20/Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 daily,
Aspirin 325 daily, Nifedipine CR 60 daily, Atorvastatin 10 mg
daily, Tricor 160 mg daily, Humulin N 75/25 36 units q. AM,
52 units q.h.s.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives with his wife and does not drink.
He used to smoke, he has a 35 pack year history but he quit
12 to 13 years ago.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Non-contributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 103.7 degrees, heartrate
113, blood pressure 119/42, respiratory rate 31, oxygen
saturation 94% on nonrebreather with 100% FIO2.  General:
Visibly tachypneic.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Dry
mucosal membranes, extraocular muscles intact.  Pupils equal,
round and reactive to light.  Supple neck.  Cardiovascular
examination:  Regular, tachycardiac, S1 and S2 present, no
murmurs, no jugulovenous distension noted.  Pulmonary
examination, lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen, soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel
sounds.  The patient has a right lower quadrant urostomy and
a left percutaneous nephrostomy tube.  Extremities, warm,
trace edema on the right lower extremity, trace to 1+ edema
on the left lower extremity.  Dorsalis pedis pulses were
palpable bilaterally.  Neurological examination, alert and
oriented times three, answers questions appropriately.
Strength 5/5 bilaterally in upper and lower extremities.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 9.4, hematocrit
33.6, platelets 271.  Sodium 133, potassium 3.8, chloride 97,
bicarbonate 20, BUN 47, creatinine 2.8, glucose 192, INR 2.5.
Urine analysis showed specific gravity of 1.017, large blood,
positive nitrates, moderate leukocytes, 11 to 20 red blood
cells, 50 white blood cells, many bacteria.  Urine culture
from [**6-13**], was growing gram negative rods.  Arterial blood
gases showed 7.43, 27 pCO2 and pO2 of 81 and lactate of 5.9.
Chest x-ray after his interventional radiology procedure
showed new bibasilar lung opacities in the retrocardiac
region with atelectasis.  These are new findings compared to
his chest x-ray from earlier in the Emergency Department.
Computerized axial tomography scan of his abdomen showed
severe left hydronephrosis with gas in the collecting system
around the left ureteral stone.  Electrocardiogram showed
normal sinus rhythm with rate of 125, Q wave in II, III and
AVF.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Urosepsis - The patient had a left
percutaneous nephrostomy tube placed for drainage by
Interventional Radiology.  He was started on Levofloxacin,
Ampicillin and Flagyl for his urosepsis, however, after 24
hours, it was changed to Zosyn.  He was initially borderline
hypotensive with systolic pressures in the 90s, however,
after 24 hours of antibiotics his pressure increased and his
fever broke.  The patient was followed by Urology who was
initially planning on treating him with intravenous
antibiotics and continuing the percutaneous nephrostomy tube
for a period of four to six weeks followed by definitive
treatment with an open procedure to extract the stone.

2.  Hypoxia - The patient had several episodes of hypoxia
throughout his stay, some points requiring CPAP ventilation.
He was found to have crackles on examination during some of
these episodes of shortness of breath and he was given Lasix
as he was felt to be in failure.  His chest x-rays were
consistent with small amount of pulmonary edema.  He
responded to the Lasix, however, it was also thought that his
pulmonary emboli may be contributing to his hypoxic episodes.
Despite having his inferior vena cava filter placed for
pulmonary embolism prophylaxis, he was restarted on heparin
on [**6-18**] and a V/Q scan was ordered to assess for pulmonary
emboli.  In addition, the patient was scheduled for an
echocardiogram to assess for systolic or diastolic failure as
he has responded to Lasix therapy during some of the episodes
of shortness of breath.

3.  History of pulmonary embolism - The patient had an
inferior vena cava filter placed and was initially not given
his daily Coumadin.  However, three days after admission the
patient stabilized and was restarted on his heparin therapy.
The plan will include removing the temporary inferior vena
cava filter after the patient is restarted on Coumadin and is
therapeutic with an INR of 2.0 to 3.0.

4.  Anemia - The patient had a small amount of blood loss
during his interventional radiology procedure, and he was
initially transfused for a hematocrit of 25 considering his
history of previous myocardial infarction and coronary artery
disease.  He received approximately one unit of blood at
which time he became short of breath.  This was felt to be
due to fluid overload and transfusion was stopped.  The
patient was given Lasix and he responded with improved oxygen
saturation and decreased symptomatic shortness of breath.
After being transfused one unit of blood, his hematocrit
stabilized between 28 and 29%.  It was felt that this level
was adequate for the patient as it was over 28 and in light
of his initial reaction to receiving his first transfused
unit.

5.  Diabetes mellitus - The patient was placed on insulin
sliding scale and fingerstick glucoses were checked and the
patient's blood sugar was tightly controlled and kept in
