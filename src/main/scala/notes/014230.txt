Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11495**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain transfer from OSH for elective cath of known CAD

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization and PCI


History of Present Illness:
HPI: 83m with htn, dm2, cad, chf, cva, gib is transferred from
[**Hospital3 17921**] Center in [**Location (un) 5450**], NH for consideration of
difficult catheterization. He presented to CMC on [**2126-10-22**]
after 2-3 days of increasing weakness and progessive rest
angina. His angina first began in [**4-/2126**] when he had an NSTEMI.
Following this, he noted intermittent mild chest pain, almost
always at rest, that generally went away on its own and only
rarely required nitroglycerin. He would have this once every few
weeks. 2 days before his CMC admission, he began to have his
typical anginal pain at rest that required ntg to relieve it
occuring 6-7 times per day; just before going to the hospital,
he began to notice that the ntg was becoming less effective.
When he got to CMC, an ECG showed lateral ST-depressions and a
Tn of 0.45, and he was diagnosed with an NSTEMI; a CXR showed
pulmomary edema. He was started on asa, clopidogrel,
beta-blocker, and a heparin drip. During this process, he became
acutely dyspneic and was felt to be in acute pulmonary edema. He
was transferred to the ICU, never intubated, and managed
medically with improvement in sx and oxygen saturations; at this
point he also declared his desire to be DNR/DNI. Digoxin was
begun for transient episodes of atrial fibrillation. His medical
management of NSTEMI continued, and an echo showed an ef of
35-40%, mod-severe ao stenosis, MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] was
obtained who felt that based on his [**4-/2126**] catheterization, he'd
require CABG, which the patient declined. His heparin was
stopped on [**10-28**] as he was no longer in pain and had an
unexplained hct drop, which subsequently stabilized with no
source found. On [**10-31**], he was ambulating with PT without
dyspnea or chest pain and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
consideration of intervention.
.
Cardiac cath was performed on [**11-1**] that revealed a known 95%
calcified stenosis near the origin of large D1 that underwent
POBA.  The proximal LCX lesion from [**4-/2126**] progressed to 90%
stenosis and underwent PCI with BMS resulting in a 10% residual
stenosis.  While undergoing intervention, patient's blood
pressure dropped into the 50's systolic everytime the balloon
was inflated.

Pertinent Results:
Cardiac cath report [**2126-11-1**]
PTCA COMMENTS:     Following review of the diagnostic
angiograms, the
LAD and circumflex were identified as PCI targets.  A repeat
left
coronary angiogram confirmed the findings from the prior
diagnostic
angiography.  We planned to treat the LAD lesion followed by the
LCX
stenosis using an XBLAD 3.5 guide and CPTXS wire.  Due to a
history of
bleeding with heparin, we chose to use Angiomax
prophylactically.  The
guide support was excellent.  The LAD lesion was crossed with
minor
difficulty using the CPTXS wire and positioned in the distal
LAD.  The
stenosis was dilated with a 2.5mm and a 3.0mm balloon with very
good
angioplasty results.  Due to the heavy calcium burden and
hypotension
with each inflation (SBP 60-70mmHg), we chose not to deploy a
stent at
this site.  Our attention was next directed to the circumflex
which
proved to be somewhat more tolerant to balloon inflation with
less
hypotension.  The lesion was predilated with a 2.5mm and 3.0mm
balloon
and then stented with a 3.0x12mm Driver stent deployed at 18atm
with
excellent results.  The mid portion of the stent was then
postdilated
with a 3.0mm noncompliant balloon with excellent final results.
No
residual stenosis.  Final angiography of the left coronary
artery
revealed no dissection at the PCI sites and normal (TIMI 3)
flow.

Brief Hospital Course:
83m with htn, dm2, hyperlipidemia, cad, chf who CMC admitted on
[**10-22**] for an NSTEMI with a course complicated by acute pulmonary
edema, afib, and hypotension and who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for cardiac intervention.
.
#CAD -- Mr. [**Known lastname 25443**] arrived symptom free, and overnight was
maintained on a sound medical regimen, including aspirin,
clopidogrel, atorvastatin, and metoprolol.  He remained symptom
free over the first night.  The next morning he went to cardiac
cath where he was noted to have 95% LAD and 90% LCX lesions.  He
received a cypher stent to the LCX lesion and balloon angiplasty
to the LAD lesion; this decison was primarily made based on
hypotensio
