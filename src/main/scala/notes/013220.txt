IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive Type-A dissection beginning approximately 5 mm
above the coronary arteries with extension into the left common
carotid and innominate arteries superiorly, with inferior
extension to the left common femoral artery. The left renal
artery is supplied by the false lumen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1683**] presented [**1-31**] w/acute Type A aortic dissection which
extending to L common femoral artery and involving the L renal
artery.  He was taken emergently to the operating room with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 70**] for replacement of his ascending aorta and his
hemiarch.  In the operating room he was started on amiodarone
due to dysrhythmia.  Immediately postoperatively the patient was
woken and found to move all extremities but was re sedated due
to hypoxia, which resolved with significant increased PEEP.  A
renal consult was obtained due to an elevated creatine and the
patient was started on dialysis POD#3.  Also on POD#3, it was
noted that the patient had EKG changes.  A cardiology consult
was obtained and the patient underwent cardiac catheterization
which did not reveal any CAD.  It also showed that his renal
arteries were perfused.  His PEEP was slowly weaned and as his
hemodynamics stabilized his PEEP was weaned and he was
transitioned to hemodialysis.  His sedation was attempted to be
weaned on a regular basis with multiple episodes of agitation.
On POD#11 it was noted that he was not moving his left side as
well as his right.  A neurology consult was obtained and an MRI
was performed which showed multiple small, bilateral subcortical
strokes.  It was recommended that he be started on
anticoagulation, but there was concern for blood in the sinus
and an ENT consult was obtained and it was determined that there
was no active bleeding and it was determined that he would be
safe for anticoagulation.  An echocardiogram was obtained which
did not show any intracardiac source of emboli. On POD#13 he was
taken to the operating room for a tunneled dialysis catheter and
on POE#16 he underwent a tracheostomy and PEG, and on POD#17 it
was noted that his dialysis catheter was not functioning
properly and he was taken to the operating room for replacement
of the catheter.  He continued to have waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental
status and was unable to be weaned from the ventilator.  On POD#
21 he was noted to have a rising WBC and fever.  He was found to
have Serratia in his sputum and klebsiella in his urine.  He was
started on meropenem.  His WBC continued to rise and on POD#25
his tunneled dialysis catheter was removed to rule out as source
of infection.  On POD#27 a Foley catheter was attempted to be
placed and had large amounts of bloody drainage.  A urology
consult was obtained and it was determined that the catheter had
created a false tract.  He was taken to the operating room and
underwent cystoscopy and placement of catheter.  He continued to
have fevers and underwent a TEE to r/o endocarditis, which was
negative.  On POD#28 his WBC continued to rise and he had high
fevers.  There was a concern for an intraabdominal source of
infection and a general surgery consult was obtained.  His LFTs
were elevated and an ultrasound of his gallbladder was obtained
which showed sludge and a dilated common bile duct.  He
underwent ERCP and biliary stent placement, and the procedure
revealed no stones or evidence of cholangitis.  His transaminase
continued to rise after the procedure.  He underwent a CT scan
of his abdomen which showed a perfusion defect in his liver and
there was concern for impingement of the celiac axis by the
false lumen of the aortic dissection.  A vascular surgery
consult was obtained and he was taken to the angiography suite
and he underwent stent to his celiac with fenestration and
subsequently required stents to his L iliac artery.  He had been
started on broad spectrum antibiotics and over the next several
days he remained tenuous, however his transaminase, WBC and
fever curve gradually decreased.  He was transiently started on
CVVH due to the concern for intra-abdominal ischemia, but as his
hemodynamics improved, he was transition ed to hemodialysis.  As
he continued to improve, but was still unable to be weaned from
the ventilator, the decision was made to transition his care to
the medical ICU team and the pulmonary service.

MICU Addendum:
In MICU, after sedation was weaned for 2 days, a trial of
pressure support was attempted which patient tolerated well for
2 days.  He was then switched to trach collar which he also
tolerated.  He was seen again by stroke service to re-evaluate
his prognosis and neuro status s/p his multiple embolic CVAs.
From Neurology perspective, he was felt to have good
rehabilitation potential and needed only aspirin as an
antiplatelet [**Doctor Last Name 360**] for his recurrent CVA risk.  However, full
dose (325mg) ASA will start after 1 month of full
anti-coagulation on coumadin for goal INR [**3-9**] for his arterial
stents placed by vascular surgery.  He remains on Heparin gtt as
his INR was yet to be therapeutic. He remained afebrile with
thin, watery secretions in the MICU.  He was continued on every
other day hemodialysis without incident.  He was noted to have
component of iron-deficiency in addition to his epo-deficient,
chronic disease anemia and therefore was started on ferrous
sulfate.  We also titrated up his beta-blocker for improved
BP/HR control.
