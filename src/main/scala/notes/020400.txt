[**2158-7-17**] RUQ US: No evidence of biliary obstruction.
[**2158-7-17**] CT Chest: 1. Lesion between left atrium and esophagus
corresponds to a fluid density oval structure surrounded by fat.
The latter likely reflects fat that has herniated into the
posterior mediastinum through the esophageal hiatus. The
etiology of the oval- shaped lesion is uncertain, but could
represent an esophageal duplication cyst or other benign
finding. A necrotic lymph node is less likely. By report, the
patient underwent an outside CT years ago. Direct comparison to
the older study is recommended to document long-term stability
and to exclude an acute process.

2. Small bilateral pleural effusions, increased since study from
[**7-14**].

3. Focal area of cystic bronchiectasis in the lingula with a
small fluid level, indicative of secretions. Findings are likely
sequela of prior pneumonia.

4. Borderline enlarged precarinal mediastinal lymph node.
.
[**2158-7-18**] Bone Scan: No definite evidence of osteomyelitis or
osseous metastases.


Brief Hospital Course:
ICU Course:
73 year old, p/w acute history of
chills/lethargy/disorientation, WBC of 30K, lactate 5, admit to
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for sepsis protocol (Sepsis-hyperthermia + WBC 30; shock +
lactate).
#Sepsis of unclear etiology. Given the pt hisotry of chronic
steroid use and his travel history, the initial differential
diagnosis was wide. Apart from the usual sources  malaria,
typhoid fever and traveler diarrhea were considered. THe pt was
started on Levofloxacin and Metronidazole in the ED. A CXR was
unsuggestive for pneumonia, a CT w and w/o contrast of the
abdomen and pelvis was negative. The WBC of initally 30K was
trending down from with ABX treatment. A urine culture did not
reveal any infectious course. Stool and blood cultures were
pending.
The pt was continued on a stress dose of steroids given is
chronic steroid intake.
to follow mental status closely
..
#ARF - Creatinine was elevated (1.9) on admission. The cause was
thought to be prerenal in context of a sepsis. The pt was
treated with fluid boluses and urine output was monitored. The
Cr came down quickly and is now 0.9. Because no previous data
was available, it is difficult to estimate the pt's baseline.
..
#Gap metabolic acidosis and metabolic alkalosis was thought to
be a combination of lactic acidosis, vomiting and contraction
alkalosis. The pt was treated with aggressive IVF resucitation
as by the must protocoll and electrolytes were repleted
accordingly. His acid base disorder has resolved.
..
#Increased LFT from first specimen, are thought to be due to
hemolysis as all follow up LFTs were normal and no other history
or clinical symptoms consistent with a liver disease were given.
..
#CV- An echo on admission showed a left atrium that is mildly
dilated. The right atrium that is moderately dilated. Overall
left ventricular systolic function that
