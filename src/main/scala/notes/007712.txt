Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation
Hemodialysis


History of Present Illness:
62 yo M with a history of CAD s/p CABG [**2125**], multiple PCIs, ESRD
on HD, DM, PVD, recent admission for enterococcal bacteremia,
s/p PPM removal, and tunneled line removal, presents with chest
pain, bradycardia, with subsequent PEA arrest in the ED.
.
Per ED history, patient experienced left anterior chest pain at
home and called 911. When he was picked up by EMS, he was noted
to be bradycardic to the 40s.
.
On arrival to the ED, he was awake, with nausea and vomiting,
complaining of chest pain. Initial VS were: HR 49 RR 26 SpO2
96/RA BP 111/34. The patient was given Zofran IV for nausea. As
he was bradycardic, and he had missed dialysis, he was treated
with IV calcium, insulin and glucose for presumed hyperkalemia.
As preparation were made to obtain central access, patient
suffered a PEA arrest, and was treated with one cycle of chest
compressions and atropin, for approximately 3 minutes. He
returned to a sinus rhythm. He was paralyzed with etomidate and
rocuronium, sedated with fentanyl and Versed, intubated and
placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient was further given
an amp of bicarb and an amp of D50. Vancomycin and gentamicin
started IV.

[**11-5**] Upper Ext Doppler right side: no DVT

[**11-4**] Echo:
The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 50 %). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with impairedfree wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-29**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2132-10-20**],
findings are similar.

focal fluid
collections.
4. Bibasilar atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
59 yo M hx CAD s/p CABG, PCI, DM, ESRD on HD p/w bradycardia and
leukocytosis and episode of PEA arrest in the ED.
.
# PEA arrest: Unclear etiology. Thought likely due to increased
vagal tone during central line placement which resulted in
hypotension and bradycardia and resultant brief PEA arrest.
Negative CTA for PE, dissection. No pulmonary edema, no
pneumothorax. Bedside U/S in ED showed no evidence of tamponade.
Not hyperkalemic or hypercalcemic. Echo unchanged from prior. Pt
recovered with atropine and only 1 cycle of chest compressions.
No further episodes of PEA arrest.
.
# Bradycardia. Initially with irregular bradycardia rhythm on
presentation, possibly atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular
response. Held metoprolol, amlopdipine, and isosorbide. Was
given atropine once in the ED and once in the CCU then started
on dopamine drip and HD. On hospital day 1, dopamine drip was
stopped and pt's HR in the 60s and normotensive. Metoprolol 25mg
[**Hospital1 **] restarted in hospital after patient's systolic BP to
150s-160s. Patient can restart his other antihypertensives as
outpatient.
.
# Coronaries: He has a strong history of CAD and numerous risk
factors. Elevated trop (max 0.17) but neg CK and CK-MB. Elevated
trop was at baseline and likely secondary to his underlying
renal disease. Continued his medical management of CAD with [**Hospital1 **],
[**Hospital1 4532**], statin. His metoprolol succ was resumed to 50mg daily
whcih is decreased from his outpatient 100mg daily. Pt should
follow up with outpatient cardiologist to discuss when to
increase it back  up to 100mg daily.
.
# Fever/Leukocytosis: Pt had recent enterococcus bactermia
([**2132-10-17**]) episode resulting in vegetations of his pacer leads
after explantation on [**2132-10-23**]. Pt had leukocytosis and fever
on admission a
