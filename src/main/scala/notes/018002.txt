HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is an 84-year-old male
with past medical history of diverticulosis, anemia, silent
MI with ejection fraction of 25%, prostate cancer,
gastrointestinal bleed, polymazic rheumatica and infrarenal
abdominal aortic aneurysm of 7.3 cm.  Patient had an elective
abdominal aortic aneurysm repair on the [**8-30**].  It
was an endovascular repair for a 7.5 infrarenal abdominal
aortic aneurysm.  The procedure was complicated by a type I
endoleak.  The patient returned for an open repair on the
[**9-5**] then admitted to the SICU.  With difficulty
weaning the patient postoperatively, he remained on a
ventilator until [**11-13**].

The patient required diuresis in order to be weaned from the
ventilator.  He also was treated with Kefzol for 11 days due
to bilateral drainage from groin incisions.  He also had
received Ceftriaxone to cover for a possible pneumonia.  The
patient had episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
postoperatively with a heart rate in the 150s and drop in his
blood pressure.  EP was consulted.  The patient was treated
initially with beta blocker and Amiodarone with
anticoagulation.  The patient converted back into normal
sinus rhythm, though he did have episodes of bradyarrhythmia
down to the 30s.  EP felt the patient had Tachy-Brady
syndrome and recommended against continuing further beta
blocker.

It was felt that the patient had infiltrates and pneumonia
possibly secondary to aspiration that was contributing to his
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  The pneumonia was treated
for 14 days of Ceftriaxone.  The patient went into normal
sinus rhythm and remained there for the rest of his hospital
stay.

After extubation on the 30th, the patient remained having
some respiratory difficulty requiring Bi-PAP for CO2
retention.  He had problems with thick tenacious secretions
with waxing mental status.  He was eventually weaned from the
Bi-PAP to nasal cannula and transferred to the floor on the
[**10-22**].  He was saturating in the 90s on nasal
cannula.

On the [**10-26**], the patient had a swallowing study
which showed aspiration.  The patient became tachypneic and
had an ABG of 7.22, 63, 111.  He was transferred back to the
MICU secondary to hypercarbia, respiratory distress and
change in mental status.  He was stabilized on Bi-PAP.  He
remained stable until the [**10-28**] where he had
decreased mental status and an ABG showing 7.12, 94, 163 on
Bi-PAP.  The patient was having thick tenacious tan
secretions which altered his respiratory status.  He was
transferred from the MICU on the 14th for stabilization and
management of his respiratory failure.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Myocardial infarction.  He had a V-fib arrest on a tennis
court approximately 30 years ago.  Ejection fraction is
approximately 25% on echo in [**2182-10-15**].  He had a
Persantin thallium test on [**2182-10-23**] which showed a fixed
inferior defect with an ejection fraction, once again, of
25%.
2.  The patient has prostate cancer thought possibly to be
metastatic.  He is currently taking Lupron injections.  His
last injection was 22.5 mg IM on the [**11-4**].  Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm of 7.3 cm.
4.  Also a 5.6 cm ascending aortic aneurysm.
5.  Anemia with a ferratin greater than detectable levels
indicating chronic disease.
6.  PMR on chronic Prednisone 5 mg q.d.
7.  Vertebral compression fractures.
8.  GI bleed.  He required transfusion two years.
Colonoscopy showed diverticulosis as the most likely
etiology.
9.  Hernia repair approximately 40 years ago.

ALLERGIES:
1.  Norvasc.
2.  Celebrex.

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:
1.  Prednisone 5 mg q.d.
2.  Losartan 50 mg q.d.
3.  Toprol 75 mg q.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient is married.  His sons and wife are
also involved in his care.  He smoked for approximately 10
years and quit about 35 years ago.  Prior to admission the
patient used a walker for ambulation.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vitals, 98.8 F temperature, pulse 83,
blood pressure 153/66, respiratory rate 17, SVO2 100% on AC
of 550 with tidal volume 410 to 720, respiratory rate of 12
to 19 with PEEP of 5 and fio2 of 100%.  Patient was a thin
elderly man intubated.  Pupils were constricted.  Sclerae
nonicteric.  Dry blood in creases of mouth with dry mucous
membranes.  No jugular venous distention.  Coarse breath
sounds.  Bilateral diffuse rales.  Regular rate and rhythm,
S1, S2.  There is a II/VI systolic ejection murmur right
sternal border greater than left.  Midline abdominal scar
with staples.  Soft with normoactive bowel sounds.  No
tenderness, no rebound, no distention.  Extremities:  No
cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  The patient does have a
slightly bulging area from his right groin.  Neuro:  He was
non-responsive when he was admitted due to sedation and
intubation.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION TO MICU:  Sodium 143, potassium
4.3, chloride 107, bicarbonate 27, BUN 46, creatinine 0.6.
CKs were flat at 28, 32, 20.  White count 12.9, hematocrit
33.2, platelets 235 at the time of admission.

Last ABG at the time of admission to the MICU of 7.36, 69,
94% and free calcium 7.24.

MICU COURSE:  Patient is an 84-year-old male status post
abdominal aortic aneurysm repair complicated by endoleak,
hypotension converted to open repair, prolonged weaning from
vent most likely secondary to volume overload with extended
intubation followed by possible probable aspiration in
context of a swallowing study and respiratory distress
secondary to that aspiration and mucous plugging.

1.  RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Patient was initially AC intubated.
He eventually underwent trach placement on the [**10-29**].  The patient also had chest VT and frequent
suctioning to help with mucous plugging.  The patient
initially had difficulty weaning off AC on the trach tube.
We tried to wean him to pressor support and then to trach
mask.  The patient had stridorous noises coming from the
trach tube without a leak, pain as well as respiratory
distress every time he was taken off of the ventilator onto
the trach mask.

The patient was rebronched on the 19th.  It was discovered
that his trach tube was too large and the posterior aspect of
the trach tube was being occluded by the posterior wall of
the trachea as well as resulting in a small ulceration in the
posterior wall of the trachea. The trach tube was changed to
an appropriate sized trach tube with the help of
Interventional Pulmonology.

After being changed, the patient was able to be weaned from
AC to pressor support and then to a trach mask, 50% trach
mask on the day of discharge, the [**11-5**].  His last
ABG on 50% trach mask on the 21st was 7.36, pO2 of 123 and
CO2 of 49.  The patient has not had any problems with mucous
plugging over 36 hours.  He definitely requires significant
pulmonary toilet and having the patient out of bed in a chair
will in addition improve his mucous plugging pulmonary status
as well as hydration and intact via his J tube.

2.  CARDIAC:  Patient for blood pressure control was
continued on Losartan and was started on a low dose of
Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg.  His beta blocker was held
secondary to problems with bradyarrhythmia.  The patient was
continued on his aspirin.  The patient has had systolic blood
pressures in the 130s except when he becomes agitated.  His
blood pressure does rise into the 190s region.  Usually
treating the source of the agitation, for example pain, with
Morphine results in decrease of the patient's blood pressure
and pulse.  The patient also has received at times 2.5 IV
Lopressor very slowly times one with results of decreasing of
his blood pressure and his heart rate.

3.  RHYTHM:  Patient had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
thought to be secondary to pneumonia that developed during
his hospital to the floor perioperatively.  The patient
remained in normal sinus rhythm throughout his stay in the
MICU becoming tachycardic and hypertensive secondary to
agitation.  This resolved by treating the source of the
agitation as well as with p.r.n. once every other day or so
2.5 mg of Lopressor IV.

The patient was seen by Electrophysiology and felt to have
Tachy-Br
