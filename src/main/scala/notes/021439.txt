Admission Date:  [**2130-11-25**]     Discharge Date:  [**2130-11-28**]


Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old female
with a history of coronary artery disease, status post
myocardial infarction in [**2130-5-7**], diabetes,
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and stage III colon
cancer, currently undergoing chemotherapy with 5-FU and
leucovorin which was begun in [**Month (only) 116**] of this year.

She fell out of her bed one day prior to admission and was
unable to get up.  She was found by her neighbor covered in
feces.  She had lower extremity weakness which resolved by
the time of presentation.  She denied other symptoms
including chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting,
fever, chills, loss of consciousness, melena, bright red
blood per rectum, dysuria or head injury.  She noted diarrhea
and incontinence.  At her presentation to the Emergency Room
she had absolute neutrophil count of 120.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Hypercholesterolemia.
3.  Diabetes.
4.  Osteoporosis.
5.  Colon cancer, status post colectomy and chemotherapy
with 5-FU and leucovorin.
6.  Status post myocardial infarction in [**2130-5-7**] with
an ejection fraction of 35%.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   Ms. [**Known lastname 953**] was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit as she presented with hypotension and a
hypothermia as well as new onset atrial fibrillation with a
rapid rate.  Her hypotension was believed due to in part her
rapid ventricular rate, and also in part from sepsis of an
unknown source.  There was a question of bowel ischemia that
could not be ruled out.  She had an impressive lactic
acidosis.  She was placed on pressors and broad-spectrum
antibiotics.  She received many amps of bicarbonate.  Around
this time, she ruled in for a myocardial infarction with a
creatine kinase peak of 154.  She required cardioversion for
hemodynamic stability from her atrial fibrillation but did
not remain in normal sinus rhythm for a very long time.  She
was intubated during her periods of instability.

After all of these interventions, she initially started to
improve but this improvement did not last, and her pressor
requirements increased.  She eventually expired.
