Brief Hospital Course:
79-year-old man with COPD, HTN, hyperlipidemia, CRI, anemia
transferred from the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to the Medicine team for ongoing care
of COPD exacerbation.
.
1. COPD exacerbation:  On admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the patient was
on 2L NC with fairly normal ABG with minimal CO2 retention. He
was ruled out for MI and was feeling much better by the time he
arrived to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. He was started on azithromycin,
albuterol/Atrovent nebs and prednisone 60 mg po qd. His
respiratory status continued to improve and he was transferred
to the floor the next day for further monitoring. His WBC
trended down, repeat PA/lateral CXR was unremarkable other than
for stable emphysema. He was weaned down to RA by the second
hospital day and was satting 94% on RA at rest. On ambulation he
desatted to 85 % but was satting well on 2 L nasal cannula on
ambulation (95%). At discharge he had no oxygen requirement at
rest, wheezing resolved, but was discharged with home oxygen for
ambulation, albuterol/Atrovent nebs, Advair INH, and a
prednisone to complete a 1 week taper. By discharge he felt that
he was at about his baseline respiratory status. He will follow
up with his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**6-26**] days. We would also recommend that he
follow up with an allergist as an outpatient for further
evaluation of what may be prompting his frequent exacerbations.
.
2. HTN: Patient was hypertensive on transfer to the medicine
floor to 190's but stabilized to the 160's without intervention
and was asymptomatic throughout this time. He was started on
metoprolol in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], but this was discontinued given his COPD
especially in the setting of an acute exacerbation. He was
restarted on his home regimen of Avapro 300 mg po qd, lisinopril
40 mg po qd and nifedipine 90 mg po qd and his BPs stabilized to
the 130's/70's-80's. His SBPs remained in the high 130's. He was
continued on the regimen at discharge but may consider
increasing his nifedipine as an outpatient.
.
3. Anemia:  Patient has known history of anemia secondary to
MDS.  His hematocrit remained in the low 30's throughout
admission and stable.
.
4. Chronic Renal Insufficiency:  This is likely due to HTN
nephropathy. His baseline creatinine was unknown.  He appeared
euvolemic throughout admission and creatinine remained stable at
1.4-1.8. His medications were renally dosed and his creatinine
and volume status closely monitored His creatinine was 1.4 at
discharge.

5. Hyperlipidemia:  Continued on Lipitor.
