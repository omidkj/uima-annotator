effusion.  He was noted to be in Aflutter with Lateral ST
depressions and inverted T waves on ECG.  Trop was found to be
0.11 with a CK of 59.  He was given an ASA and started on a
Heparin gtt.  He received Lopresser 5 mg IV x3 and lopressor 25
mg po x1 for rate control.  He also received Vanco, Levo, flagyl
and 2 liters of Normal Saline.

Studies:
CT chest [**2139-10-21**]:
1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2.  New bilateral pleural effusions.
3.  New low-density low attenuating fluid seen surrounding the
ascending aorta with no evidence of aortic contour abnormality,
dissection, or aneurysm.
4.  Interval resolution of intrahepatic biliary ductal
dilatation.
5.  Presence of intraductal air is most consistent with
patient's interval stent replacement.
6.  Stable biapical pleural-based nodules.
7.  Stable calcified pulmonary nodules.
8.  Large right renal cyst, with rim calcifications.
.
CXR [**2139-10-21**]:
1.  Bilateral basilar opacities, worrisome for aspiration.
2.  Right pleural effusion.
3.  Mild congestive heart failure.
.
ECHO [**2139-7-27**]:
1. Left ventricular systolic function is normal  (LVEF>55%).
2. Moderate aortic valve stenosis.
3. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
4. Mild to moderate ([**12-14**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
5. Borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
6. No pericardial effusion.
.
A/P: 70 yo M with inoperable pancreatic cancer s/p ERCP with
stent placement, laparotomy with attempted Whipple, h/o
cholangitis, on gemcitabine (received first dose of 2nd round
yesterday) who presents with fever to 105 and shortness of
breath.
.
#  Fever/leukocytosis.  Likely secondary to PNA seen on CXR
however need to consider biliary source given pancreatic cancer
with previous biliary obstruction requiring stent placement.
TBili increased to 6.5 from 1.0, AP increased from 590 to 790
from yesterday.  Need to monitor closely for sepsis given
tachycardia, tachypnea, and fever.
.
- s/p 3 liters NS with good BP, will hold off on additional
fluid hydration given mild CHF and pleural effusions seen on CXR

- will obtain CT abd with oral contrast to evaluate for evidence
of infection; may need ERCP to evaluate biliary stent placement
- will start Vanco and Zosyn (previous culture data from
cholangitis revealed Enterococcus and Pseudomonas sensitive to
vanco and zosyn)
- control fever with tylenol
- monitor blood and urine culture
.
#  Hypoxia.  ABG with PO2 of 168 on NRB.  CT negative for PE.
Etiology likely PNA and pleural effusions.  Need to control HR
to prevent worsening pulmonary congestion.
- dilt gtt for rate control
- wean O2 as tolerated
.
#  Aflutter with rapid rate.  ? h/o intermittent SVT.  [**Month (only) 116**] be
secondary to current pulmonary process.
- control rate with dilt gtt
.
#  Elevated Trop of 0.[**Street Address(2) 28437**] depressions and TWI's
likely secondary to demand ischemia in setting of rapid aflutter
and hypoxia.  CK's flat.
- continue to cycle cardiac enzymes
- monitor on tele
- will d/c heparin gtt as likely demand ischemia
- continue ASA
.
#  Pancreatic cancer.  Pt is not a surgical candidate.  Last
dose of gemcitabine [**2143-10-20**].
- will consult Onc in am
.
#  HNT.
- dilt gtt as above
- once off dilt gtt will restart metop 25 tid
.
#  FEN.  NPO for now, replete lytes prn
.
#  PPX.  SC heparin, bowel regimen
