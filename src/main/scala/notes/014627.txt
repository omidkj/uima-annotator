Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea/Fatigue

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2157-9-1**]: Aortic valve replacement with a [**Street Address(2) 17167**]. [**Hospital 923**] Medical

History of Present Illness:
89 year old female with history of aortic stenosis followed by
serial echoacardiograms. She was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] at
the end of [**Month (only) 116**] after falling; it was unclear whether this fall
was mechanical or a result of a syncopal episode.  She was found
to be in decompensated heart failure and her symptoms improved
with IV furosemide. A TTE at the time notably showed critical AS
with a valve area <0.8 cm2, peak gradient of 108 mm Hg, LVEF >
55%. Shortly after discharge, she was again readmitted to [**Location (un) 21541**] Hospital for treatment of congestive heart failure and
pneumonia. She was subsequently referred by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] to Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] for surgical evaluation. Her current symptoms included
worsening dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, mild orthopnea and lower
extremity edema. She denies chest pain, syncope, pre-syncope,
PND, and palpitations.

Carotid Bruit: transmitted murmurs bilaterally

Pertinent Results:
[**2157-9-1**] Echo: PREBYPASS: The left atrium is normal in size. No
mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
There is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis
(LVEF = 30 %). Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed (LVEF= 30 %). Right ventricular sytolic fxn
is mildly depressed. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
Significant aortic stenosis is present (not quantified). Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a 0.21 x 0.5cm
echodensity noted on a chordae beneath the anterior mitral valve
leaflet. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
POSTBYPASS:
The patient is AV-Paced, on low-dose epinephrine infusion. There
is a well-seated prosthetic aortic valve, with no leak and no
AI. Residual mean gradient = 9 mmHg. Biventricular systolic fxn
is unchanged. Aorta intact. The tip of the SGC is seen at the PA
bifurcation. The echodensity beneath the anterior mitral valve
leaflet is unchanged.

[**2157-9-7**] CXR: In comparison with study of [**9-5**], there has been
placement of a left subclavian pacemaker with the leads in the
region of the right atrium and apex of the right ventricle.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with mild pulmonary
vascular congestion.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
operating room on [**2157-9-1**] where she patient underwent an aortic
valve replacement with a [**Street Address(2) 17167**]. [**Hospital 923**] Medical Biocor Epic
tissue valve. See operative note for full details. Overall the
patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring. She was given multiple products for post
operative bleeding which resolved on her post operative night.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably. EP was consulted with pre-existent
infranodal conduction disease complicated by complete heart
block post operatively. Ceftriaxone was given for Proteus
urinary tract infection x 3 days and repeat UA was negative.
Complete heart block persisted and on POD 5 a permanent dual
chamber pacemaker was implanted in the EP lab. Vancomycin was
used for antibiotic prophylaxis x 3 days. The patient was
neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic
or vasopressor support. Beta blocker was initiated after the
permanent pacemaker was implanted and the patient was gently
diuresed toward her preoperative weight. All narcotics were
discontinued due to sensitivity to narcotics and Tylenol only
was used for pain control. Zoloft was increased on POD 6 due to
patient expressing feeling more depressed and with preoperative
plan per PCP was to increase Zoloft to 100 mg daily. The patient
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery on
POD 6. Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication. The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy
service for assistance with strength and mobility. By the time
of discharge on POD 8 the patient was ambulating freely, the
wound was healing and pain was controlled with Tylenol.
Ceftriaxone for UTI and Vancomycin for PPM insertion were
completed and repeat UA was negative with culture pending at the
time of discharge. This is to be followed up as an outpatient.
The patient was discharged to rehab in good condition with
appropriate follow up instructions.
