Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**]
Chief Complaint:
Neck pain, right hilar mass

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy with tissue biopsy
PICC line placement

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 19688**] is a 53-year-old gentleman with a history of
Alport's Syndrome s/p cadaveric renal transplant in [**2147**], PCP
pneumonia in [**2151**], PPD+ who presented to [**Hospital 8**] Hospital with
right-sided neck pain, cough productive of bloody sputum, and
shortness of breath on [**2153-3-31**]. Noncontrast CT chest revealed a
mass at the right hilum that was obstructing his right upper
lobe; also with 2 subcentimeter nodules in LUL concerning for
satellite nodules, RUL consolidation concerning for
post-obstructive pneumonia, mediastinal adenopathy. Noted to
have purulent sputum. Increased hypoxia with ABG 7.33/42/60 on
4LNC.

He was initially treated for post-obstructive pneumonia with
cefepime/azithromycin, switched to ceftriaxone after urine
legionella negative. He developed an increasing oxygen
requirement of 30L/min of high flow O2. Given concern for TB,
AFB sent (negative x1, pending x2).

Regarding right hilar mass, bronchoscopy postponed due to
increasing oxygen requirement. Per oncology consultation,
concern for NSCLC vs SCLC vs post-transplant lymphoproliferative
disease. Hospital course also complicated by hypercalcemia
improved with IVF and pamidronate, delirium suspected secondary
to infection/malignancy.

Of note, the patient recently traveled to Aruba.

Before transfer, the patient's vitals were: T:98.8(101 in AM)
HR:91 BP: 131/69 RR:20 O2:97% on high flow O2 (30 liters).

On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ICU, patient reports feeling better. Dyspnea
improved. Persistent wet cough. No fever/chills. Review of
systems otherwise limited secondary to malfunctioned hearing
aids.

Radiology Studies:

Head CT: [**3-31**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of an acute pathologic intracranial process.
2. Opacification of bilateral mastoid air cells and middle ears.
Please
correlate clinically to exclude mastoiditis and otitis media.

CXR [**3-31**]:
1. Findings are concerning for right hilar mass with
post-obstructive
consolidation in the right upper lobe. Additional opacity in the
right
paratracheal region, likely represents mediastinal
lymphadenopathy.
Recommended CT of the chest with contrast if this has not been
performed
before
2. Mild overhydration.

[**2153-4-9**] LENI: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.

[**2153-4-10**] CTA Chest: IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Significant interval progression of disease. Worsening
poststenotic
opacification involving the right upper lobe. New near subtotal
collapse of the right lower lobe and a worsened now severe in
size right pleural effusion. Associated compression of the right
main stem bronchi and distal branches and the right main
pulmonary artery. Extensive adenopathy.
3. Newly developed moderate left effusion.
4. Multiple hypoattenuating liver lesions, incompletely assessed
and a soft tissue lesion is seen abutting the left hemidiaphragm
that in given setting of disease is highly concerning for
metastasis.
5. Circular area of low attenuation seen in the right atrium
that is probably caused by venous inflow from non-opacified
inferior vena caval blood, although the possibility of thrombus
still exists.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 36565**] is a 53 year old gentleman with Alport's Syndrome
s/p cadaveric renal transplant in [**2147**], PPD+, and PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**]
[**2151**] who was admitted with respiratory distress in the setting
of a new right hilar mass.
.
#. Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial, including
right hilar mass compression of right upper lobe bronchus, RUL
pneumonia. Despite immunosuppression and elevated LDH, PCP less
likely based on CT chest findings. Patient was treated with 14
days of Vancomycin and Zosyn for post-obstructive pneumonia (day
1 = [**2153-4-1**]). Sputum GS and culture showed polymicrobial
infection, which grew only commensal organisms.  Ruled out for
TB with 3 induced sputums (2 expectorated at outside hospital, 1
induced at [**Hospital1 18**]). Quantiferon gold assay for TB was negative.
He was weaned off of oxygen and was satting well on room air on
discharge from the ICU [**2153-4-4**]. After bronchoscopy [**2153-4-5**] he
again desaturated twice to O2 sats in the low 80s, but improved
quickly and was able to be weaned off of oxygen quickly.  This
was thought to be due to mucous plugging as his CXR was
unchanged, so he was started on guaifenesin 1200mg [**Hospital1 **].  His
respiratory status was stable for several days, however he was
persistently tachycardic, would desaturate with ambulation and
had low-grade fevers. LENI's were negative and his EKG
unchanged. [**2153-4-9**] he had an increased oxygen requirement in the
setting of aggressive fluids for hypercalcemia, and a CTA chest
