Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
overdose, respiratory compromise, intubated prior to arrival

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
46 yo F initially brought to [**Hospital 1474**] hospital with ? drug
overdose (?seroquel) after she was found with a suicide note on
her. Per notes, someone from her house called 911. The patient
opened the door when EMS arrived, but she became obtunded at the
OSH, Narcan 1.2 mg IV tried and was intubated (AC 550x12, FiO2
100% PEEP 5) for airway protection at around 23:00 on [**2142-12-9**].
FS was 76. She was given etomidate 20mg, succs 100mg, vecuronium
10 mg x 2, ativan 2 mg x 2. She also received charcoal 50 gm
once. Head CT was done at the OSH and showed a left 5mm
frontoparietal SDH interpreted as acute as well as a retrobulbar
mass. Triple lumen femoral line was placed. There were reports
that she may have been abused by her significant other. The
patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for trauma assessment and
further management. Per report, on exam in the ED at the OSH the
patient was moving all 4 extr but did not follow any commands.
.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, her VS with HR 77 and BP 122/91.
Head CT was repeated and showed no ICH, but revealed a
retrobulbar mass (? lymphoma vs. hemangioma vs. pseudotumor vs.
lacrimal gland tumor vs. much less likely hematoma) w/o shift.
C-spine was cleared with CT. CXR showed bilateral consolidation.
Blood cultures were drawn. The ABG 7.39/42/414 on vent setting
AC AC 550x12, FiO2 100% PEEP 5. Lactate 3.0. Tox screen positive
for EtOH level 48. The rest of tox screen is negative. Trauma
surgery evaluated the patient but after the scans revealed no
surgical issues, she was admitted to medical ICU. Of note,
ophthalmology was consulted for a retrobulbar mass -> no acute
issues; deferred evaluation until the patient able to provide
history.

GENERAL: intubated, opens eyes to verbal stimuli, does not track
or focus, does not withdraw to painful stimuli, moving all 4

bilaterally
NEURO: (on Propofol 10) Moving all 4 extr bilaterally, opens
eyes to voice, does not follow commands, patellar and biceps
reflexes 2+, Babinski's down going bilaterally; limited
assessment as patient is not following commands
SKIN: hypertrophic scars and grafts on thighs; no exanthems


Pertinent Results:
CXR [**1-9**]: Patchy airspace opacities in the right upper and
bilateral lower
lobes concerning for aspiration or evolving multifocal
pneumonia.
.
NCHCT:
1. Left retrobulbar mass as above, causing proptosis of the
adjacent globe. Although not completely characterized on this
non-contrast study, diagnostic considerations include large
hemangioma, lymphoma, pseudotumor, or lacrimal gland tumor.
Retrobulbar hematoma is considered less likely. Further
characterization can be performed with contrast-enhanced CT or
MRI when the patient is stable.
.
C-spine CT:
1. No evidence of fracture.
2. Large heterogeneous thyroid gland. Correlate clinically and
with
ultrasound if indicated.

CXR [**1-10**]:
There has been interval removal of the ET tube and the NG tube.
The heart size is borderline normal. There is mild vascular
congestion. Lung volumes are low. There is no pleural effusion.
A patchy opacity in the right upper lobe is concerning for
pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT and PLAN:
46 yo female with h/o depression, asthma transferred from OSH
where she presented after presumed overdose with a suicide note
found, intubated for airway protection.
.
# Respiratory. Intubated for airway protection and was quickly
extubated in the ICU without incident. Initial CXR showed
question of mild patchy opactities that was unchanged on repeat
CXR.  No evidence of pneumonia on exam.  Denied SOB and
excellent O2 sats on room air.  No cough. No leukocytosis and
afebrile.  More consistent with pneumonitis of undetermined
etiology.  She had no leukocytosis, fever, or SOB throughout
admission.
.
# Overdose. Per patient, she ingested some combination of
ativan, tegretol, and seroquel (10s of pills each). EKG normal
at outside hospital as well as on transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. LFTs were
normal.  Vital signs remained stable. She had no anion gap.  She
recovered rapidly following extubation and was alert and
oriented throughout the remainder of her admission without
residual effects of her ingestion. She was evaluated by
psychiatry who felt that she was not a safe discharge home and
recommended a psychiatric admission following discharge from th
medical service.  She was continued on a 1:1 sitter throughout
her hospital course.
.
# s/p fall:  patient reported falling and hitting her head prior
to presentation to the hospital.  As above, initial head CT had
? of SDH which was no evident on repeat imaging at [**Hospital1 18**].  Neck
CT was negative.  Her C spine was cleared with good range of
motion and no pain with range of motion and C collar was removed
without subsequent problem.
.
# Mental status: Per outside hospital she had a SDH but no
evidence of acute ICH per CT head performed at [**Hospital1 18**]. Altered
mental status most likely secondary to combination of overdose
and medications given at the OSH.  As above, she quickly
recovered from acute episode and remained alert and oriented
throughout admission although emotionally labile.  As above, she
will require a psychiatric admission at the time of discharge.
.
# Retrobulbar mass: Known mass and has been previously worked
up. Was supposed to get surgery at [**Hospital6 **]
a few weeks ago but was put off because she came down with
pneumonia/asthma exacerbation. There was believed to be no need
for ophthomology to see the patient while in house.  She should
follow up as an outpatient regarding further management as
previously scheduled.
.
# Enlarged thyroid: found incidentally on CT scan.  TSH normal.
No complaints of review of symptoms to suggest abnormality.
Will likely benefit from further work up as an outpatient.
.
# EtOH. Per pt this was a one time ingestion, she does not drink
regularly.  She was placed on a CIWA scale but had no evidence
of withdrawal and required no medication. Initially started on
thiamine, folate, MVI but stopped once history was confirmed.
