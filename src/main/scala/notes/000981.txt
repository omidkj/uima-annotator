HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 27294**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 1444**] on [**2138-3-11**], for
recurrent bleeding in his left pelvis.  He had a hip
replacement done almost 20 years ago in [**Country 6171**] for a hip
infection he developed as a child.  Mr. [**Known lastname 27294**] did well with
his original hip replacement until [**2134**] when he was seen at
[**Hospital1 69**], at which time he was
found to have a loose prosthesis with extensive osteolysis.
He attempted a reconstruction in [**2136-8-8**].  However,
he had extensive bone loss and reconstruction was not
possible.  He was left with a resection arthroplasty.
Over the ensuing months Mr. [**Known lastname 27294**] had recurrent collections
of fluid of his left thigh.  These were initially drained
successfully.  He was also on Coumadin therapy for deep
venous thrombosis.  He was seen at [**Hospital6 1130**] by Oncology Service for recurrent collection of
seroma in his left thigh.  He was also seen by an orthopaedic
oncologist.  Neither of these workups revealed any cause of
the recurrent left thigh collection.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2138-3-20**], at [**Hospital1 190**], the patient had a left hip exploration with
placement of Hemovac. On [**2138-4-1**], he had a left hip
exploration and a femur resection.  On [**4-21**] and [**2138-4-25**],
he went to Interventional Radiology to have embolization of two
vessels off the superficial femoral artery and embolization
of two distal branches of the deep femoral artery.  On
[**2138-5-6**], he had a left hip disarticulation.  On [**2138-5-30**], a Plastic Surgery consultation was obtained.  They said
there was no role for flap.  On [**2138-5-12**], a Vascular
Surgery consultation was obtained stating that bleeding was
most likely venous, and embolization had no further role.  On
[**5-15**], a PICC line was placed.  On [**5-15**], a Medication
consultation for tachycardia was obtained, and a beta blocker
was started.  On [**5-21**], and echocardiogram revealed normal
left ventricular function and an ejection fraction of 55%.

From the period of [**5-27**] to [**7-7**], the patient had 12
incision and drainages of left thigh/groin wound.  The
patient had chest pain on [**7-13**] and was ruled out for a
myocardial infarction.  The patient had a spiral CT done on
[**7-13**] as well which revealed multiple emboli in the left
and right pulmonary arteries.  At that time [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 260**]
filter was placed.  A chest tube was also placed for
hemothorax which had an initial output of 1200 mL.

The patient was transferred to the floor on [**2138-7-18**].
Total parenteral nutrition was started on approximately
[**2138-7-20**].  The patient was transferred back to the
Surgical Intensive Care Unit in respiratory distress on
[**2138-7-29**].  At that point he was intubated, and the
chest tube had an output of 1 liter.  Repeat embolizations
were attempted of the superior gluteal artery on [**2138-8-6**].

Throughout the admission, the patient received approximately
110 units of packed red blood cells.  Two more dressing
changes were performed in [**2138-8-9**].  Consultations
obtained during admission were as follows:  Pain Service.
Plastic Surgery revealed no role for flap.
Hematology/Oncology workup including factor VIII [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] factor bleeding time was completely normal.
Vascular Surgery consultation revealed that most likely the
bleeding was venous in nature.  Interventional Radiology
performed embolization on several occasions.  Medicine
consultation was obtained.  Infectious Disease consultation
was also obtained.  The patient had vancomycin-resistant
osteomyelitis, and candidal line infection.  He was initially
started on ampicillin, ceftriaxone, and Flagyl.  These were
discontinued.  He was then placed on cefepime and vancomycin.
These were then discontinued, and he was started on
piperacillin and gentamicin, and these were discontinued.  He
was then started on imipenem and linezolid which were both
discontinued on [**8-16**].  He was also started on Bactrim,
levofloxacin, and fluconazole.  Blood cultures obtained on
[**8-14**] also showed stenotrophomonas mysophilia
bacteremia.

The patient was made comfort measures only on [**2138-8-25**].  This was done with the help of the Ethics Committee.
All other services including Hematology/Oncology,
Orthopaedic/Oncology, Pulmonary, Medicine, Vascular, Plastic,
and Surgical Intensive Care Unit team all agreed there were
no other medical actions which could be taken.  The patient
deceased at 11:40 a.m. on [**2138-8-25**].

CAUSE OF DEATH:  Respiratory failure, sepsis, pelvic
osteomyelitis, bleeding diathesis of unknown cause.
