Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] y.o. female s/p ERCP w/sphincterotomy now with GIB.
.
1) GIB: Patient s/p ERCP with sphincterotomy with choledochal
cyst. Initial Hct 32 dropped to 21 with frank melena. Patient
hemodynamically stable but transfered to ICU for close
monitoring. Patient was transfused 2 units of pRBCs over night
with improvement in Hct to 27 with drop again to 23 and
transfused another unit of pRBCs. EGD performed on [**10-27**] which
showed no source for bleeding. Now Hct stable at 26 x 2 and then
increaed to 28. No melena x 1 day, although likely to pass
bloody stool for several days. Vital signs have been stable
throughout with episode of bradycardia to 30s x 1. Patient
treated wtih IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] for GI bleed. Diet advanced slowly on
[**10-28**] with clears, tolerating well - advanced to full.  Hct
stable.
.
2) A. Fib: Patient has been in A. Fib since admission, history
of arrythmia likely although PCP does not now why patient on
Dig. EKG on admission showed inferior TWI and flattening, no
prior EKG for comparison. CE cycled given possibility of
ischemia with large blood loss. CE were negative x 2. Digoxin
level was 1.5. Patient has had slow rate, episode of bradycardia
therefore Dig held on [**2052-10-26**]. Not on anticoagulation, frail,
unstable therefore fall risk significant, also concern with
endoscopic procedures and GIB.  Will continue to hold Dig and
follow rate, will restart if needed. No anticoagulation at this
time.  Will need to follow up with her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]: anticoagulation
and digitalis once stablized.
.
3) CHF: patient on lasix and dig at home, hx of AS with ESM on
exam, loud, radiating to carotids. Will continue lasix given
transfusions, care not to drop preload too much given
obstruction to cardiac output.  Once stable wiill continue lasix
per home regimen. Likely to benefit from ASA as outpatient, once
Hct stable.
.
4) Code: DNR DNI

Sent to rehabilitation hospital in [**Location (un) 10072**] for planned
short (approx. one week) stay for conditioning for d/c home.
