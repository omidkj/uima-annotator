Chief Complaint:
new diagnosis of AML

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1968**] is an 86yoF with a history of essential thrombocytosis
(previously on hydroxyurea), anorectal cancer in remission s/p

transferred from [**Hospital3 **] hospital for possible acute leukemia.


She was in her usual state of health through last week when she
noted general feelings of malaise and unwellness. She had been
seen at [**Hospital3 **] by her oncologist with a reportedly normal Hb
and plt count, though leuks of 11 with bands and metas which
were attributed to a cold. She had chest pain and presented to
[**Hospital3 **] yesterday. She was ruled out for MI, though her WBC was
elevated to 88 with plts 90. Peripheral smear showed blasts
according to oncology, and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management of a possible acute leukemia. She had been
off of hydroxyurea since diagnosed with anorectal cancer in [**2134**]
and had not restarted.

Imaging:
CXR [**8-7**]: IMPRESSION:   Technically limited radiograph due to
motion artifact, limiting assessment of lung bases.  Considering
clinical suspicion for infection, repeat radiograph with
suspended inspiration is recommended to exclude subtle basilar
consolidation or small pleural effusions.

CXR [**8-7**]: IMPRESSION: 1.  New interstitial edema. 2.  Confluent
right infrahilar opacity, which may represent asymmetrical
edema, but followup radiographs after diuresis would be helpful
to exclude a developing focus of pneumonia.

Pheresis catheter placement [**8-7**] (PRELIM): IMPRESSION:
Successful placement of a left internal jugular temporary
pheresis catheter. The tip lies in the distal SVC and is ready
for use.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT/PLAN:  86 yo female with new diagnosis of AML in the
setting of chest pain. Her respiratory status appears stable,
chest pain likely related to AML, and unlikely cardiac ischemia
give negative cardiac enzymes at outside hospital, and EKG w/o
signs of ischemia.

ACUTE ISSUES:
# AML:  Acute AML diagnosed from flow cytometry from peripheral
blood at [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital.  Likely secondary leukemia
from prior chemotherapy and XRT for anal cancer.  Admitted with
WBC 93.3K with 78-80% blasts and leukemia cutis with papules on
trunk.  Patient became acutely acutely short of breath on
hospital day 2 concerning for leukostasis and was transfered to
the ICU for leukophoresis. Patient completed two days of
leukophoresis on [**8-7**] and [**8-8**] with WBC of 5.4 on [**8-9**].  Patient
completed 7 days of low dose Cytarabine (100 mg/m2 on D1-7).
When her counts started to recover, she had again circulating
blasts, and she was subsequently treated with 5 days of
decitabine.  She was started on hydroxyurea during the last days
of her hospitalization and it was uptitrated to 500mg in the
morning and 1000mg in the evening at time of discharge. She was
also started on flucanozole prophylaxis for fungal infections at
the time of discharge.   She never experienced a febrile
complication.  Tentatively the plan is to treat with decitabine
Q4 weeks as long as tolerated.

# Hypoxia: Patient became acutely short of breath with oxygen
demands up to 5L.  Most likely secondary to volume overload as
patient continued to need oxygen after leukophoresis and
improved after multiple liters of fluids were diuresed off with
Lasix. Patient no longer requires supplemental oxygen.

# GI bleed: Patient had an episode of bright red blood from her
rectum and passed 3 blood clots the morning of [**2134-8-19**]. GI was
consulted and they believed it was most likely secondary to
radiation proctitis. Increased transfusion goal to Hct > 27 and
Plt > 50 for several days. Her bleeding stopped within 24 hours.
Her blood counts were stable in the last days of her
hospitalization and there were no clinical signs of acute
bleeding reoccurence. At the time of discharge her tranfusion
threasholds were Plt >20 and Hct >24.

# Atrial Fibrilation. New onset during this hospitalization.
Cardiac markers showed no acute ischemia.  Patient fluctuates
between A. Fib and sinus rhythm during the hospital stay with
one episode of A. Flutter in the setting of electrolyte
imbalance.  Managed with Diltiazem
