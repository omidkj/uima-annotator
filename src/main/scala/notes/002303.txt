Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5606**]
Chief Complaint:
Chief Complaint:  LLE pain and SOB

Reason for MICU transfer:  close hemodynamic monitoring


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 70 yo M with a hx of PE/DVT [**8-23**] whose
anticoagulation was recently stopped [**3-30**] after a neg CTA and
negative doppler study, who now presents with recurrent DVT/PE.
He reports experiencing left sided lower extremity edema that
has been present since his initial DVT presentation [**8-23**].  This
became significantly work for the past 2 days, along with left
foot pain.  He presented to [**Hospital3 **], where he was
found to have an extensive DVT in the LLE and was given a dose
of lovenox 100 mg at 0220 and coumadin 10 mg at 0200.  He also
reportedly endorsed some discomfort and a CTA revealed a saddle
PE.  He was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management. Pt reports he is only minimally ambulatory due to
"pinched nerves in the spine" that have been active for the past
2.5 years.  He has been even less active more recently, given
that he experiences LLE radicular pain and SOB with any
ambulation after about one minute. He does feel his SOB was
particularly worse this past friday and believes his blood clots
are related to his lack of ambulation.

In the ED, initial VS were:  97.6 57 188/77 16 99% 2L Nasal
Cannula.  Reportedly a bedside u/s showed no right heart strain.
ECG showed did not show RHS, but did show old inferior and
possible anterior infacts. Labs were notable for a proBNP of 565
and a negative trop.

On arrival to the MICU, the patient states he feels
uncomfortable, but this is due to his chronic radicular pain.
He denies feeling chest discomfort, SOB, palpitations or
dizziness.

Review of systems:
Per HPI, also reports recent bout of diarrhea about 1 month ago,
resolved with stopping PO Mg, metformin and starting immodium.
Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies  coughor wheezing. Denies chest pain, chest pressure,
palpitations. Denies constipation, abdominal pain, dark or
bloody stools. He does report recent bleeding hemorrhoids that
occurred in setting of [**Last Name (un) **] prep last week.  Denies dysuria,
frequency, or urgency. Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies
rashes or skin changes.

3. Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis or pancreatitis.
.
[**2191-5-11**] ECHO:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is high normal. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular
systolic function. Moderate mitral regurgitation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 70 yo M with Hx of DVT/PE who recently completed a
course of anticoagulation and now presents with extensive LE DVT
and saddle PE.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
.
# PE/DVT - The patient has a history of PE/DVT which was treated
for approximately 7 months and had discontinued treatment in
[**Month (only) 547**].  The patient is up to date on cancer screening with a
recent colonoscopy (with a reported polyp seen -path pending),
normal PSA.  He does have a hx of prostate and bladder cancer.
He is relatively immobile.  There is no family history of blood
clots or other bleeding disorders.  He was transferred from
[**Hospital3 2783**] to the ICU at [**Hospital1 18**] for close hemodynamic
monitoring.  The patient did not have any SOB at rest but did
endorse some DOE that was worse recently.  He was treated with a
heparin gtt and bridged to coumadin.  Hematology was consulted
regarding the need for further hypocoagulable work up and a
question of the need for an IVC filter.  They did not feel
either was necessary but recommended that he have a bridge to
coumadin for 48 hrs and that he remain on coumadin life long.
The pt was not bridged with lovenox given his weight was> 100kg.
 A TTE was obtained which did not show evidence of RV strain.
it was a limited study due to his obesity but showed no major
structural abnormalities with only mild LVH.  The patient never
required oxygen.  He was able to ambulate the hallways without
significant difficulty prior to discharge.  His foot pain that
he had at admission resolved.
.
#HTN - his antihypertensives were held at admission. Metoprolol
and HCTZ were restarted and during his hospitalization and as he
remained hypertensives to the 140-170s, Avapro was restarted at
discharge as well.
.
# DM - Byetta and glimepramide were held during his
hospitalization and restarted on discharge.  He was continued on
 Lantus qhs and a humalog SS.
.
# CAD s/p CABG - continued ASA, pravastatin, BB.
.
# HL - continued pravastatin
.
# Radicular pain - chronic, continued on quinine.
