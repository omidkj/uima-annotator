Brief Hospital Course:
AP: 86 yo M with neurogenic bladder and chronic indwelling
catheter presenting with poor PO intake, low UOP, UTI consistent
with urosepsis given elevated lactate, poor UOP, hypotension and
source.
.
1)Urosepsis/Shock: Overflow incontinence from neurogenic
bladder, chronic indwelling catheter presents with multiple drug
resistant UTI, hypotension refractory to IVF. He was initially
treated with cefepime given previous sensitivities, add vanco
given h/o Gram + sepsis and refractory hypotension. His foley
was changed, Urine cultures here grew GNR, he had [**12-26**] blood
cultures with coag neg staph. He had diarrhea which was C-Diff
posisitve. He was treated for C-Diff with flagyl, his Abx course
was changed from cefepime to meropenem based on sensitivities,
his Vanco IV was d/c'd and continued on PO Flagyl for C-diff.
His lactate was elevated and increased to 7.4 on [**8-21**] despite
11L IVF. His pressors were changed from Neo to Levophed for
persistently elevated lactate despite IVF, ECHO did not show
wall motion abnormalities which suggested infectious process as
opposed to cardiogenic shock.
Patient's lactate continued to rise without any improvement with
maximal therapy. Given his overall poor prognosis, decision was
made to make patient CMO on medical grounds.
Patient passed away on [**2172-8-24**] at 8AM. Attending was notified. No
post-mortem was performed since patient had no next of [**Doctor First Name **].
