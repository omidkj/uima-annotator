PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Pulse 75,
blood pressure symmetric in both arms, 130s/80s.  General:

cervical adenopathy. Neck:  Supple without carotid bruits.
Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart:  Regular
without murmur.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended
without organomegaly.  Extremities:  Warm without edema.  He
has no evidence of lower extremity varicosities.
Neurological:  A careful neurological examination was

The only exception to this is a slight deviation of the
tongue to the right.  Pulses:  He has 2+ femoral pulses
bilaterally without bruits.  He has 1+ DP, 1+ PT, and 2+
radial pulses.

HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 28212**] was admitted to the [**Hospital6 1760**] on [**2101-1-17**].  On the date of
admission, he underwent a left atrial myxoma removal, with a
patch repair of the resulting atrial septal defect.  The
procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] and assisted by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 21815**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7625**].

The procedure was performed with a bypass time of 114 minutes
and a cross-clamp time of 76 minutes.  The procedure was
performed without complication.  Please see the previously
dictated operative not for more details.

At the termination of the procedure, Mr. [**Known lastname 28212**] was
transported intubated to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit.

Mr. [**Known lastname 28212**] did well in his postoperative course and was
extubated on the day of the operation.  He required only
minimal perioperative pressor support and was able to be
discharged to the Patient Care floor on postoperative day
number one.

One issue that did arise was that Mr. [**Known lastname 46249**] oxygenation
was somewhat decreased and did not respond very well to
oxygen therapy.  A chest x-ray revealed a left lower lobe
infiltrate.  This occurred in the setting of an elevated
white count.  The diagnosis of pneumonia was made and he was
begun on a seven day course of levofloxacin.

Mr. [**Known lastname 28212**] [**Last Name (Titles) 27836**] well with physical therapy.  He was
able to clear level V ambulation without difficulty.  By
postoperative day number three, his oxygenation was still
somewhat a issue and a repeat chest x-ray was obtained.  At
this point, a large effusion had gathered on the left side.
A flexible Cook catheter was introduced in the left pleural
space and left to suction overnight.  His left pleural cavity
drained 1,500 cc of serosanguinous fluid consistent with a
pleural effusion.

A follow-up x-ray on the following morning revealed the
drained effusion and a well-inflated lung.  The catheter was
removed without incident.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  This a well-appearing
gentleman who is very comfortable.  Vital signs:  Temperature
99.4, pulse 75, blood pressure 113/62, breathing 20 breaths
per minute, and saturating 92% on room air.  General:  He was
alert and oriented times three.  Lungs:  Clear to
auscultation bilaterally with slightly diminished sounds at
the left base.  Heart:  Regular.  His incision was well
healed without any evidence of erythema or exudate.  Abdomen:
Soft, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities:  The lower
extremities are without any evidence of edema.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Status post removal of left atrium
myxoma.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 411**] in four weeks.

The patient should follow-up with his cardiologist, Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3924**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 20222**], at the [**Hospital1 **] Heart Center.  He should
follow-up within the next week.
