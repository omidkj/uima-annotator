Service:  Medicine Intensive Care Unit - Green Team

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Change in mental status.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65 year old man with
past medical history notable for coronary artery disease,
congestive heart failure, Type 2 diabetes, paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation who was found in a temporary residence at a
local [**Company 3596**] by his attorney who found the patient in his own
stool and urine in bed, conscious but disoriented.  The
patient has not had any clear memory of any preceding
symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, seizures,
head trauma, chills, fever, melena or bright red blood per
rectum.  The patient denies any alcohol or illicit drug
consumption.  He did admit to taking Percocet, quantity is
unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] had obtained this Percocet from the [**Hospital6 1760**] Emergency Department.  He was
given this by the Emergency Department on [**2199-3-8**]
after he fell.  He tripped at his daughter's house in [**Location (un) 7498**].  Chest x-ray was negative for rib fractures.  When
the patient was found, by report there were no pills left of
45 tablets of Percocet and he was brought to the Emergency
Department.  Yet, the patient only admits to taking two to
perhaps five tablets of Percocet.  He claims that he has been
staying at the [**Company 3596**] while he settles a 65 million dollar
estate claim.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Notable for coronary artery disease,
three vessel disease including 30% left main, 95%, 85% left
anterior descending and 100% right coronary artery.  Also he
has a history of congestive heart failure with 10% ejection
fraction.  Type 2 diabetes, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation,
an supraventricular tachycardia, splenic hematoma status post
inferior vena cava filter placement in [**2195**] secondary to a
possible motor vehicle accident, status post motor vehicle
accident with multiple rib fractures, prior cerebrovascular
accidents and status post right hip arthroplasty, status post
motor vehicle accident, also bilateral knee surgery.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies smoking, drinking ever or
any illicit substances.  He is married.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unclear, the patient is not aware of any
family history of any diseases.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  The patient is uncertain but he
says he takes one tablet of Lasix mg unknown.  He takes "a
heart medication," and he claims he takes insulin 57 units of
some sort of insulin split over two doses daily.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination he had a temperature of
97.2, heartrate 89, blood pressure 130/85, respirations 30
and breathing 95% on room air.  In general appearance he was
a disheveled, groggy middle-aged man.  He was notable for dry
tongue, poor dentition with possible bite injury of right
upper lip and cheek, notable scleral jaundice but no
jugulovenous distension and no adenopathy.  Heart was mildly
tachycardiac on examination.  Lungs were notable for
bibasilar crackles with the left greater than right.  The
abdomen was obese, soft, nontender.  There was no
organomegaly.  Extremities were notable for 1+ pitting and
lower extremity edema.  They were cold to the touch.  The
patient was neurologically alert and oriented times three
with some groggy speech.  He has three beat lateral
nystagmus.  Cranial nerves II through XII were intact, he
moved all extremities.  There was noted, however, asterixes
and decreased pinprick sensation of both calves bilaterally
anteriorly.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory studies were notable for white
blood cell count of 12.1, hematocrit 48, platelets 162.
Chem-7 was notable for a sodium of 140, potassium 5.7,
chloride 103, bicarbonate 21, BUN 82 and creatinine 3.6 with
a baseline approximately 1.0 and glucose of 286.  Calcium was
9.6, magnesium 2.6, phosphate 4.7.  His transaminases were
found to be markedly elevated.  The ALT was 1,233, AST 2,119,
alkaline phosphatase 92, total bilirubin 4.2, amylase 54,
lipase 44, albumin 3.3, creatinine kinase was 1795, MB 21 and
MB index 4.2 and troponins were 2.7.  Urine cultures were
also drawn.  Chest x-rays were showing stable cardiomegaly
with increased opacities of both lung bases, suggesting
pneumonia.  No pleural effusions were present and pulmonary
vasculature were unremarkable.  Right upper quadrant
ultrasounds were performed to rule out, obstruction series,
normal gallbladder, no cholecystitis, no observable biliary
obstruction.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given the missing Percocet and the empty
bottle on the patient's bedside as well as the transaminases,
the immediate concern was of acetaminophen toxicity secondary
to Percocet overdose.  The patient was immediately put on
intravenous acetycysteine with initial loading dose
followed by a continuous infusion of the intravenous Mucomyst
solution.  The patient continued to be somewhat tachypneic
during this hospital course.  He was being admitted to the
Intensive Care Unit because of expected toxicity.  He was
also empirically treated with antibiotics, in particular he
was treated with Clindamycin, Levofloxacin to cover a
community-acquired or aspiration pneumonia.  The patient was
also tachycardiac.  He had been given both intravenous and
p.o. Lopressor in the Emergency Department.  Here on the
floor he was put initially on the Diltiazem drip for rate
control.  Cardiac enzymes were continued to be cycled.  He
had borderline positive CKMBs and troponins during his
course.  He was put on Lactulose because of his noted
asterixis.  His INR continued to rise during his
hospitalization.

He was started on Vitamin K, Potassium and
acute renal failure was believed to be secondary to
dehydration given his status and condition when found in his
[**Company 3596**] room.  He was given boluses of 250 cc of normal saline,
smaller boluses were given given the patient's known
congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of
approximately 10%.  However, during the second day of the
patient's hospitalization he became increasingly tachypneic
and less responsive.  He was also found to be hypotensive.
Extremities were cool on touch.  This was believed to be
possibly evidence of cardiogenic shock at which point the
patient was electively intubated for impending respiratory
failure.  Over the courses of the evening, the patient
developed cardiac arrest.  It should be noted that prior to
that his urine output dropped to 0.

The patient's hypotension progressed.  A cuff blood pressure was
unable to be obtained as well as wide complex bradycardia.  He
received 1 mg of Atropine.  Dopamine was started 10 mcg/min.
Asystole followed.  Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was started. He
went into ventricular fibrillation and was shocked at 200
joules and given 1 mg of Epinephrine, shocked subsequently at
360 joules with another mg of Epinephrine and 360 joules
again with 1 mg of Epinephrine.  He was developed atrial
fibrillation with wide complex.  He was given Amiodarone,
bolus of 150 mg.  Asystole reappeared and cardiopulmonary
resuscitation was resumed.  The patient was given 1 amp of
bicarbonate.  His ventricular fibrillation developed.  He was
given a shock at 360 joules and then returned to sinus rate
in the 60s.  A femoral arterial line was obtained and the
blood pressure was measured to be in the 30s to 40s systolic.
Vasopressin was started and blood pressure was then in the
70s to 80s systolic with a mean atrial pressure in the 60s.
He was given a second amp of bicarbonate and 2 amps of
Potassium Chloride.  Attempts were made to contact his wife
at the time.  The patient was pseudostabilized on Vasopressor
two hours with arterial blood gases which were improving.
Echocardiogram was obtained to rule out tamponade, there
was no tamponade effusion or global akinesis.  At 3 AM
despite maximum persistence the patient developed hypotension
and heartrate to the 40s.  Again he coded and received
Atropine times two, Epinephrine one with improvement in pulse
and respiration.  Vasopressin was discontinued with
continuation of Levophed and addition of epinephrine.  Repeat
arterial blood gases post the arr
