Allergies:
Amiodarone

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2234**]
Chief Complaint:
Secretions, leukocytosis, fever, hypernatremia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
77 yo M with PMH of CAD/CABG, DM, CRI, AAA/TAA repair, multiple
CVA, seizure d/o with recent prolonged hospitalization [**Date range (1) 104709**]
for aspiration pneumonia and sepsis requiring intubation and
trach/PEG sent from [**Last Name (un) 1188**] house with secretions,
leukocytosis, fever, hypernatremia.
.
After his last hospitalization, he was successfully weaned from
trach at [**Hospital1 **] and then moved to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**4-18**]. Noted
over the past week worsened respiratory congestion, fatigue,
decreased PO and social interaction (baseline poor MS).
Reportedly no diarrhea or pain. Labs on [**5-13**] revealed elevated
WBC 25 and he was staretd on levofloxacin and flagyl for concern
of recurrent aspiration pneumonia with improvement of WBC 13.
Also found to be hypernatremic that refractory to 'hydration',
increasing from 150->155. Given acute worsening, patient sent to
[**Hospital1 18**] ED for evaluation. DNR reversed by family to FULL CODE,
and requesting aggressive measures.
.
In the ED, T 101.8, HR 70s, labile BPs (170-215/90-120), RR 22,
95% RA. Noted to have respiratory congestion with copious
secretions, warm/dry skin, A&Ox1, guaiac negative. Na+ 154, WBC
18 with left shift, no bands, lactate 1.9. U/A negative and
blood cultures sent. Given vancomycin, cefepime, and
levofloxacin for presumed aspiration PNA. Clear CXR. CT head
negative. ECG unchanged. Admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for aspiration PNA,
hypernatremia, needs too much nursing care to go to
floor/aspiration risk.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2121-5-15**] 5:45 PM

FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage. Again noted
are moderately severe periventricular white matter
hypodensities, consistent with chronic microvascular ischemia.
The extra-axial spaces, sulci and ventricles are prominent,
consistent with age-related involutional changes. Again noted
are areas of encephalomalacia in the right occipital and left
temporoparietal lobe. Lacunar infarcts within the basal ganglia
are again noted. There is no shift of normally midline
structures or edema. Surrounding soft tissues and osseous
structures are unremarkable. There is a mucosal thickening,
involving left maxillary sinus, similar in appearance when
compared to [**2119-4-29**].

IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. No
interval change since [**2119-4-29**].
==========================================
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2121-5-15**] 4:10 PM
FINDINGS: The lung volumes are low. The previously noted diffuse
perihilar opacities have resolved. Currently, the lungs are
clear without consolidation or edema. There is a dual-chamber
pacemaker, stable in course and position. The tracheostomy has
been removed. There is a tortuous atherosclerotic aorta. The
cardiac silhouette size is stable and likely accentuated due to
low lung volumes. No effusion or pneumothorax is evident.

IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes. Otherwise, the lungs are clear
with a hypertensive cardiomediastinal configuration.
===========================================
UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US RIGHT  [**2121-5-16**] 9:35 AM

Grayscale, color flow, and Doppler images of the right upper
extremity were obtained. The jugular vein, subclavian vein,
axillary vein, brachial veins, and the basilic and the cephalic
vein demonstrate normal compressibility, respiratory variation
in venous flow, and venous augmentation.

IMPRESSION: No DVT in the right upper extremity.
===========================================
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2121-5-16**] 6:59 AM
SINGLE SEMI-UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST AT APPROXIMATELY 7:00
A.M.: A dual-lead pacemaker overlying the left hemithorax and
median sternotomy wires are unchanged and intact. There is a new
airspace opacity along the medial aspect of the right lower lobe
that could represent aspiration, given the clinical history.
Mild cardiomegaly with a tortuous aorta is unchanged. There is
no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: New opacity in the medial right lower lobe that
could represent aspiration, given the clinical history.

Discharge Labs:


Brief Hospital Course:
77 year old male with PMH of stroke, presenting with increased
secretions, altered mental status and hypernatremia.

1. aspiration pneumonia -- He was initially admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
for monitoring, and placed on broad spectrum antibiotics for
health care associated organisms, given his recent
hospitalization.  Initial chest xray showed no infiltrate, but
aspiration was suspected given his copious purulent secretions.
A subsequent xray showed RLL infiltrate.  He was continued on
vancomycin and cefepime, and transferred to the floor on the
hospital medicine service.   Received 8 day course of
vanc/cefipime.  Pulm status returned to baseline, no
supplemental oxygen, breathing comfortably by discahrge.

2. hypernatremia -- secondary to volume depletion.  Increased
free water flushes through PEG tube and supplemented with IV
water--slowly improved sodium to normal levels.  On discharge,
will continue free water flushes at 300q4h--this seems to have
stabilized sodium

3. alter
