atropine X2, HCO3 X2 and narcan 6 mg.  Pt initially taken to
[**Hospital 8125**] Hospital where intial BP 58/22. Pt treated with IV fluid
bolus with improvement in his BP and 2amp of bicarb. Pupils were
fixed and dilated. Initial EtOH level was 265. Initial ABG
6.94/77/66/16. CT Head negative for acute bleed.  He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ongoing care.

On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, vitals: HR 130, 150/100. Neurologic
exam on arrival included pupils fixed and non-reactive at 6mm.
No withdrawal of extremities to pain. CXR showed ET in place. He
was started on the Artic Sun post-arrest hypothermia protocol. 2
PIVs were placed and he was started on propofol for sedation.
ABG on arrival: 7.41/24/172/16. Labs showed serum EtOH of 198.
Serum benzo screen positive.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 30 yo male s/p cardiac arrest in the setting of
suspected heroin overdose. Reported downtime of ~10min in the
field f/b 30min of CPR before restoration of vital signs.
Admitted to the Medical ICU for Artic Sun post-arrest induced
mild hypothermia protocol.

#Anoxic brain injury - Minimal neurologic response prior to
initiation of cooling protocol. 24hr protocol completed and
rewarming initiated. During rewarming, he developed profound
rigors and subsequently became febrile to 104. The rigors were
not responsive to increasing sedation or demerol, thus he was
re-paralyzed. The following morning, the paralytic was
discontinued, and he developed movements more consistent with
seizure activity most prominent in the R arm and R leg.  He was
loaded with phenytoin with some improvement in seizure activity
and neurology was consulted. He developed persistent
breakthrough seizure-like movements requiring boluses of
phenytoin and initiation of Keppra.  A video EEG was performed
and results showed diffuse encephalopathic changes without
evidence of electrographic seizures. An MRI was performed on
[**2145-10-6**] which revealed findings c/w global infaraction,
anoxic brain injury, and diffuse cerebal edema. On the morning
of [**2145-10-7**], pt was noted to have a change in his pupillary exam
and papilledema. A STAT head CT revealed complete loss of
grey-white matter differentiation c/w diffuse cerebral edema. Pt
was started on mannitol infusion, HOB to 30 degrees, and
hyperventilated to a PCO2 of 28.  Neurosurgery was consulted,
placed a bolt, found the initial ICP to be 24. Pt was continued
on mannitol q6h, Keppra, and continous ICP monitoring (ICPs
ranged from 20s-60s). Neurologic exams off-sedation revealed
absent corneal reflexes, absent cold calorics, and no response
to painful stimuli. Apnea tests x 2 ([**10-11**], [**10-13**]) revealed that
patient continued to demonstrate respiratory effort, and thus
did not meet criteria for brain death. After ongoing discussions
with the family regarding his poor prognosis, and based on
previously expressed wishes of the patient, the family decided
to shift goals of care to CMO on the morning of [**2145-10-14**]. He was
extubated, made comfortable with morphine, and declared dead at
1:39pm on [**2145-10-14**]. NEOB had been contact[**Name (NI) **] and pt was ruled out
for donation after cardiac death.

# S/p Cardiopulmonary Arrest: Pt received the 24hr post-arrest
hypothermia protocol. Cardiac enzymes were cycled and were
negative for any significant ischemia. A transthoracic ECHO done
on [**2145-10-5**] revelead normal structure and function. Pt remained
hemodynamically stable without need for vasopressor support.

#Fever: Pt became febrile in the midst of diffuse rigors. Blood,
urine, and sputum cultures were sent. A CXR on [**2145-10-6**] revealed
a new LLL opacity, consistent with atelectasis vs. infiltrate.
He was started on Levofloxacin and Flagyl to cover for possible
aspiration. He was switched to Ceftriaxone and Flagyl the
following morning (concern for lowering the seizure threshold on
flouroquinolones). Blood and urine cultures were negative but
sputum cultures were positive for Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and
Staph Aureus. Bronchoscopy on [**2145-10-20**] revealed copious purulent
secretions. Pt was treated with appropriate IV antibiotics until
the decision made made to focus on CMO.

The family was provided with support from social work and the
hospital priest & chaplaincy services. They were at the bedside
when he expired.
