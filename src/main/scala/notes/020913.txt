LABORATORY DATA:  White count 19.3, hematocrit 35.3, platelet

limits.

Ultrasound of the lower extremities negative.

Chemistries with a sodium of 138, potassium 3.6, chloride 98,
bicarb 26, BUN 75, creatinine 2.6, glucose 176.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Left lower extremity cellulitis:  The
patient was initially started on Oxacillin; however, the
fevers persisted over the next 24-48 hrs and white cell count
continued to escalate. The patient was switched to Vancomycin and
Zosyn empirically as a result. Shortly thereafter, the patient
developed delirium and the patient's white blood cell count
continued to climb to 30,000, and he was clinically worsening.
He developed worsening renal function and increase in
transaminases as well.  Blood tests showed elevated D-dimer and
fibrinogen consistent with sepsis. The patient was taken to the
Operating Room with Vascular Surgery on [**2133-10-5**], for
exploration and debridement. Postoperatively the patient was
taken to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where he was stabilized
and was transferred to the floor on [**2133-10-6**].
In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, a central venous line was
placed, and fluid status was titrated to CVP.  CT of the leg did
not demonstrate any abscess but the study was done without
contrast due to renal impairment.  MRI was unable to be performed
given that the patient had
a surgical clip in the ethmoid sinus.  A LE Ultrasound was done
which did not any focal fluid collections and a gallium scan was
also done which confirmed these findings.
On transfer to the floor on [**2133-10-6**], the patient's
mental status was improving.  Surgical culture eventually grew
Oxacillin resistant staph aureus.  Antibiotics were narrowed to
Vancomycin alone.   He was afebrile for the
remainder of his hospital course. His white blood cell count
slowly trended down and was 11,000  on [**2133-10-12**].

Vancomycin was dosed for levels less than 15.  On [**2133-10-12**], a PICC line was placed, and his
Vancomycin is to be continued until [**2133-10-26**].

The Vascular Surgery Service followed the patient throughout
the hospital course and recommended that the patient continue
on antibiotics until the cellulitis had improved.  He may
still need a left BKA in the near future depending on his future
course.

2.  Acute on chronic renal failure:  The patient's creatinine
began to trend up on admission and peaked at 4.0.  This was
in the setting of sepsis from the leg infection but with
careful fluid management and supportive treatment, his creatinine
improved back to 2.0 on [**2133-10-12**] close to his baseline.

The patient initially had his immunosuppressants held except
for the Prednisone given that he had an acute infection.
Rapamune was restarted to its prior level of 2 mg
prior to discharge; however, the CellCept continued to be
held per Renal service.  Further management per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 805**],
his nephrologist.

3.  Diabetes:  Initially the patient's blood sugars were
difficult to control, and the patient was placed on an
insulin drip while he was in the Medical Intensive Care
Unit.

On transfer to the floor, the patient Lantus dose was
increased to 54, and his Humalog Insulin sliding scale was
tightened with improvement and control of his blood sugars.

4.  Herpes labialis:  The patient had herpes lesions around
his mouth, and given his immunocompromised state, he was
started on Acyclovir for a 14-day course.  The lesions
continued to improve throughout the hospitalization.

5.  Delirium:  The patient's delirium was attributed to a
combination of uremia and infection and had improved to near
baseline at the time of discharge.

6.  Elevated LFTs:  The patient had transaminases which
elevated to the low 1000s after going to the Operating Room.
This was thought to be either due to shock liver secondary to
hypertension or possible secondary to his anesthetic when he
went to the Operating Room.  The LFTs continued to trend down
throughout his hospital course without specific intervention.

DISPOSITION:  The patient needs two additional weeks of
intravenous Vancomycin, and a PICC line was placed for this
purpose.
Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy evaluated the
patient and determined that he would benefit from a short
stay of rehabilitation, and he was transferred to a
rehabilitation facility for skilled nursing care and physical
therapy.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Left lower extremity cellulitis, culture positive for MRSA.
2.  Acute on chronic renal failure.
3.  Delirium from sepsis.
4.  Diabetes mellitus.
5.  Status post renal transplant.
6. History of severe peripheral vascular disease with
     multiple amputations.
7.  Coronary artery disease, EF 35-40%.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient will follow-up with his primary care
physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 3**] well as Renal and Vascular Services.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Instructions were given to the
patient on discharge.

PROCEDURES:  Left lower extremity debridement on [**2133-10-5**].
