Brief Hospital Course:
CT [**Doctor First Name **]: Patient was taken to the operating room on [**2121-9-17**] for a
VATS with left lung resection please see operating report for
further detail. The patient tolerated his operation extremely
well and was transferred to the thoracic ICU. On postop day one
the patient was restarted on his home meds, weaned from a
neoepinepherine drip, chest tube continued on wall suction and
his foley catheter showed adequate urine output. The patient
also got 1 unit of packed red blood cells for a moderately low
hematocrit. His hematocrit responded appropriately. On postop
day 2 the EP saw him inorder to adjust his ICD . His chest tube
output decreased and his lisinopril was held because the
patient's systolic blood pressure was 100mmHg. On POD 3 the
patient got another unit of PRBCs additionally his chest tube
was discontinued and his lisinopril continued to be held. The
patient was tolerating a house diet and he was transferred to
the regular hospital floor. While on the hospital floor the
patient's creatinine trended up from 2.0 to 2.8. His bumex and
lisinopril were held while his dose of carvedilol was halved.
The patient had a poor appetite on post op day four and
consequently had low blood sugar recording. After which his
glipizide dose was held. Overnight between postop day four and
five the patient spiked a fever. He had a chest x-ray that
morning which was equivocal for effusion versus pneumonia. He
was also cultured for urine and blood both of which were
negative for infection. Although he did have a significant
amount of bacteria in his urine. Because of his chest x-ray he
was started on levoquin 500mg qd. By the afternoon of postop day
five the patient was afebrile and had no complaints. On postop
day six the patient was making good urine and his creatinine was
treading down, his white blood cell count remained normal. A
congestive heart failure consult was called inorder to optimize
the [**Hospital 228**] medical issues. They recommended that the patient
be restarted on bumex and begin working regularly with physical
therapy. Additionally the patient's hematocrit had slowed
trended down to 27. Given the patient's heart failure he was
transfused one unit of packed red blood cells.

Pt was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] for CHF management re: recent weight
gain and incr LE Edema.

[**Hospital Unit Name 196**] Course:

1. CHF. Stable w/o sx throughout admission. Likely severe
right-sided CHF (in this pt w/o resp symptoms), but ascites,
cirrhosis (by previous CT), and LE Edema. He rec'd Nesiritide
bolus upon [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] transfer and then on GTT (0.01-0.015 mcg/kg/min
IV) - which was adjusted on occasion because of int low SBPs.
Continued Carvedilol 3.125 mg PO BID, Lisinopril at 2.5 mg PO
QD, and Incr Bumetanide from 2 to 4 mg PO QD. Currently SBP
90s-100. Pt had 4.5L of ascitic fluid removed (deemed likely
cardiac ascites/cirrhosis) and had relief of baseline SOB.

2. Anemia. Pt had somewhat longstanding low HCT, but likely
recent blood loss contributing (occ hemoptysis), but unclear
etiology. The goal HCT was >30 in this CAD patient. HCT was as
low as 25.2 and the patient rec'd a total of 3U PRBC. Of note,
the pt had a mild transf rxns upon the first transfusion, but
blood bank transfusion fellow did not suggest premedication and
urged to continue transfusions when indicated. Our w/u of anemia
included: LDH, TBili, Haptoglobin, LDH, iron studies, folate,
B12 and heme check stool; all of which were WNL except for
elevated ferritin (recent surgery), low iron (likely iron
deficiency), low TIBC (likely secondary to elevated ferritin)
and increased T.Bili (likely from liver disease, not hemolysis).

3. Fevers. First developed on POD2 and was started on
Levofloxacin for a presumptive PNA. However, the initail fever
of 101 was after the first transfusion (where chills/rigors were
noted). However, a repeat CXR after a second fever (100.4)
revealed a new L Lung infiltrate. The patient was changed from
Levo to Cefotaz/Clinda for presumptive Nosocomial PNA (targeting
Pseudomonas, Gram Negs, and Anaerobes) and sent home on Clinda
PO and Cefotaz IV for an additional 7d course.

3. Cirrhosis/Ascites. Pt noted to have large amount of ascites.
Reported ascites for >3yrs and recent abdCT showing nodular
liver consistent with cirrhosis. Consulted hepatology. Tapped
4.5 L for diagnosis and therapeutic relief. SAAG was <1.1 and
thus, unlikely to be in portal HTN. Gm stain and culture on DC
were negative. PMN were <250. There were some reactive
mesothelial cells not consistent with cancer. Pt was neg for
HBV/HCV previous or current infection. He was instructed to
follow up with Hepatology who advised Spironolactone initiation
in the near future. Of note, he was not encephalopathic, and his
INR was 1.5 on DC.

4. CRI. Cr stable at 1.8-2.0.

4. CAD. Pt stable w/o sx. Continued Atorvastatin 10 mg PO QD,
Aspirin 81 mg PO QD.

5. DM. BGs 100-180s. Continued Glipizide 5 mg PO BID and
continue SSI.

6. Hypothroidism. TSH low at 0.10. Came to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] on Levothyroxine
250 mcg. We continued him on half that dose (back to
pre-admission dose) of 125 mcg PO QD.

7. PPx. SUBQ-Hep. Colace/Senna.

8. Code. Full.

9. Pain. Well controlled. Continued Tylenol PRN and
Oxycodone-Acetaminophen 1 TAB PO Q6H:PRN. Had a gouty flair i
