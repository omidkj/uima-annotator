Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 29250**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with history of CHF and
previous admissions for acute heart failure who presents with
acute onset dyspnea, without any chest pain. He has had multiple
admissions to [**Hospital1 18**], [**Hospital1 882**], and [**Hospital 100**] rehab within past
several months for CHF, C. difficile, and GI bleeding, the
latter two necessitating diuretic dose reduction with resultant
CHF exacerbations. Patient presents today after dyspnea while
getting up to go to the bathroom. He denied any chest pain
associated with this. EMS was called and administered 50mg IV
furosemide on initial evaluation and placed on non-rebreather
for decreased oxygen saturation. Patient was then brought to the
emergency room, where he was noted to also be hypertensive to
225/110. He was then placed also on a nitroglycerin gtt and for
his hypoxia, he was also started on BiPAP. Eventually, his blood
pressure improved to systolic 140s and his oxygenation improved
so that he was transitioned from BiPAP to nasal cannula and his
nitroglycerin gtt was turned off. He did receive a dose of
levofloxacin empirically prior to chest x-ray.

Of note, patient has been on long-standing oral vancomycin and
metronidazole for which the duration needs to be clarified by
discussion with [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.

Chest x-ray [**2114-3-16**]:
UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: The cardiac silhouette is
unchanged, and
appears to be within normal limits. Diffuse opacification of the
right
hemithorax with haziness of the pulmonary vascular markings is
compatible with pulmonary edema. Similar findings are seen
within the left lung, but not as severe in extent, compatible
with asymmetric edema. Bibasilar opacities are also
demonstrated, compatible with atelectasis. Small pleural
effusions are likely present. The aorta demonstrates
calcifications at its arch. No pneumothorax.

Chest x-ray [**2114-3-18**]:
FINDINGS: Compared to the prior study, there are worsening
pleural effusions bilaterally, but right more so than left.
Retrocardiac density is unchanged. Upper lungs remain clear. No
evidence for progressive distention of the pulmonary vessels. No
definite new consolidations. A stable well-circumscribed 2 cm
mass is seen right lower lobe which has been seen back to a CT
scan of [**2112**].

Renal artery ultrasound:
1. Small shrunken kidneys, more so on the right, with cortical
thinning and increased echogenicity consistent with chronic
kidney disease. Findings unchanged.
2. Multiple renal cysts as previously demonstrated.
3. Very limited Doppler examination due to patient's inability
to hold
breath. Normal arterial upstroke demonstrated at right renal
hilum.


Brief Hospital Course:
1) Acute on chronic systolic CHF - Thought secondary to worse
hypertension (presented with blood pressure 225/110).  Patient
transiently required nitroglycerin drip and non-invasive
positive pressure ventilation with BiPAP but this had been
titrated off by the time patient arrived in the CCU.  He
required a few more doses of IV furosemide, and was transitioned
back to his outpatient regimen of furosemide 60mg PO daily.
Patient was ruled out for MI with serial cardiac enzymes,
telemetry and EKG.  In addition, patient was started on
Isosorbide dinitrate for afterload reduction.  Records had
listed this medication as causing adverse effects (headache) but
patient tolerated it well while in the hospital.  Plan is to
continue furosemide, hydralazine, Isosorbide dinitrate and
follow-up with [**Hospital 1902**] clinic, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 401**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**] on [**2114-4-2**] at 1:00
PM.  Likely ischemic cardiomyopathy given history of MI, no
coronary angiographies per our records, perhaps due to patients
advanced chronic renal failure. This exacerbation likely
precipitated by uncontrolled hypertension and flash pulmonary
oedema.
.
2) Hypertension - Given dramatic elevation of blood pressure,
patient required nitroglycerin gtt temporarily.  He underwent
renal artery ultrasound to rule-out stenoiss, but this was a
limited evaluation.  He was started on Isordil in addition to
his other anti-hypertensives, and his blood pressure improved to
systolic of 150s.
.
3) Coronary artery disease - patient with previous history of
two MIs. No cardiac catherization reports recorded. Patient is
already on full dose statin, aspirin, carvedilol as outpatient.
Continued aspirin, statin, and carvedilol.
.
4)  Rhythm - Patient had normal sinus rhythm with left bundle
branch block.
.
5) COPD: Extensive smoking history, though no documented
obstructive disease by PFTs. Dyspnea secondary to CHF as above,
but can consider inhalers in addition if needed.
.
6) Diabetes: Patient with good control (repeat A1C this
admission was 5.8%) maintained on outpatient glipizide.
.
7) Chronic Renal insufficiency: Patient with admission Cr of 3.8
which appears to be his baseline. Patient not treated with an
ACE inhibitor as outpatient because on an allergy.  Has refused
dialysis in the past, but potassium was stable during this
admission and there were no signs of uremia.
.
8) C. difficile colitis - Patient continued his Vancomycin taper
and metronidazole which he was receiving at home, with plan to
complete this course on [**2114-3-20**].
.
9) Prophylaxis: Patient written for heparin subcutaneous for VTE
prophylaxis.
.
10) Code status: DNR/DNI
.
