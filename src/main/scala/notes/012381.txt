Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9240**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from [**First Name3 (LF) 1106**] surgery (ischemic left thumb, CHF, AFib
with RVR)

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardioversion
Thoracentesis
Left subclavian angioplasty
Right subclavian hemodialysis line


History of Present Illness:
75F CAD s/p CABG, PVD, ESRD, LUE ischemia from known subclavian
stenosis initially admitted to [**First Name3 (LF) 1106**] surgery service with
ischemic thumb.  Plan at that time was for heparin gtt and angio
to eval L subclavian stenosis.  Her hospital course has been
complicated by afib with RVR (160's) and hypotension (SBP 80's)
during HD.  She was seen by cardiology, cardioverted x 2 ([**2-28**]
and [**3-3**]) for hemodynamic instability, and started on amio.  The
patient became hypoxic after receiving anasthesia requiring
brief ICU stay for stabilization. Recently she has developed
worsening pulmonary edema and trigerred on [**3-6**] for hypoxia which
has since resolved.  She is going for HD again today as BP is
now good.  From surgical standpoint, she had a MRA today and
plan is for angio once medically stable and then decision on
need for surgical intervention.  Continues to be anticoagulated
with heparin and on vanco/cipro for ischemic thumb.  Transferred
to medicine for further management of CHF, Afib, and other
multiple chronic medical issues.
.
Currently denies SOB, dizziness, diarrhea, constpation, blood in
stools, abdominal pain. No recent infections, fevers, or chills.
At home, able to climb 1 flight stairs without SOB, 1 pillow
orthopnea. Has had 1 prior episode of AFib before this admission
at rehab after CABG 4 months prior.

.
ECG ([**2-27**]): Sinus rhythm. Baseline artifact makes interpretation
difficult. Bipihasic T waves in leads V4-V5 are non-specific.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2148-2-20**] artifact is more
pronounced and the T wave change in lead V5 could be positional.
.
LEFT HAND, THREE VIEWS ([**2-27**]):  There is no evidence of
fracture, malalignment, joint space abnormality, or significant
soft tissue abnormality.  Surrounding osseous and soft tissue
structures are unremarkable. IMPRESSION:  No evidence for
fracture, malalignment, or soft tissue abnormality.
.
CXR([**3-6**]): Moderate bilateral pleural effusion, right greater
than left, continues to increase. Heart is normal size and the
mediastinal caliber is stable, the simplest explanation for
these findings is cardiac decompensation.
.
MRA left upper extremity ([**3-6**]):
FINDINGS: The origin of the left subclavian artery is widely
patent. Best evidenced on axial 2D- FIESTA images (series 5
image 10) and confirmed with IDEAL and time-of- flight (TOF)
imaging is segmental narrowing of the proximal left subclavian
artery. The origins of the brachiocephalic artery and left
common carotic artery appear unremarkable, and the left
subclavian vein appears patent.
Note is made of atherosclerotic plaque within the aortic arch.
The superior vena cava appears widely patent. Incidental note is
made of prominent mediastinal lymph nodes (series 9 image 17).
Large bilateral pleural effusions are present.
IMPRESSIONS:
1. Findings are highly suggestive of left proximal subclavian
artery stenosis. Further evaluation with a contrast MRA could be
performed (if dialisis can be scheduled at 3 and 24 hours
following the examination) or CT angiography.
2. Large bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.
.
TTE ([**3-7**]):
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF 70%). There
is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is borderline
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Mild to moderate ([**2-4**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is a
minimally increased gradient consistent with trivial mitral
stenosis. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The supporting structures of the tricuspid
valve are thickened/fibrotic. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is at least moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade. Compared with the findings of the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2147-6-27**], the mitral and tricuspid regurgitation
are increased; there is now qat least moderate pulmonary
hypertension; and the right ventricle is now dilated and
hypocontractile.

PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY ([**3-7**]):  Compared with the prior exam,
there is no significant interval change.  Enlarged, layering
