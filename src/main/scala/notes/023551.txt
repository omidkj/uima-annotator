Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Fatigue

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
I&D of R anterior leg hematoma
Transesophageal echocardiogram

History of Present Illness:
82 year-old woman with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy
(HOCM) and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, complaining
of increasing fatigue over the last 10 days. She was noted to
have increasing pedal edema at this week's dialysis, and an
additional 3# of fluid was removed the day prior to admission.
She denies chest pain, worsening DOE, PND, or orthopnea. She
does note occasional palpitations over this interval. Per
report, she has a 90% ostial RCA blockage, and 50% OM2 blockage
on [**2136**] cath, that was not intervened on. She had a normal EF of
70% on [**3-8**] TTE, with moderate AS (peak gradient 61, mean
gradient 32, [**Location (un) 109**] 1.1-1.2cm2), 2+ MR. She had a PPM placed in the
mid-[**2125**] for HOCM, originally a Thera 7960 dual chamber PPM,
that was changed to a [**Company 1543**] SDR303 in [**8-6**]. She recently
had Imdur 30mg PO qD added to her regimen for CP control during
a recent admission for chest pain/SOB in context of two missed
HD appointments, during which she was ruled out, noted to have
no ECG changes, and did not have further CAD w/u done due to
clean coronaries on [**2137**] cath.
.
Ms. [**Known lastname 14204**] saw her cardiologist on the day of admission with
her complaints of fatigue. Per report, she appeared somewhat
lethargic and weak. Blood pressure was 86/60mmHg left arm
standing. Pulse was 110 and irregularly irregular. She was
reported to have little evidence of volume overload. ECG
demonstrated new AFib with rate 120, with evidence of LVH with
extensive ST-T changes c/w left heart strain. Her pacer was
interrogated, which indicates AF since [**4-23**] and likely chronic
since [**4-28**]. Of note, however, ECGs from [**Hospital1 498**]-[**Hospital1 107**]
demonstrated AF on [**4-10**] ECG, and not on previous [**3-18**] ECG. She
was sent to the ED for admission for TEE/CV. In the ED, she was
placed on heparin, and admitted to the cardiology service under
CCU housestaff.
.
Of note, Ms. [**Known lastname 14204**] also has been experiencing diffuse
abdominal pain over the last 2-3 months. During a recent
admission at [**Hospital1 498**]-[**Hospital1 107**], a KUB, CT and mesenteric dopplers
were unremarkable. She has never had a colonoscopy, and was
recommended to have a colonoscopy done in the near future. She
denies fever, chills, nausea, hematemesis, melena or
hematochezia. She has experienced a significant weight loss,
from 141lb to 106lb over the last year.


Past Medical History:
1) HOCM: s/p PPM placement. No ablation done, as pt
asymptomatic. On carvedilol. LVOT gradient 50mmHg at rest,
120mmHg after PVC.
2) ESRD: Unclear etiology. Apparently had ARF from acyclovir
given for Shingles, along with possible contrast nephropathy.
Has been receiving HD in [**Hospital1 1559**] through Hickman catheter for
last six months. Anuric, has atrophic kidney.
3) HTN
4) DMII (diet controlled)


Social History:
No h/o tobacco or EtOH. Lives with son and daughter-in-law.
[**Name (NI) 4906**] died last year.

Pertinent Results:
Admission CXR:
The heart size is slightly increased. There is bilateral mild to
moderate pleural effusions as well as bilateral pulmonary edema.
The right hemithorax pacemaker is inserted with the leads in
right atrium and right ventricle. Area of linear calcification
is demonstrated, the location of which could indicate mitral
ring deposits.
IMPRESSION: Pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions.
.
TEE Report:
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was monitored by a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 9833**]
throughout the procedure. The patient was sedated for the TEE.
Medications and dosages are listed above (see Test Information
section). Local anesthesia was provided by benzocaine topical
spray. No TEE related complications. 0.1 mg of IV glycopyrrolate
was given as an antisialogogue prior to TEE probe insertion. The
rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation. Echocardiographic
results were reviewed by telephone with the houseofficer caring
echocardiographic results by e-mail. Results were reviewed with
the Cardiology Fellow involved with the patient's care.
Conclusions:
The left atrium is dilated. The left atrial appendage emptying
velocity is extremely depressed (<0.1 m/s). Multiple large
definite thrombi are seen in the left atrial appendage. There is
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is unusually small. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the
aortic arch and in the descending thoracic aorta. There are
three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is at lease moderate aortic
valve stenosis, although the peak velocity across the aortic
valve could not be assessed. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderate-to-severely thickened and
myxomatous. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. Pulmonary pressures could
not be assessed. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Thrombus with associated low emptying velocities in
the left
atrial appendage.
.
CT RLE:
FINDINGS: There is a large hematoma involving the anterior and
lateral aspect of the right lower extremity. This large hematoma
appears to extend from the level of just below the knee to the
distal tibia, several centimeters above the ankle. There is no
evidence of acute fracture
IMPRESSION: Very large hematoma involving the anterior aspect of
the right lower extremity extending from below the level of the
knee towards the distal tibia. Findings were discussed with Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 636**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11309**] on [**2142-5-5**].
.
[**5-7**] TTE:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate
symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis.
No resting LVOT gradient is identified. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is at least moderate
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral leaflets and supporting structures are thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-4**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2141-12-22**],
the rhythm is now atrial fibrillation and global left
ventricular systolic function is now depressed. The aortic valve
gradient is reduced (likely related to impaired LV systolic
function).
.
Arterial Dopplers:
The exam was limited. Wound in the right calf drained large
amounts of bright red blood.
Doppler interrogation of the posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis
arteries bilaterally demonstrated monophasic waveform.
IMPRESSION: Markedly limited exam. Monophasic waveform was
demonstrated symmetrically in the bilateral tibial and dorsalis
pedis arteries. These findings could be due to arterial
insufficiency, therefore co
