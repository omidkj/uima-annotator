Chief Complaint:
chest pressure

History of Present Illness:
67 yo F with no significant cardiac hx, transferred from outside
hospital management of STEMI. Patient was in her usual state of
health until yesterday at 2pm when she noticed a feeling of food
got stuck in her midsternum area, associated with diaphoresis.
Patient also noticed chest pressure, achyness with radiation to
left arm and back, as well as shortness of breath. Her symptom
did not resolve with resting. She had one dose of 81 mg aspirin,
and went to the [**Hospital3 4107**], where EKG showed ST elevation
in II, III, aVF and V2-4 in the AM. Pt was plavix loaded and
transferred to [**Hospital1 **]. On arrival of [**Hospital1 **], only ST elevation in V2-4
seen. Cath showed LAD occlusion distal to the 1st diagnonal, and
a stent was placed. There was also a LCx lesion that was thought
to be stable, and not intervened. RCA looked clean.
.
Upon arrival to the CCU, pt had stable vital signs.
.
On ROS, pt had a mild cough for a month, which she thought was
due to allergy. Pt otherwise denied prior angina symptoms, DOE,
orthopnea, edema, palpitation, syncope or presyncope.

major issue in her healthcare. Per her daughter, she gained
30-40lbs in the past 10 years. There were no prior history of

PERTINENT STUDIES
CXR ([**2100-9-11**]): Cardiac and mediastinal contours are within
normal limits given portable technique. Lungs appear well
inflated without evidence of focal airspace consolidation,
pulmonary edema, pleural effusions or pneumothorax. No acute
bony abnormality is seen.

CARDIAC CATH ([**2100-9-11**]): Report pending...


Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR ADMISSION: 67 yo F with no significant
cardiac hx, transferred from outside hospital for management of
LAD STEMI.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# STEMI:
Pt had a late presentation (~20hr) of distal LAD disease. She
had a single (by report) DES placed to the LAD with good
restoration of flow. She also had a LCx lesion, which was felt
to be stable, and not intervened upon. She was started on ASA
325, Prasugrel, Metoprolol, Atorvastatin and Lisinopril. Cath
showed apical akinesis and she was started on coumadin and
heparin. She did not have further chest pressure during her
hospital stay and was stable on medical regimen although her BP
was somewhat low in the 90's-100's. Plan is for a follow up appt
with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who performed her stent procedure to
reassess her LCX lesion and assess her symptoms. It is
preferable for the LCX intervention to be performed after
myocardial recovery but may be necessary emergently if patient
has recurrent chest pain. She was discharged on nitroglycerin
sublingually with instructions to use for chest pressure but to
also contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Coumadin was started at 3mg daily and
INR will be checked on [**2100-9-16**] with INR management to be done by
Dr.[**Name (NI) 60978**] office.
.
# Acute Systolic Dysfunction:
EF 35% on ECHO. No symptoms of fluid overload during hospital
stay and no diuretics were prescribed at discharge. She was
instructed to weigh herself daily and take all of her medicines.
A Low Na diet was also counseled.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
# DEPRESSION
Her ritalin was held [**3-17**] recent MI. She also has a prescription
for Celexa and Klonapin that she had self d/c'ed. She was
encouraged to take Klonapin as needed at home for anxiety and to
talk to Dr [**First Name (STitle) 1356**] about treatment of her depression as a MI
increases her risk of a depressive episode.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- INR, CHEM-7 and CBC on [**2100-9-16**] with results to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1356**]
- F/U appt with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to re-evaluate LCX lesion and need for
PCI
