Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
Transferred from [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital for Respiratory Failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central Venous Line
Bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
This is an 84 yof with hx of CAD s/p MI, HTN, Hyperlipdemia,
PVD, PE s/p IVC filter placement, Coomb's positive hemolytic
anemia, possible CHF who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
respiratory failure.  Per report, Ms. [**Known lastname 7111**] developed SOB at
[**Hospital **] rehab and was taken to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital.  At the
OSH, she was intubated for worsening respiratory distress.  She
was treated with Lasix, nitro paste, solumedrol.  ?Abx written
on transfer which include Vancomycin 1gm daily, Cipro 500mg
daily and Primaxin (imipenim and cilastatin) 250mg q6h.

In the ED:  Temp 98.8, HR 84, BP 123/56, RR 14, 100% on
mechanical Ventilation.  Patient became hypotensive with
initiation of Fentanyl Versed with SBP 70s.  Per report, she was
given 2L IVF boluses with minimal response.  PICC was placed and
patient was started on Levophed with good response.  She was
sent for CTA chest which was negative for PE but was concerning
for bilateral PNA and possible RLL cavitation.  Pt was then
started on Vanco/Levo/Ceftaz.  She was transferred to MICU for
further care.

On transfer, patient was intubated and sedated.  Unable to
obtain history.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2185-7-14**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. The patient is mechanically
ventilated. The IVC is small, consistent with an RA pressure of
<10mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 50
%). The estimated cardiac index is normal(>=2.5L/min/m2).
Diastolic function could not be assessed. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The number of
aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. IMPRESSION: Suboptimal
image quality. The left ventricle appears to be small, mildly
hypertrophied, and has mildly depressed overall systolic
function. Diastolic function is unable to be assessed, but
mostly likely diastolic dysfunction is present.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY Study Date of [**2185-7-13**]
3:10 AM:
CTA CHEST: There is no evidence of pulmonary embolus. Heart size
is mildly
enlarged with moderate coronary artery atherosclerosis, most
severe in the
left anterior descending artery. The endotracheal tube
terminates at the
level of the carina. There is extensive bilateral consolidation
and
bronchoalveolar opacity with air bronchograms that mostly spares
the
periphery, with left lower lobe collpase noted. A 3 cm well
circumscribed
focus containing air (3:60) in the right upper lobe likley
represents a
bullae. Although this exam was not optimized for
subdiaphragmatic diagnosis, diffuse ascites is noted.
IMPRESSION: 1. No PE. 2. Diffuse bilateral airspace opacity
likely represents infection, although
CHF is a possiblity. 3. Endotracheal tube terminates at the
level of the carina and can be withdrawn several centemeters.

UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US RIGHT PORT Study Date of [**2185-7-16**] 4:53
PM:
FINDINGS: Grayscale and color Doppler images of right and left
subclavian,
axillary, brachial, basilic and cephalic veins and right
internal jugular vein were obtained. The images of the left
internal jugular vein were not obtained due to patient
positioning and overlying dressing. There is an occlusive
thrombus in the right axillary vein, which does not compress and
does not demonstrate color flow. The remainder of the vessels
are patent, and demonstrate normal flow and compressibility.
There may be a collateral vessel adjacent to the thrombosed
right axillary vein. IMPRESSION: Occlusive right axillary vein
thrombus, with reconstitution of flow in the subclavian. Left
internal jugular vein not imaged.
