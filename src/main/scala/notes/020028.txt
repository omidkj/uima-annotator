Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal distention, change in mental status, and fatigue.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Colonoscopy.

History of Present Illness:
88F with dementia, brittle DMII, afib on coumadin transferred
from nursing home due to altered mental status. She was noted to
be lethargic and was hypoglycemic. On transfer, she was
bradycardic to the 30s initially, when nauseas with emesis. She
was also hypertensive with BP-210/180. KUB showed dilated loops
of large bowel, maximal size about 13cm.

Ms [**Known lastname 1833**] has chronically dilated loops of large bowel dating
back to [**2101**] KUB. She has typically had bowel movements in this
setting and dedicated work-up has been deferred. The typical
size
of her large bowel dilation has been about 13cm. The patient is
a
vague historian but adamantly denies pain. She had a regular
bowel movement yesterday. Today, upon arriving at the hospital,
she has been nauseas with episodes of emesis. She tells me her
abdominal distention is similar to baseline.

ECG Study Date of [**2103-5-15**]  1:53:46 PM
Probable sinus rhythm with A-V conduction delay, left atrial
abnormality and atrial premature beats but low amplitude atrial
wave forms make assessment difficult. The QTc interval may be
prolonged but it is difficult to measure. Diffuse ST-T wave
abnormalities. Prominent U waves. Findings raise consideration
of possible drug/electrolyte/metabolic effect. Clinical
correlation is suggested. Since the previous tracing of [**2102-3-11**]
further ST-T wave changes are present and the U waves appear
more prominent.

ECG Study Date of [**2103-5-15**]  1:59:52 PM
Probable sinus rhythm with A-V conduction delay and marked left
atrial
abnormality but low amplitude atrial wave forms make assessment
difficult. The QTc interval may be prolonged but it is difficult
to measure. Diffuse
ST-T wave abnormalities. Prominent U waves. Findings raise
consideration
of possible drug/electrolyte/metabolic effect. Clinical
correlation is
suggested. Since the previous tracing of the same date no
significant change.

ECG Study Date of [**2103-5-15**]  2:03:00 PM
Probable sinus rhythm with A-V conduction delay and left atrial
abnormality but low amplitude atrial wave forms make assessment
difficult. The QTc interval may be prolonged but it is difficult
to measure. Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities. Right precordial
lead U waves appear prominent but are difficult to assess.
Findings raise consideration of possible
drug/electrolyte/metabolic effect. Clinical correlation is
suggested.
Since the previous tracing of the same date probably no
significant change.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2103-5-15**] 2:18 PM
Single supine and semi-erect portable view of the chest was
obtained. There has been interval placement of a nasogastric
tube, coursing below the diaphragm with tip in the expected
location of the stomach. The patient is rotated to the right.
There is increased opacification at the right lung base.
Bibasilar opacities are seen, new since the prior study, which
may be due to infection and/or aspiration. Trace blunting of the
right costophrenic angle is seen and a trace effusion is not
excluded. The aorta remains calcified and tortuous. The cardiac
silhouette is stable. Multiple featureless dilated loops of
bowel are partially imaged in the upper abdomen.

PORTABLE ABDOMEN Study Date of [**2103-5-15**] 2:19 PM
Patient has chronically gaseous dilated loops of bowel measuring

up to 13 cm. However, loops of bowel appear more featureless and
with overall increased distention as compared to the prior
study. While findings most likely relate to [**Last Name (un) **] syndrome,
sigmoid volvulus cannot be entirely excluded in the appropriate
clinical setting. Rectal gas not clearly identified. As
clinically indicated, findings could be further evaluated for on
abdominal CT.

PORTABLE ABDOMEN Study Date of [**2103-5-15**] 10:39 PM
1. Interval decrease in the degree of gaseous distention of the
large bowel with persistent 8 cm distention of the cecum.
2. Nasogastric tube is located with side port at the level of
the GE
junction, could be slightly advanced if tolerated.

PORTABLE ABDOMEN Study Date of [**2103-5-16**] 10:33 AM
Minimal interval increase in the degree of cecal dilatation

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2103-5-17**] 4:16 AM
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the size of
the cardiac
silho
