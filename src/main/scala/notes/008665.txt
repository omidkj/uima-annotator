History of Present Illness:
This is an 84 year-old woman with a history of chf and afib
transferred from [**Hospital6 **] after being found
unresponsive with acute desaturation this afternoon.  She was
originally admitted to the hospital on the previous morning
after she awoke at 0300 short of breath.  She self-administered
an albuterol treatment without relief and then called Lifeline.
Her daughters report a 10-day history of cough and worsening
shortness of breath prior to the hospitalization.  Her cough was
productive with yellow sputum and accompanied by decreased SpO2
in the low 90's on RA.  She completed a 5-day course of
Levofloxacin prescribed by her PCP prior to admission.  Her
daughters deny any fevers, CP, N/V, or palpitations.  Upon
admission she was treated for a CAP and received a dose of IV
levofloxacin which gave her a rash, and then subsequently was
changed to antibiotic coverage with IV azithromycin.

On the day of transfer around 3PM she became unresponsive and
had an acute desaturation to 84% on a few liters.  She was
subsequently intubated and noted to have ST depressions on her
EKG and her trop bumped from 0.8 to 25 and CK MB was found to be
124.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

In our emergency room, cxray confirmed et tube placement, head
CT demonstrated only old infarcts, no new cns event.

On arrival to floor, intubated, sedated, no history obtainable
from patient, spiked fever.

Cardiac catheterization:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
did not
reveal any obstructive coronary artery disease.  The left main
coronary
artery was without angiographic evidence of obstructive coronary
artery
disease.  The left anterior descending artery was without
angiographic
evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease.  The LAD was a
tortuous
vessel consistent with the patient's history of hypertension.
The left
circumflex coronary artery was without angiographic evidence of
obstructive coronary artery disease.  The right coronary artery
was the
dominant vessel and was without angiographic evidence of
obstructive
coronary artery disease.
2. Left heart catheterization revealed elevated left ventricular
filling
pressure, (LVEDP = 21 mmhg). There was evidence of moderate
aortic
stenosis.  Mean aortic valve gradient was 20 mmhg, calculated
aortic
valve area = 1.0 cm2.
3. Right heart catheterization revealed moderate to severe
pulmonary
hypertension (60/20mm hg).  The cardiac output and cardiac index
were
normal.
4. Left ventriculography revealed mildly depressed left
ventricular
systolic function.  Contrast calculated LVEF = 50%.  There was
apical
akinesis.  There was no evidence of mitral regurgitation.
5. A 6 French angioseal closure device was used on the right
femoral
arteriotomy site.
.
Echocardiogram: The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium
is moderately dilated. The inferior vena cava is dilated (>2.5
cm). There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly to moderately depressed
with inferior and infero-lateral hypokinesis. Tissue velocity
imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is mild global
right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is
moderately dilated. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is at
least moderate aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The
mitral valve shows characteristic rheumatic deformity. Mild to
moderate ([**2-8**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The pulmonic
valve leaflets are thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.



Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 84 year-old woman with a history of afib and chf
transferred to [**Hospital1 **] from [**Hospital3 4298**] after admission there
for cough, respiratory complaints on [**8-8**] night who developed
altered mental status and suffered NSTEMI requiring intubation
on [**8-9**], was extubated on [**8-10**] and underwent cath on [**8-11**].

1)CV:
a)Perfusion: NSTEMI: In setting of likely CHF and possible
pneumonia, ST depressions noted and CK at OSH in 500's with MB
125, trop I 0.8-->25 earlier [**8-9**].  Known history of CHF and
Afib, unsure of EF in past.  As per docs at [**Hospital3 4298**]
was having chest pain. No obstruction found on cath. No PCI
performed. She was continued on ASA 81 mg PO qd. Her warfarin
was restarted for her atrial fibrillation and heparin was d/c'ed
after her catheterization revealed no occlusions. It was noted
that after she received her metoprolol, she became hypotensive
and bradycardic, so this medication was discontinued. We
continued her enalapril and checked her lipid profile. Lipids
normal. Does not need statins.

b)Pump: Pt had known cardiomyopathy per outside records. Cath
revealed diastolic dysfunction and Echo revealed mildly
depressed LVEF. She was started on her home dose of furosemide
(40 mg PO qd) prior to discharge. We had difficulty weaning her
off of O2, and this was thought to be secondary to a pulmonary
issue. She reported that during one of her prior
hospitalizations this was the case as well. Was told to follow
up with her PCP regarding any pulmonary issues.

c)rhythm: Afib: warfarin was stopped on admission, and the pt
was anticoagulated with heparin IV. Once cath revealed no
obstructive coronary dz, the heparin was d/c'ed and the pt's
outpt regimen of warfarin was restarted. On the day of
discharge, her INR was 2.1, and this should be followed closely.
We also continued her on her dose of digoxin.

2)Respiratory: was intubated on admission. Extubated [**8-11**]. h/o
cough with yellow sputum production. CXR not c/w PNA. However,
CXR shows ill-defined nodular opacity on rt side. ?probabl
