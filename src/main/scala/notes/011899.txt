Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 17865**]
Chief Complaint:
Gastrointestinal bleed, hypotension.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Coil embolization of left gastric artery
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy x2
Central venous line placement to right internal jugular vein
Temporary dialysis catheter placement to left femoral vein
Radial arterial line placement

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 48 yo man h/o recent admission for pneumonia,
septic shock, and bacteremia, also with history of hypertension,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and s/p bowel resection
and anastamosis due to "kinking" 1.5 years ago, who presents
from OSH with gastrointestinal bleed, intubated and on two
pressors.

Per OSH report, patient presented yesterday morning to ED at OSH
after 4 dark bowel movements. His SBP was noted to be 80 with
hct of 21.9 (down from 32.2 just one day prior to that at time
of discharge from [**Hospital1 18**]). White count was 48 (increased from
13). Patient was fluid resuscitated and transfused with two unit
PRBCs. Yesterday afternoon, patient was noted to have increasing
abdominal pain. KUB was negative for free air, per report.
Follow-up CT showed possible SBO. SBP dropped to 40s and code
blue was called. Patient was intubated and transfused an
additional 5u PRBCs, for a total of 7u at time of transfer. In
addition he was given 4u FFP for worsening coagulopathy, felt to
be secondary to DIC. CVL was placed and patient was started on
norepinephrine and vasopressin. NGT per report was suctioning
bloody fluid. In addition patient was noted to have melanotic
stools in the setting of becoming increasingly coagulopathic
with most recent INR 3.3 and PTT 78. His vitals at time of
[**Location (un) **] transfer are BP 119/87, HR 117, sat 100% on FiO2 50%.
Most recent ABG was 7.3/38/138. Meds at time of transfer are IV
Flagyl and PO vanco (for presumptive C dif), IV [**Name (NI) **] (unclear
why), and IV vancomycin (for bacteremia from previous
admission).

Of note, patient was recently admitted for hypoxic respiratory
failure, ARDS and septic shock. He was intubated prior to
transfer here, transiently on pressors, and extubated on the
fourth hospital day. He was treated with broad spectrum
antibiotics for sepsis from a presumed pulmonary source
(vancomycin/levofloxacin/Zosyn); in the end he completed a 7-day
course of [**Name (NI) **]/Zosyn and was discharged to complete a 14-day
course of vancomycin for GPC bacteremia (peptostreptococcus on
blood culture from [**4-24**] with negative surveillance cultures). For
what was felt to be a COPD flair during that admission, he had
been discharged to complete a 14-day course of prednisone. Other
issues during that admission included acute renal failure (felt
to be secondary to shock ATN versus prerenal) that resolved at
discharge, transaminitis (felt to be secondary to shock liver),
thromboctyopenia (uptrending at time of discharge). His
hematocrit at time of discharge was 32, with white count of 13.

Studies/Reports:

Liver ultrasound with duplex ([**2157-5-6**]):CONCLUSION: This is a
limited study with heterogeneous hyperechoic liver and no
definite focal lesions seen, but views are technically
challenging in this patient. Portal vein is fully patent with
forward flow. Minimal perihepatic ascites is noted.

Brief Hospital Course:
A 48 y/o man with history of COPD and hypertension and recent
admission for pneumonia and bacteremia presents with severe GIB
and possible SBO, currently on pressors and intubated.

# Hypotension and gastrointestinal bleed. Patient was bleeding
from NGT, bright-red blood, at time of transfer. Additionally,
his platelets were falling and INR/PTT were rising. He was
transfused aggressively with blood products to maintain hct
greater than 25, platelets greater than 50, INR greater than 2,
and fibrinogen greater than 200. On the first hospital day, GI
performed upper endoscopy x2 but unfortunately could not
localize a bleeding source due to poor visualization of the
gastric and small bowel mucosa, secondary to the abundance of
blood. There were no esophageal varices. On the night of the
first hospital day, patient went to interventional radiology
where angiography revealed bleeding source in the left gastric
artery. The bleeding was stopped with coil embolization. After
this procedure, his hematocrit stabilized somewhat, although he
was still requiring (less frequent) blood transfusions.
Furthermore, his lactic acidosis continued to worsen. Throughout
all of this, he was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for
GI flora, proton-pump inhibitor drip, stress-dose steroids, and
norepinephrine titrated to maintain MAP >65.

# Lactic acidosis. His lactic acidosis improved initially,
particularly after the IR-guided coil embolization. However, on
the second to third hospital day, the lactic acidosis worsened.
Patient was started on CVVHD when serial ABGs revealed worsening
acidemia. There was no clear cause for his worsening acidemia.
It was felt that the combination of findings may have been due
to propofol infusion syndrome, especially in light of the
worsening hypertriglyceridemia.

# Respiratory failure. Patient was intubated for airway
protection in the setting of code blue for worsening
hypotension. Ventilation settings were increased in an effort to
compensate for the worsening metabolic acidosis, but ultimately
he required CVVHD.

# Coagulopathy. His coagulopathy was felt to be secondary to
DIC. This improved initially but at time of death was worsening.

# Transaminitis. Initially this was felt to be secondary to
shock liver from hypotension during the code blue arrest at OSH.
His liver enzymes improved and then worsened on the second and
third hospital day. Liver was consulted and recommended for
right upper quadrant ultrasound; this showed no evidence of
portal venous clot. His liver function continued to worsen up
until time of death.

# Acute kidney injury and hypona
