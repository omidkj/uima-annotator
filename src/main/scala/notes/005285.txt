Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right heart catheterization


History of Present Illness:
54 M with long history of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy,
A-fib on coumadin, s/p AVJ ablation, s/p pacemaker, s/p ICD, who
presented to OSH with weakness and dizziness. He was recently
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for V fib storm with multiple shocks. On
this admission, his rhythm was stable and he was agressively
diuresed with lasix gtt and metolazone for CHF exacerbation.  He
was discharged on [**9-2**].
.
Per the patient, he was home for 2 days before being readmitted
to [**Hospital 4199**] hospital presenting with dizziness and concern for
syncope.  Patient was noted to have hypotension, worsening
anemia, and worsening renal failure (baseline Cr 2.1. Cr 3.0 on
admission, up to 4.1 during stay).  His systolic BPs ranged from
70-80s. Diuretics were discontinued and he was treated with
normal saline.  BP came up to 100 by continued to  have
considerable heart failure.  One set of cardiac enzymes showed
troponin of 0.14, but no further sets were obtained.
.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for milrinone infusion and further
CHF managment.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient currently denies any pain or
discomfort. He is not currently short of breath, but mentions
that he has not been able to lie flat for several weeks. He has
not had PND for 2 weeks. He usually has some mild LE edema.
Patient does not usually feel short of breath at rest, only with
minimal exertion. He denies any chest pain.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
palpitations.


Past Medical History:
1. Mixed etiology cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of 20%
by echo in [**2095**].
2. Ventricular tachycardia.
3. Atrial tachycaria status post ablation.
4. Chronic atrial fibrillation status post AVJ ablation for rate

control and resultant dual chamber pacemaker/ICD placement (ICD
implanted in [**2093**] due to recurrent unexplained syncope in
patient with depressed EF).
5. gout
6. right exotropia due to childhood trauma
7. varicose veins
8. Bipolar disorder with recent hospitalization at [**Hospital 48919**]
[**Hospital 107**] Hospital
9. Hepatitis C

Social History:
Patient recently left an [**Hospital3 **] facility and returned
to his prior rooming house in [**Location (un) 2251**].  He has been unable to
adequately care for himself and has since decompensated. Per his
sister, he is unable to reliably take his medicnes or prepare
simple food at home.  Smokes 1ppd. Denies alcohol or illicit
durg use.  Formerly heavy EtOH.

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
[**2100-8-30**]
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
10-20mmHg. There is asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There is severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF <20 %). The basal
inferolateral wall contracts best. No masses or thrombi are seen
in the left ventricle. The right ventricular cavity is markedly
dilated with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. There is
abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular volume overload. The diameters of aorta at the
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The leaflets fail
to fully coapt. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation
is seen. There is at atleast mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2096-1-10**], the left ventricular cavity is now
larger and the severity of mitral regurgitation is now
increased. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation and
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension are now identified.

ETT:
pMIBI [**8-30**]

1. Probable mild decrease in activity in the inferior wall in
the setting of soft tissue attenuation.

2. Very large left ventricle.
.
[**9-7**] CXR:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**8-26**], there is again
huge
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette in a patient with a
dual-channel
pacemaker device in place. Persistent opacification at the left
base with
loss of the hemidiaphragmatic contour, consistent with pleural
fluid and
atelectasis or possibly some supervening pneumonia. Relatively
minimal
vascular prominence suggests that the huge cardiac silhouette
could reflect cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion.
.
OSH Abdominal US [**9-6**]
Moderate ascites, unchanged or slightly increased since [**8-22**]
.
OSH KUB [**9-5**]
Paucity of gas raising the possibility of proximal small bowel
obstruction
.
OSH CXR [**9-5**]
Cardiomegaly, kidney dual-lead pacemaker. No pleural effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
Summary:
54 M with long history of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, EF
<20%, A-fib on coumadin, s/p AVJ ablation, severe TR, s/p
pacemaker, s/p ICD, who was transferred from OSH for CHF
management. Recently admitted for recurrent VT/VF in setting of
decompensated heart failure (d/c [**9-2**]), who was readmitted [**9-8**]
in volume overload and with ARF. Recent echo showed EF <20%,
global severe HK, severe TR, and marked biventricular dilation.
Discharged for 2d to rehab, but signed out AMA to his rooming
home, where he was unable to care for himself. On admit he was
found to be volume overloaded, with increased Cr and
hypotension. He went to cath lab [**9-8**] that showed elevated
filling pressure with pulmonary hypertension. He
