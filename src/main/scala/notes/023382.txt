Chief Complaint:
Chest pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with Aortic stenting


History of Present Illness:
84 yo F with HTN, CAD s/p MI x 2 and multiple PCIs (PTCA ramus
[**2136**], RCA [**2141**], Cypher prox LCx [**2148**] c/b large RP bleed
requiring evacuation), CHF (EF 55-60% [**2148**]), PAF, COPD admitted
to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2150-5-31**] with CP & exacerbation of COPD.
At home developed acute onset SSCP without radiation associated
with SOB. No nausea, vomiting or diaphoresis. Pain resolved
after EMS arrived and given nitro, ASA.
.
At OSH, troponin was 0.05 -> 0.92 -> 0.94 (peak). Original BNP
[**2061**] but no evidence of CHF on CXR. Pt was having arrhythmia,
?PAF & NSVT however on am of transfer with symptomatic 12 beat
VT, pt had dizziness & palpiations. Later during
hospitalization, pt with R shoulder pain that slowly moved
substernal, and EKG showed new deep ST depressions in V2-6.
Relief of pain with sl nitro & morphine. Given beta-blocker,
20mg IV lasix, IV heparin gtt, azithro, IV solumedrol.
Transferred for cath.
.
At cath (no official report yet available), right dominant with
moderate distal RCA disease, large ramus without obstruction,
patent LCx stent, ?D1 obstruction. Distal aorta noted to be
stenotic and stent placed, but then noticed extravasation of
contrast -> ? dissection, but stat CT abdomen without contrast
extravasation. Admitted to CCU for close monitoring.

MEDICAL DECISION MAKING
EKG demonstrated sinus @ 65bpm, LVH, deep TWI V2-V6 new compared
to [**2150-5-26**].
.
TELEMETRY demonstrated:***
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**11/2148**] demonstrated:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No mass/thrombus is seen
in the left atrium or left atrial appendage. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed. The calculated myocardial
performance index was 0.35 (MPI A = 4460. ms; MPI B = 331 ms).
Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent
with Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction. Resting
regional wall motion abnormalities include mild inferior wall
hyppokinesia.. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There is no mass/thrombus in the right
ventricle. The aortic root is moderately dilated. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in
the ascending aorta. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. Moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
small to moderate sized pericardial effusion. The effusion
appears loculated.

COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system

revealed a single vessel CAD. The LMCA was patent. The LAD had
mild
non-obstrcutive disease. The LCx had an 80% proximal stenosis.
The RCA had a 30% proximal and a 50% distal stenoses.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed a normal left sided filling
pressure. There was a moderate systemic arterial hypertension
with SBP of 160 mm Hg.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
4. There was difficulty with right femoral access. Having
obtained a femoral access on the left, an abdomianl aortography
revealed an
occluded right external iliac artery and a 60% stenosis at the
origin of the right common iliac artery. Left iliac artery was
patent. There was a diffuse aortic atherosclerosis with a 70%
distal stenosis, an infrarenal aneurism and a 20 mm Hg gradient.

5. The lesion in the proximal LCX was predilated with a 2.0 mm
balloon and stented with a 2.5 mm Cypher stent with lesion
reduction to 80%. The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with
no residual stenosis, no dissection and no embolisation. (see
PTCA comments)
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery dise
