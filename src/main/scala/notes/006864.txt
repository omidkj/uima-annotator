Service:  Cardiac Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 69-year-old gentleman
who has a history of having an aortic valve replacement in
[**2109**] who now presented to his primary care physician with
dyspnea on exertion and a positive exercise treadmill test.

The patient had an echocardiogram in [**2124-10-9**] which
showed an ejection fraction of 55%, left ventricular
hypertrophy, a well-seeded St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] aortic valve, and severe
mitral stenosis.

The patient was referred to [**Hospital1 188**] for cardiac catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Hyperlipidemia.
3.  Status post aortic valve replacement with a St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**]
aortic valve in [**2109**].
4.  Status post hernia repair.

ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Lescol 80 mg by mouth once per day.
2.  Mavik 4 mg by mouth twice per day.
3.  Furosemide 40 mg by mouth once per day.
4.  IC-Klor 10 mEq by mouth every day.
5.  Coumadin once per day.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Significant for symptoms of claudication
after walking a short distance.  The patient denies current
tobacco use.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted
to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**4-9**] and
underwent a cardiac catheterization.  Catheterization showed
pulmonary artery pressures of 68/35, 50% left main lesion,
90% proximal left anterior descending artery lesion, and 80%
second obtuse marginal lesion.

On the morning on hospital day three, the patient developed a
moderate sized bleed from his right groin femoral cardiac
catheterization site.  The patient required a long period of
pressure to stop the bleeding.  This incident was complicated
by a vagal episode associated with hypotension and
bradycardia which resolved with atropine.

The patient underwent imaging of his carotids which showed a
60% to 69% right internal carotid artery stenosis and a 40%
to 59% left internal carotid artery stenosis.  The right
vertebral artery was not visualized, and the left vertebral
artery had antegrade flow.

On the evening on hospital day four, the patient developed
another bleed from his right groin catheterization site.
Manual pressure was applied, and hemostasis was achieved.
The heparin infusion was discontinued at that time.

On [**4-13**], the patient was taken to the operating room with
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**] for an off-pump coronary artery bypass
graft with left internal mammary artery to the left anterior
descending artery.  The decision had been made prior to
surgery to have the patient evaluated by Cardiology for
potential mitral valvuloplasty as the patient was felt to be
a good candidate for this.

The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit
postoperatively in stable condition.  The patient was weaned
and extubated from mechanical ventilation on his first
postoperative day.  He had good hemodynamics postoperatively.

On postoperative day one, the patient had an episode of
hypertension and shortness of breath.  A chest x-ray was
obtained which showed congestive heart failure.  The patient
was treated with intravenous Lasix which resulted in good
diuresis.  The patient continued to have good hemodynamics
with an adequate cardiac output.

On postoperative day two, the patient's pulmonary catheter
was removed.  The patient was started on Lopressor which he
tolerated well.  The patient continued to receive Lasix for
diuresis.

On postoperative day three, the patient developed atrial
fibrillation which was treated with intravenous Lopressor,
and he subsequently converted into a sinus rhythm.  The
patient's heparin drip was restarted for his mechanical
aortic valve, and the patient was transferred from the
Intensive Care Unit to the regular part of the hospital.

The patient was seen by Physical Therapy upon arriving to the
floor.  At that time, he was able to ambulate 500 feet
without difficulty.

In the evening on postoperative day three, the patient again
developed atrial fibrillation.  The patient was started on
amiodarone.  The patient converted to a sinus rhythm, but the
patient continued to have episodes of intermittent atrial
fibrillation, decreasing frequency as the patient's beta
blocker was increased.  The patient was continued on a
heparin drip.

On postoperative day six, after further evaluation by the
Interventional Cardiology team, it was determined by
evaluating the patient's echocardiogram that in addition to
the patient's mitral stenosis he also had an element of
mitral regurgitation, and that combined with other data it
was decided the patient was not a good candidate for a
balloon valvuloplasty.  It was determined by the health care
team that the patient's mitral stenosis and mitral
regurgitation would be managed medically as he was also not
an optimal candidate for surgical mitral valve replacement.
Therefore, the patient was restarted on his Coumadin, and
plans were made to discharge to home as soon as his INR was
therapeutic.

Due to the significant number of episodes of atrial
fibrillation and atrial tachycardia, a Cardiology
consultation was obtained for management of the atrial
dysrhythmias.  It was recommended the patient be on no
amiodarone and simply increasing his Lopressor which was done
with good resolution of the dysrhythmias.  The patient
continued to receive Coumadin and remained in the hospital on
a heparin drip awaiting his INR to become therapeutic.

The patient was cleared by Physical Therapy.  By
postoperative day thirteen, the patient's INR had reached 2,
and the patient was cleared for discharge to home.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Temperature 98, his pulse was 68 (in
sinus rhythm), his blood pressure was 108/60, his respiratory
rate was 16, and oxygen saturation was 98% on room air.
Laboratory data revealed white blood cell count was 9.5, his
hematocrit was 31.4, and his platelet count was 504.  Sodium
was 139, potassium was 4.6, chloride was 101, bicarbonate was
29, blood urea nitrogen was 33, creatinine was 1.2, and blood
glucose was 96.  The patient's prothrombin time was 17.2 and
INR was 2.  The patient was alert, awake, and oriented times
three.  Heart regular in rate and rhythm with a sharp valve
click.  No murmurs.  Breath sounds were clear bilaterally.
No wheezes, rhonchi, or rales.  The abdomen was soft,
