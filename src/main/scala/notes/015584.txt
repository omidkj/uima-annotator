Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:81y/o F with COPD- chronically vent dependant, HTN, p/w
altered mental status and difusse body twitching.

1. Altered mental status:
Was likely multifactorial given that she had a pneumonia, was
extremely anemic and was on multiple medications that could
cause confusion. We started treatment with broad spectrum
antibiotics and on day 2 of admission was narrowed down to
Levofloxacin 250mg. On day two of admission, patient was given
her morning medications which included neurontin, celexa and
clonidine. Within 40min she became lethargic and very difficult
to arouse. She had been on trach collar at the time and was
immediately placed back on mechanical ventilation given the
thinking that she may have become hypercarbic. Oxygenation was
100% the entire time. Team tried to gas patient but refused and
would not allow any blood draws. Nurse then brought the
medications to our attention and medications were discontinued.
Her mentation improved and maintained itself throughout the day.
She was also transfused one unit of packed red blood cells. The
infection, anemia and medications all contributed to her change
in mental status but the medication seemed to be the likely
culprit. Her Lfts were normal, her ecg did not have any evidence
of MI, enzymes were flat, ua was normal, not uremic, her gas was
not far from her baseline, glucose normal as well as ca/mg/phos,
no evidence of seizure. The celexa, neurontin and clonidine
should not be restarted.
.
2. Myoclonus: iron defficiency vs. hypercarbia vs. medications.
Patient was transfused with one unit of red cells, medications
were stopped as above and the infection is being treated.
Unclear as to which intervention stopped the myoclonus but it
has gone.
.
3. COPD/asthma: c/w fluticasone and combivent.
.
4. HTN: Norvasc and clonidine were stopped. HCTZ was restarted
on discharge. Patient normotensive, norvasc not restarted.
.
5. Anemia:
-has chronic anemia, on aranesp. Patient transfused two unit of
packed red blood cells. Hct stable.
.
6. Acute renal insufficiency:
-NS fluid hydration was given, Urine lytes showed FeUrea: >50%.
Cr was stable x3, ? whether she had medication induced ATN or
whether this is chronic renal insufficiency. UOP was normal.
.
7. Thrombocytopenia:
-platelets stable. Chronic thrombocytopenia. Follow up with pcp
for further work up.
.
8. Left lower ext edema: U/S was performed, no evidence of dvt.
.
9. FEN: sp/sw recommended soft diet with thin liquids,
medications in apple sauce
.
10. Full Code per family.
