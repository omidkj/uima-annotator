Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Renal failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
central line placement
respiratory mechanical ventilation
IV pressors
thoracentesis of pleural effusion

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with exquisitely complex medical history,
transferred from [**Hospital **] rehab for evaluation of renal failure
and consideration for dialysis.
.
Of note, pateint was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] in [**12-5**]
after a very complicated MICU stay. She was initially admitted
for respiratory distress likely from decompensated CHF and ?MRSA
pneumonia. SHe was treated with vancomycin for pneumonia. She
was also diurese and had afterload reduction. She also had
multiple thoracentesis with transudative effusion and rapid
reaccumulation. She was eventually intubated and trach on
[**2161-12-30**]. Weaning has been mainly unsuccessful.
.
Patient was transferred to rehab on pressure support but was
switched to AC becuase of intolerance. Weaning attempts were
unsuccessful.
She actually was admitted to ICU at [**Hospital1 **] becuase of
arrhythmia. Her SVT was controlled with increasing doses of
metoprolol and digoxin but she became bradycardic. Patient went
into monomorphic VTs that resolved spontaneouly. Patient was
given amiodarone 150mg IV 2 weeks ago. Serial CKs and troponin
were negative
Her course was also complicated by hemoptysis and [**Hospital1 4532**],
aspirin and coumadin has been d/c'd.Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1726**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 47786**] her
and did not find source of bleeding.
Patient was also started on imipenem for presumed ventilator
associated pneumonia([**1-25**]- [**2162-2-4**]). SHe was also on Bactrim for
anterobacter on her sputum.
Her BUn and creatinine begin to climb around [**2-17**] t0 1.9 and 3.3
on day of admission. Renal consult suggested dialsysis. Family
meeting was held with son on [**2-19**] who insisted everything to b
done

Physical Exam:
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Gen- frail looking elderly female lying in bed, only responsive
to noxious stimuli
HEENT- anicteric, flushed and swollen looking face, oral mucosa
dry, neck supple, trach site looks clean
CV- 2/6 SEM at apex, irregular heart sound

tenderness

skin- multiple bruises and also excoriation from anasarca, clean
ulcer noted on left foot.

echocardiogram, and lab results.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with extensive cardiac history, AF, sick
sinus syndrome, presents with acute renal failure to be
considered for dialysis.
.
# Code Status / Overall Goals of Care: Patient was initially
"Full code," confirmed with son. Over the course of her
hospitalization, the patient's very grave prognosis and very
limited potential quality of life (even if all acute issues were
effectively treated) led to frequent discussions between the ICU
team and the patient's family (son). Given the patient's
deteriorating status and grave prognosis, the patient's code
status was changed to DNR/I, CPR not indicated. The patient's
son and ICU team decided to discontinue Levophed on [**3-12**] and
the patient passed away within 1-2 hours.
.
# ID: The patient's clinical picture at admission very
consistent with sepsis (including WBC 16 with 39% bands) and pt
was started empirically on vancomycin and meropenem and given
aggressive IVF resuscitation.  Two out of two blood Cx bottles
drawn on day of admission grew ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE, sensitive
to meropenem, which pt was continued on for the remainder of her
hospital stay. Patient was apparently on Flagyl 250 Q6
prophylactically at rehab facility, although C diff was negative
on [**2162-2-1**]. Flagyl was not continued in the hospital. Stool
studies were negative for C.diff here as well. Thoracentesis was
performed and revealed a transudative process. [**Last Name (un) **] stim test
was WNL.
.
# Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine was increased at admission but
urine output was initially WNL. Pt's renal function continued to
deteriorate and she became anuric. Work-up was entirely
negative, including abdominal ultrasound (no hydronephrosis
seen), urine eosinophils negative. Pt had history of renal
artery stenosis (angiography showed high grade stenosis of the
left renal artery but with normal perfusion and moderate
stenosis of the right renal artery which previously had been
demonstrated to be atrophic with flow studies indicative of
significant stenosis too diffuse to intervene). Renal followed
the patient throughout her hospitalization. The possibility of
initiating dialysis was discussed at length with the patient's
family (son) and the renal team and in view of the patient's
grave overall prognosis and very limited potential quality of
life even with dialysis, the decision was made not to pursue
dialysis.
.
# Hypotension: was likely from sepsis. Pt required levophed for
BP support despite aggressive IVF.
.
# CAD: Patient had a trop of 0.21, MB 22. ECG revealed Afib,
nonspecific St-T changes, poor RWP(not new); likely demand
ischemia. Patient was maintained on aspirin and lipitor. Cardiac
enzymes
- cycle cardiac enzymes
- cardiology consult
- bare metal stent placement in [**Month (only) **] to OM #1, doubt it is in
stent thrombosis, no acute EKG a changes and completed at least
3 month of [**Month (only) 4532**]
.
# Diastolic heart failure; echo [**12-5**]:EF>55%, 2+MR, 1+TR.
Patient was discharged on daily laisx and mitolazone; this is
probably now complicated by acute renal failure
- d/c afterload reduction(isordil, metoprolol and Hydralazine)
until sure that BP is stable, Losartan was d/c on last admission
due to ARF
.
# Anasarca: from admission, pt was grossly edematous with weepy
skin. This was likely from low albumin state, diastolic heart
failure, and complicated by acute renal failure. Pt received
aggressive skin care.
.
# Afib with history of junctional arrythymias. EP felt that
there was no indication for amiodarone during past admission,
however, given one time dose of amiodarone at NH (last dose 2
weeks ago). Patient intermittently was in NSR and Afib
throughout hospitalization. Anticoagulation was not initiated
given recent report of hemoptysis.
.
# Respiratory failure: combination of pleural effusion, ?PNA. Pt
was continued on ventilatory support via her trach throughout
her hospitalization.
.
# Thrombocytopenia: stable throughout admission but lower than
her plt count in [**2161-12-31**]. Could have been from low-grade
DIC (high LDH, high Ddimer), although fibrinogen was high.
.
# Hypothyroidism - the patient was continued on her outpatient
regimen of levothyroxine.
.
# Hemoptysis at [**Hospital1 **], apparently broch'd by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1726**] and
was negative. Held [**Last Name (LF) 4532**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] and coumadin.
.
# Psych: pt had very minimal mental status throughout her
hospitalization, only wincing to noxious stimuli but otherwise
not interactive.
.
# CVA: pt had a history of a subacute right occipital infarct
and was on [**First Name3 (LF) **].
.
# Anemia: Work up consistent with ACD and iron
