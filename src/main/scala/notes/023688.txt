Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5755**]
Chief Complaint:
fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with
replacement stent


History of Present Illness:
80yoM with h/o biliary obstruction due to cholangiocarcinoma,
s/p stent placement with h/o prior VRE and Proteus septicemia,
presenting from rehab with fevers, lethargy.  Patient was
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) 66202**]/07.  At that time he was diagnosed
with Proteus and VRE bacteremia and a liver abscess as well as
SBP with peritoneal tap growing sacchromyces cervesiae. A
pigtail catheter was placed to drain the liver abscess.  He was
discharged to rehab on Flagyl, Cipro, and Daptomycin.  Of note,
during that hospitalization family meetings were held with
patient and his [**Date range (1) 802**].  It was determined that he did not want
to pursue further aggressive care or invasive procedures, and
that after rehab he would prefer hospice level care.
.
At rehab he spiked a temperature to 101.4 and exhibited
increasing lethargy, prompting transfer back to [**Hospital1 18**].  In the
ED T 98.2 HR 65 BP initially 89/58, improved to 101/72 after
1.5LNS, RR 16, 96%RA.  He had a CT abdomen performed which
showed persistance of catheter, decrease in size of old abscess
and question of new liver abscess.  He was treated with Zosyn
and Linezolid prior to transfer to the floor.
.
On presentation now he c/o minimal pain over drain site in RUQ.
He denies nausea, vomiting, or change in bowel movements.

Pertinent Results:
[**2132-3-26**] CT ABD/PELVIS: 1. Significant interval decrease in the
size of the right hepatic lobe collection drained by the pigtail
catheter.
2. Significant interval increase in inferior right hepatic
abscess which is not drained by the indwelling catheter. A
second percutaneous catheter placement may be needed to drain
this collection.
3. Unchanged hypodense lesion within the left lobe of the liver,
which may represent a metastasis or a focus of infection.
4. Probably mild interval increase in intrahepatic biliary
ductal dilatation compared to [**2-12**], though comparison
is difficult given differences in technique. There is a small
amount of pneumobilia centrally within the liver, suggesting at
least partial patency of the common bile duct stent.
5. Large amount of stool throughout the colon.
.
[**2132-3-26**] CXR: 1. No evidence of pneumonia. Air within the
inferior right lobe of the liver is located within an abscess,
as seen on CT.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate.
.
[**2132-3-27**] ERCP: Previous placed stent had completed obstructed.
This was removed.
Biliary stricture compatible with malignant biliary stricture in
the middle third of the common bile duct and at the bifurcation.
A 60 mm X 10 mm covered wall stent was placed.
.
[**2132-3-30**] CXR: Worsening bilateral pleural effusions with likely
developing fluid overload/failure.
.
[**2132-3-31**] ECHO: The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is severe regional left  ventricular systolic dysfunction with
mid to distal anterior/anteroseptal akinesis and apical
akinesis/dyskinesis (EF 25-35%). LV systolic function appears
depressed. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are
no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Suboptimal image
quality - patient unable to cooperate.
.
[**2132-4-1**] CXR: Uncomplicated placement of PICC line with
appropriate termination point.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Septicemia in setting of biliary stent occlusion and liver
abscess:  CT showed new liver abscess and worsening intrahepatic
biliary dilation.  Patient underwent ERCP for stent replacement
as well as placement of a percutaneous abscess drain done by
radiology.  LFTs steadily improved s/p ERCP.  He was maintained
on daptomycin and meropenem in house but will complete his
course on vancomycin and meropenem, given enterococcus is
sensitive to vancomycin.  Please check vancomycin trough on
[**2132-4-4**].  Plan for at least 4 weeks of antibiotics.  Patient is
scheduled for follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 803**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of infectious
diseases to follow-up an interval CT and for possible
discontinuation of his drain based on the CT.  A PICC is in
place for antibiotics.  He has been hemodynamically stable and
afebrile with these treatment interventions.
.
# Liver abscess: Abd CT showed decreased size of prior right
lobe abscess (pigtail in place), but new inferiorly located
right liver abscess (~ 6 cm).  Discussed with patient and his
HCP; he would not want surgery but was agreeable to IR drainage.
 Aspirin was held and procedure done.  His other drain was
discontinued.  Biliary stent also replaced this admission, which
may have been a contributing factor.
.
# Systolic CHF: Patient noted to have EF 25-35% on ECHO done to
rule out an overt vegetation.  He also complained of worsening
shortness of breath and had a chest xray which suggested
worsening CHF.  Patient was diuresed and creatinine remained
stable.  He remains stable on room air.  He has been started on
an ACEI and will need qd weight and dietary restriction for
continued management.
.
# Altered mental status: Improved.  Still agitated at night.
Remeron restarted.  Likely infection is contributing.  TSH and
B12 in normal range.
.
# Cholangiocarcinoma: Presumed based on imaging, not
biopsy-proven. Evidence of liver mets. Pt does not desire
chemo/surgery.
.
# Iron deficiency anemia:  Hematocrit stable at 33.  Labs from
[**2-6**] suggest iron deficiency.  Patient started on po supplement.

# DNR/DNI: confirmed with pt and HCP. During prior admit, there
was discussion of possible hospice placement. The patient/HCP
clearly state that they want minimally invasive procedures
(ERCP, abscess drainage) but are declining surgery. Palliative
care was consulted and assisted in discussions with patient.
