Brief Hospital Course:
76yo M with PMH of DM, HTN, known CAD presented s/p VF arrest.

1) Cardiac:

-- Ventricular fibrillation arrest:
Pt became unresponsive while being bathed by his visiting nurse.
Once found at the scene  Pt found to be in Ventricluar
fibrillation and was delivered shock, then a period of asystole,
given epinephrine, period of PEA, then perfusing rhythm. Labs on
arrival were notable for arterial pH 7.04, Trop T 2.35, Lactate
8.8, INR >22, K 6.0, Dig 2.2, Cr 4.8. He was started on Dopamine
drip in in the emergency department for SBP's in 70's. EKG on
admission did not reveal any ST segment changes indicative of
acute ischemia.

Etiology of the VF arrest was considered secondary to acute
infarct, possibly occurring several days prior to admission
accounting for elevation in troponin enzymes. DC cardioversion
alone was considered unlikely to account for early peak in
Troponin enzymes found on admission. Pt also had hyperkalemia ?
secondary to GI bleeding in setting of supratherapeutic INR.
Echocardiogram on admission was limited due to poor windows. The
left ventricular cavity was mildly dilated. Estimated left
ventricular ejection fraction was ~40%. There was probable mid
to distal septal and apical hypokinesis/akinesis (these regions
may also be thinned but could not be fully  visualized). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion were normal. The
right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The mitral valve
appeared structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There was no pericardial effusion.

Patient required dopamine infusion to maintain systolic blood
pressures. This was weaned on hospital day #3. The patient
remained in normal sinus rhythm off pressors for the remaining
duration of the hospitalization.

2) Neurological-
On morning of admission the pt withdrew all four extremities to
pain, had an intact gag reflex, but was otherwise without
pupillary reflexes (pt has poor visual acuity at baseline), no
corneal reflex, no response to nasal septal stimulation.
Neurology consultation was obtained. Two hours later the patient
was noted to have generalized tonic-clonic seizure-like activity
in all four extremities. EEG monitoring confirmed spike and wave
discharge consistent with epileptiform activity with severe
background suppression. These discharges were thought secondary
to anoxic brain injury. The patient was given phenytoin load and
maintenance dosing for supression of motor activity with
seizures, Midazolam drip was also utilized for seizure control.
Continued EEG monitoring revealed status epilepticus despite
medical therapy. Pentobarbital coma was offered, but declined by
the family given extremely poor prognosis for meaningful
neurological recovery from acute anoxic brain injury sustained
during the patient's VF arrest.

After extensive discussion with pt's family and health care
proxy, and no indication of neurological improvement after one
week of supportive care, the patient was started on a morphine
drip and terminally extubated. The patient expired 1 hour later
surrounded by his family.

3) Acute Renal [**Name (NI) 37370**]
Pt was anuric for first 3 days of admission with gradually
rising BUN, Cr, K+ values. Family did not wish to start
dialysis. Pt then became oliguric, and then began autodiuresing
on HD #4 presumably from resolving ATN.
