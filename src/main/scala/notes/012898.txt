Brief Hospital Course:
87 year old male with history of HTN, HL, a. fib on chronic
anti-coagulation with BRBPR.
.
# BRBPR- The patient has a history of diverticular bleeding in
[**2121**]. He was initially admitted to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital in
[**Hospital1 1474**] with a Hct of 24.8 and INR of 1.5 and reports of BRBPR
x wks. He was hemodynamically stable. He continued to pass clots
per rectum and was transfused with 4U PRBCs and his INR was
reversed. A tagged red cell scan was performed, which showed
active bleeding. Surgery was consulted at the OSH and determined
the patient was not a surgical candidate so the patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for IR embolization. At [**Hospital1 18**], the patient
continued to pass BRBPR (clots) and he was transfused an
additional unit. IR took the patient for possible embolization
but did not see any active bleeding so no intervention was
performed. GI was consulted and performed a colonoscopy which
did not show any active areas of hemorrhage, but did show
multiple polyps, diverticulosis, and possible ischemic colitis.
GI recommended an outpatient colonoscopy. The patient remained
hemodynamically stable with a stable hematocrit during his
entire [**Hospital1 18**] admission. The patient was instructed to follow-up
with his PCP for GI referral for colonoscopy. On the day of d/c,
the patient's Hct was 27.1 with INR 1.4.
.
# A. fib - The patient's home medication verapamil was stopped
out of concern for GI bleeding and hypotension; metoprolol 50 mg
TID was continued. On [**8-31**], the patient had an episode of Atrial
fibrillation with RVR and required 10 mg IV Diltiazem pushed. He
was started on 40 mg PO Verapamil TID. He was discharged on his
home medication Verapamil 180 mg SR qd. The patient was
instructed and the rehab facility was notified that he should
restart coumadin on [**9-6**]. The patient's daughter, also his
health care proxy, was made aware of the risks and benefits of
restarting anticoagulation. She expressed interest in speaking
with the patient's PCP about the issue.
.
# HTN- Anti-hypertensives were intially held but were restarted
during the patient's admission. His pressures remained stable
during the admission.
.
# HL- The patient was continued on his home statin.
.
# Recurrent UTIs - The patient has a history of recurrent UTIs
associated with his chronic in-dwelling foley catheter, which he
has had for 5-7 years. His foley was changed in the hospital and
he reports it is changed at home each month. The patient was
intially started on antibiotics at the OSH for his UTI but these
were stopped because the patient was asymptomatic and there is
concern for propagating resistant infections.
.
#IDDM: The patient was kept on sliding scale insulin during this
admission. His insulin requirements were much lower than his
listed home doses of Lantus 16U qam, and 19U qpm. He was
discharged on 10 U qpm but may require up-titration depending on
his blood sugars.
.
The patient was maintained on heparin SC BID for DVT
prophylaxis. His code status was DNR/DNI. Communication was with
the patient and his wife, daughter - his health care proxy, and
son-in-law. Physical therapy worked with the patient and felt it
was in his best interest to go to rehab to regain strength prior
to going home.
