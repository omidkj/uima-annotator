.
EKG [**7-7**]-Artifact is present. Sinus rhythm. The Q-T interval is
prolonged.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2170-10-16**] there is no
significant change.
.
CXR [**7-7**]-PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: Heart size is normal.
Mediastinal contours are unremarkable. Ill-defined opacities
noted diffusely within the left lung, but also within the right
lung base, findings concerning for multifocal pneumonia. No
pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Wedge
compression deformity of a mid thoracic vertebral body is
unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Findings concerning for multifocal pneumonia.
.
[**7-8**] CXR-
The relative hyperlucency of the right upper lung suggests
emphysema, even
though lung volumes are not particularly large. What was a
diffuse
interstitial pulmonary abnormality on [**7-7**] has substantially
cleared with only a small residual at the lung bases, right
greater than left in less than 24 hours. This was pulmonary
edema even though heart size was never enlarged nor was there
substantial pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
58 yo M with chronic back pain, splenectomy, and alcohol abuse
presents with cough and shortness of breath from multifocal
pneumonia.
.
# Multifocal pneumonia: Etiology is most likely
community-acquired pneumonia. Given the possible alcohol use,
aspiration pneumonia considered to be possible. Influenza is
less likely, late for the season. Patient does potentially have
TB exposure risk from outreach program with other veterans. In
