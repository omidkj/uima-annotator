History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 12598**] is a 73 y.o. F with COPD on 2 L NC (at night) at
home followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4507**], history of pneumonia, who
presented with 1 week of flu-like symptoms.  the patient
reported fever of 102.5, cough, lethargy, fatigue, chills and
sweats.  She has some clear sputum.  Also endorses SOB with
chills and sweats, nasal congestion (baseline).  She has not
been drinking much during the past week, coffee, cider, soda and
2 glasses of water.  She states that she feels lightheaded when
going from lying down to standing, which is not her baseline.
Her daughter was concerned about waiting until the morning to be
seen by her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Name11 (NameIs) 64279**] MD [**First Name (Titles) 3675**] [**Last Name (Titles) 2742**] at
[**Hospital1 18**] ED.  Per report, at that time, the patient did not appear
acutely short of breath and was able to ambulate reasonably
well.  The patient did have a flu shot after the illness
started.
.
In the ED, initial VS: T 99.0  HR 103  BP 140/55  RR 24  O2 92%
RA.  T max 102.5. Labs, including blood cultures, were drawn. UA
sent  EKG and CXR were completed.  Given acetaminophen 1 gm po x
1, levofloxacin 750 mg IV x 1, and vancomyin 1 gm IV x 1.  IVFs
x 4 L given in the ED. The patient was initially to go to the
medicine service, but then became hypotension prior to transfer
from ED to floor.  Lowest BP 87/50.  On transfer, last recorded
BP 98/58.
.
Currently, she feels better once arrived in the ICU.

[**Name (NI) **] daughter [**Name (NI) **] was previously a [**Hospital1 18**] nurse.  The patient is

.
STUDIES:
EKG [**2174-10-26**]: NSR at 75 bpm, nl axis, nl intervals, no Q waves,
no TWIs, no ST depressions or elevations (none to compare)
.
PA AND LATERAL CXR [**2174-10-25**] (my read): no infiltrate or effusions
.
SPIROMETRY [**2174-6-9**]:
Oximetry: pt. walked 600 ft, level at a fast pace on RA.
  Rest: SaO2: 90% HR: 73
  Exericse: SaO2: 90% HR: 126
Dx: COPD Medications: Flovent and Albuterol used 2.5 hrs prior.
Good test quality and reproducibility. BMI: 23.7
Mechanics: The FVC and FEV1 are normal. The FEV1/FVC ratio is
mildly to moderately reduced.
Flow-Volume Loop: Mild expiratory coving.
Oximetry: The SaO2 was borderline normal at rest on room air.
There was no significant desaturation with exertion.
.
Impression: Mild obstructive ventilatory defect. The borderline
normal SaO2 suggests a gas exchange defect. Compared to the
prior study of [**2174-1-6**] there has been no significant change
in spirometry.
.
PER DR.[**Location (un) **] NOTE: "This shows evidence of mild obstructive
airways disease with a reduced FEV1/FVC ratio, but preserved
FEV1 and FVC.  FEV1 is 2.15 (93% predicted), FVC 3.56 (110%
predicted), and FEV1/FVC ratio 63%. FEV1 has improved since
[**2174-1-6**].  Flovent and albuterol were taken 2 1/2 hours
prior which may alter the numbers.  BMI is 23.7.  The flow
volume loop does show coving of the expiratory limb consistent
with obstruction.
.
Exercise oximetry was also done today.  After the patient walked
briskly 600 feet on room air, saturation was 90% at rest and
hovered closely around 90% but never below 88%.  Heart rate
increased from 73 to 126 with exertion."


Brief Hospital Course:
MICU COURSE:
============
Ms. [**Known lastname 12598**] is a 73 y.o. F with COPD, history of pneumonia, who
presented with 1 week of flu-like symptoms, admitted to ICU for
hypotension.

1. Hypotension: SBPs noted to be in high 80s in ED. Per ED
report, pt was still mentating and asymptomatic.  She received 4
L NS and by the time she was admitted to the ICU, her SBP had
improved to 110-120s.  She continued to be normotensive without
any further intervention.  Her hypotension was likely secondary
to dehydration during acute illness. She was not orthostatic
upon arrival to ICU.

2. URI: Her symptoms of weakness, myalgias, cough and nasal
congestion suggested viral illness.  She was maintained on
droplet precautions until her influenzae DFA was negative.
Treated symptomatically.

3. Tachycardia: Noted on arrival to ICU. This resolved after IVF
hydration. Likely due to acute illness and dehydration.

4. Acute Renal Failure: Cr 1.2 on admission. Likely prerenal as
it resolved after IVFs.

5. COPD: No signs or symptoms of COPD exacerbation. Maintained
on atrovent and albuterol.

6. OSA: Pt usually on 2 L NC at night as she could not tolerate
CPAP as outpatient.  Currently, on transfer to floor, she is on
3 L NC - likely secondary to volume.

7. Hypertension: Held lisinopril due to hypotension.  Floor team
to restart anti-HTN.

8. Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.

9. Hyperlipidemia: Continue statin.

10. History of Breast Cancer: Continue Aromasin. This was
started after reconciling meds with pharmacy on [**2174-10-27**]

11. Psych: Continue Fluoxetine.

12. Anemia: Normocytic.
