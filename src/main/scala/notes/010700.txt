Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
89 yo female with hx of afib, MGUS, with recent rectopexy and
loop sigmoid colostomy for rectal prolopse complicated by renal
failure and then readmit to the hospital for SOB [**Date range (1) 40090**] now
representing with nausea and vomiting. Pt initially presented
for elective rectopexy and loop sigmoid colostomy performed on
[**12-17**]. The procedure was complicated by volume overload and acute
renal failure due to ATN. She was then readmitted [**Date range (1) 93659**] for
worsening SOB and weight gain. This was felt to be due to CHF
and hypothyroidism with synthroid dose increased and pt diuresed
to her preoperative weight of 105 lbs although effusions on CXR
weren't markedly improved. Of note she was also treated with a 7
day course of Zosyn for a pseudomonal UTI which she completed on
[**1-6**]. She now presents with nausea and vomiting. She reports
symptoms started 2 nights ago after receiving a dose of
antibiotics for cellulitis. After having the medication mixed in
applesauce she began having nonbilious and nonbloody vomitus.
She denied associated abdominal pain, fever or chills. She was
then given multiple nausea medication and felt that the
medications were making her feel more nauseous. This persisted
over the next day and there was concern for ileus so KUB was
obtained today which revealed some dilated loops of small bowel
so she was transferred to the hospital.
In the ED she had a low grade temp to 100.4 with CXR read as
could not rule out PNA so she was given a dose of Zosyn. She was
given 12.5mg of Anzemet for nausea and tyenol for low grade
temp. Due to elevated Alk phos she also underwent RUQ U/S which
revealed.... She also had a large BM and nausea improved. She
now reports feeling hungry and has no current complaints.

.
KUB-Non-specific bowel gas pattern with mild gaseous distention
of a
few loops of small bowel. Extensive amount of stool throughout
the colon suggests constipation.
.
CXR- Persistent moderate bilateral pleural effusions and
atelectasis
of the lower lobes, right middle lobe, and lingula. Underlying
pneumonia cannot be definitively excluded.
.
RUQ U/S-pericholecystic fluid, gallstones, no dilated ducts but
limited view with some sludge in common bile duct, unable to
tell if acute or chronic so would recommended HIDA if clinically
indicated per wet read
.
ECG-
1. Afib at 150, nl axis, low voltage, biphasic T's in v3-6

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P-89 yo female with hx of afib, MGUS, with recent rectopexy
and loop sigmoid colostomy for rectal prolopse [**12-17**] complicated
by acute renal failure and then readmit to the hospital for SOB
[**Date range (1) 40090**] now representing with nausea and vomiting.
.
# Sepsis: she has multiple signs of systemic inflammation with
hypotension. BP has responded to early fluid resuscitation. [**Last Name (un) 104**]
stim appropriate. Continues to have pressor requirement
w/worsening BP and continued difficulties w/rate control.
- IV fluid bolus for goal CVP 12-15 (ECHO with preserved EF)
- continue phenylephrine gtt to keep MAP > 65
- f/u BCX, UCX
- continued Vanc/Zosyn/Flagyl for broad coverage
.
# Pulm Edema/Increased oxygen requirement: Likely component of
pulm edema from fluid resuscitation. Continue resuscitation as
necessary for now for organ perfusion. Monitored clinically for
worsening edema.
.
# ?Cholecystitis: Initially, concerning for this with
leukocytosis, elevated alk phos, and evidence of gallbladder
inflammation on exam.
- GI consulted, recs re: perc drainage
- [**Doctor First Name **] consulted, recs: but not to OR until HD stable
- Biliary consulted, recs: no need for ERCP at this point as no
evidence of ductal dilitation on RUQ U/S
- continued Vanc/zosyn/flagyl
.
# Elevated amylase/lipase: Now trending downward. Likely [**12-28**]
transient onstructive pancreatitis and hypotension from sepsis
- follow amylase and lipase daily
- follow LFTs
.
Despite above interventions, pt continued to have hemodynamic
compromise. Family was notified of decompensation and pt was
