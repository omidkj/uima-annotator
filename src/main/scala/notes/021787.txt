Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left-heart cardiac catheterization.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 83 Y/o M with h/o CAD s/p CABG [**2157**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG
to OM, SVG to D1, SVG to PDA) recently admitted in [**Month (only) 958**] for
NSTEMI and underwent POBA of LMCA and LCx, presented again from
home with recurrent chest discomfort. He recently saw his
cardiologist where he reported occasional exertional and rest
chest discomfort but was felt to be poor candidate for
revascularization. Patient was found by home health aide to have
increasing shortness of breath and worsening chest discomfort at
rest. Patient apparently had shortness of breath since previous
night, but noted acute worsening this AM. He denies any
increased salt intake or non-adherence to diuretic regimen. Home
health felt he looked unwell, and called EMS. Patient says the
pain resembeled his typical anginal symptoms, substernal
radiating to left arm and is similar but less intense than pain
experienced during previous hospitalzation.
.
ECG done by EMS showed ST-depressions and TWI in V2-V5, similar
to ECG changes on previous admission. He was also hypoxic with
saturation fo 85%. He was given 3 sublingual nitroglycerin's by
EMS with incomplete resolution of symptoms. Patient was started
on heparin gtt, nitroglycerin gtt and given 40mg IV furosemide
in the ED. He was then evaluated by cardiology and taken for
catheterization.
.
In the Cath lab, patient was found to have the following:
LMCA with 80% diffuse disease (known to have severe diffuse
disease with moderate calcification on previous catheterization)

LAD occluded with patent LIMA->LAD and good distal flow
LCx with 90% proximal lesion
RCA not injected
.
Unable to cross LCx lesion with balloon, therefore, rotawire of
LMCA and LCx was attempted, with resultant LCx dissection. Final
angiography demonstrated subtotal occlusion of LCx with
extensive midvessel dissection with localized contained
intromyocardial perforation. Patient was then admitted to CCU
for monitoring due to concerns for hemopericardium and
tamponade.

CARDIAC CATH ([**2172-3-26**]):
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Unsuccessful rotational atherectomy of the proximal
circumflex
complicated by mid vessel dissection with contained perforation.


ECHO ([**2172-3-27**]):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is severe regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber
size is normal. There is mild global right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mitral regurgitation is present but cannot be
quantified (?mild-moderate). There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2172-3-3**], the
severity of mitral regurgitation has increased, left ventricular
systolic function is more depressed (septum less vigorous), and
right ventricular free wall dysfunction is now identified. No
pericardial effusion is again seen.

CXR ([**2172-3-27**]):
Interval worsening of now moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Coronary artery disease/NSTEMI:
Patient with substantial history of coronary disease and ST
changes on EKG, positive cardiac enzymes.  Therefore, he
underwent cardiac catheterization with rotawire to LM and LCx
and subsequent dissection of LCx. No stents placed.
Echocardiography x 2 did not demonstrate significant effusion.
Held heparin and integrilin given dissection.  Continued
aspirin/Plavix.  Continued beta-blocker, given CHF. Started
Ezetemibe as patient was supposed to begin on this as
outpatient. Continued with atorvastatin.  Increased Imdur to
120mg daily.  Restarted Ranexa.  ACEI was added as blood
pressure tolerated.

2. Congestive heart failure:
Patient was very volume overloaded on admission and initially
saturating 90% on non-rebreather. Diuresed >9 Liters with
improvement in oxygen requirement (initially used IV lasix,
later changed to PO, then finally back to home regimen of
Torsemide 20mg daily).  An echo showed an EF of 40%.  Restarted
ACE inhibitor when blood pressure was able to tolerate it.  At
the time of discharge, he was saturating in the mid-90s on room
air with a weight of 65kg (143lbs).

3. Rhythm:
Experienced a brief paroxysm of atrial fibrillation with RVR
during hospitalziation that converted spontaneously to sinus
rhythm.  Will use aspirin/Plavix for now, but can consider
starting long-term anticoagulation as outpatient if this recurs.


4. Hypertension:
As above, treated with beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor

5. Hyperlipidemia:
Continued high dose statin with ezetemibde.

6. Chronic renal insufficiency:
Baseline SCr of ~1.6; slightly elevated on admission, but
improved, even with diuresis.  After ACEI was restarted, SCr
back up mildy.  Plan was for outpatient lytes/BUN/Cr within a
week of discharge to ensure stability.

7. Anemia:
Baseline hematocrit is low 30's, but patient appeared to have
hematocrit drop post procedure.  Was transfused 1 unit PRBC
given symptomatic coronary disease and hematocrit < 30.  His
hematocrit was checked daily and remained in the high 20s during
most of his hospitalization.

8. DM/Hyperglycemia:
Elevated blood sugar on admission.  Initially was started on
prior home regimen of NPH.  [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted and noted that
his NPH had been increased recently; he was therefore changed to
this new/increased regimenw with a HISS.  He was discharged on
this regimen with plan for [**Last Name (un) **] follow-up.

9. Depression:
Continued Celexa as per outpatient regimen.
