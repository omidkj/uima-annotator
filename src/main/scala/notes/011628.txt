Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Sub glottic stenosis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
rigid bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
HPI:
60YO f with CRI, obesity/hypoventilation syndrome s/p trach,
HTN, type II DM who has tracheal stenosis and presents for IP
intervention.
Pt had bronchoscopy done at [**Hospital6 6689**] [**5-20**]/ with
significant subglottic stenosis with almost complete
obliteration of the true vocal cord area (unable to pass
bronchoscope through this area). Also noted was significant
posterior pharyngeal tissue collapse and just distal to the
bottom of the trach tube there was obvious granulation tissue
occluding the orifice about 50%.

Pt says that she had URI symptoms in the past week but no
fever/chills. She has required regular suctioning for secretions
She notes that 5 times in the past there has been blood with
suctioning but that this has not occurred in about 5 days.  Pt
notes left leg pain that has been exacerbated by the ambulance
ride. She usually takes tylenol for this.

CT OF THE CHEST AND TRACHEA WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:
Assessment of the airways demonstrates a high-grade subglottic
stenosis, just above the insertion point of the tracheostomy
tube. At this level, there is a near pinpoint diameter of the
airway lumen. There is associated soft tissue thickening around
the airway with probable proximal extension of the narrowing to
the glottis. The stenosis also appears to extend along most of
the length of the tracheostomy tube, although grading of the
stenosis is difficult due to collapse of the airway around the
tubing. Assessment of this portion of the airway is also
difficult due to a component of expiratory phase in this scan.
Below the tracheostomy tube, the distal trachea returns to a
normal caliber. Dynamic airway images demonstrates
bronchomalacic changes involving the lobar and segmental bronchi
and to a lesser extent the main stem bronchi. Note is also made
of an unusual geometry of the insertion of the tracheostomy tube
with a rather lateral orientation, entering from the right side.

Assessment of the lungs demonstrates minor linear opacities in
the right lung consistent with dependent atelectasis or
scarring. A calcified pleural plaque is noted along the left
posterior diaphragm. There are no confluent areas of
consolidation or effusions. The heart, pericardium, and great
vessels are unremarkable. There is a left-sided PICC line
present with the tip terminating in the central portion of the
left brachiocephalic vein as it enters the SVC. There are no
pathologically-enlarged areas of adenopathy. The visualized
portions of the upper abdomen are remarkable for a small hiatal
hernia and evidence of prior cholecystectomy. The osseous
structures demonstrate no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.

IMPRESSION:

1. High-grade subglottic stenosis with pinpoint area of the
airway just above the insertion of the tracheostomy tube. The
circumferential thickening and narrowing appears to extend
proximally to the glottic region and distally along most of the
course of the tracheostomy tube.

2. Bronchomalacic changes involving the lobar and segmental
bronchi and to a lesser extent the main stem bronchi
bilaterally.

3. Minor linear atelectasis or scarring in the right lung.

ADDENDUM:
Multiplanar and 3d images are somewhat limited by motion and
indwelling tube. They confirm stenosis and malacia.
*
IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a 45 cm total PICC line with
the tip in the left brachiocephalic vein, ready for use
*
AP SEMI-UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: The study is limited
secondary to underpenetration. The patient is rotated to the
right. There is bibasilar atelectasis. No evidence of
pneumothorax. A tracheostomy tube is demonstrated with a PICC
line, the distal tip of which is not well seen but appears to
terminate in the left brachiocephalic vein.

IMPRESSION: Limited study secondary to underpenetration. Likely
bibasilar atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P
1) Resp; Pt is on vent at night and trach mask during the day
and did very well at normal settings. Airway is most pressing
issue given marked sub-glottal stenosis.  Pt transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for planned intervention by IP with hopes of revision and
laser ablation.  Findings below:

   Patient has a long tracheostomy tube approximately
   extending 3 to 4 cartilaginous rings above the carina.
   There is evidence of very severe tracheomalacia with
   evidence of severe anterior motion of the posterior
   tracheal wall with just simple suction from the
   bronchoscope, and almost complete obstruction of the
   distal trachea. There was also evidence of severe
   bronchomalacia. Because of the patient's body habitus, the
   patient is ventilator-dependent at night and she already
   has a long tracheostomy tube and no further interventions
   were done.

IP discussed with Pt's primary physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Last Name (STitle) 14502**], who agreed
to accept Pt back to rehab post intervention.  Pt to return to
[**Hospital **] Rehab. Pt to continue with evening Ventilation:
AC/600/12/0.40/5.

2) ID- On admission Pt with possible tracheo-bronchitis, given
increased secretions.  Pt covered with levo empirically to
reduce secretions.  Sputum culture negative, CXR clear and Pt
remained afebrile without leukocytosis.  Antibiotics
subsequently discontinued.

3) TYPE II [**Name (NI) 1568**]  Pt continued on normal regimen of Glargine 10
units qhs, glipizide 10 mg [**Hospital1 **] and covered with a Humalog
sliding scale.  Pt to continue on same regimen upon discharge.

5) CRI: Cr stable near baseline per outside labs.

6) CVS:  Pt with probable CAD remained on outpatient regimen of
ASA and Statin.  Unclear as to EF but no evidence of depressed
function so ACEIs not started but should be considered by PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] remained on outpt CCB for HTN and remained under good control
during hospitalization.

7) Hypothyroid- Continued thyroid hormone replacement

8) Prophylaxis: Pt maintained on PPI and heparin SC.

9) IV: PICC placed by IR without complication as Pt
