History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 7474**] is a 64M with a history
of active prostate cancer s/p completion of radiation tx
yesterday,  who presented to [**Hospital3 **] with dyspnea on
exertion. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital1 **] documentation, he was walking upstairs to
do laundry, and when he came back down he had persistent
shortness of breath. He has had some intermittent DOE for the
last several months, but is usually able to catch his breath
with rest whereas today he felt persistently SOB. According to
his wife, he was told that his grandson (to whom he is very
attached) was in a MVA, and after that he became very anxious
and SOB. She thinks anxiety may play a large role in his SOB.

At [**Hospital1 **], he had O2 sat 92% on 4L by NC. Labs were notable for
WBC of 7.0 with 15% bandemia, Hct of 24.9, creatinine of 4.0,
and lactate of 0.8. He underwent chest x-ray that showed
enlarged aorta, and subsequent CT (noncontrast given renal
failure) that showed dissection extending from arch to beyond
the level of the renal arteries. At that time, it was not known
that he has a history of [**Hospital1 8813**] dissection, and this was felt to
be acute. He was started on BIPAP for his SOB and an esmolol gtt
to control blood pressures. He received levofloxacin for
possible pneumonia and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management of the dissection.  In transit to the ED, he removed
BIPAP so he was placed on NRB.

In the ED, initial VS were Pulse: 113, RR: 22, BP: 149/91,
O2Sat: 100, O2Flow: 100NRB. While in the ED, he developed a
temperature to 102.4 rectal. He received 1 g of vancomycin, 4.5
g Zosyn, and acetaminophen for fever/infection. He was continued
on esmolol gtt and started on nitroprusside gtt. At the time of
arrival to ED, chronicity of patient's [**Hospital1 8813**] dissection was
unknown. He was intubated for planned TEE and MRI prior to
purported surgical intervention. He was sedated with propofol
but BP dropped so changed to fentanyl/versed.
.
On arrival to the MICU, he is intubated and sedated. Has drool
coming from mouth, so suctioned which causes patient to
wince/appear uncomfortable. Otherwise minimally responsive to
Qs.


Past Medical History:

iliac artery. The celiac, SMA, and right renal artery arise from
the true lumen while the left renal artery arises from the false
lumen.

III) Imaging:
CT Chest/Abdomen without Contrast:

IMPRESSION
1. Limited non-contrast CT of the chest and abdomen
demonstrating a type B
[**Year/Month/Day 8813**] dissection extending to the level of the infrarenal
aorta, inferior
aspect not included on the images. The distal extent is not
assessed in this study. Allowing for differences in technique,
this has not significantly changed since the earlier study of
[**2115-7-18**]. Assessment of the false and true lumens and the
visceral branches is limited in this study.

2. New since the prior study are small simple bilateral pleural
effusions
with bibasilar atelectasis.

3. Moderate centrilobular emphysema, apical predominant.

4. 3.8 cm left renal cyst is not characterized in this study, a
non-emergent
renal ultrasound can be performed for further assessment if not
already
obtained.

Renal Doppler US:
IMPRESSION:
1. Normal bilateral main renal artery waveforms and resistive
indices.
2. Left main renal artery cannot followed back to the aorta due
to technical
reasons.
3. Abdominal [**Year (4 digits) 8813**] dissection.

MRA TORSO:
IMPRESSION:

1. Redemonstration of type B [**Year (4 digits) 8813**] dissection with slight
interval increase
in size of the aorta.

2. Moderate-sized pleural effusions with adjacent compressive
atelectasis
bilaterally.
