History of Present Illness:
53 year old male Spanish speaking male (who speaks limited
English) with PMH significant for AIDS (last CD4 was 96 viral
load 189,000 in [**1-/2195**]) off of HARRT due to non-adherence,
toxoplasmosis, CMV, HBV, HCV, and a liver mass (AFP - WNL), who
presents with two weeks of generalized body aches. The patient
reports chronic headache (denies neck stiffness or photophobia),
pleuritic right sided chest pain, lower back pain, and LLE pain.
In addition he also notes drenching night sweats, 30lb weight
loss over several months and decreased P.O. intake. In reference
to his lower back pain, he does have a hx of nephrolithiasis.
However his sx today are not similar to his prior presentation.
He has a chronic cough, which at time produces a "jello"-like
sputum. He reports dysuria for the past year. He's been having
difficulty voiding for the past couple of days.
.
On presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] ED the patient had a T98.8, HR 100, BP
106/66, RR20, O2sat 96%RA. A chest CT was noteworthy for area of
consolidation in the RLL and a subpleural cavitary lesion. Head
CT showed sinusitis but no acute intracranial process. He
received the following doxycycline 100mg PO, ceftriaxone 1g IV
X1, bactrim 400mg IV X 1, and vancomycin 1g IV X 1, augmentin
500mg dose. An ECG was done whcih showed sinus tachycardia and
no PR prolongation.
.
The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
Of note the patient recently presented to [**Hospital1 2177**] with a similar
presentation. He was last seen here at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2-19**] for
nephrolithiasis and PNA. He left AMA and was dicscharged on a
10day course of levaquin. During that time he had ruled out for
tb.

         Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as
also
         RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins,
carbacephems,
         carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.

         Rifampin should not be used alone for therapy.
         Please contact the Microbiology Laboratory ([**5-/2495**])
immediately if
         sensitivity to clindamycin is required on this
patient's isolate.
         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.
