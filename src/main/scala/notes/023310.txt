Hypoxemia

History of Present Illness:
This pt is a 65 yr old female with PMHX significant for stage
IIIb non-small cell lung CA s/p one cycle of Taxol/Carboplatin
and XRT admitted for with shortness of breath and hypoxemia. The
patient states that she has had a persistent cough since her
lung biopsy performed three weeks ago.  She was initially
diagnosed w/ NSCLC [**6-25**] due to 3 weeks of an intractable dry
cough.  In [**7-25**] she also had MRI of brain which showed small
right cerebellar metastasis.  She states that she has had a
chronic dry cough for months but in the last three weeks it has
turned productive with clear sputum.  She also complains of DOE
for the last two weeks.  She also c/o recent decrease in po
intake and per her husband she has lost ~ 10 lbs over the last
three months.  On [**8-17**], day [**2-25**] for her XRT she was note to have
a temp of 100.4 w/ a persistent productive cough.  At that time
a CXR showed LUL density and she was started emprically on
levofloxacin.  Despite taking levo x 4 days pt saw little
improvement in her condition.  She persisted to have fevers with
chills while taking tylenol and [**8-23**] had a temp of 102 and came
to ED.  She denies any nausea, vomiting, chest pain, LE edema
(though present in [**6-25**]), calf pain, palpitations, or change in
sputum culture.

IN ED she was found to have temp 100.4, HR 115-125, BP 123/61,
RR 32, 92% RA.  She was found to have a WBC of 14k, HCT 32,
D-dimer > 8000, lactate of 2.5, ABG 7.49/33/66 on 4L NC.  CXR
also showed new LLL retrocardiac density.  ECG showed sinus
tachycardia, low voltage (previously present), and new Q waves
in V2-V4 compared to EKG from [**2123-7-16**].

CTA angio not performed b/c pt has a hx of hives from contrast
allergy in past.  She was started in heparin drip, given
Cefepime 2 gm IV x1, and 1L NS then transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
monitoring of her hypoxia.

Past Medical History:
Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the lung [**6-25**] s/p
chemo/XRT
Metastasis to the r cerebellum in [**7-25**]
Anxiety
Depression
Type 2 DM x 2 months
Uterine CA in '[**10**] s/p XRT

Social History:
She is married and retired. She worked in a
medical records department. She has 6 children, 11
grandchildren. She smoked for 25 years a pack a day. She quit
about 16 years ago.


Family History:
Pertinent in that her mother died at age 62 with
complications of diabetes, and someone in her family either her
mother or sister evidently had renal cell carcinoma. Her one
sister was recently diagnosed with breast cancer. Her father
died of an MI. No other history if lung cancer.

Pertinent Results:
ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF
80%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated. There are complex (>4mm and/or
mobile) atheroma
in the aortic root. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but not stenotic. There is no
valvular
aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic gradient is likely
related to high
cardiac output. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
borderline
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
----
CTA:
1. Multiple right lung pulmonary emboli.
2. Large left hilar mass and marked mediastinal adenopathy with
left upper lobe atelectasis.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right
----
MRI HEAD:
1. No abnormal areas of enhancement.
2. Nonspecific small T2 and FLAIR signal abnormality in the left
cerebellum.
Recommend correlation with outside studies
3. Chronic lacunar infarct in left centrum semiovale.
----
CXR:
Interval increase in left upper lobe opacity around the apical
mass and worsening of left lower lobe retrocardiac
consolidation. These findings are concerning for a pneumonic
process vs obstructive pulmonary collapse.
----
CXR:
 Diffuse density in the left upper lobe area with concave
delineation is compatible with atelectasis in left upper lobe
area. The density obliterates partially also the aorta and the
mediastinal structures. In the left hila area, an additional
convex contour is noted indicative of a centrally located mass
most likely the cause of the atelectasis in the left upper lobe
as it results in central, subtotal airway obstruction. The
diaphragmatic contour on the left side is obliterated. The same
holds for its invisibility on the lateral view indicative of
both pleural effusion and atelectasis in the posterior segment
of the left lower lobe. The right lung remains aerated with
somewhat irregular vascular distribution, possibly related to
the previously demonstrated pulmonary embolism. The right-sided
mediastinal contour is also prominent suggestive of upper
mediastinal widening related to adenopathy and/or venous
congestion. There is only mild blunting of the right lateral and
posterior pleural sinus. Comparison with the next previous AP
single chest view obtained on [**2123-9-2**], both the
atelectasis in the left upper lobe and the hilar density appear
to have increased. There is no evidence of any pneumothorax as
it existed on more remote examinations.
