for lymphadenopathy--[**Last Name (un) 41269**] with CT chest.

CT chest [**2191-12-24**]:
 Large bilobed thyroid mass (arising from rt lobe) extending
inferiorly into the anterior/superior mediastinum with upper and
lower masses connected by a narrow waist - overall dimensions of
upper and lower segments of this bilobed mass are approx 6.4
(tr) x 4.4 (cc) x 4.2 (AP) cm and 5.1 (tr) x 5.8 (CC) 4.0
(AP) respectively. ++ mass effect on the mid trachea at the
level of the T1-2 with >50% loss of AP diameter of the trachea.
additional small left thyroid nodule. no lymphadenopathy.

Thyroid Ultrasound [**2191-12-26**]
 A large heterogeneous, hypervascular mass arising from the
inferior pole of the right thyroid lobe and isthmus, extending
inferiorly into the mediastinum. The lesion is further
characterized on the CT chest exam of [**2191-12-24**].

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1683**] is a 32-year-old female who has a history of HTN,
migraines, and no known diagnosis of asthma but requiring
Ventolin with previous URI's, who presented to the ED with SOB
and was found to have thyroid mass with > 50% obstruction of mid
trachea.
She was admitted to the MICU for observation. High dose steroids
were given initially for possible tracheal edema exacerbating
her tracheal narrowing and causing her current symptoms. She was
initially given IV Solu-Medrol 80mg TID and then switched to
prednisone 60mg daily which was discontinued after her last dose
on [**12-27**].  She was also on standing Robitussin+codeine for her
cough and SQ heparin for DVT PPX. During her MICU stay she
continued to have episodes of SOB/Stridor/cough/nausea which
were attributed to her tracheal obstruction and responded to
Ventolin and lidocaine inhalation, antiemetics and reassurance.
She remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable throughout her
stay. Patient had history of recently diagnosed HTN but her BP's
in the MICU were largely WNL. Leukocytosis was noted and thought
to be [**1-12**] steroid treatment. Patient was followed by endocrine,
general surgery and thoracic surgery teams. On [**12-27**] she was
taken to the OR and is status post resection substernal goiter,
cervical approach,
right thyroidectomy.The procedure was tolerated well and she was
transferred to the recovery room and admitted to the SICU
overnight where she was hemodynamically stable.She was later
transferred to the inpatient general surgery unit POD 1 and her
postoperative course was stable.

Neurological: The patient received IV pain medication with good
effect and adequate pain control. When tolerating oral intake,
the patient was transition to oral pain medications.
Cardiovascular: The patient was monitored on telemetry and vital
signs were routinely monitored which were stable.
Pulmonary: The patient received nebulizer treatment
appropriately and was monitored closely. She had no dyspnea and
had adequate O2 sats on room air.
GI/GU: Post-operatively, the patient was given IV fluids until
tolerating oral intake. The diet was advanced from clears to
regular which was tolerated well. Intake and output were closely
monitored.
ID:  The patient's temperature was closely watched for signs of
infection, and the incision remained clean, dry, intact,and
without erythema or hematoma.
Endocrine: The patient's calcium prior to discharge was normal.
Prophylaxis: The patient wore pneumatic compression boots, and
was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as possible.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet, ambulating,
voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
Disposition:The patient was discharged home in good condition
and will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and endocrinologist.
