HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM (CONTINUED):  The patient was
transferred to the floor on [**2170-3-7**] because she was
stable.

 1.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  Continued continuous positive airway
pressure overnight.  Head of bed to 45 degrees at all times.
Inhalers and nebulizers as needed for her obesity
hypoventilation syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea.

 2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient was treated with
10 days with linezolid for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus
urinary tract infection and methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteremia.  Her cultures remained
negative with no growth to date.  A wound care nurse [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 4221**] for her decubitus ulcers, and she was continued on
Baricaire bed to promote wound healing.

 3.  CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM/ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  The patient
was rate controlled on metoprolol, diltiazem, and amiodarone.
Anticoagulation was held secondary to the gastrointestinal
bleed.  Hypertension was controlled with beta blocker.  She
was continued on aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d., and there were no
events on telemetry, which was eventually discontinued.

 4.  GASTROINTESTINAL ISSUES:  The patient has a history of
gastrointestinal bleeds with melanosis coli and question of
ischemic colitis on admission.  There was no further evidence
of bleeding, and she was felt to be high risk to pursue
colonoscopy on.  She was to continue proton pump inhibitor.

 5.  ANEMIA ISSUES:  Continued to check the patient's
hematocrit and transfuses as needed for a hematocrit of less
than 30 because of her history of coronary artery disease.

 6.  NEUROPSYCHIATRIC ISSUES:  The patient's mental status
was stable.  She continued to be held from her psychiatric
medications.

 7.  ENDOCRINE ISSUES:  For her diabetes, she was begun on
NPH-10 100 units subcutaneously q.a.m. 40 units
subcutaneously q.p.m. and a regular insulin sliding-scale.

 8.  OPHTHALMOLOGIC ISSUES:  For exposure keratopathy, she
was seen by Ophthalmology who recommended erythromycin
eyedrops, and lubrication drops.

 9.  FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION ISSUES:  The patient
continued to be nothing by mouth because of aspiration risks.
She was tolerating tube feeds at goal.

Both Gastroenterology and Interventional Radiology were
[**Last Name (Titles) 4221**] again regarding possibly placing a percutaneous
endoscopic gastrostomy tube in this patient.  After careful
review of her hospital course and her data, it was felt that
there was still a small window for access, but is not
transhepatic, transcolonic, or through the costal area.
Similarly, Interventional Radiology was unable to find a
window to place the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.
Therefore, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement
was deferred.  Instead, the patient had a Dobbhoff tube
placed, and tube feeds were continued.

10.  ACCESS ISSUES:  Her peripherally inserted central
catheter line remained in place.

11.  PROPHYLAXIS ISSUES:  She was continued on a proton pump
inhibitor and subcutaneous heparin.
