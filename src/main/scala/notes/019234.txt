History of Present Illness:
69M with a complicated medical history with multiple right
pleural effusions. These started after an ablation procedure for
atrial fibrillation in [**2177-7-9**]. He developed pericarditis and
pleural effusion after that procedure, which were treated with
indomethacin. He had these pleural effusions drained on
several occasions, but they recurred.He had cardiac surgery to
correct severe aortic valve disease with bioprosthetic valve and
CABG x2 on [**2178-4-28**]. He was seen by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 35684**] on [**2178-11-24**] for
evaluation of recurrent right pleural effusions. On [**2178-12-14**] he
underwent right thoracotomy and decortication. He was discharged
on [**2178-12-24**]. According to his rehab he became somnolent, had a
PCO2 of 80 and was transferred to [**Hospital3 **] where he was kept in
the ICU for the past 2 days. Here they did a CT scan that per
report showed a complex right pleural effusion. He was also per
report found to be apneic while on bipap at night. He presented
here as an ICU to ICU transfer.

Upon arrival he was AAO X 3, but complained of feeling
"confused" and "in and out of it". He was saturating well on NC,
but his gas showed a PCO2 of 80, so he was kept in the ICU.


Past Medical History:
1. CAD, s/p MI at 54 y/o, s/p 2v CABG ([**2178-4-28**]), balloon
angioplasty [**2161**]
2. Aortic stenosis s/p bioprosthetic [**Year (4 digits) 1291**] replacement
3. ?ASD vs PFO

Pertinent Results:
CTA [**2179-1-18**]
FINDINGS: A previously placed right-sided chest tube has been
removed in the interval. There is a newly appeared potentially
loculated moderately
extensive right pleural effusion. On the left, a minimal pleural
effusion is seen.

Newly appeared are extensive bilateral, right more than left,
parenchymal
consolidations with ill-defined borders and multiple tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**]
opacities and ground-glass opacities at the interspaces with
normal lung. The findings are strongly suggestive for pneumonia.


Mild apical ventral air inclusions in the right-sided pleura.

No other lung parenchymal abnormalities.

Mild-to-moderate increase in size of the mediastinal lymph
nodes.

The opacification of the pulmonary arteries is sufficient in
quality to rule out the presence of PE in the central and
segmental arteries. No enlargement of the right ventricle, no
septal thickening.

Moderate coronary calcifications, status post sternotomy and
cardiac surgery.

No abnormalities detected in the upper abdomen.

[**2179-1-21**] CXR:

FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. The monitoring and support devices are in constant
position.
Moderate left and moderate-to-extensive right pleural effusion
with subsequent areas of parenchymal opacities. Unchanged
moderate cardiomegaly. Unchanged right apical pleural
appearance. No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities on
today's image.

[**1-6**] - CT Chest (OSH): Probable exudative bilateral pleural
effusions, grater on R. R effusion is moderate in size with
multiple locules of gas. This is improved from prior study where
the thin enhancing pleural rind suggested exudative process. New
small left pleural effusion again with potentially thickened
pleura. Mildly enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.
