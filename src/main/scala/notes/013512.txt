History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 61467**] is a 59 M with known metastatic renal cell carcinoma
on daily [**Hospital 61468**] transferred from OSH [**3-4**] obstructing metastatic
disease to RML seen on bronchoscopy today.  Pt reports [**3-5**] month
history of fatigue and night sweats.  Also over the last few
months he has had progressively worsening cough and dyspnea on
exertion.  Also few episodes of hemoptysis.  Two weeks ago he
was started on antibiotics after outpatient visit for cough and
was told that he had pneumonia.  He reports that CXR was not
done at this time.  He felt that he never recovered from this
episode and cough worsened during the last 3 days prior to OSH
admission.  One day prior to OSH admission he had severe cough
and dyspnea while driving that forced him to stop his car.  He
has never had chest pain with any of this.  No fevers, leg
swelling, HA, abd pain, diarrhea/N/V, dysuria. + weight loss
with start of treatement for RCC.

Past Medical History:
Metastatic renal cell carcinoma: His left renal mass was
diagnosed during workup for hypertension in [**2193-3-3**]. Known
mets to lung, liver, vertebrae. Had treatments below:
-Left nephrectomy in [**3-/2193**], which revealed a grade [**3-6**] clear
cell carcinoma.
-Interferon, administered as part of a CALGB study comparing
interferon alone with an interferon/Avastin combination at the
[**Hospital3 328**] Cancer Institute.  The patient was taken off study
in
[**10/2194**] because of disease progression.  He claims to have
subsequently been treated with Avastin off study.
-Radiation therapy to the left ischium.
-Zometa therapy, terminated because of a significant increase
in his creatinine.
-Nexavar begun in [**2-/2195**] and promptly terminated because of
severe gastrointestinal side effects (e.g. cramping and
diarrhea).
-High-dose interleukin-2 in [**9-/2195**], which led to transient
disease stabilization.
-[**Year (4 digits) **] begun in [**11/2195**] because of disease progression.
.
Other PMH:
-MI in [**2193**]
-HTN

Pertinent Results:
Summary of OSH results:
Bronchoscopy [**8-14**]: mas almost completely occluding RML takeoff
and subsegemental takeoff of RLL. Highly vascular, fragile,
bleeding mass was not obvious for risk of heavy bleeding.
Cytology, microbiology were sent off from BAL.
[**8-11**] CXR: R pleural effusion, L pleural effusion, hilar
lymphadenopathy, no congestion
[**8-11**] CT: no PE; RmL consolidation with pronounced RML
atelectasis that appears almost complete, extensive pleural and
parenchymal lesions. Pathological fracture at T12; several liver
lesions
CBC on [**8-11**] - WBC 3.1 H/H 10.4/23; plts 493; Cr 0.7 LFTs nl; tB
0.3;


Brief Hospital Course:
Respiratory Failure/Post-Obstructive PNA:  The patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] OMED on [**8-14**].  Bronchoscopy showed
obstructive renal cell carcinoma metastastic endobronchial
lesions in RML, medial basilar RLL, and LLL.  HE had
photodynamic therapy on [**8-19**] and subsequently developed
post-procedure respiratory distress requiring intubation on
[**8-22**].  Repeat bronchoscopies were done for tumor debridement on
[**8-22**], and clearance of secretions on [**8-23**].  Then treated with 14
day course of vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia, and also aztreonam
and cipro.  Subsequently, he became volume overloaded, requiring
diuresis.  His HCT drifted down to 20, and received 2 units
PRBCs on [**8-26**] and [**8-28**]; anemia presumed due to bleeding
metastases.  Repeat bronchoscopy on [**8-31**] showed persistent RML
obstruction and RML pneumonia.  Due to difficulty weaning from
the ventilator, he underwent trach and PEG on [**9-7**], after which
he was quickly weaned to PS and then to tracheal mask by [**9-8**].
He returned to the MICU temporarily after having pulled out his
endotracheal tube, but respiratory distress again resolved with
re-placement of the endotracheal tube.  Sputum cultures from [**9-7**]
grew MRSA as well as 2 strains of Pseudomonas. Vancomycin
intravenous Q 12H and meropenem 500 mg intravenous Q6H (every 6
hours) began on [**2196-9-15**].  Please continue both antibiotics for
12 more days after discharge for 14 day course.
