Pertinent Results:
Pre-bypass:
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed
(LVEF= 40 %). with normal free wall contractility. There are
simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is severe mitral annular calcification.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve is abnormal. There is no pericardial effusion.

Post-bypass:
The patient is receiving 0.02 mcg/kg/min of epinephrine
post-bypass and is paced.
There is a well-seated mitral valve bioprothesis without
valvular regurgitation. The leaflets appear to move normally.
There is a posterior annular paravalvular jet. These findings
were discussed with the surgeon.
The aorta is intact post-decannulation.
All other findings are consistent with pre-bypass findings.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted preoperatively for heparin bridge due to atrial
fibrillation.  Next day she was brought to the operating room
for mitral valve replacement and coronary artery bypass graft,
see operative report for further details.  She received
cefazolin for perioperative antibiotics.  Postoperatively she
was transferred to the intensive care unit for hemodynamic
management.  In the first twenty four hours she was weaned from
sedation and extubated.  Neurologically she was oriented but
forgettful which improved over the next few days and returned to
baseline.  She remained in the intensive care unit awaiting a
floor bed.  Physical therapy worked with her on strength and
mobility.  She continued to progress, her medications were
adjusted for her rhythm as she goes in and out atrial
fibrillation which is her baseline.  Her coumadin was
preogressively increased and she was ready for discharge to
rehab on post operative day seven.
