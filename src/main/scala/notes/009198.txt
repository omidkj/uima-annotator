History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 39287**] is a 67 year old man with a history of CVA, CAD,
with known total LCx disease s/p cardiac catherization with
unsuccessful revascularization of the LCx in [**2123**], who
presetnted to [**Hospital3 4107**] after being found collapsed on the
ground near his lawn mower. CPR was started in the field by a
witness, and the patient was shocked once from an AED.  When EMS
arrived, the patient was found to have a weak pulse.  Shortly
after EMS arrival the patient went back into VFib, and again was
defibrillated.  The patient was given 150mg of Amiodarone and
again went into VFib and recieved a 3rd shock.  The patient then
regained a pulse and was noted to be in VTach, and eventually
recieved a total of 300mg Amiodarone.  GCS during this time was
noted to be 3.  The patient was brought to [**Hospital3 4107**] ED
and V/S at that time were: T-95.6, BP 92/66, R-26, P-72, O2 100%
on Mechanical Vent.  Records from [**Hospital3 4107**] indicate the
patient continued to recieve CPR while in the ED, and a 12-lead
EKG showed ST elevation in leads III, aVF and ST depression in
leads II, V4-V6.  Given these EKG changes and the possibility of
active ischemia, it was then arranged for the patient to be
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for elective cardiac catherization.
.
Notably, per wife and daughter patient has had reduced exercise
and exertional capacity since his MI in [**2123**]. Recently, he had
decreased exercise tolerance with DOE when ambulating short
distances, though orthopnea, PND or lower extremity edema.
.
On review of systems, wife denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. Wife denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. Wife denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

[**6-11**] C.Cath:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated two vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA was
very short
and patent. The LAD had 100% occlusion of the distal LAD with
wrap
around vessel to the apex and inferior wall that recanalized via
left to
left collaterals. The diagonal branches were very small caliber
and had
60-70% stenoses in the proximal portion. The LCX was occluded
proximally. This was briefly probed with 3 wire while awaiting
further
outside hospital medical record which confirmed that the LCX
occlusion
to be chronic and underwent a failed attempt in [**2123**] at SEMC.
There were
faint collaterals from the RCA ot the OMB1 and OMB2. The RCA was
a very
tortuous vessel with hyperdominant sytsem. There was maximum 40%

stenosis and extreme tortuosity.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics were performed. The systemic
arterial
pressures were 103/68mmHg.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal systemic arterial pressures.

[**6-12**] Echo:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe focal
hypokinesis of the inferior, inferolateral, and inferoseptal
walls (EF 35%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is
seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired
relaxation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Concentric left
ventricular hypertrophy with moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease.
Impaired left ventricular relaxation.

[**6-11**]: Femoral US
IMPRESSION:
Normal right groin ultrasound with no pseudoaneurysm, no AV
fistula, and no hematoma identified.

[**2125-6-14**]: Cardiac MR
1. Mild increase left ventricular cavity size with regional left
ventricular
systolic dysfunction. The LVEF was moderately decreased at 39%.
Late
gadolinium contrast-enhanced CMR images demonstrating areas of
hyperenhancement as described above. The findings are consistent
with
myocardial scar and low likelihood of functional recovery of the
basal-mid
inferolateral, and inferior walls.
2. Normal right ventricular cavity size and mild systolic
dysfunction. The
RVEF was mildly decreased at 40%.
3. The indexed diameters of the ascending and descending
thoracic aorta were
normal. The main pulmonary artery diameter index was normal.
4. A note is made of bibasal pulmonary atelectasis.



Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
This is a 67 year old male with h/o CAD and s/p MI in [**2123**]
without successful intervention who was found down likely [**2-5**] VT
arrest, underwent c.cath without intervention and completed a
cooling protocol.

# CAD:  On admission patient underwent cardiac catheterization
which demonstrated chronic LCX occlusion and LAD total occlusion
