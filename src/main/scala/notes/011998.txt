Brief Hospital Course:
66 yo F w/ PMH of diabetes and history of DKA who presented in
DKA and was originally admitted to the ICU and was

#Diabetic Ketoacidosis-Patient meets criteria for DKA with
glucose >200 with anion gap of 28 and kenonuria,she did not have
a blood gas but with the gap and low bicarb it is clearly a
metabolic acidosis. Most likely trigger was medication
non-adherence in the setting of nausea, vomiting, and poor PO
intake since receiving her last dose of chemo approximately 3
weeks prior.  She had not been administering her full dose of
Lantus and missed some doses of humalog because she was not
eating well.  She had no obvious signs or symptoms of infection:
 chest x-ray was negative for consolidation, urinalysis was
negative, blood cultures were no growth to date after 3 days at
time of discharge.  EKG showed now signs of myocardial ischemia.
 She reports a previous hospitalization with ICU stay for DKA in
[**2-/2181**] with unclear precipitant ([**Name (NI) 10540**] vs. wound seroma). She was
started on insulin drip and [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted. She was
transitioned off of the insulin drip during her first night and
was switched back to her home regimen with a more aggressive
sliding scale.  She was discharged on 15U lantus in the morning,
a sliding scale, and has follow-up with [**Last Name (un) **] as an outpatient.

#Gastric cancer- patient is s/p surgical resection and now s/p 3
cycles of chemotherapy. She continues to be followed by her
oncologist.  As a result of chemo, she has had persistent
nausea, vomiting, and poor PO intake.  She gets weekly IV fluid
infusions, and will continue upon discharge.

#Hypertension- Normotensive during this admission on home
verapamil, metoprolol, valsartan.  Furosemide was held given
poor PO intake and intermittent mild orthostasis.  Defer to PCP
whether to restart this medication.

#Hyperlipidemia-continued home crestor

#Anxiety-Continued home cymbalta & zolpidem

#Slowed mentation / speech- patient had slowed mentation on
admission. She has a history of multiple ED visits for concern
of her slowed speech/aphasia and has been admitted to neurology
previously.  She was last seen [**2181-7-14**] by an inpatient
neurologist, who diagnosed her with complicated migraines.  Her
TSH was checked during this admission and was found to be 4.1.
She is followed by neurology as an outpatient.  Her case manager
reported two unprovoked falls prior to admission.  She was seen
by inpatient PT, who recommended home PT.  Had mild,
asymptomatic orthostatics.

TRANSITION OF CARE ISSUES

furosemide (lasix).  We stopped this medication during your
