Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 76-year-old man with increasing shortness of
breath on exertion.  He is a postoperative admit, admitted
directly to the Operating Room for an aortic valve
replacement as well as coronary artery bypass grafting.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is status post MI with
cardiac cath done in [**2124**].  This showed coronary disease that
was treated medically at that time.  Recently he began
experiencing increasing shortness of breath, had a positive
exercise tolerance test and a repeat catheterization that
showed an EF of 62 percent, LAD 30 percent occlusion, OM1
with 90 percent stenosis, RCA with 100 percent stenosis,
circumflex with 30 percent stenosis and a 50 percent left
main lesion.  Additionally, the patient was shown to have an
aortic valve area of 0.9 cm2 with a mean gradient of 37.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for atrial fibrillation,
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, lower extremity
varicosities, CAD, status post IMI in [**2124**], renal calculi,
status post right renal lithotomy, history of testicular
cancer treated with radiation and an orchiectomy in [**2098**].  He
also has a history of cholecystectomy in [**2129**].

MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:  Lipitor 40 mg every day,
Norvasc 5 mg every day, lisinopril 20 mg every day,
amiodarone 200 mg every day, aspirin 81 mg every day, and
folic acid 400 mcg every day.

The patient states an allergy to IVP dye with a note that it
caused an anaphylactic response.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for father who died of an MI at
87 years old.  Mother died at 69 of leukemia.

The patient is retired, lives with his wife and son.  Remote
tobacco use, quit 15 years ago, and rare alcohol use.  No
other recreational drug use.

The patient had a carotid ultrasound done prior to surgery
that showed bilateral clean carotids.

PHYSICAL EXAM PRIOR TO ADMISSION:  Heart rate 78, blood
pressure 175/64, respiratory rate 20, O2 sat 98 percent on
room air.  Height was 5 feet 5 inches, weight 142 pounds.  In
general a thin, older man in no acute distress.  Skin showed
no obvious lesions.  HEENT showed pupils equally round,
reactive to light with extraocular movements intact.  Normal
buccal mucosa.  Neck was supple with no JVD.  He had a murmur
that radiated bilaterally to the carotids.  Chest was clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart was regular rate and
rhythm, S1 and S2 with a III/VI systolic ejection murmur.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive
bowel sounds.  No hepatosplenomegaly or CVA tenderness, and a
well healed cholecystectomy scar.  Extremities were warm and
well perfused with no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Neurologically cranial nerves III through XII were grossly
intact.  Nonfocal exam.  Moved all extremities with 5/5
strength.  The patient had 2 plus pulses distally,
bilaterally equal.

EKG showed sinus rhythm at 66 with an old IMI and left
ventricular hypertrophy.

On [**11-11**] the patient was admitted directly to the
Operating Room for a scheduled AVR and CABG.  Please see the
OR report for full details.  In summary, the patient had an
AVR with a number 25 [**Last Name (un) 3843**] [**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial valve and
a  CABG times two with a LIMA to the LAD and saphenous vein
graft to the ramus.  His bypass time was 214 minutes with a
crossclamp time of 184 minutes.  The patient tolerated the
operation and was transferred from the Operating Room to the
Cardiothoracic ICU.

At the time of transfer the patient had propofol, epinephrine
and Levophed infusing.  In the immediate postoperative period
the patient remained hemodynamically stable, however, he was
slow to awaken and ultimately neurology was consulted.
Following the neurology consult the patient underwent an MRI
that showed a small right cerebellar stroke of questionable
age, felt most likely to be an old lesion.  He also had an
EEG on postoperative day one that showed encephalopathic
slowing and repeat carotid ultrasounds were negative for
stenosis bilaterally.

Additionally, the patient had poor oxygenation despite full
ventilation, and by chest x-ray showed signs of early ARDS.
On postoperative day two his chest x-ray showed progressing
ARDS.  A bronchoscopy done at that showed time showed mild
inflammation.  Furthermore, the patient showed a bump in his
creatinine from his baseline of 1.7 to 2.3 and a renal
consult was called at that time.  Throughout this period the
patient continued to require pressors to maintain an adequate
blood pressure.

On postoperative day three the patient's respiratory status
continued to deteriorate, following with the diagnosis of
acute respiratory distress.  The intensivist hospitalist team
was consulted to gather suggestions on ventilatory support.
The patient was fully sedated and changed to pressure
controlled ventilation at that time.  It should be noted that
throughout this period the patient also had persistent
fevers, despite negative blood, urine, and sputum cultures.

On postoperative day four the patient went into atrial
fibrillation, which also caused an increasing pressor
requirement.  His respiratory status continued to be an issue
and at that time the patient was chemically paralyzed as
well.  He at that time also had an increasing white blood
cell count and infectious disease was consulted as was
pulmonary consulted.  Ultimately on postoperative day eight
the patient was shown to have Proteus in his blood and E.
coli in his urine.  He was treated with appropriate
antibiotics at that time.

During the next week the patient had a relatively stable
hospital course, during which his renal failure slowly
resolved.  His neurological status gradually improved, to the
point where once the paralysis was discontinued the patient
was following commands.  However, his pulmonary status
continued to wax and wane.  Ultimately by the week of
[**Holiday **] [**2130**] the patient was able to be switched from
pressure controlled ventilation to assist controlled
ventilation.  At that time thoracic surgery was consulted and
on [**11-25**] the patient had a trache and PEG.  During
this period the patient continued to be sedated with fentanyl
and Versed, which were slowly being weaned.

The week following the patient's trache and PEG, serial chest
x-rays showed resolving ARDS, however, he also had bilateral
pleural effusions.  For this pigtail catheters were placed
bilaterally on the first of [**Month (only) 404**] and the effusions were
drained.  The patient continued to make slow progress with
his ventilatory wean.  As his sedation was decreased the
patient became more alert and responsive.  Following the
drainage of his pleural effusions attempts were made to
switch the patient to pressure support ventilation, which
initially failed, requiring additional assist controlled
ventilation.  Ultimately by the second week of [**Month (only) 404**] the
patient was doing pressure support ventilation during the day
with assist control resting at night.  By the third week of
[**Month (only) 404**] the patient was on pressure support ventilation with
pressure supports of 12 to 18 during the day and rested with
pressure supports of 20 to 25 at night.

The week of the [**11-18**] the patient was noted to have
increasing pressure support needs in order to maintain
adequate tidal volumes and not be progressively dyspneic.  A
chest x-ray done on the 20th showed a right lower lobe
pneumonia.  At that time the patient was restarted on
antibiotics.  Sputum cultures done at that time showed Gram
positive cocci with budding yeast and the patient was also
begun on fluconazole.  Chest x-ray done on the [**11-22**] showed resolving pneumonia.  Additionally, the
patient had a white count that had resolved at that point.

At this time it is felt the patient is stable and ready to be
transferred to pulmonary rehabilitation.  His physical exam
shows vital signs with temperature 99, heart rate 90 to 100
sinus rhythm, blood pressure 105 to 110 over 50.  Respiratory
rate generally ranges in the high
