History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 65 yo Vietnamese male w/ a PMH sig for Non-small cell
endobronchial lung CA s/p RMSB stent ([**5-21**]), COPD, and CRI
recently admitted to OSH on [**6-27**] w/ increased SOB and O2 sat in
the 70??????s.  He denied CP/N/V/HA/change in UO/recent travel/sick

pna and COPD exacerbation. He was started on steroids, Nebs,
BiPAP, and gatafloxacin.  On [**6-28**] he was intubated secondary to
resp failure, w/ resultant PTX.  2 Chest tubes were placed at

one of his CT??????s was removed on [**7-8**].  Pt was initially noted to
be confused and agitated, which has subsequently improved once
he left the MICU. A post-pyloric NGT was successfully placed and
pt was at goal tube feeds of 40 cc/hr.  He noted a non-radiating

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 65 yo Vietnamese male with a PMH sig for Non-small cell
endobronchial lung CA s/p RMSB stent ([**5-21**]), COPD, and CRI
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU on [**2128-7-2**] for inability to wean from a
ventilator. Pt was inititally admitted to an OSH with resp
failure secondary to pneumonia, which required intubation. He
susequently developed a Left PTX and received 2 Left sided chest
tubes. Pt was extubated on [**7-7**] and one of his CT??????s was removed
on [**7-8**]. Pt was initially noted to be confused and agitated,
which has subsequently improved once he left the MICU. A
post-pyloric NGT was successfully placed and pt was at goal tube
feeds of 40 cc/hr. Throughout his stay he noted a non-radiating
pain in his L chest over the CT. He continued to have a cough.
Pt also received a post-pyloric nasogastric tube after he failed
a swallow evaluation post extubation.  He was maintained at goal
tube feeds of 40 cc/hr until he pulled out the tube.  A repeat
swallow evaluation was normal and the patient's diet was
advanced as tolerated.

1. Respiratory Failure.  Etiology thought to be multifactorial.
Pt was successfully extubated on [**2128-7-7**] and transferred out of
the intensive care unit on [**2128-7-10**].  His O2 sats were initially
maintained on 2.5 L NC and on RA prior to discharge. Oncology
was consulted while the pt was in the intensive care unit for
his NSCLC. It was determined that he was not a surgical
candidate and radiation oncology was consulted to talk to the pt
about radiation therapy for palliation. A CT w/ contast was done
to evaluate his tumor burden. He was given IVF and mucomyst for
his CRI. Pt will follow-up with radiation oncology and oncology
as an out-patient.

2. COPD. Likely contributing to his respitory symptoms. He was
started on prednisone in the unit, which was subsequently
tapered prior to his discharge. He was continued on nebulizer
and inhaler treatments. He was also given Guaifenesin q 6 hrs
for cough.

3. PTX, thought to be secondary to barotrauma. One chest tube
was removed in the unit. Subcutaneous emphysema developed. It
sebsequently improved and the chest tube was changed from wall
suction to water seal and then to air. It continued to drain pus
and was left in place at the time of discharge as per thoracic
surgery's recommendation.  The patient and his daugher were
instructed on how to care for the tube and a follow-up
appointment was made with thoracic surgery.  They plan to remove
the tube 2 inches per week.

4. HTN. Well controlled throughout his hospital stay on ACEI and
B-B.

5. Hyponatremia.  Etiology thought to be secondary to large
amounts of free water boluses added to his tube feeds.
Hyponatremia resolved once the fluid boluses were decreased.

6. CRI. Baseline Cr reported as 1.7. Cr decreased to 1.2,
however bumped to 1.5 post contrast. He was aggressively
hydrated and his Cr improved to 1.3 on day of discharge.

7. ID. staph bacteremia- initially started on iv oxacillin which
was then changed to dicloxacillin. Pt continued to spike temps
during his stay.  Bld, Sputum, Pleural fluid, and Urine cultures
were obtained.  Blood and pleural fluid with MSSA. Urine grew
GPC in pairs and clusters.  Pt started on IV Vanco while on the
floor.

8. GI. Pt had 1 episode of melena. Etiology thought to be
gastritis or small ulcer. pt has 2 PIV's. he was consented and
crossmatched, however remained hemodynamically stable. He was on
po protonix. No EGD performed given clinical stability &
comorbities.

9. Agitation.  Noted while pt was in the unit, however appeared
to resolve once the patient was on the floor. He was initially
controlled on Haldol prn with a sitter.

10. Social.  SW consulted to help pt and family cope w/ new dx
of CA.
