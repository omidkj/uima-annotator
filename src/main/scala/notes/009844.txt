Brief Hospital Course:
51 y/o female with history of HCV and possible HCC and ETOH
abuse in the past who now presents for orthotopic liver
transplant.
She was taken to the OR with Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and underwent
Orthotopic deceased donor liver transplant (piggyback) portal
vein to portal vein anastomosis, common bile duct to common bile
duct without a T tube, splenic artery of the recipient to the
common hepatic artery of the donor. The patient received 4 units
FFP and 4 units RBCs in the OR. She had persistent air in the
right chest. Despite earlier aspiration, the air persisted so a
[**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain was placed as a chest tube into the right chest and
placed to Pleur-Evac suction.
She had two JP drains placed. She tolerated the surgery and was
transferred to the SICU intubated, in stable condition.
She received routine induction immunsuppression, to include
solumedrol 500 mg (with subsequent protocol taper) MMF and
prograf was started on the evening of POD 0.
Routine ultrasound on POD 1 showed patent hepatic arteries and
veins and portal veins post-transplant.
The chest tube was removed on POD 1, the patient extubated and
she was able to transfer to the regular surgical floor on POD 2.
She continued the solumedrol to prednisone taper, tolerated the
mycophenylate and had daily trough prograf levels drawn with
adjustments. It was held a few days due to levels as high as 17.
The patient received several days of IV lasix to help with
volume management. Lower extremity edema was greatly improved.
Creatinine peaked at 2.8 and was trending back to normal by day
of discharge. Urine output was adequate, and responded well to
the lasix.
Home Venlaxafine and pregabalin were restarted.
The patient was evaluated by physical and occupational therapy
and they recommended rehab
