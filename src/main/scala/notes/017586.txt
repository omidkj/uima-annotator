Pertinent Results:
[**2149-8-29**] EGD
Erosions in the antrum and fundus. Likely sources of bleeding in
the setting of INR of 37.4
Erythema in the fundus compatible with gastritis

9//29/05 Echo
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
CC:[**CC Contact Info 57993**].
62 y/o male with PMH sig for Mult CVAs, (B) ICA stenosis s/p
LCEA in [**6-2**], HTN, hyperhol, Type 2 DM presented with INR of 37,
and anemia.

.
1.  UGIB.  The patient required admission to the MICU for
management of his anemia and elevated INR>  He was given 10mg IV
Vitamin K, his coumadin was held and required 10 U PRBCs for
management of his anemia.  He had melanotic stools on admission,
but did not have active bleeding and did not require emergent
EGD. He was made NPO, started on a PPI and monitored.  He was
stabilized and transferred to the floors.  Because he had leak
of his cardiac enzymes, likely secondary to ischemic demand,
cardiology was consulted to determine if EGD would be tolerated.
 Cardiology determined that he was low risk for the EGD
procedure and he underwent an EGD which showed erosions in the
antrum and fundus. Likely sources of bleeding in the setting of
INR of 37.4.  Erythema in the fundus compatible with gastritis.
Gastroenterology felt it was not contraindicated to start
aggrenox.
.
2.  Indigestion: There was a mild CK bump (150--300) with
positive troponin as high as 1.51. He remained chest pain free,
and the etiology was likely secondary to demand ischemia.
Cardiology was consulted and although he has peripheral [**Date Range 1106**]
disease, and history of CVAs and likely cardiac disease did not
feel this was ACS and he was to follow up with outpatient stress
test and possible catherization.
.
3. DM:  SSI
.
4.  Neuro sx:  Essentially, felt to be to low perfusion state
from anemia.  Head CT without new stroke or bleed.  His neuro
exam was monitored without any change or worsening from baseline
.
5. PPx: Holding anticoagulation given supertherapeutic INR
.
6. Code: FULL
.
7. Comm with pt.

Discharge Condition:
afebrile, hemodynamically stable, with stable HCT


Discharge Instructions:
Please take all medications as prescribed. Please discontinue
coumadin now. Please contact your primary care physician for an
appointment this week.  Please contact your physician or return
to the emergency department if you have chest pain, shortness of
breath, bleeding, lightheadedness, weakness or any other
worrisome symptoms

Followup Instructions:
Please contact your primary physician for an appointment this

remains stable. Please discuss with him your ongoing use of
aggrenox.

If you continue to have foot pain, contact your PCP for possible
