THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF A PREVIOUS DISCHARGE SUMMARY:

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  Pulmonary prospective:   On [**10-5**], the patient went
for a suction thrombectomy by Interventional Radiology.  An
IVC filter was placed at that time as well and a left
pulmonary artery stent was also placed.  The patient went
well under general anesthesia.  Minimal clot was aspirated
back leading to the placement of the stent and a question of
whether the embolus was tumor in origin.  A CT of the chest,
abdomen and pelvis subsequently showed that there was no
tumor, but did show multiple PE's, right greater than left,
acute on subacute pulmonary emboli. There were emboli in the
right pulmonary artery leading to the right upper lobe
pulmonary artery and the left mean pulmonary artery leading
to the left lower lobe pulmonary artery.  On [**10-9**], the
patient became increasing hypoxic and was electively
intubated.  The patient underwent bronchoscopy which was
unrevealing.  BAL cultures subsequently did not grow out
anything.  Also, on the 12th, a chest x-ray revealed a left
lower lobe infiltrate.  On the [**10-11**], the patient
became increasing hypoxic and required 100% 02 which was
slowly weaned down to FIO2 40% over the next few days.  On
[**10-16**], the patient underwent a trial of nitric oxide
without any change in her cardiac output or urine output or
her pulmonary vascular resistance.  Thus, the nitric oxide
was discontinued.  These numbers were obtained with a Swan in
place.  On [**10-19**], the patient awoke having been off
sedation for the last eight days.  This was prompted by
flumazenil injection with good response.  On [**10-22**], the
patient had a worsening of her left lower lobe infiltrate and
required increasing amounts of oxygen but stabilized on 60%
FIO2 with PEEP of 10.  On [**10-28**], the patient received a
bedside tracheostomy.

2.  Cardiovascular:  The patient received three
echocardiograms on [**10-5**], [**10-11**] and [**10-19**].  All
showed approximately the same thing, an ejection fraction of
greater than 60% with a hyperdynamic LV and RV that showed
abnormal septal motion consistent with volume or pressure
overload and [**Last Name (un) **] sign on admission, all pointing to an
acute pulmonary process.  On electrocardiogram on admission,
the patient had an S in lead I, a Q3 in the T3 which cleared
after the suction thrombectomy and stent placement.
Subsequently, the S1, Q3, T3 pattern returned with presumed
repeated PE's either breakup of the initial PE or with PE's
breaking through the IVC filter.  On [**10-9**], when the
patient was intubated, the patient became hypotensive and
required Levophed at low doses to maintain her blood
pressure.  This was due to at the time the sedation medicine
given for induction of the intubation.  On the [**10-11**], the patient became acutely hypotensive and required
three pressors, Levophed, Neo-Synephrine and vasopressin.
The patient was maxed out on all three pressors on those and
fluids, so blood pressure rose to approximately 90/40.  It is
on this day that the S1, Q3, T3 pattern returned.  The
patient was weaned off of the Neo-Synephrine on [**10-12**].
On [**10-14**], the patient was given stress dose steroids for
persistent hypotension.  On [**10-15**], a Swan-Ganz catheter
was placed to measure pressures in the pulmonary vasculature.
The objective was to maximize cardiac output and urine
output.  The Swan numbers were consistent with right heart
failure with ventricular interdependence.  Overnight on the
18th to 19th, all other remaining pressors were weaned off.
The Levophed and the vasopressin were stopped.  On [**10-15**]
through the 22, the cardiac output slowly increased each day
and the Swan was discontinued on the 22nd.  Urine output also
rose in this time.  On [**10-24**], the patient had a drop in
her blood pressure and had crackles on pulmonary exam.  A
Swan was placed at that time that showed non cardiogenic
pulmonary edema.  Levophed therapy was initiated for
hypotension.  On the 28th, the Swan was discontinued as the
pressors were discontinued and cardiac output continued to
rise.  From the 28th through the 31st, the patient has been
cardiovascularly stable.

3.  From a hematologic point of view, the patient was started
on heparin upon admission for her pulmonary embolus.  On
admission, the patient was transfused units to keep her
hematocrit greater than 27.  Also, on admission, the
patient's platelets were within the normal limits.  Over the
subsequent number of days, the patient's platelets dropped to
a nadir of 48 on [**10-16**].  Work-up was initiated prior to
this and hit antibodies came back positive for IgM.  At that
time, [**10-15**], all heparin was discontinued and a
Hematologic consult was obtained.  [**10-16**], Refludan was
started.  Platelets stabilized and eventually increased over
subsequent days.  Of note, the hematologic work-up for
hypercoagulability was limited because the patient was on
heparin and antithrombin therapy for most of her stay up to
this point.  However, anticardiolipin antibody was IgM
positive.  The patient has received multiple transfusions
with a transfusion criteria ranging from 23 to 27 depending
on the past volume status.

4.  From an Infectious Disease point of view, on [**10-9**],
the chest x-ray showed a left lower lobe infiltrate.  At that
time, ceftriaxone and Zithromax were started and cultures
were sent.  On [**10-11**], the patient had a positive urine
culture for Citrobacter pansensitive and therapy was not
adjusted.  However, on the 14th, the patient became
hypotensive as noted previously.  The antibiotics were
broadened from Ceftriaxone and Zithromax to vancomycin and
ceftazidime at that time and the patient stabilized.  The
treatment course persisted for ten days with vancomycin and
ceftazidime and these were discontinued on [**10-20**].  On
[**10-19**], Diflucan was started for a presumed urinary tract
infection.  On [**10-21**], the patient was febrile overnight
and was pancultured.  The cultures revealed yeast in the
sputum and urine.  On [**10-22**], the patient was febrile
again overnight, again was pancultured and vancomycin therapy
was initiated on [**10-23**].  Staph aureus grew out in the
sputum that was previously sent and at that time ceftazidime
was again initiated because the patient continued to be
febrile.  Blood cultures throughout this time were negative.
On [**10-25**], an Infectious Disease consult was obtained and
also on the 28th the sensitivities returned on the Staph
aureus and the sputum as methicillin resistant to Staph
aureus.  The Infectious Disease Team recommended the
discontinuation of the ceftazidime.  The discontinuation of
the Diflucan because they presumed that the yeast was a
colonizer, not a source of infection.  These antibiotics were
discontinued on the 28th.  Also, on the 28th, the patient
spike another fever.  Of note, throughout this time, numerous
line changes were made with the TIPS sent for culture and
nothing every grew out on them.  Also of note, upwards of 12
blood cultures including isolator bottles were sent and no
cultures were ever positive.  Since the 28th, the patient has
remained afebrile on monotherapy of vancomycin for the
presumed Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus
pneumonia.

5.  From an Oncologic prospective:  The patient's XRT was
held upon admission and can be resumed when the patient has
returned to outpatient life.

6.  Renal:  The patient had decreased urine output starting
on [**10-11**], the day she became hypotensive and required
three pressors to maintain her blood pressure.  On [**10-15**], urine electrolytes were consistent with prerenal and
examining the urine revealed no casts.  Thus, the belief of
the team was that her low urine output was prerenal.  On
[**10-17**], after being weaned off the pressors and
maintaining a stable blood pressure on her own, her urine
output increased and was quite good over subsequent days.  On
[**10-21**], Lasix therapy was initiated with good effect for
agitation, agitation being define
