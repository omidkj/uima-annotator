Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
[**Doctor First Name **]

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Increased lower extremity edema and change in mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This is an 84 yo female with a history of dementia, htn,
hypothyroidism, TIA ([**9-1**]) who is being transferred to the CCU
for hypotension, hypoxia, and altered mental status.  She was
initially admitted overnight on [**7-18**] to the general medicine
service.  She presented from a long term care facility with
increased confusion and new lower extremity edema.  Her
daugheter expressed that her mother had decreased appetite and
confusion over the last 10 days.  Doctors at [**Name5 (PTitle) **] nursing home
started her on Remeron.  Per her nursing facility records she
gained 10 lbs in 2 days.  Presumably for this reason she was
referred for a cardiology evaluation (appt scheduled with Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 437**] [**7-25**].)  However, she became increasingly confused and
unable to take [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
In the ED, VS: 96.4 73 123/91 18 97% on 4L. Patient agitated and
given haldol 5mg IV x 1. She also received 1mg IV ativan prior
to CT head which was negative. A CXR showed bilateral pleural
effusions L>R and moderate pulmonary edema.  ECG was read as
unchanged from prior tracing [**9-1**]. Troponin was .29, rising to
0.36. BNP was >8000.  Cardiology was consulted and felt this
troponin bump most likely attributed to heart failure rather
than ACS. Patient admitted to medicine for further work-up of
CHF.
.
Upon arrival to the floor, patient had a 4 L O2 requirement and
appeared volume overloaded.  ABG 7.44/73/32 on 4L.  She was
given 80 mg IV lasix, after which she made 700 cc urine within 1
hour.  SBP fell from baseline 140s to a low of 67.  Her mental
status continued to be arousable but drowsy.  She was given ~100
cc NS and SBP rose into the 80s.  Notably,  her respiratory
status apparently improved and O2 Sats rose to upper 90s on 4L.
.
There was suspicion for pulmonary embolism as a cause of her
hypoxia.  CT for PE could not be done secondary to poor renal
function.  Echocardiocardiogram was done to evaluate for signs
of R heart strain, and indeed demonstrated severe RV dilatation
and abnormal septal motion consistent with RV pressure/volume
overload new compared to prior echo 10/[**2127**]. PA pressures could
not be estimated.  Small pericardial effusion was also noted.
Heparin gtt without initial bolus was started for empiric
treatment of PE.
.
The patient's urine output trailed off to ~15cc/h, her SBP
remained in the 80s, and her mental status continued to be
suboptimal.  [**Hospital 75195**] transfer to the CCU was initiated for workup
of new RV dilatation, apparent R sided heart failure, further
diuresis in the setting of borderline hypotension and preload
dependence, and altered mental status.
.
On arrival to the CCU, patient was initially lethargic and could
provide only limited information.  She denied any difficulty
breathing or chest pain.  She further denied nausea or abdominal
pain.  Her only complaint is feeling extremely cold.

Social History:
Patient currently resides at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3504**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Nursing center in
[**Location (un) 538**] after being hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] for burns she
sustained on her legs 2/[**2127**].  At that time she was found to be
living in sub-optimal conditions with her daughter in a run-down
house which was poorly insulated therefore needing a lot of
space heaters that led to pts burns. Pt was also appointed a
healthcare proxy. [**Name (NI) **] current tobacco, alcohol, or IVDA. (Per
OMR)

Family History:
Per daughter: Brother with [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer in his 60s or 70s.
Sister with breast cancer in her 70s. Another sister with
thyroid cancer, ?kidney/pancreas mass. Per OMR: Her mother
"dropped dead" in her 40s/50s in front of her (sudden death).
Her sister "dropped dead" at age 23 in front of her (sudden
death).  Her father died in his 50s of unknown cause, and had a
history of arthritis.  She has 11 siblings who have died, none
suddenly or from known cardiac causes.

STUDIES:
ECG [**2129-7-18**]:
Sinus rhythm. Consider left atrial abnormality. Indeterminate
axis. There is an SI-Q3-T3 pattern. Modest right ventricular
conduction delay pattern. Delayed R wave progression with late
precordial QRS transition. Diffuse T wave abnormalities.
Findings are non-specific but clinical correlation is suggested
for possible right ventricular overload. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2128-9-19**] findings as outlined are now
present.

ECHO [**2129-7-19**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right
ventricular cavity is markedly dilated. Right ventricular
regional function cannot be assessed. There is abnormal systolic
septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitra
