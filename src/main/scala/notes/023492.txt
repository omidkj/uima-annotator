Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 1557**] is a 48 year old woman with medical history
significant for [**Location (un) **] syndrome (s/p colectomy on chronic
TPN) and recent admission for embolic CVA (paradoxical embolus)
c/b hemorrhagic conversion (fondaparinaux) presents from rehab
with new dyspnea on exertion x 2 weeks and tachycardia. The
patient was recovering at rehab after her CVA and was able to
walk with a walker with 1 assist and was improving greatly. She
began having dyspnea on exertion x 2 weeks, no SOB at rest, no
pleuritic chest pain, no cough / hemoptysis. She states she also
had pedal edema x 1 week. She had no abdominal pain, no
increased ostomy output, no blood in her ostomy, no n/v, no
change in appetite.
.
She has a significant clotting history with multiple episodes of
line associated thrombosis and paradoxical embolism due to PFO.
She had been treated with coumadin, but was stopped due to
difficult to control INR from concomitant antibiotic therapy.
She had also been treated with lovenox but this was stopped due
to skin welts. She was then treated with fondaparinaux but then
developed an ICH. Since late [**2146-9-25**] she has not been
anticoagulated given the intracranial hemorrhage.

ECG [**2146-11-24**]:
Sinus tachycardia. Incomplete right bundle-branch block.

Tracing is consistent with atrial septal defect. Since the
previous tracing
of [**2146-9-16**] there are no significant changes.

CT Head [**2146-11-25**]:
FINDINGS: There is no new acute intracranial hemorrhage or
infarction.
Hyperdensity in the right parieto-occipital lobe with
surrounding edema is
again seen and demonstrates evolution of the known
intraparenchymal
hemorrhage. However, given the four-week interval and remaining
hyperdense
attenuation centrally, interval subacute re-bleed is not
excluded. Overall,
the blood products and edema measure 6.5 x 3.7 cm compared to
9.0 x 5.4 cm
previously. There is decreased shift of the normally midline
structures
leftward, currently 6 mm compared to 15 mm previously. There is
mild mass
effect on the left posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**]. Effacement of the right
basilar cistern has
largely resolved. Hypodensities in the bifrontal lobes adjacent
to the
frontal horns is not significantly changed from prior.

There is polypoid mucosal thickening in the right maxillary
sinus. The
remainder of the visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air
cells are well

aerated. No osseous abnormality is identified.

IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of new hemorrhage.

2. Evolution of known right parieto-occipital intraparenchymal
hemorrhage
with overall decreased size and mass effect.

[**2146-11-25**] 8:00 pm (after heparin drip started)
FINDINGS: A non-contrast CT of the head was obtained. The
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation is preserved. Again noted is a large right
parietooccipital
lobe hemorrhage with a clear acute component and surrounding
edema measuring
3.5 x 5.8 cm. There is mild mass effect on the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of
the right
lateral ventricle and stable 6 mm of r
