[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
45 year old woman with history of Asthma, Crohn's presenting
with respiratory distress found to have severe stridor now s/p
intubation.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate for airway abnormalities, causes of swelling, in
patient with severe stridor
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 45-year-old woman with a history of asthma and
Crohn's disease. Now with stridor and intubated.

COMPARISON: None.

TECHNIQUE: Contrast-enhanced CT of the neck.

FINDINGS: Note is made of an endotracheal tube, nasogastric
tube, and a left subclavian central venous catheter.

The soft tissues of the neck appear unremarkable. There is no
drainable fluid collection, pathologically enlarged lymph nodes,
or other mass. The airway demonstrates no significant narrowing,
although the study is limited by the presence of the
endotracheal tube. The vocal cords do not appear markedly
swollen.

The lung apices demonstrate minimal scarring.

The paranasal sinuses demonstrate mucosal thickening in multiple
ethmoid air cells as well as the right maxillary sinus, likely
related at least in part to the intubation.

IMPRESSION: No extrinsic mass or fluid collection in the neck.

Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2113-6-28**]
obtained at 13:14 p.m.

The ET tube tip terminates 2.5 cm above the carina. The left
subclavian line tip terminates in mid SVC. The NG tube tip
passes below the diaphragm most likely terminating into the
stomach. The heart size and mediastinal contours are
unremarkable and the lungs are essentially clear with no
sizeable pleural effusion identified.

PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST, 1:14 p.m., [**6-28**]

INDICATION: Respiratory distress. Evaluate for pneumonia.

FINDINGS: No prior comparisons. The heart is not enlarged. No
CHF. The left subclavian Port-A-Cath tip is at the level of the
brachiocephalic/SVC confluence.

No definite pulmonary infiltrates or sizable effusions. There is
the suggestion of some prominence/indistinctness of the markings
at the right lung base medially, which may just be due to
overlying soft tissues, but if there is a clinical suspicion of
early pneumonia, then followup PA and lateral views may be
helpful to further evaluate this. No other suspicious areas for
pneumonia.

There is a tiny roughly 5-mm nodule density projecting just
lateral to the cardiac apex, which is indeterminate for
confluence of markings versus a small nodule/granuloma or
possibly a bone island. Attention to this on followup studies,
or comparison with prior old films or reports recommended.


Brief Hospital Course:
Acute Respiratory failure - intubation for airway protection.
Etiology thought to be vocal cord dysfunction given that stridor
stopped abruptly after intubation, no wheezing aon exam and very
low peak airway pressures were noted. Neck CT showed no
pathology to account for stridor. On discussion with the ICU
attending, Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2168**] - vocal cords were normal in apprearance.
She was treated with empiric coverage with Levofloxacin for a 5
day course (last day [**2113-7-2**]), prednisone taper, nebs. PPI was
given in [**Hospital1 **] dosing given that GERD can worsen vocal cord
dysfunction. The patient will benefit from psychiatry follow up
for anxiety and vocal cord dysfunction (relaxation techniques).
She is also advised to discuss with PCP for an ENT referral.
Given above reasons, this was unlikely to be an asthma
exacerbation. But given the severity of the situation, she was
treated with above.

*** A repeat Chest XRY is recommended to evaluate the findings
above and also consider CT chest if the pleural effusion
persists/to follow up the nodule.

She should continue to follow up with her GI physicians at [**Hospital1 18**]
for management of Cr
