History of Present Illness:
HPI:76 year old female transferred from OSH with large left IPH
with intraventricular extension on the left. The patient was
intubated at the OSH and reportedly moving her left side when
she
arrived to our ED. Per OSH records the patient was at her PCP's
office and had unsteady gait. She was sent to [**Hospital **] Hospital
where she was found to be slumped over in a chair. Her head CT
at
the OSH revealed the IPH, IVH so she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for
neurosurgery evaluation.

CTA Head [**11-21**] IMPRESSION:
1. Massive hemorrhage in the left frontal and left lateral
ventricles,
essentially unchanged from the prior study.

2. AVM identified in the left frontal lobe, with prominent
draining veins.
The source of arterial supply is unclear. There is no intranidal
aneurysm
seen. Please refer to the report of the conventional
angiography, as it is
more sensitive in detecting small aneurysms.

CTA Head [**11-23**] IMPRESSION:
1. No significant change in the appearance of intracranial
hemorrhage. No
new areas of hemorrhage or hydrocephalus seen.
2. Arteriovenous malformation is seen in the inferior frontal
lobe region is identified on the previous cerebral angiography
and CTA examinations. No vasospasm identified.

CXR [**11-26**]:
Compared to the prior chest radiograph there is no significant
change in the position of the ET tube tip which is approximately
4 cm above the carina. The left subclavian line tip is in mid
SVC. There is no change in the mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema,
bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.

CT Head [**11-26**]
IMPRESSION: Similar appearance of the large left frontal
parenchymal
hemorrhage, with similar extent into the left lateral ventricle,
resolved.
Blood products from the right lateral ventricle and fourth
ventricle and small amount of the blood extending into the third
ventricle, improved from prior study. Extensive sinus disease,
including mucosal thickening in the ethmoid air cells, levels in
the frontal sinuses, and mucosal thickening in the left greater
than right maxillary sinuses and sphenoid sinus.

CT Head [**11-28**]:
IMPRESSION: Slight improvement in the left intraventricular
hemorrhage.
Essentially unchanged left frontal lobe parenchymal hemorrhage,
with
persistent rightward shift of normally-midline structures.
Interval
endovascular coiling of known left frontal AVM.

CXR [**12-1**]:
IMPRESSION: Interval improvement in bilateral pleural effusions
and now mild pulmonary edema. Left perihilar opacity likely due
to atelectasis, pneumonia not excluded.

Final Report
HISTORY: Abdominal distension, and question of ileus.

FINDINGS: Single frontal and single lateral decubitus
radiographs of the
abdomen are interpreted in comparison with abdominal radiographs
from [**12-8**], [**2152**]. There is no free gas or pneumatosis. Again seen are
air- filled
loops of colon, without dilation. The prominence of previously
described air-
filled loops of small bowel is now decreased. Catheter at the
right upper
quadrant is unchanged in location. Gastrostomy tube is also
unchanged. Limited
views of the lung bases are better assessed on the recent chest
radiographs.
Visualized osseous structures are notable for a dextroconvex
curvature with
associated lumbar spinal degenerative changes. There are no soft
tissue
calcifications.

IMPRESSION: Non-obstructive bowel-gas pattern.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Final Report
HISTORY: Pleural effusion.

Single portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval
placement of a
ventriculoperitoneal shunt when compared with [**2153-12-1**]. The
visualized
portions of the catheter demonstrate no kinking or
discontinuity. The
remaining support lines are unchanged. Again seen are bilateral
pleural
effusions and bibasilar atelectasis. Shift of the trachea from
the midline to
the right remains unchanged. Mild pulmonary edema persists.
Pneumonia is
again not excluded.




Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the neurosurgery service in SICU for
unsteady gait and lethargy. A Head CT showed a left inter
parenchymal hemorrhage 2x2x1.5 cm with interventricular
extension.  She had an EVD placed on [**11-21**].  Her exam on [**11-22**]
showed no eye opening, PERRL, right upper extremity withdraws to
noxious stimuli, intermittently follows commands with left upper
extremity, facial grimmace to noxious. She withdrew lower
extremities to nox(L>R). Hct 40-31, but stable when repeated.
ICP's [**6-27**]. On [**11-23**] the patient was intubated due to
respiratory distress with a rate in the 30s. She also was more
somnolent that day. A stat head CT was unchanged. The CTA showed
no spasm, stable from prior. On [**11-24**] Lenis were negative for
DVT.

Her exam remained unchanged for several days. On [**11-28**] she had a
trach/peg placed.
She also had an embolization of her AVM that day. Head CT was
stable. The following day she was following commands. She
completed her nimodipine on [**11-30**]. Her EVD was clamped but she
was unable to tolerate this. With her EVD re-opened she was
doing well neurologically and was transferred to the stepdown
unit on [**12-1**]. Her exam was improving.

On [**12-4**] the patient was oriented x2 (self/ place). Cultures
showed Serratia in sputum, and she was placed on cipro. The
patient had a VP shunt placed on [**12-7**] due to inability to
tolerate the EVD being clamped. The procedure went well with no
complications.

On [**12-11**] we continued working toward discharge to an extended
care facility, when she reportedly became mildly hypoxemic, she
reportedly dropped her O2 sat to the low 90s (or even 90%) on
35% trach mask, requiring an increase in her oxygen requirement
to 50% trach mask on the evening of [**12-11**]. She received a total
of 40 mg of IV furosemide,
