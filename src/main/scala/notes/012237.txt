Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
77M w hx/o CAD s/p stent, diverticulosis, duodenal stricture,
perforated appendicitis in [**2117**] who was transferred from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital where he p/w 2-3 days worsening LLQ abdominal
pain associated with vomiting x 1 day.  Denies diarrhea,
hematemesis, hematochezia, melena.  Endorses constipation
(cannot remember last BM), decreased flatus x days.  Also denies
fever, chills.
.
At OSH, pt was found to have elevated lipase & CT torso
revealing celiac stenosis.  Found to be hypoxic to 81% on RA,
complaining of SOB.  Improved to 90% on 2L.  Pt has a history of
SOB x 2-3 years; states that he can only walk approximately [**Age over 90 **]
yards before being limited by SOB.  No orthopnea, PND, LE
swelling.  Pt received 1L IVF at OSH.
.
Vital signs in [**Hospital1 18**] ED: 99.6 100 157/68 16 90% 2L (97 on 6L)
.
Pt noted to be somnolent in ED; ABG showed:
7.18/85/75/33 which subsequently worsened to 7.16/95/105/36 on
O2.
.
The patient was started on BiPap; repeat ABG in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]:
7.24/79/67/36
.
Initial labs here also significant for lipase 379, no other LFT
abnormalities. His OSH CT chest was negative for PE but CT
abdomen revealed critical stenosis of celiac artery.  As such,
vascular was consulted. They did not feel there was any acute
intervention that needed to take place given normal lactate &
resolution of pain.

CXR ([**2126-4-7**]):
FINDINGS: There is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature with
mild
cephalization. Additionally, there are bilateral increased
interstitial
markings. These findings are suggestive of mild pulmonary edema.

Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. No acute fractures are
identified.

IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary edema.

RUQ U/S ([**2126-4-9**]):
FINDINGS: The liver demonstrates normal echotexture. No focal
hepatic
lesions are seen. Portal venous flow is hepatopetal. Patient is
status post cholecystectomy. Spleen is within normal limits in
size.

There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
The CBD
measures 3 mm in size. Pancreas is not well visualized.

The right kidney measures 12 cm in size and the left kidney
measures 9.0 cm in size. There is a well-defined hyperechoic
focus measuring about 4 mm in size within the left mid kidney
likely representing a small angiomyolipoma. No free fluid is
seen in the abdomen.

IMPRESSION: Status post cholecystectomy.
No evidence of intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal
dilatation. No obvious choledocholithiasis identified.


Brief Hospital Course:
REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION:
77 M hx/o CAD s/p stent, diverticulosis, ccy, appy presents to
OSH wiht LLQ pain, elevated lipase, found to be hypoxic now with
hypercarbia.

ACUTE DIAGNOSES:

# Acute on Chronic Respiratory Acidosis: Pt with primarily
hypercarbic respiratory failure of unclear etiology.  Given his
smoking history, there was an initial concern that he may have
COPD, but his CT chest was unremarkable. He most likely has
Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome vs. Obstructive Sleep Apnea.
His CT PA was negative for PE, pneumonia. It was initially put
on BiPap on the floor but his CO2 did not decrease below 60s,
which is likely his baseline PCO2.  It was recommended that he
undergo outpatient PFTs as well as a formal sleep study.
.
# Pancreatitis: Lipase elevated to 300s on admission to [**Hospital1 18**]
from 800 at OSH.  No other LFT abnormalities.  Pt is s/p
cholecystectomy roughly one year ago.  Initially, pt endorsed
drinking [**1-25**] hard alcoholic beverages nightly, but this was
contested by his significant other.  Alcohol was thought to be
potential contributing factor to this flare of pancreatitis.  On
review of his abdominal CT, a mass was noted in the head of the
pancreas which was thought to represent cyst vs. pseudocyst vs.
possible tumor.  It was recommended that he undergo MRCP as an
oupatient.  His RUQ ultrasound was unremarkable and he was
tolerating a normal diet without recurrence in his abdominal
pain at the time of discharge.

# Severe Celiac Artery Stenosis:  The patient CT abdomen
revealed severe stenosis of the celiac artery.  Lactate was
trended serially and was not elevated.  The patient denied a
history of food aversion and weight loss. Vascular surgery
evaluated the patient and did not believe that any acute
intervention was needed.  The patient's abdominal pain was
attributed to pancreatitis.

CHRONIC DIAGNOSES:

# HTN: Lisinopril was initially held in the setting of
pancreatitis.  It was resumed on discharge.  His dose was
decreased from 80 mg to 40 mg (max dose).

# HLD: The patient's simvastatin was decreased from 80 mg to 40
mg QD.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:

# Pancreatic Mass: This will need to be followed with MRCP as an
outpatient.

# L Renal Mass: This should be followed and reimaged on an
outpatient basis.

# Code Status: Full code (confirmed with patient)

Medications on Admission:
-Aspirin 81mg
-Lisinopril 80 mg QD
-Nifedi
