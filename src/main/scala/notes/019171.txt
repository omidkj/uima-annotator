Brief Hospital Course:
DKA - Pt received a head CT in the ED which was negative. She
was admitted to ICU and treated for DKA with insulin.  She was
transferred to the Internal Medicine Floor where her blood
sugars were monitored on lantus and SSI.  A trial of metformin
was attempted but this did not provide adequate blood sugar
control, so it was determined that the patient would require
home insulin to manage her diabetes.  She was discharged on a
insulin glargine 16 units subcutaneously at bedtime and insulin
aspart as directed with meals.

PNA - pt was complaining of abdominal pain in RLQ so a CT
abdomen/pelvis was done to rule out appendicitis or
diverticulitis.  CT found small LLL consolidation, and with h/o
URI symptoms, patient was treated empirically for CAP with
levofloxacin for 5 days.  An underlying lung mass could not be
excluded based on the CT findings, so a follow up CXR is
recommended in [**5-8**] weeks to be followed up with PCP.

ABD PAIN - pt c/o abdominal pain throughout admission. She
admits this pain has been chronic for several months.  It was
migratory along the RLQ, right flank, and RUQ on various
occasions.  It was thought there was a musculoskeletal
component, as pt had significant point tenderness on exam and
had a history of falling.  She had multiple studies to evaluate
the pain.  A series of lumbar plain films and a dedicated rib
study were done to evaluate for fracture.  These were both
negative.  Additionally, the CT abdomen/pelvis did not show any
evidence of an acute process; however, a calcified uterine
fibroid was seen on CT that could be contributing to the
patient's pain. It was recommended that the pt follow up with
her PCP to evaluate the utility of working up the fibroid and/or
pursuing treatment.

HTN - pt's blood pressure meds were held for most of her visit
because she was normotensive.  Her home meds were restarted at
lower doses around discharge with plans to have the rehab
facility titrate up as needed.

Tachycardia - pt was consistently tachycardic throughout
admission but this resolved when she resumed propranolol.

diarrhea - pt has been complaining of diarrhea and has had a
negative work up.  Stool ova, parasites, and C.Diff were
negative.  recommend follow up with PCP if patient would like
further evaluation

[**Name (NI) 2091**] - pt's renal function worsened during admission but improved
over her reported baseline of Cr 1.4 to Cr 1.2 by the end of
admission

diastolic heart failure - home meds were held during admission.
lasix restarted at half the dose when patient discharged with
plan to titrate up as needed in rehab
