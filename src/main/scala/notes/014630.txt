Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3705**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status, hypothermia, dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2118-5-16**] Intubation
[**2118-5-17**] Extubation
[**2118-5-16**] R IJ central venous line placement


History of Present Illness:
73yo M with h/o COPD, CHF, HTN, is brought to the hospital for
change in mental status. Patient was en route to his pulmonary
follow up appointment when he was found by the transporters to
be confused with oxygen saturation of 85% on RA.  The
transportation service brought him directly to the Emergency
Department.
.
In the Emergency Department, patient was minimally responsive
wtih initial vitals of T 98.2 HR 80 BP 164/68 RR 18 SPO2 100% on
15L .  He was given a trial of Narcan to which he did not
respond.  He was not protecting airway and was subsequently
intubated w/o difficulty.  After intubation he had repeated
episodes of hypotension requiring 2L IVF, CVL placement, and
dopamine. ABGs show hypercarbic respiratory failure. CT Head w/o
acute change. Broad spectrum antibiotics (ceftriaxone, unasyn,
and vancomycin) were started for possible infection in setting
of hypotension.
.
He was transferred to the ICU where the dopamine was weaned off.
He was treated empirically for COPD exacerbation with solumedrol
and levaquin. Patient was able to be extubated the following day
and was transferred to the floor. He is currently on his home
oxygen requirement (2L NC).
.
On arrival to floor patient denies any complaints.  States he
feels well and would like to go home.  His mildly labored
respirations are reportedly "better than his normal".  He denies
any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, chills,
or chest pain.  He is unable to recall the events leading to his
admission.  He denies recent illness or changes in medications.
He denies any history of similar presentations.

IMAGING:
[**5-16**] Port CXR:
Endotracheal tube is in place, tip just below the thoracic
inlet, roughly 7 cm above the carina. Cardiomediastinal contours
are unchanged allowing for portable supine technique. Irregular
densities throughout the right hemithorax consistent with
parenchymal calcifications related to prior granulomatous
infection are not significantly changed. There is no new
airspace opacity. There is no definite pleural effusion, though
the left CP angle is excluded. There is no pneumothorax.
Multiple old healed rib fractures are stable bilaterally.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
.
[**5-16**] CT head w/o contrast: wet read
No acute hemorrhage. Stable lacunar infarcts. Mucosal thickening
and soft tissue in the left maxillary sinus, likely infectious.

MRI is more sensitive for acute infarcts.
.
[**5-16**] CTA Chest/Abd/Pelvis: wet read
No PE. Mucous plugging with associated volume loss of right
lower lobe. No colitis. Circumferential thickening of bladder
wall--could be due to underdistention or acute/acute on chronic
cystitis; correlate with UA.
.
[**2118-5-17**] EEG: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG
recording due to the slow background suggestive of a moderate to
severe encephalopathy. Medications, metabolic disturbances, and
infection are among the most common causes. There were no
lateralized or epileptiform features seen in this recording.
.
[**2118-5-19**] CXR: The ET tube tip was removed as well as the NG tube
and the right internal jugular line. Cardiomediastinal
silhouette is stable. The lungs are significantly hyperinflated
due to severe emphysema but overall there is improved aeration
of the lung bases. Bilateral old rib fractures are noted.  There
is no interval development of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 75 M w/ pmh of COPD on home O2, presents
en-route to pulmonary appointment w/ hypercarbic respiratory
failure.

#. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Unclear precipitant, i.e,
did altered mental status cause hypercarbia or did hypercarbia
cause altered mental status? Patient is on depakote and
