Esophagus
[**2119-3-21**]: FINDINGS: Barium flowed freely throughout the
esophagus without evidence of stricture, lesion or leak,
especially around the anastomotic site. Barium was able to pass
freely from the esophagus into the stomach, from the stomach
into the small intestine, the path of the barium was noted to be
narrowed consistent with postoperative inflammation/edema.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of leak; narrowed channel from stomach
into small
bowel consistent with postoperative inflammation/edema.
