Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
altered mental status, hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right-sided thoracentesis [**5-20**]

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]yo F with a PMH of SDH s/p burr hole evacuation [**2199-4-14**], recent
STEMI and medical management [**2199-4-17**], and multiple UTIs, now
presents with CHF, fevers, and altered mental status. Ms.
[**Known lastname 4402**] was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2199-4-30**] after a 4d
hospitalization for altered mental status, felt to possibly be
due to UTI and/or pneumonia (treated with levaquin) and
benzodiazepine usage (ativan). Since discharge, she has been at
[**Hospital 100**] Rehab. She had been on her baseline O2 requirement of 2L
by nc, but over the last week, was noted to have increased O2
need and crackles on exam. Attempts were made to diurese her
with 40mg IV lasix daily. A foley catheter was placed on [**2199-5-14**]
for better I/O monitoring. After 3 days (which was 3 days prior
to admission), she was noted to begin having mental status
changes. Her family described her as being "wacky" and she had a
fall (to her knees, no head trauma) on [**2199-5-17**]. On [**2199-5-18**], she
continued to be disoriented and confused. She also began to drop
her O2 sats again despite the diuresis, with O2 sats dropping to
the low 90s. Her oxygen requirement was increased to 3L by nc
with improvement in her sats. A UA was checked and was
suspicious for a UTI, so she was started on levofloxacin. On the
morning of [**2199-5-19**], she again became hypoxic with O2 sats in the
80s which improved to the high 90s on a NRB. She continued to be
delirious and confused, so she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further evaluation. In speaking to her RN at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, the
patient was noted to have lost 6 lbs in the last week (wt of 131
-> 125 lbs) with diuresis and there was a concern that she was
becoming dry. She was also noted to have elevated fingersticks
on [**2199-5-18**], with a FS of 470 (she is NOT a diabetic). With her
delirium, she was not sleeping and was noted to have NOT slept
in the last 48 hrs, which was unusual for her. She had been on a
1:1 sitter because she was attempting to get OOB on her own and
was pulling at lines (foley, IV). [**Name6 (MD) **] her RN, the patient had
been afebrile. She had NOT been on O2 prior to her MI, but has
been on 2L of O2 since the beginning of [**4-20**].
.
In the ED, her VS were noted to be T 102.4, HR 100s, BP 138/82,
RR 28, sats 100% on NRB, 89-91% on RA. She was given 500cc NS in
ER, then 40mg IV lasix (once her CXR returned). She had 250cc
UOP in the ER. FS was 91. CT head was performed and showed
resolution of her SDH. Given that her D-dimer was elevated, a
CTA was performed and was negative for PE, but did show a large
R sided pleural effusion and left atrial clot. She spiked a
fever, so was given PR tylenol and levaquin IV. Her troponin
also returned elevated at 0.20 and she was given a rectal dose
of aspirin. She was admitted to the ICU for further monitoring
of her respiratory and mental status.

IMAGING:
ECHO [**2199-4-18**]: The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (ejection
fraction 30-40 percent) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the
inferior, posterior, and lateral walls. There is no ventricular
septal defect. The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied.
The right ventricular cavity
is dilated. Right ventricular systolic function appears
depressed (apical half of free wall). The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The supporting structures of the tricuspid
valve are thickened/fibrotic. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial vs. physiologic
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: inferoposterolateral myocardial infarct
.
TTE [**2199-5-20**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
inferolateral hypokinesis/ akinesis. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed. The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated and there is probable right ventricular
hypertrophy. Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
