Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2763**]
Chief Complaint:
fell

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Reason for MICU transfer:  hypoxia

History of Present Illness:  85 yo F w/ poor pulmonary function
on 5L NC at baseline (up to 9 L if exercising).  The patient
reports that she went to her PCP yesterday morning for routine
f/u.  She was c/o feeling weak/low energy and he wanted to check
U/A, but she was unable to urinate.  He did check routine labs
and told her she was anemic and to increase her Fe supplement.
They also discussed stopping her coumadin, but wanted to speak
with her pulmonologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] first.

She went home and was generally feeling weak with low energy.
She then had a bout of loose stool, nonbloody but high volume in
the afternoon.  Denies any associated n/v/f/c/abd pain.  States
has had periodic diarrhea, last episode Monday, but prior to
that had been several weeks.  She then had a poor appetite for
the rest of the day and maybe ate one [**Location (un) 6002**] all day.  In the
early morning around 4 am she got up to go the the bathroom and
on the way back to her bed felt her legs give out and fell to
the floor.  No preceeding dizziness, n, chest pain, palps.  No
LOC. Possible head strike but remembers the whole thing.  Does
feel some pain in back of neck and right arm as a result.
Regarding her breathing, she feels it has been gradually
worsening lately.
Her only recent medication changes here a decrease in her
prednisone from 20 to 15 mg in [**Month (only) 547**].  She also had a UTI about
1 month ago.  Initially treated with Cipro, but came back as a
resistant organism and was changed to another abx - ? macrobid
per her daughter.

On Arrival to the ED, VS were 88 148/80 16 87% 6L.  She
triggered for hypoxia, had a negative trauma fast.  She was put
on a non-rebreather with sats in the 90s, she was then
transitioned off and was 87% on 6L NC.  A CXR showed severe
pulmonary fibrosis, but no clear infiltrate or edema.  NCHCT
unremarkable and CT C spine showed multilevel DJD. ECG not
changed from baseline, reportedly guaiac neg.  VBG was
7.32/65/35/35.  Labs showed baseline anemia at 29, [**Last Name (un) **] with Cr
1.4 from baseline of 1.0, [**Last Name (un) 263**] 2.3, neg trop.  She was given 500
CC NS.  She was admitted to the MICU for further evaluation of
her hypoxia. Vitals on transfer were 82, 98% on 6L NC. Drops to
60s on 5L.

On arrival to the MICU, patient reports she is feeling slightly
better, but her breathing not quite at baseline.  She also feels
some discomfort from skin tears on her arms and right chest
wall.

Brief Hospital Course:
85 yo F with severe pulmonary fibrosis on 5 L O2 at home who
presents with presyncope and increased hypoxia, likely related
to dehydration in setting of diarrhea

# mechanical fall/dehydration: patient was brought into the
hospital with presyncope and a mechanical fall after diarrhea,
fall was likely related to dehydration and presyncope. She was
treated with IV fluids and given high flow oxygen per her usual
requirements due to IPF.  She was found to have E. Coli UTI with
frequency and urgency that was treated with PO antibiotics which
may have also contributed to weakness that led to her mechanical
fall.  She was evaluated by physical therapy and found to be in
need of wheelchair for mobility and of 24 hour care.  The
patient was discharged to rehab.

# Interstitial pulmonary disease/Hypoxia:  She was kept in the
ICU because of her desaturations into the 80s and high 70s while
speaking due to her underlying and progressive pulmonary
fibrosis.  She was kept on her home O2 and occasionally required
increasing amounts of O2 by nasal cannula and high flow oxygen
for symptom control.  She stayed in the ICU throughout her
admission due to desaturations with eating, talking and other
activity however the patient remained awake and conversant
throughout and other vital signs were stable.  Prednisone
continued at 15 mg daily during admission and weaned to 10 mg
daily on discharge, bactrim continued for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].

# UTI:  Ucx grew E. coli sensitive to ceftriaxone.  Patient
transitioned to PO cefpodoxime for 7 day course, to finish on
[**2193-7-21**].

# [**Last Name (un) **]: Most like prerenal in setting of dehydration from poor PO
intake and diarrhea.  Improved with IV fluids.  Cr returned to
baseline on discharge.

# anemia: Currently at baseline.  no s/s of bleeding.  Fe
supplementation continued and pt was started on B12
supplementation as well.

# Hx PE/DVT on coumadin:  Now 6 months out from diagnosis of PE,
discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] (pulmonary) and agreed with
discontinuing coumadin.

# DM2: Metformin held while in house with sliding scale insulin
for blood sugar controlled.  Restarted metformin on discharge.

# CAD: continued ASA, metoprolol, simvastatin

# depression: continued lexapro, mirtazepine

Transitional Issues:
# Code status: patient was DNR/DNI during this admission
# Patient requires 4-5 liters of oxygen at baseline and
desaturates with activity including eating, working with
physical therapy and talking related to her interstitial
pulmonary disease.  Other vital signs remain stable when this
occurs and there are no further interventions for her pulmonary
disease.
# Cefpodoxime course ends on [**2193-7-21**] for UTI treatment
