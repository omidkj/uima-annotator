Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
New A-fib with RVR


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
electrical cardioversion

History of Present Illness:
77 yo M with dCHF (Grade II), severe AS (0.8-1.0cm2), HTN, HL,
diet controlled DM, PVD s/p Left axillary bifemoral bypass
[**2189-8-28**] and  s/p left fem-pt bypass w/ ISSV [**2184**] presents with
a-fib /w RVR. The patient was last admitted on [**9-10**] here at
[**Hospital1 18**] for infected left groin s/p axillary [**Hospital1 **]-femoral bypass. He
underwent debridement and closure with vac. His wound grew MSSA
and was to complete 6 months of treatment with Dicloxacillin. He
was doing well until he reported DOE, improving with rest, one
week prior. He was admitted to [**Hospital3 1443**] Hospital on
[**2192-12-14**] for his DOE and found to be in ARF and hyperkalemic
with a creatinine of 3 per report. The ARF was thought to be a
delayed reaction to Dicloxaxcillin, which was d/c and he was
started on prednisone, presumably for AIN. He was also found to
be anemic and was transfused 4U pRBC. The patient's symtpoms
improved and was discharged home.

The patient reports feeling palpiations on Friday evening that
resolved on its own. He denied any prior history of palpitations
or chest pain. This morning around 8am the patient was again
SOB, felt palpitations and left sided chest tightness, [**5-17**], no
radiation. His SOB did not improve with rest as previously and
presented to the [**Hospital1 18**].

In the ED, initial vitals were 97.6 55 105/56 22 100%RA. Upon
further evaluation of the ED staff he was found to be in a-fib
w/ RVR with rates 110-140's (no prior history). Given his
history of severe AS they did not want to push IV nodal agents
and was started on an esmolol gtt. He was also given 0.25mg IV
Digoxin. His labs were remarkable for Trop 0.33, CK 295, MB: 19,
MBI: 6.4. Creatinine 2.1, Bicarb 16, Na; 130, Glucose: 381, WBC:
14.8, UA positive, but [**11-27**] epi, lactate 1.4. CXR did not show
pulmonary edema or consolidation. The patient was started on a
heparin gtt with a 2000U bolus (guaiac negative). The patient
had already taken ASA 325mg at home and was not loaded for
plavix given patient high likelihood to need surgery given
severe AS and severe PVD. He was also given 1.25L IVF. [**Month/Year (2) **]
surgery was consulted in the ED. He also had LENI prior to
arrive to the CCU that showed no DVT and a right thigh hematoma
5.5x2.8 cm.

In the CCU the patient denied CP, SOB and only minimal
palpitations. He did not feel light-headed or dizzy. Patient SBP
declined to SBP 80's with rates in the 120's. Pt was asx and
given 500cc IVF bolus and additional digoxin 0.25mg x1. His
esmolol was d/c and BP improved to SBP 95 (MAPS 70's).
Anesthesia was called in anticipation of cardioversion.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, syncope or
presyncope.

Imaging:
[**2189-12-20**]: EKG
Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Right
bundle-branch
block. Right axis deviation. Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing atrial fibrillation is new.

[**2189-12-20**]: CXR
The patient is slightly rotated to the left. The lungs appear
clear bilaterally with no areas of focal consolidation. Minimal
left basilar atelectasis is noted. There is no pneumothorax or
pleural effusion. Though the heart size appears slightly larger
than on the prior study, the patient is slightly rotated and
lung volumes are lower than on the prior study. The aorta
remains tortuous with calcification but stable. There are no
overt signs of fluid overload. Tubing is noted overlying the
epigastrium, most likely external to the patient. Degenerative
changes of the thoracic spine are noted, not well evaluated.
IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.

[**2099-12-19**]: Doppler lower extremity
1. No evidence of bilateral lower extremity DVT.
2. Likely right thigh hematoma as described above.

[**2189-12-21**]: Echo
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
di
