History of Present Illness:
85 year-old man with history of dementia and atrial fibrillation
on coumadin. He is a nursing home resident and, at baseline, is
non-verbal and unable to follow any commands. He was noted to be
more lethargic earlier today, according to his son, he seemed
weak but was able to smile appropriately. At that time, the son
did not note any thing focal such as a facial droop or
unilateral weakness. He noted that the patient seemed too weak
to eat, and had not eaten anything all day.
.
Because of this patient was taken to [**Hospital3 **]. En route,
he developed rapid afib and became unresponsive. Records do not
show any hemodynamic instability. On arrival to [**Hospital3 **]
there was some question of facial droop. This, according to the
son, is based on what the patient's daughter saw. The son feels
that the facial droop is questionable, having seen the patient
at the same time.
.
There is also report that the patient may have had abdominal
tenderness. Additionally, there is report that the patient may
have had some slurred speech at the OSH, but the patient is
noted to be non-verbal for years now according to multiple
family members.
.
A Head and Neck CT was done at the OSH and was reported as
non-acute. A Chem 10 revealed Na level of 157 and the patient's
UA was positive for bacteria. An INR returned 6.1.
.
The patient was transferred here to [**Hospital1 18**] where he was
reintubated with succinocholine, but no sedation. He has been
off sedation since arrival and has been noted to be breathing
over the ventilator, and slowly waking up in that he is now
bucking the vent.
.
MICU course: CT scanning was notable for possible RLL pneumonia.
Head CT negative. Laboratories notable for hypernatremia and
supratherapeutic INR. On arrival the patient was febrile was
extremely somnolent and only minimally responsive to pain
despite no sedating medications. He had occasional episodes of
atrial fibrillation with RVR but no associated hypotension.
Initial ABG revealed normal oxygenation and ventilation and the
patient was quickly weaned from assist control to SBT, extubated
by the following day. In the meantime, broad spectrum Vancomycin
and Zosyn were started. The hypernatremia was treated with free
water intravenously and by NG tube. The patient also underwent
bronchoscopy which revealed increased secretions and occasional
blood. The patient's mental status improved and fever resolved.
The patient did well status post extubation. Two species E. coli
grew from the patient's urine culture, sensitive to Zosyn.
Neurology, who had seen the patient in the ED, believed the
mental decline was related to toxic-metabolic etiology and
recommended no further studies.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2107-6-14**]
IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. Mucosal
thickening within the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses as well as
small air-fluid level within the sphenoid sinus, likely
reflecting acute-on-chronic sinus disease.
.
CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECON Study Date of [**2107-6-14**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Right lower lobe consolidation.
2. Multiple subcentimeter hypodensities within the liver, too
small to characterize.
3. No evidence of abdominal aortic dissection.
4. No evidence of bowel obstruction. Mild stenosis of the common
origin of the celiac and superior mesenteric artery. The celiac,
SMA, and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] are opacified. Question intermittent mesenteric
ischemia as source of abdominal pain.
.
ECG Study Date of [**2107-6-14**] 5:32:02 AM
Most likely atrial fibrillation with moderate ventricular
response. There are intermittent right bundle-branch block
pattern that may be rate related. Probable inferior wall
myocardial ischemia. No previous tracing for comparision.
.
ECHO Study Date of [**2107-6-15**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-28**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2107-6-15**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged bibasilar consolidation right greater than left
differential includes infection, atelectasis, or aspiration.
2. Stable multiple subcentimeter too small to characterize
hypodensities within the liver.
3. Large amount of retained fecal debris within the rectum with
irregular thickening of the distal rectum, correlation with
digital rectal examination and/or sigmoidoscopy is recommended.

Brief Hospital Course:
85 year-old gentleman with atrial fibrillation on coumadin,
dementia, baseline non-verbal who presents from OSH with mental
status decline likely due to pneumonia, UTI, and hypernatremia.
Patient intubated for respiratory failure and is now status post
extubation [**2107-6-15**].
