Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9965**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
71F with RA/CREST on prednisone, possible COPD and recent workup
for possible lung neoplasm who presents with 2 days of worsening
dyspnea and cough productive of yellow sputum. The patient was
in her USOH including being able to walk across the room without
becoming SOB or stopping until approx. 2 days ago. She reports
progressive dyspnea on exertion and now dyspnea at rest over the
last 2 days. She is now unable to walk across the room without
becoming SOB. She has also had a chronic cough for the last
thirty years that is usually non-productive but has become
productive of thick yellow sputum over the last 2 days. Denies
hemoptysis. Denies fevers or chills at home. She denies CP, N/V,
dysuria, urgency, frequency, HA, neck stiffness. No sick
contacts. She received the influenza vaccine this year. She
endorses a 10lb unintentional weight loss over the last month
[**1-25**] poor appetite. She also endorses severe back pain that has
been progressive over the last 3-4 weeks and was initially
intermittent but is now constant. The pain is pleuritic in
nature. She denies a h/o falls or trauma to the back. She has
had back pain in the past but nothing similar to this. She
denies other bony pain besides in the back. She endorses night
sweats for the last ten days or so. She also has intermittent
colitis flares, and has had one recently with no abdominal pain
but [**3-28**] watery or loose BMs/day. She denies melena or
hematochezia. She underwent colonoscopy in [**2169-4-23**] and reports
that polyps removed had no evidence of cancer on pathology.
.
Regarding the patient's RLL mass, it was incidentally discovered
on a CXR in [**2169-7-24**] after her chronic cough of 30 years
intensified this summer. Her outside pulmonologist recommended
CT scan and on CT there was a peripherally located, broad based
RLL lesion. She was prescribed Augmentin but was only able to
complete 3 days [**1-25**] GI upset. Repeat CT scan 1 month later was
unchanged and decision was made to seek further investigation at
[**Hospital1 18**].  On [**2169-10-25**] she underwent flexible bronchoscopy by IP
service with normal airway surveillance. "Radial EBUS via the R
basilar posterior segment showed a mass at 4cm from entrance
from such subsegment". Brushings and washings were taken and BAL
was done. She reports her cough has been worse since her
bronchoscopy. Initial pathology on brushings/washings were
positive for malignancy but after review this was equivocal and
it was recommended to obtain more tissue. She was seen by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in thoracic surgery on [**11-7**] who recommended
CT-guided core needly biopsy which was to be done on [**2169-11-20**].
.
At the OSH, initial VS 98 108 120/54 16 94% 2L NC. Labs notable
for WBC 25.9 with 30% bands, Cr 0.97.CXR showed RLL infiltrate.
She was given a Duoneb and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vs were: 99.8 96 102/42 19 94% 2L NC.
CXR showed RLL infiltrate consistent with pnemonia. EKG showed
sinus tachycardia with non specific ST changes anteriorly. Labs
notable for WBC 22.9 with 88%N and 7% bands, Hct 33.5 (most
recent 36), BUN 32, Cr 1.3, Mg 1.3, Phos 2.4, trop neg x1. Blood
cultures and sputum culture was drawn and Foley was placed.
Patient was given vancomycin, Zosyn. She was given codeine and
benzonatate for cough, Tylenol 1 gram for fever, Mag sulfate for
repletion, hydrocortisone 50mg given known chronic prednisone
use. Initial lactate was 5.5, she was given 5L NS, repeat
lactate 2.5 with subjective improvement in symptoms. She was
seen by thoracic surgery who recommended MICU admission and they
will follow along. VS at transfer: 99.4 94 109/50 16 97% 4L NC.
.
Upon arrival to the ICU, the patient reports feeling much better
overall since presentation. She denies any SOB and says the
codeine helped her back pain and cough tremendously.

AP CXR: Worsening consolidative opacification within the right
lung base concerning for pneumonia.

CTA chest: IMPRESSION:
1. Rapid interval progression of a consolidative process
involving the right lower lobe and posterior aspect of the right
upper lobe since the [**2169-11-13**] PET-CT, with obscuration
of previously seen mass-like lesions at posterior aspect of the
right lower lobe. Findings are most compatible with worsening
pneumonia. An underlying co-existent neoplasm may also be
present, but is obscured by this pneumonia. Right lower lobe
bronchi appear impacted.
2. New small right pleural effusion.
3. 11-mm thyroid isthmus nodule. Comparison with prior
ultrasound examinations or a non-emergent ultrasound evaluation
is recommended when
clinical stable.
4. Moderate to severe emphysema.

EKG:  ST 105, LAD, TWF I, aVL, V5-V6, II, III, aVF, low voltage
limb leads, no ST depressions/elevations

[**11-22**] ECHO: IMPRESSION: Mild mitral valve prolapse with moderate
mitral regurgitation. Normal global and regional biventricular
systolic function. Late saline contrast in left heart after
injection of agitated saline suggesting intrapulmonary shunting.
