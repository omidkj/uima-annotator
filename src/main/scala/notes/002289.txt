Brief Hospital Course:
[**Last Name (un) **]: Creatinine decreased to 2.4. Upon discharge in [**8-16**], was
1.5. Urine Na was less than 10 now 17. Concerning for HRS
physiology. s/p blood transfusion. Currently on daily midodrine
and octreotide. Anti-GBM negative. Good UOP and high blood
pressures. He was diagnosed with a UTI pre surgery. The UA is
consistent with infection. Treated with CTX. Received a seven
day course .
Confusion: This is new as of [**2186-10-31**]. Concern for
encephalopathy and asterixis. He was placed on lactulose and
rifaxamin until the time of the liver transplant.
.
HCV Cirrhosis: MELD on admission was 36. H/o decompensation with
SBP, encephalopathy, varices, ascites and thrombocytopenia. Para

received routine induction immunosuppresion to include cellcept,
solumedrol with taper and prograf which was started on the
evening of POD 0. The surgery went well with the only issue
recorded as the bile ducts were taken down and re-anastomosed
due to evidence of a bile leak. In the post op period the drain
output was minimal and the lateral drain was d/c'd prior to
discharge.
His LFTs never really were elevated and his creatinine came down
to 2.1 by day of discharge and his urine output was excellent
between one and two liters.
POD 1 ultrasound was WNL
His prograf was dose adjusted daily based on trough levels. The
level was initially high in the mid teens. Labs will be
recehecked Monday [**11-13**].
He was ambulating without difficulty although he had c/o pitting
leg edema for which he received IV lasix with good response. He
will go home on 20 PO daily x three days with re-assessment in
clinic of his fluid status. Patient was reminded to only use the
lasix for the three days to avoid dehydration.
He was tolerating diet and using supplements PRN.

and fasting levels were excellent.
