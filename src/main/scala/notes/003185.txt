Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1406**]
Chief Complaint:
Fatigue


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2187-12-14**]
1. Aortic valve replacement with a St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Epic tissue
    valve, reference #[**Serial Number 91351**].
2. Mitral valve a repair with closure of anterior leaflet
    perforation and closure of partial anterior, mitral
    leaflet cleft with 28-mm [**Company 1543**] CG Future
    annuloplasty ring, model #63HR.


History of Present Illness:
51 year old female seen in [**Hospital **] clinic on [**12-7**] in follow up for
Enterococcal endocarditis and referred to ED for further
evaluation due to altered balance, vision changes, nausea,
anterior chest discomfort, orthopnea, and DOE,
worsening over the past week. She is 6 weeks into IV PCN/gent
complicated by recent AKIN due to gentamycin.  In ED she had non
contrast head CT was negative for acute findings and Chest CT
questioned spleenic infarcts however ultrasound ruled out acute
splenic infarcts.  She had TTE that showed new involvement for
mitral valve, she was continued on IV PCN, but then discontinued
by infectious disease then resumed next day, however TEE
revealed moderate-sized vegetation on the aortic valve. Severe
(4+) aortic regurgitation is seen with reversal of flow in the
aortic arch. The mitral valve is abnormal. There is small
vegetation abscess on the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve
with perforation.
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Now referred for
surgical evaluation
Cardiac Catheterization: none

CT scan chest [**2187-12-7**] [**Hospital1 18**]
1. No evidence of pulmonary septic emboli. Evaluation for
pulmonary embolism is not possible given lack of IV contrast.
2. 3-mm pulmonary nodule in the right upper lobe and a 2-mm
pleural-based nodule in the left lower lobe are present.
3. Splenic hypodensity better seen on prior contrast enhanced
abdominopelvic CT consistent with infarct.

Cardiac Echocardiogram: TEE [**2187-12-10**] preliminary report [**Hospital1 18**]
LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the
LA/LAA or the RA/RAA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection velocity.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Overall normal LVEF (>55%).
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
Moderate-sized vegetation on aortic valve. Severe (4+) AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Abnormal mitral valve. Small vegetation on mitral
valve. Abscess cavity adjacent to mitral valve. Severe (4+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.
No mass or vegetation on tricuspid valve.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
No vegetation/mass on pulmonic valve.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions  No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in
the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of
the right atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular
systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and
free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta to 42 cm from the incisors. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is a
moderate-sized vegetation on the aortic valve. Severe (4+)
aortic
regurgitation is seen with reversal of flow in the aortic arch.
The mitral valve is abnormal. There is small vegetationabscess
on
the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve with perforation.
Severe
(4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. No vegetation/mass is seen on
the pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion

Brief Hospital Course:
51 yo female with a history of hepC with a nearly 2 month
history of enterococcal endocarditis who presented with
worsening dyspnea and TTE showed abscess and perforation of
anterior mitral valve leaflet. Patient also has 4+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]+
although she remained hemodynamically stable. She was considered
to have failed therapy with penicillin and gentamicin and it was
thought that she would need ampicillin/ceftriaxone for 4-6 weeks
per the infectious disease service. On [**2187-12-14**] she underwent an
aortic valve replacement with a St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Epic tissue valve and
mitral valve a repair with closure of anterior leaflet
perforation and closure of partial anterior, mitral leaflet
cleft with 28-mm [**Company 1543**] CG Future annuloplasty ring.  See
operative note for full details.  She was transferred to the
CVICU in stable condition and weaned off all vasoactive
medications on post operative night.  She was extubated post
operative night without incident and started on inhalers and
Flovent for a significant tobacco history.  She was transfused 2
units of blood on postoperative night for a low mixed venous and
a hematocrit of 24.4.  She had a good cardiac output the
following day and her PA catheter was removed.  Her chest tubes
and pacing wires were removed per cardiac surgery protocol.  On
POD2 she went into a slow atrial flutter in the 50's.  Coumadin
was started when she remained in afib/flutter. Infectious
disease service followed the patient pre and post operatively
and recommended ceftriaxone IV until OR cultures finalized.  She
was transferred t
