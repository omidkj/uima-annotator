Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, s/p intubation


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2188-1-9**] MVr (28mm ring), LAA lig, pericar clsr w core matrix


History of Present Illness:
  This is a 58 year old lady with a history of DM, HTN, tobacco
abuse, dCHF, renal artery stenosis status post recent CCU
hospitalization for IMI, and w/u for MVR this week who presented
to an OSH with respiratory distress requiring intubation
secondary to pulmonary edema.
.
Ms. [**Known lastname 90561**] was recently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for managment of
an inferior myocardial infarction.  Cardiac catheterization
revealed total occlusion of RCA and 60% occlusion of OM1, no
interventions were made. An echo confirmed presence of severe
mitral regurgitaion with a basal inferior left ventrical
aneurysm.  Cardiac surgery was consulted at the time and the
patient was tentatively scheduled for mitral valve repair on
[**1-9**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**].  She had already obtained dental
clearance with 5 teeth extracted and carotic ultrasound and
cardiac MRI were performed prior to discharge. She was
determined not to be a candidate for CABG.
.
She had been doing well since her discharge without episodes of
CP or chest tightness or shortness of breath per her husband's
report. She had been compliant with her medications and diet
control. This morning, she and her husband went to a [**Name (NI) 107268**].
Within 20 to 30 minutes she noted acute SOB after walking to the
bathroom.  EMS was called, SBPs were in the 200s w/ o2 sats in
the 70s off oxygen.  She was given nitro, 40 of IV lasix started
on BIPAP and transferred to [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 794**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] where she was
intubated for respiratory distress. A CXR was consistent with
pulmonary edema.  ECG on admission demonstrated aterolateral
peaked T waves and inferior TWI. Concerned for ACS, she was
started on heparin and nitro gtt and given aspirin. A bedside
echo demonstrated basal inferior akinesis with an aneurysmal
segment but otherwise normal wall motion with severe MR and mild
AI. Cardiac enzymes were cycled and normal. A BNP was in the
626.  The patient's husband requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] as her
cardiac care is handled here. On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], she was
intubated and sedated. Cardiac surgery was reconsulted for
coronary revascularization.

sounds on exam, RR, normal S1, S2. Grade III/VI holosystolic

Pertinent Results:
ECG [**2188-1-6**] Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Left
ventricular hypertrophy. Slightly prolonged Q-T interval.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2187-12-16**] the findings are
similar.
.
CHEST XRAY [**2188-1-6**]
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. The patient has been intubated. The tip of the tube
projects 4 cm
above the carina. There are bilateral parenchymal opacities
highly suggestive of pulmonary edema. The patient has received a
nasogastric tube, the tip of the tube is not visualized but the
course is normal. No pleural effusions.  Borderline size of the
cardiac silhouette.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2188-1-11**] Ms.[**Known lastname 90561**] was taken to the operating room and
underwent a Mitral valve repair with 28-mm [**Doctor Last Name **] physio II
ring annuloplasty model #5200, serial #[**Numeric Identifier 107269**].[**Last Name (STitle) 914**]. Please see operative report for
further details. Overall the patient tolerated the procedure
well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.   POD 1 found
the patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing
comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact and
hemodynamically stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support.
Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed
toward the preoperative weight.  The patient was transferred to
the telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes and
pacing wires were discontinued without complication.  She did
have some post operative ATN with a peak creatinine of 2.5
(baseline 1.4)  Creatinine was decreasing at the time of
discharge and was 1.9 on post operative day 8.  She was found to
be in a second degree heart block and Amiodarone which was
started for atrial fibrillation was stopped.  She was
alternating between sinus brady 40-60's and atrial fibrillation
110-115 and EP service was consulted.  They recommended stopping
the Amiodarone, converting Lopressor 12.5 TID to Toprol XL 25
daily and anticoagulation with Coumadin.  Coumadin was started
with INR goal of [**12-26**].5.  VNA is to draw INR and call results
into [**Hospital3 **] [**Hospital 197**] Clinic for further dosing
instructions.  She was scheduled for a 1 month follow up with
EP.   The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service
for assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of
discharge on POD 8 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound
was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The
patient was discharged home with services in good condition with
appropriate follow up instructions
