ADDENDUM:  This is a Discharge Summary Addendum from the
dates of [**2146-3-1**] to [**2146-3-8**].

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM (CONTINUED):

1.  PNEUMONIA ISSUES:  The patient came in with signs and
symptoms of a right lower lobe pneumonia.  She was initially
treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin (as mentioned
above); however, she developed a rash on this and an
eosinophilia.  Therefore, this regimen was discontinued, and
she was started on levofloxacin.

She maintained her oxygen saturation on no supplemental
oxygen, and she worked with Physical Therapy toward the end
of her admission.  She did have occasional wheezes requiring
nebulizer treatments; however, this was felt to be likely due
to hypervolemia in the context of fluid overload from
vigorous fluid resuscitation.

Her white count actually climbed while she was called out on
the floor up to as high as 30 with a strong left shift.  She
had an abdominal and chest computed tomography which did not
show any clear evidence of infection that persisted;
although, she did have what looked to be like resolving
congestive heart failure and lower lobe atelectasis.  The
patient was continued on levofloxacin and was to continue for
two further days; to complete a 14-day course of antibiotics.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  The patient was initially
hypotensive on presentation and required multiple fluid
boluses and was actually on pressors.  However, she was
normotensive by the time she was called out to the floor and
had multiple days of being negative in order to make her more
normovolemic.  By the end of her admission, she was restarted
on her 80 mg of by mouth Lasix once per day.

3.  ATRIAL FIBRILLATION ISSUES:  The patient was converted
chemically with amiodarone and was maintained on initially
400 mg three times per day and then 400 mg twice per day for
seven days and was to continue on 200 mg once per day after
this current week of being on 400 mg.  This may be
discontinued as an outpatient since she had been in a normal
sinus rhythm throughout.

She was initially anticoagulated, but this was maintained
ultimately because she developed an upper extremity deep
venous thrombosis.

4.  UPPER EXTREMITY DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS ISSUES:  On [**3-2**], the patient developed left upper extremity swelling.  A
Doppler ultrasound was performed which showed a nonocclusive
thrombus surrounding her subclavian line.  This subclavian
line was subsequently removed with an improvement in her
edema.  Follow-up Doppler studies showed no residual clot.
However, out of concern there was still residual thrombus,
she will be maintained on Coumadin for the following three
months provided there are no further thrombotic
complications.

5.  DEGENERATIVE JOINT DISEASE ISSUES:  On chest computed
tomography, the patient showed a loculated effusion around
her left shoulder.  Out of concern for the white count, there
was thought that this perhaps was septic.  An Orthopaedic
Service consultation was obtained who felt the clinical
picture was not consistent with septic arthritis.  She did
have a shoulder magnetic resonance imaging that showed
significant degenerative disease, but no evidence of
infection.

6.  QUESTION OF CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE COLITIS ISSUES:  The
patient did have one or two days of loose stools.  Given her
significant leukocytosis and the loose stools, she was
started empirically on Flagyl.  It was thought to wait until
she was negative times three; however, given the significant
leukocytosis, it was felt to start empirically while
cultures/toxin assay was pending.  They were negative times
two, and Clostridium difficile toxin B was pending at the
time of this dictation.  She was to continue a 14-day course
of Flagyl.  It was of note that the patient's white count
continued to drop over the course of her admission while she
was treated with levofloxacin and Flagyl.

7.  COAGULASE-NEGATIVE STAPHYLOCOCCAL BACTEREMIA ISSUES:
There was one blood culture that was positive for
coagulase-negative Staphylococcus.  It was likely that this
was a contaminant and not secondary to true bacteremia.
However, she had been started earlier on vancomycin out of
concern for a pseudomonal pneumonia.  This was continued
until the day of discharge when follow-up surveillance
cultures were negative to date, and there was no evidence of
any bacteremia since the patient was afebrile, nontoxic
appearing, and overall looked well.

8.  ACCESS ISSUES:  The patient's subclavian line was
removed, and a right-sided peripherally inserted central
catheter was placed instead.

9.  CODE STATUS ISSUES:  Code status was full.
