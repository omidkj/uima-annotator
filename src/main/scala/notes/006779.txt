History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 63 year old female with past medical history of
atrial fibrillation/flutter not on anticoagulation, breast
cancer
s/p lumpectomy, tamoxifen, XRT and femara, asthma, and

CT head w/o contrast ([**12-7**]):Stable left basal ganglia hemorrhage
is noted with no increase in the extent of the mass effect.
Slight increase in the amount of left
occipital intraventricular blood is noted. Small amount of right
occipital
intraventricular blood is also noted. No new areas of
hemorrhages are
visualized. The ventricles and subarachnoid spaces are within
normal limits.

fibrillation/flutter, not on anticoagulation, breast cancer,

facial droop and right sided weakness. Exam with aphasia,
dysarthria, partial right field cut, right face and arm>leg
weakness, consistent with left MCA infarct. CT scan with dense

of stroke is embolic. 12 hours s/p tPA, had hemorrhage into
infarct site.

on hep sc ppx 2 bleed)


Brief Hospital Course:
Neuro: Pt was transferred to the floor on [**12-11**] from ICU after
stabilization of basal ganglia bleed. Pt slowly improved in
terms of moility and understanding from [**Date range (1) 12258**]. She was
also restarted on low dose aspirin, but held off on coumadin for
head bleed. [**Date range (1) 12259**], pt continue to recover neurologically
w/ increasing strength on left side, able to verbalize more
fluently, thought with some problems with naming. She is still
with right hemiparesis.

Card: Initially, there was difficulty controlling her heart rate
w/ b-blocker in the ICU. This was improved by adding amiodarone
to her B-blocker. S
