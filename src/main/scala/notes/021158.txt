Pertinent Results:
CT head [**2153-10-30**]:
FINDINGS: There are post-surgical changes following a right
frontal
craniotomy, with interval placement of a catheter that courses
into the right frontal lobe. Within the surgical resection bed,
there continues to be fluid as well as a small amount of
postoperative hemorrhage, similar in appearance from the prior
study, with residual vasogenic edema within the right frontal
lobe. There continues to be a marked mass effect with
obliteration of the right lateral ventricle, and leftward
subfalcine herniation of approximately 16 mm, grossly unchanged
from the prior study. Assessment of the resection cavity is
limited without IV contrast.

Early right uncal herniation is stable, with a known right
temporal lobe mass, not clearly appreciated without contrast.
There has been no other interval change, without new foci of
hemorrhage or acute major vascular territorial infarction. There
is minimal mucosal thickening of the ethmoidal sinuses. Osseous
structures reveal a right frontal craniotomy defect, with
subcutaneous air along the right frontal soft tissues.

IMPRESSION:
1. Interval placement of a catheter into right frontal lobe,
with residual
fluid and hemorrhage within the surgical bed.
2. Stable continued local mass effect with obliteration of the
right lateral ventricle and leftward subfalcine herniation.
CT head [**10-28**]:
There is a right frontal craniotomy with residual residual
pneumocephalus and subcutaneous air. The right frontal surgical
cavity has filled with fluid and expanded, with increased right
subfalcine herniation. The anterior falx is deviated to the left
by by 21 mm, previously 14 mm. There is new right uncal
herniation. There is increased sulcal effacement in the right
cerebral hemisphere. There is increased compression of the right
lateral ventricle, as well as the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left
lateral ventricle. The third ventricle is compressed. There is
no acute
hemorrhage.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 1140**] was readmitted with mental status changes and new left
sided paralysis. He was found to have increased midline shift
from 12 mm to 21 mm and a large amount of cerebral edema around
his brain mass. The patient was admitted to the ICU for Q1 hour
neuro checks. He was given mannitol and dexamethasone. On
[**2153-10-29**] he was taken to the OR for steriotactic cyst aspiration
plus Rickham reservoir (internally) for continued drainage as
needed.. His post-op CT showed decreased midline shift.

He was extubated on [**2153-10-30**] and was still quite lethargic
although he was moving his right side well. On [**2153-10-31**] he was
significantly improved. His mental status was back to baseline -
he was oriented x 3 and following commands well. His left side
was regaining some strength. His left arm was antigravity and
his left IP was antigravity as well hence he was ablt to be
transferred out of ICU on POD#2.

He continues to be stable on the floor and underwent Cyberknife
planning on [**11-5**] morning.  He is to return to Brain [**Hospital 341**]
Clinic/Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] (schedule written on DC report) for follow-up.
