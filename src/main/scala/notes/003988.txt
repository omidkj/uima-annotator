Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2186**]
Chief Complaint:
confusion, change in MS, hypoxia, humeral fracture

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 83 yo man w/ h/o CAD s/p CABG >25 yrs ago, s/p
ICD, Afib not on coumadin, HTN who was admitted after mechanical
fall with proximal left humeral fracture on [**2111-10-9**].  At time of
initial admit, patient had rec'd 2 mg SC morphine, 2 percocets
in the emergency room with subsequent dramatic change in mental
status, but was noted to be clear and oriented prior to
administration. He denied head trauma or LOC during fall. Has
been having "almost" falls lately with some frequency.
.
Since admission, patient has been having waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**]
mental status, worsened by narcotics and benzos, as above. Xray
showed comminuted, displaced fracture of left proximal humerus.
Seen by ortho, given sling, and told to be non-weight bearing.
PT consult obtained. Had transient low bp on [**10-9**] to 80's/60's,
thought to be due to wrong medication/antihypertensive doses
(family unsure of doses/ meds). This improved with dose
adjustments. Cr also elevated during admission, thought to be
mostly chronic per notes (but no baseline), given hydration.

Pertinent Results:
2 views left shoulder:  Comminuted, displaced fracture of the
left proximal humerus.

[**10-11**] CT head: There is no intraaxial hemorrhage. There is no
shift of normally midline structures, acute fractures, loss of
the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation, or major vascular
territorial infarct. The ventricles and sulci are prominent
consistent with mild brain atrophy. There is low attenuation of
the centrum semi-ovale consistent with chronic microvascular
ischemia. There is a low attenuation in the left basal ganglia
consistent with an old lacunar infarct. This study is degraded
secondary to patient motion and streak artifact. There are
prominent low density extra-axial spaces over the right
convexity and in the left parafalcine region, most likely
representing subdural hygromas or chronic subdural collections.
There is no evidence of an acute subdural hematoma. There is no
mass effect.

[**2111-10-12**] B/L LE dopplers:Negative bilateral lower extremity
Doppler examination.
.
[**2111-10-12**] CT head: 1. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or
edema.
2. Cerebral atrophy.
3. Widening of the right extra-axial space likely secondary to
atrophy and/or a subdural hygroma.
.
[**2111-10-12**] CXR:Mild pulmonary edema has developed accompanied by
numerous small right pleural effusion. Severe cardiomegaly is
stable. Atrial biventricular pacer leads are in standard
placements. No pneumothorax.
.
[**2111-10-12**]: EF 15-20% Mild pulmonary edema has developed
accompanied by numerous small right pleural effusion. Severe
cardiomegaly is stable. Atrial biventricular pacer leads are in
standard placements. No pneumothorax.
.
[**2111-10-14**] CT OF THE LEFT SHOULDER WITHOUT CONTRAST: A reference is
made to a prior radiograph dated [**2111-10-8**]. There is a
complex, comminuted fracture through the surgical neck of the
left humerus with anteromedial angulation of the humeral shaft.
A small fracture involving the distalmost aspect of the clavicle
is likely also present. The acromioclavicular joint is
preserved. The humeral head is normally seated within the
glenoid, without evidence of dislocation. An unusual dense ovoid
bony "nodule" is present adjacent to the fracture site and is of
unclear etiology. ? sclerotic focus within the bone (e.g. bone
island which was "released" by the fracture or possibly a dense
loose body in the joint space. There is surrounding soft tissue
hematoma and effusion. Incidental note is made of a 3.3 x 1.7 cm
lipoma along the lateral aspect of the proximal humeral shaft.

IMPRESSION: Comminuted, displaced fracture through the surgical
neck of the left humerus as above. Small distal clavicular
fracture. Unusual ovoid density, as described.
.

[**2111-10-16**] RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Grayscale, color, and
Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right internal jugular, right
subclavian, right axillary, right brachial, right basilic, and
right cephalic veins were performed. The most superiorly located
brachial vein is noncompressible and does not demonstrate any
wall to wall color or venous waveforms. These findings are
suggestive of thrombosis involving the superior brachial vein.
The remaining veins otherwise appeared normal with wall-to-wall
color flow, normal waveforms, and normal compressibility.

IMPRESSION: Noncompressibility of the superior right brachial
vein, with lack of color flow and absent venous waveforms,
findings consistent with venous thrombosis.
.
[**2111-10-16**] Renal ultrasound: Large left renal cyst with a thick
septation with calcification falling in the Bosniak II F
category. A four to six month followup is recommended. There is
no evidence of hydronephrosis or renal stones.
.
[**2111-10-19**] RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: This examination was
extremely limited due to altered mental status. No ascites is
seen. This study should be repeated when the patient is more
able to cooperate with the exam
.
[**2111-10-19**]: ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND WITH LIVER DOPPLER EXAMINATION:
The gallbladder is not visualized. The common bile duct is not
dilated at 3 mm. The liver parenchyma is normal in echo texture
without focal nodules or masses. There is a moderate right-sided
pleural effusion. The right kidney measures 11.4 cm. There is an
exophytic 2.9 x 2.8 x 2.5 cm simple cyst off the lateral aspect
of the right kidney. The left kidney measures 12.4 cm, with a
7.5 x 6.2 x 6.9 cm cyst, which a thin septation and mild
calcifications. The spleen is not enlarged. The pancreas is
poorly visualized secondary to overlying bowel gas.

Doppler examination reveals normal flow and phasicity within the
main and right portal veins, demonstrating hepatopetal flow.
Normal flow and phasicity is seen within the main hepatic
artery. All hepatic veins are patent, with appropriate flow.
Increased phasicity is consistent with underlying right heart
failure.

IMPRESSION:
1. All hepatic vessels are patent with normal directional flow.
Increased phasicity within the hepatic veins is consistent with
underlying right heart failure.
2. Normal appearing liver parenchyma without focal nodules or
masses identified.

3. No evidence of hydronephrosis bilaterally. Simple cyst in
right kidney. Cyst with internal calcification and thin
septation within left kidney.

4. Moderate right
