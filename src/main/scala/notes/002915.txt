History of Present Illness:
86M s/p AVR, CABG [**2127-4-23**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Post-op course was
relatively uncomplicated.  He did revert to AFib and coumadin
was
resumed.  He was started on Kefzol for a small amount of sternal
drainage, which resolved.  Beta blockade was held due to 2nd
degree AV block.  He was discharged to rehab on POD 5.  He left
on IV diuresis via his PICC.  He developed a pneumonia last week
and has been treated with antibioitcs and a steroid taper.
Additionally, he has received multiple blood transfusions for
anemia.  Reportedly, diuresis was discontinued at rehab on [**5-9**].

The patient was seen at this cardiologist office today and was
noted to be significantly SOB and appeared fluid overloaded. He
was sent directly to the ER for evaluation and admission. He
remained hemydynamically stable. Stat bedside echo showed
moderate effusion. Creat elevated at 1.5. CXR clear. He was
admitted to the CVICU for monitoring. Stat TTE was obatined
which
showed large pericardial effusion with RV collapse, no pulses
paradoxes. Interventional cardiology was consulted and the
decesion was to hold off on doing percutaneous drainge of
effusion until AM. INR 2.0 coumadin held and FFP and vitamin K.

Findings
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2127-5-15**].
LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA. Normal
interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall normal LVEF (>55%).
Trabeculated LV apex. No resting LVOT gradient. No VSD.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Dilated RV cavity. RV function depressed.
Abnormal septal motion/position.

AORTIC VALVE: Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. No MS. Mild (1+) MR.

PERICARDIUM: Very small pericardial effusion. Effusion echo
dense, c/w blood, inflammation or other cellular elements. No
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.

Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded (basal to mid infero-lateral hypokinesis is suggested
on some images.). Overall left ventricular systolic function is
preserved (LVEF>50%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The
right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. There is abnormal septal motion/position. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is a very small pericardial effusion. The effusion is echo
dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular
elements. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2127-5-15**],
the pericardial effusion appears smaller. RV systolic function
cannot be compared due to poor RV visualization on prior. LVEF
is probably similar.
