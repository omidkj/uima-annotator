Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**]
Chief Complaint:
STEMI, pneumonia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization with stent placed in the LAD


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 77 yo woman with PMH of diet controlled DM2, HTN, breast
ca s/p surgical resection and XRT who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
from [**Hospital3 4107**] for STEMI.  Patient was in her USOH until 1
week prior to presentation at [**Hospital3 **] when she began
having cough productive of yellow-colored sputum tinged with
specks of blood, also noted fevers/chills, some SOB with
exertion.  The patient was started on Levaquin as an outpatient
3 days prior to presentation which did not alleviate her sxs.
She denies any SOB w/ exertion prior to onset of cough and
fevers, orthopnea, PND, chest pain/pressure, palpitations.  Does
have some LE edema which she attributes to knee surgery.
Patient presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2134-4-19**] with above
complaints, and was found to have pneumonia with CXR findings
demonstrated RUL, RML, RLL pneumonia.  She was also found to be
hypokalemic with K=2.9 on admission.  Patient was treated with
potassium repletion, abx included IV azithromycin and cefotaxime
that was changed to levaquin and cefazolin.  Influenza swab and
legionella titers were negative.  Pt had some clinical
improvement, although remained w/ cough and SOB w/ exertion
throughout her hospital course.  On [**2134-4-23**], pt developed SSCP
on and off throughout the day, received morphine and NTG, EKG
demonstrated ST elevation of anterior leads on top of underlying
J point elevation, with some reciprical changes seen in inferior
leads - these EKG findings were noted in retrospect.  Patient
then developed VFib arrest and was successfully defibrillated.
She was started on integrilin gtt, heparin gtt, plavix 300mg x
1, ASA 325mg x 1, lopressor 5mg IV x ?[**4-4**], then transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for emergent cath.
Unknown time of transit b/w onset of chest pain and arrival in
cath lab (un-documented per OSH when chest pain occurred).
Patient was complaining of [**4-9**] CP on arrival to cath lab.  She
received pre-medication with benadryl, solumedrol, pepcid due to
her dye allergy.  Cath demonstrated 50% PDA and PL lesions,
90-99% LAD lesion (right after take-off of D1).  She had stent
placed to LAD lesion.  [**Name (NI) 2076**] pt was CP free.  Cardiac cath
c/b low stick (likely in SFA) and R thigh hematoma, patient
remained hemodynamically stable.
Currently pt feels well, chest pain free, no SOB at rest, but
has not tried moving around.  No other complaints.
.
ROS:  Also + for syncopal episodes x past couple years on
occasion, denies prodrome of N/V, diaphoresis, does have some
dizziness prior to episodes at times, at time no prodrome at
all.  Has LOC for seconds to minutes, denies loss of bowel or
bladder fxn, denies post-ictal state.

Cardiac cath ([**4-24**]):
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Acute anterior myocardial infarction, managed by acute ptca.
 PTCA of  vessel.
3. PCI of the mid LAD.
4. Right groin hematoma
.
TTE ([**4-24**]): The left atrium is elongated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.  Resting
regional wall motion abnormalities include akinesis of the
antero-septum, anterior wall distal LV/apex. Tissue velocity
imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve is not well seen.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trivial mitral regurgitation
is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired
relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CXR ([**4-24**]): Multifocal consolidation in right lung, in keeping
with the
provided history of pneumonia.  Followup radiographs are
suggested to confirm resolution.

Brief Hospital Course:
.
# Cardiac:
A. Ischemia:  Pt had STEMI in anterior leads on presentation,
underwent cardiac cath [**2134-4-24**] with stent placed in lesion in
LAD (right after D1).  Initially maintained on integrilin, but
it was discontinued postcath in setting of a groin hematoma.
Cardiac enzymes trended down, peak CK 1479 on admission.  The
patient was chest pain free for the remainder of her stay.  Her
hematoma and Hct were stable and no bruit was auscultated.  She
was discharged on ASA, Plavix, Toprol XL, lisinopril, and
high-dose Lipitor.
.
B. Rhythm:  Pt had VFib arrest at OSH, successfully
cardioverted, likely secondary to ischemia.  At baseline, has
borderline long QTc at 468.  Also concern for arrythmia given
syncope hx (see below).  As VF arrest was in the setting of
acute STEMI, she was not felt to meet criteria for ICD from that
standpoint.  QT prolonging medications were avoided.  EP consult
for syncope workup as below.
.
C. Pump:  Unknown EF.  Pt clinically appeared volume overloaded
on admission, with elevated JVD, and crackles in lungs.  ECHO
[**4-24**] demonstrated EF=25%, anterior WMA consistent with an LAD
lesion, and apical akinesis.  She was diuresed with prn IV
Lasix.  She was started on IV heparin for apical akinesis.  EP
evaluated her and recommended repeat TTE in 1 month, with ETT-T
wave alternans and signal average ECG-EP study to determine if
she qualifies for ICD per MADIT II criteria.  She was discharged
on Toprol XL, lisinopril, and Coumadin with a Lovenox bridge,
with an INR check later that week.
.
# Syncope:  Pt reports long history of syncope, generally
without prodrome, and with significant injuries with fall (i.e.
hitting head, breaking ankle, etc.).  The story was felt to be
concerning for arrythmia.  MRI/A showed no significant
vertebrobasilar stenosis.  EP was consulted, but flet her
history was more consistent with vasovagal vs. hypoglycemic
episodes.  She was discharged to continue further workup as per
PCP.
.
# ID/Respiratory:  Patient presented to the outside hospital
with evidence of R sided pneumonia.  Repeat CXR here was
consi
