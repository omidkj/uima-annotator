ECHO
Conclusions:
1. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are
normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal.
2. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
4. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension

CCath

Brief Hospital Course:
89 yo female with extensive CAD s/p CABG and TO SVG and recent
95% LM lesion stented. Pt with recurrent angina like symptoms,
resulting in repeat diagnostic cath c/b FA bleed and aneurysm
requiring multiple blood transfusions and pressors.

1) CAD:  Pt with extensive CAD s/p CABG and recent LMCA stent
who presented for repeat diagnostic catherization that showed
patent stent but complicated by common femoral artery bleed.
Given Pt's HD instability post-procedure, Pt was only continued
on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] and Plavix; while holding BB.  After
stabilization Pt was restarted on a BB.  Pt will continue to be
managed medically. [**Hospital **] medical regimen consisting of
atenolol 12.5 mg qd (to be titrated up as outpatient as
tolerated), [**Hospital **] 325 qd, Plavix 75 mg qd times 9 months,
Simvastatin 10 mg qd.  On transfer Pt recieving Cozaar 50 mg qd,
which was held during hospital stay due to HD instability; it
should be added back on as an outpatient when seen next week by
PCP if Pt continues to be stable.

2) Vascular: As above, Pt's catherization complicated by CFA
aneurysm and bleed.  Initial external pressure unsuccesful in
stopping the bleed.  Attempt to asses artery from the other
femoral artery unsuccessful given extensive artherosclerosis.
However, with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 79818**] [**Last Name (un) **] from a the same FA was able to be
advanced to the aneursym with succesful tamponade.  CT confirmed
significant retroperitoneal bleed.  Pt did require 2 emergent
units of PRBC and the initiation of dopamine gtt given
hypotension.  Pt aggresively hydrated overnight, with serial
Hcts being stable.  Hct then began to trend down requiring an
additional 4 units of PRBC the following day.  Hemodynamically
Pt improved and was weaned off dopamine.  Vascular surgery
followed throughout and was integral in her management.  Hct
stabilized once again; not requiring further transfusions or
exploratory surgery.

3) Pump:  A p-MIBI earlier in the year with evidence of EF 72%.
Pt without history of CHF or LV dysfunction.  Pt hypovelemic
secondary to RP bleed and was aggresively hydrated during
initial hospital days. [**Last Name (un) **] held due to this instability and BB
started at a lower dose.  Out Pt cardiac regimen as above and
weill be titrated to maximum effect as outpatient given Pt's
ability to tolerate.

4) CRI: Pt with known CRI with a reported baseline Cr 1.8 prior
to admission. Initial Cr 2.1 however remaining Cr ranged from
1.2 - 1.1.  Pt managed with mucomyst prior to and proceeding
catherization as well as receiving D5 with NaBicarb.  No
evidence of renal failure or insufficiency during hospital stay.
 Pt to be followed up as outpatient.
