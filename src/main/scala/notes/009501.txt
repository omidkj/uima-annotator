Attending:[**Last Name (un) 11974**]
Chief Complaint:
bradycardia and hypotension following PVI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI)
Atrial fibrillation ablation
Direct current cardioversion (DCV)
[**Hospital1 **]-ventricular pacemaker placement


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 104800**] is a 68yoF with a h/o myxomatous mitral valve s/p
core valve in [**2179**] c/b postoperative paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation. She was managed on amiodarone until [**2184-8-27**].
At that time event monitoring demonstrated accelerated
junctional rhythm with APBs and atrial couplets, and amiodarone
was discontinued.  She was then asymptomatic until [**2185-2-25**]
when she began to experience episodes of palpitations. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of
Hearts monitor revealed frequent
APBs and VPBs, short runs of atrial tachycardia and bigeminy.
She was started on propafenone and metoprolol, but subsequently
reverted to afib. She underwent successful DCCV on [**2185-6-3**], but
on [**2185-6-6**] she presented to OSH ED for palpitations and was
found to again be in atrial fibrillation on [**2185-6-6**]. She was
again cardioverted and her Propafenone was increased to 225mg
TID.  Stress echo was done on [**2185-6-15**] which was notable for a
junctional rhythm that occurred during peak exercise. Echo
imaging was negative for ischemia and showed preserved EF. She
was admitted today for elective PVI.
.
Post ablation pt underwent DCV with 200 joules. She cardioverted
to sinus rhythm but was bradycardic with HR 30s and hypotensive
(SBP 80s). Temp wire inserted and pacer set at 90, and she was
started on dopamine gtt. She was transferred to the CCU for
further management. On arrival, vitals were T 96.6, HR 81, BP
110/48. She was still intubated on arrival but quickly extubated
and then breathing comfortably with O2 sats 100% on 2L NC. She
noted mild chest discomfort, but denied palpitations, SOB.

Pertinent Results:
Admission labs:
WBC 4.7  Hgb 11.9 Hct 34.2  Plts 252
INR 3.0

Pertinent studies:
Renal ultrasound ([**2185-7-13**]): 1. Polypoid urothelial lesion seen
within the lumen of the urinary bladder suggestive of a
urothelial tumor vs. intraluminal clot. A cystoscopy is
recommended. Note is made that the bladder is moderately
distended despite a Foley catheter in place.
2. Normal appearance of the kidneys.

Brief Hospital Course:
68yoF with h/o paroxysmal atrial fibrillation after percutaneous
MVR in [**2179**] now s/p PVI today c/b sinus bradycardia with HR to
20s-30s.

# Sinus bradycardia/tachycardia: S/p PVI, successfully
cardioverted to sinus rhythm but bradycardic to 20s-30s.
Initially with temporary atrial pacing and dopamine drip.
However, in AM on HD1, patient reverted back into atrial
tachycardia to 150s.  Patient was given 5mg IV metoprolol and
loaded with digoxin with no effect.  She was cardioverted but
returned to tachycardic rhythm within an hour.  She was started
on an esmolol drip with rate control to the 100s.  On HD2,
patient had a dual chamber pacer palced in the right atria and
ventricle.  They were unable to place a lead in the LV, however,
the device may be upgraded at a later date.  Rate was controlled
at 80 following the procedure. She was loaded with amiodarone
for rhythm control.  Metoprolol was held initially as pressures
were low but was started on HD4 at home dose. Heart rate and
blood pressure remained stable after this, and she was
transferred to the floors where she remained hemodynamically
stable. She was discharged on amiodorone taper and metoprolol.

# Hypotension: Patient required a dopamine drip to maintain
blood pressures following initial procedure.  After pacemaker
was placed, dopamine drip was held, but patient's pressures
continued to be low. This resolved with placement of permanent
pacemaker and blood pressure remained stable after she was
transitioned to the floors, tolerating the addition of
metoprolol and her home valsartan.

# Hematuria: The patient was noted to have gross hematuria in
the setting of foly placement with an elevated INR. Urine
studies showed 182 RBCs and 182 white cells.   The patient
underwent a renal US which showed polypoid mass in the bladder
concerning for a mass but which could also present a blood clot.
 Urology was contact[**Name (NI) **] and recommended outpatient f/u with
repeat U/A in 6 months and possible cystoscopy.

# HLD: Continued home gemfibrozil.

# GERD: Continued home pantoprazole.

# Transitional issues:
- f/u with urology for bladder mass
