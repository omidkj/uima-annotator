Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
 dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 14936**] is a [**Age over 90 **]yo woman with h/o COPD, pectus carinatum,
moderate AS, and chronic diastolic heart failure who presents
with a [**1-19**] week history of dyspnea.
.
She reports increasing shortness of breath such that she was
having difficulty with her daily activities (such as using her
walker to get down the [**Doctor Last Name **] at her independent living facility).
+cough, but no fevers. No hemoptysis. Per family's report, a CXR
was obtained 2 weeks ago, and they were told there was a
pneumonia, so she was given a 1 week course of levofloxacin
(last dose 2 days ago). Nevertheless, she has continued to feel
weak and out of breath. Over the last 3-4 days, she has had
increasing LE edema. She denies orthopnea or PND. No chest pain
or back pain. She did have a nosebleed a few days ago.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 97.8 90 129/73 20 100% NRB. She
received ASA 162mg and a dose of lasix 20mg IV for presumed
heart failure. LE ultrasound was negative for DVT, and a CTA was
performed to rule out PE. Although there was no evidence of PE,
a large hematoma was found surrounding the thoracic aorta with a
5mm focal defect in the aortic wall suggestive of tear. She was
seen by CT surgery, who felt that surgery would be needed to
repair the tear, but that given her age and comorbidities,
conservative management with BP control was indicated. CT
surgery discussed this with the patient and her family. Of note,
the ED nurse felt that she might be aspirating while eating.
.
Upon arrival to the MICU, she denied any difficulty breathing.
She asked for ice cream, stating that she was very hungry.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]yo woman with COPD and pectus carinatum who presented with
dyspnea and was found to have tear in thoracic aorta.

1. Dyspnea: Most likely multifactorial due to underlying chest
wall deformity (from pectus carinatum, scoliosis and compression
fractures), COPD, and acute on chronic diastolic heart failure.
Although pneumonia is also a possibility, she did not have
fevers, a productive cough, or evidence of infiltrate on CXR.
Aortic stenosis may contribute to her propensity to develop
pulmonary edema/pleural effusions. Continued afterload control
with home meds (diltiazem, lisinopril) and added metoprolol for
HR control, management of AFIB as below. Continued home inhalers
(advair, spiriva, albuterol). She received occasional low doses
of lasix for gentle diuresis to help with breathing. She was
discharged on 10 mg PO lasix. She was also discharged with home
oxygen which she should use during transfers and as needed.

2. Tear in Thoracic Aorta: Unclear why this developed as patient
does not have poorly controlled HTN or family history of
dissection.  She has been coughing more lately, which could have
contributed.  Regardless of cause, she was evaluated by CT
surgery, who did not feel that she was an operative candidate
because of her age and comorbidities.  The patient and family
communicated understanding of her diagnosis and consensus about
the decision regarding medical management only. BP maintained at
goal SBP < 120-130.

3. Leukocytosis: She has not had fever to suggest infection.
Cultures sent with no evidence to suggest pulmonary infection.

4. Compression fractures: Started Ca/Vit D. Consider fosamax as
outpatient.

5. Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine

6. Depression:  Continued mirtazapine and trazodone

7. Glaucoma, cataracts:  Comtinued on dorzolamide eye drops

8. GERD:  PPI

9. FEN:  low salt diet with 1:1 supervision/aspiration
precautions.

10. PPx:  PPI, pneumoboots, bowel reg

11. Access:  PIV x 2

12. Code: DNR/DNI, confirmed with patient and family.

13. Comm:  with daughter [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] (h) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 33029**]; (c)
