Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10842**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
In brief, Pt is an 86 y/o with a PMH of afib on coumadin, CHF EF
45%, HTN, recently diagnosed COPD who presented with several
weeks of SOB and DOE.  She was admitted to the MICU and
underwent TTE which showed critical AS, with valve area 0.5 cm2
and mean gradient 78 and peak gradient 129.  She is being
transferred to CCU for further care.
.
With regards to the patient's DOE, it has been worsening over
the last few weeks.  Previously, the patient was able to walk
around the mall without much difficulty.  Her breathing has been
even worse over the last few days, to the point that she gets
short of breath even at rest. On the day of admission she was
seen to be very SOB by her daughter and was brought to her PCPs
office where her amb sat was 86% on RA and she was sent to ED.

[**3-17**] CXR
Mild CHF. Right paratracheal density/mass. Left basal pneumonia.
No change
since the examination done one hour earlier. Ct scan of chest
suggested.

[**3-18**] ECHO
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with septal/inferior
hypokinesis. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation. There is no ventricular septal defect. with mild
global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area
<0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The mitral valve shows
characteristic rheumatic deformity. There is moderate thickening
of the mitral valve chordae. There is a minimally increased
gradient consistent with trivial mitral stenosis. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**3-19**] CXR
Compared to the film from two days previous there continues to
be
cardiomegaly. There is increased pulmonary vascular
re-distribution and
increased bilateral effusions left greater than right suggesting
worsening
CHF. The prominence in the right paratracheal region is again
seen and it is unclear if this is due to tortuous vessel versus
a mass in this region. The opacity in the retrocardiac region
has also increased and it is unclear if this is due to pulmonary
edema or an infectious infiltrate. Pleural calcifications are
again noted.
.
IMPRESSION: Worsening CHF.
.
[**3-20**] CUS
IMPRESSION: Bilateral 1-39% ICA stenosis with blunted common
carotid
waveforms consistent with aortic stenosis. Antegrade vertebral
flow. Right
thyroid cyst as described above.
.

[**3-20**] CT CHEST
IMPRESSION:
1. The thyroid is markedly enlarged, with multiple masses. The
thyroid gland extends into the superior mediastinum, resulting
in mass effect on the great vessels, particularly the right
brachiocephalic artery, left common carotid and subclavian
arteries, and brachiocephalic veins. The origin and course of
the left common carotid artery cannot be delineated on this
study. The right brachiocephalic vein is sandwiched between the
first rib and goiter, with multiple collateral vessels seen in
the upper neck. Furthermore, at least one of the thyroid nodules
in the right superior mediastinum contains multiple thin flecks
of calcium, concerning for neoplasm. Multiple enlarged
mediastinal nodes are also seen. Further evaluation is
recommended, to evaluate for the possibility of a thyroid
cancer.
2. Cardiomegaly, coronary artery calcifications, aortic valve
and mitral
valve calcifications, and aortic atherosclerosis.
3. Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
4. Mosaic attenuation in the lungs, possibly related to
airtrapping.
5. L1 compression fracture.

[**3-24**] CARDIAC CATH

COMMENTS:     1. Selective coronary angiography of this right
dominant
system did not reveal flow limiting coronary artery disease. The
LMCA
was normal. The LAD had mild disease. The LCx was small without
disease.
The mid-RCA had a 40% stenosis.
2. Resting hemodynamic measurement demonstrated moderately
elevated left
and right sided filling pressures with an LVEDP of 25mmHg and
RVEDP
24mmHg. An accurate PCWP was not obtainable after several
attempts. The
mean PAP was severely elevated at 62 mmHg. Simulatenous pressure

measurement in the LV and aorta demonstrated a mean 39mmHg
gradient. The
calculated fick cardiac index was preserved at 2.3 l/min/m2.
3. Valvuloplasty was performed.  We exchanged for a 8F sheath
with a
Amplatzer super stiff wire in LV and advanced a 20mm Tyshak 2
balloon.
With RV pacing at a rate of 160 we performed 4 inflations
manually with
a 30cc syringe.  The balloon would not fully inflate prior to
being
pushed into aorta but [**Location (un) 109**] did improve from .5 to .64 and peak to
peak
gradient fell by 20mmHG.  Heparin was used for anticoagulation.
4. Angioseal of the 8F RFA arteriotomy.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
2. Critical AS
3. Severely elevated left and right sided filling pressures.
4. Severe pulmonary hypertension.



Brief Hospital Course:
In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.3, P 95, BP 114/52, R 24, 94%RA
O2 sat. EKG with ST depression in V5-6 c/w strain pattern, and
CXR c/w pulm edema and LLL infiltrate. She was given nebs,
levaquin and CTX. She became hypotensive intermittently to SBP
86/60 and got 250 NS b/c low BPs. Oxygen requirement increased
to 97% on 4L NC. She did not get lasix given hypotension.  She
was admitted to the MICU and reported feeling somewhat better.
She denied any chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, fever,
chills, cough, sputum production, dysuria, or sick con
