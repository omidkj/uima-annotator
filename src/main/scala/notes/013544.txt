History of Present Illness:
This pt is a 65 y/o WF w/ h/o RA treated with enbrel (stopped
2-3months ago) on prednisone, pulmonary fibrosis believed [**3-12**]
MTX, chronic bronchitis, 50 pk-year ex-smoker admitted for
hypoxemia. Pt had two admissions in the last 2 months, most

In the ED her vitals were 98 120 113/70 16, oxygen saturation
83% on RA. Pt had oxygen saturaiton in the 80%s with 6L
supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula then up in 90%s with a
non-rebreather mask. Her cxray showed findings consistant with
fibrosis and LUL infiltrate, which is new since last admission.
She was started on vanco and on clindomycin for HAP. Blood
cultures were sent and she was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia.
On transferred to the ICU her vitals were afebrile, HR 107,
145/56, 32, 92% NR.
.
On arrival to the [**Name (NI) 153**], pt appears overall confortable breathing
at mid 20s to low 30s on non-rebreather mask with oxygen
saturation at 100%. She was not using accessory muscles. She has
occ dry cough. Her daughter was by her bed side and while I was
drawing ABG her daughter fainted, falling and hiting her head on
the floor. She loss councious for 5 secs. She was taken to the
ED by EMS for further evaluation.

Of note as per recent pulm note, pt has a hx of pulmonary
fibrosis from methotrexate which she took for a duration of 1
year, approximately ten years ago. She subsequently developed
the exertional dyspnea and states that it has gotten
progressively worse over the past 10 years. She has not returned
to her pulmonologist at [**Hospital1 112**] in two years because she felt her
disease was stable. She does not use her perscribed albuterol or
flovent inhalers.

Brief Hospital Course:
ID: Ms [**Known lastname 101493**] is a 65 yr caucasian female with PMH of RA
treated with enbrel (stopped 2-3months ago), currently on
prednisone, pulmonary fibrosis believed [**3-12**] Methotrexate,
chronic bronchitis, 50 pk-year ex-smoker admitted for hypoxemia

Presenting chest xray showed LUL opacity consistent with an
infectious process. In context of elevated WBC, tachypnea, low
O2 sats, and [**Month/Day (2) **] findings, pt was started on IV antibiotics. She
was placed on non-invasive positive pressure vent because of
poor saturations on air mask. Saturations improved but pt still
very tachypnic with RR 35-50. Decision was made that she could
not sustain this indefinitely and pt was intubated. Before
intubation pt expressed desire to not stay on vent indefinitely
and to be taken off vent if no quick resolution of problem could
be reached. She was intubated and a central line was placed. She
was continued on IV Abx but developed ARDS shortly after
intubation. Also developed acute renal failure. Pressors were
required to support blood pressure. Treated over the next [**6-13**]
days in the ICU with only marginal improvement in her WBC, [**Month/Day (3) **]
appearance, and vent settings. Pt was very hard to ventilate and
required very high levels of PEEP and FiO2 to maintain O2 sats
>90%. Multiple attempts made to wean down on vent settings were
only marginally successful. Multiple vent maneuvers including
inverse ratio were attempted with little improvement in
saturations. After a few days the family started talking about
withdrawing care. The decision to make pt [**Name (NI) 3225**] was made on [**10-25**].
Pt was placed on a morphine gtt with additional ativan for
comfort. All other medications were stopped and pt was
extubated. [**Name6 (MD) 23835**] and MD [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 22157**]. Pt became aystolic at
1733 and was pronounced dead at 1740 [**2126-10-25**] from hypoxic
respiratory failure due to pneumonia. Family declined autopsy.
