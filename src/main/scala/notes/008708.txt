Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins / Shellfish

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 465**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxic respiratory failure, intubated in ED.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation, central line, art line, dialysis

History of Present Illness:
31 year old male with ESRD secondary to membranous
glomerulonephritis, recent admission from [**8-30**] - [**2161-10-7**] for
aortic valve MSSA endocarditis/abscess presumed secondary to HD
line infection, course complicated by post-operative aortic root
abscess requiring homograft/redo AVR, and bilateral subclavian
DVTs for which he is on coumadin, who presented to the ED this
a.m. complaining of 3 days of shortness of breath, and 1 day of
severe chest pain with inspiration.
.
Initial history was obtained through discussions with ED
physician and via the chart, as the patient has been intubated.
Per their report, the patient denied recent fevers, chills, or
cough. He has had shortness of breath over the last 3 days, as
well as severe pleuritic left sided chest pain since yesterday.
He reports non-bloody diarrhea over the last few days. Of note,
he had a low grade fever at HD 2 days prior to admission at
which time blood cultures were sent. [**1-18**] bottle is growing
coagulase positive staph.
.
On arrival to the ED, vitals were 99.6, 135/101, HR 100, RR 40,
87% on RA. He was placed on a NRB with O2 sat in the low 90s,
however he continued to be tachypneic, with severe pleuritic
chest pain. He was started on BIPAP, which he did not tolerate,
despite a trial of ativan to help relax him. He pulled off the
BIPAP, with O2 sats falling to the mid-80s, with persistent
tachypnea, therefore he was intubated. Of note, his O2 sat was
around 20% for a couple of minutes peri-intubation. After
intubation, he seemed to be quite dysynchronous with the
ventilator, requiring fentanyl, versed, and propofol to achieve
synchrony. He was hemodynamically stable throughout.
Post-intubation ABG on 100% FiO2 was 7.35/35/77.
.
CXR revealed bilateral infiltrates. He was given vancomycin 1
gram, ceftriaxone 1 gram, and azithromycin 500 mg all x 1.
.
Labs were notable for hyperkalemia (6.2) for which he was given
kayexalate, HCO3, insulin, and D50. He was seen by renal who
plan to do hemodialysis urgently.

Brief Hospital Course:
***PLEASE NOTE PATIENT LEFT AMA PRIOR TO INR BEING IN GOAL RANGE
OF [**2-20**]***
.
31 year old male with ESRD secondary to membranous
glomerulonephritis, recent aortic valve MSSA
endocarditis/abscess presumed secondary to HD line infection,
course complicated by post-operative aortic root abscess
requiring homograft, and bilateral subclavian DVTs for which he
is on coumadin, who presented to the ED this a.m. with dyspnea,
pleuritic chest pain, found to have hypoxic respiratory failure
secondary to bilateral lobar pneumonia, and sepsis in the
setting of recently positive blood culture at dialysis.
.
1) Hypoxic respiratory failure/Pneumonia/ARDS: Likely secondary
to pneumonia but also may have element of alveolar hemorrhage.
The patient was managed with vent settings to minimize lung
injury according to the ARDSnet protocol. After self extubation,
he was maintained on supplemental O2 by NC, and over the rest of
his hospital course, he had stable and improving lung function.
He did experience transient desaturation and tachypnea during
his stay on the floor but this was secondary to volume overload
due to receiving several units of blood prior to undergoing
dialysis.
.
# MSSA Septicemia: [**6-23**] blood culture bottles from [**12-5**], [**12-7**]
positive, with HD catheter tip positive as well. Surveillance
cultures from [**12-8**], [**12-8**], [**12-10**] NGTD. Staph aureus bacteremia
concerning for seeding of prosthetic AVR but TEE showed no
evidence of endocarditis and no abscesses seen on CT torso. ID
followed him throughout his stay and will see him as an
outpatient in clinic when he finishes his 6 week course of
nafcillin.
- On nafcillin 2gm IV Q4h since [**12-9**] (planned for 6 week
course) and completed gentamicin 35 mg IV Q48H through [**12-12**].
- has picc line in place for IV nafcillin as outpatient.
.
# Anemia: The patient had an acute anemia to 25 secondary to a
left thigh hematoma and adductor/obturator bleed after placement
of a L groin HD catheter. He received several units of blood and
the hct stabilized after 2 days. He is also on epogen with HD
chronically for a chronic anemia.
.
# ESRD: The patient has a LUE AVF, but it has apparently clotted
off. Renal placed left femoral HD line, but complicated by left
leg hematoma, now resolved. Femoral cath was pulled [**2161-12-15**]
after tunnelled cath was placed in the RSC.  He will be on
T/Th/Sat schedule upon discharge via tunnelled cath placed in
RSC.  We continued renagel, nephrocaps, epogen with HD.
.
# Anticoagulation: Currently on a heparin gtt bridge to coumadin
with INR goal of [**2-20**] for bioprosthetic AVR and subclavian clots.
The patient's INR was only at 1.8 when he left AMA. He was urged
to follow up as an outpatient with his primary care physician to
have his INR checked and his coumadin adjusted accordingly.
.
# Pancreatitis: Mr. [**Known lastname 11041**] began having abdominal pain on HD 2
and was noted to have an amylase of 308, lipase of 250. He was
made NPO and his pain has subsided with morphine. Abd US
