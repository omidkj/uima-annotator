Brief Hospital Course:
Following intubation, the patient became hypotensive; he
required treatment with pressors after IV fluids failed to raise
his BP.  He received solumedrol as a treatment for COPD
exacerbation.  He was started on a course of levofloxacin,
ceftriaxone, and vancomycin for presumed septic shock.  A head
CT was negative.  Also, he ruled out for both an MI and PE.  His
variable blood glucose was managed with an insulin drip, and his
mental status improved.
The patient??????s chest CT scan showed RUL and LLL consolidation
consistent with infection.  Also, a rounded density was present
anterior to the anterior
segmental branch of the right upper lobe pulmonary artery,
representing
either an area of atelectasis/consolidation or a mass lesion.
(Follow up chest CT is recommended.)  He was switched to
antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and Zosyn for a possible
aspiration PNA on [**12-13**].  His sputum, urine, and sacral wounds
were all cultured, with the following results:
[**12-13**] Blood cx: diptheroids [**1-19**]; Staph coag negative [**2-19**].
[**12-14**] U cx contaminated; sputum gram-stain consistent with oral
flora, cxgrows rare yeast and negative for Legionella; wound
swabs rare growth of GNRs, diptheroids, Pseudomonas, both coag
positive and negative Staph, probable enterococcus, Proteus.
He was extubated on [**12-16**] and transferred to the medicine
service.
The patient had a mild tremor while in the ICU and was seen by
neurology when he reached the medicine service, who diagnosed
him with a physiologic, non-Parkinsonian tremor most likely
secondary to albuterol or steroids.  The patient was also seen
by a speech and swallow consult, who cleared him for a full
diet.
The patient was weaned off his oxygen requirement over 3 days
without difficulty.  His IV antibiotics were transitioned to PO
levofloxacin, and he continued a steroid taper for his COPD
exacerbation.  Of note, the patient's HCT was noted to range
between 24 and 27 on the floor, a marked decrease from 42 on
admission.  His stools were guiac negative, and iron studies
were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.  He had no clear
source for any bleeding.  The patient received 1U of blood the
day before discharge and had a stable HCT at 27 on the day of
discharge.
Throughout his hospital stay, the patient's sacral ulcers were
followed by plastic surgery.  The patient will follow up with
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of plastic surgery as an outpatient.  Of note, a blood
cx from [**12-17**] is still PND.
