Chief Complaint:
Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
# Right total hip arthroplasty
# Blood transfusion


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 83788**] is a 73 year-old woman now status-post hip
replacement being transferred to the cardiology service for
continued evaluation of hypotension.

Was initially admitted on [**1-17**] for right hip replacement.
Post-operatively, at ~06:40 her systolic blood pressures fell to
the high 80s systolic by aline (90s by cuff); she was
asymptomatic at that time.  In response to the BP and a HCT of
27.4, she was transfused 2 units of pRBC.  Also received two
250cc bolus of IVF.  She was evaluated by the cardiology team
who found that her BP was improved (109/45) with a PA pressure
of 37/16 and a wedge of 13mmHg.

Currently, she is feeling well and is without complaint.  She
walked with PT and feels strong.

ROS:
(+) weight loss (100 lbs a few years back; since then, stable)
(-) fevers/chills
(-) CP/SOB/palps
(+) urinary frequency (chronic); no dysuria
(+) shoulder pain (chronic)
(+) calf pain, right (chronic)

All other ROS negative.

Vitals - BP 99/70, HR 70, RR 18, 100% on room air
General - Lying in bed, comfortable.
Eyes - Anicteric; no pallor
[**Year (4 digits) 4459**] - Right neck bandaged; no carotid bruits noted
CV - Sounds regular; systolic murmur heart loudest at RUSB but
noted throughout including at apex; S2 heard; no radiation to
carotids
Pulm - Clear; no rales/wheeze
Abdomen - Soft; non-tender
Ext - Warm; right hip bandaged with edema noted; trace bilateral
lower extremity edema; DP pulses palpable bilaterally
Integument - No rashes
Neuro - Alert and oriented; able to provide clear history.
Strenght exam somewhat limited by pain.  Left arm and leg appear
to have full strength; right arm is limited by pain, especially
at shoulder.  Right leg also limited given post-operative hip
Psych - Appropriate

.
[**1-17**] TEE (intra-operative):
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed (LVEF= 30 - 35 %). Basal segments contract
well, but all mid-segments are HK, and the apex is akinetic.
There is moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area
<0.8cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild to moderate ([**2-10**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Pacing leads are seen in the right atrium and coronary sinus.
.
[**1-19**] TTE:
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with infero-lateral
hypokinesis. RV with borderline normal free wall function. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area
0.9 cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2181-10-16**],
LVEF and RVEF have increased.
.
ECG:  Atrial rhythm is afib; ventricular pacer with QS in lead I
likely due to BiV.
.
Imaging:
[**1-17**] Pelvis:
IMPRESSIONS: Expected post-operative changes after total right
hip arthroplasty.
.
[**1-19**] Hip:
FINDINGS: Complete right hip replacement. The prosthetic
components are in correct position. No evidence of fracture.

Brief Hospital Course:
73 year-old woman with AS (0.5-0.6cm2), sCHF (EF 30%) s/p BiV
PM, and AF, who underwent total right hip replacement this
hospitalization and whose course was complicated by fluid
responsive post-operative hypotension treated with 2 units of
pRBCs.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
.
# Right total hip replacement: At the time of this discharge
summary, an operative note is not in OMR. On discharge the
patient is able to ambulate and there is no evidence of hematoma
at the incision site.
.
# Post-operative Hypotension and Anemia: The patient had an
episode of post-operative hypotension in the PACU and received 2
units of pRBC in conjunction with IVF, with an appropriate bump
in her Hct and resolution of her hypotension. Her Hct is stable
at about 28 on discharge. Repeat TTE was stable.
.
# Post-operative Thrombocytopenia: Patient's plt count was
steadily trending in low 100s post-operatively and the etiology
remains unclear, but it is likely related to intraoperative
bleeding. **Plts will need to be followed after discharge.**
.
INACTIVE ISSUES:
.
# Atrial fibrillation: Remained hemodynamically stable in AF and
rate controlled on metoprolol, unchanged from outpatient dosing.
Anticoagulated with enoxaparin as an inpatient and bridged to
unchanged warfarin dosing on discharge. **INR will need to be
closely followed after discharge.**
.
# Chronic sCHF: Lisinopril was held in the acute setting of
hypotension, but restarted unchanged from outpatient dosing. TTE
as detailed above showed improved RVEF and LVEF.
.
# Hypothyroidism: Unchanged home dosing of levothyroxine.
.
Remained full code for the duration of the hospitalization.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
As above in **.
