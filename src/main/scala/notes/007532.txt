Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7223**]
Chief Complaint:
transferred from OSH for ICD firing for VT

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
39 yo M with PMH of premature CAD s/p CABG in [**2142**] (LIMA to LAD,
SVG to diag, SVG to posterolateral branch of RCA) s/p multiple
RCA stents, s/p ICD for cardiomyopathy and VT, chronic pain and
anxiety who presents from OSH with his ICD firing. He reports
that around noon today, he woke up out of sleep and knew that
his ICD was firing. He does not describe chest pain,
palpitations, or shortness of breath. He called 911 and went to
the OSH. He notes his ICD fired 4 times at home and 2 x in the
ambulance and at least 3 times in the ED at the OSH. He was
given a bolus of lidocaine and started on a lidocaine drip.
Since then, he did not have further episodes of VT.
.
Of note, he describes not having taken his lasix in months. He
was recently discharged in early [**2144-4-11**] with a CHF
exacerbation from not taking his lasix. He says he has not taken
it since he left the hospital either. He denies SOB and says he
can walk several flights of stairs without SOB. He reports that
he does take the rest of his medications including the sotolol
(changed from procainamide during his last admission). He also
describes 3 days of loose stools [**4-14**] x per day. Denies fevers,
chills, abdominal pain. Denies dysuria, hematuria, nausea or
vomiting. He endorses cough with brown sputum for a couple of
weeks; no hemoptysis.
.
Currently, he feels "fine." Denies currently CP, palpitations,
SOB, n/v/f/c. No abdominal pain. +chronic back pain all over.
+claudication symptoms in his lower calves bilaterally.
.
.
*** Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest
pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Reports:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2144-5-20**] 8:20 PM
The heart size is top normal, stable. The post-sternotomy wires
are in unchanged position allowing the technical differences
given the current apical projection of the study. Although the
lungs are clear except for minimal bibasilar opacities
consistent with atelectasis. Note is made that right
costophrenic angle is not included in the field of view. No
appreciable pleural effusion is demonstrated. Left-sided
pacemaker is noted with one of its leads terminating in the
right ventricle. Another lead most likely external or
subcutaneous is noted, changing its position compared to the
prior films.
.
ECG Study Date of [**2144-5-20**]  8:48:24 PM
Supraventricular tachycardia, probably sinus tachycardia. Left
atrial
abnormality. Consider inferior myocardial infarction, age
indeterminate.
Intraventricular conduction delay. Other ST-T wave
abnormalities.
Since the previous tracing of [**2144-4-15**] the rate has increased.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2144-5-21**] 1:52 PM
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-19**], there is again
some enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. There is slight
fullness of the pulmonary markings, raising the possibility of
elevated pulmonary venous pressure. No evidence of pleural
effusion or definite acute infiltrate.
.
ECHO [**2144-5-21**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is
moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF=
30 %). The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are not well seen. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2143-9-25**],
the left ventricular severe systolic dysfunction appears more
global.
.
ECG Study Date of [**2144-5-22**]  8:15:30 AM
Sinus rhythm. Intraventricular conduction defect. Possible prior
inferior
myocardial infarction. Non-specific inferior and lateral ST-T
wave changes. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2144-5-20**] the
rate is slower.

Brief Hospital Course:
39 yo M with premature CAD s/p CABG, systolic CHF with EF 35%,
s/p PM/ICD for VT who presents with VT and his ICD firing. In
addition, he is febrile with fatigue and diarrhea.
.
# VT: ICD was firing and he was found to be in VT. He was given
lidocaine bolus and then started on a lidocaine drip at the OSH.
Here, his sotalol was titrated up to 120mg PO BID, mexilitine
was started, and lidocaine drip was discontinued.  He was
continued on Toprol 300mg qday. He had no further episoded of VT
when on this regimen.  His QTc was 451 upon discharge.  He was
given instructions to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**].
The importance of taking his medications and following up was
stressed in his discharge paperwork.

# fever: His fever to 102 [**Last Name (un) **] concerning for inf
