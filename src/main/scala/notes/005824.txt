================================================================
TTE ([**2-24**]):
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free
wall function. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. There is no apparent aortic regurgitation or
stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Preserved left ventricular
global systolic function. Technically limited study but there
appears to be mild right ventricular cavity dilation and
borderline normal RV function. At least moderate pulmonary
artery hypertension.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2133-2-22**] 8:03 AM
CHEST:

Comparison is made with the prior chest x-ray of [**2-21**].
There has been no significant change since this time. The
opacifications on the left side are again noted and some patchy
consolidations in the left lower lobe are also present.

IMPRESSION: No significant change.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2133-2-21**] 3:42 AM
COMPARISON: [**2133-1-22**].

FINDINGS: There is a large opacity within the left upper lobe
consistent with pneumonia. No effusion or pneumothorax is
present. The remainder of the lungs is clear. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal in appearance.

IMPRESSION: Left upper lobe pneumonia.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2133-2-21**] 3:24 PM
CT CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:

There is dense consolidation involving the left upper lobe and
almost the entire lingula. There are multiple scattered patchy
opacities throughout both lungs as well as small subcentimeter
pulmonary nodules most likely infectious or inflammatory. There
is atelectasis at the lung bases along with bibasilar effusions,
larger on the left.

There is no pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.

There are multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes; for
