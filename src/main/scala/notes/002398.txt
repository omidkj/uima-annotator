Admission Date:  [**2104-4-20**]     Discharge Date:  [**2104-5-1**]

Date of Birth:   [**2029-8-6**]     Sex:  F

Service:  Medical Intensive Care Unit

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypercarbic respiratory failure and
hypotension requiring pressors.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74-year-old
female with a past medical history significant for coronary
artery disease status post CABG x2, aortic stenosis, status
post aortic valve replacement on Coumadin with recent
prosthetic valve thrombosis, status post TPA thrombolysis,
congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of less
than 20% with 2+ mitral regurgitation, and 2+ tricuspid
regurgitation, and history of ventricular fibrillation arrest
requiring pacemaker and ICD placement, now presents from
rehabilitation with acute renal failure and hypertension
requiring pressors.

The patient is status post a prolonged hospital course from
[**Month (only) 404**] to [**2104-3-15**] for non-ST elevation myocardial
infarction requiring a redo CABG.  The patient's
postoperative course was complicated by renal failure
requiring CVVH, worsening heart failure requiring
intra-aortic balloon pump complicated by rectus sheath
hematoma, failure to wean from the ventilator requiring
tracheostomy placement, atrial fibrillation requiring
amiodarone, ventricular fibrillation arrest, requiring ICD
placement, and prosthetic aortic valve thrombus requiring TPA
thrombolysis complicated by ICD pocket hematoma.

The patient was discharged to rehabilitation early [**Month (only) 958**],
however, returned to the hospital from [**Date range (1) 31609**] for ICD
pocket infection with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus
aureus.  The patient underwent removal of the ICD and was
started on oxacillin for treatment of MSSA cellulitis.  The
[**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated by congestive heart
failure and the patient was discharged to rehabilitation on
[**4-15**] on diuretics including Zaroxolyn, Lasix, and
aldactone, as well as oxacillin to complete a three week
course.

The patient was doing well initially at rehabilitation,
however, several days postdischarge, was noted to have
progressively increasing BUN and creatinine (creatinine 3.4,
BUN 106), and hyponatremia with confusion.  The patient's
diuretics were initially reduced, however, the patient's
renal failure was thought to be secondary to worsened
congestive heart failure with a total body volume overload
and ineffective renal perfusion.  More aggressive diuresis
was attempted, however, with minimal effect.  The patient
subsequently became hypotensive and was brought to an outside
hospital Emergency Department, where she received normal
saline boluses, and was started on dopamine secondary to
systolic blood pressures in the 60s.  The patient was
subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital1 188**] Emergency Department, where a chest x-ray revealed
diffuse bilateral infiltrates consistent with worsened heart
failure.  The patient was transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit with hemodynamic instability.

descending artery and saphenous vein graft to the diag.
2. Congestive heart failure with biventricular failure,

9. Status post rectus sheath hematoma.
10. ICD pocket infection status post ICD and pacer removal.
11. Failure to wean from ventilator status post tracheostomy

12. Depression.
13. Hypothyroidism secondary to amiodarone.
14. Aortic stenosis status post bileaflet aortic valve (St.
[**Male First Name (un) 1525**] replacement) complicated by valve thrombosis requiring
TPA thrombolysis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent a very complicated
hospital course.  Was complicated by hypoxic and hypercarbic
respiratory failure secondary to congestive heart failure and
concomitant pneumonia requiring continuous ventilatory
support, sepsis requiring pressors, and acute persistent
renal failure.  A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed on [**4-21**]
for hemodynamic monitoring with evidence of increased
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, decreased vascular
resistance and decreased cardiac output consistent with
concomitant sepsis and heart failure.

The patient was continued on oxacillin for
methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus cellulitis, and
placed on empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics for sepsis of
unknown etiology.  Multiple blood cultures, urine cultures,
and sputum cultures were obtained without growth throughout
the hospitalization.

On presentation, patient was noted to have a lower
gastrointestinal bleed thought secondary to mesenteric
ischemia in the setting of hypotensi
