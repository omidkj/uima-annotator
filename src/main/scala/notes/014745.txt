Hyperglycemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Foley placement

History of Present Illness:
72-year-old gentleman history of mental retardation,
schizophrenia, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia presented
with NSTEMI and was transferred from [**Last Name (un) 4199**] hoppital for
NSTEMI. He was at Senior Living on [**Location (un) 10059**] [**Doctor Last Name **], where his FS
were critically high. EMS was called and measured it at 500. He
was taken to [**Hospital 4199**] hospital where FS 400s. He was also noted
to have an EKG with STD in V4-6 and TropI 7, CK 433, CK MB 34.
He was guiac negative. He received aspirin, Plavix 600 mg, 10 U
reg ins, nitroglycerin paste, lopressor and heparin drip and was
transferred here for cardiology evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial vitals, T 98.5 BP 146/96 HR 100 RR 18 Sat
93/4L FS 371. He was non-verbal and uninteractive, heart was
regular tachycardia and he had 1+ bilateral edema. His oxygen
saturation dropped to 80s on 5L and he was brought to 100% with
a NRB. He had some self-induced foley trauma. EKG again showed
STD V4-6, old q-waves. CXR showed mild failure. KUB showed
non-obstructed bowel gas. He was continued on a heparin gtt and
was given 10 mg IV Lasix. He was also given 1 mg of ativan for
agitation with good effect. He was placed in restraints. Prior
to transfer, VS: BP 150/99 HR 100 RR 18 100% on NRB.
.
Review of systems was not obtainable due to patient's non-verbal
status.


Past Medical History:
Diabetes on insulin with nephropathy
Dyslipidemia
Hypertension
CKD stage 3-4, Cr 1.8-2.0
Schitophrenia
Mild mental retardation


Social History:
He has a case worker. On her most recent visit, he was not
oriented, verbally aggresive, and continued with hallicinations.
He generally refuses care. At his baseline, he generally lies in
bed quietly with very low quality of life.  He is isolated to
apartment and needs asstance with IADLs. He was not considered
safe with meds, because of his poor insight.
His guardian is [**Name (NI) 11923**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], from [**Name (NI) 47799**] MA: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 55097**].
She is the court-appointed guardian. [**Name (NI) **] has two cousins and some
neices who are not related by blood, but none of these family
members can make any decisions with regard to the patient's
health. All medical decisions must go through the
court-appointed guardian.

[**2179-2-20**] EKG Sinus tachycardia. Prolonged P-R interval. Poor R
wave progression. Consider prior anteroseptal myocardial
infarction. Deep T wave inversions in the inferior and lateral
leads may be due to myocardial ischemia. Clinical correlation is
suggested. No previous tracing available for comparison.
[**2179-2-20**] TTE: There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed, with regional variation suggesting CAD (LVEF= 25%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. Moderate
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small
circumferential pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Dilated left
ventricle with severe regional systolic dysfunction, c/w
multivessel CAD. Mild aortic regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension. Small
pericardial effusion.
[**2179-2-20**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Increased pulmonary vascular markings
suggestive of CHF, given the history likely relates to
myocardial infarction. Aorta appears tortuous. No pneumothorax
or pleural effusion. Gaseous distention of the colon.
[**2179-2-21**] KUB: This is a markedly limited film due to the
patient's inability to cooperate with remaining still and
holding his breath. According to the technologist, this was the
best films possible. Gas is seen in the colon, but no specific
diagnosis or description can be made due to the technical
limitations of this film.
[**2179-2-21**] CT HEAD: IMPRESSION: Large hypodensity in the right
occipital lobe, of undetermined age, could be of subacute
nature. Periventricular white matter densities, likely due to
chronic small vessel ischemic changes. No acute hemorrhage.
[**2179-3-10**]: ECG: Sinus rhythm. Left axis deviation. Left anterior
fascicular block. Marked repolarization abnormalities with QS
deflections in anterior precordial leads consistent with prior
anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2179-2-21**] multiple abnormalities as previously noted
persist without major change.

Brief Hospital Course:
72 year old man with HTN, HL, DM, CKD, non-verbal from
schitzophrenia and mental retardation presenting with NSTEMI and
hyperglycemia.
.
# NSTEMI: EKG and cardiac enzymes were consistent with NSTEMI.
The patient was not consentable for cardiac catheterization and
guardian could not be reached at the time of discharge. He was
medically managed with aspirin, plavix, statin, ACEI, low-dose
beta blocker and heparin gtt initially. The patient had apical
akinesis as well as CVA (see below) and was started on warfarin,
so heparin gtt was discontinued.  He was initially maintained on
warfarin, ASA, plavix for anticoagulation.  He was also placed
on PPI for GI prophylaxis.  Echocardiogram showed EF of 25% and
apical akinetic area.
Eventually, the patient became increasingly agitated and
noncompliant with his medications. He has not consistently taken
his oral medications over the course of the two weeks prior to
discharge. Because coumadin could not be regularly administered,
and a safe plan for therapeutic anticoagulation could not be
achieved, it was ultimately decided under the guidance of his
guardian that coumadin be discontinued given risks vs. benefits.
Pt should be offered his regulary schedule medications.  If he
refuses, he should not be forced to ta
