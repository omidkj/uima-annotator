Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
CXR PA/Lat [**9-30**]:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there are
persistent
interstitial markings, notably at the bases of the lungs,
potentially
consistent with pulmonary edema. A persistent right basal
opacity has not
changed in size. The opacity could represent pneumonia or
atelectasis. In
the interval, the right jugular line has been removed. There is
no evidence
of pneumothorax. Unchanged bilateral apical thickening.
.
[**2131-9-6**] ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND:
FINDINGS: The liver has a nodular appearance but no focal liver
lesion is identified. There is no biliary dilatation seen. The
portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow. No gallstones are
identified within the gallbladder. The gallbladder wall is
slightly thickened but this is likely due to underlying liver
disease. The midline structures are obscured from view by
overlying bowel. The spleen is enlarged measuring at least 19
cm. There is no hydronephrosis. The right kidney measures 12.0
cm and the left kidney measures 10.5 cm. A small amount of
ascites is seen in the perihepatic space and in the lower
quadrants.
IMPRESSION:
1. Nodular hepatic architecture but no focal liver lesion
identified.
2. Splenomegaly.
3. Trace of ascites.
