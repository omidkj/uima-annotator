History of Present Illness:
Briefly, this is a 58 y/o Vietnamese male with history of GERD
and recently diagnosed mixed small cell/non-small cell lung
cancer, complicated by recurrent pericardial effusions, being
transferred from CCU to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for initiation of chemotherapy.
.
His workup started on [**6-10**], after his PCP ordered [**Name Initial (PRE) **] CXR for
chronic cough, weight loss, chest burning and dyspnea. The CXR
showed left hilar mass and left upper lobe consolidations, and
the patient was referred to the ED. CT chest revealed a large
spiculated left lung mass, bulky necrotic mediastinal and left
hilar lymphadenopathy, bilateral pulmonary nodules, pericardial
effusion and pericardial mass. He was subsequently admitted for
one week, during which time he underwent pericardiocentesis for
effusion with tamponade physiology, and bronchoscopy with biopsy
revealing a mix of small cell and non-small cell lung carcinoma.
He was ultimately discharged with PCP and thoracic oncology
follow up.
.
On [**7-2**], the patient re-presented with ongoing dry cough, chest
pain, dyspnea, weight loss, and swelling of his left arm, neck
and face. Pulsus was measured at 10, and bedside echo showed
recurrent effusion. He was taken to the cath lab for urgent
pericardiocentesis and drain placement. Pericardial fluid grew
gram positive cocci, and vancomycin was started. The drain was
pulled, and the patient subsequently underwent pericardial
window placement and bilateral chest tube placement by thoracics
in the OR yesterday. Following the procedures, he self-extubated
and was weaned off pressors entirely. Prior to transfer today,
he had a PICC line placed. Vancomycin was discontinued after his
pericardial fluid grew out coagulase negative staph. Labs this
morning were notable for increase in creatinine from 0.9 to 1.3.
Urine lytes were consistent with perfusion-related kidney
injury. The patient has not been given IV fluid boluses given
SVC syndrome, but is taking consistent oral intake. Oncology has
been consulted and has been planning on starting chemotherapy
with etoposide and carboplatin when the patient is
hemodynamically stable. Prior to transfer from the CCU, vital
signs were 97.9, 113, 94/76, 18, 95% 3L NC.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient does not appear to have
significant discomfort or distress. His ability to communicate
is limited by language barrier.
