MRA ABD: 1. No evidence of significant renal artery stenosis.
Small amount of atherosclerotic plaque within the proximal left
renal artery ( <50% narrowing).

2. Poor corticomedullary differentiation of both kidneys, on
pre-contrast sequences, suggest of chronic renal parenchymal
disease. Clinical correlation is recommended.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Cardiac:
a) pump/CHF: Pt came in with sig vol overload (JVD to angle jaw,
3+ LE pitting edema). Pt was entered in the UNLOAD trial and was
randomized to Ultrafiltration (UF). Over 2 days ~17 L of fluid
was taken off, at 500 cc/hour. Lasix was held while on UF, and
actos was d/c'd (can lead to retention of fluid). However, after
2 days the pt's Cr [**Known firstname **] and UF was stopped. Afterwards, no
further diuresis was attempted and the pt was fluid restricted
while Cr recovered. On [**3-18**] restarted lasix at low doses 20 [**Hospital1 **]
(previously had been 80 tid at home).
Weights: [**3-8**] 129.6 on initiation
.....[**3-9**] 118.9 am
.....[**3-12**] 115.2
.....[**3-15**] 116
.....[**3-18**] 114.8 before discharge.
.
b) CAD- h/o CAD s/p CABG. Pt was continued on a Statin, beta
blocker, and ASA was started.
.
c) Hypertension: On admission to the CCU pt's atenolol was
changed to Toprol XL 50.  d/c'd hydralazine and Imdur, started
norvasc 5 qd initially. Continued valsartan at 80 qday and
clonidine patch was weaned off. As ultrafiltration removed a
great deal of fluid, the pt's BP decreased significantly and as
ARF ensued, her BP meds were taken off and ultrafiltration was
stopped. By [**3-15**], she was having hypertension during the night
so her toprol was increased to toprol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] for more
even-action throughout the day. BP meds were added back on as
kidney function improved and on [**3-18**] valsartan 40 was added back
and lasix was restarted at low dose. Her BP remained high and so
Isosorbide Dinitrate 20 mg TID was started as well as
Hydralazine 50 mg TID. Lasix was titrated up to 40mg daily.
These will be adjusted further as an outpatient.
.
d) Rhythm- Sinus. On tele.
.
# Renal failure: baseline Cr is 1.8-2.0. Creatinine [**Known firstname **] with
ultrafiltration to as high as 4.0 on [**3-13**]. This was likely due
to over-diuresis with the ultrafiltration leading to volume
depletion and pre-renal renal failure.  Her antihypertensive
regimen was also down-titrated as her BP droped with rapid
volume correction. Urine lytes were consistent with ATN. Urine
eosinophils were negative. MRA look for renal artery stenosis
was positive for plaque but radiology did not feel this would be
physiologically signficant. The pt's creatinine trended down to
baseline with time and on discharge it was 2.1. She was
restarted on the [**Last Name (un) **] and lasix which will be adjusted as an
outpatient.
.
# Anemia: Hct dropped from 32.6 on admission to 27 after
admission. Iron (iron 57, ferritin 122), B12 ok. epo level was
high-normal. Thus, her anemia was felt to be likely anemia of
chronic disease. On [**3-14**], she was transfused 1 u PRBC. Hct
bumped to only 29.8. Stool was guiac negative. Subsequently,
however, her Hct improved without further transfusion and on
discharge Hct was 31.2.
.
# Endocrine: History of type II diabetes mellitus and
hypothyroidism. Her admission TSH was 0.13 (on levothyroxine
175) and HgbA1c 6.2. Levoxyl was decreased back to 150mcg.
Actose was held and pt was maintained on Lantus and Humalog.
.
# Depression: pt was felt to have a depressed affect and was
started on Celexa in house. Her mood improved slightly near her
discharge.
