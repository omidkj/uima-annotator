Chief Complaint:
Left Sided Substernal Chest Pain radiating to arm and jaw.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Per-cutaneous Cardiac Catheterization with Drug-Eluting Stent of
Mid Left Anterior Descending Artery.


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 77 yo M with a h/o dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 20%), Afib
on coumadin, s/p BiV PCM secondary to complete heart block, DM,
CRI (baseline 1.4-1.7), PVD s/p superficial femoral artery stent
transferred from OSH for ST elevation MI. Pt awoke this am with
Left sided substernal chest pain raditating to his arm and neck

pacing.  He was hemodynamically-stable, but had exam findings of
heart failure.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergency
catheterization for acute anterior [**Hospital1 **].

[**2177-9-15**] Echo:
The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The
left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (ejection fraction 20
percent)
secondary to severe global hypokinesis with some relative
preservation of the
basal and midventricular segments of the inferior and posterior
walls. There
is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated.
There is focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall of the right
ventricle. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but not stenotic.
Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic
hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion. The
effusion appears
circumferential. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 77 yo M with a h/o dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 20%), Afib
on coumadin, s/p BiV PCM secondary to complete heart block, DM,
CRI (baseline 1.4-1.7), PVD s/p superficial femoral artery stent
transferred from OSH for [**Month/Day/Year **].

1. [**Name (NI) **] - Pt underwent a cardiac cathederization on [**2177-9-14**]
revealing a totally occluded LAD after a small first diagonal
branch.  Two drug-eluting stents were placed in the proximal LAD
with residual distal occlusion.
Pt was started on Integrelin gtt, Plavix, [**Date Range **] 325, and Lipitor
40.
Ace-Inh was restarted and titrated to lisinopril 10 [**Hospital1 **].  His
B-Blocker was restarted on the day of discharge.  BP meds were
weaned back given his recent likely CVA (described below) and
goal was for SBP>130.

2. CHF - DCM w/ PCWP 40 at cardiac catherization.  History of
bivent pacer with EF of 15%.  TTE 2 days post revascularization
showed EF 20% w/ severe global hypokinesis.  He was diuresed
with Natrecor x24 hours and remained euvolemic off of the drip
for >72 hours prior to discharge.  He will continue lasix at
rehab/home on a prn basis.

3. Probable CVA - on HD#2 patient developed acute onset of
mental status changes, primarily involving word finding
difficulties and slow/slurred speech.  He was evaluated by the
stroke team who also noted mild weaknees in right UE.  Lysis was
considered, however, given his recent cath and elevated PT from
anticoaggulation for Afib, this was felt not to be an option.
He had two negative CT of the Head.  An MRI was contraindicated
given his pacemaker.  He will need to have a CTA of the brain
sometime in the futuer as an outpatient.  He mental status
gradually improved during the hospitalization, but never
returned to baseline.  He was seen by speech and swallow and
felt to have no acute needs.  Cartoid U/S was not repeated given
examination in [**1-16**].  Although not definitive, it was felt that
he had a minor ischemic CVA as a complication of his MI.

4. Afib- Heparin started HD#2, turned off after MS changes but
restarted once CT Head w/o evidence of bleed. Overlapped with
Coumadin with Goal INR 2.0-3.0.  His INR was 3.3 on date of
discharge and he was instructed to hold coumadin until INR <3.0.

5. ARF on CRF - creat bumped from 1.5 -> 2.1 with diuresis.
Once stopped, creat normalized at 1.6 (baseline).

6. COPD - stable on MDIs.  Likely partially responsible for
elevated pulmonary pressures at catherization.

7. Dispo - PT worked with patient on at least one occasion and
felt he was not safe for home.  He was stubborn and initially
refused rehab, but eventually was agreeable.  He will be d/c'd
to [**Hospital1 **] TICU where his Cardiologist will be able to
participate in his care.
