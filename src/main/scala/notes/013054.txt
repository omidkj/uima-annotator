Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2103-6-25**] Bentall procedure with a 29-mm [**Company 1543**] Freestyle graft
   with coronary button reimplantation, serial number [**Serial Number 89920**]. Ascending aorta and hemi arch replacement
with a 28 mm Vascutek Dacron tube graft using deep hypothermic
circulatory arrest.
Full left-sided and right-sided Maze procedure using the
AtriCure Synergy bipolar RF device with a combination of the
CryoCath. Patent foramen ovale closure.


History of Present Illness:
67-year-old woman has been followed for many years for a
bicuspid aortic valve and ascending aortic aneurysm. In [**Month (only) 1096**]
[**2102**], she was referred for echocardiogram. At the time, she was
noted to be in new atrial fibrillation.
Coumadin was not initiated d/t her aneurysm. She has been
maintained on full strength aspirin. Echo from [**2102-12-20**]
showed trace to mild aortic insufficiency with an aortic
diameter of 4.6cm. CT on [**2103-3-14**] has revealed that her ascending
aorta is approaching 5cm. She has since undergone consultation
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] and was referred for cardiac catheterization to
further
evaluate. She was found to have no coronary disease.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Depressed LAA emptying velocity (<0.2m/s) Probable
thrombus in the LAA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. Bidirectional shunt
across the interatrial septum at rest. Small secundum ASD.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal regional LV
systolic function. Low normal LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Moderately dilated aorta at sinus level. Moderately
dilated ascending aorta
AORTIC VALVE: Bicuspid aortic valve. Moderately thickened aortic
valve leaflets. Mild (1+) AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The rhythm appears
to be atrial fibrillation. Results were personally reviewed with
the MD caring for the patient.
Conclusions
Prebypass
The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is depressed
(<0.2m/s). A probable thrombus is seen in the left atrial
appendage. There is a bidirectional shunt across the interatrial
septum at rest. A small secundum atrial septal defect is
present. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
moderately dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is
moderately dilated. The aortic valve is bicuspid. The aortic
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 914**]
was notified in person of the results on [**2103-6-25**] at 845 am
Post bypass
Patient is in sinus rhythm and receiving an infusion of
Phenylephrine and Epinephrine. RV function is moderately
depressed which improved somewhat with Epinephrine. LVEF= 40%.
The inferior wall appears significantly depressed. There is a
bioprosthetic valve seen in the aortic position. The valve
appears well seated and the leaflets move well. There is no
aortic insufficiency. There is 2+ mitral regurgitation. The left
atrial appendage has been ligated. No flow detected across the
inter atrial septum.



Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 7493**] was admitted same day surgery and was brought to the
operating room for bental, hemiarch replacement, MAZE, left
atrial appendage, and patent foramen ovale closure.  See
operative report for further details.  She received cefazolin
for perioperative antibiotics and was transferred to the
intensive care unit for post operative management.  She required
epinephrine and neosynephrine for hemodynamic support.  She
remained intubated overnight for hemodynamic management and
weaned off epinephrine post operative day one.  She was weaned
from sedation, awoke neurologically intact, and was extubated on
post operative day one.  She remained in the intensive care unit
for rhythm monitoring requiring epicardial pacing for junctional
rhythm and phenylephrine for blood pressure management.
Physical therapy worked with her on strength and mobility. By
post-operative day 11 she was ready for discharge to rehab.  All
follow-up appointments were advised.
