Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2751**]
Chief Complaint:
OSH transfer, inability to extubate

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Extubation (intubated at OSH)
PICC placement


History of Present Illness:
This is a 55 year old female with PMH of extensive psychiatric
disease including bipolar disorder and depression requiring
multiple psychiatric hospitalizations, polysubstance abuse,
hypothyroidism, hypertension, COPD, h/o pulmonary embolism in
[**2123-2-15**], rheumatoid arthritis vs. lupus, DM2, and obesity
presenting in transfer from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for failed attempt at
extubation. She originally presented on [**3-17**] to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with
altered mental status. Days prior to presentation, her husband
reported that he noted increased agitation and delirium at home.
He was suspicious that she had been drinking or using illicit
drugs. She was also noted to have repetitive movements, but was
still able to communicate and was aware of her symptoms. Her
husband said that she was using her inhalers more than usual and
had been vomiting at home. On the day of her admission she was
seen walking naked, was agitated, and combative. She was
intubated on admission [**3-17**] at OSH for airway protection. Tox
screen there was negative on admission, although going theory
was that she was intoxicated.
She developed fevers in the ICU shortly after admission up to
102.7 on [**3-18**]. She was initially started on vanco,
ceftriaxone, and acyclovir. An LP was performed and was negative
for signs of infection. Head CT on [**3-19**] revealed no
hemorrhage or infarction, but there was marked soft tissue
change filling the posterior aspect of the nasopharynx and
posterior aspect of the nasal cavity. There was marked mucosal
thickening in the ethmoid air cells.
Flu test was negative and one of two sets of blood cultures was
positive with coagulase negative staph species believed to be a
contaminant. On [**3-20**], patient was noted to have increased
secretions through ET tube and CXR showed LLL infiltrate.
Vanco/CTX was started for pneumonia and the patient remained
intubated.
On [**3-22**], she passed her SBT in the morning and seemed to be awake
and following commands. However, after extubation she was noted
to be obtunded and was having repetitive head movements and was
not following commands. Given that she was unable to clear
secretions, she was once again intubated for airway protection.
She continues to be febrile to 100.8 upon transfer and has been
hypotensive to 90s systolic and tachycardic to 110s. She was not
on pressors.
On the day of transfer, she once again passed her SBT with an
ABG on pressure support of 10 was 7.37/43/93 on FiO2 of 45%. She
had a CT chest prior to transfer showing LLL and posterior left
upper lobe alveolar infiltrates due to pneumonia and/or
pulmonary edema. Despite improvement in respiratory status,
there was concern for ongoing mental status change. She has been
off her psych meds and has been on propofol for 6 days. There
was concern for accumulating effects of propofol and the patient
was transferred due to shortage on benzodiazepines and inability
to change mode of sedation at OSH. An MRI could also not be
performed there because the vent was incompatible with their MRI
machine.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient appeared uncomfortable on
minimal sedation and was flailing her arms. She became more
comfortable once her propofol drip was restarted.

Notable OSH imaging:
CXR [**3-23**]- Right sided PICC in right atrium, could likely be
pulled back several centimeters. LLL infiltrate, bilateral
perihilar crowding. Evidence of volume overload.
.
CT chest w/ contrast [**3-23**]- Per OSH read: LLL and posterior left
upper lobe alveolar infiltrates due to pneumonia and/or
pulmonary edema. Small left and right pleural effusions. COPD.
Nonspecific mildy prominent mediastinal lymph nodes with a
slight interim increase in size of a subcarinal node compared to
the prior CT.
.
EKG: Sinus tachycardia at 103

Notable [**Hospital1 18**] imaging:
Admission CXR:
FINDINGS: No previous studies for comparison.
There is a right-sided PICC line with distal lead tip is in the
right atrium. This could be pulled back 3-4 cm for remarkable
placement. The side port of nasogastric tube is below the
gastroesophageal junction. The tip of the endotracheal tube is 3
cm above the carina. There is increase in pulmonary interstitial
markings suggestive of pulmonary vascular edema. There are more
confluent opacities within the left mid and lower lung fields,
which may represent asymmetric pulmonary edema or developing
consolidation.

ECHO: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally no
