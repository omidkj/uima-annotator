Chief Complaint:
Transfer for cardiac catheterization

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old man with known CAD, s/p BMS to LAD in [**2104**] and s/p
BMS to RCA in [**2-/2110**] presents for cardiac catheterization. Per
report, pt had 2 "NSTEMI"s in the last 6 months, but has refused
cardiac caths until now. Most recently, he was admitted to
[**Location (un) **] with a RLL pneumonia on [**2110-9-6**] and was found to have
leak troponins in this setting. He refused a cath at that time
and was discharged to [**Hospital 41830**]Rehab on [**2110-9-15**]. He has
recently become agreeable to cath and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
today for cardiac catheterization.
.
Patient reports that he has had worsening shortness of breath
over the last 2-3 months. His dyspnea was initially mainly on
exertion, but more recently he has been dyspneic even at rest.
He now has limited ambulation due to his dyspnea. He reports
that he sleeps on 2 pillows at baseline, but denies orthopnea,
denies PND. He has recently noticed bilateral LE edema. He
denies chest pain, palpitations. He does note that he has had
productive cough of clear to yellow tinged sputum for the last 1
month. He denies fevers, dysuria, neck stiffness.
.
He reports that his worsening dyspnea is the main reason that he
has changed his mind about having further cardiac interventions.

.
Given lasix 10 IV x 2 in the cath lab.

Pertinent Results:
ETT performed on [**2110-8-21**] demonstrated : inferoposterolateral
reversible defect. Dilated LV cavity. LVEF 42%.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2110-3-17**] demonstrated:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system

revealed three vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had a
40% distal stenosis. The LAD had a widely patent stent with
diffuse calcific disease to 40%. The LCx had a 100% stenosis in

the first OM with left to left collaterals. The RCA had a 90%
stenosis at the ostium.
2. Left venticulography was deferred.
3. Limited hemodynamics demonstrated an elevated central aortic

pressure of 140/58 mmHg.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
Three vessel coronary artery disease.
.
Cardiac Cath on [**9-24**]:
LAD: Origin and proximal disease with 80% distal lesion in
proximal vessel
LCx: Occulsion of OM1, 70% lesion of ramus
RCA: Severe in-stent restenosis 90% lesion
s/p RCA intervention
.
Echo [**9-6**]
LVEF of 25% with modeate MR, moderate to severe TR and pulmonary
hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
CAD: Multiple cardiac risk factors (DM, hyperlipid, tobacco use,
HTN) and with evidence of diffuse disease on cardiac
catheterization.  He had a prolonged cath with high dye load and
PCI to the RCA and was admitted to the CCU for hydration and
observation.  He was hydrated post cath with D5 and bicarb for a
total of ~1.5 L.  he was managed with ASA, plavix, and statin.
On admission, he was mildly hypotensive to SBP 90s and his beta
blocker was held.  On day 2 of admission, he was restarted on
his beta blocker, metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **].  He would likely benefit
from an ACEi given his CAD and HF with a low EF, however an ACEi
was not started on this admission due to ARF.
.
CHF:  He had an echocardiogram on this admission which showed
severe systolic dysfunction with EF 25%.  He was given lasix 10
IV x 3 for high filling pressures (PCWP 29).  On day 3 of
admission he was near euvolemic and was continued on a PO
regimen of lasix 20.
.
Anemia: His hct remained stable throughout admission. His iron
studies revealed iron deficiency anemia and he was started on
iron.  He will benefit from an outpatient colonoscopy to
evaluate the etiology of his iron deficiency anemia.
.
COPD: He was admitted on prednisone 15 for a COPD exacerbation
from his previous hospitalization.  His prednisone was tapered
on this admission with a schedule of 5 mg every 4 days.  His
chest x-ray revealed a RLL infiltrate, was thought to be a
resolving pnuemonia from his previous hospitalization
([**Date range (1) 41831**]) which was treated with levofloxacin.  He remained
afebrile and clinically without evidence of a new infection.
.
CRI:  His Cr trended up from 1.2 to 1.4.  His acute renal
failure is likely secondary to contrast nephropathy.  He
received post-cath hydration.  He was discharged with
instructions for follow up chem panel.  He should be started on
an ACEi when his creatnine returns to baseline.
.
UTI:  He was also found to have an asymptomatic urinary tract
infection.  He was discharged with a 7 day course of bactrim.
He was afebrile on discharge.
.
BRBPR:  He was noted to have an episode of bright red blood per
rectum.  On exam he had external hemorrhoids which is likely the
cause of his bleed.  His hct remained stable and he had no
further episodes.  He will benefit from a screening colonoscopy.
