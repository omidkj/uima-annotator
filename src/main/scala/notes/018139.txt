Service:  MEDICINE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 59 year old female
with past medical history significant for insulin dependent
diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on peritoneal
dialysis, Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus
bacteremia diagnosed in [**2115-3-12**], hypertension, status
post left hip fracture with left hip osteomyelitis in [**2115-3-12**], Stage III decubitus ulcer, delirium, transfusion
dependent anemia and hypothyroidism.  She is admitted for low
systolic blood pressure of 260/40.  Her baseline systolic
blood pressure is around 80s to 90s.

In the Emergency Department, the patient was given normal
saline which has increased her blood pressure to her
baseline.  One unit of packed red blood cells were
transfused.  Nasogastric lavage revealed coffee ground
aspirate and guaiac positive stool.  The patient was admitted
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit and then the patient was
transferred to the Floor on [**9-20**], after being
stabilized.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Type 1 diabetes mellitus.
2.  End-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis.
3.  Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in
[**2115-3-12**].
4.  Hypothyroidism.
5.  Status post left hip fracture in [**2114-6-11**].
6.  Left hip osteomyelitis.
7.  Stage III decubitus ulcer.
8.  Urinary retention.
9.  History of pneumonia.
10. History of delirium.
11. Transfusion dependent anemia.
12. Hypotension.

ALLERGIES:   To tetracycline, from which patient developed
rash.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   The patient has chronic smoking history but
had quit and has not been smoking.  The patient denied any
alcohol use.  The patient has recently been widowed; her
husband passed away in [**Name (NI) 547**] of this year and she has been
living in the rehabilitation facility for the past three
months.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, vital signs were that
the patient was afebrile; heart rate is 115; blood pressure
is 79/47; 100% on room air.  In general, the patient is
chronically ill appearing, cachectic, lying in bed in no
apparent distress.  HEENT:  Right eye is surgical; pale
conjunctivae.  Mucous membranes were moist.  Heart
tachycardic with a holosystolic murmur at the apex.  Lungs:
Decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally.  Abdomen
soft, nontender, nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.  No
organomegaly detected.  Extremities positive for muscle
wasting.  No edema, no clubbing.  Notable for obvious sacral
decubitus ulcer that is covered by dressing.

LABORATORY:  On admission, the patient's white blood cell
count is 9.1, hematocrit is 30.9, with baseline 32.9,
platelets 256.  Chem-10 is significant for creatinine of 2.9,
and glucose of 469.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  MENTAL STATUS CHANGE:  The patient's mental status has
been waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**].  It appeared to be delirium at times
and clear at others.  The patient had a CT scan done during
her hospital stay that showed a new area of encephalomalacia
involving the right frontal parietal region and the right
occipital region consistent with areas of infarction; those
are new since [**2115-3-12**].  An area of high attenuation
within the infarcted area might represent residual brain
parenchyma versus hemorrhaging to the infarction.

Neurology was consulted and they recommended several tests as
well, including lumbar puncture and other exams.  The
patient's family felt that they did not want to have invasive
procedures for the patient, so a lumbar puncture was not
done.

2.  RIGHT FACIAL DROOP:  Neurological was consulted and per
their recommendations, it is likely to be felt as peripheral
cranial nerve VII nerve palsy.  Acyclovir was recommended,
started on [**9-22**] and will continue for a 14 day course.

3.  HYPOTENSION:  At baseline, the patient's blood pressure
is 80/60.  The patient's blood pressure waxed and waned, but
has been stabilized in the last few days and with rehydration
and encouraging of p.o. intake, we will just keep on
monitoring her and rehydrate her if necessary.  The patient
is on peritoneal dialysis and the fluid level has to be
carefully monitored.

4.  QUESTION OF INFECTION:  The patient was started in
Medical Intensive Care Unit on ....... and Ceftriaxone
intravenously for potential sepsis.  All cultures have been
negative so far and her white blood cell count has been
normal in the past few days and the patient remained
afebrile.  Will just continue monitoring the patient for any
signs of infection given that she has open Grade III
decubitus ulcer.

5.  DECUBITUS ULCER:  There was a question of osteomyelitis.
Plastics was consulted and recommended dressing change from
wet-to-dry three times a day.  A CT scan of the pelvis
revealed that there is no free air and no signs of
osteomyelitis although there is a significant amount of fluid
collection around the left hip joint.

Orthopedics was consulted and they do not recommend drainage
at this point.

6.  PLEURAL EFFUSION SEEN ON CT SCAN:  A chest CT scan was
done and that showed a significant amount of pleural effusion
on both sides.  The patient is not symptomatic.  The plan is
to drain the fluid if patient becomes short of breath or
desaturates.

7.  ANOREXIA/DIFFICULTY SWALLOWING:  Speech and Swallow was
consulted and they stated that there are no signs of
aspiration upon bedside swallow evaluation.  They recommended
a Gastrointestinal consultation.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 679**] performed
endoscopy on the patient on [**9-25**], and had the following
findings:  1) He saw a grade 3 esophagitis in the
gastroesophageal junction and lower third of the esophagus.
Biopsy was done; 2) Ulcer in the stomach body greater curve
as well as ulcer in the distal part.  He also did a biopsy as
well in the stomach antrum.  Otherwise, it shows normal
esophagogastroduodenoscopy to the second part of the
duodenum.  No stricture was seen.

The patient's dose of Protonix as well as add Zantac to her
daily treatment.  The patient's difficulty to swallow might
partly be attributed by the fact that she does not have teeth
and she only had an upper denture which was not even with her
during her hospital stay.  The patient might need a new
denture set as an outpatient.

1.  Auto-immune disease, not elsewhere classified.

1.  Timolol eye drop 0.25% drops, one drop in each eye twice
