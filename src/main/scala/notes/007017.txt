Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Propofol

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 800**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory Distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation/Mechanical ventilation


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a [**Age over 90 **]F with COPD, h/o cardiomyopathy with EF 55%,
paroxysmal afib, recently admitted to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with COPD
flare/CAP who presents with acute respiratory distress. HPI is
taken from records as patient is intubated.
.
The patient was admitted from [**Date range (1) 38893**] to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] for
fever, confusion, and tachypnea. She was diagnosed with COPD
flare and PNA and treated with Solumedrol for her COPD and
CTX/Azithro/Vanco for her PNA. She improved clinically and was
switched to Prednisone and Levofloxacin. According to her most
recent D/C summary, she was due to finish Levofloxacin today and
was continuing her steroid taper. However, this AM the patient
presented with acute SOB. There was no report of CP, n/v. At
[**Location (un) 620**] she was noted to be wheezy, her skin was noted to be
clammy and was on a NRB. HR 160s. She was subsequently intubated
with propofol, which was switched to etomidate/succ after ?
rash. SoluMedrol 125mg was given. Labs at the OSH notable for
Lact 3.7, WBC 19 (no bands), Na 132, Cr 1.2, CK 26, Trop T
0.143. ABG 7.35/54/353 on PEEP5, Fi02 1. Blood cultures were
sent. There were no MICU beds available and was transferred via
med flight. In the helicopter her BP dropped and she was started
on Levophed.
.
In the ED, initial VS T 101.6, HR 144, BP 90/54, RR 13, 100%
intubated. EKG with afib with RVR and LBBB. Levophed was cont
from [**Location (un) **], 2L NS given. Pt given Digoxin 0.5mg IV x1. RIJ
CVL placed. Pt given vanco 1g IV x1, and ? CTX. Afib converted
to sinus, BP improved, levophed was stopped.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient is intubated and sedated, off
Levophed.

Studies:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2164-5-7**]
IMPRESSION: Congestive failure and probable small bilateral
pleural effusions, left basilar atelectasis. Underlying
emphysema. ETT and NGT in place.
.
ECG Study Date of [**2164-5-7**]
Irregular tachycardia - probably atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular response to 138.  Left bundle branch block.
.
TTE (Complete) Done [**2164-5-7**]
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. There is mild to moderate global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 35-40 %). Interventricular septal motion is
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No
aortic stenosis is seen. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The pulmonic
valve leaflets are thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with mild-moderate global hyopkinesis.
Mild aortic regurgitation. Borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
.
HIP (UNILAT 2 VIEW) W/PELVIS (1 VIEW)  [**2164-5-9**]
IMPRESSION:  Fractures of the left inferior and superior pubic
rami.
.
PELVIS (AP, INLET & OUTLET)  [**2164-5-10**]
Three views of the pelvis are obtained and compared to the study
of the day before. Again noted are fractures of the left
inferior and superior pubic rami. The fractures are
non-displaced. Pubic symphysis is congruent. There are moderate
degenerative changes of the lower lumbar spine. Further
evaluation for occult fractures of the pelvis may be better
performed with CT.
.
CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST  [**2164-5-12**], PRELIM
IMPRESSION:
1. No significant pelvic hematoma identified.
2. Multiple left-sided pelvic fractures as noted above.
3. Cystic area seen within the pelvis dependently anterior to
the rectum. Also, soft tissue attenuation focus seen posteriorly
within the bladder. Pelvic MRI is recommended for further
characterization of these findings.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]F with COPD, cardiomyopathy, paroxysmal afib who presents with
acute respiratory distress and afib with RVR.  Hospital course
was complicated by fall with resultant pelvic fracture.  There
was also an incidental finding of pelvic mass.
.
COPD Exacerbation:  Pt was initially hypoxic and hypercarbic at
OSH, requiring intubation overnight.  She was easily extubated
and maintained adequate O2 saturation in the mid-to-high 90s on
2L NC. She received methylprednisolone in the ED, was started on
a prednisone taper in the MICU that was scheduled to end at
rehab. She was continued on her albuterol, ipratropium MDIs and
had no respiratory distress on the floor.
.
Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia:  Pt was also found to have
pneumonia.  Endotracheal sputum was positive for MRSA.  DFA and
legionella were negative.  She was initially started on
vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam, switched to vancomycin
and cefepime, which were discontinued by discharge after 9 days.
Blood cultures were negative. Patient was stasble
respiratory-wise by discharge.
.
Cardiogenic hypotension: Pt was hypotensive in the setting of
intubation and atrial fibrillation with RVR.  Once pt returned
to NSR with digoxin given in the ED, she was quickly weaned off
of pressors.
.
Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation:  She was in a. fib with RVR in
ED and was given digoxin with subsequent conversion.  By
discharge, pt remained in NSR with home bisprolol.  Pt had been
on ASA for anticoagulation with CHADS2 score of 2, but given her
risks of bleeding and reluctance for blood transfusion, aspirin
was discontinued by discharge.
.
Demand ischemia:  Pt had slightly elevated troponins on
admission that trended down with time.  This was likely [**3-10**]
demand ischemia during a fib with RVR as CKs are flat.  Pt had
normal cath in [**2158**].  Pt was continued on lisinopril, bisprolol,
ASA.
.
Pelvic fracture s/p fall:  Pt had a mechanical fall and was
found to have a pelvic fracture.  She was [**Year (4 digits) 6349**] by
Orthopedics and this was found to be an nonoperative fracture.
Orthopedics recommended weightbearing as tolerated, and she will
follow up with them as outpatient.  Pain was controlled with
standing acetaminophen and prn low-dose oxycodone.
