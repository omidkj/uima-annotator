History of Present Illness:
65 y/o male with a h/o RCC (dx'd '[**85**]) s/p right nephrectomy,
evidence of L renal mass since [**2100**], multiple bony mets,
initially p/w path fx of L humerus in [**2100**], with recent
hospitalization [**Date range (1) 25253**] for LUE cellulitis d/c'd on course
of vacn/unasyn, possibly c/b drug rash, presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**1-12**] with dyspnea at rest x 3 days. At admission, pt denied
associated CP/n/v/diaphoresis. In ED vitals: 100.8, BP 229/109,
hr 106. CTA showed moderate b/l pleural effusions, multiple pulm
nodules, no PE. EKG with no ischemic changes. Pt given benadryl
50 mg, lasix 20 mg, lopressor 5 mg, NTP, tylenol, unasyn 3 gmn,
toprol 200 mg, lisinopril 40 mg, and 1 unit prbcs.
.
On the floor, pt. became progressively more dyspneic c RR 40s
requiring 6 L NC to maintain normal O2 sats.  Received lasix 20
IV x 1 and atrovent nebulizer treatment with good response. He
was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
.
In the ICU, patient received 4 units PRBCs, with last 2 units on
[**2103-1-9**]. Hct increased appropriately and was stable for past 18
hours. ICU course c/b acute renal failure, elevated
troponin,congestive heart failure and increased temp to 100.9
while receiving 4th unit of PRBCs.
.
Upon transfer to the floor, patient denies feeling short of
breath. Denies cp, n/v/lightheadness. Responding to questions
appropriately.

Past Medical History:
Past Medical History:
ONC HX:
65-year-old with renal cell carcinoma diagnosed in [**2085**], status
post right nephrectomy. He did well until [**2100**] when he noticed
some tingling in his left elbow. In [**2100-2-6**], he sustained
a left humerus pathologic fracture. Biopsy at the time of
broad-plate fixation showed metastatic clear cell carcinoma. CT
at the time showed two discrete cortical masses in the left
kidney upper pole mass being 3 cm in diameter, lower pole mass
being 3.5 cm x 5 cm, and a sixth rib lesion. After radiation
therapy to the left humerus, he received high dose IL-2 x 1 in
[**2100-5-6**]. He also has received a CyberKnife treatment to his
left arm mass. There had been some suggestion in [**2100-10-6**]
of an increase in size of the left upper pole tumor. In
[**2101-9-7**], he had minimal asymptomatic
progression of the mass above the left renal vein and the
expansive lesions within the sixth rib associated with a new
soft tissue mass were noted. He began treatment with Avastin off
protocol, starting [**2101-12-5**]. Most recently, he has had
difficulty with metastatic tumor nodules in his left arm. His
Avastin was stopped secondary to concerns of poor wound healing.
 It was also decided to hold off on radiation treatments for
this reason. Since that time, he has been started on Sutent.
.
PMH:
# metastatic renal cell cancer
# hypertension secondary to Avastin and Sutent
# cerebral aneurysm, resulting in lack of smell and taste
# recent admit for cellulitis possibly c/b osteomyelitis

Social History:
50-pack-year smoking history. Quit in [**2100**]. Drinks a few beers
per night, but not as much while on Sutent.


Family History:
No family history of cancer. Parents died of heart disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 916**] is a 65 y/o male with metastatic renal carcinoma
initially admitted on [**2104-1-7**] with dyspnea, hypertension, and
anemia (hct of 18, found to be hemolytic). The pt had a brief
admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], with elevated LFT's and ARF followed by
rash, fevers, and worsening acute renal failure. The pt's course
was then c/b thrombocytopenia and cholestasis and low
fibrinogen, fevers, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, increasing
coags, worsening renal failure, and increasing bilirubin. He was
later found to have a Pseudomonas UTI on [**1-29**] along with a new
rash and sore throat. His complicated hospital course, by
problem is as follows.
.
1. Sore throat
Pt had evidence of well-demarcated lesions in posterior
oropharynx, seen first on [**2-2**]. Differential was broad. Concerns
included bacterial (e.g. Group A strep), viral (CMV, HSV), and
[**Female First Name (un) 564**] esophagitis. He was maintained and subsequently
discharged home on Nystatin S&S. His throat lesions improved
everyday and were much better by the time of discharge.
.
2. Rash
A new rash developed on [**12-12**], morbilliform, blanching,
similar in appearance to previous rashes (he has had several
during the admission). Most likely drug-related
(aztreonam/meropenem/ethacrinic acid) vs. transfusion related
(was transfused on [**2-1**]). He was afebrile. Per ID
recommendations, aztreonam was changed to ciprofloxacin
(Pseudomonas is pan-sensitive). Urine eosinophils rare positive,
but normal eosinophil count in differential. He was sent home to
complete a 2 wk course of ciprofloxacin.
.
3. Anemia
Thought to be hemolytic anemia vs. bone-marrow suppression. No
evidence of bleeding (stools, other than the ones on admission,
have been guaiac negative). Presented with hemolytic anemia
(likely hapten-mediated given beta-lactam exposure), but no
evidence of hemolysis (normal haptoglobin, normalizing LDH and
bilirubin
