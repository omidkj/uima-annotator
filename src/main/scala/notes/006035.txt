Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization
Pulmonary Intubation x2


History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 23099**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old man with a history of severe CAD s/p
CABG x 2 and multiple PCIs, dCHF, DM, and CKD who presents with
respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and cannot provide
history; his wife is at bedside.

He was recently discharged from rehab on [**2171-10-18**] after a two
week recent ([**2171-9-7**]) admission at [**Hospital1 18**] for decompensated
heart failure complicated by ARF in the setting of bumex
diuresis.  He was doing well at rehab for the past one week at
home  until this morning when he woke up with shortness of
breath. He saw his cardiologist three days prior to arrival and
he was noted to be in stable health. Baseline weight was
reported as 129 lb.  He had no CP, fevers, myalgias, nausea, or
vomitting.

He called EMS and on arrival, he was noted to be in significant
respiratory distress, using accessory muscles to breath.  No
vital signs are recorded in the EMS notes but his respiratory
distress was worsening and he did not respond to ambu bagging.
He was intubated in the field.  Nitro paste was also applied and
he was given lasix 80 iv x 1.

In the emergency department, VS were 96.9 135/64 68 and he was
satting 100% on AC 500 x 18, peep 5, fio2 40%.  His CXR was
consistent with acute heart failure. His gas showed 7.35/55/414
on the above settings. He was also empirically treated for
consern of PNA with vanc, levo, and zosyn. His ECG did not show
signs of ischemia and he was also given [**Hospital1 **].  The nitro paste
was removed for SBPs in the 100s. During his stay in the ED he
put out 500 cc of urine.  He is being admitted to CCU for
further management.

On review of systems, as discussed with patient wife, the
patient had complained of some lower extremity edema but no
chest pain, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools, fevers, chills or rigors.

IMAGING:
[**2171-10-25**] ECHO:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis. Doppler
parameters are most consistent with Grade I (mild) left
ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. There are three aortic
valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area
1.0-1.2cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2171-9-2**],
the degree of aortic stenosis has increased. The prior echo did
not mention the presence of aortic stenosis, which was an error.


[**2171-10-25**] CXR:
1. Status post intubation with endotracheal tube terminating 2.2
cm above the carina.
2. Nasogastric tube suboptimally located, terminating within the
distal
esophagus; recommend advancement.
3. Patchy opacities extending from the hila to the lung
periphery
bilaterally, right greater than left, suggests asymmetric
pulmonary edema or an infectious process. Small right pleural
effusion.

COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system was not
performed
given the patients known totally occluded LCx and RCA.
2. Arterial conduit angiography revealed the LIMA to be widely
patent.
The SVG-LPL had diffuse disease with patent stents and normal
flow.
3. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided
filling
pressures with RVEDP 15 mmHg and PCWP 17 mmHg. There was
moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hyperte
