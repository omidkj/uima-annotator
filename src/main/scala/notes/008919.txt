Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Ventricular Tachycardia
Pericardial Effusion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardial window
Chest Tube Placement
EP Study


History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 83 yo man with pmhx CAD s/p multiple stents, Afib,
CHF with EF 15-20% s/p prophylactic AICD [**2173**], HTN,
hyperlipidemia who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for VTac
ablation. Patient initially presented to [**Hospital3 **] [**5-6**] with
slow stable VT and again [**2175-8-25**] with recurrent VT with rates
140s. At that time, he was symptomatic with diaphoresis,
generalized weakness, malaise and dizziness. Denies syncope or
presyncope, cp, abd pain, nausea, vomiting, palpatations. He was
at that time started on amiodarone which was subsequently
stopped for an acute rise in LFTs. In addition, patient noted to
have pericardial effusion and underwent pericardial window at
[**Hospital3 **]. During his stay at [**Hospital3 **], patient had
several episodes of VT and was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
today for VTac ablation. During the procedure, extensive mapping
was done and the earliest activation was found to be -2 ms so it
was deduced that the focus of VT was epicardial so ablation was
not done.
.
On transfer to CCU, initial vs were T 97.8 BP 108/64 (baseline
BP 80-90s systolic) HR 76 R 15 O2 sat 100% 5 liters. Patient
reported that he felt well, denied dizziness, cp, sob, palp,
n/v/abd pain.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], chest tube (s/p pericardial window) was pulled and led
to a right pneumothorax. Chest tube was re-inserted and
pneumothorax resolved over two days. He subsequently developed
episodes of nausea and diarrhea. C. diff was sent and found to
be negative X 3. He also had episodes of hypoxia with O2
saturations in the low 80s. His blood pressure at times
decreased to systolics in the 70-80 range. An echo taken on
[**2175-9-13**] showed a larger pericardial effusion in comparison to an
echo from [**2175-9-7**].
.
He was subsequently taken to surgery on [**2175-9-14**] for a
pericardial window for pericardial effusion and tamponade.
Approximately 1250 cc of fluid was removed from the pericardium
with some improvement in hemodynamics. Post-op, he was taken to
the CSRU. Overnight in the CSRU, he has been on pressors to
maintain hemodynamic stability. He had a couple of episodes of
rapid ventricular response in the setting of his chronic afib.
On [**2175-9-15**], he had drops in his Oxygen saturation to the 80s.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

[**2175-9-16**]

The left atrium is markedly dilated. There is symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. LV
systolic function  appears depressed. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no  mitral valve prolapse. There
is severe mitral annular calcification. There is  moderate
thickening of the mitral valve chordae. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2175-9-13**], the pericardial effusion has been drained.

PLEURAL FLUID: negative for malignant cells

PERICARDIUM PATHOLOGY: Biopsy specimen shows chronic congestion
and inflammatory changes.

[**9-16**] Echo Summary:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. There is symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. LV
systolic function
appears depressed. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. There is severe mitral annular
calcification. There is
moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs
of tamponade.

[**9-17**] CXR
FINDINGS:  A single portable image of the chest is compared to
the prior
examination dated [**2175-9-15**].  Allowing for differences in
technique, there is
no significant interval change.  The supporting lines are
stable.  A left
chest tube is again noted at the left apex.  No apparent
pneumothorax is seen.
Persistent bilateral pleural effusions are noted associated with
bibasilar
opacities.  The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  Mitral
valve annular
calcifications are again seen.  There is perihilar fullness
associated with
loss of definition of the pulmonary bronchovasculature likely
reflects
underlying mild edema.  Persistent subcutaneous emphysema is
noted overlying
the left chest wall.

IMPRESSION:  Stable examination as described above with no
apparent
pneumothorax.

C. Cath ([**9-13**])
COMMENTS:
1- Right heart catheterization was atttempted via the RIJ.
Despite
obtaining access instantly, the guidewire did not advance into
the SVC,
suggesting possible RIJ occlusion.
2- We then performed the RHC via R femoral vein access. Elevated
filling
pressures were noted with mPCWP of 22 mmHg.
3- Moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension (57/37 mmHg).
4- Preserved cardiac index (2.33 ml/min/m2).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Elevated filling pressures.
2. Preserved cardiac index.
.
Liver Gallbladder US ([**9-8**])
IMPRESSION:
1.  Normal liver echotexture, without a focal lesion seen.
However, cirrhosis
cannot be entirely excluded by ultrasound.  There is no evidence
of portal
hypertension.
2.  The gallbladder contains several shadowing stones and
sludge.
3.  Cyst at the upper pole of the right kidney.
4.  Bilateral pleural effusions.
.
CT Chest ([**9-6**])
IMPRESSION:
1.  Moderate to large pericardial effusion, nonhemorrhagic by
measurement with
possible right failure.
2.  Pulmonary hypertension
