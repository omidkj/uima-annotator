Brief Hospital Course:
22yo woman with h/o DM I who presents with DKA.
.
# DKA: Ms. [**Known lastname **] presents with serum glucose > 400 along with
anion gap of 18 consistent with mild DKA. Exacerbation possibly
related to opiod withdrawal as she was just fired from [**Company 191**] and
had her narcotic contract terminated. AG currently normal with
FSBG in 200s and patient did not require insulin gtt. We
continued with RISS SQ and home NPH 28uqAM and 38uqPM on the
floor and her gap remained closed. On the morning of discharge,
the patient began to refuse all care, including her tubefeeds
and potassium repletion. She was given half dose of her NPH for
a glucose of 200. She was advised to initiate her tubefeeds upon
returning to her group home and she understood the risk of not
doing so.
.
# Pruritis: Patient reported to ED yesterday with ?Fentanyl
allergy. This allergy was inserted by the ED physician into [**Name9 (PRE) **]
yesterday. Given this concern, the Fentanyl patch was
discontinued. The patient has a new PCP appointment at [**Name9 (PRE) 336**] on
[**4-3**]. Plan is to start lower dose dilaudid at 2mg q6h to bridge
her until her next appointment as she does not tolerate
Fentanyl. She was discharged with an Rx for 84 tabs of Dilaudid
2mg PO q6h PRN to carry her over until her new PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 648**].
