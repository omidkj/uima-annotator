Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
HPI:  This is a 71 yo female with h/o HTN, hypercholesterolemia,
and recently diagnosed Grade 4 glioblastoma multiforme on bx
(diagnosed on recent admission [**Date range (1) 66203**] after pt p/w L sided
weakness and L facial drip) who presents with a 3 day h/o R
sided chest pain worsened with movement and inspiration.  Pt
denies SOB.
.
In the ED, CTA was performed which revealed PE in the right
middle, right lower pulmonary artery and several right and left
segmental pulmonary arterial branches.  She had no hemodynamic
compromise.  The pt was started on heparin gtt at 1450 U/hr and
was given morphine 1 mg IV x1.


Past Medical History:
HTN x 1 month

Recently diagnosed [**1-11**] high grade glioma c/w glioblastoma
multiforme WHO grade [**2-6**]
MRI Brain [**1-13**]: Enhancing masses in the right parietal lobe,
thalamus, and posterior internal capsule, and hippocampus. The
avidly enhancing appearance and distribution of these findings
are most suggestive of a high-grade glioma such as glioblastoma
multiforme. Much less likely are entities such as lymphoma or
PNET. Lesion in M1 region of R MCA.

Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
71 year old woman with R hemisphere mass lesion, undergoing
metastatic workup.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
grade 4 gbm s/p f p brain biopsy on 2 8 06. now with chest pain
at high risk for PE
MULTIDETECTOR CT SCAN OF THE THORAX (CT ANGIOGRAM PROTOCOL).

RECONSTRUCTIONS: Multiplanar reconstructions in sagittal and
coronal planes are also included.

CLINICAL DETAILS: Right brain mass (glioblastoma multiforme).

CT ANGIOGRAM:

The main pulmonary artery and main right and left pulmonary
arteries are patent and normal in caliber.

Acute nonocclusive thrombus within the right middle lobe
pulmonary artery extending over several centimeters in length
and also in the proximal portion of the right lower lobe
pulmonary artery and at least one segmental branch of the right
lower lobe pulmonary artery at the medial lung base (series 4,
image 80). There are also smaller areas of focal mural-based
thrombus in at least two and possibly three segmental branches
of the left lower lobe pulmonary artery (series 4, image 70 and
image 63). Appearances are consistent with acute pulmonary
embolus.

Moderate atelectasis of the posteromedial aspect of the right
lower lobe with small right basal pleural effusion. Minor linear
atelectatic band in the posterior aspect of the left lower lobe
with minimal rim of left basilar pleural fluid.

No lung lesions or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

Normal heart size.

Subcentimeter ovoid hypodensity in the right thyroid lobe
(series 4, image 9).

No bone lesions demonstrated on bone window settings.

CONCLUSION:
1. Acute pulmonary embolus involving right middle, right lower
pulmonary artery and several right and left segmental pulmonary
arterial branches as described.
2. Moderate atelectasis of both posterior lung bases with small
associated pleural effusions.
These findings were discussed with the referring physician on
the afternoon of [**2196-1-27**].
3. Moderate-sized hiatus hernia.

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS

Reason: assess for residual DVT for planning on anticoagulation
dura

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
71 year old woman with GBM, b/l PE
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
assess for residual DVT for planning on anticoagulation duration

INDICATION: 71-year-old female with GBM and bilateral pulmonary
embolus. Evaluate for residual DVT.

COMPARISONS: None.

FINDINGS: Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of both common
femoral, superficial femoral and popliteal veins were performed.
Normal flow, augmentation, compressibility and waveforms are
demonstrated. No intraluminal thrombus is identified.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the bilateral lower
extremities.

[**1-29**]
COMPARISON: [**2196-1-12**] and chest CT of [**2196-1-27**].

TECHNIQUE: Single AP portable semi-upright chest.

FINDINGS: The lung apices are excluded from the radiograph. The
heart size and mediastinal contours are normal. Since the
examination of [**1-12**], there is new opacity at the right
lung base, likely representing atelectasis and pleural effusion.
The pulmonary vascularity appears within normal limits, without
evidence of vascular congestion. The left lung is clear.

IMPRESSION: Right pleural effusion and right lower lobe
atelectasis versus consolidation. These findings are new since
the [**1-12**] chest radiograph and may be slightly progressed
from the chest CT of [**1-27**].

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 71 yo with high grade glioblastoma multiforme who p/w
extensive PE.
.
#PE:  Pt has PE of right middle, right lower pulmonary artery
and several right and left segmental pulmonary arterial
branches.  The underlying etiology is likely a hypercoagulable
state in the setting of malignancy. She was started on a heparin
gt with frequent neurochecks as with a GBM tumor.  She had
negative lower extremity ultrasounds with no DVTs, neuroncology
was consulted and recommended she be started on life long
anticoagulation with lovenox treatment doses for a pulmonary
embolus.  Her pain was controlled with percocet, and she had an
oxygen requirement of 2LNC at time of discharge. She was started
on her lovenox and bridged by 1 hr prior to discontinuing the
heparin drip.

.
#GBM:  She has a recent diagnosis of a GBM, she was continued on
her keppra and dexamethasone. She was discharged on a
dexamethasone taper
.
#Psych:  She was continued on her ecitalopram and temazepam prn
.
#Hyponatremia: She intially was hyponatremic to 131 likely
secondary to hypovolemia, after fluids were administered she
returned to her baseline levels around 135.

.
#FEN: regular diet
.
#PPX: heparin gtt, colace, protonix

#FULL CODE: discussed with pt and son

She was to follow up with radiation oncology for treatment by
calling [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9710**]
