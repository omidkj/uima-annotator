History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1683**] is a 45 year old female with a history of asthma (no
intubations or ICU stays), DM2 on insulin + metformin, chronic
diastolic heart failure with preserved EF, and tobacco use
presenting with acute dyspnea.  She was just discharged today
after being admitted for similar symptoms.  On her discharge
exam, she had scattered expiratory wheezes, but was not in any
respiratory distress.  There was little concern for pneumonia,
given that the RLL finding has been unchanged since [**Last Name (LF) 547**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
she was not sent out on any antibiotics, only a steroid taper.
She sates that today she had a subjective fever, with wheezing
and dyspnea characterized by chest tightness and a productive
cough. EMS reportedly found her in respiratory distress and
administered an EpiPen. She was placed on bipap and transported
to the ED.

As an outpatient, she was most recently seen at [**Hospital1 **] on
[**2152-9-27**], where she was treated for a presumed asthma
exacerbation with prednisone and azithromycin, as well as her
home inhalers.

In the ED, initial vitals were: 143 147/98 32 100% on BiPAP.
She was not moving air well at all, so she was given magnesium,
continuous nebs, and solumedrol 125mg IV. CXR showed some
evidence of volume overload and ?RLL infiltrate for which she
received levofloxacin 750mg IV.  She was also started on a Nitro
gtt and was given a 40mg dose of furosemide out of concern for
pulmonary edema.  She had been tachycardic since arrival (after
EpiPen) and EKG confirmed this with sinus tach at 140bpm and no
other abnormalities.  Vitals on transfer include RR 30, satting
100% on BiPAP (needed lorazepam to get the mask on her), with BP
143/91.

On arrival to the MICU, she has been taken off of BiPAP for the
ride up and is quite tachypneic and uncomfortable.
