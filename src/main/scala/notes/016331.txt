Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Severe back pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 82798**] is an 88yo woman with h/o  diabetes,
osteoarthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica who p/w NSTEMI. Pt has
long history of low back pain due to her OA and this most recent
episode began on [**2186-7-5**]. Pain was exacerbated by movement,
radiating to hips/legs and so severe that pt could not get out
of bed in AM of [**2186-7-6**]. Pt self-medicated with ~14 percocet
tablets in ~12 hours. At baseline, pt uses a walker and has
chronic pain [**1-30**] arthritis

Pt was taken to [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**] where CXR was suggestive of PNA
vs. CHF, EKG w/ ST changes. Pt was given ceftriaxone and
azithromycin IV for presumed PNA and fentanyl/oxycodone for
pain. Pt also had 15 minutes of substernal chest pain that was
resolved w/ oxygen. Pt was given morphine, dopamine, Plavix
600mg [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 325mg, heparin bolus 4000 units and transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for PCI and further evaluation. Vital signs at
[**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**]: T98.8 HR100 BP121/76 RR14 O2sat 100% RA

Upon arrival at [**Hospital1 18**], pt was taken to cath lab for PCI and
found to have distal left main disease (90%), moderate diffuse
LAD disease, LCX occlusion (90% origin), RCA occlusion (100%
proximal w/ left to right collaterals), LVEF 20% and severe
mitral regurg (4+). During the procedure, pt developed AFib and
BP dropped to 77/56, then 83/58. Pt was given 450 cc fluid bolus
and started on dopamine (5 mcg --> 10 mcg) and amiodarone gtts.
Pt was deemed not a candidate for cardiac surgery and high risk
for stenting, transferred to CCU for close monitoring and
medical management.

Upon arrival to the CCU, pt was continued on dopamine 10mcg -->
5 mcg and amiodarone. Femoral swan and arterial lines were
maintained; pt was comfortable and had no complaints. Per the
family, the pt had a three pound weight gain over the past week
and increasing peripheral edema. She denied PND or orthopnea.

On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
All of the other review of systems were negative. Of note, pt
did not report fever/chills/productive cough.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, palpitations, syncope or presyncope. Pt is relatively
inactive at baseline.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 82798**] was initially seen at an outside hospital before
being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization following
an episode of chest pain and EKG with diffuse ST changes
concerning for left pain disease. Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], she
underwent emergent PCI and was found to have severe three vessel
disease (RCA, left main, left circumflex occlusions). Cardiac
enzymes on arrival were elevated (CK 376  MB72  MBI 19.1  Tr
0.71). TTE demonstrated LVEF 25%. The hemodynamic readings (high
RA, increased PCWP, decreased CO, increased SVR) consistent with
cardiogenic shock. After much consideration it was determined
she was not a surgical candidate and her disease was not
amendable to stenting.  After arriving in the CCU, discussion
were held with the patient and her family and it was decided to
not pursue aggressive medical care.  Rather, the decision was
made to pursue comfort as the primary goal.  Given this
decision, life prolonging medications were stopped.  Ms.
[**Known lastname 82798**] died peacefully with her family at her bedside at 7pm
on [**2186-7-7**]. Autopsy was declined.
