Brief Hospital Course:
63 y/o F with DM who p/w hypoxic respiratory failure,
hypotension found to have MSSA pneumonia.
.
1) Respiratory Failure: Patient was admitted for hypoxic
respiratory failure, requiring intubation. CT chest showed a

on levofloxacin, flagyl, and vancomycin.  Once sensitivities
were available, switched to nafcillin, plan to complete on [**5-5**].
.
2) Hypotension: concerning for sepsis, given presence of
pneumonia, slightly elevated lactate.  Responded well to fluid
boluses, resolution of hypotension, lactate normalized.  No
evidence of bacteremia on blood cx's.  Pt remained afebrile,
without tachycardia.
