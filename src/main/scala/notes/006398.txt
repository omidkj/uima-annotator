Chief Complaint:
tracheal bronchial malacia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
tracheal resection
flexible bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 104111**] is a 66-year-old
woman who had pneumonia in [**2137-2-1**], which required
prolonged intubation and subsequent reintubation for failure
to wean. Subsequently at rehab she developed stridor, cough
and worsening dyspnea on exertion. She was found to have a
full tracheal stenosis measuring 3-4 cm. This was noted to be
approximately 1.8 cm from the cricoid and was 7.5 cm away
from the carina. She did have some distal malacia most
notably in the bronchi.


Past Medical History:
Cardiomyopathy (EF=25% on [**2137-4-9**]), HTN, hyperlipidemia, cervical
cancer s/p TAH, R oophorectomy ??????60s, cholecystectomy, colonic
tubular adenoma s/p polypectomy, obesity, anemia


Social History:
Former ICU nurse, ex-smoker 30 pack year history, stopped 20
years ago


Family History:
non-contributory

Physical Exam:
general: Obese female in NAD.
HEENT: neck w/ incisional erythema and swelling below surgical
incision.
Chest: coarse at the bases otherwise clear
COR: RRR S1, S2
abd: obese, soft, round, NT, ND,+BS
extrem: no C/C/E. right PICC line in place.
neuro: intact


Pertinent Results:
CXR [**5-25**]
Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. There is enlargement of the main
pulmonary arteries suggesting pulmonary hypertension. Multiple
small subsegmental atelectasis and linear atelectasis are in the
right upper and lower lobes and in the posterior segment left
lower lobe. This is unchanged from prior study. If any there is
a small right pleural effusion. Left subcutaneous emphysema in
the neck is better seen in prior CT neck from [**5-23**].

barium swallow [**5-23**]
There is marked subcutaneous emphysema seen in the left side of
the neck and supraclavicular soft tissues on the scout image.
Water-soluble contrast (Conray) followed by thin barium was
administered (with multiple views obtained. Barium passes freely
through the esophagus, with no evidence of a leak. There is no
significant retention in the valleculae or piriform sinuses. No
structural abnormalities are noted in the region of the pharynx
and upper esophagus. There are normal primary peristaltic
contractions.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of esophageal perforation as discussed
with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4129**] on the day of the study.

Ct scan neck [**2137-5-23**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Marked improvement in subcutaneous emphysema along the left
neck. Interval development of soft tissue density along the
anterior midline soft tissues of the lower neck, which may
represent dense secretions versus inflammatory changes. No
simple fluid collection or region of abnormal enhancement is
seen to suggest abscess formation. Interval partial resolution
of increased attenuation along the paratracheal fat in the
superior mediastinum.
2. Multiple small mediastinal lymph nodes, right upper lobe
pulmonary nodule, and reticular/peribronchial opacities in the
right upper lobe, unchanged.
Please see the detailed report on CT Trachea done on [**2137-5-2**]
regarding recommendations for the lung nodules.
3. Tiny 5mm hypodense nodule in the left lobe of thyroid, not
adequately assessed. US of thyroid can be considered.


Brief Hospital Course:
pt was admitted and taken to the OR for tracheal rescetion on
[**2136-5-16**]. OR course uneventful. Pt admitted to the SICU Briefly
on neo for hypotension and for close pulmonary monitoring and
aggressive pulmonary tiolet.  Guardian stitch in place. Pain
controlled w/ PCA.
POD#3 Transfused PRBC for Post op anemia and hypotension. Neo
was weaned off. Pt was transferred from the ICU to the floor and
the JP drain was d/c'd. Echo was done and revealed EF 25% d/t
cardiomyopthy- acute on chronic heart failure.
POD# 4 incisional erythema was noted, low grade temp and WBC
increased to 14- IV vanco was started.
POD#5 wound remained erythematous and mild crepitus was noted.
Abx coverage was broadened to include cipro and flagyl.
POD#6 increased crepitus noted and neck CT and barium swallow
done to eval for fluid collection in the neck and possible
esophageal leak. Both studies were negative.
POD#8 bronch was done w/o obvious disruption of anastomosis.
Cough supression regimen was maximized - guardian stitch broke
and was not replaced. WBC slowly decreasing. Broad spectrum abx
continued.
POD#9 wound erythema improved. Oxygen sats 75% on roomair sats
93% on 2 liters w/ amb.
POD#10 neck wound opened - minimal amt of serosang drainage.
POD#11 d/c'd w/ [**Hospital1 **] dressing changes and IV vanco, po cipro and
flagyl. Will have outpt pulmonary rehab.
