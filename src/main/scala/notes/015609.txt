Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2972**]
Chief Complaint:
CC: slurred speech and left arm weakness after a nap

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right internal carotid stent, [**2102-7-5**]


History of Present Illness:
The pt. is an 85 year-old right-handed man with a history  of
CAD s/p CABG and placement of 3 stents, pacer/defibrillator, and
severe chronic sensorimotor
polyneuropathy, who was in his usual state of health when he
fell asleep for a nap on the day of admission, then awakened a
number of hours later with slurred speech, left facial droop
(witnessed by pt's son), and inability to raise left arm (also
witnessed by patient's son). These symptoms improved over the
course of the 90 minutes between first noticing the symptoms and
presentation.

He had not been ill recently, has had no headache, dizziness,
chest pain, or fever. No known seizures. As at baseline he has
occasional tremors of arms and legs when he sits up from bed and
complains of numbness in the first three
fingers of his left hand, which has been going on for years. The
numbness is worse when he has his elbow resting on the dinner
table. He states that he has been taking all his medications. He
does complain of urinary urgency, so that he has to use the
bathroom about a half hour after he drinks anything. Sometimes
he doesn't actually void, but when he does there is [**Last Name **] problem
initiating and completing urination.

Per OMR, he was neurology service in [**10-3**] for evaluation of a
similar episode, involving dysarthria and truncal ataxia. He was
also noted to have glove and stocking distribution sensorimotor
neuropathy, steppage gait, and
bilateral foot drop. He was diagnosed with Vitamin B12
deficiency (for which he continues treatment) and a probable
midline cerebellar stroke, although MRI imaging could not be
obtained due to the pacemaker.

At the time of my encounter, the pt. stated that he felt that
his speech difficulties and weakness have disappeared.  He
offered no complaints other than frustration that he was
confined to bed.  He denied any further episodes of dysarthria,
weakness, headache.

Past Medical History:
*CABG (quadruple bypass) in [**2083**]
*Stents placed in 3 coronary arteries
*Pacer/Defibrillator Implant

Most recent echo [**2101-10-4**]: Ejection Fraction 25-30%
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the basal half of the
inferior and inferolateral walls, distal septum and apex. The
remaining walls are mildly hypokinetic. No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle (does not exclude due to suboptimal
apical image quality). The aortic root is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-1**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion. No definite cardiac source of embolism
identified. Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of
[**2101-5-31**], septal motion is less vigorous and the distal septum
and apical dysfunction are now apparent c/w interim ischemia.

*Gout
*Glaucoma, Cataracts, Blind in Right Eye
*B/l hearing loss
*Chronic severe sensorimotor polyneuropathy
Report of EMG/NCS from [**2102-6-13**]: Abnormal, complex study.
There is electrophysiologic evidence for a severe, chronic and
ongoing, generalized, sensorimotor polyneuropathy with both
axonal and demyelinating features. There is evidence for
superimposed, severe, median neuropathies at both wrists (as in
bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome); the left is chronic and
ongoing. There is also evidence for superimposed, severe, ulnar
neuropathies at both elbows; the left is chronic and ongoing.
The underlying neuropathy prevents determination of whether
there are superimposed ulnar neuropathies at both wrists.
