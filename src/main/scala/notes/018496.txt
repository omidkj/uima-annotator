[**2107-4-13**] CXR
The focus in the retrocardiac right lower lobe has increased in
size. While this may be indicative of either a slowly-developing
pneumonia or possibly aspiration, possibility of an underlying
bronchoalveolar cell
carcinoma cannot be dismissed. It is likely prudent to obtain a
followup CT scan to compare with the one obtained on [**2-16**], [**2107**] soon as an
outpatient.

[**2107-4-14**] pCXR:
COMPARISON: [**2107-4-13**].

FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
within normal limits. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. In
the right and left lower lobes there is mild tram tracking and
bronchial wall thickening consistent with bronchiectasis. Patchy
bibasilar opacities likely representing aspiration. No pleural
effusion or pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION:
1. Bibasilar bronchiectasis.
2. Patchy bibasilar opacities likely representing
aspiration/aspiration
pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
68 y/o M with a history of COPD who presents with COPD
exacerbation and pneumonia.  He was initially in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on
arrival, transferred to the hospitalist service on HD#2.
.
#. COPD: Patient is currently at basline, on 4L NC. Patient's
last ABG was 7.32/77/65/42 and is consistent with his propensity
to be a CO2 retainer. Patient's mental status was altered while
he was in the ER, and may be related to either hypercapnea or
hypoxia, but was resolved on presentation to the ICU. He is
currently on his home oxygen requirement.  He continued
albuterol and ipratropium nebs, and changed from IV solumedrol
to po prednisone on transfer to the floor.  Given his frequent
steroid requirement, he was continued on PCP prophylaxis with
Bactrim DS MWF.  On the medicine floor, the patient clinically
improved and was discharged on a long steroid taper, completion
of his levofloxacin and his home oxygen at 4-6 liters and
outpatient pulmonary medication regimen.  The patient was
observed to be walking comfortably around the floor for 3 days
prior to discharge.
.
#. Hospital Acquired Pneumonia, RLL: Patient had 5 days of
subjective fevers and chills, has leukocytosis, and has
hospitalization within past three months. Initiated coverage
with Vancomycin, Cefepime, Levofloxacin.  He was transferred to
the floor on just Levaquin, but leukocytosis on HD#3 went from
7K to 26K so cefepime was resumed but subsequently discontinued.
 The patient was discharged to complete a 7 day course of
levofloxacin.
.
#. CAD: Stable.  Continued ASA, Statin, ACE-I
.
#. Glaucoma: Asymptomatic currently  Continued eye drops
.
#. Hyperphosphatemia: On the day of discharge, the patient's
phosphorus returned at 1.3.  The patient had already left the
hospital.  He will need oral repletion with neutra-phos.
