Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 398**]
Chief Complaint:
Failure to thrive

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 40 yo woman with AML s/p related allo-SCT in
[**10-14**] with extensive chronic GVHD who is admitted from [**Month/Year (2) **]
for failure to thrive. She was discharged from rehab last
Tuesday (3 days ago) following her last hospital admission and
ever since arriving home she states that she does not have any
desire to eat or drink. She denies sick contacts and fevers. She
spends most of her time in bed. She used to be able to walk
using her walker to transfer from bed to commode, from commode
to wheelchair, etc, but she has not ambulated since the
beginning of her last hospital admission, almost two months ago.
She denies nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, cough, dysuria,
diarrhea, shortness of breath or chest pain. She denies being
depressed although she endorses most symptoms of depression,
including low energy, depressed mood, anhedonia, hopelessness,
sleep problems, and lack of appetite appetite. Her main concern
is that her husband works at night and cannot help her if she
needs to use the bedpan or the commode. One 15 year old son
helps her, and apparently this is a problem for the patient,
either because the patient is concerned about his back, or
because she does not always get the help she needs, this is
unclear. She has meals served in bed at home. She has a shower
bench, a manual wheelchair, a cane, and a walker but otherwise
no accommodations nor help.
The patient was last admitted one month ago for diarrhea, pain
and leg weakness. This year she also had another admission for
back pain where she was found to have a fracture in T12 with no
cord compression, treated conservatively with TLSO. On that
admission she also had ischemia in the inferioposterior region
of the heart. She last underwent IVIG treatment on [**2122-9-17**]. She
also receives Rituxan. She has a midline in the R arm. She is
following up with an ophtalmologist for treatment of her
cataracts next month.

.
The review of system is mostly positive for pain (mainly back
pain), leg weakness R>L (recent MRI with no cord compression),
and depressive symptoms. She also had a nose bleed while at
Rehab, which was apparently attributed to the nasal oxygen. Also
positive for dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea and difficulties to
see (cataracts).

[**2122-10-13**] MRI THORACIC AND LUMBAR SPINE

Further loss of height of the T5 and T6 compression fractures.

No significant change in the mild-to-moderate compression
fracture of L4 and mild depression of the superior endplate of
L5 as before.

Partially imaged is an enhancing lesion of the right second rib,
which may represent a fracture, but if there is concern for
metastases, this could be better evaluated by either plain films
or CT scan.

[**10-6**] CT SCAN ABDOMEN AND PELVIS

IMPRESSION:
1. No intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal hematoma. Multiple
ventral subcutaneous densities likely represent injection
associated hematomas as described. Many of these were present on
the CT from [**4-13**]. Small left pleural effusion and associated atelectasis. 8 mm
left lower lobe nodular density warrants 6 month followup to
ensure stability or resolution.
3. 5mm left renal lesion to
