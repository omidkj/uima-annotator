Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization X2


History of Present Illness:
67 year old man with h/o of colon cancer )s/p colectomy + chemo
year?[**2119**]), tobacco smoking, COPD, HLD, Glaucoma and dementia
who was transfered from [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Last Name (un) **] to cath lab for diagnostic
coronary cath.
.
Patient was initially admitted on [**7-10**] with chest pain and
shortness of breath.  Chest pain developed while smoking cigar
was retrosternal [**4-9**] w/o radiation and lasted 30 min. Ruled out
for an MI. Nuclear ETT: reversible lateral and inferior wall
ischemia, LVEF 45-50%. Echo showed EF = 45-50% with global
hypokinesis (poor windows). No further symptoms since admission.
On aspirin and Coreg. Did not recieve plavix or heparin. Did
recive topical NG. NPO after light breakfast. Transfer for cath
this PM.
.
Per OSH nursing report: Appears mostly alert and oriented
although he has had some periods of confusion. 95% on room air,
wearing 2 liters intermittently,  afebrile, SR 90-100's, 110-114
/70's.   Has non productive cough.

.
Was transfered to cath light where approached initially right
radial aborted due to narrow artery, procedure done through left
femoral.  80% mid 85% distal RCA, 70% Circ, Left main 20%, LAD
prox 40, mid 40%. Also found 75% proximal left iliac stenosis.
Patient became restless during the procedure, decision was to
defer intervention. Got total 100cc contrast.
.
Of per notes: patient's family reports a history of mild
dementia. Since admission patient has had intermittent
confusion, particuarly noted after receiving sedatives (ativan).
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
- confusion as above
- bil calf pains after walking 3 blocks, resolves with rest. No
buttock pain.
- climbs one flight of stairs and walks 3 blocks w/o SOB or CP.
- paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.
Cardiac review of systems is otherwise neg for paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.
.
On arival to floor patient feels well, denies chest pain.
.

Nuclear ETT (OSH): reversible lateral and inferior wall
ischemia, LVEF 45-50%.
.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM (OSH): EF = 45-50% with global hypokinesis (poor
windows).
.
CARDIAC CATH [**7-16**]: Cardiac catheterisation used a L-femoral
approach, after failed to access narrow R-radial. Diagnostic
component revealed RCA: 80% mid, 85% distal; Cx: 70%; LMS: 20%;
LAD: prox 40, mid 40%. Proximal left iliac was 75% stenosed.
100cc contrast used. Intervention defered due to patient
restlessness.

CARDIAC CATH [**7-17**]: Cardiac catheterisation used a R-femoral
approach. Received dopamine. Rotablated RCA and then placed 2x
BMS. Noted persistent ST-elevations in II, III, aVF.

ECHO [**7-20**] The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal
hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferolateral wall. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 50-55 %). The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with focal basal free
wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is a very small pericardial effusion
anterior to the right ventricle (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]).

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal left ventricular
cavity size with mild regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (PDA
distribution). Right ventricular cavity enlargement with
regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (proximal RCA
distribution).

Brief Hospital Course:
67 year old man with h/o of colon cancer s/p colectomy + chemo
[**2119**], tobacco smoking, COPD, HLD, Glaucoma and dementia who was
transfered from [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Last Name (un) **], found to have positive ETT, now s/p
cath with RCA rota 1.5mm burr with overlapping BMS x2
complicated by hypotension.
.
# CORONARIES: Patient presented with CP likely [**1-1**] angina given
findings on ETT and cath.  Cath showed LMCA ostial 20% stenosis,
distal 3+ calcification, LAD proximal 3+ calcification with 40%
calcification and mid 40% stenosis, LCX had a proximal 3+
calcification with 70 % stenosis, RCA had a 3+ calcification of
proximal, mid 80% and distal 85%. Pt is now s/p rota 1.5mm burr
with overlapping BMS x2 complicated by hypotension briefly
requiring dopamine. Post-op course further complicated by NSTEMI
secondary to distal thrombus. Pt is s/p plavix load and started
on 75mg daily. ASA increased
