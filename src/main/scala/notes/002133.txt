History of Present Illness:
HPI: Mr. [**Known lastname 58053**] is a 75-year-old man with a history of
recurrent bladder cancer.  According to Mr. [**Known lastname 58053**], this was
initially diagnosed in [**2172**] when he presented to the [**Location 58054**] with hematuria.  Cystoscopy diagnosed localized
superficial bladder cancer, and he was treated with
intravesicular BCG.  Then in [**2176**] he had recurrence noted on
screening cystoscopy, and at that time, he was treated with
intravesicular BCG and mitomycin C.  This course was complicated
by severe UTI leading to urosepsis and hospitalization at the
[**Location 1268**] VA.  He subsequently transferred his care to Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 43569**] at [**Hospital3 **] and had another episode of urosepsis in
[**2182**] or [**2183**].  He transferred care to [**Hospital6 58055**] where he underwent TURP in [**2184**].  It was soon after this
that he began to follow-up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9125**] for screening
cystoscopy and treatment for recurrent urinary tract infections.

He reports having had multiple cystoscopies with biopsies.  On
[**2188-6-8**] he was admitted to the [**Hospital 882**] Hospital with
recurrent hematuria with clots, increased urinary frequency and
nocturia, and underwent cystoscopy on [**6-9**], which showed a
1.5-cm papillary tumor on the right anterior wall of the
bladder.
He then underwent transurethral resection on [**2188-6-10**].  The
biopsy showed a high-grade bladder transitional cell carcinoma
with smooth muscle invasion.  He currently has a Foley catheter
in place.  He denies having pelvic pain and admits to a small
amount of low back pain.  Additionally, Mr. [**Known lastname 58053**] was admitted
to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2187-12-27**] and to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] in [**2188-5-25**] with
decompensated diastolic heart failure.  Today, he denies having
recurrent fevers, chills, night sweats or weight loss

Brief Hospital Course:
75yM with recurrent Bladder CA admitted for cystectomy and ileal
conduit on [**2188-8-5**].  Patient went to the OR for Radical
cystoprostatectomy, ileal loop urinary
diversion, bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy.  He tolerated the
procedure well with no complications, but was transferred to the
ICU in guarded condition still intubated.  He had a NGT, RIJ,
ETT, urostomy stents x 2, and a Right A-line in place upon
transfer.  He did require pressors for the first day post-op in
order to maintain his arterial pressure.  He was extubated
without complication on POD 1 and transitioned to a face mask.
He became hemodynamically stable and was weaned off of pressors.
 He was then started on his home lopressor, ASA, and statins.
His A-line was d/ced at this time as well.  His pain was
adequately controlled with a PCA pump.

   The patient was transferred to the floor on POD3 in stable
condition.  He continued to experience bouts of rapid A. Fib
which were usually symptomatic and were usually stimulated by
activity.  His Lopressor was titrated accordingly and eventually
switched from IV to PO once he began taking PO.  From a GI
standpoint he was slow to return his bowel function and
therefore was kept NPO with NGT in place until he had some
return of function.  The NGT was then d/ced and he was begun on
sips and slowly advanced which he tolerated well. From a
GU/Renal standpoint, the patient was restarted on his home lasix
and had excellent diuresis from his ileal conduit without any
issues. He was seen by physical therapy who recommended that the
patient would need rehab s/p discharge.
   Prior to discharge his PCA was d/ced and he was switched to
PO pain meds.  His IJ was removed prior to discharge as this was
his only available IV access.  His uretheral stents are to
remain in place for at least another 2-3 weeks.
