IMPRESSION:
1. Echogenic liver, denoting hepatic steatosis. More advanced
disease such
as cirrhosis or fibrosis cannot be excluded with this technique.

2. Normal gallbladder.
3. Patent portal and hepatic venous flow, demonstrating
appropriate direction
and waveforms.


Brief Hospital Course:
59M c PMH of ETOH cirrhosis, gastric varices, CVA, left
hemiplegia, with recent admission from [**Date range (1) 106021**] for upper GI
bleed and varices requiring banding and several units PRBCs who
presented with hematemesis.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
#. Hematemesis: Presented with hematemesis from a variceal
bleed. He underwent EGD with banding [**2160-1-17**]. He was
initially treated with octreotide and pantoprazole gtt as well
as ceftriaxone. He was later switched to PO pantoprazole and the
octreotide drip and ceftriaxone were stopped after five days.
his hematocrit remained stable after the EGD. He was not treated
with nadolol because of intolerance from his reactive airway
disease (documented allergy). Because of this he will likely
need repeat banding soon, though Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his hepatologist,
will determine best timing for repeat banding to balance risk of
variceal bleed vs band ulcerations.
.
# Alcoholic Cirrhosis: Patient with MELD score 9 on admission.
Not currently a transplant candidate. He did not have signs of
encephalopathy or ascites during this admission. His lactulose
was continued. His diuretics were initially held then restarted.
His folate, thiamine, B12 were continued.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
#. COPD: continued advair, albuterol
.
#. IDDM: Treated with glargine and HISS.
.
#. Schizophrenia: stable
- Continued home risperidone
.
#. Hypothyroidism: stable
- Continued home levothyroxine.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
#Repeat Banding: may need to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the next 1-2 weeks
for repeat banding.
.
#Follow up CBC: Please check a CBC within one week to confirm
stable hematocrit. Also had some leukopenia while admitted, near
recent baseline of 1.4-1.6.
