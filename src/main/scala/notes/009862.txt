Service:  Cardiac Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75-year-old gentleman
with no prior cardiac history, who was admitted to [**Hospital 1474**]
Hospital on [**3-22**] with complaints of shortness of breath
and substernal chest pain with complaints of symptoms
increasing over the last six months.  Patient underwent an
exercise treadmill test in [**2103-11-19**], which was
negative.  However, the patient reports increasing shortness
of breath and fatigue, and increase in frequency of
substernal chest pressure.  Patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 1444**] for cardiac catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. GERD.
2. Hypercholesterolemia.
3. History of asbestos exposure with a history of abnormal
chest x-ray.

ALLERGIES:  NKDA.

PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Lovenox 70 mg subq b.i.d.
5. Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.

AT HOME MEDICATIONS:
1. Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Prilosec 20 mg p.o. q.d.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] for cardiac catheterization, which
showed normal ejection fraction, left ventricular end
diastolic pressure of 19, diffusely diseased LAD with an 80%
mid LAD lesion, 50% ostial left circumflex stenosis, 80%
proximal OM-1 lesion, 70% mid OM-1 lesion, 90% proximal RCA
lesion, and 99% mid RCA lesion.

Patient was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] for coronary artery
bypass grafting.  Patient was taken to the operating room on
[**3-26**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] for CABG x3.  Underwent a LIMA
to LAD, saphenous vein graft to PDA and OM.  Please see
operative note for further details.  The patient was
transported to the Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.
Patient was weaned and extubated for mechanical ventilation.

On his first postoperative night, patient began working with
Physical Therapy on postoperative day #1.  On postoperative
day #2, the patient was noted to have some decrease in his
oxygen saturation requiring up to 50% face tent, maintained
adequate oxygen saturation.  Due to his prior history of
asbestos exposure and abnormal chest x-ray, Pulmonary consult
was obtained.  Per the Pulmonary Medicine team, it was felt
that the patient's hypoxia was due to multiple factors
including volume overload, atelectasis, as well as his prior
asbestos exposure.  They recommended starting the patient on
albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers, encouraging coughing and
deep breathing, chest physiotherapy, and diuresis.

Patient began working with physical therapy, increasing his
mobility, and patient was aggressively diuresed over the next
couple of days with improvement in his oxygen saturation.
Chest x-ray continued to [**Location (un) 381**] lung volumes, however, by
postoperative day #3, patient improved sufficiently and was
stable to transfer from the Intensive Care Unit to the
regular part of the hospital, where he continued receiving
albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers, and aggressive chest
pulmonary toilet.

On postoperative day #4, the patient after having been
ambulating with physical therapy, was able to ambulate 500
feet.

On postoperative day #5, patient's oxygen had been weaned off
and the patient had adequate oxygen saturation on room air
anywhere from 90-94 without complaints of shortness of
breath.  Patient's chest x-ray on postoperative day #5 showed
improved lung volumes, decreased atelectasis, and small
bilateral pleural effusions.  Patient's epicardial pacing
wires were removed on postoperative day #5 without incident,
and by postoperative day #6, the patient was cleared for
discharge to home.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  T max 99.8, pulse 90 in sinus
rhythm, blood pressure 116/50, respiratory rate 18, on room
air oxygen saturation 94%.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 8.7, hematocrit
25.1, platelet count 455.  Sodium 143, potassium 4.0,
chloride 107, bicarb 26, BUN 34, creatinine 1.0, glucose 113.

Patient's weight on [**4-1**] is 69 kg.  Preoperatively,
patient weighed 70 kg.  Neurologically, the patient is awake,
alert, and oriented times three, ambulating independently.
Neurologically nonfocal.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm
without rub or murmur.  Respiratory:  Breath sounds are
decreased at bilateral bases with scattered rhonchi.  There
is no audible wheezes or rales.  Abdomen:  Positive bowel
sounds, soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Sternal incision:
Steri-Strips are intact, clean and dry.  Sternum is stable.
Right lower extremity vein harvest site has minimal amount of
drainage at the knee.  Otherwise, the remainder of the
incision is clean and dry.  Extremities have trace to 1+
pitting edema.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Coronary artery disease.
2. Status post coronary artery bypass graft.
3. Postoperative hypoxia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. x7 days.
2. Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. q.d. x7 days.
3. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4. Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
5. Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
6. Percocet 5/325 [**12-21**] p.o. q.4-6h. prn.
7. Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.d.
8. Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.
9. Combivent MDI two puffs q.i.d.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient is to be discharged to
home in stable condition.

[**Last Name (STitle) 7047**] in [**12-21**] weeks.  Patient is to followup with Dr.
