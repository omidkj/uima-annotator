Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**]
Chief Complaint:
Left sided weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IV-tPA


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 72 yo left handed woman with a history of PVD,
diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia who presents this
morning following sudden onset left sided weakness.  The patient
reports she felt well this morning, better than she has in
months. She was in her kitchen at around 9am when she suddenly
fell to the ground and found her left side to be weak.  She
denies hitting her head and states she basically just slumped on
to her backside without any injury.  EMS was called and she was
brought to [**Hospital1 18**].

Upon arrival, a code stroke was called.  Initial evaluation
revealed left sided weakness, sensory neglect, right gaze
preference and dysarthria.  CT of the head was without evidence
of bleed or mass; CTA and CT perfusion were suggestive of a
right
MCA occlusion.  The risks and benefits where discussed and the
decision to give tPA was made.

Currently, the patient denies headache, loss of vision, blurred
vision, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness,
vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denied difficulties
producing or comprehending speech.  She reports weakness of the
left side and notes her left hand is numb. She denies bowel or
bladder incontinence or retention. Denied difficulty with gait.

On general review of systems, the patient denied recent fever or
chills.  Denied cough, shortness of breath.  Denied chest pain
or
tightness, palpitations.  Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation or abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or
bladder habits.

NCHCT / CTA / CT-perfusion on presentation at ED [**11-30**]:
1. Right middle cerebral artery inferior division infarction.
2. Bilateral atherosclerosis involving the origin of the
internal carotid
arteries with 70% of stenosis on the left and 40% stenosis on
the right.
3. Enlarged left thyroid lobe with multiple hypodensities. If
further
evaluation is desired, dedicated ultrasound can be performed.

MRI/MRA brain 11/4-5:
FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage. There is slow
diffusion
involving the right parietal and right insular cortex and right
external
capsule in keeping with acute infarct. There is no intracranial
mass, mass
effect or shift of midline structures. There is slight asymmetry
of the
lateral ventricles. There is a background of mild
microangiopathic small
vessel disease involving the subcortical and deep white matter
and brainstem.
IMPRESSION: Acute infarct in the right MCA distribution.No
hemorrhage or mass effect.

NCHCT at 24h post-tPA on [**12-1**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Subtle hypodensity along the right insula and right frontal
lobe,
corresponds to evolving right middle cerebral artery infarction.

2. No evidence of acute hemorrhage.

TTE [**11-30**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal de
