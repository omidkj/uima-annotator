Admission Date:  [**2198-1-9**]     Discharge Date:  [**2198-1-16**]

Date of Birth:   [**2125-1-14**]     Sex:  M

Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 72 year-old
male with chest pain and a history of coronary artery
disease.  He presented to the Emergency Room on the morning
of admission with complaints of exertional substernal chest
pain to 5 out of 10.  The pain was nonradiating with no
associated symptoms.  The patient reports that this was
similar to the episode he had in [**2175**] prior to his coronary
artery bypass graft.  The patient took four sublingual
nitroglycerin at home with no relief.  He also had an aspirin
and three sublingual nitroglycerin in route with EMS with no
relief.  The patient was given morphine and a GI cocktail in
the Emergency Room and had relief of his pain.  An
electrocardiogram done at that time showed new inferior ST
changes and he was transferred to the [**Hospital1 190**] for cardiac catheterization.  At baseline the
patient walks flights of stairs without pain or dyspnea.  He
denies orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  The
patient denies nausea or vomiting.  As his chest pain
continued on this episode the patient did experience some
mild diaphoresis.  The patient denies abdominal pain and also
denies constipation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease with myocardial infarction and
coronary artery bypass graft in [**2175**], saphenous vein graft to
left anterior descending coronary artery, D1 and D2,
saphenous vein graft to LCX, saphenous vein graft to obtuse
marginal, status post myocardial infarction in [**2180**] with a
catheterization at [**Hospital3 **] with patent saphenous vein
graft to right coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to left
anterior descending coronary artery, but occluded saphenous
vein graft to obtuse marginal one and obtuse marginal two.
Ejection fraction at that time was 50%.
2.  Peptic ulcer disease.
3.  Chronic degenerative joint disease.
4.  Status post vein stripping in the lower extremities.
5.  Status post appendectomy.
6.  Status post pilonidal cyst removal.
7.  Atrial fibrillation - on Coumadin.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin q day.
2.  Prevacid 30 q day.
3.  Coumadin one q day.
4.  Inderal 10 b.i.d.
5.  Diltiazem 120 q day.
6.  Lasix 120 q day.
7.  Captopril 12.5 t.i.d.
8.  Vitamin C.
9.  B-12.
10. Potassium chloride 20 q day.
11. Niaspan 500 q day.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a retired pharmacist retired
in [**2190**].  He denies tobacco, occasional alcohol.  He is
married and lives with his wife and has one child.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Blood pressure 149/75,
pulse 57, respirations 15, satting 99% on 2 liters.  This is
an elderly gentleman in no acute distress, well appearing.
Cardiovascular examination was regular rate and rhythm.
Normal S1 and S2 with a 2 out of 6 systolic murmur heard best
at the sternal border. Lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Extremities dorsalis pedis pulse were 2+
bilaterally with 1+ edema on the right and none on the left.
JVD to the angle of the jaw.

LABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION:  Significant for a white
blood cell count of 5.8, hematocrit 39.8.  Chem 7 was within
normal limits.  Troponin I .06.  CKMB 2.5.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiac:  Patient with known coronary
artery disease.  The patient underwent a cardiac
catheterization after his INR fell below 1.6.  The patient
was given vitamin K to lower his INR and reverse Coumadin.
The patient's cardiac catheterization revealed a wedge of 37,
PA pressures 75/40, LVEDP of 30, cardiac output was 4.8.  The
patient had a right dominant system.  His saphenous vein
graft to left anterior descending coronary artery had a 90%
stenosis, which underwent angioplasty and stent.  His
saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery was 80%, which
was also stented.  As on prior cardiac catheterizations the
patient had an occluded saphenous vein graft to obtuse
marginal one and obtuse marginal two.  Given the patient's
elevated wedge pressure and inability to diurese the patient
prior to catheterization in order to preserve renal function
the patient was transferred to the cardiac care unit for
intravenous Nitroprusside to diurese the patient given his
elevated wedge pressure.  The patient was diuresed in the
Intensive Care Unit setting and then transferred back to the
floor in stable condition.  An echocardiogram was done, which
showed an ejection fraction of 35 to 40%, TR gradient of 37.
He had inferolateral akinesis, 2+ mitral regurgitation and 1+
tricuspid regurgitation.  He also had inferior hypokinesis.
During his time in the Intensive Care Unit the patient had
episodes of NSVT.  Given the episodes of NSVT the patient had
a single wire ICD placed on [**2198-1-15**].  The patient
tolerated this procedure without incident.  The patient was
further diuresed with intravenous Lasix and then changed to
his home Lasix dose of 120 mg q day.  The patient's blood
pressure medications had been changed to an ace inhibitor.
He was titrated up on Lisinopril at 20 mg q day.  He was also
started on Toprol XL 25 mg q day.  In addition to this the
patient was maintained on aspirin, started on a statin and
after a stent placed on Plavix.  The patient's rhythm
remained in atrial fibrillation.  The patient was instructed
to restart his Coumadin at the time of discharge and follow
up with his primary care physician for further monitoring of
his INR.

2.  Gastrointestinal:  History of peptic ulcer disease the
patient had no evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding and was
continued on his Prevacid.

3.  Genitourinary:  The patient had evidence of blood in his
urine, however, this cleared as the stream continued.  This
blood seemed to be due to a small abrasion at the urethral
meatus.  The patient was instructed to monitor this and
follow up with his primary care physician as needed.

4.  Hematology:  The patient's hematocrit remained stable
throughout his hospital course.  The patient did experience a
hematoma at the right groin at the site of cardiac
catheterization.  He had good distal pulses.  No bruits.
Stable hematoma at the time of discharge.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable status post ICD and stent.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Unstable angina.
2.  Congestive heart failure.
3.  Coronary artery disease native and to saphenous vein
graft.
4.  Chronic ischemic heart disease.
5.  Atrial fibrillation.
6.  Hypertension.
7.  Hypokalemia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg q day.
2.  Lasix 120 mg q day.
3.  Lansoprazole 30 q day.
4.  Multivitamin q day.
5.  Atorvastatin 10 q day.
6.  Plavix 75 q day.
7.  Toprol XL 25 q day.
8.  Lisinopril 20 q day.
9.  Coumadin 1 mg q day.
10.  Keflex 500 mg po q.i.d. for six doses.

FOLLOW UP PLANS:  The patient was instructed to follow up
with his electrophysiologist.  He will follow up on [**1-22**].  The patient was also instructed to follow up with his
primary care physician within [**Name Initial (PRE) **] week following discharge for
further monitoring of his INR as he becomes therapeutic.  The
patient was also instructed to follow up with his primary
cardiologist within the next two weeks.  In addition to this
the patient was instructed to monitor his weight eery day and
to call his physician should he have a weight increase of
more then five pounds.
