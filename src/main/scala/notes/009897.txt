Pertinent Results:
[**2154-1-15**] ECHO
PREBYPASS
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated. The descending thoracic aorta is
mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Abnormal flow consistent with a patent ductus arteriosus is
identified.

POSTBYPASS
Biventricular systolic function is preserved. There is a well
seated, well functioning bioprosthesis in the aortic position.
There is a perivalvular leak that is mild (1+) in quantity. The
remaining study is otherwise unchanged from the prebypass
period.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 60531**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2154-1-11**] via transfer
from [**Hospital6 1109**] for surgical management of his
coronary artery disease and aortic valve stenosis. He was
worked-up in the usual preoperative manner. A dental consult was
obatained and it was determined that 14 teeth needed to be
extracted prior to valve surgery which was performed on [**2154-1-14**].
He was placed post-operatively on peridex rinses.  On [**2154-1-15**],
Mr. [**Known lastname 60531**] was taken to the operating room where he underwent
coronary artery byass grafting to three vessels and an aortic
valve replacement. Please see operative note for details.  Post
operatively he was admitted to the CVICU intubated and sedated.
He awakened and was weaned from the ventilator and extubated. He
was started on betablockers, statins and diuresed toward his
pre-operative weight. Chest tubes and temporary pacing wires
were removed per protocol. He was transferred from the ICU to
the stepdown unit for ongoing post operative care. He was
evaluated and treated by physical therapy for ongoing strength
and conditioning. His lisinopril was increased to 10mg daily and
should be uptitrated as necessary for a systolic blood pressure
goal of less than 130mmHg.  He was given extra potassium for an
elevated bicarb, but is still on lasix secondary to lower
extremity edema.  He was also hyponatremic so his free water was
restricted.  Electrolytes and fluid status should be closely
watched.  Rehab was recommended upon discharge. He was
discharged on post-operative day eight to Radius of [**Hospital1 392**].
