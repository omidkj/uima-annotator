This discharge summary will span the dates from admission
[**2190-4-13**], to [**2190-5-2**].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60 year old
female who was sent to the Emergency Department secondary to
delta MS from a nursing home.  She was noted to have
lethargy, decreased oxygen saturation in the low 80s.  In the
Emergency Department, the patient was suctioned with
increased secretions and the saturation improved on a 40%
tracheostomy mask.  Prior to this presentation, the patient
had had multiple complicated admissions, including from
[**2190-2-27**], to [**2190-3-3**], for hepatic artery stenosis, status
post dilatation and stent, complicated by acute renal failure
and multiple multiresistant organisms.  The patient then was
admitted from [**2190-3-12**], to [**2190-4-9**], with elevated alkaline
phosphatase of unknown origin, episode of [**Year/Month/Day **]/sepsis
from a urinary tract infection and pneumonia requiring a
Medical Intensive Care Unit transfer, questionable dystonic
reaction to Phenergan, and intermittent left bundle branch
block with troponin leak, and intermittent delirium, pyloric
tube placed for feeding and diarrhea.  In the Emergency
Department, the patient denied chest pain, abdominal pain,
fever, chills or sweats.  She complained of shortness of
breath and needing suctioning.  The shortness of breath
improved after suctioning.  The patient also complained of
buttocks pain.  In the Emergency Department, the patient
received Ceftazidime and Azithromycin.  The patient was
unable to give significant history but nodded and shook her
head appropriately to questioning.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Admission vital signs revealed
temperature 98.6, pulse 90, blood pressure 127/76,
respiratory rate 30, oxygen saturation 100% on 40%
tracheostomy mask.  In general, the patient nodded and shook
her head appropriately, appeared tired, oriented to the
hospital.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat - The left pupil
is slightly larger than the right, bilaterally reactive.
Mucous membranes are moist.  Tracheostomy was in place.  The
heart was tachycardic without murmurs.  The lungs revealed
decreased breath sounds one half way up on the right.  The
abdomen was soft, nontender, no masses, no definite ascites.
Extremities - large pitting edema, warm.  Sacral decubitus
was noted to be large but did not appear infected.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count was 12.3, hematocrit
29.0, platelet count 639,000.  INR 1.1.  Sodium 140,
potassium 4.9, chloride 101, bicarbonate 30, blood urea
nitrogen 28, creatinine 1.0, glucose 118.  ALT 21, AST 42,
LDH 242, alkaline phosphatase 1016, total bilirubin 0.6,
amylase 43, troponin 0.29, CK 14, albumin 3.0.  Urinalysis
showed greater than 30 white blood cells with many bacteria.

Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at 119, Q waves in V1
through V3, Q wave in III, T wave inversion in V4, biphasic T
waves in V2 and V3, flat T wave in aVL.

Chest x-ray showed a right PICC, postpyloric tube into the
duodenum, right sided pleural effusion, no changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Pulmonary - On hospital day one, the patient had another
episode of acute hypoxia requiring transfer to the Intensive
Care Unit.  The patient spent one night in the Intensive Care
Unit where she responded to frequent suctioning and nebulizer
treatments.  The patient's sputum culture grew out
multiresistant Klebsiella and pseudomonas.  It was felt that
these organisms were likely colonizers rather than
representing infection.  However, early in her hospital stay,
the patient was having frequent episodes of desaturation and
she was started on Zosyn for possible pneumonia.  As the
patient responded to suctioning and quickly improved her
oxygen saturation, it was felt that mucous plugging was the
most likely cause for hypoxia.  She was treated with a seven
day course of Zosyn although it was felt that the said
organisms were more likely colonizers than infection.  She
was also diuresed for some mild congestive heart failure but
the ultimate cause of her hypoxia was felt to be due to
inability to clear her secretions.  She required frequent
suctioning and saline washes to try to reduce the viscosity
of the secretions.  At the time of this dictation, the
patient has been stable from her pulmonary status, although
still requiring frequent respiratory therapy and suctioning.

In terms of her tracheostomy tube, it was noted that the
patient was unable to speak with her Passy-Muir valve in
place and it was wondered if there may be some upper airway
stenoses causing increased resistance.  ENT was consulted and
noted no anatomical problem with the upper airway.  Combined
effort between Speech and Swallow, ENT and Transplant
Surgery, it was felt that the patient would benefit from
slowly reducing the size of her tracheostomy and trying to
wean her off the tracheostomy.  However, she continued to
have frank aspiration and therefore this was not a viable
option at this time.  Additionally, the patient continued to
have problems clearing her own secretions as mentioned above
and thus a smaller diameter tracheostomy would increase the
difficulty with these secretions.  Her tracheostomy was
changed by ENT to a #6 Shiley cuffed as it was felt that a
noncuff would increase the risks for aspiration events.  The
patient continued to be too weak to speak with her Passy-Muir
valve and it was felt that the valve should not be used until
she demonstrated improvement in her strength, decreased her
aspiration and we were able to clear her secretions more
effectively.

2.  Diarrhea - The patient continued to have profuse watery
diarrhea.  It was unclear what the etiology was.  The type of
tube feed was changed on a number of occasions to see if an
alimentary formula would improve the diarrhea, however, there
was not much change.  Stool lytes were done, which showed
evidence of an osmotic diarrhea.  The patient's CellCept was
titrated off thinking that that may be causing the diarrhea.
She was treated symptomatically with Loperamide and Tincture
of Opium.  Ultimately, the diarrhea was resolved with the
stopping of the tube feeds altogether and changing to TPN for
nutrition.  Additionally, Ursodiol was stopped and
Cholestyramine was started and this may have also contributed
to the resolution of the diarrhea.

3.  Sacral decubitus - The patient with a large sacral
decubitus ulcer which was cared for by the wound care team
and then plastic
