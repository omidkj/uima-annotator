Chief Complaint:
Weakness, diarrhea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
this is a 53 yo male with MS presenting from home complaining of
weakness, diarrhea and hematuria.  On presentation from the ED,
patient found to be septic with tachycardia to 125, rectal temp
to 102.5 F, a leukocytosis to 35K, and hemoconcentrated with a
HCT of 50.5K.  Transferred to the ICU for further management.
In the ICU, he was empirically started on cefepime and
vancomycin for a known history of P.Aeuriginosa UTIs as well as
Vancomycin senstiive entercoccus infections in the past.  The
patient was fluid resuscitated with approximately 9 L of IVF
with improvement in his hemodynamics and WBC count.  Regarding
diarrhea, noted to be C.Diff negative. Transferred to the floor
for further management as sepsis had improved.  Upon transfer to
the floors, BP was 119/69, HR of 81, RR 16, O2 sat 97% on RA.
LOS fluid balance is 8.2 L positive.

Of note, this is Mr. [**Known lastname 107332**] 5th admission in past 6 months for
UTI.  ID was consulted in the ICU regarding ppx of UTIs,
although formal evaluation is still pending at time of transfer.
 Appears patient was on methenamine for urine acidifcation to
prevent UTIs previously.  Additionally, urology was emailed
regarding possible benefit for suprapubic catheter and the
medical team is awaiting a reply.

IMAGING:

IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism, cavitary lesion or septic
emboli.
2.  Moderate slightly asymmetric (left greater than right)
pulmonary edema and
small bilateral pleural effusions consistent with hypervolemia.
3.  Slightly distended colon, nonspecific and similar compared

Final Report
HISTORY:  53-year-old man with history of multiple sclerosis,
neurogenic
bladder, lower GI bleed presents with worsening abdominal
distention and
nausea.

COMPARISON:  CT abdomen and pelvis, [**2183-10-11**]; CT abdomen
and pelvis, [**2183-10-9**].

FINDINGS:

Again seen are diffusely dilated loops of large bowel with air
fluid levels
with a maximal diameter of 8.5 cm. There is no clear evidence of

pneumoperitoneum or pneumatosis.  Multiple surgical clips are
seen in the left
lower quadrant.

IMPRESSION:

Multiple severely dilated loops of large bowel with air-fluid
levels unchanged
from prior examination.

[**2183-10-11**] CT Abdomen
IMPRESSION:

1.  Fluid-filled diffusely distended colon, unchanged from prior
examination.


2.  No active extravasation of contrast in the bowel lumen to
suggest source
for new brisk lower GI bleed.

3.  Ground-glass opacities in the bilateral lung bases have
increased on the
left.  Though non-specific in appearance, findings could be
related to
pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.


[**10-10**] Cystogram
FINDINGS:  Intravenous contrast fills the bladder without
evidence of leak.
No contrast is seen within the rectum.  Contrast is seen in the
right seminal
vesicle, possibly secondary to retrograde flow.  The fat plane
between the
bladder and rectum is obscured.  A Foley catheter is seen within
the bladder.
The bladder wall is trabeculated, likely secondary to neurogenic
bladder.  Air
layering anteriorly within the bladder is likely due to
instrumentation.
Residual enteric contrast is seen within the cecum.  Visualized
portion of the
colon is distended with air, as seen yesterday.  Evaluation of
intrapelvic
organs is limited in the absence of intravenous contrast.

IMPRESSION:  No definitive colovesicular fistula detected on
this study.
Contrast seen in the right seminal vesicle, of indeterminate
etiology,
possibly secondary to retrograde flow.


[**2183-10-9**] CT abdomen
FINDINGS:  There is an enlarging right-sided pleural effusion as
well as a small left pleural effusion.  The righ
