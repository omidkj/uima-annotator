History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 54 year-old portuguese speaking woman with a PMH
insulin dependent DM with nephropathy and neuropathy, HTN, PVD,
and acute on chroni renal failure who was transferred from
[**Hospital **] hospital after being found to have decreased movement
of the left arm > left leg.
.
The patient was admitted to the OSH on [**2144-1-16**] with a CC of
decreased PO intake. Per the patient's daughter, the patient was
discharged from the hospital on [**2144-1-7**] after an admission for
RLE wound related to her diabetes. She was discharged home with
a woundvac, a PICC line and plan for 6 weeks of cefepime for
osteomyelitis. She was somnolent at home and the daughter
brought her Mother in because she felt that she was still ill.
Importantly the daughter describes bilateral hand shaking - left
prior to right that was occuring several times a day. Apparently
the patient was aware of these movements and never lost
consiousness during them. She was noted on admission to the OSH
to have worsening renal failure with BUN61 and Cr 4.7. She
underwent a swallow eval, at which time she choked, leading to
respiratory distress, and was intubated. The patient was
apparently evaluated by a "Stroke Team" and per the [**Location (un) **],
the patient was supposed to go [**Hospital3 2576**] [**Hospital3 **], but there
was no available ICU bed and so the patient was sent here.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], pt had MRI/MRA and CT which showed a subacte infarct
involving the R globus pallidus and internal capsule.  She was
not given TPA and instead started on plavix.

Physical Exam:
Vitals: T:99.1 P:78 R:20 BP:147/69 SaO2:100% on assist control.

General: Awake, cooperative, NAD.
HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in
oropharynx. Hirsuit.
Neck: Supple, no carotid bruits appreciated. No nuchal rigidity

Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally without R/R/W
Cardiac: RRR, soft, nl. S1S2, no M/R/G noted
Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, obese.
Extremities: Severe wound on RLE - including necrotic deep
wound.

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:
OSH-EKG: Sinus tach at 105, normal axis, normal intervals, no
acute t-wave St-segment abnormalities.
.
OSH CT - with small vessle ischemic changes. Also a possibility
for right basal ganglia/internal capsule hypodensity.
.
NCHCT - Subacute infarct involving the right globus pallidus and
internal capsule.  No intracranial hemorrhage is identified.
.
MRI - Diffusion and adc abnormalities in the area corresponding
to the NCHCT. MRA was normal.
.
Renal U/S - Limited study without evidence of hydronephrosis or
large mass.
.
Foot XR - no areas of bony erosion are seen to suggest
osteomyelitis.
.
ECHO - the left atrium is normal in size. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. Suboptimal image quality - patient
unable to cooperate.
.
NIAS - bilateral tibial arterial disease; vessels
non-compressible
.
Carotid U/S - no significant stenosis
.
Vein Mapping - IMPRESSION:  Patent bilateral basilic veins and
left cephalic vein.  Normal bilateral brachial arteries with
triphasic Doppler waveforms.  The right subclavian vein was
visualized and is patent with preserved phasicity.
.
Bone Scan - IMPRESSION:  Abnormal study with intense increased
radiotracer uptake on all three phases in the right ankle
region.  This is a non-specific finding and infection vs
fracture vs charcot joint or a combination of these entities
remain within the differential.  An indium labeled WBC scan may
be obtained for further differentiation as clinically [**Name (NI) 9304**].

.
[**2144-2-7**] p-MIBI: normal wall motion, no perfusion defect, no
changes on EKG, no symptoms manifested with test.
.
MICRO:
OSH Wound Cx - group B strep, pseudomonas aeruginosa
OSH BCx - No growth
UCx - enterococcous, R to Amp, S to Vanco
WCx - strep, coag neg
BCx - NGTD
.
IMPRESSION: No anginal symptoms or ECG changes from baseline.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 7563**] is a 54 year-old female with an extensive past
medical history including DM, PVD, HTN, and nephropathy
transferred for acute stroke and possible TPA. Based on the
imaging there was no vascular cutoff on which to intervene
despite a subacute infarct in the right thalmus/internal
capsule.
.
The patient presented with a subacute CVA with residual
left-sided upper extremity weakness. CT head ([**2144-1-17**]) revealed
subacute infarct involving the right globus pallidus and
internal capsule. MRI brain ([**2144-1-17**]) revealed correlated
increased signal intensity in the posterior limb of the internal
capsule. There was no hemorrhage. Given the subacute nature of
the injury, the patient was not a candidate for lysis therapy.
The patient was placed on clopidogrel and statin therapy.
Aspirin therapy was deferred due to a history of an aspirin
allegy. The patient's systolic blood pressue was targeted to
140-180 to maintain adequate watershed perfusion. On carotid
ultrasound the patient had no significant stenosis. Lower
extremity ultrasound did reveal bilateral tibial artery disease.
Echo on [**2144-1-20**] was a limited study though revealed no
intracardiac source of embolus and no PFO. The patient requires
physical rehabilitation and will follow-up in the outpatient
stroke clinic for further care.
.
# CV: The patient's EKG showed T wave flattening in I and aVL in
the setting of negative serial cardiac enzymes. A TTE showed and
EF > 55%. She was started on po Lopressor.
.
# Respiratory: The patient has a brief stay in the ICU including
intubation for likely volume overload. She was extubated on
[**1-18**] and slowly weaned to 3L O2 NC. On the medicine floor she
desat'd x 2 to mid 70's and mid 60's -> however ABG was
unchanged. CXR [**1-19**] showed fluid overload, and she was given
Lasix 20mg IV and 0.5 in nitropaste for hypertension. She
subsequently had continued improvement in respiratory function
especially with establishment of scheduled hemodialysis to
control volume overload.
.
# ID. The patient was admitted to [**Hospital6 8972**]
11.16.07-12.03.07 with complaints of right foot erythema, warmth
and drainage from foot ulcer. She had a foot ulcer that probed
to bone at that time and MRI revealed bony changes concerning
for osteomyelitis. The patient underwent podiatric debridement
at the OSH at that time and cultures from that procedure grew
group B strep and pseudomonas. She was started on a 6 week
course of vanc and cefepime with plans for outpatient podiatry
follow-up. The patient was re-admitted and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
prior to completion of this antibiotic course. On [**2144-1-24**] the
patient was c
