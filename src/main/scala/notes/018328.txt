mild TPP over the distal tibia. The patient 2-point
discrimination is diminished on the plantar surface of the
toes bilaterally. Light touch sensation is preserved. Right
toe was nontender with a sterile probe. There is a 1 x 1

ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA:  Lactate of 2.0. Electrolytes -
sodium 127, K 5.3, chloride 88, CO2 20, BUN 24, creatinine
1.2, glucose 635, white count 16.6, hematocrit 37.5,
platelets 309, INR 1.2. Foot x-ray, ankle x-rays were
obtained. Chest x-ray was also obtained.

Initial toe culture from the right great toe grew beta
streptococcus group B x2. Staph coag positive, rare, probable
Enterococcus rare. Anaerobic cultures were negative. Blood
cultures with no growth. Urine culture with no growth.

Right foot film showed first toe was subcutaneous emphysema
and possibly lucency in the medial aspect of the first distal
phalanx on AP view only, osteomyelitis could not be excluded.
There was soft tissue edema. There was no evidence of
fracture or malalignment.  Degenerative changes were noted.

X-rays of the tib-fib on the right were obtained which were
negative for radiographic evidence of osteomyelitis. [**Last Name (un) **]
service was consulted on [**2189-10-27**] for management of
the patient's diabetes. He remained on insulin drip. When
