Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
COPD exacerbation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This is a 60 year old male with severe end-stage COPD with
multiple hospitalizations (many of which have required
intubation, the most recent of which was [**Date range (1) **] and
discharged on steroid taper), who presented to the ED via
ambulance with acute shortness of breath and a non-productive
cough.  In the ED, the patient was noted to have no fevers,
chest pain or abdominal pain, but he did complain of mild
chills.  Oxygen saturation of 72% on 2L.  EKG revealed increased
prominence of previously appreciated ST elevations and a heparin
drip was started per a cardiology consult.  Chest xray revealed
no significant changes compared to prior studies, the findings
of which were bilateral perihilar haziness and slight
peritrachial cuffin, mild upper zone redistribution of pulmonary
vasculature, and a small right effusion.  Because of crescendo
respiratory decline, the patient was evaluated by the ICU team
who felt the patient required emergent intubation.  The patient
was subsequently intubated for 5 days while steroids,
nebulizers, and antibiotics were administered.  The patient's
respiratory status gradually improved and the patient was
transferred to the regular [**Hospital1 **] floor for further evaluation.

EKG [**2116-7-18**]
Sinus rhythm.
ST-T wave configuration suggests early repolarization pattern -
clinical
correlation is suggested
Since previous tracing of [**2116-7-17**], no significant change

ECHO [**2116-7-17**]
Conclusions:
1. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Inferior
hypokinesis is
probably present.
2. Compared with the findings of the prior report (tape
unavailable for
review) of [**2115-9-6**], there has been no significant change.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2116-7-17**] 6:02 AM
FINDINGS: The heart is of normal size. Mediastinal and hilar
contours are unchanged when compared to the prior study. There
is bilateral perihilar haziness and slight peribronchial
cuffing. There is also mild upper zone redistribution of the
pulmonary vasculature. There is a small right pleural effusion.
There is possibly a small left pleural effusion. This finding is
suggestive of mild CHF. There are no focal consolidations.
Osseous structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with mild CHF.


Brief Hospital Course:
* Pulmonary: As discussed above, the patient presented to the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED in acute respiratory distress, requiring intubation to
maintain adequate oxygen saturation.  Chest xray revealed no
infiltrates. Etiology of the COPD exacerbation was thought
secondary to not taking prednisone after last hospital
discharge; he reported the prescription was never called in and
he quickly decompensated. IV steroids and azithromycin were
initiated concomittantly with nebulizer treatments.  The
patient's respiratory status gradually improved and he was able
to be extubated without complication after 5 days of ventilator
dependence.  The patient was switched to po steroids and
maintained on antibiotics and nebulizer treatments.  By day 6 of
his hospitalization, the patient reported feeling at his
baseline respiratory status on 3L of oxygen by nasal cannula.  A
steroid taper was initiated and physical therapy evaluated the
patient to be safe to return home with pulmonary rehab follow
up.  Smoking cessation was repeatedly encouraged but the patient
expressed frustration with multiple previous attempts at
quitting.

* Cardiovascular: On presentation to the ED, the patient's EKG
revealed more prominent ST elevations that were previously seen
at baseline.  The Cardiology service was consulted and they
suggested starting a heparin drip until enzymes were cycled.
The patient continued to deny chest pain and when all cardiac
markers were flat, the patient's heparin drip was discontinued.
Aspirin was continued and an ECHO was obtained to ensure the
patient did not suffer a cardiac insult.  The results of that
study are above, but essentially revealed no significant change
from prior studies.  With respect to blood pressures, the
patient was noted to be hypertensive during the duration of his
stay in the ICU.  As a result, his outpatient lisinopril dose
was increased to 15 mg daily with good effect.

* Endo: While on steroid therapy, the patient was found to have
persistently elevated blood sugar levels.  The patient was
subsequently placed on a tight insulin sliding scale with good
effect.  Starting the patient on a long acting insulin was
discussed with him, but he adamantly refused to comply with
injections at home.  Thus, the patient was continued on his
outpatient regimen of metformin with the thought that as
steroids are decreased, blood sugar levels will similarly become
better controlled.
