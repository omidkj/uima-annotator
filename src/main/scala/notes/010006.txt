seizures

History of Present Illness:
This is a RH 66year old man with a past medical history
significant for migraines, htn, and hypercholesterolemia who
presents to OSH with one of his typical migraines and was noted
to have a seizure. Per his wife, Mr.[**Known lastname 64148**] has been in his
usual
state of health recently - no fevers, chills, n/v, or diarrhea.
He awoke at 4:30am this morning as he usually does and went for
his routine [**3-14**] mile walk. Sometime after returning home he told
his wife that he felt a migraine starting, and he took Imitrex
at
about 9:30am. For most of the rest of the day, he was working at
his desk and Mr.[**Known lastname 64148**] told his wife that his migraine was
still
present and she asked him if he had taken a second dose of the
Imitrex and he could not recall if he had or not. He then began
to seem "restless" to his wife and was "having difficulty
talking." She is certain that he could understand everything she
was saying. She was worried, however because she states that
typically when he has migraines like this he goes to lay down -
but this time he was up "rustling through drawers." She then
told
him that she would take him to the hospital and drove to an OSH.
There, she said that he continued to have even more difficulty
talking and was only saying one to two words at a time (mostly
he
was silent) and these words were not comprehensible. He had no
noted weakness. The ED physicians at the OSH noted "Wernicke's
aphasia" and gave him an NIH SS score of 12 (5 points total for
LOC, 1 for "partial gaze," 2 for dysarthria, 2 for aphasia, and
2
for hemi- inattention).  They were about to give tPA, when it
was
noted that his right arm was shaking. This lasted for about 2
minutes (per the notes) and resolved. He was given 2mg of
ativan.
He then became very agitated. It was unclr if there were more
episodes of seizure - per verbal report he had a gtc seizure as
well - but this was not documented in the notes. He recieved a
total of 12mg of ativan at the OSH, and was intubated. He had
fentanyl, etomidate and succinylcholine for the intubation. He
recieved versed in the ambulance ride on transfer, and once at
[**Hospital1 18**] he was noted to have repetitive tonic extension of his
extremities and was given a total of 8mg more of ativan, 10mg of
valium, propofol drip, doses of ceftriaxone, vancomycin and and
acyclovir, and nearly 2200mg of dilantin thus far.
Family states that the patient has never had seizures before in
his life.

Summary of MRIs
MRI with Contrast:  no enhancing lesions
MRI with DWI:  no acute stroke
.
Summary of EEGs:  no seizure activity; encephalopathic patterns


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted for management of his seizures.  He was
loaded with dilantin and started on depakote as well.  He
underwent an LP which did not show any evidence of infection
(lyme and HSV pending at the time of this dictation).  He began
to wake-up by hospital day 3 and as the ICU team began to remove
sedating medications.  His MRI's did not show any strokes or
mass lesions.  His EEGs just showed an encephalopathic pattern
of activity.  Although he did exhibit some signs of sundowning
on the neurology floor, his symptoms improved, and his wife
confirmed that he had returned "95% back to baseline."  An MRI
was performed nonetheless for the possibility that he had had a
stroke in the unit that had caused the confusion seen later on
the floor, and it was negative.  On the day of discharge, his
exam findings were still significant for some fuzziness
regarding current events and the news, subtle paucity of
content-[**Doctor First Name **] vocabulary, and some difficulty walking.  He had
been assessed by PT and deemed appropriate for rehab.  He still
had big problems walking, with retropulsion even when using
walker, and frequent near-falls.  He had been evaluated by
Physical Therapy, who felt rehab was appropriate, and this was
still felt to be the best option.
