Pertinent Results:
Echocargiogram [**2115-7-25**]
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. A catheter or
pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV.
Left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum at rest.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Normal regional LV systolic function.
Overall normal LVEF (>55%).
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal diameter of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
levels. Simple atheroma in ascending aorta. Normal descending
aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Conclusions
Pre operative:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is a small PFO with a
left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.

Chest X-Ray [**2115-7-28**];
There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.  Bilateral pleural
effusions are
small.  Aside from atelectasis in the left lower lobe, the lungs
are grossly clear.  Almost complete resolution of atelectasis in
the left upper lobe.  Sternal wires are aligned.  Widened
mediastinum has improved.  A small air-fluid level in the
retrosternal region suggests the presence of a tiny pneumothorax
and small effusion.  These are most likely located in the left
side.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2115-7-25**] where
the patient underwent Off pump coronary artery bypass graft x3,
left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery
and saphenous vein grafts to diagonal, and obtuse marginal
arteries. Endoscopic harvesting of the long saphenous vein.
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. She required
Nitroglycerin for hypertension her first night post op but was
transitioned to oral betablocker and diuretics. POD 1 found the
patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.
 The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically
stable. The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for
further recovery. Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued
without complication. She was started on plavix due to being
done off pump and will it need to be continued for six months.
Blood sugars were closely monitored and she was restarted on her
home regime which have slowly improved. The patient was
evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance with
strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD 5 the
patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain
was controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged
home with visiting nurse services in good condition with
appropriate follow up instructions.
