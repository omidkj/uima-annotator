Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1928**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is an 80 year old female with a history of [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) **]
syndrome, HTN, anxiety who was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**]
for a urinary tract infection and some altered mental status who
was having increasing dyspnea at her nursing home. A chest XR
was done which was reported as concerning for pneumonia. She was
started on levofloxacin at 6pm on [**5-10**]. She then looked worse
(more tachypnic and dyspneic) and was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for
evaluation.
.
Of note she was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 **] for a UTI and
altered mental status. She was discharged on [**4-1**] on a 7 day
course of levofloxacin. Her mental status changes were
atrributable to a UTI. She was discharged to rehab although it
appears that she was admitted from home initially.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 110s, 98.5, 140/80 22-24 and 85%
RAsat. Patient was given Zosyn, flagyl, olanzapine, lorazepam,
and tylenol. Labs were significant for a positive UA (21-50 WBC
and many bacteria) and a d-dimer of 2951. A lactate was 2.8.

Review of sytems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denied cough, shortness of breath. Denied chest pain
or tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation or abdominal pain. No recent change in bowel or
bladder habits. No dysuria. Denied arthralgias or myalgias.
.

100.6, 90s, 97/52, 18-20, 96-98% NRB.

Past Medical History:

several years after traumatic fall with elbow fracture)
Osteoporosis
Constipation
s/p Hysterectomy for fibroids
HTN
Depression
Anxiety


Social History:
She does not smoke or drink alcohol. She worked for an
educational testing service. She recently moved from [**State 760**]
to [**Location (un) **], MA to be closer to her daughter. She lives alone
with aides present for estimated 10 hours per day. She has been
electively wheelchair bound since a fall a few years ago when
she severely injured her elbow. At baseline she can stand and
offer help to transition herself to her wheelchair.

Father died of an MI. Mother died of pancreatic cancer. Brother
died. Had asthma, heart disease, and had similar neurological
problems to the patient. She has a younger sister with breast
cancer that she had 20 years ago. She has only one daughter.

AP PORTABLE CHEST [**2164-5-10**] AT [**2090**] HOURS.

FINDINGS: The patient is significantly rotated limiting
evaluation. There is diffuse hazy opacity, predominantly
bilateral perihilar distribution. The left lower lobe is
difficult to fully assess, but there is some suggestion of focal
infiltrates. The aorta is tortuous with calcified plaque. The
cardiac silhouette size is difficult to assess but is grossly
within normal limits for size. No effusion or pneumothorax is
noted. Please note the left apex is obscured by the patient's
chin. The bones are severely osteopenic with multilevel
degenerative change throughout the thoracic spine noted.
Deformity of upper right ribs suggest remote healed trauma.
IMPRESSION: Markedly limited study to near non-diagnostic given
severity of rotation. There is suggestion of bilateral perihilar
opacities possibly also involving the left lower lobe.
Multifocal pneumonia cannot be excluded on the basis of this
examination. If clinically feasible, consider repeat radiography
in the radiology suite with PA and lateral views preferred.

CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis [**2164-5-11**]
FINDINGS:

CT CHEST: The airways are patent up to subsegmental level. There
are
bilateral multiple focal area of opacities, predominantly in the
lower lobes, concerning for multifocal pneumonia. Additionally,
there is a tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] pattern in the lower lobes again in
keeping with likely pneumonia, or aspiration. There is bilateral
small pleural effusion. There is no
pericardial effusion.

There are prominent lymph nodes seen in the mediastinum,
nonspecific, could be reactive. There is no lymphadenopathy in
the axilla.

CTA CHEST: There is no evidence of PE with suboptimal segmental
and
subsegmental loer lobe evaluation due to breathing. There is no
evidence of aortic dissection. Heart size is normal.

CT ABDOMEN: The liver enhances homogeneously. There is focal
hypodensity
near the falciform ligament, likely fatty sparing. The main
portal vein is
patent. The gallbladder is not clearly identified due to
multiple overlying loops of bowel in the area and lack of oral
contrast. There is normal gallbladder. There is a large
calcification in the spleen, could be due to prior granulomatous
disease. Calcification is seen at the vessel of the spleen,
could be a calcified aneurysm or calcified lymph node, (3B:12).
There is no evidence of bowel obstruction. Study is limited due
to lack of oral contrast. There is no free air. Moderate amount
of stool in the colon. Loops of small bowel filled with fluid,
could be in keeping with enteritis, difficult to evaluate for
fat stranding due to patient body habitus. There is no large
ascites. No lymphadenopathy according to CT size criteria. The
vessels appear with normal caliber, and patent.

CT PELVIS: Urinary bladder has Foley and air within. Due to
placement of a
Foley and due to lack of oral contrast, this study is suboptimal
to evaluate for a fistula between the bladder and the colon.
There is no free fluid in the pelvis. No lymphadenopathy in the
pelvic or inguinal area.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Moderate degenerative changes throughout the
spine. There is a compression fracture at the vertebral body of
L1, of indeterminate age.

IMPRESSION:
1. No PE, with suboptimal evaluation of the segmental and
subsegmental level in the lower lobes. Patient was breathing in
the scanner.
2. Multifocal opacities in the lungs and predominantly at the
lung bases with a tree-in-[**
