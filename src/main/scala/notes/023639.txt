exacerbation/pneumonia.  He was discharge to rehab with
planned neurology surgery on [**2160-2-13**].  He was in his
usual state of health until the [**2-3**] when he was
found tachypneic and in respiratory distress with an O2
saturation of 82%.  He had rales on examination.  He went to
the [**Hospital1 18**] Emergency Department and was given nebulizers,
Levo, Vanco and BiPAP.  Arterial blood gases 7.28/79/128.  O2
sats dropped and the patient was intubated, hypercarbic,
lethargic and hypotensive.  He was admitted to the MICU.

congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease,
Alzheimer's dementia, paranoid schizophrenia, right

HOSPITAL COURSE:  While in the Intensive Care Unit briefly
the patient was treated with Flagyl for aspiration pneumonia.
He was bolused for hypertension.  CT scan revealed no change
to his brain tumor.  He was continued on intravenous Decadron
and Phenytoin.  Antibiotics were adjusted for continued
pneumonia.  Positive for influenza A and was treated with
Ranitidine.  On [**2160-2-13**] the patient was attempted to
be weaned from the ventilator.  This was unsuccessful.
Diuresis was continued for congestive heart failure.  On
[**2160-2-14**] the patient was extubated.  On [**2-16**] he
was reintubated secondary to hypercarbia and he also had an
episode of hypertension treated with a nitroglycerin drip and
Captopril and Diltiazem.  On [**2160-2-17**] the patient
self extubated.  He had an episode of atrial fibrillation
soon thereafter.  He was placed on a Diltiazem drip.  He was
in respiratory distress and started on Procainamide, which
led to normal sinus rhythm.  On [**2-21**] the patient was
lethargic and wheezing and he was reintubated.  Vancomycin
was added for pneumonia.  On [**2160-2-26**] the patient
attempted extubation without success.  He had continued
diuresis.  Thereafter a family meeting was held in which the
patient was made DNR/DNI.  The ventilator was weaned and the

called out to the floor for further management.

On the medical flor the patient's pneumonia and hypertension
were continued to be treated.  He was continued on
intravenous Decadron for his meningioma.  Extensive family
meetings took place on a daily basis to discus the status of
the patient.  On approximately [**2160-3-5**] the patient
had an episode of desaturation, which was treated on concert
with the family's wishes with Lasix and gentle suctioning.
The patient's O2 saturations were covered, but he needed to
maintain 100% face mask oxygen where he had been on 40% face
mask.  Following this the family elected to continue tube
feeds, antibiotics and blood pressure medication, but decided
to limit further treatments to those designed exclusively for
comfort only.  For example, they wished no further Lasix or
suctioning for the patient.  He was continued on his tube
feeds, antibiotics and blood pressure medications.  On

determined that the patient had expired and death was
pronounced at 11:55 a.m. on [**2160-3-7**].
