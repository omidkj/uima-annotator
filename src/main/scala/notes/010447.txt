History of Present Illness:
This is an 80 year old man who was brought to [**Hospital1 2436**] ED by
EMS with complaint of sudden severe onset headache, left sided
hemiparesis, and decreased LOC. CT brain was performed and this
showed a large right frontotemporal acute SDH with 14 mm of
midline shift. At 1510 hrs patient had an abrupt deterioration
in the ED, becoming minimally responsive, and he was
intubated.

Mental status: GCS 3
Cranial Nerves: not tested

Sensation: not tested

On Discharge: Patient Expired

Pertinent Results:
CT head [**2181-12-15**]:
Right frontal intraparenchymal blood products with mild shift of
midline
structures. Mild periventricular and subcortical white matter
hypoattenuation likely represents sequelae of small vessel
ischemic disease. No prior study available. Correlation with
pre-surgical study will help for better assessment.

Chest X-ray [**2181-12-18**]:
In comparison with the study of [**12-17**], the monitoring and support

devices remain in place. Continued enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette with right pleural effusion and some elevation of
pulmonary venous pressure. The obliquity of the patient's
scoliosis makes it somewhat difficult to evaluate the lungs.
Left hemidiaphragm is not sharply seen, consistent with volume
loss or effusion at the left base.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 9780**] was taken emergently to the OR with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**] for a
right craniotomy for evacuation of SDH. A JP drain was left in
place. He was transferred to the ICU intubated. His exam
remained poor with sluggish pupils, no dolls eyes, positive
corneal and gag, and decerebrate posturing. CT head on [**2181-12-15**]
showed good decompression and no new hemorrhage. The drain was
left in place.

On [**12-16**] his subdural drain was switched to a non-suction
drainage system as he had increased output. His exam remained
unchanged.

On [**12-17**] Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**] spoke with the patient's wife regarding
prognosis and plan. His drain was removed and stitch was placed.

On [**12-18**], Mr. [**Known lastname 88115**] exam was unchanged. The family decided to
initiate CMO status. THe patient was extubated, and all
recussitation efforts were stopped.  The patient expired around
[**2201**] on [**12-18**] with his family at his bedside.
