Brief Hospital Course:
87 yo F with HTN, CAD s/p MI with LAD/RCA stents in [**2112**], DM2 on
insulin, PVD, and dementia (?nonverbal at baseline) transferred
from [**Hospital **] Hospital with SOB from fluid overload and L foot
ulcer.
.
* SOB: The patient's SOB was thought likely to be due to fluid
overload; Chest X-Ray and Chest CT revealed moderate CHF; BNP
[**Numeric Identifier 30174**].  This was most probably from diastolic dysfunction as she
had a normal EF on previous echos.  There was no evidence of
infiltrate on CXR or CT.  It was unlikely to be a PE as she was
on standing SC heparin.  While in house, strict I/Os were
monitored with gentle diuresis with PRN lasix for goal 500cc - 1
L negative per day.  Oxygen was given as needed to maintain
saturation of 93% or above. Patient was satting better than 95%
on room air on discharge.
.
*Foot Ulcer: Her left foot ulcer was assessed by vascular
surgery out of the primary team's concern for osteomyelitis.
The wound was debrided by vascular surgery on [**11-18**] and wound
culture was sent.  She was placed on vancomycin for empiric
coverage, dosed by levels.  Arterial duplex studies were done.
The surgical team recommended amputation before the patient
became septic.  No other revascularization was recommended.  Her
son felt that amputation was against his mother's wishes, and
opted for conservative management.  Her wound was cleaned with
Dakin's solution and dressed with wet to dry dressings [**Hospital1 **].  She
was to complete a six week course of vancomycin (her first dose
here was on [**2118-11-19**]) for her presumed osteomyelitis, although
amputation was considered the best treatment.
.
*UTI: The patient had a UA suspicious of UTI, but epithelial
cells were present.  Repeat  UA also showed signs of infection.
A urine cx was sent.  The patient was continued on levofloxacin
(dosed Q48 hours).  She was to complete a 10 day course of
antibiotics and her regimen
