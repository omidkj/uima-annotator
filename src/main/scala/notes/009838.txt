Chief Complaint:
Respiratory Failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Placement of PICC


History of Present Illness:
HPI: 59M CHF, DM2, partial colectomy with enterocutaneous
fistula (developed several yrs ago, thought to be [**3-2**] Gun Shot
Wound with left colectomy in [**2164**]), afib, DVT 8 yrs ago, who
originally presented to [**Hospital 1474**] hospital on [**2197-6-6**] for workup
of anemia and inpatient TTE.
.
Patiently initially was evaluated with symptomatic shortness of
breath and fatigue; hct on [**6-6**] was 31.4 (this is his baseline
according to OSH). TTE was performed which showed an EF=15-20%;
He was also found to be in afib/aflutter (?new); diltiazem gtt
was started for rate control. His hematocrit decreased through
the hospitalization. His cardiomyopathy was felt to be new and
perhaps secondary to uncontrolled atrial fibrilation. His
creatinine was also found to be rising throughout
hospitalization (CRI with Cr=2.0, peak of 5.4). He also
developed delta MS, and was subsequently found to be hypercarbic
with subsequent bipap initiation. On HD #6 @ OSH, his WBC
increased to 37, Tmax was 100.3, and he was subsequently started
on broad spectrum abx (vanco/zosyn - 1st day [**6-11**]?). On the
night of [**6-12**], he was transiently hypotensive (SBP to 60s,
duration unknown), and he was intubated at this time for
hypercapneic respiratory failure. He was transferred to the ICU
at this time. He then became hypotensive in the ICU, again with
SBP in 60s, and was started on phenylephrine and dopamine at
this time. An intraabdominal source of infection was suspected,
but pt could not fit in CT-scanner. He was transferred here for
further management, imaging, and evaluation.

Pertinent Labs/Studies:
.
Labs/Studies:
.
[**2197-6-14**]: Portable Chest - IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural
effusions with associated atelectasis.  An underlying pneumonic
process cannot be excluded in the left lower lobe.
.
[**2197-6-15**]: Echo - The left atrium is mildly dilated. The inferior
vena cava is dilated (>2.5 cm). Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is moderately-to-severely depressed (ejection fraction 30
percent) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the entire
interventricular septum; the inferior and
posterior walls are hyperdynamic. No masses or thrombi are seen
in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic root is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
[**2197-6-16**]: PICC placement - IMPRESSION:  Malpositioned PICC
terminating in the right subclavian vein. Contra-abnormalities
in the region of the azygos vein may represent mass,
lymphadopathy, or prominence of the azygos vein due to vascular
congestion. No change in interstitial edema or left lower lobe
consolidation/collapse.
.
[**2197-6-17**]: The endotracheal tube is being removed.  The heart is
enlarged.  Bilateral effusions are present, larger on the left
than the right.  Left hemidiaphragm is not obscured and a
consolidation and/or atelectasis in left lower lobe is not
excluded.  There is some pulmonary plethora consistent with
failure.
IMPRESSION:  Some evidence of failure with bilateral effusions.
.
[**2197-6-18**]: Portable Abdomen - TWO UPRIGHT VIEWS OF THE ABDOMEN:
The study is incredibly limited by patient body habitus.  The
abdominal structures appear uniformally white. This study is
nondiagnostic.
.
[**2197-6-22**]: P-MIBI - INTERPRETATION: This 59 yo diabetic male with
a h/o CAD & CHF was referred to the lab for evaluation of new
WMA. The patient was infused with 0.142 mg/kg/min of IV
Persantine over 4 minutes. The patient denied any arm, neck,
back or chest discomfort throughout the study. There were no
significant ST segment changes noted beyond baseline. The rhythm
was atrial flutter with rare VPB's. There was an appropriate
blood pressure response; heart rate response was flat.
Persantine was reversed with 125 mg of IV Aminophylline.
IMPRESSION: No EKG changes from baseline in the absence of
anginal
symptoms. Nuclear report sent separately.
.
MIBI - 1. Markedly limited study due to body habitus, such that
only gated planar study could be performed.  Limited
interpretation suggests fixed inferior wall defect with regional
abnormal wall motion.
.
[**2197-6-28**]: Renal US - Slightly malrotated right kidney.  No
hydronephrosis
