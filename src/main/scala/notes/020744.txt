Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4765**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain, STEMI


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with drug eluting stent x 2 to the R PLA


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 107788**] is a 45 YOM with 18-year h/o HIV, compliant with HAART
therapy, and no previous cardiac history who presented to his
PCPs office today with complaint of chest pain.  He states that
he developed chest pain that radiated to both arms last night
while sitting and watching TV.  It lasted about 1 hr and went
away.  This morning he developed the same chest pain again with
shortness of breath, only with increased intensity [**8-4**] which
prompted him to go to his PCPs office.  He denied nausea, or
diaphoresis with the pain.  He was referred to the ED where an
EKG showed NSR, rate 96, nml axis and > 5mm ST elevations in II,
III, avF, and depressions in V1-V4.  Code STEMI was called and
he received ativan 0.5 mg IV, asa 365 mg, SL nitro, 600 mg
plavix, and was started on heparin gtt.  He was chest pain free
after the SL nitro.

[**2153-5-9**] Cardiac catheterization
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease and moderate LMCA
 disease2.
2.
3.
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the distal RPL with two
overlapping
Promus DESs
5. Successful closure of the RCFA with 6F Angioseal
6. [**Month (only) 116**] need PCI of the LCX OM branch as long as LMCA disease not

progressed. Consider ETT during follow up versus relook cath
depending
on symptoms

[**2153-5-10**] Echocardiogram:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed
(LVEF= 35 %) secondary to akinesis of the inferior free wall,
and hypkonesis of the inferior septum and posterior wall. There
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.

[**2153-5-11**] chest x ray
FINDINGS: Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal
and without change. New patchy opacity has developed in left
retrocardiac region, and could potentially represent an early
focus of pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. Lungs
are slightly overexpanded but otherwise grossly clear.

[**2153-5-11**] groin ultrasound
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hematoma or pseudoaneurysm in the
right groin.
Normal arterial and venous waveforms.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Coronary artery disease/STEMI:
Mr. [**Known lastname 107788**] had ST elevations in the inferior distribution with ST
depressions in the anterior leads indicating a posterior
infarct.  A code STEMI was called int he ED.  He was taken for
catheterization which showed 50% stenosis of the LMCA and total
occlusion of the large RPL.  He also had mild diffuse disease of
the LAD at the origin of the D1 and 50-60% stenosis of the D2,
70% stenosis of the OM, and proximal 40% stenosis of the RCA.
He had successful [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 3 placed in his RCA.  He was started on
clopidogrel 150 mg a day and should continue this for a total of
7 days before decreaing to 75 mg once a day.  He was also
started on aspirin 325 mg.  His echocardiogram showed depressed
EF of 35%.  He was started on lisinopril 5 mg once a day and
metoprolol tartrate 25 mg [**Hospital1 **], which was converted to 50 mg
metoprolol succinate at discharge.  His BP remained in the 120s
on this regimen.  He should have his electrolytes monitored and
the lisinopril and beta blocker titrated up as tolerated.  He
was also started on atorvastatin 80 mg, but this was decreased
to 40 mg as its hepatic clearence is affected by his Kaletra.
He should remain on the lower dose of 40 mg a day and be
monitored for signs of hepatic toxicity and myalgias.  He will
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who performed his catheterization.
Someone will call him to [**Last Name (STitle) **] the appointment in 4 weeks.
At his follow up appointment he should discuss whether he will
pursue surgery for his multi vessel disease.

2. Cough, shortness of breath: Mr. [**Known lastname 107788**] developed symptoms of
dyspnea and worsenign cough after his catheterization.  He
stated that he had been having cough for a while (and recently
was hospitalized for a URI).  Chest x ray showed patchy opacity
in left the retrocardiac region.  He was started on IV
ceftriaxone and azithromycin for community acquired pneumonia.
The following morning he developed worsening wheeze and IV
steroids were started as well as nebulizers.  He was also
supported with expectorants and supplemental O2.  His
