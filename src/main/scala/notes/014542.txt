Service: NEUROSURGERY

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**]
Chief Complaint:
fall, change in mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**Name (NI) 11575**] pterional craniotomy for micro surgical clip repair
of aneurysm, and left-sided EVT placement.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 72-year-old gentleman who was
transferred from an outside hospital. He was found by a
neighbor after a mechanical fall with unresponsiveness. He
was brought to an outside facility and diagnosed with
subarachnoid hemorrhage. The patient is on Coumadin for AFib
and was initially with an INR of 4.1, highly anticoagulated.
He was reversed and brought to the [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Hospital for
further management. On arrival, he had a GCS of 8. He was
responding to commands. He was worked up with a CT/CTA and
later had a 4-vessel cerebral angiogram which revealed an
anterior communicating artery aneurysm approximately 6 mm in
size with take-off from the communicating artery on the right
side pointed towards anterior to inferior, and lateral. The
patient had to undergo micro surgical clip repair.

FINDINGS: Note is made of extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage, in
bilateral sylvian fissures, interhemispheric fissure,
cerebellopontine cistern, and sulci of the temporal and parietal
lobes. Note is made of hemorrhage contusions within both frontal
lobes and the right occipital lobe. There is mi mild mass effect
from bilateral frontal subdural collections, but the basal
cisternal spaces are well visualized. Ther is also a widened
subdural space in the left posterior fossa.

On contrast enhanced images, note is made of 5 mm aneurysm of
the anterior communicating arteries. No evidence of other
aneurysm is noted. Carotid arterial bifurcations in the neck
demonstrate atherosclerotic change. Left proximal internal
carotid artery is severely narrowed, and right internal carotid
artery is moderately narrowed. Left vertebral artery is small.

Multiplanar reformation demonstrated normal vascular anatomy, as
well as above-mentioned anterior communicating aneurysm.

IMPRESSION: 1) Extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage as described
above, with bilateral frontal and left posterior fossa subdural
collections. There is no herniation at this time. Contusions in
the frontal lobes and right occipital lobe ar noted.

2) 5 mm anterior communicating artery aneurysm as described
above.

3) Bilateral internal carotid artery narrowing, severe on the
left and moderate on the right.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was taken to the operating room semi-electively on
[**2161-8-13**] in the a.m. for right-sided pterional craniotomy
for micro surgical clip repair of aneurysm, and left-sided EVT
placement.  The patient was intubated, sedated and ventilated.
The patient came from the ICU. He had adequate IV lines in
place.
He had an A-line in place.  Surgery was uncomplicated, and the
patient had w/d to painful stimuli on right side of chest with
some movement of right hand postoperatively.  No movement was
noted initially on left side.  Pupils were unchanged, but there
was no withdrawal to painful stimuli inthe lower extremities.
Q1hr neuro checks were initiated, with CO2 goal range 35-40, and
sbp goal 100-140.  Nimodipine had been initiated.  The patient
was scheduled for angio in the morning.  Angio was
uncomplicated, and there was no vasospasm.  Dilantin and
decadron were added.  Post-procedure pulse checks were normal.
However, his physical exam showed unreactive pupils, and over
the next several days his exam worsened slightly.  Subsequent
head CT's had shown caudate infarcts but decreased midline shift
and stable bleed.  He was not able to wean from the vent, and he
had signs of infection including elevated wbc count and fever.
He was initiated on broad spectrum antibiotics and when his
sputum grew MRSA, he was started on vanco.  CSF cultures were
negative to date, and there were no abnormalities of
intracranial pressure.  As his exam had not improved, a family
meeting was held and his family opted to make comfort care the
goal.  He was made CMO on [**2161-8-19**] and was extubated and started
on morphine.  He unfortunately expired at 8:16 PM on [**2161-8-19**].
Family was present in the room and declined autopsy.
