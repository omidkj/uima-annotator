Service:  [**Hospital1 212**] AND MICU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 57-year-old woman with
a history of anxiety, congestive heart failure, congestive
obstructive pulmonary disease, and a question of interstitial
lung disease who presented to the [**Hospital3 45967**] on
[**2161-2-12**] with complaints of shortness of breath and
anxiety.  The patient states that she has had increasing
agoraphobia and panic attacks since [**Holiday 1451**] of [**2160**].
Patient states her shortness of breath episodes were getting
progressively worse one week prior to admission at the
outside hospital.

Patient returned to the Emergency Department, and had a chest
x-ray demonstrating congestive heart failure.  Was given
aspirin, nitroglycerin, and Lasix.  At that time,
echocardiogram revealed moderate AS with peak gradient of 44.
RV dilatation and P.A. pressures in the range of 70-75.  The
patient's O2 saturation was in the mid 80s on room air which
increased to 96% on 100% nonrebreather.  Electrocardiogram
was significant for anterolateral T-wave changes and a
troponin of 2.6.  CK was 64.  Transaminases were also noted
to be elevated, hematocrit of 28.8.

Arterial blood gas was performed in the Emergency Department
demonstrating 7.39/21/34.  BUN was 46 and creatinine was 3.1
up from her baseline of 2.0.  Patient was admitted to the
Intensive Care Unit.

A high resolution CT scan was performed which demonstrated
upper mediastinal lymphadenopathy in the pretracheal and
precarinal region, cardiomegaly, no pericardial effusion was
noted, prominent interstitial densities and emphysematous
changes were noted.

Renal ultrasound was performed which demonstrated
hydronephrosis.

Chest x-ray on [**2-13**] demonstrated worsening interstitial and
alveolar process and nondiffuse consolidation of both lung
fields noted on chest x-ray.

Patient received empiric IV antibiotics and diuresed with IV
Lasix with subjective improvement in her shortness of breath.
Cultures were reportedly negative.  Cardiology was consulted
and the Intensive Care Unit for the troponin leak which
peaked at 5.8, and she was started on Plavix and Imdur for a
non-Q-wave myocardial infarction.  Renal was consulted and
vasculitis workup was performed with rheumatoid factor, [**Doctor First Name **],
P-ANCA, C-ANCA, C3 and C4 all of which returned negative.
Hematocrit evaluation was performed which revealed an iron
deficiency anemia.  She was transfused 1 unit of packed red
blood cells and had an appropriate increase in her
hematocrit.  Plan for a biopsy of her lung was encouraged,
but the patient refused.  She wanted a second opinion in
[**Location (un) 86**], and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 190**].

It appears that the patient was doing well until five years
ago with minimal exertion.  She was seen four years ago and
diagnosed with bronchitis.  She saw Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 45968**] at
Costal [**Last Name (un) **] in [**Hospital1 789**], and was told she had probable
sarcoid base on imaging.  In [**2158-7-13**], she had a
bronchoscopy with nondiagnostic biopsies followed by
mediastinoscopy with nondiagnostic biopsy.  That was
performed which demonstrated scarring, but no sarcoid and no
cancer.  Underwent three month trial with prednisone 40 mg po
q day without response.

Since that time, she has noted gradual decline.  Began to
develop panic attacks in [**2160-11-11**], and had not left
her home since [**Holiday 1451**] of [**2160**].  She also did not see
doctor due to this problem.  In [**2161-1-11**], she was
diagnosed with pneumonia based on chest x-ray and
examination.  Initiate prednisone and some type of
antibiotic.  Her dyspnea continued to worsen at which point,
she referred to [**Hospital3 45967**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted and had CT scan of
the chest without contrast performed which demonstrated
diffuse ground-glass opacification with underlying fibrotic
lung disease and extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy
consistent with sarcoid.  However, multiple other etiologies
were possible.  Biopsy was thought to be needed for
definitive diagnosis.

Pulmonary and the Medical team consulted throughout her
surgery for VATS.  Throughout her surgery, agreed that biopsy
was needed for medical management and discussed with the team
and the patient.  Postprocedure ventilation would most likely
be required due to the patient's worsening shortness of
breath and poor functional status.

The patient was brought to the operating room and had a
procedure done which demonstrated extremely inflated, effused
lung with friable tissue and bleeding.  In the PACU, she had
hypoxia, severe pulmonary hypertension, and shock.  Pulmonary
artery pressures in the 100s/50s, systemic pressures of
90s/40s.  Patient required initially Neo-Synephrine which was
changed to dobutamine, which was then titrated off.  As
oxygenation improved, pulmonary artery pressure decreased to
the 60s/65.

Arterial blood gas at one point was 7.12/75/118.  Patient was
transferred to the MICU for further management.  Of note, the
patient's procedure initially was thoracoscopy which had to
be converted to open lung biopsy due to bleeding.  Nitrous
oxide was also started in the PACU which helped to bring the
patient's pulmonary pressures down as well.

As the patient was in the MICU, her nitrous oxide was slowly
weaned off.  The patient had several hypotensive episodes
which were treated with intravenous fluids with fair
improvement.  Patient's biopsy returned as acute organizing
pneumonitis with marked type II pneumocyte hyperplasia in the
background of interstitial fibrosis consistent with
organizing stage of ARDS.  Patient's chest tubes remained on
persistent suction due to an air leak which was not unusual
given her high pulmonary pressures and significant pulmonary
fibrosis.

Patient's ventilatory support was attempted to wean with
decreasing levels of PEEP.  Patient's sedation was titrated
down, however, the patient could not tolerate ventilatory
setting with decreas
