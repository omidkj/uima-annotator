Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1390**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain and distension


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2171-11-5**]:
Exploratory laparotomy, partial transverse colectomy with
primary anastomosis, partial gastric resection, placement of
gastrostomy tube.

[**2171-11-11**]:
Exploratory laparotomy and closure of fascial dehiscence.

[**2171-11-20**]:
Therapeutic bilateral thoracocentesis.

[**2171-11-21**]:
Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage.

[**2171-11-22**]:
Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage.
Gastrostomy/jejunostomy tube placement.


History of Present Illness:
83M with multiple medical problems, s/p CABGx4 on [**2171-7-29**].
Post-op course was complicated by hemodynamic instability
requiring vasopressor support, as well as ventricular ectopy and
bradycardia requiring a temporary pacer. This was removed.  Of
note the patient required re-intubation several times during the
[**Hospital **] hospital course, and eventually received a trach and PEG
on [**2171-8-30**]. He was transferred to rehab on [**2171-9-12**] and returned
on [**2171-9-13**] with fever and hypotension. During this
hospitalization he was found to have C. Diff in the stool and
was placed on flagyl and PO vanc. There was question of
malposition of G-tube on CT scan, so urgent EGD was performed.
Tube was re-positioned without complication. Contrast study was
negative for extravasation. Tube feeds were resumed and finally
discharged to a vented rehab on [**2171-9-23**].  The patient comes back
with increased abdominal distention and output from the PEG. He
exhibited peritoneal signs and there was CT evidence of free
air, dislodged PEG and dilated small bowel in mid abdomen with
distally decompressed small bowel - read as partial vs early
SBO. He was immediately taken to the OR for ex-lap.

Social History:
Lives with wife (in-law apartment- daughter +fam live nearby)
but came to [**Hospital1 18**] from rehab, at baseline he uses Canadian
crutches for ambulation ([**3-12**] OA of knees).  He is retired.

   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2171-11-6**]):
      YEAST.    10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..

ECG [**2171-11-5**] showed:
Atrial fibrillation. Q-T interval prolongation. T wave
abnormalities. Since the previous tracing of [**2171-9-13**] there is
probably no significant change.

CT abdomen/pelvis [**2171-11-5**] showed:
1. Small left and moderate right pleural effusions, incompletely
imaged, with underlying atelectasis/consolidation.
2. Free intraperitoneal air, mostly anterior to the liver. PEG
tube appears to be external to the stomach, and may have become
dislodged since the recent G-tube check, which would account for
the free intraperitoneal air. This could be further [**Year (4 digits) 6349**]
with formal fluoroscopic G-tube study.
3. Moderate-to-severe right hydronephrosis. 7-mm right proximal
ureteral stone.
4. Small amount of ascites, increased from [**2171-9-13**].
5. Dilated small bowel in the mid abdomen, with distally
decompressed small bowel. Early or partial small-bowel
obstruction cannot be excluded, although ileus is favored given
the concurrent processes.
6. Small bowel herniating through a small umbilical hernia. Both
the entering and exiting loops of bowel are collapsed.
Therefore, this is not a transition point.

CXR [**2171-11-5**] showed:
Interval development of large right pleural effusion
predominantly layering posteriorly. There is superimposed
pulmonary edema likely cardiogenic in origin. Incomplete
evaluation given lack of inclusion of costophrenic angles.

      Fluid should not be sent in swab transport media.  Submit
fluids in a
      capped syringe (no needle), red top tube, or sterile cup.

represent small bowel loops. No definitive colonic distention is
