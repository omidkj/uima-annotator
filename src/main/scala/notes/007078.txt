History of Present Illness:
43 year old woman with hepatitis C cirrhosis (complicated by
ascites, encephalopathy, portal hypertensive gastropathy, grade
1 varices, hepatic hydrothorax, elevated AFP without focal liver
lesions) and HIV who presents with increased shortness of breath
.
She has recently experienced increasingly rapid reaccumulation
of her hepatic hydrothorax, requiring 3 weekly thoracenteses
since [**2179-5-23**]. She was admitted to [**Hospital 794**] Hospital
yesterday with SOB and increased O2 requirement. They did a 2
liter thoracentesis and admitted her because her Cr was up to
1.5 from 1.0, K 5.9 and her WBC is up to 20 from 7.8. She
received IVF and albumin for ARF but this continued to worsen
and her Cr was 1.9 prior to transfer. In term of her presumed
infection they are unsure of the source and unfortunately they
didnt send the fluid from the [**Female First Name (un) 576**] for cell count or culture
but did a paracentesis to evaluate for SBP. She was given
ciprofloxacin IV initially but this was later broadened to
cefotaxime and vancomycin.
.
On arrival to the floor, she states she is feeling well but is
still having baseline mild abdominal pain.
.
ROS: (+) baseline abdominal pain. Nausea, vomiting at OSH in the
setting of narcotic medications.
Denies fever, chills, headache, sore throat, cough, shortness of
breath, chest pain, dysuria, hematuria.

Brief Hospital Course:
43F with history of Hep C cirrhosis (complicated by ascites,
encephalopathy, portal hypertensive gastropathy, grade 1
varices, hepatic hydrothorax, elevated AFP) and HIV (CD4 303 in
early [**2179-4-20**])who transferred from [**Hospital 794**] Hospital with SOB
[**12-22**] recurrent hepatic hydrothorax, ARF, and leukocytosis [**12-22**] to
now known SBP. She requiring weekly or biweekly thoracenteses
since [**Month (only) 205**]. MELD score in 40s-50s and awaiting transplant.

She was admitted to the medicine service s/p thoracentesis at
the OSH, and was not in respiratory distress on arrival.
Diagnostic paracentesis was done and showed SBP, requiring 5-day
treatment course with Ceftriaxone.  Due to increasing
respiratory distress, a thoracentesis was done for 3.3L on [**7-29**],
transudative fluid on analysis.  Her post-[**Female First Name (un) 576**] course was
complicated by re-expansion pulmonary edema and tachypnea,
requiring transfer to the SICU for a day.  Repeat CXRs from that
point showed only bilateral effusions without recurrence of the
hydrothorax.  There was a question of new consolidation on the
post-ICU CXR and an 8-day treatment for hospital-acquired
pneumonia was started with Cefepime/Flagyl/Vancomycin.  As her
liver function began to decline precipitously, the decision was
made to leave her antibiotics on-board to prevent any infections
that may prevent her from undergoing surgery while waiting for a
transplant to arrive.

She experienced ARF likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome.
MELD steadily increased, to a peak of >50. HAART was
discontinued due to worsening renal function. Dialysis was
started.  Nutritional status was poor. Anemia was treated with
transfusions every few days.

On [**2179-8-16**] an ECD liver donor was available and she underwent
liver transplant with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy.  Intra-op
course was complicated by hypothermia ([**12-22**] to CVVH), persistent
coagulopathy, prolonged time to HA reperfusion (90 min), delayed
graft function. Over the first 24 hours post-op, she continued
to be coagulopathic with a falling hematocrit along with rising
LFTs (1550/[**2168**], TB 10.9). Liver duplex was normal.

On [**2179-8-18**] she required exploration, hematoma evacuation. Liver
appeared hyperemic but viable with good pulse in the hepatic
artery. Hepaticojej was intact. LFTs continued to rise
(2800/3000, TB 17) and lactate remained elevated. She was
relisted for primary graft non-function on postop day 2.

By POD 6 she was extubated. LFTs were steadily improving
(ALT/AST 170/664, TB13.5) therefore she was delisted from the
transplant list. TBili began to rise from POD 7 reaching 60.8 by
POD 12. Liver duplex demonstrated parvus tardus arterial
waveforms which later resolved.

WBC rose to 17. Blood cultures were sent. On [**8-24**], blood
cultures were positive for enterococcus faecalis vanco
sensitive. Daptomycin and Zosyn were started and continued for
16 days. Rectal swab als
