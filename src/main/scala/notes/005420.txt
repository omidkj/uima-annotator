CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Garbled speech.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old
woman with a history of a left middle cerebral artery stroke
in [**2106-4-15**] resulting in right-sided hemiparesis.  This
was treated with intravenous t-PA, and she recovered
dramatically from this.

The patient was in her usual state of health until this
morning at 7:30 a.m. when she was noted by the [**Hospital3 1761**] staff to have fallen out of her chair to the
right.  She apparently hit her head on the right side and was
put back into bed.  She was apparently noted to be confused
and sleep shortly thereafter with "inappropriate responses."
She was also noted to have slurred speech followed by
increased sleepiness.  She was also noted to have
word-finding difficulties by the examining physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
daughter was called at 11:30 a.m., and she noted that the
patient was lying in bed and was sleepy.  She noticed that
her "speech was garbled."  The words did not sound like real
words, and it was difficult to understand her.  There was no
fever at that time, and a blood pressure of 170/90 was noted
at the onset.

She was transferred to the [**Hospital1 188**] Emergency Department for further evaluation.  She was
noted to be progressively sleepy at [**Hospital3 **],
but on arrival to the [**Hospital1 69**]
Emergency Department the patient was awake and fighting the
cervical collar.  She was given 5 mg of Haldol and 2 mg of
Ativan for agitation to get into the computed tomography
scanner.  Since then she has been more somnolent and has not
appeared to understand commands.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in [**Hospital3 **]
and has two daughters.  [**Name (NI) **] husband passed away in [**2101**].

FAMILY HISTORY:   Family history not obtained at this time.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed the patient's temperature was 100.8 degrees
Fahrenheit rectally, blood pressure was 130/55, her heart
rate was 80, her respiratory rate was 18, and her oxygen
saturation was 100% on 2 liters nasal cannula.  In general,
the patient was an elderly woman lying in bed with a cervical
collar on.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination
revealed the mucous membranes were moist.  The head was
normocephalic and atraumatic.  The lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular examination
revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, or
gallops.  The abdomen was soft, and there was no
hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremity examination revealed a
deformed left foot with no pedal edema.  On neurologic
examination, mental status revealed the patient was initially
stuporous and did not open her eyes to voice or to sternal
rub after her Haldol and Ativan.  Cranial nerve examination
revealed the optic disks were difficult to visualize due to
the size (which was 2 mm).  The eye movements were normal,
and the pupils did react normally to light.  The corneas were
intact.  The gag reflex was present but depressed.  The face
appeared symmetric.  There was no nystagmus.  The
oculocephalic reflex was initially not obtained to the risk
of cervical spine injury.  There was a slight left gaze
deviation.  Motor testing revealed the patient spontaneously
moved all four extremities.  She withdrew to pain in the
lower extremities.  There were some occasional irregular low
amplitude twitching at the left hip joint that was not
prominent.  There was also some right arm twitching which
also appeared as well.  This was not noted after the initial
evening of admission.  Reflex testing revealed the deep
tendon reflexes were all present except for the patella and
Achilles.  They seemed brisker in the right upper
extremities, but this was very subtle.  The plantar responses
were equivocal.  On sensory examination, the patient withdrew
to pain in the big toes.  She grimaced to pain in the
fingers.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Computed tomography scan of the
head on admission revealed there was a left posterotemporal
lobe hemorrhage approximately 3 cm in diameter and
approximately 20 cc total in volume.  There was minimal mass
effect.  There was no shift at the midline structures.

There was also a computed tomography scan of the cervical
spine which showed no evidence of fracture.

A chest x-ray on admission was normal.

A repeat chest x-ray in the evening of [**11-1**] and in the
morning of [**11-2**] showed no evidence of increase in
size.

She was also given a computed tomography of the head with
contrast which did not show any evidence for a metastasis
behind the bleed; although this was obscured by the blood
itself.

A chest x-ray on [**2106-11-3**] showed some interstitial
edema, and no definite evidence of pneumonia.

A chest x-ray following this (on [**2106-11-4**]) appeared
improved.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  FALL AND APHASIA ISSUES:  The patient had an
approximately 20-cc left temporal lobe bleed diagnosed with
the computed tomography scan on admission.

She was put on a Nipride drip to keep her blood pressure in
the 140 to 160 range systolically.  Initially, she presented
to the Emergency Department with a blood pressure of 240/70.
Her blood pressure was well controlled on the Nipride, and by
the time she was admitted to the Neurology Intensive Care
Unit, the Nipride was able to be discontinued.  Her systolic
blood pressures remained between 140s to 160s throughout her
hospitalization.

She was loaded on Dilantin in the Emergency Department;
however, the Neurology team felt that she did not need to be
on seizure prophylaxis for this bleed.  The differential for
the bleed included hypertensive bleed versus amyloid
angiopathy versus hemorrhagic metastasis versus contusion
being the least likely.  We held her Plavix during the
hospital course here.

A repeat computed tomography scan did not show extension of
the bleed.  Her hematocrit remained stable, and her
coagulation studies were normal.  Her Chemistry-7 values were
unremarkable except for a slightly low potassium on the day
of discharge.  She did have one set of cardiac enzymes which
were negative.  Her digoxin level was normal at 0.8.

She initially had a receptive aphasia; not being able to
understand commands, but by the day prior to discharge she
was able to follow simple commands in the limbs and in the
midline; however, she still did not have understandable
spontaneous speech.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  The patient remained on telemetry
and was A-paced in the 70s.  She did have some blood pressure
elevations; especially while agitated.  As stated before, the
Nipride was discontinued and she remained well with this but
did have to be given her by mouth metoprolol.  She tolerated
this okay, and the plan was to continue her on metoprolol by
mouth twice per day until we can insure that the Toprol-XL
will be controlling her all day long.

She had a slight oxygen requirement requiring 2 liters to 3
liters nasal cannula.  A chest x-ray was ob
