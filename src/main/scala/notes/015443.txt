History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 44 year-old lady, with a past medical history of
hypothyroidism and depression, who was admitted after a VF
arrest.  History was obtained from family members, Med [**Name2 (NI) **]
and records, as the patient was already intubated and sedated.
She was in her usual state of health until this morning when she
was at work.  At around 11:30 this morning, she began to have
nausea, indigestion and burping, accompanied by tingling in her
arms.  She went to the bathroom, whereshe looked the door and
lost consciousness.  Her co-workers called EMS when they heard a
thump.  When EMS arrived at 11:45 am, she was found to be in VF
arrest.  CPR was performed for 8 minutes.  The patient was
defibrillated twice and given epinephrine three times.  There
was return of rhythm and spontaneous circulation, with heart
rate in the 150 bpm.  Cooling protocol was initiated
immediately.  She was loaded with amiodarone 300 mg, intubated,
given an intraosseus line and taken to the [**Hospital **] Hospital
Emergency Department.  She arrive at [**Location (un) **] at 12:07 and was
found to be in a junctional rhythm.  Labs were significant for
bicarb 15; cardiac enzymes were CK 71, CK-MB 1.3, index 1.8 and
trp I 0.02.  She was started on dopamine gtt for hypotension.
Head CT there was negative for any acute intracranial processes.
 The patient was taken to the Cath Lab, where she demonstrated
clean coronary arteries, EF 35% on ventriculogram and mild
hypokinesis of the anterior wall and apex.  In the Cath Lab,
dopamine was switched to norephinephrine 5 mcg/min, and she was
started on heparin.  An intraaortic balloon pump was placed via
the right femoral artery.  She was given furosemide 40 mg IV in
the Cath Lab for pulmonary edema demonstrated on chest x-ray.
.
The patient was transported to [**Hospital1 18**] by Med Flight.  During
transport at 13:30, ABG was 7.14/43/120/14.  She was noted to be
shivering, gagging and clenching her jaw during transport, and
was give pancuronium 6 mg, fentanyl 200 mg and midazolam 4 mg.
Cooling protocol was continued.  Norepinephrine was weaned off
at 16:45.  Her vent settings were AC 450/5/16/100%.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU, the patient was intubated and
sedated with balloon pump and PA catheter in place by right
femoral sheath.  Vital signs on admission were T 34.6 HR 98 BP
135/87 SaO2 99% on AC 500/8/20/100%.  She had a large amount of
stool soon after presentation.  A left radial arterial line was
placed and peripheral IVs inserted.  Her temperature reached 33
degrees at 17:00.
.
Unable to perform review of symptoms, as the patient was
intubated and sedated.
