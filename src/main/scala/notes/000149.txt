Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Fatigue


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2189-2-27**] - Redo sternotomy x2 with resection of ascending aortic
aneurysm and ascending aortic replacement with a 32-mm Gelweave
tube graft under deep hypothermic circulatory arrest and redo
coronary artery bypass grafting x4.
[**2189-3-2**] - Mediastinal washout and chest closure

History of Present Illness:
This 78 year old man with prior CABGx4 in [**2175**], a redo CABGx1
and mitral valve repair in [**2178**] now has an ascending aortic
aneurysm which he has known about since [**2184**]. This has been
followed by serial CT scans and has shown nearly a 1cm growth
over the past 3 years. It now measures 6cm. Of note he two
previous cardiac surgeries were complicated by bleeding with
re-exploration. Given the size of his aneurysm he has been
referred for surgical evaluation. He denies any symptoms other
then fatigue.

Pertinent Results:
[**2189-2-27**] ECHO
PRE-BYPASS: 1. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body
of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. The left atrial
appendage emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s).
2. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal
to distal inferior and septal walls. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %).
4. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
5. The ascending aorta is severely dilated. There are simple
atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in
the aortic arch. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly
dilated. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta.
6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**12-22**]+) aortic regurgitation is
seen.
7. A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present. An eccentric,
anteriorly directed jet of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen.
8. There is no pericardial effusion.
POST-BYPASS:
1. The patient is V paced. The patient is on epinephrine,
milrinone, and norepinephrine infusions.
2. Left ventricular function appears moderately depressed (LVEF
= 35-40%)
3. The right ventricle is severely dilated with severe global
dysfunction.
4. Moderate (2+) tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
5. Mitral regurgitation is unchanged.
6. Aortic regurgitation is unchanged.
6. The aorta is intact post-decannulation.
[**2189-2-28**] ECHO
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
The right ventricular function is probably preserved. The aortic
root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The anterior
mitral valve leaflet is mildly thickened. A mitral valve
annuloplasty ring is present. An eccentric, anteriorly directed
jet of Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Probably preserved LV function and RV function.
There is mild eccentric MR.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 284**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2189-2-26**] for surgical
management of his aneurysm. He underwent preoperative testing
and was placed on Heparin as he had been off his Coumadin for
five days. On [**2189-2-27**], he was taken to the Operating Room where
he underwent replacement of his ascending aorta and hemiarch
with reimplantation of his saphenous vein grafts. Please see
operative note for details. Due to a coagulopathy, he was left
with an open chest and taken to the intensive care unit.

He received multiple blood products for his coagulopathy. The
renal service was consulted for acute renal failure and possible
need for dialysis. He was aggressively diuresed and his renal
function stabilized. On [**2189-3-2**], he was returned to the
Operating rRoom where he underwent mediastinal washout and
sternal closure. Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive
care unit for monitoring. On [**2189-3-4**] he awoke and was extubated.
He had some confusion but was without any focal deficits. His
renal function continued to improve. He was placed on Amiodarone
for ventricular tachycardia in the OR.  EP followed the patient.
 He developed first degree AV block and beta blocker was held
until it resolved.  He then vascilated between sinus rhythm and
AFib.  Coumadin was resumed for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
.
Vascular surgery was consulted and ruled out compartment
syndrome in the right lower extremity.

Leukocytosis developed to a peak of [**Numeric Identifier 14157**] and he was
pan-cultured. Infectious Disease was consulted.  Cultures were
unrevealing, CDiff toxin was negative on 4 occassions and torso
and leg CT were negative for source. The patient was started
empirically on Flagyl with a fall in the white count.  Other
antibiotics were stopped and the Flagyl changed to oral
Vancomycin per Infectious Disease.  He will be treated with a 14
day course of PO vancomycin in the setting of persistent
leukocytosis and loose stool. Ultrasound of the edematous right
leg revealed only edema, no focal collections.

despite being below his preoperative weight he continued to have
edema and diuretics were continued. Spironolactone was given due
to his underlying heart failure.

On [**3-16**] his WBC had fallen to 13,500, he was afebrile and
