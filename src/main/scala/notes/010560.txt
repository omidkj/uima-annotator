History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 51 year old gentleman who had a kidney transplant
many years ago. He was admitted to an outside hospital with
intra-abdominal sepsis
and was taken to the operating room for a sigmoid resection and
colostomy. One week after that procedure, the patient was
continuing not to do well. We were contact[**Name (NI) **] by his physician to
transfer him to [**Hospital1 18**] for maximal care.

On arrival, he was found to be hypotensive and febrile, with an
hematocrit of 20 and a platelet count of 33. He was medically
maximized during the first initial hour and prepared for the
operating room, to repair what was obviously a fascial
dehiscence and a necrotic stoma and possible intra-abdominal
sepsis. After a long discussion with the brother about the
critical nature of his care, his brother (his health care proxy)
consented to an operation.

After his initial operation, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the

he was taken back to the OR for repair of dehissence of his
abdominal repair. His ostomy was starting to work and he was
started on enteral feedings. He continued to be in sepsis and
repiratory failure and a tracheostomy had to be placed on [**7-21**]
as well as a temporary tunneled dialysis line. He continued to
be ventilator dependent with intermittent hypotensive episode
during which he was started on pressors. He received antibiotic
treatment during most of his stay. On [**7-28**], he was taken back to
the operating room for revision of his vicryl mesh repair.
Postoperatively, he continued to be in a critical condition
without major improvement despite maximal ICU care. he never
regained full conciousness. After several weeks, his family
decided that that Mr. [**Known lastname **] would not have wanted to remain in
