History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 73 yo woman who is transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital for
further evaluation and treatment of her newly diagnosed aplastic
anemia.  Pt reported that she presented to OSH two weeks ago
Tuesday with 7 episodes of loose stool mixed with sig. amounts
of bright red blood.  At the time her plt ct was reportedly
5,000 and HBG was 10; she received 1 unit of plts with increase
to 60,000 and 2 units of PRBCs.  Heme/onc was consulted, and she
had a bone marrow aspirate with flow cytometry that showed
aplastic anemia with 5-10% celularity, no sig. blast population,
cytogenics pending.  Viral serologies were obtained for
hepatitis A, B, C, EBV, CMV, and parovirus and was only sig. for
parvovirus IgG antigen of 19 c/w prior infection.  No colonscopy
was performed as she had one 2 years ago without sig. findings.
Pt was discharged on the following Friday.
.
On Monday, she went for routine lab work that was sig. for plt
ct of 11; she was transfused, which increased the plt ct to 51.
The following Thursday, she went for another routine lab work,
and ANC was noted to be 324.  She was told to monitor her
temperature at home.  She noted a temperature of 101.5 on
Friday.  At home, pt did not note any URI sxs inc. cough and
SOB, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and dysuria.  Pt was told to go
to the Emergency Department.  In the [**Name (NI) **], pt reported that she
was noted to be neutropenic for the first time.  She was started
on Ceftazidime.  CXR was reportedly unremarkable and U/A and UCx
grew 10^5 gram positive growth, which was presumed to be
contamination.  ID was consulted.  She defervesced and was d/c'd
off abx on [**7-17**], her fever returned the next day at 102, and she
was placed back on abx.  Repeat CXR was also unremarkable.  CT
scan of the chest from [**7-5**] did show a pulmonary noudle in the
subpleural R lung.  During the hospital course she also reported
received plt transfusions (plt ct 5,000), empiric trial of G-CSF
300 SQ daily since admission, and T and spectra cell
transfusion.  Course has been c/b nausea, relieved by Zofran.
.
Prior to the admission 2 weeks ago, pt did not believe she was
more fatigued.  Pt's daughter noticed that she fell asleep more
quickly during the day starting about 1 month ago while on
vacation in [**State 108**].  No fever/chills then.  No sig. weight
changes.  She noticed easy brusing 1 week prior to first
admission but no bleeding.  ROS otherwise only sig. for mild
frontal HA, [**2-11**].

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 73 yo woman with PMHx sig. for PMR who is transferred
from [**Hospital **] Hospital for further evaluation and treatment of her
newly diagnosed aplastic anemia.  This was thought to be due to
hemophagocytic syndrome based on bone marrow biopsy results. She
did not respond to cyclosporin and decadron.  The family decided
on [**8-2**] to extubate patient.  She was made comfortable and soon
expired on [**8-2**].
.
1.  Pancytopenia:  Patient had pancytopenia, likely secondary to
hemophagocytic syndrome.  Was treated with decadron and
cyclosporin.  On [**8-1**], she was given one dose of IV
methlyprenisolone and etopiside.  She remained persistently
pancytopenic.  Patient was transfused several units of PRBCs and
platelets.
.
2.  Pulmonary hemorrhage.  Patient was intubated for respiratory
failure secondary to pulmonary hemorrhage in setting of low
platelets.  She was extuabated for one day, but was tachypneic
and alkalotic and so was reintubated.

3.  Febrile Neutropenia.  Patient was treated with caspofungin
and meropenem for febrile neutropenia.  There were no positive
cultures. A source of fever was never found.
.
4.  HTN.  Patient was hypertensive during hospital stay.  She
was treated with amlodipine and metoprolol.
.
5. C diff colitis.  Patient was treated with continue Vanco and
Flagyl for C. diff colitis
