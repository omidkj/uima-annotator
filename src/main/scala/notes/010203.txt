Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 14323**] is a 50M with h/o OSA, COPD and chronic pain on
narcotics, who was admitted with hypercarbic respiratory
failure.

#. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Etiology of respiratory
failure is likely multifactorial - obesity hypoventilation,
pulmonary HTN from OSA, COPD exacerbation, pulmonary edema, in
the setting of taking increased sedating medications ([**4-24**] extra
Xanax pills on the day of admission). Patient was originally
admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure requiring BiPAP in
the ED. On arrival to the MICU, the patient was drowsy but
arousable, falling asleep between sentences. Pt continued on
bipap. and was also given lasix 10mg IV x2 for suggestion of
mild volume overload on examination and chest xray and had 1L of
urine output. The patient was treated for COPD exacerbation
giver decreased air movement and some wheezing on examination
with pulse dose steroids, Azithromycin, nebulizer treatments,
and continued home BiPAP at night. Patient's respirtory status
improved significantly over the first hopsital day and patient
was transferred to the floor. On the floor, treatment was
continued and patient's respiratory status improved with satting
at 98-100% on room air at time of discharge. Patient will
continue azithromycin and steroid course for a total of five
days, with PRN inhaler treatment and continuation of CPAP
overnight for OSA.

# Auditory hallucinations: Pt has hx of schizophrenia vs.
depression w/psychosis. He endorses auditory hallucinations for
about 4 years now that have been worsening. His therapist is Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital 8391**] Community Health Center. On admission,
patient admitted to taking [**4-24**] extra Xanax tablets last night
because his auditory hallucinations (which are called "[**Doctor First Name **]")
were "getting to him". Psych evaluated the patient and
recommended Xanax taper, decreasing Seroquel, and starting
Risperidone. Patient was sectioned given concern that his
hallucinations caused him to overdose on xanax resulting in
respirtory distress. Once medically cleared patient was
discharged to psychiatry for inpatient psychiatry evaluation.

# Chronic pain: He has severe, debilitating chronic pain.
Continued home Morphine and Oxycodone PO regimen.

# Diabetes: Continued home novolog 70/30, but held home
metformin and oral hypoglycemics while an inpatient. Given
stable creatinine, these were restarted on discharge. His blood
sugars were notably higher into 300s morning of discharge given
recent corticosteroids.

# Hypertension: BP well controlled on home metoprolol,
lisinopril, and losartan/hctz.

Transitional care:
1. pending studies: blood cultures
2. Code: full
3. medical management:
started prednisone, azithromycin to complete 5 day course
decreased xanax dosing, started risperidone, decr
