Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1406**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever and vomiting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2125-3-27**]: Sternal wound exploration, Sternal debridement, with
placement of VAC dressing
[**2125-3-26**]: Left chest tube insertion

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 547**] underwent CABGx3/AVR on [**2-20**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Her post
op course was significant for brief atrial fibrillation and was
treated with a course of levaquin for an upper respiratory
infection. She was discharged to rehab on
POD 7.  She was readmitted [**3-2**] with left sided chest pain
w/inspiration radiating to her back. CXR at OSH showed mod to
large left effusion-per report. She was diuresed but not
responding well initially.  Echocardiogram was performed and
showed the heart to be under filled. Albumin and blood were
given with good response in urine output and hemodynamics. An
ultrasound was done to assess left pleural effusion which
revealed minimal fluid.  She was started on Keflex initially for
sternal wound erythema which resolved.  However, Keflex was
continued for the saphenous vein site which was warm and
erythematous and she completed a 7 day course. She continued on
Coumadin with a therapeutic INR for post operative atrial
fibrillation.  She was transferred to rehab [**2125-3-5**].  She is
readmitted today with fever, vomiting, + staph from blood and
sputum cultures as well as a right lower lobe PNA per OSH
report. Tx'd to [**Hospital1 18**] for further sepsis workup.

Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left
atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
levels are normal. There are simple atheroma in the ascending
aorta. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal
leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. The aortic
valve prosthesis leaflets appear to move normally. The
transaortic gradient is normal for this prosthesis. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

[**2125-3-27**] Lower Extremity Ultrasound
[**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and color Doppler imaging of the common femoral,
superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were performed. Normal
compressibility, flow, waveforms, and augmentation is
demonstrated. No intraluminal thrombus is identified.
IMPRESSION: No lower extremity deep venous thrombosis
bilaterally.
[**2125-3-31**] CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT
Comparison with [**2125-3-29**]. There is interval improvement in
pulmonary vascular congestion. Small pleural effusions are more
apparent. A right subclavian catheter remains in place. A PICC
line has been inserted on the right and terminates in the region
of the cavoatrial junction or right atrium.  IMPRESSION: Line
placement as described. Small pleural effusions may have
increased slightly in size. Interval improvement in pulmonary
vascular congestion.
[**2125-4-2**] Upper Extremity Ultrasound
FINDINGS: Grayscale, color, and Doppler imaging was obtained on
the right jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial, cephalic, and
basilic veins. There is normal flow, compression and
augmentation seen in all the vessels. IMPRESSION: No evidence of
deep vein thrombosis in the right arm.
