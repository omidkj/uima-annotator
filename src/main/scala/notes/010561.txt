Pertinent Results:
labs - see below; notable for LDH 480, WBC 18.7
imaging -
CXR: diffuse, interstitial pattern over L lung field.  diffuse
pattern over R middle lobe
CT head: There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, shift
of normally midline structures, hydrocephalus, major vascular
territorial infarction, or fracture.  The ventricles and sulci
are symmetric.  There is preservation of the normal [**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white
matter differentiation.  The paranasal sinuses are clear and the
orbits are unremarkable.  Regional soft tissues demonstrate no
significant abnormality.
CT C-spine: No acute fracture.  Minimal grade 1 anterolisthesis
of T1 over T2.  Large left upper lobe consolidation concerning
for aspiration or pneumonia.
.
CHEST CT:
1.  Elevation of left hemidiaphragm.  If there is clinical
concern for
diaphragmatic paralysis, fluoroscopic assessment may be helpful.
 No mass is identified in the expected course of the phrenic
nerve.
2.  Centrilobular opacities in right lower lobe, which may be
due to
infectious small airways disease or aspiration.
3.  Trace left pleural effusion.  No evidence of subpulmonic
pleural effusion.
4.  Small low-attenuation lesion in upper pole portion of left
kidney and low attenuation lesion in the thyroid gland left
lobe, both incompletely evaluated on this study.  If warranted
clinically, dedicated ultrasound could be considered to evaluate
these areas.
.
CHEST FLUOROSCOPY:  There is normal motion of the right
hemidiaphragm.  The motion of the left hemidiaphragm is
sluggish.  There is no evidence of
paradoxical motion.
IMPRESSION:  Sluggish left hemidiaphragm but no evidence for
diaphragmatic
paralysis.
.
ECHO [**2198-6-26**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular  hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The
right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Right
ventricular systolic function is borderline normal. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Dilated RV cavity with moderate pulmonary
hypertension (? Chronic). LVEF appears preserved.

SPUTUM GRAM STAIN (Final [**2198-6-23**]):
      [**11-21**] PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
      2+   (1-5 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE ROD(S).
      1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).
      1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE COCCI.

   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2198-6-25**]):
      MODERATE GROWTH OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.
      ACINETOBACTER BAUMANNII.    MODERATE GROWTH.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Hypoxic Resp. Failure - Differential included PNA (CAP vs.
nosocomial vs. PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. aspiration), likely concurrent with or
exacerbating a COPD flare.  Less likely possibilities included
PE and CHF.  A CXR in the ED showed diffuse L lung opacity.
Patient was started on Ceftriaxone, Flagyl, Vancomycin, Bactrim,
and prednisone.  Blood and sputum was sent for culture and
patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.  In
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], patient was underwent a bronchoscopy which showed: no
inflammation, minimal secretions, and a partially obstructing
lesion, likely a foreign body, which looked exactly like a piece
of [**Last Name (LF) 59138**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] report.  Of note, patient was admitted to
[**Hospital 8**] hospital ~ 3 months prior to this admission after
aspirating [**Hospital 59138**].  Urine was sent to check for legionella
antigen and was negative.  Sputum was sent to assess for PCP and
was negative. Patient was ruled out for ACS with negative
cardiac enzymes x 3.  An arterial line was placed.  A BAL was
performed and the initial read showed gram-positive cocci and
gram-negative rods.  Patient was maintained on theophylline,
albuterol/atrovent INH, fluticasone, montelukast, and
prednisone.  Sputum culture returned positive for acinitobacter
baumanni which was sensitive to bactrim and imipenum.  A repeat
bronchoscopy was performed on [**6-26**] which showed continuing
obstruction. A central line was attempted, with resulting R
pneumothorax.  CT surgery was consulted and a chest tube was
placed with good resolution of pneumothorax.  A femoral line was
placed, then removed once patient had a L PICC line placed.  The
bronchopscopy was repeated on [**6-27**] with [**Month/Day (4) 59138**] removed.  A
repeat bronchoscopy performed on [**6-28**] - no findings were
documented.  Patient was extubated on [**6-29**] without difficulty.
The chest tube was also removed on [**6-29**].  Shortly after
extubation, the patient became somewhat agitated, crying out and
moving around restlessly in bed.  She was treated with haldol
and zyprexa with good effect and her agitation had ent
