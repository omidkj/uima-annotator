History of Present Illness:
HPI: 82 yo female with pmhx significant for dementia and
cervical cancer who initially presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2163-7-20**] with
nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. The patient had earlier been
admitted to [**Hospital3 20284**] Center on [**2163-6-26**] with acute renal
failure, failure to thrive, persistent leukocytosis. Renal US at
OSH showed moderate hydronephrosis on right, severe on left with
loss of cortical tissue. There she had bilateral ureteral stents
placed on [**2163-7-1**] for proximal mid-ureter tortuous kinking and
proximal hydronephrosis bilaterally. The patient was discharged
home [**7-5**] but returned for failure to thrive. She was admitted
to medicine and underwent a CT scan which showed a soft tissue
mass in periaortic area causing a gastric outlet obstruction,
along with a large fluid collection displacing the right kidney,
thought to be a urinoma. An NG tube was placed, with return of
fecal material. The patient subsequently developed hypotension
and was transferred to the ICU.
.
In the MICU, the patient was started on pressors for hypotension
and intubated. IR evaluated the patient and was able to drain
the urinoma. Fluid from the collection grew enterococcus and
CNS. She was extubated yesterday in the MICU.
Today, pt. reports feeling well. She is anxious to go home and
especially to start eating again. She denies abdominal pain,
chest pain, SOB, or nausea. She has not recently vomited

Reason: eval for pna

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
82 year old woman with fever and leukocytosis
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for pna
PA AND LATERAL CHEST, [**2163-7-20**] AT 1812 HOURS

HISTORY: Fever and leukocytosis.

COMPARISON: None.

FINDINGS: The pigtail catheter overlies the right renal fossa.
The lungs are clear. The mediastinum is unremarkable. The
cardiac silhouette is within normal limits for size. No pleural
effusion or pneumothorax is evident. The right hemidiaphragm is
elevated. No effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The osseous
structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process.

RENAL U.S.

Reason: r/o hydronephrosis

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
82 year old woman with h/o persistent UTI, recent admission at
OSH for ARF where she had bilateral ureteral stents for
hydronephrosis, admitted here with FTT, renal insufficiency and
UTI.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o hydronephrosis
INDICATION: History of persistent UTI, recent admissions at
outside hospital for acute renal failure with bilateral ureteral
stent placement for hydronephrosis. Now here with failure to
thrive, renal insufficiency and urinary tract infection.
Evaluate for hydronephrosis.

TECHNIQUE: GU ultrasound without comparisons.

FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 13.5 cm, distended with
severe hydronephrosis. The proximal aspect of a right ureteral
stent is seen within the right collecting system. There are no
stones seen on the right.

The left kidney measures 8.8 cm, with moderate hydronephrosis.
Again, the proximal aspect of a left-sided ureteral stent is
seen within the renal collecting system.

Evaluation of the bladder demonstrates echogenic catheter seen
within the bladder. While it is difficult to trace catheter
material to each of the two ureteral orifices, the orientation
of the catheters suggest that both right and left ureteral
catheters extend into the bladder.

IMPRESSION:

Bilateral hydronephrosis, right worse than left, with bilateral
nephroureteral catheters.

UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS LEFT

Reason: R/O DVT, SWELLING

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
82 year old woman with ARF, dementia, UTI, h/o DVT 30 years ago
admitted with FTT.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o DVT
STUDY: Unilateral lower extremity ultrasound on the left.

INDICATION: 82-year-old female with history of DVT 30 years ago.
Assess for DVT.

COMPARISONS: None.

FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the left common
femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal veins are performed.
There is normal compressibility, flow, and augmentation. No
intraluminal thrombus is identified.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT of the left lower extremity.

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST

Reason: r/o ureteral obstruction. Patient CANNOT receive iv
contrast

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
82 year old woman with hydronephrosis, failure to thrive,
dementia here with acute renal insufficienty, severe right
hydronephrosis and UTI
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o ureteral obstruction. Patient CANNOT receive iv contrast due
to Creatinine Clearance of 15
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: Renal failure, CrCl 15

EXAMINATION: CT abdomen and pelvis.

INDICATION: Hydronephrosis and dementia.

COMPARISON: No old studies available for comparison.

TECHNIQUE: A CT of abdomen and pelvis was performed with axia
