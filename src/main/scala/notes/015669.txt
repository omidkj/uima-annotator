Chief Complaint:
Bilateral claudication with minimal activity, mottled left 1st
toe.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Aortobifemoral repair ([**2137-3-11**])

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 62-year-old female
who presented with symptoms of ischemia in her left lower
extremity. On Doppler exam she had only a weak monophasic PT.
She did not have palpable femoral pulses in either groin.

An arteriogram revealed a cutoff of the left iliac artery, as
well as diseased right iliac artery with reconstitution of
the left superficial femoral artery. She presents for an
aorto-bifemoral bypass.


Past Medical History:
Morbid obesity
HTN
COPD
GERD
PAOD
back pain
carotid stenosis s/p right CEA ([**3-/2136**])


Social History:
Lives alone; 40-pack-year tobacco history; consumes 1 alcoholic
beverage per month. Denies illicit drug use.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on the day of surgery. She underwent
aorto-bifemoral artery bypass with dacron graft on [**2137-3-11**].
Please refer to the operative note of [**2137-3-11**] for further
details about the procedure.

After surgery, the patient was brought to the Trauma/Surgical
ICU for post-operative care. She remained intubated and sedated
in the immediate post-operative period, as she failed to wean
from the mechanical ventilator. Also notable was that she was
requiring quite high PEEP. She was transiently hypotensive and
oliguric, responding well to intravenous fluid boluses. On
post-operative day (POD) #1, the patient's platelets dropped
precipitously to 90 from an immediate post-operative value of
159. All heparin products were discontinued, and a
heparin-induced antibody test eventually proved negative. On
POD#3, empiric vancomycin and levofloxacin were started after
the patient remained on mechanical ventilation, and was
productive of copious amounts of sputum. Sputum cultures
eventually grew S. pneumoniae and pan-sensitive Enterobacter and
Klebsiella spp.

By POD#4, she was 31 liters positive over her pre-operative
fluid status. Aggressive diuresis was begun.

On POD#5, the patient was transfused one unit of packed red
blood cells for a hematocrit of 23.6. Throughout her hospital
course, the patient's hematocrit remained stable but low without
evidence of hemolytic process. She continued to receive
transfusions of packed red blood cells throughout her stay when
her hematocrit dropped below 24.0.

On POD#7, the patient began receiving total parenteral
nutrition. She tolerated hyperalimentation well.

By POD#10, the patient had been relieved of the great majority
of excess total body water, she had been on antibiotics for over
1 week, and she had received excellent aggressive pulmonary
toilet, but she was still failing to wean from the mechanical
ventilator. Plans were made for placement of a tracheostomy
tube. This operation was performed on [**2137-3-23**] without incident.

In the second post-operative week, the patient had nearly daily
low-grade fevers. A sputum culture taken on [**3-21**] revealed
methicillin-resistant S. aureus; and P. aeruginosa, S.
marsescens and K. pneumoniae, all sensitive to ceftazidime. She
was administered vancomycin and ceftazidime for what the
Infectious Diseases consult service recommended should be a
2-week course.

A Dobhoff post-pyloric feeding tube was placed on [**3-25**] (POD#14)
and tube feeds were started after all sedation was weaned. The
patient was increased slowly on tube feeds until her goal
nutrition requirements were reached (Respalor at 50ml/hour.).
Thereafter, TPN was discontinued. Her nasogastric tube was also
discontinued after the patient passed a 24-hour period without
gastric residuals.

On POD#17, the patient was weaned to tracheostomy mask, which
she tolerated for approximately 20 hours before becoming
tachypneic. Thereafter, she was reattached to a CPAP mechanical
ventilation setting. Later in the evening, the patient pulled
out her tracheostomy tube, which was replaced with the aid of
bronchoscopy.

On POD#18, the patient's wound staples were take out, and on
POD#21, a PICC line was placed for long-term intravenous access.


By POD#23, the patient had tolerated trach mask for 2 days. She
did well with a Passey-Miur valve. Plans were made to discharge
her to a vented rehabilitation facility for her extended
postoperative care.

At the time of discharge, the patient is alert and aware, is
pain-free, and is on her way to breathing independently of
mechanical assistance. She is receiving goal tube feeds through
a post-pyloric Dobhoff tube. She appears to be at about her
pre-surgery weight. Her lower extremity pulses are palpable at
femoral, popliteal, dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial sites
bilaterally, and she has warm, well-perfused feet bilaterally.
She has received the services of Physical Therapy and is ready
for more intensive rehabilitiation. While at rehab., she is to
complete her antibiotics courses as specified in her 'Page 1.'
She is in good condition. She is to follow up in clinic with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] in 2 weeks for her continued care.
