Chief Complaint:
CHEST PAIN AND SHORTNESS-OF-BREATH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
-Operative treatment of left intertrochanteric hip fracture with
trochanteric femoral nail
- PICC line placement


History of Present Illness:
64F with uncontrolled DM, HTN, HLD who presents to the ED with
chief complaint of chest pain and difficulty breathing.  Patient
said that she was in her usual state of health until this
morning.  She was lying on the couch with her granddaughter for
about 1.5 hours dozing in and out of sleep when she suddenly
woke up by a sense of diffuse chills and shaking.  She became
very short of breath and then began to have sharp midline chest
pain over her sternum that radiated over her right breast.  She
also had associated nausea without vomiting.  She became very
concerned and had her daughter call EMD.  According to EMS she
reported a few days of chest pain and back pain. She was found
to have a temp of 101.2 and was hypertensive. EMS reported
bilateral rales as well.  She was brought to the ED for further
evaluation.
.
The patient denies recent fevers, chills, night sweats, URI
symptoms, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, urinary frequency,
dysuria, joints, muscle pains, anxiety or depression.

She does say that she has long history of weeping fluid from her
RLE.  Over the last two weeks, she feels that her RLE has become
slowly increasingly eryhematous, painful to touch and warm.
This has not occurred on the left.  She also feels that it is
weeping more than usual.  She has a long history of being unable
to make it to see her PCP at [**Name9 (PRE) **]clinic and has not
been there since [**2165**].

In the ED, initial VS were: 101.2 120 141/110 30 97% 15L
Non-Rebreather.  Physical exam in the ED (according to signout)
- anxious appearing, tachypnic, tachycardic but RR normal S1S2,
lungs difficult to assess but no obvious wheezing or rales,
bilateral lower extremity edema with weeping on R. Labs
significant for a WBC of 11.2 (N:90.4 L:5.7), lactate of 3.1,
BNP 118, trop <0.01, CXR showed mild right basilar atelectasis
and concern for pleural effusions, given Lasix 20mgx1, Morphine
5mg x1, Vanc/Ceftriaxone/Azithromycin. IVF running slowly for
tachycardia.

CHEST X-RAY ([**2167-5-22**]): A small hazy opacification at the right
base most consistent with atelectasis. No other consolidations
are present. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There
is no pulmonary edema. Mild-to-moderate enlargement of the
cardiac silhouette is unchanged from the prior exams.
IMPRESSION:
1. Mild right basilar atelectasis.
2. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
.
CTA CHEST ([**2167-5-22**]): No nodules are seen in the unenhanced
thyroid gland. The thoracic aorta is normal in caliber without
evidence of intramural hematoma or dissection. Pulmonary
arterial vasculature is visualized to the subsegmental level
without filling defect to suggest pulmonary embolism. There is
no axillary or hilar lymphadenopathy. A top normal size
precarinal lymph node measures 1.0 cm in short axis, previously
1.2 cm on [**2166-4-25**] (3:18). The heart is enlarged with moderate
coronary artery calcifications. The pericardium and three-vessel
takeoff are within normal limits aside. There is no pericardial
effusion. A trace right pleural effusion is seen. No left
effusion. Evaluation of the lung fields is limited by motion
artifact, particularly at the lung bases. There is right basilar
atelectasis adjacent to the effusion. Mild left basilar
dependent atelectasis. There is no worrisome nodule, mass or
consolidation. Airways are patent to the subsegmental levels
bilaterally.
This study is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation. The
visualized portions of the liver, spleen, and kidneys are
unremarkable. Again seen is a right adrenal lesion measuring 2.9
x 3.2 cm, previously 2.7 x 2.9 cm, with attenuation of 5 [**Doctor Last Name **],
compatible with an adenoma.Soft tissue in the left hypochondrium
represents the patients known spelnorenal shunt.
BONE WINDOWS: No bone finding suspicious for infection or
malignancy is seen. Compression deformities in the mid thoracic
spine are unchanged from [**2166-4-25**].
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute aortic pathology or pulmonary embolism.
2. Left adrenal adenoma is slightly increased in size from
[**2166-
