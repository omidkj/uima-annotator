Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented to the hospital on the day of surgery. She
underwent the procedure without complication. For details of the
surgery, please refer to the operative note of [**2137-11-28**]. Her
post-operative course, however, was marked by low urine output,
the nadir of which was 12ml/1 hour. Her urine output improved
steadily and on POD#1, she was diuresing well.

The patient also complained of dyspnea and weakness. Cardiac
work-up was initiated and was found to be negative. Her dyspnea
responded somewhat to albuterol-ipratropium nebulizer treatments
and salmeterol-fluticasone, but at post-operative day #1, she
was still oxygen-dependent. Inhalant therapies were continued
and aggressive pulmonary toilet was instituted.

The patient's weakness was characterized by an unsteadiness on
her feet. She was admitted and a physical therapy consultation
was requested for evaluation and treatment. She was also noted
to desaturate to 85-88% while attempting to walk.

Also noted was a 2x2cm hematoma on the patient's R posterior arm
at which site subcutaneous heparin had been administered. She
made the transition easily to a clear liquid diet and was
advanced to a regular diet without bread products. She also was
given all of her home medications, and required very little oral
pain medication for pain control.

On POD#2, she was somewhat improved in her respiratory status.
She was weaned to 2 liters of oxygen therapy. She continued to
work with physical therapy for steadiness and strengthening.

On POD#3, the patient was saturating well on room air and
ambulating with ease and without respiratory compromise, and the
hematoma on her R arm was resolving nicely. Both she and the
surgery service taking care of her felt that she was well enough
to go home. The patient's daughter offered to take close care of
the patient for the first 2 weeks after discharge. She was
discharged in stable condition with instructions for follow-up
care in Dr.[**Name (NI) 1482**] clinic.
