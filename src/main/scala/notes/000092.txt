atrial fibrillation in the 170s.  He was given a Diltiazem
bolus and started on a Diltiazem drip.

rate 40, 98% saturation on nonrebreather.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Pupils equal, round and
reactive to light.  Edentulous.  Oropharynx dry.

ADMISSION LABS AND IMAGING:  Notable for a white count of
13.1 with 77% segs, hematocrit of 41.5.  Chemistries
unremarkable.  C was 79, troponin less than 0.3.  Urinalysis
was negative.  Arterial blood gases was 7.38, 46, 76 on 2
liters of oxygen and repeat was 7.38, 47, 50 on 1.5 liters of
oxygen.  Chest x-ray showed emphysema, pleural plaques,
diffuse perihilar and right apical opacities which were
consistent with an acute pneumonia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted and taken to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit.  In the Medical Intensive Care
Unit, he was not intubated.  He received antibiotics,
levofloxacin for the pneumonia.  He received steroids which
were tapered, chest physical therapy and nebulizers with some
improvement.  His heart rate was controlled with Lopressor
and Diltiazem which were able to be switched to po and
cardiology felt he should be treated for his pulmonary
process before aggressive treatment for the atrial
fibrillation was started.  The patient and family decided on
comfort measures and he was transferred to the floor.  On the
floor, he remained stable with occasional runs of
tachycardia, seemed to be related to albuterol nebulizers.
He was able to tolerate nasal cannula oxygen and on [**2192-4-16**],
his rate had gotten up to 172 but it decreased to the 120s
after receiving 50 mg of intravenous Diltiazem.  Repeat
electrocardiogram showed that he was in atrial flutter and he
was continued on po Lopressor and Diltiazem.  His Lopressor
dose was increased to 75 mg po bid.  Palliative care consult
was called and they suggested switching him to sublingual
morphine sulfate elixir, as well as adding Ativan prn and
