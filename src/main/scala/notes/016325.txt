[**2115-5-17**] CXR:Compared to the prior study, there is increase in
pulmonary edema in both lungs with increased bibasilar opacities
that most likely represent the lung volume overload rather than
interval development of infectious process or aspiration. The
pleural effusion has increased, but left more than right, which
is slightly unusual and that is why it should be closely
followed. Some of the lung opacities have nodular appearance but
given its rapid development are most likely representing
pulmonary edema than an infectious etiology. The evaluation of
the patient after diuresis is highly recommended to exclude the
remote possibility of underlying infection. The patient is after
left upper abdomen surgery.

[**2115-5-18**] CXR:
REASON FOR EXAM: Assess CHF after diuresis.

Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.

There is mild improvement in moderate pulmonary edema, although
right upper
lobe has increasing opacity. Atelectasis in the left base,
improved. Small
bilateral effusions, increased on the right. Cardiomegaly is
unchanged.

[**2115-5-17**] Renal U/S:
FINDINGS: Right kidney measures 11.4 cm. No evidence of right
hydronephrosis. Right main renal artery and main renal vein are
patent.
Doppler evaluation is markedly limited due to continuous
respiratory motion throughout the examination. Patient is status
post left nephrectomy. The left renal fossa is unremarkable.
Bladder is not visualized due to overlying bowel gas.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis. Right main renal
artery and
vein are patent. Doppler evaluation of the right kidney is
markedly limited due to continuous respiratory motion.


Brief Hospital Course:
75 yo female admitted with SOB, URI symptoms and dietary
indiscretion over the [**Holiday **] holiday now with acute worsening of
hypoxia [**3-4**] acute CHF.

# SOB: Cardiac biomakers were flat so unlikely secondary to acs.
SOB though to represent both pneumonia and acute on chronic CHF
exacerbation in the setting of dietary indiscretion over the
[**Holiday **] weekend. Patient was initially started on Azithromycin
and Ceftriazone for antimicrobial coverage. Patient was given IV
lasix on the medicine floor but only diuresed about 1 L.
Overnight on HD#2 she became progressively more hypoxic despite
diuresis. ABG revealed alkalosis and severe hypoxia. CXR was
consistent with worsening pulmonary edema and worsening
pneumonia. EKG was unchanged. Patient was transferred to the
CCU. In the CCU patient was diuresed with IV lasix after which
she was less SOB and O2 requirement trended down. She remained
AF and had no leukocytosis so antibiotics were stopped as it was
felt her SOB was likely [**3-4**] diastolic CHF exacerbation. She was
placed on lasix 120 mg PO three times daily and her fluid
balance was negative more than 2 liters in one day so the dose
was dropped to twice daily. Her O2 requirement steadily trended
down and she required no O2 prior to discharge.

# Hypertension: Patient had labile BPs while in the CCU which
may have contributed to her acute pulmonary edema and CHF
exacerbation. Her nifedipine CR was increased and she was
started on cardura at night with better BP control but still not
ideal with pressures around 160s. Her medication regimen will be
further titrated by her outpatient physicians.

# Renal artery stenosis status post stenting x2:  Continued asa
and plavix. Renal U/S was non-diagnostic however her creatinine
trended down to baseline (1.8) while she was hospitalized so it
was felt unlikely that the stent was stenosed.

# Diabetes: diabetic diet and home regiment insulin were started
initially however the patient had elevated FSBS (400s) and
[**Last Name (un) **] was consulted for better diabetic regimen. The patient
was discharge on 18units of lantus as well as a sliding scale
and will follow up as an outpatient for further diabetic
management.

# CKD: Cr baseline 1.7 to 2.1. Patient remained at baseline.
REnal u/s was non-diagnostic as above.

CODE STATUS: Full cofirmed with patient
