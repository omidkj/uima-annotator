Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Fentanyl

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2597**]
Chief Complaint:
increasing rest pain in L AKA


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Excision of L graft, oversewing of CFA/graft stump [**2178-4-25**]
Ax-Profunda BPG [**2178-5-6**]


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 84F discharged from Dr.[**Name (NI) 5695**] service
yesterday.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2178-4-24**] from
[**Hospital3 8834**] with a pseudoaneurysm of the L
femoral
artery.  On [**2178-4-25**] she underwent an exploration of left groin
and drainage of infected false aneurysm; excision of left limb
of
aortobifemoral graft and suture repair of common femoral
artery with debridement of the wound and primary closure.  She
subsequently developed mottling of her L stump though her rest
pain was tolerable.  Today at rehab the L stump was noted to be
more mottled and cool with increasing rest pain.  She was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for the above complaints.


Past Medical History:
1. severe atherosclerotic disease/PVD
2. HTN
3. Myocardial infarction [**12-9**]
4. Infected PTFE graft left leg
5. aorto-bifem bpg '[**72**]
6. multiple R fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] operations culminating in R AKA
7. multiple L fem-[**Doctor Last Name **], fem-tibial operations culminating in L
AKA
8. repair of L femoral pseudoaneurysm [**2178-2-23**] by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
([**Hospital1 **]) with bovine patch and sartorius flap (with
assistance of balloon occlusion of inflow during procedure).
9. exploration of left groin and drainage of infected false
aneurysm; excision of left limb of aortobifemoral graft and
suture repair of common femoral artery with debridement of the
wound and primary closure. [**2178-4-25**]

Pertinent Results:
[**5-12**] KUB: FINDINGS: The nasogastric tube has been removed. Again
seen are mildly distended loops of large and small bowel. The
patient is post-laparotomy with surgical staples in place left
of midline as well as over the left inguinal region.

IMPRESSION: Unchanged appearance of mildly dilated loops of
small and large bowel, consistent with ileus.

[**5-5**] Echo:
1.No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.

2.Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).

3.Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.

4.There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.

5. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta.

6.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present.

7.Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.

8.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.

[**5-4**] CT: CT ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:

There is extensive emphysema present at the lung bases. There is
no pericardial or pleural effusion.

There is an NG tube with the tip in the stomach. There is
extensive dilatation of the small bowel, which is fluid filled.
The large bowel is not distended. There is intrahepatic biliary
dilatation, this is more prominent when compared to the prior
examination. The common bile duct measures 8 mm. There is stable
appearance to a left renal cyst. The spleen is not visualized
which likely represents prior splenectomy. The adrenal glands
appear unremarkable. There is stable atrophy of the lower pole
of the right kidney. There is no upper abdominal
lymphadenopathy.

CT PELVIS PRE- AND POST-ADMINISTRATION OF INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:

The small bowel is dilated and fluid-filled. There is no
intraperitoneal free air or free fluid. The large bowel is not
dilated. There is a fat- containing right inguinal hernia. There
is a 41 x 40 mm fluid collection in the left inguinal region
which may represent sequelae of recent endovascular surgery.

CT ANGIOGRAM:

There is extensive atheromatous change in the aorta and the
coronary arteries. There is atherosclerosis present at the
origin of a single patent right renal artery. There is a single
patent left renal artery. The celiac artery comes of at an acute
angle from the abdominal aorta though this is patent. The
superior mesenteric artery is patent in its visualized course.

The aortobifemoral graft is seen in situ with only the right
limb of the graft displaying contrast. The left limb of the
aortobifemoral graft is completely occluded at its origin and
there is no contrast opacification of the native or the left
iliac bypass graft. There is no contrast opacification seen in
the left common femoral or the superficial femoral arteries.

The right limb of the aortofemoral graft is patent. The right
superficial femoral artery is occluded and there are two
occluded grafts in the right proximal to mid thigh. The right
and left profunda femoris arteies are diminutive in caliber
though these are patent.

MUSCULOSKELETAL:

There have been above knee bilateral amputations of the lower
extremities. There are multilevel degenerative changes present
in the spine with wedge compression and significant loss of
height of L1 vertebra. Superior endplate compression is also
seen at L3 and L4 levels.

CONCLUSION:

1. Dilated fluid-filled loops of small bowel, without any
definite transition point could represent ileus versus early
bowel ischemia. Mechanical obstruction is thought less likley

2. Prominence of the intrahepatic bile ducts with a common bile
duct measuring 8 mm and prior cholecystectomy.

3. Completely occluded left limb of the aortofemoral graft along
with occlusion of the left external iliac, common femoral and
superficial femoral arteries. There is also complete occlusion
of the right superficial femoral artery as described above.

[**5-4**] KUB: ABDOMEN, SINGLE VIEW: An NG tube and side hole are seen
to project below the diaphragm. Distended loops of small and
large bowel are again seen. There is contrast in the right
pelvicaliceal system and on the left, contrast is seen in the
right ureter. Status post CTA from earlier today. No gross
osseous abnormality. Surgical staples are seen to the left of
midline in the pelvis.

IMPRESSION: NG tube and sidehole projecting below the diaphragm,
with re-demonstration of ileus.

[**5-3**] KUB: FINDINGS: There is dilatation of the small bowel
measuring up to 5.8 cm. Multiple air-fluid levels are also
identified. Air is seen within the colon. There is no evidence
of free air.

IMPRESSION: Dilated loops of small bowel up to 5.8 cm likely
consistent with ileus.
