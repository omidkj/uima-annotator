Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11892**]
Chief Complaint:
fever, altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
History obtained from MICU team; patient appears to be
unreliable historian.

Pt is a 69M with dementia, s/p cardiac arrest [**2149**] with anoxic
brain injury, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, DM2, and HTN
admitted from [**Hospital3 537**] with fever and altered mental
status.  Per [**Hospital3 537**] staff, "hasn't been himself" since
day prior to admission; testing there demonstrated leukocytosis
(WBC 15.5K) with borderline pyuria (5 WBCs) and received empiric
ciprofloxacin for possible UTI.  On day of admission, noted to
have unstable gait, "leaning to right", unable to get to
bathroom by himself (apparently normally able to ambulate
independently with walker).  Sent to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further
evaluation.

Further history obtained from daughter [**Name (NI) 7346**], who reports
patient was lethargic, "not talking", "wincing" when touched
approximately 48hrs prior to his admission.  Patient was not
reporting any specific symptoms, however has noted to be
recently "choking on his food".  Has a chronic cough (since his
VF arrest in [**2149**]), but recently more productive.  Poor PO
intake prior to admission.  Daughter reports that patient is
currently (evening of [**4-25**]) very close to his baseline mental
status.

In ED, febrile ro 103.8, in afib with RVR 150s-170s, with serum
Na=153.  Treated with IV fluids (2L), vancomycin/ciprofloxacin,
diltiazem, and right IJ CVL placed.  Subsequent transient
hypotension to 80s, resolved spontaneously without pressor
support.  Admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for possible sepsis.

In [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], converted to sinus rhythm with HR 70s.  Antibiotics
continued empirically.  D5W infusion administered in setting of
hypernatremia.  Blood, urine cultures unrevealing.  Chest x-ray
without overt infiltrate.  Head CT without mass or acute bleed.
Abd/pelvis CT unremarkable per preliminary report.  Per MICU
notes, overall mental status much improved according to
patient's daughter, though not yet at baseline.

Past Medical History:
1. DM2
2. Hypertension
3. Hyperlipidemia
4. h/o VFIB arrest in [**12-17**] secondary to cocaine/EtOH use,
complicated by coma, anoxic brain injury, and evidence if IMI,
inferior ischemia with resultant improvement in heart function
5. Paroxysmal AFib: not on anticoagulation due to fall risk
6. Anoxic Brain Injury/Dementia
7. Pulmonary Hypertension
8. BPH with urinary retention
9. GERD


Social History:
[**Hospital3 537**] resident.  Daughter [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 7346**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3924**] is his legal
guardian; she is a registered nurse.  Prior history of
EtOH/cocaine abuse.

Ambulates with cane at baseline.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 10321**] is a 69 yo M with a history of dementia/anoxic brain
injury, DM2, HTN admitted with fever and altered mental status,
noted to be in atrial flutter with RVR. Transferred to [**Hospital1 1516**]
cardiology floor for diltiazem drip as rate not responding to IV
metoprolol and diltiazem. Converted to NSR on dilt gtt so was
switched to po dilt 240 mg SR, and went back into aflutter with
RVR. EP consulted and recommended starting quinidine on [**2153-4-26**].
Patient was successfully converted to NSR on quinidine.  His
hospital course is outlined by problem below:
.
#. Atrial Flutter with intermittant RVR: Hemodynamically stable.
Patient had been in AFib with RVR when initially admitted to the
ICU, but spontaneously converted to NSR during his stay. After
being called out, the patient has had sustained ventricular
rates in 130-150s and had not responded to IV metoprolol and
diltiazem. The patient was transferred for IV diltiazem gtt. Per
medical record, no anticoagulation in setting of baseline fall
risk. He was started on a heparin gtt and dilt gtt on [**2153-4-25**].
Converted to NSR on dilt gtt so was switched to po dilt 240 mg
SR, and went back into aflutter with RVR. EP consulted and
recommended starting quinidine on [**2153-4-26**]. Patient was
successfully converted to NSR on quinidine. Continue quinidine
at 324 mg q8H as outpatient with close monitoring of QTc with
daily EKGs. Baseline QTc [**2153-4-23**] was 466. Monitor for QT
prolongation of increase in QTc 25% above baseline. His QTc at
time of discharge was ~480. Continue to replete K<4.0 and
Mg<2.0; he will be discharged on 400mg magnesium oxide [**Hospital1 **].
Continue daily aspirin per baseline regimen. PT consult to
evaluate fall risk; pt is significant fall risk. Because of
this, he will not be anticoagulated with coumadin as outpatient
at time of discharge.
.
#. Fever/leukocytosis: Resolved. Afebrile, pt has clinically
improved since admission. Potential sources urinary, pulm have
been ruled out. Only symptom appears to be mildly productive
cough. Patient had been on antibiotics (Vanc/Levo) while in the
ICU, but these were discontinued in the absence of identified
bacterial process and clinical improvement. NGTD on urine or
blood cultures suggestive of infection.
Since transfer to [**Hospital1 1516**] cardiology on [**2153-4-25**] patient was
afebrile and had resolution of leukocytosis with normal WBC at
time of discharge.
.
#. Anemia: Stable HCT of 38.4. Asymptomatic.
.
#. AMS: Improved. Suspect that patient had waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**]
delirium in setting of fever, hypernatremia, and hypovolemia
when he was admitted. Patient has had CT head that did not show
new infarct or bleed. Continued baseline fluoxetine, donepezil,
risperidone, and prn Haldol. Haldol was discontinued without
issues regarding agitation on morning of [**2153-4-28**], given increase
in QTc.
.
#. Hypernatremia: Na 148 on admission, resolved with normal
serum sodium of 141 with po free water repletion.
.
#. HTN: Held beta blocker and ACEI while on dilt gtt. Restarted
lisinopril [**4-26**].
.
#. ARF, pre-renal: Improved s/p fluid resusitation. Cr 1.1, at
baseline.
.
#. Mild Rhabdo, elevated CPK: CK 815. Unclear etiology. Suspect
related to acute illness. Held statin initially with
improvement. Restarted at time of discharge.
.
# FEN: Patient had speech and swallow evaluation on [**2153-4-25**]. No
evidence of aspiration. Okay to continue on regular diet with
distant supervision per their recommedations.
.
# Continue DVT prophylaxis with Hepar
