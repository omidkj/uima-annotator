Service:  VASCULAR
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Left leg pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 48 year-old male well
known to our service with a history of hypertension,
gastroesophageal reflux disease, severe peripheral vascular
foot pain times duration of four days.  The patient
reportedly noticed this a.m. his pain has gotten much worse
then previously and his left leg and foot has gotten cold.
He also noted that he had no longer can feel his left femoral
pulse, which is a change.  The patient was originally
scheduled for surgery electively next Tuesday with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1391**], but now is admitted urgently for ischemic
Room.  He was begun on intravenous heparin.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux
disease, peripheral vascular disease.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Aortobifemoral in [**2174**], left femoral
AK [**Doctor Last Name **] in [**2174**], left fem AK [**Doctor Last Name **] with Dacron in [**2176**], right
femoral popliteal with PTFE and a right femoral popliteal
with arm vein in [**2175**].  Revision of the aortobifemoral and
left femoral AK [**Doctor Last Name **].  In [**Month (only) 404**] of this year left common
femoral artery to profunda with Dacron bypass in [**2178-3-2**].

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Lopresor 12.5 mg b.i.d., Prilosec
20 mg b.i.d., Procardia XL 30 mg q.d., Zestril 10 mg q.d.,
Coumadin 7.5 mg q.d., Amitriptyline 25 mg at h.s.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a fifty pack year history of
smoking.  He was previously a three pack per day and he has
now decreased his smoking to one pack per day.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs 99.4.  Pulse 114.  Blood
pressure 145/67.  Respiratory rate 18.  O2 sat 96% on room
air.  General appearance, the patient is in mild distress
secondary to pain.  HEENT examination is unremarkable except
for bilateral carotid bruits.  Chest is clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Heart is a regular rate and rhythm without
murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdominal examination is
unremarkable.  There is no problems with the abdominal aorta.
Extremity examination left foot is modeled, cold with delayed
capillary refill.  He has absent femoral, popliteal, dorsalis
pedis pulse and posterior tibial pulses on the left.  On the
right he has a palpable femoral popliteal triphasic dorsalis
pedis and posterior tibial signal on the right.

LABORATORY:  Laboratories included a CBC with a white blood
cell count of 12.7, hematocrit 32.9, platelets 302K, BUN 6,
creatinine .8, K 4.5.  PT, INR, PTT were normal.  Vascular
surgery was consulted.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to angiography.
Angiography noted prior aortobifemoral bypass with occluded
left limb of the aortobifemoral.  An attempt was to cross
lesion from the right groin, successful with wire,
unsuccessful with a gldewire and catheter as well as a 6 French
sheath. The
left groin was entered in a retrograde fashion.  The left
femoral was accessed.  The infusion catheter was placed at
the limb of the ABF graft.  Tissue plasminogen activator was
begun at 1 mg per hour.  The following day repeat arteriogram
was done.  The patient's left limb of the aortobifemoral was
patent.  The left common femoral to profunda graft was
occluded.  The left femoral to AK [**Doctor Last Name **] bypass with dacron
was patent with distal stenosis and no run off.  The patient
was taken to surgery and underwent at that time a left
femoral popliteal revision with a femoral popliteal to bypass
jump graft to BK [**Doctor Last Name **] of PTFE and left leg 4 compartment
fasciotomies.
Intravenous heparinization was begun.  The patient was
transferred to the CICU for continued monitoring and care.

Postoperative day one the patient's foot remained good.  He
had a palpable graft pulse.  He required intravenous
nitroglycerin for his hypertension.  Morphine PCA was
converted to oral analgesic agents and his diet was advanced
as tolerated.  On postop day number two the patient was
transferred to the VICU for continued monitoring and care.
Postop day number three the patient had a T max of 101.5.
Vancomycin was begun empirically.  Heparin was continued and
Coumadization was begun.  Cultures were sent.  Blood cultures
were obtained, which finalized as no growth.  Chest x-ray was
also obtained at that time, which demonstrated a mild
congestive heart failure with volume overload.  There was a
more focal opacity within the right middle lobe for which
focal pneumonia could not be excluded.  Venous duplex were
done, which were negative for deep venous thrombosis.
Ambulation was begun and on [**8-31**] he underwent closure of his
fasciotomy sites without complications.  Duplex of the graft
was done, which showed a patent graft without stenosis.
Duplex of the veins were negative for deep venous thrombosis,
but did show a left calf hematoma.  His hematocrit dropped
and he required transfusions for a hematocrit of 26.

He was continued on heparin and Coumadin anticoagulation and
on [**2178-9-4**] he underwent an incision and drainage of the left
graft hematoma without problems.  [**Name (NI) **] required two packed red
blood cells for a hematocrit of 28.2.  The patient was
followed by physical therapy and they felt he would be safe
to be discharged to home.  The patient would be discharged to
home in stable condition once INR remained at a steady
therapeutic state of 1.9 or greater.  Heparin would be
discontinued at that time.  Wounds at the time of discharge
were clean, dry and intact.  He had a palpable graft pulse.
At the time of discharge the patient's hematocrit was 30.8
with a white count of 10.3.  His INR on [**2178-9-8**] was 1.7 with
a PTT of 60.6.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Coumadin 10 to 15 mg q.d. maintain an
INR between 2.0 and 3.0.  Gabapentin 400 mg t.i.d.,
Pantoprazole 40 mg b.i.d., amitriptyline 25 mg at h.s.,
Ambien 5 mg at h.s. prn, Nifedipine CR 30 mg q.d., Lisinopril
10 mg q.d., Percocet tablets one to two q 4 to 6 hours prn
for pain, Colace 100 mg b.i.d., Nicotine patch 21 mg q.d.
this should be for a total of twenty one days and this should
be reassessed to determine whether he can go to a lower
dosing.  Bupropion SR 150 mg b.i.d., Metoprolol 100 mg b.i.d.

Care to left calf dry sterile dressing q.d.  The patient
should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in two to three weeks.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Ischemic left leg status post arteriogram and tissue
plasminogen activator.
2.  Status post revision of femoral popliteal with a jump
graft from femoral popliteal graft to BK popliteal with PTFE.
3.  Left leg fasciotomies.  Fasciotomy sites closed [**8-31**].
4.  Blood loss anemia corrected.
5.  Left calf hematoma status post incision and drainage.
