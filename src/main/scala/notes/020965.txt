Chief Complaint:
CHIEF COMPLAINT: R flank pain, N/V, ARF

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central venous catheter
Right Percutaneous Nephrostomy Tube Placement

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 12021**] is a 69 y.o. M with hypertension, prostate cancer
s/p XRT 3 years ago, s/p L percutaneous nephrostomy for
hydronephrosis secondary to retroperitoneal fibrosis, who
presents with R flank pain, nausea, vomiting, and acute renal
failure.

From [**6-9**] - [**2133-6-17**], the patient was admitted with hematuria on
the medicine service. He presented passing large clots of blood
in his urine with intermittent hematuria since Novemver [**2132**].
Hematuria was thought to be due to renal stones. He developed
worsening of his L flank pain and presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
During hospitalization, foley placed and CBI started.
Ciprofloxacin was also started for positive UA. Cr was elevated
to 3.4. CT showed B/L renal enlargement with perinephric
stranding and hydronephrosis without obstructing stone. Cr
trended downward after Foley placed, but then increased likely
due to obstruction; thus L percutaneous nephrostomy tube was
placed on [**2133-6-12**]. His hydronephrosis was thought to be
obstructive in nature, likely chronic due to RP fibrosis. For
his pyelonephritis, he was treated with cipro for pan-sensitive
e.coli x 10 days. Discharged with urology f/u for possible
permanent indwelling NU tubes will be needed.

The patient presented on day of admission due to increasing R
flank pain, nausea/vomiting, and weakness. His malaise and
weakness started 3 days ago. He has been checking for fevers at
home and his highest temperature was 98.0. Since yesterday
overnightat 10 PM, he had chills, nausea, vomiting (2-3 times)
with decreased po intake. He noted that his L nephrostomy tube
has had lower UOP. He also found it difficult to start his urine
stream yesterday. Denies dysuria or hematuria. His R sided flank
pain is [**9-17**] and sharp. Using a heating pad and taking a
percocet helped with the pain somewhat. His L sided flank pain
is a [**2134-4-12**] but has been chronic for last 3 months. These
symptoms are the same as his symptoms when he was previously
hospitalized.

In the ED, initial VS: T 98.3 HR 106 BP 115/64 RR 17 O2 96% RA.
Per [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] and automatic cuffs did not correlate with manual
BP rading 125/70 and automatic cuff [**Location (un) 1131**] 68/40. Labs drawn
and significant for leukocytosis 11.7 with 13% bands, anemia of
28.1, total bilirubin of 1.6, hyperkalemia of 5.4, BUN/Cr 55/3.7

culture, Blood cultures sent. CT abd/pelvis performed with R
sided hydronephrosis. Received 4 L NS. UOP 320 cc.Given morphine

<b><u>STUDIES</b></u>

CT ABD/PELVIS WO CONTRAST [**7-2**]

IMPRESSION:
1. Increased perinephric and periureteral stranding on the right
with mild
hydronephrosis and hydroureter. Stranding likely due to
progression of known retroperitoneal fibrosis but underlying
infection cannot be excluded. No renal or ureteral calculi
identified.

2. Status post nephrostomy on the left with decompression and no
residual
hydronephrosis.

3. Hiatal hernia and esophageal wall thickening raises concern
for
esophagitis.

RENAL ULTRASOUND [**7-4**]:

no evidence of abscess


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Hypotension/Sepsis due to E Coli bacteremia

Patient had hypotension, bandemia, fever 101.1, and urinalysis
suggestive of urinary tract infection. He was admitted to the
MICU and was given fluids but did not require pressors. His
blood and urine cultures grew pansensitive E. coli.  He was
treated with ciprofloxacin for a planned 14 day course.
Surveillance blood cultures remain NGTD, except for one of two
aerobic cultures from [**7-4**] which grew coagulase negative staph
which is felt to have been a contaminant as cultures from [**7-5**]
have been negative and only one of the set of cultures was
positive. He will be discharged with ciprofloxacin 500 Qday
(dosed for renal insufficiency) to complete a 14-day course.

2. Hydronephrosis

Likely secondary to retroperitoneal fibrosis resulting from XRT
for prostate cancer. Per urology instruction, had right sided
nephrostomy tube placed by IR with good result. He had a Foley
which was removed on [**7-4**]. He reported seeing scant urine in his
"Depends" daily. On [**7-6**], the left nephrostomy tube was not
producing output and was not able to be flushed by IR. Both the
left and right tubes were replaced by IR on [**7-7**]. The right tube
was functioning, but was found to have an extra subcutaneous
loop which may have been causing the patient discomfort. On
discharge both nephrostomies were draining well and t
