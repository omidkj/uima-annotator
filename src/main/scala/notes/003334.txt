Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9853**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP

History of Present Illness:
84 yo M w/ PMH of CHF, afib, LGIB, gastric ulcer s/p clipping,
gallstone pancreatitis and cholecystitis p/w abd pain, elevated
amylase/lipase and GNR bacteremia for ERCP from OSH in NH. Pt.
was initially admitted in early [**Month (only) **] to the OSH with
abdominal pain and diagnosed with cholecystitis and gallstone
pancreatitis. He reportedly had an NSTEMI during this episode
and so was only treated with antibiotics as surgery was too
risky. He was also admitted in [**Month (only) **] w/ GIB and had gastric
ulcer clipped. Most recently, he was watching a red sox game on
[**5-21**] when he began having abdominal pain then nausea and
vomitting. He had some blood in his emesis but at OSH his Hct
remained stable and his vomiting resolved. His amylase and
lipase were elevated in the 1000 range and his LFTs and Tbili/AP
were elevated as well. He was tachycardic and moderately
hypotense to 96/67. He was planned for MRCP but this was not
done given recent ulcer clipping w/ metal clip and he was
transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP and close monitoring from the ICU
at St. [**Hospital 11042**] Hospital in [**Location (un) 8117**], NH.
.
On presentation to the ICU, he continued to complain of
abdominal pain which he says was only improved with dilaudid but
returns to the same baseline pain in between doses.  He was
immediately taken for ERCP where stone fragments with frank pus
were drained.

Pertinent Results:
[**2165-5-24**] ERCP
Normal major papilla
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a
sphincterotome using a free-hand technique
Contrast medium was injected resulting in complete opacification
of the biliary tree. There were few filling defects that
appeared like sludge at the lower third of the common bile duct.
A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using
a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire
Sludge, few small stone fragments, and purulent bile in small
amount were extracted successfully using a 8.5 mm balloon.
Successful placement of a 10Fr 9cm biliary stent.
Otherwise, the caliber and course of the the common bile duct,
common hepatic duct, right and left hepatic ducts, and
intrahepatic bile ducts were normal.
Normal limited pancreatogram

[**2165-5-24**] AP CXR:
IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
radiographs:
Lungs are clear, heart top normal size, and pulmonary
mediastinal vasculature engorged. Pleural effusion is minimal if
any. No pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 yo M w/ CHF, Afib not anticoagulated, known cholelithiasis,
presents from OSH with gallstone pancreatitis and pansensitive
E.coli bactermia for ERCP.

#. E.coli bacteremia: Patient remained hemodynamically stable
throughout hospital course with good urine output. Given history
of known CHF he was carefully given IV fluid support and his
home lasix dose was initially held. OSH cultures from blood grew
E.coli pan sensative and he was switched from Zosyn to
ciprofloxacin on hospital day #2. He will finish a 14-day course
(last day [**6-5**]). Surveillance blood cultures were negative as of
day of discharge. He will follow up with ERCP in 6 weeks for
stent removal. The recommendation of the ERCP team that he be
considered for early cholecystectomy was discussed with the PCP
by both the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] team and hospitalist, and the PCP prefers to
hold off for now given his significant cardiovascular and
pulmonary comorbidities.

#Gallstone pancreatitis s/p ERCP: Pus drained from bile ducts
with sphincterotomy and stent placement. Patient improved
clinically and was advanced to regular diet without difficulty.
He will follow up with the ERCP team in 6 weeks for stent
removal.

#. Hx of GIB: Hct stable on admission but then began to trend
downward after recieving fluids, did not have any s/s of GIB and
his Hct eventually trended back towards the value at admission.

#. CHF/CAD: Appeared mildly volume overloaded on admission, but
given borderline BP in setting known bacteremia home lasix was
held and IVF given prn. As he recovered, spironolactone, then
lasix were resumed. Given brisk diuresis on home lasix and
increased dose of metoprolol, Lasix was decreased to 20mg daily
to allow blood pressure room. Continued on BB, imdur, statin,
not on aspirin at home [**3-18**] GI bleed; restarting coumadin as
below but would observe on this before adding ASA (can be done
as outpatient).
.
#. Afib: Afib: Presented from OSH in RVR. Controlled with one
dose of IV metoprolol 5mg. He was continued on PO metoprolol for
rate control and increased on hospital day #3 due to persistent
heart rate in the 130s, likely related to increased activity on
transfer to the medical floor (now walking independently, out of
bed). His metoprolol was titrated up to 75mg [**Hospital1 **] with good
effect. He remained asymptomatic throughout all tachycardic
episodes. His PCP has been holding coumadin given recent GI
bleed but had planned to restart this on [**5-27**], so he was started
on 2mg warfarin daily, to be followed by his PCP (discussed with
PCP)
