Chief Complaint:
Unresponsive

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation


History of Present Illness:
78 year old male with a past medical history significant for
NSCLC, CAD, AAA, DVT and recent extraction of 19 teeth 3 days
ago presents after being found down for up to 3 hours at his
nursing home. Per report normal at 5pm, then found down at 8pm
GCS 3 RR 8 labored breathing, unknown O2sat, SR at 60, BP
142/63, pinpoint pupils, no narcan response. FS 212. Intubated
by medics. Patient with recent tooth extraction was given opioid
pain medication.

Upon arrival to ED, resistence in airway/hard to vent. Gave
succ, propofol, and suctions out ? secretions/aspiration. Post
sedation patient became hypotensive requiring fluid boluses. CXR
with mediastinal process. CT head no acute process. CT torso w/o
contrast no acute pathology, right hilar mass-like opacity, RLL
likely related to history of lung cancer, and 5 mm stone in
distal CBD w/o duct dilitation. High lactate with neg UA, no
leukocytosis, or significant LFT abnormality. Noted positive
troponin, with normal CK, and EKG with ST depressions. New acute
renal failure. Neuro consulted for stroke and noted that with
lightened sedation patient postures to pain and pupils were
reactive. Upon transfer vitals HR 50s, BP 90s/50s, 100% on vent.
2 peripheral IVs.

Upon arrival intubated and sedated. Upon lightening sedation, pt
able to squeeze my hand on command. By squeeze, no pain abdomen,
chest, but pain in mouth. Yesterday patient complainted on pain
from his oral procedure and had some bleeding in mouth treated
with saline washes. After procedure difficulty swallowing
medications.

CXR [**2103-3-30**] - IMPRESSION:
1. Low-lying endotracheal tube with tip approaching the orifice
of the right main stem bronchus.
2. Unusual course of the nasogastric tube with the tip
projecting over the
liver. The nasogastric tube tip is likely beyond the gastric
pylorus. Please correlate clinically.
3. Elevated right hemidiaphragm with probable bibasilar
atelectasis.
4. Low inspiratory lung volumes. While this causes accentuation
of the
mediastinal silhouette, the mediastinum is somewhat widened and
if there is continued clinical concern for a mediastinal
process, chest CTA is
recommended.

CT Head [**2103-3-30**]: No acute intracranial pathology.

CT Torso [**2103-3-30**]:
1. No acute traumatic pathology.
2. Right hilar mass-like opacity adjacent to the surgical bed
with probable airway involvement, worrisome for recurrence of
neoplasm, similar in appearance to the prior study. Further
evaluation with CT chest with contrast is recommended.
3. Left renal 3.5 cm minimally complex cyst, which can be
further evaluated with ultrasound.
4. Choledocholithiasis with mildly dilated CBD measuring up to 1
cm.
5. Small bilateral pleural effusions.

EEG [**2103-3-31**]: abnormal portable EEG due to slowing of the
background suggestive of a mild encephalopathy. Medications,
toxic/metabolic disturbances, and infections are common causes.
Note is
also made of mild right central slowing suggestive of possible
subcortical dysfunction in this region. No epileptiform
discharges or
electrographic seizures were seen during this recording. An
irregular
rhythm was detected in a single EKG channel.

TTE [**2103-4-2**]: The LA is moderately dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is
moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. Trivial MR seen. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.

Brief Hospital Course:
78 year-old gentleman with history of NSCLC, CAD, AAA, DVT and
recent dental extraction who was found down for ~ 3h at his
nursing home.  The etiology for the unresponsive event is not
entirely.  It is possible that use of opiod pain medications
caused the patient to have respiratory depression which caused
him to become unresponsive.  He may have then had some
aspiration of oralpharyngeal secretions that caused him to have
respiratory failure requiring intubation.  There were no evident
localizing signs of infection.  Antibiotics were not used during
this hospitalization.  Seizure was considered and EEG was
performed on [**2103-3-31**] which revealed non-specific mild
encephalopathy.  In any case, as the respiratory status of the
patient improved, so did his mental function.  He was extubated
and transferred to the floor on [**2103-4-2**].  Initially, he required
a shovel mask, but was quickly transitioned to nasal canula
