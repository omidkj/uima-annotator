ADDENDUM TO PREVIOUS DISCHARGE SUMMARY FROM [**2145-4-2**]:
Since being transferred from the ICU to the general medical
service, the patient began to spontaneously diurese.
However, she still remained clinically volume overloaded and,
therefore, was started on diuretics with a goal to keep the
patient negative 1 liter a day.  The patient's creatinine
slowly improved.  In addition, the patient felt symptomatic
relief with decreasing shortness of breath, and decreasing
peripheral edema.  At the time of this dictation, the patient
is on 2 liters nasal cannula.  She is maintained on BiPAP
overnight while sleeping.

The renal consult team continued to follow the patient.  The
etiology of her acute renal failure is still unclear.
However, ATN in the setting of hypovolemia and high serum
vancomycin doses remains high on the differential.  Given
that her serum level of vancomycin was elevated, it was
discontinued, and her level remained in the therapeutic
range.  She, therefore, received the equivalent of a 14-day
course of vancomycin for presumed MRSA pneumonia.

For better control of hypertension, the patient's medication
was changed from nifedipine to diltiazem with good results.
Diltiazem was changed to extended release prior to discharge.
She is being discharged to an extended care facility.

DISCHARGE CONDITION;  On 2 liters nasal cannula, tolerating
PO diet, peripheral edema greatly improved, alert and
oriented, well-appearing, diuresing well, and creatinine
trending downward.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Acute renal failure, probably secondary to acute tubular
necrosis.
2. Congestive heart failure.
3. Hypercarbic respiratory failure.
4. Hypertension.
5. Coronary artery disease.
6. History of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus
pneumonia.
7. Obstructive sleep apnea.
8. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
9. Bronchiectasis.
10.Pulmonary hypertension.
11.Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

1. Fluticasone 4 puffs [**Hospital1 **].
2. Salmeterol 1 puff q 12 h.
3. Acetaminophen 325-650 po q 4-6 h prn.
4. Vitamin D 400 U po qd.

9. Colace 100 mg po bid.
10.Senna 8.6 mg po bid.
11.Famotidine 20 mg po bid.
12.Miconazole powder prn.
13.Gabapentin 300 mg po q 48 h (This dose will be increased
as renal function improves towards the patient's output
dosing of 800, 400 and 400.).
14.Subcu heparin.
15.Lasix 40 mg po bid.
16.Diltiazem ER 240 mg po qd.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient to follow-up with PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
within the next 2 weeks.  At that time, gabapentin will be
titrated upwards as renal function improves.  The patient to
follow a 1-1/2 liter fluid restriction a day, 2 gm sodium
diet, and daily weights.
