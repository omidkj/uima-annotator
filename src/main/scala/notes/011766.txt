Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2195**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
74 yo female who is a longtime smoker with spirometry in [**2193**]
c/w moderate COPD who presents to the ED with shortness of
breath. The patient had been feeling unwell with SOB, chest
tightness, and cough x 1 week, so she was seen at an outside
clinic for workup on [**1-9**]. Before that visit, the patient says
that her SOB started abruptly over the weekend and was
associated with cough and phlegm. On [**1-9**], the patient was
placed on a 5 day course of Levofloxacin. She was given a
prescription for Albuterol HFA. Her O2 sat in the office was 99%
and a CXR was only significant for bilateral lower lobe
infiltrates and small BL effusions and flat diaphragms. On [**1-10**],
the patient continued to experience chest tightness, fatigue,
and cough. She re-presented to the office, where her O2 sat was
88%. The patient was kept on the levaquin and started n
prednisone 60mg. A home health aide visited her today and noted
hypoxia to high 80's.  She received 3 nebs from EMS and was
brought to the hospital for further workup.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 97.4 84 110/67 30 91% on neb at
100%. She presented with respiratory distress and was noted to
have diffuse wheezing on exam. She trigger for hypoxia upon
arrival. CXR revealed a potential RML infiltrate. She was given
solumedrol 125mg and levoquin 750mg. EKG revealed SR at [**Street Address(2) 108015**] depression 4 through 6. She was given aspirin 325mg and
started on a heparin gtt for NSTEMI management.  She is
confirmed DNR/DNI so was started on noninvasive ventilation.
Vitals prior to transfer were afebrile, 73, 126/70,  CPAP 8/5,
Fi02 100%.
.
On arrival to the MICU,  she is in moderate resp distress and on
bipap, but can hold a conversation.
.
Of note, she has had her flu vaccine this year, and a pneumovax
after age 65.

Microbiology:
Blood culture [**2197-1-11**]- no growth x 2
.
Imaging:
CXR [**2197-1-11**]-
1. Bilateral, right greater than left pleural effusions with
overlying atelectasis.
2. Additional ill-defined opacity in the right mid lung could be
due to consolidation from infection and/or aspiration.
.
Transthoracic Echocardiogram [**2197-1-11**]- The left atrium is normal
in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with inferolateral hypokinesis. The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 45-50%). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
regurgitation is slightly eccentric, directed posteriorly and
likely arises from systolic tethering of the posterior leaflet.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension


Brief Hospital Course:
74 yo F with an extensive smoking history, COPD not on
medications, presenting with progressively worsening shortness
of breath and cough consistent with COPD exacerbation, and found
to have NSTEMI on admission.
.
# COPD exacerbation: appears to have been exacerbated by
possible PNA vs NSTEMI. Afebrile, no leukocytosis. Spirometry
shows FEV1/FVC = 65%, FEV1 61% predicted = Gold stage II. She
initially came to the MICU from the ED on BiPAP, which was
weaned on night of admission, and she was transferred to the
floor for further management.  She completed a 5 day course of
azithromycin and 7 day steroid burst of 60mg prednisone (tapered
to 40mg for last 2 days).  She was weaned from nasal cannula to
room air on the floor. Albuterol/ipratropium nebs were
transitioned to tiotropium, advair with as needed albuterol.
She was discharged on these medications.  Her ambulatory O2 Sat
on the day of discharge was 90-91% on RA.
.
# Possible volume overload: She was ~4 lbs above dry weight on
admission (dry weight ~114lbs, came in 118lbs), and had some
vascular congestion on CXR. She was diuresed gently (she is
lasix naive) on the night of admission with lasix 10mg IVx1 and
put out 1L. This seemed to improved her breathing. TTE was
performed and showed mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction (EF 45-50%), moderate mitral regurgitation, moderate
pulmonary hypertension. On transfer to the floor, she received
one additional dose of lasix given known bibasilar pleural
effusions, however, as she was oxygenating well on room air, no
further lasix was given and patient was not discharged on lasix.
 Weight on discharge was 51.4.
.
# NSTEMI: Troponin bump to 0.37 on admission  with ST
depressions in V4-V6. TIMI score was 5. She was put on a heparin
gtt, given ASA 325, metoprolol was started, high dose
atorvastatin started, ACEi held in acute setting. TTE did show
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
inferolateral hypokinesis. Cardiology felt that this was most
likely demand ischemia.  Following transfer to the floor,
cardiology felt that an outpatient stress test would be most
appropriate, and to continue medical management.  She was
discharged on metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **], atorvastatin 80mg and
aspirin 81mg.
.
# SLE: continued hydroxychloroquine
.
# Hypertension: Treated with amlodipine at home.  Amlodipine
held on admission.  Metoprolol initiated in setting of NSTEMI as
above.
.
# Depression: continued citalopram
.
# GERD: continued omeprazole
.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
# Discharge weight 51.4kg, patient will need daily weights and
may require lasix moving forward
# Ambulatory O2 saturation on day of discharge 90-91%
# Pulmonology follow-up not scheduled; patient will b
