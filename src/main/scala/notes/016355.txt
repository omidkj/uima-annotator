Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2147-12-19**] 1. Redo sternotomy. 2. Mitral valve repair with a 28-mm
[**Doctor Last Name 405**] annuloplasty band. 3. Sternal plating with the Synthes

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 83812**] is a 74 year old female who [**Known lastname 1834**] coronary
artery bypass grafting times four in [**2-27**] who has had
significant lower extremity edema and dyspnea on exertion
requiring continuing diuresis. Prior to her bypass she had an
Echo and Cath which showed moderate to severe mitral
regurgitaiton but only had evidence of [**12-23**]+ mitral regurgitation
at time of bypass. Therefore, she did not undergo valve
replacement or repair. She has had worsening symptoms since
surgery and subsequently had acute renal failure in [**6-28**] as well
as a gastrointestinal bleed then for which she was hospitalized.

Pertinent Results:
Intra-operative echo:
PRE BYPASS The left atrium is markedly dilated. The left atrium
is elongated. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen
in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. The
right atrium is dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function
is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
mild to moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
was notified in person of the results in the operating room at
the time of the procedure.

POST BYPASS The patient is receiving milrinone and
norepinephrine by infusion. There is normal left ventricular
systolic function. The right ventricle displays mild free wall
hypokinesis, somewhat improved from the prebypass period. There
is a posterior annular ring in situ. There is trace valvular
mitral regurgitation seen. The maximum pressure gradient through
the mitral valve is 9 mm Hg with a mean gradient of 3 mm Hg at a
cardiac output of 7 liters per minute and an effective valve
orifice area of about 3 cm2. The rest of the exam is unchanged
from the prebypass period. The thoracic aorta appears intact.

Small left pleural effusion, unchanged. There is no
pneumothorax. Moderate
cardiomegaly is unchanged. The mediastinum is widened,
unchanged. Sternal
closure hardwares are intact. A vertically oriented wire
fragment remains to the left of midline. Right PICC line with
the tip ending at the mid SVC.
Postoperative changes in the mediastinum are unchanged.
IMPRESSION:
1. Small left pleural effusion, unchanged.
2. New vertical atelectatic band in the right lower lobe, with

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2147-12-19**] Ms. [**Known lastname 83812**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a redo sternotomy/mitral
valve repair (#28mm annuloplasty ring)/sternal plating with
synthes system. Cardiopulmonary Bypass time=101 minutes.  Please
refer to Dr.[**Name (NI) 5572**] operative note for further details.  She
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred in critical but
stable condition to the surgical intensive care unit. A
post-operative urine culture was positive for Klebsiella
pneumoniae, which was sensitive to the cefazolin. She awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated on POD# 1 due to airway
edema resolution. She was weaned off drips. All lines and drains
were removed according to cardiac surgery protocol. She was
started on Aspirin, Beta-blocker, statin, and diuresis was
initiated. She continued to progress and was transferred to the
step down floor for further monitoring.  She was in
