Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**]
Chief Complaint:
thrombosed LUE AV [**Doctor First Name **]

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2187-11-24**]: attempted thrombectomy of AV [**Month/Day/Year **] by IR
[**2187-11-24**]: placement of right tunneled line by IR
[**2187-11-27**]: successful thrombectomy of AV [**Month/Day/Year **] by IR


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 96427**] is 83 year old with HTN, HLD, CAD, stage IV CKD
(HD MWF), COPD, dCHF (EF >55%) with multiple admissions for CHF
exacerbation, and recent admission for afib with RVR during
dialysis, who was admitted from [**Hospital **] clinic after failed dialysis.
 She has a recent history of having an occluded LUE AV [**Hospital **],
requiring thrombectomy and stent placement on [**2187-10-22**].  Patient
had unremarkable HD session on Wednesday [**11-21**], then developed
some arm pain on [**11-22**] in the evening; this was attributed to
fatigue after having done arm exercises earlier in the day.  On
the morning of admission, the patient also experienced transient
nausea.  She denies any other symptoms.  Diaylsis session today
could not even be started, and patient was sent to ED for
evaluation.  In the ED, initial vs were: 98.7 72 110/p 18 97%.
Exam was notable for absence of thrill over [**Month/Year (2) **], a "cordlike
AVG" and bibasilar crackles.  Bedside ultrasound demonstrated
100% fistula occlusion for 2-3 cm with no Doppler flow.  Labs
were notable for creatinine elevated to 5.4, and INR 1.8.
Transplant surgery was consulted, and recommended admission to
medicine with plan to have IR perform thrombectomy.  IR will do
thrombectomy tomorrow, after NPO tonight.
.
Vital signs prior to transfer were 96.1 po, 62, 106/73, 16, 100%
RA.
.
On the floor, patient was comfortable, though anxious because
her son, [**Name (NI) **], had not been reached yet.  Initial vital signs
were 97.3 122/palp 71 16 99%RA, weight 53.3 kg.

IMAGING:
[**2187-11-23**] LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND:
LEFT AV [**Month/Day/Year **] ULTRASOUND: Targeted evaluation of the antecubital
fossa reveals a completely occluded Dacron [**Month/Day/Year **], with no
detectable internal flow.  The venous outflow limb, likely the
cephalic vein, is also nearly occluded by acute expansile and
heterogeneous thrombus, with minimal areas of residual flow. The
left subclavian and axillary veins are patent with normal
waveforms.  The arterial inflow to the [**Month/Day/Year **] (brachial artery)
is widely patent, and demonstrates normal Doppler waveforms.
There is moderate overlying subcutaneous edema.
IMPRESSION: Complete AV [**Month/Day/Year **] occlusion, and near-complete
occlusion of the
.
[**2187-11-24**] AV FISTULOGRAM:
FINDINGS:
1. Complete thrombosis of the left arm AV [**Month/Day/Year **]. Flow was noted
in the arterial inflow on son[**Name (NI) **].
2. Near-complete thrombosis of the left arm venous outflow
tract. Of note,
was the extravasation of contrast from the [**Name (NI) **] adjacent to its
venous outflow anastomosis, presumably resulting from prior
[**Name (NI) **] access. Further
attempts at AV [**Name (NI) **] declot were abandoned.
IMPRESSION:
1. Uncomplicated AV [**Name (NI) **]-gram. Unsuccessful attempt at
declotting.
Fluoroscopy and son[**Name (NI) **] used for guidance.
2. Uncomplicated placement of a 12 French 20-cm temporary
hemodialysis catheter with VIP port via the patent left IJV and
with its tip in the lower SVC, under fluoroscopic and
son[**Name (NI) 493**] guidance.
.
[**2187-11-27**] AV FISTULOGRAM:
FINDINGS:
1. Successful mechanical and chemical thrombolysis of the left
arm AV [**Month/Day/Year **] and axillary vein.
2. Balloon dilatation of the axillary vein venous outflow and
the [**Month/Day/Year **] with a 7-mm x 40 mm balloon.
3. Balloon dilatation of the arterial anastomsois with 5 mm x 40
mm balloon.
