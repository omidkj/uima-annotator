INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Markedly dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderately dilated LV cavity. Severe global LV
hypokinesis.
Severely depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Markedly dilated RV cavity. Severe global RV
free wall
hypokinesis.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Moderately dilated ascending
aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis (AVR). AVR well
seated, normal
leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular
calcification. Severe (4+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Severe [4+] TR. Moderate PA systolic
hypertension.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is
severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is
severely depressed.
3. The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated. There is
severe global
right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
4. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
5. A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic
prosthesis
appears well seated, with normal leaflet motion and
transvalvular gradients.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe (4+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.

Renal ultrasound [**2194-10-25**]:
IMPRESSION: No interval change in appearance of the kidneys in
comparison to the exam from one day prior:
1. No hydronephrosis.
2. Stable bilateral renal cysts.
3. Ascites.




Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 68791**] is a 78 yo M w/heart failure, AF on coumadin, Ao valve
replacement, and CKD who presented with SOB, fatigue, anemia and
ascites.

GI
1. GI bleed: Mr. [**Known lastname 68791**] had a hct of 20.3 at presentation with
black stool that were guaiac positive. He denied hematemesis or
hematochesia. NG lavage was negative and he remained
hemodynamically stable. EGD showed an AVM in his stomach that
was successfully cauterized. His hct was repleted with 7 units
of pRBC's total and he retained a stable Hct of ~30. The patient
was kept of a PPI during his hospital course for his GI bleed.
2. Ascites: Mr. [**Known lastname 68791**] presented with an expanding abdomen over a
two week period. Diagnostic tap of the peritoneal fluid was
suggestive of cardiac ascites with a serum ascites albumin
gradient > 1.1 and total protein > 2.5. This is likely secondary
to his HF and severe TR.  A therapeutic tap withdrew 4L of
fluid. Abd ultrasound showed nodular echotexture of the liver
with irregular contour suggestive of cirrhosis.  LFT's were
within normal limits and there was appropriate synthetic
function with a serum albumin of 3.7. Hepatitis panel was
positive for hep A antibodies and negative for hep B and hep C.
Hep C PCR is still pending.
.
CARDIAC:
1. Heart failure: Mr. [**Known lastname 68791**] had an aortic valve replacement in
[**2181**], and was diagnosed with heart failure six years ago in
[**Hospital1 46**]. He presents with increasing SOB and fatigue, but [**Hospital1 **]
orthopnea and PND. He claims to have an exercise tolerance of
walking greater than half a mile. We obtained a TTE which
revealed an EF of 25% with 4+ TR and MR and 4 chamber dilation.
Mr. [**Known lastname 68791**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] ever having a heart attack and he had a cardiac
cath in [**2181**] that showed clean coronaries. His dilated
cardiomyopathy is presumed to be non-ischemic in nature. The
patient was fluid overloaded on presentation with bilateral
crackles up a third of his lung fields and pulmonary edema on
CXR. The patient was gently diuresed over his hospital course
and was breathing and sating well on RA with clear lung fields
prior to discharge. He was started on Toprol XL 12.5 qd and
lisinopril 5mg qd for his heart failure.  The patient did not
tolerate a
