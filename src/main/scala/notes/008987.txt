Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain, right renal hemorrhage, AoCRF

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
73 year old woman with PMHx hypertension, lupus, type 2 diabetes
(insulin dependent), OSA, gout, depression who presents with
abdominal pain since Monday afternoon. The patient states she
was in her usual state of health and driving to [**Location (un) 5028**] to
her son's house for [**Hospital1 107**] day festivities when she stopped to
get flowers and developed acute dull RLQ pain. She describes the
pain as "lumpy" sore pain that made her intermittently
diaphoretic. The patient was able to drive to her son's house
but stayed on the couch most of the time there. She felt briefly
light headed, like she was going to pass out, with poorer
mentation. She was, however, able to take in corn and meat
dishes without change in her pain. The patient had someone drive
her home and stayed home Monday-Wednesday as the pain was
persistent. The patient felt slightly better yesterday but worse
today and so she saw her PCP at [**Name9 (PRE) 2274**] - [**Location (un) **]. The patient has
not taken anything for pain, but found resting helped the
discomfort. The patient endorses subjective fevers, decreased
appetite, skin pallor, worsened pain in the RLQ with deep
breathing. Denies nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, chest
pain, BRBPR, hematemesis. Also denies flank pain, recent trauma
to her back, hematuria, dysuria, changes in urine output.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vitals were: T98.0, HR68,
BP132/54, RR18, 100% on 2L nasal cannula. Labs were drawn and
the patient was noted to have acute renal failure with
creatinine 3.3 (baseline 1.5-1.6) and drop in hematocrit to 26.6
(baseline 32-36), also mild leukocytosis to 12.2 with left
shift. Urinalysis with only RBC<1, negative for blood - also
negative for UTI. CT abdomen and pelvis was performed which
showed a 11 X 12 X 9cm swirling high density right renal
hemorrhage/rupture. Urology was consulted and recommended
non-surgical management for now. Renal was also consulted and
will follow the patient in-house. The patient was type and
crossed for two units of pRBC, two large bore IVs placed. She
received two liters IVF. VS on transfer: T97.8, HR73, BP125/58,
RR20, 95% on RA.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient walked comfortably from
stretcher to bed. Children at bedside. Has on-going dull RLQ
pain.
.
ROS: Denies chills, headache, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore
throat, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia,
dysuria, hematuria.

.
CT abdomen/pelvis without contrast [**6-29**]:
11 x 12 x 9 cm swirling high density in the right kidney
consistent with renal hemorrhage/rupture. High density cysts in
the left kidney should be evaluated with ultrasound or MRI for
characterization.
.
CXR on [**6-30**]:
FINDINGS: No previous images. The cardiac silhouette is within
normal limits and there is tortuosity of the aorta. No vascular
congestion or pleural effusion. There is increased opacification
at the right base medially with silhouetting of a portion of the
hemidiaphragm posteriorly, consistent with a lower lung
pneumonia.
.
CXR on [**7-4**]:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the
pre-existing right
basal opacity, suspected to represent pneumonia, has not
changed. Also
constant is a small atelectasis at the left lung base. Unchanged
borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without overt
pulmonary edema. Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
.
Renal US [**7-4**]:
IMPRESSION: Slightly decreased size of right renal perinephric
hematoma.
Multiple simple cysts within the left kidney.

Brief Hospital Course:
73 year old woman with PMHx hypertension, lupus, type 2 diabetes
(insulin dependent), OSA, gout, depression who presented with
RLQ abdominal pain and was found to have large renal hemorrhage
and acute on chronic renal failure.
.
# Right renal hemorrhage from ruptured cyst: Fairly large on CT
abdomen/pelvis, associated with leukocytosis and RLQ abdominal
pain. Patient has hx of bilateral complex renal cysts of unknown
etiology since [**5-8**]. Fhx of ESRD, so these may be related to
APKD. Etiology of hemorrhage unclear as the patient has not had
any trauma to the area, procedures/interventions (lithotripsy),
not on blood thinners. Likely it was spontaneous. Her hematocrit
remained stable while in the hospital and she did not require
blood transfusions. She was medically managed on the floor after
observation in the MICU, and followed by both nephrology and
urology. She received IV pain medication for her right flank
pain and was transitioned to PO pain medication at discharge
with minimal pain. She will follow up with her outpatient
urologist; it is recommended to perform an MR urography to
reevaluate cysts in [**4-2**] weeks.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient's Cr prior to
admission was
