Chief Complaint:
hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure

History of Present Illness:
This is a 78 year old man with PMH significant for CHF, adrenal
insufficiency who is s/p total knee replacement [**2103-3-19**] who
presents post intubation in the ED for respiratory failure. He
was recently admitted to the [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] for right TKR. His
postop course was complicated by hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory
failure. He was intubated post procedure, then extubated the
following day. He was diuresed with lasix and then discharged to
rehab on [**2103-3-24**]. Today he was found to be hypoxic so he was
transferred to [**Location (un) 620**]. He was hypoxic, and a CTA of the chest
was performed which was negative. He was also noted to have a
dilated right pupil. He received 1g vancomycin, 500 mg
levofloxacin, and 10 mg decadron. His family refused intubation
and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED. On transfer he became apneic
and unresponsive.
.
In the [**Hospital1 **] ED, he was found to have a fixed and dilated right
pupil and was in respiratory distress. His O2 sat was 100% on
NRB. His initial ABG was 7.32/73/293. He was intubated. Right IJ
was attempted with ultrasound by the wire could not be passed,
so an emergent right femoral line was placed. He was transferred
to the ICU.
.
On initial presentation to the ICU he was intubated and
unarousable, but became awake and denied pain or discomfort.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: eval ETT placement

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
78 M intubated s/p ETT advancement, pulled at tube
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval ETT placement
EXAMINATION: AP chest.

INDICATION: ET tube placement.

Single AP view of the chest is obtained on [**2103-3-25**] at
approximately 20:33 hours. The patient remains intubated with
the tip of the ET tube approximately 5 cm above the carina.
Appearances of the lung field is essentially unchanged in the
three-hour interval since the prior examination with lower lung
volumes and patchy subsegmental atelectasis at both bases. No
large pneumothorax is identified.

HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST: The evaluation is somewhat limited due
to motion. However, there is no acute intracranial hemorrhage.
There is no mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.
There is small right choroid fissure cyst or dilated
perivascular space as seen on the prior study from [**Location (un) 620**].
Mucosal thickening in the maxillary sinuses are noted. There is
air- fluid level in the nasopharynx.

IMPRESSION: Limited study due to motion, however, no acute
intracranial hemorrhage. Fluid in the nasopharynx.

Brief Hospital Course:
#) Respiratory failure. Unclear etiology in retrospect. DDx
includes pneumonia/aspiration, atelectasis, COPD exacerbation,
CHF, and medication effect. Unlikely CHF as EF 55% and no WMA
seen on recent echo at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) **], but BNP normal. Possible
component of COPD with smoking history, unknown FEV1. PE ruled
out by CTA. CXR relatively clear wihtout infiltrate. Likley
baseline pCO2 in the 60's given high bicarb and only mild
acidosis with pCO2 70's. Also may have contribution by seroquel.
 Pt was extubated the morning after admission and respiratory
status remained stable thereafter. He was treated empirically
for nosicomial pneumonia with vanc/levo/flagyl and intially
given IV steroids, which were quickly changed to his usual
steroid dose. He received albuterol/atrovent nebs standing. A
swallow study can be considered to fully rule out silent
aspiration though was not clinically aspirating and tolerating a
normal diet. He should have a repeat CXR on [**2103-3-28**] and all
antibiotics discontinued if there is no infiltrate. He should
also have outpatient sleep study and PFT's considered.

#) dilated right pupil - His initially dilated pupil became more
responsive throughout his course. His tox was negative. Neuro
evaluated and initially wanted MRI of the brain, but it improved
gradually and the rest of his neuro exam was normal, so it was
felt most likely to be due to atrovent in the eye. MRI was no
longer indicated.

#) s/p right TKR [**2103-3-19**]. Surgeon was Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 44955**]. Coumadin
was initially held, but then restarted and should be continued
for 3 weeks post surgery goal [**2-24**]. He should follow up with his
surgeon for staple removal approx day 14 postop and PT should
follow.

#) Addison's disease - received 10 mg decadron at [**Location (un) **], then
125 IV solumedrol Q8H for 2 doses. Changed back to home regimen
of 30mg qAM and 10mg qPM. BP stable.

#) type 2 diabetes - diet-controlled at home. Received insulin
SS while on higher dose steroids

#) peripheral vascular disease - restarted low dose aspirin and
statin prior to discharge

#) nail onchomycosis - Discontined lamisil as LFT's elevated.
PCP to consider restarting after rehabilitation.

#) FEN - resumed regular diet after extubation
#) code - full per family/patient
