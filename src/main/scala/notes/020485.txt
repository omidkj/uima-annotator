Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was seen in the emergency department early on the
morning of [**2-8**] after falling and sustaining a left proximal
humerus fracture. At the time of first examination, the patient
had a large ecchymosis but no hematoma over her left
hip/buttock.  Her head and C-spine CTs were negative for acute
abnormality.  When examined 2 hours later, this area had grown
significantly in size suggesting an actively bleeding hematoma.
A CT of her torso was done showing large hematoma in the left
gluteal region with active extravasation.  After this scan, her
hematocrit was rechecked which had dropped from 37 to 22.  She
was thus  consented and taken to the angiography suite where
active extravasation was demonstrated at the L5 segmental
artery.  This artery was coiled and bleeding was stopped.
During angiography, she received 2 units of PRBC with
significant improvement in hematocrit to 33.  Post-angio, she
was admitted to the TSICU where she was monitored closely.  The
patient did not become hemodynamically unstable, but she did
have another hematocrit drop to 22.5 on [**2-10**] for which she
received 2 units of PRBC.  Later on [**2-10**], she was felt to be
stable for transfer to the floor where she remained
hemodynamically stable and did not require any further
transfusions. During hospitalization, the patient also was
evaluated by the spine service.  Due to some post-fall low back
pain, as she was a patient of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**] who had previously done
an L4-S1 spinal fusion with instrumentation at L5-S1. Imagine
was stable and no intervention was necessary.
On the floor, the patient tolerated a regular diet and voided
without problems.  [**Name (NI) **] pain was controlled with oral pain
medication and was given a bowel regimen to avoid constipation.
She was seen by physical therapy and it was decided that the
patient would benefit from rehabilitation at an inpatient
facility.  She was discharged on [**2-12**] in stable condition.
