History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 86903**] is a 66 yo man with AML M1-2 s/p induction currently
C1D16 on HIDAC consolidation who presents with R shoulder pain
and fatigue. Seen at 7Feldberg outpatient clinic for count check
yesterday; he complained of feeling very poorly and requested to
come in early, gait was unstable & he used a wheelchair. He
states that since sleeping on his R shoulder on Sunday night, he
has had [**8-4**] pain in the shoulder and difficulty moving it
secondary to pain. States that he was unable to sleep at all the
past two nights secondary to the pain. His vital signs at clinic
the day prior to admission were BP 129/86, HR 116 T 98.2 RR 18
O2 Sat%: 98%. His labs were wbc 0.1 hgb.7.8/hct.21.8 and
platelets 5; he was transfused with 2u prbc and 1 bag of
platelets.
.
Today the patient reports that he was feeling extremely fatigued
and so called an ambulance. He was taken to an outside hospital
where he received vancomycin and zosyn. He was then transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management and found to have T 103.3,
tachycardia to 120s, and SBP 94. Blood cultures were sent and he
was started on vanc/cefepime.

Past Medical History:
Oncologic History:
His induction chemotherapy was complicated by acute kidney
injury and neutropenic fever.  Induction with 3+7 was
unsuccessful, so he was re-induced with MEC, which resulted in
prolonged cytopenias and a brief ICU stay for respiratory
difficulty.  His only sibling is not a match and a search for a
matched unrelated donor has not been fruitful. He has therefore
enrolled in a dendritic fusion vaccine trial (protocol 09-014)
with PT1 and is now starting consolidation.
.
ROS: He reports extreme fatigue, R shoulder pain, blood tinged
mucus from right nostril. Denies wght loss, headache, dizziness,
visual changes, chest pain, dyspnea, cough, abd pain, back pain,
constipation, diarrhea, hematochezia, hematuria, other urinary
symptoms, or rash.
.
Past Medical History:
- AML M1-2, normal cytogenetics, NPM-1 negative, FLT3 negative,
s/p 3+7 induction, MEC re-induction, complicated by acute kidney

injury and neutropenic fever.
- Osteoarthritis, s/p L TKA, R THA.
- h/o negative colonoscopy-last [**2154**].
- Hypertension.
- Seasonal Allergies.
- GERD.

Social History:
Never married, no children.  Lives alone.  Retired fireman.
U.S.M.C. veteran during [**Country 3992**], stationed in Okinawa.  He is a
never smoker, denies alcohol and illicit drug use.  He
frequently travels to the southwest (e.g. [**State 15946**]).


Family History:

mother of ?CHF.  Multiple family members w/ CVA as cause of
death.  No known h/o hematologic malignancies.

Studies:
[**10-25**] TTEcho: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta and aortic
arch are mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses
or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral
valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
quality. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2158-8-1**], the
left ventricular systolc function is now less vigorous (low
normal) but without regional dysfunction. Valvular morphology is
similar.

[**10-25**] EKG: Sinus tachycardia. Otherwise, normal tracing. Compared
to
the previous tracing ST-T wave changes are less prominent and
the Q-T interval is shorter.

[**10-26**] RUQ U/S: The liver demonstrates no definite focal or
textural abnormality. There is no biliary dilatation. The CBD is
normal in caliber, measuring 4 mm. The portal vein demonstrates
normal hepatopetal flow. The gallbladder appears mildly
distended without evidence of internal stone or sludge.
Previously seen tiny anterior wall gallbladder polyp is not
demonstrated on current exam. There is no gallbladder wall
thickening or pericholecystic fluid. A 3.6 cm simple upper pole
right renal cyst is unchanged. There is no perihepatic fluid.
Partially visualized pancreas appears within normal limits. No
elicited [**Doctor Last Name **] sign.

IMPRESSION:
1. No focal liver abnormality.
2. Mildly distended gallbladder without wall thickening or
pericholecystic
fluid.
3. Stable simple right renal cyst.

[**10-27**] CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis-
1. Multifocal bilateral ground-glass opacities represent either
infectious or inflammatory foci.
2. Small amount of new, intermediate density peritoneal and
pelvic fluid, but no evidence of organized chest, abdominal or
pelvic fluid collections to suggest abscess.
3. Unchanged, enlarged pulmona
