Interventional details

The LAD-diagonal branches can be approached with a simultaneous
V
stenting technique in the LAD and diagonal branch.  It appears
that both stents will be approximately 20 mm in length.  In
addition, the large ramus branch also has diffuse disease that
will require a long stent in the event of residual ischemia.

The patient's chest pain was improved - and we have the time to
discuss the options of CABG versus multivessel bifurcation
stenting with long DES.  The risk of stent thrombosis with two
long stents in this location is not negligible.

We will begin more aggressive beta blockage (his HR is in the
90s), administer IV eptifibatide x 18 hours, and titrate his IV
NTG for pain control.  We will hold his clopidogrel in the event
that surgery is selected.

Assessment & Recommendations
1.	Two vessel coronary artery disease (LAD, ramus)
2.	Consider CABG v. multivessel PCI
.
- CTA Chest ([**2162-5-23**]) -
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute aortic syndrome or pulmonary embolus.
2. Centrilobular emphysema predominantly in upper lobes. Right
middle lobe
and lingular atelectasis.
3. Small hiatal hernia.
.
-ECHO [**5-24**]
Conclusions
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular
cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic
function. No pericardial effusion identified.
.
[**2162-5-27**] ECHO
The interatrial septum is [**Month/Day/Year 76472**]. A patent foramen ovale is
present. A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is
seen at rest. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

: Normal overall LV and RV systolic function with no regional
wall motion abnormalities. Mild MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] with PFO and
left to right shunt.
Post OPCABG
Ventricular function is preserved.
Valve function similar to Pre CABG.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 76473**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2162-5-23**] for further
management of his chest pain and myocardial infraction. He was
placed on heparin and plavix. Chest xray suggested a widened
mediastinum and thus a ct scan was obtained. This showed a small
hiatal hernia, emphysema and no aortic dissection or embolism. A
cardiac catheterization was performed which revealed severe two
vessel disease. Given the severity of his disease, the cardiac
surgical service was consulted. Mr. [**Known lastname 76473**] was worked-up in the
usual preoperative manner. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 6**] [**Doctor Last Name 6237**] test was performed which
showed the left radial artery to suitable for use as conduit.
Plavix was held. On [**2162-5-27**], Mr. [**Known lastname 76473**] was taken to the
operating room where he underwent off pump coronary artery
bypass grafting to three vessels. Please see operative note for
details. Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit
for
