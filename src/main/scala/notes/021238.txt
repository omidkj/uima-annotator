baseline), mvr, AAA repair, afib, esrd on hd who presents with
subacute dyspnea. Patient reports these symptoms are consistent
with prior CHF exacerbation. Patient developed dyspnea both at
rest and with exertion 3 days ago, worsening LE edema 3 days

bloody streaks for 2 days. Patient reports no chest pain, or
palpitations, but does have PND and orthopnea over this time

noncompliance. Patient was at HD today, and because of symptoms
she presented to the ED.

IVF. Received Vanco 1g IV x1 and CTX 1g IV x1 because of

worsening by underlying COPD and AF. She received diltiazem drip
in the ICU to help control her af, and received steroids for

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 yo F with chf, copd (FEV1 75, on 2L
baseline), mvr, AAA repair, afib, esrd on hd who presents with
hypoxic respiratory distress, with goals eventually focused on
comfort at patient's request, who expired.
.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure: Most likely related to CHF.
Patient underwent HD for fluid removal x1.  She was started on
prednisone and standing nebs. Azithromycin was started and
changed to Vanc/Zosyn after she desaturated with increased work
of breathing. All medications were eventually discontinued after
goals were focused on comfort at patient's request and morphine
drip was started. Patient expired at 10:25am on [**2163-3-6**]. Family
declined postmortem exam.
.
# Hypotension: Normotensive at admission to the MICU after
hypotension in ED.
.
# ESRD: HD x1. Continued cincacalcet and nephrocaps.
.
# Afib: Started on reduced PO dose initially given hypotension
and despite RVR in ED. Episodes of RVR triggered diltiazem drip
which was continued until morning of expiration.
