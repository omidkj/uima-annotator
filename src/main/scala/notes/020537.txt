been treated with Rocephin 4 days x 2 courses.  As well the
patient has had 1.15 weeks of treatment with nebs q4.  This AM
he was found to have sats of 91% at 9 AM that decreased to 86%
associated with extreme SOB, cough.  O2 sat continued to
decrease and neb was given.  Continued to desat and finally had
02 sat of 77% prior to transfer. The patient was found to have
an increased oxygen requirement and an o2 sat in the 70s at
rehab.  His oxygen was increased at rehab with some improvement
and was transferred to the ED.  He reports that prior to
transfer he was given lasix.

In the Ed the patient was found to have t 101.8 , SBP 157/75, RR
33 02 100%. An ABG showed CO2 retention and was then started on
CPAP.  With CPAP, his 02 sats improved to 95%.  Additionally he
was given vancomycin, cefepime, albuterol, atrovent, and
methylprednisolone 125mg.  Of note, despite documentation for

[**2169-6-5**] CXR - SINGLE PORTABLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: The
study is limited by patient's size, slight rotation, and
portable technique. However, there is no significant change
since the study from [**2168-11-3**]. Again are demonstrated
bibasilar opacities reflecting chronic lung disease with
bronchiectasis and atelectasis. The lung apices are not well
visualized secondary to patient positioning. A small amount of
fissural fluid is identified on the right. A pacing device is in
unchanged position with the leads intact. The bony thorax is
unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Despite limitations of study, no apparent change of
chronic bibasilar opacities from seven months prior.
.
[**2169-6-7**] CXR - Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**6-6**], [**2169**].

There is no appreciable change in bilateral perihilar vascular
congestion and right lower lobe opacity, most likely consistent
with vascular engorgement. Bibasilar atelectasis is unchanged.
There is no increase in pleural effusion. The left hemidiaphragm
is less distinct compared to the prior study, which might be due
to new areas of aspiration if clinically suspected.

Brief Hospital Course:
#. Hypoxia - On admission the pt reported 4 days shortness of
breath and non-productive cough, wheezing. On day of admission
the patient was found to have an increased oxygen requirement
and an o2 sat in the 70s at rehab. His oxygen was increased at
rehab with some improvement and was transferred to the ED. In
the Ed the patient was found to have t 101.8 An ABG showed CO2
retention and was then started on CPAP.  With CPAP, his 02 sats
improved to 95%.  Additionally he was given vancomycin,
cefepime, albuterol, atrovent, and methylprednisolone 125mg. On
arrival to ICU the pt was sating in mid 90s on FM. He is noted
to have chronic CO2 retention. The patient was continued on
lasix with subsequent improvement in respiratory status. His CXR
demonstrated no change in chronic bilateral opacifications. The
patient remained afebrile throughout his hospitalization. He
tolerated CPAP overnight well. His O2 was weaned to 6L NC with
good toleration. His antibiotics were discontinued as the pt had
a normal WBC and no fever. His initial fever is attributed to
likely aspiration pneumonitis. Steroids were not continued as he
had no evidence of ongoing wheezing. His IV lasix were
transitioned to 80mg po BID. His lasix should continue to be
titrated as needed based on Cr and daily weights. He should also
continue to use CPAP nighly for his obstructive sleep apnea. The
patient had good toleration of CPAP with a setting of 10.
.
#. Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF - On admission the patient had
evidence of volume overload with LE edema, elevated JVP and
pulmonary crackles. The patient was given lasix IV. He is
incontinent of urine however based on wt the pt responded with
3kg with loss. Discharge wt 95.9kg. He was continued on his home
medications of digoxin. His lasix were transitioned to 80mg po
BID as above.
.
#. Gout: continued on allopurinol
.
#. Hypothyroid: Continued Synthroid
.
#. FEN: aspiration precautions, dyshagia diet
.
#. Code - On arrival to the ED the patient had requested that he
would like his code status to be changed from DNR to Full Code.
He and his son have stated they would consider changing back to
DNR after discharge back to rehab. This issue should be
addressed again following arrival to rehab facility.
