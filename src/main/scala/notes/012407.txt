CT chest/[**Last Name (un) 103**]/pelvis [**2120-4-1**]:
1) Small left anterobasal pneumothorax with pneumomediastinum
and a large amount of left chest wall subcutaneous emphysema.
2) Bibasilar consolidation/collapse.
3) Left clavicular, left scapular, fracture and fractures
through the left 1st through 7th ribs.
4) Left renal hematoma, primarily intraparenchymal/subcapsular
in location. Left renal hilar vessels are intact. Both kidneys
enhance symmetrically.
5) Small high density left pleural fluid collection, which may
represent hemothorax.
6) Left hepatic low density round lesion, which may represent a
simple hepatic cyst.
##
CXR [**2120-4-7**]:
There has been interval removal of the left chest tube. No
pneumothorax is identified. The right lateral lung is off the
film. However, in the right lower lobe is new alveolar
infiltrate.

Brief Hospital Course:
NEUROLOGY: Mr. [**Known lastname 58669**] was admitted to the TSICU for close
monitoring of his respiratory function following the diagnosis
of extensive left-sided chest injuries. The patient's mental
status remained stable throughout his hospital stay. His pain
was controlled with fentanyl as needed. This was supplemented by
the placement of an epidural on HD#3 once his spine was cleared.
##
ORTHO: The patient injuries were mainly localized at the left
side of his chest with multiple rib fractures, a clavicular and
scapular fracture. This was managed with agressive pain control
as discussed above and a sling to control the clavicular
fracture.
##
PULMONARY: The patient's oxygen saturation fluctuated during the
course of his ICU stay and he often required CPAP at night when
his saturations would drop to the mid-high 80s. He otherwise did
well on a NRB mask with saturations in the high 90s. The patient
also had difficulty coughing and required regular physical
therapy support. This improved after removal of his chest tube
on HD#7. On day of discharge, the patient had saturations in the
mid-90s on 5L NC.
##
CARDIAC: The patient's coronary artery disease was stable during
his hospital stay. He was initially placed on iv metoprolol and
subsequently on his usual regimen of carvedilol, losartan,
lipitor when he was able to take oral medications. His ECGs and
enzymes remained within normal range during his stay with us.
##
INFECTIOUS DISEASE: The patient developed a mild RLL infiltrate
on HD#9 which was treated with levofloxacin. The patient
remained afebrile throughout his stay. He will continue his
antibiotic therapy for 6 days after discharge.
##
The patient was discharged on HD#11 in stable condition, able to
ambulate on his own and with oxygen saturations in the mid-high
90s on 5L NC. He will transition in a rehabilitation facility
prior to returning home. Instruction were given to return to the
Trauma, Orthopedic and Ophthalmology clinics for follow up.
