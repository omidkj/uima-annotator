Brief Hospital Course:
1) UTI/sepsis:
Admitted to ICU for early sepsis.  Did not require pressors. Pt
started on ceftriaxone initially.  E.coli from urine culture at
[**Hospital3 2558**] that was pansensitive except fluroquinolones.
However, due to concern of AIN from ceftriaxone, changed to
augmentin after 7 days.  Completed 12 day course and stopped due
to drug rash. Likely cannot tolerate any PCNs or beta lactams.
.
2) Rapid Atrial fibrillation:
Has had a-fib in the past. Likley worsened given acute illness
and dehydration. On long acting Beta blocker and amio as a
outpt.  Loaded with IV amio and put on PO.  Also on metoprolol
25 po tid to control HR as long as BP is stable.  After leaving
ICU, has been in NSR or paced.  Discharged on amio 200 mg daily,
f/u in device clinic.
.
3) Valvular heart disease:
TTE showed 4+MR with normal EF.  As she cannot be on an ACEI due
to renal function, was started on imdur and hydalazine.
.
4) Renal Failure:
Creatinine was up to 5 on admission while baseline is  in 1's.
Renal ultrasound did not show evidence of obstruction.  There
were rare urine eos on exam and renal consult felt this was
acute interstitial nephritis from ceftriaxone.  The antibiotic
was changed.  Cr trending down slowly, but now stable in mid 3s.
This may be her new baseline. She will f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
5) Hypernatremia:
Secondary to poor PO intake.  Has resolved with IVF with D5W.
Will need to monitor to assure stays ok.
.
6) Parkinson's - Restarted Sinemet
.
7) Arthritis - Hip XR neg for fracture but consistent with
arthritis although a limited study.
- Holding NSAIDs and ultram in light of renal failure. Daugther
brought in capasacian cream.
- Pt much more comfortable on regimen of Tylenol RTC and
dilaudid.
.
8) Drug Rash: seen by dermatology, felt to be drug rash from
augmentin, which was discontinued. Cannot tolerate beta lactams.
.
8) DVT:  in right common femoral vein.  Started on heparin gtt
and coumadin. Continue coumadin goal INR [**2-13**].
