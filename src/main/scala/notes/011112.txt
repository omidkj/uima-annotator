chest pressure

History of Present Illness:
This 33 year old white male is well known to our service as he
presented with Type A aortic dissection approximately 2 weeks
ago.  Post-op course complicated
by stroke with residual LUE weakness and RUE motor loss which
began to return prior to discharge.  He was discharged to rehab
on POD 10.  He returns today complaining of chest pressure that
came on at rest.  It is present across the chest without
radiation.  It is unlike his presenting pre-op pain, and not the
incisional pain he experienced post-operatively.  Pain improves
with ativan.  Pain is associated with SOB and anxiety.  CXR is
unremarkable, initial
ED ultrasound reportedly does not reveal pericardial effusion.
EKG reveals normal sinus rhythm without evidence of ischemia.

The patient is not anticoagulated, and symptoms are concerning
for PE.  Additionally, he is found to be in renal failure with a
rise in creatinine from 0.7 on discharge, to 2.4 today.

 Final Report
There is an intimal flap arising from the proximal extent of the
aortic arch, extending all the way inferiorly into the left
common iliac artery, consistent with aortic dissection. The left
subclavian and left common carotid arteries arise from what
appears to be the true lumen. The innominate artery has been
bypassed and arises from the lateral aspect of the aortic root,
proximal to the dissection flap (4, 24). The celiac trunk, SMA,
and bilateral renal arteries also arise from the true lumen. The
[**Female First Name (un) 899**] arises from the false lumen (4, 79). Patient is status post
type A dissection repair of the thoracic aorta and arch with
post-surgical changes. There are soft tissue densities
surrounding the aortic root without definite evidence of active
extravasation.
Curvilinear calcifications are seen at the aortic root. There is
bypass of
the innominate artery, which is normal in caliber and patent.
Within
limitation of current examination, there is no definite
extension of the
dissection into internal or external iliac arteries on the left.
The right
iliac artery arises from the true lumen.
CT CHEST: The thyroid demonstrates no focal lesion. A few mildly
enlarged
prevascular and precarinal lymph nodes are noted, likely
reactive. The heart is normal in size without significant
pericardial effusion. Moderate left and small right pleural
effusions are seen with associated compressive atelectasis.
Ill-defined peripheral areas of ground-glass opacities
predominating the left upper lobe and right lower lobe are
nonspecific, which could represent infectious, inflammatory, or
ischemic changes.
A nonocclusive pulmonary embolus is seen in the right main
pulmonary artery extending into the upper, middle, and lower
lobe subsegmental pulmonary arteries. No definite pulmonary
embolism is appreciated in the left lung, although evaluation is
limited since current study is not tailored for evaluation of
pulmonary embolism.
CT ABDOMEN: Within limitation of early contrast bolusing
limiting organ
evaluation, the liver, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands
appear within
normal limits. Gallbladder contains intermediate density
material in its
dependent portion, suggestive of sludge. Bilateral kidneys
demonstrate
symmetric enhancement without hydronephrosis or hydroureter. The
stomach,
small and large bowel loops are normal in caliber. There is no
mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. There is no free
air or free fluid.
CT PELVIS: The bladder is collapsed, with a Foley catheter in
place. The
rectum and sigmoid colon appear unremarkable. There is no
inguinal or pelvic lymphadenopathy. There is no free fluid
within the pelvis. A 5.5 x 2.8 cm area of simple fluid is
present in the right groin, anterior to the distal aspect of the
right external iliac artery, with several adjacent small clips,
likely related to recent intervention.
BONE WINDOWS: No definite concerning focal lesion. A bone island
is seen in the right anterior acetabulum. Anterior median
sternotomy wires appear
aligned.
IMPRESSION:
1. Status post recent thoracic aorta and arch repair with soft
tissue
densities surrounding aortic root without definite evidence of
active
extravasation.
2. Aortic dissection with intimal flap arising from the proximal
aortic arch distal to the origin of innominate artery bypass,
extending the entire length of the descending aorta into
proximal left common iliac artery. All major branching vessels
arise from the true lumen with the exception of the inferior
mesenteric artery, which arises from the false lumen.
3. Pulmonary embolus within the main right pulmonary artery
extending into
subsegmental pulmonary arteries in the upper, middle, and lower
lobes.
4. Ground glass peripheral pulmonary opacities in the left upper
lobe and
right lower lobe are nonspecific, which could represent
infection,
inflammation, or ischemic sequelae. Moderate left and small
right pleural
effusions.
5. Probable gallbladder sludge.
