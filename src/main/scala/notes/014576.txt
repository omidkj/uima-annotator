Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain, pericardial effusion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
pericardiocentesis


History of Present Illness:
63yo F with NSCLC s/p chemo and XRT, recent PE on Coumadin,
L-sided pleural effusion s/p VATS and pleurX catheter [**4-5**], with
CP and SOB.  Found to have moderate-sized pericardial effusion
without signs of tamponade, and ? STEs.  She had a recent
hospitalization from [**Date range (1) 102876**] for pulmonary embolism and
malignant pleural effusion.  She had experienced some mild
substernal chest pressure during that admission that was felt to
be GERD.  She had no further episodes of chest pressure until
yesterday.  Onset while watching TV, [**5-28**], with some SOB with
deep breathing, no associated N/V/LH/D/ha, not relieved by
Tylenol x 4.  She has also had increased LE edema, although she
states it has been progressive for a long time.  She denies
worsening orthopnea, PND.
.
In the ED, she was afebrile with HR 110s, BP 95/53.  She
received levo/Flagyl for suspected postobstructive pneumonia,
CTA to look for PE, 4L NS.  Her EKG was read as having possible
ST elevations inferiorly.  TTE showed moderate-sized pericardial
effusion without tamponade.  The chest pressure resolved in the
ED, spontaneously per the patient.

Past Medical History:
1. NSCLC: dx [**8-23**], L-sided, s/p 2 cycles cisplatin and etoposide
with XRT, s/p 3 cycles taxetere [**11-23**], malignant pleural
effusion s/p VATS and PleurX catheter on [**4-5**], on 4L home O2
2. PE: dx [**3-24**], on Coumadin
3. PID

.
EKG: sinus tach at 139bpm, normal axis and intervals, <1mm STE
in II/III, <1mm ST depression in V1
.
CXR: Interval re-aeration of a significant portion of the left
mid and lower lung zones; no other interval change, compared to
study on [**2104-4-8**].
.
CTA chest:
1. No PE.
2. New moderate-amount pericardial effusion, measuring up to
20HU. Fluid along the descending and ascending aorta, of unknown
etiology. Clinical correlation and further work-up is
recommended.
3. Decreased left locurated pleural fluid.
4. Coronary artery calcification.
5. Persistent collapse of the left upper lobe with narowwed
airway
.
TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
is a moderate sized pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
.
TTE ([**2104-3-27**]):
1. The left atrium is dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
3. A huge pleural effusion is present.
4. There is a small, loculated (mostly anterior and medial)
pericardial effusion. The effusion is echo dense, consistent
with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.

Brief Hospital Course:
.
# Dyspnea:  Her chronic dyspnea is felt primarily secondary
non-small cell lung cancer with left malignant pleural effusion.
 She had a minimal amount of pleural fluid drained by IP via
PleurX catheter already in place two times during the admission.
 She had stable O2 requirement.  She underwent
pericardiocentesis for possible symtpomatic improvent, and she
experienced minor improvement in her shortness of breath
afterwards.  She had some reaccumulation of her pericardial
effusion after the procedure, but it was stable on repeat TTE,
so it was felt to be an unlikely contributor to her symptoms.
.
# Pericardial effusion:  On admission, she had mild tamponade on
exam.  She likely had a constrictive component as well with a
Kussmaul's sign, and evidence of pericarditis on EKG.  She
underwent pericardiocentesis on [**4-22**], with drainage of ~450cc of
bloody fluid.  Her pericardial drain was pulled after 2 days
without significant drainage.  TTE after the procedure shows
reaccumulation of an organizing effusion, with no tamponade.
Her effusion was stable on a repeat TTE.  Pericardial window was
therefore felt to be not indicated.

.
# PE:  Her PE was diagnosed in [**3-24**] and she has been on Coumadin
as an outpatient.  Her INR was supratherapeutic on admission.
She received 4U FFP before pericardiocentesis.  Her Coumadin was
held for several days because her INR remained therapeutic,
likely secondary to poor nutritional status and antibiotics.
After it began to drift down, she was restarted on Coumadin at a
lower dose.  As regular lab draws are not consistent with her
wishes regarding goals of care, Coumadin was discontinued upon
discharge.
.
# Leukocytosis: She had a persistent leukocytosis between 16 to
25 throughout her stay.  She was treated empirically for
post-obstructive pneumonia with a 7-day course of levofloxacin
and Flagyl.  She was afebrile throughout her stay.  Her UA was
clear.
.
# Anemia: Her baseline hematocrit is between 28-31.  She
received 1U PRBC in an attempt to improve her symptoms, but
experienced no change.
.
# FEN:  She appeared total volume overloaded but intravascularly
dry, likely due to her low oncotic pressure from
hypoalbuminemia.  She had very poor po intake throughout her
stay due to lack of appetite.  She also had hypernatremia
thought secondary to intravascular depletion that improved with
free water repletion.
.
# Social:  Oncology and Palliative care followed her throughout
her stay.  She had lengthy discussions with them and the primary
team regarding her goals of care.  She decided she would like to
be DNR/DNI with home hospice, and would not want further
hospitalizations.  She indicated that she wanted all home
services decisions made by her son, as she did not feel she
could make those decisions.  Family support at home was being
coordinated.  However, her respiratory status worsened while
still at the hospital.  She expired on [**2104-5-4**].
