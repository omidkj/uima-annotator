LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 16,

neutrophils, 15% lymphocytes, 5% monocytes, 140 sodium,

protein, no bilirubin, 11 to 20 white blood cells, occasional
bacteria, 0 to 2 hyaline casts, occasional mucous.  KUB
showed several air fluid levels dilated, consistent with
focal ileus, but cannot rule out small bowel obstruction.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted.  CT showed
dilated small bowel loops and collapse distal loops.  She was
kept NPO until [**10-21**] where she was advanced to clears.  The
patient was kept on intravenous fluids normal saline at 125
cc per hour for the first three to four days.  Her diuretics
were held.  The patient became 3 to 4 liters positive over
three days and on [**10-22**] experienced sudden onset of shortness
of breath probably from volume overload.  She was ruled out
for an myocardial infarction by serial cardiac enzymes.  The
patient's O2 sat dropped to 66% on nonrebreather.  Her blood
pressure was 190/100, heart rate 140.  The patient was
intubated and transferred to the MICU where she was
aggressively diuresed.  An arterial blood gas on 60% FIO2
revealed her initial pH to be 7.26, 38 and 23.  The patient
was diuresed effectively and on [**10-25**] was extubated.  ON [**10-26**]
she was started on po diuretics and nitrates were titrated
up.  The patient also on admission was treated for a urinary
tract infection with Levaquin times three days.  The
patient's nitrates were titrated up and the patient was
transferred to the floor.

The patient's cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was involved in the case
and felt it was not an ischemic event.  The patient has been
evaluated in the past for renal artery stenosis and believes
that her hypertension was not related to renal artery
stenosis.

Cardiology, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will do an echocardiogram in his office
as an outpatient and he has no plans for catheterization at
this time.  When the patient was transferred to the floor she
improved.  She did not have any problems with shortness of
breath.  She started tolerating a regular diet.  The patient
was back to her normal state of health on [**10-28**] and was
discharged on that date.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Partial small bowel obstruction.
2.  Congestive heart failure exacerbation.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  The patient was put back on her
previous outpatient regimen.

FOLLOW UP PLANS:  The patient is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on
Monday.  The patient will make her appointment on her own.
