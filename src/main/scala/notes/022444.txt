History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 68221**] is a 45 year-old female, active smoker, with a
history of COPD on home oxygen 2L/min, with muliple prior
exacerbations and prior intubation X2, recently discharged from
[**Doctor Last Name 68222**] Hospital for COPD flare, on a Prednisone taper prior
to admission, who was brought in by ambulance on [**2179-7-25**] in PM
for increasing lethargy and confusion.
*
According to her husband, she was discharged on [**2179-7-20**] after
an admission for COPD flare treated with BiPAP, and was
completing a Prednisone taper (initially 120 mg daily, decrease
by 10 mg daily, on 40 mg prior to the current admission),
nebulizers and Cefpodoxime (completed). Over the past 2 days,
she reportedly became increasingly sleepy, with altered mental
status and confusion. No clear complaint of worsening shortness
of breath, no chest pain. EMS was called on [**7-25**], and she was
brought to [**Doctor Last Name 68222**] hospital.
*
Initial vitals on arrival at [**Doctor Last Name 68222**] hospital BP 125/63, HR
111, RR 6, Sat 51% on RA. She was placed on BiPAP 12/5 with FiO2
100%, with subsequent improvement in saturation to 98%. ABG on
BiPAP (no ABG documented on arrival) 7.25/163/113. However, she
became increasingly sleepy, reportedly with worsening acidosis
and persistent hypercarbia, and she was intubated at 18:15
(Etomidate 20 mg, Vecuronium 8 mg, Succinylcholine 120 mg). She
was given Solumedrol 125 mg IV, CTX 1 gm IV, Ativan 2 mg X3, and
Lopressor 5 mg IV. Troponin returned at 0.5, and she was placed
on heparin IV with bolus (4000 units) for presumed NSTEMI.
*
In ED at [**Hospital1 18**], Tmax 100.4. A CTA was obtained, negative for PE
but concerning for a LLL pneumonia. She was admitted to the ICU
for further care.
*


Past Medical History:
1. COPD on home oxygen 2L/min, 2 prior intubations, on
Prednisone for past 2 months or so.

GEN: Obese Caucasian female, in NAD.
HEENT: Anicteric, ETT in place.

Pertinent Results:
Labs at OSH: WBC 14.6, Hb 13.9, Hct 42.3, Plt 191.
Na 146, K 4.4, Cl 78, HCO3 56, BUN 15, Creatinine 0.6.
*
EKG at OSH 12:34: Sinus tachycardia, rate 111 bpm, indeterminate
axis, LAA, no LVH, no ST-T changes, no change versus [**2179-7-17**]
(baseline < 1mm up-sloping ST elevation in II, III, aVF). No Q
waves.
*
EKG 20:09: Different morphology of QRS complex in II, III, aVF
with 1mm ST elevation.
*
EKG 21:59 and 03:28: As above. In latter, ? biphasic T waves in
V3 and V5.
*
RELEVANT IMAGING DATA:
CXR at OSH: Reportedly preliminary read without acute process.
*
[**2179-7-26**] CXR: NG tube in appropriate position. Increased opacity
in LLL consistent with atelectasis versus consolidation.
*
[**2179-7-26**] CTA CHEST: No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Consolidation at the left lung base concerning for pneumonia. No
evidence of pleural effusions. Small bilateral pulmonary nodules
noted. In the absence of malignancy, F/U in three months would
be recommended to document stability.


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 45 year-old female with COPD on home oxygen
therapy, recently discharged from [**Doctor Last Name 68222**] hospital for COPD
flare on Prednisone taper, presenting with hypercarbic
respiratory failure.
*
1) Hypercarbic respiratory failure:
Likely multifactorial, with COPD flare, LLL pneumonia, and
possibly component of obesity/hypoventilation syndrome. She was
intubated at OSH and transferred here for further management.
She was placed on SoluMedrol 125 IV q8, bronchodilator therapy
and treated her PNA with Levaquin given her recent cephalosporin
use.  She self-extubated herself on [**7-27**] and did not require
re-intubation.  She was placed on her home BiPaP settings for
several hours post-extubation, but patient felt more comfortable
on NC and she was transitioned to 4L NC, her home o2
requirement.  Her pCO2 dropped to the 80s, which was felt was
her baseline.  Her o2 level normalized around 60, with a bicarb
of 50.  Compared to her old OSH records, it was felt these
levels were around her baseline.  She was transitioned to PO
prednisone taper, and continued on her nebulizers.  She will
stay on prednisone 60 mg daily for a week after discharge then
stay on 40 mg until she follows up with her PCP/pulmonologist.

*
2) CV:
Troponin reportedly 0.5 at OSH (baseline reference range
unclear), 0.03 here. CK and CK-MB flat, EKG with baseline ST
changes in II, III, aVF. EKGs reviewed with cardiology fellow,
who agrees with above impression.  It was felt that this likely
was not ACS and no escalation in care was required.  A lipid
panel and HgA1c were sent and in normal range.  Patient was
encouraged to follow up with outpatient noninvasive cardiac
testing to r/o CAD.  A TTE obtained showed a nml EF, with no
WMAs, and elevated pulmonary pressures.
*
3) Marked transaminitis
Pt arrived with elevated LFTs, unclear etiology.  DDx ischemic
liver vs APAP toxicity vs Budd-chiari vs fatty liver.  A
stox/utox was (-) for any ingestion, and a RUQ U/S obtained was
(-) for clot with good doppler flow but did show a markedly
fatty liver with ? cirrhosis.  A TTE was obtained that did not
show any R heart failure with congestion.  It was felt that this
was likely due to ischemic (shock) liver and that patient was to
have f/u LFTs once her actue episode resolved to be sure she did
not have any baseline LFT abnormalities that would require any
further w/u as an outpatient.
*
3) FEN: ADAT.
*
4) Ppx: Heparin SC. PPI. Insulin SS given steroid therapy.
