History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness: 65 yo male with new onset Afib in
the past few months admitted to OSH with increasing peripheral
edema and shortness of breath 5 days ago. In the past few days,
weight had increased from 230-239# and he noticed worsening leg
edema to knees with associated orthopnea. He also experienced
left axillary discomfort at the time of presentation, which he
had
never experienced before. Troponins were negative x 2, BNP 600.
He had a TEE which showed EF ~30%(unchanged from 2 months ago),
regional wall motion abnormalities and a ? left atrial appendage
thrombus. He had been on Pradaxa for a month and a half for AF
but had not been taking it for the past 4 days in preparation
for an upcoming colonoscopy. He had a left heart cath on [**5-31**]
which
significant LAD, RCA disease. He was hemodynamically stable over
the weeked and currently denies chest pain/pressure. He is
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for CABG/MAZE evaluation.

Pertinent Results:
[**6-5**] intra-op TEE:  The left atrium is markedly dilated. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed
(LVEF=40%).The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta are normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque
to 35 cm from the incisors. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. There is ischemic
mitral regurgitation with (2+) mitral regurgitation.There is no
pericardial effusion. Right ventricular systolic function is
normal,with 2 + TR
Post
The patient is on a Norepinephrine drip @.15mcg/kg/min
The cardiac index is 3.1
The patient is now s/p a physio 2, 26 mitral ring annuloplasty
with CABGX2
The ring is well seated with no regurgitation and a mean
gradient of 4mmhg across the ring
The Ejection fraction is 50% with no RWMA
There are no dissection flaps visible in the proximal ascending
aorta

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2143-6-5**] where
the patient underwent Coronary bypass grafting times 2:  Left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending coronary;
reverse saphenous vein single graft from the aorta to the distal
right coronary artery. Mitral valve repair with a 26-mm [**Doctor Last Name **]
Physio II ring Annuloplasty. Full left and right-sided Maze
procedure with resection
of left atrial appendage using the AtriCure in bipolar RF device
as well as the CryoCath. Endoscopic right greater saphenous vein
harvesting.

Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  The patient was transferred to the
telemetry floor for further recovery.  Low-dose Beta blocker was
initiated but subsequently held for rate controlled atrial
fibrillation in the 60's.  EP was consulted recommended holding
nodal agents and plan for cardioversion in 1 month if remains in
atrial fibrillation. Dabigatan 150 mg [**Hospital1 **] was restarted
[**2143-6-8**]. Statins and low-dose aspirin were restarted.  The
patient was gently diuresed toward his preoperative weight.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication. Insulin was titrated to maintain blood sugars <
150.  Once tolerating PO's his home diabetic medications were
restarted. The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy
service for assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time
of discharge on POD #5 the patient was ambulating freely, the
wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
The patient was discharged to home with VNA and family on
POD#5in good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.

Of note thoracic surgery was consulted for an incidental 1 cm
Right lower lobe nodule suspicious for primary lung CA.  They
recommended follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient.
