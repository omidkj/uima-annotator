Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH for hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
S/p R ureteral stent placement

History of Present Illness:
39 yo F w/ h/o nephrolithiasis presented to OSH [**12-2**] with R
flank pain associated with n/v/f/c and was found to have stone
in R ureter.  She underwent ureteral stent placement and
postoperately she was developed fever to 102 with rigors. She
rapidly developed hypotension unreponsive to fluids and
eventually requiring pressors.  She also had evidence of DIC,
ARF and respiratory distress requiring NRB mask to keep O2 sats
in mid-90s. She was given cipro, gent, and zosyn, and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further w/u.

Past Medical History:
1. Kidney stone ~4 years ago
2. Depression with psychotic features

Pertinent Results:
[**12-9**] CXR -
1. Removal of endotracheal and nasogatric tubes since the prior
examinations.
2. Progressive consolidation of the left upper lobe or a portion
of it, with air bronchograms, consistent with pneumonic
consolidation.
3. Persistent left lower lobe atelectasis or consolidation with
a small adjacent pleural effusion.
4. Continued patchy infiltrates in the right lung.
5. Considerable improvement in the degree of bilateral
predominantly alveolar diffuse opacities.

CT abd pelvis:
1. Bilateral pleural effusions with some associated bibasilar
atelectasis.

2. Ascites within the peritoneal cavity, in the pelvis and
adjacent to the liver and gallbladder.

3. A right-sided ureteric stent is present, extending from the
right renal pelvis to the bladder. No hydronephrosis identified
bilaterally. A hypodense lesion is seen in the right kidney,
likely representing a renal cyst.

4. There are no discrete focal fluid collections with areas of
rim enhancement to suggest abscesses or othersignificant signs
of infection.

CXR: Improving multifocal pulmonary opacities, most likely due
to provided history of pneumonia and ARDS


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course:

She was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for treatment of sepsis, presumed
urinary source.  She was initially treated with Zosyn and Cipro,
agressive IV hydration and pressor support.  She was intubated
secondary to hypoxic respiratory failure on [**12-4**], felt to be
likely ARDS.  Urology was consulted and requested STU which
revealed a well positioned ureteral stent without hydro or
extravasation of contrast.  She responded to treatment initially
with WBC decreasing from 35.2 at maximum to 14.2 on [**12-6**].  A
urine culture from OSH grew E-coli and abx changed to
ceftriaxone on [**12-5**].  She then spiked a fever to 101.8-102.2 on
[**12-6**] and [**12-7**] and WBC began to rise again.  All [**Hospital1 18**]
cultures, including C-diff remained negative.  Antibiotics
changed to Vanco, Gent, Ceftriaxone to treat possible VAP.  On
[**12-8**], successfully extubated with decreasing O2 requirement.
Currently afebrile, HD stable of pressors, oxygenating well on
2L N/C and awaiting transfer to floor.

1. Respiratory failure - patient extubated on [**12-8**] and doing
well with decreasing O2 requirement.  Remains mildy tachypneic
but comfortable.    Pleural fluid without growth to date. O2 was
weaned over next few days. Ultimately changed to levoquin PO as
wt ct came down. PCP to follow up bld cx.

2. Leukocytosis - WBC rising from 14 on [**12-6**] to 29.9 today with
10% bands yesterday.  Source not entirely clear as blood,
sputum, urine cultures NGTD.  Pneumonia possible.  No diarrhea
to suggest C-Diff. Abx cont and then changed once WBC ct
improved. CXR and UA did not show an explanation for the course.


3. Urosepsis - Ecoli grew in urine culture from OSH.  HD stable
and now afebrile. Recommended cont abx.

4. Nephrolithiasis: pt now with ureteral stent and ? passage of
stone.  Urology following.  Recent Abd CT demonstrates ureteral
stent is in good location with no hydronephrosis, delay in
excretion or extravasation of fluid.  No need for intervention
currently.  Urology f/u as outpt

5. Renal function - back to baseline.

6.  Psychiatry
Pt will be started back on fluoxetine and clozaril now that she
is successfully extubated cont clozaril at 25mg/day and titrate
up to 125 mg per psych with f/u .

7.  Anemia - HCT stable. Will need a repeat diff as outpt.

8. F/E/N - taking good clears now.  Encourage PO diet.  Has had
some vomiting after drinking so monitor for signs of swallow
dysfuncion s/p intubation. Repleted K+

9. Dispo - home afebrile improved
