**********
HPI: Pt is a 79 y/o female with rheumatic heart disease, rapid
atrial-fibrillation, strong smoking history, and COPD who
presents with shortness of breath.  She had a recent admission
for jaw/chest pain where found to have only a 40% proximal LAD
lesion but was noted to be in rapid afib and was discharged on
diltiazem for rate control. She was discharged with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of
hearts monitor.  She was subsuquently seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
cardiology clinic where she was again found to be in rapid
a-fib, with a rate near 150; admission for cardioversion was
discussed at length, but the patient refused, so she was started
on metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **], aspirin, and warfarin.
.
The pt continued to have SOB and palpitations so she sought
further care in [**Hospital1 18**]. The pt denies any chest pain. In the ED,
the pt briefly required non-invasive ventilatory support for the
SOB. CXR showed pulmonary edema. ECG revealed a-fib at
140's-150's with ST depressions v4-v6 and trop leak to 0.24 c/w
demand ischemia. IV dilt was started in the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] cardiology
consultant recs and the pt was transferred to the medicine
floor.
.
On the medicine floor, the telemetry showed a-fib with rates to
150's, with periods of asystole lasting for a couple of seconds,
during which the pt reported dizziness and nausea. The pt was
transferred to the CCU for further monitoring and management.
The plan at the CCU was to place a temporary pacer wire so that
rate control therapy could be safely started once a back-up
rhythm could be guaranteed by the temporary pacer. Venous
cannulation was unable to be acheived at the bedside. However,
during the attempts to place the venous cannula, the pt
converted to sinus rhythm at 70-80 bpm.

Echo [**2124-8-29**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is moderate aortic valve
stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**12-26**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The mitral
valve shows characteristic rheumatic deformity. There is
moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae. There is a
minimally increased gradient consistent with trivial
mitral stenosis. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study (tape
reviewed) of [**2124-5-9**], the severity of mitral regurgitation has
increased and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is higher. The transaortic valve gradient is also increased.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 79 yo F with valvular heart failure AS area 1.0 gradient
22, MS area 2.0 gradient 8, 3+AI, 2+MR, COPD and rapid AFib,
presenting with SOB/CHF exacerbation. The pt was found to be in
rapid A-fib on admission, developed long symptomatic ventricular
pauses with rate control therapy, pacemaker was placed
successfully in order to safely rate control.
.
# Rhythm:
The pt described symptoms of increased fatigue and SOB on
admission. She was noted to be in rapid Afib. She was initially
rate controlled with dilt and metoprolol on the medicine floor.
However, the pt was noted on the telemetry to have periods of
[**4-28**] seconds of asysole, during which she felt light-headed and
nauseous. The pt was transferred to the CCU for more intensive
monitoring. Attempted placement of catheter for temporary pacer
was not successful, though pt converted to NSR. The pt was
counseled regarding the benefits of permanent pacemaker so that
the heart rhythm could be more successfully controlled, and she
was amenable to this solution. The device was implanted
successfully without complications. In terms of medical therapy
Amiodarone for rate control and to attempt maintenence of sinus
rhtyhm. For medical therapy, beta blocker and digoxin were used
for rate control. Amiodarone was added to maintain sinus rhythm,
but was later discontued after the pt developed symptoms of
mental status changes which may have been at least partly
exacerbated by the amio. Anti-coagulation for stroke prophylaxis
was pursued with coumadin with a heparin bridge.
.
2. CHF:
Pt was initially found to be in acute CHF with pulmonary edema
on CXR and increased O2 needs. This was assessed to be [**1-26**] a-fib
with RVR in setting of significant valvular heart disease. Pt
had low bp 90-120/40-50, when she was in rapid a-fib and on
several BP meds, isordil, lisinopril 40, lasix 100 IV. The pt
was diuresed gently and gradually brought to euvolemic state
with medical therapy. Echo was repeated to evaluate for any
changes since the previous echo in may and revealed no
significant changes.
.
3 CAD:
The pt did have a slight troponin elevation which peaked at
0.24. This was likely secondary to demand ischemia in setting of
rapid AFib and low BP that she had on HD#1. The were so symptoms
of anginal pain. No area at risk per cath [**2124-8-3**]. ASA, plavix,
lipitor were continued.
.
4. Mental status changes:
In the post-operative setting, after the device was placed, the
pt devloped symptoms of acute delirium. She had fluctuating
levels of consciousness as well as some agitation, particulalrly
developing at night. The delirium was thought to be [**1-26**] to
post-operative setting, multiple medications including opiates,
benzodiazepines, amiodarone, as well as a tenuous baseline
status. The medication regimen was simplified and over the
subsequent couple of days, the pt returned to her baseline
mental status.
.
5. FEN: Na-restricted diet, fluid restriction.
