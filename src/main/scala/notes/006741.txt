Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5552**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath with Increased Oxygen Requirement

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Intubation
2. Red blood cell transfusion
3. Chemotherapy treatment with irinotecan.


History of Present Illness:
Briefly, patient is 67 year old female with known history of
sigmoid colon adenocarcinoma and sarcoidosis, who presents to
the hospital for worsening shortness of breath and increased
oxygen demand.
.
She relates that Sunday night, she awoke from sleep feeling more
short of breath. She usually wears 1.5 L Ox at home, and turned
her oxygen up to 4L and then felt comfortable. She had no other
symptoms at that time--no [**First Name3 (LF) **], fever, chills, night sweats,
chest pain, palpitations.
.
She has kept her oxygen at 4L, and knew she would follow up at
clinic yesterday, at which time her oxygen saturation was 88% on
3L. She was sent to the ED, where a CTA was negative for PE, but
did show increased grown opacification.
.
ROS: Negative for fever, chills, rigors, night sweats, chest
pain, palpitations, N/V/D. Patient reported one episode of
diarrhea one week ago. No PND, orthopnea, no weight changes. Leg
swelling is chronic and unchanged. No increase in abdominal
girth. No bone or joint pain, skin changes, rashes.  No sick
contacts. [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) **] or sputum.

comfortably, in no apparent distress
Neck: Supple, no jvd, no LAD
Cardiac: RRR, nl S1, S2, no m/r/g
Lungs: good air entry and movement, scattered bilateral mild
rhonchi, no wheezes, rales, no dullness to percussion
Abdomen: soft, NT, ND, +BS, no HSM appreciated.
Extr: trace edema bilaterally, no clubbing/cyanosis
Neuro: A&Ox3, no focal findings
Psych: Appropriate

Pertinent Results:
CXR:
Diffuse fibrotic changes secondary to sarcoid without
superimposed acute cardiopulmonary process. No lesions worrisome
for metastatic spread.
.
CT chest:
1.  New, diffuse ground-glass opacities with multifocal areas of
more confluent opacities. Findings are non-specific and
diagnostic considerations include pulmonary edema, pulmonary
hemorrhage, or possibly infection.
2.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
3.  Fibrosis, traction bronchiectasis, hilar and paraaortic
lymph nodes consistent with known sarcoidosis again seen, not
significantly changed from prior.
4.  Evidence of pulmonary arterial hypertension.
[**2176-10-10**]: ECHO
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%) There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the findings of the prior report (images
unavailable for review) of [**2174-2-21**], moderate pulmonary
hypertension is now evident. The tricuspid regurgitation is
increased.

ADMISSION LABS:

Brief Hospital Course:
67 yo female with pulmonary sarcoidosis, and known history of
stage IV sigmoid colon [**Hospital 97993**] transferred from oncology floor
for CPAP due to hypoxia and increased carbon dioxide by ABG.
Patient initially presented to hospital from clinic for hypoxia.

.
1) Respiratory Distress
.
Patient was admitted for respiratory distress and hypoxia. She
received a CTA out of concern for pulmonary embolism.  The CTA
was negative for pulmonary embolism, but demonstrated bilateral
focal area of ground glass opacification. Patient low grade
temperature on arrival to floor, and given CTA findings the
oncology team initiated coverage for community acquired and
atypical PNA. Echo showed no signs of heart failure or strained
right ventricle, therefore, heart failure was not thought to be
a significant contributing factor. The patient's respiratory
status did not improve and she spiked a temperature > 101.  At
this time pulmonary was consulted and broad spectrum antibiotic
therapy was initiated with Vancomycin, Aztreonam, Levofloxacin
and Pentamidine.  The patient continued to have respiratory
decline on [**10-10**] 9.32/75/51, then [**10-11**] 7.27/82/82.  MICU was
called to evaluate and the patient was felt to have increasing
mental confusion, increased fatigue, increased work of
breathing, tachypnea (to 40s) and increasing hypercarbia.
Patient was transferred to the MICU for CPAP and further
work-up.
.
Upon Arrival to MICU, patient was placed on CPAP with no
appreciable change in mental status, but slight decrease in
tachypnea to 30s. Repeat gas after an hour on CPAP
(10/5/100%O2)revealed 7.23/88/99. Given patient's clinical
picture it was felt that intubation was necessary. Patient was
intubated for hypercarbia.
.
MICU reviewed patient's rapid decline in pulmonary status and
felt it was likely due to infection vs congestive heart failure
vs pneumonitis based on new bilateral ground glass opacity by
CT.  Unlikely congestive heart failure as patient with nl ECHO,
no signs of RV overload, only moderate pulm HTN, proBNP 1214.
Irinotecan can cause interstitial lung disease, last dose was
[**9-24**]; however, more concerned that fever, new infilatate
represents pulmonary infection.  She was continued on
Vancomycin, Aztreonam, Levofloxacin and Pentamidine. Increased
patient's steroids to treat possible PJP. Initial concern for
ARDS as pt initally required high platuea pressures > 30;
however, ARDSnet protocol was started and tidal volumes
decreased. The patient tolerated this intervention very well and
her platuea pressures decreased while her ventilation improved.
.
Patient was successfully extubated. Sputum from BAL remains
negative including for PJP. All blood cultures remain negative.

.
She completed a 10 day course of antibiotics with vancomycin and
levofloxacin. She also was started on increased doses of
steroids and tapered back to her home dose at time of discharge,
to assist with any inflammatory component. Outpatient follow up
with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], her pulmonologist at [**Hospital1 2177**], was also
coordinated. She continued her home medication of revatio for
pulmonary hypertension. She was discharged on 2 L of nasal
cannula, and may benefit from outpatient consult for sleep study
(patient was noted to need more oxygen at night and reason for
intubation was hypercarbia, so she could potentially benefit
from CPAP, although her oxygen saturations stabalized during her
stay).
.
#) Acute Renal Failure: Patient developed acute renal failure,
thought to be secondary to hypotension as w
