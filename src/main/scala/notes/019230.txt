Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
PEA Arrest


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Extubation
PA catheter placement and removal
Cardiac catheterization x2 with stents to Left Anterior
Descending and Right Coronary Arteries


History of Present Illness:
This is a 80y.o F with a PMH of ESRD on HD, CVA, diastolic CHF
now admitted after PEA arrest. The patient presented to the ER
with complaints of nausea/emesis and diarrhea for three days.
Reported she was unable to tolerate po intake and felt weak and
lethargic. She denied abd pain. Reported fever intermittently.
Last HD on friday.

The patient denies any chest pain or pressure, new exertional
dyspnea, orthopnea, PND or leg edema, palpitations or syncope,
claudication-type symptoms, melena, rectal bleeding, or
transient neurologic deficits.  No change in weight, bowel habit
or urinary symptoms. No cough, night sweats, arthralgias,
myalgias, headache or rash.  All other review of systems
negative.

In the ED, initial vitals were T: 98.2 HR: 77 BP: 136/56 RR: 20
O2Sat: 100% RA. Vancomycin 1gm and zosyn given. The patient then
became unresponsive and was found to be pulseless. CPR was
begun. Pt  was intubated. She received epi 1mg IV, atropine 1mg
IV, Bicarb 1 amp IV, Calcium chloride 1amp IV, followed by
second round of epi/atropine with return of spontaneous
circulation after approx 8 minutes. She was them given versed
2mg IV for sedation and a R femoral line and NGT were placed.
The artic sun was placed. She was plavix loaded with 300mg,
given ASA 600mg PR. 30g kayexelate given. Head CT showed no
acute process but evidence of chronic microvascular ischemic
disease. CT A/P with no acute intaabdominal process but
bilateral pulmonary infiltrates concerning for PNA or
aspiration. CE returned elevated with CK 452 MB 44 MBI 9.7 and
Troponin 3.74. ABG 7.21/54/203/23. She was taken urgently to the
cath lab.

Cardiac catheterization revealed LAD with 80% mid stenosis, RCA
with 70% proximal, 90% distal - both stented with 0% residual.
Severe bilateral iliac stenosis. She was given 200mg IV lasix
and NTG to reduce PCWP from 45mmg Hg to 40mg Hg and mean PA from
46 to 40mm Hg.  CO 5.4, CI 3.1. The artic sun protocol was not
continued given duration of patient's arrest and her return of
spontaneous movement post cath.

The patient is now transferred to the CCU for further managment.
On arrival to the CCU, dialysis was instituted.

Cardiac catherization [**2145-2-14**]
COMMENTS: Successful PTCA and stenting of RCA with a 2.5x15mm
and a 3.0x15mm Vision stents. Final angiography revealed no
residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and
TIMI III flow (See PTCA comments).
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal ventricular function.
3. Successful stenting of the RCA.

EKG [**2145-2-14**]- Normal sinus rhythm, rate 102. Right
bundle-branch block. Significant ST segment depression in leads
V2-V6 is less prominent than was true during the tachycardia
noted in tracing #2.

[**2145-2-14**]
CT abdomen/pelvis - IMPRESSION:
1. New bilateral consolidative changes at the bases are
concerning for
multifocal pneumonia or aspiration.
2. Pneumobilia has decreased since the prior exam. Stable
dilated common bile duct and pancreatic atrophy.

[**2145-2-14**]- CT head - IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathology
including no hemorrhage or mass effect. Stable chronic
microvascular infarction.

Echo - The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild to moderate regiona
