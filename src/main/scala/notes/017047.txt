Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1115**]
Chief Complaint:
Left proximal femoral periprosthetic intertrochanteric fracture

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 94553**] is a Russian-speaking [**Age over 90 **] yo male w/ h/o CAD and
critical AS, 1+ MR, EF of 55%, CAD s/p MI, DM2 not on insulin,
COPD, h/o PE post-op here s/p fall onto his L hip and determined
to have a non-operative L periprosthetic hip fracture.
.
He was in his prior state of health until today early in the
morning when he tried to get out of bed and bent over to get
something in the floor and fell towards his left side. He did
not trip and reports "losing his balance". He did not hit his
head or lose consciousness and denies any dizziness or chest
pain around the episode.
.
In the ED his vital signs were: T 99.4 F, HR 84, BP 106/63, RR
18, SpO2 97% on RA. He look in pain and it improved without any
medication. He was thought to be euvolemic. X-rays of the left
hip appear to show a new fracture in the greater trochanter. He
was initially to be admitted to ortho who requested med-consult
for pre-op eval. On exam he had rales and given his AS, it was
decided to admit to medicine for optimization of active medical
issues.
.
Orthostatics in ED:
Sitting: 98/58, 76
Supine: 100/65, 81
.
The patient at baseline is not very active; however he is able
to ambulate 2 flight of stairs without getting SOB. At baseline,
he does short walks of [**1-11**] blocks. Denies any history of chest
pain and denies any shortness of breath, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. There is no recent fevers, chills or
rigors. There is no exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

III. Radiology

A. Hip (unilat 2 view) [**2184-3-22**]
IMPRESSION:
Findings concerning for a left proximal femoral periprosthetic
intertrochanteric fracture.
Moderate degenerative joint changes of the left hip, lower
lumbar spine
and the left knee.

B. Femur [**2184-3-22**]
Findings concerning for a left proximal femoral periprosthetic
intertrochanteric fracture. Moderate degenerative joint changes
of the left hip, lower lumbar spine and the left knee.

C. CXR [**2184-3-22**]
1. Prominence of the pulmonary vasculature, compatible with
increasing
pulmonary venous pressure.

2. No distinct rib fracture is identified; In the setting of
high clinical
suspicion for a fracture, dedicated rib series can be obtained.

3. Moderate cardiomegaly, stable.

D. Left Humerus
STUDY: Three views of the left shoulder [**2184-3-29**].

COMPARISON: [**2182-3-21**].

INDICATION: Question fracture.

FINDINGS: The visualized left lung and ribs are unremarkable.
Mild AC joint degenerative changes with joint space narrowing
and mild sclerosis and tiny
osteophytes. Glenohumeral joint space narrowing with likely
inferior
osteophytes, not well visualized. Posttraumatic deformity of the
humerus
diaphysis with interval increase in bony bridging and bony
remodeling. No
definite acute fractures. No dislocation.

IMPRESSION:
1. No definite acute fracture.
2. Posttraumatic deformity of the left humerus.

E. CTA Chest
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism seen.
2. Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.
3. Multifocal bilateral consolidation involving both upper and
lower lobes
may represent multifocal pneumonia versus alveolar edema.
Clinical
correlation recommended.
4. Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions.

IV. Cardiology

A. EKG
Cardiology Report	ECG	Study Date of [**2184-3-22**]  6:31:00 PM

Sinus rhythm. Left ventricular hypertrophy. Diffuse T wave
changes which are non-specific. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2181-8-15**] there is no
significant diagnostic change.

B. ECHO ([**2184-3-29**])
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left ventricular cavity
size is top normal/borderline dilated. There is moderate global
left ventricular hypokinesis. Quantitative (biplane) LVEF = 36
%. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(AoVA <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen directed
toward the anterior mitral leaflet. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
