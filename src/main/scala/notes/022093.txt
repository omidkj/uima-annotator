[**5-22**] CT A/P: Moderate amount of free air in the abdomen likely
due to perforated acute sigmoid diverticulitis. No CT evidence
of duodenal perforation. Gallstones and a distended gallbladder.
Small amount of fluid in the right colic gutter. Severe
atherosclerotic disease of the aorta and its main branches with
a small left kidney secondary to renal artery stenosis. There is
also severe atherosclerotic disease at the origin of the SMA and
celiac. However, these vessels are still patent. Large cystic
mass within the right ovary. Further evaluation is necessary
with pelvic ultrasound to exclude an ovarian malignancy

[**5-22**] KUB: Pneumoperitoneum

[**5-23**] ECHO: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.

[**5-26**] UGI: No evidence of extravasation of contrast on this study
which visualizes through to the second portion of the duodenum

[**5-26**] KUB: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.

[**5-28**] CT Abd/Pelvis: Large pelvic abscess adjacent to the distal
sigmoid colon. Sigmoid diverticulosis is also present. This
likely represents a complication of sigmoid diverticulitis.
2. Small exophytic cyst in the interpolar region of the right
kidney which measures 27 Hounsfield units. This should be
further evaluated with ultrasound or MR since it does not show
typical characteristics of a simple cyst.
3. Distended gallbladder with a small calcified stone in the
neck.
4. Atrophic left kidney likely secondary to renal artery
stenosis.
5. Severe atherosclerotic disease of the aorta and its main
abdominal branches

[**5-29**] CT Guided Drainage-Approximately 20 cc of bloody pus-like
fluid was aspirated and sent to the lab for Gram stain and
culture. The remainder of the fluid was left in the drainage
bag.Successful placement of 8-French pigtail catheter drain
within the right pelvic fluid collection.

[**5-31**] CT A/P: Catheter within the pelvic abscess, which is smaller
than on the prior study. Persistent stranding in the region of
this abscess. No evidence of free intraperitoneal air at this
time.
2. Bilateral small pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis. Opacity in the left base not seen on the prior
studies is likely inflammatory in nature.
3. Hypodensity in the dome of the liver is too small to
characterize.
4. Hypodensity in the right kidney is not clearly a simple fluid
attenuation and could be followed up with ultrasound.
5. Extensive atherosclerosis of the abdominal aorta and its
branches

[**6-5**] CT A/P:Relatively unchanged size of complex right pelvic
collection intimately associated with small bowel, the right
ovary, and the rectum. Drainage catheter is slightly pulled
posteriorly, but still appears to be within the collection.
Contrast material and gas tracking from the sigmoid colon to the
inferior aspect of this collection suggests continued connection
with the sigmoid colon to some portions of this collection.
Correlation with catheter output is recommended to decide
management of this drainage catheter.
2. Decrease size of pleural effusions with only minimal lung
base atelectasis

[**6-8**]: Coronary Angiography: was performed in multiple
projections using a 6 French JL4 and a 6 French JR4 catheter,
with manual contrast injections.
Percutaneous coronary revascularization was performed using
balloon
angioplasty. Peripheral Catheter placement was performed:
Pigtail catheter was used to perform abdominal and iliac
angiography. Peripheral Imaging was performed of the abdominal
aorta and the iliac vessels.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted to surgical service on [**2158-5-22**] following PE
findings of distended mildly tender abdomen that demonstrated
rebound but no guarding and radiological studies showing
findings of free air.  She was initially transferred to the SICU
for serial abdominal exams and conservative management based on
her multiple comorbidities.

GEN: Patient originally febrile to 101.3 in [**Hospital1 18**] ED but
defervesced at time of SICU acceptance. Remained afebrile until
low grade fever of 101 on HD4, and fever of 101.7 on HD5 for
which she was pan-cultured. Patient transferred to regular
surgical floor on HD4 following ICU stabilization and resolution
of tachypnea on [**5-24**].

NEURO: Patient had dilaudid pain control on admission, but had
at home fentanyl patch resumed while hospitalized. Patient
required little additional pain control

CV: Patient aggressively resuscitated with 6L of crystalloid on
presentation to hospital [**1-26**] hypotension (SBP in 70-80's and
tachy into 110-120), and had A-line and CVL placed.  Patient
monitored for new-onset afib, which converted to SR following
volume resuscitation.  Patient ruled in on cardiac enzymes for
MI. Cardiology was consulted and recommended continued ASA
therapy, initiation of lopressor, and careful volume management
(cardiac cath at some future time).  Patient maintained stable
blood pressure throughout remainder of ICU and surgical floor
stay.  Patient noted to enter into Afib on morning of HD7 that
could not be rate-controlled after 4x 5mg IV lopressor and 10mg
of IV diltiazem. The patient was transferred to the VICU on HD7
and placed on dilt gtt converting 4-5 hours after initiation.
The patient was transitione
