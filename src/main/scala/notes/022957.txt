Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5790**]
Chief Complaint:
tracheobronchial malacia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right thoracotomy for tracheoplasty
bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1924**] [**Known lastname 77316**] is a 35-year-
old woman who has had history of asthma and recurrent
pulmonary infections. These have been worsening over time.
She underwent evaluation by an outside pulmonologist who
placed a tracheal bronchial Y stent. After placement of this
her symptomatology improved markedly. The Y stent had been
placed for some mild tracheobronchomalacia as evidenced by
dynamic maneuvers. Unfortunately Ms. [**Known lastname 1924**] [**Known lastname 77316**] suffered a
fungal infection of the stent and required removal and
several weeks of antifungal therapy. We performed a repeat
bronchoscopy with dynamic maneuvers here and she was found to
have some distal tracheal malacia as well as left greater
than right mainstem malacia. Because of her symptomatic
relief with the stent but the intolerance to the stent, in
terms of the complication of fungal infection, we thought the
long-term option of chronic stent placement was not a good
one and thus we discussed the risks and benefits of moving
towards a surgical tracheobronchoplasty in order to reform
the airway and prevent collapse with forced exhalation.
