ECHO [**2128-8-10**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20
%). The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with
moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The pulmonic valve leaflets are thickened with
restricted leaflet motion or systolic doming. No pulmonic
stenosis is appreciated. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is
seen. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2128-5-18**],
the right ventricle now appears dilated and hypokinetic. The
other findings are similar.

CT ABD/PELVIS [**2128-8-9**]:  1. Limited study demonstrates diffuse and
extensive anasarca, ascites. 2. Large bilateral pleural
effusions, with associated atelectasis. 3. Interval decrease in
left-sided retroperitoneal fluid collection, without visible
internal loculat
