History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 54 year old male with DMII, CAD, and HTN who
presented to an OSH after a witnessed seizure. The morning of
admission, the patient was found by his wife to have a
generalized tonic-clonic seizure with urinary incontinence. The
patient received Valium by EMS and was transported to an outside
hopsital. There, a head CT was negative and the patient then
complained of [**6-5**] SSCP with ?lateral ST changes and received
SLNTG x3 and a heparin bolus. As a result, the physicians at the
outside hospital contact[**Name (NI) **] [**Hospital1 18**] for ?emergent cath and the
patient was sent directly to the cath lab. In the cath lab, the
patient was noted to be febrile to 103.8 and had a witnessed GTC
seizure, then became obtunded and was emergently intubated with
SBPs in 250s. Sedative meds caused a drop in MAPs to 40s, on and
off levophed. Neurology was consulted, dilantin loaded, and the
patient was given ceftriaxone and transferred to the MICU.
According to his wife, the patient had no sick contacts and felt
well on the day prior to admission with no mental status
changes, myalgias/arthralgias.  In the MICU, he was presumed to
have pneumococcal meningitis (HSV negative) with ?temporal lobe
involvement. The patient completed a 2 week course of
ceftriaxone on [**2192-2-13**]. In addition, the patient was found to
have a MRSA aspiration pneumonia and was treated with linezolid
for a total of a 3 week course. When in the MICU, the patient
developed a perioral HSV rash and was treated with acyclovir
(last dose on [**2-13**]) and post-extubation, had new delirium and
elevated LFTS that were new since admission. He was then
transferred to the floor on [**2192-2-13**].

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 54 year old male with presumed pneumococcal
meningitis s/p seizures now with delirium status post extubation
and transaminitis of unclear etiology.

1. Pneumococcal meningitis
- The patient completed a 14 day course of CTX on [**2192-2-13**]. He
was presumed to have pneumococcal meningitis although no
organism grew on CSF culture secondary to a high grade
pneumococcal bacteremia noticed at an outside hospital.
- The etiology of his pneumococcal meningitis is unclear. The CT
of his head had shown pansinusitis and further imaging showed no
temporal bone involvement. After his transfer to the floor, ENT
was consulted to comment on his pansinusitis and whether this
may have been the nidus for infection. However, they stated that
by the time he was transferred out of the MICU, he did not
appear to have clinical sinusitis on physical exam with clear
tympanic membranes and nares and there was nothing to drain or
to do differently in management. They were unable to comment on
whether his pansinusitis may have contributed to his presenting
symptoms as they only saw the patient after he had been treated
for his pneumococcal meningitis and his symptoms had resolved.

2. MRSA pneumonia
- The patient was maintained on Linezolid for a total of a 3
week course which he was to continue as an outpatient for 17
more days since discharge.
- His O2 sats were in the high 90s upon discharge on room air.

3. Delirium
- Neurology was consulted to see the patient. On exam, the
patient at first appeared to be weaker in his right lower
extremity in the MICU, however, a CT of the head showed no
intracranial abnormality except for pansinusitis. The patient
was intended to receive an MRI of the head, however, his
symptoms greatly improved before the study could be performed.
- It was felt that the patient's delirium was more consistent
with a toxic metabolic picture in the setting of pneumococcal
meningitis. His ammonia level was normal. He was initially
monitored with a 1:1 sitter but this was discontinued as he did
not exhibit any unusual, erratic behavior after being
transferred out of the MICU.
