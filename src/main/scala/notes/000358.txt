Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 56 yo female with history of COPD, s/p tracheostomy,
anxiety/depression with suspected tracheobronchomalacia being
evaluated for tracheal stent.
.
## Failure to Wean from Vent: Bronchoscopy by interventional
pulmonology showed severe laryngeal stenosis and edema involving
the supraglottic and subglottic region. There was only a mild
degree of tracheobronchomalacia but no airway
obstruction,significant amount of secretions or other
endobronchial lesions. Interventional pulmonology did not feel
there was significant airway pathology to explain the patient's
failure to wean off the ventilator. They also felt that given
the degree of laryngeal edema and stenosis it is unlikely she
will ever decannulate. It is suggested she begin a PPI [**Hospital1 **] and
head of the bed elevated.
.
## COPD: Patient wheezy with reduced air movement on admission.
She was started on a prednisone taper 40mg daily which we
suggest continuing until [**2128-5-12**]. Continued on outpatient regimen
of theophylline, fluticasone, ipratropium/albuterol, alb PRN. A
theophylline level was checked and was 5.6.
.
## HTN: BP remained stable. She was continued on amlodipine and
metoprolol
.
## Depression/Anxiety: Continued on paroxetine, abilify, ativan.
Given significant anxiety would consider uptitrating paroxetine
and having her see a psychopharmacologist for management of this
condition.
.
## Contraction Alkalosis: Patient will contraction alkalosis on
admission. Furosemide reduced from 80mg [**Hospital1 **] to 80mg daily.

Patient was a full code on this admission.
