Date of Birth:   [**2131-3-11**]     Sex:  M

Service:  Medical Intensive Care Unit

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Respiratory failure.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 60-year-old male with
a history of metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer admitted
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for respiratory failure.

The patient went to his primary care physician complaining of
slight dyspnea on [**6-23**].  Chest x-ray revealed a right lung
white out.  The patient was started azithromycin and 2 liters
of permanent oxygen on [**6-24**].  The patient continued to feel
progressively more dyspneic at home with increasing oxygen
settings.  He had increasing shortness of breath and cough
with green sputum.  No fevers, chest pain, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, or abdominal pain at home.

The patient went to the Emergency Department with shortness
of breath where he desaturated to 88% on 100% nonrebreather.
Arterial blood gas was checked and was found to be 7.4/44/63.
The patient was electively intubated for what was felt to be
impending respiratory failure.  The patient was given
antibiotics, Lasix, nebulizer treatments.  A bedside
echocardiogram was performed which reportedly showed no
pericardial effusion.

The patient went to computed tomography angiogram which
showed severe bilateral pneumonia versus heart failure versus
worsening cancer and was brought up to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit for further treatment.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer diagnosed in [**2190-7-26**]; status post multiple chemotherapy regimens and
pleurodesis.
2.  Coronary artery disease.
3.  Ventricular tachycardia.
4.  Chronic right lower extremity scarring.
5.  Increased cholesterol.
6.  Hypertension.
7.  Positive purified protein derivative.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
 1.  Flexeril 10-mg tablets one to three tablets p.o. once
per day.
 2.  Vioxx 50 mg p.o. once per day.
 3.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 40 mg p.o. q.p.m.
 4.  Coumadin 1 mg p.o. every other day.
 5.  Metoprolol 100 mg p.o. twice per day
 6.  Digitek 0.125 mg p.o. once per day.
 7.  Benzonatate 100 mg p.o. as needed (for cough).
 8.  Azithromycin 250 mg p.o. (day [**4-30**]).
 9.  Percocet p.o. as needed.
10.  Intrathecal morphine pump.

ALLERGIES:  SKELAXIN (leads to body spasms).

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Immigrated from [**Country 1684**] in [**2146**].  A
20-pack-year history of tobacco; he quit 20 years ago.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient received Lasix 40
mg with urine output of 600 cc.  The patient received
albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers and 1 g of ceftriaxone
intravenously.  The patient was electively intubated for
worsening shortness of breath.  Propofol was used for
sedation.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed temperature was 99.2, heart rate was 98 to 101,
blood pressure was 80s/50s, and respiratory rate was 25 to
29.  In general, intubated and sedated large male.  Head
revealed alopecic.  Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to
light.  Neck examination revealed no jugular venous
distention.  No bruits.  Cardiovascular examination revealed
a muffled first heart sounds and second heart sounds.
Pulmonary examination revealed loud rales and bronchial
breath sounds bilaterally.  The abdomen was obese, soft, and
nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.  Extremity examination
revealed 2+ pitting edema in the bilateral lower extremities;
right greater than left.  The left foot was cool.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory
studies revealed white blood cell count was 15.3 (with 83%
neutrophils, 1% bands, and 7% lymphocytes), hematocrit was
27.5, mean cell volume was 90, and platelets were 164.  INR
was 1.8.  Urinalysis revealed trace ketones; otherwise
negative.  Chemistry-7 was within normal limits.  Anion gap
was 11.  Arterial blood gas revealed 7.4/46/82 on 80% oxygen.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed
sinus tachycardia at 117 beats per minute.  Normal axis.
Normal thrills.  T wave flattening in leads II, III, and V4
through V6.  No other ST-T wave changes.  T wave flattening
in prior electrocardiogram of [**2191-3-12**].

A chest x-ray showed a large right consolidation; unchanged
from prior study.

A preliminary read of computed tomography angiogram revealed
endotracheal tube in good position, artifacts, severe
bilateral pneumonia versus cardiac failure, large pulmonary
masses were present.

IMPRESSION:  This is a 60-year-old male with non-small-cell
lung cancer with hypoxemia and respiratory failure, status
post elective intubation.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  RESPIRATORY FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient's respiratory
failure was felt to be due to his non-small-cell lung cancer
complicated by a postobstructive bilateral pneumonia leading
to increasing oxygen requirements and inability to oxygenate
effectively.  The patient required increasing amounts of
ventilatory support.

A family meeting was called where the patient's grim
prognosis was discussed, and the decision was made to
withdraw care and to make the patient comfortable.  The
patient was maintained on a propofol drip and was started on
a morphine drip with Ativan boluses as needed.

The decision was made to withdraw ventilatory support, and
the patient expired shortly afterwards.

2.  COMMUNICATION ISSUES:  The [**Hospital 228**] health care plans
were discussed with the patient's wife, three sons, and
daughter.  The patient's oncologist was contact[**Name (NI) **] who agreed
with the plan.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Non-small-cell lung cancer.
2.  Respiratory failure.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Expired.
