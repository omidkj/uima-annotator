HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known firstname 13624**] [**Known lastname 807**] is an
82-year-old gentleman, former physician at this institution.
He has a known history of Alzheimer's disease, hypertension,
non-Q-wave MI, atrial fibrillation, CHF and hyperthyroidism.
The patient presented on the day of admission with new onset
of right-sided weakness and dysarthria.  He has been followed
in the Department of Behavioral Neurology for memory
difficulties and Alzheimer's disease.  But, he was apparently
at his baseline, which was talking and unable to be somewhat
minimally responsive until the morning of admission.  His
health aid heard a thump and saw that Dr. [**Known lastname 807**] has fallen
to the floor.  He appeared weak on the right.  Speech was
unintelligible.  By the time of the EMTs arrived, his speech
was intelligible.  He appeared to be gaining strength in his
right arm.  However, upon arrival to the ED, he was again
weak in the right upper extremity and speech was
unintelligible.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  History was as above.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Aricept 10.
2.  Aspirin 81.
3.  Nitroglycerin p.r.n.
4.  Sertraline 150.
5.  Lasix 40.
6.  Amiodarone 200.
7.  Synthroid 125 mcg.
8.  Potassium 20 mEq.
9.  Vitamin E.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a retired pediatrician and he
does not smoke or drink.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, the patient's blood
pressure was 180/100, heart rate 70.  GENERAL:  Head and neck
examination were normal except for some blood on the outside
of the right ear.  Neck showed no carotid bruits.  Heart
revealed regular rate and rhythm.  Lungs were clear.  Abdomen
was benign.  Extremities were warm without edema.
Neurological examination revealed that the patient awake, but
drowsy.  Speech is unintelligible and dysarthric.  He could
repeat very simple words, but no sentences.  He could not
read or name.  He could follow some simple midline commands.
When asked to do things with the right side, he would do the
same thing with the left side and he was unable to move the
right side at all.  Cranial nerve examination revealed pupils
equal and reactive.  There is decreased blink to threat on
the right, but this was unreliable.  Extraocular muscles are
intact without nystagmus.  There was no RAPD.  There was a
right facial droop with decreased excursion.  On motor
examination, bulk was normal.  He had decreased tone in the
right upper extremity.  Formal strength test was difficult,
but it appeared full on the left.  On the right, he had [**2-26**]
at the deltoid, triceps, and possibly [**12-29**] at the finger
extensors.  The right lower extremity was able to move
spontaneously.  Reflexes were brisk on the right upper
extremity, compared to the left.  The right toe was upgoing.
The left toe was down.  He appeared to respond less to pain
in the right upper extremity.

The MRI, with diffusion-light imaging was done.  This showed
two areas of restrictive diffusion in the posterior portion
and in the posterior-superior region of the temporal lobe.
There were no areas of abnormal susceptibility.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for observation to
the ICU.  His blood pressure was controlled.  He was given
IVTPA, but showed no real improvement.  He did not require
intubation.  He was transferred to the floor on [**2184-11-5**].
Repeat CT scan showed no evidence of bleed.  Aspirin was
restarted.  The possibility of anticoagulation given with a
past medical history of atrial fibrillation was discussed
with the PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) 2772**], the PCP felt that because of his
concomitant medical problems, as well as the fact that he had
only had intermittent trouble with atrial fibrillation in the
past, this was not something that he would recommend.  He did
not improve much at all over the course of the next few days.
Departments of Physical Therapy and Speech Therapy
consultations were obtained; results of which are still
pending at this time.  His blood pressure was somewhat
labile, ranging from the 120s to the 180s, close to the
previous antihypertensive dose.  Lopressor was added for
improved control and also because his heart rate tended to be
elevated.  The remainder of the hospital course will be
included in the discharge summary addendum.
