History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 104086**] is a 54-year old Spanish-speaking Ecuadorian lady
who was transferred from [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital for necrotizing
pancreatitis.  She initially presented there on [**12-21**] with severe
mid-abdominal pain, associated with vomiting and one epiosde of
diarrhea. In the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] abdominal CT showed gallstones and an
ill-defined pancreas with peripancreatic fluid. Amylase was 4916
and lipase was >[**2129**]. She was kept NPO with IVF with IV pain
control with dilaudid, but it was never fully controlled. WBC
peaked at 18, but she was never febrile.  No antibiotics were
given as the OSH. Repeat CT scan 2 days later showed pancreatic
necrosis in the pancreatic head as well as a PV and SMV
thrombus. At that point imipenem, levofloxacin, and flagyl were
started and GI was consulted and recommended transfer for
surgical consultation. However, she needed to be transferred
into the ICU for oversedation from dilaudid, responded to
narcan. Overnight had several episodes of desaturation requiring
BiPAP. Came off of BiPAP at 1AM the morning of transfer to the
floor.

Currently, she feels worse with increased back pain, but
otherwise states her breathing is stable.  Has abdominal pain,
but controlled on medication.  Is frustrated with her feeding
tube that is in place.  Has some mild shortness of breath, but
feels better with supplemental oxygen.

Past Medical History:
Anxiety
GERD


Social History:
Denies alcohol, tobacco or IVDU. Currently unemployed She lives
at home in [**Doctor Last Name **] with her daughter [**Name (NI) **]

Family History:
no family history of diabetes but positive family history for
gallstones and pancreatic cancer.  She has an aunt who died from
liver cancer.

CT Chest/Abd with contrast [**12-27**]:
1. No pulmonary embolus, aortic dissection, or aortic aneurysm.
2. Extensive pancreatitis with now only trace residual
pancreatic
enhancement, consistent with diffuse necrosis. Also noted is
thrombus in the
portal vein, splenic vein and superior mesenteric vein. There is
no
pseudocyst or aortic pseudoaneurysm.
3. Enlarged endometrial hypodensity. These findings should be
correlated to
the patient's menstrual history as it is atypical in a
postmenopausal patient.
Would recommend correlation to pelvic ultrasound.
4. Bibasilar consolidations, likely atelectatic, with adjacent
pleural
effusions.
5. Diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver.

Minimal interval improvement in bilateral pleural effusions and

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 104086**] is a 54 year-old Spanish speaking female with
history of GERD and asthma, who was transferred to the ICU for
necrotizing gallstone pancreatitis.

* Necrotizing pancreatitis  - etiology is gallstone pancreatitis
as stones were clearly visualized on OSH CT and abd U/S.  She
developed necrotizing pancreatitis as a complication of
gallstone pancreatitis, as evidenced on repeat CT scan.
Necrotizing pancreatitis must be closely monitored as it can
lead to pancreatic infection, retroperitoneal hemorrhage and
sepsis with multi-organ system failure. Surgery and GI were
consulted upon admission who recommended conservative medical
management and contination of meropenem. She was kept NPO and
interventional radiology was consulted for NJ tube placement for
parenteral nutrition since below-the-gut nutrition has shown to
be beneficial in necrotizing pancreatitis. She was transferred
to the floor and continued to improve.  Her pain continued to
decrease and was slowly able to tolerate a diet.  Unfortunately,
one morning she became more nauseous and her feeding tube
dislodged and was finally pulled.  At this point, she was able
to tolerate a regular diet and so the feeding tube was not
reinserted.  Nutrition was reconsulted given that she was no
longer on tube feeds and felt that she would be able to continue
on her current diet without additional tube feeds.  She will
need follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 174**] as an outpatient.  Per the
inpatient GI team, she will also need liver clinic follow up in
the future.

* SMV/portal vein/splenic vein thrombosis - nonocclusive
thrombosis found on Abd CT.  Most likely this is provoked in the
setting of her pancreatitis, given that she also does not have a
history of DVT.  She was started on a heparin gtt and closely
monitored given the chance of developing hemorraghic
pancreatitis in the setting of her necrosis.  Heme onc was
consulted to help determine the length of anticoagulation.  They
recommended to continue anticoagulation for 6 months and to be
seen in their clinic in follow up to determine if the patient
should have a hypercoagulable work up.  To help transition her
home, she was changed from heparin gtt to lovenox.  On the day
of discharge her INR was 5.3 and her coumadin will be held on
[**1-2**] evening.  She will need daily INR checks until her INR is
stable x 2 days.  She should receive 2 mg of coumadin daily once
her INR is back in the normal range.  Her Hct is stable, but
should be followed on [**1-3**] AM.

* Sinus tachycardia - On arrival to the floor, her HR was stable
in the 120s.  Given her thromboses above, this was concerning
for PE.  She had a CT PE protocol which was negative, but
revealed moderate bilateral pleural effusions.  Over the course
of her hospitalization, her HR decreased to 90s on discharge.

* Pleural effusions - This is likely a result of the volume
resuscitation at the OSH and ICU for her pancreatitis.  This is
likely [**3-17**] to the inflammation asso
