Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
Feeling unwell after Ambien

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
77F d/c'd from rehab 1 wk ago after colectomy for colon cancer
(at [**Hospital1 882**]) in [**2179-3-7**]. Her husband gave her an ambien, and
then about 5-10 minutes later she rolled over on her side and
told him to call 911.  According to EMS report, on arrival, the
patient was alert and oriented x3.  She was warm and dry on
exam.  She said that ambien made her feel "crazy" with nausea
and vomiting.  Having general malaise.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 97.8 58 97/52 20 100% ra, The
patient had episodes of hypotension w/ SBPs in 70s-80s. She has
been persistently tachycardic in 100s-110s with no attempt to
see if rate control would help her pressures.  Labs and imaging
significant for trop 0.29-->0.27 (MB and CK pending), BUN/Cr
41/2.0 (no baseline), H/H 9.6/32.8 MCV 80(no baseline), lactate
2.7, EKG according to ED showed atrial fibrillation at 109, QTc
457, PVCs.  CT head negative for acute intracranial process, CXR
with low lung volumes and increased vascular markings.  Patient
was given hydrocortisone for possibl adrenal insufficiency given
chronic steroid use, zofran for nausea and started on heparin
drip and plavix (aspirin allergy) for presumed ACS.  The patient
received 1L NS of fluids and HR decreased to 90s and BP rose to
the 100% systolic .  Cardiology was consulted and plan to admit
to CCU for further management.  Vitals on transfer were HR: 86
BP: 103/82, RR: 16 O2 sat: 100% 2L NC.

-echo - moderate symmetric LVH with moderately depressed
systolic function. Restrictive left ventricular filling. The
appearance of the left ventricular myocardium suggests
infiltrative disease. Dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle.
Moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate to severe tricuspid
regurgitation. While estimated pulmonary systolic pressures are
normal, they are likely UNDERestimated (or the right ventricular
function is so poor that it cannot elevate its pressure).

-renal/abdominal ultrasound - Echogenic liver compatible with
fatty infiltration. More serious forms of steatohepatitis,
fibrosis, and/or cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.
Normal kidneys without any explanation for acute renal
insufficiency. Moderate right pleural effusion. Numerous
anechoic ovoid lesions in the right lateral abdominal
subcutaneous fat. These lesions are incompletely characterized
by ultrasound. The location of these lesions should be
correlated with history of prior subcutaneous injections that
could represent incompletely absorbed injected medications.
Abdominal wall metastases cannot be excluded on this study. A CT
scan is recommended for further evaluation. Ideally, this would
be with intravenous contrast; however, a non-contrast CT may
still useful in the setting of acute renal failure.

[**6-8**]- Pyrophosphate Study-
1. Relatively low-level pyrophosphate uptake in the heart. Often

amyloid will show intense myocardial uptake; however
pyrophosphate should not accumulate in the normal heart.  2.
Multiple foci of uptake in the bones. Etiology of bony findings
could be further evaluated with a dedicated CT.  3. Moderate
bilateral pleural effusions.


Brief Hospital Course:
77 yo female with history of stage IIIA colon cancer s/p
resection who is admitted for restrictive cardiomyopathy
suggestive of cardiac amyloid. Hospital course complicated with
pre-renal acute renal failure.

ACUTE ISSUES:

# Restrictive Cardiomyopathy/?Cardiac Amyloid - displayed
predominantly right-sided symptoms in the setting of bilateral
ventricular failure.  Echocardiogram showed moderate symmetric
LVH with moderately depressed systolic function, restrictive
left ventricular filling, and a dilated and hypokinetic right
ventricle, and the appearance of the left ventricular myocardium
suggested infiltrative disease (likely amyloid). Pyrophosphate
scan showed update throughout mycardium, suggestive of
transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis. She was treated with a lasix
gtt, metoprolol, and fluid/sodium restriction. ACE-I/[**Last Name (un) **] was not
given in the setting of mildly low blood pressures (80-100s).
Her fluid status was optimized and she waill have outpatient FU
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital6 1708**] to monitor heart
failure /cardiac amyloid along with TTR gene.

Of note, the patient as initially discharged to a rehab facility
on [**2179-6-12**].  However, she felt that the rehab facility was
unsatisfactory and she refused to stay.  That being said, the
patient returned to the hospital on the same day, and was placed
in observation status.  Case management and social work were
both working with the patient and coordinating her ultimate
disposition.  The patient refused to go to certain rehabs that
had open beds, prolonging her hospitalization.  The patient was
ultimately discharged to rehab.

# Acute Kidney Injury/Pre-Renal - creatinine on admission was
2.2 (from baseline of 1.3 earlier in the week, per conversation
