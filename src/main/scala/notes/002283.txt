Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
Ventricular fibrillation and tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Internal cardiac defibrillator placement


History of Present Illness:
71yo M with ischemic CM, last EF 20-25%, CKD, DM, PAD with
recurrent nonhealing ulcers and s/p multiple bypass/grafts. ECG
shows signs of old inferior MI. EF dropped to 20% in [**2-/2138**] so
patient underwent cardiac catheterization via radial access in
5/[**2138**].  Found to have 70% prox RCA (no intervention) and 80%
prox Lcx (unable to stent but POBA'd).  Pt has not had any chest
pain. Repeat echo in [**9-/2138**] unchanged.  Saw Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] who
suggested ICD and continued lisinopril 2.5mg daily and Toprol XL
50mg daily); uptitration limited by BP.  Over past 3 weeks, he
reports intermittent episodes of lightheadedness after walking,
sometimes associated with nausea, that gradually subsides.  He
saw [**Doctor Last Name **] on [**12-24**] and was orthostatic so metolazone was stopped
but he was kept on Lasix 60mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
The patient sat down today at dinner table and felt dizzy and
nauseated.  He didn't realize he had syncopized but witnessed by
family who called EMS, no head trauma. EMS noted a pale
appearance and found him to be in monomorphic VT on telemetry.
His blood pressures remained stable (documented BP 107/68), and
he broke spontaneously into sinus rhythm.
.
On ED arrival, VS: P 70, BP 106/74, RR 18, O2sat 100%.  He again
went into VT on arrival and became unresponsive although with a
pulse.  As pads were being placed, he woke up and went into
sinus rhythm.  As amiodarone was ordered, he again went into VT
and became unresponsive, this time thought to be pulseless.  He
was emergently shocked with 200J with restoration of sinus
rhythm.  He was bolused amiodarone and started on gtt.  He was
also given calcium gluconate due to concern for hyperkalemia in
setting of chronic renal failure; hemolyzed K 6.4 on arrival;
repeat K 1/2 hour later was 4.6.  He received a total of 1L IVF
in the ED.  CXR unremarkable.  On transfer, Afebrile P 86, BP
96/63 (80s-90s baseline), RR 16, O2sat 96% RA.
.
On review of systems, he endorses chronic LBP, h/o pulmonary
emboli. S/He denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, bleeding
at the time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.  Denies dysuria, urgency,
frequency.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for presence of syncope and
for the absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations.

CXR
Please note the extreme right costophrenic angle is excluded
from
view. Lung volumes are diminished. No consolidation or edema is
evident.
Calcified pleural plaques are again evident consistent with
prior asbestos
exposure. The mediastinum is grossly unremarkable. The cardiac
silhouette is exaggerated by low lung volumes but likely grossly
top normal for size. No large effusion or pneumothorax is noted
within limitations. Degenerative changes are seen throughout the
thoracic spine.
.
IMPRESSION: Relatively stable chest x-ray examination within
limits. No
focal consolidation noted. There are underlying calcified
plaques from prior asbestos exposure.
.
.
CXR post placement: The patient is slightly rotated to the left.
A left pectoral ICD leads terminate in the expected locations of
the right atrium and right ventricle. Pleural plaques are likely
due to prior asbestos exposure. The cardiac and mediastinal
silhouettes and hilar contours are normal. There is no pleural
effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: ICD leads terminate in right atrium and right
ventricle.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 71yo M with CAD s/p silent inferior MI and
subsequent ischemic cardiomyopathy with last EF 20%, CKD, HTN,
DM, HLD who presents after monomorphic VT arrest at home with
ROSC and now s/p pulseless VT/VF arrest in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, now HD
stable.
.
# RHYTHM: now s/p VT/VF arrest and now in sinus again on
amiodarone gtt. [**Month (only) 116**] be related to old scar from known prior
ischemia. EP initially wanted cath, but interventional did not
feel it was necessary, CT [**Doctor First Name **] ddid't feel that
revascularization was warranted, so ultimately the patient was
monitored clinically and an ICD was placed. We also started him
on amiodarone first IV, then transitioned to PO prior to
discharge, with instructions to half the dose a week later and
take 1 pill indefinitely. We also decreased his warfarin, given
interaction with amiodarone and gave him a
