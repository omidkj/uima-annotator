History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname **] is an 82 year old female with history of COPD not on
home O2, CAD s/p CABG ([**2147**]), CHF (EF 40-50%), s/p BiV ICD who
presents from home with progressive dyspnea x 5 days.  She also
reports cough productive of brown sputum over this period of
time.  She denies any fevers, chills or night sweats.  She had
no chest pain, diaphoresis, or headache.  She did occasionally
feel lightheaded.  She also had decreased PO intake over the
past week.  She had been using her inhalers at home with only
minimal relief.  The shortness of breath has been progressive
and worsened with any exertion to the point where she became
dyspneic while eating her cereal this morning.  Her son had
encouraged her to go to the ED yesterday but she refused,
finally agreed to present today.
.
In the ED the patient's vital signs were T 97.7, BP 80/38, HR
70, RR 17, O2sat 88% on RA improved to 95% on 2L.  She was given
500cc NS for low blood pressure with good response to systolic
100-110.  One hour later BP trended down to systolic 80s and
another 500cc NS was given again with good improvement in BP to
systolic 110.  She was started on maintenance IVF at 100cc/hr.
She had 300cc of urine output.  She was given albuterol and
ipratroprium nebulizers with symptomatic improvement in
shortness of breath.  CXR showed new LLL opacity concerning for
PNA with adjacent parapneumonic effusion.  UA negative for
infection.  Blood and urine cultures were drawn.  She was given
ceftriaxone and levofloxacin.  Consideration was given to CTA to
rule out PE, however given patient's acute renal failure and low
suspicion for PE the study was deferred for now.   The patient
is being admitted to the ICU due to labile blood pressure in the
ED.
.
On arrival to the floor, the patient is feeling well.  She feels
that her breathing is much improved.  She continues to have
cough.  She has no chest pain, shortness of breath or dizziness.
 She is A&Ox3.  She is speaking in full sentences without
difficulty.  Ms. [**Known lastname **] reports a 20lb unintentional weight loss
over the past several months.
.
ROS: The patient denies fevers, chills, chest pain, diaphoresis,
lightheadedness, dizziness.  No orthopnea, PND, LE edema.

Imaging:
========

CXR ([**2154-6-11**]): New left lower lung opacity concerning for
pneumonia with
adjacent parapneumonic effusion.
.
CXR ([**2154-6-12**]): In comparison with the study of [**6-11**], there is
little change. Opacification in the left lower lung consistent
with the clinical diagnosis of pneumonia. The degree of left
effusion cannot be evaluated since the outer aspect of the image
on this side has been excluded. Right basilar opacification
persists.
.
CXR ([**2154-6-23**]):  As compared to the previous examination, there is
no major change.  The pre-existing areas of parenchymal
consolidation that presumably represent pneumonia are unchanged
in extent and distribution. Unchanged position of the
defibrillator leads. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.

CT Torso ([**2154-6-24**]):  1. Moderate-to-large left pleural effusion
as described above. No definite cause is identified. However,
there is a patch of consolidation/atelectasis within the left
upper lobe, which cannot be further characterized for underlying
neoplasm given the collapse and inability to administer IV
contrast. Consider follow-up imaging after therapy or
thoracentesis for further evaluation.

2. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

3. Emphysema with interstitial lung disease and calcified
pleural plaques,
probably asbestos related.

CT Head ([**2154-6-24**]):  No definite intracranial metastatic lesions.
Please note that the non-contrast technique of this head CT is
significantly limited for assessment of intracranial metastatic
disease. If the patient cannot tolerate MR imaging with
gadolinium due to implanted pacemaker/defibrillator or for other
reasons, further e
