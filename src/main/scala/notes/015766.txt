Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
-Attempted Ventricular Tachycardia Ablation
-Endotracheal Intubation

History of Present Illness:
This is a 68 y.o. male with past medical history of MI in [**2123**]
s/p PTCA at [**Hospital1 2177**] as well as aplastic anemia, DM, and PVD who
presented on the day of admission with approximately one hour of
chest pain.  This pain did not start with exertion as the
patient was just walking around his house when he noticed some
pain under his sternum.  At first, he thought this was most
likely heartburn so he took a couple of TUMs and then went to
lay down for a while.  Unfortunately, after about an hour he was
continuing to have this pain, which continued at a five out of
ten level and was beginning to radiate into his right shoulder.
He was not diaphoretic or short of breath at rest.  He described
this pain as very similar to his previous cardiac pain but less
severe.  When the pain did not go away after rest he became
concerned for a [**Last Name **] problem and called the ambulance to take
him to this hospital.

In the ED initial vital signs were 75, 145/84, RR 15, O2 Sat of
96% on 4L.  He had an EKG which showed possible ST segment
elevations and T wave inversions in V3-V5 that remained stable
during his time in the ED.  Initial cardiac enzymes revealed a
troponin of 0.74 and CPK of 155 and MB of 6.  Other remarkable
lab values at the time included a Cr of 2.2 (up from his
baseline of 1.7) and a Platelet count of 101.  He was given
aspirin, clopidogrel, and started on NTG and heparin gtt.  His
pain resolved early in his ED course and did not recur.  The
cardiology fellow was consulted and felt though the patient was
most likely having an NSTEMI that he did not need urgent cath so
Mr. [**Known lastname 37430**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 1516**] service for management with
early cathterization and revascularization planned in the next
24-48 hrs.  Epifibatide was initially held due to concern about
his thrombocytopenia and bleeding risk.

Past Medical History:
1. Diabetes Mellitus type 2
2. Hypertension
3. Coronary Artery Disease s/p balloon angioplasty in [**2133**]
4. Peripheral Vascular Disease s/p R fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass in [**Month (only) 216**],
[**2138**]
5. s/p right Carotid Endarterectomy in [**2135-1-26**]; left carotid
artery completely occluded but asymptomatic
6. s/p right 5th toe amputation in [**2137-6-25**]


Social History:
He is retired.  He worked as a maintenance worker at [**Hospital1 2177**] for 25
yrs. He is widowed but has a son and daughter-in-law in town who
he stays in close touch with.  He lives by himself in poor
financial circumstances.  He has smoked one and a half packs of
cigarettes/day for at least 50 years. He denies alcohol or other
drugs.


Family History:
His mother and sister have diabetes mellitus type two.  Many
members of his family have hyptertension.

JVD was appreciated.  Lung exam without crackles, wheezes,
rhonchi, or rales on auscultation.  No edema noted.

<b><u>OTHER STUDIES</b></u>
EKG on [**2146-10-15**]:
Sinus rhythm with Q waves in leads II, III and aVF consistent
with inferior
myocardial infarction of indeterminate age. ST segment coving in
leads V3- with associated T wave inversions consistent with
evolving anterior injury
pattern. Multiple ventricular premature beats. No previous
tracing available for comparison.

CXR on [**2146-10-15**]:
IMPRESSION: There is diffuse pulmonary edema. There is likely a
right
pleural effusion possibly a small left pleural effusion. A more
consolidative process in the right lung base cannot be excluded.
The heart appears relatively enlarged even accounting for
patient and technical factors which would represent an acute
change. Repeat radiography following appropriate diuresis is
recommended to assess for underlying infection.

Echocardiogram on [**2146-10-16**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is an inferolateral basal left
ventricular aneurysm. There is severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the mid to distal anterior
septum, basal inferior and inferolateral segments, severe
hypokinesis of the remaining segments with sparing of the basal
septum. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (LVEF= 15-20 %). Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic root
is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Moderately dilated left ventricle with severe
regional dysfunction consistent with ischemic heart disease
(multivessel).


Brief Hospital Course:
68 year old gentleman with history of coronary artery disease
s/p MI as well as diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular
disease, and aplastic anemia presenting with chest pain.

1) NSTEMI/CAD: Given the patient's multiple risk factors and EKG
changes he was diagnosed with presumptive ACS on arrival to the
ED and thus was almost immediately given aspirin and beta
blocker and started on nitroglycerine.  His pain resolved after
receiving NTG and never recurred.  He was also started on
heparin.  After his first set of cardiac enzymes returned
positive the on-call cardiology fellow was contact[**Name (NI) **] and made
aware of the patient.  S/he recommended against epifibatide
given the patient's thrombocytopenia and indicated that the
patient did not need urgent cathterization.  The patient was
admitted to the cardiology service with plan for cardiac
catheterization in the next 24-48 hours. The patient was then
transferred to CCU for sustained VT (see below).  Repeat cardiac
enzymes continued to show flat CK's and echo showed significant
wall motion abnormalities suggesting this was a subacute
presentation of a myocardial infarction.  This indicated less
benefit from immediate catheterization and given development of
decompensated heart failure and need for intubation (see belo
