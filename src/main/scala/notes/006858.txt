ADDENDUM:  Prior to discharge, per Pulmonary consult
recommendations, the patient received lower extremity duplex
study of both lower extremities, the results of which were
normal compression and augmentation, no evidence of DVT in
either lower extremity.

The patient received a decubitus chest film to evaluate for
layering of fluid.  Right side decubitus films showed free
pleural fluid.  Impression:  Large right-sided pleural
effusion without any evidence of left-sided effusion.  No
evidence of empyema.

Given this finding, the patient was taken by Pulmonary for
thoracentesis, ultrasound-guided.  On ultrasound, the patient
had inadequate fluid for successful thoracentesis.  Thus,
this was not done.  Subsequently, the Pulmonary consult
recommended that the patient receive CT angio to rule out
pulmonary embolism.  CT of the chest with contrast showed no
left-sided pleural effusion, a small right-sided pleural
effusion, small focal consolidation in the right lower lobe,
no pneumothorax, no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Conclusion:  No evidence of PE, right lower lobe pneumonia
with small right-sided pleural effusion.

The patient also received pulmonary function tests.  The
official results are pending at the time of discharge but
showed exceptionally poor restrictive lung disease with
severely reduced FVC, TLC, and DLCO.  These results suggest
poor restrictive lung disease and perhaps additional
involvement of the pulmonary parenchyma or vascular
involvement.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS ADDENDUM:
1.  Vancomycin 1 gram IV q. 24 hours.
2.  Change the patient's long-acting insulin Lantus to 22
units subcutaneously q.h.s.
3.  Sliding scale insulin should also be changed as follows:
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner with Humalog for the following
blood sugars; 0-65 no insulin, the patient may receive [**Location (un) 2452**]
juice or 1 amp of D50; 66-100 3 units Humalog; from 101-150 5
units; 151-200 7 units; 201-250 9 units; 251-300 11 units;
301-350 13 units; 351-400 15 units; greater than 400 17 units
Humalog and notify house officer.  Bedtime Humalog:  From
0-65 no insulin, [**Location (un) 2452**] juice or 1 amp D50; 66-200 nothing;
201-250 3 units Humalog; 251-300 5 units; 301-350 7 units;
351-400 9 units; greater than 400 11 units Humalog and notify
house officer.
4.  Both Zosyn and vancomycin should be continued until
[**2187-1-19**].

ADDENDUM TO FOLLOW-UP PLAN:  The patient would benefit from
outpatient sleep study to evaluate the presence of nocturnal
hypoxia and the patient's BIPAP requirement.  The patient
should receive repeat echocardiogram with bubble study to
rule out shunt.  The patient should receive repeat pulmonary
function tests after resolution of pleural effusion.

The patient should receive repeat chest CT in six weeks to
evaluate for resolving lung consolidation.  The patient's
appointment with Pulmonary Service at [**Telephone/Fax (1) **] should be made
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] in two to three weeks.
