Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 10493**]
Chief Complaint:
Bright red blood per rectum X 1 day

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right inguinal hernia repair [**2173-6-8**]


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 year-old male with a complicated PMHx
including HTN, DM type 2, hypercholesterolemia, and history of
AAA s/p repair and s/p CEA, and 2 recent psychiatric admissions
for depression s/p ECT in 04/[**2173**]. He presents with a 1-week
history of loose stools ([**6-9**] BMs per day), followed by onset of
abdominal pain on the day prior to admission in both lower
quadrants, R>L, worse with palpation, progressive. He also
developed BRBPR, frequency unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] was seen in his PCPs
office 1 day PTA, at which time he was also found to be
hyponatremic. He was brought to the ED for further evaluation.
Of note, per the patient's sister, he apparently also fell on
the day prior to admission.

ROS negative for fever at home. No N/V. Review of records
indicates that his last colonoscopy revealed diverticulosis.
Poor PO intake over the past 2 days [**2-3**] abdominal pain.

In the ED, T up to 101.7. BP 160/64 --> SBP 79, which responded
to boluses of IV fluids. He was given a total of 5 liters in the
ED. He was started on Levo and Flagyl, and surgery was
consulted. He was subsequently admitted to the SICU for further
management.

Relevant imaging studies in hospital:

[**2173-6-2**] AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY: 1) No acute
cardiopulmonary process. 2) Widely ectatic intrathoracic aorta.

[**6-2**] CT OF THE CHEST/ABDOMEN with IV CONTRAST:
1. Colitis, incompletely assessed. Discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
in the morning of [**2173-6-3**]. Differential includes
infectious, inflammatory, and ischemic etiology.
2. Similar appearance of ectatic and aneurysmal thoracic aorta
with penetrating ulcers. Patent aortobifemoral graft. Stable
thrombosed aneurysm of the proximal celiac artery; it is unclear
whether there is antegrade flow through the celiac artery, or
whether filling is retrograde.
3. Similar appearance of L1 wedge compression fracture.
4. Periportal edema, with trace ascites.
5. Emphysema.

[**6-2**] CT HEAD: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, or
significant change since the prior study.

[**2173-6-7**] CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: There is atelectasis at both
lung bases with trace effusion. Again noted is an aneurysmal,
ectatic descending thoracic aorta. There is no pericardial
effusion.

The liver, spleen, pancreas, and adrenals are unremarkable.
There is new marked dilatation of the mid small bowel, with
loops measuring up to 4.5 cm. The distal small bowel is
decompressed, and contrast has not yet passed to the terminal
ileum. There is a rounded fluid-filled structure in the right
groin with a thin enhancing rim that enhances similarly to the
small bowel wall. However, although this cannot be definitely
connected to the small bowel, the appearance is very concerning
for an incarcerated right inguinal hernia causing the bowel
obstruction. There is no evidence of pneumatosis. The abdominal
arterial and venous vasculature appears patent. Again noted is
marked edema within the descending colonic wall, unchanged, and
consistent with colitis.

PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: There is a Foley catheter and some gas
within the bladder. There is a moderate amount of free pelvic
fluid, increased in volume in the interval.

BONE WINDOWS: Osseous structures appear stable. There is
aneurysmal calcification within the proximal celiac artery,
unchanged.

Multiplanar reformatted images redemonstrate findings consistent
with a mechanical small bowel obstruction and the unusual
fluid-filled rounded structure in the right groin.

IMPRESSION:
1) New apparent mechanical small bowel obstruction with marked
dilatation of the mid small bowel to 4.5 cm. We cannot exclude
the presence of an incarcerated right inguinal hernia. Findings
were discussed by telephone with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. Surgical
consultation and close physical exam recommended.
2) No evidence of pneumatosis. Persistent descending colitis.
3) Interval increase in volume of free fluid within the pelvis.
It is unclear whether this relates to colitis or the new small
bowel obstruction.

Brief Hospital Course:
68 year-old male with extensive [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1106**] history and multiple
medical comorbidities, admitted with a 1-week history of
diarrhea and 1-day h/o abdominal pain and BRBPR. His hospital
course will be reviewed by problems.

1) GI: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was initially admitted to the SICU for close
hemodynamic monitoring. An initial CT was limited by the lack of
oral contrast, but suspicious for colitis. The GI service was
consulted, with an initial differential dx of ischemic colitis
in the setting of dehydration and low flow state, infectious
colitis, IBD (less likely given normal C-scope in [**11/2172**]), and
diverticulitis. In the SICU, he was kept NPO, fluid
resuscitated, and started on Protonix IV BID. He was also
continued on Levo and Flagyl for coverage of GI organisms. His
elevated lactate normalized on hospital day #2. He remained
hemodynamically stable, without pressor requirement. BRBPR
resolved, as well as fever. Of note, stool returned negative for
C. difficile.

Per GI, the most likely diagnosis was ischemic colitis. His diet
was advanced to clears on [**6-5**]. Unfortunately, he subsequently
developed worsening abdominal distension, and an AXR showed
dilated loops of bowel. An abdominal
