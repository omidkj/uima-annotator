replacement, closure of an incidental patent foramen ovale and
ligation of the left atrial appendage was performed.  She
tolerated the procedure well and weaned from bypass on Propofol
alone.  She remained stable, was weaned from the ventilator and
extubated.

Carvedilol and diuresed. her renal function remained stable, she
was in electrical sinus rhythm.  Coumadin was not given due to
her high fall risk and prior intolerance from bruising.

mobility and strengthening.  Wound were healing well and
surgical staples remained in place. She was placed on oral
