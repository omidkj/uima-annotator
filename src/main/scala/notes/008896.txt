Chief Complaint:
Nausea, Vomiting, Diarrhea

History of Present Illness:
Taken from admission note to MICU:

85 yo male with history CAD EF 70%, PAF, CKD, ILD
radiographically consistent with UIP/IPF, pHTN followed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], prostate cancer, bladder cancer, diverticulitis, spinal
stenosis and renal calculi presents to the ED with complaints of
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and dyspnea.  He recently was
hospitalized on [**2176-2-20**] for a R hip fracture and discharged to
[**Hospital 100**] Rehab on [**2176-2-20**].  His course was complicated by
hemoptysis thought to be due to intubation, and hypoxia that was
thought to possibly be pneumonia and the patient was discharged
with Levofloxaxin for possible infection/bronchitis.  His viral
and bacterial cultures were negative.  He reports that his
respiratory function has declined slightly over the past [**6-12**]
weeks as he's had intermittently had difficulty climbing the
stairs.  He denies any lightheadedness, dizziness, syncope,
pleuritic pain, increased cough, rhinorrhea, PND, orthopnea,
palpitations, abdominal swelling, leg swelling or weight gain.
Of note he reports that he's had decreasing appetite resulting
in decreasing weight over the past couple years.

He also reports that over the past 3 days of nausea associated
with bilious nonbloody vomiting and nonbloody copius diarrhea.
He was started empirically on PO Vancomycin for presumed culture
negative Cdiff.  The diarrhea was reported as multiple times per
day associated with abdominal cramping that was relieved with
defecation.  He denies any increase in size or pain of his
chronic ventral hernia and also denies hematochezia or melena.

On day of admission, he was noted to have desaturations to the
mid80s on RA and was brought to the ED.

His initial vital signs in the ED were: 98.1 112 130/73 22 88RA.
 He was noted to have a CXR with a possible left sided
infiltrate and a KUB with air fluid levels and unchanged chronic
ventral incisional hernia, which resulted in a Surgery consult
and eventual unrevealing CT Abdomen.

He was treated with IV Vancomycin and IV Levofloxacin for
pneumonia, diltiazem for tachycardia and given 2L NS and
transferred to the ICU as he required a NRB for hypoxia

Physical Exam:
On Admission:

Vitals: T:98.4 BP:144/59 P:121 R:19 O2:100 NRB
General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, poor dentition
Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD
Lungs: bilateral lower field rhonchorous sounds L>R, extending
2/3 up the L posterior lung field
CV: tachycardic, irregularly irregulat, normal S1 + S2, no
murmurs, rubs, gallops
Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, large nontender ventral hernia,
bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no
organomegaly
Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or
edema

Pertinent Results:
KUB [**2176-3-9**]: Multiple air-fluid levels without dilated bowel.
Findings most compatible with gastroenteritis. If there is
strong concern for bowel
obstruction, CT may be obtained.

CXR [**2176-3-9**]: Chronic lung changes, with equivocal new opacity in
the left
upper lung. Followup imaging is recommended if clinical symptoms
persist.

CT ABD/PEL [**2176-3-9**]:
1. No evidence of bowel obstruction. Large ventral hernia
containing loops of nonobstructed bowel.
2. Extensive sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of
diverticulitis.
3. Severe atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta and branch
vessels.
4. Moderately large hiatal hernia.
5. Extensive confluent fibrosis involving the lungs, progressed
since
[**2172-10-16**]. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
6. Innumerable hypodensities in each kidney, incompletely
assessed.
7. Cholelithiasis.

CXR [**2176-3-10**]: Little interval change.

TTE [**2176-3-11**]: Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2176-2-15**], the right ventricular cavity is now dilated with free
wall hypokinesis. The severity of mitral regurgitation and
tricuspid regurgitation is increased. EF >55%

Brief Hospital Course:
85 yo M with CAD, CHF, ILD, 2 weeks s/p ORIF of R femoral fx who
p/w acute on chronic SOB and n/v/diarrhea. Likely progression of
events: CDiff diarrhea causing N/V/D-->aspiration event-->strain
on lungs and heart-->SOB, decreased O2 sats, cardiac enzyme
leak. UTI as consequence of foley for I/O measurement.

# Hypoxia/SOB: Thought to be multifactorial, including baseline
ILD, new aspiration PNA, anemia, new NSTEMI, and diastolic
CHF/fluid overload. Pt was evaluated by speech and swallow and
found to have no prandial aspiration, but given ventral and
hiatal hernias, and recent vomiting, aspiration remained most
likely cause of new pneumonia found on CT scan. This was treated
with Vancomycin and Ceftazadime IV, and to be continued for an 8
day course via his left midline (placed at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab). Pt had
negative nasal rapid resp viral screen and contaminated sputum
cultures. Pt suffered an NSTEMI, leading to worsening diastolic
CHF and worsening his respiratory status. He improved with
gentle diuresis and at time of discharge was satting mid 90s on
3L oxygen.

#: NSTEMI: On presentation, pt had a troponin leak peaking at
1.26 on [**3-10**], but CKs remained flat. Pt had no EKG changes and
was pain free but TTE was thought to show new right ventricular
free wall motion defect. This was interpreted as demand
ischemia/NSTEMI which likely happened prior to admission. He was
continued on his prior medical management of ASA, statin, and
beta-blocker increased (for afib rate control).  Plavix was
stopped (stent placed 3 years ago and guaiac positive stool) and
ACE inhibitor stopped (for worsening renal function).

# diastolic CHF: Pt had known diastolic CHF, with TTE on this
admission again showeing EF >60%. He remained slightly
hyperv
