ERCP [**2185-1-11**] for blocked stent


History of Present Illness:
75F with h/o amyloidosis, c/b ESRD on HD, with recent NSTEMI
[**3-5**] admitted after ERCP for cholangitis.  Pt currently cannot
give a reliable history as she is still sedated after ERCP.  Per
the chart, pt admitted to OSH with abdominal pain and mental
status changes.  She reportedly had worsening abdominal pain,
episodic SOB, had a few episodes of diarrhea.  Was generally
feeling weak and lethargic.  Son states that she was saying
things that didn't make sense.  At OSH, had fever to 100.2, was
confused and delirious.  LFTs with obstructive pattern, RUQ u/s
with intrahepatic biliary dilatation -> overall, concern for
biliary sepsis.  Also noted to have thrombocytopenia, labs c/w
DIC.  Transferred here for ERCP for definitive therapy.

LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)  [**2185-5-17**] 3:40 PM

LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGL

Reason: eval for interval change in size or new lesions

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
75 year old woman with known liver lesion.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for interval change in size or new lesions
75-year-old woman with known liver lesions. Assess for interval
change in size or new lesions.

LIVER ULTRASOUND: Comparison is made to prior examination of
[**2185-4-22**]. In the left lobe of the liver, there is a 12.1 x 6.1 x
4.0 cm multiloculated mass which has changed its appearance
significantly from the prior examination, whereas previously it
appeared overall quite heterogeneous with small areas of
hypoechogenicity. There now appear to be large fluid components
in this mass. The remainder of the liver is unremarkable. There
is ascites surrounding the liver. The gallbladder is collapsed.
The common bile duct is normal at 2 mm. There are small lymph
nodes around the celiac axis measuring 0.7 cm in short axis. The
pancreas appears unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:

1. Large mass in the left lobe of the liver. The appearance has
changed significantly from the prior examination of [**2185-4-22**] and
the mass now contains large loculated fluid components. This may
represent tumor necrosis.

2. No new lesions are identified.

3. Ascites surrounding the liver.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Date range (1) 77612**] The patient's initial MICU course was complicated by
acute GI bleeding, bacteremia, fungemia, and dialysis access
complications. In this complicated setting, she also had a
NSTEMI which was medically treated, and also was noted to have a
liver mass. Due to a significant bleeding diatheses, a biopsy
could not be performed until the patient was stabilized. She
gradually improved and was transferred to the floor for futher
evaluation.

[**2093-5-6**] Her bleeding diatheses was managed with improving
nutrition as directed by nutrition consult, and high dose
vitamin K SQ for three days. Her respiratory status
decompensated, with increasing oxygen requirement, thought to be
due to profound hypotension with even modest ultrafiltration on
hemodialysis despite aggressive sodium modelling and dialysis
protocol optimization. Once her coagulation profile improved,
her pleural effusion was tapped to optimize her respiratory
status, and approximately one liter was removed. The fluid was
sent for cytology and culture. The patient was also
significantly deconditioned and in significant pain and often
declined physical therapy; her medical regimen was adjusted to
include fentanyl transdermal patch for better basal pain control
in an effort to increase adherence to a PT regimen.

[**2102-5-14**] The patient was taken off of daptomycin and fluconazole
after receiving over 14 days of treatment for both the
bacteremia and fungemia.  The patient still had diffuse anasarca
with limited fluid removal during HD secondary to symptomatic
hypotension.  A repeat liver US was obtained which showed a
rapid progression in size of the previously seen lesion.  A
family meeting was held and it was decided to pursue a liver
biopsy to help determine if further aggressive care would be
beneficial in terms of life prolongation.  Serial cultures were
obtained after stopping the prior dapto and fluconazole.  On
[**5-20**] the patient grew out GNR.  She was started on zosyn and
cipro for empiric coverage.

[**2105-5-23**] The patient preliminary liver biopsy results demonstrate
amyloidosis and further discussions with the patient's health
care proxy, her son, indicated a desire to moves towards hospice
care. Her central venous catheters were removed, her antibiotics
were discontinued, and her dialysis was stopped. She was then
transferred to a skilled nursing facility with hospice care.
