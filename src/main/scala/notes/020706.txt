IMAGING:
CXR [**2170-5-3**] at 11:31AM (wet read): Bibasilar opacities probably
atelectasis, but somewhat nodular at the right base; suggest
short-term follow-up PA and lateral films to show resolution.
.
CXR [**2170-5-4**]:
The positioning of the patient is suboptimal. Within those
limitations, there is no substantial change in the right lower
lung and left basal opacities that might reflect areas of
atelectasis but infectious process cannot be excluded. Repeated
radiograph is indicated.
.
EKG: sinus tachycardia @ 101, left axis deviation, no ST
changes; unchanged from prior [**2170-4-17**]

Microbiology:
Blood, urine and sputum cx's ([**5-3**]): no growth

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 64yo female with a history of asthma, question COPD
not on home O2, CAD (s/p RCA stents [**12-19**]), PVD s/p BKA, IDDM,
and multiple DVTs (on warfarin) who presented to the hospital
with acute respiratory distress requiring ICU admission.
.
#Hypoxia/Respiratory distress: She was initially admitted to the
ICU for respiratoy distress.  She was treated for acute
exacerbation of her underlying asthma with aggressive
bronchodilator therapy, steroid burst, and she was also started
on empiric antibiotics for possible HCAP, given some haziness on
chest x-ray.  All her culture data returned negative.  Her
repeat chest x-ray remained stable, and her respiratory status
returned to baseline.  She was transferred to the General
Medical floor given her stability.  Given the absence of growth
from her respiratory culture, she was tailored to single [**Doctor Last Name 360**]
antibiotic therapy with Levaquin, and will complete a course of
antibiotics.  She will also complete a quick steroid taper.  She
will need a repeat CXR to assess for resolution of the basilar
opacities seen bilaterally, should be repeated in [**5-18**] weeks,
assuming clinical stability.
.
#Pyuria without evidence of UTI: Pt had indwelling Foley for
recurrent UTIs.  UA on admission showed 38 WBC, mod leukocyte
esterase, neg nitrites, no bacteria, 1 epi; no urinary symptoms
to suggest infection.  Urine cx was negative.
.
#H/o DVTs, on warfarin: INR 1.7 on admission; no missed home
doses per pt.  Given h/o multiple DVTs and CVA, pt was put on
lovenox bridge until INR in therapeutic range.  INR on discharge
on day of discharge is 1.6
.
#CAD s/p BMS to mid-RCA in [**12-19**] (repeat cath [**9-19**] showed <30%
in-stent restenosis), LVEF>55% per TTE [**6-21**].  Continued home
clopidogrel (pt allergic to ASA) and metoprolol.
.
#HLD: continued home atorvastatin.
.
#HTN: continued home nitrate.  Furosemide restarted after pt
gently volume-resuscitated.
.
#Type II IDDM: on insulin SS; continued home NPH.
.
#Seizure disorder: carbamazepine was in therapeutic range (8.2)
on admission.  Continued home carbamazepine.
.
#PVD s/p BKA: continued home baclofen for spasm.
.
#OSA: pt declined CPAP.
.
