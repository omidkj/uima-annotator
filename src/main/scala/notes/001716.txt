Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3853**]
Chief Complaint:
"Anemia."

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD: no source of bleeding found
Flexible sigmoidoscopy: radiation proctatitis with friable
mucosa which was cauterized (APC)


History of Present Illness:
88 y/o woman with MMP including AFib (off coumadin), dCHF, CVA,
multifactorial chronic anemia and chronic LGIB [**1-12**] radiation
proctitis after tx for vulvar cancer, single gastric fundic AVM
and gastritis, with numerous past admissions for GI bleed and
low HCT in past, admitted from nursing home yesterday after
having dark colored vomiting, dark red stool and low Hct.

Pt reports GI upset for several days, and has been producing
dark colored vomitus, possibly blood. Also reports dark stools
for several days (although has them chronically from iron
tablets). Hct was noted to be 19 with hgb of 6.1 in the nursing
home. She presented to the ED for transfusion and possible GI
bleed. Some fatigue and lightheadedness. No chest pain. Minimal
SOB.

Ms. [**Known lastname 47136**] has a long standing history of chronic anemia
requiring multiple admissions. She was most recently admitted in
[**Month (only) **] for anemia where an upper endoscopy demonstated no
significant lesions. Her hematocrit was stable and bleeding was
felt to be due to AVMs in the rectum which have been coagulated
in the past and were last coagulated in 12/[**2133**]. More recently
she was seen in the ED for anemia, her hct was stable without
evidence of obvious bleed so she was discharged back to her
nursing facility.

In the ED inital vitals were, T 100.0 HR 104 BP 102/66 RR 16
Satting 91% on RA. An initial hct was 20.8 (baseline 24-28) and
creatinine 0.7. An NG lavage demonstrated BRB with clots that
eventually cleared. She was started on IVF slowly given
diastolic heart failure and 2 units of pRBC were ordered and
hung prior to transfer. She was started on IV protonix gtt. SBPs
dipped into the high 80s but responded to fluids and blood
transfusion. GI was consulted who recommended transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
and upper endoscopy on arrival. Vitals on transfer were HR 120
BP 90/60 RR 20.

On arrival to the ICU,  initial vitals were 99.8 37.7 134 97% on
RA 21.  She was mentating normally and able to participate with
history and exam. She confirmed DNR/I status. In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], GI
performed EGD which didnt show any UGI source of bleeding. There
was no blood in the stomach.

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE
88 yo woman with MMP including AFib (off coumadin), dCHF, CVA,
dementia, multifactorial chronic anemia and chronic LGIB [**1-12**]
radiation proctitis after tx for vulvar cancer, single gastric
fundic AVM and gastritis, with numerous past admissions for GI
bleed and low HCT in past, admitted from nursing home after
having dark colored vomiting, dark red stool and low Hct with
positive NG tube lavage concerning for upper GI bleed.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES
# UGIB: Patient had BRB in NG lavage indicating UGI source. Most
likely ddx on admission included PUD vs gastric erosion vs
severe gastritis vs bleeding gastric AVM, a more rare cause is a
dieulafoy lesion. However, EGD did not show any source of
bleeding in the esophagus, stomach or proximal duodenum.
Patient received a total of 2 pRBC transfusions and hct
stabilized at her baseline in the high 20s (28).  She had melena
and BRBPR again on [**11-23**], and EGD repeated and again was
negative for a source.  Hct remained stable.  Flexible
sigmoidoscopy was performed and showed radiation proctitis with
a friable mucosa and areas of edema at the distal and
mid-rectum. An Argon-Plasma Coagulator was applied for
hemostasis
successfully.  The patient had some blood streaking in her BM's,
it was unclear if this was a vaginal source or GI source but her
hemoglobin was stable.
.
# Anemia: Pt has a long standing history of chronic anemia
requiring multiple admissions and is multifactorial [**1-12**] chronic
LGIB d/t radiation proctitis after tx for vulvar cancer, single
gastric fundic AVM and gastritis, with numerous past admissions
for GI bleed and low HCT in past. Baseline Hct 24-28. UGIB
treated as above.  Ferrous sulfate increased to TID with vitamin
C.
.
# Vulvar pain with a history of vulvar cancer s/p XRT in [**2130**]
Patient c/o persistent vulvar pain.  Physical exam not
consistent with atrophic vaginitis.  Gyn consult placed and they
advised placing the patient on lidocaine jelly, warm water [**Last Name (un) **]
baths, leave vulva open to air, and to avoid other topical
applications/irritants.  They also
