Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5552**]
Chief Complaint:
lower extremity swelling

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1.  Exploratory laparotomy.
2.  Enteroenterostomy of afferent pancreaticobiliary drainage
limb.
3.  Placement of a feeding jejunostomy tube into the afferent
limb distal to the stomach.


History of Present Illness:
62 yo F w/ metastatic pancreatic cancer s/p Whipple procedure in
[**2131**] currently C1D19 Gemcitabine presenting with 2-3 weeks of
leg swelling. She reports ~3 weeks of lower extremity swelling.
Per her oncologist, the swelling preceded initiation of
gemcitabine chmotherapy. She denies pain but feels that her legs
are heavy and she is having difficulty ambulating. She denies
redness, warmth, fevers, chills, sweats. She reports that the
amount of swelling has remained stable but over the past day her
legs have been blistering and weeping so she came to the ED.
She denies trauma. She denies shortness of breath, chest pain,
palpitations, PND, orthopnea, cough. She denies change in
urinary output, hematuria.
.
In the ED, she was HD stable with O2 Sats 100% RA. She was given
40 mg IV lasix.


Past Medical History:
Ms. [**Known lastname 14840**] has chronic pancreatitis with exocrine
and endocrine insufficiency, status post Whipple surgery by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 468**] in [**9-22**]. Pathology from this surgery revealed chronic
pancreatitis as well as low-grade dysplasia, pancreatic
intraepithelial neoplasm. Prior to surgery, her CA-19.9 was
measured at 13. She was doing fairly well until [**2-24**], when she
noted weight loss and abdominal pain similar to her previous
pancreatitis pain. At that time, MRI abdomen was notable for an
irregular duct but no stricture at the pancreaticojejunostomy
site.  By [**5-25**], her CA [**47**]-9 has risen from 13 to 143 as well as
her CEA was elevated at 4.6. She had an EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] on [**2135-6-14**],
notable for gastritis. She continued to note weight loss and
pain, so she had a CTA abd in [**9-25**] notable for a pancreatic
tail mass extending into the mesentery, occluding the splenic
vein and encasing the splenic artery. She underwent an EGD and
EUS which showed a 3 cm hypoechoic mass in the body of the
pancreas in [**10-25**]. FNA was c/w adenocarcinoma. She was seen by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**] who felt she was not a surgical candidate. She
started C1 Gemcitabine on [**2136-3-1**]. Her first cycle has been c/b
low counts, thrush treated with fluconazole and lower extremity
edema. She received C1D15 Gemcitabine on [**2136-3-15**].

.
PMH:
1. Chronic Pancreatitis as above. S/P Whipple in [**9-22**]. Now with
exocrine and endocrine dysfunction.
2. HTN


Social History:
(+) tobacco use - 20 pack year - currently [**4-26**] cigarettes per
day. She has no h/o alcohol use. She lives alone in [**Location (un) 2498**].


Family History:
Her mother and sister had breast cancer.  Her mother's mom had
stomach cancer and her mother's brother had liver cancer.

Neuro: CN 2-12 intact. UE [**3-24**]. LE - quads/hamstrings/DF/PF - [**3-24**]
if isolate and support feet which she reports are too heavy.
Unable to wiggle toes due to swelling.

Pertinent Results:
CXR - The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits,
and there is no pulmonary vascular congestion, pleural effusion,
or other evidence of CHF. Evidence of hyperinflation.
.
CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS [**2136-3-20**]:
1.  Dilated loop of excluded jejunum (s/p Whipple), which may be
due to the necrotic pancreatic tail mass, an adhesion, or
stricture/
swelling at the anastomotic site. This loop does appear to be
compressing the IVC at the level of the aortic bifurcation,
though no significant venous collaterals are seen suggesting
that there is not complete occlusion.
2.  Mild right hydronephrosis and hydroureter of unknown
etiology.
3.  Necrotic pancreatic tail mass which appears slightly smaller
than the prior exam, however, this may be due to distortion of
abdominal contents due to the dilated small bowel loops.
4.  Persistently thrombosed splenic vein with heterogeneous
enhancement of the spleen.
5.  Multiple hypodensities within the liver are poorly evaluated
due to contrast timing, however remain worrisome for metastases.

.
CXR [**2136-3-28**]: There has been further improved aeration in the left
lower lobe since the recent chest radiograph of [**2136-3-26**] and
more marked improvement when compared to the earlier radiograph
of [**3-21**].  Right lung is clear.  Bilateral pleural effusions are
present, left greater than right.
IMPRESSION:  Continued improved aeration in left lower lobe.
Bilateral
pleural effusions, left greater than right.
.
[**2136-3-29**] CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS:
1.  No definite thrombosis is noted within the IVC to suggest
thrombosis;
however, the infrarenal IVC is being pressed by a dilated loop
of jejunum,
which is unlikely to cause IVC obstruction since there is no
collateral
formation and no distal dilatation of iliac veins.
2.  New interval development of moderate bilateral pleural
effusion and
massive ascites  and anasarca suggest volume overload
state/heart failure as the cause of lower extemity edema .
3.  Unchanged appearance of mild right hydronephrosis and
hydroureter of
unknown etiology.
4.  Unchanged appearance of necrotic pancreatic tail mass.
5. Small hypodense liver lesion within the dome of the liverthat
is too small to characterize.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 62 yo F w/ pancreatic cancer on C1D19 Gemcitabine with
several weeks of LE swelling. Following admission, patient
underwent work-up for lower extremity edema.  Ultrasound of the
lower extremities was performed and negative for DVT.  CT of her
abdomen and pelvis revealed IVC compression by obstructed
afferent loop due to necrotic adenocarcinoma in tail of the
pancreas.  EGD was performed but not amenable to stent across
obstruction.  Following discussion with patient and family
regarding pursuing comfort measures care versus surgical
decompression, patient opted to undergo surgical intervention.
Enteroenterostomy of afferent pancreaticobiliary drainage limb
was performed, along with placement of a feeding jejunostomy
tube into the afferent limb distal to the stomach.  IVC filter
was placed on the firt post-operative day.  Her post-operative
course was complicated by hypothermia, hyponatremia, and
hypoglycemia.  She was treated with a 7-day course of
peri-operative prophylactic anbtibiotics.  She was transferred
back to the Oncology service on post-op day 5.  The following is
an outline of her ongoing medical issues:
.
1) Hyponatremia:  Serum sodium nadired at 126 in the
post-operative course.  Calculated FeNa 0.7 points to effective
intravascular volume depletion.  She was treated with normal
saline, NaCl tablets and free water restriction. On day of
discharge, her sodium serum was stable at 131.
.
2) Generalized anarsarca:  She developed new pleural effusions,
ascites, and generalized anasarca in the post-operative period,
likely the result of her hypoalbuminemia.  She also had so
