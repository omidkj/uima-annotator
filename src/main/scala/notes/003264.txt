Imaging:
ECHO ([**2134-4-7**]):
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 10-15mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
infero-lateral akinesis (EF 45%). No masses or thrombi are seen
in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of
moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Tricuspid
regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
ECHO ([**2134-4-21**]):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild to
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
severe hypokisis of the basal and mid inferior and inferolateral
walls. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 45 %).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**1-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with regional
systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Mild-moderate mitral
regurgitation. Dilated aortic root.  Compared with the prior
study (images reviewed) of [**2134-4-15**], the findings are similar.
.
CXR ([**2134-4-16**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Significant interval improvement in severity of pulmonary
edema.
2. New mild lingular atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
CCU Course:
68 yo female with hx of inferior MI, PVD, DMII, now s/p CEA on
left on [**2134-4-6**] transferred to the CCU on [**2134-4-8**] with s/s of
CHF secondary to iv fluid administration and new mitral
regurgitation.

# PUMP: Patient was admitted to the CCU with signs and symptoms
of CHF. Her echo on [**4-7**] showed EF 45% along with severe mitral
regurgitation. She also had an elevated BNP and CXR that showed
pulm edema. On admission to the CCU, her weight was up 8 kg from
admission. This weight gain was likely caused by IVF given for
hypotension post op. She was started on diuresis with iv lasix,
lasix drip and diuril with limited effect. Her diuresis was
improved when she was wearing her BIPAP mask but she had
difficulty tolerating this mask. Her severe mitral regurgitation
likely contributed to the difficulty with diuresis as she had
limited forward flow. She was intubated on [**2134-4-11**] for
persistent hypoxia, difficulty tolerating BIPAP mask. She was
also started o
