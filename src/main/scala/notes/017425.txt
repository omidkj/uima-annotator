HOSPITAL COURSE:  So patient was preopped for liver

Electrocardiogram: Sinus rhythm, no acute changes, poor R
wave progression. Patient was placed on antibiotics and seen
for the operating room. Solu-Medrol and MMF were ordered.
Laboratories were obtained. WBC 9.4, hematocrit 38.2, INR
1.4. AST 60, ALT 28, alkaline phosphatase 305, total
bilirubin 0.2, sodium 123, 4.8, 101, 14, BUN/creatinine
56/1.2. The patient went to the operating room on [**2198-3-22**] in which an orthotopic liver transplant, piggyback
technique, common duct to common duct. No T tube portal vein
to portal anastomosis and aortic conduit for arterial inflow
performed by Drs. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 816**]. Please see
detailed informed regarding operative note. Postoperatively
he went to the Intensive Care Unit. Patient received 2 units
of packed blood red blood cells, 2 units of fresh frozen
plasma. Patient was placed on Unasyn, incentive air, heparin,
insulin, Solu-Medrol, MMF was given. Postoperatively patient
was in Intensive Care Unit for 4 days. On [**2198-3-24**]
laboratories were as follows: WBC of 13, hematocrit of 29.4,
platelets 87, sodium 136, 4.1, 106, 24, 34, creatinine 0.8,
glucose 117. AST is 468, ALT 353, alkaline phosphatase 73,
total bilirubin 1.1. Ultrasound was done [**2198-3-23**] which
demonstrated an unremarkable appearance of the transplanted
liver with patency of the major hepatic portal veins and
hepatic arteries. Last day in Intensive Care Unit was on
[**2198-3-25**]. On [**2198-3-26**] patient had a CT of the
chest because patient required increased oxygen demonstrating
a widespread ground glass opacities with intralobular
thickening "crazy-paving" pattern. Considering its acute
onset the major differential considerations are pulmonary
edema, hemorrhage, atypical infection. Radiologist: Bilateral
small to moderate amount of pleural effusions. Post surgical
changes in the upper abdomen, distended stomach with no
nasogastric tube insertion. Patient was placed on Zosyn and
Vancomycin. Patient received Unasyn for 4 days, Zosyn for 2
days and Vancomycin for 2 days. Patient was on ganciclovir
for a total of 9 days, continued on fluconazole, heparin
subcutaneously, morphine, Protonix, Bactrim, Dilaudid and
patient was on Levaquin for 3 days. Pulmonary medicine was
consulted because of the finding on the CT of the chest. It
was thought that patient was volume overloaded and
recommended keeping the patient when .5 to 1.0 liters
negative. Infectious disease was also consulted for pulmonary
infiltrate. After diuresing chest x-ray was obtained on [**2198-3-27**] demonstrating that this previous pulmonary edema has
been markedly improved. There is probably a small right
pleural effusion. Pulmonary had felt that the findings on the
chest x-ray was most likely related to congestive heart
failure rather than atypical infection and that at that point
they would not recommend a bronchoscopy. On [**2198-3-28**]
another chest x-ray was obtained demonstrating resolving
pulmonary edema, small bilateral effusions. Patient was
saturating well making good ins and outs. On [**2198-3-28**],
postoperative day 6, hospital day 7 prescription was written
for prednisone 20, MMF 1 gram b.i.d. Afebrile, vital signs
stable. Making good ins and outs. Urine output was 1425.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**] with recent lateral drained [**2177**]. Levaquin was
stopped per infectious disease. Patient was out of bed,
ambulating well, eating well. On [**2198-3-29**] laboratories
were the following: WBC 9.7, hematocrit 27.9, 61, 137, 4.6,
106, 25. BUN/creatinine 41/1.2, glucose 94, AST 31, ALT 77,
alkaline phosphatase 100, total bilirubin 0.4, INR is 0.9.
Patient's level on [**3-29**] was 12.2. patient was receiving 4
and 4. On [**2198-3-30**] patient continued to do well, was
saturating well, afebrile, vital signs stable. So on [**2198-3-30**] patient was discharged home on the following
medications: Fluconazole 400 mg q day, prednisone 20 mg q
day, Bactrim SS 1 tablet q day, Protonix 40 mg q day, MMF
1,000 mg b.i.d., tacrolimus 400 mg b.i.d., Dilaudid 1 to 2
tablets q 3 to 4 hours p.r.n., potassium 900 mg q day.

Patient did not need any services. Patient has appointments
with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for the following dates: [**2198-4-2**] at 10:40 A.M., [**2198-4-9**] at 11:40 A.M., [**2198-4-16**] at 11:20 A.M. The patient was instructed to call
transplant surgery immediately at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**] for any
fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and to call
immediately if he is unable to drink or having difficulty
with urination or if there is any increased redness of the
incision or any discharge or edema. Patient was to have
laboratories every Monday and Thursday in which a CBC, chem-
10, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, total bilirubin
and Prograf level are to be drain. Results should be faxed
immediately to the transplant service.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Alcoholic cirrhosis, status post liver
transplant [**2198-3-22**].

SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  Congestive heart failure.
