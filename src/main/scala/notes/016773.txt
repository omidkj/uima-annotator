Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9853**]
Chief Complaint:
COPD exacerbation/hyponatremia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation and extubation


History of Present Illness:
This is a 66 year-old Male w/ Stage IV COPD on home O2, HTN,
h.o. UGI bld, + MRSA and Pseudomonas in sputum during recent
admission at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] who presented to the ED from rehab for
suspected COPD exacerbation.

Pt was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] for complaints of
wheezing and worsening dyspnea. His dyspnea was attributed to
COPD exacerbation likely [**3-4**] tracehobronchitis. Following +
culture of Pseudomonas pt was treated with a 10 day course of
[**Name (NI) 97361**], pt also had sputums + for MRSA that was thought to
be a colonizer. It does appear though that he was discharged on
a 5 day course of Bactrim per ID recs for MRSA.  Pt was
initially noted to be on Prednisone 60mg daily upon that
admission that was self-titrated without consulting a physician,
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] discharge he was given a steroid taper.

Since his discharge on [**2-11**], the patient had been reporting
increasing tightness in his chest and shortness of breath.  His
wife notes that he had not slept for at least 48 hours due to
his persistent respiratory discomfort.  Additionally, he had
been eating minimally, and had begun to develop increased lower
extremity, worse than ever in the past.  Of note, lasix had been
discontinued during his most recent admission due to
hyponatremia to 133 and hypovolemia. However, the patient's wife
believes it was restarted yesterday due to his progressive lower
extremity edema and decreased urine output.  Records from the
nursing home are not available at this time.

The patient's family also notes that he had been mildly
confused, even before discharge from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**], however, this
has worsened in the last 24 hours.  He had been having
hallucinations and talking to people who were not in the room.
Additionally, he had been "pretend eating," and not fully
oriented.  Of note, he had also been complaining of back pain,
so had been receiving increased doses of percocet since his
discharge as well.

In the ED, initial vitals showed T 97.6 BP 162/85 HR 98 RR 18
satting 97% on 2L NC.  He was noted to have increased work of
breathing. Initially this was thought to be related to a CHF
exacerbation so nitropaste was placed on the patient without
improvement.  He was trialed on CPAP which he did not tolerate,
and he was satting 100% on NRB.  80 mg lasix were given without
improvement, so patient was intubated due to increased work of
breathing after discussing intubation with his wife and daughter
(however, patient has been DNI in the past).  He was then placed
on a Nitro gtt which was discontinued prior to arrival to the
ICU.  He was also given ctx and levaquin for possible infection.
 CTA was done which showed no PE and a possible recent
aspiration on prelim read.  He was observed having myoclonic
jerking during his CTA scan, and neurology was curbsided to
ensure that this was not seizure activity due to his
hyponatremia.  A CT scan of the head was done to look for
possible etiology.  He also rec'd 1/2 L of NS for his
hyponatremia prior to transfer.

Patient arrived to the ICU intubated and sedated.

Brief Hospital Course:
66 year-old male with severe COPD and recent admission for COPD
exacerbation who was admitted intubated after experiencing
increased WOB and hyponatremia.

#. Respiratory failure: Pt presented to the ED with complaints
of dyspnea, upon assessment required intubation currently on
ventilatory support. Pt has a history of dyspnea that improves
only with an increase in his steroid doses. His last spirometry
in [**2114-12-26**] showed Stage IV COPD with an FEV1 28%; FEV1/FVC 55%.
 He did not improve with diuresis, nitro page or nitro gtt, so
this did not likely represent a CHF exacerbation. Also BNP was
low at 364. Had recent admission for COPD exacerbation and was
treated with 10 days of ceftaz and 5 days of Bactrim for
pseudomonas/MRSA + sputum.  Patient presumed to have COPD
exacerbation wasn was treated with iv solumedrol and
transitioned to po prednisone.    Patient did not appear to have
much of a cough or sputum production prior to intubation.
However, he does have evidence of infiltrate on CT scan, ? new
aspiration.  He was treated with vanc/zosyn for PNA given gram +
rods in his sputum cx and hx of MRSA in his sputum.  MRSA was
felt to be a colonizer and Vanc was disconti
