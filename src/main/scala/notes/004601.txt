History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 66 year old male with PMH of HTN, s/p knee surgeries,
recently discharged from the hospital after treatment of
pericardial effusion and anasarca. He was treated with a
pericardial drain and diuresis with Lasix. He was discharged
with 3 more days of lasix and prescriptions for meloxicam and
omeprazole. He noted his weight was 1.5 lb heavier than
yesterday, with development of a new rash. Pt presented to hism
physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] then referred him to the ED for evaluation.
.
The patient initially presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**8-19**] with left leg
and scrotal swelling. He was noted to have a pericardial
effusion and hypovolemic hyponatremia in the setting of poor
cardiac output. He was treated with a pericardial drain.
Hyponatremia slowly improved with fluids and treatment of
pericardial effusion. He  first noted weight gain developing
after left knee replacement on [**2132-7-10**]. CTV done to eval for
thrombosis, not ideal timing of contrast to establish presence
of IVC clot, incidentally a large pericardial effusion, free
fluid in abdomen and pleural effusions were found. TTE without
tamponade physiology, large RA/RV, raised the question of
pulmonary embolism. He underwent CTA which was negative for PE
or aortic dissecction but showed persistent pericardial effusion
and bilateral pleural effusions. He was admitted to theICU for
pericardial drain, then transferred to the floor. Etiology of
pericarditis remained unclear.

Past Medical History:
Benign lesion removed from his right breast [**2125**]
s/p 3 knee surgeries, LTR [**2132-7-20**]
Normal stress test in [**2127**]
Hyperlipidemia
Pre-malignant skin lesions
Tendonitis
HTN

Social History:
Retired IRS attorney. Now runs own business as CPA/tax lawyer.
Lives with wife. 2 grown children.
[**Country 3992**] veteran.
No h/o incarceration or known TB exposures.
No IVDU.
Very distant smoking history.

Family History:
He has a strong family history of coronary artery disease.
Father died of MI at age 51.


Physical Exam:
A & 0 x 3. VSS, afebrile. BP104/71
Cor- crisp heart sounds. SR @85.
Lungs- clear. Sternum stable, cleans dry and intact incision.
Abd- benign.
Exts- trace edema RLE. Scant serous drainage from JP site. EVH
incisions intact.


Pertinent Results:
Echo [**2132-8-27**]
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The right ventricular cavity is dilated There is abnormal septal
motion suggestive of pericardial constriction. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is a small pericardial effusion. The
effusion appears circumferential. The effusion is echo dense,
consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
The pericardium may be thickened. The echo findings are
suggestive but not diagnostic of pericardial constriction.

IMPRESSION: Smalll, circumferential, echo dense effusion. The
pericardium appears thickened. There is no evidence of
pericardial tamponade however the thickened pericardium and
septal "bounce" are suggestive of constriction. Mitral and
tricuspid inflows however do not confirm this possibility. If
constriction is being considered, a cardiac MR can help to
characterize the thickness of the pericardium and the presence
of constriction.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2132-8-25**],
the findings are similar. The mitral and tricuspid inflows are
not diagnostic of constriction on either study.

Brief Hospital Course:
Cardiac cath done [**9-2**] revealed LM and LAD dz. He was referred
for surgery and underwent cabg/pericardial stripping on [**9-4**] with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**]. He was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition
on no pressors.

Within 24 hours, Mr. [**Known lastname **] awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated. Aspirin, a statin and beta blockade were resumed. His
chest tubes were left in place as he continued to drain from
them. On postoperative day three, he was trnasferred to the step
down unit for further recovery. he was gently diuresed towards
his preoperative weight. CTs were seperated and mediastinal
drains were removed. Pleural tubes and the right leg JP
continued to have copious outputs.  Motrin was begun, Lasix dose
was increased and a fluid restriction was instituted.  Nacl
tablets were given also to correct his low sodium level.
The physical therapy service was consulted for assistance with
his postoperative strength and mobility.

His edema improved, sodium rose and weight fell with these
treatments.  The Left CTwas removed on POD6, the right drain on
POD9. Nacl tablets were stopped when sodium rose to 134 . The JP
drain was removed the day of discharge. POD 11 he was discharged
home with VNA. All follow-up appointments were advised.
