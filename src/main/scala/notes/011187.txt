1g, 2g cefepime, and levoflox 750mg, though the levoflox was
stopped [**1-2**] way through due to reddness at PIV site. She was

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 93738**] is an 85 yo F with dementia, depression, PUD,
dysphagia admitted from nursing home with bilateral lower lobe
pneumonia.  She completed a course of vancomycin and cefepime
for her PNA and developed c.diff colitis while in the hospital
requiring treatment with oral vancomycin and IV flagyl. She will
need to continue oral flagyl 500mg tid until [**4-29**].
.
1)Healthcare Associated Pneumonia: Confirmed based on clinical
picture with cough, hypoxia, and also with bilateral infiltrates
on CXR. Since patient comes from [**Location **], must be concerned for HAP
and therefore resistant pathogens.  No obvious pleural effusion
on CXR. No other obvious sources of infection. BNP elevated
though no priors to compare.  She was initially transferred to
the ICU given concern for oxygen requirement and possible
decompensation given her age.  She did well and did not develop
SIRS/sepsis or significant respiratory distress.  She was stable
for floor transfer the morning following admission however
stayed in the ICU for 2 days given lack of floor beds.  Sputum
from admission with GPC's in pairs and clusters as well as
GNR's, speciation revealed MRSA and pan-sensitive Klebsiella.
She completed a course of Vancomycin and Cefepime (was also
initially on levofloxacin which was discontinued). Pt was
evaluated by Speech/Swallow service and it was determined that
she should be supervised during all meals, she should have a
soft dysphgia diet, and can have regular thin liquids.
.
2) CDIFF colitis: likely developed as a consequence of treatment
with broad spectrum antibiotics for PNA. WBC continued to rise
and peaked at 28 with treatment with po flagyl, thus oral
vancomycin and IV flagyl were given concurrently for seven days
and her white count returned to [**Location 213**]. An abdominal CT was done
demonstrating prominent rectal wall thickening (which was
described as unusual for c.diff).  At the time of discharge,
oral vancomycin can be discontinued, but oral flagyl
(metronidazole) should be continued at 500mg TID until [**4-29**]. WBC and anion gap should be monitored every two days until
completion of flagyl course.
.
3)Anemia: She has h/o iron deficiency anemia.  HCT on admission
at baseline, with slight drop on the morning of [**4-10**], however no
signs of bleeding with guaiac negative stools. Iron low (13),
ferritin wnl, TIBC low normal (likely mixed deficiency / chronic
dz). Once bowel movements return to normal, please initiate iron
supplementation.
.
4) SKIN RASH: On perineum and sacral area. Incontinent and
requires frequnet sheet/diaper changes. Rash appears fungal,
continue miconazole powder until rash significantly improved.
.
5) Dementia: Cont Zyprexa, mirtazapine. Her daughter does not
accept this diagnosis.
6) HTN: Pt with no prior hx of HTN, BP has been in 150-160/80-90
range. Did not start antiHTN in the setting of acute illness,
would consider adding antiHTN if high BPs persist.
7) Depression: Cont mirtazapine, lexapro.
8) S/p unhealed humeral fx (last year): Cont tylenol for pain
control. Please hold Percocet until bowel movts return to
normal.
8) PUD: Cont PPI
