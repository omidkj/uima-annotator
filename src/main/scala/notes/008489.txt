History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 3646**] is a 50F with cirrhosis of unproven etiology, h/o
perforated duodenal ulcer [**12-9**] who has had weakness and back
pain with cough and shortness of breath for 2 days.  She has
chronic low back pain, but this is in a different location.  She
also reports fever and chills.  She reports increasing weakness
and fatigue over the same amount of time.  She is followed by
VNA who saw her at home and secondary to hypotension and hypoxia
requested she go to ED.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: afebrile, 95/75 114  18  and o2 sat
unable to be read.  CT of Torso showed pneumonia, but no
abdominal pathology.  She was seen by surgery.  She was found to
be significantly hypoxic and started on NRB.  A Right IJ was
placed.  She was started on Levophed after a drop in her
pressures.
.
In the MICU she is conversant and able to tell her story.

Imaging:
[**2160-2-29**] CT chest, abd, pelvis: IMPRESSION:
1. No etiology for abdominal pain identified. No free air is
noted within
the abdomen.
2. Interval increase in diffuse anasarca and bilateral pleural
effusions,
small on the right and small-to-moderate on the left.
Compressive atelectasis and new bilateral lower lobe pneumonias.

3. Interval improvement in the degree of mediastinal
lymphadenopathy.
4. Interval development of small pericardial effusion. No CT
findings to
suggest tamponade.
.
[**2160-3-3**] TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The estimated
cardiac index is borderline low (2.0-2.5L/min/m2). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated
with severe global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal
septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild-moderate
tricuspid regurgitatiaon. There is severe pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a small, circumferential
pericardial effusion without echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2159-7-11**], the
overall findings are similar.
.
[**2160-3-6**] CT abd, pelvis: IMPRESSION:
1. Anasarca. Increased bilateral pleural effusions, small to
moderate, right greater than left. Trace pericardial fluid.
2. Increased left lower lobe collapse/consolidation. Right
basilar
atelectasis has also increased.
3. New ascites. No free air.
4. Dilated fluid-filled colon and rectum. No wall thickening to
suggest
colitis.
5. No evidence of small bowel obstruction.
.
[**2160-3-8**] Bilat upper extremities venous ultrasound: IMPRESSION:
Non-occlusive right subclavian deep vein thrombosis.
.
[**2160-3-8**] CTA Chest: IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism to the subsegmental level.
2. Anasarca. Moderate-to-large left and moderate right pleural
effusion.
Small pericardial effusion.
3. Unchanged right ventricle and right atrium enlargement since
[**2160-3-6**]. Enlarged main pulmonary artery could be due to pulmonary
hypertension.
4. Complete collapse of the left lower lobe, pneumonia cannot be
ruled out. Right basilar atelectasis.
.
[**2160-3-10**] KUB: IMPRESSION:
Unchanged borderline distended colon. No evidence of small-bowel
obstruction or ileus.





Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 50F with severe pulmonary hypertension, h/o duodenal
perf s/p surgical repair [**2160-12-29**], cirrhosis of unknown etiology
and h/o polysubstance abuse who presented with septic shock
secondary pneumonia with respiratory distress.
.
# Septic Shock/ pneumonia: fever, hypotension, tachycardia,
hypoxia, leukocytosis, with LLL infiltrate.  Initially, pt was
treated for both health-care associated pneumonia and possible
C. Diff infection given WBC 60 on admission. However, C diff
treatment was stopped after patient tested negative x3. She
completed a 7 day course of Vancomycin/Zosyn on [**3-8**] for
pneumonia. She did initially require non-rebreather in the ICU
but for the last week prior to discharge, she has had stable O2
sats to mid 90's on nasal cannula. She did also require pressors
for the first several days of this hospitalization but was
successfully weaned off pressors approximately 1 wk prior to
discharge. At the time of discharge, she is maintaining stable
BP's 100s-110s/doppler.
Due to repeated IVF boluses for hypotension during this
