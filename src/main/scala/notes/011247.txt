Imaging:
CXR:
The patient is status post right upper lobectomy and partial
right chest wall resection. There has been interval development
of an area of consolidation predominantly involving the superior
segment of the right lower lobe but probably involving a small
portion of the right middle lobe as well. The left lung remains
grossly clear. No definite pleural effusions are identified in
the costophrenic sulci, but there may be a small amount of
loculated fluid at the right apex contiguous with the area of
consolidation. Skeletal structures reveal stable postoperative
deformities in the right second and third posterior ribs.

IMPRESSION: New consolidation within superior segment of right
lower lobe and to a lesser degree in the right middle lobe,
consistent with pneumonia. Follow-up radiographs are recommended
to ensure resolution following appropriate therapy.
.
EKG: Sinus tachycardia with hetrogenous P wave morphology
possibly indicative multifocal atrial tachycardia. Diffuse
non-diagnostic repolarization abnormalities. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2171-10-23**] heart rate now increased.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 62 y F with h/o squamous cell lung CA s/p
induction chemotherapy, radiation and surgical resection [RUL
lobectomy] as well as COPD who presents to ED with PNA as seen
on CXR admit to MICU for sepsis and now HD stable on abx.
.
# PNA - See above for MICU course.  Pt. d/c from MICU once HD
stable, oxygenating well.  Never intubated and never was on
pressors.  Continued patient on ceftriaxone on floor and then
switched to levofloxacin to finish total 10 day course ([**1-19**]).
Scheduled for f/u with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 553**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in [**Hospital 191**] clinic on [**1-16**].
.
# Hyponatremia: Thought related to dehydration and hypovolemia.
Na resolved with rehydration.
.
# COPD: By history but restrictive by PFTs. Treated with
nebulizer treatments.  O2 sat well maintained in mid 90s on the
floor on room air.  No steroids given.
.
# DM2: Held metformin during hospitalization.  Treated with
RISS.
.
# CAD s/p MI-PTCA: continued ASA, betablocker, statin.
.
On day of discharge patient noted to have pink swelling over
surgical scar right upper chest.  Given pt. afebrile with
dropping WBC and no sign of HD instability and no sign of
cellulitis at site, felt that this was not infectious in nature.
 Thought that may be related to disruption in venous return [**1-23**]
R IJ location right above scar.  Told patient that she must f/u
in [**Hospital 191**] clinic on Thursday to have scar examined to determine if
ultrasound necessary for DVT.  On d/c no evidence of DVT - no
assymetrical swelling of arms, 2+ radial pulses b/l.  No
weeping, purulence, drainage, bright erythema over the area.
.
Pt also complained of feeling depressed re: multiple personal
issues.  Started pt. on 10qd flouxetine and told pt. to schedule
f/u ap
