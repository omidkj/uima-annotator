Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 603**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
82 year old male with HTN, chronic CHF, and COPD BIBA after
developing SOB. Pt has noted increasing SOB on exertion over the
past week. Has also noted occasional episodes of diarrhea and
rare short bouts of chest pain. Increasing DOE on exertion
yesterday. Today walked to his car and was so short of breath he
leaned on the [**Doctor Last Name 534**] to attract attention for help. A neighbor
came and found him and called an ambulance.
.
Of note pt was also admitted [**2190-1-30**] for SOB, c/w CHF
exacerbation, responded to lasix.
.
When EMS arrived they noted his BP to be 200/100.
.
In the ED inital vitals were HR: 100 BP: 134/109 Resp: 34
O(2)Sat: 92 (CPAP)low. Labs showed CBC 8.2>35.0<202 (bl hct
around 36). 7.8% eos 56% pmns. chem panel
141/4.6;103/23;21/1.3<243. lactate 5.4 --> 1.6. trop <0.01. BNP
4453 (down from >10K). UA positive for lg blood, 100 pro, TR
glu, RBC>182 WBC 133, few bact. pt was immediately placed on
BiPAP. In the emergency department he was given BiPAP and
nitroglycerin drip in addition to 40 of Lasix IV. Pt was
admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for respiratory distress.
.
On arrival to the ICU, pt sates he feels improved but remains
wheezy on exam. Is able to speak in full sentences comfortably
and satting high 90s. Is talking to his wife on the phone.

.
Urine culture [**2191-5-9**]: NO GROWTH.
Blood cultures [**2191-5-9**]: no growth.
.
EKG [**2191-5-9**]: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
compared to the previous tracing of [**2190-2-5**] atrial fibrillation
is now recorded. Otherwise, no diagnostic interim change.
.
CXR (portable AP) [**2191-5-10**]: Findings compatible with mild
congestive heart failure. Recommend followup after treatment to
evaluate for underlying infection.
.
CXR (portable AP) [**2191-5-10**]: There is mild increase of mild
pulmonary edema. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. There are
persistent low lung volumes. There is no pneumothorax. There is
mild increase in left lower atelectasis.
.
TTE [**2191-5-10**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral
valve leaflets are elongated. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with normal global and regional
biventricular systolic function. Moderate aortic regurgitation.
At least mild mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2190-2-5**], the
findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
82 y/o M history of HTN found with respiratory distress
requiring bipap, hypertension, and newly noted to be in new
atrial fibrillation.
.
#Respiratory distress/SOB: The patient's shortness of breath was
felt to be due to a combination of heart failure and COPD
exacerbation, discussed separately below. There was also concern
for possible pneumonia on initial CXR, but the patient remained
afebrile, and follow-up CXR showed no infiltrate. At the time of
discharge, the patient was able to maintain good oxygenation
saturations with ambulation on room air.
.
#Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient presented
with shortness of breath. Cardiac enzymes were negative. He was
initially treated with lasix, bipap, and nitro gtt, although he
did not appear grossly volume overloaded. As his respiratory
status improved, he was transitioned to oral furosemide. TTE
showed preserved systolic function, and was unchanged from prior
study.
.
#COPD exacerbation: The patient presented with shortness of
breath and diffuse wheezing in the setting of a smoking history.
He was noted to have symbicort on his medication list but was
not taking this currently. He was given azithromycin x 5 days,
nebulizers, and was started on a prednisone taper. The plan for
the remainder of the taper is as follows: 20 mg daily [**Date range (1) 604**],
10 mg daily [**Date range (1) 605**], 5 mg daily [**Date range (1) 606**]. Symbicort and
Spiriva were started. The patient was ur
