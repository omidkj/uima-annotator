Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
62 yo male with left-sided stage IV lung CA metastatic to bone
diagnosed earlier this year now with embolic stroke leading to
MVA with splenic laceration. Was recovering at [**Hospital **]
Hosp/Rehab when developed worsening SOB. Transferred here and
was found to have new right pleural effusion, near obliteration
of secondary right bronchi from tumor, multiple large left
pulmonary artery emboli. Started on heparin drip, received levo
500/flagyl 500/ vanco 1g, and transferred to MICU. ABG on 2
liters n/c was 7.44/35/84. Never hypotensive. There felt to have
component of aspiration pneumonia (failed speech/swallow
multiple times) as well and was started on levo/flagyl. Decision
was made with patient and family to continue with
anticoagulation and antibiotics but to pursue no further
escalation of care (thoracentesis, IVC filter).
TTE showed no ASD but no bubble study has been performed.
Presently requiring 4L NC oxygen, tachy to 120, and requiring
intermittent morphine for SOB. Gets dyspneic with minimal
activity (turning in bed). Admit O2 requirment was only 2L nc.
Has been having low grade temps felt to be related to aspiration
pneumonia +/- postobstructive pneumonia.
Family feels goals of care are primarily comfort measures,
patient not willing to stop other medical treatments.

Brief Hospital Course:
62 y/o man with metastatic lung cancer (bone) now with likely
malignant pleural effusion, obstructive/aspiration pneumonia,
and large pulmonary emboli admitted to the MICU.  Hospital
course outlined below:

1. SOB - multifactorial.  His well ventilated lung on the left
was filled with pulmonary emboli.  His right lung was nearly
obstructive at the secondary bronchi from tumor and his pleural
cavity filled with a likely malignant pleural effusion.  He was
started on a heparin drip.  Despite this his O2 requirement
continued to rise and he became progressively more short of
breath.  Given the risk of bleeding and pneumothorax in his
already critical state, it was decided by the ICU to not pursue
any further invasive strategies (thoracentesis, etc).  This was
discussed with the family/health care proxy (wife), and patient.
 Comfort measures were pursued and anticoagulation/antibiotics
were discontinued.

2.  Fevers - Likely from aspiration and possibly postobstructive
pneumonia.  He failed multiple speech and swallow studies at the
bedside, and continue to have fevers despite receiving
antibiotics.  Aspiration had been occuring from his recent
stroke.  Given his critical state it was decided to stop
antibiotics and treat him to bring him comfort and ease his
pain.  Pt expired on [**2184-6-14**].
