ECHO Study Date of [**2139-4-8**]
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The right ventricle appears dilated. Right
ventricular systolic function is normal. There are simple
atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in
the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic
valve. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is  seen. A bioprosthetic
mitral valve prosthesis is present with lateral
rocking/separation from the mitral annulus consistent with
dehiscense with associated paravalvular mitral regurgitation.
There are small echodense structures associated with the
prosthetic ring which may represent suture material. No definite
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet is
eccentric. The tricuspid valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. No vegetation/mass is seen on the
pulmonic valve. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is no
pericardial effusion. Compared to the prior transesophageal
study of [**2139-2-10**], the previously noted vegetations are not
present in the current study. Dehiscense of the lateral border
of the prosthetic mitral valve is new.
.
US Liver: The liver is normal in echotexture without evidence of
focal hepatic masses. There is no intrahepatic biliary duct
dilatation. The left, middle, and right hepatic veins are all
patent and demonstrate normal venous waveforms. The portal vein
is patent and demonstrates normal hepatopetal flow. The main
hepatic artery, and branches of the left and right posterior
hepatic arteries are all patent and demonstrate normal arterial
waveforms.
.
Liver Bx [**2139-4-15**]
1. Prominent centrolobular hemorrhage with associated
hepatocellular necrosis, hemosiderin-laden macrophages and
nodular regenerative hyperplasia; see note.
2. Necrotic hepatocytes compose approximately 20% of the biopsy.
3. Trichrome stain shows minimal centrivenular fibrosis, no
significant portal fibrosis.
4. No stainable iron seen on iron stain.

Brief Hospital Course:
51F with porcine MVR dehiscence s/p MRSA endocarditis [**2-25**]
sternal wound infection after MVR 3 months ago.
MRSA Endocarditis: Now cleared on [**4-8**] TEE after vanco x8wks and
gent & rifampin x2wks; however, dehiscence of porcine appeared.
Pt p/w heart failure and hepatic failure that has been treated.
Heart and hepatic function are now optimized with reversal of
coagulopathy and improvement in thrombocytopenia. BCx [**4-6**] x3
and [**4-8**] negative,including mycolytic. C. diff negative x3.
Hepatic Failure/Encephalopathy: Transaminitis, hyperuricemia,
coagulopathy, reduced synthetic fxn all improved. Likely [**2-25**]
worsening dCHF. Abd u/s with normal appearing liver and patent
vessels. Hepatitis serologies and HCV viral load. AFP and IgG
normal. [**Doctor First Name **] negative. [**Last Name (un) 15412**] positive.
-liver bx consistent with recovery from episode of CHF induced
hepatocellular damage from which complete recovery may be
expected.  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] underwent aggressive diuresis and
treatment of her heart failure preoperatively, which included an
intra aortic balloon pump and inotropic therapy.  Once she was
cleared by the hepatology service, she was taken to the
operating room on [**4-28**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for a redo MVR via R
thoracotomy with a 27mm mosaic valve.  She also required a R
femoral artery thrombectomy by vascular surgery.  Post
operatively she was started on epinephrine, milrinone and
inhaled nitric oxide, continued with her IABP and transferred to
the ICU in stable condition.  She was seen by vascular surgery
on POD#1 because her L foot was cool.  It was recommended that
the IABP be removed, this was done with improvement in her
vascular exam.  She was started on heparin for anticoagulation.
She was started on fluconazole postoperatively because it was
noted that she had a rash consistent with yeast on her chest,
this was continued for 14 days postoperatively per the
infectious disease team.  Her nitric oxide and milrinone were
weaned over the next several days, her support from the
ventilator was decreased, and she was extubated on POD#4 without
difficulty.  She was started on Natrecor and aggressive diuretic
therapy to achieve diuresis.  She had been started on amiodarone
for atrial fibrillation, which she had a few short episodes
postoperatively.  She was transferred from the ICU on POD#9.
Her anticoagulation was discontinued on POD#14.  She underwent
an ech
