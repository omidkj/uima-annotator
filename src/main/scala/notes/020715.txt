Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**]
Chief Complaint:
Right sided weakness and language disturbance

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Percutaneous tracheostomy with a bronchoscopy.
2. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy.
3. Left-sided craniotomy for decompression.
4. Hemicraniectomy.
5. Temporal lobectomy.
6. Duraplasty.


History of Present Illness:
39 year old female with h/o headaches and possible
hypertension presents with right arm weakness and inability to
communicate.  She was last seen normal yesterday at 11:00pm when
she went to bed.  She usually wakes up at 5:30am in the morning
to
walk the dog. She usually walks the dog in her pajamas. Her
husband did not hear her get up this morning and is not sure
whether she actually did walk the dog.  At 5:41, she shook her
husband to awaken him and could not say any words.
She was still in her pajamas at that time. She was able to walk
with his support, then had a one-minute episode of generalized
shaking.

She was initially brought to [**Hospital6 3105**], where
she
received lorazepam 2mg, phenytoin, and solumedrol 125mg.  CT
showed an asymmetrical dense left MCA sign, and the patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

ROS: She started a new medication a few weeks ago for headaches.

She developed green discharge from the eyes when this medication
was started; this has now resolved.  2-3x over the last month
she
has had a sensation that objects around her were moving.  2x
over
the last month she has choked on her food.  At baseline she has
decreased strength in her right hand from her carpal tunnel
syndrome.  She has been limping for 2 days.  She frequently
moves
around to prevent her headaches.  She
occasionally has constipation, for which she takes Miralax.  She
has not had any blood in her stool or urine.  Denies recent
problems with fever, vision, hearing, cough, vomiting, weakness,
or paresthesias.



Past Medical History:
- Chronic headaches after being hit on the head by a child in a
special education class she was teaching 3-5 years ago.
- S/p right carpal tunnel release
- S/p hysterectomy 3 years ago
- Question of hypertension.  Family denies this and reports
sometimes her blood pressure goes low, but the patient is on
Cardizem and reports sometimes the doctors put [**Name5 (PTitle) **] on
medications
without a clearly known reason.
- No prior seizures, stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, or recent
surgeries


Social History:
Works as a special education teacher.  Husband, daughter, and
sister at bedside.  Denies ETOH, smoking, illicits.


Family History:
Sister had a stroke at age 33; she does not know the cause of
this.  Sister has also had a DVT and headaches.  Dad had a
stroke
at age 62.

DISCHARGE EXAM
T 97.4 P 88 BP 113/66 R 18 SpO2 100%
GEN: lying in bed, alert but not verbal

Pertinent Results:
CT perfusion:
1. Thrombus within the distal left M1 segment with poor filling
of left
anterior temporal branches. The focal moderate stenosis of the
left internal
carotid artery origin, with no other evidence of vascular
atherosclerosis, may
represent a dissection or intramural hematoma and may be a
source of this
thrombus.

2. CT perfusion reveals a very small region of relatively
preserved CBV and CBF with in the most posterior/superior region
of the prolonged MTT which may represent a small area of
ischemic penumbra. However, the vast majority of the prolonged
MTT is matched.

MR
1. Interval expected evolution of the patient's large left MCA
territory
infarct, which spares the vast majority of the basal ganglia and
thalamus.  The anterior and posterior portions of the infarct
extend medially into the ACA territories. This could be
secondary to interval emboli to these regions with/without a
component of watershed ischemia.
2. Faint regions of susceptibility artifact within the infarct
concerning for early/petechial hemorrhage. Follow up with
non-contrast CT Head.

TTE
IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Normal
biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function. No definite cardiac source of
embolism identified.
If clinically indicated, a TEE would be better able to define a
potential atrial septal defect/patent foramen ovale.

[**2199-12-17**]
CXR
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of
air in the
abdomen has minimally decreased. Also decreased is the
pre-existing
relatively extensive right pleural effusion. Improved
ventilation of the left lung base. Normal size of the cardiac
silhouette. No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities.

Post-surgical CT
FINDINGS: The patient is status post left frontotemporal
craniectomy. There has been interval resolution of
post-operative pneumocephalus. A large left parenchymal
hypodensity in the middle and anterior cerebral artery
distribution is unchanged compared to most recent studies. Foci
of
hyperdensity within this region likely representing foci of
hemorrhagic
conversion are also unchanged compared to prior. There has been
interval
improvement in the rightward shift of normally-midline
structures, with
improvement in effacement of the left lateral ventricle and the
basilar
cisterns. There is no evidence of new hemorrhage or infarct.
