Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
urosepsis, Cdiff

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotrachial intubation

PICC placement x 2


History of Present Illness:
40 y/o man with h/o C5-quadriplegia, multiple admissions for
urosepsis, who presented originally to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] from rehab 3
days ago with hypotension. He had been found to have ESBL UTI
and C. diff colitis. His infections were initially responding to
IV fluids and antibiotics but on [**3-29**] he developed increasing
abdominal pain and distention. A CT abdomen was done that showed
a fluid collection in his right lower abdomen. Surgery was
consulted and recommended IR-guided drainage. He was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 86**] for IR evaluation. Per report, at time
of transfer his systolic pressures were 120-130s with HR 50-60s.
His mental status was altered (confirmed by his mother and HCP),
who said that this is what usually happens when he develops
infections.
.
Review of systems is difficult to obtain from patient given that
he has altered mental status and is a poor historian.
.
Of note, patient has a complicated urologic history and is
followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Hospital1 18**]. Per a recent urology note, patient
is "s/p appendicovesicostomy and ACE which have not been used in
some time due to indwelling Foley and rectal tube."

Past Medical History:
-C5 quadriplegia
-MDS
-recurrent UTIs and urosepsis
-OSA on biPAP with settings of [**10-31**] at night
-seizure disorder
-baclofen pump placed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1116**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 49143**])
-CKI with baseline Cr=1.5
-h/o C diff
-h/o bradycardia thought to be secondary to baclofen
-depression
-s/p appendicovesicostomy
-s/p Ace-[**Location (un) **] (antegrade continent enema) procedure
-s/p right eye prosthesis

Social History:
The patient lives at home with 24 hour care. His mother is very
involved but lives out of state. Used to work at UPS in
Marketing. Had MVA at age 17 resulting in quadriplegia.

      NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.

Imaging:
.
CXR (portable AP) [**2170-3-31**]:
1. Increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower
lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
2. Upper zone redistribution and mild vascular blurring, could
reflect mild CHF.
3. Improvement in parenchymal opacities -- please see comment.
.
CT pelvis [**2170-4-1**]:
1. Diffuse colitis with intra-abdominal fat stranding has
slightly
progressed.
2. Contrast passes throughout the large bowel with no
extravasation.
3. Slight decrease in size of the simple fluid collection in the
right iliac fossa which is most likely a locule of free fluid
and not typical for an abscess.
.
CT head w/o contrast [**2170-4-4**]:
1. No intracranial hemorrhage or edema.
2. 4.5-mm hyperdense lesion in the midline, at the level of the
foramen of
[**Last Name (un) 2044**], likely a colloid cyst, unchanged over the series of
previous CTs dating back to [**2162**]. Equivocally increased
prominence anteriorly of the cavum septum pellucidum, of
doubtful significance.
.
Venous ultrasound, left upper extremity [**2170-4-9**]:
Occlusive thrombus in a small segment of the more superficial
anterior basilic vein with no flow and no compressibility.

Brief Hospital Course:
40 y/o man h/o C5-quadriplegia, recurrent UTIs and past
admissions for urosepsis, transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with C.
diff colitis, ESBL UTI, and concern of intra-abdominal abscess.
He was initially admitted to the intensive care unit for
hypotension.
.
# ESBL urinary tract infection/sepsis:  Patient was initially
septic with hypotension and required pressors in the ICU. He was
started was treated with meropenem from [**3-28**] to [**4-11**] (14-day
course). As his condition improved, he was weaned off of
pressors and transferred to the medical floor. The patient will
need to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] discharge to evaluate the
etiology of his recurrent urinary tract infections.
