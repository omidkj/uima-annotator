History of Present Illness:
71 year-old female with a history of HTN, DM II with neuropathy,
h/o resistant UTIs in past (VRE/ESBL Klebsiella), ESRD on HD via
RUE AVF (MWF), diastolic CHF (EF>55), CAD, MRSA HD line
infection in [**10-4**] (s/p line removal), CVA in presented to the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED with reported fever to 104F and altered mental status.
.
The patient was noted by her sister to have worsening mental
status over months of dementia-like decline at home, but 1-2d of
worsening confusion. Found sitting on floor on AM of admission.
At baseline walks with [**Hospital1 **], sister helps her with all pills,
and patient not very verbal at baseline. Then family noted 104
fever this AM, no focal sx (no noted diarrhea, coughing, pain)
except for episode of small amt of incontinence, so taken to the
ED for further eval.
.
In ED, initial vitals were T98.9 HR83 BP181/57 RR18 88% on RA,
96% on 4L, TTP on right abdomen. Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] delirium -
AOx2. RUE fistula in place, no indwelling lines. Labs and
imaging significant for Cr 5.5, initial K hemolyzed at 6.5 and
rechecked at 4.6, WBC 8.9 with 79.2N. CT abd/pelvis showed right
moderate to severe hydronephrosis and hydroureter with
enhancement of the wall of the ureter and obstructive dense
material at distal ureter-uvj and urinary bladder wall
thickening. DDX: infection/stone and/or neoplasm.
CT head with no acute ICH. CXR with evidence of mild fluid
overload. Seen by urology who felt she would be difficult to do
cystoscopy so recommended IR.
.
Given 1L IVF, Vanc/CTX in ED and then went to IR suite for
percutaneous tube for drainage. Initially on 4L NC then became
more tachypneic to 20-30s. Patient with hypoxia with change of
position in IR suite. Placed on NRB briefly, then on FM with 10L
oxygen while prone for procedure with anesthesia present at
procedure, back to FM with 10L oxygen weaned down to 6L on FM
now. Not much bleeding. No hypotension during procedure, no
rhythm abnormalities.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient denying pain, alert only to
name, not answering other questions. Did recognize her sister's
name.

CT abd [**3-14**]
1. Right moderate hydronephrosis and hydroureter with
enhancement of the wall of the right ureter and an apparent
distal ureteral mass or stone as well as urinary bladder wall
thickening. Differential considerations are distal right
ureteral neoplasm or, less likely, infection-obstructive
calculus. Clinical correlation and urologic consultation
advised. MR urogram may provide for further imaging assessment,
if clinically indicated.
2. 4.3-cm right lower quadrant cystic structure inseparable from
the appendix and the cecum and adjacent loops of bowel, may
represent a GI duplication cyst or adnexal cyst. Notably the
uterus appears surgically absent. Pelvic ultrasound suggested on
a nonemergent basis if this cystic structure has not been
previously characterized and the right ovary has not been
previously resected.
3. Large amount of stool in the rectum compatible with fecal
impaction.
4. Cholelithiasis and dilatation of the common bile duct up to 9
mm is
slightly above upper limit of normal for patient's stated age.
5. Severe atherosclerotic disease, right renal stent, and
possible 3.0 x 1.4 cm aneurysm of the right common femoral
artery.
6. Sclerotic appearance with trabecular thickening of the left
iliac bone,
most compatible with Paget's disease.
.
[**2173-3-14**] CT head: No acute intracranial abnormality.
