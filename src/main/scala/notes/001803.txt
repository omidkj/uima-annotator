HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62-year-old
female with a complicated past medical history including
Takayasu arteritis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,
Parkinson's disease, COPD, who presents with a fall at home.
The patient apparently fell at home and as she lives by
herself, the patient called EMS as she had symptoms of
shortness of breath.  The patient was unable to provide a
full detailed history as to events surrounding her fall.  The
patient had a pulse of 78, blood pressure 136/64,
respirations 24, and was saturating 98% on nonrebreather when
the EMTs found her.  She was also complaining of being cold.
She did state that her 02 tank appeared to be broken.  The
patient did state that she had head trauma.

In the Emergency Room, the patient's temperature was 95.1,
pulse 100, blood pressure 90/59, respiratory rate 26,
saturating 81%.  The patient was given Albuterol nebulizer
treatments, 700 cc of lactated Ringer's, 800 cc of normal
saline, and 2 units of packed red blood cells.  There was
some question of an AP pelvis film that could not
conclusively rule out fracture and given that the patient had
a hematocrit of 28.2 at the time of admission, there was
concern that she could have been actively bleeding.  Thus,
the patient was given aggressive fluid hydration as well as 2
units of packed red blood cells.

In this setting, she developed flash pulmonary edema and
required intubation.  The patient was also given 100 mg of
hydrocortisone IV and 500 mg of levofloxacin as well as 600
mg of clindamycin.  Post intubation, the patient had an
arterial blood gas of 7.17, 92, 146.  She was then given 80
mg of IV Lasix in the Emergency Room.

The patient was then transferred to the Intensive Care Unit
for further care.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Takayasu arteritis diagnosed in [**2108**] after a syncopal

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Intensive
Care Unit secondary to intubation from volume overload after
aggressive fluid resuscitation as well as red blood cell
transfusion.

1.  RESPIRATORY:  The patient was intubated primarily in the
setting of acute pulmonary edema from volume overload.  The
patient was diuresed aggressively with good results,
diuresing approximately 4 liters while in the Intensive Care
Unit.  The patient did continue to have diffuse wheezing and
required frequent nebulizer treatments with Albuterol.  She
was titrated down to nasal cannula 3 liters, saturating
92-96% given her underlying interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
as well as COPD.

The patient had a repeat chest x-ray on [**2113-3-30**]
which revealed coarse reticular opacities in the bilateral
lungs, no pleural effusions, and marked interval improvement
of her bilateral opacities.  The patient's Lasix was held for
one day given that she had diuresed so well.  However, the
patient then redeveloped some increasing wheezing and 02
requirement.  She was diuresed again with Lasix 40 IV with
good results and repeat chest x-ray revealed good resolution
of her CHF.

The patient was then restarted on her home dose Lasix regimen
of 40 mg p.o. q.d.  The patient also had marked improvement
in he
