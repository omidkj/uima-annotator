CT Abdomen/Pelvis ([**2172-2-14**]):
1. No acute CT findings to explain elevated lactate. Limited
evaluation for mesenteric ischemia given lack of IV contrast,
however, no pneumatosis.
2. No signs of complications of pancreatitis.
3. Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
4. Thickening of the medial fundal wall of the stomach,
incompletely assessed on this non-contrast examination. This
area may be further evaluated by endoscopy or upper GI study.
.
CXR ([**2172-2-14**]): Heart remains mildly enlarged, but pulmonary
vascular congestion has resolved. No areas of consolidation to
suggest acute pneumonia.

Knee XR [**2172-2-18**]: Diffuse osteopenia, with severe osteoarthritis
of the medial femorotibial joint with joint narrowing,
subchondral sclerosis, marginal osteophyte formation, with
compensatory widening laterally.

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with a history of diastolic CHF,
chronic stable coronary heart disease, atrial fibrillation on
coumadin with recent cardioversion [**12-26**], hypertension, who
presented from nursing home with acute onset shortness of breath
x 1 day and an acute viral syndrome concerning for influenza.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES
1. DYSPNEA: Patient's shortness of breath is of unclear etiology
but likely due to combination of CHF exacerbation plus
influenza. Influenza DFA returned positive. [**Month (only) 116**] also be
exacerbated by conversion into atrial fibrillation with RVR
(triggered by viral infection/ fever/dehydration). No cough or
focal consolidation on CXR concerning for pneumonia.  She was
continued on tamiflu for 5 days. She was diuresed with IV lasix
which improved her shortness of breath. Patient did not complain
of SOB for the remainder of her hospital stay.
.
2. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION with RVR: Status post cardioversion on
[**2171-12-27**].  TTE showed normal LVEF but left atrium enlargement.
She was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular response in 140s on admission to the ED with no
effect on blood pressure.  She was started on amiodarone drip in
the MICU as as lopressor and diltiazem had little effect on her
rate control.  Her heart rate improved to high 90s once
amiodarone drip was started. TSH was noted to be within normal
limits.  Her cardiac enzymes were negative x 2 with unchanged
EKG.

-patient will continue on Amiodarone as outlined. Repeat
