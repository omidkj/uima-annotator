Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Percocet / Penicillins / Flagyl

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 710**]
Chief Complaint:
OCCLUDED FEM-TIB BYPASS

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thrombectomy of a right femoral to anterior tibial artery bypass
graft through both femoral and tibial incisions, arteriogram of
the right lower extremity, intra-arterial TPA infusion 1 mg and
debridement and closure of right popliteal wound.


History of Present Illness:
70yo woman with significant history of CAD and peripheral
[**First Name3 (LF) 1106**] disease with history of fem-tib bypass (and subsequent
thrombosis and thrombectomy) transferred to medicine.
.
Her initial fem-tib bypass was in [**4-23**], complicated by graft
thrombosis with thrombectomy in [**11-24**]. Post-op course was
complicated by non-healing ulcers, ulcer infections, and c. diff
colitis. Admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**1-22**] for klebsiella UTI/bacteremia
and acute renal failure. She was ultimately transferred to rehab
on [**3-11**].
.
She was readmitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**3-18**] when it was noted that she
had increasing pain/pulseless right foot. She underwent graft
thrombectomy again on [**3-24**]. Post-operatively, her course was
complicated by recurrent Klebsiella UTI. She was treated
initially with vanco/meropenem/and flagyl. Ultimately, she
completed a 14 day course of meropenem. Subsequent urine
cultures were clear.
She has also been treated for c. diff (despite negative c. diff
assay), and planning to complete 10 days po vancomycin after
meropenem ended.
.
Course also complicated by depression and waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**]
alertness/attention c/w delirium. She has also developed
urinary/fecal incontinence - workup not done per family's
wishes.

.
Review of systems was only significant for overall fatigue,
depression, and frustration with her prolonged hospital stay.

CHEST (PRE-OP PA & LAT)

Reason: GANGRENE RIGHT FOOT

PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: The right PICC is coiled in
the axilla. The left PICC is seen terminating in the SVC. There
are bilateral pleural effusions. Pulmonary vasculature is still
prominent as compared to the chest x-ray of [**2174-3-9**].
Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis is also seen. Surrounding soft
tissues and osseous structures are unchanged.

IMPRESSION:
1) Right PICC coiled in axilla. This was communicated to [**Doctor First Name **],
the nurse caring for the patient, at 10:30 p.m. on [**2174-3-19**].
2) Improved CHF.
3) Bilateral small to moderate pleural effusions with associated
bibasilar atelectasis.

ECG Study

Sinus rhythm. Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Low voltage in the
limb leads. Compared to the previous tracing no significant
change.
