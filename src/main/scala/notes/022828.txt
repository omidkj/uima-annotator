HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  70-year-old woman with a history
of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, hypertension,
breast cancer and history of tuberculosis with lobectomy and
status post INH therapy presents to the hospital with a
nonproductive cough, increased shortness of breath for the
past three weeks.  The patient states that her shortness of
breath is present even at rest.  She has two pillow
orthopnea which is unchanged throughout that period.  The

elevated as well as episodic paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, no
diaphoresis, no chest pain, fevers, chills or recent weight
loss, no smoking history or exposure to asbestosis.  No
colonoscopy recently and mammograms were normal after her
breast cancer was diagnosed.

The patient was admitted and placed on Azithromycin for what
appeared to be a community acquired pneumonia diagnosed by
chest x-ray.  The patient was ruled out for myocardial
infarction and was given 40 mg of intravenous Lasix for
presumed congestive heart failure exacerbation.  The patient
is admitted to the medical service for further management of
her congestive heart failure exacerbation.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vitals:  98.1, 140/96, 84, 12, 93
percent on room air.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat: WNL
Mucous membranes.  Neck:  JVD to angle of jaw Cardiac
examination: Normal S1,
and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Lungs:  Decreased
breath sounds bilaterally and egophony on the left lower lobe
with good air movement.  No stridor.  Mild dullness to
percussion left lower lobe.  Abdomen benign. Extremities:  No
edema, no clubbing.

CT of the chest:  Pulmonary artery
hypertension which correlates to dilated structure on chest x-
ray.  Biapical thickening which probably is secondary to
granulomatous infection probably TB but neoplastic process
cannot be excluded.  Trace pleural effusions, pleural
thickening and left lung laterally consistent with focal
opacity seen on chest X-ray.

TTE:  Moderate dilated left atrium.  Severe global
hypokinesis with EF 20 to 30 percent  No mitral valve
prolapse, 1+ MR, moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension, no effusion.

EKG:  Normal sinus rhythm at 100.  Normal axis, normal
intervals, diffuse T-wave flattening inversions, lateral
leads.  No acute changes when compared to [**8-/2157**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was ruled out for myocardial
infarction and underwent a stress MIBI in the morning which
was negative.  The patient was seen by the Heart Failure
Consult team who believed that the patient was in heart
failure which was the primary cause of her shortness of
breath.  The patient was subsequently diuresed with
subsequent improvement in her congestive heart failure.  The
patient did develop hypotension on the floor likely due to her
decompensated HF and too much verapamil.  She underwent right
heart cath which revealed elevated filling pressures, including a
wedge of 34 and low cardiac output. The
patient subsequently did quite well and was brought out to
the Medicine floor.  She was transfused three units of packed
red blood cells given her hypotension as well as her history
of chronic anemia.  The patient was diuresed approximately
two liters negative over the next two days with intravenous
Lasix.  The patient's medications were titrated up per the
Heart Failure Team.  They believed that the patient would
tolerate up titration of the Captopril and the regimen that
the cardiology team prescribed was Hydralazine 100 mg q 6,
Toprol XL 125 mg q day, Imdur 60 mg q day, Norvasc 10 mg q
day, Lasix 40 mg q day and Clonidine patch .1 mg q 24 hours.

Given the patient's requirement for numerous hypertension
medications she underwent an Magnetic resonance imaging, MRA
to rule out renal artery stenosis which was negative.  Once
the patient's congestive heart failure was resolved it was
thought that the patient could be discharged home.  Weight at
time of discharge was 84 kg and the patient was thought to be
euvolemic with normalization of her JVD, clear lung fields and no
peripheral edema.

PLAN:
1. The patient was to follow-up with the primary care doctor
   in one weeks time.
2. The patient was to follow-up with the Advanced Heart
   Failure clinic in one to two weeks.


DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Hydralazine 100 mg q 6 hours.

5. Lasix 40 mg q day.
6. Clonidine patch 0.1 mg q 24 hours.
