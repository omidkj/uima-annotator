Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the trauma ICU by the Trauma Surgery service
on [**2141-12-12**].  Because of his traumatic brain injury and the fact
that his GCS was less than 8, it was necessary to place an
intracranial bolt for  monitoring of his intracranial pressures.
 He tolerated this procedure well.  He was loaded with Dilantin;
Mannitol and Nafcillin were initiated as well. The bolt was
eventually removed at bedside on [**2141-12-18**].  He also received
multiple units of packed RBCs, FFP and platelets. A PICC was
later placed for IV antibiotics; the PICC has been removed and
the antibiotics stopped.

He was followed by Plastic Surgery for his facial fractures
which were determined to be non-operative and also followed by
Plastics (Hand) for dislocation of middle and index fingers on
his right hand.  These were relocated and he was splinted for
immobilization. Follow up with Plastic surgery is recommended in
2 weeks after discharge.

His care was continued in the ICU.  He was seen by Ophthalmology
on [**12-15**] for evaluation due to his facial fractures and concern
for orbital injury. It was revealed that he had a traumatic
optic neuropathy in both eyes. He will require follow up with
Ophthalmology as an outpatient.

He later underwent an open tracheostomy and gastrostomy tube. He
was eventually weaned from the ventilator. Tube feedings had
been initiated early on via an OG tube; these were continued via
the gastrostomy tube. Eventually he was transferred to the
regular nursing unit.

His mental status has slowly improved over the course of his
stay. He has gone from being unresponsive during his initial ICU
stay to becoming awake. Currently he is much more alert and able
to respond to some questions with simple answers; follows simple
commands. A repeat head CT scan was performed on [**2142-1-1**] which
showed resolving subdural hematomas, right greater than left
with multiple old facial fractures.

He was evaluated by Speech & Swallow for Passy Muir valve, which
he was able to tolerate. A bedside swallow evaluation was also
done; it was recommended that he have a video swallow and so
this was ordered. He will require ongoing Speech therapy once at
rehab.

Physical and Occupational therapy were consulted early on; it
was determined that he would need an acute rehab stay follow his
hospitalization. Social work was also closely involved with
patient and family since early admission. Several family
meetings took place throughout his stay to discuss his course
and disposition.
