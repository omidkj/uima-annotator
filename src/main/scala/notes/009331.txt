HPI:
History was obtained form doctor at OSH, ambulance sheet, and
patients husband.Pt is a 74 year old Right handed woman with PMH
of atrial
fibrillation on coumadin,HTN, CHF, pacemaker and CAD who was
transfered from OSH for evaluation of stroke. She was in her
usual state of health until 5:45pm this evening, when while
chatting with her husband she suddenly stopped speaking. She was
not responding to any of his questions.
He noticed that her right arm and leg was weaker and there was
some facial asymmetry.  EMS was called and transported her to an
outside hospital. As she was being seen IN ED at OSH, she became
more and more drowsy and she was intubated for airway
protection.
There, INR was found to be subtherapeutic at 1.4 and CT head
reavealed "no hemorrhage." She was given labetalol, fentanyl,
propofol and was started on IV tpa after tele stroke
assesment at 7.45 pm. TPA infusion was nearly completed upon
arrival to our ED.

Here, her examination was limited due to intubation and sedation
with propofol. Approximate NIHSS = 13 at 8:15pm.

Imaging:

CXR [**2133-11-22**]:
Feeding tube with a wire stylet in place passes into the stomach

and out of view. Persistent asymmetry in consolidation affecting

predominantly the right upper lobe could be due to aspiration
following
improvement elsewhere in pulmonary edema. Moderate cardiomegaly,
small
bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. Mediastinal vascular
engorgement
has worsened indicating elevated central venous pressure or
volume. Atrial
and ventricular pacer leads traverse left-sided superior vena
cava. No
pneumothorax.

Echo [**2133-11-21**]:
The left atrium is elongated. No left atrial mass/thrombus seen
(best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography). The right
atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 10-20mmHg. The coronary sinus is dilated (diameter
>15mm). There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and
arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Biatrial enlargement. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

CT Torso [**2133-11-21**]:
Small amount of ascites, but low in density without definite
evidence for hemoperitoneum, although a degree of hemorrhage
cannot be
entirely excluded.

CT [**2133-11-20**]:
Slightly limited study secondary to motion artifact. Interval
decrease in
size and conspicuity of left frontal lobe hemorrhage. Evaluation
for subtle loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is limited
secondary to motion artifact.

The rapid reduction in hypderdensity suggests that some of the
dense material see earlier on [**11-20**] reflected contrast
enhancement. However, the persistent high density represents
hemorrhage.

CT [**2133-11-20**]
Status post thrombolysis and clot retrieval with new hyperdense
focus and surrounding edema in the left frontal lobe concerning
for acute
hemorrhage. Mild mass effect on the left lateral ventricle
without shift of the normally midline structures.

CTA/Perfusion ([**2133-11-19**]):
The CT examination demonstrates hyperdensity, implying
thrombosis,
of the left middle cerebral artery. In addition, there is marked
hypodensity
in the insular cortex and subinsular white matter on the left as
well as a
broader area of hypodensity throughout the left middle cerebral
artery
distribution. These findings suggest embolic occlusion and acute
infarction
in the distribution of the left middle cerebral artery.

The CT perfusion study demonstrates an elevated transit time and
reduced blood
volume and blood flow throughout most of the left temporal lobe,
extending
into the left parietal lobe. These findings are also consistent
with severe
ischemia and likely irreversible injury.

The CTA confirms occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery.
There is
extensive filling of the cortical branches through collaterals.
Images of the
remainder of the intracranial major arteries appear normal with
no other areas
of stenosis or occlusion and no evidence of aneurysm formation.
Images of the
neck demonstrate bilateral pleural effusions. Incidentally noted
is an
inhomogeneous appearance of the right lobe of the thyroid gland
with two
apparent cysts within it. These both have irregular enhancing
walls and
hypodense centers. Correlation with thyroid ultrasound may be
helpful.

CTA of the neck demonstrates partially calcified plaques
bilaterally at the
carotid bifurcations. The left bifurcation plaque contains a
large hypodense
component, perhaps reflecting fatty necrosis within the plaque.
Neither
internal carotid demonstrates significant stenosis. At its
narrowest, the
left internal carotid artery measures approximately 3.6 mm in
diameter which
is 4.9 mm diameter for the distal left cervical internal carotid
artery. The
distal right cervical internal carotid artery also measu
