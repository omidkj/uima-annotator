Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Unresponsive, abdominal pain, s/p intubation, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation, right subclavian vein catheritization

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 26514**] is a 74 yo man with a history of Parkinson's
disease, CHF, and Aortic Stenosis who presents from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab
after he was found in his bed altered and moaning at 1030PM.
Vital signs were checked at that time and were 73/44, 126,
28-30, 87% on RA. He was then brought to the ED. Of note, he had
an unwitnessed fall on to his knees earlier that day at 4:30PM
but he denied any pain afterwards. He appeared to be in his
usual state of health at dinner that evening. No abnormalities
were noted until he was found altered at 10:30 PM.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 96.8, 125, 77/56, 28, 96% on
nonrebreather. 700cc of fluid was suctioned from his throat and
there was concern that he was not protecting his airway
therefore he was intubated. He also demonstrated abdominal
tenderness and diffuse diarrhea that was foul smelling,
brown/black, but guaiac negative. There was concern for
dissection vs. abd source so he had CTA of his chest/abd. This
showed diffuse small bowel thickening but no PE or dissection.
BPs stayed low despite 4 liters of fluid so a right subclavian
line was placed and he was started on phenylephrine. Surgery
evaluated the patient in the ED and felt no surgery was
indicated at this time. Flexiseal was placed to contain copious
liquid stool. He received a dose of Vancomycin and Zosyn prior
to transfer.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient is intubated and sedated.

IMAGING:

CTA Chest/Abd:
1. no PE/aortic dissection
2. bibasilar consolidations, L>R with foci of low density in L
consolidation may refelct aspiration though early necrotizing
process a consideration.
3. diffuse SB thickening (beginning in prox jejunum) as well as
distal colonic wall thickening - near target sign - no signif
bowel dilation- target sign suggests acute inflammation or
ischemia - vessels appear patent - no free fluid in abd/pelvis
may relfect enteroclitis.
4 -large rectal fecal load with rectal tube in palce.
5. thickened bladder wall and bladder calculi - conernign for
cystitis- through may refelct chronic irritaiton from stone.
.
CT Head w/o contrast: No acute process.



Brief Hospital Course:
74 yo man hx of Parkinsons who presents from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with
AMS, hypotension, and hypoxia.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

# Hypotension/shock: Most likely septic shock given the high
white count of 30.5 on admission, from GI source (infectious
enterocolitis +/- ischemic colitis) vs Pulmonary (aspiration,
HCAP, necrotizing PNA) vs Urinary (cystitis seen on CT but
unremarkable U/A).  Also likely component of hypovolemia given
profuse diarrhea and poor PO intake.  Echo did not show evidence
of cardiogenic component.  Lactate elevated to 5.8 on admission,
required large volume fluid resuscitation and pressors to
maintain adequate MAPs.  He was started empirically on
Vanc/Zosyn in ED, then switched to vancomycin (IV and PO),
cefepime and flaygl for possible infectious causes.  Lactate
trended down with fluids and pressors were weaned off by
hospital day 2.
.
# Diarrhea/GI bleed:  Noted initially to have copious amounts of
brown, guaiac negative stool.  CT abdomen revealed diffuse small
bowel and distal colon thickening concerning for infection or
ischemia due to low flow state.  He was seen by surgery on
admission to evaluate for possible mesenteric ischemia, but it
was felt that he was not imminently in need of surgery nor was
he a good candidate for surgery.  PO vanco and IV flagyl,
cefepime were started empirically, and stool was sent for C
diff, O&P and cultures (all were negative).  Hct was noted to
fall from 48 to 33 within 2 days, and though this drop was
partially attributable to hemodilution, his stool did begin to
have visible blood (guaiac pos). Aspirin was held and GI was
consulted, who felt that this delayed hematochezia was
consistent with intestinal ischemia, perhaps due to infectious
enteritis causing profound volume depletion and low flow state.
They recommended continuing IV cefepime and flagyl for a 8 day
course (day 1 [**8-17**]), and PO vancomycin was DC'd after c diff
cultures were negative.  His hematochezia had stopped and
hematocrit was stable on the day of discharge, no signs of
hemodynamic compromise.   If there is interest in further
workup, GI suggested it would be reasonable to repeat CT scan in
[**1-10**] weeks to determine if there is persistent
small bowel thickening, in which case endoscopy could be
considered.
.
#. Hypoxia: Improved after deep suctioning, however patient was
intubated in the ED because of inability to protect airway. CT
chest shows area of consolidation in LLL concerning for
necrotizing PNA vs aspiration, so he was started on vancomycin
cefepime.  He was extubated successfully on hospital day two and
was weaned gradually to room air throughout his hospital stay.
He did continue to have copious amounts of sputum that he had
trouble clearing and required frequent suctioning. He appeared
to be having further aspiration events, so speech and swallow
recommended keeping him NPO with tube feeds.  His swallowing
ability should be continually reassesed at rehab and diet
advanced as tolerated. He should continue the vancomycin an
