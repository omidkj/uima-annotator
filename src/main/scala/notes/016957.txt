Chief Complaint:
GI bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP x 2
Hemodialysis on regular Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday schedule

History of Present Illness:
62 year old male nursing-home resident ([**Hospital1 1562**] Care and Rehab)
with history of CAD and ESRD on HD who presents with GIB and
right upper quadrant pain. Patient had an ERCP on [**2-14**] with
biliary stone removal and sphincterotomy. The procedure was
without immediate complication, and the patient was sent home
with 7 days of antibiotics and recommendation for
cholecystectomy in future.  Last night, he began to have maroon
stools that have continued today.  Symptoms are associated with
continued RUQ abdominal pain with slight progression over the
past day.  The patient also endorses nausea, no vomiting.

He presented to an OSH, where he was noted to have continued
abdominal pain, maroon stools and hypotension to SBP 90.
Hematocrit 34.  He underwent CT abdomen that showed a distended
gallbladder with dense material; dense focus in R hepatic bile
duct; pneumobilia (as expected). In ER at [**Hospital1 1562**], he received
morphine 10 mg, protonix 40 mg, pepcid 20 mg, and unasyn 3
grams.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED inital vitals were, 98.2 79 115/57 18 97% 2L.
The patient had a tender right upper quadrant and positive
[**Doctor Last Name **] sign.  Labs significant for HCT 28.2 from 34, WBC count
8.3, and mildly elevated transaminases and alk phos.  A RUQ U/S
was equivocal for acute cholecystitis.  The patient had a bowel
movement of maroon, pudding-consistency stool.  GI and the ERCP
team were consulted, and recommended a repeat scope in the ICU.
An NG lavage was attempted but unable to be completed secondary
to intermittent aggression.  The patient received 1 unit PRBCs,
dilaudid, and protonix 40mg bolus and drip.  He was transferred
to the ICU.

Currently, the patient is in no acute distress.  Abdomen tender
to palpation. The patient is unable to provide a thorough
history.

ORGANISMS/ML.

ERCP [**2142-2-14**]:
Normal major papilla. Thick bile noted to drain. Cannulation of
the biliary duct was successful and deep after a guidewire was
placed. The common bile duct, common hepatic duct, right and
left hepatic ducts, biliary radicles and cystic duct were filled
with contrast and well visualized. The course and caliber of the
structures are normal with no evidence of extrinsic compression,
no ductal abnormalities, and no filling defects. Given elevated
LFTs and HIDA scan findings, a sphincterotomy was performed in
the 12 o'clock position using a sphincterotome over an existing
guidewire.  3 small stones extracted successfully using a
balloon.

RUQ U/S ([**2-18**]): Distended gallbladder with sludge. Pneumobilia is
likely secondary to recent ERCP. Upper abdominal pain does not
localize to the gallbladder son[**Name (NI) 5326**]. [**Name2 (NI) **] pericholecystic
fluid. These findings are equivocal for acute cholecystitis. If
indicated, a HIDA scan could be performed for further
evaluation.

CT Abd w/out contrast ([**2-18**]):
1. Distended gallbladder with dense material, likely reflecting
sludge or prior ERCP contrast; questionable gallbladder wall
edema/pericholecystic fluid; trace right lower quadrant free
fluid - early acute cholecystitis is a concern, and ultrasound
follow-up may be considered.
2. Bibasilar pulmonary infiltrates, more prominent on the left
than the right - may represent atelectasis, aspiration, or early
pneumonia.
3. No peripancreatic fluid collection or inflammation.

CXR ([**12-19**]):
FINDINGS: No previous images. The left subclavian PICC line
extends to the mid-to-lower portion of the SVC. There may be
minimal streaks of atelectasis at the left base, but otherwise
the lungs are clear without evidence of pneumonia or vascular
congestion.

CXR ([**12-20**]):
In comparison with study of [**2-18**], the tip of the PICC line is in
the lower SVC just above the cavoatrial junction. There is
slightly lower lung volume. This may account for the apparent
crowding of vessels at the bases, though some atelectatic change
would have to be considered.

Echo ([**12-20**]):
Poor image
