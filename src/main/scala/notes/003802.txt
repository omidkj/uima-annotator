History of Present Illness:
This is an 85 yr old male with CRI (baseline creat 1.8-2.3) who
was admitted to [**Hospital 46**] Hosp with a NSTEMI last month (medically
managed) and was then readmitted to [**Hospital 46**] Hosp with chest pain
on [**2128-4-26**]. He had squeezing sub-sternal CP intermittently for 2
weeks (both at rest and with exertion). The CP was associated
with SOB. He ruled in again for MI with trop reportedly 0.15,
ck??????s were negative. ETT reportedly revealed a reversible
inferior posterior defect. He is on coumadin for hx of DVT,
which has been on hold, and INR on [**2128-4-29**] was 1.5. He was pain
free at rest but has had chest pain when getting oob to the BR,
which has resolved with ntg SL and oxygen at [**Hospital 46**] Hosp.
Creatinine was up to 2.3. He was hydrated just prior to transfer
to the [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization and further management
of his coronary artery disease. On admission, he was pain free.

[**2128-4-30**] Cardiac catheterization: Selective coronary angiography
of this right dominant system revealed three vessel disease. The
LMCA had a distal 30% lesion. The LAD was moderately calcified
with a 30% ostial stenosis and an 80% lesion in the mid-vessel
just after the take off of a major D2 branch, which had diffuse
plaquing. The D1 branch had a proximal 80% stenosis. The LCx had
a 90% lesion in the proximal AV groove and a 40% lesion
distally. The was a major OM3 branch with a proximal 70%
stenosis. The RCA was diffusely diseased throughout with a 50%
mid-vessel stenosis and 60-70% stenosis in the PDA. There was a
major AM branch with a 60% lesion. Moderate diastolic left
ventricular dysfunction.

[**2128-5-3**] TTE: Preserved global left ventricular systolic
function(LVEF approximately 55%). Right ventricular cavity
enlargement but with good free wall function.  No AI. Trivial
MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].

[**2128-5-4**] Carotid Ultrasound: Less than 40% stenosis involving the
internal carotid arteries bilaterally.

[**2128-5-4**] Groin Ultrasound: Right groin pseudoaneurysm measuring
up to 2.8 cm at site of previous right femoral puncture.

[**2128-5-15**] Abdominal CT Scan: Findings consistent with colonic
ileus. Short segment of narrowed ileum with mild wall
thickening. The appearance raises concern for a neoplastic
process, for which further evaluation is recommended. Multiple
bilateral cystic lesions in the kidneys, not fully characterized
here. Although these most likely represents simple cysts, this
appearance could be evaluated by ultrasound if clinically
indicated.


Brief Hospital Course:
On admission, Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] cardiac catheterization
which revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease. He
was pretreated with Plavix. Given his chronic renal
insufficiency, LV gram was deferred and echocardiogram was
obtained which showed preserved global left ventricular systolic
function. In anticipation for cardiac surgical intervention,
Plavix was discontinued. Additional workup included cartoid
ultrasond which found minimal disease of the internal carotid
arteries. Cardiac catheterization was complicated by a right
common femoral artery pseudoaneurysm which was successfully
treated with thrombin injection on [**5-4**]. He otherwise
remained pain free on medical therapy. He had bouts of
paroxsymal atrial fibrillation preoperatively for which he was
maintained on Amiodarone and Heparin.

On [**5-5**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed coronary artery bypass
grafting surgery. For surgical details, please see seperate
dictated operative note. Following the operation, he was brought
to the CSRU for invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. He continued to
experience periods of atrial fibrillation/flutter which was
initially treated with beta blockade and Amiodarone. Given
persistent atrial arrhythmias associated with hypotension, the
EP service was consulted. Amiodarone was continued while
Metoprolol was temporarily discontinued in hopes to improve
hemodynamics. Warfarin was also resumed with a temporary Heparin
bridge. Successful cardioversion was performed on [**5-17**], but
he returned to atrial fibillation within several days. A second
electrical cardioversion was attempted, but was also
unsuccessful.  It was recommended that he remain on Amiodarone
at discharge with anticoagulation indefinitely.

His renal function declined in the early postoperative period.
His creatinine peaked to 3.8 on postoperative day ten. He did
not experience oliguria. The renal service was consulted and
attributed his acute on chronic renal failure to acute tubular
necrosis secondary to hypotension. Despite significant rise in
creatinine, there was no indication for dialysis. Over the
remaineder of his hospital stay, his renal function slowly
improved. He also experienced some hypernatremia which was
treated with free water.

His postoperative course was also complicated by an
ileus/colonic pseudobstruction. He was temporarily made NPO and
required placement of nasogastric and rectal tubes. With the
above measures and aggressive bowel regimen, his
pseudobstruction gradually resolved. His diet was slowly
advanced and by discharge, he was tolerating a regular diet.

He was also noted to have a sternal click associated with
sternal drainage. He was placed on strict sternal precautions
with close observation of his sternal incision. At discharge,
his sternal drainage had resolved although he continued to have
a click.

By post-operative day seventeen he was ready for discharge to a
rehabilitation facility.
