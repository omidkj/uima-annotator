Service:  CARDTHORAC

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient is an 86-year-old woman with
known aortic stenosis referred for outpatient cardiac
angiography to evaluate aortic stenosis and coronary artery
disease.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Three weeks ago during a routine
physical she mentioned to her doctor that she had been
getting short of breath when she bends over to pick something
up.  She denied chest pain and was referred for an
echocardiogram.  The echocardiogram was done on [**2-15**].
At that time it revealed critical aortic stenosis with an
aortic valve area of 0.23 cm squared and a peak gradient of
122 mm/Hg with a mean gradient of 67 mm/Hg.  There was 1+
aortic regurgitation and 2+ mitral regurgitation with
concentric left ventricular hypertrophy.  She was then
referred to [**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac
catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, cerebrovascular accident in [**2132**] with
no residual weakness, right knee surgery and an appendectomy.
The patient denies diabetes, any family history of cardiac
disease, any transient ischemic attacks, any melena or
gastrointestinal bleeds, any orthopnea, edema or paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, any lightheadedness or claudication.

ALLERGIES:  She has no known allergies.

MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:  Include:
1.  Atenolol 50 mg q. day.
2.  Imdur 30 mg q. day.
3.  Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q. day.
4.  Lisinopril 20 mg q. day.
5.  Lipitor 10 mg q. day.
6.  Aspirin 81 mg q. day.
7.  Clindamycin 300 mg t.i.d. due to recent dental cleaning.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives alone and is independent.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 6, hematocrit 39.4, platelet
count 188,000.  Sodium 134, potassium 3.5, chloride 93, CO2
29, BUN 13, creatinine 0.7, INR 1.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Height 5'1", weight 116 pounds.  Vital
signs:  Heart rate 64 sinus rhythm, blood pressure 160/48,
respiratory rate 12, oxygen saturation 99% on room air.
HEENT:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.  Positive
arcus nose xanthoma.  Neck is supple.  No carotid bruits.
Jugular venous distention to 9.  Respiratory:  Breath sounds
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac:  Regular rate
and rhythm with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard best at
the left sternal border.  Abdomen is soft and non-tender,
non-distended with seborrhea.  Extremities:  No edema.
Varicosities.  Dorsalis pedis on the right 1+, posterior
tibial 2+, dorsalis pedis on the left 1+, posterior tibial
2+.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Sinus rhythm, intervals 20, 0840, normal
axis with left ventricular hypertrophy.

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION:  Showed an aortic valve area of 0.38
cm squared with a peak gradient of 100 mm/Hg, an index of 1.9
and a wedge of 22, PA pressures of 66/22 with a mean of 40.
Shared left main 20%, LAD 60%, left circumflex with minimal
irregularities and RCA 90%.

Following catheterization, Cardiothoracic Surgery was
consulted, the patient was seen and accepted for aortic valve
replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting.  While
awaiting surgery, the patient was seen by the Dental Service
who extracted an infected tooth prior to her surgery.  On [**3-29**] the patient was brought to the Operating Room.  Please
see the Operating Room report for full details.  In summary,
the patient had an aortic valve replacement with a #19 Mosaic
valve and coronary artery bypass grafting times two with the
left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending
artery and a saphenous vein graft to the right coronary
artery.  The surgery was complicated by an aortic tear which
was repaired.  The patient's bypass time was 137 minutes.
Her crossclamp time was 126 minutes.  She was transferred
from the Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care
Unit.  At the time of transfer the patient had Neo-Synephrine
at 1.5 mcg/kg/min, propofol at 20 mcg/kg/min and aprotinin at
25 cc/hour.  The patient did well in the immediate
postoperative period.  Her anesthesia was reversed, sedation
was discontinued and she was weaned from the ventilator and
successfully extubated.  She was weaned from all cardioactive
intravenous medications.  On the morning of postoperative day
one the patient remained hemodynamically stable, however,
neurologically, she was alert and oriented only times one.
At that time she could identify that she was in the hospital,
however, she believed that she was in the [**Hospital3 **].
Other than that she followed commands.  Her pupils were
equally round and reactive to light and she had bilaterally
equal motor strength.  On postoperative day two the patient
was begun on captopril, Lopressor and intravenous
nitroglycerin to control her blood pressure.  She was also
kept in the Intensive Care Unit because of the need for
vigorous pulmonary toilet and to monitor her neurological
status.  The patient continued to do well.  Her intravenous
nitroglycerin was weaned to off.  As her p.o. medications
were increased she remained mildly confused and on
postoperative day four she was transferred to the floor for
continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.
For the next several days the patient continued to progress
slowly in her activity level.  She remained pleasantly
confused.  On postoperative day six Neurology consult was
called and the patient went for a head CT scan.  CT scan
showed no acute hemorrhage, no mass effect or shifts.  Two
foci of the hypothalamus in the right parietal lobe that
represented a probable prior infarction.  Neurology consult
recommended working up any possible infectious processes that
could exacerbate mental status changes and to hold all
sedatives.  On postoperative day eight it was decided that
the patient was stable and ready for transfer to a
rehabilitation facility for continuing postoperative care and
rehabilitation.  At the time of anticipated transfer, the
patient's physical examination is as follows:

Vital signs:  Temperature 97.0, heart rate 71 sinus rhythm,
blood pressure 126/54, respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation
93% on room air.  Weight preoperatively 53 kilograms, at
discharge 58 kilograms.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 8.9, hematocrit 35, platelet
count 144,000.  Sodium 137, potassium 3.9, chloride 102, CO2
27, BUN 20, creatinine 0.6, glucose 115.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Awake, oriented times one, confused
about place and time.  Conversant, moves all extremities.
Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac:
Regular rate and rhythm.  S1, S2.  Sternum:  Stable incision
with Steri-Strips, open to air, clean and dry.  Abdomen soft,
non-tender, non-distended with positive bowel sounds.
Extremities are warm and well perfused.  No clubbing,
cyanosis or edema.  Left lower extremity incision with
Steri-Strips.  A dry sterile dressing at the top pole of the
incision with a small amount of serous drainage.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Include:
1.  Pantoprazole 40 mg q. day.
2.  Captopril 75 mg t.i.d.
3.  Metoprolol 100 mg b.i.d.
4.  Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg q. day.
5.  Colace 100 mg b.i.d.
6.  Percocet 5/325 one to two tabs q. 4h. p.r.n.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Include:
1.  Aortic stenosis status post aortic valve replacement with
a #19 Mosaic valve.
2.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass grafting times two with left internal mammary artery
to left anterior descending artery and saphenous vein graft
to right coronary artery.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Status post cerebrovascular accident in [**2132**].
6.  Status post right knee surgery.
7.  Status post appendectomy.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISPOSITION:  To rehabilitation.

FOLLOW UP:  Primary care physician two to three weeks after
discharge from rehabilitation and follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**]
four weeks from discharge at [**Hospital1 188**].
