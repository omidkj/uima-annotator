History of Present Illness:
This is a 62yo female with history of autoimmune hepatitis on
chronic immunosuppression, liver cirrhosis, diabetes, COPD,
chronic leg swelling from previous fracture, on imuran and
prednisone, transferred from OSH with Strep B bacteremia and
endopthalmitis. The patient was initially admitted to OSH on
[**2198-5-17**] for diarreha, nausea, and vomiting, with fever of 102 on
the day of admission. She was initially felt to have an acute
gastroenteritis, mild CHF, and LLE cellulitis. On admission she
was started on IV Vanc for presumed LLE cellulitis, and her
other meds (including imuran and prednisone) were held. She
developed acute loss of vision in her R eye on the night of
admission, and MRI/MRA was obtained. MRI showed multiple
punctate bilateral embolism c/w septic emboli. She was started
on heparin. Neurology recommended echo and MRA of the aortic
arch, concluding her symptoms were c/w embolic stroke. Her
gastroenterologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 62005**], recommended continuing the
pts Imuran and prednisone. She was also started on stress dose
solu-cortef for unclear reasons (not clear if pt was
hypotensive). On [**5-19**] she was started on IV Gent in addition to
her IV Vanc. Prior to transfer she was seen by opthamology who
felt her sxs were consistent with endopthalmitis and needs
urgent eval for vitreous tap and possible vitrectomy. Of note,
the pt is growing 4/4 bottles from [**5-17**] with strep agalactiae
group B. CXR on [**5-17**] was c/w mild CHF. ESR on [**5-18**] was 75. Urine
cx on [**5-17**] is growing strep agalactiea. Echo on [**5-21**] was
suspicious for mitral valve vegetation.

[**5-24**] CT HEAD
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Multiple hypodensities could be consistent with history of
septic emboli. However, for specific evaluation, a
contrast-enhanced CT of the brain or MRI is recommended.
.
[**2198-5-25**] ECHO
Conclusions:
No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. The
interatrial septum is aneurysmal, but no atrial septal defect or
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right
ventricular systolic function is normal. The ascending,
transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter
and free of atherosclerotic plaque. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on
the aortic valve. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. There is a
large (1.6 x 1.5 cm) vegetation on the posterior mitral leaflet,
with leaflet perforation. An associated jet of severe (4+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The anterior mitral leaflet is
normal in appearance, and there is no associated mitral annular
abscess. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve and
tricuspid valve.
IMPRESSION: Mitral valve endocarditis with posterior leaflet
perforation. Severe mitral regurgitation.
.
[**2198-5-28**] PELVIS ULTRASOUND
This is a technically difficult examination. The transabdominal
study is very limited due to the patient's body habitus.
Endovaginal examination was also technically difficult. The
uterus measures 4 cm in transverse x 4.7 cm in AP x 6.5 cm in
sagittal dimensions. The endometrial stripe measures 5 mm in
maximum dimension. Multiple heterogenous areas are identified
within the uterus in the mid body which may represent fibroids.
The largest of these measures less than 2 cm. The ovaries are
not visualized.
IMPRESSION: Technically difficult abdominal and transvaginal
examinations in patient with normal endometrial stripe thickness
and heterogenous appearance of uterus which may represent
fibroids. Ovaries not imaged.
.
[**2198-5-28**] DOPPLER LIVER
COLOR & PULSED DOPPLER SON[**Name (NI) **] LIVER: Normal flow and
waveforms are demonstrated within the hepatic arteries. No
portal venous flow is identified within the main portal vein and
the main portal vein is not well delineated.
IMPRESSION: 1) Heterogeneous echotexture of the liver consistent
with cirrhosis. No focal mass lesion identified.
2) The portal vein is not well delineated on this study. No
color flow or Doppler pulse is present within the expected
region of the portal vein. Chronic portal vein thrombus cannot
be excluded.
3) Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
.
REPEAT ECHO [**2198-6-7**]
No significant changes from prior.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 62 yo pt with autoimmune hepatitis on chronic
immunosuppression transferred from OSH, with Group B strep
bacteremia, septic brain emboli, endopthalmitis, endocarditis
with large mitral valve vegetation and small perforation.

# Endocarditis/bacteremia: The patient was initially on
vancomycin and gentamycin when transferred, and placed on the
sepsis protocol. AS per ID, gentamycin was discontinued and then
was switched to penicillin 3 million units q 4 hours IV after
desensitization in the MICU without adverse reaction. Pt was
afebrile while in house, with no growth from blood cultures in
house. Vitreous fluid grew group B strep sensitive to vancomycin
and Penicillin. ID followed the patient and she must remain on
antibiotics for a minimum of six weeks. On ID follow up on the
[**6-19**], they will determine the total treatment length. A PICC
line was placed on [**2198-6-1**].
