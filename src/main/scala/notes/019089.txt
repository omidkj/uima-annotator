[**2173-7-12**] Cardiac Cath
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant circulation
revealed
severe LMCA and additional two vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA
had a 60% distal narrowing with haziness surrounding the lesion.
The LAD
had a 90% mid vessel stenosis and supplied two moderate sized
diagonal
branches that were free of obstructive disease. The LCX was
occluded at
its ostium at the proximal edge of the prior stent. Small OM
branches
filled faintly via L->L collaterals from the LAD. The RCA was
diffusely
diseased and subtotally occluded throughout its course.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed markedly elevated left and
right heart
filling pressures with an LVEDP of 30 mmHg and an RVEDP of 20
mmHg in
the setting of relative hypotension with a SBP of 93 mmHg. The
mean PCWP
was 27 mmHg with V-waves up to 41 mmHg. There was evidence of
moderate
to severe pulmonary hypertension with PA pressures of 60/26/39
mmHg. The
cardiac index was severely depressed at 1.6 L/min/m2. No
gradient across
the aortic valve was detected.
3. Due to the presence of cardiogenic shock associated with a
hazy LMCA
lesion, an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed through the
right
femoral arteriotomy after angiography of the right lower
extremity
revealed an acceptable amount of peripheral vascular disease.
4. Left ventriculography was not performed due to the markedly
elevated
left ventricular filling pressures.

[**2173-7-12**] ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may be more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Resting
regional wall motion abnormalities include inferior and
inferolateral hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

[**2173-7-13**] Carotid Ultrasound
1. 60-69 right ICA stenosis.
2. No significant left ICA stenosis.
3. High-grade right external carotid artery stenosis.

[**2173-7-27**] CXR
Findings consistent with CHF. There is probably slight interval
improvement when compared to the prior study.

[**2173-7-29**] CXR
Multiple loculated right pleural effusion, with slight decrease
in size following thoracentesis but no evidence of pneumothorax.
Stable widening of the mediastinum consistent with known fluid
collection on recent CT.

[**2173-7-29**] Abdominal Ultrasound
Cholelithiasis, without cholecystitis. Bilateral pleural
effusions.

[**2173-7-29**] Chest CT
1) Large amount of retrosternal/mediastinal fluid, and bilateral
pleural effusions, including loculated right pleural effusion.
While some amount of retrosternal fluid can be visualized up to
15 days post-median sternotomy, the amount of fluid in the
mediastinum and right pleural space is unusual, and infection
within these collections should be considered in the appropriate
clinical setting.
2) Congestive heart failure and anasarca.
3) Severe tracheomalacia demonstrated within the mid trachea,
with near complete collapse of the tracheal lumen. Once the
patient is clinically stable, a dedicated CT examination of the
trachea may be helpful in delineating the full extent of
tracheomalacia.
4) Large hiatal hernia.
5) Moderate pericardial effusion.
6) Cholelithiasis


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 48604**] was admitted to the [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1675**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Medical
Center on [**2173-7-12**] via transfer from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital. She
underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed a 90%
stenosed left anterior descending artery, an occluded right
coronary artery and an occluded circumflex artery. An
intra-aortic balloon pump was placed for coronary perfusion. An
echocardiogram was obtained which revealed an ejection fraction
of 45-50%, 3+ mitral regurgitation and inferior/inferolateral
hypokinesis. Due to the severity of her disease, Ms. [**Known lastname 48604**] was
worked-up in the usual preoperative manner. A carotid duplex
ultrasound was performed which revealed a 60-69% stenosed right
internal carotid artery and a less then 40% stenosed left
internal carotid artery. A dental consult was obtained for oral
clearance for valve surgery. Ms. [**Known lastname 48604**] was transfused for
anemia. As she had a pacemaker, the electrophysiology service
was consulted who interoggated and reprogrammed her pacemaker.
On [**2173-7-17**], Ms. [**Known lastname 48604**] was taken to the operating room where
she underwent two vessel coronary artery bypass grafting and a
mitral valve repair utilizing a 26mm [**Last Name (un) **] [**Doctor Last Name **]
