VATS

History of Present Illness:
82 yo man with history of prostate CA, hyperlipidemia, recently
diagnosed Afib (incidentally found while doing an elective hand
surgery)several mos ago, who presented to [**Hospital1 2025**] several weeks ago
([**2116-12-12**]) with pleuritic chest pain and cough with productive
green/yellow sputum; had a RUL PNA and STEMI (Troponin peak at
70 with an EKG that showed 2 mm ST segment elevation in V2-V5);
med management. Was d/c'ed on ASA and coumadin. In house, pt had
adenosine MIBI, which showed anterior apical and inferoapical
fixed defect with peri-infarct, a reversible defect; EF 65%. CXR
showed likely PNA (Prior xray [**10-8**] done at WH showed
interstitial markings c/w fibrosis). ECHO showed mild MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) **]
of 63%, mod dilated RV with depressed RVSF and mild PAH,
moderately dilated RA, mod depressed LV function.
Since discharge, pt has been doing poorly, and was re-admitted
to the [**Hospital1 18**] c/o SOB and DOE. Was in CCU from [**12-29**] till [**1-2**]
when was transferred to MICU for management of ? underlying pulm
process. His initial presentation was felt to be consistant with
subacute MI and periMI CHF as well as PNA. He has been on NRB
from admission till [**1-1**] pm when he failed a trial of BIPAP and
was intubated. He was net > 3L negative without improvement in
oxygenation. Pt was initially on dopa and vasopressin; now
vasopressin weaned off. Was initially on levofloxacin; switched
to zosyn/vanco on [**12-31**]. Initial CXR showed diffuse alveolar
opacities. [**12-31**] CT shows diffuse ground glass, multifocal
consolidations, loculated effusions.
After intubation, an attempt was made to place cordis
(unsuccessful); needs SGC to r/o decompensated CHF; then bronch
and possible VATS.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Respiratory failure: Initial differential diagnosis included
(and was felt likely a combination of these): CHF in the setting
of a recent MI, PNA, ARDS, interstitial disease or PE given RLE
DVT. There was a question of iatrogenic pneumothorax during L
subclavian line placement, which resolved on serial chest
x-rayds. Pt was clinically diagnosed with ARDS and put on ARDS
net ventilation (6cc/kg). Pt required increased PEEP of at least
10 to maintain oxygenation. Esophageal balloon was placed for a
period of time to measure more accurate PEEP. FiO2 was titrated
down to 0.50. He was empirically treated for pneumonia with
broad spectrum antibiotics of vanco, zosyn, levo. Pt was found
to be hypotensive requiring pressors and it was unclear if he
was in heart failure vs sepsis. A swan ganz catheter was placed,
which was more consistent with septic physiology. Pt was unable
to be diuresed secondary to his persistently lowish blood
pressures both on and off pressors. Bronch was performed on [**1-3**]
which was negative for legionella, fugus, viruses, DFA, PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 23463**] fluid was exudative by Light's criteria. Sputum culture
from [**1-3**] found 2+ GNR and all other culture data including
blood and urine remained negative during the hospitalization.
Pt's ESR was 84 and was ANCA and [**Doctor First Name **] negative. Serial CXRs
remained unchanged showed patchy alveolar and interstitial
opacity of the left chest greater than the right, consistent
with ARDS. CTA was negative for PE and showed biltaeraly [**Doctor First Name **]
effusion, persistent diffuse ground glass opacity with
multifocal parenchymal consolidation in an asymmetric pattern
consistent with diffuse multifocal pneumonia, ARDS, and less
likely asymmetric congestive heart failure. Repeat echo was
unchanged with slightly depressed LV systolic function (>50%),
3+ TR, and no pericardial effusion. Pt had a VATS procedure
performed by thoracic surgery on [**1-11**] with a lung biopsy which
showed chronic fibrosing lung disease predominantly of end stage
lung tissue with honeycomb change.  Very little alveolar tissue
was present in the biopsy but showed focal evidence of
organizing pneumonitis, raising the possibility of a
superimposed acute process such as infection. Some of the
histologic features of the chronic fibrosing lung disease raised
the possibility of usual interstitial pneumonia. Pt was give
high dose pulse steroids for 3 days without improvement in his
oxygenation and ventilator settings. It was felt that pt did not
have steroid responsive interestitial lung disease. Given the
fact that pt's clinical status showed no improvement over the
past several weeks and it was highly unlikely that the pt could
ever come off the ventilator, a family discussion was held and
the decision was made to make the pt [**Name (NI) 3225**]. Pt was extubated and
he expired shortly thereafter.
.
2. CV
a. Rhythm: Pt remained in Afib, which was adequately
rate-controlled on digoxin. He was anticoagulated with heparin.
Pt was noted to be in brachycardia in afib and digoxin was
discontinued.
b. Ischemia: Pt is s/p STEMI with slightly depressed LV systolic
function. Pt was continued on aspirin, statin. Antihypertensives
were held in the setting of his hypotension.
c. Pump: Ischmemic cardiomyopathy s/p MI. Swan not consistent
with cardiogenic shock; more consistent with hypovolemia,
sepsis. Severe TR could make swan readings misleaded. Pt was
bolused for CVP>12. Very little diuresis was
attempted/accomplished since he was likely clinically dry
despite total body volume overload.
.
3. RLE DVT: A large RLE DVT dx'd [**1-4**] on LE ultrasound. Pt was
continued on heparin drip, which he was already on for Afib. CTA
was negative for PE
.
4. Anemia: Most likely [**1-6**] chronic disease from Fe studies; MCV
95. Folate and B12 both normal.
.
5. FEN: NGT placed by fluoro. Given tube feeds. Lytes repleted
prn
.
6. Proph: PPI, heparin gtt
