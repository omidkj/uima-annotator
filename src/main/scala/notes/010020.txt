Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 41 year-old gentelman
who underwent an aortic valve replacement in [**2120**] for
endocarditis.  Following that procedure the patient had a
repeat bout of endocarditis and had to have the replacement
valve removed and a new one inserted.  The patient's first
aortic valve replacement was done with a bioprosthetic
valve.  Then in [**2128-3-2**] the patient's repeat AVR was
done with a Carbomedics valve.  Over the last couple of years
the patient has been followed by serial echocardiograms where
it has been noticed that his aortic root has gradually been
dilating.  Currently his aortic root is approximately dilated
at 5.8 cm with 1+ mitral regurgitation and 3+ tricuspid
regurgitation, and mild pulmonary hypertension.  The patient
was admitted for a repeat aortic valve replacement.

The patient was admitted and underwent an aortic valve
replacement surgery on [**2132-2-11**].  A #23 St. Jude
valve was placed and a graft was placed on the ascending
aorta.  The cross clamp time was 144 minutes.  The procedure
was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] and he was assisted by
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 16398**].  There were no complications during the
case and the patient tolerated the procedure well.  Following
a brief stay in the PACU the patient was transferred to the
CSRU still sedated on a Propofol drip.  The patient was also
on a nitroglycerin drip, which was titrated to maintain his
systolic blood pressure between 100 and 110.  The
nitroglycerin drip was weaned as tolerated.  Postoperative
day number one the patient had three chest tubes in place.
On postoperative day number one the patient had his TA line
and A line removed.  The nitroglycerin drip was continued to
be weaned as tolerated.  The patient was extubated without
difficulty and was able to maintain his O2 saturations
greater then 95% on nasal cannula.

The patient's postoperative course was complicated by
development of compartment syndrome following the surgery.
Vascular surgery was consulted and it was determined that the
patient needed to be returned to the Operating Room to open
up the patient's left calf.  The patient underwent a
fasciotomy on [**2132-2-12**] by vascular surgery Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  There were no complications during the surgery and
the patient tolerated this without difficulty.  The final
procedure was a left lower extremity anterior, posterior,
lateral compartment fasciotomies.  The patient was continued
to be weaned off all of his pressors and he was able to
maintain his blood pressure.  The patient still had his AV
wires attached, but was able to remain in normal sinus rhythm
without any ectopy.  On postoperative day number two the
patient had his DC pacing wires removed and the patient was
started on Coumadin for anticoagulation.  The patient's left
lower extremity continued to decrease in size and no longer
complained of any pain at that site.  The patient was seen by
renal consult for an increase in creatinine.  The patient's
creatinine had risen range of motion 1.0 to 1.5 over the
course of one day.  It was determined that the patient was
most likely experiencing some rhabdomyolysis, which caused
the creatinine to increase.  Recommendations from renal
included transfusion if the patient's hematocrit dropped to
less then 30 and to hold off on any aggressive intravenous
fluid or bicarb replacement.

By postoperative day number three it was determined that the
patient was well enough to be transferred out of the CSRU to
the surgical floor.  When the patient reached the floor he
continued to have a relatively uneventful recovery.  The
patient was seen and evaluated by physical therapy who
determined that the patient would be able to be discharged to
home following a few sessions with the physical therapist.
The patient's postoperative course on the floor was
complicated only by increase in his white blood cells.  The
patient's white blood cell count increased from approximately
13 to 20.  The patient was seen and evaluated by infectious
disease.  Multiple blood cultures, urine cultures, chest
x-rays were performed.  All of these came back negative.  The
patient never spiked a fever nor had any clinical indication
of any infection.  The patient underwent a ultrasound of the
cannulation site in his left groin, which demonstrated a
small hematoma.  As there was no fluctuance, erythema or pain
surrounding the site this was determined not to be the course
of the patient's elevated white blood cell count.  The
patient was continued to be followed for several days and his
white blood cells were monitored.  The patient continued to
not exhibit any indications of a systemic illness and the
patient's white count decreased to 13.  At this point as the
patient had been cleared by physical therapy and no obvious
source of infection had been discovered it was determined
that the patient was well enough to be discharged to home.

DI[**Last Name (STitle) 408**]E DISPOSITION:  The patient will be discharged to
home and asked to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in four
weeks.  In addition, the patient was instructed to follow up
with the clinic for which he follows his INR levels.  The
patient was also instructed to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1461**] in one to two weeks and his cardiologist in two to
three weeks.  The patient was asked to please schedule these
appointments.
