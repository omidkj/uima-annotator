Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the CCU for treatment of right
ventricular thrombosis. The risks of TPA were discussed with the
patient and he decided to pursue lysis. Prior to treatment his
oxygen saturation was in the low 90's on non-rebreather.  After
lysis his oxygen requirement decreased and he was able to breath
comfortable on 5 L NC.  He had no evidence of bleeding or any
other complications of TPA. He was continued on heparin drip
after TPA and was sent to the floor as he was hemodynamically
stable and had decreasing O2 requirements.  He was transitioned
to Lovenox and was stable and the plan was to continue Lovenox
as an outpatient.  However, on the day he was transferred to the
floor he became increasingly SOB. The house staff was called and
while examining him he went into respiratory failure and
eventually respiratory arrest.  A code was called and the
patient was found to be in PEA.  High on the differential was
new clot burden and lytics were attempted. However, despite
attempts of resuscitation for 45 minutes but was refractory to
resuscitation.  His family was notified and offered an autopsy
which they declined.
