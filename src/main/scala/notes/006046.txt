Service: Neurosurgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67-year-old
female who suffered a severe onset of headache with nausea
and vomiting.  The patient was taken to an outside hospital
where a head demonstrated a intraventricular hemorrhage and
subdural hemorrhage.

The patient deteriorated at the outside hospital.  The
patient was intubated and sedated and transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] where she was found to have a
grade 5 subarachnoid hemorrhage.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] where a
ventricular drain was placed.  The patient was monitored in
the Intensive Care Unit for close neurological observation.
An angiogram showed a large basilar tip aneurysm of 1.5 mm X
9 mm with a 9-mm neck.

Neurologic examination on admission revealed the patient was
not following commands.  The right pupil was nonreactive from
the earlier accident.  The left pupil was 3.5 down to 3 and
brisk.  The patient was localizing in the right upper
extremity greater than the left upper extremity and was
withdrawing both bilateral lower extremities.  The patient
underwent coiling of the basilar tip aneurysm.

The patient had a protracted Intensive Care Unit stay with
multiple complications, including meningitis, pneumonia, and
sepsis.  The patient's vent drain was removed on [**2102-1-25**] secondary to Pseudomonas in her cerebrospinal fluid
without clearing.

On [**2102-1-30**] the patient had a new extensive
intraventricular hemorrhage with effacement of the lateral
ventricles.  The patient's condition did not improve.  Her
neurologic status continued to remain as it was when she was
first admitted.  She was not following commands.  She was
withdrawing her lower extremities and withdrawing her upper
extremities.

The patient's family therefore made the patient comfort
measures only, and she was transferred to the regular floor.
On [**2102-2-8**] the patient was made do not
resuscitate/do not intubate and comfort measures only.  The
patient was transferred to the regular floor.  The patient
remained on comfort measures only and passed on [**2102-2-25**].
