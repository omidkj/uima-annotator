Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3021**]
Chief Complaint:
Seizure OSH ED transfer.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2112-9-21**] VATS (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery) and
pericardial window placement to drain fluid around heart.
[**2112-9-21**] Bronchoscopy.

History of Present Illness:
51F former smoker with h/o CAD/ CHF with AICD placed transfered
for seizure, intra-axial masses. Patient was in her usual state
of health until the evening of [**9-15**] when she was more tired than
usual and noted a mass in her supraclavicular fossa. The morning
of [**9-16**] she was not responding to phone calls and was found by
her husband at approximately 3pm on the couch confused. She was
incontinent of stool and urine and had bit her tounge. She
denied any chest pain at the time. Her husband called EMS and
she was brought to an OSH ED.
There she was found to have intracranial masses with apical lung
masses by CT scan. Labs remarkable there for WBC of 23.4. Elbow
films negative. She was given 1 g fosphenytoin 1g IV ceftriaxone
and 500mg IV azithromycin. Patient transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further evaluation.
Initial VS in the ED: 20:33 3 99.4 86 90/73 16 94% ra. Labs
notable for WBC of 16.9, Hct of 35.2, 231 platelets. Patient was
given 10mg IV dexamethasone and 4mg IV zofran.

On the floor, patient is comfortable and oriented. I had a
discussion about the potential that these masses could represent
cancer.
Patient reports having had a colonoscopy at 50 (1 year ago) with
a few polyps removed. Has been up to date with pap smear (all
negative) and mammography (most recently negative, but did have
a cyst removed a few years ago). Patient denies any recent
travel, exposures, sick contacts. [**Name (NI) **] recent f/c. No h/o IVDA.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denied cough, shortness of breath. Denied chest pain
or tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation or abdominal pain. No recent change in bowel or
bladder habits. No dysuria. Denied arthralgias or myalgias.

Past Medical History:

Imaging:
[**2112-9-17**]: CT C/A/P: CONCLUSION:
1.  Left upper lobe mass is suspicious for primary lung cancer.
Consolidation and ground-glass opacities around the lesion could
be related to superimposed infection or post-obstructive
pneumonitis. Multiple necrotic lymph nodes in the mediastinum,
bilateral hila and supraclavicular station are seen.
2.  Multiple bilateral lung nodules are mostly bronchiolar
consistent with an inflammatory or infectious process.  This is
accompanied by right middle lobe bronchiectasis.
3.  Pericardial effusion with slightly high density could be
neoplastic, though this is uncertain.  A cardiac son[**Name (NI) **] is
suggested to rule out tamponade.
4.  11-mm hypodense liver lesion is too small to characterize
but is
suspicious for metastasis.
.
[**2112-9-20**] ECHO: IMPRESSION: Moderate to large pericardial effusion
with evidence of impaired ventricular filling, but no frank
tamponade. Pericardial fluid distribution is poorly suitable for
needle pericardiocentesis via the subxiphoid approach. Extensive
regional LV wall motion abnormalities, consistent with prior
anteroseptal myocardial.
.
[**2112-9-22**] CXR: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph,
the lung volumes are unchanged.  Unchanged appearance of the
left chest tube and left pectoral pacemaker.  On today's image,
there could be a minimal left apical pneumothorax.  No evidence
of tension.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly with signs of
minimal fluid overload.  No pleural effusions.  No pneumonia.
.
[**2112-9-22**] CXR: IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumothorax following
chest tube removal.

Brief Hospital Course:
51yo woman with [**Hospital **] transferred from outside hospital for
seizure and new brain mets.  CT showed a left lung mass.
Transferred to ICU [**2112-9-18**] for hypoxia and dyspnea, likely due
to flash pulmonary edema as she improved with furosemide.
Pericardial window placed via VATS [**2112-9-21**] for a pericardial
effusion causing ventricular compromise, but no tamponade.
Bronchoscopy confirmed squamous cell CA.  She was transferred to
Oncology.  Radiation Oncology was consulted and whole brain XRT
will start on Monday as an outpatient.  This will be followed by
chemotherapy.  She will also need a PET scan as an outpatient
and possibly a port.
.
MICU Course 1:
The patient was transferred in the AM of [**2112-9-18**] with hypoxia to
83% on non rebreather, acutely short of breath. She improved
with nonrebreather, lasix, morphine, and nitro paste. The
patient put out almost 1L of urine in response to 20mg IV lasix.
She was requiring 2-3L NC by the mid afternoon and the remainder
of her vital signs were stable. Her aspirin and Plavix were
stopped due to concern for intracranial hemorrhage as well as
preparing for EBUS-guided biopsy of her lung masses later int he
week. This was discussed with cardiology. In discussion with
neurosurg, she was allowed to continue aspirin although with
recommendation for frequent neurology checks. She did have a
pericardial effusion without tamponade.
.
MICU Course 2:
She was transferred again [**2112-9-21**] to the ICU after pericardial
window and biopsy.  She arrived with a chest tube on the left
side on NC.  The chest tube was pulled [**2112-9-22**].  She was
transferred to Oncology [**2112-9-22**].
.
# Seizure: Due to new brain mets.  Given fosphenytoin at outside
hospital.  Neuro-oncology consulted.  No recurrence.  Continued
