Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 45556**]
Chief Complaint:
GI bleeding, respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p central line placement


History of Present Illness:
68-year-old male with a history of hypertension and gout who is
being treated on the biologics service with IL-2 for metastatic
melanoma.  He began the protocol on Monday and had been
tollerating the TID IL-2 infusions, but had a decline in his
plts from 200 to 56 as well as a 11# weight gain attributed to
capillary leak.  He also had significant electrolyte imbalances,
tachycardia, and tachypnea expected from this protocol.
   On the day of [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] transfer, patient had some mild epigastric
discomfort and complained to his daughter of heartburn.  Of
note, he was on daily indocin while on IL-2 therapy.  At 10pm,
he developed some diarrhea and then had an episode of nausea and
vomiting.  The covering MD noted 2 very large blood clotts in
the emesis.  Noted increased RR of 40s, was 84% on RA and then
improved to 100% on 4L NC.  Biologics attending was not
concerned about other parameters, but was worried abt bleeding
as patient may be at risk for bleeding given his plts have
dropped in the past few days.
  Brought to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], GI team asks for FFP, plts.  Pt has guiac
positive brown stools, but complains of hemorrhoids and some
rectal irritation that may be contributing.  Holding on NG
lavage unless patient becomes unstable.  First two hcts are
stable.

Past Medical History:
Onc Hx per OMED notes:
Pt was diagnosed with melanoma in [**4-/2167**] when he was found to
have a mole on his left abdomen.  He underwent wide local
excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy at that time which
revealed no residual melanoma and the 3 sentinel nodes were
negative.  Two years later in [**4-18**], he developed a red raised
nodule under the scar of the local excision.  This was reexcised
and he subsequently did well until [**8-/2169**] when he had another
satellite recurrence and reexcision.  He then had a third
satellite recurrence and reexcision in [**10/2169**] and was then
started on interferon therapy that was stopped [**2-15**] side effects.
Recent PET/CT done revealed a left axillary lymphadenopathy as
well as 2 liver lesions.

Pertinent Results:
CXR PORTABLE [**3-27**]
IMPRESSION: Minimal patchy basilar opacities likely due to
atelectasis. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
.
[**2170-3-31**] CXR PORTABLE
IMPRESSION: New diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities
compatible with pulmonary edema.
.
[**2170-3-31**]
CHEST XR: A single AP supine view is compared to previous
examination earlier from the same day. Again seen extensive
bilateral parenchymal opacities suggesting pulmonary edema.
There is more dense consolidation in left lower lobe with air
bronchogram, compatible with pneumonia. There is a new
endotracheal tube with the tip overlying T3.
.
[**2170-4-2**]
BILATERAL LE DOPPLER
IMPRESSION: No evidence of lower extremity DVT.
.
ECHO [**2170-4-2**]: EF>60%
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal.
3. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Right
ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6. There is a trivial pericardial effusion.
.
[**2170-4-4**] RENAL US
IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple left kidney stones, the largest measuring 2.1 cm in
the mid pole. No evidence of hydronephrosis. Multiple parapelvic
cysts.
2. Right kidney stone. No evidence of hydronephrosis.
.
[**2170-4-7**] LIVER/GB ULTRASOUND
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of intra- or extrahepatic biliary ductal
dilation. No evidence of cholecystitis. 1.3 cm shadowing
gallstone.
2. Two hypoechoic liver lesions likely corresponding to the
lesions seen on CT. Metastatic disease to the liver is within
the differential.
.
[**2170-4-9**] CXR
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**4-2**] and 24:
Left lower lobe consolidation is clearing, probably resolving
atelectasis. Pulmonary vascular congestion is present but edema
has not returned. Azygous distention indicates volume overload.
Heart size is top normal. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
ET tube and right subclavian line are in standard placements and
a nasogastric tube passes through the mid stomach and out of
view.

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the day of [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] transfer, [**2170-3-29**], patient
had some mild epigastric discomfort and complained to his
daughter of heartburn. Of note, he was on daily indocin while on
IL-2 therapy. At 10pm, he developed some diarrhea and then had
an episode of nausea and vomiting. The covering MD noted 2 very
large blood clots in the emesis. Noted increased RR of 40s, was
84% on RA and then improved to 100% on 4L NC. Biologics
attending was not concerned about other parameters, but was
worried about bleeding as patient may be at risk for bleeding
given his plts have dropped in the past few days.
.
Brought to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], GI team requested FFP, plts. Pt has guiac
positive brown stools, and complained of hemorrhoids and some
rectal irritation that may be contributing. He was not scoped
emergently that night, and his vitals were closely followed,
along with Hct.  His Hct was noted to be stable, with stable VS,
and no episodes of melena.  GI felt no emergent need for EGD.
He is receiving PPI [**Hospital1 **].  On [**4-1**], the pt was intubated for
respiratory distress secondary to pulmonary edema thought to be
secondary to capillary leak syndrome from HD IL-2.  He underwent
diuresis and was started on levo/flagyl for ?LLL PNA, started
[**3-31**].  On [**4-3**], levo/flagyl d/c'd as all cx negative, pt
afebrile.  Another reason abx d/c'd was b/c pt developed a rash
thought to be a drug hypersensitivity reaction, which improved
post d/c abx.  ID was consulted [**4-4**] for continued fevers and
recommended the initiation of broad spectrum abx incl.
Vancomycin, Aztreonam, and Flagyl (stopped [**4-8**]), RUQ US to r/o
cholangitis (b/c pt had elev LFTs), and stated would not give
steroids, and would do bronchoscopy/BAL for most likely pulm
source.  Chest CT demonstrated b/l lower lobe infiltrates c/w
pulm edema vs. PNA.  Pt underwent Bronch [**4-5**], showing limited
eval of right sided airways, lavage with RLL post segment,
result: no PMN, no microorg, grew OP flora, PCP negative, AFB
negative.  Vancomycin was continued for ? line infection, and
b/c the pt had difficult access, his line was continued for 19
days.  He has been on Vanco for 8 days. The pt's LFT elevation
was attributed to IL-2 therapy, a known side effect.
