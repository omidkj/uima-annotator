Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea with minimal exertion. Fatigue.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2181-7-2**] Redo-sternotomy, Mitral valve replacement ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 17009**] [**Male First Name (un) 923**]
tissue) , Tricuspid valve repair (#28 ring)


History of Present Illness:
61 year old female with history of rheumatic heart disease who
underwent a mitral valve repair in [**2170**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**]. More
recently she has noted worsening heart failure symptoms which
include dyspnea with minimal exertion. She has been followed for
what is believed to be significant mitral stenosis, secondary
pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular dysfunction with
interventricular dependence in the setting of severe tricuspid
regurgitation related to the mitral stenosis. As her symptoms
have worsened, a repeat echo was obtained which showed trivial
mitral stensosis with severe 4+ tricuspid regurgitation. Given
the severity of her disease and the progression of her symptoms
despite an escalating medical therapy, she has been referred for
surgical evaluation.

Past Medical History:
1. Rheumatic valve disease, status post mitral valve repair for
severe MR, with residual mild mitral stenosis.
2. Secondary pulmonary hypertension and severe tricuspid
regurgitation due to mitral stenosis.

11. Left knee bursitis and cellulitis.
12. Pancreatitis
13. Lupus
14. H/O labial herpes/PID
15. Headaches
16. Chronic lower back pain

7. [**11/2166**] - Laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

meniscectomy. Chondroplasty of medial femoral condyle. Lysis of
medial plica.
9. [**4-/2175**] - 1. Right great toe Akin osteotomy. 2. Second

Pertinent Results:
Echo [**2181-7-2**]: PRE BYPASS The left atrium is dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. The right atrium is dilated. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
borderline normal free wall function. [Intrinsic right
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] There is abnormal
diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular volume overload. There are simple atheroma in the
ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve is s/p
repair. The annular ring is well seated. The gradient across the
mitral valve is increased (mean = 9 mmHg). There is severe
valvular mitral stenosis (area <1.0cm2) using the PISA method.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. Systolic reversal
of blood flow in the inferior vena cava is seen. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was
notified in person of the results in the operating room at the
time of the study.
POST BYPASS The patient was initially AV paced but then
transitioned to sinus rhythm. She was receiving epinephrine,
norepinephrine, and milrinone by infusion. There is some septal
dyssynchrony but overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal. The right ventricular free wall appears dyskinetic. In
total, right ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed. There is a bioprosthesis located in the mitral
position. It appears well seated and the leaflets appear to have
normal mobility. There is trace valvular mitral regurgitation.
The maximum gradient through the valve was 16 mmHg with a mean
of 4 mmHg at a cardiac output of around 4 liters/minute. The
tricuspid valve is s/p placement of a valvuloplasty ring. It
appears well seated. There is at least mild tricuspid
regurgitation seen, though it may be as much as mild to
moderate. The thoracic aorta is intact after decannulation. No
other significant changes from the pre-bypass study.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 23081**] was a same day admit and on [**7-2**] was brought
directly to the operating room where she underwent a
redo-sternotomy, mitral valve replacement and tricuspid valve
repair. Please see operative note for surgical details.
Following surgery she was transferred to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring in stable condition. She was received from the OR on
Epinephrine/Levophed/Milrinone. She was weaned off epineprhine
and levophed by POD#1. She was kept on Milrinone until POD#2 and
this subsequently weaned with good c
