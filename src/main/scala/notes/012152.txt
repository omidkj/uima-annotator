Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia, cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotrachial intubation

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 70 yo man w/ h/o COPD, O2 dependant (on 2L NC at home)
presented to ED w/ c/o dyspnea, orthopnea, cough x 1 day.
On presentation to [**Name (NI) **], pt noted to be hypoxic to 80% on home O2
--> 90's on 3-4L, BP initially 99 --> 120's w/ IVF, afebrile.
Noted to be using accessory muscles to breath and was tripoding,
improved somewhat w/ non-rebreather, but c/o tiring, so was
intubated.  Peri-intubation, had transient decrease BP to 80's
--> 100 w/ IVF.
In [**Name (NI) **], pt was evaluated w/ CXR demonstrating R > L infiltrates,
so was given cefepime and levoflox.  Also got solumedrol 125mg

decided no intervention in cath lab for now.  Pt started on
heparin gtt, given ASA, plavix load, no BB given COPD, no nitro
gtt b/c no c/o CP and borderline low BPs.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Respiratory failure:
Patient has a history of severe COPD, O2 and steroid dependent,
and presents with acute worsening SOB requiring intubation on
presentation.  Initial CXR demonstrated bilateral lower lobes
opacities consistent with multifocal pneumonia.  He had DFA sent
which was positive for influenza A.  He was treated with both a
5 day course of tamiflu as well as Ceftriaxone and azithromycin
for a possible underlying pneumonia.
He was also treated for COPD flare, as his lung exam was quite
wheezy on initial presentation, so was treated with solumedrol,
converted to prednisone taper, as well as combivent MDI.
Patient underwent extubation during MICU course with failure x
2, requiring re-intubation.  There was felt to be a volume
overload component, as the patient was quite hypertensive
peri-extubation, leading to volume overload in his lungs.  His
BP and volume status were optimized prior to 2nd extubation, but
this also faiiled due to tachypnea --> autopeep, requiring
re-intubation.  He then was tried on permissive hypercapnea, by
increasing his sedation, decreasing his respiratory rate, and
allowing his PaCO2 increase (as at baseline patient's HCO3 in
30's, so likely lives at PaCO2 in 60's).  His anti-anxiety
regimen was also optimized as it was felt that he had a large
anxiety component peri-extubation causing tachypnea -->
autopeep.  3rd extubation attempt occurred on [**1-19**] and was
successful. The patient was stable on 5l NC.  He is on home 2-4L
NC and prednisone 5 mg daily. He was also started on advair
500/50 [**Hospital1 **] and spiriva.  He was kept on albuterol MDI prn, and
taken off atrovent because of mucus plugging.

2. STEMI:  Pt noted to have 1mm STE in leads V1, V2, V3 in ED.
Also positive cardiac enzymes (elevated index and trop, but CK
peak only 157).  Cardiology notified on presentation and opted
not to take patient to cath lab urgently.  Patient was initially
started on heparin drip x 48 hrs (now off), started aspirin
325mg PO daily, plavix load given in ED then maintained on
plavix 75mg daily, maintained on beta blocker and started on
lipitor 80mg daily.  ECHO during hospital course was of poor
quality, but demonstrated a depressed ejection fraction of
45-50%, septal hypokinesis, could not assess for focal wall
abnormalities.  Cardiology followed along during hospital course
but deferred catheterization.  He will need cardiology follow
up.

3. Hypotension:  Patient with episode of hypotension in ED, very
fluid responsive per report.  Felt to be due to dehydration
given infection, less likely sepsis given nromal lactate in ED,
also contribution of intubation/medication given
peri-intubation.  BP resolved with IVF on day of admission and
remained stable/hypertensive (as above) during hospital course.
He was continued on his home [**Last Name (un) **] and started on metoprolol and
uptitrated to 75 mg tid.

4. Anemia:  Patient with Hematocrit drop from 34 --> 24 on
admission.  Baseline Hct appears to be around 30.  Felt to be
hemoconcentrated on admission, dilutional with IVF.  Hct
returned to baseline and remained at baseline during remainder
of hospital course.

5. Nephrolithiasis/CKD: Patient with baseline Cr 1.5, at
baseline on presentation, remained at baseline throughout
hospital course.  Has Left sided nephrostomy tube in place to be
follow up as an outpatient.

6. Urinary tract infection:  Patient had positive U/A on
admission.  Urine culture grew e coli and enterococcus, now
status post antibiotic therapy.

7. Hypertension:  Managed with diovan and metoprolol,
transiently on nitroglycerin drip peri-extubation.

8. Atrial fibrillation:  Patient with history of AFib in setting
of intubation in past.  Not anti-coagulated.  Digoxin was held
on admission, patient remained in normal sinus rhythm.  He will
be treated with a beta blocker and continued on full aspirin. He
will need cardiology follow up.

10. Anxiety:  Per history, patient with large anxiety component
to shortness of breath, has led to difficulty extubating in
past.  Noted during hospital course with failed extubations as
above.  Managed with zyprexa PRN, precedex peri-extubation.  Had
paradoxical reaction to ativan, so benzos were avoided.
