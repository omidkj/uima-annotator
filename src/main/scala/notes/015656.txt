History of Present Illness:
43 year old man who presented to [**Hospital3 4107**] on [**2178-4-13**] with
productive cough, fever and pleuritic chest pain. He was found
to be hypoxemic on arrival with sats 86% on RA, ABG
7.36/32/71/18. He reported associated pleuritic chest pain,
generalized weakness, diaphoresis and anorexia. Initially was
noted to be in SVT, given adenosine with conversion to sinus.
CXR showed moderate RLL consolidation, small RUL consolidation,
patchy infiltrates in LUL (differential included pneumonitis,
pulmonary hemorrhage versus ARDS). He was intubated for
respiratory failure and concern for ARDS. Sedation was difficult
and required fentanyl, ativan, propofol and vecuronium. He was
ventilated on pressure control. He had hypotension requiring
both norepinephrine and vasopressin for pressor support. He was
given ceftriaxone, azithromycin and vancomycin. Sputum culture
grew Strep pneumonia and [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans on [**2178-4-13**].
Bronchoscopy showed diffuse thick dark yellow secretions
throughout the entire tracheobronchial tree. BAL grew Strep
pneumonia (PCP and fungal cultures pending). Influenza negative.
Fungal cultures including acid fast bacilli cultures are
pending. Blood cultures were positive for Strep pneumonia on
[**2178-4-13**]. Opportunisitic infections were considered, but HIV
testing was not obtained. He was also noted to have acute kidney
injury with creatinine 3.7 and BUN 64. He was seen by nephrology
at the OSH who suspected ATN and recommended continued IV
hydration. Creatinine trended down to 1.9 prior to transfer.
.
On arrival to the MICU, he was intubated and sedated, on
pressure support ventilation, comfortable appearing. Pressors
weaned on arrival with MAP >65.
.

PERTINENT LABS:

MICRO:

IMAGING:
[**4-15**] CXR: The patient is intubated. The tip of the endotracheal
tube is located directly at the carina. The tube should be
pulled back by 2 to 3 cm. The patient has a right subclavian
line. The tip of the line projects over the lower SVC. There are
extensive areas of lung parenchymal opacities and
consolidations, slightly more extensive on the left than on the
right, with extensive air bronchograms but no evidence of
pleural effusions. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.
Despite the history of streptococcal infection, the possibility
of ARDS should be considered.
.
[**4-20**] ECHO: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity
size. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac
index is high (>4.0L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a
normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic
valve. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal study. No valvular pathology or pathologic
flow identified.
.
[**4-21**] CT Chest w/o con:
1. Extensive ground-glass opacity is consistent with diffuse
infection. An
additional component of pulmonary edema is possible, given the
accompanying septal thickening.
2. Three large thick-walled cavitary lesions likely represent a
necrotizing pneumonia in this patient with prior streptococcal
bacteremia. A fourth smaller caviation and non-cavitary
consolidation are also present. Note that the plain radiographic
appearence of diffuse pulmonary opacity has improved since [**4-15**].
.
[**4-22**] CT Head w/o con:
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Bilateral mastoid air cell fluid-opacification. Given the
documented Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, this may
represent infectious otomastoiditis, rather than simply
effusions due recent intubation and prolonged supine
positioning.
.
[**4-23**] MRI Head w/ and w/o con:
1. No evidence of infection, inflammation, infarction, or
hemorrhage within brain.
2. Pansinusitis and bilateral mastoid opacification.

Brief Hospital Course:
43 year man with history of etoh abuse who presented to [**Hospital1 2519**] on [**2178-4-13**] with productive cough, fever, bandemia and
respiratory failure, found to have Strep pneumonia with septic
shock and [**Hospital **] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
.
# Septic shock: Secondary to Strep pneumonia with positive blood
and sputum cultures at [**Hospital3 4107**]. He was treated initially
with ceftriaxone, later broadened to cefepime and ciprofloxacin
due to lack of improvement on the ventilator. Blood cultures on
[**4-16**] revealed GPC in clusters, prompting intitiation of
vancomycin. Bronchoscopy with BAL was performed on [**4-18**] to
evaluate for additional pulmonary pathogens and was negative.
There was initial concern for HIV, however CD4 count was wnl and
HIV viral load was undetectable. He was initially improving on
the antibiotics but then spiked fevers on [**4-20**] and [**4-21**]. CT chest
on [**4-21**] revealed three large thick-walled cavitary lesions likely
represent a necrotizing pneumonia. ID was consulted and he was
treated empirically for VAP with linezolid, cefepime,
tobramycin, and flagyl. He continued to improve so antibiotics
were narrowed to ceftriaxone with transition to levofloxacin and
flagyl and the patient will complete a 14-day course of
levofloxacin and flagyl which will end on [**2178-5-5**].
.
# ARDS: Suspected due to underyling Strep pneumonia. He was
ventilated with ARDS net protocol although sedation was very
difficult (likely due to underlying alcohol use of 4+ drinks
daily).  He was initially sedated wi
