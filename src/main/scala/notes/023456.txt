Chief Complaint:
DOE

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

Cardiac cath s/p stent
s/p Intubation


History of Present Illness:
84yo F with h/o interstitial lung disease, COPD, and CAD, with
known abnl stress test [**10-29**], who has noted 6 mo of increasing
DOE. No CP, palps, LE edema, orthop, PND, or med changes. For
the past two days, has c/o worsening of her usual non-productive
cough and fatigue. No fever, sick contacts.

Went to pulmonologist 2 days PTA to OSH, who started pt on 60mg
po prednisone for COPD flare, no abx. 2 days ([**2-17**]) later saw no
improvement, and pt presented to OSH after increased SOB; EMS
found pt with O2 sat of 86%RA with decreased mentation. In ER pt
had JVD 8cm, EKG NSR with old LBBB, WBC 12.5, CK 116, Trop .2.
Given lasix, MSO4, lovenox, BB, aspirin, for NSTEMI and CHF. Pt
had adenosine myoview showing large, severe reversible anterior
wall defect.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath. In holding area, had respiratory
failure and was intubated.

In cath, had stent of 90% diag and 80% RCA. Given 80 IV lasix.
On floor on night of admission, noted to be tachycardic with low
BP's (80-100's). Hct noted to have dropped from 43 on admission
to 35 at noon, to 28 at 1am. Emergent CT abdomen showed moderate
sized bilateral pleural effusions (blood or pus by attenuation),
and suggestion of pericardial effusion. CK's noted to be
positive and increasing.

Cath:
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease complicated by acute
pulmonary
edema and cardiogenic shock.
2. Severe congestive heart failure.
3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
4. Bilateral renal artery stenosis.
5. Successful PCI of the LAD/D1.
6. Successful PCI of the RCA.

Echo:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is severe regional left
ventricular systolic
dysfunction with near akinesis of the inferior wall and the
inferior and
anterior septum. The distal half of the anterior wall and apex
are also
hypokinetic. No left ventricularaneurysm or thrombus is seen.
Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve
leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion.
There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be quantified.
There is a
prominent anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.


IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with extensive
regional
systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD. Mild mitral
regurgitation. No
significant pericardial effusion.

Based on [**2145**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings
indicate a moderate risk (prophylaxis recommended). Clinical
decisions
regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical
and
echocardiographic data.

CXR:
1. Interval improvement in previously evident multifocal
airspace and interstitial opacities.
2. Interval decrease in size of bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Persistent asymmetric right apical pleural thickening.

EKG:
Sinus tachycardia
Possible left atrial abnormality
Left bundle branch block with repolarization changes
Since previous tracing, heart rate has slowed and ST changes are
less
pronounced


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 58884**] is an 84 y.o. female with CAD, COPD, ILD, who p/w
NSTEMI and CHF, hypercarbic respiratory failure in holding area
awaiting cath requiring intubation, now s/p PTCA with stents to
LAD/diag and RCA.

1. CAD: Pt presents with NSTEMI with cath showing three vessel
disease s/p stents to LAD/Diag and RCA.  CK peaked post-cath
around 400 and trended down.  PCP to set up with outpt
cardiologist.

2. Pump: CHF, EF 35-40%.  Diuresed post cath and ultimately
extubated and weaned to 2L NC.

3. Pleural effusions:  Discovered on CT scan done on day after
admission for evaluation of dropping hct.  Unclear etiology.
Effusions with hounsfield units consistent with blood.  Repeat
CXR improving on [**2-26**].

4. Ventilator:  Pt. with h/o ILD secondary to radiation, COPD,
therefore likely CO2 retention.  Extubated s/p 2 days on vent,
doing well.  O2 weaned to 2L.  Pt seen by physical therapy who
determined pt has need for home O2 (~85% on RA).

5. GIB with Hct drop: Guiaic positive non-melanotic stool,
likely promoted by [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **].  Hct stable after 1 U PRBCs.
Outpt GI workup.  Will see PCP on [**Name9 (PRE) 2974**] [**3-2**].

6. Renal artery stenosis: Not that significant given BP peaks
around 160 and renal function is normal (Cr = 0.7).  [**Month (only) 116**] need
cath in future for renal aa if worsens.

7. FEN - low Na/heart healthy diet

Code - Full.
