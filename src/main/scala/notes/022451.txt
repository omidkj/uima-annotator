History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness: The patient is an 89 year old female
with h/o CVA with residual cognitive deficits, hypothyroidsim,
diastolic heart failure, HTN, hypothyroidism who presents with
SOB and atrial fibrillation.

At [**Hospital3 537**], she was noted to be in a tachyarrhytmia, and
hypotension to the 70s systolic. She was given 1 L NS in the
ride over from [**Last Name (un) **] to the ED.

In the ED, initial VS were 150 93/55 24 98% RA. On the flow
sheet she was noted to by hypotension to the 70s systolic at 1
PM.

On transfer, 98.1 71 79/46 16 100%.

Labs notable for a normal U/A, Lactate 1.5, Trop 0.01, MCV 101,
Plt 458, INR 2.5.

CXR showed on single frontal view no pleural effusion, PTX, or
focal airspace consolidation. L sided pacemaker terminates in
the R venticle, unchanged from 11 days prior. Unchanged lead
position.

She received 1.5 L NS in total, 5 mg IV Metoprolol, and
Levofloxacin 750 mg IV.

Patient was recently admitted and had a VVI Pacemaker placement
[**2107-7-11**]. Per the ED, she is without chest pain or shortness of
breath, mostly complains of feeling cold and weak. No headache,
no nausea vomiting. No fevers or chills, no abdominal pain, no
diarrhea.

The daughter, who is HCP, suspects that she does not take good
PO and also believed there might have been a metoprolol dosing
error in the past.

On arrival to the MICU, she is AAOx3 and comfortable.

CXR [**2107-7-23**]: SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST: There is no
pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation.
The heart size is top normal. The mediastinal contours are
normal. A left side pacemaker is intact with its wire
terminating in the right ventricle. Its location appears
unchanged from approximately 11 days prior.
IMPRESSION: Unchanged lead position.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 89 year old female with h/o CVA with residual
cognitive deficits, hypothyroidsim, diastolic heart failure,
HTN, hypothyroidism who presents with atrial flutter and
hypotension.

# Hypotension: Multiple etiolgies are possible, but was felt to
be most likely  rapid venticular rate causing poor forward flow
causing hypotension. Other etiologies could include volume
status, or infection. Volume status based on UOP, lytes, and
exam appears to be normal. Infection has been worked up with
normal blood cultures to date, negative U/A, no skin
impairments, no fever, no WBC count, and without CXR findings.
Hypotension was not secondary to a pericardial effusion, given a
bedside ECHO which did not show this. She did not appear
hypovolemic on labsgive mild enlagment of sillhoute on x-ray,
mildly low voltages, and recent instrumentation. She responded
well to 75 mg metoprolol TID, and was discharged on 150 mg XL
metoprolol

# Atrial Flutter: Patient appears to have a 3:1-4:1 atrial
flutter. Etiologies of atrial fibrilation/flutter could include
hyper or hypovolemic states, MI, infection, electrolyte
abnormalities, or thyroid dysfunction. Patient appears euvolemic
as described above. She ruled out for an MI, and did not have
lyte abnormalities. Her TSH was also normal.

# Hypothyroid:
- Continue home synthroid.

# [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]:
- home hydroxyurea.

# Prior CVA:
- Continue home ASA and statin.

# Presumed Emphysemia: No note of this in her recent history,
but given large lung volumes and smoking history would favor
this as the etiology for her medication Fluticasone-Salmeterol
- Continue Fluticasone-Salmeterol

# Insomnia:
- continue mirtazapine QHS
