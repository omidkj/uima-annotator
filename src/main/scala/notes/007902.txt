Pathology [**2182-11-27**]
Left mainstem tumor, debridement:

1.  Squamous and respiratory epithelium with reactive epithelial
atypia, necrosis, fibrosis, acute and chronic inflammation with
abscess formation and granulation tissue.
2.  Small nodule consistent with Actinomycotic granule.
3.  Multiple levels are examined.
Echo
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Compared with the prior
study (images reviewed) of [**2181-9-14**], the findings are similar.

CT CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:

IMPRESSION:

1. Interval increase in soft tissue material within the left
main stem
bronchial stent and segmental airways immediately distal to the
stent. Marked interval increase in postobstructive consolidation
in the left lower lobe.

2. Overall increase in multifocal ground-glass opacities,
particularly in the right lower lobe, compatible with chronic
infection.

3. Otherwise, stable marked bronchiectasis in the left upper
lobe, right
middle lobe and lingula.

Radiology Report QUANTITATIVE LUNG SCAN Study Date of [**2182-11-26**]
Regional analysis of tracer distribution in the lungs shows:

RIGHT LUNG: Perfusion/Ventilation
Upper Third 18% / 11%
Middle Third 29% / 36%
Lower Third 38% / 21%

LEFT LUNG: Perfusion/Ventilation
Upper Third 5% / 10%
Middle Third 8% / 15%
Lower Third 4% / 7%

TOTAL Perfusion/Ventilation
Right lung: 84%/68%
Left lung: 16%/32%

IMPRESSION: Hypoperfusion and hypoventilation of the left lung.
