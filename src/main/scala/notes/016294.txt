CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient had a recent admission for a
myocardial infarction, referred for cardiothoracic surgery.
He is a scheduled outpatient admission.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 58-year-old male admitted with
congestive heart failure on [**2177-8-12**] with new onset
rapid atrial fibrillation and positive non-Q-wave myocardial
infarction, who underwent cardiac catheterization during that
admission which showed 3-vessel disease with an ejection
fraction of 27% and 30% left main.  An echocardiogram also
done during that admission showed 1+ mitral regurgitation, 1+
tricuspid regurgitation, and decreased left ventricular
function.  He was referred to cardiac surgery for coronary
artery bypass graft and admitted on [**8-21**] to the operating
room for coronary artery bypass graft.

4.  Status post LCE in [**2175**].
5.  Right toe amputation in [**2173**].
6.  Cyst removed from right ankle with skin graft also in
[**2173**].

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Preoperative medications included
Glucotrol 10 mg p.o. b.i.d., Avandia 4 mg p.o. q.d.,
Precose 100 mg p.o. t.i.d., monopril 20 mg p.o. q.d.,
Lovenox 100 mg p.o. b.i.d., and atenolol (dose unavailable).

ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives alone.  Tobacco history was one and
a half to three packs per day times 40 years.  He quit one
week ago.  Social ethanol drinker only.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Preoperatively, heart
rate 80, blood pressure 127/70, respiratory rate 18, height
was 5 feet 8 inches, weight was 207 pounds. In general, a
well-appearing 58-year-old male in no acute distress.  Skin
was intact.  HEENT was unremarkable.  Neck was supple.  No
lymphocytes.  No thyromegaly.  Chest revealed lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Slightly decreased breath
sounds in the bilateral bases.  Heart was regular.  No
murmurs were noted.  Abdomen was obese, soft, ecchymotic area
from the Lovenox, nontender, and nondistended, positive bowel
sounds.  Extremities were warm and pale with no edema.
Varicosities were none.  Neurologically, grossly intact.
Femoral pulses were 2+ bilaterally, dorsalis pedis on the
right was 0, on the left 1+, posterior tibialis were 2+ on
the right, and 1+ on the left, radial were 2+ bilaterally.
No carotid bruits.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:   Urinalysis was negative.
Potassium of 5, BUN of 12, creatinine of 0.8.  Hematocrit
was 37.5.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Electrocardiogram showed atrial
fibrillation with a rate in the 70s.

Chest x-ray showed diffuse interstitial disease, opacity at
the right base.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   On [**8-21**], the patient was a direct
admission to the operating room where he underwent coronary
artery bypass graft times four which included a left internal
mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery, and
saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal, and saphenous vein
graft to PL and to posterior descending artery sequentially.

He tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the
operating room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.
The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period.
He arrived in the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit and was
hemodynamically stable on Neo-Synephrine at 1.5 mg/kg/min.
His respiratory status was good, and he was reversed from his
anesthesia, weaned from the ventilator, and extubated within
the first several hours of arriving in the Cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit.

Overnight, he continued to have moderate output from his
chest tubes. For that, he received 2 units of fresh frozen
plasma, 1 unit of packed red blood cells, CellCept,
protamine; so that by morning his chest tube output had
diminished significantly.  However, it was decided to leave
his chest tubes in on postoperative day one to further
monitor any drainage.

During the course of postoperative day one, he was weaned
from his Neo-Synephrine, and early in the afternoon of
postoperative day one he was transferred from the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit to Far Six for continuing
postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.

Because of the patient's history of new onset atrial
fibrillation, an Electrophysiology consultation was obtained
on postoperative day one.

On the recommendation of Cardiology the patient was begun on
heparin for his atrial fibrillation starting on postoperative
day two.  He was scheduled for a transesophageal
echocardiogram and electrocardioversion prior to discharge.
Over the next several days, the patient remained
hemodynamically stable.  His respiratory status was quite
good.  His activity level was slowly increased over the first
three postoperative days, so that on postoperative day four
he was deemed stable and ready for discharge.  However, he
still needed to undergo his electrocardioversion so he was
kept n.p.o. beginning at midnight of postoperative day four
and was brought to the Cardiology Department for his
transesophageal echocardiogram prior to an
electrocardioversion.

The transesophageal echocardiogram showed a dilated left
ventricle with an ejection fraction of 25%, dilated atria
with moderate mitral regurgitation, trace tricuspid
regurgitation, aortic insufficiency, and pulmonary
insufficiency.  No left atrial thrombus was noted.  The
patient then underwent an elective cardioversion.  He was
shocked at 100 joules and went into sinus rhythm with a rate
of 45 to 50.  However, he then returned to atrial
fibrillation at a rate of 70.  He was bolused with amiodarone
orally and returned to Far Six for continuing postoperative
care.

The patient continued to progress in his activity level
throughout postoperative day four, and on the morning on
postoperative day five his activity level was deemed
sufficient and safe for him to be discharged to home.
Arrangements were made for the patient be discharged to home
with [**First Name (Titles) 407**] [**Last Name (Titles) 21150**] and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts
monitor on postoperative day five.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  At that time, his
physical examination was as follows:  Vital signs were
temperature of 98.4, heart rate 87 atrial fibrillation, blood
pressure 128/72, respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 95%
on room air.  Weight preoperatively was 94.2 kg; on discharge
was 98.5 kg.  Physical examination revealed alert and
oriented times three.  He moved all extremities and followed
commands.  Breath sounds were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Heart sounds were a regular rate and rhythm, S1
and S2, with no murmurs.  Sternum was stable.  Incision with
staples, open to air.  A small amount of serous drainage from
the distal pole of his sternal incision.  Abdomen was soft,
nontender, and nondistended, with normal active bowel sounds.
Extremities were warm and well perfused with no clubbing,
cyanosis or edema.  Left leg incision with Steri-Strips open
to air, clean and dry.

LABORATORY DATA ON DISCHARGE:  White blood cell count 9,
hematocrit 25, platelets 170.  Sodium 134, potassium 4.7,
chloride 99, bicarbonate 27, BUN 17, creatinine 0.8,
glucose 150.  PT 17.4, INR 2.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  (Medications on discharge include)
 1.  Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. t.i.d. times four weeks, then
