Chest pain

History of Present Illness:
54 yo male with history of coronary artery disease status post
coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2145**] to 4 vessels. Past
medial history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia and
a strong family history. He has been having intermittent chest
pain for the past year, accelerating over the past 2 weeks and
developed [**10-2**] substernal chst pain at rest yesterday morning
relieved with 2 sublingual nitroglycerin. The chest pain
recurred every 1 hr and he took 2 sublingual nitroglycerin
tablets everytime until 4am until he finally took 6 tablets with
no relief thus prompting a visit to an outside emergency
department. He reports that his chest pain is pressure like,
[**10-2**] with radiation to both arms, his neck and his back. He
notes diaphoresis, dyspnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
orthopnea, but no palpitations.  At baseline, he cannot walk up
1 flight of stairs.  AT [**Hospital1 1474**]' emergency [**Hospital1 **], he became free
of chest pain after intravenous nitroglycerin. An EKG there
showed an intraventricular conduction delay and a left bundle
branch block with 1mm concordant ST depression in V3-V6 as well
as T-Wave inversions in leads I and aVL. He was then  tranferred
to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1675**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for cardiac
catheterization.

[**2163-11-18**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Severe native three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. SVG to RCA and SVG to OM occluded.
4. LIMA to LAD patent with collaterals to the rest of the heart.

5. Mildly depressed ventricular systolic function.
6. Moderate to severe diastolic dysfunction

[**2163-11-18**] Pathology
Mr. [**Known lastname **] has a newly identified clincially significant
alloantibody- anti-Fya. Fya is a member of the [**Doctor Last Name 5239**] blood group
system. Anti-Fya can cause hemolytic transfusion reactions. In
the future he should receive Fya antigen negative red cells for
transfusion. An antibody identification card will be sent to
him.

[**2163-11-19**] EKG
Sinus rhythm 77. Anterolateral ST-T changes suggest myocardial
injury/ischemia.

[**2164-11-22**] EKG
Sinus rhythm. Modest non-specific intraventricular conduction
delay.
Non-specific lateral ST-T wave abnormalities are non-specific
but cannot
exclude ischemia. Clinical correlation is suggested. Since the
previous tracing of [**2163-11-22**] ST-T wave abnormalities have
decreased.

[**2163-11-19**] CXR
The heart size is upper limits of normal. There is no evidence
of congestive failure or acute infiltrate. The patient has had a
CABG.

[**2163-11-26**] CXR
1) Stable appearance of postop, retrosternal and mediastinal
emphysema, without evidence of displaced sternal wires.
2) Mild bilateral atelectasis, and likely small left-sided
pleural effusion, without evidence of infiltrate.

[**2163-11-21**] ECHO
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is
elongated.
2.The right atrium is moderately dilated.
3. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Resting regional wall
motion abnormalities include basal and mid inferolateral
akinesis and probable basal and mid inferior and inferoseptal
akinesis.
4.Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
5.The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
6.The aortic valve is not well seen. No aortic regurgitation is
seen.
7.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
8.There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
9.There is no pericardial effusion.

[**2163-11-25**] Renal Ultrasound
Normal-size kidneys with no hydronephrosis

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1675**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]
on [**2163-11-18**] for further management of his coronary artery
disease. A cardiac catheterization was performed which showed
severe native three vessel coronary artery disease, an occluded
vein graft to the right coronary artery and obtuse marginal
artery, a patent internal mammary to the left anterior
descending artery, a mildly depressed ventricular systolic
function and moderate to severe diastolic dysfunction. Initially
the plan was to discharge Mr. [**Known lastname **] home to follow-up for
cardiac surgery for redo coronary artery bypass grafting however
he developed chest discomfort and EKG changes overnight. Heparin
and nitroglycerin were started with relief of his pain. The
cardiac surgical service was consulted and agreed that he should
have his surgery while in house. Mr. [**Known lastname **] was worked-up in the
usual preoperative manner including a carotid duplex ultrasound
which revealed less than 40% bilateral internal carotid artery
stenosis. Mr. [**Known lastname **] continue dto experience intermittant rest
angina which was relieved with medical treatment. His cardiac
enzymes remained stable. As Mr. [**Known lastname **] was a heavy smoker, he
often left the floor to smoke against medical advice. He finally
agreed to some smoking cessation despite his high level of
anxiety regarding his current state. An echocardiogram was
performed which showed 3+ mitral valve regurgitation, a dilated
left atrium, an ejection fraction os 44% and a mildy dialated
ascending aorta. On [**2163-11-23**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the
operating room where he underwent redo coronary artery bypass
grafting to one vessel. Postoperatively he was taken to the
cardiac surgical intensive care unit for monitoring. On
[**Known lastname **] day one, Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**] neurologically intact
and was ectubated. Imdur was started given his extensive
coronary artery disease. On [**Last Name (Titles) **] day two, Mr. [**Known lastname **]
was transferred to the cardiac surgical step down unit for
further recovery. Mr. [**Known lastname **] urine output decreased in the
presence of an elevated creatinine. The renal service was
consulted and lasix was contiinued. A renal ultrasound was
performed which was unremarkable. It was presumed that his acute
renal failure was hemodynamically mediated by a low flow state
