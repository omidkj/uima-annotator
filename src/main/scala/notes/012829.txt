Chief Complaint: abdominal pain

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 805**] is a 77 yo female with history of HTN, DMII, CKD
hypothyroidism, and RA who presented to the ED with abdominal
pain for 1 week.  Reports decreased appetite and has not been
eating, only drinking fluids.  The pain has worsened over time.
At worst yesterday was [**11-13**].  It starts in her lower mid chest
and radiates to her epigastric region.  Denies radiation to her
back.  Denied fever, dypsnea, CP, but did admit to dysuria for
the last week.  Also recently had a minor fall on [**2-3**].

In the ED, initial vs were: 98.7, 74, 184/82, 16, 100% RA. She
was noted to have a tender pulsatile aorta in the LUQ/left mid
abdomen.  Found to be guaiac negative. Lipase elevated at 1689.
KUB showed no free air.  CT abdomen without contrast was
performed given poor renal function and preliminarily read as no
AAA.  Labs were significant for bicarb of 11, Cr of 6, trop
0.11.  EKG without changes from baseline.  UA was consistent
with a UTI.  She was given ASA 600 mg rectally and 400 mg IV
ciprofloxacin.   Got 2.3 L NS and she only put out 70 cc fluid.

On arrival to the MICU, her pain is [**7-14**].  She denies nausea and
states she is starting to feel a little better then when she
came in.

Micro:
Urine culture ([**2130-2-10**]) - pending
.
BCx x 2 ([**2130-2-10**]) - pending
.
Images:
CXR ([**2130-2-10**]) - No acute pulmonary process. Scarring versus
chronic effusion at right costophrenic angle. Stable
cardiomegaly
.
Abd XR ([**2130-2-10**]) -  report pending (no free air)
.
CT abd/pelvis w/o contrast ([**2130-2-10**]) - IMPRESSION: No evidence
for abdominal aortic aneurysm. Prominent pancreas with minimal
surrounding stranding corresponds to clinical diagnosis of
pancreatitis. No apparent complicating features noted, within
limits.
.
TTE ([**2130-2-14**]): The left atrium is elongated. There is moderate
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade I
(mild) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a very small pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate symmetric LVH with normal global and
regional biventricular systolic function. Calcific aortic valve
disease with mild stenosis/mild regurgitation. Mild mitral
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension. Very small
pericardial effusion.
.
EKG: normal sinus rhythm, nl intervals, slight upsloping of ST
segments in aVL and V2 (unchanged from baseline)
.
Renal U/S ([**2130-2-15**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Likely layering debris in the urinary bladder, presumably
related to
provided history of urinary infection.
2. Benign-appearing bilateral renal cysts.
3. Small volume of ascites as described above
.
LUE LENI ([**2130-2-15**]):
IMPRESSION: Left deep venous thrombosis involving the internal
jugular and
brachial veins. Cephalic vein not identified.
.
Chest X-ray for PICC placement ([**2130-2-16**]):
Radiology read dictated: PICC in the right superior caval
junction. OK for use.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Pancreatitis:  Initially admitted to MICU for management
considering [**Last Name (un) **] and metabolic acidosis (described below).
Differential for etiology of pancreatitis includes gallstone,
alcoholic, medication-induced, and hypertriglyceridemia.  Most
likely gallstone-induced.  VBG in ED was 7.09/28/94, showing
uncompensated metabolic acidosis. Abdominal ultrasound showed
evidence of pancreatitis with inflamed pancreatic head.
Patient's abdominal pain resolved over the next few days. IVF
was initially given and she was kept NPO. After her abdominal
pain resolved her diet was advanc
