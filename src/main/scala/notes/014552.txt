Head CT at admission:
There is a large chronic infarction in the right middle cerebral
artery territory distribution. There are acute blood products in
the anterior portion of this infarction, mostly in the frontal
lobe. There is minimal associated mass effect. There is no CT
evidence of an acute major territorial infarction. The
ventricles are normal in size. The visualized osseous structures
appear unremarkable. There is mild mucosal thickening in the
maxillary sinuses bilaterally.
IMPRESSION: Acute hemorrhage within a chronic infarction in the
right middle cerebral artery distribution.
.
RUQ US:
The gallbladder is dilated, however, contains no stones. There
is no evidence of gallbladder wall edema. The gallbladder wall
is normal measuring 2 mm. The common bile duct measures 3 mm
proximally and 5 mm distally, which is normal. No filling
defects or stones are identified within the bile duct. The
visualized liver does not demonstrate evidence of biliary ductal
dilatation. There is a small amount of intra-abdominal ascites
identified and a right pleural effusion is noted.
.
CT abdomen/pelvis:
1. Distended gallbladder with small amount of pericholecystic
fluid. However, there is intraperitoneal free fluid. A right
upper quadrant ultrasound could be perform to further evaluate
this finding.
2. Small amount of intra-abdominal and intrapelvic free fluid.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions with minimal bibasilar
subsegmental atelectasis.
4. Small region of non-specific hypoperfusion in the upper pole
of the right kidney. Clinical correlation is recommended as
infection is not excluded. Second focus of cortical thinning
suggestive of prior infection or infarction.

Brief Hospital Course:
56 year old man with recent right mca infarction ([**8-2**]) who
presented with sob and flank pain. At that point, L-leg shaking
and gaze deviation was noted: new hemorrhagic conversion of old
R-MCA stroke.
.

1. Hemorrhagic conversion of MCA stroke

He was found to have hemorrhagic conversion of his recent MCA
territory
stroke. In addition, he underwent an LP, which demonstrated
(traumatic: prot 452, glc 90, wbc 4 rbc 667 (tube 4), [**Numeric Identifier 63193**] tube
1; prot likely secondary to traumatic tap). An EEG demonstrated
theta and delta slow waves in R hemisphere with sharp features,
consistent with seizure activity. He was started on Dilantin for
seizures,
then subsequently changed to depakote with monitoring
demonstrating therapeutic
levels. He had no further seizure activity. He will be
discharged to rehab, and
will need furhter physical/occupational/speech therapy.

.

2. Hypoxic respiratory failure

Initially intubated for respiratory distress and hypoxia,
treated with levo/flagyl
for suspected aspiration pneumonia. In MICU, he was later
trached and had a PEG tube. Sputum cultures grew out MRSA, and
he was started on a 10 day course of
Vancomycin by PICC line. Another contribution was his CHF with
EF of 30%. His volume status was closely monitored, and he was
started on lasix 40mg po daily.
Before discharge, he was weaned off of the ventilator and doing
well on
a trach collar with Passy-Muir valve for speaking. He will need
continued
frequent suctioning (q1hr), as well as meticulous trach and
respiratory care.

.

3. Atrial fibrillation

Issues with atrial fibrillation with RVR during his hospital
course.
This was managed with Amiodarone (200mg po daily at time of
discharge), and
metoprolol 25mg TID.

.

4. Anemia

Consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation; stable with no
transfusion
requirement.

.

5. FEN

Enteral feeding by PEG tube. Will continue tube feeds.
No issues with high residual volumes.
