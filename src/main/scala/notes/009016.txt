Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer for RV thrombus and bilateral PEs

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 66 yo female with h/o fibromyalgia, depression,
migraine who was transferred from [**Hospital6 33**] for
further management of RV thrombus and bilateral PEs. Patient
presented to [**Hospital6 **] with leg pain and SOB. LENI
revealed LLE DVT in the peroneal vein and CTA revelaed bilater
pulmonary emboli, largest in right lower lobe artery just below
the origin of the superior segment branch. Echocardiogram was
performed and revealed EF of 55-60 %, right ventricle with
mobile mass suggestive of thrombus or tumor, trace TR, trivial
pericardial effusion. Per patient she has had worsening SOB over
the couple of months and since the end of [**Month (only) **] until [**Month (only) 404**]
has had low grade fevers, chills and sweats. She also has had a
persistent cough throughout this time. She saw her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
could articulate what the thoughts were about the etiology. Over
the past month her SOB has worsened and 10 days ago she began
having left LE pain. The pain in her leg and SOB worsened to the
point of her presenting to the ED at [**Hospital3 **]. This was also
associated with some pleuritic chest pain located in the mid
chest which has since significantly improved. Of note, she has
been much less active over the recent months, sleeping most of
the day and not very mobile due to her SOB and fibromyalgia
pain. Denies any recent surgeries or trauma to the leg. She was
given a dose of lovenox on [**1-5**] and was started on a heparin
drip and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] patient reports SOB feels about the same,
her CP is much improved. Denies palpitations, lightheadedness.
She does have some shoulder and abdominal pain that is
consistent with her fibromyalgia.
.
On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She has
myalgias from her fibromyalgia. She also notes a 50 pound weight
gain over the past 3 years. She also has had a superficial
phlebitis. She also notes that she had a period of [**1-24**] weeks
back in [**Month (only) 321**]-[**Month (only) **] when she had difficulty swallowing
with food getting "stuck in her throat."
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for 3+ pillow orthopnea
which is stable. She reports snoring at night and possible
apneic episodes. Denies ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope.

RADIOLOGY

[**2186-1-7**] CTA CHEST
1. Multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli in the left lower lobe,
right middle lobe and right lower lobe.
2. Patchy left and right lower lobe and right middle lobe
atelectasis.

[**2186-1-7**] TRANS-THORACIC ECHO
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%) The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. There is no
mass/thrombus in the right ventricle. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

[**2186-1-8**] CHEST X-RAY
Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Elevation of the right
hemidiaphragm is longstanding. Right basal atelectasis have
improved. There is no overt CHF, pneumothorax or pleural
effusions.

[**2186-1-10**] NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT:
There is no hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline
structures, or evidence of major vascular territorial infarct.
The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is preserved. The
visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells remain
normally aerated. The surrounding osseous and soft tissue
structures are within normal limits.
IMPRESSION: Normal unenhanced head CT.


Brief Hospital Course:
66 yo female with obesity, fibromyalgia, depression, IBS who
presented wit left LE pain and SOB found to have bilateral PEs
and RV thrombus

# Bilateral PE's and RV thrombus: Patient with history of
miscarriages and superficial thrombophlebitis, suggestive of
underlying hypercoagulable disorder. Per transfer records,
patient had been briefly evaluated by hematology-oncology  but
no formal diagnosis has been reached. Upon arrival, patient was
anticoagulated and echocardiogram was repeated, which did not
reveal presence of previously reported RV thrombus. Due to
concerns of distal embolization, CTA of the chest was obtained,
revealing multiple pulmonary emboli. Patient remained stable and
did not have any signs of RV strain. She was transitioned to
injectable lovenox as she was bridged on coumadin.
Hypercoagulable workup would be very limited at this time as
patient is already anticoagulated, but this should be performed
as an outpatient in the near future. Will defer to PCP to
arrange for Hematology follow up.

Ms [**Known lastname 732**] should also complete routine cancer screening, as
hypercoagulable state may be a manifestation of underlying
malignancy. Defer mammogram, colonoscopy and GYN exams to PCP.

# Respiratory distress: Patient had mild oxygen requirement on
arrival as well as inspiratory wheezing on exam. Patient
received supplemental oxygen and nebulizer treatments, with good
improvement in symptoms.  She reports having dyspnea and
"bronchitis" for months, and may have underlying pulmonary
disease, most likely reactive airway disease. Patient discharged
on inhalers, will defer further management to PCP.

Patient was also noted to have episodes of apnea while sleeping
and would benefit from formal sleep study as an outpatient.

# Altered mental status / Depression: Psychi
