CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN ASSAY (Final [**2145-7-14**]):

FECES NEGATIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.

CHEST (PA & LAT)

FINDINGS: There has been interval removal of the endotracheal
tube, NG tube, right IJ and right subclavian lines. There is
volume loss in the left lower lobe and plate-like atelectasis in
both lower lungs.

IMPRESSION: Severe lung volume loss in the left lower lung,
probably left lower lobe collapse, no new infiltrate

[**2145-7-7**] 2:48 AM

PORTABLE ABDOMEN

Reason: Assess for ileus/free air.

ABDOMEN, SINGLE VIEW: There are no gas-filled dilated loops;
there is a nonspecific bowel gas pattern. There is no evidence
for free air. Gas is seen in the rectum. Surgical staples are
seen along the left abdomen. An OG tube sidehole projects below
the diaphragm into the expected location of the gastric level.
No gross osseous abnormality.

IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence for ileus or free air.

UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US RIGHT

Reason: RT ARM SWELLING,EVAL FOR DVT

FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of right IJ,
subclavian, axillary, brachials, basilic, and cephalic veins
were obtained. Heterogeneous echogenicity within the mid and
distal portions of the right internal jugular vein, without
demonstrable compression is compatible with a right IJ thrombus.
There is some color flow around the right IJ thrombus,
suggesting that the thrombus is non-occlusive. The remainder of
the venous structures demonstrate normal compression and color
flow. A single view of the left subclavian vein was obtained for
comparison and is unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Right internal jugular vein non-occlusive thrombus.
