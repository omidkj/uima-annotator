Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 12174**]
Chief Complaint:
transferred from OSH for GI bleeding, liver failure, ARF, and
coagulopathy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD x 2
Colonoscopy


History of Present Illness:
44 M with end-stage liver disease [**1-26**] alcohol abuse, who
initially presented to [**Hospital6 33**] ED on [**2109-4-21**] with
jaundice, twenty-pound weight gain over three weeks, and lower
extremity swelling which had been treated with clindamycin for
presumptive cellulitis. During his stay at [**Hospital3 **], we was
noted to have worsening of his hepatic failure with elevated
bilirubin (17 up from 6), coagulopathy (INR 2.7), and albumin of
2.4, as well as ARF (up from baseline of 0.6 to 2.7) and
leukocytosis 26.7 with 8% bands, which they attributed to a LLL
consolidation on CXR. He was started on prednisalone 40 mg Daily
to treat alcoholic hepatitis and GI was consulted. He had an
abdominal US which showed a cirrhotic liver and mild to moderate
ascites, as well as Doppler studies which showed patent hepatic
vessels. He went on to develop a GI bleed, with BRBPR and HCT
drop from 34.8 to 26. He was started on IV protonix and
transfused 5 units of FFP and 4 units of cryoprecipitate without
significant clinical or lab impact. This combination of issues
prompted a transfer from [**Hospital6 **] to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management.

On arrival, patient appears frankly jaundiced but denies having
any further blood or dark color to his stools today. His main
concern is his swollen L leg, which he says is very concerning
to him. He says it has been swelling up intermittenly for years,
but says that it has never been this bad.

BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLER VENOUS ULTRASOUND - [**2109-4-25**]:
Grayscale and Doppler examination of the bilateral common
femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins was performed.
Normal compressibility, augmentation, waveforms, and Doppler
flow are demonstrated. Several normal-appearing lymph nodes are
seen in the left groin. Left calf veins could not be evaluated
due poor acoustic window (bandage material).

CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS - [**2109-4-25**]:
There is a massive left pleural effusion and associated collapse
of the left lower lobe and partly visualized lingula. The heart
and great vessels are unremarkable. In the abdomen, there is
extensive ascites. This study is limited without IV contrast,
but there are no apparent hepatic lesions. The spleen is
enlarged. The kidneys and adrenals appear normal. The pancreas
is normal. There are splenic varices, Prominent veins are seen
in the retroperitoneum suggestive of venous stenosis or
occlusion. "[**Doctor First Name **] mesentery" and anasarca also suggest of venous
stasis. There is a calcified gallstone.  The bladder and distal
ureters are normal. The prostate appears normal, and there are
prostatic calcifications. Pelvic loops of bowel appear normal,
and there is free fluid but no free air seen in the pelvis.  No
suspicious lytic or blastic lesions. Healed right rib fractures
are seen.

CT CHEST - [**2109-4-26**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Very large left pleural effusion with associated compressive
atelectasis. No definite endobronchial obstructive lesions are
identified.
2. Small right pleural effusion.
3. Cirrhotic-appearing liver, with ascites and varices,
incompletely evaluated on this study.
4. Cholelithiasis.

CYTOLOGY - Pleural Fluid [**2109-4-26**]:
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

ECHO [**2109-4-29**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
high normal. There is no pericardial effusion. There are
prominient bilateral pleural effusions (Left>right).

CT HEAD [**2109-5-2**]:
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, mass lesion, shift
of normally midline structures or infarction. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
matter differentiation is preserved. The intracranial cisterns
are preserved.
The extracalvarial soft tissues are within normal limits. The
orbital regions appear normal. There is mild mucosal thickening
in the right maxillary sinus. There is partial opacification of
several mastoid air cells bilaterally. IMPRESSION:
Normal brain CT.

CHEST XRAY [**2109-5-3**]:
FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**5-1**], there is a small
decrease in the still-substantial left pleural effusion
following removal of the pigtail catheter. No evidence of
pneumothorax. Heart and lungs are essentially unchanged.

CHEST XRAY [**2109-5-1**]:
Large amount of left pleural effusion has gradually progressed
since [**2109-4-27**] when the chest tube was inserted and is
currently approximately of the size similar to [**2109-4-25**], but
still less than demonstrated on [**2109-4-27**] before insertion of
the pigtail. There is small right pleural effusion, grossly
unchanged. The lungs are clear. Old right lower rib healed
fractures are noted. There is no pneumothorax.
