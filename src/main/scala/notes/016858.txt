Pertinent Results:
[**8-11**] Cath: 1.  Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA was
a long vessel with mild plaquing, and proximal 30% and distal
20% lesions.  The LAD had a 30-40% ostial tubular lesion.  The
LAD and the diagonal were calcified. The LAD after the takeoff
of D1 had a 95% stenosis with TIMI 2 flow.  A previously large
D1 was totally occluded with distal filling via LCx collaterals
and 40% in-stent restenosis.  The LCx had minimal luminal
irregularities and supplied the atrial branch, OM1, 2 LPL's
(proximal 50% stenosis at LPL1), and collaterals to the RPDA.
The ramus has an ostial 30% and proximal 80% then 50% lesions
with diffuse plaquing. Multiple distal branches are noted.  The
RCA has a proximal 30% stenosis and a mid 90% stenosis with
haziness suggestive of thrombus with TIMI 1 flow distally.  The
RPDA has a mid 80% lesion at 2 major sidebranches follwed by a
90% stenosi revealed minimally elevated left sided filling
pressures with LVEDP of 13 mmHg. 3.  Left ventriculography
revealed no mitral regurgitation.  The LVEF was calculated to be
45-49% with posterobasal, inferior and anterolateral hypokinesis
and inferoapical akinesis.
[**8-13**] Echo: Pre Procedure: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No
mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion. Post Off Pump Bypass: Wall motion and LV
function unchanged. Aortic contours preserved. Mitral
regurgitation appears trace to mild. Remaining exam unchanged.
All findings discussed with surgeons at the time of the exam.
[**8-17**] CXR: 1. Stable small-to-moderate right apical pneumothorax.
2. Persistent bibasilar atelectasis. 3. Slight improved aeration
of the left lung base.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7086**] was admitted following being ruled in for NSTEMI. He
underwent a Cardiac catheterization on [**2106-8-11**] which showed
severe three vessel coronary artery disease. He was referred for
surgical revascularization. On [**8-13**] he was brought to the
operating room, where he underwent an off-pump coronary artery
bypass graft x 4. Please see operative report for details.
Following surgery he was transferred to the CSRU for invasive
monitoring in stable condition. Later on op he was weaned from
sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. He was
started on Imdur for his radial artery graft and his drips were
weaned. On post-op day one he was started on beta blockers and
diuretics and gently diuresed towards his pre-op weight. Later
on post-op day one he was transferred to SDU for further care.
On post-op day three his epicardial pacing wires and chest tubes
removed. Chest x-ray following removal of chest tubes revealed a
small apical pneumothorax. Chest x-ray the following day showed
the pneumothorax to have decreased in size. Post-operatively he
worked with physical therapy for strength and mobility. He
appeared to be doing well on post-op day four and was discharged
home with VNA services and the appropriate follow-up
appointments.
