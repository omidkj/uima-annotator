Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6075**]
Chief Complaint:
1) L PCA infarction
2) Atrial Fibrillation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1) Bronchoscopy [**8-4**]
2) PICC line placement [**8-4**]
3) Tracheostomy [**8-10**]
4) Open gastrostomy tube placement [**8-11**]

History of Present Illness:
63 yo female with a PMH of HTN.
Pt last seen normal the evening prior before going to bed.  Per
report, pt had a phone conversation with her best friend at 8am
that morning, in which she said she would come over for coffee.
At roughly 8:30, the friend came over to get the pt, and no one
would answer either the phone or the door.  Husband returned
home from work at 5pm and found the pt in her underwear still in
bed and not responsive.  He noted that the mail was still in the
mailbox and the television was off, but the toilet seat had been
lifted up, and he remembers putting it down in the morning
before he left.  Pt was found lying on her right side curled up,
in a normal sleeping position and was noted to be making
gurgling noises with drool coming from the side of her mouth.
EMS was called and they were unable to arouse the patient.
Taken to [**Hospital3 6592**], where she was intubated for airway
protection.  T noted to be 102.9, OSH team concerned for
meningitis.  CT scan obtained prior to lumbar puncture showed
large left sided infarction.  No LP performed, but pt started on
Vanc/Ceftriaxone without blood cx being sent.  Cardiac rhythm
noted to be atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
 Pt then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

Pt arrived in ED intubated and unable to follow commands.  She
exhibited extensor posturing in the RUE and had spontaneous
movement of the three remaining extremities.  A CT/CTA was
obtained, which showed a large infarction in the L PCA
territory, involving the L parieto-occipital cortex, as well as
the thalamus and midbrain.  The pt was given ASA only given the
concern for potential hemorrhagic transformation of such a large
infarct.

The pt was then admitted to the ICU.

CT/CTA [**7-29**]:
1. Left posterior cerebral and left posterior choroidal and
superior
cerebellar arterial territory infarct as seen on the recent CT
study of CT
Head [**2173-7-29**] 18:13 hrs. No hemorrhagic transformation
since the recent
study.

2. Occluded distal left V2 and proximal left V3 segments of the
left vertebral
artery. Appearances are probably thrombogenic but vasculitis
should be
considered.

3. Bilateral atheromatous carotid disease at the bifurcation
with measurements
as described.

4. Centrilobular emphysema and movement artefact degrading the
upper lung
zones.

MRI [**7-30**]:
IMPRESSION: Infarct extends to bilateral thalamic and left
parietooccipital,
anterior-posterior cerebellar lobes, and midbrain. Hemorrhagic
component to
left temporal and left midbrain infarct,not seen on most recent
head CT and
may be new. Recommend CT to better evaluate extent of
hemorrhage. Old left
inferior PICA cerebellar infarct.

TTE [**7-30**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect or
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast with maneuvers. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF 65%). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the aortic root.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the abdominal aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. There is severe mitral annular calcification. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] There is no pericardial effusion. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.


IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. No obvious intracardiac
shunt but cannot be excluded with certainty on the basis of this
technically suboptimal study

CT head [**7-31**]:
IMPRESSION: Infarct extending bilateral thalami, left
parietooccipital,
anterior and posterior cerebellar lobes and midbrain with
hyperdensity likely
representing hemorrhagic component within the left mid brain and
left temporal
lobe are relatively stable since [**2173-7-30**] and may represent
hemorrhagic
component to the infarct.

CT head [**8-2**]:
IMPRESSION: Stable bilateral thalami, left parieto-occipital,
anterior and
posterior cerebellar lobes and mid brain hypodensities with
stable hemorrhagic
components in the mid brain and left temporal lobe.

Bronchoscopy [**8-4**]:
- Small amount of thin, clear secretions suctioned
- No evidence of consolidation
- Moderate to severe trachebronchiomalacia in b/l mainstems
estimated based on complete collapse of bronchi during cough

CT head on [**2173-8-15**]
Evolving infarctions, without evidence of acute intracranial
hemorrhage


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] ICU on [**7-30**].  Initial anticoagulation
regimen consisted of ASA only due to concern for hemorrhagic
transformation of her infarction.  Blood pressure was initially
controlled with beta blockade with goal SBP 120-180.
Ceftriaxone was continued due to concern for aspiration PNA,
less concern for meningitis given supple neck.

MRI obtained on afternoon of [**7-30**] showed concern for new
hemorrhage within the infarct territory, most likely hemorrhagic
transformation of ischemic infarction.  For this reason the
decision to hold further anticoagulation was made.  A follow up
head CT the next morning showed stable hemorrhage.  A TTE
obtained on the 30th showed normal LVEF and mild LAE with no
visualized clot.

On [**8-1**] the patient was found to have developed a cold right
foot.  A vascular surgery consult was obtained and dopplerable
pulses were found at the R DP and PT
