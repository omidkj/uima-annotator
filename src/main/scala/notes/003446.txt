History of Present Illness:
85 y/o female with dementia, HTN, HLD, history of hemorrhagic
CVA, found down in bathroom by family member. To family, patient
was "not making sense" and had a question of weakness. She was
noted to be last normal 3 hrs prior to arrival. Of note, she was
seen at OSH this AM, and dx with UTI (placed on ciprofloxacin).
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 96, HR 84, BP 152/80, RR 16, 97%
NRB. Code stroke was called and CT head showed severe atrophy of
cortex and ex-vacuo hydrocephalus with white matter changes. CTA
showed that all major arteries of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] are
patent, CT perfusion did not show perfusion mismatch, however
MTT is increased on the left bordezone areas. After consultation
with radiology and neurology felt to chronic changes. Her
C-spine was cleared. CXR was felt to have retrocardiac opacity
and she was given a dose of levofloxacin. Labs notable for
lactate 3.7, WBC 14.4, anion gap 17. U/A here negative. Blood
and urine cultures pending.
.
Prior to transfer, vitals: afebrile, 127/42 56 16 99%RA. Of
note, she had at least 6 episodes of bradycardia to HR 40s for a
few seconds in the ED, during which she became non-responsive
for 20-30 seconds after which patient would return to baseline
mental status. Symptomatic bradycardia was reproducible with
carotid massage. Her neuro exam prior to transfer notable for no
focal deficit.
.
The patient was taken to the EP lab, had a TTE showing moderate
AS and then had a dual chamber ICD/pacer placed. On the floor,
the patient was pleasant but demented, A&Ox1. She denied pain
and did not have any subsequent episodes of syncope.
.

Micro: U/A - wnl. Blood cx pending
.
Images: CTA head/neck - CT head showed severe atrophy of cortex
and ex-vacuo hydrocephalus with white matter changes. CTA showed
that all major arteries of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] are patent, CT
perfusion did not show perfusion mismatch, however MTT is
increased on the left bordezone areas. After consultation with
radiologist we believe it is because of chronic changes.
.
CXR: Findings suggestive of early congestive heart failure. No
definite evidence of pneumonia.
.
TTE: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.1cm2). Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate aortic valve stenosis. Mild aortic
regurgitatio. Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
The patient has moderate aortic stenosis. Based on [**2153**] ACC/AHA
Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines, if the patient is
asymptomatic, a follow-up echocardiogram is suggested in [**11-19**]
years.
.
EEG: some diffuse slowing


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 85F with alzheimer's dementia, chronic cdiff and hx
hemorrhagic cva ([**2154**]) who p/w syncopal episode and symptomatic
bradycardia, with multiple episodes of witnessed symptomatic
bradycardia in the ED. She had a dual chamber pacemaker/icd
placed [**9-22**] with no complications.
.
#AMS: Pt had witnessed tonic clonic seizure during
hospitalization, likely explaining her several episodes of AMS
and her reason for admission. Pt with [**2154**] hemorragic stroke
likely putting her at risk for seizures. She was recently on
macrobid for presumed UTI that possibly lowered her seizure
threshold. The seizures might also explain her bradycardia. Pt
was started on keppra 500mg [**Hospital1 **] and increased to 750mg [**Hospital1 **].
Patient was initially cared for by the Cardiology floor service
but was transferred to CCU after an episode of unresponsiveness
that likely followed an unwitnessed seizure. Patient had no
further seizure episodes after starting keppra and will followup
with neurology to address both her seizures and her alzheimers
disease.
.
# Bradycardia: Patient had episodes of junctional rhythms with
bradycardia with concurrent loss of consciousness. It was
initially felt that the bradycardia was the etiology
