Pertinent Results:
[**2178-8-24**] Echo: Prebypass: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Restricted
P2 portion of posterior leaflet. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in
person of the results on [**2178-8-24**] at 930am. Post bypass:
Patient is A paced and receiving an infusion of phenylephrine
and epinephrine. LVEF= 50%. Moderate mitral regurgitation
persists. Aorta is intact post decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 6105**] was a same day admit after undergoing preoperative
work-up as an outpatient. On [**8-24**] he was brought directly to the
operating room where he underwent a coronary artery bypass
graft. Prior to surgery ultrasound guided access of the right
internal jugular vein had been achieved by the anesthesia staff
with placement of a cordis. Placement of a Swan-Ganz catheter
was met with difficulty and it realized that a portion of the
catheter was retained within the vein after the Swan-Ganz
catheter was removed. Vascular surgery was urgently consulted
and removed the foreign body from right internal jugular vein
along with primary repair of IJ. Please see both operative
reports for further details. Following surgery he was
transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable
condition. Within 24 hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated.  He was transferred to the
step down floor, where his chest tubes and epicardial wires were
removed.  He restarted his own insulin pump.  Physical therapy
saw him in consultation and felt he would be safe to send home
when medically ready. By post-operative day five he was ready
for discharge to home.  All follow-up appointments were advised.
