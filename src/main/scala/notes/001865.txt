RADIOLOGY:

[**2-19**] post-op CXR: The patient is status post transhiatal
esophagectomy. The tip of the endotracheal tube is identified 2
cm above the carina. The right jugular Swan-Ganz catheter
terminates in the right main PA. A nasogastric tube terminates
in the intrathoracic stomach.
There is mild congestive heart failure with cardiomegaly. Patchy
atelectasis is seen at the lung bases. There is no evidence of
pneumothorax.

[**2-21**] CXR: Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. There has
been removal of a nasogastric tube. Surgical drains remain in
place in the upper mediastinum.
There is an air collection present adjacent to the drain which
may relate to air within the proximal neoesophagus or
postoperative extraluminal air
collection. There is mild perihilar haziness suggestive of mild
perihilar
edema, and note is made of small bilateral pleural effusions,
slightly
improved in the interval.

[**2-26**] Barrium Swallow eval: Barium passes freely through the
esophagus. An
end-to-side anastomosis is noted within the upper mediastinum.
There is no
evidence of anastomotic leak. A drain is seen within the
superior
mediastinum.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of anastomotic leak.

PATHOLOGY:
I. Esophagogastrectomy (A-AH,CA-CK ):

1. Barrett's esophagus with extensive low grade and foci of high
grade glandular dysplasia (see note).
2. Hiatal hernia.
3. Gastric segment and regional lymph nodes, within normal
limits.
4. Esophageal squamous epithelium at proximal margin and gastric
corpus mucosa at distal margin.
5. There is no carcinoma.



II. Left gastric lymph nodes (BA-BK):

1. Hyperplasia of lymph nodes.
2. No tumor.
Note: The glandular dysplasia is low grade in the more proximal
part of the esophageal segment, and high grade in the lower
part.  The entire columnar-lined esophagus is sampled, and there
is no residual carcinoma.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 65 year old gentleman with high-grade Barrett's
esophagus with adenocarcinoma who presented for esophagectomy.
He underwent transhiatal esophagectomy without complication on
[**2188-2-19**] (please see the operative note of Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Doctor Last Name **] for
full details). He had an uncomplicated post-operative course. He
was extubated on post-operative day 1 and diuresed gently. He
received perioperative antibiotics. Tube feeds were started on
post-op day 2. His pain was well controlled with an epidural
catheter. The patient accidentally removed his nasogastric tube
on post-op day 2. He had flatus on post-op day 5 and tube feeds
were advanced to goal. He underwent a swallow eval on post-op
day 7 which he passed and a diet was started; he was tolerating
a regular diet by post-op day 8 and had good pain control on
oral pain medications. His JP drain and staples were removed on
post-op day 8. He was discharged to home on post-op day 9 with
planned visiting nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] with tube feeding. Allq
uestions were answered to his satisfaction upon discharge.
