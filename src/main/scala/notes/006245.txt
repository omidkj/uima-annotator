HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 78-year-old female
with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and
hypertension who presented to [**Hospital1 188**] on [**2194-10-21**].  The patient had severe upper back pain
and dyspnea on exertion.  She was in her normal state of
health until seven days prior to admission when she began
experiencing fevers, chills, poor sleep, malaise, cough and
shortness of breath.  She had been switched from Zestril to
generic lisinopril and there was some question of whether or
not she was taking her medications.  She called her primary
care physician who suspected [**Name Initial (PRE) **] viral illness.  About a day
prior to admission she noticed acute back pain, dyspnea on
exertion, cough and increasing pedal edema.  The patient
described her back pain as sudden in onset without radiation.
There was no syncope, chest pain, shortness of breath or
pleurisy.  She also denied palpitations, fevers, chills,
headache and visual changes, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.

The patient was initially admitted to the medical intensive
care unit where she was started on a Nipride drip and noted
to have blood in her urine.  The patient was treated
aggressively with Lasix for congestive heart failure and
diuresed a couple of liters.  The patient had a bump in her
creatinine to 1.4 and diuresis was discontinued.  The patient
was also treated with an esmolol drip and then lisinopril,
hydrochlorothiazide, Lasix and Lopressor.  Her blood pressure
prior to transfer to the floor was 147/76.  She had
hyponatremia that had slowly corrected with fluid restriction
and her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was stable with
albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.3, blood pressure
134/70, heart rate 72, respiratory rate 20, saturating 95-97%
on room air.  Generally she was in no acute distress, alert
and oriented x 3 but sleepy.  Her skin showed no rashes.  Her
nails were normal.  Her hair was thin.  Head, eyes, ears,
nose and throat examination showed the pupils were equal,
round, and reactive to light.  Mucous membranes were dry.
The patient had no neck stiffness, no lymphadenopathy and
jugular venous pressure to 6 cm.  Back showed no spinal or
paraspinal tenderness, no kyphosis or scoliosis.  Pulmonary
examination showed decreased breath sounds at the bases with
crackles at both bases one-third of the way up, no wheezes or
rubs.  Heart had a regular rate, normal S1, normal S2, S4 was
present, high-pitched [**3-17**] diastolic murmur at the lower left
sternal border.  The abdomen was soft, nontender,
nondistended with bowel sounds present.  There were no masses
or hepatosplenomegaly, no clubbing, no cyanosis, no edema.
Her extremities were cool with 2+ pedal pulses.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission her white count was 6.0,
hemoglobin 12.3, hematocrit 36.1, platelet count 252, sodium
133, potassium 3.7, chloride 93, bicarbonate 30, BUN 22,
creatinine 1.4, glucose 93.

The patient had a chest CT that showed diffusely calcified
and tortuous aorta but no evidence of aortic dissection or
aneurysmal dilatation.  Findings were suggestive of
congestive heart failure with a moderate-sized pleural
effusion on the right and a small left pleural effusion.
Reticular nodular opacities were seen with the bilateral mid
and lower lung zones likely representing engorged lymphatics.
There were degenerative changes of the lumbosacral spine.

EKG was sinus rhythm with rate of 75, PR of 175 with multiple
abnormalities including T waves that were diffusely inverted
raising a question of evolving ischemia.

Echocardiogram revealed left atrial elongation, moderate to
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with an ejection
fraction of approximately 30%.  Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion were normal.  The aortic valves
were mildly thickened but not stenotic.  There was 2+ aortic
regurgitation seen.  The mitral valve leaflets were markedly
thickened.  There was no mitral prolapse.  There was mild to
moderate mitral regurgitation seen.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1. Congestive heart failure flare:  The
patient continued to be stable on room air.  Her Lasix
diuresis was discontinued due to increase in creatinine.
However, her hydrochlorothiazide was continued and Lasix was
held.

2. Hypertension:  The patient was held to a goal pressure of
140/90 or less.  Metoprolol was increased to 25 mg b.i.d. and
a calcium channel blocker was considered but not needed to
keep the pressure under 140/70.

3. Coronary artery disease:  The patient was thought to be at
risk for future coronary artery disease and was scheduled for
an outpatient stress test after discharge.  She was continued
on aspirin.  Hyponatremia was thought to be secondary to
congestive heart failure.  This resolved with fluid
restriction.

4. Renal insufficiency:  The patient's creatinine bumped up
to 1.4 however this resolved with cessation of Lasix
diuresis.

The patient's lung examinations improved significantly
throughout the hospitalization and the patient was able to be
discharged after saturating well on room air with
normotensive blood pressures throughout the remainder of her
hospitalization.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged to home in good
condition.

1. Congestive heart failure.
