Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2009**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Abdominal, pelvic CT scan

History of Present Illness:
This is a 82 year old Russian speaking female with a history of
hypertension, CAD, COPD on chronic O2, s/p small bowel resection
for incarcerated ventral hernia repair, chronic constipation who
presents with abdominal pain.  She had been in her usual state
of health until 2 weeks prior when she began to note diffuse
abdominal pain.  She notes that this has been in the setting of
severe constipation, which has been a chronic problem for her.
She had been started on lactulose which usually resolves her
constipation, but for the last few days, she has noted no
effect.  Denies nausea, vomitting or diarrhea.   Last BM was 3
days ago.

EDVS 98.6  136/63  HR 75  RR 18  95% on 3L.  She had a CT
abdomen that revealed no acute abdominal process and surgery was
consulted.  Surgery felt that there was no acute surgical issue.
 She was also noted to have a RBBB was to be admitted for
abdominal pain and ROMI.  Apparently curbsided cardiology, who
felt that she should be admitted to medicine, not cardiology
service for ROMI.  She was initially signed out to be admitted
to medicine floor, when she transiently dropped her SBP to 70s,
per report (though on EDVS, lowest SBP documented is 90s).  She
was given 3 L NS with SBP to 110s.

Review of systems is positive for occasional left sided chest
pain that occurs both at rest and on exertion for which she
takes SL NTG.  No change in the progression or frequency of
chest pain.

ROS: The patient denies any fevers, chills, weight change,
nausea, vomiting,  shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND, lower
extremity oedema, cough, urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria,
lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness, focal weakness, vision
changes, headache, rash or skin changes.

ECG: Sinus rhythm at 68 bpm, LAD, RBBB, TW flattening in
inferior leads

Imaging:
CXR Port ([**12-31**]): Elevated left hemidiaphragm, ? right lower
lower infiltrate

CT Abdomen/Pelvis w/ Contrast ([**12-31**]): Large ventral hernia with
large amount of mesenteric fat and large/small bowel. No
evidence of pneumotosis in the bowel however there is small
amount of free fluid within the hernia sac.



Brief Hospital Course:
82 year old Russian speaking female with a history of
hypertension, CAD, COPD on chronic O2, s/p small bowel resection
for incarcerated ventral hernia repair, chronic constipation who
presents with abdominal pain, admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] due to transient
episode of hypotension, resolved with IVF.

# Hypotension with history of hypertension: Transient in ED,
resolved after arrival in ICU after hydration in the emergency
room.  There was no evidence of sepsis or infection
contributing.  Most likely etiology was hypovolemia as she
appeared mildly dry on admission.  Her antihypertensives were
held.  Culture data was negative.  She was initially treated
with levofloxacin for CAP which was seen on the upper portion of
her abdominal CT, but in the absence of symptoms, fever or
leukocytosis, this was discontinued.   On discharge, her
antihypertensives were restarted except the aldactone.
.
# Abdominal pain with constipation: Appears to be related to
constipation.  In addition, on the CT scan there was evidence of
fluid in the hernia sac of the most inferior hernia, with
evidence also of venous congestion, therefore raising the
possibility that there was transient obstruction leading to the
symptoms.  Surgery evaluated her in the ED and felt her pain was
not surgical.  LFTs wnl.   She was given lactulose and a fleets
enema and did have a bowel movement, but remained somewhat
constipated.  TSH was normal.  She improved, and did not require
pain medication other than tylenol.  Her PCP will see her in 1
week, and will refer her to GI or to surgery as needed if she
continues to have pain.

# COPD: On home O2.  Stable.  She was continued on her home
regimen of advair and tiotropium.

# New RBBB: New RBBB since last ECG from [**2123**].  Does endorse
anginal symptoms and needing SL NTG.  Currently without evidence
of unstable angina.  Cardiology evaluated her in the ED and
recommended a stress test when stable.  Had two sets of cardiac
enzymes which were negative.  She was continued on plavix (no
ASA per patient as had GIB in the past).  Will need a stress
test in the near future given her anginal symptoms.   She had an
ECHO with no wall motion abnormalities and a preserved ejection
fraction, with moderate pulmonary artery hypertension.
