Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from outside hosptial after ventricular fibrillation
arrest in setting of bradycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization, Pacemaker placement


History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 83 year old female with coronary artery disease
status post bare metal stent to LCx on [**2146-3-8**], severe MR, COPD,
CHF EF 35-40%, [**Hospital **] transferred from [**Hospital3 **] with recurrent
ventricular fibrillation arrest.
   Pt admitted [**Hospital1 18**] [**3-8**] from [**Hospital3 **] (where stress thalium
showed ant/lat ischemia, TTE showed [**1-25**]+MR) for increasing
shortness of breath, had CCath [**3-8**] revealed patent LMCA, mod
diagonal LAD stenosis, 90% proximal lesion in LCx intervened on
with BMS.  Pt noted to have severe MR [**1-25**]+, but bc of her PVD,
her age, calcified aorta, MVR felt to be too risky.  Pt
discharged to rehab.
   Pt admitted mid-[**Month (only) 116**], per report and DC summary, for heart
failure, initiated on Bumex gtt, discharged to rehab (these
records not available to me).
   Pt was readmitted to [**Hospital3 **] for "weakness and confusion"
on [**5-3**].  She was treated with ctx for unknown reason and
diuresed.  Due to Afib with rapid heart rate, iv dig loaded
[**5-5**], [**5-6**], and [**5-8**] (total 1.125mg).  On [**5-8**] pm, 1 episode of
vtach with spontaneous conversion, then 1 episode of v-fib
requiring DC cardioversion, prompting iv amio load and gtt and
then lidocaine (unknown time of start).  In AM [**5-9**], 8 episodes
of vfib requiring defibrillation(7:20am - 8:20am), intubated,
reverted to sinus rhythm.  HR dropped to mid-30s with BP in 80s,
given atropine and dopamine gtt, both amio and and lidocaine
discontinued.  Pt given two doses of digibind for dig toxicity
concern.  Pt trasnferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for EP consult and possible
cardiac cath in AM for LCx disease causing ischemia-related
arrythmia.
   ROS unable to be obtained at this time due to patient
sedation and mechanical ventilation.

Cardiac Cath [**2146-5-10**]
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography of this left dominant system
demonstrated no
angiographically apparent flow-limiting coronary artery disease.
 The
LMCA had mild luminal irregularities.  The LAD had a small
diagonal
branch that had a 70% stenosis.  The LCx had mild in-stent
restenosis.
Radi pressure wire was performed across this stenosis and showed
an FFR
of 0.97 after maximal hyperemia with IV adenosine.  The RCA was
small
and non-dominant.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mild systemic arterial
systolic
hypertension at 155/64 mmHg.
3. Successful femoral artery closure with Angioseal VIP.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Single vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Mild systemic arterial systolic hypertension.

Echocardiogram [**2146-5-10**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrial volume is
markedly increased (>32ml/m2). Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There
is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25 %).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent
with Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is moderate thickening of the mitral
valve chordae. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2137-6-24**], the
left ventricle is more dilated with worsened systolic function.
The findings of mildly depressed right ventricular function,
moderate to severe mitral regurigtation are similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is an 83 year old female with history of paroxysmal
atrial fibrilation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, severe mitral
regurgitation, and coronary artery disease, who was transferred
from [**Hospital6 2910**] after polymorphic ventricular
tachycarida and fibrillation arrest in setting of bradycardia
and prolonged QTc, status post multiple defibrillations.

CARDIOVASCULAR:
# Coronary artery disease: Patient had underwent catherization
on [**2146-3-8**] which showed patent LMCA, moderate diagonal LAD
stenosis, and a 90% proximal lesion in LCx, to which a bare
metal stent was placed.  At outside hosptial, her CKs were not
elevated.  On admission, repeat cardiac enzymes were negative.
Given concern that ischemia could be contributing to her
arrhythmia and worsening of her mit
