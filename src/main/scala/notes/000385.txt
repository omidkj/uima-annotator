Chief Complaint:
pre-syncope, chest pain

s/p dual chamber pacemaker placement

History of Present Illness:
76 yo female with ESRD, DM2, HTN, hyperlipidemia, diastolic
dysfunction, sarcoidosis presented to ED after waking up this am
with sharp, pleuritic chest pain and dizziness. CP improved with
sl ntg x2 but dizziness persisted. In ED, found to be
hypotensive to sbp 70s initially. However, 1 hour later pt
brady'ed to 30s with associated hypotension to 70's responsive
to 0.5mg atropine followed by dopamine drip to 10 mcg. EP
consulted with plan for possible pacer placement.
.
Pt was chest pain free in sinus brady with sbp to 200's on
dopamine. Dopamine drip weaned down, pt coded and given atropine
and dopamine. Seen by EP who felt it was sinus arrest.
.
ROS: She complained of abdominal pain with associated nausea but
this is baseline for her. Otherwise no CP, SOB, f,c,v.

[**2151-10-11**]: EKG
Probable junctional escape rhythm, rate 34. Since the previous
tracing
of [**2151-9-11**] no P waves are seen. The rhythm appears to be a
junctional escape
rhythm. The Q-T interval is significantly prolonged.
Non-specific ST-T wave
abnormalities are noted.
.
[**2151-10-11**]: CXR
Comparison made to prior study of [**2151-9-11**]. The heart is
enlarged. There are prominent vascular markings. Linear
atelectasis is present in the left retrocardiac region.
.
IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with mild congestive heart
failure.
.
[**2151-10-11**]: TTE
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal cavity
size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular
wall motion
is normal.
3. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace
aortic
regurgitation is seen.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
5. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
6. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
7. Compared with the findings of the prior study of [**2149-11-21**],
there has been
no significant change.
.
[**2151-10-12**]: CXR
PA & LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: There has been interval
placement of a dual- chamber pacemaker seen overlying the right
upper chest with leads in satisfactory position. The heart is
enlarged. There is slight upper zone vascular redistribution. No
focal infiltrates identified. There is mild blunting of the
posterior costophrenic angles consistent with small pleural
effusions.
.
IMPRESSION: Interval placement of dual-lead pacemaker with leads
in satisfactory position. Slight upper zone redistribution and
small bilateral pleural effusions consistent with mild heart
failure.
.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Rhythm: Pt admitted with symptomatic junctional bradycardia.
Pt evaluated by EP who felt this was an indication for pacer
placement. Pt had an urgent dual chamber pacemaker placed on
HD1. Procedure was complicated by a small groin hematoma, which
remained stable. Pacer site looked fine without signs of
infection. Pt was given vanco for a couple of days after the
procedure.
.
2. CAD: Pt has history of multiple admissions for rule out MI
without any history of MI. No prior cath. Had a MIBI in [**1-6**]
which was unremarkable. Pt was continued on home aspirin. Given
her multiple cardiac risk factors, she was started on bb, [**Last Name (un) **]
(does not tolerate ACE), and statin. Would consider repeat ETT
vs. cath. as an outpatient. Pt remained chest pain free and
hemodynamically stable throughout hospitalization.
.
3. Pump: Clinically, pt appeared euvolemic. Pt had mild CHF on
CXR. Pt was continued on usual hemodialysis schedule which
helped to remove volume.
.
4. [**Name (NI) 5964**] Pt was seen by renal and continued on her usual
hemodialysis schedule. Pt was continued on calcium carbonate.
She was given epo during dialysis. Electrolytes remained within
normal limits.
.
5. Mental status/Home safety: Pt was A&O x 3 during the day. Pt
would sundown in the evening, requiring a sitter. It was noted
by daughter (who flew in from out of state) that here mother
seemed more confused than baseline. We did not notice any acute
change in her mental status during this hospitalization. Pt was
evaluated by PT and OT who felt that pt was safe to return home
with home PT. Pt lives with her husband and her daughter.

6. Gastritis: Pt was continue protonix.
.
7. DM2: Diet controlled in house. Pt was put on SSI while
in-house.
.
8. Coagulopathy: Initially elevated PTT and INR. Most likely lab
error, as repeat labs were normal.
.
9.FEN: Pt was put on diabetic diet. Electrolytes were repleted
as necessary to K 4.0 and Mg 2.0
