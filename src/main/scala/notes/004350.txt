Chief Complaint:
Unresponsive/weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
GJ tube insertion


History of Present Illness:
This is an 81 year old female with past medical history notable
for right sided MCA stroke with residual left hemiparesis, COPD,
Atrial flutter, and partial gastrectomy for gastric cancer who
presented to the ED today with altered mental status as well as
weakness this morning.  The patient's daughter reports she had
been in her normal state of health two days ago but yesterday
seemed more confused and was coughing with an increased O2
requirement.  At that time the patient's daughter spoke to the
patient's PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 8499**], who recommended presentation to
the ED for evaluation, the patient refused this however and thus
stayed at home.  This morning the patient was found in bed
unresponsive and not speaking to her daughter.  extremely
altered and not responding in her normal way to her daughter.
In fact she was barely responding at all and was unable to
stand.

The patient was brought to the the ED where she was obtunded
with nonmoving left arm and hypertonic left leg.  Initial vitals
were T 97.9, BP 138/83, P 69, RR 24, 99% on NRB (dropping to 99%
on 6L by NC).  Neurology consulted and was concerned this could
be a new ischemic stroke but the patient also had findings
consistent for pneumonia and some concerning ECG changes with
elevated troponins.  Given multiple issues this was considered
possible CVA versus return of previous deficits in the context
of other acute illness.  Neuro recommended no acute management,
case was briefly discussed with cards, who recommended aspirin,
and the patient received levofloxacin and cefepime as well as
nebs.  She was admitted to floor.
.
ROS: Unobtainable as patient is unresponsive.

Imaging:

EEG [**8-3**]: Abnormal portable EEG due primarily to the
disorganization
and slowing of the background. This indicates a widespread
encephalopathy. Metabolic disturbances, infection, and
medications are among the most common causes. There were no
prominent focal
abnormalities, but encephalopathies may obscure focal findings.
There were frequent sharp waves, usually symmetric, indicating
areas of
cortical hypersynchrony. This does not necessarily indicate the

presence of seizures at other times.
.
ECHO [**8-3**] - Overall left ventricular systolic function is low
normal (LVEF 50%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The
right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with severe global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis. Moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen
(which may be underestimated). The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
.
CXR [**8-3**]: There is a small right pleural effusion with adjacent
atelectasis is very similar. Allowing for rotation, the
appearance of the lung parenchyma is unchanged, with degree of
emphysema. The cardiac silhouette is borderline in size. There
is no pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.
.
MRI Head/Brain/Neck [**8-3**]:
1. Multiple small acute infarcts, diffusely scattered in the
cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres, on both sides, in the ACA,
MCA and the PCA territories, likely related to an embolic
source. To correlate clinically.
.
2. Patent major intracranial arteries without focal
flow-limiting stenosis, occlusion or aneurysm more than 3 mm
within the resolution of MR angiogram with bilateral fetal PCA
variant and hypoplastic A1 segment of the right anterior
cerebral artery.
.
3. Suboptimal quality of the contrast-enhanced MR angiogram of
the neck, which makes assessment inaccurate.
.
ekg: sinus tachycardia at rate of 117, normal axis, normal
intervals, pseudonormalization of t waves in V2 and V3.


Brief Hospital Course:
Summary: 81 year old female with multiple medical problems
including diastolic heart failure, atrial flutter, severe AS,
COPD, and a previous right sided MCA stroke presenting with
altered mental status and left sided deficits.

#Obtundation/Confusion: There was concern that the patient had
AMS from seizures due to her recent embolic strokes. Neurology
evaluated the patient and did an EEG which showed encephalopathy
likely due to metabolic causes. Her underlying urinary tract
infection and hypernatremia were treated and the patient slowly
became more responsive, alert and oriented. On discharge, the
patient was awake for the majority of the day and answered
questions appropriately.

#Multiple embolic strokes: The patient has a history of a left
sided middle cerebral artery stroke and presents with increased
weakness bilaterally and altered mental status. Her new strokes
likely come from a cardiac source since they are bilateral. The
patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial flutter, so her
embolisms are a likely resultant from this pathology. Her
strength is globally decreased (L>R) and she had sensory
deficits on L>R. She has clonus for the Achilles tendon on the
left, but not the right. The patient was started on aspirin and
lovenox to help prvent further strokes.

#Diastolic heart function: The patient has a history of
diastolic dysfunction and
