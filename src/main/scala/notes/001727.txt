Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Aleve

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4975**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right internal jugular central venous line placement
cardiac catheterization x 2

History of Present Illness:
54 yo M with HTN, hyperlipidema, and cervical spondylosis who
initially presented with CP and SOB x 24 hours and is now called
out of the MICU for further management on the cardiology
service.
.
The patient reports difficulty catching his breath starting on
the afternoon prior to admission. Denies orthopnea, PND, or
lower extremity edema. Also describes an episosde of left sided
[**7-19**] chest pressure starting on the afternoon prior to admission
at rest which watching TV. Denies nausea/vomiting/diaphoresis.
Denies radiation, but states his left arm felt numb. Denies loss
of consciousness. Reports voluminous water diarrhea x 3 days 6
BMs per day, non-bloody. No recent antibiotics. Chest pain was
constant until the day of admission when the patient called for
EMS and was given sublingual nitroglycerin, which he reports
completely palliated his chest pain. He was taken to OSH by EMS,
where CXR showed volume overload and BNP elevated to 1700. CK
was noted to be 404, mB 9.9 MBI 2.5, Trop-T: 0.029. He was given
ASA 324 mg x1, SL NTG x1, and lasix 20 mg IV x1. He was started
on nitro gtt and bipap for presumed CHF. Na also noted to be
114. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further cardiac evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial vital signs were T 99.4 HR 90 BP 135/61 RR 29
Sat 97% on bipap. Patient was chest pain free. However, cardiac
enzymes were noted to be positive (CK 583 MB 19, Trop-T 0.11).
The patient received Benadryl 50 mg IV x1, and combivent nebs.
Urine output noted to be 4500 cc. The patient was weaned off
bipap to 4 L NC. A right interval jugular central venous line
was also placed prior to ICU transfer. Also started on heparin
gtt for concern for ACS (guiac neg in ED).
.
The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. There, he
denied any chest pain and stated that his shortness of breath
had improved. The patient was treated overnight with 1L NS,
metoprolol, captopril, and nitroglycerin drip. He was
transferred to the cardiology service for further management.
.
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed
heavy calcification of all coronaries, LAD 60% long proximal
stenosis, LCX occluded after OM2, RCA 80% mid calcified lesion.
An attempt was made to apply PTCA to the mid RCA, but this was
unsuccessful due to inability for full expansion of angioplasty
balloons in a heavily calcified lesion.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myalgias, joint
pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies
recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or
calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

.
CXR PA and lateral [**2166-1-1**]: A right-sided IJ central venous
catheter terminates at the mid SVC. Cardiac and mediastinal
contours are unchanged since [**2165-12-30**]. The lungs are
hyperexpanded and clear, and there is no pneumothorax or pleural
effusion.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis is unchanged. Cervical
fusion hardware is unchanged in position.
IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process. Hyperexpanded lungs
denote a chronic obstructive disease such as emphysema.
.
Cardiac catheterization [**2166-1-1**]: report pending
.
Cardiac catheterization [**2165-12-31**]:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated three vessel disease. The LMCA had minimal disease.
The LAD had a 60% long proximal stenosis. The LCX was occluded
after OM2. The RCA had a 80% mid calcified lesion.
2. Resting hemodynamics limited to central aortic pressure
revealed mild systemic arterial systolic hypertension with SBP
154 mmHg.
3. Unsuccessful PTCA of the mid RCA due to inability for full
expansion of angioplasty balloons in a heavily calcified lesion.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Unsuccessful PCI of the RCA.
.
Echocardiogram, transthoracic [**2165-12-31**]: The left atrium is
mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quali
