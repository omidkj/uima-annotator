Imaging:
.
[**2109-1-23**] CXR: Wet read: Pleural plaques, bilateral haziness and
cephalization c/w pulmonary edema vs. overlying pleural disease.

.
[**2109-1-23**] CT abd/pelvis:
1. Increasing ascites within the abdomen, layering
non-dependently with some areas of partial loculation and mild
rim enhancement--these findings raise the possibility of
peritonitis.
2. Stigmata of portal hypertension including splenomegaly,
paraesophageal varices, and a large recanalized umbilical vein.

.
[**2109-1-24**] Abd U/S:
IMPRESSION:
1. Poor visualization of the left hepatic lobe, left hepatic
vein, and left portal vein.
2. Patent main portal, right portal, and right and middle
hepatic veins.
3. Findings consistent with cirrhosis and portal hypertension.
4. Moderate to large volume ascites.
.
[**2109-1-25**] CT Abd/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. Markedly decreased amount of ascites. No evidence of hematoma
or intraperitoneal hemorrhage.
2. Stigmata of portal hypertension including splenomegaly,
periesophageal varices, gastric varices, and large recanalized
umbilical vein are unchanged.
.
[**2109-1-28**] EGD:
Impression: Varices at the lower third of the esophagus
Erythema in the gastroesophageal junction compatible with
esophagitis
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum


Brief Hospital Course:
57 year old man with history of Alcoholic cirrhosis and portal
hypertension with grade 2 varices status post banding in [**12-12**],
CLL, diastolic CHF presents with increase in loose bowel
movements and abdominal pain.  Initially admitted to MICU for
transient hypotension, stable throughout admission.
.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
.
# Abdominal pain/spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: Due to
spontaneous bacterial peritonitis given loculated ascites and
peritoneal enhancement on CT, as well as diagnostic paracentesis
demonstrating greater than 250 PMNs.  Peritoneal culture with no
growth.  Patient was treated with levofloxacin with resolution
of abdominal pain.  Discharged with instructions to complete 7
day course of levofloxacin, then to start on ciprofloxacin for
SBP prophylaxis.
.
# Hypotension: Normal SBPs run in the 90s per patient, but BP on
presentation was below this, off of normal anti-hypertensives.
Therefore felt to be relative hypotension.  [**Name2 (NI) **] was initially
admitted to the MICU due to this, but BP stabilized with IVF.
No more episodes of hypotension throughout hospital course.
.
# Alcohollic cirrhosis:   Patient with known alcoholic
cirrhosis, with esophageal varices.  On furosemide, aldactone,
nadolol as outpatient.  These were initially held due to
hypotension above, but then were added back (although furosemide
and nadolol added at lower dose that on admission).  Otherwise,
treatement of SBP as above, and treatment of anemia as below.
The patient will follow up with hepatology as an outpatient.
.
# Anemia: Patient presented with H
