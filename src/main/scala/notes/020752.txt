Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5266**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal subcutaneous hematoma

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 62 y/o F with h/o IDDM, h/o multiple PE's, on
chronic anticoag, recently bridged on lovenox (150 [**Hospital1 **]) for
colonoscopy.  Lovenox was initiated on [**10-22**] for colonoscopy
performed on [**10-26**].  She presents to the ED with large >15x40cm
SQ abdominal hematoma at site of Lovenox injections. Patient
also noted to have drop Hct by 7 point (37.6 -> 30.8). Patient
had colonoscopy two days prior to admission for evaluation of
rectal bleeding episodes which had occurred 4-5x over the past
few weeks.  Following the colonoscopy, she restarted coumadin
([**10-26**]) with ongoing Lovenox for bridge to goal INR. Patient
noted over several days expanding bruise, then hard swelling on
LLQ at injection sites. She was told by VNA to stop using that
site, but reports continued expansion. Pt held lovenox on
evening of [**10-27**] given continued expansion.
.
Per patient, she was reported to have only hemorrhoids.  She
denies any subsequent episodes of BRBPR, hematochezia.  She
denies shortness of breath or chest pain.
.
Patient had CT abdomen in ED which showed hematoma but no RP
bleed. Patient being admitted for serial Hct checks.

Past Medical History:
1. Post-op pulmonary emboli ([**2160**]) status post IVC filter
secondary to retroperitoneal bleed on coumadin; Sadddle embolus
([**1-/2168**]), on coumadin for life
2. Thoracic osteomyelitis status post 6 week treatment with
vancomycin. Also concern for underlying tumor that is being
worked up.
3. Insulin dependent diabtes complicated by neuropathy and
retinopathy.
4. Congestive heart failure diagnosed per patient.
Echocardiagram [**1-29**] shows LVEF 70%
5. Chronic lower extremity edema
6. Obesity
7. Right foot ulcers
8. Fibromyalgia
9. Osteoarthritis, left knee status post "injection" and prior
knee surgery
[**72**]. multiple surgeries: appendectomy, cholecystectomy (ex lap),

partial hysterectomy
11. Obstructive sleep apnea on BIPAP at night
13. L4-5 herniated disc, status post steroid injections
14. Depression

Social History:
She quit smoking 23 years ago - she started at age 13 with 1
pack per day and then increased to 2-3 packs per day until she
quit.  She denies alcohol.  She lives at home with a [**Doctor Last Name **] son

CT ABD ([**2168-10-28**]):
Large subcutaneous hematoma involving mid to left lower anterior
abdomen. No intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal component.

CT ABD ([**2168-10-30**]):
1. Large subcutaneous hematoma, similar in size to perhaps
slightly decreased, with similar fluid-fluid levels.
2. Increased nonspecific stranding along the left flank which
may relate to edema and/or redistribution of hemorrhagic
products.

CXR ([**2168-11-5**]):
The lung volumes are relatively low, likely accentuating the
cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures. This limits
assessment of the cardiovascular status of the patient. No
confluent areas of consolidation are evident in either lung.
However, considering the concern for pneumonia, dedicated PA and
lateral radiographs may be helpful to more fully evaluate the
lungs if clinical suspicion for infection persists.

CT ABD ([**2168-11-7**]):
1. Limited study secondary to beam hardening artifact. Large
left femoral sheath hematoma extending from the liver tip on the
contralateral side, into the pelvis. Fluid, fluid levels seen
with within this large hematoma. Estimated that 50% of hematoma
is free flowing.
2. Largely resolved subcutaneous hematoma when compared to the
previous study.

CT ABD ([**2168-11-8**]):
1. Stable large left hematoma and smaller subcutaneous
hematomas.
2. IVC filter without evidence of IVC thrombus.

LOWER EXT US ([**2168-11-10**]):
No DVT in either lower extremity.

CT ABD ([**2168-11-15**]):
1. Stable appearance of large left lateral abdominal wall
hematoma and smaller subcutaneous he
