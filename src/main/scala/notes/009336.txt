Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered Mental Status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation and extubation, central line placement and removal
from right internal jugular vein, PICC placement [**2165-11-6**]


History of Present Illness:
64F extensive PMH, recently discharged 3 days prior from our
medical floor after a PNA readmitted [**10-29**] with altered mental
status, hypotension and possible PNA on chest x-ray.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: Temp 101.8, 95 98/53 25 96% 4L.
Patient was given 2L NS, Vanc 1g, Levaquin 500mg, Tamiflu 75mg
x1.  Foley was placed. Transfer VS: 90 121/59 22 96% 4L. Upon
admission to the ICU, the patient was noted to be minimally
responsive, diaphoretic and breathing rapidly.
.
Of note, the patient was discharged 3 days prior to admission
after a 7 day course of Vanc/Levo for pneumonia and a
concommitant GI bleed.  She was reportedly had clear mental
status and was otherwise stable at that time.
.
The patient spent 7d in the MICU.  Intubated on ICU day1 for
respiratory failure, subsequently extubated to CPAP the
following day, now satting well on NC with q6h albuterol nebs.
She was briefly hypotensive with pressors on arrival but quickly
weaned, now borderline hypertensive prior to transfer and
labetalol and trandolapril per OP regimen re-started.  Echo
demonstrated EF 45-50% with small loculated posterior
pericardial effusion w/o evidence of tamponade.  The pt also had
ARF with Cr 3.0, now resolving with IVF. In regards to abx- the
patient was initially started on linezolid, aztreonam and cipro,
she developed a rash thought to be [**1-21**] drug reaction- aztreonam
was withdrawn and the rash resolved.
.
Upon arrival to the floor, the patient had persistent mild SOB
and wheezing, improving with albuterol nebs.  Also has ctd cough
productive of yellowish sputum.  Rash developed on abx involving
back and buttocks is improving, minimally pruritic, relieved by
sarna lotion.  +Diarrhea, non-bloody, brownish.

Pertinent Results:
[**2165-10-29**]   Cardiology ECHO
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality,
a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed
(LVEF= 45-50%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. The aortic valve is not well seen. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a moderate-sized loculated posterior
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

IMPRESSION: Mild global left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Moderate loculated pericardial effusion without evidence of
tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-10-18**],
LV systolic function is not as vigorous. Pericardial effusion is
slightly larger. The other findings are similar

IMPRESSION:
1. Stable severe cardiomegaly with prominent hilar contours.
2. Persistent left lower lobe opacification may represent
continued alectasis
and/or pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 106044**] is a 64 year old F recently admitted with PNA and
GI Bleed now readmitted with altered mental status and R middle
lobe pneumonia. Her respiratory and hemodynamic status were
tentative at ICU arrival.  A brief description of her ICU course
is described below according to problem:

#. Respiratory failure: Likely d/t worsening HAP.  The patient's
status was tenuous upon arrival.  She was diaphoretic and
starting to use accessory muscles to breath.  She was requiring
100% NRB to maintain sats >90.  Initial ABG showed pH of 7.11.
Intubation OK with patient's wishes per husband. She was
intubated d/t resp distress, but also d/t need to place a
central line and inability to lie patient flat.  She had a
bronchoscopy which did not reveal any mucus plugs or bleed.
.
She received Vanc, Cipro and Aztreonam (given multiple allegies)
and tamiflu.  Her sputum and blood cultures were negative during
her stay. Her flu swab and culture were negative as well.
.
An ECHO was done to look for cardiac failure as cause of resp
distress.  Her was LV mildly depressed with an EF of 45-50%,
mild PA sHTN, and a moderate loculated posterior pericardial
effusion without signs of tamponade.
.
Patient was diuresed daily depending on physical exam,
respiratory status, and respiratory condition.
.
She was extubated on HD3, but still required BiPAP for
intermittent resp distress. She improved over the next several
days and at time of discharge from ICU, she was stable on BiPAP
at night for sleep apnea and nasal cannula during the day.
.
Prior to transfer to floor, pt extubated, weaned to CPAP in ICU,
and was satting well on 2L NC on arrival to the floor. She
tolerated BiPAP well O/N, slept well. She received q6h duonebs
which gave her symptomatic relief.  Broncial w
