HIP UNILAT MIN 2 VIEWS LEFT

FINDINGS: Comparison to [**2135-1-31**]. Postoperative changes status
post placement of a left total hip replacement with noncemented
acetabular component fixed with two screws and a cemented
femoral stem are noted. Gas is seen in the soft tissues. Clips
are seen along the skin laterally. There is also a right total
hip prosthesis with noncemented acetabular component fixed with
one screw and a noncemented femoral stem, incompletely evaluated
on the current study. Degenerative changes of the lower lumbar
spine are seen. There is vascular calcification. A calcified
structure in the pelvis may represent a calcified fibroid. No
hardware-related complication of periprosthetic lucency is seen.

IMPRESSION:

Bilateral total hip prostheses without evidence of
hardware-related complication.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 3549**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2136-1-31**] for an elective left
total hip replacement. Pre-operatively, she was consented,
prepped, and brought down to the operating room for surgery.
Intra-operatively, she was closely monitored and remained
hemodynamically stable. She tolerated the procedure well without
any difficulty or complication. Post-operatively, she was
transferred to the PACU and floor for further recovery. On the
floor,she remained hemodynamically stable with her pain
controlled. She progressed with physical therapy to improve her
strength and mobility. She continues to make steady progress
without any incidents. She was discharged in stable condition.
