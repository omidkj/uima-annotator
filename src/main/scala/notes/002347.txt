Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain and distention

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2148-2-10**]: Triple Lumen Subclavian; Central Venous Catheter
Insertion in VICU


History of Present Illness:
77 yo F w/ CAD, CABG in [**2142**], CHF (EF 10-15%), 2+MR, A.fib, HTN,
DM2, dementia admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2148-2-9**] to surgery for eval
of severe L sided colitis/ IBD. Now transferred to MICU for
management of CHF, respiratory failure. Pt. was initially
admitted to OSH on [**3-4**] for c.diff and IBD and discharged on
po vanco and asacol to rehab. On [**2-8**] pt. had increased abd
distension, pain and bloody stools. At an OSH, CT was signif.
for severe L sided colitis.  Subsequent Sigmoidoscopy showed
showed severe colitis to 40cm worrisome for ichemia vs. colitis.
On transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] pt. was started on po vanc, amp, cipro,
flagyl for broad spectrum coverage. On [**2-11**] pt. had an episode
of <6beats of NSVT. On [**2-13**] pt. was triggered for A.fib w/ RVR
and SOB [**2-3**] pulm edema.  She was given lasix 20 IV and
transferred to the SICU for a lasix GTT. An echo showed severe
LV hypokinesis, EF of [**10-16**]%, grade III/IV LV diastolic dysfxn.
2+MR and mild PAH. Cardiology was consulted. The pt. was started
on amiodarone for rate control of AF. The heart failure service
was consulted and recommended anticoagulation for afib when safe
and milrinone for inotropy. On [**2-15**] the pt. was in resp.
distress and was intubated. The cxr on [**2-16**] indicates bilateral
upper lobe consolidations worrisome for PNA. Pt. was started on
cefepime in addition to other abx.

[**2148-2-10**]: 1. Diffuse colitis predominantly involving the mid
transverse colon to the rectosigmoid. Differential etiologies
include both infectious and ischemic causes, [**Female First Name (un) 899**] territory.
2. Moderate ascites. No intra-abdominal or intrapelvic abscess.
3. Diffuse atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta, renal
arteries, celiac, and SMA. The celiac and SMA do opacify with
contrast. The [**Female First Name (un) 899**] is not identified.
4. Small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
.
ECHO [**2148-2-13**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. There is severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 10-15%). No masses or thrombi are seen in
the left ventricle. Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity
imaging are consistent with Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic
dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe left ventricular systolic and diastolic
dysfunction. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Trivial pericardial
effusion. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
.
CXR [**2148-2-19**]: The linear lucency seen medially in the right upper
lobe in prior study is no longer present. Otherwise this
examination is with no other changes with cardiomegaly,
asymmetric mild interstitial pulmonary edema with more focal
consolidation in the right upper lobe, and bilateral pleural
effusions with associated atelectasis in the bases worse in the
left side.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 77 yo F w/ cardiogenic shock, CHF (EF 10-15%), CAD, HTN,
a.fib, DMII, ischemic colitis. On Cefepime, amp, flagyl, cipro,
vanc po and iv. Transferred to micu for management of CHF,
respiratory failure.
.
# Cardiogenic shock/CHF: Patient had ECHO on admission that
revealed severe LV dysfunction with EF of [**10-16**]%. She
transiently required milrinone to improve cardiac output. CHF
thought to be of multifactorial etiology in setting of CAD,
tachyarrythmia, sepsis. Patient improved with lasix gtt and was
weaned off milrinone as she was hemodynamically stable.
Continued on ACE inhibitor and Beta blocker for afterload
reduction. Patient was at her estimated dry weight at time of
discharge.
.
#Ischemic colitis: pt. admitted with colitis of unclear
etiology. Ruled out x 3 for C diff.. CT abd/pelvis revealed
diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications of both renal arteries
and the celiac and superior mesenteric axis. The etiology was
felt to be ischemic in nature secondary to calcification of
vessels. Due to her other comorbidities, she was deemed not a
surgical candidate. PO vancomycin and flagyl was discontinued.
She was not started on platel as this is contraindicated in
congestive heart disease.
.
# Respiratory failure: Pt. required intubation secondary to
hypoxia and respiratory distress. CXR shows right upper lobe>LUL
consolidation, as well as hilar consolidation. However, BAL was
done and was negative. Patient was afebrile with normal WBC
count. Therefore antibiotics were discontinued. Respiratory
distress was felt to be secondary to pulmonary edema in setting
of rapid atrial fibrillation. Therefore, patient was diuresed
and subsequently extubated without complication.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: On amiodarone and beta blocker for rate
control. Anticoagulation was held initially as patient had
bright red blood per rectum secondary to colitis. Hematocrit
remained stable and patient was restarted on coumadin prior to
discharge with monit
