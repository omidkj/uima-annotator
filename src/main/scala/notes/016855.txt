History of Present Illness:
per admitting resident:

56 yo RH woman with a PMH remarkable for HTN, HLD, ex-smoker and
depression p/w new onset LEFT sided facial droop and arm plus
leg
weakness.

She was last seen in her USOH 48h ago by her children. They did
not talk to her since then (she had moved away from her son's 48
h ago).

Today at 9:00 am she pushed her life bottom because she had a
RIGHT sided headache. There is no further description of the
headache features in EMS or OSH notes. EMS arrived and took her
to [**Hospital 47**] hospital. She had an episode of "LEFT arm
contracture" with her RIGHT arm "pushing outward" and both feet
"pointing away" as per [**Hospital1 **] note (at 13:00). Afterward, she
was noted to have left sided weakness and a left facial droop.
She received a CT CNS w/o contrast that showed a LEFT
fronto-parietal avm without evidence of a bleed. She desaturated
and
was intubated for airway protection. She did not receive AEDs.
Her SBPs were 130-160, 76 bpm. Cxr was negative.

Once at [**Hospital1 18**] her VS were 150-140/ 80-90s. Afebrile. On
Propofol.

ROS is negative otherwise.

Imaging:

CTA [**3-13**]:

CTA prelim: Large tandem filling defect in R ICA/MCA beyond
siphon. Also, long- segment occlusion of R ICA from imaged skull
base to siphon, where it reconstitutes via collaterals- will
need neck CTA to characterize full extent. Await recons.

MRI/A head and neck: prelim

MRI: Some foci of restricted diffusion in R frontal lobe,
consistent with
acute infarct. No large territorial infarct, likely due to
collateral
vasculature. Limited evaluation of ischemia without perfusion
study.

MRA: R ICA occlusion above bifurcation. High-level R common
carotid stenosis at takeoff from R brachiocephalic, but is
partially patent until bifurcation.


Brief Hospital Course:
56 yo RHW with HTN, HL, Asthma and radiculopathy who presented
to OSH via an unclear history, concerning for seizure and was
found to have a large L sided AVM, R carotid occlusion from
brachicephalic up to siphon and two small acute infarction in
frontal and parietal lobes of right hemisphere.  There was no
evidence of hemorrhage on CT or MRI.

NEURO:
It was felt that her inciting event was related to a seizure due
to a large AVM.  Right carotid occlusion was felt to be chronic
in nature given collateral filling, though a definitive
determination could not be made.  Given her stroke, she was
started on ASA 325mg.  A1C was 6.0, LDL was 116.  Simvastatin
was increased to 80mg.  The stroke was felt to be either due to
stump emboli or due to watershed type infarctions in setting of
seizure and possible hypotension or cerebral ischemia from a
steal due to a large AVM.

She was started Keppra 750mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure ppx, as EEG was
notable for a left temporal spike.  Based on AVM size, no repair
was recommended by Neurosurgical and Neurology teams.  She was
scheduled for follow up in both clinics following discharge.

CARDIOVASCULAR:
The patient had isolated troponin elevation without any changes
on her EKG and CKMB within normal limits.  She was hypertensive
but home antihypertensives where initially held in the setting
of her stroke.  They where reintroduced prior to discharge.  She
should continue to be monitored for optimal blood pressure
control.

ID:
The patient had an Elevated WBC to 12K with PMN predominance.
There where no active signs of infection (negative UA and CXR
[Left perihilar streaky opacities consistent with atelectasis]).
 The patinet had no fevers and no further investigation was
completed.

ENDO:
The patient's HA1c was 6.0.  She was treated with sliding scale
insulin during this hospitalization.  The patient may benefit
from medication for glucose intolerance.

Discharge Disposition:
Home

Discharge Diagnosis:
Large left AVM
Right frontal ischemic stroke; likely thromboembolic
Hypertension
Hyperlipidemia


Discharge Condition:
The patient was hemodynamically stable.  Exam was without any
focal neurological deficits with the exception of slight left
sided weakness at the deltoid and IP.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for evaluation of left sided weakness and a
possible seizure.  You were found to have a condition known as
an AVM (arterial venous malformation).  In addition you were
found to have a stroke.  We recommend that you take a daily
asprin (325mg).

Because you had a seizure, you must also take a medication
called Keppra/L
