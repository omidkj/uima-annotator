HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a patient with a long
history of COPD who was admitted to [**Hospital6 33**] on
[**2171-10-20**], to be treated for a flare.  He was complaining of
chest pain at that time and therefore underwent an exercise
tolerance test on [**10-22**] where he was only able to complete two
minutes on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] protocol before he began having 2-[**Street Address(2) 2051**]
depressions and chest pain.  On [**10-24**] he underwent a cardiac
catheterization that revealed a 60-70% stenosis of his left
main coronary artery, a 95-98% stenosis of his proximal RCA
and a left circumflex osteal lesion that was reported as
unable to define, but clinically significant.  It was
therefore recommended that the patient undergo an elective
CABG and he was transferred to the [**Hospital1 190**] for stat evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for severe COPD with
multiple hospitalizations, pulmonary artery hypertension,
sleep apnea, hypertension, status post MRSA pneumonia, status
post appendectomy, status post umbilical herniorrhaphy, gout.

MEDICATIONS:  On admission include Allopurinol 100 mg q d,
Paxil 20 mg po q d, Singulair 10 mg po q d, Albuterol and
Atrovent inhalers, Prednisone 10 mg q d which was tapered
starting one week before admission.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission the patient had a
temperature of 96.8, pulse 61, respirations 18 and a blood
pressure of 143/74.  His pupils were equal, round and
reactive to light.  His neck was supple, there were no
masses, no bruits or lymphadenopathy.  His chest was clear
with expiratory wheezes bilaterally.  His heart had a regular
rate and rhythm with no murmurs or rubs.  His abdomen was
protuberant, soft, nontender, non distended.  There were no
masses or hernias.  Genitourinary examination was significant
for a left testicular mass.  Extremities were warm and well
perfused with no erythema, full range of motion.  Neuro exam,
he is alert and oriented times three, had no motor weakness
or numbness and normal reflexes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**10-24**].  On [**10-25**]
he underwent an uncomplicated coronary artery bypass grafting
times three with a left internal mammary artery to the left
anterior descending coronary artery, reversed saphenous vein
graft from the aorta to the right posterior descending
coronary artery, reverse saphenous vein graft from the aorta
to the obtuse marginal coronary artery.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the
cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit intubated and in stable
condition.

On postoperative day #1 a Neo-Synephrine drip was started and
the Nitroglycerin drip was discontinued.  The patient spiked
a fever to 101.7.  Sputum cultures were sent.  He was A-paced
at a rate of 88.  Over the course of the day he was weaned
off the ventilator and extubated.  He was also weaned off of
all of his drips, his pacer was subsequently turned off and
his Swan Ganz catheter was pulled back to a position to
monitor his central venous pressure.  On postoperative day #2
the patient's fever had spiked overnight again to 101.7 and
he was subsequently started on a course of Levofloxacin.  The
patient was requiring nebulizer treatments and inhalers to
manage his COPD.  As his condition was stable, the patient
was transferred to the floor on postoperative day #2.

On the floor he continued to spike fevers, although his white
count was trending downwards.  On postoperative day #3 his
chest tube output had decreased to about 100 cc over the
course of the prior day and it was subsequently removed.  He
was seen by the respiratory service which administered his
nebulizers and they felt that he was no longer in need of neb
treatment and he was switched to MDI inhalers on
postoperative day #3.  At that time his incentive spirometer
was 1250 sustained.  His Lasix was increased to 40 mg po tid,
his Foley and central lines were removed and the patient was
out of bed and ambulating.  Chest x-ray the day before had
demonstrated a left lower lobe consolidation with the sputum
cultures growing out hemophilus so it was thought that the
patient was on adequate antibiotic treatment with the
Levaquin.  On postoperative day #4 the patient's fever curve
continued to decline and his oxygen saturation continued to
improve.  As the patient's pneumonia seemed to be improving
and he was stable from a cardiac standpoint, the patient was
discharged to a rehab facility in good and stable condition
with plans to continue the Levaquin for another 8 days.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lopressor 12.5 mg po bid, Lasix 40 mg
po tid, Potassium chloride 20 mg po bid, Aspirin 81 mg po q
d, Levofloxacin 500 mg po q d times 8 days, Percocet 1-2
tablets po q 3-4 hours prn pain, Paxil 20 mg po q d,
Allopurinol 100 mg po q d, Singulair 10 mg po q d, Combivent
inhaler 1-2 puffs inhaled q 4 hours prn, Atrovent inhalers
1-2 puffs q 4 hours prn, Albuterol inhaler 1-2 puffs q 4
hours prn, Albuterol nebulizers one 3 mil unit dose qid prn,
Atrovent nebulizers one 500 mcg vial qid prn, Colace 100 mg
po bid.

Discharge Exam:  The patient was afebrile, with heart rate of
78, blood pressure 135/79, respiratory rate 24, oxygen
saturations are 89% on room air, 91% on 2 liters.  He was in
no acute distress.  Neck was supple.  He had slightly
diminished breath sounds bilaterally.  His sternum was
stable, clean, dry and intact.  Heart had a regular rate and
rhythm.  Belly was soft, nontender, non distended.
Extremities were warm and well perfused and his incision was
clean, dry and intact.

The patient was subsequently discharged to rehab in stable
condition with instructions to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**]
in one week and with his primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2-12**] weeks.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post CABG times three.
2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
