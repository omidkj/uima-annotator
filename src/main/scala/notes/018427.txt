Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 602**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoglycemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
34 year-old man with hx brittle DM1 c/b HD-dependent ESRD now
admitted with sympomatic early-monrning hypoglycemia, BS 15.
.
Patient reports taking usual dose of lantus (10 units) at 11pm
on the night prior to admission and then he next remembers being
put in an ambulance.  His girlfriend gave him glucose tablets
and called 911 because he he was "talking funny" and seemed
confused early that morning. He doesn't remember any of this.
EMS found the patient unresponsive with a FS of 15 - glucagon
and IV dextrose were administered.
.
In the ED the patient was hypertensive but otherwise had stable
VS. Initial FS was 179 & on repeat fell to 44. He was started on
D10W gtt. [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted in the ED and the patient was
admitted to the MICU for BS monitoring. Pt reports that he had
been taking his current insulin regimen for ~1 months without
hypoglycemia. Describes normal PO intake on the day prior to
admission (eats several small meals throughout the day to
prevent gastroparesis), perhaps less protein than usual. Denied
alcohol or drug use. No unusual exercise.
.
  Of note, the patient was recently admitted from [**Date range (1) 1396**] for
CHF exacerbation that was notable for flash pulm edema due to
hypertension & required intubation for worsening mental status.
Patient also briefly required nitro drip and IV labetalol as
well as dialysis for blood pressure control. On that admission,
a bronchoscopy was concerning for alveolar hemorrhage, but [**Doctor First Name **],
ANCA and anti-GBM were negative and patient had no further
episodes of bleeding. Repeat echo on that admission showed an
improved EF of 55%. That hospital course was c/b initial
hyperglycemia then subsequent hypoglycemia requiring D20 gtt. On
the floor the patient was again hyperglycemic requiring high
doses of insulin prompting transfer bact to the MICU for insulin
gtt. [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted on that admission and recommended
increasing Lantus dose to 14units qAM and 12 units qPM. Patient
ultimately signed out AMA on [**3-2**].

Past Medical History:
- DM type I since age 19, followed at [**Last Name (un) **]. Complicated by
nephropathy, neuropathy, gastroparesis, retinopathy. Multiple
prior hospitalizations with DKA, nausea/vomiting [**2-9**]

IMAGING
.
[**2147-4-7**] CXR
IMPRESSION:
1. Baseline cephalization of pulmonary vascularity and
cardiomegaly but no evidence for superimposed acute disease.
2. Suspected nipple shadow projecting over the left mid lung.
However, for confirmation, a repeat PA view with the nipple
markers is recommended when clinically appropriate.

Brief Hospital Course:
34M w/hx type 1 diabetes mellitus c/b gastroparesis,
HD-dependent ESRD and chronic systolic heart failure (with
recent documented recovery of EF)  brought to the ED by EMS
after being found confused at home with a BS 15. Hospital course
was notable for hypo and hyperglycemia. Patient left AMA prior
to insulin regimen stabilization.
.
#SYMPTOMATIC HYPOGLYCEMIA/Diabetes mellitus type 1:
Patient was initially admitted to the MICU where he was
monitored and given D10 until blood sugars consistently above
100 (137-295).  Pt reported no change in diet, alcohol
consumption or exercise to explain different response to usual
insulin dose. Pt history and OMR notes suggested long history of
difficulties controlling labile BS and admission for both hypo
and hyperglycemia. He was followed closely by the [**Last Name (un) **] consult
service in house, who recommended 8U lantus [**Hospital1 **] + humalog
sliding scale. This plan was applied for ~36h with no marked
change in lability of QACHS BS which ranged from 23 to >500.
Plan was for pt to stay inpatient for further insulin dose
adjustment, but pt decided to leave AMA prior to any further
changes. In addition, because pt was very uncomfortable using
*any* qHS lantus at home given his recent hypoglycemic episode,
[**Last Name (un) **] consult adjusted their regimen to 14U lantus qAM +
humalog sliding scale. Risks of leaving the hospital prior to
insulin regimen stabilization were discussed with the patient,
who understood. He was given a printout of final insulin scale
prior to leaving the hospital. Will need close outpatient
follow-up with [**Last Name (un) **] diabetologist and PCP.

# [**Name (NI) 40903**] ESRD
Pt's HD schedule is T/Th/S via right arm fistula (dry weight
73kg). Euvolemic on admission, underwent HD on [**4-8**]. All meds
were dosed renally.

# HTN
Hypertensive in MICU on admission. Home [**Month/Day (4) 40899**] patch,
labetalol, lisinopril, amlodipine were restarted.

# CARDIOMYOPATHY, CHRONIC SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE EF 30-35%
Secondary to long-standing and poorly controlled hypertension.
Euvolemic on admission. Currently asymptomatic, without dyspnea,
hypoxia or exam evidence of volume overload. Continued on ASA
and Labetalol.
.
# HX DIABETIC GASTROPARESIS
On PRN zofran and dilaudid at home. No symptoms during this
admission. Ate regular meals.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
Pt needs close BS/insulin regimen follow-up. He was instructed
to call his PCP and [**Name9 (PRE) **] [**Name9 (PRE
