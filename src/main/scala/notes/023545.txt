Service:  Medicine

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 69-year-old gentleman
with history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, atrial
fibrillation, bicuspid aortic valve status post [**Year (4 digits) 1291**] with
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1495**] [**Male First Name (un) 1525**] valve placement with known CAD status post
inferior MI and CABG, as well as severe systolic CHF with an
ejection fraction of 25%, admitted initially to outside
hospital on [**2174-3-17**] with an elevated INR, increasing
shortness of breath, and fatigue, and abdominal pain as well
as worsening renal insufficiency while being titrated up on
his Coreg and Lasix as an outpatient.

He was started on dobutamine  there for CHF and was off his
Coreg with good response in terms of his renal function.  He
was given 10 mg of vitamin K on [**3-17**] for an elevated
PT and was started on Heparin drip on [**3-19**], and his INR
drifted down to 1.45.  However, this was his first PTT level,
was noted to have a PTT greater than 220.  He was noted to
have mental status changes with apraxia today at the outside
hospital and head CT revealed a left parietal hemorrhage 6 to
5 cm with extension to the left lateral ventricle with mild
mass effect.

He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further care and
Neurosurgery evaluation as well as pacemaker placement for
bradycardia on a beta blocker.  On his way to [**Hospital1 18**], he was
noted to have an episode of grand mal seizure lasting 30-40
seconds with blood pressure dropping systolic from 130s to
70s.  ....... stopped.  Was given 5 mg of IV Valium and blood
pressure responded to IV fluids.  He was off dobutamine for
about two hours during transfer, and otherwise remained
hemodynamically stable except during the grand mal seizure.

in I, V4-V6, flat T waves in aVL and aVF and II.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  Notable for white count of 13.7

increasing surrounding edema in the left parietal bleed.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This was a 69-year-old gentleman with a
history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, CAD, bicuspid
aortic valve status post CABG, [**Year (4 digits) 1291**] with atrial fibrillation
and CHF, who was admitted from outside hospital with an
intracranial hemorrhage.  Patient was seen by the
Neurosurgery service on the day of admission, and had serial
head CT scans done to follow the size of the hemorrhage, and
these remained stable, so no plans were made for evacuation
in light of stable bleed.  Patient had resultant aphasia,
which after his surgery and right-sided weakness, which
remained stable over the course of his admission, and patient
did have serial CT scans of his head even throughout the rest
of his stay, which were also stable.

Patient was loaded on Dilantin on admission, and was
continued on this throughout his admission secondary to his
seizures during transfer, but these were attributed to his
hemorrhage.

Patient was seen and followed by the Neurology service,
hemorrhage perspective and felt to have cognitive impairment
consistent with Gerstmann's syndrome and was otherwise
neurologically stable until he did continue to have
increasing amounts of confusion, which was then attributed to
his hypernatremia.  Was seen and transferred to the Medicine
service for further evaluation of his hypernatremia,
worsening renal function, and CHF.

For his hypernatremia, the patient was started on free water
boluses through his nasogastric tube per the Renal team, and
his sodium continued to titrate down on this regimen and his
mental status persisted to be slightly confused until the
morning was less responsive and persistently somnolent, and
little lethargic.  Eventually, patient spiked temperatures
and although no growth on any of this cultures, was treated
as a sepsis and transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for
further management.

Patient was managed on the sepsis protocol and started on
broad-spectrum antibiotics, and otherwise was stable on this
regimen.  Had central line placed for further access and for
further management under the sepsis protocol.  However, no
growth on his cultures, but was treated empirically for a
possible aspiration pneumonia given his mental status.

In the Intensive Care Unit, was started on vancomycin,
levofloxacin, and was continued on free water drips for his
hypernatremia.  His creatinine improved with hydration and
was restarted on tube feeds.  Otherwise, he was overall
stable.  He had been then started diuresing for his CHF,
although his failure had improved throughout the course of
his stay.  His Lasix was held for a short time while he was
in worsening renal failure, and patient's digoxin was
continued with increasing frequency for a higher goal
therapeutic rate for the Renal team.

With his [**Last Name (LF) 1291**], [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1495**] [**Male First Name (un) 1525**] valve was concern for timing of
restarting anticoagulation.  This was held because of concern
for worsening his intracranial hemorrhage, and plans were to
restart it in two week's time after the bleed.  This is to be
continued by the Neurology service.

His atrial fibrillation remains stable.  He was rate
controlled and likely his bradycardia at the outside hospital
was attributed secondary to increasing intracranial pressure
and his bradycardia was on hold throughout the course of his
stay because of his decompensated heart failure and concern
for worsening bradycardia.

His renal failure improved and he was back to his baseline
creatinine over the course of his stay.  Eventually, patient
was fed through tube feeds through a nasogastric tube, but
secondary to his neurologic loss and cognitive deficit,
unsure exactly what his swallow function was, who was to have
swallow evaluation.  He did persist of having fevers of
unknown source or etiology.  He had repeat CT done of his
head, which was unchanged, CT of the sinus, which was
negative for sinusitis, and fevers were attributed to drug
fever and his Dilantin was stopped as patient had no further
seizure risk, and this likely was the source of his fevers.

Eventually, by the time of transfer from the Intensive Care
Unit to the floor, patient's mental status never improved as
prior to his admission into the Intensive Care Unit.  Patient
remained lethargic and per the Neurology team was concerned
for an additional
