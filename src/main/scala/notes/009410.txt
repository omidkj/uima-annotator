History of Present Illness:
62 yo M admitted with AMS after being discharged yesterday from
neurosurgical service. He was admitted on [**1-16**] s/p fall and had
an SDH (on Plavix). Hospital course then was c/b an NSTEMI that
was medically managed. He had persisent AMS (lethargic, but
opening eyes) and trach and PEG were palced for persisent AMS.
Per neurology, his MS never improved as it should have based on
his objective imaging. The day prior to discharge family reports
he was more lethargic and low grade fevers though no mention in
discharge summary. Also had thick traach secretions that were
sent for cx day of discharge.
He went to the [**Hospital1 **] yesterday and per family, never really
woke up. They report he wouldn't open eyes so he came to the ED.

In the ED: T:102.8 (rectal) BP:116/66 HR:80-100's RR:15-22 100%
on 50% trach mask (baseline). CT head was unchanged. CXR showed
old ? retrocardiac opacity seen on CXR on [**1-22**]. UA negative.
Some drainage around PEG tube. Labs with leukocytosis to 11.7
and left shift. Given vanco, aztreonam and levo for
hospital-acquired PNA. RUQ u/s ordered. EKG with new LBBB but CE
negative, felt to be result of NSTEMI from prior
hospitalization.
On arrival to the ICU,....
Review of systems: unable to obtain as patient is unresponsive.

ECHO: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity
size. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal cavity size. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the
basal half of the inferolateral wall. The remaining segments
contract normally (LVEF = 45 %). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (?#)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a fat pad.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2128-1-9**],
the regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction is similar.
Mild mitral regurgitation is now seen and suggestive of
papillary muscle dysfunction.
.
CT chest: New tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] nodular opacities within the lower
lobes
bilaterally, with more confluent areas of consolidation in the
lower lobes, new from the prior study. Findings are likely
infectious in etiology.
.
1. Allowing for differences in head position, overall stable
appearance to
right extra-axial fluid collection, compatible with an evolving
subdural
hematoma.
2. Stable position of ventriculostomy catheter, and stable
configuration of the ventricles.
3. Stable heterogeneous mass in the region of the pineal gland.
4. Stable sinus opacification.
5. Stable atrophy and periventricular chronic white matter
changes.
.
EEG: This is an abnormal extended routine EEG in the sleeping
states due to significant voltage assymetry and a mildly slow
and
disorganized background. The right hemisphere appears suppressed

throughout the recording. The mildly slow and disorganized
background is
suggestive of a mild encephalopathy. There were no epileptiform
features
on this study. Cardiac monitor abnormalities are noted above.
.
Wrist films: Casts are in place bilaterally, obscuring fine bony
detail.
On the right, alignment is unchanged compared with [**2128-1-19**], with
equivocal
minimal callus formation.
On the left, the current exam shows mild ulnar positive
variance, which is new and could reflect some interval impaction
along the fracture site. There is probably increased vertical
lucency along the medial and lateral aspects of the distal
radius, suggesting interval dispersion of the fracture
fragments.
Clinical correlation is requested. Faint callus formation is
noted.
.

PROCEDURES:
1. Flexible bronchoscopy.
2. Argon plasma coagulation.
3. Bronchoalveolar lavage.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  Informed consent was obtained from the
patient's wife prior to the procedure. Time-out was performed
at the bedside prior to the procedure. The posterior
oropharynx was anesthetized using lidocaine 1% spray, as well
as both nostrils using lidocaine 1% spray and lidocaine 1%
being given through the tracheostomy tube for local
anesthesia. Conscious sedation was administered intravenously
using a total of Versed 2 mg and fentanyl 75 mcg.

A flexible bronchoscope was first introduced through the
tracheostomy tube and advanced all the way down into the
airway. Upon entering the airway, there was a  significant
amount of blood, but no immediate source of active bleeding
was identified. We evaluated the right bronchial tree where
all segments of the right upper lobe, right middle lobe,
right lower lobe appeared patent with no endobronchial
lesions and no active bleeding, but there was amount of blood
pooling, especially in the lower lobe that was suctioned with
success with no further blood seen.

We then evaluated the left bronchial tree which again
revealed patent segments in the left upper lobe, lingula, and
left lower lobe with no endobronchial lesions or active
bleeding seen and again we saw pooling of blood, especially
in the lower lobe segments that was suctioned with success
with no further active bleeding seen.

We then retrieved the flexible bronchoscope up to the level
of the carina where we saw active oozing of blood from the
carina itself which was spilling into both bronchial trees.

We then removed the flexible bronchoscope through the
tracheostomy tube and advanced it through the right nostril
