History of Present Illness:
This 86 year olf white female is s/p CABG [**2188**] (LIMA-LAD,
SVG-RCA/PDA) and porcine MVR. She has chronic atrial
fibrillation ,on Coumadin. She was admitted  to [**Hospital3 **]
with chest pain  and transferred here for cardiac
catheterization. She  has noted increased fatigue with household
activities over the past few weeks, accompanied by brief "chest
twinges" that resolved with rest. At 2:30am, the day prior to
admission, while watching TV, pt noted sudden onset of severe,
10/10 chest pain. This was not relieved by TUMS and was
accompanied by nausea and diaphoresis.

She received sublingual nitroglycerin and aspirin in the ED. The
 EKG was concerning for VT v. Afib with RVR with ST depression
in V4-V6 and ?STE in lead III. A  Heparin infusion was begun.
Labs were notable for troponins of 0.02->0.07->0.09, MB49
creatinine of 1.6 (baseline), INR 2.7, BNP 2043. CXR negative
for congestion or infiltrate. Vitals on transfer HR85, RR18,
BP177/53, 100%on 2L.
She was transferred [**Last Name (un) **] for further intervention.

FINDINGS:

2. Distal LMCA disease (FFR 0.82)
3. Patent SVG-RCA. Functionally occluded LIMA-LAD.
4. Severe systemic arterial hypertension.
5. Mildly elevated left-sided filling pressure and mild
pulmonary hypertension.
6. Successful closure of the right femoral arteriotomy site with
an
Angioseal VIP device.



Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted and underwent catheterization as noted.
Referral was made for reoperative bypass grafting.  The morning
of surgery she had rest angina and, therefor, was taken to the
Operating Room for emergent bypass surgery.

Grafts to the LAD with a the RIMA was performed and repair of
the radial artery graft as well. She had episodic VT and
hypotension in the Operating Room. An intra aortic balloon was
placed and she was observed for sometime with relatively stable
hemodynamics on Epinephrine and nitroglycerin and later
Milrinone.  The chest remained open with an Esmark dressing in
place.

Post operatively she required a lot of volume and blood products
as she was on Plavix. the IABP waqs removed on [**1-26**] due to
rupture of the device. She remained oliguric and CVVH was
instituted on [**1-27**].  She was hemodynamically quasi stable on
pressors and after CVVH the chest was closed without problems on
[**1-29**].  She was gradually weaned from Epinephrine and Milrinone
while the Levophed remained on.

She had stable hemodynamics on Levophed and CVVH and the PA
catheter was removed. On [**1-31**] nights she required volume
repletion and titration of pressor.  A CXR showed a LUL
infiltrate and antibiotics for VAP were begun.

At about 1450 she acutely dropped her BP to 70 and heart rate to
40, the 30.  Epinephrine, atropine, bicarbonate and calcium were
administered. She developed runs of NSVT.  The family were in
attendance at the bedside and no defibrillation nor compressions
were given at their request. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was called and spoke
with the family who reiterated their desires.  \

She had sustained VT and was pronounced dead at 1505.  No
autopsy was allowed. dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was aware.
