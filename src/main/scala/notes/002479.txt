Radiology Report CTA PANCREAS W/ CTCP Study Date of [**2119-7-19**]
10:35 PM
Preliminary Report !! PFI !!
Comparison to CT [**2119-6-19**]. An Ill-defined low attenuation mass
within the head
of the pancreas measures 1.8 x 1.6 cm. There is new moderately
severe intra
and extrahepatic biliary dilatation as well as pancreatic
dilatation. The
pancreatic duct measures 9 mm near the level of the mass. There
is
peripancreatic stranding centered around the head. There is a
para-aortic
lymph node with a necrotic appearing center measuring 15x7mm
(3b:173). New
hazy soft tissue density encases the SMA as it courses near the
pancreatic
head (3b:164-168). The normal contour of the SMV is maintained
as it courses
anterior to the pancreas. New low attenuation areas including:
segment VI 8
mm (3b:177), 7mm IVB (3b:175), 7 mm and 6 mm in [**Doctor First Name **] are
suspicious for
metastasis but are too small to definitely characterize. A
ventral hernia
contains a loop of small bowel and a abdominal defect in the RLQ
contains a
loop of colon and several loops of small bowel. There is no
obstruction.
.
ERCP
Procedures: A small sphincterotomy was performed in the 12
o'clock position using a sphincterotome over an existing
guidewire.
A 6cm covered wall stent biliary stent was placed successfully
(Ref: 6971 / LOT [**Numeric Identifier 78701**]). Good drainage of white bile was
noted.

Impression: The major papilla was buldging and distorted.
Tight 3 cm malignant looking distal biliary stricture
Small sphincterotomy performed.
A 6 cm covered wallstent was placed successfully in bile duct.
 .
EUS
EUS
findings: Celiac Plexus Neurolysis:
EUS was performed using a linear echoendoscope at 7.5 Mhz
frequency and Celiac Plexus Neurolysis was performed: The
take-off of the celiac artery was identified.
A 22 gauge needle was primed with saline and advanced adjacent
to the Aorta, just superior to the celiac artery take-off. This
was aspirated to assess for vascular injection. No blood was
noted. Buipuvacaine 0.25% X 10 cc was injected. Dehydrated 98%
alcohol X 10 cc was injected. Saline 3 cc was injected. The
needle was then withdrawn.

Mass: A > 1.5 cm ill-defined mass was noted in the head of the
pancreas. The mass was hypoechoic and heterogenous in
echotexture. The borders of the mass were irregular and poorly
defined.

Impression: EUS guided Celiac Plexus Neurolysis was performed.
Ill-defined mass in the head of the pancreas.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 76 year old male with pancreatic cancer who was
recently discharged to rehab on TPN and tolerating sips. He
returned to go to the OR.
A CT pancreas protocol was obtained and showed New low
attenuation areas including: segment VI 8 mm (3b:177), 7mm IVB
(3b:175), 7 mm and 6 mm in [**Doctor First Name **] are suspicious for
metastasis but are too small to definitely characterize. On
[**7-20**], he went to the OR for Exploratory Laparoscopy, aborted
Whipple due to liver mets.

Pain: He still complained of lots of abdominal pain. A Chronic
pain consult was obtained and helped manage his medications. He
then went EUS for celiac plexus block on [**2119-7-25**]. His pain was
improved.

Obstructive Jaundice: Due to the mass effect, his Tbili was 10.
He then went for ERCP with placement of 6cm covered stent. His
Tbili trended down and his jaundice improved.

FEN: He continued on TPN. He was then started on a diet and his
diet can be advanced as tolerated.

UTI: He had a positive UA and was on Cipro/Flagyl.

Oncology: He was seen by Oncology and will follow-up as
outpatient.
