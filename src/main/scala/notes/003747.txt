[**2185-1-4**] ~ GI BLEEDING STUDY(Tag RBC Scan)
IMPRESSION: Increase blood flow in the region of the descending
colon. No
evidence of active GI bleed during the time of the study.
.
[**2185-1-5**] ~ GI BLEEDING STUDY (Tag RBC Scan)
Bleeding was first noticed at 6-8 minutes.
IMPRESSION: Evidence of bleeding in the pelvic bowel loops
notable within first 10 minutes. Further angiographic/surgical
correlation to determine the vscular site of origing is
recommended.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is known to Dr.[**Name (NI) 6275**] [**Name (STitle) 4869**] and presented with
bright red blood per rectum.

GI:  She was admitted to the ICU for recusitation.  She was kept
NPO, central venous access was obtained, and a PPI was started
prophylactically.  3 units of PRBCs were transfused after her
HCT dropped from 42-> 38-> 33.  She was started on Cipro and
Flagyl empirically and a Pitressin drip.  A tagged RBC scan on
[**2185-1-4**] did not indicate an active bleed.  A CT scan revealed no
extravasation of contrast, but there was new wall thickening of
the 7-8cm segment of distal colon just proximal to the distal
surgical anastomosis.  GI Service was consulted for further
evaluation of her bleed.  Patient continued to pass large
amounts of fresh bloody stool.  A gastric lavage was bilious
without evidence of blood.  A second ([**2185-1-5**]) tagged RBC scan
revealed bleeding in the rectosigmoid area, probably right
around the sacral and coccygeal hollow.  This was the area where
the right colon was connected to the rectum.  She was taken to
the operating room for a proctosigmoidoscopy and had
fulguration of a rectal bleeding point at 13 cm, injection of
epinephrine and irrigation with epinephrine.  She was monitored
in the ICU and passed maroon to green stool with presence of
clots.  C. Diff cultures x3 were all negative and C. Diff toxin
B negative.  Her HCTs were stable and she remained on a
vasopressin drip that was titrated down daily.  On Hospital Day
8 she experienced maroon stool with clots, her HCT dropped to 24
from 28 so she was transfused 2units of PRBCs.  She had a
flexible sigmoidoscopy to 50cm that showed no bleeding.  She
remained in the ICU for monitoring.  She continued to have
maroon stools on Hospital Day 11.  The GI service performed
another flexible sigmoidoscopy that revealed 2 bleeding ulcers
at 20cm, the distal ulcer was injected with epinephrine.  Her
hematocrits subsequently remained stable at 29-30.  She was
transferred out of the ICU and had no more melenic stools.  She
did have a high amount of liquid diarrhea and was empirically
started on PO Vanc.  A repeat C.diff was negative, but it was
decided to finsih a 7 day course of the Vancomycin.  Her diet
was slowly advanced from sips to a regular house diet.  At the
time of discharge she was having regular formed bowel movements
and had no melena for 4 days.
.
GU (Urinary tract Infection):  A urine culture from the ED grew
Klebsiella pneumoniae.  She was treated with a course of
Ciprofloxacin.
.
Anemia (Blood Loss and Iron Deficiency):  On arrival to the
hospital she her Fe was 109 and her HCT was 38.  Her iron levels
dropped to 31 ([**1-11**]) and 22 ([**1-16**]).  She received a total of 5
units PRBC while in the ICU for the GI bleed.  She was started
on Iron 325mg orally.  At the time of discharge, she was advised
to continue with the iron supplements.  Her hematocrit was
stable at 29-30.
.
Nutritional:  Due to her prolonged NPO status, on HD9 TPN was
started to deliver 25kcal/kg and 1.5g protein/kg for an IBW of
64kg.  TPN was cycled for 12hours overnight on HD15 and
discontinued on HD17.  Once stablized on the floor, she was
started on a clear liquid diet and slowly advanced to a low
residue diet.
.
Hypertension:  Patient was managed with Lopressor 5mg every
6hours to maintain SBP <140 and HR 60-80.  She has had no acute
cardiovascular events during this admission and was resumed on
her home regimen.
