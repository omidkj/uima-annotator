Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4891**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea/wheezing


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Briefly, this is a
59 yo M w/ COPD (FEV1 44%, [**First Name3 (LF) **] Stage III, not on home O2), lung
nodules, likely benign, and chronic back pain, on narcotics
contract, who was recently treated for COPD exacerbation as
outpatient, presented to the ED with significant worsening of
DOE and wheezing.
.
Pt. was in USOH until [**2-20**] when developed URI sx (nasal
congestion, post nasal gtt, increading cough). Seen by PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
[**2-23**] for mild cough, shortness of breath and wheezing, pulse ox
on RA was 91%. Tx for COPD exacerbation (azithro/prednisone x5
days). Noted minimal improvement in wheezing/doe w/ this course,
but felt congestion improved. Does note new green sputum for
several weeks. Last [**Doctor First Name **], noted increasing wheezing that
prevented him from coming to work, along w/ this noted
increasing fatigue and several episodes of green colored sputum
(usually does not cough in AM). Feels that his exercise capacity
decreased over the past 3 weeks from 50ft to 20ft due to DOE.
Also noted feeling "squirley" and more anxious. He denied CP,
diaphoresis, n/v or shoulder pain. No parox. noct. dyspnea or
orthopnea. Reports intermittent LE edema after working long
days, that resolves by AM.
.
On day of admission, noted worsening wheezing, had an episode of
nausea/vomiting (food particles) and a loose bowel movement
(watery stool) w/o associated sx. Given all this, came to the
ED.
Most recent hospitalization was [**10-29**] for COPD flare/CAP, tx w/
Levofloxacin and 5 day prednisone taper.
.
.
Initial VS in the ED were 98.7F 80 120/67 18 98% NRB. On exam
was tachypneic to mid 20, diffuse wheezes. Labs were notable for
WBC of 15K, HCT 54%, bicarb of 21 w/ normal AG, lactate of 3.5
(baseline WBC < 10K, HCT 40, HCO3 24-30). CXR w/o infiltrate. He
was given methylprednisolone 125mg IV, Duonebs, Azithromycin and
CFTX. Over the next 1 hr, noted to have worsening tachypnea thus
started on BiPAP, ABG, 7.46/30/165 after 5 minutes. Given
persistent requirement for [**Hospital **] transferred to MICU. On
transfer, VS 65 142/87 98% w/ FIO2 21%, RR 25-26 on [**9-22**] Bipap.
Lactate normalized to 1.5.
.
On arrival to the MICU, Pt tachypneic on BiPap, but appeared
comfortable. In the MICU Pt was treated w/ prednisone 60mg po
daily and was started on levofloxacin 750mg po daily. Also on
standing nebs. Pt then transitioned off BiPap after a few hours.
Now on home tiotropium and increased home advair to 500/50. Now
on 2L nc and sat 94%, transferred to floor.
.
On arrival to the floor, Pt's vitals were: 98.2, 101/60, 83, 22,
93% RA
.

Imaging:
[**2186-3-6**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
FINDINGS: Single portable view of the chest is compared to
previous exam from [**2185-11-18**]. As on prior, the lungs are
hyperinflated with parenchymal changes suggestive of emphysema,
particularly at the left lung apex. Increased interstitial
markings are identified at the left lung base. Elsewhere, the
lungs are grossly clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
normal limits. Osseous and soft tissue structures are
unremarkable. Linear patchy at the right lung base is compatible
with atelectasis versus scarring. IMPRESSION: Increased
interstitial markings at the left lung base, potentially due to
chronic changes; however, in the proper clinical setting,
component of infection is also possible. Two views of the chest
may help further characterize.
.
[**2186-3-7**] Radiology CHEST (PA & LAT)
FINDINGS: There is increased opacification in the left lung base
with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm when compared to
[**3-6**]. Again noted is hyperinflation and flattening of the
diaphragms suggesting emphysema. The cardiomediastinal
silhouette is within normal limits. IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe
pneumonia, more apparent than on [**3-6**].
.
[**2186-3-7**] transthoracic echo:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). The right ve
