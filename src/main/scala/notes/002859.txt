transient CP found to be hypotensive with evidence of UTI -->
code sepsis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
63f with cholangiocarcinoma and metastatic RCC with known liver
involvement who presented to ED with c/o CP found to be
hypotensive and jaundice. Pt reports 4 days of worsening
jaundice and abdominal pain. Pain is poorly described without
clear localization. Pt with worsening N/V and ability to
tolerate PO. Most recent BM several days ago was normal in color
without evidence of bleeding. No hematemesis. No
dysuria/frequency/urgency. Pt describes a 30 minute episode of

IMAGING:
[**6-19**]: Liver US: 1. Multiple heterogeneous masses in the liver,
representing known cholangiocarcinoma. Bilateral mild
intrahepatic ductal dilation. 2. Sludge in gallbladder, and
possibly in CBD.
.
MRCP:
1. Widespread liver metastases, with findings more suggestive of
cholangiocarcinoma than metastatic renal cell cancer.
2. Findings consistent with extrinsic compression of the
extrahepatic common hepatic duct by a large metastasis in the
caudate lobe, including associated intrahepatic biliary ductal
dilatation.
3. Smooth appearance of the intra- and extra-hepatic ducts
without strictures or areas of focal abnormality.
4. Layering sludge within the gallbladder, but no evidence of
sludge or stones in the bile ducts.
5. Low signal lesion in the left kidney, previously
characterized as most likely representing a renal cell
carcinoma.
.
Renal US: No hydronephrosis. This cystic structure projected
within the renal sinus on some of the sagittal images is
consistent with the previously known large renal cyst. No
definite hydronephrosis. The urinary bladder was empty on
account of Foley catheter.
.
CXR on admission: Consolidation in bilateral lower lobes, which
may represent pneumonia or aspiration superimposed upon
underlying chronic lung disease. A component of pulmonary edema
is also possible. (FINAL READ CHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUSLY
WRITTEN PRELIM READ: The cardiac and mediastinal contours are
unchanged compared to the prior study. Note is made of increased
faint opacities in left lower lobe, with interstitial opacities,
which may represent pulmonary edema, however, superimposed
pneumonia especially in left lower lobe is also a possibility if
the patient has infectious symptoms. Note is made of opacity in
right lower lobe as well, which may represent atelectasis versus
pneumonia. Possible small pleural effusion is seen. Lung volumes
are small due to low inspiratory level. Note is made of somewhat
prominent colon gas with elevated left diaphragm.)
.
DISCHARGE LABS:

Brief Hospital Course:
# ? Sepsis: On admission the pt was noted to have a lactate of
>4, tachycardia, hypotension and a UA that was suggestive of
infection.  Later, the urine culture grew GNR.  The preliminary
read of the patient's CXR was atelectasis, however, subsequent
read suggested bibasilar infiltrates that could be consistent
with pneumonia.  Initially the Biliary tree was suspected to be
another possible source of infection.  Following MRCP, it was
felt that this was less likely.  On arrival to the ICU, the pt
was afebrile without tachycardia or tachypnea.  The lactate
improved with IVF. The pt was treated with Zosyn and was
initially on the sepsis protocol with a central line.  The
sepsis protocol was discontinued on HD#2 as the pt was afebrile
with stable vital signs.  Zosyn was continued to cover uti,
possible cholangitis (though unlikely), and possible aspiration
pneumonia.
.
# Jaundice: The pt had a bilirubin that was elevated markedly
from baseline, though alkaline phosphatase remained only
somewhat elevated from baseline.  This raised concer for
extrinsic compression of the biliary tree from tumor. MRCP was
obtained and showed extrinsic compression from a mass in the
caudate lobe of the liver.  It was felt that it would be
possible to stent this open via ERCP if the patient so desired.
.
# ARF: FENA was low, renal US was negative for hydronephrosis.
Creat decreased in the ICU from 2.2 to 1.7 with hydration.
(Baseline 1.0)
.
# ONC: Peripheral Cholangio-CA and Met RCC. Not a therapeutic
candidate.  There were
.
# CAD: CP was not felt to be cardiac in nature. The pt had a
fixed defect on MIBI but initial enzymes were negative by CK.
ASA and BB were held in the ICU.  Atorvastatin was continued.
.
# CHF: reported EF 50-65% ([**2192**]). Diuretic and Aldactone were
held given volume status and ARF.
.
# HTN: as above held anti-HTN
.
# Pain control:  One of the patient's main complaints was pain.
