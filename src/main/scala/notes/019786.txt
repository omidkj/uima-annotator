.
[**2108**] C-scope: Normal colon to cecum and terminal ileum.


Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital course by problem:

# Anemia: Suspect GIB as guaiac positive on exam and has hx of
varices. EGD performed showed no active bleeding but grade 2
varices banded just in case.  Received 2u FFP, 5u pRBCs and HCT
from 17 - 24. CT abd showed no RP bleed.  No clear evidence of
hemolysis. His hematocrit remained stable stable until
discharge.  Poor marrow response was noted and Heme/onc was
consulted. They felt his anemia was due to a combination of
splenic sequestration, alcoholic bone marrow suppression and
possibly a very small chronic GI bleed. After discharge from the
MICU, his hematocrit was monitored and remained stable.  He was
advised to stop drinking immediately.
.
# CLL: followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2148**], who had been aware of anemia and
mentioned possiblity of hemolysis or marrow infiltration.
Previous hemolysis w/u has been negative and remained so now.
Per heme/onc, there was no indication for a bone marrow biopsy
at this time as it would not change management. He will follow
up with his PCP for further monitoring.
.
# Diastolic Dysfunction/CHF: Appeared volume overloaded on
presentation with an increase in his weight and increased LE
edema. His CHF meds were held initially in the setting of a GI
bleed but then restarted after the normal EGD with good
response. A repeat echo showed mild LVH, preserved EF. He began
diuresing appropriately on his home dose of Lasix 80mg PO bid
and Spironolactone to the point were he was able to ambulate
normally without significant desaturation upon discharge. He
will follow up with his cardiologist for further management.

.
# EtOH cirrhosis: His EtOH level was 29 on admission. He stated
his last drink was earlier that PM. His spironolactone and
nadolol were initially held out of concern for a GIB but were
restarted after the EGD. He was told to quit drinking
immediately, a plan to which he agrees. He will follow up with
his hepatologist for further management.
.
# Afib on coumadin:  His coumadin was initially held and
reversed with FFP prior to the EGD but was then restarted after
no bleeding was found. His INR was therapeutic prior to
discharge. He was well rate controlled with his nadolol and
digoxin.
.
# CAD:  His ASA was initially held but then restarted after the
EGD. He will discuss with his primary care physician the utility
of being on both ASA and coumadin given his risk for GI bleed.
He was continued on his pravastatin.
.
# ARF: His creatinine was 1.9 on admission with a baseline of
0.9. Likely due to prerenal azotemia, especially after it
resolved after fluid resucitation with blood.
