transferred to the TICU postoperatively for close monitoring
after post-op hypoxia and tachycardia. He was treated with
antibiotics for pneumonia and eventually underwent tracheostomy
for failure to wean from the ventilator. He gradually improved
and was transferred out of the TICU on [**2111-1-16**]. His wound began
draining bilious fluid and a CT scan revealed an enterocutaneous
fistula. On [**2111-1-20**], he went into respiratory distress requiring
mechanical ventilation and transfer to the SICU. He was placed
on pressor support for hypotension. After careful consideration,
his family decided to make him CMO and he expired on [**2111-1-25**].
