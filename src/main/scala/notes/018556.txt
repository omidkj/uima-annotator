Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer from Lakes [**Hospital 12018**] Medical Center for cath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
65 year old woman admitted on the 9th to Lakes [**Hospital 12018**] Hosp
with severe dyspnea on exertion, wheezing. She also notes
orthopnea and restlessness at night. She denies swelling in her
legs, chest pain, cough, palpitations, syncope. She does note 3
weeks of diarrhea and some URI symptoms. VS there were notable
for hypoxia of 91 % on RA. She was treated for COPD exacerbation
and found to have LV impairment on echo. She ruled out for MI
with serial troponins. Her stool was sent for cdiff and is
pending at time of transfer.
.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath. Cath showed a nonischemic
cardiomyopathy with very elevated filling pressures, a PCW of
38. She was started on a nitro gtt in the cath lab and given
lasix 40 IV. After this her PCW pressure dropped to 15. On
arrival to ICU her PCW was 13 and she had diuresed 1200 cc since
given lasix in cath lab. She denied any complaints.

Pertinent Results:
EKG demonstrated SR, rate 100, nl axis, nl int, LVH, TW
falttening in V5-6, LAE
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2190-5-7**] at Lakes Regional
demonstrated:
Mod MR, LVH, nondilated LV, generalized HK, EF 25-30%, RV
normal, mild pulmonic insuff, mild TR, Est RV pressure 55-60,
mod pulm htn, no effusion
.
TTE performed on [**5-8**] demonstrated:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis (ejection fraction 20-30 percent). There
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to
moderate ([**12-29**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2190-5-7**] demonstrated: normal LMCA,
LAD, LCX, 60% mid RCA spasm
.
HEMODYNAMICS: PA sat 59% Ao 164/82 RA 11, PA 27/20(23) PCW 38 CO
3.62, CI 2.65
.
CXR [**5-8**]:
Single frontal radiograph of the chest labeled upright
demonstrates a Swan-Ganz catheter from an inferior approach with
distal tip overlying the descending left pulmonary artery. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Biapical
opacities demonstrated right greater than left, likely scarring.
There is indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature which may
be secondary to mild interstitial pulmonary edema versus chronic
interstitial lung disease, correlation with prior examinations
is recommended. There is no evidence of pleural effusion or
pneumothorax. More focal opacity in the left mid lung zone which
may be secondary to focal atelectasis, infection, or focal
edema, or neoplasm, followup to resolution is recommended.
Visualized osseous structures are intact. There is a metallic
clip overlying the right upper quadrant, likely from prior
cholecystectomy.
.
OSH labs: WBC 17 (93%PMN, 1%bands, 4%L, 2%M), hct 30.2, plt 342

Brief Hospital Course:
65 yo F with no previous cardiac history with new non-ischemic
cardiomyopthy of unknown etiolgy with elevated right sided
filling pressures in the cath lab, now improved after nitro and
lasix.
.
1) Pump: Patient was found to have a significantly depressed EF
of 20-30% and elevated filling pressures in cath lab from her
nonischemic cardiomyopathy. DDX includes viral myocarditis,
celiac disease, lupus, hypo/hyperthyroidism. Thyroid tests
normal at OSH. She did have symptoms of URI and gastroenteritis
that could be associated with a viral syndrome causing viral
myocarditis. She also had iron def anemia which is seen with
celiac disease which can rarely cause a cardiomyopathy. TTG was
sent off for this reason and was pending on discharge. She was
placed on a nitro gtt and continued on ACEI for afterload
reduction.  She had a good response to lasix in the cath lab
with improvement in her PCWP.  She was then started on lasix
20mg PO daily.  She was also continued on low dose BB, later
switched to Toprol XL.
.
2) ? hypertension- no reported history of HTN, however patient
did have LVH on echo  at OSH (not seen on TTE here, however
evident on EKG).  Hypertension is a possible etiology of her
newly diagnosed cardiomyopathy.  She was continued on lisinopril
as above and her lopressor was titrated up for BP control.
.
3) CAD: Had clean coronaries on cath making ischemic etiology of
her CM very unlikely. She denied chest pain and did not have
ischemic changes on EKG. Given her cardiac risk factors of age,
smoking, ? HTN and hyperlipidemia she was continued on ASA 81 mg
and started on statin.
.
4) Rhythm: Followed on tele with no significant arrythmias
noted.
.
5) Hyperlipidemia: Started statin after LFTs had been checked.
.
6) Elevated FS: Likely were from solumedrol she was receiving at
OSH for presumed asthma flare. Unlikely that she had asthma
flare, more likely her SOB was from her cardiomyopathy and
elevated filling pressures.  Steroids were not continued on
arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] and her FS normalized.
.
7) Iron def anemia: Confirmed with iron studies, continued
FeSO4. Patient will need a workup for anemia (colonoscopy) as an
outpatient.
.
8) FEN: low salt diet
.
9) PPX: pneumoboots, PPI
.
10) Access: PIV
.
11) Code: full
