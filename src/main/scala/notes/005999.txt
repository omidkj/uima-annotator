Findings
[**2179-8-9**] Internal billing status corrected. No changes made in
findings. WJM
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA and RA cavity sizes.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Normal
interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size.
Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in
ascending aorta. Complex (mobile) atheroma in the aortic arch.
Focal calcifications in aortic arch. Normal descending aorta
diameter. Complex (mobile) atheroma in the descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Severely thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets.
Critical AS (area <0.8cm2). Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MS.
Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR. Normal
main PA.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. See Conclusions for post-bypass data
Conclusions
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function normal (LVEF >55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
is a (mobile) atheroma in the aortic arch. Epiaortic Scan shows
clean site for insertion of aortic cannula and application of
cross clamp. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There
is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.6 cm2). Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is no pericardial effusion.

POST-BYPASS: Aortic Valve prosthesis in place with mean gradient
14 mmHg. Small paravalvular leak which resolved with protamine.
Preserved LV function. Mild Mitral regurgitation remains. Aortic
contours intact. Remaining exam is unchanged. All findings
dicussed with surgeons at the time of the exam.

Brief Hospital Course:
Transferred in [**8-2**] and underwent preoperative evaluation.. On
[**8-5**]  she was taken to the operating room and underwent Aortic
Valve Replacement, MAZE, and Left Atrial Appendage ligation. See
operative report for further details She received vancomycin for
perioperative antibiotics since she was in the hospital
preoperatively She was transferred to the intensive care unit
for hemodynamic management.  She awoke neurologically intact and
was extubated without difficulty. Beta-blocker and diuretic was
initiated. On post operative day two she became confused and
agitated, narcotic medications were stopped.  She was treated
with haldol for the confusion with improvement.  Coumadin was
started due to MAZE and LAA ligation.  Physical therapy worked
with her on strength and mobility.  She continued to improve and
was transfer to the floor on post operative day four.  Cipro was
started for urinary tract infection due to + leuks on
urinalysis.  She continued to progress and was ready for
discharge to rehab ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **] in [**Location (un) **] NH) on
postoperative day six.

Coumadin received 3mg [**8-7**], 5mg [**8-8**], [**8-9**], [**8-10**] INR increased
from 1.3 to 2.3 no coumadin [**8-11**] w
