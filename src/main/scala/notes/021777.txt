History of Present Illness:
HPI: Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female who has a known infrarenal
AAA that was discovered incidentally during workup for known
back pain. She was found to have a 5.7cm in [**Month (only) 216**]. After
closely monitoring the patient a repeat ultrasound demonstrated
a 5.9 cm infrarenal fusiform aneurysm. Because of a history of
chronic renal insufficiency, she was admittted for hyrdation
prior to CTA tomorrow. The CTA was performed. Pt was broaught

CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2188-12-31**]):
Feces negative for C.difficile toxin A & B by EIA.

[**1-5**], AP AND LATERAL CHEST,

HISTORY: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with shortness of breath and pleural
effusions.

Moderate bilateral pleural effusion, with fissural component on
the right, not appreciably changed. Moderate cardiomegaly
stable. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.

KUB:

[**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with right upper quadrant pain following AAA
repair.

RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: The liver is normal in
echotexture without focal abnormalities. The gallbladder is
slightly enlarged, and filled with layering sludge. However,
there is no evidence of acute cholecystitis. There is no intra-
or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The CBD measures 4
mm. There is no ascites. There is normal hepatopetal flow in the
portal vein.

The pancreas is normal. Incidentally noted is a moderate right
pleural
effusion. On the left, there is no identifiable pleural
effusion.

IMPRESSION:

1. Layering sludge in the gallbladder without evidence of acute
cholecystitis.

2. Moderate right pleural effusion. No identifiable left pleural
effusion

ECHO:

The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The estimated
cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Transmitral Doppler and
tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade II (moderate)
LV diastolic dysfunction. The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with normal free wall contractility. The ascending aorta
is mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal
aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. The pulmonic valve leaflets are
thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
regional and global biventricular systolic function. Moderate
mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.

RENAL US:

HISTORY: Increased creatinine post EVAR. Assess renal blood
flow.

FINDINGS: The right kidney is small (approximately 7cm), with
minimal
parenchyma seen. Several right renal cysts are present,
measuring up to 2.8 cm in size. The left kidney is normal in
size and appearance, measuring 11.5 cm. There is no
hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis bilaterally. Adequate Doppler
imaging could not be performed due to the patient's inability to
breath-hold. Doppler examination was unsuccessful.

IMPRESSION: Unsuccessful Doppler ultrasound examination
secondary to
patient's inability to breath-hold. Small, atrophic right kidney
with minimal parenchyma seen, with multiple right renal cysts.
Normal appearance of the left kidney.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**12-17**]

She underwent an EVAR, post there was marked angulation of the
proximal aortic neck and only a single patent left renal artery.
After deployment of our stent graft and our Palmaz stent, there
was still a fairly significant type 1 endo leak from the
proximal attachment site. No distal endo leaks were noted.

She did tolerate the procedure well. There were no
complications. She was transferd to the CVICU in stable
condition. She was extubated at the time.

Post operative she was on Nitro drip to keep SBP 100-140.

[**12-18**]

Pt with decrease U/o. She recieved fluid boluses. Had a slight
increase n creatinine.  Stage 3 CKD with acute on chronic renal
failure, Probable ATN. Pt did recieve PRBC for hypovolemia. Was
put on lasix drip to improve U/O. Renal Consult obtained.

HCTZ and allopurinol held. Electrolytes followed [**Hospital1 **]. SBP kept
at 120 or greater. Nephrotoxins avoided. Renal US obtained. C3,
C4 and eosoniphils obtained CVP kept greater then 12.

NTG drip, IV lopressor, Hydralazine for high BP

[**12-19**]

O2 requirment for pt with increase edema. Lasix continued, to
keep pt negative. Creatinie increased. U/O marginal.

EBS, insulin SS initiated.

Pt recieved 2 units PRBC's, Post HCT stable

Renal US, atrophic right Kidney, Left Kidney poor perfusion. U/O
decreases. Creatinine continues to climb.It was decided to
reintervene. Pt taken to ENDO rm for Left renal artery
angioplasty. Given Bicarb pre and post. Mucomyst PO., Tolerated
the procedure well.

TTE obtianed. A line placed, Central line placed.

[**12-20**]

Continued to moniter respiratory status. Nebs give, C/W Lasix
drip.

recs.

[**12-21**]

Continued to moniter respiratory status. Nebs give, C/W Lasix
drip. CHF diagnosis for fluid overload and decrease u/o. Pt
Intubated

Off pressors

Creatinine now 3.6, C/W Lasix drip. U/O decreased.
Chlorathiazide added to regime. c/w renal recs.


Brachial hematoma noted from brachial access for renal
angioplasty

EBS, insulin SS

[**12-22**]

Hematoma expanding on RUE. Pt brought to OR for R brachial
artery repair. Tolerated the prodedure well. No Complications
from procedure.

Pt c/w intubation

Recieved another unit PRBC

Creatinine now 3.8, C/W Lasix drip, Chlorathiazide continued.
U/o monitered. c/w renal recs.

EBS, insulin SS

[**12-23**]

c/w CVICU care

Brachial access site c/d/i.

Creatinine now 4.o (peaked), C/W Lasix drip, Chlorathiazide
continued. U/o monitered. c/w renal recs.
