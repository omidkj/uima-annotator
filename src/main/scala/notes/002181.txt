Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was seen and assessed in the ED by the Urology
service.  Following persistent hypotension to SBP 80s, continued
chills and leukocytosis, the decision was made to place a
ureteral stent given CT findings of obstructive stone.  She had
received iv levofloxacin, ceftriaxone.   The patient was taken
to the OR and underwent cystoscopy and right ureteral stent
placement.  The patient was placed on Ampicillin/Gentamicin both
peri- and post-operatively.  She was taken to the ICU
post-operatively for observation, and did transiently require
use of a cardiac pressor (neo) to maintain SBPs>80.  Over the
course of POD1, she was weaned from pressor dependence and began
to autodiurese.

The remainder of her course was unremarkable.  Her leukocytosis
improved and she remained afebrile for the rest of her
hospitalization.  The Foley catheter was removed and the patient
voided spontaneously.  She had no significant pain complaints.
She was ambulating and tolerating a regular diet.
