HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73-year-old
with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, who was admitted with
chest pain and found to have ST elevations and was sent to
CCU for emergent cath.  For at least past several months the
patient has been noticing some dyspnea on exertion, unclear
exertion.  She can still walk up the stairs or walk a block
but has been getting slowly worse recently.  Also
intermittent chest pain, not severe, which resolves on its

severe chest pain.  The pain started at 3 o'clock. This was

that she previously felt well, otherwise, had recent episode
of flu.  Also received flu shot.  She sleeps on one pillow,
no PND.

At the outside hospital Emergency Room she was chest pain
free but with  EKG changes.  Pain recurred.  Patient received
Morphine Sulfate, Nitroglycerin, Aggrastat, Heparin and Lasix
which made her pain free.

Labs were significant for troponin 3.79, creatinine 1.1,
hematocrit 41. She was then transferred from [**Location (un) 31315**],
[**State 350**] by [**Location (un) **] to [**Hospital1 188**] cath lab.  In cath lab she had a wedge of 28 with a V
wave of 40 left ventricular end diastolic pressure measured
24.  She had a low normal ejection fraction with inferior
wall motion abnormality and 4+ MR.  LAD was seen with 80%
stenosis at first septal and was not intervened upon at this
point.  Left circumflex showed 60% stenosis OM1, RCA with 90%
proximal PDA and 95% RCA before PDA with avulsed plaque and
thrombus as well as 70% stenosis of mid RCA.  Three stents
placed in right coronary artery and the patient was sent to
the ICU.

In the ICU the patient denied chest pain, shortness of
breath, diaphoresis or nausea.

heart failure thought to be secondary to hypertension, no
history of stress test or echocardiogram.  Diabetes mellitus,
elevated lipids, right knee arthritis.

daughters and one son, takes care of husband with [**Name (NI) 2481**]
disease.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for history of myocardial
infarction.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Weight 82 kg, temperature 96.3, pulse
95, blood pressure 149/96, oxygen saturation 96% on three
liters.  In general, obese, not in acute distress, alert.
Pupils equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation,
bilateral extraocular movements intact.  Neck supple.  JVP
elevated.  Cardiac, regular rhythm and rate, normal S1 and
S2, [**4-20**] holosystolic murmur throughout precordium, unable to
auscultate well at the axilla anteriorly.  Pulmonary, clear
to auscultation with some decreased breath sounds at the
bases.  Abdomen, positive bowel sounds, mild tenderness in
the left lower quadrant, no guarding, no rebound, trace lower
extremity edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  At the outside hospital white cell count
12.5, hematocrit 44.9, platelet count 269,000, CK 131, MB
4.1, troponin 3.79.  Chem 7, sodium 139, potassium 3.7,
chloride 104, CO2 27.8, BUN 18, creatinine 1.1, glucose 223.
EKG prior to the catheterization as below with ST elevations
inferior leads with 0.5 to 1 mm and 3 mm depression in
anterior leads as well as T wave flattening laterally.  Post
cath normal sinus rhythm at 87, normal axis, normal
intervals, question of left atrial enlargement, Q waves in
lead 3 and small Q wave in AVF, 0.[**Street Address(2) 1755**] elevation in lead 3
with biphasic T waves inferiorly, ST depression of 2 mm
anteriorly with early R wave progression as well as T wave
inversions.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the CCU.  She
was continued on Aspirin and Plavix and Aggrastat, Lipitor,
ACE inhibitor and beta blocker.  She was diuresed with Lasix.
Echo at the bedside was done and showed no flail leaflet.  On
[**2-6**] she was transferred to the regular floor, had no
complaints of chest pain or shortness of breath.  She was
taken back to the cath lab on [**2-6**] for LAD intervention.
Her LAD was stented. Cardiac catheterization showed pulmonary
capillary wedge of 20 and ejection fraction of more than 60.
Cardiac echo done on [**2-6**] showed mild dilation of left atrium,
LVEF more than 55%, mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets and
mitral valve leaflets as well as trivial pericardial effusion.
She was discharged to home on [**2147-2-8**] on a cardiac healthy diet
in good condition.

bid, Glucophage 1 gm po bid and Glucotrol 100 mg po tid,
Ciprofloxacin 500 mg po bid for 7 day course for a urinary
tract infection and Plavix 75 mg po q d for 12 months.

[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 284**] within 1-2 weeks from discharge.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Myocardial infarction, status post RCA stenting times
three and LCA stenting times one.
2.  Diabetes.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Hypercholesterolemia.
5.  Congestive heart failure.
