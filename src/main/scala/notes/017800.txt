Admission Date:  [**2133-11-18**]       Discharge Date:  [**2133-11-26**]

Date of Birth:   [**2057-3-21**]       Sex:  F

Service:  GENERAL SURGERY/PURPLE TEAM.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old
female with a known gastric ulcer on EGD presenting initially
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit with bleeding per rectum.
The patient was in the usual state of health until the day
prior to admission, when she developed gradual weakness.  She
also had several loose stools of unusual collar and poor PO
intake.  The daughter reported noticing bright red blood in
the patient's bowel movements and brought the patient to the
emergency room for evaluation.  The patient was managed
medically by the MICU team during which time she received
approximately 10 units of blood over a three-day period.

On hospital day #2, the patient was taken for EGD, which
demonstrated old clotted blood in the entire stomach.  No
apparent bleeding within the stomach itself.  After
excavation and area of active bleeding was sitting in the
pyloric channel, similar to that described on 8/[**2133**].
Hemostasis was achieved with epinephrine injections.  After
the procedure, she was discharged back to the Intensive Care
Unit for continued medical management.

On [**2133-11-19**], the Department of General Surgery was
consulted.  At that time, recommendations were made.  Medical
management was recommended, as well as discontinuing any
nonsteroidals or aspirin products with request for surgery to
be consulted if bleeding continued to be a problem.

On [**2133-11-21**], the patient was noted to become profoundly
hypotensive with blood pressure in the 80s/50s.  Surgery was
called.  Hematocrit measured at that time was 26, down from a
previous of 30.  It was determined at that time that the
patient would require an operation to repair her bleeding
ulcer.  Consent was obtained.  The patient was taken to the
operating room for a subtotal gastrectomy with Billroth II
anastomosis.  Please see operative note from
Dr.  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for details of this operation.  The
patient, after the operation, was transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit, where she was given aggressive volume
rehydration.  The patient had received two units of packed
red blood cells in the MICU.

On [**2133-11-21**], she received an additional two units in the
operating room.  The patient did well within the Intensive
Care Unit.  She was gradually weaned from her FIO2 to room
air.  She was transferred to the floor.

On postoperative day #3, she was gradually advanced from
clear sips to full clears to general diet.  Due to the
patient's poor ambulatory status, rehabilitation was
considered appropriate, intermediate move from the hospital
to home.

At the time of discharge, the patient was tolerating a post-
gastrectomy diet without difficulty.  She was quite requiring
any rehydration to maintain adequate fluid.  She was voiding
and stooling normally.  Stools did demonstrate old clot
within them, consistent with the amount of bleeding that she
had had previously in her upper GI tract.  This was not
considered worrisome due to the fact that the hematocrit had
remained stable at or above 30 during this entire period.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to a
rehabilitation facility.
