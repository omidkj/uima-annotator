Pertinent Results:
INTRAOP TEE: [**2132-7-30**] PRE-BYPASS: No spontaneous echo contrast is
seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
There is bowing of the interatrial septum suggesting increased
left atrial pressures. The interatrial septum does not appear
aneurysmal. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. There is partial P2 mitral leaflet flail.
An eccentric, anterior directed jet of moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the
regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly
underestimated (Coanda effect). The C-[**Month (only) **] distance is 2.9 cm,
with a [**Doctor Last Name **]/PL ratio of 1.7. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
POST-BYPASS: The patient is status post mitral valve repair.
There is a well-positioned annuloplasty ring in the mitral
position. No mitral regurgitation or paravalvular leak is seen.
There is no mitral stenosis with a mean gradient of less than 5
mmHg. Biventricular function is unchanged. There is trace aortic
regurgitation. There is no evidence of systolic anterior motion
of the mitral valve or left ventricular outflow tract
obstruction ([**Male First Name (un) **]/LVOTO). The ascending aorta, aortic arch, and
descending thoracic aorta are intact.

CXR: [**2132-8-3**]: Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. A
valve replacement is seen.  There is a small left-sided pleural
effusion. There is some atelectasis at the lung bases, which is
stable since the previous study. No pneumothoraces are seen.
There are no signs for overt pulmonary edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 90917**] presented to the ED the day prior to planned surgery
with pain. Enzymes were negative and on [**7-30**] he was taken to the
Operating Room and underwent a Mitral valve repair and Coronary
artery bypass grafting x 1. CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS TIME:120
minutes. CROSSCLAMP TIME: 93 minutes. He tolerated the procedure
well and was transferred to the CVICU, intubated and sedated in
critical but stable condition. He was weaned from low dose Neo
Synephrine, awoke neurologically intact and was extubated the
night of surgery. All lines and drains were discontinued per
protocol. He was started on Beta blockers/Aspirin/Statin,
diuresed and transferred to the floor on POD #1. Physical
Therapy was consulted to evaluate mobility and strength. Of note
his rhythm was in a first degree AV block/accelerated
junctional, continued on low dose beta blockers (this was
present on day of discharge as well). Stable HCT 24 and was
started on iron. He continued to progress and the remainder of
his hospital course was essentially uneventful. He was cleared
for discharge to home with VNA services on post-op day six with
the appropriate medications and follow-up appointments.
