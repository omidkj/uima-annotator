HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 59-year-old white male
has a history of exertional shortness of breath with cold
symptoms for the past three weeks.  He was treated with
Zithromax and continued to have exertional shortness of
breath.  He noticed bilateral leg swelling and presented to
the [**Hospital6 33**] where a chest x-ray revealed CHF and
bilateral pleural effusions.  He has a history of
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity.  An
echocardiogram showed left atrial enlargement with 3+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 7968**] LV function with an EF of 20%, midseptal inferior
and inferoposterior hypokinesis consistent with
cardiomyopathy.  He ruled out for an MI but it is likely that
he did suffer a recent MI. The patient underwent cardiac
catheterization which reportedly showed three vessel coronary
artery disease.  He was diuresed and transferred to the [**Hospital6 1760**] for CABG.

respiratory therapy.  He had his chest tubes discontinued on
postoperative day number two.  He also went into atrial
fibrillation and was started on Lopressor and Amiodarone and
converted to sinus.

He continued to progress and on postoperative day number five
he was discharged to home in stable condition.  His
laboratories on discharge revealed a hematocrit of 28, white
count 8,000, platelets 188,000.  Sodium 141, potassium 4,
