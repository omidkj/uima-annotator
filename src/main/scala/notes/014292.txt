Attending:[**Location (un) 1279**]
Chief Complaint:
2:1 CHB s/p temp pacer wire placement, here for pacemaker and
ICD


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
S/P biV pacemaker and ICD placement


History of Present Illness:
79 yo M w/ hx with CAD, CM w/ EF 15-20%, and an OSH admission
two weeks ago for syncope with 2:1 heart block that subsequently
reverted to 1:1 conduction who went to see his cardiologist [**6-14**]
for fatigue and recent syncope ([**6-13**]). He was found to be in 2:1
heart block with a ventricular rate in the 30s and an SBP in the
70s; he was admitted to an OSH. His furosemide dose had been
increased prior to his admission and his hypotension was
partially attributed to overdiuresis.  Pt. received a normal
saline bolus with an increase in his SBP to the 90s. He was
stable overnight and was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for EP
consult and biventricular pacemaker w/ ICD implantation.
.
Pt was taken for temp wire placement, as pacer/ICD placement was
deferred given his INR 2.7.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
79 yo male with  history of CAD, EF 20% w/ new Complete heart
block, currently in 2:1 block, s/p temporary wire placement,
transferred here for permanent pacemaker.
.
# Heart block- He was given vitamin K SQ at the outside hospital
and his INR was 1.5 so ICD and [**Hospital1 **]-V pacer placed on [**2168-6-16**]. The
pacer/ICD was placed without complications. He was V paced. He
reported feeling much better after the pacemaker was placed. He
developed a hematoma at the site of pacemaker implantation which
was monitored by EP: pressure bandage applied with resolution.
EP interogated the pacemaked prior to discharge on [**6-20**]. Pt is to
complete 7 day course of abx as prescribed.

#CAD: We initially held his carvedilol given the heart block. We
continued amiodarone and ASA and statin. We lowered his dose of
carvedilol given persistent hypotension after the procedure,
likely [**2-17**] decrease volume. Patients SBP in 80-90s range,
however he remained asymtpomatic.  Although initially
discontinued, he was started on low dose of valsartan (40mg
daily) prior to discharge. He should follow up with his
cardiologist/PCP and have blood pressure meds adjusted as
tolerated.
.
#CHF: Currently euvolemic. Given ARF and hypotension, patients
lasix and diurel were held, and ultimately not restarted on
discharge per EP recs. He should have these restarted in follow
up with his cardiologist/PCP.
.
# ARF - Likely in setting of overdiuresis given recent increase
in lasix and poor perfusion from heart block . His creatinine on
admission was 2.5 up from baseline, and went down to 1.7 and
then back up to 2.1 with re-starting of lasix and diovan. His
creatinine was trending back down upon discharge, to 1.4 after
d/cing lasix and diovan. His urinalysis and urine eos were
negative.
