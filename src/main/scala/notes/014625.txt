left sided chest and abdominal aching since Friday (worse since
yesterday), increased lacrimation, and congestion. She also has
nausea which is chronic. The pt is unable to receive flu shots
due to prior hx of GBS. Yesterday she developed a cough

pcp records, compared to a year ago at 177, she is now weighing
at 223 lbs. She was increased from lasix 10mg daily to 20mg
daily. At that point she also reported a small increase in
shortness of breath, although not markedly so. Urine tox was

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Pulmonary arterial hypertension and moderate cardiomegaly.
3. Pneumonia in right lower lobe posterior basal segment and
mild to moderate atelectasis in left lower lobe.
4. Mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy leading to

[**2163-2-2**] ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect or
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast with maneuvers. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The
right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with depressed free
wall contractility. There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitatio
