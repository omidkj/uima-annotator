Creat Clearance by 24H urine is 44 with a caution that Creat

ECG shows: none seen since [**5-16**] but was Afib at 93 with LBBB,
associated repol changes.

[**5-21**] CXR: INDICATION: Line placement. PORTABLE CHEST: Comparison
is made to chest film from two days earlier. The Swan-Ganz
catheter has been removed, and there is now a right IJ central
line with tip in the SVC. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. There are bilateral
pleural effusions, probably without significant change, allowing
for differences in patient positioning.


Brief Hospital Course:
On the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] [**Hospital1 **], her aldactone was stopped and captopril/coreg
continued.  She had her enzymes cycled, they were (-).  ARF was
felt to be prerenal; a pansensitive UTI from Klebsiella was
treated with cipro then levo as her WBC rose and levo was the
actual drug tested.  CHF team was involved (perhaps to do [**Hospital1 **]-V
pacer earlier than planned).  UOP dropped with concern for
cardiac shock.  [**5-17**] she started dopamine, titrated up to 5 as
BP fell to 70s.  EP suggested amio for a month and reattempting
DCCV.  Statin was given for cholesterol.  Despite this
management she worsened.  Diuretics, hydralazine and ACEI were
then held ~[**5-18**].  Dopamine resulted in rapid Afib and decreased
blood pressure.  A goals of care discussion was held and family
and patient opted for aggressive care.  Therefore she was
transferred to the CCU on [**5-18**].

In the CCU, renal followed but she never needed hemodialysis.
Dopamine was stopped, a Swan was placed, and tailored therapy
begun.  Several other drips were tried; vasopressin ([**5-18**] only)
and levophed ([**5-19**] only) were not helpful, but she did stabilize
on dobutamine and natrecor (with lasix added [**5-20**] and good
effects of the combined regimen).  Digoxin was begun ([**5-19**]).
Coreg was also started ([**5-19**]) low dose despite the dobuta drip
to help rate control her Afib along with amiodarone;
anticoagulation was changed to enoxaprin around [**5-21**].  Swan was
d/c'd on the 26th.  ACEI was restarted at captopril 6.25
increased to 12.5 tid on the 29th. A course of levofloxacin was
continued for pansensitive Klebsiella and completed on [**5-22**].
She was called out on [**5-24**] for further management.  Thanks to
the CCU for their excellent care.

At that time, she denied CP, palps, SOB, orthopnea, PND, edema,
abd discomfort, dysuria, fever, chills, or any concerns.  On the
floor, she was continued on captopril 25 mg tid, digoxin, and
coreg 3.125 [**Hospital1 **]. The dobutamine was continued at 5mcg/kg/min for
one adn half days, then decreased to 3 mcg/kg/min for a day,
then decreased to 1.5 mcg/kg/min, and finally D/c on [**5-28**] with
pressures remianing in th low 90's and U/O between [**9-14**]
cc/hour. Mrs. [**Known lastname 6174**] was enouraged to increase her PO intake.
Lasix 40 mg PO was started once her pressure was stable off of
dobutamine. Amiodarone was decreased to 200 mg qd and coreg was
decreased to 1.5 mg [**Hospital1 **]. Coreg will be increased to 3.25 mg [**Hospital1 **]
in one week. She has follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2031**] for her CHF.

She remained on amiodorane per EP request while on the floor and
coumadin was held due to a supertheraptuic INR. She is to have
her INR checked as outpatient. She remained on telemetry while
on the floor with no significant events.

Her Cr remained below her baseline between 0.8 and 0.9 for her
stay. Levofloaxacin was continued for her UTI. She will be D/c
on 1 week of 250 mg levofloaxacin to give her a total of 14 day
course.

Her hyperlipidemia is managed with lipitor 10 mg qhs. Follow up
with PCP.

After a long discussion with the patient, family, and case
management the patient was evaluated for rehab and will be D/C'd
to rehab.

Pt continues to be treated with sertraline for depression. Her
depression was increased at times while in the hospital due to
her critical medicla situaitn. Her outlook improved on
discharge.

The right IJC was removed without complications prior to D/c.

Pt was D/c'd to rehab in good condition with follow up with PCP
and Dr [**First Name (STitle) 2031**].
