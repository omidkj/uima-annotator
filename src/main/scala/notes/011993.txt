ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 61-year-old gentleman status
post chemoradiation treatment for stage IIIB lung cancer who
now presents with a new enlarging right lower lobe lesion.

The patient was scheduled for right video-assisted thoracic
surgery and wedge resection.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient presented on
[**2119-3-19**] for elective right video-assisted thoracic
surgery and wedge resection.  The patient was taken to the
operating room and tolerated the procedure well.  He was
transported to the Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable
condition.  The patient was mildly hypotensive and had a
reported history of hypotension after previous surgeries.

While the patient had a right-sided chest tube that was to
suction while in the Postanesthesia Care Unit, the nursing
staff noted the patient had a sudden increase in chest tube
output of bright red blood.  The patient had approximately
120 cc over 15 minutes which was a dramatic increase in rate
from when coming out of the Postanesthesia Care Unit.  The
patient was also hypotensive; however, he was mentating well
and was not tachycardic.

A chest x-ray was obtained which showed no evidence of an
effusion or hemothorax.  The patient was rolled onto
dependent position which did not produce a gush of blood.
The patient was examined by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 175**] and was felt
should be re-explored for control of the bleed.

The patient was brought back to the operating room and was
found to have bleeding from one of the port sites.  This was
cauterized, and the patient was transferred again back to the
Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.

On postoperative day one, the patient required a
Neo-Synephrine drip overnight to maintain mean arterial
pressures above 60.  The patient was given several fluid
boluses and had good urine output.  He was not tachycardic
but continued to have persistently low blood pressures in the
90s/50 with mean arterial pressures in the 60s; requiring a
Neo-Synephrine drip.  Over the course of the day on
postoperative day one, the patient was gradually weaned off
the Neo-Synephrine drip.  The patient's Foley catheter was
removed.  The chest tube was also removed.  A postoperative
chest x-ray was obtained which showed no change after removal
of his chest tube.  The patient's diet was advanced.  The
patient passed a voiding trial.  He was taking oral intake.
Felt that despite the patient looking good that he should
stay one more night.   The patient was transferred to the
floor off of all drips, tolerating a regular diet, and
ambulating without assistance.

On postoperative day two, the patient was afebrile with
stable vital signs.  The patient was on a regular diet and
was ambulating well.  The patient's examination was
unremarkable.

DISCHARGE STATUS: The patient was discharged to home on
postoperative day two with followup with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 175**] in
one week.
