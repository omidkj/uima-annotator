Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
ARF, Hypernatremia, Altered MS


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
HPI:
74 y/o m w h/o prostate ca s/p radical prostatectomy, h/o DVTs,
ICH, htn recently admitted for decreased uop p/w n/v/diarrhea
for past several days at rehab facility, and new altered MS,
found to be in ARF in ED, with Cr. 2.2, Na 158. He was recently
admitted [**Date range (1) 58794**] for episodes of diaphoresis, decreased urine
output, and ARF with a Cr 2.5, which improved with IVF. He was
also treated with 5 days of azithromycin at this time for
concern of R hilar PNA on CXR and leukocytosis.
.
According to his wife he began having nausea and vomiting over
the weekend at the rehab and seemed slightly drowsy on Monday
but was oriented and communicating fully. Since Monday he has
progressed to only intermittently responding to questions with
yes/no answers, and he began having diarrhea in addition to
nausea/vomiting. Prior to his last admission he was walking
unassisted with a spastic gait, however he was bedridden during
this last admission and since being at rehab had only progressed
to getting into a wheelchair.
.
In the ED he was also noted to have an amylase 666 and lipase
733, with a noraml T bili. He was not noted to have any clear
evidence of abdominal pain. His CT abd showed cholelithiasis
without evidence of cholecystitis, and some evidence of
proctitis, with concern for infectious proctitis, but no other
intra-abdominal pathology. His head CT was negative for bleed or
CVA, CXR showed improvement in R perihilar PNA, but his U/A was
grossly positive. He was given vanc/levo/flagyl to cover broadly
for the possibility of infection and UTI. He has remained
hemodynamically stable with HR 60s in afib, and BP 120/70s.

Pertinent Results:
Labs:
noted for Cr 2.2, Na 153 (down from 158 at presentation),
amylase 666, lipase 733, See below
.
EKG: afib at 62/nml axis, int/ TWF in III and aVF (old)/no ST
changes
.
CXR: Interval improvement in right perihilar consolidation
.
Head CT: negative
.
Abd CT:
1. Opacities at the left lung base are concerning for aspiration
or
pneumonia.
2. Thickening of the rectum which could be secondary to prior
radiation therapy. If the patient has not had radiation, this
could represent an infectious proctitis.
3. Small amount of pelvic free fluid.
4. Bilateral renal cysts.
5. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. UE weakness: The patient has a history of cervical stenosis
that resulted in diffuse weakness in the past.  On his last d/c,
the patient was unable to walk or feed himself and returned from
rehab in much the same condition.  He was evaluated by neurology
who felt that his weakness was likely [**1-2**] cervical stenosis seen
on MRI and mild cord enhancement below this level.  He was
evaluated by ortho-spine who did not recommend acute surgical
intervention and felt that he would be best served by a soft
cervical collar and intensive PT.  He was d/c to [**Hospital 81068**]
rehab.
.
2. Hypernatremia: Pt was hypernatremic on admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
and his urine osms/lytes were checked.  He was repleted with 1/2
NS and his sodium corrected quickly with this regimen
.
3. Altered MS: The patient was disoriented w/ AMS on admission.
He was covered broadly w/ zosyn/vanco/flagyl in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] but
these were stopped on the floor as his cultures returned
negative.  His hypernatremia was corrected as above and his
mental status improved with this therapy.  By the time he was
called out to the floor, he was mentating normally and was AAO
x3.
.
4. ARF: His ARF on admission was attributed to his dehydration
and he was fluid repleted as above.  His dehydration was
corrected w/ IVF as above and his renal failure corrected with
IVF.  He had a renal U/S that showed no evidence of
hydronephrosis.  His ace-i was initially held [**1-2**] this ARF but
this was added back on as his failure corrected.
.
5. GI: The pati
