Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 668**]
Chief Complaint:
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
mental status changes and sepsis.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2109-8-5**] Exploratory laparotomy, Lysis of adhesions ,Temporary
abdominal closure with a [**State 19827**] patch
[**2109-8-12**]  Exploratory laparotomy; closure of abdomen with
component separation and debridement of skin, subcutaneous
tissue, and muscle; abdominal wound closure.
[**2109-8-23**] Tracheostomy and bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
Per Dr.[**Name (NI) 670**] operative note, Mr. [**Known lastname 102989**] presented
approximately 13 hours to the surgery service,
transferred from a long-term skilled nursing facility with
mental status changes and profound hypotension. In the
emergency room, he was noted to have a blood pressure of
60/40. He received multiple fluid boluses and started on
pressors. He was transferred to the surgical intensive care
unit where he underwent placement of invasive lines and was
started on Levophed and Neo. Ultimately, Pitressin was added.
He received several units of packed cells and large volume
resuscitation. Over the course of the day, his blood pressure
slightly improved but not substantially. Eventually, he was
able to undergo CT scan which demonstrated what appeared to
be bilateral pulmonary consolidation and while there was no
evidence of free air, there was some thickened small bowel in
the proximal intestine and some findings that could be
consistent with pneumatosis. These were not obvious on the CT
scanner. Based upon his overall clinical status, we elected
to proceed with exploratory laparotomy.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 102995**] had a complicated, prolonged hospital course with
most of this time in the SICU. Per Dr.[**Name (NI) 670**] operative note,
Mr. [**Known lastname 102989**] presented to the ED from a long-term skilled nursing
facility with mental status changes and profound hypotension. In
the emergency room, he was noted to have a blood pressure of
60/40. He received multiple fluid boluses and started on
pressors. He was transferred to the surgical intensive care unit
where he underwent placement of invasive lines and was started
on Levophed and Neo. Ultimately, Pitressin was added. He
received several units of packed cells and large volume
resuscitation. Over the course of the day, his blood pressure
slightly improved but not substantially. Eventually, he was able
to undergo CT scan which demonstrated what appeared to be
bilateral pulmonary consolidation and while there was no
evidence of free air, there was some thickened small bowel in
the proximal intestine and some findings that could be
consistent with pneumatosis. These were not obvious on the CT
scanner. Based upon his overall clinical status, he proceeded to
the OR ([**2109-8-5**]) for  exploratory laparotomy, Lysis of adhesions
and temporary abdominal closure with a [**State 19827**] patch for sepsis
and abnormal CT scan suggestive of proximal small bowel
pneumatosis. Surgeon was Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. No abnormalities
were noted intra-abdominally. Please see operative note for
further details. Due to the massive distention of the small
bowel the abdomen was unable to be closed therefore a Silastic
patch was sutured to the anterior abdominal wall. A JP was
placed.

On [**8-6**], he failed extubation trial and a bronch was done with
sputum sent which grew pseudomonas and enterobacter cloacae.
Meropenum was started for pseudomonas. Inhalation tobramycin was
added for pseudomonas in sputum. IV flagyl was given for
anaerobic coverage and PO vanco for presumed c.diff colitis. He
was also on IV caspo for emperic coverage for fungemia. Stools
came back negative for c.diff.

ID was consulted and followed recommending discontinuation of IV
caspo, po vanco and iv flagyl. Recommendations included a 14 dAy
course of Meropenum, discontinuation of linezolid on day 8 and
switching Caspo to fluconazole. ID signed off on [**7-31**].

He was treated with fentanyl for abdominal pain. Due to NPO
status TPN was given. A lasix drip was administered for
anasarca. This was discontinued on [**8-14**].

The Kentuck patch was periodically tightened and on [**8-12**], Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 816**] performed exploratory laparotomy; closure of abdomen
with component separation and debridement of skin, subcutaneous
tissue, and muscle; abdominal wound closure. He was extubated on
[**8-13**] and was maintained on a 50% Face Mask. On [**8-14**], a speech
and swallow eval found that he did not have signs/sx of
aspiration and recommended slow initiation of ground solids and
thin liquids. Clear diet was started on [**8-15**] as well as a tube
feeding with TPN weaned off. He experienced loose frequent
stools. Several stool specs were sent for c.diff with all being
negative.

On [**8-15**], he had an episode of hypoxia with a sat of 85% and self
limiting run of bradycardia with rate of 30's. O2 sats improved
on 100% face tent. TTE did not show  evidence of heart strain or
PE. Cardiac enzymes were negative. Troponin was 0.12 with a
creatinine of 1.6. He required re-intubation. A chest CTA was
negative for a PE. This showed persistent but improving LLL
pneumonia, with new RUL pneumonia. He did receive IV bicarb for
renal protection. He produced copious amounts of sputum which
continued to grow pseudomonas. WBC increased to 16.4 and
Linezolid was started. He was extubated on [**8-17**], but was
required reintubated for desaturation on a NRB.

ID was reconsulted on [**8-20**] for persistent growth of pseudomonas
noted on BAL on [**
