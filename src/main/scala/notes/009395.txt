History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is an 84-yo man with history of a-fib and
hypercholesterolemia who presents with right sided abdominal
pain that started on the night prior to admission. The patient
reports some associated nausea but no emesis and has had some

was found to have a temperature of 101, and abdominal pain.
Ultrasound of the RUQ showed a distended gallbladder with mild
pericholecystic fluid and moderately positive [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign. Pt
was given Zosyn and 500cc NS. The pt was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further evaluation.

3. Imaging/diagnostics:
ERCP ([**2145-7-15**]): Impression: Normal major papilla
Cannulation of the biliary duct was performed with a
sphincterotome using a free-hand technique The common bile duct,
common hepatic duct, right and left hepatic ducts and biliary
radicles were filled with contrast and well visualized. The CBD
was approximately 5mm in diameter.
The course and caliber of the structures are normal with no
evidence of extrinsic compression, no ductal abnormalities, and
no filling defects.
The cystic duct and gallbladder did not fill with contrast.
Given high clinical suspicion of cholangitis, a sphincterotomy
was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a sphincterotome
over an existing guidewire.
Balloon catheter sweep of the duct did not reveal any stone or
sludge.
Excellent drainage of bile and contrast was noted

Echocardiogram ([**2145-7-20**]):
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with normal free wall contractility. The diameters of
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal global and regional systolic
function. Moderate pulmonary hypertension with dilated right
ventricle and mild to moderate functional tricuspid
regurgitation. Compared with the report of the prior study
(images unavailable for review) of [**2139-12-3**], RV dilation is
new. The other comparable findings appear similar.



Brief Hospital Course:
84-year-old man with history of atrial fibrillation presenting
with abdominal pain, found to have acute cholecystitis at
outside hospital, transferred for management of possible
cholangitis.
.
# Cholecystitis:
The patient was transfered from [**Hospital1 2436**] Hopsital with acute
cholecystitis; imaging showed no stones and CBD of 4 mm. Given
his WBC elevation to high 20s and fever, there was concern for
cholangitis. The patient transfered to the MICU and had an ERCP
on [**2145-7-15**], that showed no obstruction or stones. A
sphincterotomy was performed. After this, his bilirubin has
trended down from 2.1, and the patient had no signs of post-ERCP
pancreatitis. He was started first on zosyn 4.5 g IV and was
transferred to the surgery service. The patient had a US-guided
transhepatic percutaneous cholecystostomy drain placed on
[**2145-7-17**]. Antibiotic coverage was changed from zosyn to unasyn.
LFTs were monitored, with continued decline in total bilirubin.
Alkaline phosphatase remained elevated to 170s with increase to
238 on day of discharge, while AST and ALT have peaked in the
60s and 70s. We have suggested continued twice-weekly LFT
monitoring. Interventional radiology has recommended repeating a
RUQ US to assess drain location if LFTs become abnormal. The
patient continued to have drainage from his cholecystostomy
drain, and his pain resolved. Cultures of his drainage have
grown Streptococcus anginosus and Clostridium perfringens. He
will need t
