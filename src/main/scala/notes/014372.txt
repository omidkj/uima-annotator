CT Abdomen
--------------
TECHNIQUE: A CT of abdomen and pelvis was performed with axial
images taken from the lung bases to the symphysis pubis. Oral
and IV contrast was administered and reconstructions are
performed in the coronal and sagittal planes.

CT ABDOMEN
FINDINGS: The lung bases reveal bilateral consolidation and
collapse with minimal pleural effusions noted. Below the
diaphragm NG tube is in situ. The liver and spleen are normal.
The gallbladder is normal. The pancreas is atrophic. The
adrenals and kidneys are unremarkable. In the left lower
quadrant, note is made of some fat stranding and post-surgical
change. There is dehiscence of the lower anterior abdominal wall
in the midline. The stoma is noted in the left lower quadrant.
Some free fluid is seen in the midline in the mesentry measuring
2.4 cm x 3.9 cm. This is not amenable to drainage due to its
location where it is surrounded by bowel. Slightly more
superiorly extending from the psoas muscle on the left side some
free fluid is noted. This measures approximately 6 cm in
transverse x 3 cm in AP diameter. This may represent
post-surgical change. The findings were discussed with the team
at the time of the examination.

Two surgical drains are seen, the tips of which are located in
the pelvis.

CT OF PELVIS: The bladder is catheterized. The tips of the
surgical drains are in situ. No significant free fluid.
Multiplanar reconstructions were essential in depicting the
anatomy and identifying the pathology.

Bony windows reveal no suspicious sclerotic or lytic lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. Postsurgical change in patient who is status post
sigmoidectomy for diverticulitis.
2. Some minimal free fluid seen in the midline in the mesentry
measuring 3.9 cm x 2.5 and in the left flank measuring 6 cm x 3
cm.
3. Stoma is seen in left lower quadrant with some dehiscence of
the midline incision

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname 3075**] [**Known lastname 33372**] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital 7188**] Hospital
on [**2101-2-6**]. At arrival he was intubated and sedated.  Vital
signs were stable. Urine output was WNL. WBC count was 12.5.
Vanco/Gent/Flagyl were continued for empiric coverage.  TPN was
provided.  The stoma was very edematous, requiring catheter for
drainage.  The midline incision was erythematous and this was
opened up, drained, and packed with 1/2 Dakin's solution. At HD
3 he was febrile. A CT scan of the abdomen was completed which
showed some minimal free fluid in the left flank and midline
abdomen, which were not remarkable to drain. There was bilateral
consolidation and collapse in the lung bases. At HD 4 he was
febrile, but hemodynamically stable and with good urine output.
Blood, urine and sputum cultures were negative. A
bronchoalveolar lavage was performed for culture.   The lavage
culture was negative. At HD 5 he was extubated without event.
His NGT was removed.  His weight was 255, with pre-admission
weight at 230.  Diuresis was continued. At HD 7 he had return of
bowel function with increase in stool and air.  He was afebrile
and tolerating clear liquids.  His respiratory status was
stable, maintaining room air sats in at 97%.  He was transferred
to the floor. At HD 11 he remained afebrile and doing well.  He
was discharged home in good condition with [**Hospital1 **] dressing changes
at the midline incision site with 1/2 Dakin's solution. He was
given a prescription for Percocet for dressing changes.  He was
to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**] in clinic in [**1-22**] weeks.
