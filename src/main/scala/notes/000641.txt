DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Retroperitoneal mass:
Portion of normal adrenal gland.
Fibrous tissue with necrosis, calcification, chronic
inflammation and giant cells.
Note:  Stains for acid fast bacilli (AFB) and fungus (GMS) are
negative.  The changes may represent retroperitoneal fibrosis
related to the aneurysm.
B.  Abdominal aortic aneurysm contents:  Thrombus.
.
CT scan
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral pleural effusions with areas of adjacent passive
atelectasis.
2. Postoperative changes involving the abdominal aorta including
periaortic fluid collections as noted.
3. Hyperattenuating renal lesions noted bilaterally for which
dedicated ultrasound is recommended for further
characterization.
4. Suggestion of splenic and hepatic infarcts as noted.
5. Findings most consistent with postoperative ileus.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented to [**Hospital3 **] Hosptial with a 6 hour
history of abdominal pain. He was found on workup to have a
contained ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. The patient was
emergently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for operative repair. The
patient was taken to the operating room, where he underwent an
open AAA repair with 20mm dacron graft via a retroperitoneal
approach. A large incarcerated hiatal hernia was also found at
the time of surgery and repaired. The [**Female First Name (un) 899**] was taken down but not
re-implanted due to a profuse amount of backbleeding indicating
good collateralization of blood flow. The patient tolerated the
operative intervention and was transferred to the ICU intubated
and in guarded condition. Due to a massive amount of
intraoperative blood loss, the patient required transfusions of
blood, platelets and cryoprecipitate perioperatively. Pressor
support was slowly weaned off by post-operative day 1.
.
However, the patient developed acute renal failure (ischemic
ATN) post-operatively and was put on CRRT (Continuous Renal
Replacement Therapy) until [**10-14**], at which time he was put on
hemodialysis (requiring intermittent HD). His tunneled line was
removed when became septic.  He tolerated hemodialysis on [**10-15**]
and [**10-17**]. His femoral HD catheter came out [**10-17**]. UOP improving
greatly.  His creatinine decreased and then plateaued.  The
nephrology service felt that the Cr will not return to baseline
(0.9) since AAA involved renal arteries. He will follow-up with
nephrology as an outpatient.
.
He was transferred to the floor on [**10-18**] in stable condition.
.
Skin:
Of note, he has an excoriating rash on coccyx and inguinal
region.  He was cared for by wound care specialists - he been
receiving miconazole powder and anti-fungal cream.  On the day
of discharge this was resolving.
.
Neuro:
No major issues.  On the day of discharge his pain was well
controlled with acetaminophen
.
Cardiovascular:
Aneurysm as described above.  In addition, His blood pressure
was well-controlled with lopressor by the day of discharge to
protect his AAA repair.
.
Pulmonary:
The patient also developed a post-operative pleural effusion and
pneumonia that required IR drainage.  He had a prolonged
ventilator wean.  He was also treated with chest physical
therapy, inhaled albuterol, and incentive spirometry.
.
GI:
The patient was transiently on total parenteral nutrition (TPN)
from [**Date range (1) 29441**] and also briefly on tubefeeds but on the day of
discharge had been advanced to a regular diet.  He was followed
closely by our nutrition specialists.  However, he is unable at
this time to feed himself secondary to weakness.  The patient
has chronic diarrhea.  He was ruled out multiple times for c.
difficil infection.  He was treated with loperamide to slow down
his stool output.
.
Renal:
Pt had transient renal failure as described above.  On the day
of discharge, he had good urine output with a creatinine of 2.4
(trending down from a high of 3.8).
.
ID:  During his hospital course, the patient got septic from
pneumonia, growing out Stenotrophomonas from sputum, with
pleural effusion consistent with exudate status post tap.  He
was briefly on pressors for blood pressure support.  This
infection resolved with antibiotics.  On the day of discharge,
he had no active infections, was afebrile, WBC =5.7, and was not
sent home with any antibiotics.
.
Prophylaxis:
The was on subcutaneous heparin.  NO acute issues occurred.
