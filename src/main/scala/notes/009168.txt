History of Present Illness:
69 yo woman with h/o CHF, AFIB, ?seizure disorder, recently
discharged from rehab after recent hospitalization for
evaluation of seizure (felt ultimately to be facial tick), was
in USOH until lunch on morning of admission, when upon rising
from a chair, she felt lightheaded/dizzy and slid to the ground.
Her daughter was with her and helped her. No LOC, post-ictal
confusion, incontinence reportedly at the time. After being
helped back into her chair by her daughter, her symptoms
resolved over 5-10 minutes. Her daughter describes a second fall
in the evening, when upon standing to leave, she was again
LH/dizzy, and fell into her daughter who was getting her walker.


ROS notable for poor PO intake x1-2d. She otherwise denies f, c,
ns, ha, cp, sob, palpitation, n/v, abdominal pain, dysuria,
constipation, diarrhea. She has been living with one of her
daughters since d/c from rehab a week ago and was doing well
initially but not eating much recently. Also she has been
supervised some of the time but not all of the time at home. Up
until about [**Month (only) **] she was living independently at home, but
had a fall there and since then has been in the hospital (St
Vincents or Mass [**Hospital1 **]) or rehab or with her daughter.

Past Medical History:
1. paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: on coumadin in the past but

Pertinent Results:
EEG [**2107-5-11**]:  IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG
recording due to the left PLEDs with a frequency of .[**5-6**] Hz. The
slow background and even slower background with a lack of
predominant posterior rhythm on the left. The first abnormality
suggests cortical irritability associated with a
structural abnormality in the left hemisphere. The second
abnormality
suggests a mild encephalopathy and the third abnormality
suggests a
structural subcortical dysfunction in the left hemisphere. The
excessive beta activity is probably secondary to a medication
effect.
PLEDs are frequently associated with clinical or subclinical
seizures.
If the patient remains lethargic, long-term EEG monitoring may
be of
further diagnostic value in this patient.
.
Echo [**2107-5-12**]:  The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF 60-70%). There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2102-2-27**], no major change is evident.
.
CT Head [**2107-5-10**]:  IMPRESSION:
1. No intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Asymmetric lateral ventricle size, left slightly larger than
the right, of unknown clinical significance or chronicity
without priors
.
CXR [**2107-5-10**]:  IMPRESSION:
NG tube in good position with tip terminating in stomach
.
CXR [**2107-5-7**]:  IMPRESSION: Limited radiograph. No evidence of
consolidation or effusion. If clinically indicated, dedicated PA
and lateral radiograph could be obtained for further evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course:
69-yo woman with h/o seizure d/o, CVA, recent hospitalization
for facial tics and another recent hospitalization for phenytoin
toxicity, admitted for near-syncope and falls, now s/p seizure
on the floor after stopping phenytoin on admission being
transferred out of the MICU to the floor for continued
observation given.
.
#. Seizure Disorder: Pt had witnessed seizure on the floor in
the setting of subtherapeutic phenytoin levels and being treated
for UTI with ciprofloxacin. The patient has had trouble with
phenytoin clearance, and was discontinued due to
supratherapeutic levels on admission. The patient's Keppra was
continued however. Neurology was consulted and recommended a
