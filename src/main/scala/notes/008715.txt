Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
Bradycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo with PMH significant for CAD, COPD, PAF, and CRI and three
admissions in last month for ARF on CRF, UTI, PNA, and
asymptomatic bradycardia and discharged 3 days ago.  Pt returns
today for worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.  Pt was seen
yesterday by VNA and found to have SBP in 80's and bradycardic;
labs showing worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.  Pt asked
by PCP to come in for further evaluation.

On arrival EMS noted her to be bradycardic to 30's, but
asymptomatic. In ED received, D50, insulin, kayexalate, calcium
and bicarb with improved potassium. Remained bradycardic in 30's
and SBP stable off further anti-hypertensives to 100-110's. She
denies any chest pain, fevers, or any other changes.  History
largely obtained from sister, who reports that she is confused
at baseline with her dementia. ROS: + nausea, no emesis,
decreased po's, + loose stool, and  DOE (unclear if worse than
baseline).

15. CHF - maintained on lasix, ACE.  EF 55%, Echo [**4-25**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but not
stenotic. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild-moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.
16. s/p bilateral lens replacement

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with multiple medical problems was
admitted with asymptomatic bradycardia and worsening renal
failure. She developed respiratory failure during her admission,
was intubated, extubated, and eventually passed away while on
comfort measures.

1. Hypoxia: Patient developed hypoxia during her admission and
was intubated. After a short course, she was extubated. It was
decided with the patient's sister (and proxy) that she would be
DNR/DNI with comfort at utmost importance. She did well after
extubation for several hours, but then developed worsened
hypoxia again. Given progression of renal failure and multiple
system issues, a decision was made by the ICU team and the
patient's sister to make patient comfort measures only. She was
transferred to the floor and was treated with morphine, ativan,
and scopolamine patches for comfort. A palliative care consult
was obtained. The patient passed away at approximately 10 pm on
[**2193-2-4**] secondary to respiratory arrest. Other major medical
issues addressed during admission will be briefly discussed
below.

2. Bradycardia-  On admission, patient was asymptomatic with HR
as low as 35, which then improved to 60s while holding
antihypertensives.  Cardiology was consulted and recommended
elective pacer placement if patient/family wished. This was not
done due to the events discussed above.

3. A fib- in A Fib during admission with slow response.  Her low
dose amiodarone was continued. Pt was not on anticoagulation due
to h/o GIB.

4. [**Name (NI) 10271**] Pt discharged 3 days prior to admission with a
creatinine 3.8.  Likely had a new baseline (3.5-3.8).  ARF
possibly secondary to hypotension/bradycardia. FeNa 0.5% so
thought to be possibly pre-renal as well.  She was rehydrated
gently, as patient has diastolic dysfunction and easily develops
CHF. Anti-hypertensives
were held. Hyperkalemia resolved. Renal US r/o
obstruction/hydronephrosis and showed changes consistent with
chronic parenchymal disease. Renal team was consulted.  They are
hoping to avoid dialysis. Family wished for this as well. As
patient's respiratory status worsened, decisions were made for
CMO and dialysis was not pursued.

5. CHF- Diastolic dysfunction. EF >55% 6/02. Pt with history of
deveoping CHF with fluid hydration so fluid status monitored
closely. Intubation occurred likely from CHF, fluid overload.

6. COPD- Continued outpatient regimen of salmeterol, flovent,
combivent.

7. communication: constantly with patient's sister, her proxy.
