with contrast showed an obstructing 8mm stone in the proximal
right ureter with moderate hydronephrosis and perinephric
stranding. Treated with levofloxacin and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED
for urological consultation. Initial labs here notable for WBC#
9.1 with 44% bands and +U/A. Had asymptomatic HoTN to SBP 70s, R
IJ placed, treated with zosyn and IVF with improvement in BP.
CXR showed LLL and possible RML infiltates. Given zosyn. Treated
empirically with ceftriaxone upon arrival to MICU. Never

perc nephrostomy tube placement: IMPRESSIONS:
1. Moderate-to-severe right hydronephrosis, to the level of the
proximal
right ureter, as seen on same-day CT from outside hospital.
2. 8 French pigtail right nephrostomy tube placed, with
decompression of the
renal collecting system.
3. Some contrast is noted to pass into the mid ureter beyond the
level of the
proximal ureteral stone, which was visualized on CT.


Brief Hospital Course:
#. Pyelonephritis/Nephrolithiasis/urosepsis: Urology consulted
in the ED. Given presence of obstructing nephrolithiasis, and
hemodynamic compromise pt was taken to IR for percutaneous
nephrostomy tube drainage and placement. Pt was fluid
resuscitated blood pressure medicines held. She responded well
and never required pressors and was transitioned to the floor on
the day after admission. Pt was initially treated with
ceftriaxone and narrowed to levofloxacin when cultures from OSH
grew 10-50,000 proteus sensitive to levofloxacin. Pt was started
on flomax and toradol which was transitioned to ibuprofen on the
day of discharge. Pt's blood pressure remained stable after the
first 12 hours of her hospitalization.
.
#. COPD/Pneumonia: Pt noted to be mildly hypoxic in the ED to
89%, pt does have COPD c baseline oxygen saturations of 92-95%
per pt. There is concern of possible LLL infiltrate which on
review of CXR is unimpressive. She was covered for both the
pyelonephritis and ? pna with levofloxacin. She initially
required supplemental oxygen but on the day of discharge was
able to walk c saturations of 89-93%.
.
#. Tachycardia: Per patient she always has a fast heart rate.
Infection could also be contributing. Pt takes diltiazem prn
palpitations which her cardiologist recently suggested she take
daily for BP control. This medicine was held throughout
hospitalization.
.
#. Hypertension: Pt was admitted to ICU for hypotension.
Antihypertensives were held throughout admission
.
#. Hyperlipidemia: continued on atorvastatin.
.
# DM: diet controlled at home. on insulin sliding scale in
hospital but required very little.
.
#. Hepatic nodules: Will need follow up CT abd as an outpatient
in 6 months for comparison films.

Discharge Diagnosis:
R kidney stone obstructing ureter

secondary: COPD


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status:Clear and coherent
Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive
Activity Status:Ambulatory - Independent


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for a bad kidney infection and
a kidney stone and a pneumonia. You initially were admitted to
the intensive care unit because your blood pressures were low.
You got a tube from your back into your kidney to drain the
urine from your kidney because you have a stone blocking the
normal drainage of the kidney into the bladder. You are on one
antibiotic which treats both your kidney infection and your
pneumonia. It is called levofloxacin. You are also being given a
strainer to strain your urine. If you find a kidney stone,
please save it and bring it to your urology appointment.

When you get home please stop taking your avapro because your
blood pressures are still low. Please don't take the cardizem
either unless you are having the palpitations.

We are giving you several new medicines:
1. levofloxacin (an antibiotic) to take for 2 weeks
2. ibuprofen for pain
3. flomax (to help pass the kidney stone) You should talk to Dr
[**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] stopping this medicine after your kidney stone is gone
4. we added iron to your medicines because you had anemia, we
also added a stool softener called colace because iron can be
constipating

Please continue your healthy diabetic diet.

Because of your anemia, please discuss with your primary doctor
whether it is time for a colonoscopy.

** you will have a visiting nurse and a physical therapist
visiting you at home.
