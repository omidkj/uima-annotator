Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8850**]
Chief Complaint:
(1) Planned admission for autologous SCT on BEAM regimen
(2) left intraparenchyma bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Autologous stem cell transplant

Left craniotomy and evacuation of hematoma x 2

History of Present Illness:
This is a 65-year-old woman with Stage III high grade B cell
lymphoma admitted for autologous stem cell transplant on the
BEAM regimen.

Upon admission, the patient reports she is feel well with the
exception of a pulled muscle in her back which occurred this
morning after slipping in the shower. Her pain is a [**2161-4-13**] and
she was able to walk after this occurred. Additionally, she
reports that is having a recurrence of diarrhea. She recently
completed a course of PO Flagyl for C dificile. She was doing
fine without recurrence of diarrhea until approximately 2-3 days
ago when she started having multiple episodes of diarrhea every
day, worse in the morning after eating breakfast and has [**5-14**]
episodes of diarrhea in a short period of time. She reports that
her current diarrhea appears to be the same as when she had C.
difficile.

On review of systems, she complains of a dry cough for over week
but reports this has improved steadily and only has this
intermittently. She denies fevers, chills, night sweats, sore
throat, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or shortness of breath. The
patient is currently off her anticoagulation (has a history of
HIT) and admits to persistent bilateral lower extremity edema
(L>R) which has improved slightly which has remained. She is off
anticoagulation given her thrombocytopenia and h/o HIT. She
continues to have significant neuropathies in her feet with
numbness, and loss of proprioception of the feet while
ambulating.

Past Medical History:

- Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia
- Hypertension
- Osteoarthritis
- s/p Tonsillectomy
- s/p Cholecystectomy

- s/p suprarenal IVC filter [**2158-2-10**]: Large thrombus (chronic)
involving the infrarenal IVC as well as a thrombosis of the left
common iliac vein and left femoral veins.

Past Oncologic History: (Per OMR note, [**2158-3-18**])
Onc history begins in [**10/2157**] when patient began to experience
two week history of diarrhea, abdominal distention and
discomfort. She was seen by her primary care provider and
started on ciprofloxacin. Then on [**2157-10-18**], the patient
presented to the [**Hospital3 **] emergency room with acute episode
of shortness of breath. She was found to have bilateral
pulmonary emboli on CTA and was started on heparin. Additional
symptoms at that time included night sweats and fever but no
weight loss.

Evaluation during Mrs.[**Known lastname 69951**] initial admission with CTA showed
bilateral proximal large PE's. CT of the chest, abdomen, and
pelvis revealed a moderate-size right pleural effusion with
enlarged axillary lymph nodes measuring 2.5 cm on the left and
1.5 cm on the right. There was noted a pericardial mass
measuring 2.2 cm x 2.5 cm. There was also abnormal enhancement
and thickening of the omentum of the lower abdomen and pelvis as
well as large right inguinal lymph nodes measuring 2.6 cm. Note
was also made of filling defect within the left common femoral
artery consistent with DVT of the left lower extremity. Mrs.
[**Known lastname **] was initiated on heparin therapy and underwent a left
inguinal lymph node biopsy on [**2157-10-25**], which revealed
high-grade large B-cell lymphoma with immunohistochemistry study
strongly positive for BCL-2 and CD20. Cells were also positive
for CD19, CD10, and lambda light chain. The C-MYC analysis was
found to be 57%. Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy on [**2157-10-25**]
revealed no evidence for lymphoma. Her LDH at diagnosis was 586.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was then discharged on Lovenox and Coumadin. She
underwent a PET scan on [**2157-10-28**], which revealed intense
uptake within bilateral axillary node, presternal node,
pericardial node, bulky mesenteric mass consistent with matted
lymphadenopathy along with some right iliac and bilateral
inguinal nodes and some uptake within the subcutaneous region
around the umbilicus. She was seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7117**] at
[**Hospital6 2561**] on [**2157-11-1**] for initiation of treatment.


Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was started on R-CHOP chemotherapy which was planned
on a dose-dense schedule with her first cycle on [**2157-11-2**]. She
was able to keep on schedule despite admissions for fever and
neutropenia. Her sixth cycle was delayed by one week due to an
admission for fever and neutropenia with completion of
chemotherapy on [**2158-1-17**]. Her treatment was otherwise
supported with Neulasta along with Aranesp. In [**11-14**],
patient was found to have worsening swelling in her left lower
extremity and was found to have heparin induced
thrombocytopenia. She was started initially on lepirudin and
then transitioned to Coumadin. Additionally, she also was found
to have staph infection of her finger requiring surgical
drainage and antibiotics and a subsequent staph infection of her
right toe. These have both resolved. She had a POC placed for
venous access but this became clotted and did not function. She
then had a double lumen PICC line placed for the remainder of
her treatment. This has since been removed.

Mrs. [**Known lastname **] underwent a PET scan after four cycles of her
chemotherapy on [**2158-12-9**]. This showed significant improvement
within the chest with essentially complete resolution of FDG
avid lymphadenopathy within the axilla and pericardial region.
There was also significant improvement noted in the size of
mesenteric mass with marked decrease degree of FDG uptake,
although still with mild-to-moderate uptake noted. A PET scan at
the completion of treatment showed no FDG-avid disease. Because
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] presented with stage III high-grade lymphoma with
significant adenopathy and aggressive disease, it was felt that
autologous stem cell transplant offered the best potential for
cure. This, however, presented with some difficulties due to her
history of HIT and the fact that there would be periods of
thrombocytopenia during her treatment course. The stem cells
could be collected without the use of heparin and her [**Known lastname **]
catheter could be maintained using sodium citrate instead of
heparin flushes. Mrs. [**Known lastname **] also had a Port-A-Cath in place which
was not functioning. In preparation for her chemotherapy for
mobilization and stem cell collections and subsequent autologous
transplant, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was seen in interventional radiology on
[**2158-2-10**] for Port-A-Cath removal and IVC filter placement. At
the time of the IVC filter placement, there was demonstration of
a large thrombus which was chronic in nature involving the
infrarenal IVC as well as a thrombosis of the left common iliac
vein and left femoral veins. Therefore, the IVC filter was
placed in the suprarenal area. Her Port-A-Cath was also removed
due to its nonfunctioning nature. The decision was made to
proceed with a temporary [**Year (4 digits) **] catheter placement at the time
of her stem cell collection as well as a temporary central line
at the time of her autologous transplant. Because she would
require periods of being off her Coumadin, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] would
continue anticoagulation with fondaparinux 7.5 mg subcutaneous
daily.

Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted for high dose Cytoxan for stem cell
mobilization on [**2158-2-16**]. She tolerated this relatively well
with some diarrhea, but developed profound pancytopenia as is
expected requiring platelet and red cell transfusions. Her
fondaparinux has been on hold since [**2158-2-24**] due to low
p
