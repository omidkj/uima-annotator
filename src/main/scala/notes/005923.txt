Brief Hospital Course:
74 yo F with severe COPD admitted with COPD exacerbation
secondary to RSV bronchiolitis
.
# COPD exacerbation/RSV bronchiolitis - On admission the patient
was found to have RSV on nasopharyngeal aspirate. She was
treated supportively with stress dose steroids, Bipap and
frequent nebulizers. She was also given a 5 day course of
levaquin for possible secondary pneumonia. Given her persistent
leukocytosis she was also treated with ceftriaxone for a 5 day
course, stop date [**1-4**]. Was initiatlly given high does steroids
and tapered; however, she continued to require high doses
subsequently during her stay for fluxuating respiratory status
and thrombocytopenia (as below). Inital CT Chest with no clear
infilitrate, c/w severe emphysema.  On [**2162-1-11**], her respiratory
status acutely worsened.  CXR showed worsening right infiltrate.
 Antibiotics were broadened to zosyn/levo.  She required
intubation, but she was unable to be ventilated/oxygenated
properly.  She subsequently expired on [**2162-1-12**].

# bacteremia: enterococcus faecium cultured from her blood on
[**2162-1-6**].  Vancomycin was added as per sensitivities.
.
# thrombocytopenia: her platelets dropped precipitously on
[**2162-1-5**] and she subsequently became more anemic.  Heme/onc
consult was initiated.  It was thought to be HIT vs ITP vs meds
vs infection-related drop in platelets.  She was continued on IV
steroids until [**1-11**] when it was changed to 60mg po prednisone.
Possible offending agents were discontinued.  Smears showed
little evidence of hemolysis, though her hapto and LDH were
consistent with hemolysis.  She received platelet and pRBC
transfusions as necessary.  CT for RP bleed was negative.  Her
Adamts13 came back slightly low at 61.  She underwent
plasmaphoresis for several days with no improvement in her plts.
.
# UTI:  Patient with +UTI on UA, urine culture with yeast. Given
the patient had symptomatic dysuria, she was treated with
fluconazole for 10 day course.
.
# Tachycardia ?????? Occurred after Zopenex, improved with
Metoprolol.  She was continued on metoprolol 12.5 TID and ativan
qhs prn.
.
 # Coronary Artery Disease s/p STEMI related to coronary
vasospasm: continued aspirin. Metoprolol as above, continued
acei as tolerated (though was held during while on
plasmaphoresis).
