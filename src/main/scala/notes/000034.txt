Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 15044**]
Chief Complaint:
prolonged R sided shaking

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation


History of Present Illness:
Briefly, pt is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with PMH notable for breast
CT
in [**2081**] (s/p R mastectomy), pancreatic CA [**2094**] (s/p whipple's),
colon CA d/c'ed [**1-2**], s/p total colectomy, who is transferred
from the ICU after presenting in partial status epilepticus.
According to the daughter, after her recent colectomy she has
had
complications of post-operative ileus, overall decreased po's
and
weight loss. She was in her nursing home and was relatively
stable until the day prior to admission when she was more tired
and not taking in any po's. That night her nursing aid noted
that
she had L face, arm, and leg twitching, unclear if true LOC
associated with it. The twitching began around midnight and
continued through the morning and she was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further evaluation.

IN ED she was noted to be talking coherently through the
twitching, with O2 sats down to the low 90's on 2L NC. She was
given a total of 4 mg ativan and then 1 gm dilantin bolus that
stopped the shaking, however she became so sedated that she
required intubation.

She was admitted to the ICU for further management.

Brief Hospital Course:
ICU/Floor course by system:

Neuro:
1. First time seizures - This episode was thought to be focal
status, and once stopped she never had a recurrent of
seizure-like activity. It was thought that perhaps her seizure
was secondary to severe electrolyte abnormalities in the setting
of poor nutrition post operatively. She was continued on
dilantin, initially 100 mg IV TID, but her levels were
persistently supratherapeutic and upon transfer to the floor the
dilantin was held each day while levels were checked. On [**1-29**] the
level was finally within low-therapeutic range (4.4, when
corrected for albumin was approximately 9) and she was restarted
on 100 mg qday. It was thought that has intrinsic slow clearance
of dilantin, as none of her other medications are known to
decrease dilantin clearance. Upon discharge her level was 3.7.
Her levels should be followed 2x/week.
Further neurologic workup for seizure included LP that was
unremarkable and MRI that showed no enhancing lesions, one small
area of DWI right thalamus without FLAIR correleate of unclear
significance. Radiology reported diffuse meningeal uptake, but
this was likely s/p LP effects. No EEG was performed.
2. Encephalopathy - Pt was initially very encephalopathic,
thought to be due to infection as well as dilantin toxicity. As
her pneumonia was treated and her dilatnin level was reduced,
she became markedly awake and lucid, and by discharge was
conversant and easily following commands.

ID:
1. Aspiration pneumonia - She had a LLL infiltrate on CXR,
leukocytosis to
13K, low grade temp (98.8 ax), she was started on levofloxacin
and flagyl and completed a 10 day course.  Her wbc was 6 upon
discharge and her lung exam was much improved. Her blood and
urine cultures were negative to date.

Pulm:
She was intubated on [**1-20**] for airway protection after the
multiple sedating medications she received for her seizure. She
was easily extubated at 6pm on [**1-21**]. On [**1-24**] she had an episode
of acute respiratory distress, her CXR and lung exam were
consistent with pulmonary edema and she was given IV lasix with
excellent response. She was started on a maintenance dose of
lasix for the remainder of her stay and this was discontinued
upon discharge.

Heme:
On admission, hct dropped from 36->29, repeat was 32 She does
not appear to be iron deficiency or anemia of chronic disease,
she does however have borderline low B12 and folate. Stool
guiaic's were negative. Her hct stayed around 28-29 for the
remainder of her stay.

Pain:
Continued fentanyl patch (for OA) to prevent withdraw, prn
tylenol.

FEN:
Pt was not PO'ing due to encephalopathy. Upon transfer,
nutrition consulted and plan for PICC placement for TPN made.
PICC was placed but it was only able to be placed peripherally,
therefore she was started on [**Month/Year (2) 32813**]. Electrolytes were followed
daily and her initial hyponatremia resolved. She also initially
had hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and hypokalemia, all of which
were stabilized with her [**Month/Year (2) 32813**]. On [**1-28**] she passed her
speech/swallow evaluation and an oral diet was st
