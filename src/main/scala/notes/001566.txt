History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 60258**] is a 46 year-old woman with history of advanced
interstitial lung disease, likely NSIP, chronic diastolic CHF,
DM, and chronic pain s/p MVA who presents with respiratory
failure. Patient unable to provide history, so HPI gathered from
OMR and sign-out. Patient was presumably in USOH on home O2 and
began to feel unwell over the past 7 days, with increased home
O2 requirement, fever, cough and sputum production. She saw her
PCP who treated her for presumed asthma exacerbation and started
the patient on a steroid taper (unclear dose). The patient did
not improve with this treatment regimen. At home, patient's
respiratory distress worsened and she called EMS who took her to
OSH ED. At OSH she was found to be hypoxic to 60-70's on RA, she
was treated with 750 mg levaquin, 125 mg solumedrol, 4 mg
morphine, duonebs and 12.5 mg benadryl, and transfered to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further care.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T AFeb P 116 BP 118/69 R 30 O2 sat.
85% 7L. Patient was given etomidate, succinylcholine and
vecuronium for intubation and sedated with propofol. She was [**Last Name (un) **]
given 1g IV ceftriaxone, 100 ucg fentanyl, and albuterol nebs.
Even on the ventilator, her O2 Sats were still in the 80's with
ABG 7.07/91/78 on 100% FiO2. After optimization of her
ventilator settings with low RR and high Vt, the patient's O2
sats improved to 90's. On the floor, the patient was intbuated
and sedated. IV access was challenging to obtain and a central
line was placed. Her vitals were HR 121 BP 128/59 RR 20 O2 Sat
98% on 100% FiO2.

disease. Her mother had COPD, died of respiratory failure,
father with cardiovascular disease. She had a sister
who died after a lung biopsy was performed. She states that
several of her family members may have had asbestos exposure
including the patient.

STUDIES:
[**2114-2-13**] CXR: Interval recurrence or progression of diffuse
alveolar
opacification in setting of known chronic interstitial lung
disease (NSIP/ILD leading diagnostic considerations per OMR).
This could be pulmonary edema or widespread pneumonia or
hemorrhage. Given the course consideration should also be given
to drug or toxin exposure exacerbating a preexisting reaction.

[**2114-2-14**] TTE:  Suboptimal image quality. Right ventricular cavity
enlargement with free wall hypokinesis. Normal left ventricular
cavity size and regional/global systolic function. Mild mitral
stenosis.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2110-4-9**],
the right ventricular findings are new and suggestive of
myocardial contusion. The severity of mitral stenosis has
increased. The severity of mitral regurgitation has declined
(may be due to tachycardia and suboptimal image quality).

[**2114-2-15**] EKG: Sinus rhythm and increase in rate as compared to
the previous tracing of [**2110-4-9**]. There is right axis deviation
and low limb lead voltage. There is now ST segment elevation in
leads V1-V3 with biphasic to inverted T waves in leads V1-V5,
more prominent as compared to the previous tracing of [**2110-4-9**].
The rate is increased. These findings are consistent with active
anterolateral ischemic process. Followup and clinical
correlation are suggested.

CTA Wet read [**2114-2-23**]:
No PE. Some consolidations/septal thickening suggestive of fluid
vs infection. Enlarged pulm art
