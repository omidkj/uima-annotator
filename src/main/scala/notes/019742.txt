Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 44522**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 74 y/o male with a h/o right RCC s/p nephrectomy ([**2121**])
with subsequent mets to lung s/p xrt and left mainstem bronchus
stenting ([**2141**]-[**2143**]) on study chemotx who presents with three
days of worsening shortness of breath, productive cough, and
fever.  He has been dyspneic for months now, but this began to
worsen over the past few days.  He was to be admitted today for
a blood transfusion, but in the [**Hospital **] clinic was found to be
tachycardic to 130, hypotensive to the 90's, and hypoxic to 80%
on 2l-nc with a temp of 96.6.  He was sent to the ED for
evaluation.
.
In the ED, he was in significant respiratory distress and
persistently hypoxic, so he was intubated.  Dopamine was begun
to support his bp.  Vanco/levo/flagly were initiated for
presumed pneumonia with sepsis.  A chest x-ray showed a left
mid-lung zone infiltrate and right mid-lung zone increased
interstitial markings, no pleural effusions, felt to be
consistent with his metastatic disease with a post-obstructive
pneumonia.


Past Medical History:
1.)Right renal cell carcinoma: diagnosed [**2121**] with nephrectomy
in [**2121**], no recurrence until [**2141**] when found to have metastatic
disease to lung, underwent xrt then left mainstem bronchial
stent with subsequent argon plasma coagulation distal to sent
for bleeding friable mucosa.  Currently on Sorafenib
experimental chemotherapy protocol, started cycle 2 [**8-24**];
CT-chest on [**7-21**] showed progression of disease.
2.)BPH
3.)Nephrolithiasis
4.)Peptic ulcer disease
5.)Squamous cell cancer
6.)Rheumatic fever as a child
7.)Bilateral cataract surgery

CXR [**9-7**]
IMPRESSION: Area of consolidation in the left mid lung zone with
prominent interstitial markings in the right mid lung zone. The
lung findings are consistent with the given history of
metastatic disease within the chest with post-obstructive
consolidation.

EKG [**9-7**]
Sinus tachycardia
Lateral ST-T changes may be due to myocardial ischemia
Repolarization changes may be partly due to rate
Low QRS voltages in limb leads

...............
Renal U/S
IMPRESSION:
1. Status post right nephrectomy with no definite mass or fluid
collection identified in the nephrectomy bed.

2. Left-sided extra renal pelvis without hydronephrosis or mass.

3. Incidental note is made of gallstones and sludge with
questionable gallbladder wall edema. Please correlate with
patient's symptoms. If there is clinical concern for
cholecystitis, this could be further evaluated with a dedicated
gallbladder ultrasound or with HIDA scan.

4. Right pleural effusion.
..............
[**2144-9-14**] CT Chest
IMPRESSION:

Significant interval progression of both metastatic renal cell
carcinoma and widespread intrathoracic infection as follows:

1. New large cavitary abscess involving the left lower
paraspinal pleural space, probably due to lower lobe
bronchopleural fistula.

2. Despite interval decrease in size of a large subcarinal mass
(that nevertheless infiltrates and probably occludes the
esophagus) and preserved patency of the stented, tumor-encased
left main bronchus, increasing right hilar adenopathy and
multiple new lung nodules represent increased metastatic burden.

3. Right upper lobe cavity and new multifocal consolidation
represents widespread infection.

4. Left bronchial stent is patent but tissue extending from its
proximal extent threatens to occlude the right main bronchus
..............
[**2144-9-16**] Bronchoscopy
INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:  Evaluation of airway patency.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  Lidocaine was instilled through
the Reverend [**Known lastname 53197**] endotracheal tube to suppress cough. The
patient received sedation per ICU protocol. The bronchoscope
was then inserted into the airways and airway inspection was
performed at the level of the carina. There was noticed to be
significant tumor burden, which was occluding right main stem
bronchus. The tumor was partially occluding the left main
stem bronchus orifice as well. The bronchoscope was then
navigated around the tumor in the left main stem bronchus
where the stent was identified, which was widely patent.
Distal airways were all patent. Bronchoscope was then
carefully navigated around the tumor into the right main stem
bronchus, which showed distal patency distal to the proximal
tumor occlusion.

FINDINGS:
1.  Tumor at the level of the carina.
2.  Tumor at the level of the carina obstructing right main
    stem bronchus approximately 80%.
3.  Tumor at the main stem carina obstructing the left main
    stem bronchus approximately 40% to 50%.
4.  Stent in left main stem bronchus widely patent.
5.  Distal airways, distal to proximal obstruction, patent.

SPECIMENS OBTAINED:  None.

COMPLICATIONS:  None.




Brief Hospital Course:
74 y/o male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma s/p left
mainstem stenting admitted with pneumonia and resultant sepsis
and respiratory failure.
.
#Respiratory failure - Initially the respiratory failure was
thought to be d/t either a CAP or postobstructive PNA, and the
patient was treated with levofloxacin, vancomycin, and flagyl
for possible aspiration PNA.  Gram stain showed GPC in prs,
chains, and clusters, as well as GNR's.  Respiratory culture
grew OP flora and moderate growth of beta streptococci, not
group B.  Metronidazole was stopped and the patient was treated
with levofloxacin and vancomycin for a total of 7 days.
Addidionally, the patient was wheezy on physical exam and was
given albuterol and atrobent nebulizers, as well as steroids in
the setting of hypotension and an inadequate [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim.  The
patient was difficult to wean from the vent, and the ventilator
readings suggested an element of resistance.  A CT scan was done
to assess progression of metastatic RCC, and found cancer had
progressed while on sorafenil study drug.  A bronchoscopy was
performed which showed 80% stenosis of right main and 40-50%
stenosis of left main.  A discussion was held with the patient's
sister, brother, and health care proxy, as well as the BC
communinty of priests, and it the decision was made to withhold
futher aggressive measures such
