Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2641**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath and edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
plasmapheresis/hemodialysis catheter placement

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 51 y/o F call-out from MICU after admission for likely
TTP. Please see excellent MSIII note for full details, but
briefly, pt had been in USOH being treated for foot cellulitis X
2weeks with Keflex. After 10 days Keflex, she began to note full
body non-raised rash, petechiae over arms, and larger
confluences on her legs. Keflex d/c'd, given Benadryl, and
started on doxycycline, which she said made her feel sick.  Pt
noted increased fatigued, [**Location (un) **] over her baseline, increasing SOB
with exertion.
.
In the ED, initial laboratories remarkable for anemia with a hct
of 25.7 and thrombocytopenia 85,000. BUN/Cr 83/10. She was
afebrile but hypertensive. Heme/onc and renal consulted. RBCs
and RBC casts in urine. Smear positive for schistocytes.
Plasmapheresis initiated for presumed TTP.  She was given nitro
paste, tylenol, solumedrol 500mg IV x1, and labetalol 400mg po
x1.  A R IJ pheresis catheter was placed.
.
In MICU, improvement in thrombocytopenia and elevated LDH s/p
pheresis and HD X3. She was hemodynamically stable and called
out to floor. Pt still oliguric.
.
On floor, she has no complaints exceot some mild fatigue on
exertion; however, she reports feeling better with improved
breathing and able to lie flat without SOB/orthopnea. She denies
any pain. ROS negative for recent diarrhea, no viral URIs, no
icterus or changes in the color of her skin or urine.  Denies
dysuria, chest pain, confusion, fevers, or ataxia.

IMAGING:
.
Peripheral Blood Smear (per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 20764**]: Prominent neutrophils
(mature); low platelets with some large forms and no platelet
clumps; occasional hypochromic red cells; on average 5 schistos
per HPF ([**4-10**] schistos noted in every field examined in the thin
area of the slide).
.
[**5-27**] CXR: mild CHF
.
Renal U/S:  no hydro; small to moderate bilateral pleural
effusions
.
ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular  hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No left ventricular outflow tract obstruction or
significant
valvular disease seen. Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with preserved systolic function.


Brief Hospital Course:
51 y/o female patient with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia,
thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure thought to be the
result of scleroderma renal crisis.
.
# Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia/Thrombocytopenia:
The final cause for [**Doctor First Name **] and Thrombocytopenia is still not
completely clear, though it was likely somehow associated with
her scleroderma renal crisis. Initially, pt was tought to have
TTP/HUS (she met 3 out of diagnostic 5 criteria) and was treated
by plasmapheresis. ADAMST13-actvity was low but at a level
significant enough to induce TTP; no ADAMST13-inhibitor was
found. Inciting factors were not fully clear, keflex was
considered initially.  Patient was screened for Cryoglobulin,
Anticardiolipin-Antibodies, Lupus-Anticoagulans, Hep A,B and C
serology, C3, and C4, which were all within normal limits.
Improvement in thrombocytopenia and elevated LDH s/p 1st cycle
of pheresis.  However, pheresis was discontinued as she did not
seem to be improving significantly with it.
Pt was found to have elevated [**Doctor First Name **] (1:1280--pre-plasmapheresis).
This along with notable skin findings and hx of Raynauds raised
suspicion for scleroderma with associated renal crisis.
.
# Scleroderma: This diagnosis was made primarily on clinical
finding: the pt's sclerodactaly, h/o Raynauds as wel as her (+)
[**Doctor First Name **].  Pt did not have (+) Anti-Scleroderma antibody
titers--however, this test is not specific.  Pt underwent skin
bx which, with given her clinical picture, was consistent with
scleroderma.  The pt was followed by both dermatology and
rheumatology, who are scheduled to see her as an outpatient.
She will need further evaluation as an outpatient to assess the
extent of organ involvement.  For instance, she will need a
repeat echo to assess PA pressure (her first echo could not
assess this) as well as chest CT.
.
# Renal failure:
Pt presented with acute renal failure that was likely due to
scleroderma renal crisis.  Per rheumatology, this scleroderma
renal crisis is typically characterized by acute onset of renal
failure with relatively [**Name2 (NI) 29734**] urine sediment, marked
hypertension, and can be complicated by microangiopathy. It also
is typically seen earlier on in the natural history of Diffuse
Systemic Sclerosis, consistent with her otherwise limited past
history.
Pt was also evaluated for idiopathic TTP, [**Last Name (un) **],B,C serologies,
C3, C4, SPEP, UPEP, ASO and ANti GBM, which were all within the
normal limits.  She did receive steroids on admission for
initial concern of GN--her admission UA showed RBC casts.
However, subsequent UA's did not show RBC casts, and, thus, the
steroids were discontinued.
Given the severity and persistence of her renal failure, the pt
was initiated on hemodialysis.  A peritoneal dialysis catheter
was also placed as the pt was expected to need long-term
dialysis.
The pt was started on captopril for treatment of presumed
scleroderma renal crisis.  ACE inhibitors are the cornerstone of
treatment of scleroderma induced renal disease. This was
evidenced by the positive effect it had on her BP. The pt was
kept on captopril (and not converted to lisinopril) as she
seemed respond better to the captopril than the lisinopril.
.
# HTN:
This was first time the patient was noticed to have hypertension
(as high as 170/110).  She was initially treated with metoprolol
but later switched to Captopril (as above), along with
Amlodipine and Valsartan.
.
# PVC:
Pt was found to have irregular rhythm and monomorphic PVCs.
Echocardiography revelaed left ventricular hypertrophy but the
reason for PVCs was not fully clear. While in hospital she was
monitored on Tele.
.
# Contact Dermatitis:
Pt developed ichty rash over her back. Symptoms got better upon
Savar cream and anti-allergic bedclothes.
.
# Basal Cell Carcinoma: pt to have f/u with derm for basal cell
lesions on back and chest.

Medications on Admission:
occasional Motrin or Tylenol
