Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 69321**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH for obtundation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
lumbar puncture [**2136-9-3**]

History of Present Illness:
82 yo F with h/o dementia, HTN, AS s/p AVR ([**Hospital1 18**]), vasculitis
on mycophenolate (Cellcept), admitted [**2136-8-20**] to [**Hospital3 2737**]
with VZV encephalitis (1.8 million copies on PCR) with course
c/b ARF and worsening obtundation.

Pt presented to OSH on [**8-20**] with increasing confusion and
weakness over 48 hours. On presentation she was nonverbal after
being able to speak earlier in the morning, and zoster rash was
noted on her right hip. She was started on acyclovir on
empirically on [**8-21**] and LP on [**8-22**] reportedly was postive for
VZV PCR, although report is not included. Patient apparently
improved initially, and MRI on [**8-27**] showed scattered lacunar
infarcts but was otherwise unremarkable. However, she developed
increased confusion on [**8-28**]. Repeat NCHCT on [**8-29**] was
unremarkable, and repeat LP was performed on [**8-30**], but again, I
have no records of the result. Patient's course was also c/b
ARF, with Cr increasing from 0.72 on [**8-26**] to 1.5 on [**8-30**]. Renal
US showed no hydronephrosis, and acyclovir was DC'd on [**8-30**].
However, Cr improved to 1.1 on [**8-31**] and acyclovir was restarted.
Unfortunately patient remained obtunded and was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

On the floor, patient is minimally responsive. She does open her
eyes to voice and intermittently attempts to vocalize, but ROS
is unable to be obtained.

Past Medical History:
-Hypertension
-Hyperlipidemia
-Aortic stenosis s/p AVR (21mm [**Company 1543**] Mosaic Ultra Porcine
Valve) [**2133-2-4**]
-Osteoarthritis
-Pending bilateral knee replacements
-Colectomy with h/o colostomy for bowel
obstruction/?diverticulitis


Social History:
She is a widow with 5 grown children. Lives with her son. She
does not smoke or drink.

Discharge Labs:

Imaging:
CXR [**2136-9-1**]: Left PICC line terminates in mid SVC.  Nasogastric
tube
terminates in the stomach.

MRI [**2136-9-2**]:
1. No definite acute intracranial abnormality; specifically,
there is no evidence of edema, slow diffusion or abnormal
enhancement to specifically support the apparently established
diagnosis of varicella zoster encephalitis.
2. No pathologic focus of enhancement, though sensitivity for
subtle cranial nerve enhancement (as may be seen with varicella
zoster infection) is severely limited.
3. Global, particularly central atrophy and extensive sequelae
of chronic small vessel ischemic disease with right basal
ganglionic chronic lacunes.
4. Unremarkable cranial MRA with no flow-limiting stenosis.
5. Fluid-opacification of the mastoid air cells, bilaterally, as
on the OSH CT dated [**2136-8-29**]; this should be correlated
clinically.

LENI [**2136-9-4**]: Deep vein thrombosis of both left posterior tibial
veins.

CTA chest [**2136-9-4**]:
1. Left lower lobe pulmonary embolus. Small left pleural
effusion with adjacent atelectasis.
2. Esophageal catheter with retained fluid and aeroselized
material in the proximal and mid esophagus. When clinically
feasible, upper GI study may be helpful.
3. Sequelae of aortic stenosis (now status post valve
replacement), including 4.1 cm ascending aortic dilation and
severe left ventricular hypertrophy. Extensive arterial
atherosclerotic
calcifications, including the coronary arteries.
4. Left PICC terminates at the top of the superior vena cava.

MRI head [**2136-9-11**]:
1. New subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage with
associated enhancement in the subarachnoid space, in the
interpeduncular cistern and right ambient cistern, as well as
areas of scattered enhancement in the leptomeninges in the
vermis and right frontal lobe. Abnormal signal in the pons and
left medulla with intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left
medulla. These findings could represent a combination of
hemorrhage as well as meningitis and encephalitis.

2. Slightly larger ventricular size when compared to the prior
examination of [**2133-2-7**]. While this could be due to global
cerebral volume loss, the possibility of communicating
hydrocephalus should be considered.

Microbiology:
+Varicella PCR on CSF at OSH (1.8 million copies -> <3000
copies)
[**2136-9-4**]: VZV PCR <500 copies, negative for HSV, negative [**Male First Name (un) 2326**]

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:82 yo F with h/o dementia, HTN, AS s/p AVR ([**Hospital1 18**]),
vasculitis on mycophenolate (Cellcept), admitted [**2136-8-20**] to
[**Hospital3 2737**] with VZV encephalitis (1.8 million copies on
PCR) with course c/b ARF and worsening obtundation. Her repeat
LP here showed increased WBC in CSF, so she was started on IV
bactrim given concern for listeria meningitis by the ID team.
Patient also developed DVT/PE during this hospitalization likely
due to her immobility. Her respiratory status worsened with
desaturation to 70s on room air, requiring a nonrebreather and
transfer to ICU. Patient was also found to have new subarachnoid
hemorrhage and decision was made to transition her to comfort
care. Her pain was managed with morphine and her secretion was
managed with scopolamine patch and prn
hyocyamine/glycopyrrolate.

# Obtundation: Unclear if this was related to the patient's VZV
meningoencephalitis, as she reportedly improved with tx at OSH,
but became and remained obtunded throughout this hospital stay.
Review of reports from OSH showed imaging without signficant
acute new process and la
