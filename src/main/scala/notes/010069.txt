[**7-18**] CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS
W/CONTRAST
1. Multiple minimally displaced right rib fractures likely
accounting for the patient's symptoms.
2. Focal outpouching of the infrarenal aorta, spanning a
distance of 1.3 cm which could represent a small pseudoaneurysm
caused by penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer. There is no
surrounding inflammatory change to indicate impending leak.
2. Moderately severe intra- and extra-hepatic biliary ductal
dilatation with no definite obstructing stone or mass is seen.
Calcification in the wall of the gallbladder concerning for a
porcelain type gallbladder. The contents of the gallbladder are
poorly assessed by CT.
3. 3-4 mm right upper [**Month/Day (4) 3630**] pulmonary nodules. If there are no
risk factors for malignancy, no additional followup is
recommended. If there is a prior history of malignancy, a
followup CT is recommended in 12 months to assess for interval
change.
4. Sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence for acute
inflammatory change.


Brief Hospital Course:
89 y.o. M with CAD, COPD, prostate CA s/p suprapubic catheter
placement in [**11-18**], and anemia, admitted on [**2188-7-19**] to Trauma
Surgery ICU s/p unwitnessed fall at his nursing home resulting
in a R sided rib fracture, transferred to Medicine Service for

# R rib fracture: s/p unwitnessed fall without LOC.  Patient was
originally in the trauma SICU for pain management and altered
mental status.  Imaging showed R rib fractures.  No surgical
intervention.  Head CT negative for any intracranial pathology.
Pain was controlled with medications, and he was transferred to
the surgical floor service.  Pain control with Tylenol,
lidocaine patch, and prn dilaudid.  PT followed patient and
recommended rehab.

# Hyponatremia: Pt was noted to have sodium of 127 on day of
transfer to Medicine service.  He appeared to be dry on exam,
and his hyponatremia may be [**3-15**] volume depletion.  His sodium
was corrected with IV NS.

# Hypertension: Initially, pt was treated with labetalol gtt,
and then he was converted to IV metoprolol and IV hydralazine on
the TSICU service.  Upon transfer to medicine service, IV
hydralazine was stopped, and he was switched to metoprolol by
mouth.  His BPs remained slightly elevated, so his metoprolol po
was titrated up.

# +UA: Urine culture >100,000 yeast.  However, per urology, do
not treat unless pt with fever.

# Delirium: Had one episode during time on surgical floor.  Pt
had a sitter for one night, and since then, he has been
