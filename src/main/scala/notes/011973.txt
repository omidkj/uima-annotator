Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4377**]
Chief Complaint:
fever, lethargy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
flexible bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
66 year old female, history of large B cell lymhoma s/p 6 cycles
R-CHOP, auto SCT in [**Month (only) 958**], h/o C diff, traumatic SDH s/p
evacuations, presents with one day of fevers, lethargy. Patient
has expressive aphasia at baseline but per family she is much
more lethargic than normal. No localizing symptoms except for
increasing diarrhea. Per patient's family, she had recent CDiff
infection (last documented here at end of [**Month (only) 205**]) and po
vancomycin was stopped on [**2158-10-5**].
.
She is followed in [**Hospital **] clinic by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] for SDH,
seizures and encephalopathy. Recent EEG on [**10-9**] showed cortical
irritability but not electrographic epileptogenic activity seen.

.
ED: Febrile to 103F. tachy 110-120s, BP stable, tachypneic 40s,
97%4L. Initially hypertensive then bp dropped to 100's systolic.
Given tylenol x 1, ondansetron x 1, vancomycin, flagyl,
levofloxacin. Given benadryl x 1. Oncology was notifed and
empiric solumedrol 50mg iv 1 given for stress dose (was on
prednisone as outpt so no [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim). EKG - < 1mm ST depressions
in V4-V6. CXR - no acute process. Diarrhea persisted in ED.

[**2158-1-17**]. Treatment course complicated by fever and neutropenia.
Supportive care with Neulasta and Aranesp given. PET at the end
of treatment showed no FDG-avid disease. Stem cell mobilization
performed [**2158-2-16**]. Anutologous stem cell transplant with BEAM
chemotherapy was done in [**2158-3-9**].
2. Intra-parenchymal hemorrhage and sub-dural hematoma s/p
evacuation x 4 following fall.
3. Bilateral pulmonary emboli and LLE DVT in [**10-14**]
4. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in [**11-14**]

IVC clot and thrombosis of left common iliac and left femoral
veins seen at that time)
6. C. difficile colitis [**2-15**] and [**3-15**]
7. Staphylococcus hand infection treated with incision and
drainage and subsequent antibiotics
8. Right toe Staphylococcus infection
9. Hypertension
10. Osteoarthritis
11. Peripheral neuropathy (attributed to her chemotherapy)
12. Tonsillectomy

.
ECG ([**10-14**]): Sinus tachycardia. Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave
changes.
CXR ([**10-14**]): No evidence of focal consolidation.
AXR ([**10-15**]): Limited examination. Non-obstructive bowel gas
pattern.
AXR ([**10-28**]): Unremarkable bowel gas pattern.
.
CT-abd/pelvis ([**10-15**]): 1.Pancolitis. 2.Unchanged IVC filter at
the level of the renal veins.
.
CT-chest ([**10-18**]): 1.New right apical area of ground glass
opacity as well as new right middle and right lower lobe areas
of peribronchial opacities and centrilobular nodules most likely
due to an acute infection. The nondependent location of some
opacities is atypical aspiration.  2.New small pericardial
effusion with questionable pericardial thickening. Correlation
with echocardiography may be helpful. 3.New tiny left pleural
effusion. 4.Unchanged multiple liver and renal cysts.
5.Unchanged appearance of IVC filter.
.
CT-head ([**10-18**]): No new intracranial hemorrhage is seen compared
to the prior examination.
.
Echocardiogram ([**10-19**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2158-5-26**], the findings are similar. Pulmonary artery systoic
pressure could not be estimated on the current study.
.
EEG ([**10-21**]): This is an abnormal portable EEG in the waking and
drowsy
states due to high voltage multifocal sharp waves arising
broadly over
the left hemisphere, but most notably over the left anterior
quadrant.
Some of the increased voltage amplitude over the left hemisphere
may be
due to breech rhythm, given the patient's history of craniotomy
and
skull defect in that region. The sharp wave discharges suggest
areas of
ongoing cortical irritability with potential for
epileptogenesis. No
rhythmic or repetitive discharges were noted. In addition, there
was
prominent and persistent mixed frequency slowing on the left
side,
consistent with ongoing subcortical dysfunction. No
electrographic
seizures were noted.
.
CT-chest ([**10-23**]): New diffuse ground-glass opacities with upper
lobe predominance, accompanied by septal and bronchovascular
thickening. In the setting of cough and fever, opportunistic
infection such as PCP should be considered. Differential
diagnosis includes hydrostatic pulmonary edema, pulmonary
hemorrhage, and drug reaction.
.
EEG ([**10-29**]): This is an abnormal portable EEG due to high
voltage
multifocal sharp wave discharges arising broadly over the left
hemisphere, suggestive of ongoing cortical irritability with
potential for epileptogenesis. No sustained or repetitive
discharges
were noted. The persistent mixed frequency slowing evident
on the left side is consistent with subcortical dysfunction on
the left,
while the more generalized delta frequency slowing, in the
setting of
the slow and disorganized background, suggests a mild to
moderate global
encephalopathy. The finding of an encephalopathic
