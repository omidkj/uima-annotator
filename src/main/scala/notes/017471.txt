Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p Cardiac arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
60 yo M with CAD, CHF EF 20% s/p ICD, IDDM, recent admission for
VT storm, who is transferred from OSH s/p cardiac arrest.

The history is passed down via multiple transitions of care, so
it is somewhat limited. Reportedly, the patient was found down
at rehab. It is thought that he was down for 15-20 minutes. He
was found pulseless, in asystole. He got 20-30 minutes of CPR en
route to [**Hospital6 5016**]. Intubation was attempted but was
unsuccessful pre-hospital, so put the patient on CPAP and
transferred to [**Hospital3 **]. At [**Hospital3 **], pulse was thready.
GCS was 3. Left tib I/O placed. Intubated.

On interrogation of the patient's ICD, it appears that the
patient had 3 episodes Vtach and 4 episodes of NSVT between 9:23
p.m. and 9:28 p.m. today. The sequence of events after that is
unclear, but after discussion with the EP fellow, it appears
that the patient received ATP and one shock before going into
PEA and then asystole.

The patient was med flighted to [**Hospital1 18**], where initial vital signs
were HR 80 BP 132/76 RR 23 Sat 100% on pressure support with
FiO2 100%. ABG was 7.38/45/270. CXR showed ET tube 2.7 cm above
the carina, Severe cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular congestion,
and pulmonary edema, large right pleural effusion. CT head and
neck showed no acute process (wet read).

Of note, the patient was recently admitted to the CCU from [**1-24**]
to [**1-30**] for VT storm. He was treated with amiodarone and
mexilitine and discharged to rehab.

Review of systems is unobtainable.

Studies:
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2183-2-1**] 1:23 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. In
particular, there is no intracranial hemorrhage. If there is
continued clinical concern for
parenchymal changes/acute infarction, MR can be considered if
not CI; however, pt. has a pacemaker and hence, if there is
continued clinical concern,a follwo up CT Head can be considered
to assess for short term stability. See details above.
2. Minimal maxillary sinus disease.

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2183-2-1**] 1:24 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute fracture or traumatic malalignment of the cervical
spine.
2. Multilevel severe degenerative changes throughout the
cervical spine,
resulting in mild-to-moderate spinal canal stenosis.

NOTE ON ATTENDING REVIEW:
A few linear lucencies are noted in proximity to the anterior
osteophyte at the antero-inferior aspect of C5 and C6. While
these may relate to orientation, subtle fractures associated
with the osteophytes cannot be excluded. ( Se 701b, im 37, 40)
Assessment of prevertebral soft tissue swelling is limited at
C5/6 and C6/7 levels due to intubation. As the aptient cannot
have MRI due to apcemaker in-situ, consider follow up with PXR
after spine consult to clear the spine and exclude fractures.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2183-2-1**] 1:29 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Endotracheal tube terminating 2.7 cm above the carina.
2. Severe cardiomegaly with severe pulmonary vascular congestion
and
pulmonary edema.
3. Large right pleural effusion.
4. Orogastric tube within the stomach.


Brief Hospital Course:
60yo M w/ CAD, CHF with an EF of 20%, s/p BiV ICD, DM, AF on
coumadin, recent admission for VT storm, now readmitted to CCU
s/p cardiac arrest.
.
# Neuroprotection s/p cardiac arrest: Arrived with GCS of 3 and
Arctic Sun protocol initiated.  Poor prognosis was discussed
with aunt, [**Name (NI) **]. She was understanding of patient's clinical
status and did not want escalation of care. Code status was
changed to DNR/DNI. Patient was rewarmed to better assess
neurologic function. Neurologic status continued to be poor and
the patient was terminally extubated.
.
# RHYTHM: Precipitant for event was VT -> PEA -> asystole. A-V
paced rhythm on admission.  For anti-arrythmics, he was started
on amiodarone drip + mexiletine.
Warfarin was continued for atrial fibrillation.
.
# Blood pressures: Metoprolol, lisinopril, spironolactone, and
lasix all held in setting of hypotension/cardiogenic shock.
