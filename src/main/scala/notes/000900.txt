Brief Hospital Course:
59yo M with HCV cirrhosis, s/p renal/pancreas transplant a/w
ARF.
Initially admitted with ARF (Cr 3.3 today) s/p renal transplant
in [**2108**], creatinine rising from 0.8 one year ago, worsening over
the past year. This is likely hepatorenal syndrome. Transplant
renal U/S with lack of diastolic flow, a non-specific finding.
Started hemodialysis using temporary dialysis catheter
(Successful placement of temporary right internal jugular double
lumen dialysis catheter on [**2112-6-2**]).
It was felt that this was Hepatorenal syndrome and he was
started on midodrine, octreotide and albumin.
[**Date Range 13808**], awaiting transplant, EGD with no varices [**2112-3-2**]. Last
paracentesis [**2112-6-1**], no SBP, though has previous h/o SBP. He
was continued on lactulose, rifaxamin, ursodiol, levofloxacin
for SBP ppx.
In addition he continued his immunosuppression of tacrolimus and
prednisone as well as Bactrim. He has not required insulin since
his pancreas transplant in [**2108**].
He had a very poor nutritional status with low Na diet with
ensure, tube feeding for supplement, this was continued from
home. The [**Last Name (un) **]-intestinal tube was replaced on [**2112-6-6**].
Stress MIBI was performed on [**6-7**] in anticipation of liver
transplant, EF 67% Other blood serologies had been previously
reported.
On [**6-10**] the patient was able to undergo Orthotopic liver
transplant. Of note the patient was HBcAb positive, received
10,000 units HBIG intra-op in additon to routine induction
immunosuppression. He was started on Vanco and Zosyn for
presumed UTI (10-100,00 yeast in urine)
Please see the operative note for surgical details. OLT from
when the clamps were removed, there was excellent flow and good
thrill through the artery. The liver began making bile and its
color improved. There was a size discrepancy at the bile duct,
recipient bile duct was oversewn. He received CVVH while in the
OR
Patient followed pathway post-op, was extubated on POD 1 and
transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 10 on POD 2.
He continued to make excellent progress, liver function tests
improved as did renal function. He did not require hemodialysis
following the transplant.
He received 5000 units HBIG daily for 5 days post op. HBsAb was
>450 daily.
He was continued on tube feeds, his ND tube was exchanged early
in the hospitalization. He will continue tube feeds at home,
having only a fair appetite.
He did have an insulin requirement while hospitalized, and will
go home on insulin at least in the short term. Seen by [**Last Name (un) **]
during the hospitalization.
He is ambulating using a walker.
