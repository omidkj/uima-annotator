Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2932**]
Chief Complaint:
COPD exacerbation complicated by afib with RVR requiring
intubation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
78 yo male with COPD who was seen in the ED a few days ago and
sent home presents in respiratory distress, hypoxic. Three days
ago, he presented to the ED with 5 days of diffuse wheezing on
exam. He got solumedrol, nebulizers, CXR was clear. Initial room
air sats were 89% RA at rest, improved to 93% RA in the morning
with desat with ambulation to 89-90%. During this ED visit, he
was able to walk througout entire ED with only minimal
desaturation, which is improved over even baseline (uses scooter
at home). He was diagnosed with a URI and was discharged on a
Prednisone taper and when he presented today, he was on day #3
of his prednisone taper. He presented 12/4/6 with one day of
diffuse wheezing, dyspnea, and a dry cough. In the ED, he
received Combivent nebs, Solumedrol, and azithromycin. His
initial gas on room air was 7.39/79/56/42; Bipap was started and
his gas improved to 7.43/54/93/37. He mentated well throughout
and tolerated Bipap well initially. However, he began to breathe
faster with increased use of accessory muscles; he was
subsequently intubated. Initial vent settings were TV 400, RR
10, FiO2 100%, PEEP 5. He was given 100mcg fentanyl and 1mg
ativan for sedation. His ABG after intubation was
7.16/85/499/32.

Approximately ten minutes later, his systolic blood pressure
dropped to 95/60 and his rhythm was atrial fibrillation with
rapid RVR. Rate control was attempted with 0.5mg IV digoxin but
was unsuccessful. He then got IV diltiazem 5 mg x 2 that brought
his rate to 120's with stable pressure. However, his blood
pressure then dropped to 70's systolic. He was transiently on
phenylephrine (10ug/min to 40ug/min) and a received a total of 5
L normal saline. A CTA was negative for PE and a bedside echo
showed some hypokinesis in the anterior wall. He was paralyzed
with 10mg vecuronium and 150 micrograms of fentanyl as he was
dissyncronous with vent and was thought to be autopeeping.
Following this his blood pressure increased to systolic 160's.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on admission, he was moving all fours and had a
stable blood pressure. An arterial line was placed. BP 124/58,
HR 71, Sat 100%.

[**11-22**] EKG: Sinus tachycardia with frequent PACs, rsr' in lead V1
ST-T wave changes, Since previous tracing, A-V association is
now present, inferior Q waves less apparent Clinical correlation
is suggested

[**11-22**] CTA chest:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism with slightly malpositioned
endotracheal tube and hyperinflated cuff, tip approximately 2 cm
above carina. These findings were discussed with the ordering
physician, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], on date of exam shortly after exam
acquisition.
2. 6mm left lower lobe pulmonary nodule with bilateral likely
pleural-based soft tissue densities. The pleural lesions appear
stable when compared to prior chest x- rays however in
combination with nodule and patient's history, a 3- month
followup non- contrast chest CT is recommended.
3. Bilateral emphysematous changes with nonspecific right and
left lower lobe patchy pulmonary opacities which may represent
areas of pneumonitis or early pneumonia.
4. Air pockets adjacent to subclavian [**Last Name (un) 21644**] bilaterally,
correlate clinically if line placement was attempted.

[**11-22**] echocardiogram: The left atrium is normal in size. There is
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
severe hypokinesis to akinesis of the basal one-half of the
anterior septum and anterior wall, and of the basal inferior and
inferolateral walls. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve is not well seen, but color Doppler
interrogation reveals no significant aortic  regurgitation. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.

[**11-30**] CT Abdomen/pelvis with contrast: .Partial or early small
bowel obstruction with a transition point in the terminal ileum.
No obvious source of obstruction is identified. Small amount of
free intraperitoneal fluid. Diverticulosis without evidence of
acute diverticulitis. Multifocal aspiration or atypical
pneumonia in the lung bases. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Unchanged nonobstructing 3 mm stone in the right kidney.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit,
where he was managed for COPD exacerbation (steroids),
congestive heart failure, and superimposed MRSA (broad spectrum
antibiotics). He was intially tolerating a combination of Bi-PAP
and FM after extubation [**2135-11-27**], but required re-intubation
after acute desaturation on [**12-1**] thought to be secondary to a
mucous plug. He also had dark guaiac positive bowel movement on
[**2141-12-3**] and again on [**12-5**] with Hct drop. He received 3
units PRBC's on [**12-4**]; GI was consulted and recommended PPI
therapy without invasive intervention in view of his respiratory
status. CT abdomen showed partial/early SBO on admission which
subsequently resolved per serial examinations. The patients
atrial fibrillation with RVR was difficult to control required
multiple nodal blocking agents including diltiazem gtt,
metoprolol and digoxin. In the setting of this, he developed
demand ischemia. The cardiology service was consulted, who
recommended medical therapy in view of his ongoing multiple
comorbidities.  The [**Hospital 228**] health care proxy and primary care
physician met with the ICU team and, in view of pt's multiple
ongoing co-morbidities and poor prognosis, decided to pursue
comfort measures only. The patient was transferred to the
general medical floor on the evening of [**2135-12-8**] and was
pronounced dead on [**2135-12-9**] at 11:15 a.m. His health care proxy
was notified, who declined autopsy.
