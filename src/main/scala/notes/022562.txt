Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 398**]
Chief Complaint:
GI bleeding and hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 67 yo F with h/o COPD (FEV1 0.6), CHF(EF 20-25%), MVR, CRI,

transferred to ED from rehab w/ hypotension (sbp 70s), gross
hematuria, and GI bleed w/ HCT 23. She was recently admitted to
MICU [**Date range (3) 100589**] w/ GI bleed on EGD [**2116-4-17**] showed a few
non-bleeding erosions and 1 angioectasia in duodenal bulb.
Angiography revealed no source of bleeding, although occlusion
of left renal artery and inferior mesenteric artery was noted as
well as focal moderate stenosis of SMA (which was stented).
Abdominal CT [**2116-4-19**] was negative for retroperitoneal bleed.
Although no source of her bleeding was identified, given
stabilization of her HCT, heparin gtt was restarted [**2116-4-28**];
coumadin was restarted [**4-30**]. She did not have further
significant GI bleed. She was initally intubated [**2116-4-17**] for
airway protection/EGD. Given failed extubation (attributed to
CHF and baseline severe COPD), she underwent tracheostomy/PEG
placement on [**4-29**]. Her hospital course was further complicated
by acute on chronic renal failure believed pre-renal in etiology
(only partially responsive to volume resuscitation), GNR
bacteremia (pan-sensitive Serratia) treated w/ 10 day course of
ceftazidime, MRSA in sputum s/p 10 day course of vancomycin, and
adrenal insufficiency (discharged on Prednisone/florinef). She
also had hematuria on [**4-30**] after foley reinsertion in setting of
elevated PTT, which incompletely resolved with continuous
bladder irrigation prior to transfer to rehab [**2116-5-1**].
*
She continued to have hematuria at the vent facility, which did
not clear despite bladder irrigation. She was also noted to have
several episodes of BRBPR (amt not recorded in transfer
materials). Her coumadin and heparin gtt were held since
[**2116-5-4**]. She received 2u PRBC on [**5-3**] and 2u PRBC on [**5-5**]. HCT
[**2116-5-6**] was noted to be 23.1. On the day of admission her sbp
70s, she received 2 u PRBC and hydrocortisone 100 mg IV X 1
prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. Of note,
there was a verbal report that CXR from [**5-6**] (no written report
available) had free air noted under diaphragm.
*
In ED, HR 70 (V-paced), sbp 80s; transfused 2u PRBC, 1 L NS,
levo/vanco/flagyl. PEG tube lavage (-), gauiac dk green gauiac
(+). Currently, the pt is moving nonpurposefully, not responsive
to voice, sternal rub, and not following commands.

Brief Hospital Course:
On admission surgery and urology and GI were consulted for
possible sources of bleed. She was deemed not a surgical
candidate given her very high operative risk of mortality. The
likely differential of her hematuria includes trauma by Foley,
neoplasm, infection (although less likely to cause gross
hematuria), renal infarcts/thrombosis. Bladder appears to be
significantly distended on CT scan. She was conservatively
managed initially by urology with continous bladder irrigation
which produced significant amounts of clots.Urology planned
cystoscopy when patient is much more stable.  Regarding possible
GI bleed, she was initially made NPO for possible EGD by GI
consult. There was also concern that she had free air in her
abdomen with sources from gastrointestinal perforation vs
bladder perforation secondary to blood clot obstruction. Also of
note, she was found elevated cardiac enzyme likely in the
setting of increased demand.

However, her very low mental status in the face of hypotension,
hematuria, demand ischemia, possible GI bleed lead to discussion
with the family regarding the very low likelihood of meaningful
recovery for this patient. After extensive discussion between
the ICU team and the family, her code status was changed from
full code to comfort measure only. She was started on a morphine
drip and her ventilator via trach tube was stopped after her
family had a chance to have last moments together.
She passed on [**5-8**]
