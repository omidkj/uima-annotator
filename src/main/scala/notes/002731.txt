Chief Complaint:
Right upper quadrant pain with jaundice s/p PTCA stent placement

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2169-3-3**] cholecystectomy, common bile duct excision, left hepatic
lobectomy, Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy, repair of right
hepatic artery with inferior mesenteric vein interposition and

History of Present Illness:
This patient is a 48 year old male with a past medical history
of hepatits C and herniated lumbar disc who was found to have
biliary obstruction during work-up for right upper quadrant pain
with jaundice. The patient underwent PTCA on [**2169-2-17**] with
dilation of a stricture ant the confluence o fthe right and left
hepatic ducts. The stricture was biopsied and showed chronic
infalmmation with fibrosis. The patient now presents for hepatic
resection with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and was taken to the
operating room on [**2169-3-3**] for a cholecystectomy, common bile
duct excision, left hepatic lobectomy, Roux-en-Y
hepaticojejunostomy. The case was complicated by hepatic artery
dissection and required repair of right hepatic artery with
inferior mesenteric vein interposition and graft. The patient
tolerated this procedure well but was transferred to the PACU
intubated and in guarded condition. The patient was admitted to
the SICU, where, after a prolonged hospital course, he expired
on [**2169-5-6**]. The hospital course will be dictated by systems.

Neuro:
Patient remained sedated post-operatively. His pain was
controlled with morphine. POD 7, PO pain medications were given.
Following return to OR for wound dehisence, post-op pain was
controlled with morphine. POD [**9-4**] patient noted to be anxious
but responsive with well-controlled pain. POD 15/8 patient
attempted to get out of bed to go to bathroom unassisted. Got
dizzy and fell. No neurological sequelae from fall. POD 16/9/1
morphine stopped, dilaudid started for improved pain control.
POD 23/16/8 began propofol wean to off in attempt to extubate.
When re-intubated that day, patient was again sedated. POD
41/34/27/2 propofol drip weaned, patient started on fentanyl
drip and haldol prn.

Cardiovascular:
Patient was tachycardic immediately post-op, and was felt to be
septic secondary to pancreatitis. He was placed on neosynephrine
to maintain blood pressure. He was monitored carefully and
agressively hydrated post-operatively. MAP was kept >65. On
post-op day #2, the patient was taken off pressors. POD 6 beta
blockade started for mild hypertension/tachycardia. POD [**10-6**]
sustained tachycardia w/o changes on EKG noted, likely secondary
to anxiety and pain. POD [**1-8**] tachycardia noted to be improving
with stable BP's. POD 15/8 patient noted to be tachycardic after
slipping and falling. Moved to SICU and became
tachycardic/hypotensive. Taken to OR on [**2169-3-18**] emergently for
GI bleeding. Right hepatic artery ligated in OR. POD 16/9/1
patient noted to be tachycardic with stable BP. Patient
continued to remain tachycardic thereafter. On POD 38/31/23
patient became hypotensive. neosynephrine started to maintain
blood pressure. POD 46/39/31/7 TTE demonstrates no evidence of
vegetations in heart. POD 48/41/33/9 blood pressure begins to
decrease. Beta-blockade held. POD 53/46/38/14 patient found to
be hemodynamically unstable, unresponsive to fluid boluses,
developing signs of shock. Pressors started. POD 63/56/48/24
patient becomes hemodynamically unstable. He is made CMO by his
family and expires on [**2169-5-6**].

Respiratory:
The patient was initially supported by ventilator immediately
after surgery. This was weaned and patient extubated by POD#3.
Incentive spiromety encouraged. POD 7/0, extubated after return
to OR for wound dehisence. POD [**11-6**] patient noted to have some
respiratory distress though responsive to diuresis. POD 18/5
noted to be short of breath and diaphoretic shortly before
emergent return to OR [**2169-3-18**] for GI bleeding. Patient remained
intubated after procedure. Attempted to wean starting POD
17/10/2. POD 22/15/7 CPAP trials began but failed. POD 23/16/8
sedation weaned and on POD 24/17/9 patient self-extubated. Later
that day, due to increased work of breathing and fatigue,
patient was re-intubated. Daily chest xrays continued to
demonstrate atelectasis with pulmonary edema. POD 28/21/13 CT
guided thoracocentesis performed due to difficulty weaning from
vent. POD 39/32/25 patient undergoes open tracheostomy after
failing to wean from ventillatory support. POD 54/47/39/15
patient in septic shock with large right plerual effusion found
on CXR. This is tapped via ultrasound guidance. Patient remains
ventilator dependent until death on [**2169-5-6**].

Gastrointestinal:
The patient was kept NPO immediately after surgery with T-tubes
to gravity. Total bilirubin noted to be 3.4. On post-op day #2,
ultrasound showed patent hepatic artery and vein. POD 4
ultrasound repeated and showed right anterior portal vein
reverlsal of flow. LFT's checked and found to be improving with
exception of stable bilirubin at 5.2. Patient taken to OR on
[**2169-3-10**] for wound dehisence. On examination, found to have
intraluminal clot, dilated stomach and proximal small bowel,
marked ascited and approx. 500cc old hematoma. Total bilirubin
noted to be 4.1. GI service consulted. POD [**10-6**], noted to be
stable, sips started. POD [**11-6**], small amount of BRBPR, passing
flatus. POD [**12-8**], ultrasound noted to show patent hepatic flow.
POD [**1-8**] through POD 17/4, continued GI bleeding. POD 18/5 taken
to OR on [**2169-3-18**] for continued GI bleeding. Right hepatic artery
ligated in OR. Total bilirubin noted to rise from 3.2 to 6.5 on
POD 19/6/1. On POD 21/14/6, CT scan obtained, showing moderate
amount of intra-abdominal ascites, patchy areas of nonperfusion
involving segments 5, 6 and 8 of the liver, and a patent right
portal vein. PTCA drain placed to decompress the right biliary
duct system. Total bilirubin noted to fall from 6.5 to 5.9. POD
25/18/10 CT abdomen failed to demonstrate evidence of
intra-abdominal infection. Stable amount of ascites. Patent
poral vein noted. Total bilirubin noted to be 5.5. POD 34/27/19

tube placed. POD 42/36/28/3 CT scan performed, showing little
change in the appearance of multiple fluid collections and
drains. Total bilirubin noted to be 9.1. POD 44/37/29/5 Total
bilirubin found to be 10.7. Cholangiogram performed, which
showed existing right biliary internal external drain in place

leak seen at the anastomotic site. POD 45/38/30/6 Tube feeds
advanced to goal. Total bilirubin found to be 13.1. POD
