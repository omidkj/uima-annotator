exacerbations and intubation, who presents with SOB and CP which
was different than baseline. He describes the CP as left
stabbing subcostal pain with point location. The pain has been
going on intermittently for 3 weeks but has become worse. His
SOB lasts all the time while his CP is intermittent and lasts a
few seconds. He denied n/v/f/c/d/c. He reports weening his
prednisone down at home and currently was on 30mg daily.
.
In the ED, his initial VS were initially BP 130/p, HR 112, RR 33
O2sat 96% on NRB. He was given Combivent neb, SoluMedrol 125 x1,
ASA 162mg, Levaquin 750mg IV x1 (he refused), Nitro SL x1, and
Percocet x1. His EKG was unchanged but showed low voltage. A
quick bedside ultrasound showed no pericardial effusion in the
ED. He was weened off the NRB to nasal cannula at 5L with sats
around 95%. He had a CXR and CTA chest.

Brief Hospital Course:
66 yo M with PMH of COPD with FEV1 0.44L (18%) on 4L home o2,
CAD s/p NSTEMI in [**2101**], HTN, chronic back pain who presents with
SOB and chest pain and likely COPD exacerbation.
.
# COPD: he presented with SOB which is likely his COPD
exacerbation. His CXR and CTA chest showed no signs of
consolidation. He is currently doing well on nasal cannula. He
still has bilateral wheezing. No obvious signs of infection.
Antibiotics aside from his home Bactrim were not needed.
Patient to continue on home steroids and inhalers, and oxygen.
Patient also to continue on BIPAP at night [**12-9**] with 4L oxygen.
Patient will need interval PFTs done as an outpatient.

.
# leukocytosis: Likely steroid induced.  No signs of infection
at this time.
.
# tachycardia: Thought to be related to nebulizer treatments as
he does not appear dry on exam. Monitored on tele without event.

.
# chest pain: Ruled out for MI.  Thought to be costochondritis
and given NSAIDs.
.
# CAD s/p NSTEMI in past: He noted chest pain on admission which
has since resolved.  Cardiac enzymes were negative and continued
on home ASA, statin, CCB.  Patient not currently on an ACE.
.
# steroid induced hyperglycemia: monitor FS and use humalog SC
