                      ADDENDUM

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This an addendum to the hospital course
from [**11-27**] until discharge while on the Medicine
Service.

Infectious disease:  On transfer to the Medicine Service on
[**11-27**], the patient had a number of active issues.  These
included infectious disease, history of MSSA, sepsis,
bacteremia, and infected pacer wires.  The patient is on
Nafcillin.  Cultures have been negative, and the patient has
been afebrile.  The Nafcillin will be continued for six weeks
until [**2196-1-6**].  Approximately 2-3 weeks into the
treatment, the patient should have a gallium scan to assess
for other sources of infection.  This should be performed the
week of [**12-7**].

Cardiac:  The patient has congenital complete heart block.
In the surgery, he had an epicardial pacer system put in
place which is atrial sense ventricular paced.  This system
will be maintained for approximately four weeks.  At that
point, the patient should return to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of
Electrophysiology who will place a permanent pacemaker.  This
will be done in early [**Month (only) 404**], approximately the week of
[**12-26**] or 6th.

The patient has an ejection fraction of approximately 20%.
He is being maintained on Lopressor 12.5.  Captopril 12.5 mg
t.i.d. will be started for its ................. benefit as
well.

Renal:  The patient has had increased creatinine over the
last few days, most likely secondary to aggressive diuresis.
The patient was started on Aldactone 50 mg p.o. q.d. and
Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.  This diuretic regimen will decrease
the amount of urine outpatient and take off the edema post
surgery more gently.  This is also a better regimen for this
patient, because he has cirrhosis.

GI:  The patient has cirrhosis.  Tylenol and alcohol should
be avoided in this patient.




Hematologic:  The patient has a left upper extremity deep
venous thrombosis.  The patient is currently being maintained
on Heparin.  He will be transitioned over to Coumadin with a
target INR between 2 and 3.

Pulmonary:  Currently the patient has decent oxygen
saturation on room air with a respiratory rate of 18.  His
pulmonary status will continue to be watched for congestive
heart failure fluid overload causing pulmonary edema.

Additional areas of treatment:  Pain control, and disposition
is likely to [**Hospital 3058**] rehabilitation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Over the next subsequent five days until
[**2195-12-2**].

Infectious Disease:  The patient remained afebrile.  His
white count trended down.  He was continued on the Nafcillin
and will do so until [**2196-1-6**].  A gallium scan is
planned in the future.

Electrophysiology:  The epicardial pacing system was in place
and working without any complications.  He will return in
four weeks in early [**Month (only) 404**] for a permanent pacemaker
placement.

Cardiac:  Ejection fraction of 20%.  The patient was started
on Captopril 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d.  He tolerated this regimen.
The Lopressor 12.5 mg was continued as well.  A repeat
echocardiogram was not performed.  A future echocardiogram
may show recovery of the patient's cardiac contractility.
The patient does not have significant coronary artery
disease, and this most likely represents a toxic process
secondary to alcohol.

GI:  The patient was placed on Aldactone 50 mg p.o. q.d. and
a regimen of Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. and 20 mEq of Potassium
Chloride per day.  This regimen is slowly decreasing the
patient's edema.  The patient remained without jaundice, and
his total bilirubin and LFT tests remained normal.

Hematologic:  The patient was started on Coumadin and was
discharged on Coumadin 7.5 mg p.o. q.d.

Pulmonary:  The patient required no further oxygen and was
had a good oxygen saturation on room air without any more
problems.

Pain:  Controlled easily with rare Oxycodone and occasional
ibuprofen.  The patient was also maintained on Protonix for
prophylaxis.  Physical therapy screening deemed the patient
to be a candidate for [**Hospital 3058**] rehabilitation, and he will

be discharged most likely on [**12-2**], and if not, then
early in the morning on [**12-3**] to [**Hospital 3058**]
rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d., Lopressor
12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d., Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d., KCl 20 mEq p.o.
q.d., Nafcillin 2 g IV q.4 until [**2196-1-11**], Folate 1
mg p.o. q.d., Multivitamin per day, Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.,
Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d., Coumadin 7.5 mg p.o. q.d.,
Oxazepam 15-30 mg p.o. q.6 hours p.r.n., Oxycodone 5 mg p.o.
q.4 hours p.r.n., Captopril 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. Aldactone 50
mg p.o. q.d.

PLANS:  Suture removal in approximately one week, the week of
[**12-7**].  Gallium scan in the same week, [**12-7**],
looking for other sources of infection, including abscesses.
The patient should also see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] the week of [**2194-12-28**], for permanent pacemaker placement.  The patient
should also follow-up with his primary care physician after
discharge from the [**Hospital 3058**] rehabilitation stay.
