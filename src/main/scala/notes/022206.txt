Brief Hospital Course:
89 yo female, h/o CAD, DM, presenting s/p fall at home, with
Influenza c/b bilateral PNA.  After transfer out of MICU patient
initially improved with addition of levo/flagyl.  Influenza
positive but also question of bacterial superinfection and then
question of aspiration.  Resolved NSTEMI believed secondary to
demand ischemia.  Oxygen titrated down.  Patient also with new
afib that initially was though secondary to strain but then
persisted.  Started on beta blocker and aspirin (decision to
anticoagulate deferred).  Seen by neurosurgery who recommended
continuing keppra and rec wearing collar when willing.  Patient
had swallow evaluation and failed completely.  Rec NG tube which
patient declined.  Patient had previously had PEG tube after
previous fall and said she would rather have replacement of PEG
tube.  Attempt made by surgery team 8 days post [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] transfer
(and off influenza precautions) and unable to do secondary to
previous scarring; NG tube placed under sedation.  Patient did
ok previous day, still some increased oxygen req and confusion
post sedation.  2 nights afterwards patient found to have
dropping blood pressure and bradycardia.  Attempts made to
resusciate with fluids and then nebs but patient clearly
DNR/DNI.  Patient expired.  Family contact[**Name (NI) **].
