History of Present Illness:
This is a 52 y/o male with h/o active HIV and HCV, ascites, h/o
hepatic encephalopathy, who presented to the ED tonight with c/o
abdominal pain x one day. He reports sharp, diffuse epigastric
pain that is worsened with movement, no radiation. +nausea, one
episode of emesis tonight. Last BM earlier today and normal. No
BRBPR/melena per patient, no hematemesis. In the ED, the

SaO2 97%/RA. He received Levo/Vanc/Flagyl and 4 L NS with
marginal response in BP, requiring initiation of levophed. Labs
were notable for an initial lactate of 7, WBC of 3.3 with a left
shift and bandemia of 50%.
.
Of note, the patient was just admitted at [**Hospital1 18**] from
[**Date range (3) 53326**] with shortness of breath and lactate of 4.6. His
dyspnea resolved spontaneously without any intervention and had
negative imaging at the time, including an abd u/s demonstrating
only mild ascites not amenable for non-u/s guided tap. His
lactate was 2.3 on discharge; however it was unclear what the
etiology of his elevated lactate was as no obvious source of
infection. Prior to this admission, he was here for one day on
[**2162-9-15**], admitted for SOB NOS, which resolved and allowed pt to
be d/c'd the same day. He was also admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2162-9-9**]
for dyspnea, felt to be [**3-18**] ascites. He had a therapeutic
paracentesis that day, received aldactone/albumin/laisx, and was
discharged that same day with planned follow-up in liver [**Month/Day (2) **].
His tap was negative for any SBP with negative cultures.
