Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5552**]
Chief Complaint:
Cough, Fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
79 year old Male w/ h.o. metastatic bronchoalveolar Carcinoma w/
multiple recent PNAs p/w fever to 104.3, cough on 2L-6L. O2sats
93% max.

Unfortunately pt is a poor historian. He states that over the
past few weeks he has noted intermittent low grade fevers,
however yesterday his fevers were notably higher with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1131**]
of 104. It is unclear if his cough also started yesterday or
whether it has been several weeks, he is able to state that it
is mostly non-productive and the only expectorant he sees is
white. He also endorses chronic rhinorrhea but denies any recent
change. 2 days ago he noted some pleuritic chest pain over his
rt lower thoracic side which resolved within 24 hours. He did
receive the H1N1 and Influenzae vaccine last year. He wanted to
manage this at home but spiked to 104 again so went to the ED.

Of note pt was recently diagnosed with bronchoalveolar carcinoma
in the Spring and started his first round of pemetrexed
chemotherapy on [**2160-12-9**]. His next cycle is this Tuesday. He has
noted a left foot drop which started several weeks ago and is
being followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**].

In the ED, initial vitals were noted to be T97.5, HR 73, BP
132/88, RR 20, Sat 91%. Pt's lab data was notable for a
leukocytosis with a left shift. Bld cultures were drawn and the
pt was given Cefepime 2gm IV per heme-onc recs. A CXR was
notable for new RLL infiltrate versus effusion. U/A was
unremarkable He was noted to be saturating low 80s on 2L of
oxygen and was thus increased to 6L and then 50% Facemask where
his sat was noted to improve to mid 90s.

Last set of vital signs prior to transfer were HR 72, BP 120/83,
99% on FM. On arrival to the floor pt was switched to shovel
mask with hydration saturating 98-100% with no signs of
accessory muscle use.

On transfer, O2sats higg 90s on 3L. Looks fine per report.
Crackles RLL with egophony. R strabismus longstanding, L foot
drop thought [**1-27**] to decreased fat pad over peroneal nerve per
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**]. Gait ataxic, PT consulted. Otherwise neuro exam ok.
BAC can proceed to PNA-like carcinona. Has been afebrile. D/c'd
cefepime; on vanc, ctx, and levofloxacin because ICU admit and
recent hospitalizations. Metformin held for ?imaging; had been
hypoglycemic on arrival (?Po intake) but FSG fine since. C- and
L/S-spine MRI to evaluate for spondylosis.

Radiology
CXR - Again noted is the right lower lobe consolidation which
has been seen on multiple prior examinations and consistent with
known bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma. There may be a slight
increase in the density of the consolidation. There may have
been interval development of a right pleural effusion. As such,
a superimposed infection cannot be entirely excluded, but
is felt unlikely. Correlate clinically. If indicated, chest CT
may be of benefit to provide further details.

Brief Hospital Course:
79 y/o male with recent diagnosis of BAC, fever, multiple
episodes of PNA p/w hypoxia likely recurrent PNA.

# Pneumonia - Pt was notably hypoxic in the ED with a
requirement of 50% on facemask.  He was initially admitted to
the ICU, where he was treated with vanco, cefepime and
levofloxacin. He improved with this treatment and ultimately was
transferred to the OMED floor service.  On the floor, he was
continued on levofloxacin alone and continued to improve.  He
was discharged home to complete a 14 day course of levofloxacin.

# Bronchoalveolar Carcinoma - On admission, the patient's next
cycle of chemotherapy was due in 4 days.  His chemotherapy was
held considering his current illness.  He was instructed to
follow-up with his oncologist as an outpatient.

# Foot Drop - The patient has a known foot drop and is followed
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**].  He was seen by PT was fitted with a boot for his
foot drop.

# DM II - The patient's oral diabetic medications were initially
held in the case that he would need a CT scan.  They were
resumed at discharge.

# HL - Continued on statin.

# GERD - Continued on home regimen of Ranitidine.
