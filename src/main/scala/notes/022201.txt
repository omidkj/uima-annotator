History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 73 year old man with h/o afib on Coumadin, CHF,
CAD, HTN, DM, CKD, morbid obesity, LE cellulitis, recent
hospitalization at an OSH for RP bleed, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] 2
days prior for hyperbilirubinemia and worsening renal function,
who is now being transferred from the medical floor to the ICU
for hypotension.
.
Patient initially presented to an OSH on [**2131-12-19**] for increasing
SOB. He was being treated with Cipro as an outpatient for
cellulitis, Coumadin for afib. He was hypotensive (SBP 80s) on
arrival and had a HCT 24.5 and INR 17.8 on admission, so was
admitted to the ICU. He received a total of 5units pRBCs and
11units of FFP over the course of his hospitalization from
[**Date range (3) 90787**], with HCT 28.3 on transfer. He had an EGD that
showed erosive gastritis, but otherwise unremarkable. ECHO
showed normal LVEF 55-60%, moderate TR, and moderate pulmonary
HTN. CT abd/pelvis notable for generalized ileus and 12cmx5cm L
retroperitoneal hematoma along the iliopsoas muscle. The patient
also finished a course of Ceftazidime for a polymicrobial UTI
(Ecoli and Providencia stuartii). Developed acute on chronic
renal failure, with Cr up to 4, thought likely to be ATN vs
prerenal azotemia. Also with new onset jaundice and elevated
bili up to 7.8 of unknown etiology. New bandemia up to 63% two
days prior to transfer, 39% on the day of transfer. WBC count at
that time was 11.0. CT abd showed ?SBO, but passing stool and
gas. Afib with RVR, treated with Dilt gtt and transitioned to PO
Dilt. CoNS in 1bottle of blood cultures.
.
On the floor, the patient was started on full liquids and had
imaging of his stomach repeated (KUB and abd u/s) yesterday.
Diltiazem was uptitrated from 60mg to 90mg QID, given several
one-time doses of Metoprolol 25mg PO, and started on Metoprolol
25mg PO QID this morning. The patient was found to be
hypotensive with SBP in the 80s this afternoon. He was slightly
more lethargic than prior, but was mentating well. He was
bolused 1L NS and a second peripheral IV was placed. Repeat labs
showed stable HCT, increasing INR, and worsening renal function
(Cr 4.2). The patient was transferred to the ICU for closer
hemodynamic monitoring.
.
The patient is currently c/o 2/10 L sided flank/shoulder pain.
He is not having any trouble breathing, lightheadedness, or
palpitations.

IMAGING / STUDIES:
# Portable TTE ([**2131-12-31**] at 3:19:44 PM):
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and low normal
systolic function. Right ventricular cavity enlargement with
free wall hypokinesis. Mild mitral regurgitation. Pulmnonary
artery hypertension.
.
# CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST ([**2132-1-4**] at 2:55 PM):
IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged appearance of left iliopsoas hematoma.
2. Enlarged gallbladder with no surrounding stranding likely
secondary to NPO status.
.
# LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US ([**2132-1-5**] at 5:49 PM):
IMPRESSION: Unchanged appearance of a distended gallbladder
containing sludge and a small stone at the neck. No
pericholecystic fluid or wall edema is present. While no
findings specific for acute cholecystitis are seen, this cannot
be excluded and a HIDA scan can be considered for further
evaluation.
.
# GALLBLADDER SCAN ([**2132-1-6**]):
IMPRESSION: Abnormal hepatobiliary scan. No gallbladder tracer
activity after 280 minutes. Findings consistent with acute
cholecystis.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 73 year old man with morbid obesity, AFib on
Coumadin, DM, HTN, diastolic CHF (EF 55-60%), CKD, chronic LE
cellulitis/stasis, transferred from an OSH with recent RP bleed
in the setting of supratherapeutic INR, worsening renal function
and hyperbilirubinemia.
.
#. Hypotension: Initial differential was sepsis vs bleed vs
medication effect vs severe fluid overload and R heart failure.
The patient was given increasing doses of Diltiazem and started
on Metoprolol in the setting of liver and kidney dysfunction.
However, it took longer for his hypotension to improve than
would have been expected with an adverse effect of nodal agents.
His hematocrit remained stable, making a recurrence of the
retroperitoneal bleed unlikely, despite his rapidly rising INR.
With his extreme volume overload, there was concern for R-sided
heart failure, however this was not supported by
echocardiography. He had severe left shift on admission, raising
concern for sepsis, presumably secondary to cholecystitis.
Notably all cultures were negative and there was also no change
in his chest x-ray. He was covered with eight days of empiric
vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. He had an arterial line
placed and his metoprolol and diltiazem were held. Around [**1-4**]
his pressures began to improve, likely from resolving sepsis. He
became increasingly tachycardic with AFib w/ RVR during th
