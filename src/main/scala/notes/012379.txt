History of Present Illness:
This 66 year old white female was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from
[**Hospital 1727**] Medical Center for evaluation of an aortic anastamotic
pseudoanerysm compressing the tracheal and deemed inoperable
there.

She reports seeing her cardiologist for routine evaluation with
complaints of being short of breath. She  states she has been
short of breath since [**Month (only) 205**] and over the last month has been on
home O2. She also states that she had a Bemntall in2006 at
[**Hospital6 8432**] Center with a mechanical valve. She also
notes that she has new dissection which has been followed by a
cardiac surgeon in [**State 1727**] who stated that she was not operable.
Given her shortness
of breath, the ER performed a CT scan which revealed a chronic
dissection with active extravasation and compression of the
trachea by the aneurysm sac.  She
denies tearing chest pain and states she does have some mild
pain between her scapulae which she states is chronic as well as
occassional epigastric discomfort.

Pertinent Results:
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is markedly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium or left
atrial appendage. No thrombus is seen in the left atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF 50%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The appearance of the ascending aorta is consistent with a
normal tube graft. A mobile density is seen in the distal aortic
arch consistent with an intimal flap/aortic dissection. There is
a 4.7 x 2.5 cm echolucent mass posterior to the proximal arch
which likely represents pseudoanerysm. There is flow into the
pseudoaneurysm from the aortic arch. A mobile density is seen in
the descending aorta consistent with an intimal flap/aortic
dissection. There is a thrombus/hematoma in the false lumen
beginning at the distal arch into descending thoracic aorta.
There is flow in the false lumen.
A mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic
valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc
motion and transvalvular gradients.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral valve
leaflets do not fully coapt at A2-P2 with some mild billowing of
the anterior leaflet at A2-A3. An eccentric, posteriorly
directed jet of moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified
in person of the results at time of surgery.
POST-BYPASS:
Postbypass (1): On epinephrine 0.03 mcg/kg/min, levophed 0.03
mcg/kg/min and vaso 2units/hr.
RV mild to moderate global dysfunction. LVEF 45%. No MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]R. Descending thoracic aortic dissection. Intact ascending and
arch graft.
Sudden bleeding from aortic root after 45 minutes. Went back on
bypass bleeding from left coronary button.
Postbypass (2): On same inotropes as above.
No left ventricular wall motion excepting inferior wall. Went
back on for probable left coronary flow obstruction.
Postbypass (3): SVG to LAD done.
Milrinone 0.25mc/kg/min, levophed 0.07mcg/kg/min, vasopressin
2units/hr
LVEF 35%. No lateral wall kinesis seen. Cx flow was not seen as
anticipated.
Went back on. To evaluate possible cx anastomosis. Difficult
anatomy.
Postbypass (4):
Milrinone 0.5mcg/kg/min, leveophed 0.1 mcg/kg/min, vasopressin
2units/hr.
LVEF 35%. Moderate hypokinesis of lateral wall. Intact anterior,
anteroseptal and inferior walls.
Intact graft of ascending aorta and arch.
Aortic mechanical valve is intact, peak 20 and mean 10mm of Hg.
Mitral annular ring intact. TGSAX consistent with [**Last Name (un) **]
stitch. Mean mitral gradient is 2mm of Hg.
No MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
RV severe dilatation and moderate to severe RV global
dysfunction.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
After  transfer her Coumadin was stopped and Vitamin K
administered while undergoing pre-op work up. Heparin was
started for bridging to surgery given her mechanical valve. She
underwent complex surgery with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] on [**1-6**] and
transferred to the CVICU in critical condition with an open
chest due to prolonged operative time and significant bleeding
and edema precluding closure.  She was on Milrinone, Levophed,
Vasopressin and Propofol drips.

She remained stable and was gently diuresed.  She returned to
the Operating Room on [**1-9**] for chest closure. She remained in
critical condition on significant pressor support for many days.
Liver enzymes remained elevated, but without evidence of an
acute abdomen. A feeding tube was placed for nutrition.

She became oliguric and the nephrology Service was consulted. A
dialysis catheter was placed and CVVH begun.  She  required high
PEEP to maintain adequate oxygenation. Ultimately Ms.[**Known lastname 92046**]
had a hemodialysis tunnelled line placed and CVVH was changed to
hemodialysis when her blood pressure would allow.

On [**1-18**] Thoracic surgery was consulted for evaluation for
tracheostomy/PEG placement in setting of prolonged intubation
and expected need for further ventilatory/nutritional support.
On [**1-23**] she was taken to the Operating Room and underwent a
#7.0 [**Last Name (un) 295**] tracheostomy tube, and 20-French Ponsky percutaneous
endoscopic gastrotomy tube placement with Thoracic surgery.
Plastic surgery was consulted concerning the need for possible
skin graft on necrotic left forearm wound evident x 1 week.
Plastic surgery felt Ms.[**Known lastname 92046**] was currently not medically
stable for elective surgical procedure and recommended continued
wound care per w
