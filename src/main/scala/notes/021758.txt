History of Present Illness:
This is a previously healthy 51 y/o female with h/o IBS who
recently underwent a complicated surgical course for a ruptured
appy, s/p bowel abscesses, who now p/w abdominal pain, n/v/,
bloody diarrhea, ARF, and thrombocytopenia. Please see OSH
course for details as patient is unable to provide a full
history.
.
OSH course - Presented to OSH 3 weeks ago with c/o abdominal
pain x 2 days duration. Taken to OR and found to have an acute
gangrenous perforated appendicitis, underwent lap appy with
placement of a JP drain. However, continued to have JP drainage
of clear fluid, fevers, tender abd and decreased BS. Covered
with broad-spectrum abx, subsequent CT scan revealed an acute
phlegmon at original surgical site. Therefore, 12-days post-op,
patient was taken back to the OR for an ex-lap with LOA and
drainage of intra-abdominal abscess. She was maintained on
broad-spectrum abx, improved clinically, and was d/c'd home on
post-op day 18 on cholestryamine, lomotil, fosamax, calcium,
colace, percocet, and lactobacillus. However, 3 days PTA to
[**Hospital1 **] on [**6-19**], pt developed abdominal pain, n/v, bloody
diarrhea. She was admitted on [**6-19**] to OSH and found to be tachy
and dehydrated. Afebrile and normotensive initially. Abdominal
KUB on admission showed air fluid level in the right colon with
multiple fluid-filled small bowel loops w/o dilitation. Labs
significant on admission for WBC 16K, BUN 14/Cr 1.3, Plts 425K.
During her course, BUN increased to 45 with Cr up to 4.3 with
oliguria developing. Plts dropped to to 96L, WBC up to 23K.
Concern for HUS-TTP was raised, as peripheral smear also showed
several schistocytes (1 per 50x field). Pt has been vanc and
zosyn for coverage, begun today [**6-21**], and was continued on po
flagyl and vancomycin since admission [**6-19**] for concern of c
diff.

[**2186-6-22**] Echo The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function
are normal (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. The  mitral valve leaflets are
elongated. There is mild mitral valve prolapse. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The timing of the mitral regurgitation is
late systolic. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.

CT abd/pelvis [**2186-6-22**].

CT OF THE ABDOMEN: There is moderate bilateral dependent
atelectasis with small bilateral pleural effusions. No lung
nodules or definite consolidations are identified. No
pericardial effusion.

There is very mild biliary ductal dilatation. The gallbladder
has been removed. The spleen, adrenal glands, and pancreas are
normal. The kidneys have a very unusual appearance with lack of
enhancement of the cortices, presumably due to patient's acute
renal failure.

There has been increased amount of ascites compared to one day
prior. Again demonstrated is an abnormal loop of proximal-to-mid
ileum with wall thickening. This loop is abutting a pocket of
ascites in the left lower quadrant. The terminal ileum and the
jejunum are both normal. There is no evidence of pneumatosis.
Oral contrast has now passed through to the rectum with no
evidence of obstruction. There is also mild wall thickening of
the ascending colon, also unchanged compared to one day prior.

On the arterial phase of imaging, the aorta and all of its major
vessels are patent. The SMA is opacified into its distal
branches.

CT OF THE PELVIS: Oral contrast has passed through to the distal
colon. There appears to be high density rounded structure in the
sigmoid colon which is likely contrast in a diverticulum. The
uterus is unremarkable. Air is seen within the bladder which has
a Foley catheter.

No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.

RENAL U.S. PORT  [**2186-6-25**]
Comparison made to CT from [**2186-6-23**]. The right kidney measures
10.0 cm, the left kidney measures 9.3 cm. Greyscale images
demonstrate mildly increased echogenicity to both kidneys,
suggestive of chronic medical renal disease, but no focal mass,
stone or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric fluid
collection.

Color doppler examination demonstrates reduced flow bilaterally,
but markedly worse on the right. Identification of arterial
waveforms on the right was difficult, with measurement only
possible centrally. Minimal venous flow is identified on the
right. Single resistive index measured on the right was 0.7.
Flow was slightly better on the left, but still abnormal.
Resistive indices measured in interlobar branches on the left
ranged from 0.7 - 0.9.
