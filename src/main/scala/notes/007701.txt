Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 76073**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] course required Urology assist to mobilize
bladder and ureterlysis secondary to inflammatory changes from
prostate cancer & treatment. His colorectal surgery was
uncomplicated.
.
Hypotension/Hypovolemia:He developed hypotension intra-op and
was successfully resuscitated with IV fluid. He was monitored in
the ICU overnight due to age and potential risk factors. He
remained stable, and was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name **] following morning
for post-op care.
.
RESP/Pneumonia:He had bibasilar crackles with expiratory
wheezing post-op. Chest XRAY on [**2102-11-30**] revealed pneumonia. He
was otherwise afebrile with no evidence of leukocystosis. He was
started on IV levaquin, and switched to oral levaquin. He will
continue with this regimen for two more days.
.
Post-op Delirium: His baseline mental status is A/Ox3. He has
some underlying dementia and Parkinson's. His mental status
deteriorated a few days post-op likely due to fluid balace
shifts. He became agitated, pulling on medical equipment. Soft
restraints were applied for a few hours, and Zyprexa SC given
with effect. Geriatric Team was consulted. Recommendations
provided. He remained confused for a few days after Zyprexa with
increased sleepiness, and extrapyrimidal tremors related to
[**Last Name (un) 3562**]. Adjustments were made to medication regimen. His
mental status returned to baseline on [**2102-12-3**] with no further
changes.
.
ABD/Ostomy:His abdomen is currently soft, NT/ND with active
bowel sounds. His abdominal incision is OTA with Staples. The
stoma is pink & viable with drainage pouch intact. He has a RLQ
incision that continues to drain serous fluid requiring frequent
dressing changes to maintain dry. In addition, he has a few skin
tears proximal to this incision which requires dressing as well.
Please refer to ostomy/wound care RN recommendations.
.
NUT:He was NPO post-op. His diet was advanced as his bowel
function resumed. He was reverted back to NPO due to mental
status changes, and risk for aspiration. He was advanced to
regular food once his mental status cleared. He has been
tolerating a regular diet without complaints of nausea and/or
vomiting.
.
ELIM:A foley catheter inserted intra-op. The catheter remained
inserted for a few days post-op due to condition of bladder and
ureters intra-op. The foley was removed on [**2102-12-3**], and he was
able to urinate without difficulty. Flatus and stool production
was noted in ostomy pouch. He was seen per the ostomy RN who
provided teaching regarding care of stoma. His participation in
ostomy care is minimal. He is aware of the presence of the
ostomy, but has not been able to participate in care.
.
PAIN:His pain was managed with scheduled tylenol and IV Morphine
PRN post-op. He denies pain, and has not required any narcotics.
Tylenol has managed his pain well.
.
Mobility: He was evaluated per physical therapy, and recommended
to return to Rehab due to deconditioned physical state.
