Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**]
Chief Complaint:
respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p intracranial pressure bolt placement

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 58-year-old man with history of IDDM, PVD,
status post toe amputations, diabetic neuropathy, and
retinopathy recently admitted to [**Hospital1 **] from [**2164-12-21**],
through [**2164-12-26**], with a diagnosis of right heel
diabetic ulcer with MSSA osteomyelitis of the calcaneus, MSSA
bacteremia, acute interstitial nephritis secondary to oxacillin,
and RLL pna. He was sent home with a PICC line and IV
antibiotics.  He returned to the [**Hospital1 **] intubated from an outside
hospital on [**2165-1-12**], for respiratory failure
and was sent to MICU.

Prior to his re-admission, his sister had noted that he was
having some shaking chills and heavy breathing.  When he came
back to [**Hospital 8**] Hospital for confusion and diaphoresis, his
initial oxygen sat was only 80% with a fingerstick of 29.  He
was given D50, but continued to have progressive respiratory
failure, was therefore intubated and transferred to the [**Hospital1 **] where
he was noted to have multifocal pneumonia and bacteremia with
enterobacter and MSSA.

Pertinent Results:
CT chest [**2165-1-14**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive bilateral diffuse ground glass and more confluent
areas of consolidation in both lungs consistent with the recent
chest x-ray. This non- specific pattern could represent diffuse
pneumonia complicated by ARDS. This would likely less represent
asymmetric pulmonary edema.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions.

Echo [**2166-1-14**]
Conclusions:
1. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body
of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%).
3.Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4.The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
normal in
diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque.
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
6.The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral
regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve.
7.No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
8.There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Head CT [**2165-1-16**]
FINDINGS: No intracranial hemorrhage is identified. There is no
mass effect or shift of the normally midline structures. No
major vascular territorial infarction is identified. The
ventricles and sulci are normal in size and symmetrical. No
osseous lesions are seen.

IMPRESSION:
No intracranial hemorrhage or CT evidence of acute infarction.

EEG [**2165-1-18**]
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to the presence of a low

voltage and slow background consistent with a severe
encephalopathy of
toxic, metabolic, or anoxic etiology. Note that with the
documented
movements of the patient's head and mouth, no change on the EEG
was
seen. No evidence of ongoing seizures was seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) Respiratory failure: On admission, this was felt to be likely
[**2-20**] worsening PNA. Pt remained intubated until [**2165-1-22**]. He had
difficulty weaning from the vent due to difficulties with
neurological status (he remained drowsy and unresponsive for
many days) but eventually awoke enough and was extubated without
difficulty and remained stable on 3L NC. He was transferred to
the floor but a few days later began to show signs of
respiratory distress and was transferred back to the MICU for
reintubation for likely aspiration event leading to worsening
pneumonia as well as some component of pulm edema. He was
extubated a few days later and transferred back to the floor
where his pulm status improved dramatically with lasix and
continued nebulizer treatments. The patient was prepared for
discharge on [**5-6**], when he was sat'ing in the high 90's on room
air. However, on [**2165-2-6**] at 6am the pt was found with labored
respirations (rr=24) and SaO2 89%, which improved to only
SaO290-91% on 100% NRB. ABG (7.42/38/88) was performed, 80 mg
lasix was given and the patietn had foley placed and had good
urine output and good mentation. He was also given nebulizers
without improvement. His chest radiograph had fluffy bilateral
infiltrates. Although the pt was w/o fever, he had chills. He
was readmitted tot he MICU for respiratory distress likely
secondary to a recurrent aspiration event.  He was continued on
meropenem, started on BiPAP and aggressively suctioned in an
attempt to avoid intubation.  On [**2-7**] at 10am, the patient had
an acutechange in mental status with bradycardia, hypertension,
pinpoint pupils, decerebrate posturing and increased tone in
bilateral upper extremities and unresponsiveness. The patient
was brought to CT immediately for stat scan and was found to
have a massive occipital spontaneous hemorrhage into the L
ventricle requiring ventricular drainage.  Neurosurgery was
immediately called for an EVD and anesthesia was called STAT to
the bedside for intubation at 10:45am in order to assist in
hyperventilation. After endotracheal intubation, MAPs were
maintained between 70 and 90, dilantin was dose to maintain an
appropriate level. L frontal ICP bolt was placed by neurosurgery
under sterile conditions on antibiotics. Mannitol 75 mg iv x 1
then 50 gm iv tid was begun to maintain serum osm >320
andNa>147. The patient was hyperventilated to goal PCO2 30-35
with ICP improvement. Serial head CT studies and neurologic
exams were performed but the patient was unchaged, unresponsive
with posturing and no spontaneous movement despite ICP being
maintained in good range (<20). On [**2165-2-8**], a family meeting
resulted in the patient's code being changed to comfort measures
only.  The patient was terminally extubated on a morphine drip
and ativan titrated for agonal breathing and discomfort;
scopolamine was used as an adjunct to control secretions and
appeared comfortable when he died at 12:27pm on [**2165-2-9**]. The
family refused autopsy or post-mortem examination to deduce
secondary causes of death.
