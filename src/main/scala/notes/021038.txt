EKG [**2118-3-1**]: afib , VPCs, small q in [**2-24**]/avf, LAD
CTA [**3-1**]: complete opacification and collapse of the RML and RLL
with opacification of the accompanying bronchi. (postobstructive
collapse due to mass or severe aspiration pna.)

Bronch [**3-8**]: extensive mucoid plugs throughout the entire lung,
edema of main airways and collapse of main airways secondary to
patient's obesity
U/s [**3-8**] no dvts in thighs
Echo: [**2118-3-9**]: ef 50%, mild septal flattening, loculated post
effusion.
Cxray [**3-28**]: bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left,
increased since [**2118-3-1**]. ? chf, atelectasis right lower and
middle lobes.
.
Cxray: [**4-1**]: hazy density rl base compatible with right pleural
effusion and probably compressive atelectasis at right lung
base. increased density at the retrocardiac portion of the left
lung base.
.
Rigid Bronch [**2118-4-5**]: Severe tracheobronchomalacia with
inability to insert the tracheoscope in the middle of the
trachea
because of his cervical spine fusion and lack of neck extension,
moderate bleeding around the tracheostomy tube.  No stent
placed.
.
Flexible Bronch [**2118-4-5**]: aspiration of blood clot

Brief Hospital Course:
A/p: 66 year old with a history of obesity, C-spine surgery
presented to OSH with resp infection and requiring tracheostomy,
now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for stenting of his airways.
.
# Respiratory distress: h/o restrictive and obstructive lung
disease, sleep apnea, obesity.  Recently treated at OSH for
serratia pna, still culturing serratia and pseudomonas from
sputum on [**2118-4-2**].  Collapse of RML and RLL airway collapse
noted at OSH, and bronch performed [**2118-4-4**] showed severe
tracheobronchialmalacia of primary distal trachea and right main
stem > left main stem bronchi.  Stenting attempted on [**2118-4-5**]
was unsuccessful due to pt's inability to extend his C-spine
well.  Heavy bleeding post procedure & a second bronch was
performed to suction the airways.  Pt remained stable after teh
second bronch.  Patient was transitioned to trach mask on
[**2117-4-6**] without problems.

Prolonged discussions with patient re: risks and benefits of
stent placment included discussion about ease of stent placement
but difficulty of stent removal if necessary given difficult
upper-airway anatomy.  Pt is a poor surgical candidate for
surgical correction of the tracheobronchomalacia with
tracheoplasty.  As such, it was decided to wean him to a trach
collar and proceed with downsizing the trach as able.  He was
able to tolerate a passy-muir valve without difficulty.
.
# fever/leukocytosis - At [**Hospital1 18**] the patient did not have
leukocytosis & had only low grade fevers.  Sputum [**2118-4-2**] grew
pan sensitive serratia and pseudomonas, bcx [**2118-4-2**] grew
serratia x 2, and urine [**2118-4-2**] grew yeast.  The patient has
been on vanco from [**3-10**] - [**3-15**] & [**3-24**] - [**3-26**], and zosyn [**3-8**] - [**3-28**]
& [**4-1**] - [**2118-4-7**].  LFTs WNL.
.
# Cardiac / history of a-fib.  History of afib and IVC filter,
but patient is not anticoagulated currently due to bleeding
after the procedure yesterday.  Future anticoagulation may be
recommended.
