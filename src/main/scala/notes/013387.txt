SBPs in the 200s. CXR showed CHF, BNP was 2281 and she was
treated with 40 IV lasix. She was placed on bipap for comfort.
She also received an ASA. EKG was done and did not show
significant changes. Her labs were significant for a Cr of 3.5.
While in the ER pt stated she had a several month h/o of
intermittent abd pulsations "like my heart is beating in my
stomach". Retroperitoneal ultrasound was done to evaluate for
AAA and was negative, but exam was limited.
.
Upon arrival to the ICU the patient was satting well on 5L NC
O2. Her breathing was improved.
.
Of note, pt recently had a fall out of bed 5 days ago. She notes

MRI knee:
1. Tear of the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the medial meniscus extending
to the junction with the body.
2. Tear of the free edge of the body of the lateral meniscus.
3. Joint effusion and [**Hospital Ward Name 4675**] cyst.
.
CXR:
Stable, significant cardiomegaly. Stable vascular congestion
with ill-defined areas of infiltrate, predominantly in the right
lung, which may represent atypical pulmonary edema in a patient
with underlying COPD. The possibility of a new pneumonia,
however, is not completely excluded, and short-term followup is
recommended to rule out a developing pneumonia.
.
Video swallow: Penetration with thin consistency without
aspiration. For dietary recommendations, please refer to the
speech pathology note that can be found on CareWeb.


Brief Hospital Course:
*CHF: DDx includes CHF [**3-18**] transient cardiac ischemia worsening
mitral regurg or diastolic filling vs uncontrolled HTN causing
flash pulm edema vs ACS (less likely given flat CKs) vs
worsening renal function and volume overload vs dietary
indiscretion. Also pt with transient episode of AV block
overnight and this could be precipitant for CHF
- echo with normal EF 55%, mild [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1915**], mild LVH, no AR,
mild AS, and trivial MR
- beta blocker held as pt. developed transient Wenchebach block,
asymptomatic, resolved with holding BB
- hold ACEI for worsening renal function
- consider outpt holter monitor to evaluate possible short
episodes trigeminy
- now euvolemic, lasix being held, Cr stable at 3.7-4
.
*Renal insufficiency: Followed at [**Last Name (un) **] for her renal
insufficiency by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 10083**]. Cr today is up to 4.0 up from 3.5
on admission after Lasix diuresis. Has had progressively
declining renal function, which could possibly be contributing
to her volume overload. Renal insufficiency likely [**3-18**] to DM and
HTN.
Renal following, phoslo increased, didn't tolerate renagel.
follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 10083**] after d/c from rehab.
.
*DM: Patient states she is on 68 units of NPH QAM and 5 QPM, as
well as a sliding scale. She had a few BS so she was adjusted to
60/4 of NPH, follow up with [**Last Name (un) **].
.
*HTN:
- cont. hydral and imdur increased to 60 mg, didn't tolerate BB
.
*UTI: UCx grew entercoccus, vanc [**Last Name (un) 36**] but tetracycline
resistant, started on linezolid to complete 7 day course, will
need UA followed up when finished.
.
*L medial meniscal tear: seen by ortho, declined steroid
injection, no surgery, WBAT, cont. PT
.
*FEN: regular, diabetic, low salt diet
.
*PPx:bowel regimen, PPI, sc heparin
.
*Access: PIVS
.
*Code status: DNR/DNI, confirmed with patient and her daughters
on [**12-19**]
.
