Brief Hospital Course:
Unfortunately after two transfers to the MICU during this
admission, the first for tachycardia and hypotension and the
second for respiratory failure, the patient passed away.  The
patient had a MDR Ecoli UTI, but more importantly, she had an
overwhelming MRSA infection.  This organism was cultured
intially from the blood, then the right shoulder and finally the
C-spine.  There was MRI evidence that patient might have a
meningitis, lumbosacral discitis and sinusitis.  Rather than
continueing to pursue interminable incision and drainage
procedures a decision was made to discontinue life prolonging
measures.  The patient expired shortly after extubation and the
family declined an autopsy.
