(mobile) atheroma in aortic root. Normal ascending aorta
diameter. Focal calcifications in ascending aorta. Normal aortic
arch diameter. Complex (mobile) atheroma in the descending

to moderate [[**12-7**]+] TR.

No PS. Physiologic PR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with apical
hypokinesis and mid basal hyokinesis in the RCA territory. Due
to suboptimal imaging, other WMA might have been missed..
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed
(LVEF=40 %).
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild
global RV hypokinesis.
There are complex (mobile) atheroma in the aortic root There are
complex (mobile) atheroma in the descending aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on Mrs.[**Known lastname 10936**] before
surgical incision.
Post_Bypass:
Mild global RV hypokinesis.
Overall LVEF 40% with similar wall motional abnormalities.
Intact thoracic aorta.
Mild MR. Mild to moderate TR.

Reason: Please do oblique view as well 60 cm Picc placed in left
bas
Final Report
FINDINGS: Comparison is made to the prior study from [**2199-12-28**].
New left
PICC terminates in the vicinity of the left subclavian vein.
Subclavian
versus brachiocephalic. It should be advanced. Right IJ Cordis
continues to be kinked. Patient is status post median
sternotomy. Appearance of the chest is relatively unchanged.
Opacity along prior left chest tube tract remains at the left
periphery mid lung zone. There is a small left pleural effusion
with left lower lobe atelectasis.
IMPRESSION:
Mild atelectasis at right base persists. Heart and mediastinum
within normal limits.

Brief Hospital Course:
Transferred from outside hospital and underwent preoperative
workup including pulmonary function test, and [**Last Name (un) 387**] consult for
elevated hgba1c 9.9 on insulin at home.   On [**2199-12-26**] she was
taken to the operating room and underwent coronary artery bypass
graft surgery.  See operative report for further details. In
summary she had coronary artery bypass grafting x3 with LIMA-LAD
saphenous vein graft to OM and saphenous vein graft to PDA. Her
bypass time was 78 minutes with a crossclamp of 67 minues. She
received vancomycin for perioperative antibioticcs.  She was
transferred to the intensive care unit for hemodynamic
management in stable condition.  In the first twenty four hours
she was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact, and
was extubated without complications.  Post operativly she had
complete heart block and was 100% paced via epicardial wires.
EP was consulted, her rhythm was monitored and recovered without
intervention. On post operative day two she was started on beta
blockers, tolerating well, and epicardial wires were removed on
post operative day four. She was transferred from the ICU to
stepdown floor on POD4  Physical therapy worked with her on
strength and mobility.  She continued to progress and was ready
for discharge to rehab on post operative day 5.
