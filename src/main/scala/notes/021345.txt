Brief Hospital Course:
40yo HIV+ male with PML presents with mental status change,
fever, and pancytopenia.

# Acute delirium ?????? At time of presentation was lethargic and
confused, but he returned to his baseline awarenes early in the
course of hospitalization. PML at baseline with stable
expressive aphasia and right hemiplegia. Potential etiologies
considered included CNS infectious process, progression of PML,
medication effect, metabolic abnormalities, or delrium in the
setting of systemic infection.  LP negative. MRI showed no new
infarct or enhancing lesion. Infectious workup negative
including cryptococcal antigen, CSF HSV, [**Male First Name (un) 2326**] virus PCR,
parvovirus DNA, bacterial/viral/fungal cultures.

# Pancytopenia ?????? Labs notable for depressed haptoglobin,
supporting component of hemolysis, but no evidence of DIC.
Original stool guaiac positive, but subesquently negative. His
presenting anemia improved with 3x pRBCs and remained stable
untill he developed RP bleed as noted below. On presentation he
was neutropenic with WBC less than 1 and ANC as low as 0.
Neutropenia resolved after [**Male First Name (un) 30006**] x 3 days, etiology unclear
but potentially secondary to combination of multiple bone marrow
suppressive agents including AZT, bactrim, keflex, dapsone. Bone
marrow biopsy initially consistent with toxic insult, perhaps
bactrim and or HAART (combivir/viramune) related. Also the
marrow had the appearance expected to see in a viral process,
specifically parvovirus, but infectious workup negative.
Investigation included blood/sputum/urine cultures which
remained negative as well as  testing for adenovirus,
parvovirus, HSV, EBV, CMV, lyme, bartonella, mycoplasma,
erlichia, babesia, campylobacter and PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was
administred for three doses and this restored a normal
neutrophil count. He retained normal WBC count for the remainder
of presentation. While neutropenic he was febrile and was
initially on empiric vanc/cefepime/azithro/acyclovir, but all
antimicrobials were discontinued once he was no longer
neutropenic. His bactrim and combivir/viramune were held. On
discharge his HAART was modified as indicated below.

# Pulmonary embolism: He was noted to have PE on CTA chest. He
initially was treated with heparin ggt with plan to transition
to warfarin. However, he developed an acute anemia after
starting heparin and CT abdomen confirmed a stable
retroperitoneal hematoma. Anticoagulation was discontinued and
an IVC filter was placed.

# Retroperitoneal hemorrhage: As noted his HCT decreased from 28
to 20 after onset of heparin and CT showed hematoma in psoas and
kidneys both of which were stable. He received 4x pRBC (for a
total of 7 units during this hospitalization) and heparin was
d/c'd. His HCT remained stable untill discharge (>72 hrs).

# C. Diff colitis - Clinically abdomen mildly tender in
bilateral lower quadrants, CT abdomen shows no colitis or bowel
wall thickening. Diarrhea stable with three loose BMs daily. He
was treated with po vancomycin.

# Abdominal pain, elevated LFTs, elevated lipase- RUQ US showed
dilated CBD at 9mm with focal gallbladder wall thickening and
gallstones. Surgery and ERCP were consulted with inital plan for
ERCP. Because the patient developed RP bleed as noted above, the
ERCP was delayed and in the meanwhile the patients symptoms
improved and so did his laboratory values. He was initially NPO
but his diet was advenced and he tolerated it well. Per
discussion with the consulting teams the ERCP was defered and
plan was to follow up with [**Doctor First Name **] as outpt.

#HIV ?????? At home he was on combivir and viramune, with bactrim for
PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]. Per OSH records at [**Hospital1 **], patients CD4 in [**4-9**] was
379 and viral load <75. Here CD4 116 and HIV VL undetectable.
Originally ARVs held for concern of marrow suppression. He was
subsequently restarted on viramune and truvada, as AZT thought
to be contributor to pancytopenia. Also bactrim was discontinued
for concern of contributing to marrow toxicity. He will need ID
follow up and determination of alternative PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] method.

#EtOH ?????? History of EtOH abuse, date of last drink unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **]
signs of withdrawal or DT's. Continued MVI, folate, thiamine
