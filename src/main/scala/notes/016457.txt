Studies:
CXR ([**6-28**]): A pacemaker overlies the left chest, with leads
overlying the right atrium, right ventricle, and coronary sinus.
Cardiomegaly is unchanged, as is aortic calcification. There is
no consolidation or vascular congestion in the lungs. No pleural
effusion or pneumothorax. IMPRESSION: No evidence of congestive
failure.

CXR ([**6-29**]): Left-sided AICD with right atrial, right
ventricular, and coronary sinus leads in situ, are unchanged.
There is cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta, but
no evidence for CHF or pulmonary edema and no new pulmonary
consolidations since the previous study of [**2190-6-28**].

ECHO ([**6-29**]): Biatrial enlargement. EF 20-30%. Dilated IVC with
estimated RAP 16-20 mmHg. Severe global LV hypokinesis. RV
hypertrophy with markedly dilated RA. Evidence of RV
pressure/volume overload. No AS, mild AR. Mild MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **],
severe TR. Moderate PA systolic hypertension. Trivial
pericardial effusion.

Right-sided cardiac cath ([**6-29**]): RA pressure 28/23. RVEDP 17.
PAP 57/24/36. Wedge 26/24. PVR 310.
Prior to milrinone infusion: CO/CI 3.1/1.7.
With milrinone infusion (stopped due to hypotension): CO/CI
3.7/2.0

ECHO ([**6-30**]):LV systolic function appears depressed. The RV
cavity is dilated. RV systolic function appears depressed. TR is
present but cannot be quantified. There is no pericardial
effusion. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2190-6-29**], no change.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 80 year old man with non-ischemic dilated
cardiomyopathy, EF 10-15%, afib s/p ablation, BiV ICD, who
presented from clinic with increasing SOB and fatigue over the
last few months.

#CHF: Pt was admitted for CHF exacerbation, right heart cath
with trial of milrinone. He was mildly fluid overloaded on exam.
CXR without overt edema.  The patient's INR was reversed with 3
units of FFP and was taken for right heart catheterization for a
trial of Milrinone resulting in hypotension which the patient
was unable to tolerate.  A 24-hour trial of dobutamine, despite
improved CO/CI, also resulted in hypotensive episode with SBP
into 60s. Dobutamine was weaned and dopamine added to support
SBP. Lasix drip was held and metoprolol discontinued at this
time.  Hemodynamics were supported with 2 units PRBCs. It was
decided that the patient failed inotropic therapy and would be
returned to home meds. Low dose digoxin, statin continued
throughout hospital course. ACEI held given low BP and acute on
chronic renal failure. Dopamine drip was weaned to off with SBPs
in 70s -80s upon discharge. Patient was instructed to continue
digoxin and po lasix on discharge.

#Upper GI Bleed: Patient developed hematemesis on day 3 of
hospitalization while on heparin.  Heparin was discontinued and
an NGT was placed with gastric levage after 180cc of saline
returning clear.  GI was consulted and patient started on IV
protonix [**Hospital1 **].  INR was again reversed with three units of FFP.
Given the underlying cardiac problems and hemodynamic
instability, it was decided to monitor serial hematocrits and
continue with conservative treatment unless the patient
developed worsening bleeding. Patient had no further episodes of
hematemesis and hematocrit remained stable.

#? Aspiration Pneumonia: Patient developed new O2 requirement,
leukocytosis and LLL consolidation after episodes of emesis.
Sputum cultures remained contaminated with oral flora.  Patient
treated with levaquin and flagyl for a 10 day course.

#Afib: Currently A-V paced. Coumadin held for right heart
catheterization and INR reversed with FFP.  Patient was
anticoagulated with Heparin gtt after catheterization and
planned for restart of coumadin until patient experienced an
upper GI bleed.  It was decided to hold all further
anti-coagulation.

#s/p ICD change on [**6-22**] during previous hospitalization: Site
sore but clean and dressing intact.  Patient Completed 7 day
course of Cephalexin during this stay. ICD function was turned
off on [**7-2**] when patient was made DNR/DNI.

#Acid/Base: Patient presented with borderline anion gap
metabolic acidosis, likely related to progressive renal failure.
Pt is a non-diabetic, with no current medication/toxin
exposures. After episode of hypotension, patient developed
respiratory alkalosis, which thereafter resolved.

#Thrombocytopenia: Likely related to hepatic congestion and
resulting cirrhosis, with minimally elevated L
