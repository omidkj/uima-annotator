Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 330**]
Chief Complaint:
tracheostomy failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Flexible bronchoscopy.


History of Present Illness:
The patinet is a 49 year old male with a history of sever
scoliosis complicated by secondary restrictive lung disease (FEV
27% predicted,) OSA who presented to an OSH on [**2156-11-19**] with
complaints of progressive dyspnea.
.
The patient has had worsening shortness of breath at rest over
the last year. OSH records also indicate the patient dozing off
throughotu the day, raising concerns of him falling alseep while
driving. On presentation to the ED, the he was found to be
hypoxemic (80s) and hypercapnic (ABG 7.29 / 89 / 83 / 42,) with
episodes of bradycardia with 3-4 sec pauses, and was admitted to
the ICU. He was started on BIPAP at night, with intermitent use
during the day due to his severe hypercapnic respiratory
failure, but did not have good tolerance of non-invasive
ventilation. His respiratory status continud to worsen, and the
patient was found somnolent and difficult to arouse at night.
PCO2 was found during to be 130. Due to his severe scoliosis,
and failed nasal intubation, and ENT was consulted for a
semi-emergent tracheostomy. A #6 LTC cuffed Shiley trach was
placed, but started on Passy-Muir valve during the day time. On
[**2156-11-27**], the patient occluded the tracheostomy with severe
hypoxia, requiring CPR, but resolved with trach manipulation to
restablish the airway. A similar episode occured on [**11-20**], and a
#7 Bavona hyperlexible tracheostomy was placed. He has remained
on mechanic ventialation at night, AC, 400/14/5.
.
Per OSH records, there were concerns that the tracheostomy tube
tip appeard to be eroding at the posterior wall of the trachea
due to the patients baseline abnormal antatomy. The patient was
transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of a potential customized
tracheostomy vs other intervention.


Past Medical History:
Severe scoliosis
Prior pneumothoraces
Restrictive Lung Disease
Chronic respiroatyr failure
Cholecystectomy


Social History:
The patient is currently married, no alcohol, or tobacco

Physical Exam:
Trached, on trach mask, sitting in a chair
Severe scoliosis, slgith erosis on neck from trach
Abnormal resioatory movements
Distant heart sounds, tachycardic, no m/r/g

CXR [**2156-12-1**]: The interpretation of this radiograph is very
limited due to the severe scoliosis and deformity of the
thoracic cage. Tracheostomy tube tip is 5.5 cm above the carina.
Cardiomediastinal contours cannot be evaluated. There is no
evident pneumothorax. If any, there is a small right pleural
effUsion.  The main central pulmonary arteries appear to be
enlarged. There are no prior studies available for comparison.
The asymmetric increased density in the right hemithorax could
be due to pleural effusion or lung opacities in the right lower
lobe, I suspect that also is due to the deformity of the
thoracic cage. If prior studies were available , comparison
could be performed to assess new abnormality.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 49 year old male with a history of severe
scoliosis, restrictive lung disease, OSA, who presented to an
OSH with worsening dyspnea, who developed hypercapnic
respiratory failure w/ semi-emergent tacheostomy placement, now
transfered for evaluation of posterior wall erosion.

# Hypercapnic respiratory failure: likely secondary to both
restrictive lung process due to severe scoliosis with additonal
OSA. Now status post tracheostomy placement with revision due to
hypoxemia with trach blockage. Patient has been using trach
valve during the day and CMV at night while at [**Location (un) 8641**]. He was
transferred here for evaluation of posterior trach erosion.  IP
advanced the trach approximately 1 cm with overall improvement
of airway patency given the posterior erosion.  He was noted to
have mild supraglottic edema as well.  He still has a
significant amount of secretions.  When lying flat to sleep, he
was placed on PS 10/5, but otherwise he is maintained on a trach
mask the remainder of the time. On the day of transfer, the
patients trach was switched from a flexible to a fixed bovina
7f, placed 1cm obove the [**Female First Name (un) 5309**] at 110cm.  On bronchoscopy,
continued supraglottic edema was noted, and should have an ENT
evaluation when back at [**Location (un) 8641**].  The patient reports a 20lb
weight gain in the last 2 years, and dietary modifications and
weight loss techniques should be discussed with the patient on
discharge planning.  Pulmonary Rehab is also recommended on
discharge. He will be transferred back to [**Hospital 8641**] hospital for
further care.

# Severe Scoliosis:  He also was noted to have significant GERD
as well.  His PPI was increased to 40 mg [**Hospital1 **].  He was maintained
on tylenol for pain; we avoided narcotics.

# RV failure: likely due to mod pHTN (45mmHg) in the setting of
OSA. Mild reduced RV function.  He appeared volume overloaded,
and his furosemide was increased to 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] (was transferred
to us on 40 mg daily).  His electrolytes will need to be
monitored on this dose of furosemide.
