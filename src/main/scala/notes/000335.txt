Interpeduncular fossa hemorrhage and perimesencephalic

Diagnostic Cerebral Angiogram: [**2103-4-29**] Posterior communicating
artery infundibulum

[**5-3**] CT-angiogram - A small volume of intracranial hemorrhage
persists, centered in the interpeduncular fossa, progressively
decreased since [**0-0-0**]. A small right posterior communicating
artery infundibulum is unchanged. There is no aneurysm or
embolic filling defect.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 77 year old female who was lifting a ten pound bag of
kitty litter
when she had sudden onset of severe headache and a stiff neck.
She went to bed in hopes that the headache would resolve but
woke
up four hours later with the same headache. She went to an
outside hospital where  head CT was consistent with sunarachnoid
hemorhage and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

On [**2103-4-29**] the patient was evaulated in the Emergency Department
by our service and the patient's only complaint was of headache.
The patient denied photophobia,motor weakness, sensory changes,
speech difficulty, visual changes or nausea and vomiting. She
was on coumadin for Atrial fibrillation and was given 4 units of
FFP and vitamin K at the outside hospital prior to arrival.  A
CTA of the Head was performed which was consistent with an
interpeduncular fossa hemorrhage and perimesencephalic
hemorrhage as seen on outside hospital Head CT. No aneurysm or
dissection of the intracranial arteries. Mild atherosclerotic
irregularity.  The patient was taken for a Diagnostic Cerebral
Angiogram which revealed a Posterior communicating artery
infundibulum.  The patient was admitted to the Neurosurgical
Intensive Care Unit for close neurological assement and
monitoring.  The keppra (seizure prophylaxis) was discontinued
per Dr [**First Name (STitle) **].  The patient was bradycardic 1400 40s-50 for the
rest of the day and hypotensive with systolic 93/51, but
asymptomatic. Cardiac enzymes were negative and a EKG was within
normal limits was. The patient was restarted on restarted
Aspirin.

On [**4-30**], The patient's Heart rate 60-70s. The patient was
neurologically intact.  The patient was alert and oriented to
person, place, and time.  She exhibited full strength and
sensation without pronator drift.  The femoral site was clean
dry and intact without hematoma. The decision was made to keep
the patient in the ICU for another few days to monitor for
possible recurrence of brain hemorhage.  The patient was deemed
low risk for vasospasm and in consideration of her hypotension
and cardiac history as well as home medication including calcium
channel blocker Diltiazem, the Nimodipine was discontinued.
Patient remained stable during her ICU course.  She was
transferred to floor in stable condition.

She had an uncomplicated course.  The patient's home dosing of
Diltiazem was restarted on [**5-4**].  Her coumadin dose was
restarted was dosed daily.  Her last dose was 7.5mg scheduled
for [**5-4**] (INR 1.1). She was evaluated by PT/OT and they
recommended acute rehab.  Now DOD, she is afebrile, VSS, and
neurologically stable.  She is tolerating a good oral diet and
her pain is well controlled.  She is set for d/c to acute rehab
in stable condition and will f/u accordingly.
