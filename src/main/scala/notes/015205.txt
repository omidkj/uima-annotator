History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 105012**] is a 71 year old male with h/o CAD s/p overlapping
DES to the LAD [**6-26**] then [**8-28**], recent admit for CP ([**11-23**]) had
MIBI with no reversible defects, ESRD on HD, hyperlipidemia,
HTN, DM2 who presents with chest pain since Thursday. Mr.
[**Known lastname 105012**] had a DES placed in the mid LAD in [**6-/2143**] and DES
placed to the proximal LAD in [**Month (only) **] of this year. He was
admitted on [**11-23**] for chest pain. He had three sets of enzymes -
negative CK and trop stable at 0.20. He had an exercise MIBI
that showed fixed moderate sized defect of the inferior and
anterior wall and apex, no reversible defects were appreciated,
exercise induced LV dilitation. He was discharged on [**11-24**]. He
returns with 2 days of substernal squeezing chest pain which he
feels is similar to prior. He has occasional sharp chest pains
on the left side. He also has some back pain which he is
attributing to lying on the stretcher for hrs. He has not slept
in two days due to the chest pressure. He says that Friday
evening the chest pain was at its worst, but still persists
today. He has associated shortness of breath and nausea, no
lightheadedness or diaphoresis. He has been taking NTG at home
with some brief relief of chest pain. He is on HD for ESRD. Had
HD yesterday without event.
.
In the ED, vital signs were BP 132/66, HR 72, RR 20, O2sat 100%
on RA. He was given morphine 2mg with no relief of CP. SL NTG x1
with pain improved from [**2-1**] to [**1-1**]. He was given lopressor
50mg x1 and second SL NTG and became pain free. At 6PM CP
returned, this time [**4-30**] pain and started on nitro gtt.
Reportedly became CP free. Case discussed with cardiology in the
ED and decision to start heparin gtt w/o bolus. Positive
troponin (CK 415, MB 31, Trop 0.58). Other notable labs: WBC
13.7, Hct stable 37.9, creatinine 5.0.
.
Review of symptoms is positive for nausea, shortness of breath
and fatigue. Negative for nausea, dizziness, palpitations,
abdominal pain or syncope. He has not had any BRBPR or melena.
.
On arrival to the floor patient continues to have [**3-31**]
substernal chest squeezing. He also says that his shortness of
breath is increased from prior. He is on nitro gtt and heparin
gtt. He is complaining of back pain.

BRIEF HISTORY:
71 year old man with CAD (Cypher to mLAD [**6-26**]; last
catheterization on
[**8-28**] with 2.5 x 18 and 3 x 13 Cypher DES to proximal and mid
LAD); DM,
ESRD on HD twice a week; hypertension, complete heart block s/p
PM
placement, surgically repaired R femoral pseudoaneurism, gastic
ulcer/LGIB 2 months ago, who presented with an NSTEMI and was
referred
for a cardiac catheterization.

INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
NSTEMI; CAD; multiple prior PCIs

PROCEDURE:
Left Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
left femoral artery, using a 5 French left [**Last Name (un) 2699**] catheter,
advanced to
the ascending aorta through a 6 French introducing sheath.
Coronary Angiography: was performed in multiple projections
using a 5
French JL4 and a 5 French JR4 catheter, with manual contrast
injections.
Percutaneous coronary revascularization was performed using
placement of
drug-eluting stent(s).
Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring
performed by
a member of the nursing staff.

**PTCA RESULTS
  LAD

PTCA COMMENTS:     Initial angiography revealed a 99% in-stent
restenosis in the previously placed cypher stent in the proximal
LAD. We
planned to treat this lesion wiht ptca and stenting.
Bivalirdudin was
started prophyalctically for the procedure. A 6 frenech xblad3.5
guiding
catheter provided adequate support for the procedure. A prowater
wire
crossed the lesion with minimal difficulty. The lesion was
dilated with
a 2.5x12mm voyager balloon at 10 atm. A 3.0x16mm taxus stent was
then
deployed at 16 atm. The stent was post dilated with a 3.5x15mm
nc [**Male First Name (un) **]
balloon at 14 atm. Final angiography revealed 0% residual
stenosis, no
angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI 3 flow. The
patient left
the lab free of angina and in stable condition.
