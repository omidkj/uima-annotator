History of Present Illness:
This is an 88 y.o. female with history of schizoaffective
disorder and COPD who initially presented to the hospital with
tachypnea to the 50's.  She had been in her usual state of
health at her nursing facility until the day of admission until
she was noted to have a respiratory rate of 50 during a yoga
class.  The patient denied any chest pain or SOB.  No fevers,
chills, or night sweats.

In the ED, initial VS were 96.8, 110, 107/68, 40, 100% 4L Nasal
Cannula. Initial concern was for PE but CTA did not reveal any
embolism or acute pulmonary process.  Given abdominal distension
and mild tenderness she had an abdominal CT that showed dilated
colon and small bowel with fluid filled loops but was initially
read as being without clear transition point of evidence of SBO.
 An NGT was placed and she was admitted to the floor.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 24344**] is an 88 year old female with past medical history of
HTN, schizoaffective disorder, and COPD who presented with
tachypnea and was found to have SBO, and NSTEMI vs Takotsubo's
cardiomyopathy.

Active Issues:
1) Small Bowel Obstruction:  After PE was ruled out in the ED
the focus shifted to the patient's abdomen.  Exam was notable
for distension and mild tenderness with hypoactive bowel sounds.
 KUB and CT abdomen both showed dilated loops of small bowel and
initial read was for diffuse dilation without clear transition
point.  She was admitted to medicine with presumed ileus.  The
following day read was more suggestive of SBO so she was
transferred to the surgical service.  After return to the
medicine service in the context of SVT and NSTEMI attempts were
made to better evaluate the patient's obstructive process. She
did begin to have some bowel movements.  Radiology thought most
likely source of obstruction was an obstructing lesion in the
proximal descending colon and surgery thought should be
evaluated by gastrograffin enema and/or endoscopic evaluation
prior to refeeding.  Eventually the patient had a sigmoidoscopy,
which showed no clear obstruction but a narrowing at what
appeared to be an ileocolonic anastamosis.  The area after this
was patent.  After this result it was considered safe to attempt
refeeding as ileus was thought to be primary etiology of
distension.  At time of discharge patient has been started on
solids but during period of presumed obstruction she was started
on TPN and given poor PO intake this is being continued at time
of discharge.

2) NSTEMI vs Takotsubo's cardiomyopathy: While on surgery on
[**7-15**] the patient had an episode of SVT to the 200's that was
terminated by IV metoprolol.  The following morning labs
revealed positive cardiac biomarkers so MICU consult was called.
 MICU team noted evolving EKG changes and significant enzyme
elevations concerning for infarction.  She was started on
aspirin and beta blocker but anticoagulation was deferred as by
the time of transfer to the MICU team a second set of labs
already showed downtrending cardiac enzymes and mechanism of
injury thought more likely to be demand ischemia than ACS.
Echocardiogram was obtained that showed severe akinesis of the
entire mid to distal LV with an EF of 20-25%.  In this context
BNP was markedly elevated and exam was consistent with acute
exacerbation of systolic CHF.  Therefore, she was started on
furosemide drip with total diuresis of approximately six liters
from [**7-16**] to [**7-25**].  She was transitioned from furosemide drip to
bolus on [**2113-7-22**] with good effect.  Attempts were made at
afterload reduction with captopril but blood pressures did not
tolerate this so this was deferred in favor of diuresis.  This
should be readdressed during her time at the MACU.  Pt has
cardiology follow up scheduled for *****

3) SVT, likely AVRT: Starting on the evening of [**7-15**] the patient
had multiple episodes of tachycardia to the 200's.  In these
contexts her SBP's dropped to the 80s.  The first of these
reverted with nodal agents but the second did now respond and
she required adenosine 6 mg IV *1.  She had one additional
episode on [**7-23**] that also required adenosine.  Final noted
episode was on [**7-24**] but this reverted on its own.  Pt continues
on beta blocker.

4) Complicated Urinary Tract Infection: On [**7-20**] patient was
noted to have lower blood pressures.  UA was grossly positive
and she was started on cefepime empirically given risk of
hospital acquired pathogens.  UA grew pan-sensitive E coli and
she was transitioned to ceftriaxone and then oral TMP/Sulfa.
Last day of therapy will be on [**2113-7-27**].

5) Schizoaffective disorder: Pt has a history of schizoaffective
disorder on mirtazapine and risperidone at baseline.  These were
held at presentation as it was thought they could contribute to
her constipation and bowel obstruction.  Pt appeared
undistressed off these and no behavioral issues therefore they
continued to be held.  Discussion of whether to restart should
be had with patient and her guardian.

6) Goals of Care: Health Care proxy/Guardian established patient
as DNR/I and reported patient had expressed no interest in
surgery or other very aggressive treatment measures given age
and comorbidities. Guardian requested palliative care eval who
saw the patient and would like continued palliative care input
on goals of care and decisions regarding hospitalization in the
future.  This can be provided at her receiving facility.

7) Diarrhea: As SBO resolved pt began to have copious liquid
stool.  C diff checked and was negative and patient had no pain,
leukocytosis, or signs suggestive of infectious colitis.  Likely
due to functional diarrhea as SBO resolved and patient only
eating liquid diet.  Will monitor as increases intake of solid
food.

Inactive Issues:
- COPD: Pt with history of COPD, conti
