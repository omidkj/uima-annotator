History of Present Illness:
HPI: Patient is a 73-year old female nursing-home resident with
MMP including ESRD on HD, CAD (s/p cath [**11-26**] showing 3VD, 2
stents to RCA, c/b contrast nephropathy leading to ESRD), hx of
MRSA osteomyelitis (completed 3 month course of Vancomycin on
[**7-14**]), DM, Afib who presents to the ED from HD with mental
status changes. Patient was reportedly in her USOH at dialysis
when she was noted to have a change in mental status and
responded inappropriately to questions; futher details
unavilable. Patient was taken to the ED where she was found to
be hypotensive to 70s and Temp of 100.6. She was alert and
oriented x 2. Her pressure initially responded to fluid boluses
but patient became hypotensive again. She was started on
Morphine 2mg IV x 1, Tylenol 650 mg POR x 1, Vancomycin 1g IV x
1, Levaquin 500mg IV x 1, and Flagyl 500mg IV x 1. Patient
received a head CT in the ED, wet read was negative for acute
bleed or infarction. She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further
management. CXR showed bibasilar atelectasis and small pleural
effusions, no infiltrates were noted. UA was positive for
leukocyte esterase and 50 WBCs. Patient denied any chest pain,
headache, nausea, or vomiting. Denied urinary complaints.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P 73 year-old female MMP including CAD, DM, ESRD on HD p/w
fever and hypotension, impression is sepsis, patient would like
comfort care only, competent to make decision at time of
discussion  -
.
1. Hypotension
Given fever and + UA appeared that UTI induced sepsis was high
on the differential but a urine culture was negative for
infection. Sepsis protocol initiated initially but hypotension
quickly resolved after hemodialysis stopped and fluid boluses
given.  No EKG changes noted. Patient denied any chest pain.  A
head CT was negative for any acute process.  Two sets of blood
cultures from [**2113-7-26**] are negative to date. Initially treated for
UTI w/ Levoquin as admission u/a w/ moderate leukocyte esterase
and > 50 bacteria. Urine cx negative except for yeast so stopped
anitbiotics after short course.  Given hx of MRSA sepsis,
initially covered with broad spectrum antibiotics, Vancomycin
for gram positive coverage, Levofloxacin for gram negative
coverage. Has been afebrile with normal wbc during admission.
It appears that hypotension secondary to UTI or potentially
hemodialysis.  Blood pressure was stable since time of admission
to the ICU.  Metoprolol had been held in setting of hypotension
on admission.  Would recommend that PCP restart if patient
tolerates hemodialysis on day of discharge.

.
2. Mental Status change:  Patient now A0 x 3. CT Head after
acute event was negative for acute bleed or infarction.  UTI in
elderly common cause of change in mental status, combined with
dehydration, appears to be likely etiology as patient had been
started on no new medications and had no focal deficits on
neurologic [**Month/Day/Year **].  Patient had no subsequent changes in mental
status during her admission and was at her baseline as per her
family and PCP.

.
3. CAD: No chest pain or EKG changes from baseline suggestive of
cardiac source of her symptoms. Continue Aspirin, Plavix,
Lipitor.  As noted above, her beta blocker was initally held but
would restart if patient tolerates HD on day of discharge.

.
4. ESRD:  The renal service followed the patient during her
admission. Plan to do dialysis on [**2113-7-29**]. CaCO3 TID per
outpatient regimen. Patient initially refused to continue HD and
requested to be CMO.  Later changed mind and will continue HD at
least temporarily. Renal aware.
.
5. DM:  Patient had been refusing fingersticks so RISS held were
held for one day.  Patient should be restarted on QID
fingersticks with regular insulin sliding scale in place.
.
6. Depression:  Continued Citalopram 20mg [**Hospital1 **] during admission
and should be continued on discharge.
.
7. Back Pain: Acetaminophen 650mg PO q4-6h PRN pain given during
admission. Lidocaine Patch continued as outpatient.  Had been on
morphine gtt when temporarily made CMO with good effect.
Continue with MS Contin prior to hemodialysis as had been
getting prior to admission.

.
8. PPx: Heparin 5000 SC TID, Protonix, and Folic Acid 1 mg PO qd
as inpatient.
.
9. F/E/N:  Patient was on renal, low fat diet with 2g salt
restriction.  Poor po intake during admission but had been
improving prior to discharge.  Repleted electrolytes as needed.
.
10. CODE: DNR/DNI  Patient had temporarily been made CMO on
[**2113-7-28**] because she no longer wanted to continue HD and felt her
quality of life was not worth prolonging her suffering.  Ethics
committee consulted and discussions had with PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] that
it was reasonable for patient to be CMO.  However, after talking
with her family patient changed her mind and opted to continue
HD at least for now.  Will continue DNR/DNI.
.
11. Communication: Daughter
.
12. Disposition:  Will return to [**Hospital **] nursing home on [**2113-7-29**]
following dialysis.
