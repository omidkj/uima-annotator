Brief Hospital Course:
57 y/o female transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital3 19345**].  She underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2159-11-6**]
which revealed 50% LM & 3vCAD. She had hemodynamic compromise in
the cath lab requiring emergent IABP placement and intubation.
She was transferred to the CCU, and extubated.  Hematology
service was consulted re:ITP.  She was also given Plavix at the
time of her cath.  She was optimized from the medical
standpoint, and taken to the OR on [**2159-11-8**].  She underwent CABG
X 3 (LIMA>LAD, SVG>diag, SVG>Ramus) by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  PLease see
operative report for details of surgery.  Post-op she was taken
to the CSRU on epinephrine, phenylephrine and propofol gtts.
She remained intubated while her vasoactive gtts, and IABP were
weaned.  Her IABP was discontinued on POD # 1, and was extubated
on the morning of POD # 2.  She remained in the CSRU for 2 more
days due to her high insulin requirement necessitation an
insulin gtt.  The was ultimately transitioned to her insulin
pump (which she was on pre-operatively), and she was transfered
to the telemetry floor on POD # 4.  She has remained
hemodynamically stable, has progressed with ambulation, and is
ready to be discharged home today.
