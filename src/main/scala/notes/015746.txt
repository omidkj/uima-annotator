History of Present Illness:
24M with DM1, ESRD on PD, HTN, CHF (EF 15%), recently admitted
[**Date range (1) 11953**] for possible peritonitis who p/w N/V x2 days. Pt
reports feeling well after d/c on [**12-11**] w/FS glc 150s but then
yesterday felt "funny" and glucometer read "critical" so gave
himself 10U Humalog. Rechecked later & still "critical" so gave
himself another 16U Humalog. Then developed N/V, vomiting >12
times of clear vomitus last night. Did give himself 18U Lantus
night PTA as well. Poor PO intake since nausea began. He denies
having missed any doses of insulin prior to this. This AM, had
"coffee ground" emesis x1, ~[**1-2**] cups in volume, no [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] came
to ED. Minimal UOP at baseline due to ESRD.
.
In ED, serum glc 760, started on insulin gtt & given total 20U
insulin IV. FS glc came down to 460->->70 as drip titrated to
off & D5 started. He was also noted to be hypertensive to
213/109. Pt had peritoneal fluid sampled. He got 1gm vanco for
?thrombophlebitis. Pt refused NG lavage.
.
MICU course:
Diabetes: In [**Name (NI) **], pt was noted to have moderate acetone initially
& AG 18 but very dehyrated with Bicarb 26. AG closed w/insulin &
IVF in the ED. FS was 62->42 upon arrival to MICU secondary to
not getting D5 IVF. Pt was started on D5 with increase in BS
which were covered by humalog.  He was weaned off insulin gtt
and restarted on Lantus and sliding scale [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recs.
.
Cardiac: Pt had new TWI in V5-[**Street Address(2) 28607**] depression for which he
was ruled out for MI. Pt was noted to be hypertensive with LV
strain pattern on EKG. He was continued on home antihypertensive
medications.
.
GI: Pt presented with coffee ground emesis. He was guiac
negative in the ED. Thought to be secondary to small [**Doctor First Name 329**]
[**Doctor Last Name **] tear [**2-2**] vomiting. Serial hcts performed and hct
stabilized at 31.
Ascitic fluid showed no evidence of peritonitis with 24 wbc, 15
rbc, negative gram stain. Pt was continued on ceftaz and ancef
for recent history of peritonitis which was administered through
PD.
.
Renal: Pt was continued on [**Hospital1 **] peritoneal dialysis.
.
Pt had question of new thrombophlebitis in RUE from recent line.
Pt was treated with ancef, then po keflex. Ultrasound was
performed which showed a long intraluminal thrombus in the
cephalic vein extending from the axilla to the antecubital
fossa.

Brief Hospital Course:
24 yo male with PMH DM1, ESRD on PD, HTN, CMP (EF 15%) adm with
DKA and coffee ground emesis.
.
1. DKA/DM1: Pt initially presented in DKA with an anion gap of
18 and moderate acetones. He was admitted to the MICU where he
was given insulin and IVF with subsequent close in his anion
gap. He was weaned off the insulin drip and switched to lantus
18U and regular insulin sliding scale. Pt was followed by [**Last Name (un) **]
throughout admission.
.
2. Coffee Ground Emesis: Pt was noted to be guaiac neg in ED. He
had a decrease in Hct in the setting of aggressive diuresis,
likely a dilutional effect. He didn't have any signs or symptoms
of active bleed with stable VS. He most likely has a small
[**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] from repeated vomiting associated with DKA. Hct
stabilized at 31. Pt was continued on [**Hospital1 **] PPI.
.
3. Hx peritonitis: Ascitic fluid on this admission is
unremarkable. WBC above baseline but no localizing Sx. Ascitic
fluid and blood cultures without growth to date. Pt was
continued on intraperitoneal ceftaz & Ancef started during the
last admission.
.
4. RUE cephalic clot: Pt complained of a painful and swollen
right arm. Ancef was switched from intraperitoneal to IV, to
treat presumed thrombophlebitis. Pt had a RUE U/S which showed a
cephalic clot from antecubital fossa to axilla; he did have a
peripheral IV in R antecub fossa during last admission. He was
initially started on wt based heparin for this superficial
thrombus because of its large size. Hematology was consulted,
who felt that anticoagulation was not necessary. Heparin was
discontinued. He clinically improved with conservative tx incl
warm compresses.
.
5. HTN:  Pt was continued on irbesartan, labetalol, Norvasc,
enalapril. Pt was noted to be hypertensive to the 160s.
Enalapril was titrated up.
.
6. ESRD on PD:  Pt was followed by renal throughout hospital
course. He received 5 cycles/day on peritoneal dialysis. Pt was
continued on his outpatient renal meds: sevelamer and CaCarb. Pt
received intraperitoneal ceftaz and ancef for his hx of
peritonitis.
.
7. FEN: Pt was given aggressive IV hydration.
.
8. Prophyl: PPI [**Hospital1 **], SC heparin
