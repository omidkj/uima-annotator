Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6378**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 10468**] is a 59 year old gentleman with history of
sardoidosis who presented to clinic [**10-30**] with complains of
increasing dyspnea x 6 days.  He describes the sudden onset of
shortness of breath with exertion 6 days prior to presentation.
Symptoms progressively worsened such that he had to stop for
several minutes to catch his breath when he would try to climb
stairs. He described chest pain, which is substernal and on the
right side of his chest. This pain is not exertional and has
been present for at least a month. He also feels that his
baseline cough has been somewhat worse. Of note, he had also
been having right lower extremity swelling, pain and warmth x 2
weeks. No orthopnea, no PND or recent fevers. No hemoptysis. No
recent travel or immobilization. No recent injuries.

In clinic, he was noted to be tachycardic. A lower extremity
ultrasound demonstrated large deep vein thrombosis of the right
leg and he was sent to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation.

In the ED, initial vital signs were: 98.2 115 (sinus tach)
128/89 24 100% RA. Stool guaiac was negative. CTA Chest was
notable for massive bilateral pulmonary embolisms as well as
reverse deviation of the interventricular septum indicative of
right heart strain. He received one liter normal saline, aspirin
325mg and heparin gtt.

Past Medical History:
1. Sarcoid
2. Dyslipidemia
3. Headaches
4. Superficial thrombophlebitis--had an episode "out of the
blue" several years ago
5. Possible gastroesophageal reflux disease--patient does not
endorse heartburn although he has been on a omeprazole for over
a year.


Social History:
Non- smoker. Occasional alcohol. No history of intravenous drug
use. Works as financial planner and is married.

Family History:
No history of blood clots or bleeding disorders.

PT: 13.3  PTT: 27.8  INR: 1.1

CXR [**10-30**]: Stable appearance of the chest in keeping with
patient's known sarcoidosis. Of note, mediastinal
lymphadenopathy is better visualized in CT performed the same
day.

CTA Chest [**10-30**]:
1. Massive bilateral pulmonary emboli with right heart strain
pattern. Correlate clinically adn with echocardiography.
3. Stable centrilobular nodules and consolidative changes of the
upper lobes and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, compatible with the
patient's diagnosis of sarcoidosis.

Bilateral Lower Extremity Ultrasound [**10-30**]:
Nearly occlusive thrombus involving the right superficial
femoral
and popliteal veins. Findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3306**]
immediately after completion of the study by the son[**Name (NI) 930**].
The patient will be going to [**Hospital1 18**] Emergency Room today.

ECHO [**10-31**]: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF 60-70%). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the
sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Right ventricle is somewhat dilated and
hypocontractile
PERTINENT LABS AT DISCHARGE:

INR: [**11-3**] 2.0  [**11-4**] 2.4  [**11-5**] 2.8


Brief Hospital Course:

1)Pulmonary embolism: Patient presented with large bilateral
pulmonary embolisms. This was confirmed by CTA of the Chest. He
was started on a Heparin drip that was bridged to Coumadin. The
patient was monitored on telemetry during his admission which
remained unremarkable. Patient initially had some intermittent
chest pain likely secondary to large clot burden. Cardiac
enzymes and EKG showed no indications of ischemia at any time.
Chest pain had nearly resolved at time of discharge. Patient was
initially requiring oxygen via nasal cannula that was weaned
off. At the time of discharge the patient's oxygen saturation on
room air with and without activity were consistently greater
than 93%. At time of discharge patient had been therapeutic on
Coumadin for 48 hours. Plan is for him to get INR recheck at Dr. [**Name (NI) 10469**] office starting [**11-7**] and weekly thereafter. The
patient was instructed to stop taking his daily aspirin for the
time being given an increased risk of intra-cranial bleeding
with Warfarin and aspirin combined therapy. Provided patient
with handout about Coumadin and answered his questions regarding
warfarin therapy.

2) Sarcoid: Stable during this admission. Patient was continued
on Prednisone 10 mg daily. Patient should follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 575**] as an outpatient.

3) Leukocytosis: Initially had an elevated white blood cell
count count that has resolved. This likely was a reactive
leukocytosis responding to the stress of a massive pulmonary
embolism. Patient had no evidence of infection including no
fevers. A urinalysis was negative and the CT chest did not show
evidence of infection.

4) Gastroesophageal reflux disease: Patient was continued on his
outpatient omeprazole.

5) Dyslipidemia: Patient was continued on his outpatient dose of
atorvastatin.

The patient was FULL CODE during this admission.

Discharge Condition:
good


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital due to large blood clots in
your lungs called pulmonary emboli that were seen on CT scan.
The blood clots were likely the cause of your increased
shortness of breath. You were started on a medicine called
Heparin to prevent you from forming more clots and were then
transitioned to a medicine called Coumadin that has the same
effect. When you leave the hospital you must continue to take
coumadin indefinitely to prevent more blood clots from forming.
You can discuss the time course for taking Coumadin with your
PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] wi
