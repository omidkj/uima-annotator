Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on [**2141-5-11**] and, later that day, was
taken to the operating room by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for a right total hip
arthroplasty without complication.  Please see operative report
for details. Postoperatively the patient had a planned admission
to the SICU.  She remained hemodynamically stable and was
extubated on POD0 without incident.  The patient was initially
treated with IV followed by PO pain medications on POD#1.  The
patient received IV antibiotics for 24 hours postoperatively, as
well as coumadin for DVT prophylaxis starting on the morning of
POD#1.  Because of cardiac necessity, the patient was restarted
on aspirin and plavix on POD1. The drain was noted to have
fallen out overnight on POD0-1.  The Foley catheter was removed
without incident. The surgical dressing was removed on POD#2 and
the surgical incision was found to be clean, dry, and intact
without erythema or purulent drainage.
 While in the hospital, the patient was seen daily by physical
therapy. Labs were checked throughout the hospital course and
repleted accordingly. At the time of discharge the patient was
tolerating a regular diet and feeling well.  The patient was
afebrile with stable vital signs. The patient's hematocrit was
stable, and the patient's pain was adequately controlled on a PO
regimen. The operative extremity was neurovascularly intact and
the wound was benign. The patient was discharged to home with
services or rehabilitation in a stable condition.  The patient's
weight-bearing status was WBAT with posterior precautions.
