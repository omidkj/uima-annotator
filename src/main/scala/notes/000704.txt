WRIST, AP & LAT VIEWS BILAT PO

Reason: ?injury

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
40 year old woman s/p mvc
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
?injury
EXAM ORDER: Bilateral wrists.

HISTORY: Trauma.

Right wrist: Two views show distal radius fracture with
approximately 4-mm stepoff at the articular surface of the
radius. The articular surface of the radius appears to be
dorsally tilted, however, the lateral view is suboptimal. There
is also ulnar styloid fracture.

Left wrist: Two views show no evidence of a distal radius
fracture.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2120-5-5**] 9:15 AM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: ?injury

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
40 year old woman s/p high speed mvc
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
?injury
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 40-year-old female status post high speed motor
vehicle accident.

No comparison studies.

CT HEAD NON-CONTRAST:

No definite intracranial hemorrhage is seen. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
differentiation is slightly less defined and normal. There is no
evidence of mass effect. There is no evidence of hydrocephalus.
Along the right temporal and frontal aspect of the skull, there
is a large extracranial soft tissue density likely representing
hematoma and swelling.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. Slight
blurring of the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation. Large right
extra-axial hematoma.

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2120-5-5**] 9:16 AM

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST

Reason: ?injury
Field of view: 40 Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
40 year old woman s/p high speed mvc
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
?injury
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 40-year-old female status post high-speed motor
vehicle accident.

No comparison studies.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired axial images of the chest, abdomen and
pelvis were performed with IV contrast. Delayed scan and
thin-sliced reconstructions were performed.

CT CHEST: The mediastinum and great vessels are unremarkable.
Lung windows demonstrate partial collapse of the right greater
than left upper lobes. Within the left middle lung field, there
is a focal linear area of opacity, which may represent a small
contusion. There is a moderate-sized right pleural effusion of
high attenuation likely representing hematoma. There is no
evidence of pneumothorax, or pericardial effusion.

CT ABDOMEN: The liver is surrounded by moderate hematoma. Within
the liver parenchyma, there is a moderate-sized area of low
attenuation, likely representing laceration/contusion of
predominantly segment 7 and segment 8. No active extravasation
is seen within the liver--Grade III. Within the spleen, there
are multiple areas of low attenuation that are linear likely
representing laceration. Approximately 30% appears involved.
Adjacent to the spleen, there is a large hematoma with an area
of high attenuation very concerning for active extravasation. On
delayed images, this area is more diffusely spread consistent
with active extravasation. On delayed images, there also appears
to be increased volume of hematoma within the pericolic gutters.
The kidneys and adrenal glands are unremarkable. No gross small
or large bowel abnormalities are noted. There is a small amount
of free fluid seen within the mesentery. No oral contrast was
provided in this examination. The retroperitoneum is
unremarkable.

CT PELVIS: Free fluid likely representing blood is seen within
the pelvis. The urinary bladder, uterus, rectum are
unremarkable.

BONES: At the level of T7, there is a fracture through the the
vertebral body extending through the pedicles, left and right
lamina the right transverse process and the spinous process.
Included within this fracture plane are a fracture through the
superior end plate of T8. There is also an avulsion fracture of
the spinous process of T6. This distribution is unstable and is
consistent with a hyperflexion injury. No fragments are seen
within the spinal canal. There are also small right transverse
process fractures seen in T8 and T9.

IMPRESSION:

1. Moderate right hemothorax. Small left middle lung field
contusion.
2. Right greater than left upper lobe partial collapse.
3. Moderate-sized liver laceration in segment 7 and segment 8
with no evidence of active extravasation. Grade III. Moderate
perihepatic hematoma.
4. Moderate-sized splenic laceration. Moderate perisplenic
hematoma with marked active extravasation. Surgical team was
notified of these findings immediately after conclusion of the
exam and patient brought to the OR for splenectomy.
5. Unstable fractures of T7 and probably stable fracture of T8
vertebral bodies. Also avulsion fracture of T6 spinous process.
These likely were due to hyperflexion injury. Additional T8 and
T9 right transverse process fractures.

C-SPINE TRAUMA W/FLEX & EXT 5

Reason: ligamentous injury? Requested by ortho-spine. thank you.


[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
28 year old woman with MVC and difficulty clearing clinically.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
ligamentous injury? Requested by ortho-spine. thank you.
INDICATION: 28-year-old woman with status post MVC with
difficulty clearing secretions, evaluate for ligamentous injury.

CERVICAL SPINE SERIES: Series consists of five radiographs
consisting of neutral, flex, and extension views, AP and open
mouth views. C1 through the superior endplate of C6 are
visualized. There is no evidence of acute fracture. No evidence
of reduced listhesis or instability on the flexion or extension
views. Orogastric feeding tube seen coursing anteriorly.
Thoracic paravertebral stabilization rods noted.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of ligamentous injury; C1 through the
superior endplate of C6 evaluated.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted to the trauma service. FAST exam was positive
in the trauma bay; patient was immediately taken to the
operating room for exploratory lap and splenectomy. Her serial
Hct's were followed closely, her most recent Hct was 30.4.
Plastic surgery consulted for chin/lip laceration which was
sutured. Orthopedic surgery consulted because of her wrist
injuries, she was taken to the OR on [**5-6**] for ORIF of her wrist
fracture. Vascular surgery consulted to rule out any vascular
injury to RUE; angiogram not indicated given stable exam.
Orthopedic Spine surgery consulted because of t
