the Emergency Room after the fall on ice.  She had a negative
head CT scan.  She had a chin laceration that was repaired
and the patient was sent home.

On the day of admission, the patient fell again while on a
treadmill.  The event was not witnessed.  The patient was
able to call for help.  She phoned her primary care
physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] saw her at home and she was noted to have some
word finding difficulties.

The patient was sent to the Emergency Room, where a head CT
scan showed acute/chronic bifrontal subdural hematomas.  The
patient had vomited times one in the Emergency Room.  She had
no complaints of shortness of breath or chest pain.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa, hydrochlorothiazide and ACE inhibitors.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient
had a blood pressure of 165/89, pulse 82, respiratory rate 18
and oxygen saturation 94%.  She was an elderly woman in no
acute distress.  She was sedated after some morphine.  She
was alert to voice, answering questions.  Speech was fluent.
Repetition slightly impaired.  Difficulty with complex
commands.  Extraocular movements full.  Pupils equal, round,
and reactive to light, 3 mm and brisk.  Face symmetric.
Tongue midline.  Moving all extremities.  No drift.  Lower
extremity strength 5/5.  Chest:  Clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, no
murmur, rub or gallop.

LABORATORY DATA:  The patient had a CT scan which, again,
showed the acute/chronic bifrontal subdural hematomas, right
greater than left, with no mass effect and no cerebral
hemorrhage.  The patient was admitted to Neurosurgery
Intensive Care Unit.  She was closely monitored there.

Later on in the day on [**2157-12-11**], the patient's mental
status became lethargic.  She had a repeat head CT scan that
showed no change in the status of the subdural but,
clinically, the patient was much worse.  She was awake and
alert but had severe aphasia.

The patient's condition was discussed with her family and it
was determined that the patient should go to the Operating
Room for evacuation of the subdural hematomas.  She had a
left frontal craniotomy for evacuation of acute subdural
hematoma without intraoperative complication.

Postoperatively, the patient was monitored in the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit.  Her pupils were 2 to 1 mm and brisk.
She was mumbling, with no coherent speech.  She was wide
awake and alert, moving all extremities spontaneously.  A
postoperative head CT scan showed good evacuation of the
subdural hematoma.

The patient continued to be monitored in the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit.  She was transfused with one unit of
packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 27.2.  She was
extremely agitated postoperatively, requiring sedation with
propofol.  She eventually became less agitated and more
awake, but continued to be extremely aphasic.

The patient had a magnetic resonance imaging scan with
diffusion weighted images, which showed evidence of a left
MCA infarction.  She was seen by the neurology service.  She
also had a transthoracic echocardiogram and carotid Doppler
study.  The carotid Doppler study showed no significant
stenosis of either carotid artery.  The echocardiogram showed
no evidence of atrial dilatation.

The patient had a chest x-ray which showed evidence of
pneumonia.  She was started on Levaquin and Flagyl.  She was
seen by the speech and swallow service for video swallow.
The patient does have overall functional swallowing mobility
with minimal residual noted, which was cleared by the patient
spontaneously.  The patient is able to initiate a diet of
think liquids and regular consistency solids for diet.

The patient was transferred to the floor on [**2157-12-16**]
and seen by physical therapy and occupational therapy, and
found to require rehabilitation prior to discharge to home.
Neurologically, she remains awake, alert and oriented, with
severe aphasia, moving all extremities with good strength and
following commands.

DISPOSITION:  The patient will be transferred to
rehabilitation with follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] in two weeks
with a repeat head CT scan.
