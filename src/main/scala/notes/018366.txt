HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71-year-old
male with a history of coronary artery disease, status post
myocardial infarction times four, coronary artery bypass
graft with multiple PCA interventions, atrial fibrillation,
congestive heart failure with several recent admissions
presenting with syncope.  At the time of initial interview
the patient was unable to give further events secondary to
Ativan administration, although the following day the patient
described a syncopal event on the couch witnessed by his
wife.  [**Name (NI) **] denied chest pain or shortness of breath throughout
the episode.  While in the Emergency Room the patient had
multiple episodes of V tach lasting at least 16 seconds which
were witnessed by the RN who stated patient's eyes rolled
back in his head.  The patient does have an implantable
defibrillator that did not fire and received 150 mg of
Amiodarone in the Emergency Room.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery
disease, had a coronary artery bypass graft in [**2133**] which was
[**Year (4 digits) 5659**] to LAD, continuous to OM1, RCA, [**6-/2154**] had PTCA with stent
to the [**Last Name (LF) 5659**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] graft.  In [**2146**] had PTCA again to [**Year (4 digits) 5659**] to OM
and RCA.  Congestive heart failure had a recent admission to
[**Hospital1 69**].  [**4-1**] had instent
stenosis with stent to the [**Month/Year (2) 5659**] to RCA and EF was 15% at that
time.  [**2156-7-1**] a cath showed [**Year (4 digits) 5659**] to RCA 99% with PTCA
done, patent [**Year (4 digits) 5659**] to LAD and [**Year (4 digits) 5659**] to OM1.  The patient has
automatic implanted defibrillator secondary to cardiac arrest
that occurred in [**2153**].  Also has benign prostatic
hypertrophy.

MEDICATIONS:  On admission, Aspirin 325 mg, Lasix 80 mg in
the morning, 40 mg at night, Zestril 2.5 mg, Toprol XL 12.5,
Lipitor 10 mg, Coumadin 2 mg, Proscar 5 mg, Ticlid 250 mg
[**Hospital1 **], home oxygen 2 liters and initial blood pressure 94/61,
pulse 74, respirations 20, 100% on two liters.  In general
the patient is sleepy, arousable to pain, anicteric, heart
was regular, 2/6 systolic murmur.  Chest, decreased breath
sounds at the bases with decent air exchange.  Abdomen,
positive bowel sounds, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities
showed [**12-3**]+ edema to the mid calf.

LABORATORY DATA:  Hematocrit 39.9, white count 10.5, platelet
count 116,000, sodium 134, potassium 5.0, chloride 99, CO2
30, BUN 67, creatinine 2.1, glucose 125, initial CK 77 with
troponin of 1.2.  Chest x-ray showed increased perihilar
haziness, bibasilar opacities suggestive of pulmonary edema.
EKG initially showed a left bundle branch block at 82.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  The patient was admitted to the floor and placed on
telemetry for syncope and V tach arrest.  The patient was
continued with the diuresis of IV Lasix.  The next day the
patient was taken to the EP lab for ablation of his V tach
focus and mapping of his V tach.  The day before the patient
received adjustment of his pacer, defibrillator settings to
shock at a lower rate.  On the morning after the ablation,
the patient was found to be less oriented, not saturating
well, cyanotic toes and was transferred to the CCU for
administration of Milrinone.  While in the CCU the patient
received 24 hours of Milrinone without much response. After
two days the patient was called out to the floor.  On the
floor the patient continued in congestive heart failure.  An
echo done previously on this admission had showed an EF
around 10%.  The patient was started on a Natrecor drip and
was evaluated for receiving a biventricular pacer.  The
patient received the pacer and on the day after continued to
do well.  A repeat echo showed an EF of [**9-19**]%.  The patient
was mentating well and was no longer as cyanotic and was
saturating well off oxygen.  None of these events were
thought to be ischemic.  Elevated enzymes post ablation were
thought secondary to the ablation itself and came down
appropriately.

2.  Pulmonary: Patient had congestive heart failure
throughout his admission, had good response to Natrecor,
Lasix, Spironolactone was started to increase this diuresis.
Of note, the patient also had episodes of sleep apnea with O2
sats down to 89% and we avoided giving him Ambien for the
rest of his admission.

3.  Hematology:  A) Thrombocytopenia - The patient's platelet
count started dropping during his CCU stay.  It was monitored
and had a nadir in the 70's.  We were considering
discontinuing anti-platelet agents if the downward trend
continued, although patient very much needed his Ticlid for
his stents.  No signs of symptoms of bleeding were noted.
B) Leukocytosis - patient accidentally received a dose of
Solu-Medrol while initially on the floor due to a nursing
error.  Although the white count remained elevated, there
were no signs or symptoms of other systemic infections.

4.  Infectious Disease:  The patient had thrush throughout
his admission.  He was tried on Clotrimazole troches and
Nystatin swish and swallow although still complained of mouth
burning with some visible thrush.  On the day of his
discharge he was started on Diflucan 200 mg po the first day,
then 100 mg a day after.

CODE STATUS:  The patient's code status changed during this
admission.  He was initially full code and after careful
discussion with his family, was changed to DNR/DNI.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Coronary artery disease.
2.  V tach.
3.  Syncope.
4.  Congestive heart failure exacerbation secondary to
ventricular tachycardia and ischemic cardiomyopathy.
5.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
