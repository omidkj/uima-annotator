[**2-27**]: CT/CTA: Large area of abnormal perfusion with elevated
transit time and decreased cerebral blood flow in the right
middle cerebral artery territory, likely secondary to new
occlusion of a longstanding stenosis in the M1 segment of the
right middle cerebral artery. These findings are consistent with
a relatively large ischemic penumbra.

CTH [**2-27**]: : post TPA: No intracranial hemorrhage.

[**2-28**]: Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on
the aortic valve. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The
increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac
output. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
mitral valve. There is no systolic anterior motion of the mitral
valve leaflets. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No cardiac source of embolism seen. Hyperdynamic
left ventricular systolic function. Diastolic dysfunction. Mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

[**3-1**]: 1. No significant change in right MCA territory ischemia
on non-contrast head CT.
2. Improvement in transit time abnormality in anterior right MCA
territory, with no significant change in delayed transit time
through posterior right MCA territory or decreased cerebral
blood flow.
3. Abrupt cutoff of right MCA again demonstrated, though perhaps
slightly more distally than in the previous study. No evidence
of hemorrhage.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the ICU post tpa.
Neuro: pt's SBP were low, required significant IV hydration to
keep SBPs >120 to encourage cerebral perfusion.  initial post
TPA CTH without hemorrhage.  CTH 24 hrs post TPA without
hemorrhage.
A1c: 6.1
FLP chol 158 HDL 47 LDL 95 -> statin increased to 40 QDay

pt continued to have L sided weakness, although more alert on
HD2.  repeat CT/CTA/CTP revealed no infarction, no blood volume
asymmetry, but with significant increased MTT in RMCA
distribution.  CTA revealed continued stenosis/clot in slightly
more distal position in RMCA.  discussed with family possibility
of IA tpa and clot retrieval, which was refused by the family.

CV:
Echo demonstrated no cardioembolic source for stroke
troponins were checked 0.03 -> 0.04
+ rapid AFib on telemetry to 130s.  reconverted to regular
rhythm with dilt X 1.  patient discovered to have afib
previously at rehab.  was instructed that she would benefit from
coumadin, but patient had refused coumadin [**2-3**] concerns for
bleeding.  with afib, after extensive discussions with her
daughter (health care proxy), she was started on heparin gtt
(goal 50-70).

FEN: initial Creat 1.8: with IV hydration, Creat decreased to
1.4 on HD 1. to 1.0 on HD2.

Resp: stable but without continued support, the patient succumed
- see below for code status.

Heme: significant drop in HCT from admission labs: 29.7 (down
from 37.3). repeat stable 29.6 (likely dilutional with IV
hydration).

Endo: A1c 6.1.  pt with stable sugars on RISS.

GI: S&S eval - pt too sleepy initially to complete swallow
evaluation and repeat eval on [**3-1**].  family refused NGT. pt was
started on D5NS.

Code: status changed to DNR/DNI and then to CMO per family.

The patient expired on [**2131-3-5**].
