Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7223**]
Chief Complaint:
Motor vehicle accident

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization with placement of stent
Intubation with mechanical ventilation
Placement of Right femoral catheter for CVVHD
Left subclavian catheter--pulmonary artery catheter

History of Present Illness:
47 yo M with PMH of diabetes s/p MVA, restrained head-on
collision vs wall, presented to the ED with VS: 97.5  130/86
101  90% on NRB.  He was c/o chest pain.  While being evaluated
by plastics for multiple facial lacerations, he was noted to
have ST elevations in III, V1-V3 with ST depressions in I and
aVL and was urgently transferred to the cath lab. He received
325 ASA, 600 plavix, 5mg IV lopressor. Pt had 2 episodes of VF
and was shocked twice at 200j.  He was found to have a dissected
ostial lesion of the RCA, which was stented.  He was bolused
lidocaine 100mg and started on lidocaine GTT at 2mg/min.  PCWP
was found to be 21/18/17 with PA pressure 34/17/25.
.
Noted on CT are multiple right-sided rib fractures, small right
pleural effusion, communited nasal fracture. A c-spine CT shows
an acute small fracture "chip" at the anteroinferior corner of
C5.
.
On transfer to the CCU, pt was initially awake and c/o nausea.
He went into a third episode of VFib.  He was bolused 100mg IV
lidocaine and started on amiodarone gtt with return to sinus
rhythm.  ABG was 7.29/47/119/24 and there was concern that he
was developing respiratory acidosis secondary to splinting from
his rib fractures.  Anesthesia was consulted in anticipation of
possible intubation for airway protection in the setting of
multiple facial fractures and bloody emesis.  Anesthesia
succeeded in intubating patient using fiberoptic guidance;
surgery was available in case of the need for an urgent trach.
Left arterial line was placed, and femoral sheath was removed,
leaving a right-sided femoral venous catheter in place.
Plastics came to the bedside for repair of facial lacerations.
.
On review of symptoms, his wife denies any prior history of
stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism,
bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers,
chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All
of the other review of systems were negative except for
tiredness.
.
Cardiac review of systems could only be conducted with the wife
at the time of admission; she denied that the pt had recently
c/o chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
EKG demonstrated sinus tachycardia with ST elevations in III and
V1-V3 with reciprocal depressions in I and aVL.  No prior EKG
available for comparison. Post-cath EKG notable for continued ST
elevations in V1-V2, III and depressions in I and aVL.
.
TELEMETRY demonstrated: sinus tach with frequent PVCs; episode
of VFib on admission to CCU
.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2181-10-6**] demonstrated:  non-dominant
RCA, no CAD in LMCA, LAD, or LCx; balloon dilation of proximal
RCA, re-stenosed, finally re-inflated with placement of BMS.

HEMODYNAMICS: RA 17 PCWP 17 PA 25  Fick CO 6.87, CI 2.90 on day

.
CT C/A/P ([**2181-10-6**]):
CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  There is no evidence of traumatic
injury to the heart or great vessels and there is no evidence of
pericardial effusion. There is a small right pleural effusion.
No pathologically enlarged mediastinal, axillary or hilar lymph
nodes are observed.  There is a small axial hiatal hernia.  Lung
windows reveal atelectasis at the right base.  There is no
evidence of pneumothorax.  The airways appear patent to the
segmental level.
.
CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The liver, gallbladder, spleen,
adrenal glands and pancreas are unremarkable.  The kidneys
enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast normally and there is
no evidence of hydronephrosis or hydroureter. Hypodense round
lesion near the mid pole of the right kidney measures 26 mm and
is likely a cyst.  Intra-abdominal loops of large and small
bowel are unremarkable and there is no free air, free fluid or
pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph
nodes.  The abdominal aorta is of normal caliber throughout.
.
CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The rectum, sigmoid colon and prostate
are
unremarkable.  A Foley is present within the bladder.  There is
no free fluid within the pelvis or pathologically enlarged lymph
nodes.
Bone windows reveal fractures of the right second through
seventh ribs.
.
CT C-Spine [**10-6**]:
A linear lucency at the anteroinferior corner of C5 likely
represents a small acute fracture.  No other fracture or
alignment abnormality is observed.  Vertebral body heights are
maintained.  The atlanto-occipital and atlantoaxial
articulations are maintained.
.
CT Head [**10-6**]:
1.  No intracranial hemorrhage or edema.
2.  Complex comminuted fractures involving the nasal bones and
nasal septum with edema and hemorrhage as described.
.
CT Head [**10-8**]:
Compared with the prior head CT scan, there is no indication of
interval development of an intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect,
shift of
normally midline structures, or visible major vascular
territorial infarction. The present study suggests the
possibility of a punctate chronic lacunar-type infarct within
the right cerebellar hemisphere.  A commensurate scan was not
obtained so on the previous study, making it difficult to
determine whether this finding has actually developed in the two
days between scans, or more likely was present previously, but
obscured by partial volume artifact. Certainly, there is
considerably more soft tissue opacification of multiple
paranasal sinuses, largely due to the presence of intrasinus
hemorrhage. There are no other new extracranial abnormalities
discerned.
CONCLUSION:  No new intracranial hemorrhage identified.
.
CT chest/abdomen/pelvis [**10-8**]:
1.  Multiple right-sided rib fractures.
2.  Right-sided lung effusion, which has slightly increased
since the previous CT exam.
3.  New bilateral lung lobe collapse.
4.  Persistent bilateral renal enhancement on the non-contrast
study
suggesting an element of ATN.
5.  No intra-abdominal or pelvic injury similar to the prior
[**2181-10-6**] CT.
.
CT sinus mandible [**10-8**]:
There is a massively comminuted nasal bone fracture bilaterally,
and as indicated in your history, comminuted fracture also
involving the nasal
septum, as well as the anterior nasal spine.  There is a 3 mm
osseous fragment which app
