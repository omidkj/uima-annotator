Service:  MED


CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Respiratory distress.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 50-year-old female, with a
history of COPD, pulmonary hypertension on home O2, with
reported baseline SATs of 93-95 percent on 2 liters, a
history of prior intubation in [**7-26**] for hypocapnic
respiratory failure complicated by a MRSA pneumonia.  Prior
ABG's from OMR suggest that a baseline gas is pH 7.33, PCO2
59, PO2 68.  The patient had last been previously admitted in
[**2160-2-24**] with a presumed COPD flare with negative CTA
for PE, and was treated with a short course of BIPAP,
steroids and doxycycline.  Over the last 2 or 3 days, the
patient reports increased dyspnea with exertion.  Usually
wears home O2 just in the evening, but over the last couple
of days has begun to use it constantly.  Has increased her
MDI use, begun using nebs 2 days ago.  She reports fever the
last 24 hours, and also admits to positive sick contacts,
notably her husband with a URI.  She has a chronic,
nonproductive cough which is unchanged over the last several
days.  Denies chest pain.  Positive consistently a smoker [**1-25**]
to 1 pack per day since [**2160-1-24**].

Arrived in the ED and found to be hypoxic to 86 percent on 3
liters.  Tachycardic to 120's.  Ruled out for PE by CTA which
showed a question of atypical pneumonia.  She had a white
cell count which was elevated to 15,000 with a left shift,
and was febrile to 100.5.  She got Levaquin 500 mg x 1, Solu-
Medrol 125, and nebulizers.  She had a gas which showed a pH
of 7.34, PCO2 64, PO2 46.  Subsequently started on BIPAP.
After a temporary desaturation to 70 percent with ambulation,
we switched to 8 and 8 with subsequent gas 7.35, 66, 54.
Subsequently taken off BIPAP with ABG of 7.31, 70, 54 on 28
percent face mask.  Currently, the patient complaining of
mild shortness of breath slightly worse than her baseline,
but improved since arrival in the ED.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  COPD.  No PFT's in system, but history
of prior intubations as per HPI.

COPD on home O2.  Again, no documentation, but patient
reports receiving 2 liters usually in the evening time.

Mild pulmonary hypertension.

Polycythemia.

MRSA cellulitis from peripheral IV.

MEDICATIONS AS OUTPATIENT:
1. Albuterol MDI prn.
2. Flovent 2 puffs [**Hospital1 **].
3. DuoNeb q 4 prn.


ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She has a 60-pack year history.  Still
smoking 1 pack per day.  Lives with husband and 3 kids, and
retired.

EXAM:  Temperature 99.6, blood pressure 134/65, pulse 101,
mildly tachypneic at 16-20's, 88 percent on 40 percent face
mask.  She was in mild respiratory distress but able to speak
in complete sentences.
HEENT:  Unremarkable.  JVP is within normal limits.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  She is tachycardic but regular.
LUNGS:  Significant for marked decreased air movement with
expiratory wheezing and bibasilar crackles.
ABDOMINAL EXAM:  Benign.
EXTREMITIES:  Show 1 plus pitting edema.
NEUROLOGICAL:  Grossly intact.

LABORATORIES:  White count 15.5.  Of note, it was 14,000 in
[**2-27**].  Hematocrit 52.  Also of note, that has been
consistent with previous lab values starting in [**Month (only) 956**] of
this year.  Platelet count 182.  Chemistries:  139, 4.2,
chloride 97, bicarb 32, BUN 12, creatinine 0.5, glucose 104.
She had a chest x-ray which showed a question of old
bibasilar patchy infiltrates, essentially unchanged from
[**2160**].  She had a CAT scan which was negative for PE, but did
diffuse bilateral opacities consistent with an atypical
pneumonia, and also reactive lymphadenopathy.  She had an EKG
which showed a sinus tach to 120 beats per minute with right
and left atrial abnormalities.  No ST or T wave changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
1. PULMONARY:  The patient admitted for mildly increased
   respiratory distress and then found to be with moderate to
   severe hypoxia.  The exact etiology of her hypoxia is
   unclear.  It is presumed that she does have reasonably
   moderate to severe COPD.  Furthermore, it is likely that
   the patient is chronically hypoxic, but has become quite
   adaptive to this, as evidenced by her polycythemia.
   Furthermore, it is unclear if the patient was far off her
   baseline in terms of her oxygen requirement.  During her
   hospital admission, the patient was treated empirically
   with a 7-day course of Levaquin.  Of note, her chest x-ray
   and CT did not clearly indicate an active infection.  She
   was started on Solu-Medrol and later switched to
   prednisone which will be tapered, which is due to be
   completed on [**7-4**].  She received aggressive treatment
   with nebulizers, both Atrovent and albuterol, q 4 h.  In
   addition, she was started on BIPAP which she will be going
   home with.  Her current settings at this point are 14 and
   8.  She will require a formal sleep evaluation to finalize
   her BIPAP plans.  Meanwhile, her oxygen requirements will
   need to be titrated to her activity levels.  At the time
   of dictation, the patient was satting well on 2 liters
   nasal cannula with rest, but studies with ambulation
   suggest that the patient may require up to 3-4 liters to
   supply goal oxygen level between 88 to 91/92 percent.

She was started on nicotine transdermal patches, and has been
encouraged and advised on several occasions that she must
quit tobacco use.  It also has been recommended that the
patient will need follow-up with the pulmonologist, and also
could benefit from some outpatient pulmonary rehab to
reinforce the importance of compliance with medications, and
avoidance of tobacco.  As mentioned above, it is unclear as
to the complete etiology of her hypoxia.  It is felt that her
COPD does play a strong role.  A PE was ruled out by CTA.
Furthermore, a preliminary echo with bubble studies indicate
that the patient does not have an atrial septal defect, or
PFO which could cause a profound shunt and hypoxia.

1. CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient remained hemodynamically
   stable during her hospital course.  She was not felt to be
   in CHF as the cause of her hypoxia.  As mentioned above,
   she had had preliminary echocardiogram with bubble studies
   which did not indicate a true interatrial shunt or PFO.
   At the time of this dictation, it is planned that the
   patient may undergo additional testing to rule this
   phenomenon out.

1. HEMATOLOGY:  As mentioned above, the patient has a new
   polycythemia since [**Month (only) 956**] of this year.  It is felt, at
   this time, that the most likely etiology is her severe
   hypoxia, which is being worked up, as above, via sleep
   studies and echocardiograms ruling out shunts.

1. INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient came in with low-grade
   fevers and mildly elevated white blood cell count, and has
   been treated with Levaquin for a 7-day course for empiric
   purposes.

1. GI ISSUES:  None.

1. RENAL/FEN/ENDO:  The patient's fingerstick's were well-
   controlled with sliding scale.  She has been started on
   Vitamin D and calcium for prophylaxis, given her history
   of steroids, and also just her history of tobacco and
   obesity.  Her renal function has remained stable.

1. CODE:  At this point, the patient wishes to remain on full
   code.  She would be amenable to being intubated.


DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease/question of exacerbation, improving.

Polycythemia.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Fair.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Levaquin 500 mg qd for a 7-day course to be completed on
   [**6-25**].
2. Senokot prn.
3. Serevent 1 puff [**Hospital1 **].
4. Nicotine patch 14 mg qd for 6 weeks.
5. Pepcid 20 [**Hospital1 **] x 10 days
6. Albuterol and Atrovent nebs prn.
7. Prednisone 40 mg qd until [**6-25**].  Prednisone 30 mg qd from
   [**6-26**] to [**6-28**].  Prednisone 20 mg qd from [**6-29**] to [**7-1**].
   Prednisone 10 mg qd from [**7-2**] to [**7-4**].
8. Vitamin D 400 mg qd.
9. Calcium 500 mg tid.

As mentioned above, the patient will also be going home on
BIPAP which is being arranged at the time of dictation.  In
addition, i
