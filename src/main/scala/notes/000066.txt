Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
TCA Overdose, Depression

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
This is a 22F with a history of polysubstance abuse and
depression who now presents after an ingestion of pills. The
history was gathered from her father and cousin. [**Name (NI) **] was in
her usual state of health at 7am on morning of admission and
when she reported to family that she had just ingested 14
Doxepin pills. She became nauseated and mentioned she needed to
vomit. She had a change in mental status, becoming confused and
the father carried her into the car and drove her to the
emergency department at [**Hospital6 **]. Initial
vitals were t99.1 111/67 130 14 100 RA. ECG was noted to be
without signs of TCA toxicity and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further evaluation. At [**Hospital1 18**], vitals initially p 110 bp
130/70 28 98 4L. She was noted to be somnolent and was intubated
for airway protection and to get head CT. Toxicology consultant
evaluated the patient in the ED and recommended serial ECGs and
monitoring in MICU.
.
In the MICU ([**2102-6-3**]), the patient was sedated with propofol
20-100 mcg/kg/min IV drip and was unresponsive. On the floor,
initial MICU vitals were 97.1, 121/84, 81, 100% (intubated).
Toxicology screen was positive for cocaine, methadone, and
tricyclics. EKGs were monitored Q1 hr; no abnormalities
including QT or QRS elongation were seen. No intracranial
process was seen on CT, and CXR was within normal limits. She
remained stable overnight. On morning of HD #2, patient was
extubated and EKGs remained WNL. Potassium (2.8) was repleted.
Psychiatry was consulted and diagnosed polysubstance abuse,
major depression (r/o PTSD), and believe that it is still unsafe
for her to be discharged.  They started patient on Valium 5 mg
PO tid/prn for anxiety and Seroquel 25-50mg po tid/prn for
agitation; in addition, they recommended a 1:1 sitter.  At this
time, she was transferred to SIRS service.  On the floor, she
denied any chest pains, shortness of breath, palpatations,
suicidal or homicidal ideations, and reports that she did not
intend to kill herself, but was trying to use them for sleep.

Past Medical History:
-Asthma as a child, and has a home nebulizer which she never

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT.

FINDINGS: Evaluation is slightly limited by patient motion
artifact. There
is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass effect or
infarction.
Ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration. There
is no
fracture. Inspissated secretions in the posterior nasopharynx
likely reflect
the patient's intubated status.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

CHEST, SINGLE VIEW: An ET tube tip terminates 4.4 cm above the
carina. An NG
tube and sidehole projects below the diaphragm in the left upper
quadrant.
Heart size and cardiomediastinal contours are normal. There is
no focal
airspace opacification. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. No
gross osseous
abnormalities.

IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process. ETT and NGT in
appropriate
position.



Brief Hospital Course:
# TCA overdose: Patient presents with intoxication of doxepin;
toxicology screen was positive for methadone, TCAs, and cocaine.
Patient states that last methadone dose was x2 weeks ago and she
took suboxone x2 days prior to admission.  Patient was initially
admitted to the medical ICU where she was intubated to secure
the airway, serial EKGs were done (all showed NSR without
abnormalities), and patient was monitored.  On HD #2, patient
was extubated, and was monitored for symptoms of hypotension,
palpatations, chest pain, or any other symptoms of TCA
intoxication. EKGs remained normal throughout MICU course
without arrythmias. She was then transferred to the medicine
services after patient's peak for toxic symptoms were over
(active metabolites 12-24 hours), EKGs remained normal
throughout the course, and she exhibited no symptoms upon
discharge.
.
# Psychiatric Status: Patient was seen by psychiatric in the
MICU for questionable suicidal ideation. The patient denied any
suicidal or homicidal ideation, and repeatedly wanted to go
home.  Psychiatry reported that she has polysubstance abuse,
depression, and borderline personality.  She was given Valium,
Seroquel, and Ibuprofen PRN for anxiety, agitation, and possible
opiate withdrawal.  She had 1:1 sitter throughout her hospital
stay. Upon discharge, she was counseled on depression and an
appointment was made for outpatient psychiatric care near her
home.
.
#Anemia: Patient presented with hematocrit of 31.5 (baseline
unknown), with microcytic features and wide RDW. Iron levels are
low (20) with low TIBC (257), and her low MCV (68) do not
suggest a complete iron deficiency picture. Iron deficiency
alone is unlikely to cause such a microcytosis picture,
therefore her anemia could be secondary to a mixed etiology of
minor thalassemia (microcytosis of 68) and iron deficiency.  She
was started on iron supplementation and outpatient care for
follow-up for her anemia.
.
#Elevated WBC and fever: The patient had elevated WBC (20) and
low-grade fever 100.4 in the MICU, but trended down while
admitted to the medicine floor (WBC 12, temp 98.2).  She has no
indication of infection as she clinically has no syptoms of
fevers/chills and does not feel overall unwell; in addition, CXR
shows no abnormalities.  The most likely etiology was s/p MICU
extubation and stress response.
