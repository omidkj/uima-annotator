HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 64 year old female with
Parkinson's, status post CVA and COPD, who was recently admitted
to [**Hospital 87525**] Hospital for unresponsiveness and hypotension.
During that admission her blood cultures were positive for
Klebsiella and Proteus.  She was found to have thickening of the
colon, splenic flexure and colonoscopy showed colitis.  She was
presumed to have ischemic bowel as the cause of sepsis.  The
patient does report a history of bloody diarrhea for about a week
and the stool has been negative for C. diff.  During that
hospital course she required pressors including Dopamine and Neo-
Synephrine and was initially treated with Imipenem, Vancomycin
which was then switched to p.o. Levofloxacin and Flagyl.  Her
course was also complicated by new onset atrial fibrillation
which spontaneously converted. She was discharged on [**6-9**] on a
full liquid diet to the nursing home from which she came.

At the nursing home she developed sudden onset of shortness of
breath and desatted to the 70's.  The patient stated that the
episode was acute and no preceded by fevers, coughing or chest
pain.  She was treated with morphine, Lasix and nitrates without
any change in the symptoms.  She was transferred back to
[**Hospital 87525**] Hospital where she was intubated.  At the time of
admission she was noted to have mottled and bruised left upper
extremity.  She underwent left upper extremity doppler which was
negative though by the time study was performed her arm has
turned pink and warm again. She was extubated one day after
admission and did relatively well.  A CT at that time showed no
pulmonary embolus.  She was transferred to our facility at the
request of the family.

Currently the patient denies any chest pain, shortness of breath,
abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting.  She does have some mild
headache as well as continuing diarrhea.

with residual right-sided weakness.  3. COPD.  4. Anxiety.
5. Depression.  6. History of aspiration pneumonia.  7.
Borderline diabetes mellitus in the past.  8. Hypertension.

MEDICATIONS:  Levofloxacin 500 p.o. q.d., Flagyl 500 p.o. q8,
magnesium oxide 400 p.o. q.d., potassium chloride 40 mEq p.o.
q.d., Megace 800 mg p.o. q.d.,  Effexor 37.5 p.o. b.i.d.,

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a resident of Life Cove Center,
has 8 children, daughter [**Name (NI) 1356**] is a health care proxy.  The
patient is unable to ambulate secondary to Parkinson's, stroke,
uses a wheelchair.  She is a prior smoker about 30 pack years.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.3, pulse 100, blood
pressure 125/70, respiratory rate 22, satting 90% on room
air, 95 on 2 liters.  In general, alert female, alert and
oriented.  HEENT: Oropharynx is clear, moist mucous
membranes.  Neck: Supple, no lymphadenopathy, no JVD.  Lungs:
Fair air movement with no crackles or wheezes.
Cardiovascular: S1, S2, II/VI soft crescendo decrescendo
murmur in the right upper sternal border, no gallops, no rub.
Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended, there is no liver
edge, no peritoneal signs.  Stool is brown, guaiac positive.
Extremities show no edema and poor distal pulses.
Neurological exam is mild left eyelid droop, bilateral
contractures in the upper extremities.  Strength in the lower
extremities appears [**4-1**] but per daughter apparently unchanged
from past.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission included white count of 17.2,
hematocrit 33, platelets 308.  INR 3.8.  Unremarkable Chem-7.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1. Respiratory failure.  The patient did
relatively well from respiratory standpoint here.  She was mostly
comfortable, breathing on room air and only occasionally
requiring oxygen at night.  On admission it was somewhat unclear
what caused the initial insult.  The 2 possibilities include
mucous plugging and aspiration.  To further elucidate the
possibility of aspiration a consultation with Speech and Swallow
was obtained and after a video swallow study the feelings of the
speech and swallow team was that the patient is not at a
particularly high risk for aspiration.  In this context,
therefore, it is most likely that he had a mucus plug which had
led to transient lung collapse necessitating intubation.

To prevent further mucus plugging the patient was started on
chest physical therapy and will need chest PT while at the
nursing home to prevent further mucus plugging.  She had no
wheezing at any point on exam.  The patient was continued on her
outpatient dose inhalers for her chronic COPD.

2. Ischemic colitis.  The patient was continued on p.o.
evofloxacin and Flagyl which she will require until [**6-18**]. She
continued to have occasional diarrhea during the stay but no
other complaints.  She was able to take relatively good p.o. with
no significant problems and no abdominal pain.

3. Parkinson's.  Stable from Parkinson's standpoint, continued on
Sinemet and Baclofen.

4. Hypertension.  Tenormin was held on admission but restarted
during transfer to regular Floor; blood pressure in good control.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable and same as prior to admission.
Discharged to [**Hospital **] nursing home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  1. Respiratory failure requiring
intubation.  2. Mucus plugging.  3. Ischemic colitis.  4.
Parkinson's.  5. Hypertension.
