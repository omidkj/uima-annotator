History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 64 year old spanish speaking male from [**Male First Name (un) 1056**] with
history of DM, AF and CHF in the past who presented to [**Hospital1 **] on
[**8-22**] with CP, dyspnea and palpitations.  Over the past month
patient had reported several times to local hospitals in [**Country **]
[**Country **].  Pt had several complaints including chest pain, SOB,
fatigue, hernia pain.  However he was never admitted there and
sent home with unknown meds.  Family was unhappy with care so
took patient out of hospital and brought back to Mass.  He
arrived to Mass on [**2122-8-18**].  He was then admitted to [**Hospital1 2519**] on [**2122-8-21**].  There he was found to be in heart failure
and afib.  Reportedly he was on  Coumadin prior to admission
which he stopped on his own 1 month ago d/t ecchymosis.  BNP was
2900 on admission.  He was treated with Lasix and diuresed.
There he had an 18 beat run of VT with multiple pauses, up to 4
seconds long. Lidocaine was started and VT did not recur. Echo
done today shows global hk, 3+ MR, EF 30%.  Ruled out for an MI.
Received Lovenox 80mg at 8am today.  Aspirin 325mg given this
am.  Not on Plavix.
.
Pt has a heavy alcohol history drinking about 1 liter vodka per
day for 30 years.  Last drink was reportedly 2-3 weeks. ago.  No
history of withdrawals or seizures.
.
In the cath lab, he was noted to have R dominant system, with
normal coronaries.  Right heart cath with swan placement showed
PCWP 32, with significant elevated V wave at 52.  His PAP 60/30
(38).
.
On floor, patient denied any pain.  He did complain of slight
SOB, worse with laying down.  Denied cough, fevers/chills,
abdominal pain, nausea/vomitting.  +BMs (loose).

[**2122-8-27**]: Left femoral Ultrasound:
In the left groin, the left common femoral artery and left
common femoral vein are identified. A vessel is seen to extend
from the artery superiorly to a vascular structure which
demonstrates aliasing. This measures 3.3 cm in maximum
transverse x 2 cm in maximum AP x 3.3 cm in sagittal dimension.
Some thrombus is seen in this lesion. The appearances are
consistent with a pseudoaneurysm of the left groi
