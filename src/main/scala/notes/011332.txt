History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo female with PMH HTN, Afib s/p pacer now being evaluated
s/p presumed Vfib arrest. History limited but per daughter, pt
report USOH with exception of mild increased fatigue, dizziness
x several weeks. Apparently, pacer battery was changed on [**11-10**]
[**1-25**] low battery. Today, the pt drove from home in [**Location (un) 13040**] to
[**Location (un) **] to visit daughter-in-law. Apparently pt was sitting
with daughter after lunch when she became unresponsive with
"eyes rolled behind" head. Episode began at 1315. Daughter
called 911 and started CPR; no pulse initially. Pt was
unresponsive for 3-4 minutes. [**Location (un) **] fire department arrived
and monitor reported WCT (reported to be Vfib), shockable
rhythm, and pt defibrillated x 1 with reported return to sinus
tachy with palpable pulse. EMS arrived shortly thereafter and
found pt with perfusing rhythm. Pt had a couple episodes of VT.
Pt was bolused with lidocaine and started on drip. Intubated was
attempted x 3 for airway protection, but failed.
.
Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. Had traumatic intubation in ED,
after multiple attempts finally intubated. She was
hemodynamically stable with O2sat 99%. ABG of 7.22/70/97. K of
4.0. Started on amio drip preceded by bolus. Stat bedside echo
showed no focal wall motion abnormalities, reported preserved LV
function with moderate MR/AI and pulmonary hypertension.
Interrogation of pacer showed Afib with rapid ventricular rate,
but unable to locate clear VT/VF episode with the exception of
an episode with a rate in 300s. Intermittent with Afib were
bursts of pacing to 120s-130s. There was a concern for
subcutaneous emphysema in the neck given traumatic intubation.
Chest/neck CT showed perforation of trachea with marked
subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum.
.
Per daughter, no recent CP/SOB/n/v/abd pain

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: [**Age over 90 **] yo female with PMH HTN, Afib s/p pacer
adm wtih episode of unresponsiveness/syncope thought to be
secondary to cardiac arrest.
.
1. ?Posturing/syncopal episode: Unclear if secondary to VFA,
rapid afib, or brainstem stroke. Per neuro, findings on neuro
exam were worrisome for brainstem injury secondary to
hypotensive stroke. Other possibility is diffuse anoxic brain
injury. EEG performed indicated encephalopathy. Repeat head CT
showed no evidence of bleed or mass effect.
.
Regarding cardiogenic causes of syncope, arrythmia is very
likely. Interrogation of pacer shows several episodes of Vtach,
which could be etiology of syncope; however, the timing of Vtach
does not correlate with time of syncope. Rapid afib is also a
possibility since pt seems to have had episodes of rapid afib
around time of syncope. Pt has valvular abnormalities on echo.
Ischemia unlikely given negative cardiac enzymes. Pt was taken
off sedation to follow neuro exam. On HD2, pt became aggitated
and was given propofol. Pt also began to respond to voice and
some commands.  She was slowly weaned off of all sedating
medications and began to respond to basic commands.
.
She was extubated when her RSVI was less than 100.  However her
respiratory status and mental status worsened over the course of
the day and following night.  The following day she was
re-intubated for respiratory support.  She was fighting the vent
and sedated with Propofol.  She required Neo, Levo, and Dopa to
maintain her blood pressure.  Overnight her creatinine continued
to increased, her Lactate trended upward, her LFTs were
elevated.  The following morning her family decided to withdraw
care as she was doing worse and they felt that she would not
have wanted the level of care being performed.  She expired
shortly after.
.
2. Rhythm: Question of Vfib arrest per EMT report. Vtach and
rapid afib seen on pacer. Vtach may be potential cause of
cardiac arrest. Pt was continued on IV amio. Digoxin was
discontinued. On HD2, pt was noted to be tachycardic in the
setting of hypotension immediately after being given propofol
for agitation. Pt was restarted on beta-blocker: metoprolol 5mg
IV q6h for rate control. She was continued on Amiodarone and
beta blocker (briefly on an Esmolol drip) however her rate was
difficult to control with continued afib with RVR.
.
3. ?CHF: Pt had preserved EF by initial echo. Pt is most likely
volume overloaded from chest x-ray. She was given small dose of
lasix for diuresis.  On hospital day 4 she was febrile with
decreased urine output she was given IV fluids.
.
4. Hypotension: On HD2, pt developed hypotension and tachycardia
immediat
