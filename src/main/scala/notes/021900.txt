History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 77-year-old female with unstable anginal
symptoms and a troponin leak was brought  emergently to the cath

[**2150-7-16**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Selective angiography of this right dominant system revealed
left
main and two vessel CAD. The LMCA had a distal 60% stenosis. The
LAD had
a 99% ostial stenosis with TIMI 1 flow beyond the lesion. It
supplied
two small-caliber diagonal branches which were free of
angiographically
apparent flow-limiting disease. The LCx had moderate diffuse
disease
throughout its course and supplied three obtuse marginal
branches. The
first OM was free of obstructive disease. The second and third
OMs were
small in caliber, and the second had mild diffuse disease. The
RCA was a
dominant vessel that had a focal 80% stenosis in its proximal
portion.
The remainder of the vessel was free of significant disease.
2. Resting hemodynamic measurements revealed normal left and
right-sided
filling pressures, with a mean RA of 3, RVEDP of 6, mean PCWP of
9, mean
PA of 14, and LVEDP of 22 mm Hg. Central arterial pressure was
normal at
124/59 (mean 58) mm Hg. The cardiac index as calculated by the
Fick
equation was normal at 2.56 L/min/m2. After coronary
angiography, the
patient's PA pressure increased to a mean of 28 mm Hg. There was
no
gradient across the aortic valve upon catheter pullback from the
LV to
the ascending aorta.
3. Left ventriculography revealed global hypokinesis with more
severe
hypokinesis in the anterolateral wall. No mitral regurgitation
was
visualized. The ejection fraction was approximately 30%.
4. Placement of a 7 French 30 cc intra-aortic ballooon pump was
performed in the right femoral artery.

[**2150-7-17**] ECHO
1. There is severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed. [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the
severity of
valvular regurgitation.] Resting regional wall motion
abnormalities include anterior, septal, inferior apical akinesis
with the rest of the LV being hypokinetic.
2.Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
3.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis or
regurgitation present.
4.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**2-8**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
5.There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.
7. There is an echogenic density in the right ventricle
consistent with a
pulmonary arterial catheter.

[**2150-7-21**] ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There
is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction. LV
systolic function appears depressed. Resting regional wall
motion abnormalities include mid to distal anteroseptal and
apical akinesis. The apex is not fully visualized. No apical
thrombus identified but cannot exclude. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened with focal thickening of the
noncoronary cusp. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a very small
pericaridal effusion with no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

Although the region of the right A-V groove appeared prominent
in some views, supplemental views with and without saline
contrast revealed no extrinsic or intrinsic right heart mass.

[**2150-7-19**] CXR
The patient is status post CABG and median sternotomy. The
patient has been extubated. The right jugular Swan-Ganz catheter
terminates in the main PA. No pneumothorax is identified.

There is continued mild congestive heart failure with
cardiomegaly and small bilateral pleural effusion. There is
continued bibasilar patchy atelectasis.

[**2150-7-27**] Holter Monitor
     Long-term ECG monitoring was performed using a
Continuous-Loop
Recorder ("[**Doctor Last Name **] of Hearts") to evaluate this patient with
history of
ventricular tachycardia, on a drug trial of Amiodarone 400 mg
daily.
Other reported medications include ASA 81 mg daily, Metoprolol
25 mg
twice daily, Lisinopril 5 mg daily, and Furosemide 20 mg daily.

     The baseline recording was sinus with rates ranging from 63
to 65
BPM without ectopy. Non-diagnostic T wave inversion was seen.
The
baseline intervals were as follows: at a rate of 65 BPM, the QT
was .44
(upper limits), the QRS was .09 and the PR was .19 (both within
normal
limits).

     A total of 15 daily recordings were transmitted. The
recordings
showed sinus rhythm with rates of 49 to 69 BPM with 1 isolated
APB.
Non-diagnostic T wave inversion was present (Strip #9).

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2150-7-16**]. She was taken
to the cardiac catheterization lab where she was found to have
severe left main and three vessel disease. An IABP was placed
for coronary perfusion. Due to the severity of her disease, the
cardiac surgical service was consulted. Ms. [**Known lastname **] was taken
urgently to the operating room on [**7-16**]/-5 where she underwent
coronary artery bypass grafting to three vessels.
Postoperatively she was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive
care unit for monitoring. An echocardiogram was obtained due to
hypotension which did not show any tamponade. Her IABP was
slowly weaned and removed on postoperative day two. She then
awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. On postoperative
day three, Ms. [**Known lastname **] developed ventricular fibrillation
requiring defibrillation. Amiodarone was started and her
magnesium was repleted. She again developed ventricular
fibrillatory arrest on two other occasions requiring
defibrillation back into normal sinus rhythm. She continued to
have runs
