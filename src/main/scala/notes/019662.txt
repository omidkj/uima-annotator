Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line placement


History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 80 year old male with a history of severe
COPD, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, spinal stenosis,
AFib/flutter, and CHF with EF 59%.  He had a recent
hospitalization for CAP/aspiration pneumonia, and a recent
Levofloxacin course for bronchitis.  He presents with a
worsening rhonchorous cough, SOB, and fatigue.
.
He was recently admitted from [**Date range (3) 100816**] with a 9 day ICU
stay for LLL pneumonia treated with Levofloxacin.  He was also
diuresed during his stay, as some component of his symptoms were
thought to be due to CHF in the setting of aggressive volume
resuscitation for hypotension.  His course was complicated by
AFib with RVR and hypotension.  He is not sure when he came home
from rehab but he thinks it has been several weeks.  He is
currently at home with his wife and has home [**Name (NI) 269**].
.
Dr. [**Known lastname **] reports that he came to the ED today for worsening SOB
and fatigue.  He reports a cough that worsened over the last day
or so.  He presented on [**2183-8-4**] to his PCP with complaints of a
cough and was treated for possible new bronchitis with
Levofloxacin 250 mg QD x 7 days.  The patient reports
improvement in his cough after the antibiotics but his symptoms
have since recurred (he cannot say the exact date of when this
recurred).  He feels chest congestion but has a hard time
mobilizing his secretions.  He denies fevers, sore throat, runny
nose.
.
Of note, the patient reports frequent falls with spinal stenosis
causing left leg weakness.  His last fall was a witnessed fall
three days ago when he fell onto his back.  He also reports
periodic abdominal pain and diarrhea with a history of UC.  His
last bout of abdominal pain was when he fell.  He currently
denies abdominal pain, bloody stools, diarrhea, melena and N/V.
.
In the ED, VS were initially T 96.7, BP 159/89, HR 90, RR 22,
SpO2 100% on 2L NC.  Repeat BP measurements showed a dropping
SBP from 90 to 70.  He was bolused with 1L NS and had
improvement in his SBP to 100.  He was given a dose of
Levofloxacin as well as Vancomycin for pus draining from his
left antecubital fossa distal to an area of thrombophlebitis
(noted in out-pateint records).  He was also given Combivent
nebulizer with improvement in his symptoms.

CKD; best Cr recently was 1.2), BUN 54, WBC 16.3 with 4% bands,
Hct 29.1 (recent baseline in low 30's); urine lytes with Na 15,
Osm 368
.
ADMISSION EKG: apaced, regular, HR 79, QRS 126, no ST changes

of left hemidiaphragm, though not significantly worse than film
from [**2183-6-6**]
.

[**2183-8-26**] UE ultrasound:
1) Thrombosed basilic vein with surrounding peripheral
inflammatory change
consistent with thrombophlebitis.
2) Track extending from the skin surface at the more inferior
punctate focus into the subcutaneous tissues. No drainable
collection.

[**2183-8-26**] CT chest w/o contrast:
Bilateral lower lobe consolidation, worse on the left.
Moderately large left pleural effusion. No endobronchial
obstructive lesion shown. The patient should be followed up with
a chest radiograph in 4 weeks, to ensure resolution. Esophageal
distension with food debris in the lower esophagus indicating
risk of aspiration. Incidental finding of new superior endplate
collapse of T10 and T12, healed right rib fractures and
non-healed left tenth rib fracture.

ESOPHAGUS	Study Date of [**2183-8-27**] 1:25 PM
COMPARISON: CT chest, [**2183-8-26**].
FINDINGS: Barium passes into the esophagus without obstruction.
There is a stagnant column of barium within the distal
esophagus. Barium does traverse into the stomach; however,
passage is delayed without evidence of a physical obstruction.
There are poor peristaltic contractions with significant
tertiary contractions noted. Due to the high residue remaining
in the esophagus and risk of aspiration, full esophagram was not
completed; however, there was no evidence of significant hiatal
hernia or Schatzki's ring on this examination. The high residual
content within the esophagus could put the patient at risk for
aspiration during reflux episodes when recumbent or with
coughing.
IMPRESSION: Poor peristaltic contractions with significant
tertiary contractions representing esophageal dysmotility with
significant residue remaining in the esophagus that would put
the patient at risk for aspiration events.

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW	Study Date of [**2183-8-27**] 1:29 PM
TECHNIQUE: Oropharyngeal video fluoroscopy was conducted in
conjunction with the speech and swallow division. Multiple
consistencies of barium were administered with the patient in
the right lateral position.
FINDINGS: Barium passes through the oropharynx without evidence
of obstruction. There is slow oral phase with frequent spillover
and high residue in the valleculae. There was aspiration and
penetration with thin liquid barium. There was penetration with
nectar-thickened barium and no gross aspiration or penetration
with thick barium or barium-coated solids. On glands down into
the esophagus, there was still significant residue from the
patient's recent barium esophagram. For further details, please
see the speech and swallow division note in the online medical
record.
IMPRESSION: Gross aspiration and penetration with thin liquids.
Penetration with nectar-thickened liquids. No aspiration or
penetration with thick barium or barium-coated solids.
Significant residue noted in the esophagus that has a tendency
to reflux when the patient coughs.

CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT	Study Date of [**2183-8-27**] 8:50 PM
FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**8-25**], there has been
placement of a right subclavian PICC line that extends to the
lower portion of the SVC near
