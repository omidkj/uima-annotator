Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2132-11-28**] - Attempted but unsuccessful transesophageal
echocardiogram with cardioversion

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a PMH significant for
non-cardiomyopathy (LVEF 25%), failed endomyocardial biopsy at
[**Hospital1 112**] secondary to induction of complete heart block (which
resolved), anterior MI s/p BMS to LAD and moderate-to-severe MR
who was initially admitted to the [**Hospital1 1516**]-Cardiology service on
[**2132-11-16**] for chest pain found to be in new-onset atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate.
.
On the day of admission, the patient noted substernal chest
discomfort, described as a dull,non-radiating and not associated
with any dyspnea, N/V, lightheadedness, or palpitations. Patient
also denied any DOE, PND, orthopnea, ankle edema, syncope or
pre-syncope prior to admission. She denies any recent fevers or
chills; no cough or dysuria.
.
In the ED, patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with
RVR, rate in the 140s with a BP of 116/92. Of note, Labs on
admission were notable for a Troponin of 0.17, potassium of 3.1
and magensium of 1.7. She received IV Diltiazem, was started on
Heparin gtt, and was admitted for planned cardioversion. She
then spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm, and was started on
warfarin for anticoagulation. Hoewever, she converted back into
A.fib and was then started on Amiodarone on [**2132-11-19**]. LFTs
revealed a mild transaminitis.
.
Upon admission to the Medicine floor, her course has been
notable for elevated cardiac enzymes and presumed acute systolic
CHF exacerbation with worsening hyponatremia (to nadir of 117),
[**Last Name (un) **] (peak 1.9 from baseline 0.7-0.9), transaminitis (which
worsened with AST in the 6000s and ALT in the 3000 range;
Hepatology attributing this to congestive hepatopathy vs.
Amiodarone toxicity), and an Enterococcal UTI (sensitive to
Ampicillin, 7-day course planned). Cardiac enzymes were cycled
with a peak Troponin of 0.22, CK-MB 10. MB index was 3.2. She
was diuresed with Torsemide and Metolazone and was continued on
Metoprolol for rate control. The patient also had some issues
with bloody stools which was attributed to hemorrhoidal
bleeding; she received 2 units of FFP for an INR of 4.7 at that
time. The patient was noted to again spontaneoulsy convert to
NSR overnight on [**11-21**]. In the AM of [**11-22**], she acutely became
hypotension to the 60-70 mmHg systolic range, with HR of 40-50s.
They attributed this to over-duresis, for which she received
aggressive IVF resuscitation (3L IVF). She also received
Atropine x 1 without effect. An emergent central venous catheter
and EJ were placed on the Cardiology floor with a Dopamine gtt
started peripherally. She was transferred to the MICU on [**11-22**]
for further management.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient was awake on a NRB and answering
questions. She was continued on the Dopamine infusion, and
started on Vasopressin with initial improvement in her SBP to
110-120s and HR of 60 bpm. Antibiotics were broadened to
Vancomycin and Cefepmine IV. CVP was roughly 20, and aggressive
IVF administration ceased. Bedside 2D-Echo did not reveal a
pericardial effusion. In the setting of worsening mental status
status and poor perfusion she was switched to Dobutamine,
Levophed, and Vasopression gtts. A femoral A-line was placed,
after sveral attempts at a radial A-line were unsuccessful.
Patient was intubated in the setting of increased work of
breathing.
.
In the MICU, she was weaned off of Levophed gtt, started on 3
amps of sodium bicarbonate and Lasix IV was initiated for
diuresis. She was extubated on [**11-25**] without issues. She was
started on a Diltiazem gtt for A.fib with rapid ventricular
response with adequate rate control. The patient was transferred
to the CCU for further management.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or pre-syncope.
