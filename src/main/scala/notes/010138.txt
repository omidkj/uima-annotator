Right Chest tube placement


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 49058**] is a 46 yo M with PMH HTN, hyperlipidemia presenting
with dyspnea and abdominal pain. He reports that his symptoms
started on friday, 5 days prior to admission with nausea,
vomiting and diarrhea. The following morning he also noted onset
of shortness of breath as well as a nonproductive cough. He also
developed discomfort in the right side of his abdomen which he
believed was due to vomiting. Otherwise he reports feeling "hot
and cold". He denies any chest pain, lower extremity swelling,
dysuria, hematuria, sick contacts. [**Name (NI) **] reports presenting to the
hospital 4 days after onset of symptoms primarily due to
shortness of breath and abdominal discomfort with breathing.
.
Of note he reports that he had a physcial exam three weeks ago
with blood work which he reports was all normal. He denies any
history of kidney problems. [**Name (NI) **] does report 25 year history of
exposure to noxious chemicals including methylene chloride.
during his employment refinishing furniture.
.
He initially presented to [**Hospital3 1280**] Hospital. Initial vitals
were T: 98.1 P: 111 BP: 80/53 RR: 22 O2: 92% on RA. Laboratories
were notable for a WBC count of 7.2 with 74% polys and 9% bands.
CXR was concerning for a right middle and right lower lobe
consolidation. He received 2 liters normal saline, toradol 30 mg
IV, ceftriaxone 1 gram IV x 1, flagyl 500 mg IV x 1 and
levofloxacin 750 mg IV x 1. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management as there were no beds available in their ICU.

.
In the ED, initial vs were: T98.6 P107 BP90/61 R20 O2 sat 97% on
15L NRB. Patient was given a total of 7 L IVF for hypotension
and tachycardia with SBP as low as 80/50. Due to hives and
concern for allergic reaction to ceftriaxone at OSH he was also
given benadryl 50mg IV, pepcid 20mg IV. He was given levaquin
750mg IV. RIJ was placed in the ED with CVP of 19 following
placement. He was also started on neosynephrine which is at
1mcg/kg/min on arrival to the floor. He was noted to be in Afib
with RVR and was started on heparin gtt in the ED. Given the
patient reports of toxin exposures at work toxicology was
consulted in the Ed.

Images:
[**2198-2-28**] CXR: RIJ with tip terminating in right atrium, no
pneumothorax, right middle and lower lobe opacities with
associated right pleural effusion suspicous for pneumonia.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2198-3-1**] at 3:34:20 PM      FINAL
GENERAL COMMENTS: Resting tachycardia (HR>100bpm). The rhythm
appears to be atrial fibrillation.  The left atrium is normal in
size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis
(LVEF = 35 %). The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. There is
abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure overload. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity
is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate global left ventricular systolic
dysfunction. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2198-3-1**]
FINDINGS:
1. Multifocal consolidation and ground glass opacity, mostly in
the right lower lobe, consistent with multifocal pneumonia.
2. Moderate nonhemorrhagic right pleural effusion, mostly
superior to the consolidation, raising suspicion of loculation.
3. Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, likely reactive, should be
followed.
4. Mild emphysema.
5. Mild cardiomegaly. Possible anemia.
6. Fatty liver.
7. 13-mm right adrenal nodule, should be evaluated by MRI if not
already known.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 49058**] is a 46 year-old man with PMH HTN, hyperlipid, h/o
ETOH abuse who presented with septic shock, RLL pna, alcohol
withdrawal, and ARF, but improved with antibiotics and IV
fluids.

# Pneumonia/sepsis: He presented with sepsis secondary to a RLL
pneumonia that later developed into a multifocal pneumonia.  He
required ICU admission for sepsis and was intubated from
[**Date range (1) 68168**] for airway protection in the setting of alcohol
withdrawal and hypoxia.  He was also briefly on phenyephrine.
He also had a large right sided effusion, with diagnositic
thoracentesis consistent with complicated parapneumonic
effusion; a chest tube was later placed.  He was initially
treated with vanocmycin, levofloxacin, and aztreonam to cover
for community acquired pneumonia, but given areas of necrosis on
his chest x-ray, clindamycin was added.  As he improved, his
antibiotics were tapered to vancomycin, levofloxacin,  and
clindamycin.

# Acute Renal Failure: He was prerenal on admission with a
creatinine of 4.9 in the setting of sepsis, alcohol abuse, and
likely volume depletion.  His creatinine normalized with IVFs.

# Alcohol withdrawal:  He has a history of alcoholism and
experienced alcohol withdrawal 48 hours after admission,
requiring a CIWA and high doses of diazepam.  He was ultimately
intubated for airway protection in the setting of withdrawal as
described above.  After extubation, he no longer required a CIWA
scale.  Social work was consulted and arranged an alcohol rehab
day program, in which he agreed to participate.

# Atrial fibrillation:  He briefly developed AF while septic,
and this was thought to be secondary to a toxic-metabolic
syndrome.  He was briefly started on a heparin gtt in the ED
presumably in case of need for cardioversion given his
concurrent hypotension but he converted to sinus rhythm on
hospital day 3.  Because of his CHADS score of 1, he was started
on aspirin.  He remained in sinus rhythm for the remainder of
his hospital stay.

# Systolic dysfunction:  He was found to have
