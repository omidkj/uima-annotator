Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2932**]
Chief Complaint:
Right sided weakness and expressive aphasia with left frontal
brain mass


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Stereotactic left frontal lobe brain mass biopsy ([**2171-9-25**])

History of Present Illness:
80yo M with COPD, CAD s/p CABG, CVA s/p CEA, who was transferred
from OSH with intracranial mass with hemorrhage.  The patient
initially present to [**Doctor Last Name 38554**] Hospital following onset of
right sided weakness and difficulty speaking that had reportedly
developed over a week. The pt & family reported difficulty
walking and using right side. He had been unable to write and
noticed his hand has been shaking. He states his daughters
became concerned on the day of admission when they noticed his
speech was slurred and sent him to the ER. Pt reports falling
approximately two weeks ago but denies hitting his head. He went
to [**Hospital3 10310**] Hospital and then transferred here after a
head CT showed a possible left frontal mass with a the bleed.
Of note, pt has not gone to physcian for 4 years.
Pt endorses SOB w/cough which he is unsure is worse than
baseline. Denies fever/chills.  No chest pain/palpitations/[**Doctor Last Name **]

Pertinent Results:

[**9-10**] HEAD CT:
1. Large intraparenchymal hematoma in the left frontal lobe. The
finding could be a result of amyloid angiopathy or underlying
neoplasm.
2. Post-operative changes- see above report for findings.
3. Status post aneurysm repair, with evidence of a small
residual aneurysm in the left suprasellar cistern region.
.
[**9-13**] CT TORSO:
IMPRESSION:
1. Emphysema with spiculated 10 mm nodular opacity in right
lower lobe. Although this could be infectious or inflammatory in
etiology, given the emphysema, there is suspicion for primary
lung neoplasm. Short-term CT followup is recommended.
2. 4-cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. No evidence of
leak.
3. Right inguinal hernia w/ nonincarcerated/nonobstructed small
bowel.
4. Diverticulosis, without evidence of acute diverticulitis.
5. Air in the bladder. If there is a prior history of Foley
catheter placement, this could be a sequela. If not, correlate
with UA results as urinary tract infection is also possible.
6. Multiple thyroid nodules.
.
Head CT [**9-25**]: 1.  Expected post-biopsy changes surrounding the
large left superior frontal hemorrhagic mass with significant
surrounding vasogenic edema.  2.  New focus of subarachnoid
hemorrhage in the left parietal lobe.
.
Head CT [**2171-9-27**]: No change in the large hemorrhagic superior
left frontal lobe mass. The small amount of subarachnoid
hemorrhage along the left parietal lobe has evolved and now
appears isointense to [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter. No new intracranial
hemorrhage is noted. Stable vasogenic edema  as before.
.
[**2171-10-2**] CXR:
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**9-24**] and 29:
Lung volumes are lower. Irregular opacification of the lung
bases is atelectasis. This could be due to aspiration but does
not suggest pneumonia. Focal opacities in the right lung on two
previous studies are less obvious today and could represent
sparing of fissural pleural loculations.
Upper lungs demonstrate severe emphysema, right worse than left.
Heart is normal size. The vertical component of sternal wiring
shows several breaks, but no interval change. No pneumothorax
appreciable. Pleural effusion is present.
.
EKG [**9-10**]: NSR 80, nl intervals, 1 mm QW in III, RSR' in v2, flat
TW in v2, no ST changes, no prior EKG for comparison
.
Micro
[**9-10**] urine cx: enterococcus, pan sensitive except to
tetracycline
[**9-10**] bld cx x 2 negative
[**9-18**] sputum gram stain shows gram negative bacilli.

Brief Hospital Course:
80 yo M with CAD s/p CABG, HTN, CVA s/p CEA p/w PNA and COPD
exacerbation awaiting medical stabilization for bx of brain
mass.
.
Mestatic Carcinoma: The patient was transferred from
[**Doctor Last Name 38554**] Hospital for evaluation and management of his
left frontal mass.  He was admitted to the SICU and neurology
and neuro-onocology were consulted.  The patients right sided
weakness and expressive aphasia (which have persisted during his
hospitalization) were attributed to the left frontal mass.  The
patient underwent staging scans (given that the mass was
possibly metastatic).  The scans were remarkable for a 10mm
spiculated mass in the right lower lobe of the lung.  There were
also some thyroid nodules noted.  The patient underwent
sterotatic brain biopsy (with local anethesia only), with
pathology consistent revealed metastic carcinoma.  Though the
final pathologic stains have not yet been completed, the general
consensus is that the carcinoma is of lung origin.  Given the
patient's overall condition (with severe COPD,
pneumonia/probable aspiration pneumonitis), he was not
considered to be a surgical candidate--this was discussed at a
multidisciplinary meeting involving medicine, neurosurgery and
neuro-oncology.  Whole brain radiation was instead recommended
and the patient began this treatment, following consultation by
radiation oncology, on [**2171-10-2**].  The patient has tolerated the
first two sessions of whole brain irradiation well.  He is
scheduled to receive a total of 10 radiation treatments at [**Hospital 61**] [**Hospital **] Medical Center.  Med
