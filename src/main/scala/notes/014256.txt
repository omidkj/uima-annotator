Pertinent Results:
ABD CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. Marked bowel wall thickening throughout the ileum, with
extensive inflammatory stranding within the mesentery. This
appearance is consistent with mesenteric ischemia secondary to
superior mesenteric vein thrombosis. Of note, the jejunum and
colon appear to be spared from this process.
2. Findings consistent with longstanding cirrhosis and portal
hypertension. Moderate ascites around the liver.

Brief Hospital Course:
He was diagnosed with mesenteric ischemia given acute SMV
thrombosis and mesenteric ischemia. IV Heparin was started. He
was made NPO and started on a PPI. Levo/Flagyl were started.
Pain was controlled with dilaudid. On [**6-15**] he became hypoxic in
setting of OSA when not on CPAP and oversedatd from dilaudid. He
was given narcan. A CXR showed mild edema -> lasix 20 was given
X1 with improvement. His CPAP machine was obtained. He started
on spiriva, albuterol IH PRN, fluticasone  for COPD.
.
On [**6-15**], he underwent ex-lap and small bowel resection of
approximately 45 cm, ileoileostomy (hand sewn). Surgeon was Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 406**] drain was placed. Please see operative
note for further details. Postop, he was transferred to the SICU
intubated. IV Heparin continued. He went into afib then self
converted on lopressor. Lytes were repleted. Hct was stable. The
midline incision was intact. He was extubated on pod 1. On pod
2, he had intermittent bursts of afib which was more responsive
to IV diltiazem drip. An echo demonstrated an EF of 55%, trivial
thickening of the aortic and mitral leaflets and a small
pericardial effusion. Coumadin was not recommended for afib.
.
On POD 5, the wound appeared slightly erythematous. On [**6-20**] a
small area of the incision was opened and packed. He continued
to have paroxysmal afib/flutter treated with diltiazem/O2 and IV
fluid boluses for sbp in 80s/HR 150s. He had a temp of 101. His
[**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain fell out. The abdominal incision was opened. He was
transferred to the SICU. WBC was 18.3. Vanco and Meropenum were
started.  On [**6-21**], he was taken to the OR for Exploratory
laparotomy, repair of wound dehiscence/closure of midline
incision. Surgeon was Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. The abdomen was
irrigated copiously with antibiotic-containing saline solution.
There was a small amount of clear ascites in the abdomen. The
bowel appeared viable.  The culture of the wound swab from [**6-21**]
was + for MRSA. The cline tip returned + for MRSA. Vanco was
continued. His creatinine increased to 1.6 in the setting of
sepsis.  WBC trended down. A wound vac was placed with high
outputs. Albumin was given for each liter of vac drainage
(ascites). Sodium decreased. Diuretics were held for creatinine
of 1.7 then lasix was resumed. Creatinine continued to increase
as high as 2.0 on [**7-1**] from 0.7 on [**6-22**]. Urine was + for
eosinophils. Pharm/ID felt that this could be due to protonix
causing interstitial nephritis. Protonix was discontinued. A
chem 7 should be drawn every Monday and Thursday. Spironolactone
was stopped and lasix was given as 60mg po qd.
.
 A picc line was placed on [**6-26**] for TPN and antibiotics. A 39.0
cm left basilic single-lumen PICC was noted to terminate in the
distal SVC. Coumadin was started and iv heparin was weaned off
when inr was 2.2 on [**6-28**]. INR increased to 3.7 on [**7-2**]. Coumadin
was held.
.
TPN was started as recommended by Nutrition. His diet was slowly
advanced with sufficient kcal intake. TPN was discontinued on
[**6-26**]. He developed an elevated wbc. ID redcommended sending stool
for c.diff despite absence of diarrhea. On [**6-26**], stool was + for
C.diff. Flagyl was started for a course duration of 2 weeks
after vancoymcin completed.

ID had recommended TEE to r/o cardiac vegetation due to MRSA.
This was deferred due to h/o of esophageal varices note on [**1-24**]
at [**Hospital1 2025**]. On [**7-1**], he was scoped by GI to re-evaluate varices
given inr of 3.6 on coumadin. EGD showed grade 1 varices at the
gastroesophageal junction and lower third of the esophagus,
diffuse portal hypertensive gastropathy, and an otherwise normal
EGD to second part of the duodenum.

.
He will continue IV vanco for a total of 6 weeks (from start of
last + bl. cx [**6-30**])given + blood culture for MRSA on [**2133-6-22**]. ID
recommended extending po flagyl for 2 weeks after IV vanco stops
to cover for c.diff. Blood cultures were redrawn on [**6-29**] and
[**6-30**] in addition to a picc line tip culture that was replaced in
the Left arm on [**6-30**].

The plan is for him to go to [**Hospital1 **]. While there, please hold
Vanco on [**7-3**] and resume on [**7-4**]. Level was 24.6 on [**7-2**]. He
received a dose on [**7-2**] prior to level being reported. Labs
should be drawn on [**7-4**] for vanco trough level. Vanco trough
goal level should be 15-20.  INR should be done on [**7-3**] as inr
was high (3.7)on alternating doses of 2 and 3mg. Vac dressing is
due to be changed on [**7-3**] as well. Last done on [**6-30**].
