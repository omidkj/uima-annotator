Admission Date:  [**2166-12-14**]     Discharge Date:  [**2166-12-17**]


Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 82 year-old
woman who initially presented to an outside hospital [**2166-12-4**]
with progressive fatigue and dyspnea on exertion, as well as
new exertional chest pain.  She subsequently had a positive
stress test and then underwent cardiac catheterization at the
[**Hospital1 69**].  This study
demonstrated inferior hypokinesis, discreet 99% p right
coronary artery, discreet 60 to 70% mid right coronary
artery, discreet 50% left main, 60% proximal left anterior
descending coronary artery, 60 to 70% obtuse marginal one,
diffuse luminal left anterior descending coronary artery
irregularities, proximal 70 to 80% left circumflex and mild
LVEDP elevation, mild systolic and diastolic ventricular
dysfunction were also seen.  The calcified right coronary
artery lesions were debulked by rotational atherectomy and
the proximal, mid, and distal right coronary artery lesions
were stented.

Following the above the patient was sent home on Clopidogrel
and Sulfinpyrazone given her aspirin allergy.  On [**2166-12-7**] the
patient developed a diffuse erythematous rash with urticaria.
Her Sulfinpyrazone was stopped, but the rash persisted, so on
[**2166-12-10**] the Sulfinpyrazone was restarted and the Clopidogrel
discontinued.  On the morning of admission the patient awoke
with severe substernal chest pain and went to an outside
hospital Emergency Department where she was found to have
inferior ST segment elevations.  She was air flighted to [**Hospital1 1444**] for catheterization, but due
to a back up of cases in the catheterization laboratory the
patient was administered a half dose of thrombolytics prior
to going to the laboratory.  Her catheterization demonstrated
diffuse mid 40 to 50% left anterior descending coronary
artery, 60% D1, possible total occlusion of the left
circumflex after obtuse marginal one, a long 70% proximal
obtuse marginal one lesion, large thrombus in the proximal
and mid right coronary artery, and small PL branch cut off or
occlusion terminally.  The distal and mid right coronary
artery stents were successfully reexpanded.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Pulmonary nodule newly diagnosed.

ALLERGIES:  Aspirin, Clopidogrel.

MEDICATIONS:  1.  Metoprolol 25 mg po b.i.d.  2.
Sulfinpyrazone.  3.  Prednisone 10 gallop or murmur po q day
started for the allergic reaction to Clopidogrel.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone.  Her son lives
upstairs from her.  She denies any history of tobacco use.

INITIAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Heart rate 89, blood pressure
105/47, respiratory rate 17, oxygen saturation 98% on 2
liters nasal cannula.  The patient was lying flat and in no
acute distress.  Her heart was a regular rate and rhythm.
There were normal S1 and S2 heart sounds and there was a 2
out of 6 systolic ejection murmur throughout the precordium.
Her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly.
Her abdomen was benign.  Her extremities were warm, there
were 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally and she had 1+
peripheral pitting edema.

INITIAL LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 15.3, hematocrit
32.8, platelets 814.  PT 16.2, PTT 150, INR 1.7.  Initial
serum chemistries demonstrated sodium 142, potassium 3.7,
chloride 104, bicarbonate 24, BUN 27, creatinine 0.9, glucose
194.  Her initial CK was 39.  Her precath electrocardiogram
demonstrated normal sinus rhythm at 95 beats per minute,
normal axis, prolonged PR interval, 2 to 5 mm ST segment
elevations in leads 2, 3 and AVF with 2 to 3 mm ST segment
depressions and 1 and AVL, these elevations and depressions
resolved post catheterization.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiovascular:  Post procedurally the
patient was loaded with Ticlopidine and then was started on a
regular Ticlopidine regimen as noted below.  She was also
administered a Tirofiban drip for a total of 40 hours.  A
fasting lipid panel demonstrated mild hypertriglyceridemia,
but otherwise normal serum cholesterol levels.  Prior to
discharge the patient was also started on a low dose ace
inhibitor as noted below.  On [**2166-12-16**] the patient had an
echocardiogram that demonstrated mild left atrial dilation,
normal left ventricular size, probably normal left
ventricular ejection fraction (greater then 55%), 1+ mitral
regurgitation, 1+ tricuspid regurgitation, mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension and mild diastolic dysfunction.
A focal wall motion abnormality was not excluded.  At the
time of discharge the patient was hemodynamically stable on
her cardiovascular medication regimen as noted below.

2.  Rash:  The patient diffuse, erythematous, pruritic rash
continued with minimal improvement throughout her admission.
She was continued on Prednisone 10 mg po q day and
Fexofenadine, Ranitidine and Sarna lotion were added for
symptomatic relief.  The patient achieved mild to moderate
symptomatic relief with these measures and they were
continued on discharge.  She was instructed to have the rash
monitored as an outpatient as noted below.

3.  Anemia:  Post procedurally the patient's hematocrit
dropped from an admission level of 32 to a level of 27.  The
patient was therefore transfused 1 unit of packed red blood
cells with an appropriate increase in her hematocrit.  At the
time of discharge the patient's hematocrit was at its
baseline.  Iron studies were sent, but were largely
consistent with an anemia of chronic disease, vitamin B-12
and folate levels were normal.

4.  Hyperglycemia:  Immediately post catheterization the
patient was noted to have had significant hyperglycemia.
Subsequent serum glucose measurements ranged roughly between
120 and 160 indicating that the patient has diabetes.  She
was counseled on the importance of eating a diabetic diet and
she was given information on discharge on eating an
appropriate diabetic diet.  Further management of her
diabetes including initiation of medications was deferred to
the outpatient setting.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE PLACEMENT:  Home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Inferior SPE myocardial infarction.
2.  Allergic reaction to Clopidogrel.
3.  Anemia.
4.  Diabetes mellitus type 2.
5.  Mild diastolic dysfunction.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  1.  Fexofenadine 60 mg po b.i.d.  2.
Sarna lotion as needed.  3.  Prednisone 10 mg po q day times
seven days, followed by 5 mg po q day times seven days.  4.
Ranitidine 150 mg po b.i.d.  5.  Ticlopidine 250 mg po b.i.d.
6.  Lisinopril 2.5 mg po q day.  7.  Metoprolol 25 mg po
b.i.d.

The patient was instructed to phone her cardiologist, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 45873**], on the day following discharge to arrange for an
outpatient appointment with him on Friday [**2166-12-19**] for a blood
pressure check and for monitoring of her rash.  She was given
information materials on eating both heart healthy and
diabetic diet.  She was also instructed to follow up with her
primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 45874**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 23220**], as previously
arranged.
