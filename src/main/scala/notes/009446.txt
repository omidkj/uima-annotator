Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2518**]
Chief Complaint:
dysarthria, L hemiparesis


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tracheostomy
PEG tube placement


History of Present Illness:
74yo man with PMH significant for Parkinson's disease,
hypertension, and orthostatic hypotension, presents with
dysarthria and left hemiparesis as a transfer from [**Hospital2 **] [**Hospital3 6783**]
Hospital s/p IV tPA administration. History is mostly obtained
from the OSH records, as the patient is too dysarthric to
provide
a full history. He does endorse the provided history. Per
report,
he was well until around 1pm [**7-25**], when he had acute onset of
dysarthria, left facial droop, and then left hemiparesis. It
seems that he was able to walk with a cane (usually walks
unassisted) into the hospital, but then symptoms worsened. He
presented 15-20mins later. Examination at the OSH was notable
for
dysarthria, expressive aphasia, left facial droop, left
hemiparesis, and upgoing left toe. NIHSS was 15 (3 for face, 4
for LUE motor, 2 for LLE motor, 1 for ataxia, 1 for sensory, 2
for language, and 2 for dysarthria). A head CT showed no acute
abnormalities. Labs were unremarkable. He was given IV tPA with
infusion ending at 3pm. BPs ranged from 130-152/80s-90s while
there. He reportedly had some improvement with the tPA per the
report, but the patient denies any significant change. He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED due to lack of ICU beds.

On ROS at the OSH, he denied fevers, chills, cough, dyspnea,
chest pain, palpitations, nausea, and vomiting.


Past Medical History:

diverticulosis/hemorrhoids
thalassemia
depression/anxiety
macular degeneration
erectile dysfunction
s/p appendectomy


Social History:
no tobacco or EtOH. Not married.

Neurologic examination:
Mental status: Awake and alert, cooperative with exam, normal
affect. Grossly attentive. Speech is stuttering and very
dysarthric. He has normal comprehension and repetition; naming
intact. Unable to test [**Location (un) 1131**] due to blurred vision without
glasses present. Registers [**2-20**], recalls [**1-23**] in 5 minutes. No
right-left confusion. No evidence of visual neglect.

Cranial Nerves: Fundoscopic examination reveals sharp disc
margins. Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 7 to 5 mm
bilaterally. No RAPD. Visual fields are full to confrontation.
Extraocular movements intact bilaterally with gaze-evoked
sustained nystagmus bilaterally. Sensation intact V1-V3 to cold,
light touch, and pinprick. Left facial droop. Hearing intact to
finger rub bilaterally. Palate elevation unable to appreciate.
Sternocleidomastoid full, decreased shrug on left. Tongue likely
midline given facial droop.

Motor: RUE w/ cogwheel rigidity, LUE flaccid, BLE hypertonic
(L>R). RUE>RLE tremor. RUE full strength; RLE full strength x
difficulty with dorsiflexion and toe extension. LUE no movement,
LLE able to flex at hip (barely antigravity) and at knee ([**1-25**]).

Sensation: Intact to light touch and symmetric to vibration.
Decreased pinprick and cold sensation in left arm, but not
decreased in leg. No extinction to DSS.

Reflexes: 2 in R [**Hospital1 **], br, [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], 3 in L [**Hospital1 **], br, [**Hospital1 **], 2+ L [**Hospital1 **],
tr R ankle, unable to elicit in L ankle. R toe withdraws on
plantar stim, L toe upgoing.

Coordination: unable to test

Gait: not tested

IMAGING:
OSH head CT: "small well corticated lucent lesion in the
posterior calvarium slightly left of midline... nonaggressive"
OSH CXR: nl
<br>
MRI/MRA Head:
1. There is an acute infarct involving the right side of the
[**Hospital1 **].
2. There is no evidence of hemorrhage.
3. There is no stenosis of the basilar artery.
<br>
ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect or
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast with maneuvers maneuvers (post-Valsalva). Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Dilated thoracic aorta. No cardiac cause of embolism
identified.
<br>
Carotid Duplex
There is a widely patent right internal carotid artery and a
widely patent left internal carotid artery with antegrade flow
in both vertebral arteries. This is a normal carotid duplex.
<br>
CTA Chest
1. Pulmonary embolism of the subsegmental branch of right apical
region of the right upper lobe. However the study is some
whatsuboptimal. If clinical concern exists, the study can be
repeated. This finding was discussed with doctor [**Doctor Last Name 27492**] at the
attending review at 9:20 Am at [**2100-7-29**].
2. Atelectatic changes are noted within the posterior segment of
the right lower lobe and basilar segment of the left lung.
3. Cholelithiasis with no evidence of cholecystitis.
4. Multiple hypodense liver lesions which are too small to
characterize. The largest one is located within segment VI and
measures 13 mm.
5. Both kidneys contain contrast material on the non-contrast
phase of the study suggesting prior contrast
admninistration/renal failure.
<br>
CTA Head:
Based upon the preliminary data available, including careful
review of the source image data, there is no evidence for
basilar artery thrombosis, but only very slight atherosclerotic
irregularity of this vessel. There is no hemodynamically
significant stenosis involving the basilar artery. The left
vertebral artery is the dominant vessel. The tributaries of the
circle of [**Location (un) 431**] are patent, allowing for moderate
atherosclerotic calcification of the cavernous portions of both
internal carotid arteries.

Finally, the pontine infarct is visible, though the parameters
chosen for CT angiography, as opposed to conventional brain
imaging, do not reveal the hypodense area with equivalent
clarity. Within the limitations of the present technique, there
does not appear to be definite overt increase in size of this
prominent right paracentral pontine infarct.

IR-guided Dobhoff placement
Procedure: 8 Fr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tube was inserted under
continous flouroscopic guidance via the nasal cavity. The tube
could be advanced till the fundus of the stomach. Multiple
attempts of further advancement were unsuccessfull. Further
advancement is defered at the moment due to severe limitations
in patient's mobility and continous oxygen dependence. Tube
position was confimed using opitray contrast. Patient tolerated
the procedure well, with no immediate post procedural
complications.

<br>
Extremity U/S
No evidence of lower extremity DVT.
No upper extremity DVT.

EEG: This is an abnormal portable EEG in the waking and drowsy
states. There were no focal, lateralized, or epileptiform
features
noted.
