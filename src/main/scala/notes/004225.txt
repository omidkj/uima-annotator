[**2-21**] KUB: large bowel obstruction

[**2-21**] CT ABD/PELVIS:
IMPRESSION:
1. Dilated fluid-filled distal appendix with periappendiceal
stranding concerning for tip appendicitis in the proper clinical
setting.
2. Ill-defined nodular opacities in the right lower lobe
consistent with infectious process.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
4. Calcified pleural plaques consistent with asbestosis
exposure.
5. Dilated large bowel without evidence of obstruction. These
findings are consistent with [**Last Name (un) **] syndrome.
6. Fat-containing right inguinal hernia.

[**2-27**] CT ABD/PELVIS/ CHEST CTA:
IMPRESSION:
1. Compared to [**2114-2-21**], there is improvement in the
previously described multifocal patchy opacities in the
bilateral lungs. There remains mild ground glass opacities
within the lung apices.
2. There is diffuse colonic wall thickening with mural
enhancement, concerning for infectious colitis; however, in the
setting of recent abdominal surgery, ischemia cannot be totally
excluded. There is no other finding suggestive of ischemia such
as portal venous air or pneumatosis.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
4. Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
5. Soft tissue mass adjacent to the Foley catheter in the
bladder, for which further evaluation with ultrasound with full
bladder is recommended. This may represent asymmetric
hypertrophy of the prosatate gland, however a neoplasm of the
bladder is included in the differential diagnosis.
6. Small amount of ascites.
7. No evidence of pulmonary embolus or thoracic aortic
dissection.

[**3-1**] Renal Ultrasound: no hydronephrosis

[**3-6**] ABD 2 views:
There are gas-filled loops of prominent transverse colon
overlying the mid abdomen with slight thickening of haustral
folds. Though nonspecific, this may be seen due to infectious
etiology such as C. diff colitis. There is no gross evidence for
free air or signs specific for obstruction. Pleural
calcifications are evident in the visualized portions of the
lower chest as better demonstrated on a recent chest CT.

MICU:
Echocardiogram:
Conclusions:  Overall left ventricular systolic function is low
normal (LVEF 50%). There is no  ventricular septal defect. The
right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied.  The right
ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function  appears depressed. There is abnormal septal
motion/position consistent with  right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is mild  aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The  mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. The supporting structures of the tricuspid
valve are  thickened/fibrotic. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen.  There is severe pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs  of tamponade. Echocardiographic signs
of tamponade may be absent in the  presence of elevated right
sided pressures.  Compared with the findings of the prior study
(images reviewed) of [**2114-1-16**], multiple major
abnormalities as noted above persist without significant
change.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to surgery under Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Patient was
brought directly to the OR for exploratory laparotomy,
appendectomy and decompression of the large bowel.  There were
no complications and the patient was transferred to the SICU
intubated.  The patient received peri-op Kefzol and Flagyl.
Cardiology was consulted and recommended beta blockage to keep
HR<110, and to keep Hct>30%. On POD1, patient was manually
decompressed, extubated, and received 1u PRBCs. On POD3, patient
remained hemodynamically stable, still a-fib, afebrile, had
formed stools, and soft, non-tender abdomen. Patient was
transferred to the floor, NGT was d/c'ed.  Patient was kept NPO
for minor abdominal distention.  On POD3, patient had hematuria
and a continuous bladder irrigation was started.  Urology was
consulted and recommended CBI (titrate to light pink.  Patient
remained on IV hydrocortisone to cover his chronic prednisone
therpay.  A steroid taper was started.  On POD4, stool was found
to be positive for C. Diff. The patient was continued on IV
Flagyl and oral vancomycin was started. On the evening of POD5,
patient complained of severe chest and back pain.  EKG, cardiac
enzymes, and CTA chest were all negative.  Pain was not relieved
on SL nitroglycerin.  Arterial blood gas showed an O2 of 81.
The patient was tranferred back to the SCIU for hemodynamic
monitoring. Cardiology was reconsulted.  Cycled cardiac enzymes
were negative.  He remained stable in the ICU with a mild O2
requirement (3L).  Amylase and lipase were noted to be elevated
the morning following this event and he was diagnosed with
pancreatitis.  He remained NPO for 2days however never had a
recurrence of pain and his amylase and lipase trended to normal
over the next 4 days.  TPN was initiated given his prolonged
status without significant oral intake.  This was continued and
calorie counts are currently being recorded to assess his
caloric intake.  His creatinine was noted to rise significantly
on POD7-10 accompanied by an abrupt decline in urine output.
This has currently peaked and his urine as well as creatinine
have improved.  Renal was consulted during this time and felt
that contrast nephropathy vs ATN from other etiologie
