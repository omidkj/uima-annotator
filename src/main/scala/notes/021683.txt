Past Medical History:
Oncologic History:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 yo male who developed left inguinal
swelling in [**5-17**] while in [**Country 4194**], where it was attributed to a

hernia. Upon his return to the US in early [**Month (only) 216**], his PCP
suspected left inguinal lymphadenopathy and arranged for
excisional biopsy of a part of a lymph node. This revealed
reactive changes. He was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2132-9-7**] with
worsening left groin swelling and pain related to worsening
lymphadenopathy, abdominal pain and nausea. Laboratory data
remarkable for elevated LDH and significant eosinophilia (as
high as 30%.) CT imaging demonstrated bilateral basilar
pulmonary nodules and significant lymphadenopathy involving the

retroperitoneal, pelvic, and left iliac chains. Infectious
disease work-up was unremarkable. The CT findings, along with
elevated LDH, raised concern about a lymphoproliferative
disorder. SPEP revealed monoclonal gammopathy, which was
comprised of IgG lambda and constituted 1600 mg/dl. PET scan
demonstrated intensely FDG avid in the left cervical (SUV 18),
right axillary (SUV 5), left supraclavicular (SUV 17), left
paratracheal (SUV 13), retroperitoneal (SUV 22,) and left
inguinal (SUV 25) lymph node groups.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] repeat excisional biopsy of an FDG-avid
inguinal lymph node on [**9-13**]. Flow cytometry revealed atypical
lymphohistiocytic infiltrate highly suggestive of peripheral
T-cell lymphoma NOS. On histological examination, the lymph node
architecture was completely effaced with a background of
epithelioid histiocyte granulomatoid aggregates. Intermingled
was an atypical lymphoid population that stained positive for
CD2, 3, and 5 with dual loss of CD4 and CD8 and loss CD7. The
combined morphologic and immunophenotypic picture was most
consistent with peripheral T-cell lymphoma, NOS. [**Last Name (un) **] staining
was negative. IgH gene rearrangement failed to show
monoclonality. TCR rearrangement, on the other hand, was
monoclonal.
.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Melanoma, right arm excised in [**2129**].
2. Question of history of histoplasmosis.
3. Right shoulder surgery for fracture and dislocation [**2129**].
4. Kidney stones 40 years ago.

Social History:

[**Last Name (un) 51768**]. Spent the majority of the past five years in
[**Country 4194**] where his wife of several years works as a physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
frequently traveled to [**Country 4194**] over the past 25
years. Patient also has a strong social support network of
friends in [**Name (NI) 108**]. Patient has traveled to Western Europe; used
to smoke a pipe, 5 bowls per day x30 years. Currently living
with his son and [**Name2 (NI) 41859**] in law plus their children here in
[**State 350**]. He used to be an alcoholic but has been sober
since [**2098**]. He is a retired school teacher and used to teach in
[**Last Name (LF) 51768**], [**First Name3 (LF) 108**]. He has one healthy pet dog in [**Country 4194**]
who "plays rough" after roaming the streets/markets of [**Country 4194**].
His son and daughter in law have a dog he is not intimately
involved with and mainly licks.

[**2132-11-14**] 6:50 pm BLOOD CULTURE
   Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2132-11-21**]):
      CAPNOCYTOPHAGA SPECIES.    PRESUMPTIVE IDENTIFICATION.
.
CTA, abdomen and pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute pulmonary embolism.
2. Bilateral lower lobe consolidation, likely representing
pneumonia, right
more than left. Diffuse nodular and patchy opacities throughout
the lungs,
especially in the middle lobes, consistent with infectious or
inflammatory
etiology.
3. Emphysema.
4. Precarinal, left paratracheal and right hilar lymph nodes
measuring about
1.2 cm in short axis.
5. Left renal cyst.
6. Left inguinal partially imaged cystic lesion, this may
represent a
lymphocele. Clinical correlation is recommended.
7. left seminal vesicle with minimal surrounding fat stranding
which measures
up to 3.6 x 2.7 cm. Clinical correlation for acute pain is
recommended.
.
Chest Ultrasound:
IMPRESSION: Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater
than left.
Superinfection cannot be excluded.
.
CT chest: 1. Increased size of mediastinal nodes likely
reactive. Pre-existing
micronodules have become more confluent and consolidative. This
is most
likely an infective process and the differential includes an
acute (bacterial)
on chronic (atypical - for example, atypical mycobacterial)
infection.
Recommend followup CT scan after treatment.
2. New small pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
68 yo M with T cell lymphoma (+ monoclonal
gammopathy), recent LLE DVT (now on anticoagulation) presents
with fevers/chills, arthralgias/myalgias, headaches and now
diarrhea with epigastric pain and abnormal CXR. Patient was
hypotensive but responsive to fluids in the ED, called out of
the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after uneventful overnight stay (spiked temp of 102.8).
.
While in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was started on Vancomycin,
aztreonam and oseltamavir. Oseltamavir was discontinued when the
patient's influenza swabs returned negative. Bactrim was
continued for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
.
#. SIRS/Hypotension: Most likely infectious etiology given
fevers, myalgias/arthralgias, leukocytosis. Patient was likely
also hypovolemic in the ED, [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. Patient was continued on
intravenous fluids as his blood pressures would dip into
SBP85-90s whenever intr
