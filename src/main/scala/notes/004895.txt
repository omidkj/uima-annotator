Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 158**]
Chief Complaint:
Constipation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
exploratory laparotomy, right hemicolectomy, descending loop
colostomy, end ileostomy, rectal biopsy


History of Present Illness:
Admitted on [**2183-8-29**]:
The patient is an 81M with remote h/o prostate cancer s/p XRT
and radiation-induced proctitis who is presenting with
increasing abdominal pain and distention x 1 months. According
to Gerontology notes in OMR, the patient has been evaluated for
these symptoms as recently as [**8-26**]. At the time, his abdominal
bloating was attributed to fecal impaction, and his laxative
regimen was escalated to include miralax. The patient states
that he has not had a normal BM during the past month, as all of
his stools have been small volume and containing mucous. He also
endorses decreased PO intake over past several months. His wife
reports that he has been steadily losing weight since [**Month (only) 547**], up
to 40 lbs. His most recent BM was last [**2183-8-28**], very little
stool. Passing flatus today. Denies history of prior abdominal
surgeries or hernias.

With respect to his radiation proctitis, the patient has
developed
leakage of stool and occasionally some blood in the stool over
the past few years. A sigmoidoscopy in mid-[**Month (only) 205**] showed abnormal
mucosa up to 19 cm, consistent with radiation proctitis. There
was also a mass versus hypertrophic mucosa in the distal rectum,
for which he was scheduled to be biopsied next week.

In the ED, initial VS were: 97.9 63 132/78 16 100% RA. His
abdomen was TTP diffusely on the left without rebound. Labs were
significant for Cr 1.6 and HCT 31.4. CT A/P showed segment of
descending colon with bowel wall thickening with small-moderate
ascites, colitis (infectious/inflammatory/ischemic) cannot be
excluded. Moderate bilateral hydronephrosis with full column
hydroureter extending all the way to the bladder with no
obstructive calculi noted which may represent radiation induced
stricture of ureter. VS prior to transfer were: 98.3 hr 60 b/p
166/79 rr 20.


Past Medical History:
1. Prostate cancer six years ago, status post XRT currently on
Lupron q6mo - apparently recently rising PSA.
2. Radiation proctitis per reports of prior colonoscopy.
3. Mild COPD.
4. Obstructive sleep apnea, uses CPAP.
5. CAD status post stent many years ago, no recurrent symptoms.

6. Pacemaker.
7. Spinal stenosis and DJD.
8. Hypertension.
9. Total hip replacement in [**2180**].
10. Submucosal gastric lesion, likely GIST tumor status post EUS
in [**2183**] - plan to follow conservatively.


Social History:
He is a former smoker and drinks only occasional alcohol.
He lives with his wife and as I mentioned, his daughter is a
nurse, who is very involved with his care.
His daughter is getting married in the near future and they hope
he feels well enough for the wedding.


Family History:
There is no family history of inflammatory bowel disease or any
other GI conditions as far as he is aware. His father died in
his 70s with an MI and his mother died in her 80s of a stroke.


Physical Exam:
VITALS: 98.1, 67, 137/72, 20, 100% RA
GENERAL: NAD, pleasant elderly caucasian gentleman
HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, mucous membranes dry
NECK: no carotid bruits, no lymphadenopathy
LUNGS: CTAB, no wheezing rhonchi, or rales
HEART: RRR, normal S1 S2, no MRG
ABDOMEN: no abd distention, soft, nontender to palpation, open
abdominal wound packed with gauze, erythema around wound due to
fungal infection, ileostomy on right, colostomy on left, both in
place, +BSs
EXTREMITIES: No c/c/e
NEUROLOGIC: A+OX3


Pertinent Results:
([**2183-8-29**]) CT ABDOMEN:
1. Significant fecal loading involing entire colon.
2. Diverticulitosis witout diverticulitis.
3. Segment of descending colon with bowel wall thickening with
small-moderate ascites;colitis
(infectious/inflammatory/ischemic) cannot be excluded. Given
fecal loading, stercoral colitis remains in the differential.
Recommend correlation with lactate.
4. Moderate bilateral hydronephrosis with full column
hydroureter extending all the way to the bladder with no
obstructive calculi noted. Findings may be secondary to
radiation induced stricture of ureter.
5. Renal hypodensities in right upper and mid pole likely cysts

6. Small -moderate ascites.
7. Presacral thickening likely sequela of prostate cancer
treatment.

KUB [**2183-9-1**]
Dilated right and transverse large bowel loops.  Distal large
bowel obstruction with competent ileocecal valve cannot be
excluded.

DIAGNOSIS:

Rectal mass, mucosal biopsies:



     Adenocarcinoma of the prostate involving the colonic
mucosa; confirmed by immunopositivity for prostate specific
antigen and prostate specific acid phosphatase.



     Immunostain for CDX-2 highlights background colonic
epithelial cells and is negative within the tumor.

Clinical:   Large bowel obstruction.  Rectal mass lesion on
previous sigmoidoscopy.
Gross:   The specimen is received in one formalin-filled
container labeled with the patient's name, "[**Known lastname **], [**Known firstname 3613**]", the
medical record number,  and is additionally labeled "rectal
mass".  It consists of multiple tissue fragments measuring up to
0.3 cm which are entirely submitted in cassette A.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 81 caucasian Male with remote h/o prostate cancer
s/p XRT and radiation-induced proctitis who is presenting with
increasing abdominal bloating and distention. Pt has not had a
substantial BM x 1 month. He recently had a sigmoidoscopy with
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 908**] on [**2183-8-11**] that showed: Abnormal mucosa up to 19cm,
consistent with radiation proctitis; mass versus hypertrophic
mucosa in the distal rectum. - ABD CT on admission showed fecal
impaction through the entire colon, without obvious transition
point.

CV:
There was some concern for intraoperative ischemia, but
troponins were negx3, and ECG was unchanged from pre-op. On
[**2183-9-6**] (POD #1), he was admitted to the SICU for hypotension
and low UOP. This resolved with aggressive fluid resuscitation
and 2U PRBC, and he was transferred back to the floor POD #2
([**2183-9-7**]). He was restarted on his antihypertensives when
tolerating PO, and his BP remained around 130-140s systolic.
After consultation with cardiology, his aspirin was restarted
[**2183-9-8**], and it was decided he no longer needed plavix.

Pulm:
Patient had some dyspnea with exertion POD #5 and a CXR was
obtained, showing clear lung fields and no acute pulmonary
process. His dyspnea resolved. He has a history of obstructive
sleep apnea, uses CPAP at setting PS 7, used during this
admisison.

GI: For his original constipation/impaction, pt was first tried
with an aggressive bowel regimen with little improvement. GI was
consulted and recommended even more aggressive regimen.  Manual
disimpaction was first tried by primary team intern on [**2183-9-1**]
without success.  Surgery was consulted, tried another manual
disimpaction on [**2183-9-3**] without any success again. GI performed
sigmoidoscopy on [**2183-9-5**] that showed almost completely
obstructing mass in the re
