MICRO:
-[**12-10**] Urine culture: PROBABLE ENTEROCOCCUS. ~1000/ML.

IMAGING:
-[**12-21**] CT Neck:
1. Extensive nodular mass present throughout the neck, with
lymphadenopathy present bilaterally and the largest conglomerate
of masses seen on the right as detailed above.
  2. Heterogeneous bulky appearance to the right side of the
glottis and
supraglottic region which needs evaluation with direct
exmaination and MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 31186**] [**Last Name (un) 78953**] without and with contrast
for better assessment of extension and exclude neoplasm in this
location.
  3. Heterogeneous mass close to the right palatine tonsil
extending into
parapharyngeal space and carotid space- ? nodal mass or mass in
the
tonsillar/peritonsillar region. Correlation with ENT examination
and MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 31186**] [**Last Name (un) 78953**] can be helpful to assess the extent

-[**12-17**] MRI Brain:
1. Status post craniotomy and resection of the previously seen
tumor centered in the calvarium, with supratentorial and
infratentorial extension. There may be a small focus of residual
nodular enhancement in the infratentorium which may represent
residual disease versus post-surgical changes. In the
supratentorial compartment, there is smooth pachymeningeal
enhancement, without nodularity to suggest residual neoplasm.

 2. Large bulky mass in the right aspect of the neck as well as
a necrotic node of Rouviere. The findings may represent a
conglomerate of metastatic lymph nodes, but the appearance given
the relationship to the pyriform sinus raises the possibility of
a primary neoplasm of the head and neck. Dedicated CT of the
neck is recommended for further evaluation.

[**12-17**] CT Head:
1. Expected postoperative change at the site of right parietal
craniectomy
for tumor resection.
2. Combination of edema and encephalomalacia in right parietal,
temporal, and occipital lobes.
3. No unexpected large hemorrhage.

[**12-11**] CTA Head: 1. Segment of non-opacification within the right
transverse sinus, consistent with likely chronic occlusion. The
remainder of the dural sinuses in addition to the visualized
right internal jugular vein remain patent.
  2. Large mass centered in the right parietal bone, better
assessed on recent MRI of the head.

[**12-10**] MRI Head
Diffusely enhancing mass centered in the right parietal bone,
extending into the subcutaneous tissues as well as involving the
leptomeninges with mass effect on the adjacent right parietal
and temporal lobes and probable invasion of the transverse and
sigmoid sinuses. Differential considerations include metastatic
disease as well as a plasmacytoma.
Meningioma and a chronic infection are less likely but still
considerations.

CT Torso [**12-10**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Findings of metastatic disease without a definite primary
lesion
identified.
  2. Bilateral supraclavicular, right paratracheal, retrocrural,
mesenteric,
and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
  3. Numerous hepatic masses consistent with metastases.
  4. 5mm left upper lobe pulmonary nodule.
  5. Small right pleural effusion with underlying atelectasis.
  6. Destructive lesion of the right ischium.
  7. Right posterior sixth rib fracture without callus formation
which
therefore may be pathologic.

PATHOLOGY:
-[**12-11**] Lymph node biopsy: A.  Lymph node, site not specified:
Poorly differentiated non-small carcinoma. B.  Lymph node, site
not specified: Poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma.
Immunophenotyping:
A limited panel was attempted to exclude a B-cell non-Hodgkin
lymphoma, however was non-diagnostic due to insufficient numbers
of B cells for analysis.  Correlation with clinical findings and
morphology (see separate report) is recommended. Flow cytometry
immunophenotyping may not detect all lymphomas as due to
topography, sampling or artifacts of sample preparation.
-[**12-17**] Surgical Pathology:
1.  Muscle, mastoid, right (A-E): Metastatic carcinoma with
focal squamous cell differentiation.
2.  Bone, temporal, right (F-G): Metastatic carcinoma with
squamous cell differentiation.
3.  "Temporal tumor" right (H-O): Metastatic carcinoma with
squamous cell differentiation


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] dept of neurosurgery after having
an episode of confusion and shaking. He was then taken to an
OSH, where CT head imaging revealed a right sided
parietal-occipital mass. He was admitted to the intensive care
unit for frequent neurlogical monitoring and managment. MRI of
the head, as well as CT of the Torso were obtained which
revealed significant, likely metastatic disease. In this
setting, Craniotomy for resection was deferred pending further
work up. A Lymph node biopsy was obtained which revealed
metastatic carcinoma. Further differentiation was not able to be
done from the biopsy. The patient underwent a
craniectomy/craniotomy for resection of the skull mass and
supratentorial lesion on [**2133-12-17**]. He also had a cranioplasty
with mesh as the bone was not able to be replaced due to the
infiltration of the mass.

The patient went directly to CT scan from the OR and the scan
showed no hemorrhage and confirmed resection of the
supratentorial portion of the mass. The patient the went to the
ICU and remained intubated overnight. He was extubated the
following day and later transferred to the neurosurgery floor.
The patient's steroids were weaned to 2 mg [**Hospital1 **]. His neuro exam
remained stable
