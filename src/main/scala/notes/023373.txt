Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfonamides

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
transferred for hypotension, CHF, and acute kidney injury

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 85yo male with a h/o CHF, CAD s/p CABGx2,
severe MR, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and CKD, who was tranfered to
[**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital6 17032**] in the setting of CHF
exacerbation and acute on chronic kidney disease for possible
hemodialysis. The patient was briefly admitted to NVMC from
[**Date range (1) 28875**] for chest pain, then readmitted after presenting
again on [**2129-8-6**]. At time of second admission, he c/o
intermittent sharp left arm pain, blurred vision in his right
eye, and a fall at his home. In ED he was found to be
hypotensive with SBP in the 70s.  He was given 3 boluses of
250mL NS, without effect.  He was started on dopamine in the ED,
but developed chest pain and the dopamine was stopped.  He was
then admitted to the ICU for further management. He was noted to
have Cr of 3.24, elevated above his baseline (1.3-1.4 per
notes). Other notable labs included a troponin of 0.1 on
admission [**2129-8-6**], which peaked at 0.31 on [**2129-8-7**] and had
decreased to 0.27 on [**2129-8-8**].

During that admission he was seen by nephrology and cardiology,
and was initially felt to be volume depleted.  His Lasix and
Cozaar were held, and he was gently hydrated with IVF, including
a bicarb drip. His Cr trended down to 2.16 on [**2129-8-8**], and his
BP was up to the 90s.  However he then developed worsening CHF,
with CXR demonstrating worsening pulmonary vascular congestion
and an enlarging left-sided pleural effusion.  An echo revealed
normal LVEF (58%), severe MR, and moderate pulmonary HTN
(pulmonary artery systolic pressure in mid-50s).  Of note, the
patient had a cardiac cath done about one month prior, which
revealed severe diffuse left main disease with 75% ostial and
95% proximal LAD lesions, as well as diffuse disease and distal
occlusion of native RCA. Plan was for medical management.
.
On [**2129-8-10**] patient was noted to have decreasing urine output, as
well as rising Cr. He did not respond to a bolus of IV Lasix,
was started on a Lasix gtt at 10mg/hr, and his Lasix had to be
titrated up to 20mg/hr.  His BUN/Cr continued to rise, his
sodium levels were decreasing, and he developed nausea and
vomiting suggestive of uremic symptoms.  Given his worsening
renal function, he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible
hemodialysis. Prior to transfer, he was started on a dobutamine
drip.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ICU patient was placed on monitoring and
resumed on a dobutamine drip and furosemide drip. His dobutamine
drip was shortly stopped as his BPs were stable, and his Lasix
drip has been titrated down to 5mg/hr.  He was initially
admitted to the MICU, then transferred to the CCU for management
of his CHF.  Since admission to [**Hospital1 18**], he has been diuresing
well, with a net fluid balance of negative 2.26 liters. His BP
remains stable off pressors. He has still been hypoxic,
requiring a high-flow oxygen face mask with FiO2 of 100% to
maintain O2 sats in the mid-90s. Renal is following, and felt
the [**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] may be secondary to cardiorenal physiology.

.
On admission to the CCU, the patient c/o SOB and
lightheadedness, but denies any CP, abdominal pain, N/V/D,
constipation, arthralgias, or myalgias. No recent fever or
chills.  All other review of systems negative, although the
patient does not provide much history on questioning.  Prior to
his recent hospitalizations, he had been living alone. He
reports he was able to climb stairs, but would develop some
dyspnea on exertion. He denies orthopnea or PND. He does report
leg pain on walking, although he cannot fully describe the
quality of the pain.  He has bilateral lower extremity edema at
baseline, per his previous reports. He denies any episodes of
syncope.

ECHO [**8-13**]: The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] Diastolic function could
not be assessed. The right ventricular cavity is markedly
dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root
is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets
are mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric, anteriorly directed
jet of Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due
to the eccentric nature of the
