Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3266**]
Chief Complaint:
Transferred for TIPS

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Variceal banding
TIPS- unsuccessful
Orotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 69yo M w/cirrhosis of uncertain etiology (believed
likely fatty liver/NASH w/component of alcohol induced) who
began to have SOB in [**2151**].  At that time he was diagnosed with
"a partially blocked artery" and was started on aspirin.  In
[**2154**], he experienced UGIB which on EGD showed a bleeding varix
which was banded.  In early [**Month (only) 359**], he experienced a recurrent
bleed; large gastric varices were noted and no intervention was
performed.  Last PM, he bleed overnight and was transfused four
units overnight.  EGD was performed the AM of transfer to [**Hospital1 **]
which demonstrated large varices with mucosal ulceration
indicative of recent bleed; he was banded X 2.  Banding resulted
in variceal bleeding so further banding was applied.  He was
then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]  on an octreotide drip.

Past Medical History:
ALcoholic cirrhosis

of five drinks/night in [**2131**] on Sat and Sun nights.

Obese, distended; organomegaly difficult to assess

Pertinent Results:
Embolization;
1. CO2 portogram failed to show portal vein, therefore
transhepatic portogram was performed which demonstrated small
gastric varices, no pressure gradients between the portal vein
and right atrium.

2. Transhepatic varices embolization was performed with 15 cc of
absolute alcohol.

3. Transjugular liver biopsy was performed.
.
Liver needle biopsy:
    1. Consists almost completely of fibrous tissue.  Multiple
levels examined.
    2. Tiny fragment of hepatocytes, insufficient for diagnosis.
.
Gall bladder U/S;
FINDINGS: Again identified is a heterogeneous and diffusely
echogenic liver. There is no evidence of hematoma, fluid
collection or focal hepatic mass. The main portal vein is patent
with appropriate hepatopetal flow. There is no intra- or
extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The gallbladder is
normal without stones or wall edema. A small right pleural
effusion is identified. Limited views of the upper pole of the
right kidney demonstrate no hydronephrosis, mass or calculi. No
ascites is evident.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of hematoma, hepatic lesion or ascites.
2. Diffusely heterogeneous, echogenic liver consistent with
chronic liver disease.
3. Appropriate direction of flow within the main portal vein.
.
EKG; Sinus bradycardia. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2157-12-25**] there is
variation in the precordial lead placement and the rate has
slowed. Otherwise,no diagnostic interim change. There is low
precordial lead voltage.
.
ECHO;Conclusions:
1. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is probably normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%).
2. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace
aortic
regurgitation is seen.
3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral
regurgitation is seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Transferred from OSH and admitted to MICU for GI bleed.

GI bleed:  Unstable hematocrit in setting of grade 1 bleeding
gastric varices. [**12-20**], he bleed overnight and was transfused
four units overnight. EGD was performed the AM of transfer to [**Hospital1 **]
which demonstrated large varices with mucosal ulceration
indicative of recent bleed; he was banded X 2. Banding resulted
in variceal bleeding so further banding was applied. He was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on an octreotide drip.  He had a repeat EGD
and banding with attempted TIPS taht was unsuccessful.  Post
procedure he was extubated, then reintubated [**1-26**] agitation.  He
was extubated on [**12-24**] with out complication and transferred to
the [**Hospital1 **] team.  On the [**Hospital1 **], his hematocrit was monitored [**Hospital1 **]
and remained stable through [**12-26**].  he had one melanic stool but
was otherwise asymptomatic, tolerating PO and ambulating without
assistance.  Melanic stool x 2 on [**2157-12-26**] deferred [**Date Range **] by
