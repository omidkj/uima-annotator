Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
Transferred from [**Hospital6 2561**] with with tracheal
stenosis following previous admission with intubation for
unclear DKA and coma.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Rigid bronchoscopy for tracheal dilation


History of Present Illness:
69 year old woman with Type II DM was admitted to [**Hospital1 1012**] [**Hospital 9095**]
Hospital [**2123-6-28**] for DKA and coma c/b respiratory failure. She
was intubated x8 days, deintubated, and reintubated x3 days.
Post intubation experienced dysphonia and dysphagia. Transferred
to rehab [**7-14**] to [**8-4**]. At home she started to experience
increased bowel sounds and LE edema. She also experienced cough
and stridor. These symptoms ultimately resulted in an admission
to [**Hospital 8**] Hospital ([**8-24**]) and transfer to [**Hospital3 **]
([**8-25**]). There she had flexible bronchoscopy and CT scan,
revealing significant stricture to 50% about 3-4 cm distal to
vocal cords. She was finally transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ([**8-25**]) for
further evaluation and management.

Past Medical History:
1) Type II DM
2) Anemia
3) Claustrophobia and anxiety
4) Pneumonitis
5) Ovarian cyst
6) Appendectomy in the remote past

Social History:
Patient lived alone in [**Location (un) 9095**]. She suffers an unclear
"short-term memory loss." Since her admission to [**Location (un) 68753**]hospital and discharge from rehab, she has lived with her son in
[**Name (NI) 8**]. He has taken responsibility for her medical
management but has had to miss work to do so. He is now feeling
the strain of this responsibility and understands that his
mother may need [**Hospital 4820**] nursing care.

History is unclear for use of alcohol, tobacco, and illicits.

OTHER
[**2123-9-5**] TSH 3.7

RAPID PLASMA REAGIN TEST (Final [**2123-9-6**]): NONREACTIVE.
Reference Range: Non-Reactive.

EKG [**8-26**]
Normal sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. RSR' pattern in
leads V1-V2 with T wave inversions in leads V1-V2 suggest
possible anteroseptal ischemia. Clinical correlation is
suggested. No previous tracing available for comparison

CT TRACHEA [**8-26**]
1. High-grade (more than 90%), focal proximal tracheal stenosis,
4 cm below the vocal cords, extending less than 1 cm in
cranicaudad length. These findings are most consistent with
post-intubation benign tracheal stenosis given history of prior
intubation.
2. Mucous plugging involving the right bronchus intermedius and
right lower lobe bronchus.
3. Small noncalcified lung nodule in the right middle lobe
measuring 6 mm. Followup CT in 3 months is recommended to assure
stability.
4. Evidence of prior granulomatous disease.

CXR [**8-26**]
Single AP view of the chest is obtained [**2123-8-26**] and is compared
with the prior radiograph performed [**2123-8-25**]. No pneumothorax is
visualized. Left basilar subsegmental atelectasis. Small small
granuloma in the left upper lobe. Otherwise no change since the
prior examination.




Brief Hospital Course:
1. Hyperglycemia.
Patient was admitted taking metformin/glipizide and getting
lantus (30 units) QHS. At [**Hospital3 **] she was on an insulin
drip for blood glucose levels in the 300s, which subsequently
fell to the 50s. In the [**Hospital1 18**] TSICU glucose levels ranged
100-270 on insulin drip.

[**Last Name (un) **] consult note [**8-27**] assessed insulin resistance and
recommended discharge on patient's regimen of metformin and
amaryl. But due to refractory glucose levels (raning 166-343) on
the floor, she was started on an HISS 70/30 [**Hospital1 **] with daily
titration for serum glucose. [**Last Name (un) **] note [**8-31**] suggested this was
a reasonable starting point for improving glycemic control.  She
was maintained on a diabetic diet.

At time of discharge, the patient was taking 70/30 insulin [**Hospital1 **];
plan was for administration by her son or self-admnistration
under the direct supervision of her son.

2. Tracheal stenosis.
Patient underwent bronchoscopy [**2123-8-27**]. Report found post
intubation tracheal stenosis, status post electrocautery knife
and balloon dilatation and mitomycin C application with final
internal diameter of 15 mm. Following the procedure Sa02 was 95%
on 5L NC. Thoracic surgery progress note indicated lungs CTAB.
Sa02 [**8-28**] was 96% RA and remained normal through the rest of her
hospital course.

Plan was for follow-up with interventional pulmonology in [**3-4**]
weeks.

3. Anemia.
Patient had microcytic anemia with low iron and normal TIBC. Hct
on adsmission was 29.4. This is suggestive of iron deficiency
anemia but warrants outpatient follow-up with colonoscopy.
