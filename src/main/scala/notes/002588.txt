[**Hospital 882**] hospital with severe respiratory distress due to
hypoxia. Patient has been a resident at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab since her
discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2105-6-3**].  During this admission she
was found to have narrow complex tachycardia and anemia. She has
had several admissions to [**Hospital 882**] hospital since that time with

Final Report
CHEST RADIOGRAPH

INDICATION: Chronic heart failure, pneumonia, assessment of
interval change.

COMPARISON: [**2105-7-19**].

FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. Minimal tendency to increasing consolidation at both
lung bases, as
manifested by slight decrease in extent of the previously
visible air
bronchograms. The lung volumes, however, are smaller than on the
previous
image. In the ventilated parts of the lung parenchyma, the
extent of the
pre-existing opacity is unchanged.




Brief Hospital Course:
#.Hypoxia:  Pt presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**7-19**] with respiratory
distress and decreased O2 sats.  Patient was given Ceftazidime,
80mg IV Lasix, nitro paste, and morphine prior to transfer to
[**Hospital1 18**] ED.  Once at [**Hospital1 18**], she was placed on BiPAP with O2Sats
coming up to mid 90s. She was started on broad coverage with
cefepime and levofloxacin for presumed healthcare-associated
pneumonia.  CXR was taken and showed both findings suggestive of
pulmonary edema and opacity probably representing atelectasis or
pleural effusion, but could not rule out infectious processes.
It was decided to continue antibiotic regimen.  Overnight, pt
showed improving oxygen saturation, good urine output, and was
taken off BiPap in the early morning.  It is unclear whether she
suffered flash pulm edema from a supraventricular tachycardia or
infectious etiology, but pt had not produced sputum, and
remained afebrile throughout ICU course.  On [**7-20**], pt was
transferred to the general medicine floor on 4L NC, with sats in
the low 90s.  Pt did not feel short of breath at this time, and
for the remainder of her hospital course.  Lasix was provided IV
upon arrival to the floor, and was switched to PO home dose of
Lasix on [**7-21**].  It was presumed that her hypoxia was due to
pulmonary edema from the patient's CHF.  On the evening of [**7-21**],
pt was able to discontinue O2 and did well until discharge on
[**7-22**], without SOB.
.
#.Diastolic CHF: pt was found to be fluid overloaded on
admission, and pt was given 80 mg IV Lasix twice while in the
ICU.  She was -2L when transferred to the floor, with a slight
rise in Cr.  Lasix was held on the night of [**7-20**], due to this.
In the afternoon of [**7-21**], Cr approached baseline, pt was
switched to PO home dose of Lasix (20 mg qdaily) and continued
to diurese.  Upon discharge, pt was approximately negative
3.5-4L.  Pt was continued on metoprolol while in the hospital,
but was not on spironolactone.  Home doses of Lasix, metoprolol
and spironolactone should be continued upon discharge, as
written.
.
#.C. difficile pancolitis: pt came to the hospital on PO
Vancomycin for C. diff pancolitis, and was originally due to
finish this regimen on [**7-25**].  Due to patient being discharged on
PO levofloxacin for possible HAP, we lengthened this regimen to
avoid relapse to be finished on [**7-31**].  Pt did not complain of
abdominal pain or diarrhea during admission.
.
#.Tachycardia: pt's tachycardia was controlled during
hospita
