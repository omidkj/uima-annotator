Imaging:
CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2155-5-19**] 4:10 PM
1. 6-cm abdominal aortic aneurysm, with both suprarenal and
infrarenal
components. No evidence of aneurysmal rupture.
2. Diverticulosis, with suggestion of mild diverticulitis
involving the
sigmoid colon. No evidence of abscess or free air.
3. 2.5 cm left adnexal cyst. In a postmenopausal patient, this
is abnormal, and could be further evaluated with MRI.
4. Small pericardial effusion.
5. 4-mm nodule in the right lower lobe. In absence of any risk
factors for
malignancy, no further followup is needed. Otherwise, followup
CT at 12
months.

TTE [**5-20**]:
Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild mitral
regurgitation. Increased PCWP.

circumferential mural thrombus that contains calcification.
2. Extensive atherosclerotic calcifications and mural thrombus
along the
aorta, iliac arteries and visualized portion of the femoral
arteries.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient presented with LLQ abdominal pain.  Infrarenal AAA found
at OSH, confirmed here to be measuring 6.6 x 6.0 cm extending to
the aortic bifurcation with a circumferential mural thrombus
that contains calcification.  There was no active bleeding or
signs of dissection.  Abdominal exam revealed TTP LLQ.  AAA was
nontender.  OSH Abd CT scan also showed uncomplicated mild
diverticulitis of the sigmoid colon.  CTA was repeated here and
confirmed these findings.  Patient was started on cipro/flagyl
for mild diverticulitis based on OSH abdominal CT.  We
immediately counseled the patient that she requires operative
repair of her AAA.  She clearly did not want to have surgery at
this time, especially if it required an open procedure.  She
clearly understood the risks of nonoperative management.

Patient was admitted and started on bicarb for planned EVAR
protocol CTA of the abdomen scheduled for the following day.
Overnight the patient developed labile blood pressures that did
not initially responded to fluid boluses.  Vital signs were
otherwise stable.  IV vancomycin was added.  Patient was
transferred to the ICU for monitoring.  General surgery was
consulted, who agreed that she was suffering from a mild case of
diverticulitis.  It was hard to conclude that this mild
infection 100% accounted for her labile blood pressures given
that she clinically did not appear septic.  Cardiac enzymes were
flat.  ECG was nondiagnostic and she denied chest pain during
the entire hospitalization.  Her pressures stabilized with
adequate urine output by morning.  Cardiology consult was
obtained by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who recommended a TTE, stress test, and dob
MIBI.  He believed labile blood pressures were [**3-3**] to fluid
shifts from diverticulitis.

On hospital day 2 a TTE was obtained, showing regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with an EF of 45-50%.  She
underwent an EVAR protocol CT scan w/ 3D recon.  Based on this
can we concluded that she was not a candidate for endovascular
repair of her AAA.  Patient again refused operative management
and clearly understood the risks of deferring treatment.
Incidentally, a 2.5 cm left adnexal cyst was found on her
initial CTA of her abdomen.  Gynecology was consulted, who
recommended a pelvic u/s for further eval.

On hospital day 3 patient underwent a pelvic ultrasound which
showed simple left ovarian cyst measuring 2.3 x 2.9 x 1.8 cm.
Gynecology recommends f/u in clinic. Patient was scheduled an
outpt appointment prior to discharge.  GI was also consulted for
consideration of an outpatient colonoscopy.  An outpatient
appointment for a colonoscopy was scheduled prior to discharge.
She also underwent a dobumatine stress test which showed
reversible ischemic defect involving the entire
inferior wall extending to the apex.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] recommends an
outpatient catheterization.  She will follow up with him as an
outpatient.  Her diet was advanced (low residue).  General
surgery signed off recommending 14 day course of cipro/flagyl.
She will follow up in Dr.[**Name (NI) 670**] clinic in two weeks.

On hospital day 4 patient was tolerating POs, abdominal pain was
improved, and ambulating well.  She was without chest pain.
Again, she was counseled on the warning signs of a ruptured AAA.
 She again clearly stated that she did not want open AAA repair
and clearly understands the risks involved in deferring
treatment.  She will follow up with: gynecology, general
surgery, GI, cardiology, and vascular surgery in 1 month.
