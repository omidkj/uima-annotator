History of Present Illness:
Delightful 70y/o gentleman who is well known to me. He suffered
from
tracheobronchomalacia and required a right thoracotomy with
tracheobronchoplasty. He did well initially from that, but
subsequently developed recurrent dyspnea and was recently
found on functional bronchoscopy to have progression to his
untreated cervical trachea. In underwent a stenting trial
with a wire stent and had an excellent response. Therefore,
we took him forward for surgical repair.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2163-12-18**] 9:58 AM
Reason: please eval for interval change
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
70 year old man with tracheomalacia s/p repair
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please eval for interval change
AP CHEST PERFORMED ON [**2163-12-18**].
HISTORY: 70-year-old man with tracheomalacia status post repair.
Evaluate for interval change.
FINDINGS: Compared to previous study from [**2163-12-16**].
There is again seen a catheter within the lower trachea
consistent with the recent tracheal repair. The cardiac
silhouette and mediastinum are within normal limits. There are
no focal infiltrates or pulmonary edema. There is some minimal
blunting of the left CP angle suggestive of a small pleural
effusion.
