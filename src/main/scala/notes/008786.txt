History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 45yo M with HIV (well controlled on ART with CD4
542 [**1-6**] and VL<75) and pulmonary fibrosis presenting with a day
of high fevers, chills, cough and post-tussive emesis.
.
Of note, the patient had a similar presentation in [**2138-3-27**]
and was briefly in the ICU for hypotension with similar
presenting symptoms. Diagnostic studies at that time were
unremarkable and he was diagnosed with respiratory viral
illness.
.
In the ED, initial VS were 105.9, 130, 126/107, 18, 98%RA. He
received tylenol 1g, motrin 600mg, ceftazadime 1g, azithro
500mg, bactrim DS 1 tab, tamiflu 75mg. Patient got 3L of IVF and
had normal lactate of 1.3. CXR showed known fibrosis and CT head
was unremarkable. Vitals prior to transfer were 110, 109/74, 23,
94% RA.
.
On the floor, he reports feeling well the day prior to admission
but developing rapid onset of fevers, chills, sweats and
worsening productive cough today. Patient endorses coughing fits
and then has post-tussive n/v. He has some SOB and mild headache
during the coughing fit but no SOB or HA at rest. No chest pain,
constant headache, neck stiffness, visual changes, dysuria or
hematuria. No diarrhea or constipation. No known sick contacts
but he is a bus driver. No recent travel or unusual foods.


Past Medical History:
HIV (dx at least 7 years years ago). Currently on HAART and PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) **].  Hypothyroidism. Pulmonary fibrosis. MGUS. Systemic
sclerosis. Raynaud's phenomenon. Previous hospitalizations for
viral pneumonias.


Social History:
Lives in [**Location 686**], MA with brother. [**Name (NI) 1403**] with juvenile
delinquents in a detention center. Occasionally uses marijuana.
No smoking or alcohol use. Not currently sexually active.
Contracted HIV from homosexual partner.


Family History:
Brother has scleroderma. Otherwise NC

[**2139-5-15**] CT head:
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
.
[**5-16**] CXR:
IMPRESSION:
1. New ground-glass and consolidative opacities, which could
represent
pulmonary edema, opportunistic infection such as PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
hemorrhage, or acute exacerbation of known interstitial lung
disease.
2. Widened mediastinum is likely a combination of enlarged main
pulmonary
artery from pulmonary arterial hypertension and distended venous
structures.  However, attention to the mediastinum on standard
PA and lateral chest x-ray would be helpful when the patient's
condition permits.
.
CT abdomen ([**2139-5-16**]) -
1. Thickened appendiceal wall resulting in an appendix measuring
16mm in diameter. No luminal distention to suggest obstruction
or features of acute appendicitis such as peri-appendceal
stranding or fluid. Differential diagnosis includes appendiceal
neoplasm (cystadenoma, adeocarcinoma, carcinoid), granulomatous
process of the appendix such as TB, or possibly other unusual
inflammatory processes (e.g. crohns, chronic appendicitis).
However, clinical correlation is recommended.
2. Retroperitoneal and pelvic adenopathy, stable and unchanged
when compared to prior CT, likely related to known systemic
sclerosis / HIV.
3. Bibasilar fibrosis consistent with known UIP and systemic
sclerosis. There has been an increase in thickening of the
pleura on the right side since Chest CT [**2137**].
.
[**2139-5-19**] CT chest:
IMPRESSION:

1. Basilar-predominant pulmonary fibrosis, most compatible with
fibrotic NSIP related to the patient's known diagnosis of
scleroderma. Associated
esophageal dilatation also related to scleroderma is also noted.

2. Extensive new ground-glass opacities seen throughout both
lungs, most
apparent at the right apex. This is most likely infectious in
etiology.
Given the history of HIV, PCP should be considered. Atypical
infectious
processes such as mycoplasma or viral pneumonias are also
likely. Bacterial or fungal pneumonia is considered less likely
given the radiographic appearance. Of note, the history of NSIP
raises the additional possibility of acute interstitial
pneumonia, though this would be a diagnosis of exclusion.
3. Septal thickening, suggesting mild interstitial edema.
4. Stable mediastinal adenopathy, likely reactive.
5. Prominence of the main pulmonary artery, suggesting pulmonary

hypertension.
.
[**2139-5-23**] CXR:
FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The heart remains enlarged. On
background chronic basal predominant interstitial changes,
ground-glass opacities have increased within the right
hemithorax, particularly in the upper lobe. This may reflect
worsening infection (especially atypical infection such as PCP),
worsening edema, or less likely acute worsening of the
background interstitial process.  There is a small right-sided
pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is appreciated.
.
[**2139-5-24**] CXR:
FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The heart is moderately enlarged.
Superimposed on background chronic basal predominant
interstitial changes, ground-glass
opacities, particularly within the right hemithorax have mildly
decreased in extent. The findings may reflect infection or
mildly improving edema. There is a small right-sided pleural
effusion. No pneumothorax is appreciated.
