IMAGING:

[**5-9**] CT abd/pelvis with contrast:
1. Bibasilar opacities including partial right middle lobe
collapse and
small-to-moderate bilateral effusions concerning for pneumonia.
2. Foley balloon inflated in the prostate.
3. Several indeterminate renal cysts, for which ultrasound
should be
performed to better evaluate. ***
4. Inflammatory stranding in the right colon with possible wall
thickening
may reflect mild, resolving colitis. Sigmoid diverticulosis
without
diverticulitis.
5. Status post gastric bypass without obstruction.
6. No subcutaneous air.

[**5-10**] Scrotal ultrasound:
Heterogeneous appearance to bilateral testicles, which are of
normal size. Arterial waveforms could be identified; however,
venous waveforms could not be identified. Torsion in a patient
of this age would be very unusual and the presence of arterial
flow essential excludes torsion.

Brief Hospital Course:
71 yo M s/p trach/peg who presents from LTAC with fever, cough,
and abdominal pain.

1. Respiratory Failure: Fever, leukocytosis, and CXR findings
supportive of a multifocal, vent-associated pneumonia; also with
right middle lobe collapse, bilateral effusions, and worsening
pulmonary edema. He was maintained on CPAP and started on
vancomycin and cefepime. Patient still with fevers to 102 prior
to discharge so started on standing Tylenol tid, but WBC slowly
improving on discharge. His lasix was initially held but
restarted at home dose of 20 mg IV bid on discharge.
* Plan for 8-day course of vancomycin and cefepime; last dose on
[**5-17**].
* Check vancomycin trough at 7pm on [**5-11**] and as needed
thereafter
* Follow up pending sputum (gram neg rods on stain), blood, and
urine cultures
* Adjust lasix dose as indicated

2. Colitis: Pt with a history of C. diff. He was empirically
started on flagyl and po vancomycin on [**5-9**] at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.
Here, he was initially continued on po vancomycin. However, CT
abdomen showed mild resolving colitis, and C. diff toxins
returned negative, so po vancomycin was stopped on day of
discharge.

3. Scrotal swelling/tenderness: Scrotal ultrasound unremarkable
with absent venous waveform but normal arterial inflow. Urology
consult felt this was not consistent with testicular torsion and
highly unlikely given age and bilateral presentation. [**Month (only) 116**]
represent a mild orchitis; scrotal elevation and
anti-inflammatories recommended. Potential infection would be
treated with his current antibiotic regimen for pneumonia.

4. Positive troponin: Mildly elevated on presentation but
patient without chest pain. Repeat troponin was flat, ruling out
MI. This likely represented mild demand in the setting of
infection. He was continued on his ASA and beta blocker.

5. Hypertension: Continued on outpatient amlodipine, metoprolol,
and lisinopril. Lasix restarted prior to discharge. Hydralazine
was discontinued.

6. Anemia: Hct remained stable in 27 to 30 range.

7. Depression: Continued citalopram.

8. Gout: Continued allopurinol.

9. Hypothyroid: Continued levothyroxine.

10. H/o GI Bleed: Continued sucralfate and omeprazole.

11. Incidental finding: CT Abd/pelvis showed "several
indeterminate renal cysts."
* Ultrasound recommended for better evaluation.

12. Code status: Pt confirmed full code with alternate HCP (son)
present.
