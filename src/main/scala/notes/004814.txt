Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
Interstitial Pulmonary Fibrosis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
 77 yr old hx of CRI, RUL NSLCA s/p cyberknife treatment [**9-26**],
UIP, emphysema on 4L liquid o2 baseline doe presenting with
worsening DOE, SOB x 3 days.
.
At home, noted sneezing, cough with blood tinged sputum and
increasing sob. Usually can walk several feet w/o acute
worsening of SOB as per patient, but reports dyspnea and acute
sob when walking 30 feet. At baseline patient >90 % on 4L liquid
oxygen recently but to 86% with ambulation. today 73% 4L with
ambulation. No pleuritic chest pain, fever, chills, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or myalgias. Patient noted
mild LE edema over several days right mildly greater than left.
Given symptoms to ED.
.
Recent admission [**Date range (1) 19503**] with respiratory distress.
Transferred to the ICU, BAL performed with blood in airway. CT
scan demonstrated new, diffuse ground-glass opacity with
intralobular reticulation in the left lung and right upper lobe,
less in the right lower lobe. These findings were thought to be
due to [**Date range (1) **], diffuse
infection, or acute exacerbation of interstitial lung disease.
Levofloxacin and cefepime for eight day course treatment.He was
covered for PCP with treatment dose bactrim and 1mg/kg IV
steroids. Bactrim changed to prophylaxis dose on [**9-5**] based on
negative beta-glucan/galactomannan and smere. On discharge
improved 91% on 6L on prednisone taper for which patient is
currently on 25 mg.
.
In ED, Vitals 96.6, 110, 142/66, 18, 85%4L. 91% to 95% on 6L.
Exam decreased breath sounds right lower lobe CXR unremarkable.
EKG sinus tach no ST changes. Standard labs at baseline. Lactate
1.3. 1L fluid given. CT chest for PE negative. NAC and bicarb
prior to CT scan. Levo 750 IV x 1 given. Patient admitted for
further work up.

Pertinent Results:

Labs
=======

=======
Radiology
=======
CTA Chest [**10-8**]  -
1. Emphysema with interval progression of interstitial lung
disease with
ground- glass opacity, reticulation and honeycombing, most
prominent in the
lower lobes. Given the calcification in the pleura, patient has
likely had
prior asbentos exposure and diffuse lung disease may be due to
asbestosis.
2. No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
3. Calcified granulomas in the lover, spleen, and lungs, likely
sequelae of
prior granulomatous lung disease.

CXR [**10-8**] -
here has been no interval change allowing for differences in
technique. Mid and lower lung opacities are again noted
corresponding to
ground glass and reticular opacities seen on CT. The wedge-
shaped peripheral opacity of the right lung is unchanged. There
is no evidence of superimposed pneumonia. No pleural effusion or
pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
Calcified pleural plaques are compatible with prior asbestos
exposure.

TTE - [**10-11**]
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. The left ventricular cavity
size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve is not well
seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body
habitus. Left ventricular function is probably normal, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right
ventricle is not well seen. No pathologic valvular abnormality
seen. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined.


Brief Hospital Course:
77yoM with NSCLCA s/p cyberknife, Radiation Pneumonitis presents
with worsening hypoxia.

# SOB/Acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Patient
likely had exacerbation if ILD [**1-21**] steroid taper as outpatient.
Completed Bronscopsopy with BAL performed day of admission was
negative for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 11381**] or other infection. Per report, there were
no endobronchial lesions and no purulent secretions seen.  CTA
negative for PE, but demonstrates evidence of worsening ground
glass opacities. Blood cxs NGTD. Patient was empirically treated
with Levaquin for CAP. Patient triggered for hypoxia on [**10-10**]
and was transferred to the ICU. Antibiotics were intially
broadened to Vanco/Cefepime given poor reserve function and
worsening CT but pt did not exhibit s/s infection without fever
and all cultures were no growth, including BAL so these were
stopped. There was also concern for antibiotics causing
myelosuppression. He was continued on NAC for IPF. Respiratory
status improved on [**10-15**] and pt weaned to O2 4L via nasal
cannula from ventimask. Symptoms including SPB and tachypnea
also improved. Beta agonists avoided given tahcycardia.
Rheumatology and IP were following and recommended starting
Cellcept for steroid responsive pulmonary disease, ? vasculitis.
This was deferred over the weekend due to improvement in
clinical status. He completed a 3 day course of Solumedrol 1g IV
daily and was transitioned on [**10-14**] to PO prednisone 70mg PO
daily with intended slow taper. The pt was discharged on
Prednisone 60mg, and was given scripts to hold him through his
one week tapers to 50mg.
.
Please note, the patient recieved Inhaled Pentamadine while in
the ICU. He was discharged with follow-up appointment for his
next dose.

# ARF: Pt Cr had been elevated to 2.2 in setting of lasix
administration. Baseline around 1.8. Diuresis and HCTZ were held
given patient clinically euvolemic and creatinine imporved to
1.4 [**10-15**].  His Creatinine was 1.2 on the day of discharge.
.
# tachycardia: patient experienced episodes of MAT vs. sinus
tach with PACs. No evidence of PE on exam, and CT negative.
Monitored on telemetry. Controlled with Diltiazam 30mg QID.

# Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Patient has had progressive
hematocrit and platelet drop. He was guaiac negative.
Normocytic, low retics, Total Bili WNL. Pt with known AOCD. It
was thought anemia may be [**1-2
