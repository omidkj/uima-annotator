Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
77F copd on home O2, metastatic CA with presumed lung primary
opting for palliative care, DNR/DNI, T3 lung Ca s/p R
pneumonectomy, dm2, who now p/w SOB. Of note, she was recently
admitted [**Date range (1) 80833**] to [**Hospital1 18**] for PNA. She had recently been found
to have metastatic disease to bone and liver of undetermined
origin. After a non-diagnostic liver biopsy during a previous
admission, she ultimately decided to pursue palliative care and
eschew further efforts at biopsy to obtain a diagnosis. This is
now her fourth admission since [**Month (only) **]. She was living at home
with services since her discharge on [**6-7**]. She states that she
is mostly bed bound, never leaves her home. She has DOE at her
baseline and is on home O2 of 3L. She states that over the past
couple of days her breathing has been worse. She denies f/c,
cough. She does endorse abd pain and nausea. She was brought to
the ED by ambulance from home.
   In the ED initial VS: T 99.1  109  112/69  36  98 4L NC. She
was noted to be in a-fib. She was given nebulizers, solumedrol
125 IV x1 to treat copd flare, Vanc/levo to treat possible PNA.
She was given dilt 120 mg PO x1 to treat the a-fib which had
increased in rate to 140s. She briefly required non-invasive
ventilation in the ED for roughly one hour. Initial gas
7.25/101/99 improved to 7.33/81/62. she was admitted to MICU for
further evaluation.

Past Medical History:
1. Lung cancer:
   - T3 N0 large cell s/p R pneumonectomy in [**2191-12-20**]
2. Breast cancer:
   - Ductal carcinoma in situ (left breast) s/p lumpectomy in
[**2177**]
3. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
4. ?CAD --> negative MIBI [**2189**]
5. Diabetes mellitus
6. Hypercholesterolemia
7. Cartaract

Social History:
Lives with her niece in [**Location (un) 669**] who helps with most of her ADLs.

Her significant other frequently visits. Occasional alcohol use,

smoked 2 packs per day x 30 yrs prior to lung Ca

Family History:
Mother with breast cancer 74, diabetes in mother

Physical Exam:
VS: Temp: 98.4  BP: 126/68   HR: 83  RR: 22  O2sat: 92 50% VM
GEN: awake, alert, comfortable appearing on face mask oxygen
HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, anicteric, MMM, op without lesions
NECK: no supraclavicular or cervical lymphadenopathy, no jvd,
RESP: Absent breath sounds on R, prolong exp phase on L with
minimal wheezing.
CV: irreg irreg, no m/r/g
ABD: nd, +b/s, soft, nt, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly
EXT: no c/c/e

Pertinent Results:
Labs: see below
.
EKG:  a-fib at 145, LAD, narrow QRS, no ischemic changes
.
Imaging:
.
Portable abdomen:
IMPRESSION:  Non-obstructive bowel gas pattern.  Patient is
apparently undergoing oral prep for CT scan.
.
CXR:
Impression: Nonspecific findings are consistent with
lymphangitic spread of carcinoma left lung. Less likely
differential diagnosis would include chronic fluid overload in
emphysematous patient.  Appearances are not typical for
infectious etiology.


Brief Hospital Course:
77F copd on home O2, metastatic CA with presumed lung primary
opting for palliative care, DNR/DNI, T3 lung Ca s/p R
pneumonectomy, dm2, who now p/w SOB likely COPD flare.
.
1. Resp distress:
Likely [**1-22**] COPD flare in setting of very tenuous baseline
status. Pt had FEV1 of 0.5 preop before the pneumonectomy. On 3L
home 02. CHF was believed less likely. PNA is unlikely given pt
is afebrile and without leokocytosis. Lymphangitic spread of
tumor is a possibility. PE is a consideration particularly given
the risk factor of CA, although although with treatment of COPD
the patient returned to her home O2 requirement so CTA chest
deferred as alternative Dx more likely. Treated initially with
solumedrol then transitioned to prednison to complete 5 day
course (40-30-20-10-5-off), azithromycin day [**3-24**], nebulizers as
needed. She also responded well to morphine for subjective
dyspnea.
.
2. Afib/flutter:
No known prior history. Hemodynamically stable. CHADS 3 so would
benefit from anticoagulation but risk of bleeding likely
outweighs mortality from metastatic lung CA so coumdain not
started. Continued on ASA 81mg daily and diltiazem for rate
control. TSH mildly decreased (0.15) but difficult to interpret
in setting of acute illness; could consider repeating as an
outpatient.
.
3. Lung CA with liver and bone Lesions:
These likely represent metastases. Pt has decided in the past
not to pursue further diagnostics given that she had no
intentions of undergoing chemotherapy, radiation or surgery
except for palliation. Code status is DNR/DNI. Palliative care
consulted.
.
4. Abd pain:
Rapidly resolved. KUB and exam unremarkable. No further
symptoms.
.
5. Diabetes mellitus:
Was recently discharged with increased glargine (8 -> 10units),
and this was uptitrated in setting of steroids. [**Month (only) 116**] need to
decrease as taper steroids. RISS.
.
# Hypertension:
c/w bp regimen
.
# ?UTI: Urinalysis dirty. Remains afebrile but with rising WBC
count. Will recheck U/A and send culture, consider starting
antibiotics if positive however asymptomatic.
.
7. Episcleritis:
Complained of eye pain and was seen by optho during her last
admission who felt she had episcleritis; started on Polyvinyl
Alcohol-Povidone and Erythromycin treatments.
.
FEN:  Regular diet
Access:  PIVs
PPx: Hep SQ, ppi
DISPO:  Call out to floor
