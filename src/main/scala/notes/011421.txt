PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Physical examination
in the Emergency Room revealed vital signs with a temperature
of 98.9, blood pressure was 110/70, heart rate was 86,
respiratory was 20, oxygen saturation was 90% on 2 liters.
In general, she was in no acute distress.  Examination of the
head and neck revealed mucous membranes were dry.  No teeth.
No increased jugular venous pressure.  Cardiovascular
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs,
rubs or gallops.  Normal first heart sound and second heart
sound.  A [**2-24**] murmur in the left lower sternal border.  Lungs
revealed diffuse rhonchi, crackles at the bases (left greater
than right).  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended. No hepatosplenomegaly.  Positive bowel sounds.
Extremities revealed no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Neurologically, awake and oriented times three.  Cranial
nerves II through XII were intact.  Motor was grossly
nonfocal.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratory
examination revealed white blood cell count was 11,
hematocrit was 37, platelets were 391.  PT was 13.2, INR
was 1.2, PTT was 30.9.  Chemistry-7 revealed sodium was 144,
potassium was 4.5, chloride was 101, bicarbonate was 28,
blood urea nitrogen was 12, creatinine was 0.8, and blood
glucose was 120.  Urinalysis was negative.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   A chest x-ray showed bibasilar
infiltrates and a large hiatal hernia.

Electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with a rate
of 96; no change from prior baseline.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the hospital
for treatment of bibasilar pneumonia.  She was treated with
levofloxacin initially.

The patient initially did well on antibiotic therapy;
however, several days into her course she had an episode of
respiratory failure for which she was intubated and
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.

Antibiotic coverage was broadened at that time.  A further
evaluation over the next several days included a CT scan
which revealed a right middle lobe mass, and a bronchoscopy
which diagnosed cancer by cytology.  The patient failed to
improve despite maximal medical therapy including mechanical
ventilation, broad spectrum antibiotics, and circulatory
support.

The family was informed of the grave prognosis.  On [**7-16**]
life support was withdrawn, and the patient passed.  The date
of death was [**7-16**].  The cause of death was pneumonia and
respiratory failure.
