Admission Date: [**2140-5-31**]        Discharge Date: [**2140-6-3**]


Service:  MED


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 81 year-old
male with a past medical history of coronary artery disease,
three vessel disease refusing coronary artery bypass graft,
congestive heart failure with an EF of 20 percent with recent
atrial fibrillation, with recent pacer ICD placement on [**2140-5-23**] at [**Hospital1 69**] for sick
sinus syndrome, type 2 diabetes who has been at [**Hospital3 7511**] since his discharge from [**Hospital1 188**] on [**2140-5-27**]. He was sent to the Emergency
Department for an intravenous access as the patient had been
taking poor po and his creatinine had been rising.  Upon
arrival to the Emergency Department the patient's vital signs
were initially a heart rate of 70, blood pressure 100/60,
satting 100 percent on room air.  The patient's blood
pressure then dropped to the low 80s.  He was given 1500 cc
of normal saline, but subsequently dropped his O2 sats
recurring a nonrebreather.  At that point Dopamine was begun,
however, was changed to Levophed secondary to ventricular
ectopy.  Cardiology was consulted in the Emergency Department
who performed a bedside echocardiogram that was unchanged
from his prior showing no pericardial effusion.  Of note the
patient's hematocrit was noted to be down to 26 from 37.  On
history obtained through interpreter and through wife the
patient had decreased po and lethargy at the nursing home,
but denied any symptoms.  Of note the patient had a fall at
the rehab on [**5-28**].  There was no injuries.  His Foley was
pulled out, but it was replaced.

to 89/50 up to 100/61.  Respiratory rate 24.  O2 sats 100
percent on nonrebreather.  In general, the patient is an
elderly male in no acute distress.  Oriented times two not to
place.  HEENT pupils are equal, round and reactive to light.
Extraocular movements intact.  Oropharynx is clear.  Sclera
anicteric.  On the neck there was a left EJ present with
elevated jugular venous distension to the jaw.  Heart was
regular rate and rhythm without murmurs.  Lungs were sclera
to auscultation anteriorly with decreased breath sounds to
the bases bilaterally.  Abdomen soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.  Extremities 1 to 2
plus lower extremity edema bilaterally.  Neurological
oriented times two to person and place.

Left anterior oblique
White blood cell count 9, hematocrit 26, platelets 248, BUN
78, creatinine 2.3, INR 5.1. Chest x-ray showed unchanged
cardiomegaly.  No evidence of congestive heart failure.
Electrocardiogram was 70 beats per minute and paced.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Hypertension:  It was felt that hypovolemia secondary to a
   poor po and possible due to blood loss anemia or the
   likely cause of the patient's low blood pressure.  He was
   quickly weaned off any pressors and responded to
   intravenous fluids in the first few hours after admission
   and had stable blood pressure throughout.  His blood
   pressure medications were held and restarted at a lower
   dose with his Toprol XL being decreased to 50 mg a day and
   his ace inhibitor being held in the setting of renal
   dysfunction.  The patient was encouraged to take better
   po. It was felt that decreased intake was likely leading
   to dehydration and thus hypotension in this gentleman with
   fragile congestive heart failure.  He was watched in the
   Intensive Care Unit for three days without instability and
   it was felt that he was stable on his new blood pressure
   regimen.

1. Anemia:  The patient's hematocrit was stable throughout
   his stay.  He was guaiac negative and it was unclear where
   the drop of hematocrit came. His hemolysis laboratories
   were negative.  He was transfused 2 units of packed red
   blood cells to keep his hematocrit greater then 30.  His
   iron studies came back showing iron deficiency anemia.  It
   was felt that he possibly had a slow bleed in his
   gastrointestinal tract, although that was not proven.  It
   is recommended that he have an outpatient gastrointestinal
   workup including likely a colonoscopy.  He was started on
   iron pills.

1. Congestive heart failure:  the patient was felt to be
   euvolemic at the time of discharge.  He received some
   Lasix with his blood products, otherwise did not require
   much diuresis.  He was continued on his Toprol XL at a
   lower dose and his ace inhibitor was held, but this should
   be restarted as an outpatient as long as his creatinine
   returns to normal.  Additionally, he was started on 20 mg
   a day of Lasix to try to remain euvolemic.

1. Coronary artery disease:  The patient had a mildly
   elevated troponin of .10, however, this was in the setting
   of hypotension and given the patient's refusal of coronary
   artery bypass graft in the past this was not pursued.  He
   was continued on his aspirin and statin and beta blocker
   and his ace will be restarted as an outpatient.

1. Increased INR:  The patient's Coumadin was held and
   allowed his INR to drift down.  It was 3.1 at the time of
   discharge.  He will be restarted on 2.5 mg of Coumadin a
   day with frequent monitoring at [**Hospital1 **].  The patient
   will need to have a discussion with his primary care
   physicians and his rehab physicians in regard to the
   safety of Coumadin in this gentleman that may be a fall
   risk.

1. Type 2 diabetes:  The patient's Glucophage was off likely
   due to his renal dysfunction.  He was maintained on a
   regular insulin sliding scale, but did not require any
   insulin so he will be sent out without any oral
   hyperglycemics.

1. Renal:  The patient was likely prerenal with an increased
   BUN to creatinine ratio and a FENA less then 1 percent.
   He was gently hydrated and his creatinine was improving at
   the time of discharge.  This will need to be followed up
   as an outpatient and his ace inhibitor restarted when it
   returns to his baseline of around 1.3 to 1.5.


DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is discharged to [**Hospital1 **] for
rehab in stable condition and instructed to have his weights
followed daily and to have his Lasix adjusted if his weight
increases by three pounds, to adhere to a 2 gram sodium diet.
He will likely need a colonoscopy and he is to have this
discussion with outpatient doctor.  He will need to have his
ace inhibitor restarted when his creatinine returns to
normal.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Dehydration.

Anemia of iron deficiency.

Congestive heart failure.

ARF.

Type 2 diabetes.

Coronary artery disease.

FOLLOW UP:  Follow up with his primary care physician within
one week.  Follow up with cardiology on [**2140-6-8**] at
10:00 a.m.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Amiodarone 300 mg q.d. times two weeks and then 200 mg a
   day thereafter.
2. Lipitor 40 mg a day.
3. Aspirin 325 a day.
4. Iron sulfate 325 mg once a day.
5. Colace 100 mg twice a day.
6. Lasix 20 mg a day.
7. Toprol XL 50 mg a day.
8. Coumadin 2.5 mg a day.
9. Protonix 40 mg a day.
