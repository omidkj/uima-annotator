Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5790**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2154-6-28**] Cervical tracheal resection and reconstruction
bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage.
[**2154-7-4**] Bronchoscopy
[**2154-7-8**] Bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 71 yo M w/a hx of CAD s/p emergent CABG c/b
wound dehiscence, infection, and overall prolonged hospital
stay requiring tracheostomy in [**2149**] who developed post
intubation
tracheal stenosis.  Since his decannulation and departure from
the hospital, the patient has had persistent difficulties
breathing.  For example:  He is unable to lie flat; lying flat
he
feels as though he will suffocate and becomes severely short of
breath.  While talking he becomes short of breath subjectively,
and has to cough in order to relieve his symptoms.  He needs to
cough to feel better multiple times per hour.  He does continue
to become short of breath walking (can walk approximately one
block prior to SOB, and one flight of stairs); interestingly,
this is actually worse per the patient since prior to his CABG.
Per report, he has actually had five hospitalizations since his
CABG for the same complaint.  These symptoms are persistent and
have not improved at all since his prolonged hospitalization in
[**2149**].  Again, last week he developed a "cold," describing a
runny
nose, dry, non-productive cough, unrelieved w/OTC meds, feeling
"warm" but no fever or chills; symtoms were similar to a cold he
had in the fall [**2153**].  The cough occurred "nonstop"; he was
unable to sleep, and so went to the ED at [**Hospital **] Hospital.
There, he was admitted for URI and possible asthma exacerbation;
CXR was unremarkable, however, given recurrence of his symptoms
he underwent pulmonology consultation; the pulmonologist was
concerned with his symptoms as described above, and so the
patient underwent CT scans.  CT scan of the neck revealed focal
stenosis of the trachea at the level of the thyroid gland in
both
inspiration and
expiration; severe bronchomalacia involoving the right [**Hospital1 **], and
less severe bronchomalacia involving the left main stem
bronchus;
Chest CT revealed chronic obstruction of right lower lobe
airways, plate-like bibasilar atelectasis

Past Medical History:

grafts) c/b wound infection, dehisence "plastic surgery," c/b

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was seen in outpatient clinic and found to have
tracheobronchomalaicia involving the right bronchus intermedius
as well as the left main stem bronchus and was scheduled for
tracheal reconstruction on [**2154-6-28**]. The patient tolerated the
procedure and was admitted to the unit for acute management of
respiratory distress. The patient was started on mucomyst as
well as humidified air to assist in clearing his airways, and
continued to have occasional desaturations. On [**7-1**] the patient
was found to be mildly acidotic, and also was having acutely
worsening chest pain and respiratory status. Trops were sent and
were stable at .1-.2, and an ekg was taken. The patients
findings were attributed to demand ischemia as well as
underlying renal dysfunction (Cr to ~3), and the patient was
transfused 1 U pRBC's with sig resolution of his abnormalities.
Renal function & UOP improved and the pt's symptoms resolved.
Cardiology was consulted, and the patients meds were changed
according to their recommendations. On [**7-4**] the patient was noted
to have continuing hoarseness and bronchoscopy was performed
which showed mild edema of one vocal cord, but no vocal cord
dysfunction. The patient was determined to have adequate swallow
function and his diet was advanced appropriately. The patient
was moved to the floor and followed until his stay suture could
be removed on [**Month (only) 205**] fourth. He was seen by PT and scheduled for
outpatient follow up. [**7-6**] stay suture removed continue with
ambulation -adv diet rehab screening. [**2154-7-8**] patient developed
stidor, stable o2 sats and abg. serial cardiac enzymes ordered
EKG unchanged. Treated with sl NTG. and give 0.25mg of ativan.
Bronchoscopy by IP-wealling at vocal cords and some sloughing at
anastamosis.  Protonix 4omg [**Hospital1 **] to protect site.  Lower
extremity edema with blisters.  Wound care counsult acquecel
dressing bilaterlly elevation dressing to be changed daily.
Lasix 40 mg IV daily pre-op weight 108 kg on [**2154-7-10**] wt 117 kg.
Following Cr on [**7-10**] level 1.7 up from 1.5.  Geriatrics consult
reccommends lorazepam at night 0.25mg for sleep and one to two
doses per day prn for anxiety.  On [**2154-7-11**] repeat Btonchoscopy
patient found to have 60% necrosis of trachea patient brought to
Operating Room on [**2154-7-11**] at 3:35pm.The patient was taken to the
OR emergently for revision/T-tube/muscle-flap. The patient
remained intubated using ETT in the unit until the surgical
repair healed for nearly 2 weeks. The vac was placed to trach
site was placed since last surgery. on [**2154-7-12**] the Picc line
was placed. He was empiric covered with Vancomycin,
ciprofloxacin, Flagyl, and fluconazol for contamination of neck
wound. on [**7-15**]: G-tube placed. On [**7-16**]: Bedside ECHO c/w
decreased intravascular fluid we discontinued lasix. TFs
started.[**7-17**]: Transfused x1U for low UOP, nl pressures. BS 300 -
started on Lantus. he was Somnolent overnight - midaz stopped.
[**7-18**]: Patient returned to the OR as the ETT has dislodged and
migrated out of the t-tube. VAC changed, granulation tissue
appears well, chin resutured to the chest. Restarted Midazolam
as pt tried to pull on the tube. Lantus and insulin gtt started
for BG control.[**7-19**]: Patient still on MMV with adequate
overbreathing. Attempting to keep midaz to minimum. Large, loose
amt of stool, Cdiff toxins sent. Lasix inc to 20mg tid w/ goal
of -1L. Wound vac with poor suction.
[**7-22**]: Patient oxygenating well on CPAP. Continued increased
yellow thick sputum - cx: 4+ gram neg diplococci.
