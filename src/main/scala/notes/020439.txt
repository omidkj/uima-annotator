Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 64**]
Chief Complaint:
On presentation to ICU: Hypotension after right THA

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right total hip arthroplasty

History of Present Illness:
67 yo M with complicated past medical history who had an
elective total right hip arthroplasty earlier today. During the
surgery he received 3500 mL of crystalloid and had 965 mL of
UOP. He was reported to have an EBL of 600 mL. He was noted to
be hypotensive in the PACU following the operation and was given
a single unit of PRBC with little effect on blood pressure. His
HCT was measured as 30.4 after that unit of blood (down from
baseline HCT of 33.8 pre-op). Additionally, patient had very low
urine output of < 5 mL/hr. He was placed on phenylephrine
peripherally to support his blood pressure and a transfer to the
ICU was requested. The PACU anesthesia attending was concerned
about fluid status and possibility of volume overload given that
patient is an extremely difficult intubation and has required
fiberoptic intubation in the past.

[**2145-11-2**]: Right hip film:
Since the study of [**2145-3-10**], the patient has undergone a
total hip
arthroplasty. The current films are somewhat limited by
exposure. The
metallic components are in expected position. There is a
cerclage wire at the level of the lesser trochanter. The penile
prosthesis is partially
visualized. IMPRESSION: There has been a total hip arthroplasty.

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU course:

67 year old male with complicated past medical history who had
an elective total right hip arthroplasty on [**2145-11-2**].

#. Post Operative Hypotension:  He had post-operative
hypotension requiring phenylephrine to keep mean blood pressure
in the 60s. His hypotension was associated with urine output
less than 5 mL/hr.  He was felt to be hypovolemic and was fluid
resuscitated with approximately 2 liters of LR.  It was felt
that he was likely third spacing after his hip surgery.
Post-operatively his hematocrit dropped slightly and he was also
given 1 unit of blood.

#. Hip fracture: His pain was relatively well-controlled,
initially with a Dilaudid PCA and then with oral Dilaudid prn.
He was also given Valium for anxiety and muscle spasms.  He was
given two doses of Vancomycin post-operatively.  His JP drain
was pulled on POD 1.

#. Acute on chronic renal failure: His creatinine increased
slightly from baseline (2.8 to 3.5) after admission, most likely
of prerenal etiology due to volume depletion. It trended down
with IV fluids.

#. Code Status: Full Code

Floor course
The patient
was initially treated with a PCA followed by PO pain medications
on POD#1.  The
patient received IV antibiotics for 24 hours postoperatively, as
well as lovenox
for DVT prophylaxis starting on the morning of POD#1.   The
drain was removed
without incident on POD#1. The Foley catheter was removed
without incident on POD 4 after a voiding trial. The
surgical dressing was removed on POD#2 and the surgical incision
was found to be
clean, dry, and intact without erythema or purulent drainage.

While in the hospital, the patient was seen daily by physical
therapy. Labs were
checked throughout the hospital course and repleted accordingly.
At the time of
discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling
well.  The
patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient's hematocrit was stable, and the patient's pain was
adequately
controlled on a PO regimen. The operative extremity was
neurovascularly intact
and the wound was benign. The patient was discharged to home
with services or
rehabilitation in a stable condition.  The patient's
weight-bearing status was
weight bearing as tolerated with posterior precautions.
