Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath
Fatigue

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal Intubation


History of Present Illness:
63 year-old man with a history of obesity, longstanding
hypertension, diastolic heart failure with preserved LVEF,
anemia, mild chronic kidney disease, hyperparathyroidism, and
MGUS who has felt sick for 1 week with shortness of breath. He
states that over the past week he has been increasingly dyspneic
and fatigued. He also was experiencing dyspnea on exertion,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and orthopnea. He also noted chills
and cough productive of white yellow sputum and decreased
energy. He denied fever. He was unable to assess his ankle
swelling and does not check his weight. He also stated that he
had been eating a diet of "junk food" which is baseline for him.
He had been admitted for CHF in [**2190**], otherwise his CHF had been
relatively well controlled on his home medication.
.
On presentation to the ED his vitals were T 98.2, HR 65, BP
97/62, RR 20, Sat 92% RA. He denied CP, numbness, tingling. He
appeared fluid overloaded but had SBP 90-100, so the ED gave 500
cc bolus and then Lasix 60mg IV. He was also given an ASA 81mg.
He had a CXR which showed no acute process. D dimer was
negative. BNP 5088.
.
Initially on the floor his vital signs were T 96.9, BP 148/97,
HR 71, RR 22, SpO2 93% 3L NC, 152.9kg (335 lbs).  Over the next
several hours he became progressively more lethargic, and was
found to have an oxygen saturation of 80% on 3L. On a NRB his
oxygen saturation improved to 91%. He was given an additional
40mg of IV lasix with minimal improvement. His ABG revealed a pH
of 7.21 and a pCO2 of 111
.
On review of systems, he has had a history fo bleeding at time
of surgery, but denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep
venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, joint pains,hemoptysis,
black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

CXR admission: FINDINGS: A portable upright AP view of the chest
was obtained. There are low lung volumes resulting in vascular
crowding. There is no focal consolidation, effusion, or
pneumothorax. The heart is slightly enlarged. Osseous structures
are intact. No free air is seen below the right hemidiaphragm.

IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.

CXR [**11-25**]
ET tube in standard placement, tip no less than 4 cm from the
carina. Heart is moderately enlarged. Heterogeneous
opacification in the left lower lung could be pneumonia. Right
lung is clear. There is no pulmonary edema.  Pleural effusion on
the left is likely, small-to-moderate. None on the right.
Nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view. No
pneumothorax.

CXR [**11-30**]
Cardiomegaly is stable. There is mild vascular congestion. There
is no
pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Atelectasis in the right upper
lobe and
left lower lobe has resolved.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 99999**] was a 63 year-old man with multiple medical problems
including obesity, diastolic congestive heart failure, CRI, vWD
([**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] disease) who presented after a week of increased
fatigue and shrotness of breath.
.
# Dyspnea: Mr. [**Known lastname 99999**] was admitted to the cardiology service
for presumed decompensated congestive heart failure. Soon after
admission, he became obtunded and was found to be in hypercarbic
respiratory failure with a pCO2 of 111. He was intubated and
transfered to the CCU. There, he was diuresed with minimal
improvement in his symptoms. A chest X-ray obtained post
intubation was concerning for pneumonia and he was started on
ceftriaxone and azithromycin on hospital day 2 ([**11-26**].) Attempts
to wean him from the ventilator initially failed secondary to
hypoventilation. He was transfered to the MICU where he
recovered well and was successfully extubated. He was
subsequently transfered to the general medicine floor where he
did well though he continued to have desaturations. On the 5th
hospital day, his antibiotic regimen was expanded to include
vancomycin for the treatment of VAP and levofloxacin, which
replaced ceftiaxone and azithromycin. He was also provided a
trial of CPAP overnight to treat his suspected obstructive sleep
apnea. He reported that he tolerated the CPAP well and felt that
he experienced longer sleep intervals. In review of his medical
record on the 6th hospital day, it was determined that Mr.
[**Known lastname 99999**] had evidence of pneumonia prior to intubation and
therefore did not need continued treatment with vancomycin and
it was discontinued. In addition, the sputum culture obtained by
endotracheal sampling in the ICU revealed polymicrobial gram
stain but only rare gram negative rod growth.

  He remained afebrile on the medicine floor and was evaluated
by the physical therapy service. He was observed to desaturate
to 85% on ambulation, and it was determined that he would
benefit from home oxygen therapy. He was discharged with oxygen
therapy for home and a prescription of levofloxacin to complete
a 7 day cours
