Chief Complaint:
abnormal head CT

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 73 yo M with hx traumatic fall in [**2127**]
resulting in skull base fracture, bilateral IPH and SDH, partial
R MCA infarct, prolonged ICU stay and PEG tube at that time,
also
hx afib, CAD, HLD, HTN, and [**Hospital 8466**] transferred from [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
based on CT head findings.

He and his wife are rather vague historians.  He says he just
"didn't feel good" this morning.  He reported mild abdominal
pain
but was able to eat breakfast without difficulty.  His wife
states he has seemed unwell for the past several days to weeks
but cannot elaborate on this.

Records indicate he was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 **] [**5-21**] for
GI bleed.  He underwent colonoscopy and it was thought bleed was
possibly due to hemorrhoids.

He denies headache, visual changes, weakness, sensory changes,
bowel or bladder changes.  No dysarthria, dysphagia, speech
changes, cognitive changes, dizziness, fevers, chills, sweats,
weight changes, vomiting, or diarrhea.

He and his wife state they live alone and are independent with
ADLs.  He ambulates independently at baseline and per report has
been doing well since his accident in [**2127**].

He has been on keppra since the accident but patient denies any
seizure history.

He received decadron 10 mg x1 in the ED.

IMAGING:
CXR [**2134-5-26**]: IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process. No definite
pulmonary nodule or mass identified.

HEAD CT [**2134-5-26**]: IMPRESSION:
1. New vasogenic edema involving the right frontal lobe, with
hypodense
parenchymal lesion concerning for primary malignancy. MRI is
recommended to further evaluate.
2. Encephalomalacia in the left temporal lobe and right
temporo-occipital
lobes likely reflects chronic infarction

MR HEAD [**2134-5-27**]: IMPRESSION: New mass lesions in the right
frontal, periventricular and temporal regions with some adjacent
dural enhancement. The appearances are  suggestive of primary
brain neoplasm with appearances concerning for lymphoma or less
likely glioma. The appearance would be unusual for metastatic
disease; however, a it is [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] likely consideration. The nature
of enhancement in the right parietal area of encephalomalacia is
unclear.  Multiple chronic infarcts are identified.

CT ABD/PELVIS [**2134-5-27**]: IMPRESSION:
1. No definite evidence for primary or metastatic neoplasm.
2. Abdominal aortic aneurysm (33 mm) and iliac aneurysm, both
increased
somewhat since [**2127**]. Follow-up ultrasound surveillance is
recommended in one year.
3. Mild small bowel prominence suggestive of a mild ileus.
4. Prior coronary bypass surgery.
5. Cholelithiasis.
6. Mild esophageal wall thickening, probably inflammatory in
nature.

MR HEAD [**2134-5-30**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Redemonstration of necrotic lesions in the right frontal
lobe, right
periventricular and right temporal lobe and right-sided dural
enhancement.
2. Stable ventricular dimensions since the recent MR [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**5-27**],[**2133**]

CT HEAD [**2134-5-31**]: IMPRESSION:
Expected small amount of bleeding and pneumocephalus in the
right frontal
region related to a right-sided biopsy.

CT HEAD [**2134-6-1**]: IMPRESSION:
1. In comparison to [**2134-2-28**] exam, there is no significant
change in right frontal hemorrhage and small pneumocephalus
related to recent biopsy. No evidence of new intracranial
hemorrhage, shift of normal midline structures or hydrocephalus.

2. A 3.6 x 3 cm right frontal hypodense lesion, presumably a
malignant foc
