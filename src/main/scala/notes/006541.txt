Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Cough

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8487**]
Chief Complaint:
88 yo M w/NSCLC xferred from OSH for IP intervention for "airway
stent placement".

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy with Y stent placement on [**2108-1-21**], repeat
bronchoscopy [**2108-1-23**].

History of Present Illness:
88 yo M w/NSCLC. He presented to [**Hospital 28159**] Hospital for
work-up of weight loss (20lbs in a few months), progressive
dyspnea x2-3 mos. He had been treated w/antibiotics and MDIs
without improvement for presumed recurrent bronchitis. He was
found to have mediastinal masses on CXR and was xferred to
[**Hospital6 6689**] on [**1-15**] for further workup.

[**Hospital **] HOSPITAL: chest CT showed 2cm right upper lobe mass,
[**Hospital1 **]-hilar LAD w/major airway compression, pleural effusion.
Pleural fluid cytology revealed adenocarcinoma. No bronchoscopy
was performed secondary to concern for worsening airway and plan
for stent placement via IP at [**Hospital1 18**], with possible return for
palliative XRT.

Pt currently denies pain, denies SOB - feels that his breathing
is significantly improved since OSH.  Has a nonproductive cough.
 Reports intermittent dysphagia, with the feeling of food
getting stuck around his mid-chest. Denies [**Location (un) **], PND, orthopnea.



Past Medical History:
adenocarcinoma of lung with impending airway obstruction - in
right upper lobe with extensive mediastinal and perihilar mets
benign prostatic hypertrophy
osteoporosis
compression fractures of T12
bilateral cataract surgery
R knee replacement
hypertension
cholelithiasis seen on CT

Social History:
cigar smoking
no cigarette smoking
lives alone
Pt worked in the railroad service, then as superintendent of
public services in [**Location 45910**].  Denies any known asbestos
exposure.

Family History:

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 59454**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for stent placement by
Interventional Pulmonology. On [**2108-1-21**] he had rigid
bronchoscopy with Y stent placed in trachea/right/left mainstem.
 Patient intubated for 6 hours and extubated. 45 minutes
following extubation, patient had increased SOB, tachypnea, ABG
7.21/65/181 on non-rebreather. X-ray demonstrated element of
volume overload. Patient diuresed with 80 mg lasix, placed on
nitro (to which patient's BP dropped to 80s), placed on BIPAP
(to which he responded well). Patient transferred to MICU.
Repeat ABG was 7.35/44/70.

1. Respiratory compromise - Initially he did well on BIPAP. His
repsiratory failure was felt to be secondary to tumor
burden/obstruction and post obstructive pneumonia. His bronchial
lavage gram stain showed 4+ gram positive cocci in pairs and
clusters. He was started on vancomycin, levofloxacin and flagyl
for coverage of staphlococcus, gram negatives and anaerobes due
to aspiration pneumonia. His repeat bronchoscopy on [**2108-1-23**]
showed patent stent. On [**2108-1-23**] his respiratory status
decompensated and he was intubated. On [**2108-1-24**], he became
hypotensive and was started on zosyn for broad spectrum coverage
including pseudomonas. He remained hypotensive, requiring
neosynephrine and IVF boluses and acidotic on [**2108-1-24**]. A family
meeting with two of his sons was had that evening. Given his
poor prognosis, he was made CMO. He was extubated and started on
a fentanyl drip. He was comfortable and expired at 11:25 PM on
[**2108-1-24**].

2. Cardiac: On [**2108-1-23**], he developed hypotension and
tachycardia (MAT and atrial flutter). He was given fluid boluses
to try to slow his rate as his BP was low and could not tolerate
beta blockade.
