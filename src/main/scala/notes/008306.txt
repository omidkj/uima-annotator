Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1148**]
Chief Complaint:
dry cough, congestion and generalizaed malaise, plus increased
jaundice from his baseline status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD/EUS
PICC line placement

History of Present Illness:
HPI from [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]: 49M vasculopath w/ chronic mesenteric ischemia
s/p multiple abdominal surgeries including near total
enterectomy, severe malnutrition, TPN dependent (does own TPN at
home), and h/o multiple fungemia episodes who orginally
presented to [**Location (un) **] ED on [**1-18**] with dry cough, congestion and
generalizaed malaise, plus increased jaundice from his baseline
status. Upon presentation to the ED, the pt had a temp of 100.0
and was found to be in afib per report. Of note, the patient
recently stopped his chronic iv caspo tx for chronic fungemia on
[**2162-1-11**] since he was doing well (ID at [**Hospital1 18**] dc'd caspo). His
TEE at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2162-1-5**] showed no vegetations.
.
ON admisisons to [**Location (un) **], the patient denied any CP, HA, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea. +fevera nd chills at home, + dry cought, no
hemoptysis or hematemeisis. No nightsweats. Denies gaining or
losing [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 691**] [**Last Name (un) 14836**]. He was found to have bilateral pleural
effusions and admitted to general medicine service. There was a
q of infiltrate on cxr, unasyn was started [**2162-1-19**]. Hct found to
hve 24.5, xfused 2 u PRBCs. Blood cx sent, [**5-5**] grew yeast,
speciation pending. Repeat Cx drawn [**1-23**], [**1-30**] yeast. ID
consultation was obtained, and the patient was started on IV
caspo [**1-20**] and IV fluc [**1-26**], given his previous infections with
cadindia (sensitive to Cipro). R sided [**Female First Name (un) 576**] was done [**1-23**] and
[**1-26**] with 1L transudative fluid out both times. L pleural
effusion persisted. CT scan was done noting paraesophageal mass,
false lumen was suspected. Barium swallow was done, negative for
false lumen. Request was made to xfer pt to [**Hospital1 18**] for tissue dx
of this mass. Patient was maintained on present dose of TPN. It
is not clear from records, but on [**1-26**], pt spiked to 103.5, with
BP 81/48. He was given fluids, IV abx, xferred to [**Location (un) **] ICU.
Abx were continued and xfer to [**Hospital1 18**] ICU vs [**Hospital1 18**] floor was
requested. He was given 3L of IVF at [**Location (un) **] ICU with
improvement of SBP to 100s. He was transiently on levophed, but
unclear duration. His PICC was changed on [**2162-1-26**]. Through all
of this, the patient decided to be DNR/DNI. Of note, pt still
has multiple abdominal vascular grafts present.

[**Hospital Unit Name 13533**]: Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was stable,
though septic. No resp distress, pt's own home TPN running (he
was never changed over to [**Location (un) **] TPN) at ~230cc's/hr. On [**1-27**]:
Contact[**Name (NI) **] ID, thoracics, vascular [**Doctor First Name **]. [**1-28**]: TTE showed no
vegetation. ID consulted, rec ophtho & liver c/s and TEE. [**1-29**]:
CT chest with ?paraesphageal abscess and large bilat pleural
effusions. Guaiac +ve ostomy output. [**1-30**]: TPN via PICC.
Thoracics-no surgical intervention (too morbid). Liver rec
ursodiol 300 TID. ID rec change cefepime to meropenem for better
anaerobe coverage. [**1-31**]: Began to have some bleeding in ostomy
output. Hct dropped 27 to 21. Transfused 2 units PRBC. FFP
ordered for morning to reverse coagulopathy in advance of
EGD/EUS. [**2-1**]: EGD/EUS: Blood in stomach, no active bleeding site
identified. Thick stomach mucosa with cystic appearence, 2 cc of
fluid removed from para-esophogeal cystic mass and sent to
micro. Patient desatted post-procedure, responded well to
non-rebreather.
[**2-2**]: Weaning O2. D/c'd TEE due to positive culture from EUS
biopsy. Transfused 1 U PRBC for volume. Given LR for
hypotension. [**2-3**]: More blood in ostomy drainage. Hct stable.
Thoracics consulted for ? drainage of fungal abscess. [**2-4**]:
Cultures from para-esophageal cystic mass growing yeast, MRSA,
and Enterococcus. SSRI started.
[**2-5**]: PICC line D/C'd. Meropenem D/C'd.

Conclusions:
No thrombus/mass is seen in the body of the left atrium. No mass
or thrombus is seen in the right atrium or right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen.
No vegetations seen on any cardiac valve.
