History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 17315**] is a 56 y/o F with a h/o morbid obesity, metabolic
syndrome and restrictive lung disease who initially p/w weakness
and dehydration.  On admission she was found to be hypoxic by
EMS to 78% on RA.  She was also found to have LE cellulitis, a
UTI, [**Last Name (un) **] and an elevated BNP and troponin.  She was admitted to
the medical floor, where she was started on ceftriaxone for her
UTI and vancomycin for her cellulitis.  An echo was done for
further evaluation of her hypoxia, which showed a dilated right
ventricle and right ventricular volume overload.  Given her echo
findings, elevated BNP/troponin the floor team was concerned
that she may have a PE so she was empirically started on a
heparin gtt as she was unable to get a CTA because of her [**Last Name (un) **]
and radiology felt a V/Q scan would not be useful in the setting
of her poor baseline CXR.
.
She initially was stable but with worsening renal function, when
on the day of transfer she was found to be somnolent, confused
and with an oxygen saturation of 87% on 4LNC.  She was placed on
6LNC with improvement in her oxygen satuartion improved to 92%
but she remained tachypneic.  ABG done at that time was
7.22/59/70, she was placed on her nighttime bipap for her
respiratory distress.  A CXR was done that was unchanged from
prior, she was also noted to be febrile to 102.5 at that time.
Given her need for bipap, a transfer to the ICU was initiated.
VS on arrival to the ICU were: 100.4, 80, 105/43, 20, 99% on
bipap with 6L.  Shortly after her arrival to the ICU she
desaturated to the low 80's, at that time we transferred her to
NIPPV with settings of [**10-19**] and an FiO2 of 100%, her oxygen
saturations improved quickly on the new bipap settings.
.
