Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endoscopy, colonoscopy, right and left cardiac catheterization
with bare metal stent placement


History of Present Illness:
This is a 63 year old gentleman with CAD s/p CABG (SVG-D,
SVG-RCA and LIMA-LAD SVG-RCA which was occluded on [**12/2107**]
catheterization), diastolic CHF, atrial fibrillation/flutter,
type II diabetes presented to an OSH with worsening dyspnea over
one day. Of note patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with an
acute MI in [**2107-12-9**], at that time PCI was performed with
SVG to the diag was performed. The patient was to return for PCI
on the native OM.
Also of note, the pt's post-cath course  on prior admission was
complicated by large groin hematoma; he required 3 units pRBC
and repair by vascular surgery. Pt also noted to have one guaiac
positive stool.
.
Since that time the patient has developed worsening shortness of
breath over several weeks associated with non-productive cough.
He denies any chest pain, or fever. Over the last few days he
has been using his wife's oxygen with some relief. He could only
move a few feet before becoming short of breath.
.
On admission to OSH on [**1-31**], he found to have +2 pedal edema, O2
sats 85-90% on RA. No mention is made of other vital signs. The
patient was briefly on Bipap, transitioned to 4L NC maintaining
sats between 97-100%. He was diagnosed with CHF exacerbation. He
was treated with lasix 60 IV and nebulizers. His respiratory
status improved. The patient had a leukocytosis to 20,000 but
this was not commented on in the notes. There was some concern
for abscess and mention is made of obtaining MRI, per the
patient this was not done because of his heart monitor. In
general the course at the OSH is poorly documented, with no
discharge summary and confusing, at times, illegible notes.
.
The patient reported currently feeling somewhat better. He
denies any chest pain and feels his breathing is improved.
.
ROS: Chronic back pain since [**Month (only) 359**]. No nausea/vomiting, but he
did have some diarrhea this morning. No abdominal pain except
with coughing. No dizziness, weakness, imbalance, loss of
continence. A total of 10 of 14 systems were reviewed and, other
than those mentioned, were negative.

.
EKG: Atrial fibrillation, rate 65, low voltage
.
CXR: OSH (image unavailable) no pulmonary edema, "R lower lobe
opacity"
[**Hospital1 **] (my read) mild pulm congestion, R costophrenic angle missing,
no focal infiltrates seen, no effusions.
.
[**2107-2-1**] echocardiogram
1.The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrium is
elongated.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic
(EF>75%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic function is normal.
4.The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
5.The aortic valve is not well seen. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral
regurgitation is seen.
7.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
8.There is no pericardial effusion.

Bleeding Study [**2108-2-7**]:
Following intravenous injection of autologous red blood cells
labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic images of the
abdomen for 120
minutes were obtained.  A left lateral view of the pelvis was
also obtained.
Blood flow images show no sites of abnormal radiotracer uptake.

Dynamic blood pool images show no active gastrointestinal
bleeding.
IMPRESSION:  No active gastrointestinal bleeding after 2 hours.

Bleeding Study [**2108-2-8**]:
Following intravenous injection of autologous red blood cells
labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic images of the
abdomen from 0-79 minutes and from 150-180 minutes were
obtained.  A left lateral view of the pelvis was also obtained.

Blood flow images show a normal pattern of tracer distribution.

Dynamic blood pool images show somewhat heterogeneous blood pool
throughout the abdomen, most prominent in the left lower
quadrant.  The activity does change in distribution throughout
the examination but does not appear to collect.  The changing
pattern could reflect physiologic bowel movement.
IMPRESSION: No definite evidence of GI bleeding.

[**2108-2-6**] Upper Endoscopy:
Findings:
Esophagus: Normal esophagus.
Stomach:   Mucosa: Erythema of the mucosa with no bleeding was
noted in the stomach body and antrum. These findings are
compatible with gastritis.
Duodenum:  Protruding Lesions A single small non-bleeding polyp
was found in the second part of the duodenum.
Impression: Erythema in the stomach body and antrum compatible
with gastritis Polyp in the second part of the duodenum
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum

[**2108-2-10**]: Colonoscopy:
Findings:
Contents: Red blood, with some clots was seen in the whole
colon.
Flat Lesions Many angioectasias that were not bleeding were seen
in the cecum. Mono-Polar Cautery Unit was applied for
hemostasis. The AVMs did not bleed on cauterization.
Protruding Lesions Four sessile 3-4mm polyps of benign
appearance were seen. 2 in the cecum and 2 distally (descending
and sigmoid colon). They were not removed at this time.
Excavated Lesions Multiple diverticula were seen in the whole
colon. No active bleeding was seen in the diverticuli.
Other Few small ulcerations were seen in the ileum. They were
not bleeding. There was no blood in the ileum.
Impression:
Blood in the whole colon
Diverticulosis of the whole colon
Angioectasias in the cecum (thermal therapy)
Polyps in the cecum
Few small ulcerations were seen in the ileum. They were not
bleeding. There was no blood in the ileum.
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum and terminal ileum


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 63 year old gentleman with CAD s/p CABG, CHF
(diastolic) and atrial flutter/fibrillation who presented to an
outside hospital for dyspnea and found to be hypoxic on room
air.  He was diagnosed with CHF exacerbation and this improved
after diuresis.  He was transferred here for CHF management and
for repeat catheterization.  On transfer his oxygen status
appeared improved after diuresis and patient seemed more
comfortable.  He did have some jugular vein distention,
scattered rales and LE edema.  He was therefore diuresed on HD1.
 Further diuresis was stopped as his creatinine trended upward
the following day.
.
Of more importance was that his troponin was noted to trend
upward and he ruled in for MI.  Hepa
