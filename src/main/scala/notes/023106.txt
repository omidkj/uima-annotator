Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o woman who presented with acute onset CP and STE on EKG on
admission. Pt refused a cath at that time, and STEMI was managed
medically as per patient's care goals.

CAD/Ischemia: On admission pt had chest pain accompanied by an
EKG with ST elevations in I, AVL, V1, and V2, as well as ST
depression in II, III< aVF, aVR, and V3-6. First set of CE's was
negative. Code STEMI was called but pt refused cath. Medical
management with heparin gtt which was initiated as aligned with
patient care goals. Several days into admission, pt experienced
another episode of CP with possible ST elevation in V1-2, and
pain and STE on EKG both resolved following SL Nitro x 3. Pt was
placed on a Nitro and Heparin drip, and was eventually weaned to
long-acting Nitro 30mg daily. Medical management was continued
with ASA 325mg daily, Plavix 75mg daily, Metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **],
Atorvastatin 80mg daily, and Losartan 25mg daily.

Pump: Pt had an ECHO in [**2109**] which showed an EF of >55%. Repeat
ECHO on [**7-13**] demonstrated an EF=50%, mild LVH, mild basal to mid
septal and anterior hypokinesis. The remaining segments were
hyperdynamic, 2+MR & 2+TR was noted. During hospitalization, pt
was noted to have a high BNP with crackles in lungs bilaterally,
and was treated with diuresis.  Pt was sating on RA on
discharge.

Rhythm: Pt had some AIVR vs. NSVT on tele early in admission,
and was monitored daily on telemetry. Rhythm was stable on
discharge.

HTN: Pt was controlled on Metoprolol and Losartan.

UTI: During admission, pt was found to have a U/A positive for
WBC and leukocytes. Cipro 500mg PO x 3days was initiated.  Pt
had one more day of Cipro to take at discharge. Urine cx has
since come back with skin and genital flora thought to be
contaminant.

Questionable C.Diff: Pt reported several loose stools. C.Diff
stool toxins were sent and have been negative x2. Flagyl 500mg
tid was started empirically ([**8-15**].) and pt will continue the
empiric treatment after discharge as only 2 samples were
obtained.

Hematocrit drop: Pt had a drop in hematocrit to 29.5 during
admission. Etiology has not been elucidated, though pt has a
distant hx of GI bleed.  Stool had been found guiaic positive
x1. Repeat crit was normal at 33. Protonix was started
prophylactically, and pt will be discharged on Prilosec OTC.
