History of Present Illness:
This is a 58M with known CAD, and severe AS ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.8, gradient
25), who presents with shortness of breath from Dr.[**Name (NI) 5452**]
office. He had an NSTEMI last week while on vacation in Buffalo
and underwent cardiac cath which by report revealed only his
known totally occluded LCX. There were no interventions at that
time. He presented to his cardiologist earlier on the day of
admission for a stress echo. He exercised < 2 minutes and
developed acute respiratory distress. Bedside echo in the office
revealed LVEF 30%, 3+AI, AS (peak gradient 58 mmHg, AVarea
~1cm2). Brought to [**Hospital1 18**] via EMS. Initial vital signs in ED were
bp 210/110 with a HR 130. He was placed on NTG gtt. BiPaP was
started. Diuresed ~500cc to lasix 20 mg IV.  Subsequently
admitted to the CCU.

[**2192-11-6**]: Cardiac Catheterization: Circumflex with 100% proximal
occlusion. LV gram showed EF 30% with severe aortic
regurgitation and mild mitral regurgitation. Elevated PCPW.
Severe aortic stenosis.
[**2192-11-7**] Chest CT Scan: 1. Small residual of previous loculated
right pleural effusion, presumably empyema, at the base of the
right lung surrounded by very thickened pleura responsible for
persistent atelectasis. Post-pneumonia bronchiectasis and
scarring right lower lobe. No evidence of active pneumonia. 2.
Moderate-to- severe emphysema, predominantly upper lobe. 3.
Small right fissural and dependent left pleural effusions and
interstitial and ground-glass opacities in the left lung, all
likely due to recent cardiac decompensation. 4. Calcific aortic
stenosis and left ventricular dilatation and hypertrophy.
[**2192-11-7**] Carotid Ultrasound: Calcific bilateral ICA plaque,
however, no appreciable associated ICA stenosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the CCU where he remained pain free on
medical therapy. He ruled out for myocardial infarction by
enzymes. He underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed
severe aortic insufficiency and stenosis. Left ventriculogram
showed an LVEF of 30% with only mild mitral regurgitation.
Coronary angiogram was notable for a proximal occlusion of the
circumflex. Cardiac surgery was subsequently consulted and
further evaluation was performed. He was cleared by the dental
service and clinical and radiographic exam revealed no evidence
of infection. A carotid ultrasound found no appreciable internal
carotid artery stenosis. Given his history of empyema, the
thoracic service was consulted and chest CT scan was obtained.
Based on the findings(see result section) and lack of symptoms,
there was no contraindication to proceed with surgery. His
preoperative course was otherwise unremarkable and he was
cleared for surgery.

On [**11-8**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed a mechanical aortic
valve replacement and single vessel coronary artery bypass
graft. For additional surgical detail, please see separate
dictated operative note. Following the operation, he was brought
to the CSRU for invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated without incident. He
maintained stable hemodynamics and weaned from pressors without
difficulty. Amiodarone was initiated for some ventricular
ectopy. On postoperative day two, he transferred to the SDU for
further care and recovery. Warfarin was started for his
mechanical valve and dosed for a goal INR around 2.5. He
temporarily required a Heparin drip for a subtherapeutic
prothrombin time. Antibiotics were initiated for upper arm
phlebitis. Over several days, he continued to make clinical
improvements with diuresis. An ace inhibitor was resumed for
blood pressure management. Mr. [**Known lastname **] worked with the physical
therapy service daily, He continued to make steady progress and
was discharged home on [**2192-11-16**]. He will follow-up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], his cardiologist and his primary care physician as an
outpatient. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 6930**] will manage his Coumadin dosing for a
goal INR of 2.5. His first blood draw will be [**2192-11-20**].
