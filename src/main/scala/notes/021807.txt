Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3561**]
Chief Complaint:
Tongue Swelling

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
24 y.o. female with history of idiopathic urticaria and
angioedema with multiple hospitalizations for tongue swelling
who presented to the ED this morning with tongue swelling.
Patient reportedly woke up from sleep short of breath at which
time she noticed her tongue swelling. It is unclear if there was
any direct precipitant. EMS was notified and she was given
Epinephrine in the field x 1 with no effect. Once in the ER, she
was noted to have severe left-sided tongue swelling and received
an additional dose of Epinephrine as well as Famotidine,
Benadryl and Solu-medrol with no improvement in symptoms after
10 minutes. She was then electively intubated to protect her
airway and admitted to the MICU for further management.
.
With regards to the patient's tongue swelling, she began
experiencing symptoms of frequent hives and tongue swelling
after a cesarian section in [**Month (only) **] of this year. She has no clear
triggers though the patient's father has noticed that the
episodes seem to coincide with periods of high emotional stress.
She has been followed in allergy/immunology and is felt to have
idiopathic urticaria and angioedema and uses an Epinephrine pen,
approximately once every week for these symptoms. She
additionally has been on Prednisone tapers subsequent to her
multiple hospitalizations, which of note have not resulted in an
intubation until now. Other pertinent work-up for this condition
includes an investigation into atopy and the patient has no
history of frequent infections, immune disorders, eczema,
contact allergies, reactions to foods, meds, latex, insect
stings. She has an identical twin sister who has not had any
such reactions nor has anyone in her immediate family. C4 levels
checked in the past have been WNL, with respect to a work-up for
C1 esterase deficiency.

Past Medical History:
1. Chronic urticaria and angioedemea since C-section done on
[**6-4**] for failure to progress after 30 hour labor
2. Asthma
3. Seasonal allergies
4. Status post cholecystectomy ([**4-30**])

Social History:
Lives with father and siblings and has a 5 month old son.
[**Name (NI) 6961**] are separated and there appears to be some tension
between mother and children as mother has a psychiatric illness.
Per father he and patient have also recently had a tumultuous
relationship and are currently not on speaking terms. Reportedly
infrequent alcohol or tobacco use and no IV drugs.


Family History:
Father with seasonal allergies. Otherwise, no history of related
urticaria, angioedema.
