Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 31**] is an 81 year old F with a history of HOCM s/p
ETOH ablation and ICD placement [**2099**], Atrial fibrillation (on
Dronedarone), Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia who presented to ED
with shortness of breath.
.
The patient states that on the day prior to admission, patient
had what she thought to be an upper respiratory tract infection.
On the AM of [**12-29**], she woke up with significant shortness of
breath that was present at rest and with exertion that prompted
her to call EMS. She was found to be significantly shortness of
breath and was given Lasix 60mg IV x 1.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T100.0, 124/67, 88, 24-26, 96%
2LNC. Patient was saturating comfortably on 2L NC after diuresis
(unclear exactly how much) and was given Levaquin for cover for
possible CAP. She became acutely SOB in the ED (for unclear
reasons) and was given another bolus of Lasix 20mg IV x 1. She
was admitted to the [**Hospital1 1516**] Cardiology Service.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient's shortness of breath improved.
Shortly after transfer, the patient had a 20 beat run of
polymorphic VT that resolved on its own. She then developed
another run of polymorphic VT lasting approximately 30 seconds
at a rate of 220 BPM. ICD fired and coverted her rhythm to a WCT
in 130s (approx 1 min) which appeared to be monomorphic VT on
tele given episodes of AV dissociation. This rhythm then
spontaneously resolved. She was transferred to CCU and given 4g
IV Magnesium.
.
On tranfer, patient is HD stable. Patient states that feels her
SOB is improved.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. All of
the other review of systems were negative unless included above
in HPI.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope (in past several years). Reports dyspnea on
exertion and orthopnea this AM.

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2104-12-29**]: Retrocardiac linear density which may represent an
early
pneumonia vs. atelectasis.

CXR [**2105-1-1**]: Right-sided pacer/AICD with its leads overlying
the right atrium and right ventricle is unchanged. Mild
cardiomegaly is
similar to three days prior. The lungs are clear without
effusion,
consolidation or pneumothorax. Streaky retrocardiac opacity is
similar to
three days prior and likely represents atelectasis.

ECHO [**2104-12-30**]: The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is moderate
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no
ventricular septal defect. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve is not
well seen. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent
with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
81 year old F withHOCM s/p EtOH ablation, AF on dofetilide, s/p
BiV ICD, presenting with acute onset SOB and episode of
polymorphic VT requiring ICD shock.
.
# PUMP/SOB: Patient admitted for acute on chronic diastolic
heart failure. TTE on [**12-30**] showed diastolic dysfunction and EF
70-80%. Clinical exam & CXR demonstrated evidence of fluid
overload. Etiology for the patient's pulmonary edema was unclear
as she demonstrated no evidence of ischemia and denied any
dietary indiscretion. Patient was given IV Lasix with good
initial UOP, but in the context of continuing her home Valsartan
and adding Spironolactone, she had some transient hypotension
and ARF. She was then fluid repleted and became euvolemic on
final exam & per CXR and she was discharged to home on a
decreased dose of Valsartan.

# RHYTHM: Patient with PAF and an A sense V paced rhythm, with
QTc prolongation to approximately 500.  Patient's episode of
polymorphic VT was likely secondary to medications (Dofetilide
and Levaquin in ED) versus hypokalemia. Her K was repleted and
her Dofetilide & Levaquin were held. She was instead continued
on her home Metoprolol and started on Flecainide on [**1-1**]. Her
ICD was interrogated and revealed appropriate function and it
was reprogrammed on [**12-30**] to increase the rate from 70 to 80, and
initial detection for VF was reprogrammed from 30/40 beats to
18
