History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 2520**] is an 85 year old gentleman discharged from the CCU
service yesterday, returning with 2 episodes of painless
hematochezia, approximately 500mL while defecating at his
nursing home.  He was found to have continued bleeding/BRBPR and
sent over to [**Hospital3 7571**]hospital.  He was transfused 1 unit
of blood and 1.5 L with IVs placed and transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**]
ED.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 88 86/54. Patient was given another
2 units of blood, 1.5L of NS to achieve hemodynamic stability.
Surgery and GI were consulted, 40 of Protonix was started.  NG
tube placed coffee ground on initial suction with 2 lavages
negative thereafter.  Difficult with sat monitoring, but high
90s on NRB.  Given 40 Protonix x2. R Triple lumen placed.
Transfer VS: 96/63 (previous BPs: 123/103 103/66 96/64) 96 95%
NRB in AFIB with RBBB which appears to be a new rhythm.
.
On the floor, the patient is awake and confirms the story above,
although he intermittently falls asleep.  He denies ever having
abdominal pain, chest pain or difficulty breathing.
.
Of note, the patient was discharged from the CCU service
yesterday after an admission for CHF and diuresis.  Discharge
summary reviewed.

Pertinent Results:
CT Abd and Pelvis [**2129-8-23**]
1. Status post aortobiiliac endostent placement with left common
iliac artery aneurysm repair. No definite evidence of endoleak
or aortoenteric fistula on this study.
2. No evidence of focal extravasation of contrast to suggest GI
bleed. If
clinical suspicion persists then nuclear medicine study can be
performed to determine site of bleed.
3. Large bilateral pleural effusions, ascites, and anasarca are
slightly
increased compared to [**2129-8-20**].
4. Hepatic cyst within the left lobe of the liver is stable
since [**2125**].
Bilateral renal cortical scarring is unchanged since most recent
prior.
5. Sclerotic foci of bilateral femoral heads may represent
avascular necrosis and are unchanged since the most recent
priors.

EGD [**2129-8-23**]
Erythema in the stomach compatible with gastritis
Erosions in the antrum
Erythema and friability and erosions in the duodenal bulb
compatible with duodenitis
Blood noted in proximal jejunum without active source of
bleeding noted.
Otherwise normal EGD to proximal jejunum

GI Bleeding Study [**2129-8-24**]
Dynamic blood pool images show extravascular activity noted in
the left lower quadrant throughout the initial thirty minutes
suggestive of brisk bleeding likely in the sigmoid colon.

Bleeding was first noticed within the first minute of dynamic
imaging.

[**2129-8-19**] 10:58PM   HCT-35.3*
[**2129-8-19**] 06:08PM   HCT-30.5*#
[**2129-8-18**] 04:25AM   PT-14.8* PTT-33.1 INR(PT)-1.3*

Brief Hospital Course:
1) Shock/Hypotension/GI bleed: Was secondary to GI bleed and
likely cardiogenic shock with diastolic failure and severe MR,
other possible contributing sources were adrenal insufficiency
given chronic prednisone use and sepsis from urinary source.
The patient remained hypotensive despite 5 units of blood and 6L
of NS at initial presentation.  IV access was maintained,
transfusions of PRBC were given for Hct <25, FFP>1.5.
Vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl were started for presumed
urosepsis, and were continued during MICU stay.  Trauma line was
placed for faster fluid and blood repletion and hydrocortisone
was given.
Pt was followed by GI, vascular and surgery services.  CTA did
not show active bleed or leak from endovascular graft.
Levophed and vasopressin were started to maintain MAP>65.
Patient was intubated on[**8-21**] for concern of inability to protect
airway and hcts and fluid status were stable until [**8-25**], when
there was evidence of a brisk GI bleed which was seen on tagged
RBC scan and embolized by IR, thought to be [**3-1**] diverticulosis,
and again on [**8-26**], for which 2 units of blood and one of FFP
were given.  Pressors were titrated and fluid boluses were given
to maintain MAP, until the neighbors decided to initiate comfort
measures only on the afternoon of [**8-26**], after which all
interventions were discontinued except morphine drip and ativan.
 Mr. [**Known lastname 2520**] died at 21:50 on [**8-26**].
.
2) Acute on chronic renal failure: Initial creatinine actual
represents an improvement from recent renal failure [**3-1**] heart
failure, but worsened after studies with contrast, the CTA and
IR, were done.  Fluid boluses were given and Cr was trended
until CMO was initiated on [**8-26**].
.
4) Diastolic CHF/CAD: No evidence of new ischemia on EKG and
cardiac enzymes were stable.  anticoagulation with Asa and
heparin were held
.
5) Atrial fibrillation, borderline rapid rate: Rate control with
fluids/blood as above, no anticoagulation was given.
