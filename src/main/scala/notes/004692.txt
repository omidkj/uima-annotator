Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3043**]
Chief Complaint:
transferred for management of SDH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **]F h/o CVA with LLE residual weakness, [**Hospital **]
transferred from [**Hospital6 10353**] following a fall for
definitive management of subdural hemorrhage. Awoke on the floor
this AM at 1:00 am after going to sleep in bed. She is unaware
of how she ended up on the floor, does not remember falling or
any trauma, nor did anyone witness the event. She denied any
pain upon waking. Of note she was recently started on ambien
about 1 week ago. She was taken to an OSH where a head CT showed
a possible small acute subdural hematoma in the left tentorium.
She does report having a right CVA in the past with some
residual LLE weakness.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 97.6 54 162/84 17 96%. Head CT
preliminarily showed a linear hyperdensity at the left
tentorium, concerning for small area of subdural hemorrhage (not
significantly changed from OSH CT). Evaluated by neurosurgery
who felt no surgical intervention indicated based on size of SDH
and normal exam. Treated with nipride gtt given low HR but BP
dropped 170s->110s. D/C'd and BP slowly back to 180-190s.
Started on nitroglycerin gtt, SBP remained in 180's-190's and
now at 160's. Given carvedilol 3.125 mg and lisinopril 5 mg.
Vitals prior to transfer HR:52 RR:10 O2Sat: 97% 2l BP: 160/66.

.
In the ICU, patient has no complaints. Denies headache. Has
light sensitivity which is her baseline reportedly related due
to macular degeneration.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denied cough, shortness of breath. Denied chest pain

Imaging:
OSH CT Neck:
No fx or subluxation

[**2144-8-29**]
CT head: IMPRESSION:
1. Linear density at the left tentorium concerning for subdural
hemorrhage.
2. Area of encephalomalacia at the right parietal lobe, likely
from old
stroke.

[**2144-8-29**]
CXR: There is a left pleural effusion identified. No definite
infiltrate is seen on this single frontal view. The lateral view
when feasible could be helpful. The pulmonary vascular markings,
cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.
IMPRESSION: Left effusion.

[**2144-8-30**]
CT head: No change (prelim)

EKG: sinus at 50. u waves v5 and v6.
.
[**2144-8-31**] CXR:
IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**8-29**]:
Minimal left pleural effusion has decreased. Lungs are clear.
Mild
cardiomegaly, and mild pulmonary vascular redistribution suggest
borderline
cardiac function but there is no pulmonary edema. Lungs are
clear.

[**2144-9-1**] Echo:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.



Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female who sustained
a SDH in the setting of fall and was hypertensive to the
180's-190's on admission requiring nitro gtt and MICU admission.


# Fall/Subdural hematoma:  A subdural hematoma was found on CT
at [**Hospital6 **] and the patient was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further management.  Repeat CT showed linear density at the
left tentorium concerning for subdural hemorrhage and an area of
encephalomalacia at the right parietal lobe, likely from old
stroke. Neurosurgery evaluated the patient in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED and
did not feel surgical intervention was necessary at that time as
she was not having any neurological symptoms.  Her ASPIRIN WAS
HELD and should continue to be held for one week (may restart
[**9-5**]).  Neurosurgery recommended that her blood pressure be
maintained below 160 systolic.  Her home antihypertensive
regimen was continued but her lisinopril was increased to 20 mg
Q day. A repeat head CT showed no change. Neurosurgery does not
need to follow up with patient.  A cardiac echo was performed to
rule out valvular causes for the patient falling on the floor
and did not show evidence of valvular or cardiac disease.
Physical therapy walked with the patient and thought that she
would benefit from continued physical therapy at her [**Hospital 4382**] facility.

# Hypertension: Per neurosurgery the patient's goal blood
presure was to be kept under 160s.  In the ED she was
hypertensive to the 180s and required a nitro gtt.  She was
transfered to the MICU and weaned off the nitro gtt.  Her home
LISINOPRIL WAS TITRATED UP to 20 mg Q day, but her coreg was
maintained at her home dose because of her bradycardia to the
50s.  She received hydralazine PRN and her BP stabilized under
160.  She was trasferred out to the floor where she initially
required hydralazine PRN x 2.  Her BP eventually stabilized with
the increased dose of lisinopril.

# chest pain: The patient experienced 5/10 chest pain overnight
when she trasfered from the ICU.  She noted having anxiety
related to her family at the time.  There were no EKG changes
and cardiac enzymes were negative.  The pain was releived with
morphine and maalox.  The patient was started on tele and had no
events.  She had an echo during her hospitalization to rule out
valvular disease as a cause for her falling on the floor, which
was essentially normal.

# Leukocytosis: The patient was noted to have a leukocytosis
with a leftward shift, 2% bands. Unclear infectious source at
this time and the patient denied symptoms of dysuria, shortness
of breath, or diarrhea.  All cultures (blood, urine) were
negative so no antibiotics were given.  The day of discharge a
UA showed positive LE and bacteria.  Cultures were pending and
the patient did not complain of dysuria so
