Service:  MED


CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Respiratory distress.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61 year old
female with a history of small cell lung cancer diagnosed in
[**2188**], status post chemotherapy, radiation therapy including
prophylactic whole brain irradiation and stem cell rescue,
also with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
on home oxygen and recurrent right sided pleural effusion who
presented to the clinic on the day of admission with
increasing shortness of breath.  The patient was sent to the
emergency department from the clinic where she was found to
be saturating in the 90s on 100 percent nonrebreathing.  A
right sided thoracentesis was done with removal of 600 cc of
serous fluid which initially improved the patient's oxygen
saturation.  However, the patient subsequently desaturated
again on the nonrebreather requiring intubation.  The
patient's daughter reported that she has had increased
agitation and somnolence as well as green/[**Doctor Last Name 352**] sputum over
the past seven days.  She had been started on levofloxacin
without significant improvement in the sputum production.  On
the day prior to admission she developed increased somnolence
and lethargy prompting her visit to clinic.  She received
ceftriaxone and azithromycin.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Small cell lung cancer diagnosed in
[**2188**], status post radiation, chemotherapy, stem cell rescue,
prophylactic brain radiation.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Hypothyroidism.

Atypical pneumonia.

Recurrent right pleural effusion.

Mental status changes.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has been married for 38 years.
Her daughter is a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Hospital1 188**].  She is a former smoker and quit 70 pack years.  She
quit in [**2188**].  She denies any alcohol or drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Is significant for mother diabetes and
father with hypertension.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Synthroid 100 mcg q.d., Celebrex,
Serevent, Atrovent, albuterol, home oxygen, levofloxacin 500
mg q.d.  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission temperature 98, blood
pressure 127/63, heart rate 126, respiratory rate 22,
saturating 90 percent on 100 percent non-rebreather.  In
general this is an ill appearing woman in respiratory
distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination:
Mucous membranes slightly dry, extraocular movements intact.
Jugular venous distension was 6 cm.  Cardiac examination:
Tachycardic with a regular rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  Lung examination:  Coarse breath sounds throughout
with decreased breath sounds on the right.  Abdomen was soft,
nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities revealed 1+ lower extremity edema bilaterally.
Neurologically alert and responsive.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission:  CBC revealed a white count
of 15.6 with 81 percent neutrophils, hematocrit was 39.1,
platelet count 321.  Chem-7 revealed a sodium of 137 with
potassium of 5.9, chloride of 93, bicarbonate of 38, BUN of
18, creatinine of 0.4 and glucose of 106.  Pleural fluid
showed 1335 white blood cells and [**Pager number 6326**] red blood cells.
Total protein was 4.1, glucose was 111 and albumin was 1.1.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 132 with normal
axis and normal [**Doctor Last Name 1754**].  There were no ST or T wave
changes.  There were Q waves in 3 and AVF.  Chest x-ray
showed a large right pleural effusion with right lower lobe
collapse.  Her endotracheal tube was in place.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:
1. Respiratory failure:  Patient was intubated in the
   emergency department.  Her respiratory failure was felt to
   be multifactorial with the pleural effusion and sizable
   lobar collapse playing a large role.  She was also treated
   for possible pneumonia and had bronchoscopy with BAL done
   on both [**5-10**] and [**5-11**].  BAL grew pansensitive pseudomonas
   and she was treated for this initially with ceftriaxone
   and azithromycin and then subsequently with ceftazidime to
   complete a 14 day course.  Given her underlying lung
   disease including bronchiectasis and severe chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease, it was felt that she would
   likely have a long wean off the ventilator.  She therefore
   underwent tracheostomy on [**5-15**].  She was initially
   maintained on pressure controlled ventilation and was
   eventually able to be weaned from pressure support mode.
   She is currently tolerating 10 of pressure support with 5
   of PEEP and an FIO2 of 0.4.  On those settings she is
   pulling tidal volumes in the 300s and saturating 96 to 98
   percent.  We did consider chest tube placement to treat
   her effusion.  However, the patient was oxygenating and
   ventilating well and this was therefore deferred.

1. Pneumonia:  As stated above patient was felt to likely
   have an underlying pneumonia as the source of her acute
   decompensation.  She was treated with ceftazidine for
   pseudomonas pneumonia and will complete a 14 day course.
   She also received chest physical therapy and suctioning
   p.r.n.

1. Small cell lung cancer:  Cytology from both her BAL and
   from her pleural fluid were negative for malignant cells.
   At this time there is no evidence of disease recurrence.

1. Hypothyroidism:  The patient was continued on her home
   dose of Synthroid.  Given her persistent tachycardia a TSH
   and free T4 were checked and are pending at the time of
   this dictation.

1. Tachycardia:  The patient was persistently tachycardic
   throughout her admission.  This was initially felt to be
   secondary to volume depletion.  However, this did not
   resolve with intravenous fluids.  She underwent an
   echocardiogram which showed depressed left ventricular
   ejection fraction and was started on an ACE inhibitor for
   afterload reduction.  As mentioned above thyroid function
   tests were also checked given her history of
   hypothyroidism and are currently pending.

1. Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient had a
   Dobhoff tube placed and has been on tube feeds since
   admission.  A speech and swallow evaluation is pending.

1. Metabolic alkalosis:  This is felt to be compensatory for
   the patient's primary respiratory acidosis from her
   chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  A urine chloride
   was checked and was 112 suggesting that her metabolic
   alkalosis was not chloride responsive.

1. Access:  Patient had a right subclavian vein and right
   radial arterial line which were both discontinued prior to
   discharge.  A PICC line was placed by Interventional
   Radiology.

1. Prophylaxis:  The patient was maintained on subcutaneous
   heparin, Venodynes and proton pump inhibitor.

1. Hyperglycemia:  The patient was on an insulin sliding
   scale with good glycemic control throughout her admission.
