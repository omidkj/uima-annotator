again failed and was reintubated.  She was brought back to the

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 18937**] is a 64F Spanish speaking, with DM, HTN and
tracheomalacia s/p metal stent placement and multiple
intubation/extubation, awaiting corrective surgery.
She had an episode of tracheomalacia/resp failure after cervical
tracheal stent removal and failed extubation. She had the stent
replaced and plans made for corrective surgery. The patient was
monitored in the ICU and had difficulty with secretions related
to the stent, but overall did well.  She was maintained
intermittently on humidified air which improved her symptoms.
She was taken to the operating room on [**2157-1-31**] for Stent
removal in preparation for T-tube placement.
Because of her deconditioning and her good but not profoundly
impressive response to tracheal stenting, she underwent tracheal
T tube placement with a plan for pulmonary rehabilitation prior
to any cervical trachea surgery.  She responded very well to the
procedure and good pulmonary toileting with saturations on room
air 95-98%.  Given her long standing history of GERD and
compliant of intermittent dysphagia,  she was seen by GI who
recommended an EGD which was done on [**2157-2-13**] and showed no
esophagitis or stricture, small hiatal hernia.  She was
continued on her PPIs and H2 blockers.  She was restarted on her
home medications.  She was discharged to home with VNA and
pulmonary rehabilitation.  She will follow-up with Dr.[**Name (NI) 5070**]
office as an outpatient.
