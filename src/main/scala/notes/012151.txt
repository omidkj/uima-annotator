Chief Complaint:
Chief Complaint: Direct admit from home for treatment of
endocarditis, vegetation on RV lead of AICD


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Removal of infected pacemaker leads via [**Doctor First Name **]-sternotomy
PICC line placement


History of Present Illness:
44 yo M with RV dysplasia, s/p AICD who is admitted for
treatment of right sided endocarditis a/w with his AICD wire.
Patient initially started having fevers, chills, malaise,
anorexia and nausea in [**1-7**] initially thought to be a PNA and
rxed with Avelox by his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] did not have chest pain or sob
at that time. No blood cultures were drawn. In mid [**2143-2-3**]
his symptoms recurred and he had one episode of syncope while
chopping wood in his yard. His AICD fired at that time. His
device was interrogated and he was sent home without further
intervention. He returned to his PCP with ongoing symptoms and
was again treated with 6-7 days of antibiotics (same [**Doctor Last Name 360**]) and
again felt better with treatment. A CXR was performed and was
c/w PNA. CT of the chest was also performed and showed multiple
peripheral lung opacities. He was then referred to a
Pulmonologist who diagnosed him with emphyseam and OSA. The
patient did not agree with this diagnosis and sought a second
opinion. Another CT was done and showed similar findings. A
second pulmonologist diagnosed him with the flu. In [**5-/2143**], he
had another episode of fevers/chills, loss of appetite and
malaise and was put on 21 days of antibiotic therapy with
Augmentin. Again, no cultures were drawn. In [**6-8**] patient felt
better with improved appetite and energy levels since he showed
a response to antibiotics each time.
.
He then again had recurrence of anorexia and malaise with low
grade fevers in [**7-9**] and was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] under Dr.
[**Name (NI) **]. CT Scan of the chest that revealed multifocal
opacities of varying morphologies, including patchy areas of
gound-glass opacity and nodules up to 6 mm in diameter in in
multiple lobes. There was symetric mediastinal lymphadenopathy
with nodes up to 12 mm in the pretracheal area, and borderline
left and right hilar adenopathy. There were ICD leads in the
right atrial and ventricular
contacts. Bronchoscopy and [**Name2 (NI) **] with endobronchial and
transbronchial biopsis were done on [**2143-8-20**] showing negative
stains and cultures for bacteria, fungi and acid-fast organisms.

.
He had another chest CT scan on [**2143-9-11**] that was compared with a
prior study of [**7-9**]. This revealed multiple new, predominantly
peripheral irregular nodular opacities in both lungs, and a new
area of gound-glass opacity peripherally in the superior segment
of the RLL. Previously seen nodules in the LUL, RUL and RLL were
either unchanged or decreased in size. There was symmetric
mediastinal lymphadenopathy with nodes up to 12 mm in the
pretracheal region, and left hilar and right hilar borderline
adenopathy that was stable compared to the CT scan of [**7-9**]. He
was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] from [**9-30**] -> [**2143-10-1**] for VATS to take
biopsies. This revealed acute and organizing thromboemboli with
focal infarctionand extensive reactive changes including
organizing pneumonitis. TEE was then done on [**10-21**] to r/out
endocarditis. This showed a 3 cm mobile, irregular echogenic
mass with multiple smaller components attached to the right
venticular wire at the level of the right atrium. The left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and systolic function
were normal with EF > 55% and 1+ MR. With these results he was
referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2148**] in ID and finally drew blood cultures
for bacterial, fungal, AFB and bartonella isolators. His blood
cx came positive for [**3-7**] GPC in clusters and he was contact[**Name (NI) **] to
come to the hospital for IV antibiotic treatment and possible
lead removal.
.
ROS: last fever and chills ~ 1 week ago, denies HA, had two
episodes of visual blurring b/l, resolved spontaneously, no
N/V/D, no dysuria, no change in urine output.

Past Medical History:
- RV dysplasia dx at age 16, presenting with two episodes of
exertional syncope. He has been on chronic treatment with
Quinidine
- Paroxysmal VT requiring placement of an AICD in [**2135**] done at
[**Hospital1 **].
- AICD was changed from the left to the right side of chest in
[**2139**] due to lead fracture (done at OSH)
- AICD fires ~ 1x per year, usually associated with strenuous
activity,  usually chopping wood, usually has lightheadeness and
presyncope, occasional frank syncope.
- recurrent pulmonary infections as a child and young adult
- multiple pulmonary nodules s/p right VATS and lung biopsy
[**2143-9-30**] c/w acute and chronic organizing thromboemboli with
focal infarction and extensive reactive changes including
organizing pneumonitis.
- vegetation on his AICD leads was seen on TTE [**10-18**] and TEE on
[**10-21**].


Social History:
Works as a real estate [**Doctor Last Name 360**]. He is married with 2 children from
a previous marriage, they have several pets including a dog and
cats. Of note he hunts deer and wild [**Country 1073**], and guts his own
game. He last did this when he was feeling well in [**6-8**] when he
hunted [**Country **].

and is in good health. His father died of esophageal cancer at
the age of 58. He has four siblings, who are alive and in good
health. No history of cardiac disorders in the family.

CTA chest/abd/pelvis [**10-24**]:
CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a new dual-lead pacer
that has been placed since the prior study, and the prior one
removed. An additional abandoned pacer wire overlying the left
shoulder is unchanged. There are multiple small mediastinal
lymph nodes, which did not meet CT criteria for pathological
enlargement, but are mildly prominent and likely reactive. There
is no axillary lymphadenopathy. There are mildly prominent
bilateral hilar lymph nodes, particularly on the left, an
unchanged appearance. The heart, great vessels, and pericardium
are unremarkable. There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
There are small bilateral effusions, greater on the right than
left. There is evidence of recent VATS wedge resection
surgeries. A number of the previously demonstrated
