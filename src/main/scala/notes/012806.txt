[**2107-7-29**] ERCP:
A bulging of the major papilla was noted.
The pancreatic duct was filled partially with contrast and
appeared normal
The distal most part of the CBD was filled with contrast and
there was a tight 1cm malignant appearing stricture
Cannulation of the CBD was not successful using a sphincterotome

A small pre-cut sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock
position using a needle-knife to aid in accessing the CBD
Cannulation of the pancreatic duct was performed with a
sphincterotome using a free-hand technique
A 6cm by 5FR plastic single pigtail pancreatic stent was placed
successfully to aid in CBD cannulation and decrease risk of
acute pancreatitis.
Despite extensive maneuvering and use of different catheters and
guidewires, the CBD was not able to be cannulated.

[**2107-7-29**] PTBD PLACEMENT:
IMPRESSION:
1. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram demonstrating dilated
right and
left intrahepatic biliary ducts and dilated common bile duct. A
complete
obstruction of the distal CBD was noted and attempts to cross
into the bowel were unsuccessful at this stage.
2. A modified 6 French external biliary catheter was placed with
the pigtail formed and locked in the distal CBD and connected to
an external drainage bag.

[**2107-7-30**] ABD CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. 24 mm mass in the pancreatic head/ampullary region which
appears to be
confined to the pancreas except possible extension in to the
duodenal wall and slightly into the pancreaticoduodenal groove.
This most likely represents a pancreatic adenocarcinoma, but
amopullary carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma are possible.
2. Replaced right hepatic artery otherwise conventional hepatic
arterial and venous anatomy with widely patent SMA, SMV, and
portal veins, without evidence of vascular involvement. No
definite lymphadenopathy. Pancreatic stent in expected position
without pancreatic duct dilation snd percutaneous transhepatic
biliary catheter with tip in the CHD with no bile duct dilation.

3. 4.8-cm slightly complex cyst in the left kidney. Attention on
follow up
recommended.

[**2107-7-31**] ECG:
Sinus rhythm. Tracing is within normal limits. No previous
tracing available for comparison.

[**2107-8-1**] EGD:
No evidence of active bleeding and no evidence of hemobilia.
Small pigmented area over ulcer at ampulla, which is a possible
site of intermittent bleeding.
Successful bipolar cautery treatment.

[**2107-8-2**] PTBD REPLACEMENT:
IMPRESSION:
1. Removal of the external 6.3 French biliary drain over the
wire.
2. Check cholangiogram demonstrating decompression of the
biliary ductal
system as compared to the prior study dated [**2107-7-29**].
However, there is high grade stenosis noted in the terminal CBD
with trickle of contrast flowing into the distal bowel.
3. Successful negotiation of the stricture and placement of
internal-external drain, 8 French in size with pigtail formed in
the jejunal loop.

[**2107-8-12**] ECG:
Sinus tachycardia, rate 114. Low voltage in the limb leads.
Otherwise, tracing is within normal limits. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2107-7-31**] the low voltage is new. T waves are
also more prominent throughout the tracing. These changes are
non-specific but myocardial ischemia is not excluded as an
etiology. Consider electrolyte changes.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient with history of painless jaundice x 3 weeks was
admitted to the General Surgical Service for evaluation and
treatment.  On [**2107-7-29**], the patient underwent ERCP, which was
unsuccessful for CBD stent placement and only pancreatic stent
was placed ( please refer to the Operative Note for details). On
same day, patient underwent placement of PTBD. After procedure,
the patient arrived on the floor and was started on regular
diet, on IV fluids and antibiotics, with a foley catheter
(placed by Urology), and IV Dilaudid for pain control. On
[**2107-7-30**] patient underwent CTA, which demonstrated 24 mm mass in
the pancreatic head/ampullary region with possible extent ion
into duodenal wall. Patient was evaluated for possible
Whipple/bypass resection.
Neuro/Delirium: Patient was completely independent with ADL
