Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2962**]
Chief Complaint:
VT

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ICD revision (implantation of subcutaneous coil and generator
change)


History of Present Illness:
78 year old male with CAD and end stage cardiomyopathy with EF
of 10%. He has a BIV ICD and presented to [**Hospital3 7362**] today
after having a syncope episode this morning, witnessed by his
wife. She believes he was shocked several times as she saw him
get jolted. En route to the hospital he had some transient vtach
noted by EMS but  no further VT at [**Hospital3 7362**]. Enzymes so
far negative.
.
On arrival at [**Hospital1 **], he states that he feels back to baseline. No
fever, chills, N/V/Cough/SoB, diarrhea, constipation, muscle
aches or pains.  His wife thinks he was unconscious for
approximately 30 seconds.  He does not remember the episode but
remembers feeling lightheaded prior to syncopizing.  He awoke on
the floor of his bedroom.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, joint pains,
cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent
fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf
pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema.

[**9-20**] CXR
Lungs are mildly hyperinflated and clear. There is no pulmonary
edema or vascular engorgement. Heart size is normal. No pleural
effusion is present or indication of pneumothorax.

Two left subclavian [**Month/Year (2) **] defibrillator leads arising below the
field of view end in the right atrium and right ventricle, as
before. Two additional remnant pacemaker leads rising in the
right axilla end in the right atrium and right ventricle as
before. Three epicardial leads projecting over the left heart
border are unchanged in their respective positions.
.
[**9-21**] PMIBI:
INTERPRETATION:

The image quality is adequate. The patient's arms are down.

Left ventricular cavity size is markedly enlarged. EDV is 300
mL.

Rest and stress perfusion images reveal a large severe fixed
perfusion defect
involving the apical inferior to basal inferior segments.

Gated images reveal global hypokinesis.

The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 14%.

IMPRESSION: 1) Severe fixed perfusion defect involving the
apical inferior to
basal inferior segments. 2) Marked ventricular enlargement. 3)
Ejection
fraction is 14%.
.
[**9-21**] Stress: HR 52%
INTERPRETATION: 75 yo man (h/o CAD and ischemic cardiomyopathy
with
LVEF ~10%; BIV/ICD placement [**2101**]) was referred for evaluation
following
an episode of VT. The patient was administered 0.142 mg/kg/min
of
persantine over 4 minutes. No chest, back, neck or arm
discomforts were
reported by the patient during the procedure. The ECG is
uninterpretable
in the presence of ventricular pacing. The rhythm was AV paced
with
frequent isolated multiformed VPDs and rare ventricular
couplets. Rare
isolated APDs were noted. The hemodynamic response to the
persantine
infusion was appropriate. Three min post-MIBI, the patient was
administered 125 mg aminophylline IV.

IMPRESSION: No anginal symptoms with an uninterpretable ECG.
Nuclear
report sent separately.


Brief Hospital Course:
.
VT: Thought to be from ischemic cardiomyopathy, ICD
interrogation  showed that he was in VT-->VF-->resulting in 3
shocks with the first two shocks at 35 J being unsuccessful and
the third shock at 35 J successful.  On admission, his
mexiletine was discontinued and he was started on dofetilide 500
[**Hospital1 **].  On [**9-28**], in order to improve his shock vector, he
underwent a subcutaneous shocking coil placement and upgraded to
[**Company 1543**] Concerto. The SCV coil was capped and replaced by the
SQ coil . See separte OP and EP notes for technical details. The
ICD generator was upgraded to a newer model to have the ability
to remoive the ICD can from the shock vector noninvasively if
need be. On [**9-29**], he was noted to have multiple episodes of fast
VT, polymorphic VT, and VF requiring shock (first one
successful).  He was transferred to the CCU at this time (Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2232**]) and his dofetilide was stopped.  Lidocaine drip was
started with improvement in ventricular ectopy.  He was then
restarted on mexilitene 150 TID.  However, on the mexilitene he
was noted to have increasing ventricular ectopy and his dose was
increased to 200 TID.  He was however unable to tolerate this
dose of mexilitene and due to nausea, vomitting, his dose was
decreased once again to 150 TID.  He tolerated this dose, but
did continue to have episodes of VT.  He was advised to refrain
from driving for 6 months.
.
CHF:  He has known cardiomyopathy with EF 10%.  He remained
relative
