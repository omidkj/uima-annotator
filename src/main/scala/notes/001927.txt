HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83-year-old man with
a history of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, CAD,
atrial fibrillation on digoxin, congestive heart failure,
transferred from rehabilitation for chest pain and
bradycardia.  The patient had three hospital admissions over
the last month for increased gait disturbance thought to be
secondary to worsening spinal stenosis, increased confusion,
bowel incontinence, was stabilized and sent to rehabilitation
each time without definite diagnosis.  He did receive
intravenous antibiotics several times and steroid injections
for spinal stenosis.  At rehabilitation he was doing well,
alert and oriented x 3, when he complained of chest pain and
diaphoresis on the morning of admission.  The patient was
given his AM cardiac medications and later found to have a
heart rate of 20s to 30s, did not have loss of consciousness.
In the ambulance he was given atropine, external pacing was
started, and he was given Versed 2 mg.  In the Emergency
Department he had a heart rate of 26, blood pressure of
90/40.  He was given 1 mg of atropine, 1 amp of bicarbonate,
2 mg of Versed x 2.  Heart rate increased to 50s to 60s,
pacing was able to be stopped.  He received EP evaluation who
felt bradycardia was likely due to digoxin toxicity.  He
received a renal evaluation and urged to check digoxin level.
He was scheduled for hemodialysis on the day of admission,
and he was to have medical intensive care unit monitoring.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. End-stage renal disease on
hemodialysis Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, for two years.
2. Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction
12 years ago.  3. Congestive heart failure, left ventricular
ejection fraction of 40%.  4. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
5. Hypertension.  6. Diabetes mellitus type 2.  7.
Cerebrovascular accident with residual difficulty swallowing.
8. Anemia on Epogen.  9. Benign prostatic hypertrophy.  10.
Peripheral vascular disease.  11. Spinal stenosis with
steroid injections.  12. Ischemic colitis.  13. History of
positive palpated.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  1. LAntus. 28 q.h.s.  2.
Regular Insulin sliding scale.  3. Nephrocaps 1 q.d.  4.
Megace 20 cc q.d.  5. Digoxin 0.125 mg q.o.d.  6. Coreg 6.25
mg b.i.d.  7. Tums one tablet t.i.d.  8. Diltiazem 90 q. 6
hours.  9. Lipitor 10 q.h.s.  10. Magnesium oxide 400 b.i.d.
11. Coumadin 2 q.h.s.  12. Epogen q. hemodialysis.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission his vital signs were
pulse 73, blood pressure 141/59, respiratory rate 20, oxygen
saturation 96% on 100% nonrebreather.  In general he was an
elderly man, somnolent, opened eye to voice.  HEENT:  Pupils
were equal, round, and reactive to light, oropharynx dry.
Neck:  No jugular venous distension, no bruit.
Cardiovascular:  Normal S1 and S2, regular rate and rhythm.
Lungs:  Decreased breath sounds at the bases with rales left
greater than right, diffuse expiratory wheezing.  Abdomen:
Softly distended, positive bowel sounds, nontender.
Extremities:  Left chest tunneled catheter and no edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  Admission white count was 21.3, hematocrit
30.0, hemoglobin 10.0, MCV 103, platelet count 230.  Sodium
133, potassium 5.9, chloride 92, CO2 19, BUN 91, creatinine
7.0, glucose 285, 71% neutrophils, 18 lymphocytes, 9
monocytes, 0.3 eosinophils, 0.4 basophils.  INR was 3.5, PT
23, PTT 36.5.  Digoxin level was 2.7.  CK 557, troponin T
3.8, calcium 9.0, phosphate 8.7, magnesium 2.0.

Chest x-ray was significant for minimal upper zone
distribution, right pleural effusion.

EKG showed atrial fibrillation at 55 beats per minute, normal
axis, no P wave.  Q waves in 2, 3 and aVF, V4 through V6.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1. Bradycardia:  The patient's digoxin,
calcium channel blocker, and beta blocker were all held.  His
digoxin level was decreased to 1.4 the day prior to
admission.  Digoxin was not to be restarted.  Calcium channel
blocker was not restarted.  Beta blocker was restarted.  The
patient tolerated metoprolol.  It was titrated up and was
sent out on Coreg 6.25 b.i.d. as outpatient regimen.  His ACE
inhibitor was restarted and controlled his blood pressure at
a dose of 25 mg p.o. q.i.d. of captopril.  The patient had no
more episodes of bradycardia.  Heart rates were in the 60s to
80s and he was taken off telemetry.

2. Pleural effusion, right:  The patient had a chronic right
pleural effusion that was documented by several x-rays.  The
patient had an elevated white count.  Pleural effusion
resolved post dialysis and was not tapped, not felt to be
related to the white count.

3. Elevated white count:  The patient had an elevated white
count in the 15-20 range over the past month or two.  Work-up
for infection has been negative.  The patient will most
likely need a bone marrow biopsy as an outpatient when he
stabilizes.

The patient's INR was 3.5 on admission.  Coumadin was held
and the INR came down to 1.4 with anticipation of
thoracentesis.  Thoracentesis of the pleural effusion was not
performed, and Coumadin was restarted to titrate up with a
goal of [**3-12**] due to atrial fibrillation.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Bradycardia.
2. Digoxin toxicity.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Nephrocaps 1 capsule p.o. q.d.
2. Calcium carbonate 500 mg p.o. t.i.d.
3. Ranitidine 150 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
5. Atorvastatin 10 mg p.o. q.d.
6. Insulin sliding scale.
7. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
8. Senna 1 tablet p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n.

10. Carvedilol 6.25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
11. Warfarin 2 mg p.o. q.d., please check INR for goal of
[**3-12**].

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  The patient will follow up with his primary
care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] renal doctor, GI, cardiology with one to

DISPOSITION:  The patient will be discharged to [**Location (un) 620**]
nursing facility at [**Street Address(2) 49790**].  Needs to be
