Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory Failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation and extubation


History of Present Illness:
This is a 60 year old female with past medical history of
asthma, CAD, AF, and embolic stroke who presented from [**Location (un) 620**]
with respiratory failure.  Per report the patient called EMS
today reporting dyspnea.  When they arrived she was very short
of breath and appeared cyanotic with diffuse crackles.
Therefore, she was put on NIPPV and transferred to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]
where she was intubated with succinylcholine etomidate.  Given
pink, frothy secretions from the tube and bilateral fluffy
infiltrates presumed etiology was heart failure exacerbation so
the patient received 80 mg of IV furosemide and was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**]. En route the patient was hypotensive on propofol,
which was discontinued.  On arrival she was agitated and
received fentanyl/midazolam for sedation before receiving
linezolid and pipercillin-tazobactam due to concern the
patient's infiltrates were due to pneumonia. Initial ABG here
was 7.23/ 71 / 406 on AC with Tv 450, RR 16, PEEP 5, and 02
100%.   The patient was noted to have high peak pressures (>30)
with high plateaus raising concern for auto-PEEP.  Therefore, he
received 10 mg IV vercuronium.  He also received an unclear
amount of fluid for transient hypotension.  With increasing her
minute ventilation pH rose to 7.9 and CO2 dropped to 60.  He was
transferred to the MICU.  Of note, the patient had a VERY
similar presentation on [**2169-8-5**] in which the patient was
admitted for multifocal pneumonia with concern for volume
overload.  During that hospitalization she had very quick
resolution of her chest radiograph and was discharged on a
course of linezolid / piperacillin-tazobactam.

On arrival to the MICU the patient was intubated and sedated.
Paralysis was coming off but patient still not interacting/
reacting in a meaningful way.  Some spontaneous movements.

Past Medical History:
Left MCA territory embolic infarct, likely of cardioembolic
etiology in [**2166-5-16**]
Atrial fibrillation on sotalol and coumadin

Sick sinus syndrome status post dual-chamber pacemaker
MVR
Hyperlipidemia
Diabetes mellitus, type 2
Obesity
Hypertension
Asthma
Ostructive sleep apnea on BIPAP
Mild pulmonary HTN 36/18 on cath in [**8-21**]


Social History:
Significant for the absence of
current tobacco use (quit at age of 22)  No heavy alcohol.

Family History:
Per OMR - Her father died of CAD in his 50's, he had his first
MI at age 41. She has multiple younger brothers with "heart
problems."

Physical Exam:
VS: 95.9 Temp: BP:102/62 HR:72 RR 18, and O2sat 93 % on vent
GEN:  Intubated, sedated, markedly hirstute, NAD
HEENT: anisocoria (appears old), not following commands,
occasionally aoviding noxiious stimuli or maoning.  NO LAD or
masses appreciated.
RESP: Crackles bilaterally with prolonged espiratory phase.
CV: Distant heart sounds, regular, not taychcardic
ABD: Soft, NT, ND, BS+
EXT: cool, large (3-2 cm) round, smooth edged ulcer on right
anterio thigh with erythema and granulation tissue but no acute
pus.
NEURO: intubated and sedating, moving all four extremities
equally.

OTHER RESULTS
==============
Admission EKG: A paced at 80.  IVCD.  No acute ST changes.

Chest Radiograph [**2169-10-11**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Hilar prominence with bilateral lung opacities is concerning
for pulmonary congestion/edema with possible pneumonia.
2. Tubes positioned appropriately

Chest Radiograph [**2169-10-13**] 3:31 AM(post extubation):
IMPRESSION:
AP chest compared to [**10-12**]:
The patient has been extubated, lung volumes are normal, and the
lungs are
clear following resolution of heterogeneous opacification in
both lower lungs yesterday. Given the rapid clearance, these
findings were not due to
hemorrhage or pneumonia or noncardiogenic edema. Cardiac edema
and toxic
inhalation or massive aspiration, the likely causes.
Heart size is top normal and unchanged. No pleural abnormality.
Transvenous
right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads in standard
placements.

Chest Radiograph [**2169-10-13**] 6:59 PM (post reintubation)
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval intubation and placement of NG tube.
2. New diffuse bilateral alveolar opacities. Given the time
course, this
most likely represents pulmonary edema.

Transesophageal Echo [**2169-10-14**]:
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
At least mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Dilated ascending
aorta.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2169-8-7**], an [**Year (4 digits) 34486**] jet of at least
mild-moderate mitral regurgitation is now seen.
Due to the [**Year (4 digits) 34486**] nature of the mitral regurgitation jet, if
clinically indicated a cardiac MRI [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9559**] may be best able
to assess the severity of mitral regurgitation.

CT Chest W/O Contrast [**2169-10-14**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Multifocal ground-glass opacities, compatible with multifocal
pneumonia.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Unchanged multilobulated right hepatic hypodense lesion,
compatible with
the previously described biliary cystadenoma.
4. 1.3 cm simple left renal cyst.
5. Status post cholecystectomy.
.
CXR [**10-16**]:
1. Significant interval clearing of the lungs. Despite previous
description as multifocal pneumonia, the apparent rapid
resolution of these infiltrates suggest that this more likely
may be due to pulmonary edema.
2. Interval extubation and removal of the NG tube.
.
[**10-19**] Renal CTA:
1. No evidence for renal artery stenosis. No significant
atherosclerotic
disease.
2. Complex hepatic cyst, unchanged in size compared to [**Month (only) 216**]
[**2168**], and also previously characterized by ultrasound. If
further characterization is required, this could be accomplished
by MRI.
3. Status post cholecystectomy.
4. Left parapelvic cysts, with additional exophytic cyst arising
posteriorly from the interpolar region of the left kidney.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
60 y.o. female with [**Hospital 7235**] medical problems and recent
admission for "pneumonia" now readmitted for pneumonia and CHF.

.
1. Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF: Patient presented with
bilateral infiltrates consistent with multifocal pneumonia vs
CHF.   She was empirically treated with antibiotics and
furosemide with improvement but difficulty assessing exactly
what process was predominant.  Quick resolution and reappearance
of infiltrates was thought to be more consistent with diastolic
CHF.  After her first extubation proceeded uneventfully the
patient rapidly decompensated on arrival to the medical floor
with severe hypoxia and needed to be reintubated urgently.  It
is unclear what precipitated these episodes of decompensation
though hypotension was considered possible.  Cardiac enzymes
remained negative.  Echocardiogram showed MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 34486**] jet.
 Cardiology recommended gentle diuresis and gentle volume
resuscitation as needed to maintain SBP>100. They also
recommended starting an ACE inhibitor o
