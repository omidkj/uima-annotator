Headache

Cerebral Angiogram
External Ventricular Drain


History of Present Illness:
Pt is 53 y/o healthy M who presents with severe global
headache with onset at 4 pm today.  Pt stated that he had just
finished working on his truck at the time.  He describes the
headache as throbbing and is accompanied by dizziness.  Pt
states
that his vision from both eyes gets blurry at times.  When pt
developed his headache, he laid himself into his car, but was
able to walk and find his wife who took him to the hospital.  At
OSH, pt had a non-contrast head CT scan which showed a left
sided
SAH.  Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

CTA head Neck [**2150-5-6**]:
1. Large anterior communicating artery aneurysm whose rupture
appears to be the cause of the increasing subarachnoid
hemorrhage noted within the brain, compared to the prior
non-contrast head CT.
2. Markedly narrow A1 segment of the right anterior cerebral
artery may be
due to congenital hypoplasia or less likely due to spasm (given
time
duration).

CT head [**2150-5-7**]:
1. Redemonstration of extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage, as
described above. Of note, there is increased blood seen layering
within the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles.
2. Interval placement of a right frontal approach
ventriculostomy catheter, terminating in the left lateral
ventricle.
3. New aneurysm coils in the region of the anterior
communicating artery.
4. Stable hydrocephalus.

CT Head [**2150-5-7**]:
The patient is status post aneurysm coiling in the vascular
territory of the anterior communicating artery, unchanged
subarachnoid
hemorrhage and intraventricular hemorrhage with ventricular
shunt via right frontal burr hole, the tip terminating on the
left ventricular [**Doctor Last Name 534**] as described above. There is no
significant change in the size and configuration of the
ventricles since the prior study.
No evidence of low attenuation areas or significant edema to
indicate
subacute ischemic changes.
The CTA demonstrates persistent lobulated aspect of the aneurysm
in the
superior dome with no significant change since the prior
cerebral angiogram, and coil embolization. These findings were
discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] on [**5-7**] at 12:10 hrs.
Again hypoplasia of the A1 segment is redemonstrated, both
anterior cerebral arteries are filling from the left. No
flow-stenotic lesions are identified or vasospasm.

CTA Head [**2150-6-4**]
1. No intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Interval improvement of the vasospasm involving the left
middle cerebral artery, anterior cerebral arteries, posterior
cerebral arteries, and basilar artery.
3. Unchanged residual aneurysm filling at the base of the coil
pack of the
anterior communicating artery aneurysm.






Brief Hospital Course:
Patient presented on [**2150-5-6**] with severe headache and dizziness
after working on his truck. He also reported some blurred
vision. His wife took him to [**Hospital1 18**] where a [**Name (NI) 72787**] was performed
and found a left side SAH. Patient was then sent for a CTA where
an ACOM aneurysm was found. Patient became lethargic and less
responsive, angiogram was performed to coil aneurysm and an EVD
was placed to relieve ICP. His drain was leveled at 15 and was
observed to be draining well. Post angiogram check it was noted
that patient was moving his L>R. CTA/P was ordered and was
stable. He was then extubated. On [**5-8**], his exam improved, he was
a&ox3, full strength on L and antigravity with both upper and
lower extremities on the R side.

On [**5-12**], patient continues to be alert and oriented x3 and full
strength on L. RUE remains antigravity and RLE, he is only able
to wiggle toes. He was taken to angiogram where mild vasospasm
was seen and he received 10mg of verapamil intrathecally. His
SBP will be pushed to 180 and we will repeat angio on [**5-14**]. In
the afternoon, patient failed a clamping trial and drain was
reopened to relieve ICP. Overnight the drain was observed to be
draining less and a poor waveform was also noted. The drain was
flushed with normal saline, but continued to have poor waveform
and ouptut. TPA was administered to flush the drain proximally.
Patient remains stable. Overnight he also had a Tmax of 101.9,
he was pancultured and a CXR was ordered. CSF samples have been
negative to this date.

Over the weekend of [**5-16**] and [**5-17**], the patient's blood pressure
was liberalized by the SICu team to less than 140.  The patient
subsequently had a change in his neurological status.  He had
mental status changes and no command following.  A stat head
CT/CTA was performed , which showed persistent but not new
vasospasm.  He was kept at a strict
