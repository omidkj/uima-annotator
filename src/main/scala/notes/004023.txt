History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 97237**] is an 88 y/o man with PMH notable for stage IV CKD,
afib on coumadin, and CHF who was at his home earlier today when
he noted the onset of nausea. He reports no chest pain,
diaphoresis or abdominal pain at the time. He did have several
episodes of dry heaves. He called EMS and was taken to [**Hospital1 **]. On arrival to the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], he was noted to have
acute decompensation. O2 sat on arrival was 77-80% on [**Name6 (MD) 597**] [**Name8 (MD) **] MD
notes. He received lasix 100 mg and bumex 1 mg but made only 100
cc urine over the course of his stay; he then received 50 more
mg of lasix with no response. He was also placed on a nitro gtt
but blood pressures declined to 80s-90s systolic so this was
intermittently stopped. As his primary nephrologist is at [**Hospital1 18**]
and the outside hospital ED was worried about dialysis
initiation, he was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS were T 96.8, HR 62, BP 92/61, RR 17,
99% on bipap. BP transiently dropped to 88/28 and he was given a
250 cc NS bolus X 1. Due to ? infiltrate on CXR, he was given 1
g IV vancomycin and 750 mg IV levofloxacin. He was also treated
with combivent nebs. Eventually, he was placed on a [**Hospital1 597**] but
dropped his O2 sats to 88-92% so was placed back on BiPAP with
improvement in sats. Nitro gtt was also discontinued. Potassium
was found to be 6.8 and he was given calcium gluconate,
insulin/D50 and kayexelate.
.
On the floor, the patient states his breathing has improved
compared to earlier today. He denies any current nausea, chest
pain, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, or diaphoresis. He
would like to try to take off the BIPAP again. He states he did
have a few canned soups over the past few days but no other
dietary changes. After seeing Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on Tuesday, he held his
lasix on Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday morning per
instructions and then resumed 80 mg Wednesday evening.
.
