Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2758**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis on [**2193-3-11**]


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 28272**] is an 85 F with a history of COPD on 3 L O2 at home
and a history of recurrent exudative bilateral pleural effusions
of unknown etiology with pleural fluid drainage from her Pleurex
catheter Monday, Wednesday, Friday who came to the ED for chest
pain, SOB, and increased pleural drainage.

Of note the patient's pleural effusions were diagnosed at
[**Hospital 882**] Hospital in [**2192-12-10**], per the last D/C summary in
OMR she was found to have an "undiagnosed lymphocytic, exudative
effusion with negative cytology, AFB, bacterial and fungal
cultures." She was hospitalized late [**Month (only) **] at [**Hospital1 18**] in the
ICU for an exacerbation of her COPD and CT thorax and echo
failed to clearly delineate the cause of the effusions.
Thoracentesis was exudative. It was felt that she was not
healthy enough from a pulmonary point of view to tolerate a
thoracoscopy to further investigate the causes of the pleural
effusions and she opted for a palliative right tunnelled
catheter for symptomatic relief. Hospice was consulted and she
decided that she wanted to return home with services, not
hospice, but would remain DNR/DNI.  PT was discharged to [**Hospital 100**]
Rehab and has since returned home for the last two months with
three times weekly drainage of her pleurex.

Last night she noted increased right chest pain. She has a
chronic intermittant cough over the past 6 months and states it
has increased over the past 2 days. This morning her CP
persisted so she had her son come home from work and drain her
pleurex catheter.  He noted increased pleural fluid from the
catheter (400 cc vs 150 cc normal), that appeared darker in
color.  She continued to have chest pain and was brought to the
ED.

In the ED the patient looked uncomfortable with RR in high 20s.
Portable CXR showed a large left sided pleural effusion.  EKG
showed NSR, 87 bpm, old ST dep in V3-V4 and TWI in V1-3.  WBC
elevated from baseline at 10. Her K+ was initially elevated but
was repeated and normal.  She was given morphine 4 mg x 2 for
pain which helped.  Vital signs at transfer were VS: HR 80,
97/52, 20  94% on 4L nc.

On the floor, pt was breathing comfortably on 3 L nc. She
complained of pleuritic chest pain and denied fever, chills, URI
symptoms, dysuria, rash, calf pain, recent weight loss.  ROS was
otherwise + for decreased appetite and arthritis in her neck
that occasionally causes headaches.

[**2193-3-6**] CTA: INDICATION: Acute onset chest pain and hypoxia.
Evaluate PleurX catheter. CTA CHEST: MDCT imaging was performed
from the thoracic inlet to the upper abdomen without IV
contrast. Subsequently, after the uneventful intravenous
administration of 100 cc of Optiray, MDCT imaging was again
performed from the thoracic inlet to the upper abdomen.
Sagittal, coronal, and oblique reformats were performed. The
patient's IV infiltrated during the saline bolus measuring
approximately 30 cc. A cold compress was applied. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4026**] ICU
resident was made aware.

COMPARISON: CT chest [**2192-12-17**]. FINDINGS: There are
partially occlusive filling defects involving segmental vessels
to the right middle and right lower lobe (3:61, 3:67). No
left-sided pulmonary arterial filling defects are present. The
main pulmonary artery is top normal measuring 2.9 cm. The
thoracic aorta is in its ascending portion is slightly enlarged
measuring 4 cm in AP dimension at the level of the right main
pulmonary artery. Similar to the previous examination is mural
thrombus seen along the right lateral border of the descending
thoracic aorta, which is unchanged. There is calcification at
the aortic arch.

There are severe emphysematous disease, most pronounced at the
lung apices, but similar to the previous study. There is a small
left pleural effusion with basilar atelectasis. The Pleurex
catheter is present in the right chest along the contour of the
right hemidiaphragm. Increased since the prior examination is a
moderate-sized left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.
No pericardial fluid is present. There are coronary artery
vascular calcifications. There are no signs of heart strain.

BONE WINDOWS: There are mild degenerative changes of the
thoracic spine. No suspicious sclerotic or lytic lesions are
present.

IMPRESSION:
1. Pulmonary arterial filling defects in segmental and
subsegmental branches
of the right middle and right lower lobes. No evidence for heart
strain.
2. Moderate left effusion. Small right effusion. Bibasilar
atelectasis.
Satisfactory position of PleurX catheter along the right contour
of the right
hemidiaphragm.
3. Severe emphysema. No pneumothorax.
4. Top normal size main pulmonary artery. Top normal size
ascending aorta
with stable thrombus in the descending thoracic aorta.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 28272**] is a 85 F with a PMH of COPD and recurrent pleural
effusions of unknown etiology who was originally admitted to the
ICU with worsening hypoxia. CTA of the chest revealed RML/RLL
segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli. She was also noted
to have a large left pleural effusion. Ultimately her symptoms
were thought to be from the effusions and exacerbated by the
pulmonary emboli.

She was started on anticoagulation and observed in the ICU and
then called out to the floor. She had a slight drop in her
hematocrit but was guaiac negative on multiple occasions and her
hematocrit stabilized without intervention by discharge.

On arrival to the floor Ms. [**Known lastname 28272**] was quite clear that she was
suffering with her advanced COPD and recurrent effusions and she
wanted to pursue hospice care. Multiple family discussions were
held and collectively it was decided that she would have a
therapeutic thoracentesis of the left-sided effusion. She would
also continue her right-sided pleural fluid drainage on Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday and continue on Lovenox/warfarin for her
pulmonary emboli. However, she would also begin to utilize
