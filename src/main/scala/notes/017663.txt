Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 81 yo woman with CAD, Afib, CHF, CKD admitted with
worsening anemia in setting of supratherapeutic INR. Was seen at
OSH but had difficult antibodies for RBC transfusion,
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
Anemia: Likely acute blood loss superimprosed on chronic
underproduction from chronic kidney dx or even possibly from her
history of local chemotherapy for bladder cancer treatment.  Hct
increased from 13 on admission to 28 with 4 units pRBCs.
Patient had melanotic stools x1, otherwise was asymptomatic.
Was diuresed with IV lasix with transfusions, and her BB/CCB
were held on admission, so as not to mask reflex tachycardia in
the setting of acute blood loss.  At the time of discharge, she
was hemodynamically stable and her home doses of BB and CCB were
restarted.
.
GI bleed: Pt. was transfused to support anemia, and
anticoagulation was reversed with Vit. K and FFP.  Pt. will have
a colonoscopy/EGD as outpatient to be arranged this week.
Aspirin and coumadin will be held until after GI studies are
completed.  Pt. has h/o labile INR and was supratherapeutic (INR
2.5) on admission, so will have to be cautious when
anticoagulation is restarted.  Encouraged Pt. to have frequent
INR checks.
