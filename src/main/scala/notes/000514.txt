HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  An 83-year-old female with a
history of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis on six liters of
oxygen and 10 mg of prednisone at baseline, congestive heart
failure, hypertension, was found by primary care physician on
[**5-29**] to have ambulatory sats of 70 percent.  The patient
was admitted to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital and started on Solu-Medrol
and levofloxacin.  The patient underwent CT of chest at
outside hospital which showed ground glass opacities
bilaterally and no PE.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for lung biopsy and
intubated.  Lung biopsy only showed pulmonary congestion
consistent with congestive heart failure and interstitial
pulmonary fibrosis.  The patient was eventually extubated on
[**6-5**] and a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed
which showed severe left ventricular global hypokinesis,
ejection fraction 20 percent, 1 plus mitral regurgitation, PA
pressure not estimated because of size of patient.  In the
Medical Intensive Care Unit the patient was empirically
treated for PCP with Bactrim and pneumonia with Levaquin and
diuresed with modest improvement in breathing.  The patient
states she still gets very short of breath with any movement
such as moving in bed.  The patient cannot move to commode
without shortness of breath.  The patient also just denies
any chest pain, no cough or fever, no abdominal or urinary
symptoms.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Interstitial pulmonary fibrosis since
[**2097**].  Requires six liters of oxygen at home.  Essentially
any movement makes the patient desaturate.  Chronically on
steroids.  Congestive heart failure.  Had clean cardiac
catheterization in [**2086**].  Question of viral etiology of
cardiomyopathy.  Hypertension.  Hyperlipidemia.

ALLERGIES:  Procardia, Voltaren.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Afebrile, 80, 127/51, 22, 94 percent
on six liters face mask.  No apparent distress.  Alert and
oriented times three.  Moist mucus membranes.  Oropharynx
clear.  Jugular venous pressure difficult to assess because
of neck size.  Regular rate without murmur.  Distant S1, S2.
Diffuse crackles and bronchial sounds in upper airways.  No
wheezes.  Soft, obese, positive bowel sounds, non-tender, non-
distended.  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema, warm.

She gave sputum, oropharynx on [**6-3**].  Biopsy consistent with
IPF and pulmonary edema.

LABORATORY:  White count 11.8, hematocrit 30.9, platelet
count 202,000.  Electrolytes unremarkable.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Respiratory failure:  The patient's biopsy
was consistent with end-stage interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
that might have been exacerbated by congestive heart failure.
The patient was also empirically treated for PCP and
pneumonia with ten days of Levaquin and Bactrim.  The patient
was on 40 mg of prednisone and this should be tapered down to
10 mg q. day which is her home dose.  After discussions with
the patient and her family, the Pulmonary team felt that this
was end-stage interstitial pulmonary fibrosis that would have
a progressive course regardless of any treatment modalities.
The patient and family then spoke with the Palliative Care
team at [**Hospital1 69**] and it was felt
that she should go to rehab for one week to try to build up
strength and ability to walk and then to go home with hospice
care.  The patient felt that bronchodilators were of no
benefit so these were discontinued upon her discharge.
Morphine sulfate IV was used as needed for shortness of
breath and dyspnea.  She will be sent out on oxycodone 5 mg
to 10 mg orally q. 4h. as needed for dyspnea.  This may be
increased upward as you see fit to treat her dyspnea.
Cardiovascularly, cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of 20
percent most likely viral etiology with clean cardiac
catheterization in [**2096**].  She will be restarted on her Bumex
0.5 mg q. day as diuresis.  She appeared slightly dry on
discharge.  An ACE inhibitor was also initiated here in the
hospital 10 mg q. day.

Code Status:  After discussions with the family she will
become DNR.  Her code status was changed to DNR/DNI.  The
patient has elected that with no further treatment modalities
to enter hospice after rehab.

DISPOSITION:  Discharge to rehab and then to hospice care.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Poor.  Unable to do any activities of
daily living.  Saturations 98 percent with six liters oxygen
but decreases upon minimal movement including her activities
of daily living.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Oxazepam 15 mg q. hs. as needed for sleep.
2. Zoloft 100 mg q. day.
3. Protonix 40 mg q. day.
4. Prednisone 40 mg q. day that should be tapered over one
   week to 10 mg q. day.
5. Lisinopril 10 mg q. day.
6. Oxycodone 5-10 mg q. 4h., save for shortness of breath or
   wheezing.
7. Bumex 0.5 mg q. day.


FOLLOW UP:  The patient after rehab stay will be discharged
to hospice care.
