History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 69 y/o M with PMH significant for ESRD s/p
cadaveric renal transplant in [**2145**] with CKD, afib, and recurrent
cellulitis who presented with cellulitis and hypotension. He was
admitted [**Date range (1) **] for cellutis and had right great toe
debridement and was discharged on ciprofloxacin and vancomycin
to treat osteomyelitis. He presented to [**Hospital **] clinic on day
PTA who felt his toe looked well post debridement. At home he
noted poor glucose control and fever so presented to the ED.
In the ED, he had a fever to 103.3 orally, HR 107, BP 153/69
with elevated lactate at 4.5. He received 1700 cc of NS and 650
mg of tylenol. Per ID recommendations he was given 2.25 g of
Zosyn IV X 1 and vancomycin and had good urine output with UA
and CXR clear. Due to elevated lactate and tachycardia decision
was made to admit the patient to the ICU.
While in the ICU he was continued on vancomycin and Zosyn per
ID. Renal was consulted and decreased cellcept to 500 [**Hospital1 **],
prednisone to 5, with plan to check Cyclosporin level in AM.
LENIs were negative and [**Hospital1 **] was consulted.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 69 y/o M with PMH significant for ESRD s/p
renal transplant in [**2145**] with persistent CKD, afib, and
recurrent cellulitis who presented with cellulitis and
septicemia.
.
# LLE post-procedure Cellulitis with septicemia
Markedly improved with zosyn and vancomycin
ID Consultation
- Continue vanc/zosyn total of 14 days
- Re consult [**Year (4 digits) **] felt surgical wound clean, not
osteomyelitis
- ID consult to follow vanco levels as outpatient

# CKD Stage 5 s/p Transplant:
Patient's creatinine increased from previous discharge.
Renal transplant consultation following
- Continue usual doses of cyclosporine and decreased cellcept
and prednisone per renal consult
They will continue to follow this in the outpatient setting
- Continue calcitriol, folplex vitamin.
.
# Gout: Continue allopurinol and prednisone at 10 mg daily.

Continue toprol, amiodarone for rate control
coumadin for anticoagulation and monitor INR.
