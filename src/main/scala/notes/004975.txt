Service: MED

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2972**]
Chief Complaint:
[**First Name3 (LF) **] of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1) Pericardiocentesis
2) u/s guided liver bx

History of Present Illness:
50 year old man with history of [**First Name3 (LF) 499**] cancer lymph node negative
s/p resection, XRT and chemo [**2183**] who presented to an outside
hospital with c/o [**Year (4 digits) 7186**] of breath x 6 weeks.  The patient is
a drummer in a heavy metal band and noticed that he had been
more "winded" after practices.  Over the week prior to
presentation, he said that he would get short of breath walking
approximately 400 yards.  He had previously worked in
construction so this was unusual for him.  1-2 days prior to
presentation he noticed that he would have chest pain and
breathing would become more painful when he would lie on his
back.
He denied dizzyness, lightheadedness, vision changes, LOC,
palpitations, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, difficulty
urinaring, change in bowel or bladder habits, or lower extremity
edema.
He said other things he had noticed over the past 2-6 weeks
included: sweats when he would lie down, "hot flashes", shaking
chills, (he never took a temperature at home), daily migrating
headaches lasting several hours, 10 lb weight loss over 2
months.
He has a significant travel history in the past 2-3 years,
especially to south east [**Female First Name (un) 8489**].  Most recently he has come back
from [**Country 3396**] in mid [**Month (only) 956**] - he had travelled into rural
areas during the trip but denied any illnesses during or after.
He presented to an OSH on [**9-28**] and was noted to be tachycardic
and anemic with non-specific EKG changes.  He was admitted for
further workup.  A CXR showed cardiomegaly, a retrocardiac
infiltrate/atelectasis, and ?pericardial effusion per report.
An ECHO done on [**9-30**] showed an EF >55%, mild LVH, and a 4-5cm
circumferential pericardial effusion, respiratory variation R+L
ventricle, and R atrial collapse.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for pericardiocentesis.

Past Medical History:
1. [**Hospital1 **] CA s/p resection, XRT, chemo [**2183**]
2. Anemia - recently diagnosed
3. Tachycardia
4. Chronic shoulder pain - no trauma history

Social History:
The patient has worked in construction for many years but
retired in [**7-18**] ("it's a young man's job").  He lives in a
studio in [**Location (un) 4628**], but lived in [**Location **] NH for many years.  His
sister lives [**Name2 (NI) 3592**].
He very occasionally uses alcohol.
He was a long time heavy smoker (age 24 to approximately 1 month
ago) averaging about [**1-15**] ppd.
He denies IVDU, but did use other recreational drugs as a high
school student.  He denies drug use for many years.

Pre-pericardiocentesis ECHO ([**10-1**])
Conclusions:
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but not
stenotic. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a large
pericardial
effusion. The effusion appears circumferential. No right
ventricular diastolic
collapse is seen. There is sustained right atrial collapse,
consistent with
low filling pressures or very early tamponade. There is left
atrial collapse.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the
presence of elevated
right sided pressures. There is significant, accentuated
respiratory variation
in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with impaired
ventricular
filling.

COMMENTS:
1. Hemodynamics on entry showed equalization of pressures in the
RA and
pericarium, which is diagnostic of pericardial tamponade.
2. Pericaridal needle was inserted into the pericardial space
under
pressure and ECG guidance. 888 cc of bloody fluid was aspirated
and sent
for cytology, chemistry and microscopy.
3. Hemodynamics after the pericardiocentesis showed resolution
of the
tamponade physiology.
4. Echocardiogram done after the pericardiocentesis showed a
small
pericardial effusion with no echocardiographic evidence of
tamponade.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Pericardial tamponade.

Post-pericardiocentesis ECHO ([**10-1**]):
Conclusions:
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet
excursion. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal.
There is a small
residual posterior pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs
of tamponade.

A round extrinsic mass (approximately 3 cm in diameter) abutting
and
compressing the right atrium is now seen

Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of
[**2190-10-1**], most of the fluid in the pericardial sac has been removed.
An extrinsic
mass compressing the right atrium is now seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
1.Cardiovascular
-- Pericardial Effusion: patient presented with SOB, exercise
intolerance, and nonspecific systemic sx including fevers,
chills, sweats, and weight loss.  He presented to an OSH and was
found to be anemic and tachycardic, with non specific EKG
changes.  An ECHO showed a collapsing RA concerning for
tmponande, and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
pericardiocentesis.  888cc bloody fluid sent for analysis,
patient subjectively much improved after tap. Drain in place
overnight draining sanguinous fluid, removed in AM.  Repeat ECHO
[**10-2**].  Fluid with too many RBC to count, and 3600 WBC, 19N/79L.
Etiology: metastatic vs. infectious (TB, HIV, other viral) vs.
hypothyroid vs. mediastinal radiation (XRT for [**Month/Year (2) 499**] CA?).
Cytology was negative for malignancy.
-- Rate/Rhythm: sinus tachycardia - question of possibly [**2-15**]
anemia - received 1 unit of blood, fluid boluses without change;
may be secondary to RA mass (compensatory for decreased in flow)
-- Mass: 3cm extrinsic mass compressing RA - ?etiology - chest
CT to better visualize in AM once drain is removed.
-- Pump: EF >55%
2. Respiratory: good oxygen saturations on room air; CXR - no
evidence of metastatic disease; long smoking hx - COPD - nebs
PRN
3. Renal: creatinine stable
4. GI: h/o
