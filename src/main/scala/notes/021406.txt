Service:  TRANSPLANT SURGERY

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 77-year-old
female with a past medical history significant for a
cadaveric renal transplantation performed on [**2140-11-30**]
secondary to glomerulonephritis whose postoperative course
was complicated by delayed graft functioning requiring three
weeks of hemodialysis.  The patient was recently treated at
the [**Hospital6 256**] last month for a
sputum culture which grew atypical mycobacteria.  The patient
had an additional sputum culture taken on [**2141-2-18**]
which grew Scedosporium, however, this result was not known
at the time of discharge.  The patient states that she had a
one day history of increasing dyspnea and orthopnea along
with one episode of bilious emesis before presenting to an
outside hospital the day prior to admission.  She denied any
change in urinary output, frequency, or color but does state
that she has been developing persistently increasing ankle
swelling.  The patient was admitted to this institution for a
brief period at the beginning of this month for a CHF
exacerbation.  At the outside hospital, the patient received
40 mg of IV Lasix, 1 amp of sodium bicarbonate, 1 amp of
dextrose, and 1 amp of calcium gluconate for a potassium of
6.0.  She was then transferred to this institution on 6
liters of supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula.

At the time of presentation, the patient denied fevers,
chills, abdominal pain, cough, chest pain, or palpitations.
She was admitted to this institution for the treatment of
acute CHF.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
96.5, heart rate 91, blood pressure 100/48, respiratory rate
18, oxygen saturation 95% on 6 liters.  General:  The patient
is a pleasant female who is able to speak in full sentences
and is sitting upright.  HEENT:  The oropharynx was clear
with moist mucous membranes.  The neck has JVD to
approximately 12 cm.  There were no masses or bruits.  Heart:
Regular in rate and rhythm.  Lungs:  Inspiratory crackles
bilaterally at the bases with decreased breath sounds.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, with a well-healed
scar.  Extremities:  There was 2+ pedal edema but were warm.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  WBC 12.7, hematocrit 30.3,
platelet count 251,000, potassium 6.0, creatinine 4.7.  The
urinalysis was negative.

An AP and lateral view of the chest demonstrated moderately
acute heart failure with no effusions.

An EKG demonstrated peak T waves with Q waves in the inferior
leads.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the institution
under the care of Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on the Transplant Surgery
Service.  She was treated aggressively with Lasix
intravenously for diuresis.  Her cardiac enzymes were
negative times three.  The elevated creatinine was concerning
for a problem with the transplanted kidney and a transplanted
ultrasound was, therefore, obtained.  This study was normal,
demonstrating flow in the renal artery and renal vein.  The
patient was recently seen in the [**Hospital 1326**] Clinic where a
kidney biopsy was performed on [**2141-3-19**].  At
approximately one day into her hospitalization, these results
returned as significant for mild acute cellular rejection.
She was, therefore, treated with five doses of Solu-Medrol
intravenously and then placed on a prednisone taper.  The
patient was also maintained on her tacrolimus for
immunosuppression.

Given her worsening pulmonary function at the time of
presentation and her history of pneumonia, she was seen by
the Pulmonary consult service.  On hospital day number two,
the patient had a CAT scan of the chest which demonstrated
improvement in her previously seen lesions.  A CT of the head
was obtained to rule out invasive fungal disease.  This
result was negative.

On hospital day number four, the patient had a bronchoscopy
with bronchoalveolar lavage.  This test was consistent with
Scedosporium pneumonia.  Per the recommendations of the
Infectious Disease Service, the patient was started on
voriconazole for the fungal pneumonia.  She was also
maintained on Clarithromycin, ethambutol and Rifabutin for a
total of six months to treat her atypical Mycobacterium
pneumonia.  The patient's Amiodarone was held given its
interaction with Voriconazole.  The patient's CMV viral load
was negative as was her cryptococcus antigen.

After being aggressively treated with intravenous Lasix, the
patient's creatinine diminished from 4.4 at the time of
admission to 2.5 at the time of discharge.  On hospital day
number six, the patient became acutely short of breath with
oxygen saturations in the 70% range and was immediately
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for a CHF
exacerbation.  A chest x-ray obtained at this time
demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions.  There were no EKG
changes and her cardiac enzymes were negative.  She did spend
one complete day in the Intensive Care Unit for observation
and aggressive diuresis and was returned to the floor on
hospital day number seven.

The patient remained asymptomatic throughout her stay and was
discharged to home with supplemental oxygen on hospital day
number nine.
