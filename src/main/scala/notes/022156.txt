Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Amlodipine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1943**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endoscopy
Colonoscopy
Mechanical ventillation

History of Present Illness:
88 yo F with afib on coumadin, HTN, PVD, h/o TIA and colon CA,
p/w 10 days cough, rhinorrhea, dyspnea and malaise.  She was in
her usual state of health until approx 10 days prior to
admission when she noted onset of rhinorrhea, mild
non-productive cough, and wheeze.  She lost her appetite.  Of
note, this was in the context of a known sick contact with an
infant with viral symptoms.  Cough and wheeze were progressive
until Thursday night/Friday morning prior to admission, when she
became more dyspneic.  She called PCP who prescribed albuterol
nebs and chloracetin per son (? coracidin), which she took
through the weekend with no notable improvement in respiratory
status.  Also on Thursday night/Friday morning, she noted onset
of diarrhea that persisted to admission.  She did not note any
BRBPR, hematochezia, or melena until presentation in ED when she
noted melena with some bright red blood.  She notes that she had
fevers to 101 at home, nausea, no vomiting.  Cough was
non-productive and non-bloody.  She presented to the hospital on
the morning of admission for worsening respiratory status,
dyspnea, and some visual hallucinations per her son on the night
prior to admission.

In the ED, initial vitals were: 97.8 81 153/50 RR30s 02: 95% on
RA.  Initial ABG was 7.48/36/79/28.  She received 3 neb
treatments (albuterol and ipratropium) without improvement. On
NC, went down to 88%, but returned to 95% on NRB.  She received
1 gm CTX for elevated WBC 18.5 and CT concerning for bilateral
multifocal pneumonia.  She received 2 units FFP and 10 mg IV vit
K for INR 12.5.  She received 40 mg IV pantoprazole for concern
for GI bleed.  GI was consulted and postponed gastric lavage as
INR>8.

On review of systems, pt denies CP, dysuria or other UTI sxs. No
neuro deficits. She reports nausea, no vomiting.

Of note, Pt admitted for similar presentation in [**3-17**], also in
context of contact with infant with viral symptoms, thought not
to be PNA at that time.

STUDIES:
[**2183-10-13**] CT Head - No acute intracranial process. No hemorrhage.

[**2183-10-13**] CXR - Stable prominence of the right pulmonary hilum
dating back to [**2173**].

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2183-10-14**] 5:44 PM
Since [**10-13**] the patient developed severe multifocal
pulmonary
consolidation beginning in the left posterior lung on the
[**10-13**] CTA.
There is probably a contribution of mild pulmonary edema, but
presumption
should be multifocal pneumonia due to aspiration is responsible
for most of the abnormality. Small bilateral pleural effusions
are new. Moderate
cardiomegaly with particular enlargement of the main pulmonary
arteries is chronic. ET tube in standard placement. Nasogastric
tube ends in the
stomach. No pneumothorax.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2183-10-18**] 5:19 AM
Heart is mildly enlarged. Aorta is tortuous and calcified.
Endotracheal tube has been removed. Nasogastric tube has also
been removed. There is mild congestive failure superimposed on
underlying interstitial disease. Little change since prior
study.

[**2183-10-13**] CTA Chest
1. Multifocal ill-defined areas of consolidation within the
lungs, most
compatible with multifocal pneumonia. Post-treatment followup CT
is advised to assess resolution.
2. Multiple prominent mediastinal and hilar nodes which may be
reactive.
Followup CT post-treatment is advised in this patient with
history of colon malignancy and left lower lobe resection.
3. Cardiomegaly with biatrial enlargement and evidence of mitral
annular
calcification, coronary artery disease.

EGD. [**2183-10-22**].
Small hiatal hernia
Erythema in the antrum compatible with gastritis (biopsy)
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

Colonscopy. [**2183-10-21**].
Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon
Normal appearing side to end ileo-colonic anastomosis of the
ascending colon
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to ileo-colonic anastomosis

[**2183-10-21**] GI Tissue Biopsy Pending

ECG Study Date of [**2183-10-13**]  8:18:30 PM
Atrial fibrillatio
