Transfer from [**Hospital3 628**] for infectious disease and
neurosurgical evaluation of epidural abscess with MRSA

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Multiple VAC Dressing Changes in the Operating [**Apartment Address(1) 41332**]/204: "Incision and drainage of postoperative
wound which was treated elsewhere."
[**2142-8-16**]:"Incision and drainage of the

History of Present Illness:
This is an 87 y.o. female s/p Right Hip ORIF in [**2142-2-4**]
who presented to [**Hospital3 628**] on [**2142-7-11**] after her daughter
tripped on her and she fell, sustaining a Left Hip Fracture.
She underwent a Left Hip ORIF on [**2142-7-13**].  (She was
anticoagulated with coumadin given a heparin allergy).  Her
hospital course was complicated by a temp spike to 101 on [**7-14**]
with 2/4 bottles + for MRSA.  (per her family she had been
febrile for several weeks prior).  A TEE on [**7-17**] was (-) for SBE
and a PICC line was placed for 6 weeks of vancomycin.
Surveillance cx on [**7-18**] grew [**4-8**] MRSA and the PICC line was
d/c'd.  On  [**7-24**] surveillance cultures were (-) and another PICC
line was placed.  On the same day the patient complained of back
pain and a CT T-L Spine demonstrated multiple compression
fractures and an MRI on [**7-27**] demonstrated L2-3 diskitis and a
small epidural abscess (w/o evidence of cord compression).  She
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2142-7-30**] for neurosurgical and
infectious disease evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient had a long and complicated hospital course as
follows by issue:

1) ID:(ID Service--[**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **]--following) (also see ortho
below)
She spiked a temp to 101 on [**7-14**] and blood cx drew [**2-7**] MRSA and
vancomycin was started.
[**7-16**] - repeat cx no growth
[**7-17**]- no growth, picc line placed.  TTE negative
[**7-18**] spiked temp and cultures at that time grew [**4-8**] mrsa
[**7-19**] continued to be febrile -- picc line d/c'd (picc tip cx
grew staph coag negative NOT MRSA), gent added for synergy
(duration 4 days)
abdominal CT negative for abscess
[**7-20**] TEE negative for evidence of endocarditis
[**Date range (1) 9435**] surveillence cultures negative
[**7-22**] LOST IV ACCESS therefore no IV abx for 2 days
[**2058-7-22**] -- spiked temp, surviellence cx negative
[**7-25**] PICC placed, then cx from [**7-24**] [**1-7**] MRSA
[**7-26**] pt c/o back pain, plain films negative, rifampin added, ESR
66
[**7-27**] underwent MRI L2-L3 diskitis, small epidural abcess, no
cord compression

When initially evaluated by ID the following recommendations
were made:
-Dose of vanco (begun on [**7-14**]) was changed to [**Hospital1 **] with trough
checks q72 hours
-Rifampin (begun on [**7-28**]) was continued with LFT checks qweek.


[**8-1**] and [**8-5**]: left knee was tapped with no growth
[**8-3**]: Repeat MRI with L2-3 epidural abscess without cord
compression
[**2142-8-5**]: Vanco changed to q8 hours
[**2142-8-6**]: Ortho hardware removal with Deep tissue (from hip)
Culture + for Enterobacter resistant to all organisms save
meropenem, bactrim and cefepime.  Given possibility of inducible
resistance,
Meropenem begun after desensitization in the MICU (given h/o
cefepime allergy)
[**2142-8-7**]: Spiked to 102.4 on [**8-14**].  CXR with ? LLL infiltrate
[**2142-8-16**]: Left hip hardware exchange performed with I+D.
[**2142-8-20**]: Given persistent low-grade fevers and +yeast in tissue
cx and urine, started Fluconazole on [**8-20**].

D/C Antibiotic Plan as follows:
-Vanco/Rifampin until [**2142-9-17**] for treatment of epidural abscess
and left hip, then po doxycycline 100 po BID indefinitely (given
sensitivity of MRSA and Enterobacter to doxycycline)
-Meropenem for enterobacter soft issue infectionuntil [**2142-9-27**]
-Fluconazole until [**2142-9-2**]
-LFTs, CBC and Chem-7 followed at rehab
-F/U with [**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name 9404**] in [**Hospital **] clinic in [**10-8**]

2) EPIDURAL ABCESS
    Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 1338**] (neurology) consulted. He advised medical
management, neurologically intact.
    [**8-2**]: incontinence of stool, ? decreased rectal tone
therefore repeated MRI ---> stable epidural abcess, no cord
compression

3) ORTHO: Intertrochanteric fx of Left Hip s/p orif
   ortho following (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**].
    [**8-1**]: knee tap negative for septic joint
    [**8-5**]: Ct guided aspiration of left hip -- cx ngtd
    [**8-6**]: ortho took to or and removed hardware, took cx from hip
 tissue and placed new hardware as joint unstable
     ++ Enterobacter
   [**8-10**]: increased pain in left knee, lenis negative (except
could not visualize popliteal), ortho retapped knee, cx NTD.
   [**8-12**] LENI (repeated given LLE edema) (-).
  [**8-16**] to OR to replace hardware.  Gross drainage of pus.
       ***POST-OP with SBP in 80s w/o tachycardia, bolused with
1L NS with normalization of pressure.  O2 sat remained>92% on
RA.
       Urine output was minimal but slowly picked up (to
~20-25cc/hour) with boluses and lasix (thought to be ATN)
   >>to OR [**8-20**] for sterile VAC DSG change
   >>to OR [**8-24**] for sterile VAC DSG Change
   >>to OR [**8-27**] for sterile VAC DSG Change
   >> Wound Closed with 2 JP drains placed on [**8-30**] with plans
for aggressive rehab with PWB on LLE.
   >>JP drain #2 pulled after no output x 24 hours.
   >>Per ortho recs, the remaining JP drain should be pulled
(one suture in place) after no output for 24 hours.  Patient
will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**] in 3 weeks.


4. HEPARIN ALLERGY
 -consulted allergy --> NO HEPARIN PRODUCTS.

5. SVT/ A TACH -- occasional burst of SVT in 160s w/o sx,
evaluated by EP on [**8-4**]  and recommended metoprolol. underwent
CTA (given not adequately anticoagulated -- use of coumadin and
possible surgery) but NEGATIVE for PE.

6. ATN (by muddy brown cast on [**8-8**]) and oliguria s/p surgeries
on [**8-6**] and [**8-16**] in the setting of transient hypotension.
-- at dischargee resolved with CrCL >80.

7. ?CAD
See SVT above.
EF by ECHO on [**7-8**] was 75%.

8. Anticoag: Given heparin allergy, she was placed on coumadin
with INR goal of 1.5-2.0.

9. Code Status/Goals of Care: Discussed with daughter [**Name (NI) **] (HCP)
on [**8-13**].  [**Telephone/Fax (1) 41333**].   Changed to DNR/DNI status on [**8-19**].  She
would, however, want pressors and all other aggressive measures
short of defibrillation and intubation.  She provided us with
the health care proxy form indicating that her daughter [**Name (NI) **] will
make all decisions for her should she not be able to make
decisions for herself.  She values her function and would want
all measures that would allow a reasonable chance of retaining
