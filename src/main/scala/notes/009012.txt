RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2191-4-12**] 8:38 AM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: evaluate effusion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
76 year old man s/p AVR
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate effusion
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Follow up of patient after aortic valve
replacement.

Heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged. Mediastinal
contours are unremarkable. No pneumothorax is identified. There
is no evidence of congestive heart failure.

There is unchanged loculated left pleural effusion, elevated
left hemidiaphragm and left lower lobe opacity which may
represent atelectasis.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

PORTABLE ABDOMEN

Reason: eval obstruction

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
76 year old man s/p redo sternotomy/ AVR with abd pain
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval obstruction
PORTABLE ABDOMEN SINGLE VIEW, [**2191-3-23**] AT 10:24 A.M.

HISTORY: Redo sternotomy and AVR, presenting with abdominal
pain.

COMPARISON: No prior radiographs.

FINDINGS: Single supine view demonstrates gas-filled loops of
nondilated small bowel throughout the abdomen. There is
scattered colonic air and stool as well. The rectum is not well
visualized on the submitted view. There is mild gaseous
distention of the stomach. There is suggestion of a left pleural
effusion. Preperitoneal fat stripes are not well defined and
there is mild central clumping of the bowel loops. These may be
seen in the setting of ascites.

IMPRESSION: Suggestion of possible ascites. No frankly dilated
loops of small bowel noted, although there is diffuse gaseous
distention. This may be seen in the setting of ileus. Continued
surveillance as indicated is recommended. No definitive
radiographic evidence of obstruction noted.

DIAGNOSIS:

Aortic valve tissue:
Aortic valve with degenerative changes and calcification.
Clinical: Aortic valve stenosis, aortic valve replacement, redo
sternotomy.
Gross: The specimen is received fresh labeled with the patient's
name, "[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 1726**]", the medical record number and "aortic
valve tissue". It consists of a fragment of yellow-tan and
calcified tissue measuring 3.4 x 2.5 x 1.1 cm in aggregate. The
specimen is represented in cassette A, and also submitted for
decalcification.
