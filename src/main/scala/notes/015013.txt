Service:  SICU/[**Company 191**] MEDICINE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old
male with a history of coronary artery disease status post
coronary artery bypass grafting, hypercholesterolemia, and
congestive heart failure, admitted from an outside hospital
on [**12-24**] with possible gastrointestinal bleed secondary
to sphincterotomy.

The patient was at [**Hospital3 **] between [**12-21**] and
[**12-24**] for fatigue, shortness of breath, anorexia, and
congestive heart failure.  He was noted to have a hematocrit
drop from 32 to 26 with melena.

The patient had undergone ERCP with sphincterotomy on [**12-15**] at which time a ................... bile duct stone was
removed.

Upon transfer to [**Hospital6 256**], the
patient underwent EGD with ERCP.  A vessel was found at the
papillotomy site that despite multiple injections with
epinephrine, hemostasis could not be achieved.

The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for
maximal supportive care and close monitoring of hemodynamic
and laboratory parameters.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Coronary artery disease status
post coronary artery bypass grafting (? [**2124**]).  2.
Congestive heart failure (treated with diuretics since [**2149**]).
Last known ejection fraction in [**2143**] was 50%.  3.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.  4.  Benign prostatic
hypertrophy.  5.  Hypercholesterolemia.  6.  History of
celiac screw.  7.  Status post cholecystectomy in [**2150-11-26**] complicated by retained stone in the common bile duct.
On [**12-15**], the patient underwent ERCP at [**Hospital6 1760**] with stone extraction and
sphincterotomy.  8.  Status post right hip replacement.  9.
History of atrial flutter.  10.  History of chronic
sinusitis.  11.  Hernia repair.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Protonix 40 mg IV t.i.d., Lopressor

Nitrostat 0.4 mg q.d., Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.i.d., Milk of
Magnesia p.r.n., Lasix 20 IV x 1.

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN, CHOCOLATE, NUTS, WHEAT, GLUTEN, DUST,
POLLEN.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is an ex-smoker and quit
approximately four years ago.  He lives with his wife with
whom he has been married for 46 years.  He is a retired
salesman in the oil business.  He drinks approximately one
gallon of alcohol over ten days.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  On admission temperature
was 96.3??????, pulse 131, blood pressure 100/66, respirations 22,
oxygen saturation 100% on 4 L nasal cannula.  General:  The
patient was a sleepy, elderly male, sedated following ERCP.
He was arousable and opened eyes to voice.  He was in no
apparent distress.  HEENT:  Dry mucous membranes.  Pupils
equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation.  Neck:
Jugular venous distention at 8 cm.  Cardiovascular:  Normal
S1 and S2.  Regular rhythm.  Tachycardiac.  There was a 3 out
of 6 holosystolic murmur at the left upper sternal border.
Pulmonary:  Clear to auscultation anteriorly and laterally
with poor inspiratory effort and questionable mild bibasilar
rales.  Abdomen:  He had hyperactive bowel sounds.  Soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Extremities:  No lower extremity
edema.  Warm, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.  He had
old healed vein graft scars.  The right forearm was with a
strong brachial arterial pulse and well-healed scar.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission upon transfer from the outside
hospital, hematocrit was 26.8, platelet count 128; LFTs were
elevated with an ALT of 51, AST of 97, alkaline phosphatase
281; bicarb 26, creatinine 1.9; PT 12.4, INR 1.0, PTT 31.9;
ABG on 4 L oxygen by nasal cannula revealed a pH of 7.35,
pCO2 44, pO2 110.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Gastrointestinal bleed:  The patient
was transferred from an outside hospital with a
gastrointestinal bleed and a hematocrit drop from 32 to 27.
The etiology of the gastrointestinal bleed is the bleeding
vessel found at the papillotomy site viewed via ERCP.

The patient underwent ERCP but attempts at controlling the
bleeding with epinephrine were unsuccessful.  The patient the
underwent arteriogram with gelform embolization by
Interventional Radiology which was able to control the
bleeding.  The patient required intravenous fluid
resuscitation, as well as 2 U of peripheral red blood cells.

Following arteriogram and embolization, the patient's
systolic blood pressure was in the 80s, and the patient was
intubated and started on Neo-Synephrine drip for hypotension.

The patient was extubated the following day, and his
hematocrit remained stable in the low 30s throughout the
remainder of the hospitalization.  The patient continued to
have melanotic stools; however, GI consult felt that it would
take several days to resolve given the size of the bleed.

The patient was initially started on clears, which he
tolerated well, and his diet was advanced as tolerated.

The patient remained hemodynamically stable through the
remainder of the hospitalization.

2.  Pulmonary:  The patient was intubated upon transfer to
the SICU while he was hemodynamically stabilized.  He was
extubated the following day.

Chest x-ray while intubated revealed a possible left lower
lobe infiltrate.  Sputum culture obtained at that time grew
gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters.  The patient was
treated with Vancomycin intravenous fluids empirically.

Vancomycin intravenous was stopped four days later when the
sputum sample revealed growth of bacterium most consistent
with oral flora.

A repeat chest x-ray was performed which was believed to be
most consistent with atypical congestive heart failure.  The
patient was not continued on any antibiotics since the
patient never spiked a fever nor did he develop a white blood
cell count.  The patient also denied any shortness of breath.

3.  Cardiovascular:  The patient has a history of coronary
artery disease and is status post coronary artery bypass
grafting.  The patient was slowly restarted on Metoprolol
following hemodynamic stabilization; however, both Aspirin
and Lipitor were held with plans to possibly restart these at
a later date.

Aspirin was held due to concern for recent gastrointestinal
bleed.  Lipitor was held due to the patient's elevated liver
enzymes.

DISPOSITION:  A Physical Therapy consult was obtained to
assist with disposition.  Physical Therapy felt that the
patient required rehabilitation placement prior to discharge
to home.  The patient will be discharged to [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is discharged to
rehabilitation at [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Hematocrit stable, ambulating with
assistance, hemodynamically stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Gastrointestinal bleed/blood loss anemia secondary to
bleeding at the sphincterotomy site.
2.  Status post esophagogastroduodenoscopy.
3.  Status post arteriogram with gelform embolization.
4.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass grafting.
5.  Congestive heart failure.
6.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
7.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
8.  Hypercholesterolemia.
9.  Celiac sprue
10. Atrial Flutter

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o. q.24 hours,
Tamsulosin 0.4 mg p.o. q.h.s., ............... 5 mg p.o.
q.d., Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d., Spironolactone 25 mg p.o. q.d.,
Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.

Before admission to the outside hospital, the patient was
also on Aspirin, Lipitor, and Procrit.  All of these
medications were held with the plan to possibly restart them
at a future date.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient is discharged to [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  He was
asked to follow-up with his primary care physician upon
discharge from rehabilitation.
