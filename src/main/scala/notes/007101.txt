Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 14820**]
Chief Complaint:
Tachycardia at rehabilitation facility, hypotension.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
This is an 84 year old male with PVD and recent admission for
right axillobifemoral artery bypass grafting c/b wide complex
tachycardia, systolic CHF, COPD, nonfunctional ICD; admit with
hypotension following treatment for "SVT" and concern of sepsis.
Patient was recently admitted [**2117-2-12**] - [**2117-3-5**] for gangrenous
lower extremities; workup included angiography with eventual
revascularization (axillobifemoral grafting). Course complicated
by wide complex tachycardia (SVT with aberrancy vs. Vtach)
following central line change requiring amio drip, eventually
discharged on PO amiodarone.

Patient noted at rehab to have "SVT" with HR 140s at 7:30 AM.
ECG performed and thought to be SVT by rehab (review actually
concerning for VT). Given 10 mg IV lopressor and 25 mg IV
diltiazem total. SBP 83 with HR 138 at rehab. Maintained SBPs in
80s-90s with HRs in 120s-130s throughout [**Hospital1 **] course; per
page one at least 90 minutes in this rhythm. Does note mild
dyspnea during this time, but otherwise reports being
asymptomatic (though poor historian). Denies CP, palps, cough,
abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, bleeding, HA, dizziness,
lightheadedness, lower extremity pain, change in baseline edema
(denies edema).

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, vitals T 97.9, HR 80, 91/55, R18, 94% 3L. SBP
range 81-92. Started NRB for sats in high 80s on 5L. Labs
notable for WBCs 22K with abnormal diff (though has this at
baseline), BNP 33K, troponin 0.09, lactate 2-> 0.8, ABG
7.48/35/156 on NRB. UA negative. CXR with pulm edema and
worsened effusions, otherwise unremarkable. Guaiac negative. Got
vanc/?levoflox (per verbal report only) for concern for sepsis.
1 L NS given. Vascular consulted, felt surgical wounds healing
well without evidence of infection.

Past Medical History:
- chronic systolic heart failure with EF 20%; s/p ICD placement
but currently nonfunctional [**12-21**] wire fracture
- CAD with history of large anterior MI in past
- History of Vtach and Vfib in past, managed by ICD
- Left hip fx s/p repair
- PVD, s/p recent axillobifemoral bypass
- carotid stenosis s/p bilat CEAs
- COPD

- GERD
- PUD s/p surgical repair in past
- anemia

Social History:
Previously lived with son, widower of 2 years, now in rehab.
Smoked [**11-20**] ppd up through recent hospital admission. Non-alcohol

except most proximal portion of ulceration with increased
erythema concerning for ?cellulitis. No drainage. Bilat heel
ulcers (likely pressure ulcers). R axillary and bilateral groin
incisions C/D/I with intact staples. Dopplerable DP/PT.
Back: ~5x5cm sacral decub with central eschar.

CXR [**3-6**]
AP UPRIGHT CHEST: A left pacer/AICD with leads overlying the
right atrium and ventricle is stable. Mild cardiomegaly
persists. Moderate left and small right pleural effusions are
noted. There is diffuse hazy bilateral reticular opacity with
[**Last Name (un) 16765**] A and B lines. There is no focal consolidation or
pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Moderate CHF.
.
CXR [**3-9**]
In comparison with the study of [**3-7**], there is increasing
prominence of the cardiac silhouette with evidence of pulmonary
edema and bilateral pleural effusions. The change in heart size
raises the possibility of underlying pericardial effusion.
Pacemaker leads remain in place. Retrocardiac opacification most
likely is consistent with atelectasis, though supervening
pneumonia cannot be
unequivocally excluded.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 84 year old male with history of PVD status-post
recent axillobifemoral grafting with course complicated by wide
complex tachycardia; now admitted to MICU after getting multiple
nodal agents for VT at rehab.

# Ventricular tachycardia:
The patient has had previous Ventricular Tachycardia (VT). On
this admission, he presented with a wide complex VT which is
different from his previous VT. Cardiology followed the patient
at arrival to MICU. The reason for recurrence of VT is unclear:
new ischemia, stretch from volume overload, or possibly further
disruption of pacer leads leading to more irritation of
ventricle. The patient did have an episode of asymptomatic
ventricular tachycardia on night of admission that spontaneously
aborted. He also received amiodarone 150 mg IV at time of that
ventricular tachycardic episode. He had a repeat episode of VT
on [**3-9**] in the morning. He was given amiodarone 150 mg IV x 1,
Lidocaine 75 mg IV x 2. EP converted to sinus rhythm via
patient??????s AICD. He was started on Mexiletine 150 mg [**Hospital1 **] with
plans to titrate this medication per Cardiology. He had another
episode of VT on the morning of [**3-10**] which converted with
another bolus of amiodarone 150 mg IV. He did not have any
further episodes of VT since then.
He was continued on oral amiodarone 400 mg twice daily, his
electrolytes (magnesium and potassium) were repleted
aggressively.
According to Cardiology, he is not a candidate for lead
replacement, and should be medically managed. This is also in
line with the patient and his family's wishes to avoid
aggressive care. (The patient is DNR/DNI, and moving towards
comfort care, although not at officially comfort care only). TTE
on [**3-9**] showed slightly increased EF (25-30%), slightly
decreased left ventricular cavity size and slightly worse mitral
regurg. Amiodarone dosing should be adjusted as follows:
Amiodarone 400 mg twice a day for one more week (through [**3-18**]), then 200 mg twice a day for two weeks ([**3-19**] through
[**4-1**]), then 200 mg once a day indefinitely.
.
# Hypotension:
Possible causes include sepsis / vasodilatory (given
leukocytosis and questionable appearance of gangrenous ulcers),
cardiogenic (ACS or poor forward flow from CHF; less likely
pericardial effusion), most likely med related (multiple
nodal/negative inotropic agents for tachycardia). Lactate was
not elevated. Vancomycin was discontinued after 48 hours with
continued negative culture data; he remained afebrile. His ACEI
and alpha blockers were held; he was continued on low dose beta
block given arrhythmia as BPs tolerate. Pt remained 110s-130s
systolic since transfer out of MICU on [**3-10**].
.
# Hypoxia:
He was on a non-rebreather (NRB) in the ED but easily
transitioned to nasal cannula (NC) in
