VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW

Reason: eval: swallowing

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
22 year old man with trach s/p MCC
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval: swallowing
INDICATION: 22-year-old woman with status post motor vehicle
accident, tracheostomy.

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW: Multiple swallowing attempts are
recorded under fluoroscopy, with barium with different
consistencies. Note is made of small amount of premature
spillover, with small amount of penetration at multiple
swallowing attempts. There is small amount of aspiration with
thin barium. Please also refer to the official report by speech
and language pathologist for interpretations and
recommendations.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

   RADIOLOGY   Preliminary Report

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2126-7-3**] 5:47 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: r/o aspiration

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
22 year old man with coughing, SOB
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o aspiration
INDICATION: Coughing and shortness of breath, evaluate for
aspiration.

COMPARISON: [**2126-6-27**].

TECHNIQUE: Single AP portable upright chest.

FINDINGS: A tracheostomy tube is in place with tip terminating
5.2 cm from the carina. Heart size and mediastinal contours are
normal. Since the previous examination, there has been
improvement in bibasilar opacities consistent with improving
pneumonia. A focal ovoid opacity in the right mid lung is
consistent with the patient's known pneumatocele/pulmonary
contusion at this location. The right internal jugular venous
access catheter has been removed. No pneumothorax. Feeding tube
has been removed.

IMPRESSION: 1) Improving bibasilar pulmonary opacities
consistent with improving pneumonia.

2) Increased conspicuity of patient's known pulmonary
contusion/pneumatocele, right mid lung.

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW

Reason: please evaluate for potential aspiration

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
22 year old man with
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please evaluate for potential aspiration
INDICATION: 22-year-old male with tracheostomy. Evaluate for
potential aspiration.

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW EXAMINATION: An oral and pharyngeal
swallowing video fluoroscopy study was performed in
collaboration with the speech and language pathology division.
Various consistencies of barium including thin liquid, nectar
thickened liquid, puree and a half cookie coated with barium
were administered.

FINDINGS: The oral phase was notable for mild oral residue and
slight impairment in bolus formation. There is no significant
premature spillover. The pharyngeal phase demonstrates normal
swallow initiation. Palatal elevation, laryngeal elevation and
epiglottic deflection were within functional limits. There was
moderate impairment in laryngeal valve closure. There was
intermittent trace penetration before and after the swallow with
sips of thin liquid. There were several episodes of silent
aspiration before and after the swallow with thin liquids. There
was no spontaneous cough, and a cued cough did not clear the
airway.

IMPRESSION: Mild oropharyngeal dysphagia with penetration and
episodes of silent aspiration.

For greater detail and for treatment recommendations, please see
the dedicated speech and language pathology division report of
the same date.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

   RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2126-6-27**] 5:33 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: evaluate infiltrates/effusion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
22 year old man s/p motorcycle crash w/ pulmonary contusions,
intubated. Worsening infiltrates/effusion
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate infiltrates/effusion
INDICATION: Motorcycle crash with pulmonary contusions,
intubated.

COMPARISON: [**2126-6-26**].

SEMI-UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Endotracheal tube, feeding
tube, and right internal jugular central venous catheter remain
in standard positions. Marked interval improvement in right
basilar opacity likely reflects a combination of decreasing
small right pleural effusion and atelectasis. Residual
heterogeneous opacities within both lung bases are likely due to
superimposed infection and possibly residual contusion. Small
left pleural effusion is unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.
Heart is normal size. Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
Pulmonary vascularity is normal.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
