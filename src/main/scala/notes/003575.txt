Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the transplant service where a CT showed a
cirrhotic liver, splenomegaly, a diffusely thickened colon,
small amount of ascites.  He was started on broad spectrum
antibiotics.  Serial exams revealed worsening abd pain and pt
had ? of a perforated diverticulum and free air on imaging, so
pt was taken to the OR where diffuse pan colitis free air and
colonic diverticulosis was found.  An expolatory laporotomy,
left hemicolectomy, and transverse colostomy was performed.
Post operatively, the pt was taken to the SICU where he remained
intubated until POD 8.  His operatively placed drains had output
of over 1500cc/day, and although he was transferred to the floor
on POD 9, he had to be sent back to the ICU on POD 14 in order
to float a swan and better manage his volume status.  He stayed
in the ICU until POD 16 when his outputs had tapered.  He was
transferred to the floor where his drains were removed and
stiches were placed to close the JP site.  Pt remained stable
and was dischared to rehab on post op day 21.
