Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2166-2-12**] - Mitral Valve Replacement (27mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Mechanical
Valve)

History of Present Illness:
62 year old female with hypertension and hyperlipidemia,
congestive heart failure, DM who had an NSTEMI in [**2163**], now with
increasing shortness of breath. The patient was seen on [**12-3**] [**2165**] with complaints of right-sided chest pain. A chest
x-ray revealed right middle lobe pneumonia. On [**12-4**]
patient had an echocardiogram which revealed evidence of
moderate to severe mitral stenosis with a peak gradient of 32.0
mmHg. Patient states she has been very short of breath with
exertion for the past couple of months. Upon lying down to go to
bed she will experience shortness of breath and keeps a fan by
her bed to help her breath. She has a hospital bed and sleeps
with her HOB raised or will sleep on a chair. She has been
feeling palpitations or what she thinks are skipped beats and
constant fatigue and takes multiple naps on a daily
basis. She is referred for surgical consultation.

Pertinent Results:
[**2166-2-12**] ECHO: Prebypass: The left atrium is dilated. No
mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. There
is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 50 %).
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed
(LVEF= 50 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Moderate (2+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. The mitral valve shows characteristic
rheumatic deformity. There is moderate valvular mitral stenosis
(area 1.0-1.5cm2). Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was
notified in person of the results on [**2166-2-12**] at 1000am.
Post bypass: Patient is A paced and receiving an infusion of
phenylephrine. Biventricular systolic function is unchanged.
Mechanical valve seen in the mitral position. It appears to be
well seated and the leaflets move well. Washing jets typical for
this type of valve seen. 2+ aortic insufficiency persists. Aorta
is intact post decannulation.
Poor transgastric views throughout the case.

[**2166-2-20**] CXR: Compared to the prior study, the size of the right
pleural effusion has decreased. There are bands of linear
density at the base of the right lung consistent with
atelectasis. Left lung is grossly clear. Heart and mediastinum
are not enlarged.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 33799**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2166-2-11**] for surgical
management of her mitral valve disease. She was taken to the
operating room where she underwent a mitral valve replacement
using a 27mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Mechanical valve. Cardiopulmonary Bypass
time= 80 minutes. Cross Clamp time= 63 minutes. Please see
operative note for details. She tolerated the procedure well and
was taken to the intensive care unit for monitoring. She later
awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without
difficulty. All lines and drains were discontinued in a timely
fashion. Beta-blocker/Statin/Aspirin and diuresis were
initiated.  On postoperative day one, she was transferred to the
step down unit for further monitoring. Anticoagulation with
Coumadin was started for her mechanical mitral valve. She was
maintained on a Heparin drip until she was therapeutic on
Coumadin.

 She will be followed for Coumadin dosing by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
first INR draw will be Monday [**2-24**] with INR goal 2.5-3.5 for
mechanical mitral valve.  She was gently diuresed towards her
preoperative weight. The physical therapy service was consulted
for evaluation of  her postoperative strength and mobility. The
remainder of her postoperative course was essentially
uneventful. She continued to progress and on POD #11 she was
discharged to home. All f/u visits were advised.
