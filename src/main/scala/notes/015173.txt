History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 55yo M w/ PMH of GERD and psoriasis who developed
intermittent CP one week ago. Described it as a burning
sensation that he thought was heartburn and states that these
episodes occurred intermittently, but would last up to 30 mins
at a time. He was awoken from sleep at 3:30 this AM with a
burning sensation in his chest. He went downstairs, took a Tums,
and sat up in a chair to see if it resolved. He only had minor
improvement in his sx, but went to work anyways. He called his
PCP who gave him a script for zantac. He took zantac x1 w/ no
improvement in sx, so he returned from work and rested. Noted
that when he got up from his chair this afternoon, that he felt
SOB which is unusual for him. Denies dizziness, LH, HA, nausea,
vomiting. Pain was [**9-2**] and radiated from chest through to his
back, but never up to his jaw or down his arm. When his wife
returned from work at 4:30pm, he tried to have something to eat
thinking it would help his GERD but he had no improvement in his
sx so he and his wife decided to go to the ER.
.
Went to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital ER where VS on arrival were BP
184/123, HR 146, RR12, O2 sats of 100% RA. EKG originally showed
SVT w/ aberrancy and RBBB which then broke revealing widened
QRS, RBBB, and ST depressions in V3-V6, and then he developed
worsening chest pain which was associated with a wide complex
QRS with >2mm STE in II, III, avF and ST depressions in I, avL,
V1-V4. Portable CXR was reportedly negative for any acute
cardiopulmonary process. Initial labs revealed WBC 9.6, Hct
48.6, Plt 304, K 3.6, Cr 1.1, glu 189, TSH 1.49, Ca 9.5, Mg 1.8,
Phos 2.7, INR 1.1, CK 1084, trop I 10.4. In the ER, he was given
ASA 325, SL ntg x3, lopressor IV + PO, morphine, and plavix 600.
He was placed on O2, started on heparin and aggrestat, and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent cardiac cath.
.
In cath lab, was found to have normal LMCA, 60% mid LAD, 30%
prox LAD, 50% diag, chronic TO prox LCx, occluded mid-RCA ->
stented w/ DES x2 with 0% residual stenosis, and 70% stenosis
PDA. IABP was inserted for elevated filling pressures and low
cardiac index. Dopa gtt was started for hypotension and
aggrestat was continued. He was then transferred to the floor
for further monitoring.

Imaging:
CATH [**2190-3-13**] (COMMENTS):
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant
circulation
demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA was
without flow limiting disease. The LAD had a 30% proximal
stenosis and a 60%
mid segment stenosis. The D1 was a relatively small vessel, but
the [**Name (NI) **] was a moderate size vessel with a 50% proximal stenosis.
The LCx had a proximal total occlussion. The RCA had a mid
segment total occlusion after an acute marginal branch. There
were collaterals from the LAD supplying the LCx territory.
2. Resting hemodynamics from right heart catheterization
demonstrated
moderately elevated right sided filling pressures and severely
elevated left sided filling pressures (RVEDP 20mmHg; mean PCWP
26mmHg). There was mild pulmonary arterial hypertension. The
calculated cardiac output by the Fick method was 3.5 L/min with
a cardiac index of 1.6.
3. Throughout the procedure, the patient had episodes of atrial
flutter and atrial fibrillation at moderate ventricular response
require IV amiodarone therapy.
4. Successful PCI of the RCA w/2 overlapping 3.5 x 33 mm Cypher
DES.
5. Successful placement of an 8 French 40 cc IABP via the right
femoral artery access site.
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Cardiogenic shock.
3. Acute inferoposterior myocardial infarction, managed by acute
PCI of the RCA.
4. Successful placement of an IABP.
.
ECHO [**2190-3-13**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defe
ct is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Resting
regional wall motion abnormalities include akinesis of the
inferior a
nd infero-lateral walls including the basal infero-septum. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic
function appears depressed with akinesis of the inferior RV free
wall. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
.
IMPRESSION: Moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction c/w an
extensive inferior myocardial infarction. The inferior RV free
wall is akinetic suggesting RV involvement. The IVC is dilated,
sugges
[**Doctor Last Name **] elevated right sided filling pressures.

CXR [**2190-3-13**]:
1. Intra-aortic balloon pump tip within 1 cm of the top of the
aortic knob. Withdrawal by approximately 1 cm may be helpful for
more optimal placement. 2. Slight improvement in the
asymmetrical pulmonary edema pattern.
