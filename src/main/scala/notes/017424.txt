History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 35 y.o. African-American woman with multiple medical
problems (see below) with multiple past hospitalizations who
presents from an OSH.  Pt initially presented to OSH on [**2204-8-13**]
with DKA and complaints of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
 On the way to hospital pt ran over a pedestrian who also
required hospitalization.  Pt was admitted to MICU, where she
was treated with IV insulin, and her symptoms resolved
completely.  She was then transferred back to floor, however
again was noncompliant with her diet and again developed
hyperglycemia with BS in 500s requiring transfer back to MICU.
At this time, she was found to be bacteremic with MRSA which was
believed to be from her hemodialysis line which was removed and
pt was started on vancomycin 1gm q48hrs.  The date of vancomycin
start not entirely clear, but pt had temporal femoral
triple-lumen line place on [**8-23**].  Pt had ongoing hemodialysis
with her last dialysis being [**8-27**] at OSH.  Patient's symptoms
resolved and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for a mandatory
admission while guardianship is established as pt was determined
to be a threat to others.  At present patient states she feels
basically at her baseline.  She has some mild baseline
epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting have resolved.  Pt states
she recently has had some low grade fevers to about 101.  She
has some diarrhea which is normal for her.  She has a slight
cough, unchanged from baseline, and non-productive.  She denies
any chest pain or shortness of breath.  She denies any dysuria
or urinary frequency.  She has chronic leg ulcers and she has
some chronic pain and itchyness associated with these.  Pt
denies any changes in apettite or sleep cycle.

Past Medical History:
1) DM1 - diagnosed initially in [**2174**]. Patient has had multiple
admissions for DKA and hypoglycemia, practically monthly.
Volatile blood sugars complicated by infections w/ recurrent
pyelonephritis, chronic diarrhea, severe gastroparesis, high and
low sugars. Poor blood sugar control has resulted in severe
diabetic neuropathy and diabetic retinopathy.
2) Gastroparesis and chronic nausea - as above [**1-4**] DM
3) ESRD - Has been on peritoneal dialysis 5x/week for
approximately past year. Patient has, in past, refused
hemodialysis. Has agreed and been started on HD during current
admission. Baseline Cr unknown as patient has had such frequent
admissions for DM1 (as above) and acute worsening of [**Month/Day (2) **]
failure due to inaccurate PD at home.
4) Seizure disorder - worked up in past by neurology. Thought to
be toxic-metabolic in nature and secondary to patient's
endocrine status (brought on by hyper or hypoglycemia)
5) Anemia - [**1-4**] ESRD. Now on procrit with HD.
6) HTN
7) Asthma
8) Chronic skin breakdown - secondary to DM1 and poor healing
due to poor vascularity. Also [**1-4**] patient scratching [**1-4**] itching
from uremia. Particularly on lower extremities bilaterally.
9) Chronic diarrhea, also with stool incontinence since removal
of absces in [**2194**]
10) Recurrent pyelonephritis
11) History of peritonitis [**1-4**] infection from peritoneal
dialysis
12) History of subdural hematoma
13) History of esophagitis/gastritis: admitted for hematemesis
in [**9-4**] - EGD revealed Grade IV esophagitis, bleeding in distal
esophagus, erythema in stomach body and fundus (consistent with
gastritis)
14) Cardiac function - last [**Date Range **] in [**6-5**] demonstrated dilated
left atrium, moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy,
normal EF = 60-70%, no wall motion abnormalities

Social History:
The patient had lived [**Location 6409**] when she was admitted, but
was evicted from this residency (court ordered, prior to her
hospitalization) and was going to stay with her mother in
[**Name (NI) **] after the hospitalization. Her PCP was [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who
completed his residency and has passed along his patients to Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 915**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29958**], who has yet to meet [**Known firstname 3608**]. Per his OMR note, her
children have recently been taken by DSS. She has a long history
of medical noncompliance. She previously noted that she smokes 2
packs of cigarettes every 5 days but says that she is smoking
less now (approximately 4 pk yr history). She denies use of
alcohol or illicit drugs. Had been in abusive home relationship
but denies current abuse.

Groin: femoral triple lumen in place, no erythema or fluctuence

Pertinent Results:
CT Chest ([**2204-10-18**]):
1. Enlarged axillary lymph nodes and retroperitoneal lymph nodes
and hepatosplenomegaly, suggestive of a lymphoid disorder.
2. No discrete fluid collections are present in the left chest
wall, although evaluation is slightly limited on this non-
contrast study.
3. No pneumonia.
4. Two lower lobe pulmonary nodules. Follow-up chest CT as an
outpatient after treatment is recommended to confirm resolution.
5. Oral contrast and food debris within the esophagus. This may
be due to gastroparesis and clinical correlation is recommended.
.
CT Abdomen & pelvis ([**2204-10-10**]):
1. No evidence of fluid collections, or abnormal inflammatory
changes within groins or suprapubic territory.
2. Patchy consolidation within the left lung base concerning for
pneumonia.
3. Ground-glass opacities within bilateral lung bases,
concerning for fluid overload.
4. Anasarca.
5. Interval removal of periumbilical peritoneal dialysis
catheter with decrease in abdominal ascites.
6. Coronary artery calcifications and atherosclerotic disease.
7. Stable prominent retroperitoneal and inguinal lymph nodes.
.
Bone and soft tissue, left heel ([**2204-10-15**]):
A. Bone:  Bone with active osteomyelitis, osteonecrosis and
granulation tissue.
B. Soft tissue: Skin and soft tissue with extensive necrosis and
gram (+) bacteria on Brown and Brenn stain; special stains for
acid-fast bacilli and fungi are negative for organisms with
satisfactory controls.
