History of Present Illness:
84yo RH M who was admitted to neurosurgical service in [**2-6**]
after posterior fossa subdural hematoma, evacuated by
suboccipital crani, course complicated by PNA, CSF leak (no
intervention) and dysphagia/aspiration requiring PEG, who has
been in rehab since. On [**3-21**], he was febrile to 100.4 and
started
on vanco/levaquin for UTI (pseudomonas). His son reports that he

has been unable to walk since [**Month (only) 956**] and sundowns nightly. He
has noted no new deficits.

Two days ago, however, in the absence of trauma or HTN, the
patient reported new onset headache that was bifrontal and
throbbing. It has not woken him from sleep. He denies diplopia
or
new deficits. He does not recall how quickly it came on.

Today, he was noted in rehab to be more "confused" and had
copious amount of clear drainage on his pillow. He was sent here

for ? CSF leak. Head CT showed "Acute parenchymal hemorrhage
right frontal cortex, measuring 18x13mm, with mass effect on
anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of right lateral ventricle and overlying sulci.
No fracture. No midline shift."

Pertinent Results:
Admition:
IMPRESSION:
1. New right inferior frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage
measuring up to 18 mm, with surrounding edema and mild mass
effect.
2. Interval increase in fluid collection adjacent to the
sub-occipital
craniotomy site, likely tracking to the skin surface, although
incompletely imaged. Fluid collection has the same attenuation
as the posterior fossa CSF and is suspicious for a CSF leak.
Alternatively, this could represent a postoperative seroma.
3. No change in size of ventricles.

Brief Hospital Course:
Two days prior to admition, in the absence of trauma or HTN, the
patient reported new onset headache that was bifrontal and
throbbing. It has not woken him from sleep. He denies diplopia
or
new deficits. He does not recall how quickly it came on.
He was noted in rehab to be more "confused" and had
copious amount of clear drainage on his pillow. He was brought
to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation. On primary eval it was discovered that
he also had a He was sent here head CT showed "Acute parenchymal
hemorrhage
right frontal cortex, measuring 18x13mm, with mass effect on
anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of right lateral ventricle and overlying sulci.
No fracture. No midline shift."  Also noted was clear drainage
from his previous posterior fossa craniotomy drainage,
presumably CSF.

An LP was performed to evaluate whether the patient had any
signs of meningitis prior to placing a VP shunt for
hydrocephalus. The cell count of the tap was questionable for
meningitis with no growth on gram stain. Infectious disease was
consulted and the patient was placed on broad spectrum coverage
to treat meningitis which completed on [**4-2**].

With continued leaking from the posterior fossa, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
aspirated fluid from the area of the CSF leak, which was sent
for cultures as well, and a lumbar drain was placed for a period
of five days to divert CSF flow and allow for wound closure. CSF
leak  from the posterior incision stopped.

Patients mental status declined over the course of his ICU stay
to the point where he no longer opened his eyes to voice and was
not following commands. A CT of the head did not reveal any new
area of hemorrhage or stroke.

Pt. was started on a heparin drip for anticoagulation for his
mechanical heart valve during his ICU stay.

On [**3-30**] lumbar drain was discontinued. Geriatrics was consulted
to review causes for the altered mental status. In depth
conversation with the patient's power of attorney, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known lastname **],
led us to make change the patient's code status to DNR/DNI.

Antibiotics continued through [**4-2**] for full coverage of
meningitis.  He was transitioned to coumadin.

Plan is to continue with anticoagulation and home meds and
observe the patient's mental status off antibiotics to see if
there is an improvement  in mentation. Palliative medicine is
involved at this time with the care of this patient

Mr [**Known lastname **] began to slowly wake up over 4-5 days prior to
discharge, we are unsure if this is related to stopping
medications. Prior to discharge he was orientated to name, year,
antigravity in all extremities and followed commands and
answered questions.
