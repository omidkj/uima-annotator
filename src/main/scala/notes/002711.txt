and a recent ICU admit x 2 for MRSA aortic valve endocarditis
and pseudomonal sepsis (secondary to wound infection), status

[**2122-10-31**] with lethargy, weakness, and low grade temps over one
day. Initially, she was found to be hypotensive to systolic
80's/60's in ED with temp 100.3 (baseline SBP 70-90s), wbc 11,
and there was concern in the ED given her history for early
sepsis. Patient initially admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. She was placed on a

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was initially admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. She was placed
on a dopamine drip for hypotension, vancomycin 1gm IV Q24 x 1
day (last dose 9-27), ceftazidime 2 gm IV Q12 x 1 day (last dose
[**11-2**]), azithromycin 250 mg, 500 mg x 1 day (Dc'd [**11-4**]) and
Flagyl 500 mg PO. She was transferred out to the floor on [**11-5**].

1. C. Diff: patient intially started with broad antibiotic
coverage with ceftaz, vanco, flagyl and azithromycin given
history. There was initial concern for recurrent pseudomonal
sepsis vs MRSA vs c diff. The patient's only complaints were
weakness and diarrhea and intermittent RLE pain. Lactate level
was 1.2. Blood and urine cultures were negative.  Cortisol level
was normal. C diff was positive and antibiotics were tailored to
Flagyl for 1 month. She was discharged on day 7 of flagyl and
had persistent diarrhea while on flagyl in the hospital. It was
deemed that if her diarrhea persists at [**Location (un) 550**], the issue may be
readdressed in 1 week as to whether vancomycin should be
started.

2. Hypotension: Patient presented with mild hypotension with a
tenuous BP history. Dopamine low dose was instituted in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
originally while all of her blood pressure  meds were held.  Her
BP was stabilized, her initial low BP was exacerbated by
diarrhea and CHF. Of note, she has a history of low SBP 70-90s
at baseline.

3. Diastolic dysfunction: The patient presented with pedal
edema, after BP stabilized, the patient was subsequently
diuresed. Lasix, beta-blocker, ace initially were held but
restarted once her BP stabilized. A delicate balance is needed
as she has a history of tenuous volume status.

4. Acute on chronic renal failure: Her creatinine was mildly
above her baseline on presentation. The differential included
hypovolemia/hypotension vs baseline deterioration. Received
fluid boluses in ED but the plan was to hold off on further
boluses unless necessary. Her medications were renally dosed.
Her creatinine improved to 1.3 off of IVF and on her standing
dose of lasix.

5. DM: On home dose glargine w/ Sliding scale. Blood sugars
labile but well-controlled on day of discharge. She should
continue with the glargine at night.

6. CAD: Patient ruled out by enzymes. Pateint's beta blocker,
ace and nitrates were held until her blood pressure stabilized.
She was maintained on her statin and aspirin.

7. Atrial fibrillation: Patient's coumadin was initially held in
case of possible procedure. Her INR was checked daily and her
coumadin dosed appropriately. However, she was given coumadin
2.5 mg QHS on [**2122-11-4**]. However, throughout her stay, her INR
rose to over 4 and thus, her coumadin was held. Her goal INR
being [**3-10**]. [**Last Name (un) 7965**] is her cardiologist and per report, she
has been refractory to cardioversion in the past.

8. Hypothyroid: She was maintained on synthroid 225 mcg PO QD
with a TSH in normal range.

9. Pain control: Patient with a history of chronic pain that is
unchanged (especially bilateral lower extremities). On renally
dosed neurontin and oxycodone, slightly lower than home doses.
Her pain was well-controlled on this regimen.

10. Hypercarbia/COPD: She had a pco2 of 50 on admission which
improved to 47. She is normally on home oxygen of 2L. She
remained stable throughout the remainder of her hospital stay.

11. Anemia: She has a history of chronic anemia. She remained on
procrit, iron. GUAIAC was positive in ED but patient is on iron.
On ppi. Had coloscopy, EGD in [**2119**] which were negative.

12. Cough: The patient developed a purulent cough with
yellow-greenish phlegm. A chest xray was performed on the day of
discharge to assess for pneumonia. Her O2 sats remained stable.
CXR did not show any infiltrate or worsening pulmonary edema but
rather interval improvement.

13. code: FULL

14. communication: patient. Has daughter/son who are
intermittently involved in her care.

15. After a team meeting, the patient agreed to be discharged to
[**Hospital3 **] facility after PT evaluation and concern
by all participating health care providers that she is unable to
take care of herself at home.
