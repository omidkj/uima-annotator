History of Present Illness:
This is a 54 yo F with h/o STEMI [**1-8**], DM type 2, HTN,
headaches, and depression who presents with fevers, cough,
headache, and n/v/d. Pt was feeling in USOH until this past
Tuesday when she began to develop worsening of her usual
headaches, subjective fevers, dry cough, and shortness of
breath. She also began to feel nauseous, vomited several times a
day, and has been unable to take her medications or tolerate
pos. Symptoms progressed to include diffuse myalgias, neck pain,
some photophobia, fevers to 101, chills, diffuse abdominal pain
but worse in the epigastric area, and diarrhea with 1 episode
associated with blood after wiping with toilet paper. She has
also had worsening temporal-occipital headaches not associated
with chest pain or focal numbness or weakness. Denies recent
travel. Has had contact with her grandson who recently had a
"cold." She saw her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**5-10**] and was reportedly ruled out for
influenza, told her she likely had a "viral infection," and
recommended taking tylenol. However, she progressively felt
worse and went to the ED for evaluation this am.
.
In the ED, Tm 99.7, BP 132/75, HR 91, RR 18-22, O2 sat initially
mid 83 on RA and up to 96% 3L NC. Labs significant for WBC 4.9,
BUN 36, Cr 1.8, HCO3 19 with AG 18, AST 51, ALT 62, lactate 1.4.
CXR with multi-focal PNA predominanatly in the bases. Due to
diffuse abdominal tenderness on exam, CT abd/pelvis obtained
that was negative for acute intrabdominal processes. Given
levofloxacin that resulted in hives, requiring benadryl. Then
given vancomycin, ceftazidime, azithromycin, tylenol, 3L IVFs,
60 mEQ KCl and admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further care.
.
ROS as above. Currently, she is in [**9-8**] pain and mostly
complains of her headache, which she describes as the worst
headache of her life. She reports she was taking an unknown
antibiotic for 1 week approximately 2 weeks ago for an oral
infection after a tooth was pulled.

RADIOLOGY:
CT Head [**5-13**]: IMPRESSION: Normal study
.
CT A/P [**5-13**]:
1. No acute intra-abdominal process identified. No evidence for
colitis.
2. Multifocal airspace consolidation partially imaged,
concerning for
multifocal pneumonia.
3. Fatty liver.
.
CXR [**2170-5-13**]: Multifocal airspace consolidations, most
compatible with
multifocal pneumonia. Conversley, this may represent principally
a left lower lobe pneumonia with scattered atelectasis
elsewhere. Follow up after therapy recommended to document
resolution.
.
[**5-20**] UPPER EXTREMITY US
No evidence of upper extremity DVT.
Please note that ultrasound cannot assess for more central
venous narrowing
such as SVC syndrome.
.
US LIVER/GALLBLADDER [**5-23**]
1) Apparent surgical absence of the gallbladder. Please refer to
CT torso
performed on the same day.

2) Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration. Other
forms of liver
disease and more advanced liver disease including significant
hepatic
fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.
.
CT Chest [**5-23**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Multifocal bilateral airspace opacities with air bronchograms
consistent
with patient's known diagnosis of multifocal pneumonia. There
are no pleural
effusions. There is no pneumothorax.
2. No abnormal collections in the abdomen or pelvis to suggest
additional
sites of infection.
3. Air in the nondependent portion of the bladder likely due to
Foley
instrumentation.
4. Tip of left-sided central line terminates at the
SVC/brachiocephalic
junction and should be advanced further for optimal positioning.

5. Minimal dilation of the CBD in a patient status post
cholecystectomy.
6. Unchanged dystrophic calcifications in the liver.
.
CT ABD/PELVIS [**5-23**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Multifocal bilateral airspace opacities with air bronchograms
consistent
with patient's known diagnosis of multifocal pneumonia. There
are no pleural
effusions. There is no pneumothorax.
2. No abnormal collections in the abdomen or pelvis to suggest
additional
sites of infection.
3. Air in the nondependent portion of the bladder likely due to
Foley
instrumentation.
4. Tip of left-sided central line terminates at the
SVC/brachiocephalic
junction and should be advanced further for optimal positioning.

5. Minimal dilation of the CBD in a patient status post
cholecystectomy.
6. Unchanged dystrophic calcifications in the liver.
.
[**5-23**] CT SINUS
1. Pan-sinus mucosal disease, with hyperdense inspissated as
well as
aerosolized secretions. There are also extensive retained
secretions in the
posterior nasopharynx. T
