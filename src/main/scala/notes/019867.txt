IMAGING:
[**2118-9-30**] CT abdomen/ pelvis
1. Nondistended gallbladder with mild gallbladder wall
thickening. If acute cholecystitis is a clinical concern, then a
HIDA scan may be obtained for further evaluation. An US is
unlikely to add additional infomration (above excluding
gallstones altogether.) Discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 33038**] at
approximately 5:30 pm day of study.
2. Fluid-filled large and small bowel loops consistent with
diarrhea and
likely represent gastroenteritis.

[**2118-9-30**] US gallbladder
Findings as described above are equivocal for acute
cholecystitis. If further imaging confirmation is required, a
HIDA scan is recommended for evaluation.

[**2118-9-30**] HIDA
No activity within the gallbladder, concerning for acute
cholecystitis. Of note, the patient has not eaten for 48 hours,
making this finding less specific.

[**2118-10-1**] CT head
Subtle focal hypodensity in the left cerebellar hemisphere is
likely
artifactual; attention on next follow-up study, if of clinical
concern.

[**2118-10-1**] CT abdomen/pelvis
1. No findings of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
2. Endotracheal tube terminates just proximal to the carina and
repositioning is recommended. Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis
with slightly heterogeneous enhacement which may suggest a
component of superimposed pneumonia. Trace bilateral pleural
effusions.
3. Fatty infiltration of the liver. Small fluid collection in
the
gallbladder fossa with mild enhancement noted which may reflect
some residual gallbladder mucosa given the difficult operation
per review of operative history.

[**2118-10-1**] CT chest
1. No findings of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
2. Endotracheal tube terminates just proximal to the carina and
repositioning is recommended. Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis
with slightly heterogeneous enhacement which may suggest a
component of superimposed pneumonia. Trace bilateral pleural
effusions.
3. Fatty infiltration of the liver. Small fluid collection in
the
gallbladder fossa with mild enhancement noted which may reflect

         Isolate was found to be susceptible to nalidixic acid.
Naladixic
         acid results should be considered along with
fluoroquinolone
         susceptibility results when assessing the
appropriateness of
         fluoroquinolone therapy.

SENSITIVITIES.
         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.
