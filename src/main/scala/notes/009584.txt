HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known firstname 4014**] [**Known lastname 42575**] is an
88-year-old woman with a history of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure as well as
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who presented from her nursing
home with acute respiratory distress.

Per nursing home report, the patient was in her usual state
of health until the night prior to admission when she was
noted to be short of breath and to be hypoxic with unknown
room air saturation.  She was also noted to be "congested"
and placed on 3 liters of nasal cannula with an oxygen
saturation of 92%.

The following morning, a chest x-ray showed moderate
congestive heart failure (per their report).  As well, her
oxygen saturation was 74% on room air with a heart rate of
118 and modeled extremities.  The patient was sent to the
[**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Department for
evaluation.  She had a white count of 17 at the nursing home.
She denied cough, fever, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, or increased lower extremity edema.

En route to the Emergency Department, the patient had an
oxygen saturation was of 84% on room air and 100% on a
nonrebreather.  She was given 40 mg of intravenous Lasix en
route to the hospital, and her oxygen saturation improved to
96% on 100% nonrebreather.

On arrival, the patient was lethargic but alert and oriented.
Her blood pressure was 154/88, her heart rate was 118 (in
atrial fibrillation), her respiratory rate was 24, and her
oxygen saturation was 94%.  Arterial blood gas at that time
showed a pH of 7.47, a PCO2 of 35, and a PO2 of 83 on 100%
nonrebreather.  A chest x-ray showed mild pulmonary
congestion and small bilateral effusions with a question of
retrocardiac infiltrate.  The patient received 1 gram of
intravenous ceftriaxone, 500 mg of azithromycin, and 40 mg of
intravenous Lasix, as well as nebulizer treatment.  She was
also tried on a trial of [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure
with improvement in her oxygen saturations and her
ventilation.  After a short trial, she was again placed on
100% nonrebreather and once again became tachypneic and
hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 88% to 93%.  She was
again placed on [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure with a
decrease in her blood pressure to 60 to 80 systolic.  She was
started on Levophed to maintain her blood pressure at that
time.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a resident of [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **]
nursing home.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history was deferred.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature was 99.1
degrees Fahrenheit, her blood pressure was 112/68, her heart
rate was 118 (in atrial fibrillation), and her oxygen
saturation was 92% on 100% nonrebreather, and her respiratory
rate was 32.  In general, alert and oriented times three.  In
moderate respiratory distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and
throat examination revealed arcus senilis.  The pupils were
equal, round, and reactive to light.  The extraocular
movements were intact.  The sclerae were anicteric.  The
mucous membranes were dry.  The neck was supple.  There was
no lymphadenopathy.  Pulmonary examination revealed decreased
air movement throughout with scattered expiratory wheeze and
bronchial breath sounds at the left base.  Decreased breath
sounds at the right base.  Cardiovascular examination
revealed an irregularly irregular.  Distant heart sounds.
There were no murmurs.  The abdomen was distended and
tympanitic.  The abdomen was soft and nontender with
decreased bowel sounds.  There was no hepatosplenomegaly.
There was no guarding.  Rectal examination revealed no stool
in the vault.  There was no blood.  Extremity examination
revealed 1+ lower extremity nonpitting edema.  Extremities
were modeled.  Neurologic examination revealed the patient
was alert and oriented to name, place, and year.  She
followed commands.  Motor was 5-/5 in the upper extremity and
right lower extremity.  There was minimal movement of the
left upper extremity and left lower extremity.  Sensation was
grossly intact.  Cranial nerves II through XII were intact.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Admission
laboratories were significant for a white blood cell count of
21.3 (with 90 neutrophils, 4 lymphocytes, and no bands), her
hematocrit was 32.9, and her platelets were 127.  Her
creatinine was 1.2.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray per History of
Present Illness.

An electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation at a rate of
106.  No ST-T wave changes acutely.  T wave inversions in V3
to V6; unchanged from prior electrocardiogram.

A KUB showed multiple dilated loops of bowel.

IMPRESSION:  Initial impression revealed an 88-year-old woman
with a history of congestive heart failure, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, and paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation who presented with hypoxic respiratory failure.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient did well
after transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Pressors
were able to be quickly weaned after some intravenous fluids
were given back.  She was again weaned from [**Hospital1 **]-level positive
airway pressure and able to be maintained on nasal cannula
and shovel mask for oxygenation.

The initial impression was that her respiratory failure was
due primarily to congestive heart failure, but on further
review of her studies her right-sided effusion was noted to
be potentially representative of a parapneumonic effusion.  A
thoracentesis was done on the third hospital day with the
study consistent with exudate; thought to be due to a
parapneumonic effusion.  Her antibiotic coverage was
continued.  In addition, she was started on diltiazem for
rate control of her rapid atrial fibrillation.

In addition, while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the
patient decided to reverse her code status from do not
resuscitate/do not intubate to full code.  The patient was
thought to be sufficiently competent to make this decision.

She was called out to the floor on [**3-4**] with plans to
discharge back to the nursing home with continued oxygen
therapy and intravenous antibiotics at the nursing home in
the morning.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient to be discharged to
nursing home.
