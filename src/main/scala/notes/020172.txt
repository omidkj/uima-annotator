Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the trauma service and transferred to the
Trauma ICU where he remained sedated and vented. Neurosurgery
was consulted; his head CT scan revealed  multiple bilateral
scattered punctate hemorrhagic foci with pattern compatible with
diffuse axonal injury. Serial exams and head CT scans were
followed closely, his head CT scans remained stable with no new
areas of bleeding. His sedation was eventually weaned and he was
extubated. His mental status was intermittently agitated and
disoriented. He required antipsychotic to manage his behaviors.

He was taken to the operating room by Orthopedics for closed
treatment right femoral shaft fracture with traction and
placement of traction pin and again taken back on [**3-4**] for
intramedullary nail of the right femur.

Psychiatry and Cognitive Neurology were consulted once patient
was transferred to the regular nursing unit. Adjustments to his
antipsychotic were made; he was also started on Depakote as a
mood stabilizer.

He was followed by Physical and Occupational therapy who worked
closely with him given that he was not able to go to a rehab
facility due to lack of insurance. The Masshealth application
process was initiated.

At time of discharge his mental status had improved
significantly although he did continued short term memory
problems. [**Name (NI) **] will follow up with Cognitive Neurology as an
outpatient.

Bifrontal diffuse axonal injury
Right clavicle fracture
Right distal femur fracture
Bilateral 1st rib fracture



Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

Discharge Instructions:
You were hospitalized following a trauamtic event where you
sustained a brain injury, right femur fracture, right clavicle
fracture and rib fractures. Your femur fracture was repaired in
the operating room; your staples have been removed. It is common
to have pain from time to time from your injuries. You have been
prescribed a pain medication called Dilaudid which you should
take only as needed.

Your brain injury has left you with some memory deficits and at
times you act impulsively. It is important that you listen to
your care providers and take your medications as prescribed.

Followup Instructions:
Follow up in 2 weeks with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 86496**] [**Name (STitle) **], Cognitive
Neurology for ongoing evaluation of your traumatic brain injury;
call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6335**] for an appointment.

Follow up in 4 weeks with CT of brain with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **],
Neurosurgery; call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1669**] for an appointment.
