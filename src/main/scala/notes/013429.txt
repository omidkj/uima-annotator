Service:  [**Location (un) **]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81-year-old female
with history of pulmonary hypertension and severe kyphosis,
who presents with increasing progressive shortness of breath
and acute hypoxia at rehab.  She desaturated to the 60s, but
improved on BiPAP.  She has a long history of restrictive
lung disease with a FEV1 of 0.42 liters and secondary to her
severe kyphoscoliosis also with mild pulmonary hypertension
on echocardiogram in [**2136**].  She is on home oxygen.

She fell on [**9-14**], and had a left hip fracture
status post ORIF here and then went to [**Hospital3 **].  She
has not been able to ambulate since that time, and with
significant left lower extremity weakness.  She is doing well
on Coumadin with goal INR of 1.5 to 2, and getting PT at
rehab.

She then developed increasing shortness of breath for five
days prior to admission.  No complaints of fever, chills,
cough with minimal sputum plus postnasal drip.  No change in
her lower extremity edema, no calf swelling, and no
tenderness at rehab.  She slowly progressed with shortness of
breath with increased respiratory rate and desaturations at
79% on 2 liters and up to 86 to 91% on 6 liters.  She was
seen by Pulmonary and Cardiology with a gas of pH of 7.35,
pO2 of 77, pCO2 of 60 on 4 liters.  She had no EKG changes.
She was tried on the BiPAP with better saturations at night
as well as with increasing nebulizers.  She was not felt to
be a cardiac cause at [**Hospital1 **], and saturations during the
day improved to 92% on 3 liters.  She continued on her
nightly BiPAP, but today had increasing dyspnea, which was
gradual and more q.d. saturations of 64%, was very short of
breath.  BiPAP was started bringing saturations up to high
80s and transferred to [**Hospital1 69**].
Her saturations were 90% on BiPAP, given 20 mg of IV Lasix in
the ED with good diuresis.  Chest x-ray consistent with CHF
on initial presentation.

A CTA was obtained to rule out pulmonary embolism which was
negative, and lungs were fairly clear with small bilateral
pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis after diuresis
without signs of pulmonary edema or consolidation.  She was
admitted to the MICU on BiPAP for further workup.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Health care proxy is [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 21357**], who is a
nurse here and a niece.  Her extension is [**Numeric Identifier 21358**].  Code status
is DNR/DNI, but does want noninvasive vents.  She was
currently at rehab before fracture and could ambulate about
two feet with a walker, but no tobacco history.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 98.3, blood
pressure 121/52, pulse 90, respiratory rate 24, and O2
saturation 96% on BiPAP.  In general, she is in mild distress
on BiPAP.  HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to
light.  Extraocular muscles are intact.  Pulmonary:  Coarse
breath sounds without rales anteriorly and no wheezes.  Heart
is regular, rate, and rhythm.  Abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities no cyanosis
or clubbing, 1+ pitting edema of the left lower extremity.
Neurologic examination is [**5-8**] in right lower extremity and
bilateral upper extremities [**4-7**]+/5 left lower extremity,
reflexes intact.

EKG with normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, normal intervals,
no acute ST-T wave changes.

Chest x-ray with cardiomegaly and marked scoliosis, bilateral
pleural effusions right greater than left.  Underlying
infiltrates CHF.

CTA negative for pulmonary embolus.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White count 8.1, hematocrit 37.2,
platelets 287.  Sodium 142, potassium 4, BUN 19, creatinine
0.7, bicarb 40.  Troponin less than 0.1.  Urinalysis was
negative and cultures were pending on admission.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Hypoxia/CHF:  Patient's hypoxia was improved with diuresis
on Lasix and continued BiPAP at night.  She did continue to
have rales on examination, but otherwise goal was for
negative fluid balance throughout her stay with diuresis with
Lasix.  Her weight on discharge was 60.2 kg and was
symptomatically improved breathing and her oxygen saturations
and oxygen requirements decreased from nonrebreather at 40%
down to her baseline of 2 liters which she was sating 96%.
She was continued on her nebulizers which were standing and
prn, and all improved.  Repeat chest x-rays were also
improved.

2. Cardiovascularly, the patient's troponins remained
negative, and the patient was continued on standing IV Lasix
until day of discharge, and has been decreased.  Upon plan
for discharge, she was continued on her metoprolol 25 mg
t.i.d. and was also started on diltiazem, aspirin, and her
other home medications.  She was also continued on her
Coumadin goal of 1.5 to 2.  Patient's INR was subtherapeutic
and her Coumadin dose was subsequently increased to 5 mg q.d.
with INR subsequently at 2.0 at that rate.  Patient's
electrolytes were followed closely with a goal potassium of 4
and magnesium greater than 2 with her history of SVT and her
risk factors.

Patient was initially admitted to the unit for BiPAP, and
then the following day was transferred to the floor, where
she continued to improve and required less oxygen.  While on
continued diuresis, patient became slightly alkalotic and was
started on ............ for 48 hours to help with her
alkalosis.  The patient improved subsequently, and was
considered stable for discharge for her cardiac and pulmonary
standpoint.

3. FEN:  Patient with a long history of osteoporosis.
Patient was continued on her q weekly Fosamax, vitamin D, and
calcium.  Her osteoporosis was stable here during her stay.

4. Urinary tract infection:  Patient after having a Foley,
which showed a negative urinalysis on admission, subsequently
had many bacteria, 22 white blood cells, and 11 red blood
cells, with a urine culture positive for E. coli with
sensitivities pending.  The patient was started on
levofloxacin for goal therapy for one week.  Patient was
started on this on [**10-22**].

5. Prophylaxis:  The patient was continued on a bowel regimen
during her stay.  Was on a proton-pump inhibitor and Tylenol
prn pain.  Patient was planned to be discharged to [**Hospital1 **]
and process was begun for rescreening.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.  Back to her baseline home
oxygen requirement of 2 liters by nasal cannula.  Still not
ambulating secondary to her left lower extremity fracture
recently.
