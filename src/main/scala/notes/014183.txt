llq pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
61 yo F with a history of multiple medication allergies,
fibromyalgia, left adnexal cyst and a recent h/o diverticulitis
(2 prior episodes) presents now with LLQ pain with nausea and
decrease appetite. Pain started 5 days ago with mild LLQ pain,
which she intially ignored and increased in intensity over the
next 3 days. On the night prior to admission pain progressed to
the point that she was unable to sleep. Pain ranges from [**2102-6-19**]
and is mostly in the LLQ, and radiates to the hip and to the
back. Pain is more intense, and more medial and distal than pain
with her prior bout of diverticulitis. Denies fevers, vaginal
discharge, nausea, and back pain. Her stool pattern has been
normal with a recent stool yesterday normal without melena or
hematochezia.
.
In the ED CT scan showed new sigmoid diverticulitis with no
active fluid collection. Because of a history of ovararian cyst
a pelvic u/s was perfromed and was reassuring. Gyn was consulted
and will follow along. Patient received dilaudid 1 mg IV x1. She
received 2 L NS. On transfer VS were 88, 119/48, 16, 95% RA.
.
Of note, patient was admitted [**2-20**] - [**2-22**] with diverticulitis
and required antibiotic desensitization in the ICU. Patient had
previously had one episode of diverticulitis. Allergy consult
was called, and in conjunction with the patient the decision was

made to proceed with desensitization to Augmentin. The protocol

was modified to begin with a quarter of the usual protocol dose

and to include hydroxyzine instead of benadryl. Desensitization

was uneventful and concluded with 500 mg dose (plan for 500 mg
PO TID at discharge). However, peripheral eosinophil count rose

to 9.1% on differential. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding
this admission.

.
In the ICU, patient reports pain is [**6-17**]. She is wheezing on
exam, which she attributes to multiple staff members wearing
cologne and perfume.

   CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Pending):

[**2103-3-8**] TVUS IMPRESSION:
1. Normal uterus and endometrium.
2. Large simple left ovarian cyst, unchanged in size. Normal
arterial and
venous flow in the left ovary.
3. Right ovary not visualized.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the MICU for desensitization to
Augmentin for treatment of diverticulitis. She tolerated the
regimen well and was transferred to the regular medicine floor
on [**2103-3-9**] and tolerated clears. By [**3-11**] she could eat a BRAT
diet. She will need a 14 days course of Augmentin and was
recommended to stay on a BRAT diet until completing antibiotics.
She will need an outpatient colonoscopy once the diverticulitis
has healed.
.
# L Adnexal Simple Cyst: 8cm simple cyst discovered during
imaging in previous admission, previously asymptomatic. Based on
consensus guidelines, an 8cm simple cyst in post-menopausal
female requires further investigation with imaging or surgery.
She had outpatient GYN follow-up scheduled for this issue but
was readmitted. Torsion unlikely based on US, but intermittent
torsion cannot be ruled out. If pain resolves with treatment for
diverticulits, pain can be attributed to that mechanism. If pain
does not resolve, OB-GYN to reassess for possible LSC.
.
# Wheezing on exam: Per patient, this occurs with exposure to
colognes and perfumes, which she noticed in the ED. No evidence
of fluid on lung bases from CT abdomen. Empirically treated with
albuterol in the MICU
.
# Hypertension and hyperlipidemia: Patient will only take name
brand medications. She declined to take medications while in the
hospital.
