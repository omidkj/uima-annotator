Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
near syncope, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization [**3-3**]

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 59 year old female with a PMH of near syncopal
episodes, ventricular ectopy, and hypothyroidism who presents
with hypotension in the setting of right groin pressure
following cardiac catheterization.

Briefly, patient complained of 3 episodes of near syncope in the
past several months (one episode possibly inciting a motor
vehicle collision).  She describes a sensation of fluttering in
her chest accompanied by lightheadness and near- fainting.
Denies any associated chest pain, nausea/ vomiting, diaphoresis
or other symptoms.  Extensive evaluation by her cardiologist
showed sinus bradycardia with ventricular ectopy for which she
was started on metoprolol.  Echo in [**2104**] showed EF of 45% with
mild global hypokinesis and repeat in [**2105**] showed EF improved to
50% with grade II diastolic dysfunction.

Following her last episode of near syncope, she presented to her
cardiologist.  EKG showed new inferolateral repolarization
changes compared to her prior EKG from [**2106-12-29**]. She
was admitted to an OSH on [**2107-3-2**], where she was r/o for MI
and had a stress test which reported showed a small fixed
deficit (offical read pending).  Of note, she did have an
episode of bradycardia and low BP overnight which improved with
IVF.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for catheterization.

Cardiac catheterization showed clear coronaries, patient
tolerated well with no immediate complications.  Following
angioseal placement and during application of right groin
pressure to acheive hemostasis, patient complained of intense
pain and had a likely vagal episode: acutely diaphoretic,
dropped BP to 60s and HR to 40s.  Episode resolved spontaneously
but given concern for possible RP bleed left arteriogram was
performed which showed no evidence of dissection or bleed.
Transferred to the CCU for overnight hemodynamic monitoring.

Upon arrival to CCU, patient comfortable, only complaining of
mild right groin pain.  Review of systems was negative, denying
any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis,
pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias,
joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. S/he
denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. S/he denies exertional
buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were
negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Studies:
Cardiac Cath [**2107-3-3**] - COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated no angiographically apparent, flow limiting,
coronary artery disease.  The LMCA, LAD, LCx, and RCA were all
normal in appearence.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed noral systemic blood
pressure, with a central aortic pressure of 115/73 mmHg.
3. Right femoral angiography revealed a high stick above the
pelvic rim.
4. 6F angioseal deployed successfully, without evidence of RP
bleed on angiography.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
2. High common femoral artery stick without evidence of RP
bleed.

TTE [**2107-3-4**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. LV systolic function appears depressed (ejection
fraction 30 percent) with a continuous gradient of worsening
hypokinesis from base (mild) to apex (severe). There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular free wall
thickness is normal. Right ventricular chamber size is normal.
with borderline normal free wall function. The ascending aorta
is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 59-year-old female with HTN, HL, chronic
palpitations and recurrent episodes of syncope and near syncope
transferred for cardiac cath in setting of EKG changes and
abnormal stress test without significant lesions found on
cardiac cath.

# Near-syncope and AVNRT: The patient has had multiple past
episodes of near syncope with lightheadedness and palpitations.
These episodes have increased in frequency in the past few
months with associated palpitations. Outpatient Holter monitor
reportedly showed PVCs. Cardiac catheterization showed no
coronary artery disease.  She should avoid any heavy lifting for
the next week. While in the CCU she had an episode of SVT to the
170s with associated nausea that resolved spontaneously after a
few minutes. Review of telemetry was consistent with AVNRT.
Electrophysiology was consulted. They recommended a TTE that
showed decreased EF and hypokinesis. EF may have been slightly
more depressed than previously noted due to recent SVT. EP
recommended ablation of the AVNRT and cardiac MRI to further
evaluate for structural heart disease. They also recommended
blood tests for cardiomyopathy. The patient had a normal TSH at
the OSH prior to transfer and reported a recently negative HIV
test.  Serum ferritin was within normal limits at 67 and plasma
metanephrines were also ordered and pending at discharge.
Patient was discharged with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor to further
characterize her heart rhythm when she has presyncopal episodes.
Her history is not consistent with neurogenic etiologies such as
seizures. If this additional cardiac evaluation is unrevealing,
she may have some degree of autonomic dysfunction and may
benefit
