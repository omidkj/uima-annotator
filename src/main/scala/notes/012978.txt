Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamides)

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
89 yo female with h/o stroke, DM2, GERD, GOUT who presented wtih
SOB. She reports that she felt lightheaded and SOB at home. She
felt fatigued and had a non-productive cough for several days.
Denies chest pain, nause or vomiting. Today she felt more
lightheaded and SOB. She called her daughter and then 911. In
the ED, she was found to be in a.flutter with 2:1 block rate
140s, SBP 78/53. She was given IV diltiazem and placed on a dilt
gtt at 5mg/hr. She was given IVF and preppred with versed and
fentanyl for cardioversion. The SBP dropped to 50s systolic. She
was shocked with 100J and then 150J with no effect. A femoral
line was placed urgently and neosynepherine was started. Her BP
improved to 120-140 range systolic. In total she received 5L
IVF. Her rectal temp was 100.6 and CXR suggested RLL infiltrate;
therefore, she was given vancomycin and levofloxacin. She also
had a CTA chest to rule out PE which was negative. She
spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm in the 80s and felt much
better. She is admitted to the ICU for further care.

On review of systems, she denies fevers/chills, N/V, abdominal
pain, palpitations, dysuria or frequency. Denies PND or
orthopnea.

Urine Cx [**1-5**]: Negative
Blood Cx [**1-5**]: NGTD

CXR [**1-5**]:
1. Decreased lung volumes. Patchy opacities in both lower lobes
could
represent a combination of asymmetric pulmonary edema,
atelectasis, and/or
infection.
2. Crescents of gas noted beneath both diaphragms. Air under
left diaphragm could represent air within a loop of bowel, as
previously seen. If there is concern for free air within the
abdomen, lateral decubitus radiographs of the abdomen could be
obtained.

CTA [**1-5**]:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or dissection.
2. Sub-5-mm nodules in the left upper lobe as described above.
Followup in
three-to-six months is recommended to document stability if
clinically
indicated.
3. Findings in the right lung base may represent atelectasis
versus
consolidation.
4. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node calcifications, and splenic
calcificaions, consistent with prior granulomatous disease.
5. Degenerative changes of the left shoulder with large joint
effusion.

ECHO [**1-6**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No left atrial
mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal
echocardiography). There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2108-6-14**], the
aortic valve velocity has slightly increased. The right
ventricular cavity was mildly increased on review of the prior
study.


Brief Hospital Course:
89 yo F with PMH of DM2, diastolic CHF, gout and presented with
sudden onset of SOB and found to be in atrial flutter and then
atrial fibrillation.

# RHYTHM: Pt initially failed 2 attempts at cardioversion from
presumed new onset atrial flutter, but converted spontaneously
to normal sinus rhythm with volume resuscitation. Based on CXR
and CTA, possible pneumonia may have been the inciting factor
for this new arrhythmia.  She was ruled out for other etiology
including PE (neg CTA), ischemia (CE negative x3), and sepsis
(blood cultures NGTD). An echo showed no obvious etioloty of the
atrial flutter with no wall motion abnormalities or dilitation.
Pt's home regimen of diltiazem was initially held, then
restarted IV and transitioned to PO extended release. She was
continued on ASA at an increased dose but was poor candidate for
anticoagulation with coumadin.  Patient and daughter are in
agreement of not anticoagulating.  Pt was monitored closely on
telemtry without any furthur arrhythmic episodes.

# Hypotension: On presentation pt required pressors to maintain
adequate blood pressure. This was thought to be due to rapid
rate vs sepsis. Blood cultures were drawn and were NGTD at time
of discharge and pt quickly was able to wean off pressors with
control of heart rate. Diltiazem was initially held but
restarted for rate control. Pt's lactate initially was 2.2,
improved on repeat. Lasix from home regimen was also held and
restarted prior to discharge.

# Pneumonia: Pt with RLL pneumonia on CXR and was treated with
continue levofloxacin for community acquired pneumonia.  Pt was
initially on Vancomycin for a questionable cellulitis of lower
extremities but discontinued when clarified that this is
chronic. An ultrasound of the lower extremities was refused by
the patient to rule out DVT, although clinical suspicion was
low.  All cultures were negative or pending at time of
discharge.

# Chronic Diastolic CHF: Pt received 5L of IVF in ED and since
then appeared euvolemic. BP control with diltiazem was initially
held and restarted once stable.
Prior to discharge, home regimen of lasix was restarted.

# Diabetes type 2: Oral agents were held and blood sugars were
treated with insulin sliding scale.  Will resume oral agents.

# Gout: Pt was continued on allopurinol and colchicine

# Osteoporosis: Pt was continued on calcium and vitamin D

Pt was DNR/DNI throughout admission.
