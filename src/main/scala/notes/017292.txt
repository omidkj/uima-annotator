RLE cellulitis, ulcer


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2204-2-15**] Angioplasty of Right peroneal vessel


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o woman with hx. of CAD who was admitted [**2-13**] with rt. foot
ulcer and pain to Dr.[**Name (NI) 10879**] service (vascular surgery). A
plain film was consistent with Rt. 1st MT head osteomyelitis.
She was started on Vanc, cipro, flagyl, and underwent Rt.
peroneal angioplasty on [**2-15**]. 2 d after this, she experienced
rapid atrial fibrillation with sbp in the 70's a/w troponin
elevation. This was rate controlled with lopressor. She then
experienced flash pulmonary edema on [**2-20**] and was diuresed with
lasix. On the am of [**2-21**] she was reportedly 4 kg lighter, and had
sbp 76 with HR 50's. She was given two 250 cc boluses with sbp
up to 80's, started on dopamine gtt, and transfered to the CCU
at Dr.[**Name (NI) 5452**] request, for further management. Patient improved

JVP of 6 cm. The carotid waveform was normal. There was no
thyromegaly. The were no chest wall deformities, scoliosis or
kyphosis. The respirations were not labored and there were no
use of accessory muscles. The lungs had basilar crackles
bilaterally with normal breath sounds and no adventitial sounds
or rubs.
.
Palpation of the heart revealed the PMI to be located in the 5th
intercostal space, mid clavicular line. There were no thrills,
lifts or palpable S3 or S4. The heart sounds revealed a normal
S1 and the S2 was normal. There were no rubs, murmurs, clicks or
gallops.
.
The abdominal aorta was not enlarged by palpation. There was no
hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. The abdomen was soft nontender
and nondistended. The extremities had no pallor, cyanosis,
clubbing or edema. There were no abdominal, femoral or carotid
bruits. Inspection and/or palpation of skin and subcutaneous

Brief Hospital Course:
# HYPOTENSION: Patient initially admitted to CCU for this, but
subsequently resolved. Could be multifactorial. Possible
etiologies include hypoglycemia, excessive diuresis, infection,
cardiogenic, symptomatic a-fib. Required dopamine initially, now
weaned. Received 1 unit PRBCs, but otherwise hematocrit was
stable. Sepsis unlikely as patient has no increase in WBC and
afebrile, but still must be considered and was continued on
Vancomycin. Cardiogenic etiology unlikely given CK and trop
flat. ECG demonstrated global TWI, but essentially unchanged.
Echocardiogram showed ejection fraction > 55%.  Patient
transferred from CCU to VICU [**2204-2-27**]. Continued to improve. Had
2nd event of bradycardia/hypotension on [**2204-2-28**].
Lethargic/confused. ECG negative. Enzymes cycled. Patient
improved after fluid bolus. Beta blocker discontinued.
Amiodarone tapered and discontinued.

# Pump function: Diuresed during CCU admission.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: Continued amiodarone.  Heparin gtt
started initially for anticoagulation, then transitioned to
warfarin.  At time of discharge, amiodarone discontinued.
Discharged on Coumadin 0.5mg daily with INR checks to be sent to
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and patient's primary Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4390**].
.
# OSTEOMYELITIS: Likely secondary to poor perfusion, healing in
the setting of diabetes.  Continued vancomycin
.
# DELIRIUM: Likely sundowning as occured in the evening, but
otherwise stable and responded to Haldol 1mg, with monitoring of
QTc, since patient is also on amiodarone.
At time of discharge patient returned to her baseline (oriented
to self, family)
.
# Coronary artery disease: Question of recent ischemia during
CCU admission but as above, enzymes flat. At home on metoprolol
and nifedipine, but held in the setting of hypotension.
Restarted beta-blocker and uptitrated as blood pressure
tolerated.  Monitored ECG and cardiac enzymes.  Continued
aspirin, atorvastatin, and ezetimibe.
.
# Diabetes mellitus: Stable. Did have labile blood sugars
initially. Continued sliding scale insulin but held home regimen
until adequate PO intake.
.
# S/p peroneal angioplasty: Vascular following. Appreciate recs.
Will monitor neurovascular exam closely. Pain management as
needed.
.
# ACCESS: Right arm PICC line was placed. All lines discontinued
at discharge.
.
# PPX: on coumadin, PPI, bowel regimen
.
# DNR, but would want intubation for respiratory failure as
needed for short period (days). Health care proxy [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]

unilateral runoff with PTA of the peroneal artery. B/L PT/DP
