History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 58 yo male with history of DMII, morbid obesity
s/p gastric bypass, h/o [**Hospital **] transferred from [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital for
management of massive hemoptysis and bilateral pulmonary emboli.
 The patient developed shortness of [**Hospital 1440**] one week prior to
admission.  He presented to [**Hospital3 2358**] on [**3-1**] with chest
tightness and shortness of [**Month/Year (2) 1440**] and palpitations. He was
admitted, had a neg CTA Chest, normal pharmacologic stress test

IMAGING/STUDIES:
TTE [**2161-3-11**]: Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular
cavity is dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. The mitral valve
leaflets are not well seen. There is an anterior space which
most likely represents a promient fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Severely limited and suboptimal image quality.
Probable normal left ventricular size and function. Right
ventricle appeared hypertrophied, dilated and mildly
hypokinetic.
.
LENIS: 1. Occlusive thrombus seen within the right distal common
femoral vein extending into the superficial femoral vein.
Nonocclusive thrombus seen within the right popliteal vein.
2. No evidence of deep venous thrombus within the left lower
extremity.
.
TTE [**2161-3-13**]: Suboptimal image quality. Right ventricular cavity
enlargement with free wall hypokinesis. Preserved global left
ventricular systolic function. No definite valvular dysfunction
identified.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2161-3-11**],
the right ventricular cavity is now smaller and free wall motion
is slightly improved.
.
INTERVENTIONAL- IVC FILTER PLACEMENT, EMBOLIZATION
1. Normal thoracic aortogram.
2. Angiogram of an intercostal bronchial trunk on the right side
demonstrating branches supplying right and left perihilar
parenchyma with  evidence for abnormal blush on the right. This
vessel was successfully
embolized using 500-700 micron Embospheres.
3. Venogram demonstrating a patent IVC with no filling defects.
An accessory right renal vein was identified at the level of the
L3 vertebral body.
4. Successful placement of an infrarenal retrievable Cook IVC
filter with
satisfactory deployment.
.
CHEST CT [**2161-3-15**] : 1. Multifocal pulmonary ground glass density
and consolidation, with new involvement of the left upper lobe
and increased consolidation in the right lung base. Given the
history of hemoptysis, this could represent recurrent pulmonary
hemorrhage, but multifocal pneumonia could also have this
appearance.
2. New small bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
4. Exophytic left renal lesions, the largest of which likely
represents a
cyst. The other two are indeterminate.
5. Small nonobstructing right renal calculi.
6. Right lower lobe pulmonary embolus.
.
RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY U/S: Thrombus within the right
mid-to-distal cephalic vein.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 58-year-old man with a history of DMII, morbid obesity
s/p gastric bypass, h/o DVT who p/w massive hemoptysis and
bilateral pulmonary emboli.  His course has also been
complicated by VAP/HAP and a brachial vein thrombus.  Patient is
now afebrile with general overall improvement.
.
# MASSIVE HEMOPTYSIS:  Patient arrived from outside hospital
([**Hospital 8641**] Hospital) intubated with blood noted to be in both
lumens of ETT.  CTA report supposedly showed massive pulmonary
emboli (unfortunately, this report was not available on
discharge).  Patient was sent urgently to IR where he underwent
embolization to right bronchial artery. From IR he was
transferred directly to the OR where he underwent flexible and
rigid bronchoscopy.  Per IP report, the airways looked clean
other than scant old blood.  An IVC filter was placed as patient
was at high bleeding risk with massive hemoptysis.  From OR,
patient was transferred to MICU, intubated and sedated.  He was
transiently hypotensive on arrival with systolics in 60's in the
setting of high dose propophol.  Anaesthesia administered a
300mcg bolus of phenylephrine and pressure increased to
systolics in 110's.  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was able to be weaned off pressors
and extubated.  Hematocrit remained stable and he did not
require blood products.
