Brief Hospital Course:
On presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**2168-3-2**], patient's temp was 99.
She became hypotensive and confused shortly after arrival.  She
was placed on levophed and a central line was placed.  Blood
cultures were obtained and sent.  She arrived with foley
catheter in place for chronic retention.  A urinalysis was sent
and showed few bacteria, 26k WBC with hyaline casts.  Her right
hand was erythematous, swollen and hot with obvious areas of
blistering and ischemia.  She had received vancomycin,
gentamicin, clindamycin IV at an OSH.  Due to her overall
clinical picture, there was a high suspicion for necrotizing
fasciitis and patient was taken to the OR for emergent
exploration of the right hand.  She underwent incision and
debridement and carpal tunnel release right hand and forearm.
Cultures were obtained and sent in the OR.  The patient was kept
intubated and transferred to the ICU post surgery.
.
Upon admission to the ICU, a second pressor was added
(Norepinephrine) for persistent hypotension and she was given a
dose of azithromycin and ceftriaxone intravenously.  Overnight,
she was commenced on meropenem, clindamycin and linezolid IV and
Infectious Disease was consulted in the morning.  Her
postoperative course was notable for increasing pressor
requirement and hemodynamic lability.  As a result, she was
emergently taken back to the operating room on [**2168-3-3**] for a
repeat I&D.
.
Once back in ICU, the patient was maintained on contact
precautions for a reported history of MRSA and follow up MRSA
nasal swab confirmed this.  ID recommended discontinuing
meropenem and linezolid and maintaining the patient on
ceftriaxone and clindamycin.  Right hand/forearm debrided areas
were treated with TID dressing changes of wet to dry and right
forearm/hand maintained in a splint.  A wound care consult was
requested for care of chronic left lower extremity ulcers and
wounds were treated daily, pe
