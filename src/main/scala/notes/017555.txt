CXR [**6-16**]):
Bilateral effusions as above with diminished lung volumes. The
bibasilar opacities are likely atelectasis, although early
developing pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded particularly in
light of leukocytosis. No failure.
.
.
TTE:
There is mild (non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal
septum. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic
function is mildly depressed with mid-septal and mid to distal
inferior
hypokinesis. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The end-diastolic
pulmonic
regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery
diastolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
# [**Female First Name (un) 564**] esophagitis:  Admitted with poor po in setting of
thrush.  EGD confirmed [**Female First Name (un) **] esophagitis.  On IV fluconazole
with clotrimazole troches and nystatin for mouth care.  She
should complete a 21d course of fluconazole (day 10 at
discharge).
.
# MRSA septicemia due to UTI with PICC seeding:  Hypotensive
during hospital admission, requiring ICU admission for frequent
fluid boluses to maintain bp.  Blood cultures subsequently grew
MRSA.  Subsequent urine cultures grew MRSA.  Patient was treated
with vancomycin x 7 days (d1=[**2163-6-11**]).  PICC line (placed for
TPN) discontinued.  TTE negative for vegetation.  Surveillance
cultures since [**2163-6-10**] (date of PICC removal) no growth to date
so new PICC line placed for TPN.
.
# Acute change in mental status:  Onset while on IV fluconazole
and vancomycin.  Lactate/ABG/lytes/LFTs/head CT.  No focal
deficit appreciated but exam limited.  Head MRI showed no acute
process.  Likely delirium, severe constipation, and hypothermia
contributing.  After bowel regimen, manual disimpaction, warming
blanket, mental status back near baseline, per son.  She
continued to have intermittent mild delerium however.
.
# Severe malnutrition:  Initially started on TPN but PICC had to
be discontinued due to MRSA line infection.  Subsequently,
platelets dropped, concerning for HIT.  HIT ab negative and plt
rebounded spontaneously.  DEspite risk of PICC and TPN
(infection, fungemia) given that a feeding tube (nasal) would be
uncomfortable for pt, it was decided after d/w family, to
replace PICC and restart TPN.
.
# Thrombocytopenia:  HIT antibody negative.  Fibrinogen/FDP do
not suggest DIC.  Plt rebounded to normal level.
.
# CAD:  On ASA.  Holding BB.
.
# Afib:  On ASA.  Rate controlled off BB.
.
# Anemia: Suspect AOCD.  HCt was variable over the admission but
not requiring transfusion.  No signs of blood loss or hemolysys.
 Hct was stable 2d prior to discharge at 27 but overall downward
trend.  Would rpt in [**3-12**] days.
.
# DNR/DNI.  Goals of care d/w son [**Name (NI) 382**] and he is leaning
towards to do not hospitalized status if she were to
decompensate again.
.
# FEN: Restarted TPN.  Trials of POs were intermittently
successful with periods of aspiration at times.  However, given
pt expressing desire to eat, soft diet was attempted.  Due to
difficulty taking meds, her PO med regimen was pared down and
even with this she was only taking intermittent PO meds.
