Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Cardiac Catheterization with two bare metal stents to Right
Coronary Artery


History of Present Illness:
87 yo female with history of dementia presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] on
[**2186-10-8**] with chest pain and diaphoresis, transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for
immediate cath as thought to have an inferior STEMI, with ST
elevations and CKs ranging from 150-155. She was found to have a
chronic total occlusion of the RCA which was stented. She was
hypoxic and hypotensive with a PCWP of 20-25 in the
catheterization lab and was admitted to the CCU post-operatively
for additional management.

Soon thereafter the patient stabilized and was transferred to a
general medical floor on [**2186-10-11**] for ongoing management while
she recovered from her recent MI and additional care of her
multiple co-morbidities, including COPD, Anemia, Alzheimer's
type dementia, rheumatoid arthritis.  Of note, she had a
leukocytosis to 33 with 92% neutrophils, hyponatremia,
transaminitis, and an elevated LDH in addition to her cardiac
issues. Mrs.[**Known lastname 80177**] hyponatremia and transaminitis resolved but
her leukocytosis and elevated LDH remained active issues.
Infectious work up revealed negative blood and urine cultures,
and a CT torso significant for multi-focal ground glass
opacities consistent with edema vs. a multi-lobar infectious
process, and one enlarged 17x17mm subcarinal lymph node was
found as well. She was started on levofloxacin for presumed PNA
on [**10-10**].

Soon after the patient was transferred to the general medical
floors, she began to have persistent bouts of NSVT noted on
telemetry. Fortunately, she remained asymptomatic during these
episodes but the NSVT runs became increasingly more prolonged
with telemetry tracings demonstrating 60-70 beat runs of
ventricular tachycardia. The patient had no chest pain,
dizziness or shortness of breath compliants at that time and her
blood pressures were stable. A cardiology consult was called and
the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 1516**] inpatient cardiology
service. While on the inpatient cardiology service the patient
continued to have multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia
lasting as long as 50-60 minutes. She converted back to normal
sinus, sinus bradycardia and occasional AV-block (I and II) on
her own on multiple occasions but generally required additional
Amiodarone and Lidocaine boluses to resolve her VT episodes.
This VT was felt to be secondary to her scarred and irritated
myocardium status-post recent inferior MI. The patient continued
to be completely asympomatic and hemodynamically stable during
these episodes of VT.  The EP team was consulted and involved in
Mrs.[**Known lastname 80177**] management. She was initially evaluated for a
defibrillator but it was decided that she would have poor
quality of life with a device given the frequency of her VT and
she was also a poor surgical candidate given her multiple
co-morbidites. A more detailed EP study with possible ablation
was also explored but the patient continued to have bradycardia,
hemodynamic instability and an acute PNA infection. Thus, this
option was deferred in favor of trying additional medical
management. She was continued on metoprolol 50mg twice a day and
her electrolyes were closely monitored and repleted while on the
cardiology service. Due to her bradycardia with Amiodarone she
was switched to Quinidine for control of her VT episodes. EP
started quinidine 324mg Q8H on [**2186-10-16**], as they were moving away
from a plan to ablate her.  Unfortunately, she did not tolerate
Quinidine well and was admitted to the CCU for monitoring of
hemodynamically unstable bradycardia and the alarming onset QT
prolongation after initiating therapy with quinidine.

Past Medical History:
CHF with a "dilated ventricle"
Rheumatoid arthritis on prednisone and methotrexate
history of falls, including pelvic fracture after a fall in
[**Month (only) 956**]
Anemia
COPD/bronchiectasis
Pneumonia status post intubation in [**7-25**]
urinary incontinence
Alzheimer's type dementia


Social History:
Lives in [**Hospital3 **], independent with ADLs, but meals are
supplied and daughter helps the patient with her daily
medications by setting up her pill box for dispensing her daily
medications appropriately. The patient smoked approximately 1PPD
x30 years but quit 40 years ago. She also drank 1-2 drinks/night
until 10 years ago, tapered down to 1 small drink once or twice
a week more recently. She denies any history of illicit drug
use.

Family History:
No family history of sudden cardiac death or early CAD.

Physical Exam:
VS: T=95.1...BP=90-104/40s...HR=40s...RR=15
GENERAL: Elderly woman, thin, answering questions appropriately
HEENT: NCAT. Sclera anicteric. PERRL, EOMI. OP with dry mucous
membranes and visible oral thrush
NECK: Supple with no JVD
CARDIAC: Regular rhythm, bradycardic, no audible murmurs
LUNGS:Bilateral crackles when listening anteriorly
ABDOMEN: Soft, NTND. No HSM or tenderness. Tympanitic to
percussion throughout
EXTREMITIES: No c/c/e. No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2186-10-18**]:
Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. Patchy poorly
marginated
opacities in the upper lung zones are unchanged. There is
minimal improvement in the previously described opacity at the
right lung base. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Note
is again made of diffuse aortic calcification.

CARDIAC CATH REPORT [**2186-10-8**] :

1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
1 vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had mild disease. The
LAD was
calcified with serial 30-40% stenoses. The LCx was calcified
with a
proximal 40% stenosis in OM1. The RCA was calcified with total
occlusion
at the mid segment. There were faint collaterals filling the
distal
portion of the RCA from the left coronary artery.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right sided filling
pressures
with a RVEDP of 14mm Hg. There was mild to moderate pulmonary
arterial
hypertension with a PA pressure of 45/19 mm Hg. Systemic
arterial
pressure was elevated at 210/80 mm Hg prior to administration of
NTG
drip IV. The cardiac index was depressed at 1.8 L/min/m2. The
PVR was
5.2 Wood unit.
3. Successful PTCA and placement of two overlapping 2.5x18mm
Mini Vision
bare-metal stents in the mid-RCA were performed.  The stents
were
post-dilated using a 3.0mm balloon.  Final angiography showed
normal
flow, no apparent dissection, and no residual stenosis.  (See
PTCA
comments)

[**2186-10-9**] CHEST CT:
 1. Predominant central and dependent pulmonary ground-glass
opacities with underlying fissural thickening which is more
consistent with edema. Diffuse infectious process is also
possible.
2. Perihepatic ascites and periportal edema, could be due to
underlying CHF.
3. Old renal infarcts and narrowing of bilateral renal artery at
origin,
concern for renal artery stenosis.
4. Multiple bilateral renal hypodense lesions, most likely renal
cysts
5. Unhealed old fractures of the left superior and inferior
pubic ramus.
6. Osteopenia. Degenerative changes of bilateral hips.
