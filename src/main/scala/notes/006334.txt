HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56 year old
male who had a history of a pontine hemorrhage/
cerebrovascular accident complicated by pseudomonas
pneumonia.  The patient had had a percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy tube placed at an outside hospital and was
subsequently transferred to rehabilitation facility.  At
rehabilitation, he was noted to be hypotensive with a
systolic blood pressure in the 60s as well as spiking
temperatures.  The patient was transferred for further
evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Pontine cerebrovascular accident.
3.  Status post percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.
4.  History of alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature was 103.2
degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate 139, blood pressure 72/48,
respiratory rate 38, oxygen saturation 100% on nonrebreather.
The patient was unresponsive.  The chest was clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular was tachycardic
with no discernible murmur, rub or gallop.  The abdomen was
moderately distended and tympanitic with tube feed and oozing
around the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube site.
The extremities are cool and cold without edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count is
3.2, hematocrit 30.0, platelet count 251,000.  Chemistries
showed sodium 137, potassium 4.7, chloride 102, bicarbonate
22, blood urea nitrogen 19, creatinine 2.1, glucose 238.  INR
was 1.6.

Chest x-ray performed after intubation demonstrated
endotracheal tube in place, nasogastric tube in appropriate
place, no free air under the diaphragm.  CT scan performed on
admission demonstrated intra-abdominal fluid as well as free
air.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken emergently to the
operating room where he had an exploratory laparotomy, repair
of gastric perforation as well as drainage from
intra-abdominal abscess performed.  For details of this
procedure, please see the previously dictated operative note.
The patient tolerated the procedure fairly well and was taken
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring.  The
patient was placed on Zosyn for antibiotic coverage and
continued to spike intermittent fevers.  The patient had a
persistent inflammatory response for several days and
remained intubated.  The ventilator was weaned appropriately.
On [**2129-1-5**], the patient had a bronchoscopy done at bedside
which demonstrated clear airways and no plugs.  BAL was sent
from the right main stem.  On [**2129-1-6**], the patient was taken
back to the operating room and had a second exploratory
laparotomy performed with placement of a new gastrostomy tube
as well as washout of his abdominal contents.  Subsequent to
this, the patient was returned to the Intensive Care Unit and
had a prolonged course.  His antibiotic coverage was
broadened to include Ciprofloxacin, Flagyl and Fluconazole.
The patient remained in SIRS state but managed to avoid
vasopressors for much of his Intensive Care Unit course.  The
patient was extubated on [**2129-1-8**].  He did, however, have
some continued infectious problems.  Ceftazidime was added
for broadened coverage.  Pseudomonas was isolated from the
sputum on [**2129-1-5**].  The patient continued to have copious
secretions.  The patient was reintubated on [**2129-1-12**],
secondary to respiratory failure.  Multiple attempts were
made to wean ventilator subsequent to this which failed.  The
small bowel follow through was performed on [**2129-1-14**], which
demonstrated normal flow to the rectum.  Gastrostomy tube
clamping trial was attempted.  Subsequent to this, the
patient's main problems remained pulmonary as well as
infectious.  From a pulmonary standpoint, he had a
tracheostomy placed on [**2129-1-20**], without difficulty.
Subsequent to this, the patient had no difficulties with
maintaining adequate ventilation and oxygenation on trach
collar.  The patient's infectious issues ultimately resolved.
He had repeated bronchoscopy with multiple secretions washed
out. The patient had Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus
aureus growing from his sputum.  The patient was on
Vancomycin for a period of six days and defervesced as well
as had his white blood cell count trending downward.   In
order to fully insure that the patient's Methicillin
resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia was being treated,
the patient was switched to Linezolid for better nosocomial
pneumonia coverage.  The patient continued to do well and
ultimately was discharged on postoperative day twenty-seven
from his initial exploratory laparotomy tolerating a goal of
tube feeds and having been afebrile for 48 hours with a white
blood cell count of 11.0.

DISPOSITION:  To rehabilitation.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously three times a day.
2.  Clonidine TTS III patch q.Friday.
3.  Enalapril 10 mg per gastrostomy tube once daily.
4.  Prevacid 30 mg per gastrostomy tube once daily.
5.  Lopressor 125 mg per nasogastric tube three times a day.
6.  Linezolid 600 mg per nasogastric tube q12hours times
fourteen days.
7.  Regular insulin sliding scale.
8.  Roxicet Elixir 5 to 10ml q4hours p.r.n. pain.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS BY SYSTEMS:
1.  Neurologically, the patient is somewhat hemiparetic on
the left side from his previous known stroke.  He should
continue to get Roxicet p.r.n. for pain.

2.  Respiratory - The patient should have aggressive
pulmonary toilet with suctioning q1-2hours for copious
secretions.  Linezolid should be continued for presumed
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.

3.  Cardiovascular - The patient remains on Clonidine,
Lopressor as well as Enalapril for blood pressure control.
He remains in a low sinus tachycardia between 90 and 100
which is his baseline.

4.  Gastrointestinal - The patient is on Prevacid for
gastrointestinal prophylaxis.  He receives tube feeds of
Impact with Fiber at 80cc per hour.

5.  Genitourinary - The patient has good urine output ranging
between one and 1.5 liters per day.  His creatinine on
discharge was 0.8.

6.  Hematology - The patient has a stable hematocrit with
discharge day hematocrit of 42.0.

7.  Infectious disease - The patient should remain on
Linezolid for an additional two day course.  Temperature as
well as white blood cell count should be monitored
periodically to make sure that the patient does not have a
worsening infectious problem.

8.  Endocrine - The patient remains on insulin sliding scale
although his sugar has been well controlled and below 140 on
q6hour blood sugar checks.

9. Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The patient's only
fluids are supplied via his tube feeds at a rate of 80cc/hour
of Impact with Fiber.
