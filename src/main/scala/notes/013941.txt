Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 15287**]
Chief Complaint:
Bradycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
 83F hx IDDM, HTN, CAD s/p MI in [**2077**], seizure disorder, SLE,
CKD (baseline Cr 1.2), and recent admission for bradycardia
thought secondary to propanolol who is admitted for evaluation
of bradycardia and hypotension.

Per report, the patient presented for an emergent outpatient
appointment in cardiology clinic today after experiencing
epigastric pain/N/V the evening prior. In cardiology clinic, the
patient had a glucose of 30, for which she was treated with oral
sugar. She became tremulous and was taken to [**Company 191**] for evaluation.
At [**Company 191**], she appeared acutley ill with audible wheezing. An O2
sat was unable to be obtained, BP 102/50, and pulse 40. EMS was
called, and patient given 0.5mg atropine in the field with
improvement in her HR and BP per records.

Of note, the patient was recently admitted to the [**Hospital1 1516**] service
from [**Date range (1) **] with bradycardia and shortness of breath. Her
bradycardia was thought to be secondary to recent initiation of
propanolol. She was monitored in the hospital, and her
bradycardia resolved. Her SOB she was thought to be secondary to
mild volume overload, for which she was diuresed with 20 mg IV
furosemide.

In the ED, initial vitals were 97.0 67 143/48 14 100% 3L Nasal
Cannula. Labs were significant for Na 120, K 5.3, and Cr 1.6
(1.2 at recent discharge). HCT 29.7 (baseline ~32) and plts 145.
CXR showed findings concerning for RLL infiltrate versus
aspiration, widespread bilateral interstitial abnormality.
Received CTX/levoflox.  She received 1L NS for hyponatremia.

On arrival to the MICU, pt is agitated, but a/o x3.

ROS difficult to obtain [**12-26**] mental status.  only complain is
sensation of having to urinate with foley

Imaging:
CHEST XRAY [**8-21**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  Findings concerning for right lower lung infection versus
aspiration
pneumonitis.
2.  Possible mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
3.  Widespread bilateral pulmonary interstitial abnormality,
chronic in
appearance.

CXR [**8-22**]:
Comparison is made with prior study [**8-21**].
Right lower lobe consolidations have worsened.  Left lower lobe
opacities have markedly increased this could be due to
atelectasis and/or pneumonia.   Small bilateral pleural
effusions are larger on the right side.  Moderate pulmonary
edema has increased.  Patient has known chronic interstitial
disease.

Head CT [**8-22**]:
No evidence of hemorrhage, mass effect, or acute infarction.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

CXR [**8-23**]:
1.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely
unchanged, although
somewhat obscured by the diffuse airspace process, which has
worsened.  Given the change, this would favor worsening
pulmonary edema, although a diffuse pneumonia should also be
considered.  Small bilateral effusions are less well visualized
on the current examination.  No pneumothorax.

CXR [**8-24**]:
1.  Stably enlarged heart.  Unfolded calcified tortuous aorta
consistent with atherosclerosis.  Diffuse bilateral airspace
process does not appear to be significantly changed and could
reflect moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema or bilateral
infectious process.  Clinical correlation is advised.  Probable
small layering left effusion.  No pneumothorax.

ADMISSION EKG [**8-21**]: Baseline artifact. Most likely atrial
flutter with slow ventricular response. Non-specific ST-T wave
changes. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2110-8-16**] atrial
flutter rhythm is new.

Discharge EKG [**8-26**]: Sinus rhythm with slowing of the rate as
compared to the previous tracingof [**2110-8-25**]. Left atrial
abnormality. A-V conduction delay. Left ventricular hypertrophy.
Non-specific lateral ST-T wave changes. Absence of ventricular
ectopy as compared to the previous tracing of [**2110-8-25**].
Otherwise, no diagnostic interim change.

Brief Hospital Course:
Brief Course:
83F hx IDDM, HTN, CAD s/p MI in [**2077**], seizure disorder, SLE, CKD
(baseline Cr 1.2), and recent admission for bradycardia thought
secondary to propanolol who is admitted for evaluation of
bradycardia and hypotension. Bradycardia was responsive to
atropine and the hypotension improved as the bradycardia
improved. Patient was also found to be hyponatremic which was
corrected with diuresis and hypertonic saline. A pneumonia was
identified on chest xray and treated for HCAP with cefepime,
vancomycin, and azithromycin.

Active Issues:
#Hyponatremia: Thought to be secondary to hypovolemia/poor
forward flow with possible component of SIADH.  Na+ was 120 on
admission and nadired to 117 that night.  Renal was consulted
and recommended diuresis along with hypertonic saline which was
administered with frequent Na+ checks.  Sodium improved and was
within normal range upon discharge.

#Hospital Acquired Pneumo
