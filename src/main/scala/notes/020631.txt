Pertinent Results:
Echo [**10-18**]: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are
three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The
increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac
output. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation
is seen (within normal limits). Post CPB: Preserved
biventricular function. Normal valve structure and function

FINDINGS:

COMPARISON STUDY: [**2168-10-20**].

Since the prior study, there is decreased opacification of the
right lung base, with clearing of the patchy opacities seen on
the prior study. There is continued mild blunting of the right
costophrenic angle consistent with a small right-sided pleural
effusion. In addition, there may be a very mild degree of right
lower lobe atelectasis. The left lung is clear. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:

Interval clearing of right lower lobe with residual small right
pleural effusion and very mild right basilar atelectasis.
