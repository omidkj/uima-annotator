Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**]
Chief Complaint:
Generalized fatigue, diarrhea, and low grade fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of a femoral Hickman

History of Present Illness:
This is a 59 y/o female with relapsed AML who is Day 61 of
non-myeloablative allogeneic transplant.  The patient presented
to [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**] 7 for monitoring of her daily counts. On the day of
presentation the patient reports a one week history of loose
stools and [**2156-4-1**] lower abdominal pain.  She reports decrease
P.O. intake secondary to having no appetite.  While the patient
does admit to occasionally feeling cold, she denies any chills
or fevers.  On the day of presentation the patient reports
feeling a little SOB and requiring a wheelchair for
transportation.
.
Of note within the past week the patient has been seen in
clinic.  On [**2151-8-5**] the she was seen Nurse [**Last Name (Titles) 57569**].  At
the time the patient reported increased fatigue and decreased
activity. The patient denied any SOB, chest pain,
lightheadedness, fevers, chills, diarrhea, bruising, bleeding or
rashes.  She did report intermittent stomach upsets in temporal
relationship to moving her bowels. Her labs were noteworthy for
28% blasts.
.
The patient was also seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12375**] on [**2151-8-6**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12375**]
commented that the patient may be with recurrence of disease.
Cyclosporine dose was rapidly tapered in an effort to try and
reduce GVHD.  A bone marrow biposy was and aspirate was done to
assess the extent of involvement and chimerism.  The plan at the
time was to monitor the patient daily counts.
.
Onc History as per Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 22359**] note:
Ms. [**Known lastname 57565**] is a 59 yo woman who developed general malaise,
SOB, fatigue, cough, and congestion in [**8-1**] and presented to her

PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) 57566**] tx c an inhaler, her PCP ordered routine lab work
and found a white blood count of 100,000 and she was admitted to

[**Hospital **] Hospital. She was found to have circulating blasts and
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for further
evaluation.

On admission to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2150-8-28**], Ms. [**Known lastname 57565**] had a white
blood count of 129,000. Differential showed 23% neutrophils, 70%

lymphocytes, 44% monocytes, 2% bands, 2% metamyelocytes and 8%
blasts. She had a platelet count of 37,000 and hematocrit of 26.

Her peripheral smear revealed an increased number of monocytes
and monoblasts with dysplastic neutrophils. She [**Known lastname 1834**] a bone

marrow biopsy, which was consistent with acute monocytic
leukemia. Cytogenetics were normal. She was initially started on

Hydrea, allopurinol and hydration and then started on induction
chemotherapy with high-dose daunorubicin and ARA-C on protocol
E1900. With recovery of her counts, Mrs. [**Known lastname 57565**] was discharged

and overall tolerated her induction therapy very well.

Repeat bone marrow biopsy from [**2150-10-7**] showed trilineage
hematopoiesis and 1% blasts, but no evidence of acute leukemia.
Ms. [**Known lastname 57565**] was then randomized to receive two cycles of
consolidation tx c high-dose ARA-C followed by autologous stem
cell txp c Mylotarg.

Ms.[**Known lastname 57565**] was admitted for her first cycle of consolidation
with HiDAC on [**2150-10-14**]; this admission proceeded without
complications.  She then received her second cycle of
consolidative therapy with high-dose ARA-C on [**2150-11-16**]. This
consolidation was complicated by fever and neutropenia as well
as increased dyspnea on exertion. CT scan of the chest showed
evidence of diffuse interstitial markings, which were felt
related to an infection or
CHF. Ms. [**Known lastname 57565**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] repeat echocardiogram, which
revealed an ejection fraction of 30% to 35% with new left
ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction. She was started
on medication management with lisinopril and Toprol per
cardiology.  Her decreased EF was thought secondary to high dose

anthracycline therapy.

A repeat exercise stress test in [**12/2150**] revealed an improvement
in her ejection fraction to 48%, which was also seen on cardiac
MRI imaging with an EF of 49%.
 Symptomatically, Ms. [**Known lastname 57565**] continued to improve with less
shortness of breath.  The plan for autologous txp was withdrawn
given her worsening CHF and the risk of further cardiac
toxicity.  She was withdrawn from the protocol with a plan for
allo-BMT from an unrelated donor if her disease worsened.

A drop in platelets in [**3-2**] precipitated a BM bx showing
relapsed leukemia.  She received a cycle of MEC chemotherapy in
[**4-1**] and her hospitalization was complicated by gram-negative
bacteremia.  Fever w/u included a chest CT showing atypical left

upper lobe infiltrate for which she was tx c fluconazole.  A
repeat CT scan of the chest did show improvement in the lesion
and a more recent CT scan of the chest on Friday [**2151-5-28**] showed

continued resolution of this presumed infection.

Repeat ECHO in [**5-2**] showed a decreased EF (30-35%) c global
hypokinesis of LV; she [**Month/Day (1) 1834**] RVG showing EF 50%.  She
continues to be dyspneac on exertion but does not c/o CHF
symptoms.

She presents for a non-myeloablative but immunoablative allo BMT

from a matching unrelated donor.  Her donor is male, CMV
positive and blood type A positive. Ms. [**Known lastname 57565**] is CMV negative

and blood type A positive.

Besdies persistent fatigue, the pt. reports performing many ADLs

independently and denies feves, rigors, CP, palpitations, SOB,
cough, congestion, sore throat.  She reports having her upper
teeth extracted two weeks ago and has had no bleeding/no
persistent pain after the procedure.  Her PO intake is good and
she denies N/V.  She denies increased bleeding, epistaxis, any
blood in the urine/stool.

Past Medical History:
