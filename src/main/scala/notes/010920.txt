Brief Hospital Course:
# Mental Status Change: Differential includes ETOH or benzo
withdrawal, toxidrome, or NMS. Head CT negative on admission
supporting toxic/metabolic process. No evidence of infection on
admission labs. Patient presenting outside the 72 hour window
for ETOH withdrawal if he truly has been in a monitored setting
since [**2142-10-8**] and ETOH level 0 at [**Hospital1 2025**]. No evidence of cholinergic
toxidrome on presentation. Slight increase in CK, but patient
has been significantly agitated and requiring restraints making
NMS less likely. Benzo withdrawal most likely as serum tox can
be negative and the withdrawal syndrome prolonged.
