Chief Complaint:
Fatigue, wide complex tachycardia, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
DC Cardioversion


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 71 year old female with DM, HTN, TIA, COPD, breast
ca, schizoaffective disorder nursing home patient transferred
from OSH after nursing home found her to be not feeling well and
in wide-complex tachycardia.  Patient states that she has
worsening cough productive of white sputum for a week and on day
of admission was feeling "lousy," tired and walking very slowly
with her walker.  She also felt nauseated, with mild abdominal
pain, but denied vomiting.  On arrival at [**Hospital1 18**], she was found
to be in wide complex tachycardia with K 5.9 and appeared blue
with cool extremities.  Patient has a history of AFib/flutter
for which she was recently started on propafenone.
     Per the patient's nurse practitioner ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 60965**]) the
patient was sent to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital two days prior to
admission because her heart rate was 120.  She had recently been
stopped on her Digoxin, but the NP was not sure why as she only
started following the patient in the past couple of weeks and
she was already off Dig and on propafenone at that time.  The NP
said that [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital sent the patient back after
having a head CT that was negative and heart rate was still
tachycardiac.  The NP increased the propafenone the following
day to try to improve rate control.  Her propafenone was
increased from 150 po q8h to 225 po q8h.  Digoxin was also
stopped approx 2 weeks prior. She had an EKG from 2 days prior
that was narrow complex and creatinine of 1.  On admission
creatinine noted to be 2.0 and INR 3.7.  EP consulted on the
patient and felt she was likely in AFib with left bundle branch
block and that her propafenone dose may have been too high
causing abnormal rhythm with hypoperfusion. The patient was
hyperkalemic (lactate 4.0) for which she was given 1 amp bicarb,
D50, 20 units insulin, 30 mg kayexalate.  ABG 7.40/40/272 on
non-rebreather.
     Of note, patient completed prednisone taper for presumed
COPD flare recently.  She completed 7 day course of Levoflox on
[**11-24**] (not sure what type of infection).

Imaging:
ECG [**2185-12-16**]: wide complex, irregular, likely atrial fibrillation
with left bundle branch block.
.
ECG [**2185-12-18**]: Sinus rhythm. First degree A-V heart block.
Intraventricular conduction delay. Marked anterolateral ST-T
wave changes - consider acute myocardial infarction. Compared to
the previous tracing no significant change.
.
CXR [**2185-12-16**]: Probable mild congestive heart failure. No focal
consolidation identified.
.
CXR [**2185-12-20**]:  There is new opacification in the right infrahilar
lung, depression of the right hilus and rightward mediastinal
shift.  This indicates a component of atelectasis in the lower
lobe but given the clinical history this is concerning for
possible pneumonia with retained secretions, as well. Small
right pleural effusion is new or newly apparent.  Left lung is
clear. Mild cardiomegaly is stable.  Tip of the left subclavian
line projects over the SVC.
.
ECHO [**2185-12-16**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis with
dysnchronous contraction pattern.The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Biventricular dysnchronous contraction pattern with
right ventricular cavity enlargement c/w diffuse process (IVCD,
etc.).
.
ECHO [**2185-12-19**]:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is
elongated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Very mild
(Tr- 1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
6. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 71yo F with DM, HTN, TIA, COPD, breast ca,
schizoaffective d/o transferred from OSH with wide complex
tachycardia and hypotension from propafenone toxicity with
resultant ARF and shock liver, now nearly resolved.
.
# CV:
* Rhythm - The patient presented with a wide complex tachycardia
which was an organized atrial flutter with wide complex [**12-22**]
propafenone toxicity. She was acutely managed with volume
resuscitation and sodium antagonism with normal saline. She was
cardioverted into NSR [**2185-12-17**].  After cardioversion it was noted
that her PR interval was prolonged and she continued to have
memory T wave changes. She was continued on telemetry and had no
arrhthymias. She was placed on a heparin gtt as a bridge to a
therapeutic INR on coumadin (INR goal >2.0). She has not yet
achieved a therapeutic INR and is being discharg
