IMAGING:

CT head [**11-20**]: Large right scalp hematoma and laceration with
hyperdense foci within this region concerning for foreign
bodies. Extension of hematoma and laceration in to the right
eyelid. Small hyperdensity along the left frontal sulcus may
represent a small subarachnoid hemorrhage and less likely
artifact or vessel.

CT c-spine [**11-20**]: There is a small osseous fragment adjacent to
the C3 vertebral body which may represent a chip fracture of the
anterior osteophyte of indeterminate chronicity. No acute
fracture identified.
CT torso [**11-20**] (wet read):

1. Right perihepatic fluid with [**Doctor Last Name **] 61 concerning for
hemoperitoneum. No definite obvious liver laceration, however
subtle contour irregularity along the liver dome may be present.
Additionally, on liver windows hypodensity in right liver lobe
may suggest contusion. There is stranding around the right
adrenal gland which may suggest right adrenal gland injury in
the setting of right liver subtle contusion.
2. Right 8th rib fracture.
3. Bilateral lung opacitieis may represent atelectasis vs fluid
vs blood in setting of trauma.
5. Air colleciton in anterior mediastinum (602b, 51).
Xray knee [**11-20**]: No fracture or dislocation.
CT head [**11-20**] repeat (wet read): Unchanged left frontal
subarachnoid hemorrhage, streak-like parafalcine subdural
hematoma and right frontoparietal subgaleal hematoma.

Brief Hospital Course:
Her ICU as follows:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 6818**] was admitted to the Acute Care Surgery Service from
ED to TSICU. Neurosurgery consulted for the subarachnoid
hemorrhage and felt that given the small size of the bleed that
no further intervention warranted. A repeat head CT scan was
done and remained stable. Scalp laceration was repaired at the
bedside by plastic surgery and she was started on Ancef per
plastics recommendations. Repeat head CT grossly unchanged and
she received multiple IV fluid boluses for hypotension with MAP
in 50s.  Her pressures subsequently stabilized and she was
extubated on HD 2.  There was no evidence of C-spine fracture on
imaging, C-spine was cleared clinically. Antibiotics for the
open scalp laceration were discontinued. Given falling
hematocrit and her inability to receive blood transfusions due
to religious beliefs, she was started on iron, Epogen and
multivitamin supplementation. Once stabilized and improvement in
her mental status she was transferred to the regular surgical
unit.

Her floor course as follows:
She continued to progress slowly once transferred out of the
unit to the floor. The scalp JP drain was removed and it was
recommended that a topical antibiotic be used. She will follow
up within 1 week after discharge in Plastic surgery clinic.

She was noted with pain control issues requiring adjustment of
her pain medications so that at time of discharge she is on an
oral regimen with adequate control of her pain.

Upon return to the surgical floor, her swallowing ability was
re-addressed by Speech and Swallow and she was cleared for
regular diet including liquids and pills. She has been
tolerating a regular diet without any problems.

The decision was made to continue with weekly Epogen injections
with the expectation that once she is out of her acute injury
phase and has stable hematocrits it can be discontinued.

She was seen and evaluated by Physical therapy and
recommendations made for discharge to a rehabilitation following
her acute hospital stay.

Her vital signs are stable and she is afebrile. Her white blood
count is 5.3 and her hematocrit is 27.5, her total bili is 0.4.
  She is tolerating a regular diet and voiding without
difficulty.  She is preparing for discharge with instructions to
follow up with Plastic Surgery for removal of her sutures.
