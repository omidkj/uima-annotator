Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old male with progressive CKD, diastolic heart failure,
BPH with LUTS, multiple recent hospitalizations with decrease in
functional capacity, now living in hospice facility, admitted
with 2weeks of SOB, 1 week of NP[**MD Number(3) **]/rhonchi, fevers,
depressed MS. Febrile in ER, hypoxic, required NRB, CXR with b/l
effusions and possible PNA, admitted to MICU [**10-7**]. Per family,
pt was getting around the clock morphine/ativan and was kept
sedated at nursing home so likely aspirated. He was started on
Vanc/Zosyn, mental status improved greatly by the next day and
transfered to the floor [**10-8**] on face mask. Sputum culture grew
MSSA so his abx were changed to augmentin for total 7day course.
 By next day, he was remarkably better, weaned off O2,
tolerating PO, A&Ox3, getting up to chair.

He was also volume overloaded and was started on IV Lasix. He
was persistently net positive so his Lasix was titrated up to
100mg IV bid and Zaroxolyn was added. This may be continued as
necessary in order to achieve additional diuresis as necessary
and then may be switched to a PO regimen. He had a Foley
catheter that was removed on the day of discharge and he voided;
however, if he should be monitored for urinary retention and a
Foley should be replaced as necessary. His Toprol XL was stopped
on admission, and he was started on metoprolol at low dose on
the floor. This may also be titrated back up to his
pre-hospitalization dose of 100mg daily as tolerated.

Palliative care was consulted to discuss goals of care with the
family. They have decided that he would want a higher level of
care than he was receiving at his hospice facility and that
simple treatable conditions should be addressed as appropriate.
Lab draws and vital signs should be kept to a minimum as able,
and if he were to experience a sudden decompensation, goals of
care would shift to comfort and a hospice discussion could then
be re-initiated.
