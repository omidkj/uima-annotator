Pertinent Results:
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. No mass/thrombus is seen in
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. The left atrial
appendage emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There is concentric LVH.

Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.

There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch and in the
descending thoracic aorta.

The aortic valve is not well seen. By history, a [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 923**]
bileaflet mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is present. There
is symmetrical filling of the aortic root in systole suggesting
normally mobile aortic valve leaflets. There is trace AI in the
area of the right coronary sinus. There is a space seen in
adjacent to the non-coronary sinus which expands with systole,
suggestive of coronary sinus aneurysm.

The A2 portion of the anterior mitral leaflet is flail. A
ruptured chord to this segment is seen. There is severe (4+)
mitral regurgitation directed posteriorly with coanda effect.
There is systolic reversal of pulmonary venous flow, suggestive
of severe MR.

There is a very small pericardial effusion.

POST-CPB
There is a bileaflet mechanical prosthetic valve in the mitral
position. The valve is well seated with normally mobile
leaftlets. The peak gradient across the prosthetic mitral valve
is 15mmHG, the mean gradient is 7mmHg, with a CO of 6.6. A small
jet of MR was initially seen along the sewing ring at the
one-o'-clock position which resolved with protamine
administration. Normal washing jets are seen.

The prosthetic aortic valve appears to function normally,
unchanged from preop. The peak and mean gradients are 57mmHg and
28mmHg, respectively, which may reflect increased forward flow.

There is mild TR and trivial PI. Biventricular systolic function
appear normal. There is concentric LVH, unchanged. The simple
atheroma in the descending aorta and distal arch are stable from
preop. There is no evidence of dissection.

These findings were communicated to Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] intraoperatively
at the time the study was performed.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

HISTORY: MVR, to evaluate sternal wires.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**12-19**], the sternal
wires remain
intact. There is continued substantial enlargement of the
cardiac silhouette
with increasing opacification at the right base consistent with
pleural
effusion and underlying compressive atelectasis. There is also
evidence of
increased pulmonary venous pressure.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**2150-12-11**] for heparin bridge from coumadin due to
mechanical aortic valve.  She underwent her preoperative which
included a transesophageal echocardiogram for evaluation of
mitral valve.  On [**12-15**] she was brought to the operating room
and underwent mitral valve replacement.  See operative report
for further details.  She received vancomycin for perioperative
antibiotics however was noted to have rash in the intensive care
unit and was treated with benadryl and pepcid, vancomycin was
discontinued and was placed on cefazolin for perioperative
antibiotic coverage.  In the first twenty four hours she was
weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact, and was
extubated without complications.  She was started on
betablockers and gently diuresed.  Coumadin was started post
operative day one and all lines and wires removed on post
operative day two.  She continued to progress and physical
therapy worked with her on strength and mobility.  She continued
to progress, however had episodes of atrial fibrillation and her
digoxin was restarted and betablockers increased.  She was ready
for discharge to [**Hospital1 1474**] TCU on POD #9. First blood draw for
INR check tomorrow [**12-25**]. Target INR 2.5-3.0.
All f/u appts were advised.
