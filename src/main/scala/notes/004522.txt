Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 15397**]
Chief Complaint:
cholecystitis, transfer from [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital MICU for ERCP

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP

History of Present Illness:
86M with CAD s/p DES to LAD x 4 in [**1-/2180**], TIA s/p CEA in [**2179**],
and h/o failed laparascopic cholecystectomy [**2178**] with
nonvisualization of gallbladder on [**9-20**] abdominal [**Hospital 4338**]
transferred from [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital on [**9-22**] after failed ERCP on
[**9-21**] for cholangitis complicated by gram-negative bacteremia.

Briefly, the patient present to [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital on [**9-20**] with
severe abdominal pain worsened by inspiration and was found to
be febrile to 102.7, tachycardic to HR 130s, and have
significant LFT abnormalities (lipase 6391, T.bili 1.7, D. bili
1.3, AST 281, ALT 134, AP 285). He was initially placed on BiPap
and received Lasix 100mg IV in the ED for his respiratory
distress; Bipap was quickly discontinued and the patient
received Zosyn, IVF, and pain medication (morphine 2mg IV x 1)
with significant improvement in his abdominal pain. He was
transferred to the [**Location (un) 8641**] MICU for further management. He had
some hypotension to SBP 90s on the night of admission, however
he never required pressor support. [**9-21**] Blood cultures revealed
GNRs in 4 of 4 bottles; spec/[**Last Name (un) 36**] are pending. The patient had
an attempted ERCP [**9-21**] which was aborted as the ERCP scope was
unable to be passed into the second part of the duodenum
secondary to a significant stricture of the duodenal bulb, just
before the D1/D2 junction. Also noted were a medium-sized hiatal
hernia, as well as an oozing superficial duodenal ulcer in the
bulb with no stigmata of recent bleeding. Given that the patient
is on Plavix (last dose 8/24 AM), it was decided to hold off on
dilating the stricture and transfer him to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management of his cholangitis. Patient reportedly tolerated the
procedure well, but had some post-procedure wheezing that was
treated with bronchodilators. On transfer, the patient's BPs had
improved to 120s/50s-60s. Labs on discharge were lipase 1313,
T.bili 3.6, D.bili 3.0, AST 161, ALT 126, AP 210, LDH 262. Blood
cultures growing GNRs (prelim) were still pending.

Of note, the patient's gallbladder was not visualized on either
abdominal ultrasound or MRCP on [**9-20**]. He had an attempted
laparascopic cholecystectomy in [**2178**] which was aborted due to
extensive adhesions, but he and his family are certain that he
has not had his gallbladder removed. GI consult at [**Location (un) 8641**]
suggested that he might have a congenital atrophic gallbladder
or he might have had recurrent attacks of acute cholecystitis
causing him to have significant fibrosis and shrinking of the
gallbladder. There are no clips in the gallbladder fossa to
suggest prior cholecystectomy.

On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], VS were: T 98.1, 151/71, HR 76, SpO2
96%RA, RR 15. The patient appears jaundiced but comfortable and
denies any abdominal pain.


Past Medical History:
- CAD s/p DES (Xience) to LAD x 4 in [**2180**] (reportedly performed
at [**Hospital3 **], EF 45%)
- TIA [**8-/2179**] s/p right carotid endarterectomy [**10/2179**]: no
significant residual deficits. Most recently had an episode of
amaurosis fugax in spring [**2182**] & saw his neurologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 6692**],
who did carotid dopplers on [**2182-5-30**] that showed severe bilateral
ICA disease >70% bilaterally. Patient has been managed medically
with Plavix.
- H/o cholecystitis s/p failed laparascopic cholecystectomy in
[**2178**]. Reportedly surgeon was unable to perform procedure because
of [**Last Name (un) **] adhesions around the gallbladder; unclear why procedure
was not converted to open.
- Hypertension
- Hyperlipidemia
- S/p right inguinal herniorhapy x 3 with 3rd operation
requiring removal of his right testicle ([**2140**])
- Meniere's disease with recent complaints of refractory
dizziness earlier this summer [**2182**]
- Tinnitus (likely related to Meniere's)
- Hearing loss in left ear
- Seizure disorder on low-dose Tegretol (did not tolerate switch
to Keppra; high-dose Tegretol has been associated with cognitive
slowing). EEG showed L temporal seizure activity. Most recent
"spell" of transient confusion (attributed to seizure activity)
occured in [**2182-4-28**].
- GERD
- BPH
- Asthma



Social History:

previously, but has not had alcohol for the past 5 years.
Widowed. Previously worked for GE. Lives full-time in an

Walks with a cane.



Family History:
Father with CAD.

IMAGING

CT ABD/PELV WITH CONT
1.  Atypical appearance of the gallbladder and extrahepatic bile
ducts.  An atrophic and severely collapsed gallbladder may be
present versus a markedly thick walled cystic duct remnant.  The
point of convergence of the cystic duct and CHD is difficule to
ascertain but the segment of duct presumed to represent the CBD
is diffusely and markedly thick walled and heterogeneous. This
may relate to chronic inflammatory change, cholangitis or
neoplasm (i.e. cholangiocarcinoma). No intrahepatic biliary
ductal dilatation.  Recommend further evaluation with ERCP and
brushings.
2.  Second portion of duodenum appears markedly collapsed or
atrophic, but no mass identified in this region.
3.  Hiatal hernia containing GE junction and transdiaphragmatic
herniation of hepatic dome which appears to be exerting a degree
of mass effect on the
cephalad IVC.
4.  Atrophic pancreas without surrounding inflammatory change.
No pancreatic mass or pancreatic duct dilatation identified.  No
focal or free fluid identified within the abdomen.
5.  Mild-to-moderate atherosclerotic narrowing of the ostia of
the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries.
6.  Mild compression deformity of the superior endplate of T11.
7.  Trace bilateral pleural effusions.

ERCP:
A medium size hiatal hernia was seen, displacing the Z-line to
35 cm from the incisors, with hiatal narrowing at 40 cm from the
incisors.
A salmon colored mucosa distributed in a segmental pattern,
suggestive of short segment Barrett's Esophagus was found. The
Z-line was at 35 cm from the incisors and the upper end of the
gastric folds started at 38 cm from the incisors. Cold forceps
biopsies were performed for histology.
Exam of the stomach was normal.
A benign intrinsic stricture was
