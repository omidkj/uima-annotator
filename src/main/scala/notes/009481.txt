Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2133-4-24**]  CABG x4 (LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM, SVG to DIAG, SVG to
PDA)/
MV repair (26 mm [**Company 1543**] ring)/ left carotid endarterectomy
[**2133-5-7**] sternal wound debridement
[**2133-5-13**] Debridement of bilateral pectoralis musculocutaneous
advancement flap.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 59 year old female with known CAD (50% LMCA, TO
mRCA, and 90% mLCx), CHF (EF 40%,) DM, HTN, HL, and tobacco who
presents with complaints of chest pain. The patient had two
prior admissions for heart failure in the end of [**2132**]. A TTE
during those hospitalizations showed new inferior WMA and a
reduced EF. A PMIBI confirmed a new severe fixed inferolateral
defect with the left
ventricle also demonstrating inferolateral akinesis and a
reported ejection fraction of 28%. The patient was reffered by
her PCP to cardiology for evaluation of cardiac catherization.
In [**1-30**], the patient underwent an elective diagnosic cardiac
catheterization, which demonstrated a totally occluded mRCA,
diffusly diseased LAD, 90% mLCx, and a 50% discrete LMCA lesion.
The patient was reffered to CT surgery for possible CABG. In the
interim, the plan was to optimize the patients modifiable risk
factors.
The patient represented in early [**3-30**] with complaints of chest
pain. She was having frequent chest pain with activity. Her
cardiac markers were cycled negative, EKG showed non-specific TW
changes. CT surgery was consulted. The option of bypass surgery
was discussed with patient. The discharge summary from that
admission indicated that the patinet opted to continue medical
management at this time, however the patient says that the team
had decided that surgery wasn't an option. Review of scanned
records show that decision prefered to [**Hospital 81920**] medical Rx, and if
failed, then surgery. The patient was discharged with a new
prescription for imdur.
Since discharge, the patient has responded well to the imdur,
and has not had any angina. On the night of presentation, the
patient was watching TV, when she began to develop a banding
chest pressure. The quality of the pain was similar to prior
angina, but more intense, without radiation. She was becoming
increasingly more uncomfortable. She took 2 SLNG, without any
relief. EMS was activated, who provided an additional 2 SLNG
with complete resolution of pain. She has been chest pain free
since. She denies any associated N/V, diaphoresis,
lightheadedness, or palpitation. She hasn't had any recent
orthopnea, PND, or LE edema. The patient was taken to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further manegement.
.
On presentation to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vitals were 98 95
151/84 100 on RA. Her first set of cardiac markers showed a
slighly elevated trop at 0.04, flat CK. EKG reportedly unchanged
from prior. She was given 25mg of PO metoprolol, started on a
heparin gtt. She remained CP free. She is now admitted to [**Hospital1 1516**]
service for further manegement.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Conclusions
Prebypass
1. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.

2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild to
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesia of the apex, apical and mid portions of the inferior
wall, inferior septum and inferolateral walls. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40% %).


3.Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.

4.There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

5. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.

6. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

7. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on
[**2133-4-24**] at 1000am.

Post bypass

1. Patient is in sinus rhythm and receiving an infusion of
phenylephrine.

2. Biventricular function is unchanged.

3. Annuloplasty ring seen in the mitral position. Appears well
seated and there is no mitral stenosis or regurgitation. There
is no [**Male First Name (un) **].

4. Aorta is intact post decannulation.
