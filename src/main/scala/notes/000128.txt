[**2196-12-2**] Cardiac echo : The left atrium is elongated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with basal inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis.
The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 45%). There is
no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately
dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
c/w CAD. Dilated aortic root.

[**2196-12-2**] Right
These radiographs are significantly limited by positioning and
overlying cast. There is an oblique comminuted fracture of the
humerus,
however the full extent is not clearly assessed on these images.


[**2196-12-4**] Chest CTA : 1. Small segmental pulmonary embolism at the
right middle lobe branch. No evidence of pulmonary infarcts.
2. Increased left lower lobe patchy opacity, nonspecific, could
represent,
atelectasis, aspiration or consolidation.

[**2196-12-5**] Non invasive venous studies both lower extremities :
  Deep vein thrombosis seen in the left popliteal vein.

[**2196-12-5**] Carotid studies : < 40% stenoses B/L ICA's

[**2196-12-7**] MRI C spine : 1. No evidence of ligamentous disruption
or marrow edema in the vertebral bodies.
2. Multilevel degenerative changes with mild spinal stenosis at
C2-3 and C3-4 with minimal extrinsic indentation on the spinal
cord and mild-to-moderate spinal stenosis at C5-6 level.
Foraminal changes as above.





Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was evaluated by the Trauma service in the Emergency
Room and admitted to the hospital for further evaluation
including a syncopal work up.  The Orthopedic service placed a
[**Last Name (un) 8688**] brace on his right shoulder for closed treatment of
his humeral fracture and the Spine service wanted his C7-T1
anterolisthesis further imaged with MRI.  F/u MRI without
contrast showed no evidence of ligamentous disruption or marrow
edema in the vertebral bodies but a possible collection anterior
to the T-spine.  F/u MRI w/wo contrast showed no collection.

His carotid studies showed < 40% ICA stenosis bilaterally and
his Cardiac echo revealed an EF of 45% with basal inferior and
inferolateral hypokinesis.  He denied any dizziness, chest pain
or shortness of breath but on [**2196-12-3**] became hypoxic and
developed rapid atrial fibrillation and was subsequently
transferred to the ICU for further management.

A chest CTA revealed a pulmonary embolism in the RML branch and
venous studies documented a left popliteal DVT.  He was placed
on IV Heparin and Coumadin was started.  His oxygenation
improved with pulmonary toilet.  He never required reintubation.
 His chest Xray showed some LLL consolidation and he was briefly
placed on antibiotics however when the diagnosis of PE was made
the antibiotics were discontinued.

The Geriatric service followed the patient closely during his
admission and assisted with management of his PAF which was
eventually controlled with maximizing his beta blockers.  His
Coumadin was adjusted to maintain an INR of 2.5 - 3.0.

The Ortho Spine service followed Mr. [**Known lastname **] during his course
and based on his MRI recommended that he wear a [**Location (un) 2848**] J collar
for 2 weeks and follow up then for another exam and possibly
more Xrays.

Physical therapy saw the patient and recommended short term
rehabilitation.

On the day of discharge, the patient was tolerating regular
diet, having bowel movements and flatus, and his pain was
well-controlled with PO pain medications.  He will need to have
further voiding trials at rehabilitation and is going with a
foley in place.
