BAND REACTIVITY PATTERN             INTERPRETATION
NO REACTIVE BANDS PRESENT. OR          NEGATIVE
REACTIVITY TO THE HSOD BAND ONLY.

REACTIVITY TO ANY SINGLE HCV
ANTIGEN BAND. OR                     INDETERMINATE
REACTIVITY TO ANY HCV ANTIGEN
BAND AND TO THE HSOD BAND.

REACTIVITY TO AT LEAST TWO             POSITIVE
HCV ANTIGEN BANDS WHICH ARE
ENCODED BY DIFFERENT PARTS
OF THE HCV GENOME.

THE HSOD BAND IS A CONTROL FOR THE DETECTION OF
NON-SPECIFIC REACTIVITY.

IT IS NOW KNOWN THAT THE HEPATITIS C VIRUS ( HCV)
IS THE CAUSE OF MOST CASES OF NON-A, NON-B
HEPATITIS ( NANBH).  HOWEVER, PATIENTS WITH NANBH
WHO ARE NEGATIVE FOR ANTI-HCV, EVEN AFTER
PROLONGED FOLLOW-UP, [**Month (only) **] HAVE ANOTHER VIRAL OR
NONVIRAL CAUSE FOR THE LIVER INJURY. IT IS ALSO
POSSIBLE THAT THE PATIENT [**Month (only) **] HAVE HEPATITIS C BUT
LACK, OR NOT YET HAVE DEVELOPED (DUE TO EARLY
INFECTION), OR HAVE RESOLVED AN ANTIBODY RESPONSE
DETECTABLE BY THE ASSAYS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THE
RIBA HCV 3.0 STRIP IMMUNOBLOT ASSAY (SIA) IS
LIMITED TO THE DETECTION OF ANTI-HCV IN HUMAN
SERUM AND PLASMA. THE PRESENCE OF ANTI-HCV IS
INDICATIVE OF PAST OR PRESENT INFECTION BY THE
HEPATITIS C VIRUS, BUT DOES NOT ALWAYS NECESSARILY
CONSTITUTE A DEFINITIVE DIAGNOSIS.

ALL PATIENTS THAT HAVE INDETERMINATE RESULTS
SHOULD BE MONITORED FOR AT LEAST 6 TO 12 MONTHS
TO DETERMINE IF FURTHER ANTIBODY RESPONSE HAS
DEVELOPED.  A PATIENT SPECIMEN THAT HAS TESTED
REACTIVE BY A LICENSED ANTI-HCV SCREENING
PROCEDURE THAT IS FOUND TO BE NEGATIVE BY RIBA
HCV 3.0 SIA DOES NOT EXCLUDE THE PATIENT FROM THE
POSSIBILITY OF INFECTION WITH HCV.
