Chief Complaint:
ICD firing x2.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Ventricular Tachycardia ablation


History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 108925**] is an 82 year old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy
(EF 30-35% in [**2172**]), coronary artery disease, status post CABG
in 93 and multiple coronary interventions, status post ICD
implantation and upgrade to biventricular ICD, presenting with 2
episodes of ICD firing this morning.  It felt like a punch in
his chest.  The first episode woke him from sleep and the second
one occurred about a 1/2 hour later.  The patient denied feeling
unwell, lightheaded, dizzy or fainting.  He denied any chest
pain or pressure, SOB or dyspnea on exertion.  He had been
feeling well overall.  He has never felt a shock before.
However, he says he was told by his physician that his ICD had
fired in the past, but he did not feel it at that time.  He
reports stable DOE at baseline and a 3lb weight gain.

In the ED, his initial VS were: 97.2 72 125/70 14 100% ra.  EP
was consulted and interrogated his pacer.  They found that he
has underlying AF and has had ~10 episodes of VT.  He
successfully paced out of all but 2, which required ICD firing.
In the ED, he was having more runs of VT 120-130, but has been
hemodynamically stable.  He received a bolus of amiodarone 150mg
x1.  His most recent vitals are: HR 85, BP 130/88, RR 16 Sats
99% RA.

In the CCU, the patient felt well and was asymptomatic; however,
he developed continuous slow VT and the decision was made to
take him to the lab for an ablation. In the lab he underwent a
successful ablation of a single focus of VT in inferior left
ventricle close to his septum. After the procedure the VT was
non-inducible.  Patient is having a few PVCs.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 108925**] is a 82 yo male with a ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF
30-35% in [**2172**]), coronary artery disease, status post CABG in 93
and multiple coronary interventions, status post ICD
implantation and upgrade to biventricular ICD, presenting with 2
episodes of ICD firing this morning s/p EP ablation.

1. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient presents with 2 episodes
of ICD firing while at home 30 minutes apart.  There were no
preceding events or symptoms.  He came to the ED and his pacer
was interrogated. They found that he has underlying AF and has
had ~10 episodes of VT. He successfully paced out of all but 2,
which required ICD firing. He continued to have runs of VT
120-130 in the ED, but remained hemodynamically stable. He
received a bolus of amiodarone 150mg x1, but continued to have
slow VT in the CCU.  The decision was made to take him to the EP
lab for ablation.  In the lab he underwent a successful ablation
of a single focus of VT in inferior left ventricle close to his
septum. After the procedure the VT was non-inducible.  The
patient was continued on 200mg amiodarone and carvedilol
increased to 25 mg [**Hospital1 **].  The patient's groin site was
complicated by bleeding and hematoma after an episode of nauesa
and vomiting.  Pressure was applied for 30 minutes and bleeding
stopped.  Patient developped aneurysm in the cath insertion.
[**Hospital1 **] surgery was consulted and recommended thrombin
injection, which went succesfully on [**Hospital1 766**] [**2174-11-21**]. The
patient remained hemodynamically stable and had an episode of
slow VT that he was ATP paced out of.  The patient will continue
amiodarone 200mg daily and carvedilol 25mg [**Hospital1 **].

2.. Pseudoaneurysm: Patient underwent U/S on [**11-18**] that showed
2.8cm pseudoaneurysm.  He was evaluated by [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] surgery and
coumadin was held.  The patient's Hct was monitored and remained
stable.  He underwent on [**2174-11-21**] thrombin injection to repair
the pseudoaneurysm.

3. Acute on chronic anemia - The patient had a groin bleed on
[**11-15**] after nausea/vomiting following his ablation.  Pressure
was held for 30mins he remained hemodynamically stable.  The
patient Hct remained stable between 26-28.  The patient had no
further evidence of bleeding.  On [**11-17**] his Hct trended
