Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Right lower extremity weakness


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
79yo male w/ h/o CAD s/p MI, COPD, ankylosing spondylitis s/p
back surgery comes in s/p fall at home with right-sided
hemiparesis. He had a mechanical fall at home, tripping over
oxygen tubing at home onto his hands. He did not have pain
immediately following the fall. He had been feeling well
otherwise, and denies preceding dizziness, chest pain or
shortness of breath.
.
He went to [**Hospital3 3583**], arriving 11:30pm [**6-11**], where he had
stable vital signs and got Dilaudid 1mg x2, Zofran 8mg and 500cc
NS. He was found to have RLE paresis and was sent [**Hospital1 18**] for
spine surgery eval.
.
In the emergency room, initial vitals T 97.1 HR 83 BP 156/52 RR
16 98% 3L Nasal Cannula. Patient given multiple doses of
morphine for pain. MR spine showed C7-T1 fracture with
anterolisthesis and hematoma extending down to T10. Ortho spine
(Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1007**] felt that he was too high of surgical risk to go to
the OR. On [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] given one dose of DDAVP. UA positive for
glucose but no bacteria. Trop 0.01.
.
Per ortho: Has disruption of C7-T1 and hematoma extends down to
T10. Would have to decompress nearly entire. Would probably lose
3-4 liters of blood in the best case scenario. Surgery could be
lethal. Has previously refused CABG, saying he "never wants to
go under the knife again". Neuro exam currently stable. Has
potential, with brace and log-rolls, of avoiding surgery with
only RLE deficit. If neuro exam worsens, might alter
risk-benefit and may risk massive surgery.
.
On the floor, the patient is sleepy but arousable after multiple
doses of morphine. He is tired and does not want to discuss his
prognosis or decisions regarding surgery. He refers all
decisions regarding his care to his wife, [**Name (NI) **]. [**Name2 (NI) **] denies recent
cough, dyspnea, chest pain, N/V, F/C, diarrhea or constipation.
He did have a recent COPD flare [**2191-6-3**] for which he was treated
with antibiotics and steroids. He is currently on 10mg
prednisone daily, and was to go to 5mg daily tomorrow.


Past Medical History:
1. Coronary artery disease s/p MI [**2191-3-17**] with "60% blockage" of
left main?, recommended to have CABG, but patient declined.
2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on 2L home O2.
3. Ankylosing spondylitis, s/p T11-T12 fracture requiring
surgical reduction [**2187-12-9**]. Post-op course c/b difficulty
weaning from the vent, resulting in trach/PEG and prolonged
rehab course.
4. Systolic congestive heart failure, daily weights have been
stable, last EF in [**2186**] 35-40%
5. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
6. Peripheral vascular disease, chronic pain with walking
7. Hypercholesterolemia
8. Obstructive sleep apnea, not on home CPAP
9. s/p cholecystectomy


Social History:
Lives with his wife. At baseline can walk up a flight of stairs,
recently had to pause half way up.

- Alcohol: occasional
- Illicits: none

C-spine [**6-13**] pending
MR spine [**6-12**]
MR CERVICAL, THORACIC AND LUMBAR SPINE.

HISTORY: Difficulty moving right lower extremity status post
fall.

Sagittal imaging was performed through the entire spine using
long TR, long TE
fast spin echo, STIR, and short TR, short TE spin echo
technique. Axial
imaging was performed with gradient echo technique in the
cervical spine and
long TR, long TE fast spin echo technique in the thoracic and
lumbar spines.
Comparison to T-spine CT studies of [**2191-6-12**].

FINDINGS: There appears to be a fracture of the superior portion
of the T1
vertebral body, also involving the inferior C7 body. There is
wedging of the
T1 and discontinuity of the anterior margins of the vertebral
bodies at this
location. There is hyperintensity in the C6 vertebral body on
the STIR images
without definite evidence of fracture. There is hyperintensity
in the C6-C7
and C7-T1 intervertebral discs, compatible with acute trauma.
There is faint
hyperintensity on STIR images in the posterior ligamentous
complex at C6,
compatible with the spinous process fracture seen on the CT.
There is
extensive prevertebral fluid, presumably hemorrhage. There
appears to be
intraspinal hemorrhage posterior to the spinal cord at the level
of the
ligamentous injury, with unclear extent within the spinal canal.
At a
minimum, this appears to be present at the C5 through C7 levels,
but may
extend farther inferiorly into the thoracic spinal canal.

The patient has classic imaging findings of ankylosing
spondylitis and has
undergone posterior fusion with rods and pedicle screws from
T7-T12.

Images of the lumbar spine demonstrate changes of ankylosing
spondylitis with no evidence of fracture or abnormalities
encroaching on the spinal canal.

There appears to be a defect in the T11 vertebral body. There is
no evidence of encroachment on the spinal canal or spinal cord
at this level and no evidence of hemorrhage.

CONCLUSION:
1. Unstable-appearing cervical spine fracture with disruption of
the C6-C7
intervertebral level, the C7 inferior vertebral body, and the
superior T1
body. Extensive prevertebral soft tissue fluid. Hyperintensity
in the
posterior ligamentous complex suggesting fracture. Intraspinal
fluid
collection, presumably epidural hematoma, posterior to the
spinal cord at this
level.
2. Hyperintensity and apparent fracture of the superior portion
of the T11
body, without evidence of hemorrhage.
3. Ankylosing spondylitis, status post lower thoracic spine
fusion.

ECG
Baseline artifact. Probable sinus rhythm. P-R interval
prolongation.
Intraventricular conduction delay of right bundle-branch block
type with marked left axis deviation. Consider left anterior
fascicular block. Since the previous tracing of [**2191-6-12**]
differences may be due to artifact. Otherwise, findings are
unchanged.

[**6-15**] CXR: Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in
comparison to [**2191-6-13**]. The patient's head obscures lung
apices . Heart size, mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
There is interval resolution of pulmonary edema.  Multiple
noncalcified pleural plaques are noted bilaterally.

# Spinal fracture and hematoma: Patient initially admitted to
MICU with right lower extremity paresis. Patient received Q1h
neuro checks. Paresis of left lower extremity developed
overnight. Rest of neuro exam remained stable with the exception
of some improvement in ability to move left toes with time. MRI
showed unstable C6-T1 spinal fracture with posterior epidural
hematoma. Given dexamethasone 8mg Q8hrsX1
