.
[**2163-6-13**] CHEST CT W/O CONTRAST: 1. Dependent lower lobe
consolidation and ground-glass attenuation accompanied by
multilobar, diffuse bronchiolitis (tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] pattern),
consistent with diffuse infectious process. In the setting of
hiatal hernia, aspiration pneumonia is also possible. 2.
Tracheobronchomalacia difficult to quantify due to lack of
standardized breathing instructions. If warranted clinically,
once the patient's acute infection has resolved, dedicated CT
trachea could be obtained to better assess this finding. 3.
Emphysema. 4. Increased number of mediastinal lymph nodes,
likely hyperplastic in the setting of acute infection. These
could also be reassessed at the time of followup CT. 5. Diffuse
coronary artery calcifications. 6. Small cystic lesions in the
liver and kidneys, incompletely characterized. These could be
more fully characterized by ultrasound if warranted clinically.
.
[**2163-6-13**] ECHO: EF = 50%. The left atrium is dilated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferolateral
akinesis/hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is mildly depressed. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:

# Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Initially the patient was
admitted to the MICU but not intubated. The CT was consistent
with viral pneumonia, although bacterial could not be excluded.
Sputum gram stain showed gram positive cocci. PCP was negative,
as was legionella urinary antigen. He received azithromycin and
ceftriaxone, ceftriaxone was later d/c, and he was discharged to
complete a 10 day course of antibiotics with cefpodoxime. He was
treated with solumedrol IV, then prednisone taper to achieve his
home dose of 10 mg in 2 weeks. He was given nebulizer treatment
as needed.
   CHF was initially on the differential, however BNP was not
elevated. An echo showed a mildly decreased EF from baseline (
50%). A PE was never strongly in the differential due to the
patient's elevated INR>3.
.
# CHF: Echo showed mild systolic dysfunction. Responded well to
lasix x 1. He was continued on HCTZ and spironolactone.
.
# Afib: Continued beta blocker. He was supratherapeutic on
coumadin>3, therefore coumadin was held. On [**6-15**], INR <2,
therefore coumadin restarted at 2 mg hs, with close follow up at
discharge.
.
# HTN: ACE was initially held in view of high creatinine, then
restarted.
.
# CAD: No e/o active ischemia. Continued ASA, anticoagulated, on
BB, on telemetry with no significant events.
.
# ARF:  Prerrenal, creatinine improved with hydration. (1.7 to
1.1)
.
# Hyperlipidemia: continued statin
.
# Chronic Pain: continued fentanyl, neurontin, oxycodone for
breakthrough.
.
# Psych: continued zoloft
.
# Allergies: seasonal, continued [**Doctor First Name 130**]
.
# FEN: [**Doctor First Name **]/cardiac diet, monitor lytes. Needed potassium
repletion daily.
.
# PPX: Bowel regimen, anticoagulated, PPI, OOB to chair
