Service:

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 81-year-old
female with known coronary artery disease documented in [**2182**]
with an ejection fraction of approximately 30-35%, who had
been managed medically and was living an active lifestyle.
She had been experiencing some chest pain and worsening
shortness of breath and orthopnea.

On the night prior to admission, the patient had worsening
chest pain and presented to the emergency room for
evaluation.  Upon arrival, she complained of chest pain and
the electrocardiogram showed new lateral ST depressions
concerning for acute ischemia.  Her cardiac enzymes were
positive for a CK leak with a troponin of 43.  Her chest
x-ray was consistent with congestive heart failure.  The
patient was given sublingual nitroglycerin, morphine, beta
blockers and aspirin and was started on a heparin drip.  The
cardiology service was consulted and the patient was taken
for a cardiac catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The past medical history was
significant for coronary artery disease with previous
echocardiograms documenting an ejection fraction of 30-35%,
hypertension, colon cancer status post partial colectomy,
partial deafness and right eye blindness secondary to eyeball
rupture.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Her medications at home included
aspirin, Lipitor, Zestril, Lopressor, Fosamax, nortriptyline
and Imdur.

ALLERGIES:  The patient had no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lived at home with her husband,
who was also very active per her primary care physician.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, the patient was
afebrile with vital signs stable.  The heart rate was 84 and
the blood pressure was in the 150s/70s.  The oxygen
saturation was 90-98% on a nonrebreather mask.  The heart had
a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
The lungs had crackles bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft,
nontender and nondistended.  The extremities revealed no
clubbing, cyanosis or edema with palpable dorsalis pedis
pulses.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the cardiac
catheterization laboratory and catheterization revealed
diffuse disease of the left anterior descending artery, a 40%
ostial lesion of the left main coronary artery, a 90%
proximal lesion of the left circumflex coronary artery and a
100% mid lesion of the right coronary artery.  An
intra-aortic balloon pump was placed, the patient was
transferred to the unit and the cardiac surgery service was
consulted.

On the following day, the intra-aortic balloon pump was
removed and the patient was managed medically and stabilized.
On [**2185-9-26**], the patient underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting times four.  She received a left internal mammary
artery graft to the left anterior descending artery and
saphenous vein grafts to the first obtuse marginal artery and
right posterolateral vein as a sequential graft as well as
another saphenous vein graft to the diagonal artery.

The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred
to the unit in stable condition.  The patient was maintained
on milrinone drip at 0.5 mg overnight, which was weaned on
the following day.  The patient was also extubated without
any problems and she was transferred to the floor on
postoperative day #1.

On postoperative day #2, the patient was noted to be
extremely stable as she remained afebrile with stable vital
signs.  She had mild hypertension and thus her Lopressor was
increased from 25 to 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.  Her Zestril was also
increased from 5 to 10 mg p.o. q.d.  Her chest tubes were
removed and the physical therapy service was consulted.  Upon
the physical therapy consultant's recommendation, it was
deemed that the patient would benefit best from a
rehabilitation stay.

On postoperative day #3, the patient remains afebrile with
stable vital signs.  Her blood pressure is well controlled
with a heart rate of 75 and a blood pressure of 100/50.  All
of her chest tubes and pacing wires have been removed.  The
patient is currently awaiting rehabilitation placement.  She
will discharged to rehabilitation, as soon as a
rehabilitation bed is available.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
Coronary artery disease, status post acute myocardial
infarction, status post coronary artery bypass grafting times
four.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.
Zestril 10 mg p.o. q.d.
Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. times five days.
K-Dur 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d. times five days.
Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
Percocet one to two tablets p.o. every four to six hours
p.r.n.
Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
Fosamax 10 mg p.o. q.d.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient will follow up in
rehabilitation.  She should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] in
approximately three weeks.  She should also follow up with
her primary care physician in approximately two weeks.
