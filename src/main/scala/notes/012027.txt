Service:  [**Doctor Last Name **]

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  [**Female First Name (un) 564**] peritonitis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 50-year-old male with
type 2 diabetes for 30 years and end-stage renal disease (on
peritoneal dialysis) who was at the [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation
but presented to the Emergency Department on [**1-5**] with
increasing abdominal pain, subjective fevers for two weeks,
decreased oral intake and urine output, as well as lethargy.

At [**Hospital1 **], he was found to be afebrile with a blood
pressure of 84/palp with a white blood cell count of 20.4
(with 85% polys and 7.9% lymphocytes), and a sodium of 128.
He also had a potassium of 3.8, a bicarbonate of 24, glucose
of 219, an albumin of 1.9, and a blood urea nitrogen of 35,
and a creatinine of 5.9.  A tap of the peritoneal fluid
revealed 360 white blood cells, 40 red blood cells (with 69%
polys, 23% monocytes, and 7% lymphocytes).

The patient was afebrile in the Emergency Department, but as
his systolic blood pressure remained in the 70s to 90s, he
was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  He
received ceftazidime and Flagyl in the Emergency Department.

In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, he received aggressive
intravenous fluid repletion and was started on cefotaxime 2
mg intravenously q.d. while continuing his peritoneal
dialysis.  When peritoneal cultures came back growing
Candidiasis albicans, the antibiotics were discontinued on
[**1-7**], and it was changed to fluconazole 200 mg
intravenously q.24h. through the dialysate on [**1-7**] and
flucytosine 2 mg times one orally initially and then changed
to 1 mg p.o. q.d. was added on [**1-8**].

In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, systolic blood pressures
were 90 to 110 with low oxygen saturations of 90% (question
secondary to increased amount of intravenous fluids he
received), so he was transferred to the floor on [**1-7**].
His white blood cell count had decreased to 11.8.  He had
remained afebrile with stable blood pressures.

He was then transferred to our Service on the [**Hospital Ward Name **]
([**Doctor Last Name **] Medicine), as he went to the operating room today
for peritoneal dialysis catheter removal (surgeon was Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
[**Name (STitle) **]) as well as Hickman replacement in order to undergo
hemodialysis tomorrow.  Blood cultures from [**1-5**] and
[**1-9**] were no growth to date.  Also, he recently bumped
his left foot stump and had some mild bleeding at the site
with some purulent fluid.  This was swabbed, and the culture
was sent on [**1-9**].  So far there has been no growth to
date.  He also has had asterixis with occasional
disorientation at times (per the previous team).

Today when we first met him (on [**1-10**]), he was status
post right Hickman placement and peritoneal dialysis removal,
doing well.  He states he has decreased abdominal pain today
compared to yesterday ([**11-9**] has decreased to [**5-10**] in
intensity).

He currently denies shortness of breath, chest pain,
dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.  He has not had a
bowel movement since [**1-5**] but is refusing to take
lactulose.  He denies headache, numbness, tingling, and pain
at the Hickman site or his legs.  He urinated one times
yesterday (usually goes twice per day).  He has some appetite
and is less confused now.
