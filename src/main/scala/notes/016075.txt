Allergies:
Cefazolin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 800**]
Chief Complaint:
Desaturation and change in mental status.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 76-year-old man with DM II, ESRD on HD via LUE AV
fistula, AAA, carotid disease, MSSA bacteremia of unclear
source, recently admitted for hypotension and complete heart
block treated with a permanent pacemaker.  Patient now returns
to [**Hospital1 18**] with aletered mental status and hypoxemia.  Was at his
usual HD session when O2 sat was noted to be 80% RA.  Was
reportedly having labored breathing.  Complained of an odd
feeling in his stomach.  Patient was only 1.5KG over dry weight,
so only small amount of fluid removed.  During hypoxemic
episode, patient initially required 5L NC.  Became increasinly
confused and changed to 100% NRB.  HD session was completed and
about 1L fluid was removed.  By report from the family, patient
was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital3 7362**] and discharged day
before admission for hypotension with demand ischemia.
According to family, patient has been confused intermittently
for several months.

In the ED, initial vs were: T98.0 HR 98 BP 122/77 RR 24 O2 100
on NRB.  Patient sleepy but appropriate.  No JVD, but accessory
muscle use.  Taking deep full breaths.  No murmur/gallop.  Belly
was soft but patient complained of abdominal pain.  LLE erythema
w/o tenderness. EKG -> sinus tachycardia w/ atrial sensing and
V-pacing.  Patient got aspirin 325 for troponin elevation, and
haldol 2.5mg IV x2 for agitation.

[**2200-3-19**] Non-contrast head CT:
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: Please note that evaluation is
significantly limited by head motion. Within that limitation,
there is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, edema, shift
of normally midline structures, or major vascular territorial
infarction. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is preserved.
A 6-mm hyperdense lesion at the foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**] appears stable
as compared to prior exams, consistent with a colloid cyst. This
appeared relatively less conspicuous on certain prior exams.
Prominent ventricles are essentially stable, without evidence of
acute hydrocephalus. Sulci are prominent, compatible with
age-related involutional change. There is extensive subcortical
and periventricular white matter hypoattenuation, consistent
with small vessel ischemic disease, unchanged. A hypodense focus
is noted in the right lentiform nucleus, consistent with lacune
versus prominent perivascular space. Within significant
limitation by motion artifacts, paranasal sinuses and mastoid
air cells appear relatively aerated.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Stable 6 mm colloid cyst and stable appearance of prominent
ventricle without evidence of hydrocephalus.
3. Extensive small vessel ischemic disease and age-related
involutional change.
.
CT [**2200-3-19**]:
IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of central pulmonary embolism. Limited evaluation
of the more peripheral pulmonary vasculature due to patient
respiratory motion.
2. Overall stable appearance of a fusiform AAA since [**Month (only) 404**]
[**2197**], continues to measure 5 cm in diameter. No evidence of
current rupture.
3. Extensive atherosclerotic vascular disease with two
penetrating thoracic aortic ulcers, one of which is increased in
size as compared to [**2197**].
4. Two 4-mm right middle lobe pulmonary nodular opacities are of
uncertain
chronicity without prior chest studies to compare. 12-month
followup is
recommended to document resolution or stability. Right lung base
linear
densities are unchanged since [**2198**], most consistent with chronic
fibrotic
changes.
5. Nonspecific mediastinal and axillary lymphadenopathy.
6. Perihepatic and perisplenic ascites.  Nodular liver contour
suggests
cirrhosis. Gynecomastia.
7. Heterogeneous-appearing thyroid with a possible subcentimeter
nodule and punctate calcification on the left. Findings could be
further evaluated on nonemergent ultrasound.
8. Nonspecific mild stable pancreatic ductal dilatation. No
obstructive or
mass lesion identified.
9. Atrophic kidneys consistent with history of end-stage renal
disease.
Unchanged occlusion of the left renal artery, unchanged since
[**2197**].
.
ECHO [**2200-3-24**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis
(LVEF = 35-40 %). The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root
is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic ste
