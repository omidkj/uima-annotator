Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p PEA arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
This is a 89 yo F w/ dementia and HTN who presents s/p PEA
arrest. She recently had a hip replacement 1 month ago and was
in rehab for this. Per her family she had low blood pressures
(SBP 80s) for 2 days. She had a witnessed collapse with no
pulse. CPR was started and EMS found her to be in slow PEA.
Patient given epi and atropine and intubated. She then developed
a narrow PEA upon arrival to OSH ED. She was given IVF bolus,
epi/atropine and pulses returned w/ BP 80s. She was started on
dopamine but then pulses were lost again. CPR and epi/atropine
were again initiated. ECG at that time showed HR of 140s with
RBBB. There was question if she had Vtach vs junctional rhythm
with RBB. Patient has not had RBBB in the past. Patient was not
started on amiodarone. She was treated empirically for
hyperkalemia with D50/insulin, acalcium, NaHC03. She was started
on levophed and dop and given more IVF. BP had improved to 100s.
Bedside echo showed no wall motion abnormality but did show
dilated RV. There was a question of PE which a CTA at [**Hospital1 18**]
confirmed. Cardiac enzymes were negative at OSH. She was given
1g ceftriaxone and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. Cr has been 0.9 in the
past but was 1.4 on OSH check. Patient was weaned of levo on
route so just on dopa on [**Hospital1 18**] admission.
.
Vitals in the ED were HR 75 BP 185/91 100% on CMV 50% fio2 500
x20 and peep 5. In the ED patient was taken off dopa but put
back on arrival to the floor. As stated CTA showed segmental
PE's and large ascending aortic aneurysm which is old. She was
started on heparin and cooling protocol in ED. Patient's family
still wants full code until they have more information.
.

ROS negative since patient was intubated.

Brief Hospital Course:
This was a 89 yo F w/ h/o HTN, hip fracture, who presents s/p
PEA cardiac arrest.  The most likely etiology was deemed to be
from the pulmonary embolism.  The patient was cooled but upon
rewarming, the patient's neurologic status was not significantly
improved.  Given baseline cognitive impairment and deranged
cardiac and hemodynamic parameters, the overall impression of
the primary team as well as neurology consultants was that the
chances of meaningful neurologic recovery were low.  As such,
palliative care was instituted and the patient expired
peacefully.
