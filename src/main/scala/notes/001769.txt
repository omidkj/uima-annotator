Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
presyncopal episodes

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EP ablation

History of Present Illness:
66yof w/ pmh CAD s/p CABG '[**85**], AAA repair, DM, PVD s/p bilat
AKA, hypoithyroid, hyperlipidemia, CHF, dizziness, chroinic
wounds (healed pressure ulcer on back, red cuts under breasts,
old healing abd wound), presents to OSH [**12-20**] w/ presyncopal
episodes and hypotension that had been on and off for three
days.  She was managed on the floor but tx to CCU [**12-21**] for per
report sustained VT w/ BP 50/.  She was intubated and shocked
x5.  She was started on Procainamide gtt at 3mg/min, Neo gtt and
propofol gtt.  Per report, while pt intubated and sedated, her
she had no VT.  Her last shock was [**12-21**].She was weaned from
sedation and extubated [**12-22**] and her VT re-occurred.  Since then,
she has been in NS/SB 48-52 and has recurrent VT (5-10 beat
runs) w/ BP 80-90/.

She reported presyncopal attacks for 3 days prior to [**Last Name (un) **]
presentation to the OSH. During these episodes, she felt dizzy
and had reduction in her vision. No associated chest pain, [**Doctor Last Name **]
or palpitations. No history of diarrhoea, vomiting or reduced
intake. There had been no recent change in her home medications.
In addition, she reprots that her caregiver noticed dark stool
on day 2 of symptoms, unclear whether melanotic.  Denies any
BRBPR, no nausea/vomiting/abdominal pain.

Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible EP ablation of the focus of
her presumed Vtach. On arrival at [**Hospital1 18**] CCU, ECG in sinus
revealed RBBB, LAFB, left atrial abnormality. ECG from OSH([**Hospital1 34**])
showed NSVT negative in II, III, F, positive in 1, L, transition
at V3/V4 in setting of SVT possible AT at 260.

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2116-12-25**]
Sinus rhythm with ventricular premature beats. Right
bundle-branch block. Left anterior fascicular block.
Anterolateral lead ST-T wave abnormalities are primary and are
non-specific. Since the previous tracing of [**2114-4-1**] ventricular
ectopy is present. Otherwise, there is no significant change.
.
- CXR at OSH showed no evidence of pulmonary congestion.
.
- ECG:  ECG in sinus revealed RBBB, LAFB, left atrial
abnormality. ECG from OSH([**Hospital1 34**]) showed NSVT negative in II, III,
F, positive in 1, L, transition at V3/V4 in setting of SVT
possible AT at 260.
.
- ECHO: [**2116-12-21**] at [**Hospital6 33**].  Full report in chart.
 Of note, EF 10-15%.  Severe diffuse hypokinesis.  Akinesis and
aneursymal deformity of apical walls.  Mild mitral
regurgitation, trace tricuspid regurgitation, PASP estimated at
13mmHg + RA pressure.
.
CT ABD/PELVIS [**2116-12-26**]
1. Diffuse thinning of anterior abdominal musculature with
diffuse bulge of abdomen. Fat containing umbilical hernia.
Multiple gas-filled loops of bowel including the transverse
colon, finding which can be seen in bedbound patients. No bowel
obstruction.
2. Diffusely abnormal abdominal aorta with long-segment fusiform
aneurysm (5 cm), as previously described. Size is similar to
that seen on [**2114-4-1**], however now with increased mural thrombus,
effectively resulting in decreased size of true lumen. Also now
occluded right common iliac artery, with reconstitution of flow
seen at right common femoral artery.
3. Cardiomegaly with left ventricular enlargement and left
ventricular
aneurysm.
4. Possible 3-mm right lower lobe nodule, incompletely imaged.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (un) 8773**] criteria, if the patient is at high risk for
intrathoracic
malignancy, follow-up CT would be recommended in 1 year.
Otherwise, no
further imaging would be recommended.
5. Multiple renal hypodensities, too small to characterize.
.
TTE [**2116-12-25**]
Poor image quality. The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with akinesis of the distal 2/3rds of the ventricle. A left
ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded (not seen but poor
visualization of the apex cannot exclude). There is no
ventricular septal defect. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**11-30**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no pericardial effusion. EF 20-25%.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-4-4**], no
clear change (given LV dysfunciton persists, Takotsubo CM is no
longer on the differential). If indicated, a repeat study with
echo contrast OR a cardiac MRI may better assess LV/RV function
and exclude apical thrombus.

Brief Hospital Course:
66F with CAD s/p CABG [**2085**], HL, PAD s/p B/L AKA in [**2112**] & AAA
endovascular repair [**2104**], hypothyroid, 1 PPD [**Last Name (LF) 1818**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 30-35%
per [**Hospital1 34**] echo [**2114**], obesity, decub ulcer, ventral hernia with
ulceration p/w VT storm to [**Hospital1 34**] now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
possible VT ablation by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13177**].
.
#Arrhythmia: SVT with RBBB with intervals of VTach (runs of
between 3 and 18 each time). At least two ectobic sites, one in
the atria causing the SVT and one causing the VT. Probable
causes previous MI, hyper/hypotension, elytes. Pt denies any
CP/SOB/orthopnea. TSH was normal at 1.8. ECG from [**Hospital1 34**] showed
NSVT negative in II, III, F, positive in 1, L, transition at
V3/V4 in setting of SVT possible AT at 260.
ECG on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] in sinus showed RBBB, LAFB, left atrial
abnormality
Pt was started on procainamide gtt at 3, VT initially reduced
but then flared up and gtt was increased to 4, and then DCd
prior to ablation. CCU attending ?????? 60 minutes critical care. Pt
continued to have runs of VT and was taken for ablation. EP lab
transseptal approach to ablate focus in LV, however found
several other foci
