Pertinent Results:
CT abdomen and pelvis:[**1-4**]
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.
2. Confluent soft tissue throughout the abdomen is most
suggestive of lymphoma, appears unchanged since [**2107-12-29**].
3. Stable small bilateral pleural effusions.
4. Trace amount of pelvic free fluid.

CT chest:[**1-5**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis of the
adjacent lung parenchyma. The pleural effusions are increased
from [**2108-1-5**] and new from [**2107-12-29**].
2. Rounded hypodense lesion within the atelectatic left lung
base, which may represent a pulmonary nodule. Recommend
follow-up CT after resolution of the pleural effusion for better
assessment.
3. Patchy opacities in the posterior upper lobes bilaterally.
This may be secondary to dependent atelectasis or an aspiration
event.
4. Enlarged left supraclavicular lymph node and bulky confluent
nodal masses in the abdomen; the latter have increased in size
compared to [**2107-12-29**].
.

retroperitoneal lymph node:
Monomorphous population of large atypical lymphoid cells,
necrosis and blood.
.
mesenteric lymph node:
Sections show a diffuse infiltrate of predominantly medium-sized
cells with amphophilic cytoplasm, round nuclear contours, fine
chromatin, and one to several nucleoli. Numerous apoptotic
bodies and mitotic figures are present. This increased
proliferation is admixed with histiocytes that imbibe apoptotic
cells (tingible-body macrophages), imparting a "starry-[**Hospital Ward Name **]"
appearance.  By immunohistochemistry, the lymphoid infiltrate is
diffusely immunoreactive for B-cell markers CD20 and PAX5, with
co-expression of CD10 (major subset), bcl-2, and bcl-6.  They
are negative for TdT and bcl-1.  MIB-1 shows a proliferation
index of more than 95%.  CD3 highlights scattered T-lymphocytes.
 CD138 stains scattered plasma cells.  In situ hybridization
study for [**Last Name (un) **], performed at [**Hospital6 1708**] ([**Hospital1 112**]),
is negative. FISH studies performed on unstained tough preps of
the biopsy to look for c-myc rearrangement shows a normal
hybridization pattern (see separate cytogenetics report).
The differential diagnosis based on H&E morphology includes a
high grade diffuse B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt or atypical Burkitt
lymphoma, blastoid mantle cell lymphoma and lymphoblastic
lymphoma. Negative BCL1 and TdT immunostains do not favor a
mantle cell lymphoma or lymphoblastic lymphoma, respectively.
The positive BCL2 immunostains and negative myc translocation
are against a Burkitt lymphoma, despite certain morphologic
features.  Overall, the features are that of a high grade
diffuse B-cell lymphoma.
.
pleural fluid:
POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS
consistent with lymphoma (see note).
Note:
The diagnosis is based primarily on flow cytometry
(S07-[**Numeric Identifier 28406**]). The smear shows large cells with round nuclei,
course chromatin and scant cytoplasm and admixed small
lymphcytes.
.
MRI head w/o contrast
Limited exam without evidence of lymphoma or acute intracranial
process.
.
Bone Marrow Biopsy
1.  Hypercellular erythroid dominant bone marrow with erythroid
and megakaryocytic dysplasia
2.  Increased hemophagocytic histiocytes
3.  Definitive diagnostic/morphologic evidence of lymphoma is
not seen.
.
CXR [**1-4**]
IMPRESSION: Patchy nodular infiltrate at the left lung base, new
since [**3-17**], which may be pneumonic.
.
CTA chest [**1-16**]
1. No pulmonary embolus.
2. Rounded opacity in the left lower lung is concerning for
pneumonia.
3. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions. The left pleural
effusion has slightly decreased since [**2108-1-11**].
.
CXR [**1-25**]
Since the previous examination, there is significant improved
aeration of both lungs with almost complete resolution of the
bibasilar dependent atelectasis and the pleural effusion. Note
that the lungs are emphysematous.


Brief Hospital Course:
1) Abdominal mass:
He initially presented with LUQ abdominal pain and associated
weight loss,
fevers, night sweats, dyspnea, nodular gastric/duodenal folds,
splenic [**Doctor First Name **], pararenal [**Doctor First Name **], para-[**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 28407**] [**Doctor First Name **], normocytic anemia,
thrombocytopenia and hypoalbuminemia.  His mass was
radiographically concerning for lymphoma v. primary intestinal
(gastric) adenocarcinoma.  The constellation with weight loss
was particularly concerning.  He had a laparoscopic lymph node
biopsy of an abdominal node as well as a retroperitoneal node
(full results in results section) that showed high grade B cell
lymphoma.  A bone marrow biopsy showed histiocytosis but no
lymphoma.  He also had bilateral pleural effusions, and
underwent a thoracocentesis which showed malignant effusion.  He
started [**Hospital1 **] chemotherapy and tumor lysis labs were followed
closely as there was initial concern for Burkitts which would
create a high liklihood of tumor lysis.  His tumor lysis labs
were negative throughout and he received aggressive IV
hydration.  The final read on his pathology was high grade B
cell lymphoma.  He received filgrastim 24 hours after his last
chemo dose as per protocol.  Over the next several days his
neutrophil count decreased.
