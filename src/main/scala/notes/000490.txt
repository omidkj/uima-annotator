Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10293**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension in the setting of decompensated liver disease


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Arterial line placement [**2183-1-15**]
Right internal jugalar line [**2183-1-16**]

History of Present Illness:
45M h/o EtOH cirrhosis c/b massive ascites, EtOH cardiomyopathy
s/p AICD placement, and PUD c/b GIB s/p EGD is transferred from
an OSH with hypotension in the setting of decompensated liver
disease. Briefly, after undergoing scheduled large volume
paracentesis (6L), he was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2183-1-10**]
with confusion accompanied by ammonia of 64, with some
improvement in mental status following lactulose administration.
In light of elevated Cr to 2-2.4 on admission, up from 1-1.2 at
baseline, diuretics were held. Hospital course was also
complicated by persistent hyponatremia.

When he developed SBP to 70s accompanied by low-grade fever,
shortness of breath, progressive abdominal pain/distention,
lethargy, and bandemia earlier today, he was transferred to the
OSH MICU, where he received 500 cc IVNS and albumin 12.5 g x2,
with improvement in SBP to 80s without pressor requirement.
Empiric ceftriaxone 1g x1 and vancomycin 1g x1 were administered
prior to diagnostic paracentesis, which revealed 43 wbc.

On arrival to the MICU, he was minimally conversant, but
somnolent and unable to provide detailed history. He endorses
minimal shortness of breath coupled with nonproductive cough, as
well as non-bloody emesis just prior to arrival. He denies pain
in his abdomen or elsewhere or bloody/tarry stools.


Past Medical History:
EtOH cirrhosis c/b diuretic-resistant ascites requiring weekly
large volume paracentesis
EtOH cardiomyopathy (EF 30% on TTE in [**11-28**]) s/p AICD placement
PUD c/b GIB, now s/p EGD
Gastic Bypass


Social History:

Microbiology:
C diff [**1-17**]: negative
Blood cx [**1-16**]: No growth
Urine cx [**1-16**]: negative

Imaging:
Chest x-ray [**12/2099**]:
Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Left transvenous
pacemaker leads are in a standard position with tips in the
right atrium and right ventricle.
There are low lung volumes. There are faint ill-defined
opacities in the left perihilar region. This could be due to
atelectasis, but developing infection cannot be excluded. There
is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
There is dilatation of small bowel loops in the upper abdomen

Chest x-ray [**1-18**]:
CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW: Low lung volumes. Compared with [**2183-1-17**],
there is
increased opacity in the left upper and mid zones, which could
represent
worsening asymmetric CHF. The possibility of a left-sided
pneumonic
infiltrate cannot be entirely excluded, but is considered less
likely. No
effusions.

A left-sided dual-lead pacemaker is present with lead tips over
right atrium and right ventricle. An NG tube is present -- the
tip is obscured in the lower mediastinum due to overlying soft
tissues and cannot be definitively identified. A right IJ
central line is present, tip over distal SVC.

IMPRESSION: Worsening asymmetric opacity, likely worsening CHF.

Echo [**1-16**]:
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined.

IMPRESSION: Limited study as patient could not cooperate. Left
ventricular systolic function is probably normal, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be excluded. The right ventricle is
not probably normal. No significant valvular abnormality

CT abdomen and pelvis without contrast [**1-16**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Large amount of non-hemorrhagic ascites throughout the
abdomen. No
evidence of intra-abdominal hemorrhage.
2. Intact Roux-en-Y anastomosis.
3. Cirrhotic liver. Gas-distended loops of bowel with decrease
of caliber
just distal to the J-J anastomosis. While this could represent
post-operative changes from gastric bypass, early partially
small bowel obstruction cannot be excluded.
4. Minimal-to-mild colonic wall edema, likely secondary to
patient's
end-stage liver disease. Fecal loading in the rectum.

RUQ US with dopplers [**1-17**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Large amount of intra-abdominal ascites.
2. No concerning focal liver lesion identified.
3. Somewhat limited Doppler evaluation of the left hepatic lobe,
however, no evidence of portal venous thrombosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 45 year old man with EtOH cirrhosis c/b massive
ascites and cardiomyopathy s/p AICD placement who was
transferred from an OSH with hypotension in the setting of
decompensated liver disease. His course was complicated by
hepatorenal syndrome necessitating dialysis as well as
encephalopathy.
.
#[**Last Name (un) **] (Hepatorenal Syndrome): Elevated Cr at 3.0 on admisison,
reportedly up from 1-1.2 at baseline.  Urine sodium of less than
10 narrowed differential to pre-renal dehydration vs. HRS.  Pt
was given albumin challenge for the first two days as well as
boluses of NS.  Creatinine
