Attending:[**Last Name (un) 7835**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 86 year old male with a history of CAD,
congestive heart failure, and dementia who presents from
[**Hospital3 **] with shortness of breath, hypoxia, and a chest
x-ray showing pneumonia. He was reportedly feeling more short of
breath all day, with general malaise.  He was given oxygen and
nebulizer treatments without improvement and CXR at [**Hospital 7137**] showed bilateral infiltrates concerning for pneumonia.  He
was given a dose of Levofloxacin and Flagyl.  He was brought to
[**Hospital1 18**] by EMS.  While en route, he was given a bolus of normal
saline and Duonebs by EMS.
.
In the ED, initial vital signs were T 97.0, BP 85/44, HR 107, RR
28, and SpO2 91% on NRB.  He triggered for hypotension and was
given additional IV fluids.  Labs showed WBC 6.5 but with 37%
bands and 3% metas.  He had creatinine 2.1 with unknown
baseline, bicarb 17 with anion gap 17, and lactate 5.5.  His
Troponin was 0.05 and his BNP was [**Numeric Identifier 7836**].  CXR in the ED again
showed bibasilar infiltrates concerning for pneumonia.  He was
given Vancomycin 1000 mg IV and Levofloxacin 750 mg IV.  He was
admitted to the ICU for further management.  Prior to transfer,
his vitals were BP 119/53 (105/43 sleeping), HR 103, RR 15, and
SpO2 97% on NRB.
.
Once in the ICU, he reported some continued shortness of breath
and cough.  On questioning, he noted that he often coughs after
eating.  He has been feeling unwell and more fatigued over the
last few days. He notes having some intermittent chest pain at
baseline, but no pain currently.  He was quickly weaned down to
nasal cannula.

Pertinent Results:
ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2199-8-23**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. LV systolic function appears
depressed (ejection fraction ? 30 percent) with regional
variation. Left ventricular mechanical function appears markedly
dyssynchronous. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The aortic valve is not well seen. The study is
inadequate to exclude significant aortic valve stenosis. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

CXR [**2199-8-23**]: AP UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: There is increased
left retrocardiac opacity worrisome for infection . Bibasilar
atelectasis is present. Lung volumes are low. Heart size is top
normal. There is no large effusion or pneumothorax. The aorta is
tortuous.

Brief Hospital Course:
86 yo M with CAD, systolic HF (EF 30%), h/o CVA ([**2187**]), HTN,
recurrent [**Year (4 digits) **], admitted from [**Hospital3 2558**] to ICU on
[**2199-8-23**] with hypoxia, hypotension, apparent bilateral pneumonia
(likely [**Date Range **]), and acute renal failure. Per [**Hospital1 1501**] report,
was feeling increasing dyspnea, malaise on [**8-23**]. CXR performed at
[**Hospital3 **] was concerning for bilateral PNA.  He was given
levofloxacin and metronidazole and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

  In the ED, he was hypotensive (85/44), hypoxic (91% NRB). He
received Vancomycin and was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. In the ICU,
his blood pressure remained stable in the low 100s systolic and
O2 sats in low 90s on 3L NC. He was continued on vancomycin and
levofloxacin and cefepime was added on the afternoon of [**8-23**] to
cover for hospital acquired pathogens. A bedside swallowing
study by his nurse [**First Name (Titles) 7837**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] of apple sauce as well as
his own secretions. He was made NPO. ICU course also significant
for elevated troponin suggesting demand cardiac ischemia.
.
# Sepsis due to [**Last Name (Titles) **] PNA: PNA was felt unlikely to be due
to MRSA so vancomycin was stopped upon transfer out of the ICU.
Levofloxacin and metronidazole were continued via parenteral
route as he was not taking oral medications consistently.
Formal swallowing eval by Speech Therapy on [**2199-8-26**] showed gross
[**Date Range **] of all consistencies.  He appeared to have another
[**Date Range **] event on [**2199-8-26**], with increase in supplemental oxygen
requirement and CXR showing worsening bibasilar opacities.  He
remained NPO and completed a course of Levofloxacin and Flagyl
IV on [**2199-8-31**].  His clinical status improved to the point he was
not requiring supplemental oxygen by [**2199-8-30**] and appeared
comfortable at rest.
.
#Recurrent [**Month/Day/Year **]:  Initial swallow evaluation done on
[**2199-8-26**] showed gross [**Date Range **] of all consistencies.  He was
placed NPO and a family meeting (discussed below) was held on
[**2199-8-28**].  Due to prolonged NPO status the patient was started on
TPN for nutrional support for 4 days prior to re-evaluating
swallow.  His repeat swallow evaluation on [**2199-8-30**] showed
persistent risk of [**Date Range **], which was discussed with his
guardian by phone communication.  However, pt is at risk of
[**Date Range **] even while being NPO due to continued [**Date Range **] from
oral secretions and this is known to be a chronic condition,
unlikely to improve.  Knowing these risks, after discussion with
guardian, patient was started on pureed solids and continued on
strict [**Date Range **] precautions as deliniated by Speech Therapy
with the goal of transferring back to NH.  He tolerated pureed
solids for 2 days without respiratory decompensation and will be
discharged with the following recommendations:
   a) PO diet: pureed solids, nectar thick liquids
   b) PO meds crushed in puree
   c) Strict [**Date Range **] precautions
   d) Continue Q4 oral care including oral care just prior to
any PO intake.
.
# Hypotension: Improved with aggressive fluid resuscitation.
Home BP meds (metoprolol, furosemide) were held in the ICU. On
[**8-24**] his SBP was in the 130s, so metoprolol was restarted, nitrol
patch was added instead of the prior Imdur(erratic PO intake)and
metoprolol dose was changed to 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **].  His BP remained
controlled during his stay on this dosing.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: His initial creatinine was
elevated to 2.1 (baseline ~1.2), improved with IVF
resuscitation. Creatinine at discharge was 0.8.
.
# Known CAD with elevated troponin - likely demand cardiac
ischemia. Continued plavix. Allergic to aspirin. Statin was held
due to his dysphagia/[**Hospital1 **], this was be restarted at NH if
felt indicated by PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] beta blocker and long-acting nitrate.
.
# Systolic Congestive Heart Failure, chronic: TTE in the ICU
showed an EF 30%.   Held furosemide in house, as he was
essentially NPO and getting IV fluids before initiation of TPN.
Daily weights were monitored and should continue to be monitored
in NH as lasix has not been restarted due to decreased po
intake.  Pt remained euvolemic off Lasix during admission.
