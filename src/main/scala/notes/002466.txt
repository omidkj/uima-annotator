ADDENDUM:  The patient's father brought his outpatient
medications to the hospital.  The dose of clonazepam as
dictated in the previous Discharge Summary is incorrect.  The
patient takes 1 mg p.o. q.6h.  Likewise, the clozapine was
incorrectly transcribed as prozapine; it should read
clozapine 175 mg p.o. at noon and at 5 p.m. (this is a stable
outpatient dose as prescribed).  The remainder of his
discharge medications were correct.  The discharge medication
sheet in the POE is likewise correct.
