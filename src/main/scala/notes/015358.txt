CT Chest [**2173-2-16**]
PRELIMINARY REPORT: wet read: large multifocal areas of ground
glass opacities. dignostic considerations include nonspecific
interstitial fibrosis/NSIP, inflammatory process, or possibly
infectious, less likely edema. small pleural effusions.
.
CXR ([**2173-2-16**]):Extensive diffuse coarse and nodular airspace
consolidation in upper R and b/l lung bases ,along w/ diffuse
coarse prominence of interstitial markings c/w chronic pulmonary
disease. Overall, picture c/w pneumonia w/ underlying chronic
interstitial disease.
.
CXR ([**12-29**]) per cardiologist:Background interstitial markings w/
calcified granuloma and no evidence of CHF:
Echo: ([**2173-2-17**]):The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior hypokinesis and
inferolateral thinning/akinesis. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 40-45%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with mild regional systolic
dysfunction, c/w CAD. Mild right ventricular systolic
dysfunction. Mild aortic regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid
regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
.
Echo ([**4-28**]) per cardiologist: preserved LV fxn w/ post. wall
hypokinesis and no evidence of LV dilation
Nuclear Stress test ([**4-28**]) per cardiologist: fixed
inf./posterolateral wall defect. est EF=39% and mild LV dilation
w/ exercise


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 86 year old male w/ hx of CHF, s/p CABG, and 30 pk yr
smoking hx presenting with acute shortness of breath in the
setting of recent [**Doctor Last Name **] inhalation.
.
(1) Hypoxemic respiratory failure resulting in ARDS from
inhalation injury and exacerbated by pulmonary edema, ventilator
associated pneumonia (VAP) and yeast infection

The patient has had a prolonged ICU course secondary to his
tenuous respiratory status.  Given his Pa/FiO2 ratio, bilaterall
infiltrates on imaging he was intubated per ARDS net protocol.
Early on in his course the patient was doing well and was
extubated.  However he was re-intubated the same day due to
respiratory distress.  During this time the patient became
anxious, SBP > 200 and RR >40s.  Despite non-invasive
ventilation, lasix, morphine and nitrates, the patient continued
to do poorly and was re-intubated.
.
The patient course has since been complicated by VAP. Per VAP
protocol he was started on vanc/ cipro/ zosyn.  The patient was
also on steroids initially for his inhalation injury, but this
was quickly tapered as it was felt there was no added benefit.
.
The patient was bronched on the [**2-22**]; [**2-26**]; [**3-4**].  Cultures from
the bronchs have grown yeast.  On [**3-3**] and [**3-4**] the patient's
clinical course deteriorated.  He became septic.  ID was
consulted.  They initially approved dose of fluconazole/  This
was later changed to caspofungin.
.
The patient later became dysynchronous with the vent.  The
decision was made to paralyze him and to chnage his mode of
ventilation to PCV, which he has tolerated.
.
Given the patient's cardiac function, volume overload was also
felt to be a factor.  He was intermittantly diuresed with IV
lasix and albumin/blood.
.
The patient respiratory status continued to worsen and he was
unable to be weaned from the vent.  After multiple discussions
with the family the decision was made to make the aptient
comfortable and he expirted on [**2173-3-13**].
.
(2) Septic Shock
Etiology of the patient's sepsis was felt to be his lungs.  He
was maintained on vanc.  He was later started on meropenem,
flagyll for presumptive C.diff and levofloxacin.    At one point
the patient was on 2 pressors.  ID encouraged looking for other
sources of his infection.  C. diff was ordered and was negative
X 5. KUB was ordered and was negative.  (CT torso was not
ordered initially because of the patient's dysynchrony with the
vent and need for 2 pressors) Levo was d/cd.  The patient was
started on gentamycin.   The patient was also started on
caspofungin.
.
On [**3-7**] ID encouraged the discontination of vanc and meropenem.
The patient's clinical status had stabilized.  CT torso was
performed.  There was no abdominal pathology noted, but there
was persistence of the b/l pleural effusion.  Vanc/Meropenem and
Flagyll have all been discontinued.
.
(3) CHF: Patient has an ischemic cardiomyopathy per ECHO with EF
39%.  Diuresis was initially held given Cr bump from 1.2 to 1.8.
 His respiratory status was quite tenuous and it was later felt
that volume overload was contributing to his inability to wean
from the vent and he was given prn lasix boluses +/- albumin.
.
(4) CAD: Continued aspirin and statin
.
(5)Afib/Aflutter: The patient is rate controlled with lopressor.
He was on propofol initially however due to the exacerbation of
the aflutter he was changed to fentanyl/versed.
