Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**]
Chief Complaint:
Fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2167-3-12**]: S/P ORIF Left Hip


History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 109588**] is an 82 y/o Female who fell on [**2167-3-11**] after her
dialysis treatment and sustained a left intertrochanteric hip
fracture.  She was admitted to the Orthopedic service for
surgical fixation via the emergency room after the fall.

She was brought to the operating room on [**2167-3-12**] and underwent
open reduction internal fixation with DHS device. The surgery
was uncomplicated and the patient was transferred to the
recovery room in stable condition. She did well in the recovery
room and subsequently transferred to the floor in stable
condition. On the night of surgery, she was triggered for
asymptomatic hypotension in the 80's and bolused 500cc of IV
fluids. On post-op day one, the patient became febrile(Tm
102.5), continued to by hypotensive with tachycardia to 110's.
She also had mental status changes at which point the medical
service was consulted. The recommendations was to due a delirium
work-up which included an urine analysis showing moderate amount
of bacteria. Her Foley catheter was discontinued and he patient
was started on zosyn. In addition, the patient developed a new
oxygen requirment. The patient's blood pressure continued to be
labile from the 60's to 90's and her HCT was down to 23.1 from
36 on admission. The patient was pan-cultures and a chest x-ray
was performed. The patient was ordered 2 units of pRBCs, at
which point the MICU was consulted and the patient was
transferred to the MICU on [**2167-3-13**] at 2300.

CARDIAC ECHO: The left atrium is normal in size. There is
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF 80%). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow
tract obstruction. The gradient increased with the Valsalva
manuever. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. There are focal
calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The
increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac
output. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-19**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2165-5-24**], the mitral regurgitation may be somewhat
increased.

CHEST X-RAY: Heterogeneous opacification in the right lung,
predominantly in the mid lung
region corresponds to consolidation seen on [**3-14**] chest CT,
probably the
result of aspiration. Mild pulmonary edema is worse. Mild
cardiomegaly and
mediastinal vascular engorgement also present. No pneumothorax.

CT HEAD: No acute intracranial process. If concern for CVA
continues, an
MRI with DWI is recommended.

CTA CHEST: 1. Small segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli
within the right upper lobe pulmonary arteries.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis.
3. Borderline enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.

HIP FILMS: Images from the operating suite show placement of a
metallic plate with dynamic hip screw across a previously
described intertrochanteric fracture.


Brief Hospital Course:
82yoF ESRD-HD 3x/wk, htn, depression, p/w with hip fx was
transfered to MICU for AMS, hypotension, fevers and found to
have PE.

Ms [**Known lastname 109588**] was admitted on [**2167-3-11**] for a left intertrochanteric
hip fracture.  She was brought to the operating room on [**2167-3-12**]
and underwent open reduction internal fixation with DHS device.
The surgery was uncomplicated and the patient was transferred to
the recovery room in stable condition.  She did well in the
recovery room and subsequently transferred to the floor in
stable condition.  On the night of surgery, she was triggered
for asymptomatic hypotension in the 80's and bolused 500cc of IV
fluids. On post-op day one, the patient became febrile(Tm
102.5), continued to by hypotensive with tachycardia to 110's.
She also had mental status changes at which point the medical
service was consulted.  The recommendations was to due a
delirium work-up which included an urine analysis showing
moderate amount of bacteria.  The patient blood pressure
continued to be labile from the 60's to 90's at which point the
MICU was consulted and the patient was transferred to the MICU
on [**2167-3-13**] at 2300.

MICU Course: The patient had an epsiode of unresponsiveness with
possible aspiration, from which she recovered with brief assist
with BVM. She was started on empiric Levaquin/Vanco.  All
potentially sedating medications were discontinued as potential
causes of her delirium.  Her pain was controlled with Toradol
and acetaminophen, and Oxycodone was disctoninued.  A CT head
was negative for acute pathology. A CTA chest revealed a
subsegmental PE in the RUL; she was started on heparin wit
