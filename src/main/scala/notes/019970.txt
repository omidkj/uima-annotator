Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This is a 40 year old man well known to [**Hospital1 18**] with history of C6
quadraplegia, autonomic dysreflexia, renal transplant, multiple
sacral decubitus ulcers, chronic pain, suspected HIT and
recurrent UTI with indwelling suprapubic catheter sent in to ED
from [**Hospital3 672**] with 2 days of increasing dyspnea. Patient
is on oxygen 3 liters nasal cannula at home for COPD, generally
running sats around 94-95% on this, 88% on RA. One week ago, his
mother came to visit and she was sick with a cold, "pneumonia"
per the patient. Then 2 days ago, the patient developed a cough
productive of yellow-brown sputum, which is new for him. No
fever, chills. No chest pain, palpitations or other pain. Since
that time, he has become more hypoxic, with sats in high-80s on
3 liters, now up to mid-90s with 5 liters. Sent in from [**Hospital1 1099**] Hospital for further evaluation.
.
He states that his breathing has been actually gradually
worsening over the past several months. He was initally on no
oxygen / 1L NC after being discharged in [**Month (only) 404**], and his oxygen
requirement has steadily increased, with an acute on subacute
worsening this week. He was placed on 3L oxygen by NC and BIPAP
at 12/8 as tolerated
.
In ED, patient found to be afebrile, with no leukocytosis or
left shift, lactate 2.0. Anemia with hct 31.1, above baseline
26-30. Gluc 179, above his baseline. CXR with stable
retrocardiac opacity and left-sided effusion. LENI attempted but
refused because pt could not lay flat for test, d-dimer high at
1302 (has had checked 6 times prior at [**Hospital1 18**], all 400-600 range
except [**2195-2-4**] when he had a clotted portacath). Blood cx drawn,
started on Levaquin and Vancomycin for possible pneumonia. CTA
deferred given contrast dye allergy. VQ and noncontrast CT
considered, but deferred as patient says he cannot lay flat,
wants to try again later. Discussed with patient that the
alternative is to treat with Argatroban, which he wants.
.
Of note, in [**7-16**] had CT chest without contrast that showed a
small, right-sided pleural effusion with minimal reactive
atelectasis; opacities at the lung apices, right greater than
left which likely represents scarring; scattered ground glass
opacities seen throughout the lungs; scattered blebs; cervical
fusion hardware; a portacath approaching from left subclavian
vein; surgical sutures in the left lower lobe. No mention of
retrocardiac opacity at that time.
.
Pt started to complain about right lower quandrant abdominal
pain, radiating to right flank. The suprapubic catheter was
changed. CT did not show any hepatic fluid collection, hernia,
stone or free air/fluid. UTI was suspected and pt was started on
IV ceftriaxone and IV tobramycin. Blood culture was [**Male First Name (un) 2083**] ordered
and grew G- rods susceptible to tobramycin but resistant to
ceftriaxone. Hence it was discontinued.

IMAGING([**2203-4-6**]):
LENI No right or left lower limb deep venous thrombosis
demonstrated.

ECHO ([**2203-4-5**]): Suboptimal image quality.The left atrium is
mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
systolic function is normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior
pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.

CXR 1. Persistent retrocardiac opacity, which could represent
infection in the appropriate clinical context. Associated small
chronic left pleural effusion vs pleural thickening.
2. Probable early/mild congestive heart failure.

US ABD LIMIT, SINGLE ORGAN ([**2203-4-26**])
CONCLUSION:
1. Coarse echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration.
The possibility of underlying significant liver disease such as
cirrhosis or fibrosis is not excluded.
2. Rim of perihepatic hypoechoic tissue of uncertain etiology
but raising the question of a gel-phase clot. Further evaluation
with abdominal CT is recommended.

ABDOMEN U.S. (COMPLETE STUDY) PORT  ([**2203-5-1**])
1. Fatty liver for which more significant liver disease such as
cirrhosis/fibrosis cannot be excluded.
2. Unchanged perihepatic hypoechoic tissue/fluid of unclear
etiology but may still represent a chronic clot. Abdominal CT
may provide further information.

CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast([**2203-6-2**])
There are dependent atelectatic changes and blebs at the lung
bases. Please note that portions of the right abdomen are
obscured by artifact. The liver, gallbladder, spleen, and
adrenal glands are within normal limits. The pancreas is fatty
replaced. The native kidneys are atrophic. The stomach is mildly
distended. The small bowel is unremarkable. There are no
pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph
nodes. There is no free air or free fluid within the abdomen.
The transplanted kidney is seen in the right lower quadrant and
there is no surrounding perinephric stranding or free fluid.
There is no evidence of appendicitis. A colostomy is again seen
within the left anterior abdominal wall. Contrast is seen within
a blind ending rectum. A suprapubic catheter is seen within the
bladder. There are bilateral decubitus ulcers with associated
heterotopic ossification. The right sided decubitus ulcer
appears enlarged.
