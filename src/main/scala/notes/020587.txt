.
CXR: [**8-5**]
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**7-26**], there is some
increasing
opacification at the left base consistent with some combination
of pleural
effusion, atelectasis, and possibly even consolidation.
Obliquity of the
patient makes it difficult to determine whether there has been
any shift of the mediastinum to this side. Right-sided pleural
effusion is unchanged in this patient with midline sternal
sutures, the top of which is broken
inferiorly.
.
CT: [**8-5**]
IMPRESSION:
1. New large filling defect within the left main stem bronchus
and
extending distally likely represents a large inspissated mucous
plug resulting in the near complete collapse of the left lung.
Bronchoscopy should be considered.
2. No significant interval change in a moderate-to-large
nonhemorrhagic
bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent compression
atelectasis. No new
opacities to suggest pneumonia.
3. Unchanged atherosclerotic disease involving the aorta and
coronary
circulation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 24054**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old man with history of congenstive
heart failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes, chronic left
pleural effusion, presenting with fever, respiratory distress
and leukocytosis.  He was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia.
He was started on antibiotics but continued to have increasing
difficulty breathing.  Speech and swallow was consulted and the
patinet did not want a peg tube.  A chest X-ray showed an
increasing opacity of the left lung. A follow up CT scan showed
a large mucus plug in the left main stem bronchus with resultant
atelectasis of the left lung.  Pulmonary was consulted por
possible bronchoscopy.  They said he was a poor candidate for
bronching and recomended chest physical therapy.
.
He continued at a stable amount of respiratory distress.  A
family meeting was scheduled for [**8-9**].  On [**8-7**] the patient
started to desat into the 80s on 5 liters nasal cannula.  He
required a veturi mask to maintain his oxygen saturation.
palliative care was consulted. His condition did not improve and
he was changed to care measures only.  A house officer was
called into his room on [**8-8**] at 9:35pm to pronounce his death.
The family was notified and declined an autopsy.
.
Problems:
Respiratory distress: Given recent history of multiple
admissions for aspiration pneumonia, leukocytosis, and
infiltrate on chest x-ray, this most likely represents new
aspiration pneumonia / pneumonitis. He was started on Vancomycin
and Zosyn for hospital aquired pneumonia. His sputum cultures
grew E. Coli and his antibiotics were narrowed to ceftriaxone.
The patient improved, but developed tachypnea and spiked a fever
to 101 on [**2153-8-4**].  The patients antibiotics were broadened to
back to vancomycin and zosyn and blood cultures were sent.  The
patients CXR showed increasing opacity of the left lung.  A
CT-chest w/o contrast was performed and showed a large mucus
plug in the left main stem cause atelectasis of the left lung.
His pleural effusions remained stable.  Pulmonary was consulted
and recommended chest physical therapy.
.
Low Urine Output: His urine output steadily declined.  He was
continued on mild fluid replacement.
.
Change in Mental Status: Pt has been lethargic and confused, but
mental status has improved.  Pt continues to be fatigued.  was
on remeron and ritalin now stopped, and on IVF to correct
hypernatermia.
.
Diarrhea: Pt with loose BM, but improving.  Pt has been on broad
spectrum antibiotics. C. diff studies were negative. His
diarrhea improved.
.
Depression:  Seen by PPC to discuss goals of care.  Pt and
family feel that quality of life is most important.  Diet
restrictions may be contributing to depression.  Pt and family
aware of risk of apsiration with eating.
.
Hypernatermia: Likely due to dehydration and lack of free water.
 Pt eating now, but not significant amount.  Will encourage free
water intake and continue mild fluid replacement.
.
Diastolic CHF: Last EF was >55%.  CHF could be contributing to
respiratory symptoms.  Pt with bilateral pleural effusions on
CXR. Tenuous fluid state with decreasing urine output.  Goal is
to keep hydrated without causing an increase in pulm edema with
worseing shortness of breath.
.
A-fib:  Pt has refused anti-coag in the past.  Irregular, but
rate controlled  Will cont metoprolol for rate control. Aspirin
stopped as short term risks outweigh long term benefit.
.
DM: Pt with elevated blood sugars towards end of hospital stay.
Sliding scale was adjusted and then stopped when he was made CMO
.
CKD Stage IV: Patient with worsening ceratinine and decreaing
urine output.  Patient would not be a good candiate for
dialysis. Fluids replaced lightly with goal being not to
increase pulmonary edema.
