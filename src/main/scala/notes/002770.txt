Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11495**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer for treatment of CHF and possible cardiac catherization

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization s/p stent to LCX
Tunneled catheter placement


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 68 yo male with CAD s/p MI in [**2119**], CHF, renal failure,
DM, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, multiple myeloma presenting
with sudden onset of SOB and chest pressure starting this
afternoon.  He denies recent dyspnea on exertion or chest pain.
He does report about 2 weeks ago that he had some SOB, but it
resolved.  Denies orthopnea or PND and reports that he has been
taking all of his medications.  He has had hospital admissions
in the past for CHF exacerbations for which he was intubated.
He first went to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital and was transfered for
potential cath and/or CHF therapy as he continued to have chest
pain and had EKG changes.  At [**Hospital3 417**] he was started om
heparin drip, aspirin, nitro drip and was tranfered on 100%
non-rebreather.  His CK 1156, MB 46.3, index 4.0, Trop I 4.4
from OSH and his creatinine was 10.9. He became CP free on the
ambulance ride to [**Hospital1 18**]. Denied CP on admission, but did have
signiifcant SOB. Does not make very much urine at baseline and
said that he was getting set up for dialysis.


Past Medical History:

infarction in [**2119**], status post catheterization in [**2134**] for

.
[**2139-8-2**] CXR: Congestive failure with pulmonary edema.
Pneumonitis at the bases cannot be excluded.
.
[**2139-8-4**] Cardiac catheterization: 1. Selective coronary
angiography revealed a right dominant system with three vessel
coronary artery disease. The LMCA had a 40% stenosis. The LAD
had diffuse 40 to 50% disease with 50% lesions in the upper and
lower poles of a large bifurcating diagonal branch. The LCX had
a hazy ostial 90% lesion with diffuse 50% disease in the mid to
dital vessel. The RCA had diffuse 60% stenoses with distal
occlusion of the PDA and PL that filled via left collaterals.
 2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated normal right sided
pressures
(mean RA 7 mmHg), severely elevated pulmonary (mean PA 45 mmHg),
and
mildly elevated left sided pressures (LVEDP 15 mmHg) with no
gradient
upon movement of the catheter from the ventricle back to the
aorta and a
normal cardiac index (4.8 l/min/m2).
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
4. Successful placement of a Cypher drug-eluting stent in the
ostium
of the LCX.
.
[**2139-8-4**] Echocardiogram: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There
is moderate symmetric left  ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to
hypokinesis of the inferior and posterior walls. No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate
([**12-14**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation
jet is eccentric. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior report (tape unavailable
for review)  of [**2135-4-27**], left ventricular contractile
function is reduced.


Brief Hospital Course:
68 yo M a/w SOB and CP, found to have pulmonary edema and
NSTEMI.
.
1. NSTEMI: On admission patient extremely SOB on 89% on 100%
NRB. He was placed on heparin gtt, Nitro, ASA, BB and ReoPro.
Patient underwent cardiac catheterization with stenting of his
LCX which was uncomplicated. After catheterization he was on
ASA, metoprolol, Lipitor, ReoPro for antiplatelet activity, and
Plavix. He was CP free throughout his admission and remained
hemodynamically stable. He was continued on ASA, metoprolol,
Plavix, Lipitor, Imdur and hydralazine.
.
2. CHF/pulmonary edema: On admission patient was had significant
pulmonary edema initially satting 89% on 100% NRB then briefly
on BIPAP with 100% O2 sat. He was diuresed with Lasix drip and
Diuril to which he was able to put out significant amounts of
urine (up to 2 liters over 24 hours). However, he soon required
HD after tunneled line placement on [**2139-8-3**]. He was afterload
reduced with hydralazine and Imdur. He had significant
improvement in his respiratory status within 24 hours with
improvement in pulmonary edema on chest x-ray and was satting 95
% on RA by discharge.
.
3. Renal: On admission creatinine was 10.3 indicative of ARF on
CRF likely secondary to myeloma. He was able to make urine on
Lasix drip however. A tunneled HD catheter was placed on [**2139-8-3**]
which he tolerated well. He was started on HD with significant
improvement in his pulmonary status as mentioned above. His
creatinine was 4.5 at discharge. He will follow up for dialysis
at the [**Last Name (un) **] dialysis center.
.
4. Myeloma: It was unclear what work up and treatment has been
done. Free calcium levels ranged from 1.19-1.30. This will be
follow up as an outpatient.
.
5. DM II: Fingersticks well controlled on RISS. Restarted on
Prandin as an outpatient.
.
6. Gout: Allopurinol was originally held, but w
