History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 40029**] is a 77 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for
prostate CA on lupron therapy, GERD, and past afib s/p
cardioversion admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for urgent plasmapheresis.
The patient states that he has had 10 days of progressive
fatigue and weakness such that today he was unable to climb a
flight of stairs. He denies any dyspnea, orthopnea, increased LE
edema, or PND. He reports an associated non-productive cough,
decreased PO intake, urine output, and nausea but no emesis. He
also reports chills and night sweats that have occurred since
starting lupron. Denies any bruising, hematochezia or melena,
dysuria, HA, palpitations, or chest pain. The patient presented
to an OSH today, and was noted to have a WBC of 144, creatinine
of 2.72, and a TnI of 0.8 with no CK. Of note, the patient had a
CBC drawn approximately 3 months ago after a colonoscopy which
was "normal." The patient received 162 mg ASA and 60 mg IV lasix
and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, VS 97.9 116/73 62 95%2L nc. The patient was
again noted to have a WBC 160 with 74% other, Cr 2.8, UA 16, TnT
0.17, LDH of 2188, and BNP of [**Numeric Identifier 40030**]. The patient was evaluated
by oncology in the ED with a peripheral smear that was
consistent with AML. A bone marrow biopsy was also performed in
the ED, and the patient was then transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
further monitoring and leukopheresis.
.
Review of Systems: Positive for acid reflux. As above, otherwise
negative. Denies visual changes, hearing changes, swollen
glands, sore throat, belly pain, n/v/d, constipation, dysuria,
bone pain, leg
swelling, orthopnea or PND.

Imaging/Studies:

EKG ([**2108-8-12**]): Atrial fibrillation with moderate ventricular
response. Left axis deviation with left anterior fascicular
block. Modest non-specific ST-T wave changes. No previous
tracing available for comparison.

Echo ([**2108-8-13**]): There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is moderately dilated. There are three aortic
valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area
1.0-1.2cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate aortic stenosis and symmetric LVH. Normal
regional and global biventricular systolic function. Mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Flow cytometry ([**2108-8-12**]): Three color gating is performed (light
scatter vs. CD45) to optimize blast yield.

Cell marker analysis demonstrates that the majority of the cells
isolated from this bone marrow express immature antigens CD34,
HLA-DR, myelomonocytic antigens CD33, CD15, CD11c, CD64, CD56,
and CD4.  They lack B  and other T cell associated antigens, are
CD10 (cALLa) negative, and are negative for CD13, CD117, CD14,
CD41, and Glycophorin. Blast cells comprise 68% of total gated
events. In the lymphoid gated events. B cells are scant in
number. T cells comprise 77% of lymphoid gated events, express
mature lineage antigens, and have a helper-cytotoxic ratio of 2.

INTERPRETATION: Immunophenotypic findings consistent with
involvement by: Acute myeloid leukemia with monocytic
differentiation.
Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy ([**2108-8-12**]): DIAGNOSIS:

Markedly hypercellular bone marrow with involvement by acute
monoblastic leukemia (FAB, M5a).  See note.

Note: Please correlate with cytogenetic findings.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

Peripheral Blood Smear:

The smear is adequate for evaluation.  Erythrocytes are
normochromic and show very mild anisopoikilocytosis with
scattered burr cells.  Scattered polychromatophils are also
seen.  Rare nucleated RBCs (2 per 100 RBCs) are noted.  The
white blood cell count appears markedly increased.  Platelet
count appears normal; large forms are seen; giant forms are not
present.

Differential count shows 12% neutrophils, 6% bands, 1%
monocytes, 5% lymphocytes, 2% eosinophils, 0% basophils, 69%
monoblasts, 3% myelocytes, 2% metamyelocytes.  The blasts are
large, have abundant vacuolated cytoplasm with fine granules,
high N/C ratio, round to irregular nuclear contours, open
chromatin, and prominent nucleoli.

Aspirate Smear: The aspirate material is adequate for
evaluation.  The M:E ratio is 11:1.  Erythroid precursors are
decreased and include occasional dyspoietic form.  Myeloid
precursors appear increased and consist primarily of blasts.
Megakaryocytes are present in increased numbers; abnormal forms
are not seen, but focal clusters are seen.

Differential shows: 80% Blasts, <1% Promyelocytes, 2%
Myelocytes, <1% Metamyelocytes, 6% Bands/Neutrophils, 0% Plasma
cells, 4% Lymphocytes, 8% Erythroid.

Clot Section and Biopsy Slides: The biopsy material is adequate
for evaluation.  Marrow cellularity is estimated at 90%. There
is an interstitial infiltrate
