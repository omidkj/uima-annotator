Brief Hospital Course:
#DKA- The patient was found to be in DKA and was admitted to the
ICU for treatment. Her BS was 706.  She was given insulin at
0.1U/kg SC q2h followed by insulin drip @ 5 U/hr (~0.1U/kg/hr) x
2 hrs after SC regimen started to ensure adequate plasma insulin
levels.  Her sugars quickly normalized and her anion gap also
corrected quickly also (to 15).  Her corrected Na was 136 (given
BS of 706).  Cautious fluid resuscitation (D5-1/2NS @ 100 cc/hr)
was initiated given systolic dysfunction.  Electrolytes were
closely monitored.  K+ stayed within normal limits and her
sodium normalized.  [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted.

Patient did well in the ICU.  Her insulin drip was discontinued
and she was switched to her home insulin regimen with good
control of her sugars.  She was transferred to the floor on
[**10-24**].  Upon transfer to the floor, she was comfortable and
hemodynamically stable.  [**Month/Year (2) **] sugar was 149.  She denied any
syptoms.  While on the floor, her sugars remained under control
with her home regimen.  [**Last Na
