HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 46-year-old woman was
transferred in from an outside hospital for emergent cardiac
catheterization with a known history of coronary artery
disease and a history of cerebrovascular accidents in [**2093**]
and [**2094**].

The patient presented to an outside hospital with chest pain
and was found on cardiac catheterization to have a 90%
in-stent re-thrombosis of the left anterior descending
artery, a subtotal first obtuse marginal occlusion of the
circumflex, and a diffuse right coronary artery disease.  She
arrived from the outside hospital with a blood pressure of
86/44 and was placed on an intra-aortic balloon pump.  After
cardiac catheterization in the laboratory, she denied any
worsening of her chronic left arm weakness.  She had prior
stenting done on [**2104-5-12**] with stenting and percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty of the lower pole of the
first obtuse marginal and percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty of the upper pole.

After cardiac catheterization, as the patient was in
cardiogenic shock she was transferred to the Coronary Care
Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  Coronary artery disease; status post first obtuse
marginal stenting to the first obtuse marginal and to the
left anterior descending artery with re-thrombosis of the
stents.
 2.  Moyamoya disease.
 3.  History of cerebrovascular accidents in [**2093**] and [**2094**].
 4.  History of right carotid endarterectomy.
 5.  History of right carotid to middle cerebral artery
bypass.
 6.  Hypertension.
 7.  Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
 8.  Peripheral neuropathy.
 9.  Elevated lipids.
10.  History of cholelithiasis.
11.  History of seizures.
12.  Recent infection of the left toe with a question of
osteomyelitis.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once per day.
2.  Plavix 75 mg by mouth once per day.
3.  Nitroglycerin as needed.
4.  Enalapril 5 mg by mouth once per day.
5.  Toprol-XL 50 mg by mouth once per day.
6.  Lipitor 10 mg by mouth once per day.
7.  Insulin (70/30 mix) 40 units in the morning and 30 units
in the evening.
8.  Metformin 850 mg by mouth twice per day.

ALLERGIES:  She is allergic to SULFA.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She previously smoked one pack per day but
quit; the date is not noted.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  One week prior to her
admission, she had increasing episodes of substernal chest
pain while visiting her husband at the outside hospital where
he was being treated for a burn.  Ultimately, her chest pain
increased.  She had electrocardiogram changes, and she ruled
in for a myocardial infarction with a troponin of 1.04.  She
was transferred into [**Hospital1 69**] for
that reason for immediate cardiac catheterization.

She remained in the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit for
monitoring with her intra-aortic balloon pump.  She was in a
normal sinus rhythm.

The Cardiology Service also considered possibly doing risk
stratification for her for an automatic internal
cardioverter-defibrillator placement given her myocardial
infarction and low ejection fraction.  A Neurology
consultation was obtained for her history of moyamoya disease
for neurologic risk assessment pending the possibility of
either neurosurgical vascular shunt or coronary surgery.

Laboratories on admission were as follows.  Her white blood
cell count was 13.4, her hematocrit was 31.4, and her
platelet count was 423,000.  Her prothrombin time was 13, her
partial thromboplastin time was 24, and her INR was 1.2.
Sodium was 138, potassium was 3.8, chloride was 97,
bicarbonate was 29, blood urea nitrogen was 15, creatinine
was 0.7, and her blood glucose was 82.  Her magnesium was
1.4, her phosphate was 4.9, and her calcium was 9.2.  Her
creatine kinase was 91 and a positive troponin.

Cardiology also adjusted the balloon for more accurate
placement upon notification of Radiology status post a chest
x-ray.  The patient was also started on Lasix for diuresis
and a heparin drip.  She remained on an insulin sliding-scale
and continued with beta blockade.

The patient was seen by the Stroke Service.  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**] of Cardiothoracic Surgery also was consulted with a
desire to know what the risks of hemorrhage were as systemic
heparinization would be required to put the patient on pump
for bypass.  The neurologic examination was stable.  The
magnetic resonance imaging showed negative for old hemorrhage
and positive for an old right stroke.  Please refer to their
note.

The patient was also seen by the Neurosurgery team in
consultation who recommended the possibility of the patient
benefiting from cerebral angiography to start to clarify the
risk of a neurologic insult during surgery.

On [**8-20**] the patient was seen by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 16398**] of
Cardiothoracic Surgery who noted her history as above.
Neurologically, she was alert and oriented.  The ACIC bypass
and stent was patent per magnetic resonance angiography, and
her right cortex was well collaterized from the left.  He
noted this as well as appreciating the Neurology Service and
Stroke Service consultations.

On examination, she was alert and oriented.  Cranial nerves
II through XII were grossly intact with a negative neurologic
examination.  Her lungs were clear bilaterally.  She had
decreased breath sounds on the left side, however.  She had
normal first heart sounds and second heart sounds. She had a
positive early systolic murmur.  Her chest was symmetric.
Her abdomen was obese, soft, nontender, and nondistended.
Her lower extremities were cool to touch but positive
capillary refill, and no venous stasis changes.  No dorsalis
pedis pulse was appreciated at that time.

Preoperative, her potassium was 3.8, with a blood urea
nitrogen of 12, and a creatinine of 0.5.  Her prothrombin
time was 13.8.  Her INR was 1.3.  Clearly, the patient had
failed her percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty
interventions.  Her noted her coronary targets, and the
patient consented to coronary artery bypass graft.  The
patient was also started on an ACE inhibitor, captopril 25 mg
three times per day while she remained in the Coronary Care
Unit.  She was also screened for nutrition risk.

A preoperative workup was done on [**8-21**].  The urinalysis
also showed some hematuria.  A chest x-ray showed bilateral
pleural effusions (left greater than right), but no
congestive heart failure or infiltrates.

On [**2-23**], the patient underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting times four by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**] with a left internal
mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery, vein
graft to the posterior descending artery, sequentially to the
posterolateral branch, and a vein graft to the second obtuse
marginal.

She was transferred to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit
in fair condition on a dobutamine drip at 5 mcg/kg per
minute, a Levophed drip at 0.75 mcg/kg per minute, as well as
insulin and propofol drips titrated.

On postoperative day one, dobutamine was weaned off.
Levophed was at 0.15 mcg/kg per minute.  The balloon remained
on 1:1 with a blood pressure of 113/68.  She was saturating
96%.  She had been extubated overnight.  In sinus tachycardia
at 118.  White blood cell count was 14.5.  Her hematocrit was
33.6.  Her INR was 1.1.  Her potassium was 4.6.  Her blood
urea nitrogen was 8.  Her creatinine was 0.5.  She was awake.
She had coarse bilateral breath sounds.  The rest of her
examination was relatively benign with the exception of
having to doppler both dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis
pulses bilaterally as her feet were slightly cool somewhat to
preoperatively.  She began Lasix diuresis.  She was continued
on her perioperative antibiotics.  She was followed by the
Cardiology fellow who noted some episodes of recurrent
ventricular tachycardia.  Diuresis was continued.  There was
a concern with her electrocardiogram changes and recurrent
runs of ventr
