History of Present Illness:
60 yr old female with hx of high cholesterol, HTN, DM who is
transferred here from OSH for revascularization of left craotid
stenosis.  Pt was found to have bilateral carotid stenosis
(moderate on right, severe on left) by her PCP and was scheduled
to have an elective CEA on the left.  She denies chest pain but
it was recommended that she have a cardiac work-up prior to her
CEA.  On [**2198-10-30**], pt underwent an excercise test with nuclear
imaging which produced chest pain at a low work load.  The
imaging showed evidence of inferolateral and posterolateral
ischemia and infero-apical infarction.  A cardiac
catheterization was scheduled for the middle of [**Month (only) 404**].
However, two days prior to this admission, pt was shopping and
experienced a sharp substernal chest pain that radiated across
her chest and into her left arm associated with diaphoresis, no
SOB, no nausea.  She sat down to rest and it resolved within 15
minutes.  Later that day, she experienced that same chest pain,
associated with diaphoresis but this time, she was at rest.  She
called her cardiologist and he suggested that she come to the
hospital given that these sx were suggestive of unstable angina.
 At that time, she ruled out for MI with enzymes and EKG and
cardiac catheterization was done.  On [**2198-11-20**], cardiac cath
showed severe multivessel CAD with high grade stenosis of the
proximal and mid-LAD, large D1 and D2 branches, ostial LCx and
ostial RCA.  Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for carotid artery
stenting followed by CABG.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, pt is a 60 yr old female with hx of DM,
high cholesterol, DM recently found to have bilateral carotid
stenoses and multi-vessel coronary artery disease on cath
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for carotid revascularization before CABG.
Pt. first had neurology consult before proceeding with carotid
stenting (see note). On [**2198-11-23**], pt had successful PTA and
stenting of the [**Doctor First Name 3098**] (please see procedure report for details).
Over the next several days following her left carotid stenting,
pt. was medically managed without incident and received
appropriate anticoagulation meds while awaiting CABG. On [**2198-11-27**]
pt was brought to the operating room and underwent coronary
artery bypass graft surgery x 4 and left femoral artery
repair(pleae see surgical note for full details). Pt tolerated
the procedure well with a CPB time of 119 minutes and XCT of 100
minutes. Pt was transferred to CSRU in stable condition with a
Phenylephrine drip for BP support, Insulin drip, and being
titrated on Propofol. Later that day, propofol was weaned and
NMB reversed. Pt became awake and was extubated without
incidence. Pt. was moving all extremeties, awake, alert, and
neurologically intact.
POD #1 - Pt. was stable. Weaned off of all drips. Swan Ganz
catheter removed. Pt. was transferred to telemetry floor.
POD #2 - Pt. was somewhat dyspneic in AM. Pt. had decrease BS at
bases. Lasix was increased to 40 mg IV bid and CXR was ordered.
CXR revealed a small left apical pneumothorax. Two left-sided
chest tubes are in unchanged position with stable cardiomegaly.
Atelectasis within both lower lobes.
POD #3 - Repeat CXR revealed there has been slight decrease in
the size of the patient's left apical pneumothorax. Chest tubes
off suction,now wter seal. Pt. hemodynamically stable. Epcardial
pacing wires and foley removed
POD #4 - Another repeat CXR revealed no changes in the size of
the left apical pneumothorax. Chest tubes were then removed.
Post chest tube removal CXR showed there is a small left apical
pneumothorax. Pt. cont. to encouraged to ambulate and get OOB
with PT.
POD # [**3-23**] - Over the next three days pt slowly improved and was
finally at level 5 on POD #7. Throughout post-op course pt was
seen by PT and medically managed with stable glucose control.
Pt. was discharged home with VNA services. D/C PE:
