Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**]
Chief Complaint:
BRBPR, bleeding fistula

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Colonoscopy
Hemodialysis


History of Present Illness:
76 y F with h/o ESRD on HD who generally gets her care at [**Hospital1 112**]
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] last night for AV fistula bleed and possible
lower GI bleed being transferrred to the MICU for low blood
pressures.
.
She initially presented to [**Hospital1 18**] for concern for left AV fistula
bleeding, which was recently redone and starting to be used last
week. Since then, it has been bleeding after hemodialysis which
she first noticed at home, so came in for evaluation.
.
In the ED, her SBP's ranged from 78-82 persistently. Her initial
HCT was 34, and she was admitted for concern for GI bleeding.
Her coumadin was held. She was admitted to the medical floor,
but triggered in the morning of [**2117-4-29**] for SBP 80 - she was
mentating fine and on further review was felt to be close to her
baseline. ICU admission was requested for closer monitoring in
the setting of possible GI bleeding.
.
ROS: In addition to above, pt had lightheadedness earlier but
currently does not feel dizzy either sitting or standing. She is
hungry. She has no chest pain, shortness of breath, fever,
chills. She had some nausea on Monday with mucoid vomiting but
no blood. She complains of some weakness of both legs, which is
equal and at her baseline.

CXR [**2117-4-29**]
IMPRESSION: Severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, likely
cardiomegaly; however, pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.
No acute pulmonary process

Colonoscopy:
Findings:
 Mucosa: Localized ulceration with stigmata of recent bleeding
was noted in the rectum. These findings are compatible with
solitary rectal ulcer syndrome.
 Excavated Lesions A few diverticula with small openings were
seen in the sigmoid colon.Diverticulosis appeared to be of mild
severity.
Impression: Ulceration in the rectum compatible with solitary
rectal ulcer syndrome
Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to terminal ileum


Brief Hospital Course:
# Hypotension, concern for GI bleed - Blood pressure appeared to
be at her baseline per ED records and according to her is
similar to her baseline. Her blood pressure remained stable at
all times. She was transferred to the ICU where HCT's were
obtained q 6H. She was not transfused. Access was maintained via
2 IV's and the dialysis catheter. She received PPI IV BID. GI
was consulted and performed a colonoscopy. The patient's initial
INR was 1.9 so she was given 5 mg po vitamin K for reversal
prior to colonoscopy and prep with Magnesium Citrate. The
colonoscopy showed a small rectal ulcer. The patient will need
to follow up with a flexible sigmoidoscopy in [**2-14**] weeks as an
outpatient. She should continue colace 200-400 mg [**Hospital1 **] until
then. She can restart coumadin and aspirin now.
.
# ESRD: The patient received hemodialysis on [**4-30**] with no
complications via the catheter. Renal was consulted and
recommended a fistulogram, which could not be performed during
hospitalization, so she should have this arranged as an
outpatient and receive dialysis through the catheter until then.

# Wheezing, bicarb of 37: The patient could potentially have
underlying lung disease.  She received combivent with good
response and was discharged with an albuterol inhaler. This
could be from pulmonary amylod or asthma, and should be followed
as an outpatient.

# elevated alk phos/LFT's - her alk phos and AST were noted to
be elevated on admission, with slightly elevated GGT. She should
get

# Thrombocytopenia: Her recent baseline is 80 which were
constant in the hospital.

# History of PAF. An EKG showed no changes and the patient
remained at sinus. An episode of A fib was noted during
hospitalization without increased rate.

# h/o amyloidosis with CHF: her fluid status was carefully
monitored. She will start her outpatient medications when she
returns home.
