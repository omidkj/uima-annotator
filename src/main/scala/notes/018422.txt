Service:  [**Hospital **] MEDICAL

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 36-year-old
female with a history of hepatitis C and hepatitis A who was
found unresponsive in her home when EMS arrived to respond to
a call for a "nosebleed".  Per reports, she was sitting in a
chair, looking cyanotic and unresponsive.  The initial vital
signs revealed a heart rate of 30, blood pressure
80/palpable, 50% 02 saturation, respiratory rate 60.
Endotracheal tube intubation was attempted in the field
without success but a nasopharyngeal airway was placed.  The
02 saturations came up to 96% and the patient was taken to
[**Hospital3 3583**]. The patient was given 0.4 mg Narcan times
two in the ambulance and did not become more responsive.  The
patient also received lidocaine 100 mg IV, Etomidate 20 mg
IV, succinylcholine 160 mg IV, Norcuron 10 mg, and Ativan 4
mg IV in the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 46**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  The patient's blood pressure and
heart rate were better at [**Hospital1 46**] apparently without pressors.
The head CT was reportedly normal.  The patient was
transferred to [**Hospital6 256**] for
further care.  The patient received 50 grams of charcoal in
transit.  Significant laboratories included a white blood
count of 27,000, 12% bands, hematocrit 41.3, tox screen
positive for cocaine and opioids. The patient was initially
normotensive on arrival but then became hypertensive with a
systolic blood pressure in the 70s.  The patient received IV
fluids and dopamine drip.  The patient was given ceftriaxone
and vancomycin in the Emergency Department and successfully
intubated in the ED.  The patient's EKG showed sinus rhythm
at 98 beats per minute with ST depressions and wide QRS and
alternate beats.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hepatitis C.
2.  Hepatitis A.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has two children,
Spanish-speaking only.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
94, pulse 98, blood pressure 96/55.  General:  The patient
was an obese woman, intubated, eyes closed, opens eyes to
voice at 5:00 p.m.  At 9:00 p.m., she opens eyes to voice and
was able to follow simple commands.  HEENT:  The pupils were
2 mm, minimally reactive to light.  Anicteric sclerae.  The
nares were full of bloody nasal discharge.  Lungs:  Coarse
breath sounds bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and
rhythm.  Good heart sounds.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Abdomen:  Obese, soft, nontender, nondistended, minimal bowel
sounds. Extremities:  No pedal edema, bilateral DP pulse
present.  Neurologic:  Opens eyes to voice, moving all four
extremities spontaneously.  Follows simple commands in
Spanish.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  Sodium 143, potassium 4.0,
chloride 111, bicarbonate 20, BUN 20, creatinine 1.0, glucose
246.  CK 1,024, MB 46.5, MBI 4.5, troponin 24.  Calcium 7.9,
magnesium 2, phosphate 3.8, ALT 59, alkaline phosphatase 101,
total bilirubin 0.7.  AST 141, amylase 214, lipase 39.  Serum
was negative for aspirin, ethanol, acetaminophen, benzos,
barbiturates, and tricyclics.  Positive for opiates and
cocaine.  The urine was negative for benzos, barbiturates,
amphetamines, and methadone.

White count 19.6, hemoglobin 11.8, platelets 343,000,
hematocrit 36.7, 91.7 neutrophils, 0 bands, 4.2 lymphs.  PT
13.8, PTT 30.4, INR 1.3.  ABGs 7.21, 53, 92, lactate 2.1.

Chest x-ray revealed no infiltrates, no cardiomegaly.
Endotracheal tube 2.5 cm from the carina.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  UNRESPONSIVENESS:  The etiology most
likely was secondary to cocaine plus/minus opioid overdose.
The patient's mental status quickly improved, following
commands, and was able to be extubated the following day on
[**2152-7-23**].  The patient tolerated extubation well and was
maintained on 02 nasal cannula.

2.  COCAINE-INDUCED MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION:  Regarding
increased CK MB and troponin, Cardiology was consulted.
Cardiology recommended 48 hours of heparin drip, aspirin, and
an echocardiogram.  Cocaine-induced coronary spasm was
suspected cause for MI.  Troponins steadily declined.  The
patient remained chest pain-free.  Echocardiogram showed
normal left ventricular ejection fraction.

On [**2152-7-26**], the patient experienced chest pain times
three overnight relieved by sublingual nitrogen.  The pain
was positional and related to cough and deep inspiration.
The pain was thought likely pulmonary in nature.  Cardiology
was reconsulted.  Cardiology recommended workup by cardiac
catheterization.  The cardiac catheterization showed a LVEF
of 55% with no mitral regurgitation, right dominant coronary
arteries with normal vasculature.  At the time of discharge,
the patient was chest pain-free.

3.  ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA:  The patient was with a fever and
leukocytosis.  Sputum culture was performed with grew
Staphylococcus aureus.  The patient was treated with Levaquin
and metronidazole for a total course of ten days.  The
patient remained afebrile for 72 hours prior to discharge.
The patient was discharged to complete final three days of a
ten day course of antibiotics.

4.  DEPRESSION:  Psychiatry was consulted and felt that the
patient was not a suicide risk, did not need one-to-one
monitoring.  The patient was restarted on her Paxil and
Seroquel in the evening and Psychiatry recommended consult of
addiction services.

5.  DRUG ADDICTION:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2411**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2412**] was consulted regarding
drug addiction.  The patient reported willing to undergo
inpatient treatment for dual-diagnosis therapy.  At the time
of dictation, the patient was to be evaluated for transfer to
Dual Diagnosis Center.

6.  RHABDOMYOLYSIS:  The patient was with elevated CKs and
deceased calcium, again thought induced by cocaine.  The
patient was placed on IV fluids.  The CKs rapidly trended
downward with no renal sequelae.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient was instructed to seek
medical care for recurrent chest pain or shortness of breath.
The patient was instructed to finish the final three days of
ten day antibiotic course and to follow-up for treatment with
Psychiatry and for drug addiction.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Levofloxacin 500 mg one tablet q.d. for three days.
2.  Metronidazole 500 mg one tablet three times a day for
three days.
3.  Paxil 20 mg one tablet q.d.
4.  Seroquel 50 mg at bedtime for insomnia, may repeat once
as necessary.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Respiratory failure secondary to drug overdose.
2.  Cocaine-induced myocardial infarction.
3.  Aspiration pneumonia.
4.  Depression.
5.  Drug addiction.

ADDENDUM:  The patient was noted to have high blood glucose
levels throughout the hospital stay.  The patient was
instructed to follow-up with primary care physician regarding
diabetes screen.
