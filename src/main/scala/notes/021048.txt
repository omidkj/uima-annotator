Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1556**]
Chief Complaint:
Septic shock

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
BAL

History of Present Illness:
73yo F with history of metastatic breast cancer, atrial
fibrillation on coumadin, ulcerative colitis and cardiomyopathy
presents transferred from [**Hospital1 13199**] for impending sepsis.
.
Patient was doing well at rehab and was scheduled to go to [**Hospital1 336**]
for a surgical Gtube but had a sudden Hct drop/acute renal
failure/worsening pulmonary function/waxing mental status and
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. In rehab, she was apparently weaned to
trach mask with speaking valve with occasional SIMV. She then
had increased ventilatory support, CT chest [**11-26**] show large
right pleural effusion. Patient had pigtail placed on [**12-1**].
Pleural fluid labs are pending. 1L has been put out. Renal team
felt that her ARF was due to hypotension on [**11-19**] in the setting
of low HCt. She also has persistant hyperkalemia.
.
Of note, patient was just recently admitted from [**Date range (2) 100990**]
with pontine abscess. Infectious source was not identified and
neurosurgery fet that biopsy was too dangerous. She was treated
with multiple antibiotics but eventually responded to penicillin
G for suspicion of Listeria. She is left with a significant
L-facial paresis, is able to move her tongue, but with
difficulties and remains unable to clear her secretions. She was
intubated and trached because of that. She was also treated for
MRSA and stenotrophomonas PNA with vancomycin and bactrim. She
also has significant proximal muscle weakness b/c steroid use.
Hospital course c/b GI bleed from supratherapeutic INR. EGD
showed AVM. She also had multiple hypotensive episode, likely
from primary brainstem lesion in combination with sedation,
blood loss and also after large volume thoracentesis. She also
developed anemia and thrombocytopenia with neg HIT and
eventually stabilized. She also deveoped bilateral large pleural
effusion which was tapped, cytology showed atypical cells,
concerning for adenocarcinoma. However, she was discharged when
this result is available and there has been no follow up.


Past Medical History:
-breast cancer, diagnosed in [**2102**]; bilateral with metastases to
lymph nodes, s/p lumpectomy, local radiation and 5FU/adriamycin

.
Echo:
IMPRESSION:Right ventricular cavity enlargement with pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Moderate-severe tricuspid
regurgitation. Preserved left ventriculary systolic function.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2111-12-28**], the
severity of mitral regurgitation is now reduced.
.
CT Chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. Limited study due to artifact from the arm and left hip.
2. Markedly increased subcutaneous edema in chest, abdomen, and
pelvis.
3. Status post thoracentesis with pigtail catheter terminating
in the azygoesophageal recess.
4. Increased ascites, measuring [**11-7**] Hounsfield units.
5. Gallstones, without gallbladder distention.
6. Status post tracheostomy, with slight overinflation of the
balloon at the level of thyroid gland.
7. Cardiomegaly with enlargement of right atrium.
8. Bilateral pleural effusion.
9. Increased bilateral patchy opacities with consolidation in
right lower lobe, probably representing combination of edema,
atelectasis, and possibly multifocal pneumonia.
10. Status post left hip replacement.
.
CT Abdomen:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
2. Unchanged bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than
right. Improvement in consolidation seen at the right lung base,
but with bibasilar atelectatic changes.
3. Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
4. Slight decrease in the amount of ascites seen in the abdomen.
Slight decrease in overall anasarca compared to the prior study.
.
BAL:
Negative for malignant cells.
.
CT Head:
IMPRESSION:
1. Exam limited by motion. No evidence of acute intra- or
extra-axial hemorrhage.
2. Partial opacification of the sphenoid sinus and total
opacification of the mastoid air cells which was also
demonstrated on the CT scan of [**2111-9-20**].

FINAL REPORT


HISTORY: 73-year-old woman status post complicated percutaneous
G-tube
placement. Assess for positioning of the tube.

TECHNIQUE: Multidetector axial images of the abdomen and pelvis
were obtained
with contrast. 15 cc of Gastrografin was subsequently infused
through the
gastrostomy tube and immediate scan of the gastrostomy site was
performed
followed by delayed imaging of the abdomen and pelvis.

CT ABDOMEN: There is a moderate-to-large left pleural effusion
and small
right pleural effusion with associated basilar atelectasis. The
liver appears
increased in attenuation on this non-contrast study. Within the
limits of
this non-contrast study, the pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands,
and kidneys are
stable. The gastrostomy tube appears outside of the stomach
lumen and is
positioned posterior to the greater curvature of the stomach.
Injection of
contrast reveals pooling of contrast within the mesentery and
apparently
extraluminal. On the delayed scan, approximately 10 minutes
after injection,
the contrast remains in unchanged position. No contrast is seen
within the
bowel. There is a large amount of intraperitoneal free air. Free
fluid is
also seen tracking along the left pericolic gutter. Large
gallstones are
again identified.

CT PELVIS: Small bowel loops are not dilated. Ileostomy is again
noted. The
bladder and rectum are stable. No pelvic free fluid is
identified. There is
no pelvi
