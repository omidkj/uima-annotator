Attending:[**Known firstname 943**]
Chief Complaint:
AMS

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation and Extubation

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 53yo M on the [**Known firstname **] list, cryptogenic
cirrhosis c/b portal HTN and variceal bleeding, s/p splenorenal
shunt and
splenectomy, HTN, a-fib, h/o PE/DVT on coumadin, CRI who
presented to an OSH with altered mental status.  The patient was
recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 79779**] with similar
complaints, which was attributed to hepatic encephalopathy with
possible exacerbation from medication non-compliance or
pneumonia.  While there was no overwhelming suspicion of
pneumonia, he was discharged to complete a course of
levofloxacin.  The patient was discharged home with services.
.
It appears that since dischage he was readmitted to [**Hospital1 3325**] with complaints of lightheadedness.  This was
attributed to the numerous medications started recently, and
some of his BP mediations were discontinue.  It was noted by the
patient's sister during that hospitalization that the patinet
has been having increasing difficulties tolerating lactulose,
and the dose was deceased to 30ml.
.
On the day of presentation, the patient was found by his sister
to be difficult to arrouns, responding only to painful stiumuli.
 The patient was ultimatly intubed at [**Hospital3 **] to protect
his airway.  The patien'ts ammonia level was checked at 420.
The patient was given zosyn and lactulose and transfered to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], vitals wer BP 110/70, HR 66, 100% on the vent.  He was
given 2L of NS and 1 dose of vanc, and admitted to the MICU for
further mangement.

RUQ US:
1. 2.2 x 2.3 x 2.7 cm heterogeneous focal lesion in the left
lobe of the liver, slightly enlarged compared to prior CT in
[**2138**]. Appearance is not consistent with a hemangioma, as
described above. Given interval increase in size, well
differentiated HCC cannot be excluded. Differential diagnosis
inlcudes FNH or adenoma. MRI with BOPTA could be considered.
2. Nonvisualization of the main portal vein. This is consistent
with
findings of prior CT and MRI, and implies chronic portal vein
thrombosis.
3. Cholelithiasis with no son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of acute
cholecystitis.
4. Normal flow in the hepatic veins and hepatic arteries.

Brief Hospital Course:
#. Change in Mental Status: Given the patient's history of
hepatic encephalopathy, markedly elevated ammonia level, and
normal HCT, most likely etiology felt to be hepatic
encephalopathy in the setting of med non-compliance.  In
consideration of other causes, head CTs showed no intracranial
pathology, there were no focal deficits on exam.  Additionally,
there no orher blatent infectious etiologies.  His CXR was
unchanged, no major leukocytosis, afebrile.  His UA was
unremarkable and no c/o abd dysfunction. His U/S showed no
ascites so felt unlikely SBP. He was continued on lactulose and
rifaximin with marked improvement in his mental status. Vitamin
B12, TSH, RPR were checked and were unremarkable. Patient was
oriented on discharged and continued on lactulose and rifaximin.


# Respiratory Support:  Patient intubated to protect his airway.
 No significant underlying lung issues, and extubated on day one
of admission.
.
#. Cirrhosis: Pt with cryptogenic cirrhosis dx as a child.
Likely hepatic encephalapthy was the cause of patient's change
in mental status, see above. LFTs were withint normal range for
this patient.

# Chronic Renal Insuff: Baseline Cr has ranged 1.8-2.6. On
admission Cr was 1.7. Nephrotoxins were avoided and medications
were renally dosed.  He was diuresed as above.
.
#. Hepatic Lesion: The patient had a RUQ that showed a 2.2 x 2.3
x 2.7 cm heterogeneous focal lesion in the left lobe of the
liver, slightly enlarged compared to prior CT in [**2138**].  There is
concern for possible HCC and it is recommended he has follow-up
as an outpatient.

#. Supratherapeutic INR/h/o PE/DVT: Pt with PE 2-3 years ago.
INR was supratherapeutic in house and patient was discharged
with INR of 4.1 with plan to hold coumadin until INR could be
rechecked in 2 days.
.
# h/o A-fib: Continued anticoagulation and rate control with
metoprolol.
.
# PPX: PPI, coumadin, lactulose
