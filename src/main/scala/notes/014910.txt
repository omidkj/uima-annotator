History of Present Illness:
HPI: (obtained from daughter)
81 year old female was walking today and fell off the curb. Her
daughter left her side for a few seconds and when she turned
around the patient was unconscious on the ground. This lasted
for about 5-7 minutes. She was taken to an OSH where she was
confused and then she became agitated. The patient was then
intubated. She had a head CT which revealed SAH and she was
given phosphenytoin. Then she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further evaluation.

CT Head: [**2120-6-20**]
INDICATION: Patient is an 81-year-old female status post fall at
outside
hospital stated orbital fracture and hemorrhage. Intubated.
Evaluate for
progression of hemorrhage from outside film.

EXAMINATION: Non-contrast head CT.

COMPARISONS: Comparison made to outside reference CTs from
[**2120-6-20**].

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained through the
brain. No
intravenous contrast was administered. Coronal and sagittal
reformations were
obtained.

FINDINGS: There are two linear foci of high attenuation tracking
adjacent to the right frontal lobe, best seen on (2:19 and 2:22)
that are most compatible with areas of subarachnoid hemorrhage,
and a more focal rounded area of high attenuation best seen on
(2:21) that is most likely subarachnoid hemorrhage, however, an
intraparenchymal location cannot be excluded. There is no
evidence of mass effect with no midline shift. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
matter differentiation is preserved with no evidence of acute
territorial infarction. There is extensive periventricular
hypodensity, compatible with chronic small vessel ischemic
changes. The ventricles and sulci are prominent, most compatible
with age-related involutional changes. Note is made of an air-
fluid level seen within the right maxillary sinus with
high-attenuation components most suggestive of hemorrhage,
however, no definitive associated facial bone fracture is
identified. The remainder of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid
air cells are well aerated. In comparison to outside hospital
CTs, linear foci of hemorrhage, not significantly changed in
size or distribution.

IMPRESSION:
1. Stable in appearance since outside hospital examinations,
linear foci of high attenuation located adjacent to the right
frontal lobe most compatible with areas of subarachnoid
hemorrhage, however, with a more focal rounded area that is most
likely subarachnoid in location, however, intraparenchymal
location cannot be excluded.

2. Air/blood-fluid level seen within the right maxillary sinus
suggestive of occult fracture, however, no gross fracture
visualized.

CT Head: [**2120-6-24**]
HISTORY: 81-year-old female with subarachnoid hemorrhage. This
is a followup exam.

COMPARISON: Non-contrast head seven and a half hours prior ([**6-20**], [**2119**],
12:27 p.m.).

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT was obtained.

FINDINGS: In comparison to the most recent prior study, there is
little
change foci of high attenuation within or adjacent (3:19, 24).
There is no
mass effect or shift of normally midline structures. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white
matter
differentiation remains preserved. Extensive periventricular
hypodensities
compatible with chronic small vessel ischemic changes are
similar to the prior studies. The ventricles and sulci remain
prominent, likely due to age-related involutional change.
Prominence of the CSF spaces bilaterally is unchanged.

Air-fluid level in the right maxillary sinus, with high
attenuation is most likely hemorrhage, although as on the prior
study, no definite facial fracture is identified. The visualized
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells remain well aerated.

IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged linear foci of high attenuation within or adjacent
to the right
frontal lobe compatible subarachnoid hemorrhage. No new
intracranial
hemorrhage.
2. Unchanged air/blood-fluid level in the right maxillary sinus.
No
obvious fracture is identified.
3. Unchanged prominence of the CSF spaces bilaterally
predominantly overlying the cerebral hemispheres. While this may
be due to atrophy or subdural hygroma .

MRI Brain: [**2120-6-24**]
Final Report
EXAMINATION: MR head with and without contrast.

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar MR imaging of the brain was performed
with and without intravenous gadolinium. Magnevist 12 mL for 131
pounds.

HISTORY: 81-year-old female with altered mental status.

Comparison with prior CT brain performed [**2120-6-20**].

FINDINGS:

Bilateral near CSF intensity, frontoparietal subdural
collections are again identified, consistent with CT findings.

Gradient echo images demonstrate a region of susceptibility
artifact in the right frontal lobe consistent with hyperdense
focus seen on CT. There is diffuse T2/FLAIR signal
hyperintensity within the periventricular and deep subcortical
white matter. Additionally noted is an old lacunar infarct in
the left lentiform nucleus. The intracranial arterial flow voids
are patent. There is minimal fluid within the mastoid air cells.
There is no evidence of restricted defusion to suggest acute
ischemia. There is no abnormal parenchymal enhancement
identified.

IMPRESSION:

1. Persistent bilateral frontoparietal chronic subdural
hygromas/hematomas.

2. Probable focus of old subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right
frontal lobe.

3. Severe microangiopathic ischemia white matter disease.

Hip X-ray [**2120-6-24**]
HISTORY: 81-year-old female with left hip pain and fall.

TECHNIQUE: AP PELVIS AND LEFT HIP, TWO VIEWS

There are no prior radiographs for comparison.

There are bilateral total hip arthroplasties, in expected
position, without evidence of hardware loosening or
complications. There are old healed fractures of the left
superior and inferior pubic rami. There is an ossific fragment
measuring 1.3 x 1.9 cm lateral to the right hip joint which may
represent heterotopic ossification or an old avulsion fracture.
There is degenerative disease of the lower lumber spine.
