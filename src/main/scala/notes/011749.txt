Service:  Medicine

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Right-sided chest pain x2-3 days.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 81-year-old
male with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and a
history of pulmonary emboli in [**2116**] and [**2128**] who is here for
right-sided chest pain which began two to three days prior to
admission at [**Hospital1 **] Rehabilitation Center.  The
pain was non-radiating and intermittent.  The patient
complained that the pain was severe and sharp on the day of
admission and worse with deep breathing.  There was no
accompanying nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis or shortness of
breath.  He did complain of light-headedness with movement,
especially with sitting forward.  The patient has had
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation two to three days per day
sometimes but not recently.  The patient can tell at times
because of a "fluttering" in his chest.  The patient has had
no recent leg trauma.  He had stopped Coumadin in [**2130**] and
otherwise had not noticed any sudden sharp pain, had not had
any episodes of syncope and had not noticed any shortness of
breath.  The patient also has not noticed any recent leg
swelling or redness.  He has been on bedrest for the past two
and a half weeks secondary to his recent stroke.  The patient
claims that his recent cerebrovascular accident left him with
dizziness and numbness.  The numbness extends from the right
side of his face down toward his leg.  Per report, on a
recent CT scan, the patient had diffusion abnormalities in
the right occipital region and also in the right medullary
region of his brain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for pulmonary emboli in
[**2116**] and [**2128**].  The patient had a factor 5 lidin, protein CNS
and prothrombin gene mutation workup which were all negative.
The patient had been on Coumadin since [**2128-2-5**] and
had stopped this medication in [**2130**].  The patient also has a
history of a recent stroke leaving him with "lateral
medullary syndrome".  The patient's past medical history is
also significant for pneumonia with ARDS in [**2129-2-5**]
and Legionella pneumonia in [**2129-5-5**].  The patient has a
history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  He has a history
of coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction
in [**2121**] and coronary artery bypass grafting.  The patient has
a history of abdominal aortic aneurysm, status post repair in
[**2121**].  He has a history of hypercholesterolemia, idiopathic
thrombocytopenic purpura, status post splenectomy, and hairy
cell leukemia.  The patient is status post hernia repair and
has a history of hypothyroidism and depression.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q day, Flomax
0.4 mg p.o. q day, Plavix 75 mg p.o. q day, Restoril 15 mg
p.o. q h.s. p.r.n., Synthroid 50 mcg p.o. q day, Effexor
37.5 mg p.o. b.i.d., Celexa 20 mg p.o. q day, Vioxx 25 mg
p.o. q day, Trazodone 25 mg p.o. q h.s., Heparin 5000 units
subcutaneously b.i.d., Macrobid 100 mg p.o. q.i.d. for a
recent urinary tract infection, standing Tylenol and Morphine
p.r.n.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies, but he
had had a reaction to formaldehyde in the past which caused
him to have difficulty breathing.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient smoked for 30 years,
approximately 1 pack per day, but he does not smoke at this
time.  He does not drink.  The patient was a general
internist in the past and lived with his wife prior to his
recent hospitalization.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs included a
temperature of 96.1, a blood pressure of 178/60, a heart rate
of 76, respirations of 20 and an oxygen saturation of 98% on
4 liters and 94% in room air.  General Appearance:  Tired
appearing pleasant male in no apparent distress.  Awkwardly
positioned in bed.  HEENT:  Pupils equal, round and reactive
to light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements intact.
Dry mucous membranes.  No thrush.  Neck:  No jugular venous
distention.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs,
rubs or gallops.  Pulmonary:  Distant breath sounds but clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen:  Positive bowel
sounds.  Soft, non-tender and obese.  Status post splenectomy
and hernia repair.  Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or
edema.  Warm.  Good dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.  No
calf swelling or tenderness.  No cords palpated.  Neurologic
Exam:  Mental Status:  Pleasant, conversant.  Occasional
bizarre comments such as the patient attributing his first
pulmonary embolus to being out in the heat for to long.
Cranial nerves II, III, IV, VI, VII, IX, X, [**Doctor First Name 81**] and XII
grossly intact except for a right facial droop.  Sensation:
Facial sensation appeared to be okay.  Temperature sensation
was decreased on the left side.  Upper extremities were
grossly intact for sensation.  In the lower extremities, the
patient could name the correct side and area that was
touched, but, if touched on the right leg and asked to lift
that leg, the patient moved his left leg.  If asked to move
the "other leg", the patient can move the right leg.  Motor:
Strength was grossly intact at 4+ throughout the upper
extremities.  4+ throughout the left lower extremity.  4+ in
the right psoas muscle and 4- in the hamstrings, quadriceps
and gastrocnemius muscles.  Reflexes appeared to be intact.
Coordination:  The patient had significant dysmetria with
finger-to-nose testing.  He was too weak in his lower
extremities for rapid movement.  Gait was deferred secondary
to the increased fall risk secondary to lateral medullary
syndrome and secondary to his dizziness and light-headedness
from his pulmonary embolus.  We were concerned at that time
about increased bleeding risk with a fall given that the
patient was no a Heparin drip and supratherapeutic at that
time.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  The patient's white count was
7.4, hemoglobin 17.0 and hematocrit 48.9 with platelets of
212.  The patient had a normal differential except for 6
eosinophils.  Coagulation studies showed a PT of 13.1, a PTT
of 24.9 and an INR of 1.1.  Electrolytes included a sodium of
137, a potassium of 4.4, a chloride of 102 and a bicarbonate
of 25.  BUN was 17 and creatinine was 1.2.  Glucose was 86.
Urinalysis showed a large amount of blood, positive nitrites,
small leukocyte esterase, 21-50 white blood cells, many
bacteria, no yeast and less than 1 epithelial cell.  EKG
showed normal sinus rhythm at 68 beats per minute with
occasional PVCs.  There was left atrial enlargement and
normal axis and intervals.  The PR interval appeared to be
okay despite the patient's history of AV conduction block.
There were Q waves in 3, AVF, V1 and V2, and ST depression in
V2 through V4 with T wave flattening laterally.  This was
unchanged from a previous EKG, and the patient was ruled out
x3 for a myocardial infarction.  The patient's chest x-ray
was generally negative except for a tortuous and dilated
aorta.  A CT angiogram showed non-occlusive pulmonary
embolism in the right upper lobe, aneurysmal dilatation at
the origin of the left subclavian artery, dilatation of the
ectatic portion of the aorta at the diaphragmatic hiatus and
emphysema.

Given his recent stroke, the patient also had a CT of the
head performed which showed probable diffuse ectasia and
multiple areas of atherosclerotic calcification within the
tributaries of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**], probable polypoid area
of mucosal thickening partially obscuring the left sphenoid
air cells, to a lesser degree within both ethmoid sinuses and
to a minimal degree within the right maxillary sinus.  There
was no radiologic evidence for major vascular territorial
infarction that appeared acute.

Given the above and the patient's fluctuating neurologic
complaints, the patient was evaluated further with a MRI/MRA
of the brain.  This showed micro-vascular disease changes
with no clear evidence of brainstem infarction identifiable.
The MRA of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] did not demonstrate flow in
the right intracranial vertebral artery.  This was thought to
be related to slow flow in this vessel, occlusion or the
