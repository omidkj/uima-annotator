Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
hemoptysis/post-obstructive pneumonia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IR embolization of bleeding pulmonary site

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 51305**] is a 61 year old male smoker with 50 pack year
history, COPD, hemachromatosis, and multiple invasive squamous
cell
carcinoma/basal cell carcinoma who is being transferred to the
ICU for post-procedural monitoring following rigid bronchoscopy
for hemoptysis and likely post obstructive pneumonia.
.
He initially presented who had an episode of hemoptysis and
shortness of breath in the early AM prior to presenting to the
OSH. Patient reports that he had 2 episodes of hemoptysis of
approximately [**5-22**] oz.  There, he underwent a CT scan that showed
a mass obstructing the
left main stem bronchus with a post obstructive pneumonia on the
left. The patient was started on CAP coverage with
CTX/azithromycin, to which flagyl was added.   Patient denies
and fevers, chills, sweats. Patient reports a diminished
appetite, and 25 weight loss of the past 6-8 weeks. Patient
reports that he has difficulty walking greater than 50 feet
before he becomes short of breath and develops calf pain.
.
Of note, he has a major history of numerous squamous cell
carcinomas of the bilateral frontal and parietal scalp, probably
due to excessive sun exposure.  He receives dermatologic care
here at [**Hospital1 18**] from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] is to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1837**] for a
Mohs procedure of a recurrent left temporal lesion.  He believes
that he has melanoma of the left temporal region though this was
not demonstrated by recent pathology.  He also believes he has
melanoma of the lip.
.
He was initially admitted to the general medicine floor in
stable condition.  His oxygen saturations intermittently fell to
88-89% and he coughed up a few teaspoons of frank hemoptysis.
With a CXR demonstrating major left lower lobe collapse and
likely obstruction of the LMSB, decision was made to go directly
to OR for rigid bronchoscopy with subsequent MICU admission for
observation.
.
His bronchoscopy revealed a large blood clot in the left main
stem bronchus with a malignancy of 10% stenosis behind it.
There were multiple tumors in the airways of both LUL and LLL,
each of which were cauterized with good effect.  Distal slow
oozing was seen in smaller airways NOT amenable to bronchoscopic
intervention.  IP recommended IR for angiography/embolization in
the AM.
.
Upon return from the MICU, his initial vitals were:BP:150/65
P:76 R:18 O2:100% 2Lventuri mask.  He was comfortable without
complaints, though was still drowsy from anesthesia and a ROS
could not be ellicited

Past Medical History:
-Hemochromatosis
-COPD
-PVD

-lymphedema of LUE, RLE

use.  Major previous sun exposures.  ETOH intake ranges [**1-18**]
beers per day.

PATHOLOGY REPORT OF LUNG MASS
SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: right lower lobe endobronchial bx.

Procedure date    	Tissue received    	Report Date   	Diagnosed
by
[**2143-12-16**]	[**2143-12-17**]	[**2143-12-19**]	DR. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. [**Doctor Last Name **]/vf
DIAGNOSIS:

Lung, right lower lobe, endobronchial biopsy:
Squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiated.
Note:  The patient's history of cutaneous squamous cell
carcinoma is noted.  Although the endobronchial tumor may
represent metastasis from a cutaneous primary, a primary lung
squamous cell carcinoma cannot be excluded.

.
CT Head [**2143-12-16**]
There is no evidence of hemorrhage, infarction, shift of midline
structures, or mass effect. The ventricles and sulci are normal
in size and
configuration. The visible paranasal sinuses show small amount
of fluid
within the right maxillary sinus. Several tiny calcifications in
the left
frontal lobe (2:18, 2:11)and right frontal lobe (2:14) may be
sequelae of old infection. IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial
process, including large metastasis. If metastasis continue to
be a clinical concern, then an MR is recommended for further
evaluation.
.
LENIs [**2143-12-16**]
No DVT in the right lower extremity. Mild subcutaneous edema and
calcifications within the arterial vessels.
.
CXR [**2143-12-16**]
Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates marked
opacification
of the left middle and lower lung with significant volume loss
as evidenced by marked leftward cardiomediastinal shift. As
correlated to the preceding
reference CT from [**Hospital 882**] Hospital of the same day, there is
significant
endobronchial material obstructing the left main bronchus. There
is likely a combination of consolidation, bronchial wall
thickening, and pleural effusion in the left lung as well as
volume loss, producing the overall opacification. The right lung
remains relatively well aerated. There is evidence of underlying
emphysema, without radiographic evidence of pneumothorax.
Findings consistent with left main bronchial obstruction with
left middle and lower lobe collapse, in addition to
consolidation, bronchial wall thickening, and large left pleural
effusion. Overall constellations are highly concerning for
malignancy, although supervening infection and/or aspiration may
be present.
.
Embolization procedure [**2143-12-17**]
1. Single bronchial artery visualized supplying the left lung
with visualized tumor blush, embolized utilizing 500-700 micron
Embospheres.
2. Post-embolization arteriogram did not demonstrate any
bronchial arteries
either originating from the aorta or the internal mammary artery
supplying the left lung. Despite the suggestion that there is an
additional left bronchial arterial branch on the CT, this could
not be found despite using a number of different catheter
shapes. IMPRESSION: Successful uncomplicated embolization of
left bronchial artery utilizing 500-700 micron Embospheres.
.
CXR [**2142-12-18**]
In comparison with the study of [**12-17**], there has been some
re-aeration of the left lung following bronchoscopy. However,
extensive opacification persists and there is still shift of the
mediastinum to the left with hyperexpansion of the right lung.
Hazy opacification at the right base raises the possibility of
some atelectasis and effusion.
