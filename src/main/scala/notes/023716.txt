History of Present Illness:
This is an 84 year old male with CHF (EF 20%), CAD s/p CABG,
Afib on coumadin, HTN, h/o prostate CA, presents with dark
colored stools. Per the patient, he has been noting black stool
on the toilet paper intermittently for a few weeks. Also with
loose stools and occasional incontinence of stool. Has been
feeling more fatigued over the past month with mild exertion and

[**Name Initial (PRE) **] regularly scheduled follow-up visit. PCP checked hct which was
20 (from 30.4 in [**7-26**]). BP was reportedly 80/50 in PCP's office.
He was sent to the ED for further evaluation. The patient denies

fevers, chills, dizziness, lightheadedness, abdominal pain,
nausea, vomiting, or hematemesis. No chest pain or SOB. He does
mention that he had an EGD 2-3 years ago in [**State 108**] as part of a
dysphagia work-up and as far as he knows this was negative.
Colonoscopy here in [**8-/2165**] was only notable for polyps. He has
no known history of GI bleeding. Denies use of NSAIDS or
significant EtOH.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, vitals T 97.3, BP 97/42, HR 71, RR 18, SaO2
100%.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 84 year old male with history of CAD, CHF, Afib on
coumadin, who presented with fatigue, hematocrit drop, and
guaiac positive black stools.

# Hematocrit drop: This was felt to likely be secondary to upper
GI bleed in the setting of mildly supratherapeutic INR. Two
peripheral IV's, an active type and screen, and IV protonix were
initiated and maintained. The patient received a total of 5
units of PRBCs during hospitalization with serial HCTs revealing
stability at HCT of ~34. On the morning of [**2166-4-11**], his HCT was
32.3 and the patient was hemodynamically stable overnight. INR
then was down to 1.5. EGD on [**4-10**] revealed only mild gastritis,
which is unlikely to have caused a bleed this brisk and severe.
The patient was prepped for colonscopy on [**4-11**] during which GI
was unable to advance the scope beyond the sigmoid due to the
fixed loop formation likley secondary to previous abdominal
surgery. The procedure was an otherwise normal colonoscopy to
sigmoid colon. The patient underwent a CT colonography which
showed no evidence of masses or polyps in the colon.  The
patient underwent a capsule study which was still pending on
discharge.  As the patient was hemodynamically stable and Hct
remained stable in the 30s, the patient was restarted on aspirin
on [**2166-4-14**].  Coumadin was not restarting during his stay given
the risk of bleeding.

# Acute on CKD: At admission, the patient's Cr was up to 2.5
from baseline of 1.8. Etiology was likely pre-renal in the
setting of GI bleed. Following resuscitation, Cr has improved to
1.6 on [**4-14**]. BUN also trended down to 57 on [**4-14**], and was likely
elevated in setting of GI bleed.

# CAD: The patient has a history of multiple stents and CABG but
no chest pain. In the setting of GI bleed and hypotension,
aspirin, lisinopril, and nadolol were held on admission.
Eventually lisinopril, metoprolol and aspirin were restarted.
The patient was continued on zetia.

# Chronic Congestive heart failure (CHF): The last Echo in our
system is from [**2163**] with EF 20%. The patient appeared euvolemic
on admission. On admission, Lisinopril, Nadolol, Spironolactone,
and Lasix were held in the setting of GI bleed and borderline
BP.  Lisinopril and spironolactone were restarted, however had
to be held on numerous occassions because of borderline blood
pressures.  Eventually the patient was restarted on metoprolol,
but spironolactone was held.  The patient was discharged on
lisinopril, metoprolol and aspirin only with instructions to
check weights daily and report to VNA.

# Hypotension with history of hypertension (HTN): The patient on
admission was borderline hypotensive, however baseline SBP is
~90s to low 100s. On admission, Lisinopril, Nadolol, and Lasix
were held.  The patient remained with borderline blood pressures
during hospital stay.  Lisinopril and spironolactone were
restarted, however nadolol and lasix continued to be held.

# Afib: INR was supratherapeutic on admission. Coumadin was held
and INR reveresed with 10mg vitamin K in the setting of GI
bleed.  Coumadin was restarted prior to discharge.
