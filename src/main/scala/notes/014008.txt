Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the medical service and started on
a colonoscopy preparation, her pradexa was held and she was
started on a heparin drip.  She was taken to the GI suite on
[**2156-4-28**] for endoscopy which showed an "ulcerated mass with
necrotic base highly suggestive of carcinoma" in the cecum.  She
had a CT scan of the chest/abdomen/pelvis to assess for
metastasis and further define the tumor.  It confirmed
colonoscopy findings and did not show evidence of metastasis.

She was taken to the operating room for a right colectomy with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1120**] of colorectal surgery on [**2156-4-30**].  There was 500 cc of
estimated blood loss.Please refer to Dr.[**Name (NI) 3377**] operative note
for further details.    She was started on cipro/flagyl
prophylactically after the procedure. After a brief stay in the
PACU she was transferred to the floor but over the course of the
night had low urine output, her blood pressure dropped to the
systolic 80s/40s and her atrial fibrillation frequently took her
heart rate to the 120s-130s.  She was transferred to the ICU
given her extensive cardiac history and unclear etiology of her
hypotension -- cardiogenic vs. septic.  She was continued on
antibiotic coverage and the plan was for volume resuscitation
with close monitoring of other aspects of her clinical picture.
She was asymptomatic and felt well throughout the process,
though somewhat tired.

She was transfused one unit of PRBCs, volume resuscitated with
crystalloid and albumin and eventually her systolic pressures
returned to the 90s-100s systolic.  She was deemed stable for
transfer to the floor.  On POD 5 she reported passing flatus,
she was advanced in diet progressive to a low-residue regular
diet on POD 8.

Remaining aspects of her hospitalization, by systems:

Neuro: No issues.  Pain controlled on a regimen of IV and PO
medications when tolerating.  Mental status appropriate
throughout hospitalization.

Cardiac: Multiple cardiac issues assessed by cardiology service
preoperatively and which recommended continuing current care.
Multiple episodes of anginal chest pain relieved with sublingual
nitroglycerin.  No EKG changes until POD 7 when chest pain was
accompanied by questionable ischemic changes on EKG.  Cardiology
recommended nitroglycerin PRN as well as cycling enzymes which
returned at 0.05->0.05->0.04.  Her afib was monitored on
telemetry and she was treated with 5 mg IV lopressor q6 hours
when NPO and transitioned to 25 mg PO BID.

Respiratory:  Baseline used oxygen at home was kept on 2L oxygen
in the hospital and maintained good saturations in the high 90
percents.  She did have some respiratory difficulty and
increased oxygen requirement while in the ICU but this resolved
after effective diuresis.  At time of discharge satting 90s on
room air.

Heme:  Once the patient's hematocrit was stable, a heparin drip
was started to bridge her to coumadin therapy. However, patient
developed melenic stools and hematuria when heparin drip
restarted. All anticoagulation except aspirin was held and no
further episodes of bleeding occured. Patient's coumadin will
need to be restarted when her nutritional status is more
improved.

ID: Cipro/Flagyl initially post-operatively and dc'd on POD 7.
Afebrile throughout course. Complained of vaginal itching, given
single dose of oral diflucan.

[**Name (NI) 153**] Course
Pt was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**5-1**] for management of
hypotension and low urine output in setting of recent colectomy.

.
# Hypotension: Noted to be progressively hypotensive through
today (POD1) with concern for hypovolemia however could also be
related to evolving sepsis picture she is currently on
cipro/flagyl since last night. Given extensive cards history
could also be cardiogenic shock related to missed event given
her 500cc blood loss intraoperatively and prior hx of ischemic
event in setting of blood loss in 01/[**2155**]. Lower concern for
this given current clinical and exam status. Given hx of
recurrent UTIs (on home macrobid suppressive tx) could also be
related to urosepsis. Currently menta
