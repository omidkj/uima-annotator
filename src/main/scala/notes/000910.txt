GI Report
Blood was seen in 3rd portion of duodenum. Careful inspection of
the area with endoscopy, side viewing ERCP scope, and
colonoscope ultimately revealed an irregular appearing ulcer in
the distal 2nd to 3rd portion of duodenum (post-ampullary).
There was no active bleeding when these areas were inspected,
even with provocation with the tip of the endoscope. Distal to
this was an erythematous area on top of a protruding/pulsatile
submucosal mass which took up almost [**12-8**] of the lumen. Cytology
sent.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 83 year old female who was recently found
to have severe cardiac disease requiring a CABG/AVR.  She was
scheduled for elective repair on [**3-3**] but was found to have a
Hct of 17.  Her
surgery was cancelled.  GI was consulted for workup of a GI
bleed.
On endoscopy, she was noted to have a duodenal ulcer that was
not actively bleeding.  Additionally there was noted to be a
duodenal pulsatile bulge which was confirmed to be a 3cm
abdominal aortic aneursym on subsequent
CT scan.  Pt was extubated and after 48 hrs of stable hcts was
transferred to the floor.  She underwent bowel prep and
colonoscopy on [**3-7**] which was normal. Capsule endoscopy was
performed on [**3-8**]. She was discharged home with GI followup, and
follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] after her repeat endoscopy.
