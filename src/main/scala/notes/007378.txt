   RADIOLOGY  Final Report
MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2183-6-25**] 3:29 PM
MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST; MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST
Reason: ? evidence for embolic stroke.
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
84 year old woman with possible history of PFO/embolic stroke,
previously on coumadin admitted with left cerebellar hemorrhage,
s/p evacuation. Now with new AMS, aphasia.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
? evidence for embolic stroke.
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
MRI OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT GADOLINIUM. MRA OF THE BRAIN USING 3D
TIME-OF-FLIGHT TECHNIQUE.
HISTORY: History of embolic stroke on Coumadin, left cerebellar
hemorrhage status post evacuation and change in mental status.
Comparison is made with CT from the same day.
There are encephalomalacic and gliotic changes in the left
cerebellum with blood products relating to a hematoma
evacuation. There is no significant mass effect on the fourth
ventricle. Old infarction in the left frontal lobe is again
noted. There is a focus of restricted diffusion in the right
thalamus, which is probably related to old hemorrhage in this
site. There is an apparent focus of restricted diffusion in the
right frontal lobe, which is quite small. This could represent a
focus of subacute ischemia. There is no significant associated
mass effect. There is no midline shift. There is evidence for
prior hemorrhage or blood products in the right putamen, caudate
and to a lesser extent, the left basal ganglia.
Intracranial flow voids are maintained.
Ventricles and sulci are unchanged in size and configuration.
There is bilateral mastoid opacification.
MRA of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] demonstrates there is irregularity
of the right distal MCA extending to M2 branches. There is also
narrowing in the left interior M2 branch. These are likely
related to atherosclerotic disease. Bilateral distal PCA
irregularity and narrowing is also noted.

IMPRESSION:
Moderate small vessel ischemic sequela.
Small focus of restricted diffusion in the right frontal white
matter, which could represent a subacute infarction. There is no
associated mass effect or midline shift.
Atherosclerotic narrowing in the circle of [**Location (un) 431**], which does
not appear to be hemodynamically significant.

   RADIOLOGY   Preliminary Report

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW  [**2183-6-26**] 1:54 PM
VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW
Reason: ? aspiration, ? can advance diet.
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
84 year old woman with ICH, AVNRT, AMS with histor of dysphagia,
silent aspiration.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
? aspiration, ? can advance diet.
VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW
INDICATION: 84-year-old woman with intracranial hemorrhage,
presenting with aspiration.
COMPARISON: [**2183-6-20**].
FINDINGS: Oral and pharyngeal swallowing videofluoroscopy was
performed today in collaboration with speech and language
pathology. Various consistencies of barium were administered.
ORAL PHASE: There is moderate impairment of bolus formation and
prolongation of the mastication. The remainder of the oral phase
was within functional limits. There is mild coating of residue
after the _____ solids.
PHARYNGEAL PHASE: There is mild delay in swallow initiation and
mild reduction in laryngeal valve closure. The remainder of the
pharyngeal phase was within functional limits. Mild coating
remains in the valleculae after solid food and purees.
ASPIRATION/PENETRATION: There is intermittent penetration before
the swallow with thin liquids, no aspiration was seen today.
IMPRESSION: Mild-to-moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia but
improved from previous video swallow, resulting in intermittent
penetration with thin liquids, no aspiration was seen today.

EEG:
FINDINGS:
ABNORMALITY #1: Throughout the recording there were frequent
bursts of
mixed frequency generalized slowing.
ABNORMALITY #2: There were also bursts of mixed frequency
slowing seen
bilaterally and independently in temporal areas or a bit more
broadly,
with a mild rightsided emphasis.
BACKGROUND: Was somewhat disorganized but reached an 8 Hz alpha
frequency at times.
HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Produced symmetric driving.
SLEEP: The patient progressed from wakefulness to drowsiness but
did
not appear to enter stage II of sleep during this recording.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm with frequent
PVCs.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to the multifocal slowing described
above.
This suggests multifocal subcortical dysfunction. Vascular
disease is
the most common cause at this age. Nevertheless, there were no
areas of
very prominent and fixed focal slowing. There were no
epileptiform
features.

[**6-10**] TTE:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The estimated cardiac index is high (>4.0L/min/m2). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The ascending aorta is markedly dilated The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-15**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal systolic function. Mild aortic regurgitation, mild to
moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Markedly dilated ascending aorta.


Brief Hospital Course:
84F with h/o stroke and temporal arteritis admitted with
cerebellar hemorrhage, s/p evacuation, transferred to MICU after
code blue in setting of AVNRT, required intubation for airway
protection, rapidly extubated.  After transfer to general
medical floor she had a recurrent episode of AVNRT prompting
transfer to the cardiology service.

# S/p cerebellar hemorrhage: s/p evacuation on [**6-9**].  Has been
stable, on head CT [**6-25**], no evidence o
