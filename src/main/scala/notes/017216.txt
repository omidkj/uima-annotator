Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 19987**] is a 67 y/o spanish-speaking woman with h/o
tracheobronchomalacia s/p Y stent placement and removal, DM2,
CVA admitted with lingual tonsillitis and concern for subtotal
supralaryngeal airway obstruction on CT scan, no airway
obstruction on evaluation by ENT.

1)Tonsilitis with subtotal airway impingement- She was initially
transferred from [**Hospital3 **] to the MICU for concern for
airway obstruction.  She was continued on IV methylprednisolone
and IV clindamycin overnight.  She remained stable with no
respiratory compromise.  Airway was felt to be widely patent per
ENT examination. On speaking with patient the chronicity of this
is unclear as she is currently reporting that the tonsilar
enlargement, right jaw pain and difficulty passing food have all
been chronic symptoms for years with no recent worsening,
however she did have recent URI and sore throat which made
things more difficult for her. She was evaluated by speech and
swallow and is safely swallowing thin liquids. Purees are
easiest for her but she can safely advance as tolerated. No
evidence of aspiration risk. Monospot was negative amd blood
cultures with no growth.  She was discharged to complete a five
day course of clindamycin.  Steroids were stopped on the day
after admission.

2) Jaw pain, throat discomfort, arm/leg pain/numbness - all are
long standing chronic issues, patient denies any acute
worsening.  PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] aware of these issues and will
continue to manage in an outpatient setting.

3) Chronic diastolic CHF - euvolemic on admission, now slightly
dry with uptrending bicarbonate and BUN likely due to continuing
furosemide with limited po intake.  Furosemide was stopped on
[**11-26**] and held on discharge and po intake was encouraged.  She
was continued diltiazem.

3)Afib s/p left temporal CVA - currently in paced rhythm at a
normal rate. INR supratheraputic likely [**3-16**] clindamycin.
Warfarin was held starting [**11-26**] and was not restarted on
discharge as still on clindamycin.  She will have INR check on
[**11-30**] with communication with PCP before resuming her coumadin.


4)Normocytic anemia - hematocrit has been stable over the past
year. Unclear what workup she has had for this by PCP but would
benefit from iron studies, b12, folate, colonoscopy as oupatient
if not already done.

5)DM2 - no acute issues.  She was on insulin sliding scale
during her admission as metformin was held.  Metformin resumed
upon discharge.  She is not on ASA or ACEI.  She will follow up
with her PCP regarding consideration of starting these
medications.

6)HTN - stable.  She was continued on imdur, diltiazem.  Lasix
was held for minor dehydration.

7)COPD - stable, no evidence of exacerbation.  She was continued
on her outpatient advair, albuterol prn.

8)Depression - stable, continue fluoxetine

9)Code status: FULL (confirmed with daughter [**11-25**])
