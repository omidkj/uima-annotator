Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted [**2122-5-17**] with increasing dyspnea and
decreased oxygen saturation with a worsening nonproductive
cough. The respiratory symptoms were thought be secondary to CHF
and COPD exacerbations with possible pneumonia. She was started
on ceftrixone & vancomycin for consideration of nosocomia
pneumonia and given supplemental oxygen.
On HD2 she became increasingly dyspneic and tachycardic. She was
given Lasix and her steroid dose was increased to 40mg. Her
rapid afib was controlled with parenteral diltiazem, and then
with digoxin.
On HD3 a family meeting was held to discuss the prognosis and
goals of care. It was decided to provide comfort measures and
keep them informed of her progression. Over the course of HD 4
the patient had increased work of breathing and falling urine
output. Housestaff was called to the bedside on 7/0/04 when the
patient was noted to be apneic and pulseless. She was pronounced
dead and the family was notified.
