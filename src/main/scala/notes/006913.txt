Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
paradoxical vocal cord paralysis, inspiratory stridor

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
34 y.o. W with history of questionably steroid-dependent asthma
presenting with chest tightness and dyspnea. The patient reports
worsening shortness of breath X 2 days. She was admitted to
[**Hospital1 18**] with asthma flare in [**4-26**] and treated with an 18-day
prednisone taper. The patient says this episode began as back
pain about two days ago, which then migrated to her chest and
abdomen. She began to feel SOB and tried to take nebs without
improvement. The chest pain is typical of her usual episodes of
SOB, and she describes it as a tight squeezing around her rib
cage. She has it chronically, off and on. This time the pain
persisted and so she came to the ED.
.
In the ED, patient has a CXR which was normal. Per report, she
had an ECG which may have had some new diffuse T-wave changes.
She refused ASA. She had a upper airway scope and per report had
paradoxical vocal cord movement. She was treated with 10 mg of
IV Valium with some relief. Given her history of multiple
intubations, and persistence of inspiratory stridor, she was
admitted to the MICU for close monitoring.
.
On arrival to the unit patient says that she is breathing
comfortably but complains of persistent chest and R back pain.
Denies any recent symptoms of illness - no cough, congestion,
urinary or bowel symptoms.

CXR: SINGLE PORTABLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: Technically
limited study due to underpenetration and soft tissue scatter.
Low lung volumes are noted. Within these limitations, no focal
pulmonary opacities. There is no pleural effusion. Linear
subsegmental atelectasis at the left lung base is noted.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Pulmonary vasculature is
within normal limits. There is no pneumothorax.



Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 34 y.o. W with history of questionably steroid-dependent
asthma presenting with chest tightness and dyspnea.
.
# Paradoxical vocal cord dysfunction: The patient was initially
admitted to the intensive care unit due to feelings of acute
shortness of breath and stridor. A chest X-ray showed no acute
abnormalities and EKG was within normal limites without evidence
of ischemia. By report, visualization of the vocal cords
displayed evidence of abnormal vocal cord movement. She was
treated convervatively. She was not intubated, she was given
frequent albuterol nebulizer treatments and continued on her
maintanence asthma medications. She had no evidence of airway
compromise or O2 desaturations. She was seen by speech and
swallow and felt that she would benefit from speech therapy
(note in chart). She should also have ENT follow-up for further
management.
.
# Epigastric pain: This resolved upon admission without
intervention and she was continued on a diabetic diet.
.
# Chest pain: She intermittently had discomfort, but pt reported
that this was baseline for her. Her pain improved with nebulizer
treatments and as above had normal EKG and cardiac enzymes were
normal.
.
# Right flank pain: She was started on a lidocaine patch for her
chronic R flank pain. She had no evidence of UTI.
.
# DMII: She was continued on NPH, though pm dose transiently
lowered due to relative am hypoglycemia. She was discharged on
usual dose.
.
# HTN: Stable, continued on home medications of lisinopril and
HCTZ
.
# Schizophrenia/mood: The patient was seen by psychiatry and
felt to have a personality disorder vs cyclothymia vs bipolar
disorder, needing further evaluation given short stay and prior
history of polysubstance abuse. She was seen previously at [**Hospital1 112**]
but wants to transfer her care here. She recently learned that
her brother died suddenly and did express the urge to cut
herself when she is sad. She endorsed that she would not do this
and would be safe at her mother's house. Please see Dr. [**Name (NI) 93743**] note for details. All outpatient depression and mood
stabilizing medications were held.
.
# Seizure disorder: Held depakote or dilantin given no
documentation of seizure disorder and levels of these meds zero
on admission suggesting that she was not taking them.
