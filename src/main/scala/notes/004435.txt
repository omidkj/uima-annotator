Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2356**]
Chief Complaint:
S/p fall, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
52 yo F w/ h/o MDS, hypothyroidism, questionable seizures,
presents after fall x 2 at home, found to be hypotensive. Pt
states that she falls "occasionally" at home, and can predict
when she does; she associates with having a seizure. Over the
past 4-5 days pt reports not feeling well; first had 2 days of
migraines, then during the following days she had persistent
n/v, anorexia, and watery diarrhea, several bowel movements per
day. She had no po intake. She noted a low grade temp to 99 F
four days ago, but has since denied fevers or sick contacts.
Yesterday morning while getting up from bed she was light
headed, vertiginous, and felt herself falling forward. She
states she was unable to keep herself from falling forward and
hit her nose. She then hit her neck/back as she flung herself
backwards to try to get up. She suffered a nosebleed but no LOC.
She finally came to the ED after her PCP's suggestion.

In ED here on arrival she was noted to have a BP of 66/40, P 66
which improved to SBP 70s after 2L NS. However, because of
persistent hypotension, she eventually received total 9L NS. She
was also placed on DA which was gradually weaned off. She had a
head CT showing no bleed but + paravertebral soft tissue
thickening concerning for ?bleed vs. other fluid. Her neck MRI
demonstrated a prevertebral fluid collection without enhancement
or evidence of fracture.  no cord compresssion appreciated.
ROS: denies URI sxs, cough, current nausea, abdominal pain,
melena, BRBPR, hematemesis. +sensation of lump in throat,
thirst, hunger.

CXR: Interval development of interstitial edema with septal
lines and upper zone redistribution

CT head: no hemorrhage, paravertebral soft tissue thickening on
scout image

CT spine: Diffuse infiltration of retropharyngeal space from
inferior pharynx to C5 laterally to bilateral carotids

CT abdomen: 1. Marked diffuse symmetric wall thickening seen
throughout the stomach extending into the first portion of the
duodenum, likely represents edema. Given the patient's recent
chest x-ray documenting short-interval development of
interstitial edema, ?volume overload, possibly vasculitis. 2.
Small amount of ascites and pelvic free fluid. 3. Bibasilar
atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions. 4. No
evidence of solid organ injury within the abdomen

ECG: NSR at 60 bpm, nl axis, slightly prolonged QTc

[**10-21**] Cervical MRI: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of cord
compression or abnormal signal. There is no evidence of discitis
or epidural abscess. There is prevertebral fluid accumulation in
the upper cervical region. There is no definite evidence of
focal disc protrusion or canal stenosis. Alignment is
maintained. There is no definite evidence of marrow injury.

IMPRESSION: Prevertebral fluid accumulation as described. This
could represent an infectious process and abscess formation,
although I do not see a great deal of marginal contrast
enhancement. There is no evidence of epidural abscess or
discitis. The collection does not appear to represent blood nor
do I see definite evidence of vertebral fracture

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 52 yo F w/ h/o MDS, multiple other medical problems, here
w/ hypotension after several days of n/v/d.

1. Hypotension:
We thought that her hypotension was probably secondary to
intravascular volume depletion due to several days of nausea,
vomiting and diarrhea.  She responded to IV fluids and was
easily weaned off her dopamine drip with her systolic blood
pressures consistently in the 130s with concomitant transfer
from the ICU to the medicine floor. We also entertained the
diagnosis of sepsis but thought that this was less likely since
her WBC was normal, she was afebrile and no longer hypotensive.
Blood cultures and urine cultures were drawn.  The urine culture
was negative and the results of the blood culture are still
pending at this time. We did not find evidence for a cardiogenic
etiiology of her hypotension since her cardiac enzymes were
normal and there were not ECG changes.  The diagnosis of adrenal
insufficiey was also considered by her electrolytes were normal
making this less likely.

2.Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea:We thought that her GI symptoms may
have been secondary to a viral infection as they resolved upon
admission and did not recur.

3. S/p Fall
We were unsure about the etiology of her fall and thought that
it could possibly have been due to her hypovolemia leading to
orthostasis, questionable vasovagal (although not a classic
story), seizures, h/o arrhythmia, holter in past reportedly had
+ tachyarthymia to 180s in the past and the pt is currently
followed by cardiologist. Upon completion of fluid resucitation
and the maintenance of a stable of blood pressure, the patient
was evaluated by PT and was considered to be safe to go home.
Thus, we thought that her fall was probably secondary to
orthostatis caused by volume depletion base on its response to
re-hydration.

4. Prevertebral fluid collection: The patient was evluated by
neurosurgery and this fluid collection was not thought to be
secondary to fracture or infection.  She was instructed to wear
a neck collar and will follow up in neurosurgery clinic two
weeks after discharge.  (See discharge follow up.)

5. Seizures: She was continued on her neurontin as advised by
her PCP.
-
6. MDS: She continued to receive epogen.

7. Acute Renal Failure: Her elevated creatinine responded well
to re-hydration and thus her acute renal failure was considered
to be secondary to hypovolemia.

8. Metabolic acidosis: Upon fluid resuscitation with normal
saline the patient devloped a mild metabolic acidosis which
resolved
