Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
 Ms. [**Known lastname 98925**] is an 85-year-old female with a history of
inflammatory polyarthritis, HTN, HL, s/p bowel resection for
SBO, OA, MS, restrictive lung disease, c.diff, and recent
admission for high grade SBO who presents from rehab with
hypoxia, shortness of breath, and altered mental status.
.
From limited history available during initial evaluation, it
appears as though patient was hypoxic into the 70s at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3075**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] rehab in [**Location (un) **], and was started on PNA treatment with
doxycycline on [**2147-12-26**].  Labs obtained on the same day also
showed a WBC of 15 and a bicarb of 40.  Patient was initially
resistant to coming into the ED, but eventually acquiesced.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were: 98.4 76 168/60 24 98% 4L nasal
Cannula.  Patient was given linazolid (allergy to vancomycin)
and levofloxacin for presumed HAP.  She was also given a stress
dose of steroids as she is on prednisone at baseline.  Pressures
dropped into the 70s and RIJ was placed.  A fluid bolus was
given and pressures came up; no pressors were started.  Labs
were significant for a wbc of 11, a BUN of 40 and creatinine of
1.2 (baseline of 0.6).  Troponin was elevated though only
non-specific changes on EKG and patient was given ASA 81.
Patient was confirmed DNR/DNI.  Vitals on admission were: HR of
86, BP: 113/39, RR 29, 95% on 4L.

##########################
Patient passed

Studies
CXR [**2147-12-27**]
A new central venous catheter has been placed via right internal
jugular venous approach. The tip terminates in the right atrium.
A
right-sided PICC line has been removed. The cardiac, mediastinal
and hilar
contours appear unchanged. There is a new patchy left basilar
opacity
suggesting pneumonia. Otherwise background opacities show no
definitive
change, although there may be additional developing right
basilar opacity.
Bony deformities are similar. IMPRESSION: New line terminating
in the right atrium. No evidence for pneumothorax, although a
flexed chin does obscure the medial right lung apex. Findings
suggesting pneumonia, particularly in the left lower lung.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 98925**] is an 85-year-old woman with a pmhx. significant for
inflammatory polyarthritis on prednisone, HTN, HL, SBOs, recent
c.diff colitis, and recent PNA who resides in a nursing home and
presented with shortness of breath and elevated white count.
.
#. Pneumonia: The patient was noted to be hypoxic into the 70s
at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3075**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] rehab in [**Location (un) **]. She was started on PNA
treatment there with doxycycline on [**2147-12-26**].  Labs obtained on
the same day showed a WBC of 15 and a bicarb of 40. ED visit was
suggested but the patient was initially resistant. At the urging
of her family, the patient was brought to the ED on [**2148-12-26**].
In the ED the patient was initially HD stable. Given linezolid
and levofloxacin for presumed HAP. Also given stress dose
steroids. While in the ED the patient's SBP dropped into the 70s
and RIJ was placed. A fluid bolus was given and pressures came
up; no pressors were started. Transferred to the MICU. In the
MICU the patient was placed on linezolid and cefepime initially.
The cefepime was changed to levofloxacin. The patient remained
afebrile and BPs remained stable. She refused a PICC line. Her
respiratory status was tenuous and she was confirmed DNR/DNI.
Intermittently desaturated to the 60-70% range on nasal cannula
but refused face-tent or NRB. Family was consulted who did not
want to force the patient to accept NRB/face-tent against her
wishes. PICC line was also refused. On [**2148-12-28**] the patient
continued to maintain adequate BPs and was transferred to the
medical floor for further management.
.
#. GOALS OF CARE: The patient is DNR/DNI. Her son is her health
care proxy. On admission here the paitent was refusing multiple
interventions including mask ventilation and PICC line
placement. Discussion was initiated with the patient's son and
daughter who confirmed DNR/DNI but were not prepared to accept
comfort focused care. Would like the patient to continue
recieving antibiotic therapy. Palliative care was consulted who
met with the patient and her family. On the floor patient was
made comfortable and passed a few hours after transfer to the
floor.
.
#. ELEVATED TROPONINS: Troponin was elevated to 0.21 on
admission without worrisome EKG changes. CKMB was reassuring.
Likely strain in the setting of acute infection.  Little concern
for plaque rupture given absence of ST changes on EKG, chest
pain, or other classic signs/symptoms of MI. Continued ASA and
statin.
.
#. ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Patient with creatinine of 1.2 up from
a baseline of 0.6.  Likely dehydration or could represent poor
forward flow from CHF exacerbation. Resolved with fluid
administration.
.
#. ILD:  Continued home inhalers and pulmonary toilet
.
#. HYPERLIPIDEMIA:  Continued statin
