Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Erythromycin Base / prednisone

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**]
Chief Complaint:
L arm and L leg weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 50 year-old R-handed woman with PMHx of
hypothyroidism, distant hx of Hodgkins lymphoma s/p chemotherapy
and radiation, now s/p pacemaker placement on [**2103-11-30**] for 3rd
degree heart block of unknown origin who presents as a code
stroke with new L arm and L leg weakness.
.
Pt reports that yesterday ([**2103-11-30**]) she had her pacemaker placed
without issue, but they told her she should be on bedrest, so
she
didn't get up after her operation.  She noticed that her L arm
and shoulder hurt near where the pacemaker was placed.  The next
morning ([**2103-12-1**]) she woke up to go to the bathroom and other
than
some L arm soreness felt normal.  However, she was then gotten
out of bed at 10am to go to a CXR, and she felt her L leg "give
out", and she felt it was too weak to support her weight.  So,
she was sat down by the nurses, told to rest, and when the
transportation team came to get her again at 11am, she was able
to get up and walk to the stretcher without difficulty.  She
doesn't know how quickly the weakness went away over that 1 hour
time period.  She was then discharged home at around 2pm and had
no difficulty walking to the car, or walking out of the car into
her home.  She was watching the football game at around 4:30pm
(although she thinks could have been as early as 3:30pm or as
late as 5pm), when she felt lightheaded and sweaty, and then
noticed she couldn't hold herself up on the cough, and tried to
scoot up.  However, she realized at the point she couldn't move
her L leg.  She didn't notice any difficulty with her L arm, but
she was "trying to keep it from moving" because of her recent
pacemaker placement on that side.  Her family debated if she
should go to the hospital, eventually decided and brought her to
the ED.
.
In the ED a code stroke was called for her L leg weakness, and
she was found to have a R ACA stroke as described below.
.
Of note, pt reports H/A every other day since [**Holiday **],
bilaterally "behind my eyes", and that she would frequently wake
up with them, but they never woke her from sleep.
.
On neuro ROS, the pt reports L leg weakness as above, denies
current headache, loss of vision, blurred vision, diplopia,
dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus or
hearing difficulty. Denies difficulties producing or
comprehending speech.  Denies numbness, parasthesiae. No bowel
or
bladder incontinence or retention.
.
On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or
chills.  No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denies
cough, shortness of breath.  Denies chest pain or tightness,
palpitations.  Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation
or
abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
No
dysuria.  Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rash.
