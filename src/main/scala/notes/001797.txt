Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4679**]
Chief Complaint:
Pericardial effusion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 69 year old gentlemen with medical history
significant for emphysema and is status-post neoadjuvent
chemoradiation and thoracotomy with left upper lobectomy
[**2129-12-20**] for stage IIIA T2N2 squamous cell carcinoma who
returned to [**Hospital1 18**] with complaint of shortness of breath and CXR
findings at his PCP's demonstrating a left lower lobe infiltrate
concerning for pneumonia. At presentation he described 5 days of
progressively worsening dyspnea.

Patient been discharged home with physical therapy services
after his operation and had been progressing well until 5 days
prior to admission when he began noticing increasing dyspnea
while climbing stairs during the 2
days prior to admission he also experience dyspnea while walking
on flat surfaces and with speech. By the morning of present
admission Mr. [**Known lastname **] was requiring 4L of nasal home oxygen.

He was scheduled to see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in clinic [**2130-1-10**] but due to his
continued worsening dyspnea he presented to his PCP at [**Hospital1 2292**] and was noted on CXR to have a left lower lobe
infiltrate with and elevated WBC count to 19 with left shift, as
well as an INR of 8. (Patient had been discharged from the
hospital on a Lovenox bridge to Coumadin for history of left
lower extremity DVT and pulmonary embolism). He was subsequently
sent to the ED at
[**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

At the time of presentation the patient denied chest pain,
pleuritic pain, headaches, dizziness, fever, chills, nausea,
vomiting, changes in bowel or bladder habits, prolonged
bleeding, easy bruising, or changes in weight did endorse
continued decreased appetite. He had recently completed a course
of Levaquin for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia.

Past Medical History:
Oncology History:
PET CT [**2129-8-10**]: FDG-avid LULlarge 49x40mm lung lesion is seen
highly concerning for lung cancer. There are FDG-avid

6 lymph nodes, which were positive for metastatic carcinoma on
frozen sections; final pathology showed poorly differentiated
squamous cell carcinoma with extensive necrosis histologically
similar to the prior lung sample.

[**9-/2129**]: Started cisplatin and VP-16 as well as radiotherapy as
neoadjuvant treatment before a definitive surgery

squamous cell lung carcinoma

Past Surgical History:
Left VATS with biopsy of peri-aortic lymph node [**2129-9-9**]
Left thoracotomy, left upper lobectomy, mediastinal lymph node

intercostal muscle [**2129-12-20**]
Subxiphoid pericardial window [**2129-1-11**]

yrs ago, drinks 3 glasses of EtOH/week and denies use of illegal
drugs


Family History:
Mother died of pancreatic cancer, father had Parkinsons.  No
other history of cancer or blood clotting disorders

Physical Exam:
GENERAL: No acute distress; alert and fully oriented; pleasant
and cooperative
HEENT: Mucous membranes moist and pink; nasal canula in place;
no ocular or nasal discharge; no scleral icterus; no skin
lesions
CARDIAC: Regular rate and rhythm; normal S1 and S2; no
appreciable murmumurs
CHEST: Left thoracotomy incision healing well; no erythema or
induration
PULMONARY: Crackles at lung bases bilaterally; slightly
diminished breath sounds on left side
ABDOMEN: Soft, non-tender, non-distended; no palpable masses; no
rebound or gaurding; healing vertical incision in sub-xiphoid
region
EXTREMITIES: Moderate bilateral lower extremity edema
bilaterally

RADIOLOGY:
CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST [**2130-1-10**]:
Findings:
A large pericardial effusion, with attenuation characteristics
of bloody or
exudative fluid has developed, impinging on the right atrium and
right
ventricle, suggesting cardiac tamponade.
Severe consolidation in the post-operative left lung, extending
from the
superior segment to the upper regions of the basal segments has
worsened, and
extensive consolidation in the right lung is largely new, in the
anterior
segment of the right upper lobe, the right middle lobe, and the
right lower
lobe, most pronounced in the superior segment.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient underwent a CT of the chest in the ED which
demonstrated a large pericardial effusion impairing right
ventricular function. He was transported to the cath lab for
pericardialcentesis and approx 875cc of bloody fluid was
successfully drained. The pericardial fluid was sent for
cytology and a drain was left in place. The patient had
improvement in his dyspnea symptoms, however a TTE performed the
following morning was significant for a continued moderate
pericardial effusion that was reported to be echo-dense and
consistent with blood - despite the minimal output from his
pericardial drain. Cytology results of the pericardial fluid
returned negative for malignant cells.

It was decided at that time that the patient would benefit from
a pericardial window procedure. He was appropriately pre-op'ed
and consented, and underwent a sub-xiphoid pericardial window
procedure with placement of IVC filter for DVT prophylaxis (due
to the importance of discontinuation of his anticoagulation due
to his hemopericardium and drastically supra-therapeutic INR).
The patient was transferred to the ICU post-op for close cardiac
monitoring, and a bedside ECHO did not demonstrate any
significant re-accumulation of fluid on post-operative day 1.
However, the patient's ICU course was complicated by a short
bout of V-tach and two short episodes of atrial fibrillation
with rapid ventricular response which resolved spontaneously
without intervention.

By post-operative day 3 the patient was weaned off all pressors,
and by post-operative day 4 he was stable for transfer out of
the ICU and to the floors following removal of his pericardial
drain.

The patient's post-operative course continued to be complicated
by episodes of atrial fibrillation/ectopy with heart rates in
the 120's while ambulating. His Metoprolol was increased to
3-time daily dosing and a Cardiology consult was obtained. Per
the recommendations of the Cardiology team the patient was begun
on Amiodarone: 400mg [**Hospital1 **] loading dose x1 week to be followed by
200mg [**Hospital1 **] x3 weeks and then decreased to maintenance dose of
200mg daily. Additionally, Cardiology recommended ASA 325mg
(daily) alone for anticoagulation due to his risk of bleeding
and the low likelihood that his (presumed temporary)
post-operative atrial fibrillation would pose a risk for
thrombus formation.
