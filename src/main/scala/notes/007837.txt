Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2108**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 72 year old woman with a history of
chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure, mild COPD, mild pulmonary
hypertension, and diffuse lung disease related to her small cell
lung cancer and radiation fibrosis.  She presents today after
waking up with significant difficulty breathing.  She ultimately
was able to get to her albuterol inhaler which gave her some
relief.  She reports always having oxygen saturation in the mid
80s, but that this morning she was in the 50s.  She denies
feeling any associated chest pain, headache, nausea, vomiting,
fevers, chills, or URI prodrome.
.
In the ED vital signs were, T 98.2 HR 112 BP 124/79 RR 16 SpO2
70% RA. With oxygen saturation in the 70s patient was able to
talk in full sentences. CXR performed suggested a left lower
lobe consolidation.  CTA showed no evidence of pulmonary
embolism or dissection but suggested possible LUL and LLL
consolidations. Patient remained afebrile and labs were notable
for WBC 17.  She was given vancomycin and levaquin empirically.
.
EKG on presentation showed afib with RVR and her baseline RBBB.
Troponin returned elevated at 0.35. Due to her aspirin allergy
she was not given aspirin. Cardiology was called and recommended
trending cardiac enzymes and repeating EKG.  They did not
recommend clopidogrel at this time as they believed this enzyme
leak was much more likely due to demand from her hypoxia and her
atrial fibrillation with RVR. She was not started on a heparin
gtt as her INR was therapeutic at 3.1. She subsequently received
diltiazem 20 mg IV x 2 and diltiazem 30 mg po x 2 with minimal
affect on rate control so she was started on a diltiazem gtt.
.
On arrival to the ICU, she reports feeling much better.  She
denies recent hospitalizations, steroid use, antibiotic use,
sick contacts, or travel. She admits that this is a difficult
time of year for her respiratory status every year.  She reports
being up to date on her influenza and pneumovax vaccinations
(confirmed in OMR).  She also reports that her baseline oxygen
saturation on 3L NC is usually in the low 80%s.  Per prior notes
in OMR her goal SpO2 is > 85%.
.
On review of symptoms she denies chest pain, nausea, vomiting,
diaphoresis, leg weakness, palpitations, lightheadedness,
pleuritic chest pain, upper respiratory symptoms, black or
bloody stools.  She does admit to occasional leg cramping that
she attributes to dehydration.

IMAGING:
[**2182-10-30**] CXR:
1. Right hilar mass and medial right upper lobe opacity again
seen without
significant change. Increased left mid-to-lower lung opacity may
be due to
infectious process, although malignant involvement cannot be
entirely
excluded.

[**2182-10-30**] CTA:
1. No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic dissection.
2. Moderate partially loculated right pleural effusion, not
significantly
changed since [**2175-4-30**].
3. Left upper lobe and left lower lobe consolidations, which are
new from
prior study. The differential includes infection with possible
areas of
aspiration and/or inflammatory process, but new malignant foci
cannot be
entirely excluded.
4. Loculated fluid within the left major fissure is slightly
increased from prior study.

Brief Hospital Course:
71 year-old woman with limited stage small cell lung cancer,
COPD, radiation pneumonitis, and obstructive sleep apnea was
admitted with hypoxia.

Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  possible PNA as well as Afib RVR
contributing to desaturation

Patient reports increased work of breathing, increased cough,
increased sputum production, and drop in SpO2 (to 50%) since
waking up the morning of admission.  She was found to be
significantly hypoxic with a leukocytosis in the Emergency
Department. She denies any fevers or chills.  She did not appear
clinically volume overloaded on exam. Her poor air movement on
exam raises concern for a COPD exacerbation.  CTA performed in
the Emergency Department showed no evidence of PE to account for
her hypoxia.  The CT did, however, suggest two areas of
consolidation that may represent infectious versus malignant
processes. She was started on empiric antibiotic therapy in the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and aztreonam given her
penicillin allergy, aztreonam d/c.  Regimen simplified to
levofloxacin alone as no evidence of MRSA.  She was discharged
after 6 total days of antibiotics.

She is clinically much improved.  Able to ambulate without
significant dyspnea and feel
