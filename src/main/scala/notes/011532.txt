.
CXR [**3-15**]: Findings consistent with congestive heart failure.
.
CXR 4/07:1. Right hilar opacity, concerning for pneumonia.
Recommend followup to
resolution to exclude underlying mass.
2. Unchanged volume overload.
.
[**3-21**] CXR :Comparison is made to the previous study from [**2202-3-17**].
There is unchanged cardiomegaly.
There is interval increase in the bilateral pleural effusions,
left side worse than right. Consolidation in the lung bases
cannot be excluded. There is again seen some prominence of the
interstitial markings consistent with fluid overload which is
stable.
.
[**3-22**] KUB: No evidence of bowel obstruction.
.
[**3-24**] CXR: final read pending


Brief Hospital Course:
85 F with HTN, chronic systolic and diastolic HF, h/o PE
admitted with PNA and atrial fibrillation with RVR.  During this
admission, goals of care discussion was held with family and
HCP, with plan to transition to hospice.
.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure- evidence of pneumonia on CXR, pt
was treated with vancomycin, levofloxacin and zosyn and
supportive care and respiratory status and oxygen sats initially
improved with treatment, however then pt developed pleural
effusions and increased work of breathing.  CHF exacerbation was
thought to be less likely given that pt appeared clinically dry.
 After discussion with the family and HCP, it was decided that
the pt would not want to have thorocentesis and request was made
for a focus on comfort.
.
# Atrial fibrillation with RVR- has biatrial enlargement on past
TTE. Suspect PNA as trigger for this. Patient initially started
on dilt gtt in the ICU setting, at most was on 15, but weaned
off on AM of [**3-16**], and restarted on PO metoprolol and diltiazem
with improved rate control.  Anticoagulation was held after
discussion with the family out of concern for recurrent GI bleed
and focus on comfort.
.
# Acute renal failure- improved with volume repletion
.
# Delirium- likely due to PNA and afib RVR.  She initially
improved with control of her afib and abx, however pleural
effusions developed and the pt became less responsive and less
interactive.  Focus was switched to comfort.
.
# GERD- she was continued on her home PPI
.
# HTN- clonidine was held during the hospitalization and on
discharge given low BPs
.
# Psychiatric- meds were held given unclear indication.
.
# Code- DNR/DNI status was confirmed with HCP.  Decision was
made to focus on comfort and transfer back to nursing facility
with hospice consult on arrival.
