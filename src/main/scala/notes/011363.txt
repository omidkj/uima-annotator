Imaging:
CXR [**2166-10-23**]: No evidence of acute disease.  Moderate hiatal
hernia.
Thyroid Scan Technetium [**2166-10-24**]: Globally decreased tracer
uptake in the thyroid gland compatible with sub-acute
thyroiditis.

Brief Hospital Course:
49 yo woman who presented with tachycardia, agitation, and n/v
in the setting of a decreased TSH and elevated free T4 c/w
thyrotoxicosis and hyperthyroidism.

ACUTE CARE
# Tachycardia/Hyperthyroidism:  Her decreased TSH (<0.2) and
increased free T4 (2.4) suggest a hyperthyroid state.
Endocrinology had a low suspicion for thyroid storm given her
history and physical exam with no overt signs of heart failure
at this point. The most likely etiology of her hyperthyroidism
is thyroiditis given findings of uptake scan. The patient was
started on Propanolol 10mg q6h PRN heart rate. The patient's
thyroid antibodies were pending at time of discharge. The
patient will have repeat thyroid function tests in one week to
monitor her course, and she should have follow up regarding her
thyroid function, ideally with endocrinology or with her PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 3754**] is no indication for treatment with PTU in the setting of
thyroiditis.

CHRONIC CARE
# Hypokalemia: Reports taking Potassium chloride 10 mEq as an
outpatient before this past month of symptoms. At the OSH she
was reported to be hypokalemic. On admission her potassium was
4.2. She has been taking KCl since she presented to the OSH one
week ago. Possibly secondary to increased catecholamines from
the thyroid storm leading to intracellular shift of postassium.
[**Month (only) 116**] also be exacerbated by hydrochlorothiazide and salmeterol.

# Nausea: Presented witn nausea and vomiting. Cont home Zofran
PRN nausea

# Asthma: Well controlled. She was asked to hold this medication
at time of discharge due to hypokalemia, tachycardia. She may
continue the fluticasone.

# Hypertension: Not hypertensive on admission. As patient is
starting propanolol, asked her to stop her hydrochlorothiazide
but to continue Benicar. As well, the patient reports
hypokalemia, which is likely exacerbated in the setting of
hydrochlorothiazide.

# Hyperlipidemia: Hold resuvastatin for now

# Depression: Has been on buproprion for years with good results
but reports that her mood has been down over the last few weeks
since she has been feeling fatigued. Continue home Buproprion
HCl XL 300 mg daily

# Neuropathic pain: After her accident two years ago she has had
difficulty with neuropathic pain in her back and legs. Continue
home gabapentin and cymbalta. Has not been taking hydrocodone-
acetaminophen for the last few weeks.

# GERD: s/p nissen fundoplication. Continue home omeprazole
