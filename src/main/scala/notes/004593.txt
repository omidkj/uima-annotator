Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1136**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
51 y.o. Female with h.o.T1-T2 paraplegia [**3-5**] MVA, multiple
admissions for PNA, [**Month/Day (2) 40097**] UTI requiring intubation,
hypothyroidism originally admitted to the ED for ?PNA.
Transferred to the unit for hypotension versus septic shock.
.
Unfortunately pt is a poor historian. Pt was diagnosed with a
UTI and started on Augementin on [**2148-2-6**] which she completed a
10 day course. Per pt's PCA they were at Foxwood yesterday, pt
had no symptoms when she went to bed last night at 8pm. Her PCA
stayed with her last night when the pt had acute onset of SOB at
midnight. Her O2 sat which was noted to be 77%, she was placed
on 4l of oxygen and her saturation improved to 93%. Her PCA
called [**Company 191**] and was referred to the ED. Pt has home oxygen which
she uses only when she is discharged from the hospital with PNA.

.
She denies any cough, fever, nausea, vomiting, rhinorrhea,
abdominal pain, melena, hematemesis, expectorant. + chills.
.
In the ED initial vitals were noted to be T99.2, HR 86, BP
101/66, RR 18, Sat 97%. Initial labs were notablw for Plt 130,
WBC was 9.7, Neutrophillic predominance. Chem 10 panel was
unremarkable. A CTA was obtsined which showed no P. Embolism but
did show bibasilar consolidation which were thought to be
possible chronic atelectasis. Pt was originally on her way to
the medicine floor when she was hypotensive to with systolics in
the 80s asymptomatic. Pt was given 3-4 litres of fluid, lactate
was obtained and normal. BP prior to transfer was increased to
90/60.
.
Of note she was recently discharged on [**2148-1-3**] with a similar
presentation. She was noted to have similar symptoms with
hypotension, hypoxia and was intubated and placed on pressors.
She then developed PRES syndrome in the ICU.

STUDIES:
[**2148-2-24**] CXR Focal opacity at the right heart border in the right
lower lung may represent focal pneumonia (favored) or
atelectasis.

[**2148-2-24**] CTA Chest
1. No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology.
2. Improved bibasilar atelectasis and left lung ground-glass
opacities.
These chronic atelectatic findings may be secondary to chest
wall deformities and poor inspiratory efforts in the setting of
multiple chronic rib fractures.
3. Mucoid impaction in bilateral lower lobe bronchioles.

[**2148-2-27**] CXR
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2-24**]:
  Extensive opacification has developed in the perihilar regions
of both lungs, accompanied by a new small right pleural effusion
most consistent with pulmonary edema due to cardiac
decompensation. Tip of the left PIC line extends approximately a
centimeter beyond the wire, in the mid-to-upper SVC.  No
pneumothorax. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and venous access nurse were both
paged


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Hypotension: Pt originally admitted to the ICU given episode
of hypotension to the 80s. Given the patient's initial
presentation, she did not meet SIRS criteria given her WBC,
temp, RR, HR. Determined not to be septic shock.  On review of
her clinical notes her BP appears to be 95 in her prior Primary
Care visit, there is also a comment in a prior Neurology note of
possible dysautonomia from her thoracic lesion. Patient had
stable SBPs 80-90s with no evidence of end-organ ischemia,
mentating well, good urine output, during her hospitalization,
so was presumed to be at baseline and secondary to autonomic
dysfunction. Did not require IVF boluses and remained
hemodynamically stable.
.
2. Hypoxia: Pt noted to be hypoxic at home on room air that
corrected with 2L of oxygen. Given CXR LLL/retrocardiac
infiltrate lobar pneumonia was thought to be the cause of the
patient's hypoxia.  She was treated empirically for HAP with
levofloxacin and vancomycin.  Given sputum culture grew sparse
growth of staph aureus, the patient was continued on this
regimen, vancomycin for 7 days, levofloxacin for 10 days.
Ipratropium/Albuterol nebs treatments, chest PT, acapella and
incentive spirometer use improved the patient's symptoms.
.
3.  UTI: Pt also has history of frequent UTIs given that her
caregiver self-caths. She was started on Augmentin for [**Last Name (STitle) 40097**]
Klebsiella UTI diagnosed in Caritas. Her review of urine culture
data shows [**Last Name (STitle) 40097**] Klebsiella sensitive to Zosyn, Meropenem,
Bactrim, Unasyn. She also has a h.o. of Proteus sensitive to
Zosyn. Though [**Last Name (STitle) 40097**] Klebsiella appears to be sensitive to Zosyn
there may be a difference between in-[**Last Name (un) **] vs in-[**Last Name (un) 5153**]
sensitivity.  High rate of resistance with [**Last Name (un) 40097**] during Zosyn
therapy, thus was initially treated with Meropenem.  When the
culture data returned with pansensitive pseudomonas, Meropenem
was discontinued and levofloxacin was continued for total of 10
days.
.
4.  Thrombocytopenia: Pt on admission noted to have plt 130,
prior baseline has shown plt count in the 300s.  The patient's
platelet count dropped to 84 on her third hospital day.  Heparin
and omeprazole were discontinued as possible causes.  Her count
returned to 144 prior to discharge.  Omeprazole was held, and
the patient instructed to have a repeat platelet count as an
outpatient.
.
5. T1-T2 paraplegia s/p MVC: Pt was maintained on her home
regimen of Methadone, Lyrica, Baclofen, Lidocaine patch,
Klonopin, Trazadone.  Home oxycodone was discontinued given
hypotension and questionable mental status at times.  The
patient never requested oxycodone therapy.  She was asked to
refrain from restarting oxycodone as an outpatient if possible.

.
6.  h.o. PRES syndrome: Pt has history of PRES syndrome occured
in [**12/2147**] and thought to be due to a combination of pressors,
pt's underlying labile BP.  The patient's blood pressure
remained relatively stable during hospitalization, with
increases when the patient was anxious.
.
7. Hypothyroidism: Continued home regimen of levothyroxine.
