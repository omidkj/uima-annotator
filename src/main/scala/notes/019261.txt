perirectal abscess

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Operative drainage of perirectal abscess on [**1-6**]
Placement of PICC line

History of Present Illness:
74F h/o afib, COPD, HTN, PVD s/p R ax-bifem bypass
anticoagulated on coumadin, admitted [**1-4**] from NH with purulent
rectal drainage/pain.  Abd CT showed new peri-rectal abscess and
she was covered with levo/flagyl/gent and admitted to the
surgical service for further management. Blood cultures from

Imaging:
[**2174-1-13**]: Portable Chest - Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
stable on this portable examination performed with relatively
lordotic projection.  As noted previously, the right mediastinal
contour appearance is most likely due to tortuous vessels, which
may be accentuated by the lordotic projection.  The lungs appear
grossly clear, and there are no pleural effusions.
.
[**2174-1-12**]: Echo - The left atrium is normal in size. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function appears normal. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
The aortic valve is not well seen. There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly
UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.Compared with the
prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2173-10-11**], there is no definite
change.
.
[**1-4**] CT pelvis:
1.  3-cm fluid collection with peripheral enhancement containing
air and fluid in the left perirectal area, likely representing
perirectal abscess in this patient with purulent drainage from
rectum.  Air-containing tubular structure extending from the
abscess inferiorly,  may represent fistula to the skin; however,
the most inferior portion of the lesion is not included in the
present study.  Please correlate with physical examination.
2.  Status post axillary-bifem bypass surgery.  Decrease in size
of bilateral inguinal fluid collections, larger on the right,
probably representing seroma versus hematoma as described
previously.
3.  Small collection of air in the bladder, which may be related
to recent
catheter placement if there is an appropriate history; however,
please
correlate with the result of urinalysis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 75 year old female with history of PVD, PAF, s/p
axillary bifem bypass c/b bilateral seroma collection, admitted
to MICU with repeat episode of hypotension in the setting of E.
Coli bacteremia/UTI, peri-rectal abscess/enterococcal wound
infection.
.
#. Hypotension: The patient was initially admitted to the
general surgery services for drainage of her perirectal abscess,
which was initially delayed secondary to a supratherapeutic INR
requiring FFP for reversal. The patient had previously been
treated with 3-week course of levo/Flagyl and Vanco which may
have contributed to high INR. The patient underwent drainage on
[**2174-1-6**] and was extubated without event. The patient was being
treated with Gent/Levo/Flagyl (Day 4 treatment, day 1 post-op)
when she developed SBP of 67, but was asymptomatic. The decision
was made to transfer the patient to the MICU for
observation/treatment. It was thought the most likely etiology
for the patient's hypotension, with systolics to the 70s, was
secondary to infection/SIRS. Given the patient's positive blood
cultures and perirectal abscess, the most likely source is E.
coli bacteremia, which was ultimately found to be resistant to
quinolones. ID was consulted and given quinolone resistance, the
patient was placed on aztreonam/metronidazole/vancomycin with
improvement in vital signs and negative surveillence cultures.
ID made note to give attention towards the patient's graft as a
source for seeding, although after 3 months her graft should be
well endothelialiazed. Patient was a
