mastectomy and TRAM reconstruction.  The pathology of the
patient's breast cancer shows an infiltrating ductal
carcinoma, grade I out of III.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Zestril 10 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Multivitamin.
3.  Aspirin.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the first hospital day, the patient was
taken to the operating room where she underwent a right skin
sparing mastectomy with axillary dissection performed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 364**], followed by bilateral oophorectomy as performed by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5166**], and finally a free TRAM right breast
reconstruction by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and the plastic surgery team.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no
intraoperative complications.

Postoperatively, the patient was taken to the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring of the free flap.
The patient's pain was initially managed with an epidural.  A
Foley catheter was placed.  The patient was given Kefzol and
deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.

On postoperative day number one, the patient had no problems
and was begun on a p.o. diet, however, on postoperative day
number two, the patient began showing signs of confusion and
inappropriate behavior.  She appeared shaky and agitated.
The symptoms were attributed to the patient's history of
alcohol use and in consultation with the psychiatry team, the
patient was begun on CIWA Valium protocol.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] workup
was performed which revealed no other etiologies.  The
patient's symptoms resolved over the next day and the patient
required no further intervention.

On postoperative day number three, the patient was stabilized
to the point that she was ready for transfer to the floor.
She began taking adequate p.o. and her intravenous fluids
were discontinued.  With adequate p.o. intake, the patient's
epidural was removed by the acute pain service and Foley
catheter was removed as well.  Throughout this time, the
patient's flap continued to have a strong dopplerable signal
and had no concerning signs for failure.

On postoperative day number six, the [**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**]

removed.  At this time, the patient was ambulating well,
tolerating regular diet and had adequate pain control.  The
