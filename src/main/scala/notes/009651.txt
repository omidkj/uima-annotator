.
Blood culture x 2 No Growth.
.
Urine Culture- No Growth.
.
Right Upper Extremity Ultrasound- no evidence for DVT.
.
Echocardiogram [**2181-7-19**]-
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is
0-5mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Left ventricular systolic
function is
hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%). There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. A bioprosthetic aortic valve
prosthesis is present. The aortic prosthesis appears well
seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular
gradients. A bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present.
The mitral prosthesis appears well seated, with normal
leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2180-9-22**], the findings are similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 32940**] is a very kind 78 year old Russian speaking woman
with history of RUE lymphedema, recurrent cellulitis, who was
admitted with RUE cellulitis developed hypotension in the
setting of probable SIRS, responsive to IV fluids, never
required pressor agents, cultures were negative, no evidence to
DVT. She was discharged to complete a full 14 day course of
clindamycin. Detailed description of events are listed by
problem as below.

1) hypotension-
Likely SIRs in the setting of source cellulitis. Patient
clinically improved once transferred to the floor. Responsive to
IVF blolus, never on pressors, cultures negative. Low suspicion
for alternative etiologies (incl cardiac) given source and rapid
resolution. An interval echocardiogram was obtained to assess
for cardiac and valvular function, which did not reveal
significant interval change.

2) cellulitis-
Started on vancomycin and clindamycin, then changed to
clindamycin PO alone once culture negative. with continued
improvement demarcation, now dramatically improved. She was
discharged on Clindamycin PO to complete 14 day course. She has
propensity towards vaginal yeast infection on antibiotics and
was given nystatin PO for prophylaxis. She was also given a
prescription for new right arm compression stockings to prevent
lymphedema.

3) Hyperlipidemia -
She was continued on atorvastatin.
.
5. Hypothyroid -
She was continued on levothryoxine.
.
6. Post herpetic neuralgia -
Continued pregabalin.
