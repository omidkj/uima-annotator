Pertinent Results:
[**2122-12-8**] Echo: Pre-CPB: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in
the left atrial appendage. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed (LVEF=20 - 25 %). There is global
hypokinesis with poor anterior and lateral wall motion. There
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Post-CPB: The patient is
in SR on no infusions. Improved biventricular systolic fxn. EF
now 40 - 45%. Trace MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. Aorta intact.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 32978**] was a same day admit after undergoing pre-operative
work-up as an outpatient. On [**12-8**] he was brought to the
operating room where he underwent a coronary artery bypass x 4.
Please see operative report for surgical details. Following
surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring
in stable condition. Within 24 hours he was weaned from
sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. He had
trigeminy which he also had pre-operatively. He was briefly
treated with IV lidociane. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2357**] from electrophysiology
was consulted and lidocaine was discontinued. A repeat echo was
recommended in 3 months with evaluation for AICD. Chest tubes
and pacing wires were removed per protocol. CXR [**2122-12-10**] showed
improved but persistant right lower lobe atelectasis. He was
staretd on lopressor, lasix, and statin therapy. Low dose
amiodarone was also started for ventricular ectopy. He was
evaluated by physical therapy for strength and conditioning and
was cleared for discharge to home on POD#4 by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
