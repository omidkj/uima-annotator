History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 81 y/o gentleman with CHF (EF 45%), porcine AV
replacement, severe MR/TR, AFib, pacemaker, diverticulosis s/p
bleed [**2171**], who was transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital to [**Hospital1 18**]
yesterday ([**4-13**]) due to melena.

Initially, there had been plans for MVR/TVR in 3/[**2172**]. The pt
was admitted to [**Hospital **] Hospital from [**Date range (1) 94558**] w/ refractory
peripheral edema [**2-13**] chronic right sided heart failure and was
diuresed; he was also developed pneumococcal
pneumonia/bacteremia so was treated with two weeks of CTX which
he completed in rehab. While at rehab, warfarin was restarted
for Afib (this had been discontinued in [**5-/2171**] [**2-13**] a large
diverticular bleed) and 3 days later he had dark/tarry stools in
the setting of INR of 3.4 and hct of 27.5 (from 30 on [**2172-3-26**]). He was sent to [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**4-9**] where he was
found to have hct of 28.3 which dropped to 25.8 on repeat. INR
was 2.31. He was given at least 2 units of FFP and 10 mg vitamin
K which brought his INR down to 1.9. Per wife, pt received 1
unit pRBCs. He underwent EGD which showed only a small amount of
blood in the stomach and signs of congestive gastropathy with
multiple hemorrhagic changes. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**4-13**]
because his cardiac care has been here. On the cardiac surgery
service, GI was consulted given his recent GI bleed and plan
were made for colonscopy on [**4-15**]. He was also seen by vascular
surgery for his b/l LE ulcers. Per Cardiac Surgery, he is not a
candidate for surgery at this time due to GI bleed and various
other issues (see below) so a transfer to Medicine was
requested.

STUDIES:
[**2172-4-21**] TTE: Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There is moderate
to severe reduction of the left ventricular ejection fraction at
least partially due to ventricular interaction (LVEF = 30 %).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] The
right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right
ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global free
wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral valve
leaflets do not fully coapt. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of tricuspid regurgitation may
be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is at least moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at
least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to
a very high right atrial pressure.] The main pulmonary artery is
dilated. The branch pulmonary arteries are dilated. There is no
pericardial effusion.

[**2172-4-14**] CXR: The left pectoral pacemaker lead terminates in the
region of the base of the right ventricle. There is severe
cardiomegaly with surrounding atelectasis. There is
opacification in the right lower lobe with air bronchograms that
likely represents pneumonia. There is no pulmonary vascular
congestion or pneumothorax. There are probably small pleural
effusions. IMPRESSION: Right lower lobe pneumonia.

[**2172-4-14**] TTE: The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right
atrium is markedly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is at
least 15 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There is mild to
moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45 %). No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
markedly dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. There
is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of severe (4+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with
elevated left atrial pressure. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2172-4-15**] EGD: Mottled erythema (giraffe skin pattern) and atrophy
in the antrum compatible with atrophic gastritis (biopsy)
Fundic gland polyps Ot
