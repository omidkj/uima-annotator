made her dyspnea worse. In the last few weeks she completed two
courses of Levaquin and Prednisone for COPD exacerbation. She
did have cough productive of yellow sputum and increased
shortness of breath. She completed last course of prednisone
taper last Firday, 4 days prior to this admission. Prior to her

to be more lethargic and somnolent at home. The patient was seen
in the ED complaining of subacute progressive episodes of

7.36/77/63. HCO3 39. Head CT was done and was negative for
intracranial hemorrhage but did show suprasellar mass. She then
was discharged home. Over the weekend, she reports that she did
not feel well.  On [**11-5**], the day of admission, she saw her
pulmonologist, and an ABG showed 7.29/96/101.  Following these
