Chief Complaint:
Increased swelling and SOB worse x 1 week

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
62 yo M with minimal PMH who p/w 2-3w of increasing DOE with
increased b/l LE swelling. States symptom began last [**Month (only) 956**]
when he was unable to exercise as he previously did. He would
become increasing SOB and fatigued. He continued to decrease his
daily activities with progressive decline. He again attempted to
join a gym in [**Month (only) 205**], but had poor exercise tolerance. He also
noted weight gain of +25lb around that time period and thought
the gym was not helpful. In the last couple weeks, he's noted
even more marked decline. It has now worsened to point where he
couldn't walk to mailbox. Also with difficulty sleeping at
night, could not lie flat and had sensation of something
'dripping' down his throat. When he complained that he could not
retrieve the mail, he was prompted by friends and [**Name2 (NI) 80306**] to
seek medical advice. Regarding his minimal PMH, patient has been
without health insurance for 2 years after losing his job. He
previously had annual check ups. During these, he was told his
had HTN that was controlled by exercise and an enlarged
prostate. He had been referred to Urology at least twice, but
failed to follow-up. He did have some labs checked in [**Month (only) 205**] that
revealed and elevated Cr, he believes ?25 as the value. At which
point he was also referred to Urology but was unable to do so.

The day of admission, he originally presented to [**Hospital1 **], K 7.9, BUN 148, Cr 17.7, Trop 0.05, and Hct 20.
Initial BP 200/100. He was given Calcium Cl, insulin 10 Sq, D50,
Lasix 20mg, Kayexelate 60mg, Albuterol and started on
nitroglycerin for BP. He was also transfused 1U PRBC, with
increase HCT from 20 --> 22.3 Upon arrival VS 99, 177/80, 22,
95/4L. EKG with tall, peak-T wave with wide QRS but not
sinusoidal. Renal was consulted. He was given an additional 10U
insulin, 1 amp D50, Lasix 60mg IV x 1 (-1100ml in Foley), and
Morphine 4mg IV x 1 for a leg cramp. Upon arrival to the MICU,
he confirmed the history as relayed above.

Upon ROS he denies BRBPR, hematuria or dysuria, but does confirm
q1H urination for about 1 year. Also +DOE and orthopnea with
platypnea, he denies any CP. Also with increased LE edema,
cramping in R calf. No F/C, No N/V/D/C. No wt loss. No loss of
appetite.

Imaging:
ECG ([**9-22**]): Sinus tachycardia. Left bundle-branch block.
Probable left atrial abnormality.

CXR ([**9-22**]):  The heart is enlarged. There are bibasal effusions
present. There is mild prominence of the pulmonary vasculature.
The appearances are
suggestive of mild CHF.

GU U/S ([**9-23**]): Bladder with diffusely thickened and irregular
wall. This is associated with symmetric bilateral moderate
hydronephrosis.

TTE ([**9-24**]): Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
regional dysfunction c/w CAD vs. conduction system disease/BBB.
Mild mitral regurgitation. LVEF 35-40%.

Upper ext Duplex U/S ([**9-24**]): Patent bilateral subclavian veins
and bilateral brachial arteries. Patent right basilic and left
cephalic vein with diameters as noted. The upper arm cephalic
vein on the right is thrombosed and the forearm basilic on the
left is thrombosed. More proximally vein diameters in the left
basilic are identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) Acute Renal Failure: Patient was transferred from OSH with
acute renal failure and found to have an enlarged prostate
(homogeneous, smooth, no nodules) with FENa and FE urea c/w
postrenal ARF. His baseline kidney function is unknown, although
his creatinine was 1.2 in [**2195**] and 5.3 in [**4-/2198**] as well as PSA
of ~12 6/[**2197**]. He was first told his prostate is enlarged at
least 5 years ago, but did not follow up. On foley insertion, he
had relief of obstruction with significant post-obstructive
diruesis. He was started on tolterodine (later deemed unncessary
and stopped) and tamsulosin. Nephrology was consulted and he was
treated with kayexalate for hyperkalemia in the ICU given peaked
T waves on ECG and widened QRS. This was discontinued as his
potassium normalized to 4.9 and the peaked T waves resolved, so
he was transferred out of the ICU. Renal U/S showed bilateral
hydronephrosis and an enlarged thickened bladder. U/A and urine
culture were negative. He was started on calcium acetate and
aluminum hydroxide for hyperphosphatemia. Urology was consulted
and recommended keeping the foley for 2 months, at which time he
could be further evaluated, such as prostate biopsy or
cystoscopy. He continued to have post-obstructive diuresis, up
to net negative 5L / 24hrs, as well as gradual improvement in
creatinine. He was initially kept on maintenance 1/2 NS to
prevent dehydration, and when tried off IV fluids, developed
orthostatic hypotension with presyncope. This resolved with 1L
NS bolus. A voiding trial was attempted and his foley was
pulled, but it had to be replaced with immediate output of 1.2L.
He was advised to take in fluids and salt a
