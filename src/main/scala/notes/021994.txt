History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 27218**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with hx of recent cdiff
[**1-26**], hip fracture [**11-23**], admission for massive GIB [**12-26**] who was
referred to the ED by VNA with fever, increased diarrhea, mild
dyspnea, and hypotension. The patient was recently discharged
from rehab and was seen by a visiting nurse today who found her
congested and unable to bring up her seretions. She had a temp
of 100.7 at home and BP of 100/50. VNA was unable to get a pulse
ox [**Location (un) 1131**]. She has been having diarrhea for 3 days. She was
told to go to the ED for evaluation. She admits to weakness,
abdominal pain. Denies SOB. Has been off antibiotics for some
time.
.
In the ED, initial VS: HR 82 BP 67/40 RR 24 Sat 98% on RA%. She
was given 2.5L NS and her SBP increased to the 100s. She had
many stools which smelled concerning for Cdiff. Guaiac negative.
Bilat lower quadrant tenderness. Labs were significant for
lactate of 3.2 (on recheck after fluids of 2.4), WBC of 22.0.
Repeat VS at 1800: 99.4, 104/46, 83, 24, 99%RA. She underwent a
CTA and CT abd/pelvis which was consistent with colitis, but
showed no megacolon. She was given 1000 mg of tylenol, 750 mg of
levofloxacin (for ? PNA with hypoxia initially prior to CXR
which was clear), and 500 mg of flagyl.
.
Vitals in ED prior to transfer-  T99.4 P80 BP92/60 RR30 O2 sat
100% on 2L NC.  2 18 guage PIVs. Foly put out 250 in last 6 hrs.
Got 2.7 L NS in ED. Put out 2 gallons of stool in ED.
.
On arrival to the ICU, pt states she is doing ok. She appears
confused and slow to answer questions. When pts' nephew and
sister were [**Name (NI) 653**], they stated the pt is usually quite sharp
and completely oriented. Now, pt does not know year or anyone's
phone numbers. She states he diarrhea started today and that she
no longer has any belly pain. Pt also states she has had a cough
recently

Social History:
The patient lives in a two family house in [**Location (un) 2251**], MA. She was
never married and currently lives in the lower half of the house
with her sister-in-law (another octogenerian). She formerly
worked as a greeting card maker in a factory and retired over 20
years ago. She is still quite independent and can do her own

quitting entirely when she was in her 40's. She drinks wine very
rarely on holidays and denies any history of other drugs.
.
She eats a healthy diet that she prepares at home and tries to
limit her sodium and fluid intake. She tries to exercise by
walking daily, but her walking is limited by leg pain.


Family History:
Mother has h/o of loss of consciousness from "heart problems"
that eventually caused her death. Father died of cirrhosis
(non-alcoholic).

Physical Exam:
VS: T=, BP=110/70, HR=90, RR=15, O2 sat=100%RA
GENERAL: Elderly white female in no apparent distress.  Able to
answer questions.  Seems mildly confused, able to say full name,
knows its [**Month (only) 547**] but thinks its [**2115**], knows that she is at [**Hospital 61**] Hospital.  Coughing intermittently during our
conversation.
HEENT: NCAT. Sclera anicteric. PERRL, EOMI. Mucous membranes are
moist
NECK: Supple with JVP of 10cm
CARDIAC: Irregular rhythm, rate controlled, no murmurs.
LUNGS: Diffuse bilateral wheezes and late inspiratory crackles.
ABDOMEN: Non distended, soft, mild tenderness to deep palpation
in the peri-umbilical region.
EXTREMITIES: No c/c/e.

Pertinent Results:
CT torso with contrast:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
2. Moderate pancolitis and proctitis. Clinical correlation is
recommended.  This can be secondary to pseudomembranous colitis
or other infectious/inflammatory etiology. Ischemic etiology is
less likely due to
distribution.
3. L1 severe compression fracture with 5mm of retropulsion is
new since [**2123-12-24**].

Brief Hospital Course:
#. C. difficile colitis: Patient presented with profuse diarrhea
up to 2 gallons every couple of hours (per ED report) and was
found to be hypotensive with a lactate of 3.2 and Cr of 1.3 from
a baseline of <1.0. She was initially admitted to the MICU where
she was given IVF resuscitation, started on IV metronidazole and
PO vancomycin (125 mg q6h) and  flexiseal was placed as patient
was producing a very large amount of diarrhea (>2 L daily). CT
abd/pel showed toxic megacolon with colon measuring >6 cm and C
diff testing subsequently was found to be positive. Her
hypotension and ARF resolved with IVF and she was subsequently
transferred to the medical floor. On the medical floor she
continued to have profuse diarrhea and her PO vancomycin was
subsequently increased to 500 mg q6h. Her flexiseal was removed
early in her course but her abdomen became distended very
rapidly and this was re-introduced. At this point a GI consult
was obtained and they recommended adding PR vancomycin at the
same PO dose and consulting ID. An ID consult was obtained and
given her condition metronidazole was changed to tigecycline.
Serial abdominal X-rays were obtained with her colon measuring
9.5 cm and despite all of our efforts her diarrhea persisted.
Given the severity of her disease and her DNR/DNI status a
conversation was held with the patient about colectomy which was
the only viable option for cure at the time. She declined
surgery and subsequently a family meeting was held and her
family decided to respect her wishes of not having surgery and
having a trial of maximal medical therapy. At this meeting,
given her poor prognosis, it was decided to remove her flexiseal
as this was very painful to the patient. After this was done she
continued to have diarrhea but its amount reduced throughout the
hospitalization. A palliative care consult was obtained and the
patient and family decided to return home with a hospice
program.  IV tigecycline was stopped on the day of discharge;
oral vancomycin should be tapered to a decreased dose, but
continued for life.

#. Electrolyte abnormalities: Patient??????s course was complicated
by persistent electrolyte abnormalitis, including potassium,
magnesium, calcium and bicarbonate loss due to the large amount
of diarrhea that she was producing daily and her NPO status.
These were repleted both via IV and PO routes.

#. Delirium:  Patient was found to be delirious at times during
her hospitalization but she remained mostly AOX2-3. This was
attributed to the severity of her disease and her long hospital
course.

#. UTI: Patient was found to have +UA on 2 different occasions
during her hospitalization. The initial one was treated with 3
days of PO cipro. This was later thought not to have been
appropriate and a second UA was found to be positive as well.
This was treated with 3 days of IV cipro and this was
discontinued as a recommendation of the ID team. She had a foley
catheter throughout her hospitalization, which was removed prior
to discharge.

#. ARF: Patient presented with a Cr of 1.3 from a baseline of
0.7. This was thought to represent pre-renal azotemia due to
severe dehydration as it resolved after IVF resuscitation.

#. Code: Patient was DNR/DNI.
