Pt's remaining family in in [**State 531**]

Brief Hospital Course:
Preliminary work-up of the patient's illness revealed a
supratherapeutic PT [**Name (NI) 263**] of 6.8), and an initial Hct of 29.6.
She was admitted to the SICU for presumed GI bleed and was
administered 4 units of FFP, pantoprazole therapy and aggressive
intravenous fluid resuscutation.  Hct level 14 hours after the
original was 19.4, a precipitous drop of 10 points. Within 10
hours of this laboratory value, the patient received 6 units of
FFP and 4 units of PBRCs, with resulting INR and Hct of 1.9 and
29.8, respectively.

After reversal of supratherapeutic PT, the patient's GI bleed
stopped. The patient was kept in the SICU until Hcts were stable
for 48 hours. Discussion was undertaken with gastroenterologist,
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. It was decided that no intervention was needed as
the patient's bleed had resolved.

The patient's vital signs remained stable throughout her
hospital course. Though she apparently had a brisk GI bleed, her
vital signs never reflected hypovolemic shock.

The patient was transferred from the SICU to the surgical floor
on HD#5. At this time, she was on a stage 5 bariatric diet,
ambulating, having regular bowel movements and was free of
nausea. The surgical team felt she was stable enough to be sent
home with visiting nurses services, a very conservative return
to warfarin use, and biweekly PT monitoring. As preparations
were underway for discharge, the patient began to complain of
shortness of breath, chest congestion and URI symptoms. Her V/S
revealed a temperature of 101.7F and oxygen saturation of 95% on
room air. The patient had diffuse expiratory wheezes on physical
exam. The patient's discharge planning was put on hold. A fever
work-up was initiated, and nebulizer treatments were ordered.
However, despite being counseled on the need for adequate
evaluation and treatment of her condition, the patient left the
hospital without being officially discharged.

At the time of discharge, the patient was in possession of
prescriptions and discharge instructions, as these had been
given to the patient prior to her febrile episode.

Of note, the patient's chest x-ray was negative for pneumonia;
sputum sample was inadequate for analysis.  Blood cultures were
negative at the time of this writing. The patient did not submit
a sample of urine for analysis and culture.
