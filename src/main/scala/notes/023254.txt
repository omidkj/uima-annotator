Chief Complaint:
Recurrent AML

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
A 28-year-old gentleman with a history of AML status post
recurrence after a third allogeneic transplant from an unrelated
donor.  The patient most recently received decitabine followed
by DLI on [**2136-6-12**], decitabine on day 13 and DLI which was on
[**7-10**]. He subsequently received donor lymphocyte infusion on
[**7-23**]. He subsequently had bone marrow biopsy which revealed
persistent involvement of patient's known acute leukemia. He's
therefore admitted for further chemotherapy. On presentation
tonight he continues to feel well without complaints except for
some mild dyspnea on exertion. Denies fever, chill or rigor. No
easy bruising or bleeding.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 28 year old male with AML s/p 3rd allo SCT (2 sibling
donors, 1 MUD) ~6 months ago who was admitted after a bone
marrow biopsy was indicative for recurrent AML in order to
receive chemotherapy.
.
# AML: He received 5 days of chemotherapy on a regimen that
included cytarabine, mitoxantrone, and Mylotarg which he
tolerated well except for some rigors with Mylotarg which
responded to demerol and some fevers after cytarabine infusions.
 Otherwise, he had mild nausea and headaches that responded to
lorazepam and oxycodone.  He had fevers which were believed to
be due to the cytarabine since the fevers only occurred
following the chemo and cultures were negative.  He received
tumor lysis and DIC labs frequently during chemo, none of which
were positive.  He was prophylaxed with D5w-bicarb and
allopurinol. Bone marrow biopsy was done of [**8-17**]. The patient
received a stem cell boost on [**8-28**].  This caused him to have
fevers and rigors, but this resolved by the next day.  His cell
counts began to rise after 6 days, and he no longer required
transfusions of red cells or platelets.
.
# Febrile neutropenia/ID: He was put on cefepime prophylaxis
while neutropenic and vancomycin was added when he spiked
through cefepime.  He was also maintained on acyclovir,
ursodiol, and voriconazole prophylaxis. The patient became
febrile up to 103 on [**8-3**] and have continued. The patient had
VRE bacteremia and the patient was started on linezolid and
vancomycin was d/c'ed. The fevers persisted and due to rising
LFT voriconazole was switched to micafungin and cefepime was
changed to meropenem as fevers continued. As LFT's normalized
the pt continued to have fevers, tachycardia and developed sharp
[**Month/Year (2) 5283**] abdominal pain and mica was changed to vori again, and an
extensive work up including [**Month/Year (2) 5283**] US, CT A/P, MRI of liver, HIDA
scan, surface ECHO, CTA of chest, CT non-con of chest was
pursued to evaluate the cause of the pt's persistent
hyperdynamic state and severe pleuritic pain. Pulm was consulted
on [**8-14**] and pt underwent a bronch on [**8-15**] that he seemed to
tolerated well. On the evening of [**8-15**], pt developped acute
respiratory distress with hypoxia and tachycardia. He was placed
on a NRB with improvement in sats to 100% but a large A-a
gradient with ABG 7.44/45/79, lactate of 1.0. Pt was tachycardic
to 170s and tachypneic. The patient was discharged from
voriconazole and started on ambisome and posaconazole for
increased aspergillus as well as atypical fungal coverage. The
patient continued to spike fevers, however, clinically appeared
much better. His pain also decreased significantly.  He was
transferred back from the ICU on [**8-17**].  He continued to spike
fevers while on the floor and was cultured repeatedly, but was
never positive except for the single VRE positive blood culture.
.
On [**8-26**], the patient was switched to daptomycin in preparation
for his stem cell boost on [**8-28**], however, this caused a rise in
the patients LFTs and bilirubin.  It was stopped on [**9-8**].  The
patient remained clin
