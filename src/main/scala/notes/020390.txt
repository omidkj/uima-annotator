===========================
DISCHARGE LABS:

===========================
EKG ([**6-8**]): Sinus rhythm with modest A-V conduction delay.
Leftward axis. Delayed R wave progression with late precordial
QRS transition. Findings are non-specific. Since the previous
tracing of [**2168-6-6**] the rate is slower. Otherwise, no significant
change.

CXR ([**6-9**]):

Brief Hospital Course:
62F with h/o MS, sarcoid, HTN, hyperlipidemia, DMII, CAD s/p
stents, PAD s/p L BKA, h/o CVA and recurrent DVTs who was
recently admitted at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 100782**] for dyspnea and was
treated for exacerbation of reactive airway disease in setting
of recent URI, now presented back to ED for shortness of breath
and wheezing, likely from exactly the same etiology:
exacerbation of reactive airway disease/asthma/COPD.
.
# Dyspnea: The patient has known reactive airways
disease/Asthma/COPD and this appears to be an exacerbation of
the same process during her prior hospitalization. She does not
appear fluid overloaded, BNP 41, no evidence of PNA on CXR, and
she refused CTA to rule out PE but has been on warfarin.
Pulmonary was consulted. They recommended CT chest, which showed
evidence of bronchitis. PFTs were performed, but report not
available at time of discharge. ECHO showed normal EF with no
valvular abnormalities. Patient reports she has no nebulizers at
home, which is surprising since she has been discharged home
with nebulizers every time when she was discharged recently. We
set up a nebulizer for her this time. She was continued with
Albuterol & Ipratropium nebs. She was started on prednisone 60mg
PO x5 days, followed by prednisone taper. She was discharged
home with albuterol nebulizer and prednisone taper.
.
# Recent UTI: Patient had continued evidence of infection on UA
with chronic indwelling foley. She had known Pan-sensitive
Proteus. Of note, she did not fill her Bactrim for UTI
prescription on discharge. She was continued on Bactrim DS PO
BID x3 more days during this hospital stay.
.
# Diabetes Mellitus/Hypoglycemia/Altered mental status: On the
morning of [**6-14**] the pt was found to be altered on the floor.
Fingerstick was performed and in the 40s, the pt was given D50
and mental status improved significantly.  Fingersticks were in
the low 80s-90s overnight in the ICU, morning NPH was held.  The
afternoon upon callout, the pts glucose was up to 380s and SSI
was given. Patient's insulin dose was decreased afterwards, and
she had no more episodes of hypoglycemia.
.
# Chest pain/hypotension: After pts episode of hypoglycemia, she
began to complain of substernal chest pain, similar in character
to her ongoing angina.  She was given SL NTG, after which she
became hypotensive and remained that way for 3-4 hours on the
floor.  Refractory to 2-3L of IV NSS.  The patient was
transferred to the MICU at that point for her ongoing
hemodynamic instability.  With an
