Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1845**]
Chief Complaint:
Asymtomatic Hypotension and Tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 84 y/o F with CAD s/p BMS, sCHF w/EF 30%,
PAFib, DM2, PAD, HTN, HL, h/o DVT/PE with recent admission for
CHF exacerbation coming with asymptomatic hypotension and
tachycardia. She was in her prior state of health until ~3 days
ago where she was diagnosed with a UTI and prescribed
ciprofloxacin. She decided to take only 1 dose. Then, during the
last day she has noticed increase fatigue. She denies any
nausea, vomitting, chills, fever, diarrhea, changes in her
medications. Her son took her BP and found her 70/50 and HR
100-150's, so held her metoprolol. He called Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who
recommended for the patient to be evaluated in the ER. Family
called EMS who found her sats in the mid 80s on room air and
hypotensive up to 80/40 with an ECG showeing AFib with RVR at
140s. Pt received diltiazem by EMS (unknown dose).

In the [**Hospital1 1388**] ER her initial VS were T 99.2 F, HR 119 BPM, BP
96/63 mmHg, RR 19 X', SpO2 ? and no pain. She was good apearing,
no crackles, wheezes or ronchi, but with a pressure ulcer in her
heel. Her initial ECG showed AFib with RVR at 140s and her labs
showed WBC 11.2, HCT 31.7 at her baseline, PLTs of 258, normal
coags, Trop-T: 0.12, CK: 42  MB: Notdone, Na:129, K:4.7, Cl:101,
TCO2:17, Glu:63, Lactate:1.8, BUN 46, creatinine 1.2 and a
negative UA. There was concern for MI, because the ER physicians
did not think that the renal function was elevated enough to
explain the elevation in the Trop T so she was started on a
heparin gtt. She was noted to have ECG ischemic changes. CXR was
concerning for LLL PNA, so pt received Vanc 1g/Levofloxacin
750(radiology read it as normal). PE-CT did not show infection
or clots. Blood pressure was fluctuating in the mid 80s and
responded to fluid, patient receiving aproximately 3 L NS. Pt
received her metoprolol 12.5 dose (home dose) and her AFib was
rate controlled. Pt received tylenol as well.

The lungs are clear without consolidation or edema. There is
mild aortic tortuosity with calcified plaque seen at the arch.
The cardiac silhouette is borderline enlarged but stable. No
effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The visualized osseous
structures are diffusely osteopenic with no displaced fractures
evident.
IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process.

CXR ([**6-19**]):

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is 84-year-old woman with CAD s/p BMS, sCHF w/ EF 30%, PAFib,
DM2, PAD, HTN, HL, h/o DVT/PE with recent admission for CHF
exacerbation coming with asymptomatic hypotension and
tachycardia.

# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, question of sick sinus
syndrome - Patient with diarrhea at home and poor oral intake
after being discharged at rehab. She was feeling very tired and
with poor appetite. She probably became orthostatic and
hypotensive that caused someone to hold her metoprolol.
