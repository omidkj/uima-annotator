Service: EMERGENCY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2565**]
Chief Complaint:
increased secretions

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
trach change

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 78y/o F with T3N0 supraglottic SCCA currently
undergoing chemo/XRT, and s/p tracheotomy on [**2132-6-6**], who
presents from [**Hospital1 **] w/ increased and thickened secretions
with resultant difficulty breathing. She notes progressive
increased and thicker secretions over the past 2 weeks, worse
yesterday and today. She has difficulty breathing when the trach
gets plugged with thick secretions, and this is relieved w/
multiple suctioning passes.  She reports her last trach change
was at [**Hospital1 **], approximately 4 weeks ago. She has been
tolerating chemo XRT reasonably well, and reports she has only 5
remaining XRT sessions and 1 remaining treatment of chemotherapy
with reduced dose Taxol and Carboplatin. She has had some
reddness over the anterior neck x several weeks and throat pain
since starting XRT. Denies fever, chest pain, N/V, abd pain.
She takes nothing by mouth, and receives all nutrition per G
tube. At [**Hospital1 **] she had an episode of stridor and was given
solumedrol 125mg x2 and albuterol/atrovent nebs, however she
continued to have SOB. Given concern for edema/airway
obstruction she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation.
.
In the ED VS were T 97.7  HR 62  BP 117/46 RR 18  97%4L. She was
evaluated by ENT in ED.  Fiberoptic exam showed erythema but no
airway edema.  ENT recommended stopping Passe-Muir valve,
humidified TC, saline nebs qid, tracheostomy tube change, and
speech and swallow evaluation.  Currently the patient reports
that she feels tired and is complaining of a sore throat.  She
denies chest pain, SOB, N/V, abdominal pain. She reports that
her secretions have improved.

Past Medical History:
laryngeal SCCa s/p trach [**2132-6-6**], s/p G tube, currently
undergoing chemo/XRT
Afib w/ RVR
h/o aspiration PNA
HTN
COPD
Dyslipidemia

Social History:
She has a 50-pack-year smoking history but quit smoking seven
years ago.  Currently living at [**Hospital **] rehab since her trach
placement.


Family History:
non-contributory

Physical Exam:
VS: T 97.7  BP 120/43  HR  55  RR 14  99%35% TM
General: Pleasant, well-appearing woman, no acute distress
HEENT: MMM, EOMI, PERRL
Neck: trach, erythema surrounding trach site
Heart: Bradycardic, regular, no m/r/g
Lungs: CTAB
Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, +BS, no masses
Ext: 1+ edema, warm, well-perfused
Neuro: AAOx3

Pertinent Results:
CHEST, PA AND LATERAL: A tracheostomy tube appears in
appropriate position. A rounded opacity at the left
cardiophrenic angle which causes opacity posteriorly on the
lateral film is consistent with fat herniating the diaphragm as
seen on previous chest CT. No focal pulmonary opacities to
indicate pneumonia are seen. There is flattening of the
diaphragm and pruning of the pulmonary vasculature in the apices
consistent with known emphysematous changes. There is biapical
scarring. There is a convex right thoracolumbar scoliosis.

IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary disease.
.
ENT- Fiberoptic exam via nose: NP - no mass, posterior
pharyngeal wall
- no edema, valleculae w/ some pooled secretions, epiglottis
slightly thickened (c/w XRT) with diffuse erythema, left TVF -
not mobile, moderate thickened and erythematous mucosa over bil
arytenoids, pooled thick yellow secretions in post cricoid space
and piriforms
.
Fiberoptic exam via trach: trach in good position, tracheal
rings
visible with normal mucosa
.
ECG: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Left
anterior fascicular
block. Compared to the prior tracing of [**2132-6-12**] atrial
fibrillation has
appeared.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessmen/Plan: 78y/o F with T3N0 supraglottic SCCA currently
undergoing chemo/XRT, and s/p tracheotomy on [**2132-6-6**], who
presents from [**Hospital1 **] w/ increased and thickened secretions
with resultant difficulty breathing.
.
# SOB/increased secretions: airway evaluated by ENT in ED and
showed no evidence of edema.  Increased secretions likely
secondary to radiation-induced scarring of upper airway and/or
use of passe-muir valve and lack of humidified air through
trach.  However we could not rule out infection as source of
increased secretions.  Levo/Flagyl started at [**Hospital1 **] switched
to Zosyn, as well as improved trach care with humidified O2,
q1-2hr suctioning, and trach change with inner cannula allowing
frequent cleaning.  All these interventions led to significant
improvement in respiratory status.
  She should continue Zosyn for 4 additional days for a total 7
day course.  She should continue trach care as above with
constant humidified O2, frequent suctioning and cleaning of
inner canula, and spiriva nebulizers.  She should not use a
Passe-Muir valve as this inhibits clearing of secretions.  For
the next 4-5 days she should keep the trach cuff continously
inflated.  After this time, she may deflate it intermittently to
speak.  She should then have speech and swallow evaluation for
aspiration risk.  When previously seen by speech and swallow at
[**Hospital1 18**] at last admission, she was deemed to be an aspiration
risk, but this may have improved after radiation and
chemotherapy.  Until that evaluation, she should not take PO
food.
  Follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of ENT has been arranged.
  Sputum gram stain showed 3+ gram positive rods, cultures are
still pending at this time.  The gram positive rods are not
considered to be pathogenic at this time.
.
# Laryngeal CA: Patient is currently undergoing chemo/XRT.
Received 3 doses of XRT while inpatient.  She should continue
chemo and XRT as per her primary oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
# Anemia: Stable low hematocrit.  No evidence of active bleeding
.
# Neutropenia:
White count low on admission at 0.9 with ANC of 780, this
increased to 1480 on HD2.  This made interpretation of white
count difficult in determining presence of infection.
.
# A fib: Admitted in NSR.  Went into what was initially called
atrial fibrillation during chest PT and converted to sinus
spontaneously.  EKG done near that time showed P waves of
several morphologies, raising the possibility of MAT although
the patient was not tachycardic.  Review of prior ECGs does not
clearly show atrial fibrillation.  This diagnosis was made in
[**2132-6-1**], during a prior ICU stay and again reverted to sinus
spontaneously.  She was rate-controlled but not anti-coagulated
at that time.  She should see a cardiologist as an outpatient to
consider Holter monitor/further diagnosis of atrial fibrillation
vs. MAT, as well as consider anticoagulation for paroxysmal
afib.

#Hypertension: BP well-controlled with ace-inhibitor and
beta-blocker
.
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued statin
.
# COPD: No acute issues, continued
