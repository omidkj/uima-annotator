Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 81-year-old
man with a history of hypertension and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease who presented [**Hospital6 14576**] on
[**2143-8-14**] with complaints of cough, shortness of
breath, and wheezing for three to four days.  He was
initially hypercapnic with an arterial blood gas of
7.28/66/241 and reportedly improved with BiPAP, but was
intubated for increasing dyspnea with an arterial blood gas
of 7.41/44/79 just prior to intubation.  After intubation,
his arterial blood gas was 7.46/45/61 on 100% FIO2.  During
this evaluation for increasing dyspnea, an electrocardiogram
was obtained.  This 7:15 a.m. electrocardiogram on
[**8-14**] showed T wave inversions in I, aVL, V3 through
V6, and his troponin went from 0.6 to 12.7.  His creatine
kinases at that time peaked at 566 with a MB of 28.6 and
began to trend down to 434 with a MB of 17.8.

He was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 188**] for cardiac catheterization for presumed acute
coronary syndrome in the setting of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease flare with acute bronchitis.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  A 25-pack-year history of tobacco,
discontinued in [**2105**].  No ethanol use.  He is a retired
tailor.  He is married with children.  He lives with his wife
and is fairly active.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  On admission on the
Coronary Care Unit, his examination was as follows:  Vital
signs were temperature of 99.4, blood pressure 129/69,
pulse 60 to 70.  His vent was assist-control, tidal volume of
550 with 16 respirations per minute, FIO2 of 50%.  In
general, he was alert, responsive, intubated.  His neck
showed no jugular venous distention.  His lungs had wheezes
anteriorly but good air movement.  His heart had distant
heart sounds, regular in rate and rhythm.  His abdomen was
soft, nontender, and nondistended.  His extremity examination
was significant for dorsalis pedis of 2+ bilaterally,
posterior tibialis 1+ bilaterally.  There was no evidence of
hematoma in the groin, no bruit, no tenderness.  He had
arterial and venous sheaths in the right groin.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Outside laboratory
studies were as follows:  White blood cell count 9.1,
hematocrit 32.1, platelets 171.  Sodium 140, potassium 3,
chloride 108, bicarbonate 27, BUN 27, creatinine 1.1,
glucose 147.  Calcium 8.6, magnesium 2.4.  Total cholesterol
of 170, LDL 102, HDL 59.  Troponin went from 0.6 to 12.7.
Creatine kinases from 566 with MB of 28.6 to 434 with a MB
of 17.8.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram showed sinus rate
[**Company 36597**] wave inversions in V2, V6, II, aVF, and aVL.

His chest x-ray showed prominent hilar, but no evidence of
infiltrate or failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Upon admission to the [**Hospital1 190**] the patient went immediately to cardiac
catheterization.  At that time his cardiac output was 4.3, a
cardiac index of 2.47, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure
of 7, pulmonary artery pressure of 22/16, left ventricular
end-diastolic pressure of 11, right atrium of 10, right
ventricle of 23/10, AO of 122/75.  His ejection fraction was
calculated at 40% with anterior apical dyskinesis.  His
coronaries showed the left anterior descending artery had
mild haziness in the mid portion but no focal stenosis.  His
left circumflex and right coronary arteries had no disease.

The patient was extubated on [**8-16**] without
complications and started on a steroid taper for his chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease flare.  He was continued on his
10-day course of levofloxacin started at [**Hospital6 36598**] for presumed community-acquired bronchitis.  He
responded well to these therapies with a respiratory
examination significant for good air movement and only
occasional wheezes by the time of discharge.

After catheterization, the patient was given post
catheterization heparin for approximately 48 hours to treat
for presumed unstable angina in the setting of no occlusion
noted on catheterization.  He tolerated the institution of
beta blocker well and was discharged on p.o. atenolol without
evidence of bronchospasm.

DISCHARGE STATUS:   The patient was discharged to home.
