EKG
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Delayed R
wave
progression in the anterior precordial leads. Diffuse
non-specific ST-T wave changes in the inferior and anterolateral
leads. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2112-3-24**] the rhythm is
now atrial fibrillation with a rapid response.
.
CHEST XRAY
IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes with no signs of CHF or pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR ADMISSION
.
31 y.o Male with pmhx of chronic systolic heart failure with
dilated cardiomyopathy related to alcohol abuse, atrial
fibrilliation, presented with alcohol intoxication, atrial
fibrilliation with RVR and agressive behavoir.
.
#Alcohol intoxication- the patient is protecting his airway
currently with no evidence of aspiration on CXR. Recieved [**4-11**]
Liters of fluid intravenous, and one to one for passive SI and
agressive behavoir which resolved in the ICU.  He was
transferred to the floor on HD1. He was placed on a CIWA scale
but did not require any diazepam. The patient was seen by social
workers and psychiatry (see below). As above the patient had
been sober 1 year prior to this event. Patient reported he
motivated to obtain sobriety once again after this recent
relapse. He was provided information regarding resource
information including information about addiction services at
[**Hospital 778**] clinic. Behavior remained appropriate, HR improved and
the patient was discharged on HD 2.
.
# Suicidal ideation- [**Last Name (un) **] intoxicated the patient made
statements concerning for self harm such as suicidal statements,
such as "my number one goal is to harm
myself" while intoxicated. When sober the patient denied any
sucidical or homicidal ideation. He was evaluated by psychiatry
who did not feel he was a danger to himself or others.  Per
psychiatry recommendations his Celexa was titrated upward to 30
mg.  Psychiatry also recommended replacing home seroquel with
trazodone. This was tried however, the trazodone was not
effective for the patients insomnia and he was restarted on his
home seroquel.
.
#Atrial Fibrillation- Patient initially had heart rates of
100-120 her restarted home carvedilol which was up titrated to
25mg [**Hospital1 **].  He also required Lopressor IV 5mg twice while in the
MICU.  On the floor heart rates improved and his was discharged
on the increased dose of carvedilol. The patient was continued
on [**Hospital1 **]. While in house he was given 5 mg daily. On
discharge he was restarted on 6 mg MTWTHF and 7 mg on Sat Sun.
INR on discharge was 1.6. INR monitoring will be transitioned to
[**Hospital 778**] clinic. The patient was initially started on [**Hospital **] as
an outpatient in preparation for cardioversion. He will
follow-up with his cardiologist to determine the need to
continue this medication.  Patient was also continued on his
home aspirin.
.
#Systolic Heart Failure- Likely due to dilated cardiomyopathy
related to alcohol abuse. Last EF in [**2114**] improved at 40 %. He
was continued on his home Lisinopril and Digoxin. Digoxin level
was low at 0.2 likely related to poor medication compliance
during his recent alcohol binge. As above he will follow-up with
his outpatient cardiologist.
.
# Transaminitis- AST and ALT were mildly elevated on admission
67, 72 respectively.  This was felt to likely reflect effect of
alcohol.  Transaminases trended downward throughout the
admission. Hepatitis panel was positive only for HepB surface
antigen suggesting previous immunization.  Hepatitis C antibody
was negative.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
- As above INR monitoring will be done at [**Hospital 778**] clinic
- Patient will follow-up with his PCP and cardiologist
- Patient was full code throughout this admission
