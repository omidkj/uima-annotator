Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Vancomycin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2763**]
Chief Complaint:
renal failure s/p CRT

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
HD line placement

History of Present Illness:
61M with history of ESRD s/p CRT [**2101**], hypertension, diabetes,
diastolic CHF, admitted on [**2107-11-12**] with acute on chronic
dyspnea, now s/p PEA arrest. He presented on [**11-12**] with 2 days of
worsening dyspnea, cough, and fever/chills.  Also with
orthopnea, PND, and worsening edema in all 4 extremities.
.
Labs showed ARF with creatinine of 5.8 (up from 2.9).  During
hospital course on the floor, renal function continued to worsen
and urine output was low even with furosemide (unclear etiology
of ARF).  Also noted to have intermittent somnolence but
arousable and fully oriented.  ABGs repeatedly with partially
compensated respiratory acidosis (has also had this in the
recent past), team unsure how reliable ABGs were given bilateral
UE fistulas.
.
Patient was in angio having hemodialysis line placed when his
arrest event occurred.  He was placed in a lateral decubitus
position due to difficulty lying flat due to shortness of
breath.  Towards the end of his line placement, he became more
agitated and was pushing his facemask away.  O2 sats were unable
to be obtained.  He was then placed in supine position for line
suturing.  He was then noted to be nonresponsive, code blue
call.  Then noted to be pulseless.  CPR initiated and initial
rhythm asystole/very slow PEA, subsequently faster PEA.  Total
pulseless time 13 minutes.  Received total 2 mg epinephrine, 2
amps bicarb, 1 mg atropine, insulin/D50, IVFs via new HD line.
Regained pulses with first SBP >180.  Intubated.
.
In the MICU, patient seemed to be waking up some but with also
evidence of extensor posturing in upper and lower extremities.
Neuro consulted.  Aline and CVL placed.
.
Review of systems: unable to obtain

Physical Exam:
Vitals: T: BP: P: R: 18 O2:
General: Intubated; initially not sedated.  Not opening eyes but
moving all extremities to pain and initally spontaneously.
?myoclonic and posturing as below.
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, pupils equal at 2 mm though minimal
reactive.  ETT in place.
Neck: HD line in place.  Obese neck, difficult to appreciate JVD
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales,
ronchi
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, loud systolic
murmur best at RUSB and LUSB.
Abdomen:  soft, distended, appears non-tender, bowel sounds
present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly.

[**2-8**]+ bilateral LE edema, also +bilateral UE edema, ?right
slightly greater than left
Neuro: Moving some spontaneously and responsive to pain in the
UEs, not much pain response in the LEs.  Seems to be
intermittently with extensor posturing (lasts 2-3 seconds at a
time), sometimes associated with ?myoclonic movements of ankles.
 + significant bilateral ankle clonus.

.
CXR [**2107-11-14**]: In comparison with the study of [**11-12**], there are
lower lung volumes. Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
persists with mild vascular congestion suggested.
.
EKG: NSR at 94, NANI, low limb lead voltage, poor RWP (old); no
significant change from prior.
.
TTE [**2107-11-14**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a very
small circumferenital pericardial effusion.
.
Renal ultrasound [**11-13**]:  No new findings.
.
CT Chest [**11-15**]:  On CT, there is no evidence of air embolism.
Cardiomegaly, mild axillary and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Bilateral pleural effusions with areas of subsequent
atelectasis, patchy lower lobe predominant parenchymal opacity
is potentially suggestive of a combination of pneumonia and
atelectasis. No pathologic air collection in the mediastinum and
the lung interstitium.
.
CT Head [**11-15**]:  1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute
vascular territorial infarction. There is no hydrocephalus.
2. Opacification of sphenoid sinus, maxillary, ethmoid air cells
and
nasopharynx, most likely related to recent intubation.
.
CT Head [**11-17**]:  1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or obvious
major territorial acute infarct, mass effect, or hydrocephalus.
If there is continued concern, MR of the head with
diffusion-weighted imaging sequence is more sensitive in the
detection of acute stroke.
2. Diffuse opacification of the sphenoid sinus, nasopharynx, the
maxillary
and the ethmoid air cells partly related to mucosal thickening,
secretions
from intubation. However, patient also had a left antrochoanal
polyp in the past, which is incompletely assessed on the present
study.
3. Discontinuous foci in the left parietal bone may relate to
thinning of the bone, from arachnoid granulations or other
etiology, to correlate with any history of surgery. However,
this appearance is unchanged compared to the prior CT sinus
study done on [**2102-10-19**].
.
RUE US [**11-20**]:  Although subclavian vein not evaluated, remainder
of right upper extremity venous system appears normal with no
evidence of DVT, and DVT would be likely in the subclavian vein
given respiratory variation and normal appearance of remainder
of the study.
.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] [**11-21**]:  1. Severely limited examination demonstrates
changes of chronic microvascular white matter ischemic disease
with old left frontal encephalomalacia without evidence for
acute infarct.
2. Extensive paranasal sinus and mastoid air cell disease.
.
KUB [**11-25**]:  1. Severely limited examination demonstrates changes
of chronic microvascular white matter ischemic disease with old
left frontal encephalomalacia without evidence for acute
infarct.
2. Extensive paranasal sinus and mastoid air cell disease.
.
KUB [**11-26**]:   There is no evidence of free air. NG tube tip is in
the stomach. Right femoral catheter remains in place. There is
no evidence of bowel obstruction. There is nonspecific bowel gas
pattern.
.
Portable Abdomen XR [**11-29**]:  There is no evidence of ileus, small
or large bowel obstruction.
.
Abdominal US [**12-6**]:  Normal right upper quadrant ultrasound with
no findings to suggest the cause of the patient's pain.
.
CT Abd/Pelvis [**12-6**]:  1. Small thrombus within the IVC and at the
junction of the right common iliac vein and transplanted renal
vein.
2. Diffuse mesenteric stranding with no small or
