Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1406**]
Chief Complaint:
recurring dyspnea following community aquired pneumonia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2120-11-1**] Coronary artery bypass grafting x2: Left
internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending
artery, and reverse saphenous vein graft to the first
diagonal artery.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 76 yo male with chronic renal failure who
presented to MWMC with recurrent dyspnea following treatment for
community acquired pneumonia. On admission, he ruled in for
NSTEMI and chest x-ray revealed pulmonary edema. He was also
started on hemodialysis for volume control. Since initiation of
dialysis and completion of antibiotic therapy, his dyspnea has
significantly improved. Recent cardiac catheterization revealed
severe single vessel coronary artery disease with depressed LV
function. He was therefore transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for surgical
revascularization.

Findings
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. Bidirectional shunt
across the interatrial septum at rest. Small secundum ASD.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction. Mildly
depressed LVEF. [Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed
given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). Mild
AS (area 1.2-1.9cm2). No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. Mild (1+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient. Left pleural effusion.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:
     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
Prebypass
There is a bidirectional shunt across the interatrial septum at
rest. A small secundum atrial septal defect is present. There is
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesia of the apex, apical and mid portions of the anterior
septum. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed (LVEF= 45 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area
1.2-1.9cm2). The [**Location (un) 109**] by planimetry is 2.2 cm2and by continuity
equation it is 1.2 cm2. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
was notified in person of the results on [**2120-11-1**] at 0915am.
