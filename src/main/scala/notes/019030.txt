Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3918**]
Chief Complaint:
Palpitations/tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
76 yo M with history of AML, MDS, and prostate cancer who
presents to [**Hospital1 18**] ED with palpitations after he had been sent
home from [**Hospital1 3242**] outpatient clinic after assessment for dyspnea and
fevers. According to patient's wife, the patient had been
cleared to go home from [**Hospital1 3242**] outpatient clinic after a CXR was
unrevealing, though the patient was only home for a coupld of
hours prior to feeling acutely unwell and EMS was called. EMS
noted HR of 190 and pushed diltiazem with little change in HR.
.
At presentation to the ED, patient was noted to have HR of 150
and EKG consistent with atrial flutter and was started on an
amiodarone bolus and infusion. Patient was given morphine for
dyspnea per home regimen. Vitals prior to transfer to the MICU
were: T 100.8, HR 134, BP 98/56, RR 36, O2Sat 97% 3L NC.
.
Upon arrival to the floor the patient's wife and daughter
indicated that patient would want to be DNR/DNI and would be
discerning about performing any invasive procedures. Within 30
minutes of arriving to the MICU, patient spontaneously converted
to sinus rhythm and HR dropped from 150s to 80s.

STUDIES:
.
CXR [**2137-3-29**]:
In comparison to study performed earlier the same day, lung
volumes are
decreased. This may account for increased bibasilar opacitites,
though new
consolidation should also be considered. Right apical opacity is
likely
unchanged, though is now partially obscured by overlying soft
tissue artifact. Left peripherally inserted central catheter
reaches the mid SVC. Hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are
unchanged. There is no large effusion or pneumothorax. There is
no free air in the upper abdomen.

IMPRESSION: Persistent right apical opacity with apparent new
bibasilar
opacities, which may in part reflect atelectasis in conjunction
with low lung volumes. Repeat PA and lateral radiographs with
better inspiration would be helpful for further evaluation.
.
CXR [**2137-3-31**]:
Heart size remains normal. Pulmonary vascularity is also within
normal limits. Lung volumes are increased compared to the recent
radiograph, and recently described new bibasilar opacities have
nearly resolved with only minimal linear atelectasis remaining.
Poorly defined right apical opacity has slightly decreased in
size since prior studies and is likely due to slowly resolving
infection based on appearance on [**2137-3-2**] chest CT. Small
pleural effusions are present bilaterally.

IMPRESSION:

1. Near resolution of bibasilar opacities which were likely due
to
atelectasis.

2. Right apical opacity, likely due to slowly resolving
infection. Continued radiographic followup of this region may be
helpful to document complete resolution.


Brief Hospital Course:
#. Atrial fibrillation with RVR:
Patient presented to ED primarily because of new palpitations at
home which was proven to be atrial fibrillation with RVR as well
as one documented episode of atrial flutter. Patient converted
to sinus rhythm soon after admission to MICU overnight. The
patient was switched to oral amiodarone after having converted
to sinus. He tolerated the PO well and was called out to the
floor and was transfered to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] under the care of
the oncology/[**Hospital Ward Name 3242**] service.  Pt was not not discharged on amio
given that he converted prior to receiving his 1st dose and we
thought the benefits did not outweight the drawbacks given his
baseline pulmonary disease and overall decreased life
expectancy.
.
#. Anemia:
Pt has long term anemia with frequent outpatient transfusions
related to MDS. The patient was ordered for HCT daily with
transfusion threshold of HCT < 21. The patient had a stable
hematocrit and did not re
