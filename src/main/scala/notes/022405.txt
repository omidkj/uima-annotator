Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

Internal Jugular Central line placement bilaterally


History of Present Illness:
52 y.o. male with morbid obesity, type II diabetes, obstructive
sleep apnea and CHF who contact[**Name (NI) **] his PCP this morning to say
that he was not feeling well.  At that time he mentioned feeling
increasingly short of breath for approximately 3 days with
generalized malaise.  It is unclear whether he was requiring
increased oxygen.  At baseline he uses 2-5 L NC and is
prescribed CPAP but is non-compliant.  His PCP called an
ambulance to transport him to the ED. Of note the patient was
recently admitted to the MICU on [**2129-11-12**] when he presented with
hypoxia (80% on RA) and required BIPAP.  At that time it was
thought that his hypoxia was secondary to his obesity related
lung disease.  He was extremely aggitated secondary to his
hypercarbia and signed himself out of the ICU AMA after only a
few hours.
.
In the ED his vitals were temp 99.4, HR 88, BP 138/88, RR 36
with an O2 sat of 88% on RA.  He was noted to be extremely
aggitated and had difficulty responding to questions.  He denied
chest pain, fevers, chills, cough, sputum production or
increasing oxygen requirement.  He reported pain in abdomen but
was unable to describe the pain further and points to a site
beneath his panus.  He denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, BRBPR.
 He denied any dysuria or increased urinary frequency. He did
report increasing "shakiness" which worsened with his worsening
respiratory status.  In the ED he received one dose of ativan
0.5 mg and was placed on BIPAP with an FiO2 of 0.5, pressure
support of 15 and a PEEP of 5.
.
On arrival to the ICU patient was increasingly aggiated and his
O2 sats were in the low 90s on BIPAP with 100% FiO2.  Shortly on
arrival the patient desatted to the low 80s requiring emergent
intubation.  ABG taken shortly prior to intubation was pH 7.07,
PCO2 141, O2 122.
