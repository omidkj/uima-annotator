Preliminary Report
HISTORY:  Aortic valve repair.

TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Comparison is made with [**2127-6-15**].
Median
sternotomy wires and aortic valve prosthesis are present.  The
multiple tubes
and lines have been removed. There are small bilateral pleural
effusions,
cardiomegaly, and vascular congestion.  There are aortic
calcifications.  No
focal consolidations or pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION:  Mild CHF.




Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted and underwent elective aortic valve
replacement with a #19 [**Company 1543**] tissue valve on [**2127-6-13**].  She
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CSRU on
propofol.  Cross clamp time was 64 minutes and total bypass time
was 93 minutes.  She had a stable post op night and was
extubated.  Her chest tubes were d/c'd on POD#2 and epicardial
pacing wires were d/c'd on POD#3.  She did have Wenkebach and
Mobitz 2 heart block postop, and had it preop as well.  She was
stable with this rhythm and was evaluated by EPS who felt she
did not need to be anticoagulated or studied.
She was transferred to the floor on POD#3 and did well despite
some intermittent confusion.  She responded to low dose haldol
and the delerium resolved. She continued to progress and was
discharged to rehab in stable condition on POD#6.
