Brief Hospital Course:
He was found to have a  new pulmonary embolism in a segmental
branch of the right pulmonary artery extending into the
subsegmental branches. The previously seen left pulmonary
embolism had since resolved. A small right-sided pleural
effusion was noted.  He was transferred to the SICU for
management. Cardiac enzymes were negative. DVT of the left
common and external iliac veins was stable. Infrarenal IVC
filter was in place. Bilateral non-invasive studies of arms and
legs were negative for DVT. IV heparin was initiated then
coumadin was started. He received 5mg on [**12-14**] and 10. INR
was 2.4 on [**12-18**] for which coumadin was increased to 7mg daily.
IV heparin was discontinued and lovenox 120mg [**Hospital1 **] was started.
He was to receive this for 3 days.

A MRCP was done to evaluate for leak given fevers. A fluid
collection was noted near the biliary enteric anastomosis
slightly increased in size compared to [**2143-12-9**]. There was no
evidence of active bile leak. Biliary enteric anastomosis was
patent.  Atelectasis of both lung bases was noted. He was
continued on vancomycin/levaquin and flagyl until [**12-16**] when
these were stopped and cipro was started for cholangitis
prophylaxis. No source of fevers was detected and it was
presumed that fevers were possibly due to the PE. Blood and
urine cultures were negative to date.  He stabilized and was off
O2 with sats of 98 on room air. He denied chest pain and sob. He
was ambulatory and [**Male First Name (un) **] stockings were applied.

[**Male First Name (un) 18303**] INR was set at 2.5-3.5 given existing filter. His PCP's
office (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]was contact[**Name (NI) **] and arrangements were made
with the nurse [**Doctor First Name **] to monitor the INRs. Labs were to be
drawn at [**Hospital 5279**] Hospital in [**Location (un) 5450**] N.H. starting [**12-19**].
