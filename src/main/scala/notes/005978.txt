Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath and recurrent pericardial effusion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bilateral Thoracentesis at OSH
R thoracentesis at [**Hospital1 18**]


History of Present Illness:
63 yo F h/o HTN, PAF underwent PVI on [**7-21**] with pericardial
effusion and pericardial drain post-procedure for cardiac
tamponade, admitted from OSH for recurrent pericardial effusion.
She reports that she was feeling fine after her discharge [**7-24**].
She started having dry cough and central rib pain on Wed [**7-29**].
for pain. On sunday she reports worsening in her symptoms and
SOB, DOE, air hunger, fever/chills and sweats. She took herself
to the ED and was admitted to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital on [**8-2**].
.
She was in afib without RVR on admission. Her OSH course
included initiation of Ceftriaxone and Levofloxacin for
pneumonia (consolidation b/l lower lung on chest xray). She was
also found to have b/l pleural effusions and underwent b/l
thoracentesis (8/16 L sided, [**8-5**] R sided) which was positive
for RBCs [**Numeric Identifier 18085**], WBC 144, 62 LO, 29 Mac, tot prot 3.8, pleural
alb 2.4, LDH 232, gucose 113, amylase 15. Her c/o of abd pain
and amylase 240, lipase 121 prompted a CT abd which showed
cystic liver, pleural effusions and negative for pancreatitis.
Pericardial effusion was detected on CT chest on [**8-2**] and was
followed with TTE on [**8-3**] . There was a suspicion for worsening
pericardial effusion on TTE today (slight RA invagination, ?RV
invagination) at OSH. She was given 1.5L IVF bolus and 1uFFP
prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
Medications held since [**8-5**]: coumadin, amiodarone, diltiazem and
metoprolol.
Blood cultures on [**8-5**] show gram positive cocci in clusters,
w/o speciation or susceptibilities.
Lab prior to transfer [**8-6**]: Na= 132, Hct=31, Dig=1.1, trop=0.02,
CPK=37, Cr=0.8, INR=2.0

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 20296**] is a 63yo female recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for
pericardial effusion s/p drain after attempted PVI and
subsequent hypotensive episode. She was restarted on digoxin and
amiodarone at discharge. She represented to OSH w complaints of
dry cough, chest discomfort, subjective fever/chills, and found
to be in afib w/o rvr, pericardial effusion, and b/l pleural
effusions s/p thoracentesis. She was transferred here for
management of pericardial effusion with suspicion for tamponade
physiology. Currently hemodynamically stable.
.
# Pericardial effusion: Discharged [**7-24**] for treatment of
pericardial effusion s/p drain placement. Pt stable at time of
discharge with resolution of symptoms. Represented to OSH 1 wk
later for SOB, cough and fever. Symptomatology of cough, chest
pain, and fever likely [**1-20**] inflammatory reaction to prior
effusion on [**7-21**] with development of pericarditis. Transferred
from OSH for management of potential pericardial tamponade on
ECHO. Repeat in house ECHO at bedside on admission and again on
[**2189-8-7**] showed small to moderate effusion w/o tamponade
physiology. No pulsus on exam. Chest CT [**2189-8-9**] showed small
pericardial effusion. Patient never showed signs of tamponade
physiology or hemodynamic compromise. Started on colchicine and
indomethacin. Will be discharged on both with follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] for reevaluation and adjustment of medications.
.
#Pleural effusions: Underwent b/l thoracentesis at OSH both
showing large RBC component. Thoracentesis on [**2189-8-9**] removed 1
liter of serousangionous fluid from the left side, thoracentesis
on [**2189-8-10**] on the right side and removed 800cc. Pleural flui
