Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Cefepime / Cipro

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
54-year-old gentleman with a history of AML. He is day 508
post-transplant complicated by chronic graft-versus-host disease

manifesting as skin, liver involvement and edema. Pt was most
recently admitted for right leg cellulitis; discharged [**11-4**]
with chronic levofloxacin that per records finished on [**11-19**].
Today the patient describes waking up this AM with chills and
malaise. He reports not being able to get warm; the wife called
the onc fellow on call took his temp-- 99.6. As the day
progressed, his temperature increase and he came to the ER.
.
In addition to the fever, the patient has been having
siginificant fatigue and increased cough with sputum. This
afternoon he also developed severe headache (as is typical with
his acute illness), feeling very weak, acute onset of shortness
of breath and pleuritic chest pain. Of note, his lower
extremities have been more swollen recently, but he has recently
noticed that his L>R has been swollen since yesterday, but
previously the right was more swollen than the left.
.
On presentation to the ER, initial vitals were T 101, HR 104, RR
18 02 95% RA. While in the ED, he became more hypoxic and
required a NRB to keep sats above 93%. He also became
hypotensive to BPs of 80s/50s. His BP was fluid responsive and
the patient received a total of 3L. Additionally, he was seen by
onc who recommended Vancomycin, Zosyn. He also received
azithromycin. CTA was done for pleuritic CP that showed a
subsegmental PE, thus he was started on heparin gtt and given
dilaudid for pain.
.
On arrival to the floor, the patient is feeling well, but feels
fatigued. As well he has a persistent bifrontal headache with
photophobia.
.
ROS: + photophobia, + bilateral chest pressure (chronic)
hyperesthesia. + sick contacts (daughter who lives with him has
had fever and sore throat) Denies dizziness or lightheadedness,
syncope or presyncope. He has had no dysuria, constipation,
melena, hematochezia, diarrhea. He has no blurry vision, neck
stiffness.

IMAGING:
UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE ABDOMEN: No free air is seen under the
diaphragms.
Relative gasless abdomen is present with no air-fluid levels
identified.
Stool and air is seen within the descending colon and sigmoid
colon. No soft tissue calcifications are identified.
IMPRESSION: No air-fluid levels or free intra-abdominal air
identified.
Relative paucity of gas within the abdomen.

UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: The right PICC has been removed.
Cervical
fusion hardware is present. Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
contours are
unchanged and within normal limits. The lungs are clear. There
is no
pulmonary vascular congestion. No pleural effusions or
pneumothorax. Osseous structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
.
[**2144-11-21**] CTA:
1. Left lower lobe segmental pulmonary embolism.
2. Wedge-shaped peripheral consolidation in the superior segment
of the right lower lobe. Differential considerations include
infectious or inflammatory processes; atelectasis is less
likely.
3. Thoracic vertebral compression fracture, unchanged in
comparison to
[**2144-9-10**].

.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2144-11-23**] at 10:26:48 AM
The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. Left ventricular systolic function
is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is no left ventricular outflow
obstruction at rest or with Valsalva. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2144-6-8**], LV
function appears hyperdynamic on the current study. The other
findings are similar.

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS Study Date of [**2144-11-23**] 5:05 PM
IMPRESSION: No DVT in the bilateral lower extremities.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2144-11-25**] 5:10 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Worsening right lower lobe opacity over the period of last
five days most likely representing a worsening infectious
process.
2. Given the presence of pulmonary embolism in left lower lobe
the worsening left lower lobe opacity might represent infarction
as well as atelectasis or infection, determination based on the
chest radiograph cannot be made.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2144-11-27**] 4:53 AM
Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2144-11-26**].
