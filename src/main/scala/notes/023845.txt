Ace Inhibitors

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
rigors, chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right internal jugular central line placed

History of Present Illness:
This is an 83 year-old man with CAD, left ventricular
dysfunction with EF, atrial fibrillation on amiodorone, complete
heart block s/p pacer, history of GI bleeding who presents with
rigors and chest pain to [**Hospital1 18**] ER.  Patient returned from
outpatient visit for AAA, was watching television [**4-14**] afternoon
and had acute onset of rigors followed by chest pain.  Chest
pain was different from chest pain with MI in past-sharp,
non-exertional.  Recounts story of trauma to chest while sitting
in chair recently over same area.  No other pulmonary, gi,
genitourinary complaints.  No history of lines etc. (Did have
dye study for AAA on [**4-10**]). Pacer interrogated a few days ago
and was ok.
.
In Emergency room, hypotensive, started on levophed and
dopamine, given 6 liters of normal saline.  Mentating well
throughout, at baseline.  Labs initially with ? of neutropenia
but thought to be spurious as no apparent cause of neutropenia
and repeat CBC's with luekocytosis, left shift, bandemia.  Found
to have GNR in blood.  Source unclear as chest x-ray, ct chest
abd pelvis, urine and RUQ u/S unrevealing and no localizing
symptoms other than chest pain.
.
No EKG changes, positive trop in setting of renal failure,
negative CK's and MB's.


Past Medical History:
1. CAD: IMI thrombolyzed in [**2163**]. He underwent a cardiac
catheterization on [**2170-5-16**] that showed normal
hemodynamics.  His left ventricular pressureswere 138/8,
pulmonary artery 21/6 and a pulmonary capillary wedgepressure of
9.  His ejection fraction was 35% with evidence ofapical and
inferior akinesis.  Coronary angiogram revealedmoderate
nonobstructive coronary artery disease.  There was a 60%medial
LAD lesion, 60% second diagonal lesion and a 70% proximal
RCA lesion, which was pressure-wired and shown to be
nonsignificant.
2. CHF: left ventricular dysfunction, last cath as above, most
recent echo: [**9-21**] ef 35%, The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and  cavity size are normal
with moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis.  Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic
root is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but  not stenotic. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears  structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral  valve prolapse. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be  determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable
for review) of  [**2170-4-12**], global left ventricular systolic
function is improved (though LV  fractional shortenting was
previously low normal) and left ventricular cavity
size is now top normal.
3. Atrial fibrillation on amiodorone
4. Complete heart block in [**2163**] s/p pacer
5. GI bleeding in [**2170**]--requiring multiple blood
transfusions-had EGD, [**Last Name (un) **], capsule, no clear source
identified--did have multiple diverticuli and grade 1 internal
hemorroid but no active bleeding at time of scopes.
6. Anemia
7. Osteoarthritis
8. Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm
9. Spinal Compression Fractures

Pertinent Results:
[**4-14**] CXR:
Portable erect AP radiograph of the chest is reviewed, and
compared with the previous study of 8:54 p.m.
The right subclavian IV catheter terminates at cavoatrial
junction.  Pacemaker leads remain in place.  No pneumothorax is
identified.  There is continued mild cardiomegaly and tortuosity
of the thoracic aorta.  Again note is made of a 7-mm calcified
granuloma in the right lower lobe.  The lungs are clear
otherwise.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
..
..
FINDINGS:
CHEST: The evaluation of aorta and thoracic and abdominal organs
are somewhat limited due to lack of intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
Note is made of aneurysmal dilatation of ascending aorta,
measuring 4.5 cm in diameter.  Thoracic aorta is tortuous and
calcified.  Note is made of coronary artery calcification. There
is no evidence of pericardial effusion.  There is small
bilateral pleural effusion with atelectasis.  Note is made of
centrilobular emphysema.
There is 7-mm calcified granuloma in the right lower lobe.

ABDOMEN:  There is a ill-defined focal liver lesion in segment
6, which cannot be further characterized. Note is made of small
gallstones, possible small pericholecystic fluid, however,
gallbladder is not distended.  Note is made of
numerous calcified granulomas in the spleen. Bilateral kidneys
are atrophic. No mass lesion is seen in pancreas and adrenal
glands, on this non- contrast CT study, which is limited. Note
is made of large abdominal aortic aneurysm with calcification,
measuring 4.2 cm in diameter, in infrarenal level.
There is no dilatation of large and small intestines.  No
significant
lymphadenopathy.

PELVIS:  Note is made of sigmoid diverticulosis.  The visualized
portion of small bowel is within normal limits.  No ascites.  No
significant lymphadenopathy.  Note is made of marked
degenerative changes of thoracolumbar spine, with multiple wedge
compression fractures involving T12, L2 and L4.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Limited study due to lack of intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
2.  4.2-cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with wall
calcification.
3.  Aneurysmal dilatation of ascending aorta, measuring 4.2 cm.
4.  Small gallstones, with possible pericholecystic fluid,
without evidence of
gallbladder dilatation.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
5.  Sigmoid diverticulosis.
6.  Coronary artery calcification.
7.  Compression fractures of the thoracolumbar spine as
described above.
8.  Ill-defined liver lesion in segment 6, which cannot be
further
characterized. Further evaluation by ultrasound is recommended.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] has
been informed.

..
RUQ U/S:
Several stones are noted in the nondistended gallbladder.  The
gallbladder wall is thickened and irregular consistent with
adenomyomatosis.  The common duct is not dilated.  Limited views
of the liver reveal no focal or textural abnormalities.

IMPRESSION:  Cholelithiasis and adenomyomatosis.  No evidence of

cholecystitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 83 year-old man with history of CAD, AAA, GI
bleed who presented with rigors and L sided chest pain (which
responded to SL NTG x 1 in the ambulance) and was found to have
GNR sepsis as well as hypotension with SBP 70s in the ER, where
he remained for over 24 hours and was treated with sepsis
protocol. He was initially started on pressors and insulin drip,
which were weaned off while still in the ER.  He was bolused
with 6L of fluids there.  He was started on ceftriaxone and
levofloxacin.  The pt was eventually transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. On
arrival there he was normotensive and afebrile.  He was
continued on antibiotics.  He had no obvious source for
bacteremia.  He denied any symptoms and had a nonfocal physical
examination, as well as nonfocal imaging.  The working diagnosis
