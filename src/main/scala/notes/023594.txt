Attending:[**Location (un) 1279**]
Chief Complaint:
unstable angina

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Cardiac Cath [**9-5**]


History of Present Illness:
86 y/o male with h/o hypertension, hyperlipidemia, former
tobacco, FH of early coronary artery disease, pacemaker, CABG
[**2143**] with all grafts known totally occluded, CABG redo [**2151**]
(LIMA -> LAD, SVG -> OM, SVG -> rPDA), multiple PTCA's, who
presented to [**Location (un) **] on the 11th with crushing chest pain,
nausea. He subsequent ruled out there, but had recurrent chest
pain during the night and IV nitro was started. He was
transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath given his unstable angina.

On cath here he had a cypher stent to OM1. The left circumflex
was intervened on next, but the ballon would not deflate leading
to dissection of the LCX. Proximal ballon inflation was used to
tamponade area x 40min. There was no HD instability. Stat
echocardiogram demonstrated no evidence of effusion or
tamponade. He remained in the CCU overnight for HD monitoring.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service the following morning for
continued monitoring.

[**9-5**] Cardiac Cath-
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
severe native coronary artery disease. The LMCA had mild
calcification without angiographically apparent, flow-limiting
coronary disease. The LAD had moderate diffuse disease most
severe in the midvessel. The LCx had a distal OM with a 70%
lesion as well as a bridge distal to the disease. The AV groove
LCx had a proximal 99% lesion. The RCA was dominant but not
selectively engaged as shown multiple times to be totally
occluded proximally.
2. Graft angiography demonstrated a LIMA-LAD without
flow-limiting disease. The SVG-OM1 had a proximal 30% lesion
with catheter damping while engaged. The SVG-rPDA had no
flow-limiting disease.
3. Resting hemodynamics revealed mild central hypertension with
blood pressure 150/55 mmHg. PA systolic pressure was normal at
28 mmHg. Mean PCWP was normal at 10 mmHg. Cardiac index was
normal at 2.8 L/min/m2 by Fick.
4. Successful treatment of distal OM with 2.5 x 28 mm Cypher
drug-eluting stent postdilated with 2.0 mm balloon. Final
angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis, no
angiographically apparent dissection, and normal flow (See PTCA
Comments).
5. Intevention of the AV groove LCx complicated by inability to
deflate 2.0 mm Sprinter balloon despite aggressive negative
suction and requiring balloon rupture at 20 ATM of pressure
which resulted in rupture of the artery. A total of 30 minutes
of low pressure inflation proximal to the perforation and 10
minutes of observation resulted in a final angiogram showing a
totally occluded distal vessel and no
remaining evidence of perforation. Stat echocardiography and
right heart catherization revealed no effusion/tamponade and
stable pressures.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal right heart pressures.
3. Central hypertension.
4. Successful placement of drug-eluting stent in distal OM.
5. Intervention of AV groove LCx complicated by inability to
deflate balloon requiring balloon rupture and causing vessel
perforation.
6. Successful treatment of vessel perforation with prolonged
balloon inflations and observation.

[**9-7**] ECHO
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular  hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed. Resting regional wall  motion abnormalities include
basal to mid inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis.  Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic  root is moderately dilated. The ascending aorta is
moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
1)CAD: This pleasant 86 y/o male, with an extensive cardiac
history, presented from an OSH with unstable angina for cardiac
cath. He underwent cardiac cath with stenting of OMI, followed
by rupture of the LCX secondary to failure of balloon deflation
(please see report for full details). A second balloon was
subsequently used to tamponade the rupture. Stat echocardiogram
demonstrated no evidence of effusion or tamponade. Following
cardiac cath, he was monitored in the CCU overnight without
hemodynamic compromise. He remained chest pain free post-cath.
Re-peat echocardiogram the following morning continued to
demonstrate no evidence of effusion. Resting regional wall
motion abnormalities including basal to mid-
inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis was demonstrated. Troponins
on admission were negative. Troponins subsequently trended up to
0.13 post-cath, likely secondary to his lcx intervention. This
elevation was not associated with chest pain. The patient
continued to do well, remaining chest pain free, breathing on
room air, ambulating without complaint upon discharge.

2)Blood loss anemia: Recieved 2 units of packed red blood cells
for HCT of 27 post cath. Post-cath hct 30.5, remained stable.
Groin site remained clean and dry without evidence of bleeding
or hematoma.

3)Pump: Euvolemic. Depressed EF in past and noted to be 40% by
ECHO.

4)Rhythm: AV paced.

5)Renal - Recieved cath hydration and mucomyst. Creatinine
remained at 1.5-1.7, which is his baseline.
