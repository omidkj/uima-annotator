Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 465**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p fall out of wheelchair

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
74M w/h/o Afib, HTN, COPD, DM, PVD, CVA, s/p fall w/ SAH.  Until
two days prior, when he presented to OSH for routine arterial
studies of RLE for PVD. Following studies, pt was brought to
entrance of clinic in wheelchair, and subsequently found to have
fallen out of wheelchair with abrasions to right frontal area of
head, as well as R arm. Taken there directly to OSH ED.
.
At OSH, initial labs INR 2.3, PTT 38, Hct 29.7, Plt 264. CT head
revealed bilat SAH, no midline shift. Pt was given two units
PRBCs and two units FFP. Received 1g fosphenytoin load, vitk 5mg
SC. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**] ED, given 2units of Proplex, when INR on arrival was
1.9, Hct down to 25.2 from reported 29.7. Initially guaiac
negative in ED.
.
Since arrival, CT head again confirmed bilat SAH. Pt was started
on nimodipine to prevent cerebral vasospasm, all anticoagulation
held.
.
per wife: + DOE for the last year, only walk 20 ft, but no
CP/shoulder pain/neck pain/no palpitations/ n/v/diaphoresis. No
PND/orthopnea, syncope or presyncope. + bilateral claudication
+LE edema:R>L.  Denies f/c/sweats, weight changes, abd pain,
melena, hematochezia, dysuria, urinary frequency,
arthralgia/myalgia or rashes. + cough and wheeze, but generally
well-controlled with inhalers, and not currently worse from
baseline.

.
CTA Head:
Wet read: No aneurysm seen although reconstructions are pending.
Absent right vertebral artery.
.
CT Head:
IMPRESSION: Subarachnoid hemorrhage, greatest in the areas of
the sylvian fissures bilaterally. Though the etiology is likely
traumatic, an underlying aneurysm is not excluded.
The extensive nature of the hemorrhage, and the apparent
spherical area of high density in the left sylvian fissure
(seires 2 image 15) raise a concern of aneurysmal bleeding.
Recommend CTA, MRA, or catheter arteriography for further
evaluation.
.
CT Abd/Pelvis [**2132-9-11**]
1. No definite acute traumatic injury identified. There is very
mild wedging of the anterior portion of the T11 vertebral body,
of undetermined age.
2. Indeterminate left adrenal lesion. This may represent an
adenoma, but further evaluation with CT or MR is recommended.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
4. Atherosclerosis of the abdominal aorta, with mild dilation of
the
infrarenal portion to 2.8 cm.
5. Enlarged prostate.
.
TTE [**2132-9-16**]: left and right atriums moderately dilated; mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy; left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%); increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). No masses or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle. Mild to moderate mitral
regurgitation is seen- the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated;
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension; no
pericardial effusion.
.
CXR [**2132-9-16**]:persistence of small bilateral pleural effusions,
with minimal congestive heart failure/volume overload, mild
improvement from [**2132-9-13**].

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 74yoM w/ h/o DM, HTN, PVD, COPD, here s/p fall w/ SAH now
w/ SOB and ARF.
.
# Cards- Vasculopath, longstanding h/o HTN now w/SOB and pleural
effusion, cardiomegaly on CXR
- Pump- echo shows EF 70%
-- Hold on standing lasix
- Rate/Rhythm- A. Fib; rate controlled
-- continue Atenolol, Diltiazem
-- anticoagulation held [**2-14**] falls (was on ASA, plavix, coumadin
when fell)
- Coronaries
-- Plan for outpt w/u w/exercise stress when stable.
- HTN
-- d/c Atenolol, start Metoprolol, start hydralazine/isosorbide
dinitrate; Plan to restart ACE [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] d/c hydral/isosorbide
at that time.
.
# Renal- ARF on CRI(baseline Cr unknown), initiall oliguric, now
autodiuresing
-- Cr on admission 1.7, discharge creatinine 2.1 Pt w/ recent
h/o contrast studies [**2132-9-11**], [**2132-9-12**]; FENA 0.2- Prerenal/ATN.
- transfusion of 1 unit overnight followed by Diuril 500 mg IV
and IV Lasix 120 mg with improvement in UO
- Urine Alb/Cr ratio 0.7 likely secondary to long standing DM
and Hypertension
- Plan to restart ACE [**Month/Day/Year **] as above.
.
# Pulm- SOB, 92% on 6L, 80's on RA; ABG: 7.44/33/82
- Pleural effusions- most likely [**2-14**] CHF
-- continue to diurese
-- renal consulted, recommending fluid challenge followed by
diuresis.
-- f/u CXR showing resolution of effusions,
