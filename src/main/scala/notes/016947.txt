History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] yoM with PMH significant for CHF, CAD, HTN, DM,
mild dementia, CVA, PE on coumadin, and s/p L hip repair on
[**2124-8-13**], who was was found to be semi-repsonsive at home on
[**2124-9-11**]. Patient has been weak and lethargic for a few days
since returning home from [**Hospital3 2558**] on [**2124-9-9**], and wife
mentioned that he has been having dark stool for three days.
While patient was walking to the bathroom, pt felt weak and
became acutely less responsive. Mrs. [**Known lastname **] called 911 and he was
brought to the ED for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were: afebrile 139/63 56 19 94% on 2L.
He was lethargic but reponded appropriately to questions,
denying CP/SOB. His rectal exam showed red blood, but no frank
hemorrhage. Labs revealed HCT 20 from baseline 29. His EKG was
significant for new ST depressions in V2-V6. An NG lavage was
performed which was negative. GI was consulted, recommended IV
PPI bolus and gtt. Given his ST depressions in V2-V6, cards was
called, and recommended continuing plavix and coumadin
(therapeutic), but no asa due to allergy (anaphylaxis). Received
2 units of FFP and 2 large bore IVs and was admitted.
.
Upon immediate arrival to MICU, while being turned by nursing,
the patient was noted to be agonally breathing and became
asystolic on the monitor. A code blue was called. Pt was
intubated. A sinus ryhthm of 20 was noted, and the patient
received 1 round of epinephrine and atropine and regained both
pulse and blood pressure. Rhythm was noted to be SVT with
abberency. No antiarryhthmics were administered. Central and
arterial access was obtained, and he received 1 unit of PRBCs
and 1L NS wide open. Then he was intubated.
.
His cardiac arrest was thought to be likly due to demand
ischemia from GI bleed which triggered myocardial infarction and
potentially cardiac arrest. Coumadin was held and Plavix was
given instead. His GI bleed ceased and Hct stabilized at 31.4
post total 5 units of tranfusion and fluid resuscitation. Echo
was done to evaluate LVEF and showed EF of 35%-->20%. He had
acute on chronic renal failture at Cr of 3.2 from 2.7, now at
3.4. GI was consulted and considered EGD but decided to do as an
elective EGD prior to D/C if pt re-bleeds since no further
episodes of GI bleed occured and Hct stabilized. Patient was
extubated on [**2124-9-13**] and pt tolerated well at O2 sat greater
than 95%. Oxygen was weaned as tolerated. Given patient's
moderatly stable conditon, it was decided to transfer pt to
regular floor for further management.

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS [**2124-9-16**]
Cresentic thrombus within the left popliteal vein which is only
partially occlusive and is most consistent with chronic DVT with

recanalization. No evidence of acute DVT within the lower
extremities.
.
Echo [**2124-9-11**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 20 %) with global hypokinesis and inferior, septal and
apical akinesis. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
.
ECG [**2124-9-14**]
Sinus bradycardia. Ventricular ectopy. Left axis deviation.
Right
bundle-branch block with left anterior fascicular block. There
are Q waves
in the inferior leads consistent with prior myocardial
infarction. There are tiny R waves in the anterior leads
consistent with probable prior anterior myocardial infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing there is no significant change


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male with extensive cardiac disease including
CAD s/p MI and CABG, PE on coumadin, who presents with lethargy
and black stools, found to have a GI bleed, who is s/p cardiac
arrest and resuscitation. Patient was intubated and sedated in
MICU, successfully extubated on [**2124-9-13**], and transferred to
regular floor([**2124-9-14**]) for further care.
.
# CAD s/p Cardiac Arrest: Extensive previous cardiac history s/p
CABG. His EKG on this admission demonstrated changes c/w
ischemia, most likely due to demand from GI bleeding. Trop-T was
elevated in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure, but
MB-index was positive, again likely due to demand ischemia. This
could have triggered myocardial infarction and potentially his
cardiac arrest. Less likely to be ACS/unstable plaque rupture.
Patient was transferred to regular floor after extubation in
MICU. Pt was monitored on tele with no acute episode of cardiac
symptoms or any signs of cardiogenic shock. The benefit of ICD
was discussed since LVEF at 20%, but Cardiologist thought that
he would not b
