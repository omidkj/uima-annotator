Brief Hospital Course:
1. EtOH withdrawal: Pt was initiated on CIWA scale and was
loaded with IV Valium, requiring 50mg IV in the ED.  He was
requiring hourly checks for withdrawal and was sent to the
[**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU for closer monitoring.  His CIWA score subsequently
decreased and was sent to the floor on [**2134-10-8**].   There were no
episodes of seizure.  On day of discharge the patient was >
72hours from his last drink and had an unremarkable CIWA score.
He was discharged with four tablets of 5mg Valium for anxiety.

2. Hematemesis: NG lavage was performed in the ED which was
negative.  Rectal guiaic for occult blood was negative.  A GI
consult was obtained for further evaluation of his UGI tract
given his history of HCV and past UGIB requiring transfusions.
Serial HCT checks have been stable with no evidence of blood
loss.  GI recommended further outpatient workup to be performed
either at the [**Hospital1 65180**] or at [**Hospital1 18**].  The patient reports that he has
a planned upper and lower endoscopy at the [**Hospital1 65180**] later this month
and is already taking Protonix.

3. Anemia: Notable anemia on laboratory data, likely
iron-deficiency.  He was started on FeSO4 and instructed to
continue these tablets.
