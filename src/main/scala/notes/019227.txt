dropped to 50s systolic - D/C'ed propofol and gave fluid bolus,
pressures improved.  Pt switched to fentanyl/versed.  Also given
IV solumedrol.  Fem TLC placed.

CT Abdomen ([**4-17**]) - CT of the abdomen with contrast: There are
emphysematous changes at both lung bases. There are small
bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar dependent atelectasis.
The liver and spleen are normal. The pancreas and adrenal glands
are normal. Both kidneys and ureters are normal. There is stable
dilatation of the extrahepatic bile ducts and common bile duct.
There are multiple lymph nodes in the mesentery, not meeting
pathologic criteria and size. There are atherosclerotic
calcifications of the aorta and its branches. The loops of small
bowel are distended, but do not display wall thickening or
transition point. There is diastasis of the anterior abdominal
musculature, but no definite hernia. The colon is markedly
abnormal. The most prominent abnormality is seen within the
cecum and ascending colon with marked wall thickening, edema,
and adjacent stranding. There is also free fluid adjacent to the
right colon. There is a normal appearing hepatic flexure. The
rest of the transverse colon also displays wall thickening,
however. The descending colon is also abnormal, but to a lesser
degree with less wall thickening and adjacent free fluid. The
terminal ileum is relatively spared. The SMA, celiac axis, are
normal. The [**Female First Name (un) 899**] is not discretely identified. There may be some
air within the wall of the right colon, but this is difficult to
definitively assess. No free air within the abdomen. No portal
venous air.
CT of the pelvis with contrast: There is free fluid within the
pelvis. There is a rectal tube and a Foley catheter. The uterus
and adnexa are normal. No inguinal lymphadenopathy.

CTA Chest ([**2105-4-8**]) - CT OF THE CHEST: There are no significant
axillary or mediastinal lymph nodes. There are enlarged hilar
lymph nodes bilaterally. The largest one on the right side
measures 2.2 x 1.3 cm.
Evaluation of the pulmonary arteries was optimal. There is a
single filling defect in the subsegmental branch going to the
apical segment of the right upper lobe. This finding is
consistent with a tiny pulmonary embolism. No other filling
defects were seen. There is no CT evidence of pulmonary artery
hypertension.
Lung windows demonstrate severe emphysematous changes with
bullae of varying sizes. There are lung nodules. One is 6 mm and
is located in association with an area of pleural thickening.
There are multiple calcified granulomas throughout the lungs.
Another small noncalcified opacity in the right upper lobe
measures 2 x 6 mm (series 2 image 31). Another noncalcified
pleural based opacity is seen on series 2 image 131 and measures
6 mm. Another noncalcified opacity in the lingula measures 6 mm
(series 2B image 39). Another noncalcified pleural based opacity
(series 3 image 48) measures 6 x 9 mm. Although this most likely
represents granulomatous changes follow-up is recommended. There
are areas of septal thickening in the left lower lobe which are
slightly nodular and could represent lymphangitic spread of
tumor or an acute infection. Follow-up is definitely
recommended. Below this area there is a patchy area of air space
disease that may represent an acute infectious process. However,
follow-up is also recommended for this area.


Brief Hospital Course:
##  hypercarbic respiratory failure - pt's respiratory failure
was thought to be likely due to COPD exacerbation.  Underlying
precipitant was most likely pneumonia, as pt had a retrocardiac
opacity on CXR.  Pt was ruled out for influenza with a negative
DFA.  She was started on ceftriaxone/azithromycin.  Sputum
cultures grew out Moraxella catarrhalis.  Due to her respiratory
failure, she was intubated in the ED and admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
She was continued on the ab
