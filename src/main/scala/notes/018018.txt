IMAGING:
-------------------
Head CT [**8-17**]:
FINDINGS: There is a right crescentic hyper-attenuating area
layering over
the convexity, likely a subdural hematoma. At the level of the
lateral
ventricles superiorly (series 2, image 19), it measures
approximately 1.5 cm, similar to the study from approximately
three hours prior. Again, there is effacement of the right
lateral ventricle with leftward midline shift of approximately 7
mm, similar to prior. No new focus of intracranial hemorrhage is
seen. Some of the subdural extends into the parafalcine area on
the right. There is mild edema, and the ventricles, sulci, and
cisterns appear similar to prior. Basal cisterns are preserved.
There is no depressed skull fracture. Mastoid air cells and
visualized paranasal sinuses are unremarkable. Scleral plaques
are seen.
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance to right convexity subdural
hematoma with
unchanged leftward midline shift.

Head CT [**8-17**](Post-op):
FINDINGS: The patient is status post right-sided craniectomy for
evacuation
of a large right-sided subdural hematoma. Most of this hematoma
has been
evacuated although residual amount of hemorrhage is seen
overlying the right frontal lobe. There is extensive
pneumocephalus extending along the right hemisphere and also
over the left frontal lobe in addition to the right anterior
temporal lobe. A small focus of air is also seen anterior to the
left temporal lobe. There is still a mild leftward shift of
midline
structures of 4 mm, decreased from 7 mm. No intraparenchymal
hemorrhage is
seen. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation is preserved. Visualized
paranasal
sinuses and mastoid air cells remain clear.
IMPRESSION: Status post right-sided craniectomy for evacuation
of subdural
hematoma. Small amount of hemorrhage remains overlying the right
frontal lobe and right occipital lobe. Decrease in leftward
shift of midline structures, now 4 mm down from 7 mm.

CXR [**8-17**]:
IMPRESSION:
Satisfactory placement of a new right central venous catheter
with no
pneumothorax. Stable small right pleural effusion and left lower
lobe
atelectasis.

CXR [**8-21**]:
The Dobbhoff tube tip continues to be in proximal stomach. The
pacemaker
leads terminate in right ventricle. The right subclavian line
tip is at the
level of cavoatrial junction. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
unchanged
including mild cardiomegaly. Bibasal atelectasis and bilateral
pleural
effusions are unchanged. No overt infection is present. Loose
bodies are
demonstrated in the right glenohumeral joint.

Rt Foot [**8-21**]:
FINDINGS: There is a comminuted, slightly angulated fracture of
the proximal phalanx of the fourth digit. The proximal phalanx
of the fifth digit is not well seen and the possibility of a
fracture in this region cannot be unequivocally excluded.


Brief Hospital Course:
#) Course with neurosurgery:  Patient is a [**Age over 90 **]F who was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after OSH imaging revealed a right sided
acute SDH.  This finding was likely resultant from a fall that
the family reports occurred one week prior to admission. The
family was extensively counseled, and elected for decompressive
craniotomy and evacuation of blood products.  She went to the OR
on the evening of [**8-17**]. Procedure was uneventful, and she was
returned to the ICU post-operatively.  On [**8-18**], Aspirin was
started given her history of CAD with stend and pacemaker
placement. CXR imaging performed in the emergency department
revealed a consolidation consitent with a likely pneumonia and
antibiotics were started. On [**8-19**] bronchoscopy was performed for
confirmation and GNR were isolated. She was continued on
Ceftriaxone for this purpose.  On [**8-20**] she was sucessfully
extubated. She was requiring oxygen. On [**8-21**] her right lateral
foot and 4th digit was noted to be ecchymotic and exquisitely
tender. X-ray imaging revealed a comminuted, slightly angulated
fracture of the proximal phalanx of the fourth digit. Transfer
orders for the Step Down unit were performed.
.
On transfer to medicine service:
.
#) Altered mental status: since her evacuation, patient had a
difficult time waking up, and arrived to us with sluggishly
reactive pupils, periodically spontaneously opening her eyes,
withdrawing to pain and moving all four extremities.  Her mental
status was complicated by hypernatremia, hypoxia related to
volume overload and possible infection, in addition to her
recent SDH and midline shift.  As her hypernatremia corrected,
her mental status initially improved after a few days, then she
again became more unresponsive, not opening her eyes
spontaneously and having more difficulty supporting herself in
bed.
.
#) Hypoxia: throughout her stay on the medicine service, patient
had a perisistent tachypneia and oxygen requirement.  Initially,
her chest x-ray showed severe pulmonary edema and large
bilateral pulmonary effusions, which improved with IV diuresis,
however the effusions remained and her oxygen requirement also
did not improve.  An echocardiogram was done earlier in her
hospital course, which showed right sided heart strain, and
concern for PE, however given recent SDH, patient would not be
anticoagulated, so no further imaging was obtained.  Patient had
also had a persistent leukocytosis, and given the coarse breath
sounds on pulmonary exam, she was started on levaquin for
presumed pnuemonia.  She had been receiving nebulizer
treatments, and morphine to help with her tachypneia during her
stay.
.
#) Hypernatremia: patient initially had a sodium of 155, daily
free water deficits were calculated and free water was repleted
via her dobhoff tube, once her sodium normalized, her mental
status did not improve with correction of her sodium.
.
#) Goals of Care: on transfer of care to medicine palliative
care had been consulted, and it was clear that the goals of care
from the daughter's point of view were comfort oriented.  As the
patient's mental status improved
