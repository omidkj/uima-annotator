character. Non-radiating. +Associated with nausea today but
otherwise not usually. No shortness of breath or diaphoresis.

Pertinent Results:
[**10-13**] Cardiac cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography in this
right dominant system demonstrated 3 vessel disease.  The LMCA
had mild disease.  The LAD had an 80% lesion at D2 bifurcation,
and D2 had an 80% stenosis.  The LCx had a 60% lesion at OM1.
The RCA was totally occluded with left to right collaterals. 2.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic arterial pressure
of 133/81 while the patient was on IV nitroglycerine.
[**10-19**] Echo: PREBYPASS: 1. The left atrium is normal in size. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. 2. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of
inferior and inferoseptal walls, EF 40%. The remaining left
ventricular segments contract normally. 3. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 4. The ascending,
transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter
and free of atherosclerotic plaque. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. 5. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. 6. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. 7. There is no pericardial effusion. 8. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was
notified in person of the results. POST-CPB: On phenylephrine,
atrial pacing. Improved systolic function post bypass. LVEF is
now 45-55%. The inferoseptal hypokinesis is improved. MR is 1+.
Aortic contour is normal post decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname 1726**] was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] after being ruled in for a Myocardial Infarction. Upon
admission he was appropriately medically managed and then
underwent a cardiac cath on [**10-13**]. Cath revealed severe three
vessel disease. Over the next several days patient was worked-up
for upcoming surgery. Surgery was waited upon until Plavix
washout. During this time he was medically managed. On [**10-19**] he
was brought to the operating room where he underwent a coronary
artery bypass graft x 3. Please see operative report for
surgical details. Following surgery he was transferred to the
CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. Within 24
hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact
and extubated. Chest tubes were removed on post-op day one and
he was transferred to the telemetry floor for further care.
There he was seen in consultation by the [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes service
for his elevated blood sugars and pre-op Hgb A1C of 10.2.  His
insulin was increased accordingly.  He was also seen by social
work to help manage finances and obtain the medicines he needs
to control his diabetes.  His beta blockade was increased as
tolerated.  He was placed on [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] rather than an ACE for his
ejection fraction of 46% because he was on this medication
pre-operatively.  He was discharged to home on post-operative
day 4.
