Weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Lumbar Puncture
Paracentesis


History of Present Illness:
75 yo M hx CAD s/p NSTEMI, a. fib not on Coumadin with 1 day hx
generalized fatigue, weakness, poor PO, decreased UOP. Patient
was in his USOF on Weds when he saw his new PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. On
[**Holiday **] Eve, his daughter brought him to dinner at her house
and noticed that after walking down the stairs that he was
having difficulty walking. His daughter also notes that he just
seemed "off" that night. He did not sleep well that night, and
today he felt lethargic, but otherwise denied fevers, abdominal
pain, dysuria, headaches, neck pain and diarrhea. Decreased
urine output was noted today.

In the ED, patient's altered mental status improved and he did
not receive CT head. CXR revealed pleural effusions but no
obvious consolidation. FAST was positive for fluid in ruq and
luq. Troponin was elevated but consistent with prior falues. EKG
was paced without ischemic changes. UA was clean. Saturating was
80% according to EMS, but 100% on 4 l in the ED. He was
hypotensive to the 80s/50s in the ED and responded to 3 L NS.
Cardiology was consulted and advised Medicine bed. When bed was
assigned, patient became hypotensive with MAP of 58. He was
initially started on dobutamine which was later transitioned to
levphed. He received Vanco and Zosyn in the ED.

He has had 2 recent hospital stays this month. The first at
[**Hospital1 18**] was from [**10-29**] through [**11-4**] was for NSTEMI which was felt
to be related to demand ischemia in the setting of afib with
RVR. He was not started on anticoagulation given prior GI
bleeding. Failure to thrive workup was not pursued given that he
had a recent colonoscopy/egd, CT head and chest at [**Hospital 6451**] hospital within the past year.

The second hospital stay was from [**11-6**] to [**11-8**] for hypotension
in the setting poor po intake. He was thought to have food
poisoning. Po intake improved with zofran and fluids. The
patient's hypotension was not symptomatic, wht SBP ranging from
90 to 100. Right pleural effusion was noted in the setting of
smoking history, and thoracentesis was deferred until patient
could follow up as an outpatient.

In the ICU, Mr. [**Known lastname 64592**] is feeling well and has no specific
complaints. He says that his neck feels stiff but that this is
chronic. He has [**Last Name **] problem with neck ROM.

ROS was otherwise essentially negative. The pt denied recent
fevers, night sweats, chills, headaches, dizziness or vertigo,
changes in hearing or vision, including amaurosis fugax, neck
stiffness, lymphadenopathy, hematemesis, coffee-ground emesis,
dysphagia, odynophagia, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation, steatorrhea, melena, hematochezia, cough,
hemoptysis, wheezing, shortness of breath, chest pain,
palpitations, dyspnea on exertion, increasing lower extremity
swelling, orthpnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, leg pain while
walking, joint pain.

5) chronic kidney disease with baseline Cr 2.7
6) angiodysplasia of stomach and small intestine with serial

7) GI bleeding chronic anemia (multifactorial, thought to be [**12-29**]
kidney disease + GI bleeding)
8) prior TIA ([**4-3**], ? [**8-5**])
9) melanoma, right forearm
10) multiple BCCs
11) Diverticulosis

[**2189-11-24**] RENAL ULTRASOUND:
Small echogenic right kidney, with normal-appearing left kidney.

No hydronephrosis.

ULTRASOUND (ABD) [**2189-11-22**]: Moderate ascites with appropriate
spot for paracentesis marked in the right lower quadrant.

[**2189-11-23**] LENI:  No evidence of DVT in bilateral lower extremity.

[**2189-11-21**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST:
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. Hypodense white

matter changes- current CT is significantly limtied due to
motion.
Pt. appears to have pacemaker on concurrent PXR Chest, whick
precludes MR
study. Hence, a close follow up with motion elimination when the
pt. is cooperative, can be onsidered for
