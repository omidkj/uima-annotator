SENSITIVITIES.
         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.
         SULFA X TRIMETH sensitivity testing performed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3077**]

Brief Hospital Course:
84F with CHF and CRI p/w fever to 102 and hypotension following
a R shoulder arthroplasty on [**2143-8-19**]

# Septic shock:
[**5-8**] blood cx from admission grew GP cocci and clusters speciated
to be coagulase negative staph.  The most likely source is
post-operative shoulder infection / septic joint given clinical
exam of erythema of effected shoulder. She transiently required
levophed, but was weaned off as she was aggressively fluid
resuscitated. She underwent I&D of R shoulder with replacement
of joing liner on [**8-23**]. Cultures were sent. Infectious disease
was consulted and recommended vancomycin and ceftriaxone while
awaiting sensitivities; culture returned on [**8-29**] with staph epi.
She will continue on ceftriaxone monotherapy, 2 grams daily, for
at least 2 weeks (course to be determined by outpatient ID
team).  She may require oral suppressive therapy thereafter.
Outpatient ID and ortho follow up arranged.
.
# s/p R shoulder surgery: most likely source of sepsis.  Went to
OR for I&D and replacement of joint capsule on [**8-23**]. She is
discharged in sling; non weight bearing, ortho follow up in
place.
.
# Hypoxemia in setting of h/o dCHF:
Likely due to atelectasis and effusion demonstrated on CXR.  Low
suspicion for PNA as clinically did not have cough.  When she
returned from OR, had flash pulmonary edema and responded well
to lasix. She was extubated morning after wash out and required
another dose of lasix.  She was then maintained on her home
lasix dose.
.
# Anemia:
Upon admission, her Hct down 14 points since [**8-12**].  Per prior
heme/onc workup, possible etiologies include chronic disease,
B12 deficiency, sarcoid (marrow involvement).  Increased in
response to first unit pRBCs, subsequently received total of 2
units in transfusion.  Haptoglobin, lactate did not indicate
hemolysis; hct subsequently remained stable.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure:
Cr up to 1.7 at admission from baseline 1.0, back to 1.0 with
fluid resuscitation.
.
# dCHF: Upon admission to the ICU, she was hypotensive.  Her
home dose of furosemide and metoprolol were held. She had flash
pulmonary edema most likely to fluids during OR and responded
well to furosemide.  She medications were slowly resumed with
the exception of amlodipine which can be re-started if her blood
pressure tolerates it.
.
# Altered Mental Status at 11pm on [**8-22**], pt had a
