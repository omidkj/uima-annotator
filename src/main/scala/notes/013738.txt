History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] is a 64 year-old gentleman with prior
history of OA of both hips (w/o hardware or surgery) with fever,
chills, hip pain and MSSA septic joints who is being transfer to
medicine for further management. He first started on [**2-14**] with
subjective fevers and quantified T 102.x on [**2-15**] with groin
pain. The following day he went to his PCP who performed blood
and urine cultures. On [**2-17**] he could not ambulate due to hip
pain anr presented to [**Hospital6 **] after having onset of
sweats and chills on [**2-14**] and bilateral (L > R) hip pain on
[**2-15**]; chronic much milder hip pain for >= 6 months.  He was
admitted to [**Hospital6 **] on [**2-17**] after a clinic visit,
noted to have fevers; an initially normal WBC with significant
bandemia gradually increased to leukocytosis.  Blood cultures
demonstrated MSSA, aspiration of both hips demonstrated MSSA.  A
TEE was performed on [**2-17**] at NEBH without any anatomical
abnormality or vegetation seen.  Subsequently, he had a
Girdlestone procedure on the left on [**2-19**] and on the right on
[**2-20**] (first operative report does not describe findings; second
operative report describes "rush of white pus" and bony
erosions, soft superiorly).  After the second surgical
procedure, he had difficulty weaning from the ventilator.  A CT
of the head was performed and demonstrated a left cerebellar
stroke.  He was subsequently transferred to the neurology
service, in the SICU, at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2167-2-21**].  He remained
intubated for 5 days w/o any pressor need. He had RIJ in place
at NEBH removed and cultured on [**2-22**] and then had L subclavian
placed and A line ([**2-18**]). RIJ was pulled on [**2-26**] and tip was
not cultured. Patient was found on ARF of unknown etiology with
creatinine of 1.4, worsening up to 1.9 and now currently 1.5.
His baseline eGFR is unknown. Upon admission his LDH, AP, AST
were elvated and all trended down, but LDH has been stable in
the ~300 range (today 395). His hematocrit was 27.8 and trended
down up to 19. Pt also had an INR of 1.2-1.3. For these two
reasons heme-onc was consulted, who ruled out hemolysis. They
suggested Vit K deficiency as etiology for slighlty increased
INR. Mixing studies are pending. There has not been any source
of bleeding and pt is guaiac negative so far. Hips look intact.
However, patient has required 2 PRBC today (1/2 [**3-9**] fever).

Upon arrival patient was on Nafcillin and was switched to
Vanc/Zosyn. ID was consulted and suggested switching him from
Vanc/Zosyn to Nafcillin/Gentamycin (Day 1 [**2-21**]). Gentamycin was
stopped on [**2-28**]. Patient is still febrile up to 100.5. Cultures
have been negative so far. Upon arrival patient has inferior lip
ulcers comaptible with HSV and was treated with acyclovir
([**Date range (1) 81702**]). ID suggests repeat TEE and complete 6-week course
of Nafcillin.
.
Pt denies any history of sick contacts, has history of contact
with children, people with recent hospitalizations, and no
recent antibiotic treatment.  Within the last week, he had a
significant pimple on his nose with pus, skinned his knuckles
doing housework, and has had long-standing dry, cracked
fingertips.  He has not had significant dental procedures
(cleaning > 1 month prior), nor has he had any surgeries or
procedures or prior hospitalizations.  He has long-standing
osteoarthritis only of the hips, and was planning
replacement surgery.
