Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**]
Chief Complaint:
seizure with fall and T1 pedicle fracture

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Open treatment of extension-type fracture dislocation T8-
    T9 and extension type dislocation fracture of T1-T2.
2. Posterior spinal instrumentation and fusion C6-T3.
3. Posterior spinal instrumentation and fusion T7-T10.
4. Application of allograft and local autograft.


History of Present Illness:
A 53-year-old man a with refractory seizures on three AEDs and
VNS. He presented to local hospital with a fall during a
seizure.
As per witnesses his seizure occurred while practicing for
special Olympics, he initially hit his forehead onto an object
and then fell backwards on the ground and hit his occipital
area.
He has no recollection of the seizure himself. At the local
hospital a T1 pedicle fracture was found with no signs of facial
or cranial fracture. Despite the T1 fracture he had no C/T
spinal
tenderness or bruising and ortho at [**Hospital1 18**] cleared him for a TLSO
brace. He currently is in neck collar awaiting the TLSO to be
custome made.


Past Medical History:
- Refractory seizures since age 7 years
- VNS insertion in [**2164**]
- Mentally challenged as per previous Neuropsych evaluation
- cystic lesion Left temporal pole
- Hyperlipidemia on statin
- ? ankylosing spondylitis


Social History:
He lives at a group home. No history of tobacco,
EtOH or recreational drug use.


Family History:
NC

Physical Exam:
Physical examination:
General:
Vital signs were within normal limit.
Heart sounds were normal with no murmur; lungs were clear with
equal air entry, abdomen was soft and non-tender, extremities
were warm and pulses were palpable with no edema. Minor
lacerations over nasion.
Neurological:
The patient was drowsy but easily arousable. He was fully
oriented and had a normal language. On cranial nerve exam visual
fields were full, pupils were 1.5 mm equal and reactive to
light,
extraocular movements were full with no nystagmus, face
sensation
and movements were symmetric, there was no dysarthria and tongue
was midline. Strength was full throughout with no pronator
drift.
Postural tremor noted 2+ R and 1+ in hands, trace asterixis in
the hands. Tone was normal. Finger tapping was intact in both
hands. Tendon reflexes were [**12-17**] throughout and plantar responses
were flexor. Sensation to pinprick, vibration and touch were
normal throughout. Coordination was normal with finger-to-nose
bilaterally. Gait was not assessed but he mentioned being to
walk
with a walker.

Imaging studies:

CT OF THE CHEST:
The thyroid gland is normal. There is no axillary, hilar, or
mediastinal
lymphadenopathy. There is no aortic injury and pulmonary
arteries are normal. There is a small-to-moderate right simple
pleural effusion. There is no mediastinal hemorrhage or
pneumomediastinum.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN:
The liver is normal. The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, both
adrenal glands, and kidneys demonstrate no evidence of acute
injury. There are bilateral up to 11 mm hypoattenuating renal
lesions, too small to characterize but likely representing
simple cysts.
There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy.
There is no free air and no free fluid. The esophagus, stomach,
small and
large bowel including the appendix are normal.

CT OF THE PELVIS:
The prostate gland, seminal vesicles, and urinary bladder are
normal. There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy.

BONES: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions.
Fracture
through the anterior longitudinal ligament calcification (DISH)
at the T1/T2 level with widening of the anterior intervertebral
space. The fracture extends through the T1 pedicles and lamina
as seen on the OSH CT of the C-spine. This fracture involves the
anterior and posterior elements and is therefore potentially
unstable (series 300B, image 44). No additional fractures are
seen.

IMPRESSION:
1. Fracture through the anterior longitudinal ligament
calcifications (DISH) at the T1/T2 level and fracture through
the T1 pedicles and lamina as seen on the OSH CT of the C-spine.
This fracture involves the anterior and posterior elements and
is therefore potentially unstable.
2. No other acute injuries of the chest, abdomen and pelvis.
3. Small-to-moderate right pleural effusion.

[**3-23**] CXR:
FINDINGS: Portable AP chest radiograph demonstrates cervical and
thoracic
spinal fusion hardware and surgical staples overlying the
mediastinum. There are low lung volumes and dependent
atelectasis, greater on the right. An underlying effusion or
focal consolidation cannot be excluded. The cardiomediastinal
silhouette is mildly enlarged, likely related to recent surgery.
There is no pneumothorax.
[**3-25**] CXR:
FINDINGS:
The lung volumes are low. Mild- to moderate-sized right pleural
effusion and associated right lung base atelectasis is
unchanged. Cardiomediastinal
silhouette appears unusually large but its appearance may be
exaggerated
because of the low lung volumes. Hardware devices are seen in
the
cervicothoracic and lower thoracic spine. Left lung base and the
left
costophrenic angle is obscured by the apparently large
cardiomediastinal
silhouette. Left upper lungs appear clear.

BONE SCAN:

IMPRESSION: 1. Left T1 pedicle and spinous process uptake
consistent with
subacute fractures. No T1 vertebral body fracture detected. 2.
Lateral T8
tracer uptake bilaterally, corresponding to fractured
osteophytes on the CT1 examination, likely subacute. There is no
vertebral body fracture detected. 3. Distended bladder.
