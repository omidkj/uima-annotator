Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7744**]
Chief Complaint:
Found down


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central venous line placement
Intubation and mechanical ventilation
Extubation

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 47 year old with PMHx COPD who was found down
in hotel room.  Per report, he had been having several days of
N/V/D with possible AMS x1 day.  He was taken to [**Hospital3 **]
where he was found to be unconcious, hypotensive, altered,
mumbling, responding only to pain. He had right CVL placed,
started on levophed, and intubated.  He had a difficult
intubation requiring 30 of Etomidate and 10 of Vec and 2 passes
with a glide scope.  A 7.0mm tube was placed.  Labs returned
with Cr 9.7, K of 7.7 with peaked T waves and widened QRS.  He
was given CaCl x2, insulin/D50, 2 amps bicarb, and 3L NS.  He
was started on zosyn, but this was stopped when he reached [**Hospital1 18**]
as it was discovered he has an allergy to penicillin.  He was
initially difficult to ventilate at [**Hospital3 15402**] so was paralyzed
with 2 doses of vec and was given solumedrol/albuterol for
?obstructive process.  Transported via [**Location (un) **] to [**Hospital1 18**] during
which time he became easier to ventilate.  Labs showed K
remaining elevated at 6.8 - he got Cagluconate, amp of bicarb.
EKG improved, with slightly peaked T waves, QRS 78.  CT
Head/Neck was done and was ok.  CT A/P showed RLL consolidation,
confirmed on CT Chest.  ABG shoed increased CO2 so his RR  was
increased to 28.  He was given Levaquin/flagyl/vanco as well as
lasix 40mg IV with 3L urine output while in ED.
.
On arrival to the MICU, he was intubated and sedated on
pressors.

Imaging:
[**2102-4-20**] Portable CXR:
FINDINGS: An endotracheal tube terminates near the thoracic
inlet, approximately 7.5 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube
passes beneath the left hemidiaphragm, its distal course not
imaged. Opacification in the right lower hemithorax suggests a
pleural effusion with volume loss including mild rightward shift
of mediastinal structures most suggestive of atelectasis. An
infectious causes is not excluded, however. The left lung
appears clear.  Although the extreme left costophrenic sulcus is
partly excluded, there is no evidence for pleural effusion on
the left side. Allowing for technique, the cardiac, mediastinal
and hilar contours are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
1. Endotracheal tube in a somewhat high lying position,
approximately 7.5 cm above the carina. If clinically indicated,
the tube could be advanced by approximately 3 cm.
2. Right basilar opacification with volume loss including
suspicion for a
pleural effusion.
.
[**2102-4-20**] Head CT: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of intracranial
hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normally midline structures,
or vascular territorial infarct. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter
differentiation is preserved throughout. The ventricles and
sulci are normal in size and configuration. No fractures are
noted. Opacification within the paranasal sinuses is likely
related to recent intubation. Mastoid air cells are clear.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process.
.
[**2102-4-20**] CT Chest: FINDINGS: The right middle and lower lobe are
collapsed. Bronchiectasis is mild in the segmental and
subsegmental bronchi of the middle lobe, and in the subsegmental
divisions of the superior and basal segments. There is no
central bronchial  occlusion. The constellation suggests that
atelectasis may well be chronic. There is no indication of
pneumonia or pleural or pericardial abnormality. A few small
bronchi in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe are
impacted and there is mild heterogeneity in background density
of both upper lobes suggesting small airway obstruction or mild
emphysema. Mediastinal lymph nodes are not pathologically
enlarged. In the absence of contrast administration, I cannot
say that there are no enlarged right hilar lymph nodes (there
are none on the left), but even if right hilar nodes are
present, they are not contributing to the atelectasis because
there is no bronchial obstruction.
Heart is normal size and the study is notable for the virtual
absence of atherosclerotic calcification, except for small
plaques at the
