Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
CP; transfer for cardiac catheterization

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac cathererization with drug eluting stent to LIMA graft of
Left anterior descending artery


History of Present Illness:
82 yo with hx of DM, CAD s/p CABG [**2152**] redo [**10/2171**], CHF (EF 51%)
admitted to [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**1-7**] with CP. His course was
complicated by DTs [**1-29**] etoh w/d and he was intubated in the ICU.
He was in normal healthy until the am of [**1-7**] when he
experienced [**7-6**] substernal CP which was "squeezing" while
watching TV.  It lasted for 30 minutes without associated
radiation, SOB, nausea, diaphoresis, palpitations or
lightheadedness.  He did not take medications for this incident.
 After dinner he lies down normally for approx 1/2 hour but has
noticed SOB when supine over the past week.  He has gained 30
lbs over the last year.  He has had CP approximately 1X/year for
which he usually takes Nitro.

Patient's history is currently more variable.  He reports CP the
night prior to presentation for which he took SL Nitro X3. He
had chest pain the next am which did not respond to Nitro.  He
had assocaited nausea.  Patient notes that he had seizures
during these episodes- as he gets seizures the more he drinks.
However, he states that he has not had a drink in 3 weeks since
he went to rehab 2 weeks ago after being given an ultamatum by
his wife.

He went to the ED, and on the way experienced substernal chest
squeezing, [**4-6**] which lasted a couple of minutes and resolved
spontaneously. In the ED his VS were: 98.3, 92, 136/78, 92%/RA.
His SBP dropped to 77 and he received 2L NS and ASA.

He was initially started on high dose PPI given suspicion for
reflux.

The patient noted orthopnea and was found to be in respiratory
distress.  He was admitted to the ICU with CHF and etoh
withdrawal. He was agitated, tachycardic and hypertensive and
then dyspneic with 3 inches of nitro paste, 120mg Lasix, 6mg IV
ativan, 8mg IV morphine, 10mg IV lopressor.  He required
intubation for hypoxemic respiratory failure as his RR was 45,
he was sating 85% on NRB. He was treated while intubated with
Versed and Fentanyl. He was treated with Unasyn for a question
of aspiration pneumonia.  He was extubated on [**1-14**] with
continued aggressive diuresis.

He ruled in for a NSTEMI with Trops up to 1.5.
He was intubated and admitted ot he ICU and extubated on [**1-14**].
He was also requiring detox secondary to etoh abuse.

On [**1-18**] he had a Persantine stress with HR to the 80s, <70% of
target, with no ischemic EKG changes. APBs in receovery.
Negative sxs for angina. Nuclear imaging revealed LVEF 51%,
septal/inf wall and apical hypokineais with large mixed,
primarily ischemic septal defect extending into the anterior
wall. There was a mod/large inferior mixed, primaritly ischemic
defect extending into a portion of the lateral wall with apical
ischemia. There was a suggestion of LV dilation.

ROS negative for fevers or chills.  Positive for cough and
sputum which is present more when he drinks. He has had dysuria
since having the foley catheter at the OSH.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of current
chest pain. He does have dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, ankle
edema. Denies palpitations.

[**2182-1-22**]
Cardiac Catheterization: Selective coronary angiography in this
right-dominant system demonstrated native three-vessel disease.
The LMCA was occluded distally. The RCA had a proximal total
occlusion.
2. Arterial conduit angiography revealed the LIMA->LAD to have
80%
in-stent restenosis at the anastamosis.
3. Venous conduit angigoraphy revealed the SVG->diagonal branch
to be
widely patent. The SVG->OM1 had 80% in-stent restenosis.
4. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left- and right-sided
filling
pressures, with a PCWP of 34 mm Hg and an RA pressure of 12 mm
Hg. There
was moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension with a PASP of 53
mm Hg.
The cardiac index was preserved at 3.1 L/min/m2. The systemic
arterial
blood pressure was normal. There was a 15 mm Hg gradient upon
pullback
of the catheter from the left ventricle to the aorta.
5. Successful PCI of the ostial SVG-OM in-stent restenosis with
a
3.0x15mm Promus DES, post-dilated to 3.25mm.
6. Successful closure of the right femoral arteriotomy site with
a 6F
Angioseal device.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three-vessel native coronary artery disease.
2. Patent SVG->diagonal.
3. In-stent restenosis of the ostial SVG->OM stent and LIMA->LAD
anastamotic stent.
4. Severely elevated left- and right-sided filling pressures.
5. Moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension.
6. Successful PCI of the SVG-OM with DES.

[**2182-1-23**] TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There
is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-35
%). The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
mild aortic valve stenosis (val
