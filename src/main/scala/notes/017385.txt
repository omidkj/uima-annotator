Pertinent Results:
[**2151-11-19**]:  CT OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. No
fracture.
.
[**2151-11-22**] EEG
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to marked slowing in the record
overall
with decreased voltages combined with subtle delta bursts and
runs and
one brief blunted sharp and slow wave complex involving the
central
regions predominantly with a leftsided predominance. No
definitive
discharges were, however, seen. No response to one instance of
noxious
stimulation was noted. The record suggests a diffuse mild to
moderate
encephalopathy with some suspicion of left central focality on
one
occasion. The record, otherwise, would suggest a diffuse
possibly
subcortical or deeper midline process possibly related to
hypoxia or to
medications which the patient was receiving or to a post-ictal
state.
