Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1055**]
Chief Complaint:
Foreign body ingestion.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. EGD - removal of pens.


History of Present Illness:
30 y/o F with PMH notable for schizoaffective (dx called into
question in prior psychiatric notes), borderline personality
disorder and >100 foreign body ingestions admitted [**2125-4-9**] after
swallowing 2 BIC pens. The following is a brief synopsis of her
ICU stay.  Per review of her chart, she apparently was upset
with staff at her group home and rather than using DBT
techniques, reverted to old behavior patterns and swallowed the
pens.  She was intubated for EGD and the pens were removed
safely.  She was extubated without incident.  She remained
stable in the ICU, followed by psychiatry who recommended
antipsychoitics and benzodiaepines to control racing thoughts of
self harm as well as observed by a 1:1 sitter.  Psychiatry does
not necesarily recommend inpt psychiatry due to the supportive
environment (specialized group home) in which she lives.
