History of Present Illness:
81 year old woman recently hospitalized for tri-malleolar rt
ankle fracture s/p closed reduction presents to the ED after
becoming agitated and removing her soft cast at her
rehabilitation hospital. She sustained her fracture after
falling on [**10-26**]. She underwent closed reduction and was
discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**11-4**] to extended care facility. Shortly
after discharged, she was admitted to [**Hospital1 2025**] for AMS and thought to
have PNA. There, she was noted to have abnormal LFT's and
possible Afib per telephone note in OMR. She recently finished a
course of IV abx prescribed at [**Hospital1 2025**]. Back at her ECF, she started
having increasing pain of the right foot over the last several
days. Today the pain became 'excruciating' and patient became
agitated before taking off her cast. She was taken to the [**Hospital1 18**]
ED for further evaluation.

after feeling 'poorly'. UA was grossly purulent and CXR
suspicious for PNA. Patient received 1 dose of vancomycin,
cefepime, and levofloxacin. Foley catheter was exchanged, and
noted to have visible pus. BP was not responsive to 3.5 L IVF's
and patient was started on levophed prior to transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
On arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], BP was 134/60 and patient was weaned off
levophed. She denies recent fevers or chills. She has had a
chronic foley for several weeks, but denies discomfort. She
denies cough, but her sister notes that she has had one for

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2179-11-21**]**

   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2179-11-21**]):
      YEAST.    10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..
      GRAM POSITIVE BACTERIA.    10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..
         Alpha hemolytic colonies consistent with alpha
streptococcus or
         Lactobacillus sp.

IMAGING
CTA
1. No PE. New pulmonary hypertension, possibly due to chronic
venous occlusion.
2. Pulmonary atelectasis, with possible superimposed aspiration
or infection.
3. Volume overload, with bilateral pleural effusions and
ascites.
4. Subacute left 4th-9th rib fractures.
5. Right thyroid goiter is similar to [**2174**], but merits
outpatient followup
ultrasound.
6. Right peripheral catheter in midline position.
7. Endotracheal tube 2 cm from carina, please retract 2-3 cm.

CT Head
IMPRESSION: Chronic involutional changes. No intracranial
hemorrhage or
other concerning findings. Please note that MR with contrast
enhancement
would be more sensitive for detection of intracranial
metastases.

EEG
MPRESSION: Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and
disorganized background rhythm and due to the bursts of
generalized slowing. These findings indicate a widespread
encephalopathy affecting both cortical and subcortical
structures. Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection
are among the most common causes. There were no areas of
prominent focal slowing, but encephalopathies may obscure focal
findings. There were no epileptiform features. A markedly
abnormal cardiac rhythm was noted.

Renal U/s
1. No hydronephrosis or suspicious renal mass.
2. Stable nonobstructing stone in the left kidney.
3. High resistance state in the right kidney on Doppler
evaluation. No renal artery stenosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
MICU COURSE:
Patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] due to concern for sepsis
secondary to a UTI.  She was started on pressors and
aggressively fluid resuscitated.  Patient was noted to be in
atrial fibrillation with intermittent RVR.  She was also
profoundly delerious, which was thought to be multifactoral in
etiology.  When her pressor requirement did not improve with
antibiotic therapy and her urine culture was unremarkable, the
patient was electively intubated for a CTA and CT head, both of
which were unremarkable.  She remained intubated for a few days,
and then was successfully extubated.  However, her mental status
continued to deteriorate and she had only limited responses to
voice and painful stimuli.  Her urine output continued to
decline and her imaging should signs of fluid overload.  She was
diuresed with good response with her urine, however her mental
status did not improve.

Following a discussion with her sister, the focus of her care
was transitioned to comfort
