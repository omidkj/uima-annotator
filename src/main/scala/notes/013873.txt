Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
IV Dye, Iodine Containing / Risperdal

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1**]
Chief Complaint:
43-year-old gentleman with recurrent bouts of respiratory
failure status post tracheostomy, now vent-dependent, unable to
wean despite
tracheostomy placement.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2176-1-4**] flexible bronchoscopy
[**2176-1-12**] Resection cervical approach of massive substernal goiter


History of Present Illness:
This is a 43 yo M with mental retardation, seizure disorder,
hyperthyroidism, and large goiter extending to the mediastinum
and causing airway compromise resulting in trach and vent
dependency since [**7-8**] who was transferred from rehab for
management of goiter and vent weaning. The pt was first noted to
have a goiter 7 years ago, and per admission note, underwent
partial thyroidectomy at [**Hospital1 2025**] in [**2168**]. He was scheduled for a
total thyroidectomy in [**2170**], but this was cancelled due to the
death of the pt's father. The goiter continued to enlarge to the
point that it began to obstruct his airway. He presented to
[**Hospital 11485**] Med Center in [**7-8**] after a seizure followed by
respiratory arrest, intubation was unsuccesful, and pt required
an emergent tracheostomy. Multiple attempts to wean the vent
were unsuccesful, and he was transferred to rehab in [**11-8**] after
a G tube was placed. The pt was then admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**1-3**]
for total thyroidectomy and vent weaning.
.
A chest CT s contrast on [**1-3**] showed a massive thyroid goiter (20
X 11 X 8 cm) extending from the hypopharynx to the main PA
causing significant displacement of the trachea to the right and
compression of the mediastinal vasculature. He underwent a flex
bronch today which revealed supraglottic edema, subglottic
tracheal stenosis and malacia with granulation tissue, and no
evidence of dynamic lower airway obstruction. He is scheduled to
undergo a total thyroidectomy in the upcoming week.

Past Medical History:
Goiter with h/o hyperthyroidism - s/p partial resection in [**2168**]
at [**Hospital1 2025**], prior planned total thyroidectomy in [**2170**] cancelled, per
rehab d/c summary, "free T4 and free T3 levels have shown that
patient is euvolemic on current doses of methimazole." Per
sister, meds (i.e. dilantin and lithium) had been implicated in
development of pt's goiter. She does not know of any prior h/o
hypothyroidism, including Hashimoto's, or iodine deficiency.
Mental retardation
Seizure Disorder
h/o intracranial AVM with intracranial bleed at age 16
Diabetes inspidus
OSA
h/o agitation


Social History:
Lived with mother until mother passed away in [**8-8**], hospitalized
since [**7-8**] for respiratory failure. Most recently at rehab.
Sister is now primary guardian

Family History:
Mother deceased from lung CA. Father with CAD. No known family
history of thyroid disease.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Massive substernal goiter.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Same.

OPERATION:  Resection cervical approach.

INDICATION:  The patient had presented from an outside
institution with upper airway obstruction secondary to an
enlarging substernal goiter. An emergency tracheostomy was
performed there and eventually the patient transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**]. Preoperatively a full
discussion took place with the patient's sister who is his
health care proxy, as the patient has some degree of mental
retardation. The prior operation conducted at [**Hospital 76776**] apparently was accompanied by considerable blood loss and
in fact the left side was left in place at the time. Some
years went by, the left side continued to enlarge and
extended from below the angle of the jaw well into the chest
involving the pulmonary vasculature, superior vena cava, etc.

PREPARATION:  Once the patient was suitably identified by a
timeout and suitably positioned, the neck and chest were
prepared and draped appropriately. Recurrent laryngeal nerve
monitor was in place but there were techical issues with it.
Prior to the case placing the stimulator on the trachea viat the
tracheostomy site failed to elicit a signal.

Incision: A long cervical incision was made, flaps developed
and the thyroid gland exposed.

FINDINGS:  The patient had the expected massive enlargement
of the thyroid. In fact a scale in pathology could not
measure the specimen it was so big. One parathyroid gland was
seen and preserved. The recurrent laryngeal nerve was not
seen but I proceeded very very carefully a mm at a time in the
area where the nerve could have been. There was so much
displacment of the larynx from this goiter as well as rotation
that the usual landmarks did not apply. I was absolutely on the
capsule of the goiter at all times and in fact htis plane was
easily found.  We saw no nerve whatsoever and at the
end of the case the tissue that would contain the nerve
was well lateral to the field of dissection as a matter of
fact. The nerve stimulator appeared not to be working
correctly and seeing when we put the simulator into the
trachea prior to any dissection, there was no hint of any
activity.

TECHNIQUE:  All vessels were secured with the LigaSure device
and we made a lot of use of this during dissection. The
dissection began at the upper pole where several large
vessels were taken down. The gland was then rotated medially
and the immediate capsular plane of the goiter identified. It
was quite soft and not adherent at this point and I could
slip my finger alon
