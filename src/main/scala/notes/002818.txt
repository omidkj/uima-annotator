History of Present Illness:
58 year old female with hypothyroidism, HTN, and recently
diagnosed ALL(Precursor B-phenotype, [**Location (un) 5622**] chromosome
negative) discharged recently after an admission from ([**2113-1-6**]-
[**2113-1-26**]) after induction chemotherapy consisting of hyper-CVAD-
cyclophosphamid, mesna, mtx, doxorubicin, vincristine,
dexamethasone 40 mg/d dys [**12-22**] and [**11-1**]. She was then admitted
from [**Date range (1) 93815**] for part B hyper CVAD and developed febrile
neutropenia with fevers to 101.7 in the clinic. She developed
rhinorrhea and nasal congestion 2 days after being d/c'ed. She
then developed fevers to 101. She received Ertapenem as an
outpatient from [**2-13**] but her fever persisted to 101.7 on [**2-17**] in clinc and thus she was admitted. Her abx were changed to
Vanco/Cefepime on admission. She continued to experience
dyspnea, and CT scan performed on [**2-18**] showed bilateral
infiltrates/opacities, concerning for infection (? bacterial,
fungal, PCP). She was was started on antifungals receiving her
first dose on [**2-17**] along with levofloxacin on [**2-19**] for
atypical coverage.
.
On the day of transfer to the ICU pulmonary was consulted who
recommended sending a DFA, sputum for PCP and [**Name9 (PRE) 93816**] treatment
for PCP consisting of solumedrol and IV bactrim. Later that day
she had an an increasing O2 requirement from 94% on 2L to 90% on
3L to 100% on NRB. She remained febrile. ABG at this time (on
3.5 L) was 7.53/33/56. She was put on 100% NRP, and ABG on this
was 7.55.37.175). Pt was visibly tachypneic and using accessory
muscles to breathe. She was given 40mg IV lasix with net
negative = 1070. She was then transferred to the ICU for further
managemtnt. In the ICU pt improved overnight with gentle
diuresis. Her sputum was negative for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] did grow GNRs and
GPC. Her fungal coverage was discontinued. She is currently on
Levofloxacin/Cefepime as double coverage of GNR, and Vancomycin
given GPC. She is no longer neutropenic. She denied cough,
headache, abdominal pain, dysuria, n/v, diarrhea, blurred
vision.

Past Medical History:
1) ALL, Precursor B-phenotype (Induction with Hyper-CVAD
[**2113-1-7**], Negative for [**Location (un) 5622**] Chromosome)
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Obtained from chart review: 58 yo female with
a h/o hypothyroidism who presents for evaluation of possible
ALL. Pt was in USOH until [**12-12**], when she had a cold with dry
cough, fevers and chills, all improved by [**12-18**]. After a few
days, pt had vomiting, abdominal pain, and fatigue increasing
for about a week until [**12-28**], when the pt went to [**Hospital1 3793**] for the above symptoms. She was found to have an
enlarged spleen and thrombocytopenia. Bone marrow biopsy was
suggestive of pre-B ALL. She was discharged [**12-30**] in stable
condition and followed up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**] in clinic [**1-5**],
and felt the biopsy should be repeated here to confirm the
diagnosis and possibly begin treatment if positive for ALL.
.
The patient was admitted on [**2113-1-6**] for diagnosis and initiation
of treatment. Bone marrow biopsy was performed on admission and
interpreted as markedly hypercellular bone marrow with
involvement by Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, Precursor
B-phenotype. Cytogenetics were negative for [**Location (un) 5622**]
chromosome. A central line was placed, an trans-thoracic ECHO
was performed on admission. Her ECHO revealed cardiac function
within normal limits. Subsequently, induction chemotherapy with
Hyper-CVAD was initiated on [**2113-1-7**]. Her course was complicated
by febrile neutropenia with blood cultures showing
vancomycin-sensitive enterococcus. Her right subclavian line was
removed on [**1-20**]. Screening blood cultures were subsequently all
negative after initiation of vancomycin. A TTE was negative for
endocarditis. On [**2113-2-3**], the patient received 12 mg of
intrathecal methotrexate at 15 mg and intrathecal hydrocortisone
and part B hyper CVAD.

Social History:
Unmarried, lives with her mother (85) and brother (64). Retired
clerk for insurance company. Rare EtOH use, no smoking, no IVDU.


Family History:

report. Father with diabetes.

Physical Exam:
.
98.0, 127/67, RR = 20, HR =80. 96% on 4L, 18,
GENERAL: Overweight caucasian female appearing well, though
slightly tachypneic, resting comfortably in bed.
HEENT: Anicteric sclerae, moist mucous membranes.
NECK: No JVD.
COR: nml S1, S2, 2/6 SEM at LUSB. tachycardic
LUNGS: Dry inspiratory crackles to 2/3 up from the bases.
ABDOMEN: Normoactive bowel sounds, soft, non-tender.
EXTR: No edema. 2+ DP pulses b/l
.


Pertinent Results:
.
CXR [**2113-2-19**]: Worsening appearance of the chest with an appearance
which is suggestive of developing fluid overload or edema.
.
Chest CT with contrast [**2113-2-18**]
When compared with the prior study from [**2113-1-24**], new
small bilateral parenchymal opacities are noted associated with
ground glass opacities and septal thickening. These are present
bilaterally.
.
Echo [**2113-1-25**]
Left Atrium 4.0 cm x 4.5 cm, right atrium 4.6 cm, LV thickness =
1.3 cm, Ejection Fraction = 70% to 80%, nml TRTR Gradient (+ RA
= PASP): 19 to 21 mm Hg (nl <= 25 mm Hg) Conclusions: The left
atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and hyperdynamic
systolic function (LVEF>70-80%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The slightly increased transaortic
gradient is likely related to high cardiac output. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen
on the mitral valve. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic
valve. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
.
58 year old female with hypothyroidism, HTN, history of
vancomycin sensitive enterococcus, and ALL (Precursor
B-phenotype, [**Location (un) 5622**] chromosome negative) who was admitted
for febrile neutropenia.  She was then transferred to the ICU
with hypoxia and febrile neutropenia.
.
# Respiratory Distress: The patient was on room air on admission
but on her second hospital day as her ANC rose to > 500, she was
found to have a new oxygen requirement with desaturation to 89%
on room air.  A chest CT showed new bilateral parenchymal
pulmonary opacities consistent with an infectious process.  No
PE was seen on the CT chest.  The patient's oxygen requirement
worsened and she was transferred to the ICU for further
monitoring.  The patient was on Cefepime, Vanc and Caspo.  On
transfer to the ICU, Levofloxacin was added for double coverage
of gram negatives.  She was also started on IV Bactrim with
steroids for possible PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**].  An induced sputum showed
gram negative rods but these were consistent with mouth flora
per the microbiology lab.  She did not require intubation.  Upon
transfer back to the BMT floor, a repeat CT scan showed
worsened, extensive bilateral ground glass opacities sparing the
lower lobes which appeared to be consistent with an infectious
process.  A B-glucan was found to be positive at > 500.   Her
Levofloxacin was discontinued and her Cefepime was changed to
Ceftriaxone.  The patient was continued on Bactrim and steroids
for presumed PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**].  Her oxygen requirement decreased
steadily until she was back on room air.  Her Vancom
