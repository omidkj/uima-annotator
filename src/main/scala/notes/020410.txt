Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Aortic valve replacement (19mm [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Porcine), Coronary artery
bypass grafting times three


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 12409**] is a 82 year old female with known aortic stenosis.
After she underwent a cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital 3278**] Medical
Center on [**8-8**] which showed multi-vessel coronary artery
disease, she was deemed not to be a good
surgical candidate due to heavily calcified aorta.  Therefore,
she was discharged home with medical management. Shortly after
being home she developed worsening shortness of breath and was
admitted to [**Hospital3 **] on [**8-14**].  She was referred from
there to the [**Hospital1 18**] cardiac surgery service for consideration of
an aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting.

Past Medical History:
Congestive heart failure related to severe aortic stenosis,
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, reflux, transitory ischemic
attacks, osteoarthritis, carotid stenosis, hyperlipidemia,
hammer toes right foot, callus right foot, right hip replacement
times two, left hip replacement, right knee replacement,
hysterectomy, appendectomy, tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy

Social History:
Ms. [**Known lastname 12409**] lives independently at home in [**Hospital1 2436**] after
husband died in [**11-30**].
She denies a smoking history and any alcohol or illicit drug
use.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus in the LA/LAA or the RA/RAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. PFO is present.
Left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum at rest.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter.
Simple atheroma in ascending aorta. Focal calcifications in
ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch diameter. Simple atheroma in
aortic arch. Focal calcifications in aortic arch. Normal
descending aorta diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Severely thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets.
Critical AS (area <0.8cm2). Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. No
MVP. Moderate mitral annular calcification. Moderate thickening
of mitral valve chordae. Moderate to severe (3+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient. See Conclusions for post-bypass data

Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left
atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. A patent foramen ovale is present. A left-to-right
shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are focal
calcifications in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There
is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate thickening of the
mitral valve chordae. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results before
surgical incision..

POST-BYPASS:

Normal RV systolic function.
LVEF 55%.
Stable prosthesis in the native aortic position, no perivalvular
leaks and a mean gradient of 15 mm of Hg across the aortic
valve.

Intact thoracic aorta


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 12409**] was admitted on [**2174-8-15**] for a pre-operative work-up.
She was diuresed with lasix.  She was newly diagnosed as
diabetic and given diabetic teaching.  She was cleared for
surgery by the dentistry service.  She was treated for a urinary
tract infection with ciprofloxacin.  On [**2174-8-22**] she underwent an
aortic valve replacement (19mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] porcine), coronary
artery bypass grafting times three (left internal mammary to
left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to diagonal and
obtuse marginal), performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Please see the
operative note for details.  She tolerated the procedure well
and was transferred in critical but stable condition to the
intensive care unit. By the following day she was extubated
