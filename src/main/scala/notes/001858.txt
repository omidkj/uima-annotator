Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Amoxicillin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2751**]
Chief Complaint:
Low Hct


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo M with Hx of Autoimmune hemolytic anemia and GI bleeds,
CAD, CKD, Mechanical Aortic valve on coumadin with recent
admission to [**Hospital1 18**] for anemia felt to be secondary to GI bleed
([**Date range (1) 66606**]), who was sent to the ED from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab for
persistently low Hct.  Per the patient, he has been in his usual
state of health and has not experienced any dizziness, syncope,
CP, SOB or other symptoms in the last several days, but has felt
generally tired.  His NH has been closely monitoring his Hct,
which has been low but stable for the past several days.  He
received 2 units prbcs at rehab on [**4-18**] for Hct 22, and did not
have an adequate response (Hct [**4-23**] was 23.8 and [**4-25**] was 22.3
with INR 2.2).  Patient was also reportedly noted to have a
small amount of BRBPR yesterday, but he states he never saw the
blood.
.
Of note, the patient has had extensive workup in the past for GI
bleed(EGD x4, [**Last Name (un) **] x2, capsule x3, CT abd/pelvis, bleeding scan)
without clear source or site, and felt to be most likely
bleeding from an UGI source that is not possible to reach
endoscopically.  On prior admissions, further invasive testing
was discussed, and the patient and HCP opted for more
conservative measures including transfusions and iron
supplementation.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 97.0 86 95/51 14 97% RA, pain 0/10.
Labs were significant for Hct 20.5 (down from 22.3 at NH), INR
3.0.  He was found to have black guaiac positive stool.  No NG
lavage was performed given patient's stability and multiple
prior similar presentations.  Patient was given a protonix bolus
and started on a drip.  He was typed and crossed 2 units but did
not receive any blood prior to transfer.  He was admitted to the
ICU for further management.
.
On the floor, patient reports feeling generally tired and
thirstly, but otherwise well.  Specifically denies dizziness,
chest pain, SOB, palpitations or other symptoms currently.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI, also reports several days of burning with
urination.  Incontinent of urine and stool at baseline.  Also
reports left arm pain when his arm "gets cold," which is
responsive to tylenol and has been present for several weeks.
Does not walk or move much at baseline.
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain,
or changes in bowel habits.  Denies arthralgias or myalgias.
Denies rashes or skin changes.

CARDIAC ECHO [**2160-4-29**]:
Poor image quality. The left atrium is moderately dilated. The
right atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably
mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %) with a suggesiton of more
prominent inferior hypokinesis (difficult to assess due to poor
image quality). There is no ventricular septal defect. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. A mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal
leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**2-3**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2159-1-30**],
no definite change.
