Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation [**2132-3-26**]

History of Present Illness:
64yo F increasing SOB x several days.  No associated leg
swelling. Pt denies fevers or chills.  Story limited given
tachypnea.

Per husband, for the past few weeks patient has been having
increasing dyspnea without releif of albuterol inhaler.  No
fevers/ chills/ leg swelling.  Patient has not had trouble
laying flat, just that has had increasing shortness of breath at
night.  Also unclear if patient has had dietary indiscresions.
Of note, patient has changed medications recently, stoping
torsemide 40mg qd and metoprolol 50mg qd, although per husband,
patient states that this is not like her normal heart failure.

In the ED inital vitals were only an O2 saturation of 72%.
Pt was given methylprednisolone 125mg IV, ipratropium,
albuterol, azithromycin 500mg IV.
- patient was placed on nonrebreather --> weaned to NC6L -->
felt was retaining CO2, so started on non-invasive ventilation
--> satting 94%, but patient did not tolerate, then intubation
with pressures in the 50/70s.  Patient got 1500cc of NS in the
ED.
-2x18s, RIJ placed, started on dopamine

Etomidate + succinylcholine, uncomplicated intubation --> SBP
70s.
Sedation with fentanyl and midazolam.
Vitals on transfer: afebrile 94 91/58 14 89% on vent Tv350 Fi02
50% PEEP 5.

On arrival to the ICU, patient is heavily seadated.

IMAGING:
[**3-26**] CXR (PORTABLE AP) #1
FINDINGS: AP upright portable chest radiograph obtained. A
dual-lead AICD
projects over the left chest wall with lead tips extending into
the right
atrium and right ventricle as well as the tips extending along
the epicardium at the level of the left atrium. There is mild
pulmonary interstitial edema with cardiomegaly. No large pleural
effusion is seen. No pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly with interstitial edema.
.
[**3-26**] CXR (PORTABLE AP) #2
FINDINGS: AP supine portable chest radiograph obtained. Interval
placement
of an endotracheal tube which is seen with its tip approximately
2.7 cm above the carina. There has also been placement of an
orogastric tube with its tip coiled in the left upper abdomen.
There is increased opacity in the upper lungs bilaterally, right
greater than left, which given the interval change could reflect
aspiration. Cardiomegaly is unchanged. AICD is also unchanged.
IMPRESSION: ET and OG tubes positioned appropriately. Increased
opacities in the upper lungs, right greater than left, question
aspiration
.
[**3-26**] CXR - LINE PLACEMENT
FINDINGS: AP supine portable chest radiograph obtained. The
endotracheal
tube is again seen positioned approximately 3 cm above the
carina. An NG tube is coiled in the left upper abdomen.
Consolidation is again noted in the bilateral upper lungs, right
greater than left. The heart remains markedly enlarged. A right
IJ central venous catheter tip resides in the distal superior
vena cava. No pneumothorax is seen. AICD position is unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Appropriately positioned right IJ central venous
catheter, ET and OG tubes. Bilateral upper lung consolidation,
right greater than left.
.
CXR [**3-27**]
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the position
of the
endotracheal tube, the nasogastric tube, the pacemaker wires and
the right
central venous access line are unchanged. The previously seen
right upper
lobe predominant opacities are minimally decreased. This could
be defect of increased ventilatory pressure. The size of the
cardiac silhouette is
unchanged. No parenchymal opacities have newly appeared.
Currently, there is no evidence of pulmonary edema.
.
CXR [**3-31**]
FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The heart is enlarged. A left-sided
cardiac
generator pack projects leads into the right atrium and
ventricle. Since
[**2132-3-30**], the patient has been extubated an
