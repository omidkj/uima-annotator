Admission Date:  [**2102-11-6**]       Discharge Date:  [**2102-11-25**]


Service:  ORTHOPEDIC

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 89 year old female
with a past medical history significant for dementia, end
stage renal disease on hemodialysis, coronary artery disease,
congestive heart failure, baseline dementia, hypertension,
and recurrent Staphylococcus line infections, who presented
on [**2102-11-6**], for a left hip wound infection following an open
reduction and internal fixation of an intertrochanteric hip
fracture suffered [**2102-10-10**].  The patient was being cared for
at the [**Hospital6 310**] where it was noted she
had some foul smelling odor and discharge coming from the
site of the dressing.  The wound was deemed to be infected.
The patient denied any systemic symptoms of fever, chills,
sweats, nausea or vomiting.  She did, however, have increased
pain and subsequently was admitted to the Orthopedic service
for incision and drainage of her infected hip.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

oxygen saturation 98% in room air.  She is described as a
pleasant in no apparent distress female.  The lungs were
clear to auscultation with bilateral basilar crackles.
Cardiovascular is regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2,
II/VI systolic ejection murmur was heard.  The abdomen was
soft, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities - Left proximal
quad described as approximate 5.0 centimeter surgical
incision with 7.0 by 3.0 centimeter necrotic area with
purulent discharge, tender, no surrounding erythema.

LABORATORY DATA:  Pending.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In brief, this is an 89 year old female
with a history of end stage renal disease on hemodialysis,
hypertension, congestive heart failure, coronary artery
disease, admitted in [**2102-8-18**], for change in mental
status, presumed to be due to a line infection, who suffered
a left hip fracture followed by open reduction and internal
fixation during her hospital stay at [**Hospital1 190**].  She was discharged to [**Hospital6 7068**] when she was noticed to have a left hip
infection and readmitted to the Orthopedic service on
[**2102-11-6**].  An incision and drainage was performed showing no
evidence of osteomyelitis or deep tissue infection,
subsequently growing out E. coli and proteus which was
sensitive to Levaquin.  The patient's postoperative course
was complicated by sepsis.  She was maintained on pressors.
She was intubated.  She was initially started on broad
spectrum antibiotics.  She was anemic requiring four units of
blood.  She was finally extubated off pressors and initiated
on Levaquin when sensitivities were identified.  She was
subsequently transferred to the Medical service on [**2102-11-12**],
when she experienced an episode of chest pain with a question
of dynamic electrocardiographic changes associated in the
lateral leads, however, relieved by Nitroglycerin.  The
patient was doing well with management of her medical
problems until the weekend of [**2102-11-16**]/10/31/03, when it was
noticed that her left hip wound appeared necrotic, boggy with
purulent drainage coming from the old suture line.
Consequently, the patient remained in house and was seen by
Orthopedics and Plastic service and treated again for
recurrent wound infection of her left hip.

1.  Left hip wound infection - The patient was originally
admitted [**2102-11-6**], with a suspected wound infection and
incision and drainage was performed.  The patient grew out E.
coli and proteus as the presumed pathogenic organisms with a
question of whether there was also Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus in the wound versus just in the swab.
The patient was treated with Levaquin once sensitivities were
identified.  Most recent wound infection shows that there are
no gram negative or aerobic organisms in her wound.
Unfortunately prior to her discharge, she became reinfected
approximately around [**2102-11-17**], and a second incision and
drainage of her hip was performed on [**2102-11-21**].  The wound
debridement was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of the Plastic
Surgery service.  Swabs and tissue cultures yielded the
following organisms:  3+ gram cocci in pairs, 1+ in clusters,
moderate growth of Staphylococcus, Oxacillin resistant
Enterococcus sensitive to Vancomycin.  There is also a second
Enterococcus species which is pending and will be updated at
the early part of next week.  Consequently, the current wound
management plan is to continue with Vancomycin dosed by
levels less than 15 at hemodialysis and to continue a two
week course of Levaquin as suggested by the infectious
disease service.   She also has a vacuum dressing in place
that will require q4-5day changes with VNA services.  She
will need to follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 28431**] in
approximately two weeks following discharge for continued
management of her wound.

2.  End stage renal disease on hemodialysis - The patient was
treated repeatedly for her chronic end stage renal disease
with hemodialysis Tuesday, Thursday, Friday.  She was seen by
the Renal service.  She will continue to have hemodialysis on
discharge.

3.  Change in mental status - The patient has baseline of
mild dementia intermittently with delirium when she becomes
infected or has excess narcotics or benzodiazepines.  Head CT
during this admission was negative for any acute bleeding or
hemorrhage, however, was positive for chronic microinfarcts.
At the time of discharge, she was alert and oriented and
doing well.  Suggestion is to minimize narcotics and
benzodiazepines to prevent further cases of delirium.

4.  Right pleural effusion - The patient has a persistent
right sided pleural effusion which shows mild improvement
with dialysis.  This effusion was not tapped.  She has no
evidence of aspiration.  She repeatedly passed swallow
studies.  She was asymptomatic and no further analysis was
done at this time.

5.  Coronary artery disease/chest pain - The patient had
dynamic electrocardiographic changes with flat CKs in the
setting of chronically elevated troponin in the setting of
renal failure.  Changes were resolved with Nitroglycerin. She
has a history of gastrointestinal bleed and thrombocytopenia.
No Heparin or Lovenox was given.  She was medically managed
initially with Lopressor and Isordil.  Isordil was
discontinued due to hypotension, however, Lopressor will be
continued at 12.5 mg twice a day and titrate up according to
pressure as tolerated.

6.  Thrombocytopenia - During hospitalization, the patient
was thrombocytopenic.  This was initially thought to be
related to sepsis.  Eventually the patient was found to be
HIT positive.  Consequently, please avoid all hyperimplantics
and  please avoid Heparin during dialysis.

7.  Anemia - The patient had a history of anemia requiring
multiple blood transfusions during her stay.  Hematocrit was
stable on discharge.  She is chronically anemia, however, in
the setting of renal disease, this is probable.

8.  Sepsis - During her hospital stay, the patient was
septic.  On discharge, there was no evidence of sepsis.  She
became septic following her initial wound infection which was
complicated by E. coli and proteus.  She stayed in the
Intensive Care Unit.  She was intu
