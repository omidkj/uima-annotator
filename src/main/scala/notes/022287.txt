RADIOLOGY  Final Report
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2137-5-5**] 1:40 PM
CHEST (PA & LAT)
Reason: increase in pleural effussion / progression of pnuemonia
/ p
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
77 year old man with
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
increase in pleural effussion / progression of pnuemonia / pt
requiring 4 l oxygen
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of pleural effusion.
PA and lateral upright chest radiograph was compared to [**2137-5-4**].
The patient is after median sternotomy and CABG. The appearance
of the heart and the mediastinum is unchanged during the short
time interval. There is also no significant change in the
moderate left pleural effusion and small right pleural effusion.
There is no evidence of failure. The lungs are hyperinflated
most likely due to underlying emphysema.

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW  [**2137-5-1**] 2:46 PM
VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW
Reason: ?aspiration
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
77 year old man with s/p CABG x4
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
?aspiration
VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW:
INDICATION: 77-year-old man with four-vessel CABG, concern for
aspiration.
COMPARISON: Reports from [**4-18**] and [**2137-4-22**].
FINDINGS: Video oropharyngeal swallow was performed with various
consistencies of barium administered to the patient under video
fluoroscopic imaging in conjunction with the speech pathologist.
There is normal bolus formation, AP tongue movement, and oral
transit time. There was mild impairment of bolus control as well
as some oral cavity residue. There is mild impairment of swallow
initiation and laryngeal valve closure. The velar and laryngeal
elevation was normal.
Pharyngeal transit time was normal without any residue. There
was penetration with thin liquids and a tiny amount of trace
aspiration without spontaneous cough. This improved with the
chin tuck for thin liquids.

IMPRESSION: Mild impairments of oral and pharyngeal phases with
some penetration and tiny trace aspiration. Per report, this is
improved from priors.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the cardiac surgery ICU, and a left chest
tube was initially for 1 liter of seroanguinous fluid. He was
diuresed. He was transferred to the floor on HD #3. He was
reevaluated by speech and swallow and his diet remained as
nectar thick liquids and pureed solids. HD#4 CT was discontinued
with minimal drainage,pulmonary hygiene, diuresis continued.
Vanco started prophylactically while sputum culture resulted.The
culture revealed normal oral flora, 1 colony of mold. ID felt
