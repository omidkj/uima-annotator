Pertinent Results:
CT without contrast OSH [**4-20**] - diffuse SAH with basal and
mesencephalic cisterns and along the skull base.  There is mild
blood in the left posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**].  There is a bilateral
intraventricular mass with calcified portion on the left.  There
is evidence of hydrocephalus with temporal horns are prominent.

Head CT-angiogram [**2196-4-20**] - 1. CT Head: SAH in the suprasellar,
perimesencephalic cisterns (R> L) and sylvian fissures.
Intraventricular hemorrhage in both occipital horns and the
fourth ventricle. Diffuse cerebral edema, with effacement of the
sulci. Hyperdense intraventricular mass with calcifications
occupying the body of both lateral ventricles. Dilation of the
occipital and temporal horns of both
lateral ventricles.
2. CTA Head: Large intraventricular AVM with the nidus in the
body of the left lateral ventricle, with dilated venous varix in
the body of the right lateral ventricle. Arterial feeders to the
AVM from a dilated left ACA and from the left MCA. Large vein
drains into the straight sinus.
3. Basilar tip aneurysm [**Last Name (un) **] 6 x 5 mm, directed superiorly and
to the right. Fusiform aneurysm at the ACOM / R ACA junction
measuring 8 x 5 mm. A third fusiform aneurysm in the left A3
segment [**Last Name (un) **] 4mm. 3 D recons pending at this time.

Echo [**4-20**] - Small LV cavity size with hyperdynamic LV systolic
function. Consequently there is a mild left ventricular outflow
tract gradient during systole. No pathologic valvular
abnormality seen.  EF >75%

[**4-21**] ANGIOGRAM******

[**2196-4-24**] ECHOCARDIOGRAM
Conclusions
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is small. Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal. No left ventricular apical aneurysm is seen
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
no pericardial effusion.
Conclusions: Focused study for LV assessment : Hyperdynamic LV
function. Not different from the previous study ([**2196-4-20**])

[**2196-4-26**] FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH
The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Wide-spread
parenchymal opacity has mildly increased in extent. No pleural
effusions or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Mild worsening of bilateral parenchymal opacities

CTA head [**2196-4-26**]
1. No evidence of flow-limiting stenosis or occlusion within the
anterior or posterior intracranial circulations. No evidence of
acute large vascular territorial infarction.
2. Interval resorption of the majority of the previously seen
subarachnoid
hemorrhage overlying the cerebral hemispheres and collecting in
the basal
cisterns. The degree of intraventricular hemorrhage layering in
the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles is not
significantly changed.
4. Unchanged appearance of the large intraventricular AVM,
fusiform
aneurysmal dilatation of the ACOM, and fusiform aneurysmal
dilatation of the A2 segment of the left ACA.

Chest X-ray [**2196-4-27**]
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. Unchanged course and position of the right PICC line. No
newly
appeared focal parenchymal opacities. The known bilateral apical
parenchymal opacities are unchanged in extent and severity.
Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly. No pleural effusions. No
pneumothorax. No overt pulmonary edema. Moderate tortuosity of
the thoracic aorta.

Chest X-ray [**2196-4-29**]
Previous moderately severe pulmonary edema has largely resolved.
The residual consolidation in the axillary region of the right
upper lobe, a relatively constant feature throughout may well be
concurrent pneumonia, also improving.  Heart is normal size.
Thoracic aorta is generally large but not focally aneurysmal,
and pleural effusion is minimal if any. No pneumothorax. Right
PIC catheter ends in the upper right atrium approximately 2.5 cm
below the anticipated location of superior cavoatrial junction.
No pneumothorax.

BLE LENIS [**2196-4-29**]
IMPRESSION: No DVT in the right or left lower extremity.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname 652**] was admitted to neurosurgery ICU on [**2196-4-20**]
for further management.  A CT-Angiogram revealed multiple
aneuryms and a large intraventricular Arteriovenous malformation
with feeders from L MCA/ACA with drainage into straight sinus.
Subsequently, he was taken for a cerebral angiogram on [**4-21**] and
had a basilar tip aneurysm coiled. Although imaging may have
seen multiple aneurysm, the angio only identified this.
Post-angio he did well. On [**4-22**], he was having some trouble with
his respiratory status and a CXR showed pulmonary edema. He was
given Lasix. He was advanced to a regular diet, IVF were
heplocked for good PO intake, and he was OOB to chair.

[**Date range (1) 5833**] Patient remained neurologically stable was found to be
in Neurogenic pulmonary edema, he was started on/off on a lasix
