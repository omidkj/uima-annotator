History of Present Illness:
69 y.o. Female with a h.o. depression, anxiety, HL, metastatic
cancer (unknown primary), hilar mass who presented to the ED
with severe back pain s/p radiation.
.
Upon discussion with the patient and review of Atrius records it
appears she has been experiencing severe back pain since [**Month (only) 958**].
At that time, she was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 28549**] for her back pain and
then referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] who ordered a MRI spine on [**4-7**]
which showed diffusely abnormal signal of the L1 vertebra,
discrete lesion in T12. The L1 deformity was specifically
compression deformity of the superior endplate of L1 thought to
be pathologic as opposed to osteoporotic. She was referred to
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (Orthopaedics) and underwent a bone scan on [**4-7**]
which showed abnormal tracer in T8, T9, L1. An MRI of her spine,
CT of chest, abdomen, pelvis on [**4-23**] showed 2cm mass in the
right hilum associated with small rt hilar LN and enlarged rt
paratraceal LN measuring 9.8mm and 12.7mm. Pulmonary nodule at
the superior segment of RLL measuring 2.8mm as well as 3.1mm RUL
nodule. Lytic lesion was also noted at L1, T12. She re-presented
to her oncologist on [**5-1**] for continuous severe back pain. She
was prescribed Oxycodone, Acetaminophen and was referred for
bone biopsy and XRT. Pt underwent XRT (second session) yesterday
and had a progression in her severe back pain and was referred
to the ED.
.
In the ED initial VS were noted to be T98.4, HR 102, BP 144/71,
RR 18, Sat 96% on RA. Her labs were unremarkable aside from
anemia of 33.2, WBC was 7.9. She received Dexamethasone 10mg x
1, IV Morphine Sulfate 4mg x 2. A CT Pelvis was ordered which
showed no fracture; L5 vertebral body lytic lesion.
.

EKG: Sinus tachycardia. Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave changes.

.
CT pelvis ortho without contrast:
1. No evidence of fracture.
2. L5 vertebral body lytic lesion disrupting the cortex
concerning for a
metastatic lesion. No prior CT study for comparison. Consider
outpatient MRI of the lumbar spine for further characterization
.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] with and without contrast:
Pathologic compression fracture of L1 vertebra with retropulsion

and severe spinal stenosis and mild epidural and paraspinal soft
tissue
enhancement indicative of epidural and paraspinal metastatic
disease. Severe compression of the cauda equina and probable
compression of the tip of the conus is identified without
abnormal signal in the distal spinal cord. The compression
fracture is new since the previous MRI of [**2131-4-7**]. Small foci
of metastases are seen in T12 and L2 vertebral bodies.
.
CXR: Right hilar and lower paratracheal adenopathy, small right
effusion and elevated right hemidiaphragm are evident on this
conventional bedside
radiograph taken with the patient supine. The left lung is
clear. Heart size is normal. I discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 86072**] that
the reference chest CT shows extensive bilateral pulmonary
emboli as well as the findings suggesting widespread malignancy.

.
CT T and L spine: 1. No acute fracture or abnormal alignment
identified.
2. Right hilar lesion, right pleural effusion and
lymphadenopathy better
evaluated on contrast-enhanced CT of the chest dated [**2131-5-4**].
3. Lytic lesion in T12 vertebral body concerning for metastatic
disease.
.
MR brain for cyberknife planning: Unchanged 11-mm enhancing mass
within the right cerebellar hemisphere may represent a
metastatic lesion in this patient with known lung cancer with no
additional intracranial metastatic lesions identified.




Brief Hospital Course:
69 year old woman with depression/anxiety, hyperlipidemia and
hypertension who presents with severe back pain after radiation
therapy for metastatic malignancy, likely of lung origin given
hilar mass. Was found to have cauda equina syndrome and
underwent emergent spinal fusion/laminectomy on Thursday, [**5-16**]. After patient was taken to the OR for cauda equina syndrome
and underwent T11-L3 fusion with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1007**], she was sent
to the surgical ICU for close moni
