Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**]
Chief Complaint:
Ataxia, Diplopia, Vomiting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 76 year old right handed woman with a history
of atrial fibrillation not on Coumadin due to noncompliance,
history of prior stroke in left PCA and right MCA territories,
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and CHF who presents with
dysarthria, dysphagia, vertical diplopia, feeling imbalanced,
left arm/leg weakness, and vomiting. The history is obtained
from her daughter, who also provided [**Name (NI) 8003**] interpretation.

The patient's daughter was with her from 9:00-11:30 am today,
when her daughter dropped her off at her house at 11:30 am. The
patient may have been slightly more tired than usual, but no
other deficits were noticed. EMS was called to the patient's
house at 5:00 pm (when she presumably activated her emergency
button), and they found her crawling on the floor, "couldn't
move", dysarthric, and started vomiting. She was initially taken
to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**], where her bp on admission was 111/98 but peaked
at 205/85. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] staff, found her to have left pronator
drift, left arm ataxia, and dysarthria. Her NIHSS was 3 at that
time. Head CT showed hypodensities in the left PCA, right
superior MCA, and putamen territories consistent with old
infarcts. Labs showed WBC 11.2. She was given Zofran 4 mg IV x2
and Phenergan 12.5 mg IV x2 for nausea/vomiting. Given the
clinical concern for a new cerebellar infarct, she was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

Her daughter first saw her at [**Hospital1 18**], where she found her to be
mumbling with dysarthria. She reportedly knows what she wants to
say, but it was not coming out correctly. She complained of
vertical diplopia, dysarthria, and dysphagia. She feels like she
is swaying from side to side, but denies vertigo. She feels as
though her left arm and leg are weak, and she reports numbness
described as pins and needles in her left leg. She has a right
frontal headache, but is confused and unable to rate it on a
scale from [**12-1**]. She currently denies nausea. Per her daughter
(who is translating), she is not always making sense when
answering questions. She has denied fevers.

CTA head/neck and CTP were attempted in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED; however,
the patient could not tolerate this due to a mix of anxiety and
orthopnea.


Past Medical History:
CAD s/p MI [**2182**]
Atrial fibrillation, not on Coumadin since [**8-29**] given
noncompliance/didn't like PT checks
h/o stroke [**2177**] (her daughter and the patient do not know what

superor MCA infarcts
CHF, EF 55-60% in [**12-31**]
Hypertension
Hypercholesterolemia
Pulmonary hypertension
Asthma
Allergic rhinitis
GERD


Social History:
The patient lives alone in senior housing, but
lives 2 blocks away from her daughter. She moved here from
[**Male First Name (un) 36290**] 2 years ago.
HABITS:
She has never smoked, does not drink EtOH, or
use illicit drugs.


Family History:
There is family history of hypertension and
asthma.

IMAGING:
.
CT Head without Contrast ([**2193-9-23**]):
FINDINGS: Hypodensity is redemonstrated in a leftPCA
distribution as well as at the right MCA and also in the
putamen, consistent with encephalomalacia from previous
infarction. No evidence of new vascular territorial infarction,
intracranial hemorrhage, edema, or mass effect. The ventricles
and sulci are normal in size and configuration. Trace
calcifications are present bilaterally at the basal ganglia. The
included paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are
unremarkable.
.
IMPRESSION: Encephalomalacia as a sequela of remote infarction,
unchanged
from the comparison study done earlier on the same day.
.
CT/A Head, Neck ([**2193-9-24**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Encephalomalacia as a sequela of remote infarction (left PCA,
right MCA, and putamen distribution regions), overall unchanged
when compared to prior studies.
2. Aortic arch calcification. Overall no stenosis or aneurysm
formation.
3. Small punctate calcifications at the bifurcation of carotid
arteries
without significant stenosis, otherwise unremarkable
intracranial and cervical
vessels.
.
Chest X-ray ([**2193-9-23**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Suboptimal study due to patient motion, particularly in the
right
mid-to-lower lung fields. Because of this, an ill-defined
opacity is seen,
and right base consolidation/atelectasis and small effusion
cannot be
excluded.
2. Cardiomegaly.
.
Transthoracic Echocardiogram:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No obvious atrial septal defect or patent
foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast
with maneuvers (however, all images suboptimal). Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF 70%). The right ventricular
cavity is dilated with normal free wall contractility. The
number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic
valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. No obvious intracardiac
shunt (but cannot be excluded with certainty on the basis of
this study); mild aortic stenosis.
