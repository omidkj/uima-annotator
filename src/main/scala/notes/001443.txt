Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2160**]
Chief Complaint:
 Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 53693**] is a [**Age over 90 **] F with h/o aflutter, HTN, CVA who
presented to ER initially with dyspnea, LE edema and was found
to have elevated JVD, Atach vs aflutter, CXR c/w CHF. She
started having dyspnea on exetrtion 7 days prior to admission
with a nonprod cough, without CP. When she arrived to the ED,
her BP was 208/110, HR 122, T 98.2, RR 30, Sat 90% on RA. She
received Aspirin 325mg, Acetaminophen 650mg, Furosemide 40mg x
2, Nitroglycerin gtt, Metoprolol 5mg x 3, Lorazepam 2mg. While
in the ER she vomited into her face mask and had an acute
worsening of her respiratory distress at which time repeat CXR
showed bibasilar opacities consistent with aspiration and
possible worsening edema. She then received Vancomycin 1g,
Piperacillin-Tazobactam Na 2.25 gm. Discussion at that time with
her family and PCP resulted in decision to make pt DNR/DNI/CMO
and start a morphine drip for relief of respiratory distress or
discomfort. The plan was to admit her to Medicine for further
supportive comfort care. However, while in the ED her resp
status seemed to improve, and the family requested to treat her
conservatively for her pneumonia/CHF. She is to remain DNR/DNI
per family, but to receive appropriate antibiotics and diuresis.
Of note, while on the morphine gtt her BP dropped to 83/30. She
had a lactate of 2.3. Her morphine gtt was decreased and her BP
rose to 99/39, then back 86/50 (MAP 62) before transport to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. The ED staff spoke with her family about pressors/central
line, and they said that would be OK if necessary to keep her
alive.

   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2106-7-9**]):    NO GROWTH.

CXR - IMPRESSION: Marked improvement of previously identified
congestive pattern and parenchymal infiltrates in this elderly
patient. Comparison with the study of [**2106-7-7**] demonstrates
now also improvement of the initially seen fluffy infiltrates on
the right base.

Non-contrast head CT.

COMPARISON: [**2105-11-23**].

FINDINGS: There is no evidence of new infarction or hemorrhage.
There is no mass effect or shift of midline structures. The
ventricles, cisterns, and sulci are enlarged secondary to
involutional change. Marked periventricular white matter
hypodensities are unchanged, and old bilateral basal ganglia
infarcts are again noted. The visualized paranasal sinuses are
aerated, and no fractures are identified.

IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of the brain without intracranial
hemorrhage

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2106-7-9**]  6:48:26 PM


Atrial fibrillation. Right bundle-branch block with left
anterior fascicular
block. Diffuse ST segment changes could be secondary to
myocardial ischemia or
rapid ventricular rate. Compared to prior tracing of [**2106-7-9**] no

diagnostic change.
