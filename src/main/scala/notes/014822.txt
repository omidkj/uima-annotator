[**2113-1-31**] - Cardiac Catheterization

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 65-year-old gentleman who approximately a year
ago underwent four-vessel coronary bypass grafting and aortic
valve replacement with a St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical prosthesis at
[**Hospital3 45967**] in [**Doctor Last Name 792**]by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 27598**]. The patient
did well for many months but was noted to have fevers, chills
and was diagnosed with staph epidermidis prosthetic aortic valve
endocarditis with acute vegetation below the aortic valve and
partial dehiscence of the valve, as well as severe mitral
regurgitation and involvement of the mitral valve with aortic
root abscess. Cardiac cath here demonstrated that all of his
vein grafts were totally occluded and his mammary to LAD
anastomosis had a 60%stenosis within it. The patient was
admitted for preoperative work-up and management for possible
redo cardiac surgery.

Past Medical History:
1. Hodgkin lymphoma (L preauricular per pt) - S/P XRT and
splenectomy in [**2080**]
2. Thyroid cancer - S/P thyroidectomy in [**2102**]
3. Left CEA [**2110**]
4. Hypercholesterolemia
5. PCI RCA [**2110**]
6. CABG/AVR (St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**] metal valve) [**2111**]

Social History:
Married, 2 kids, works at a toy company, occasional EtOH,
quit tobacco in [**2084**].

Family History:
Mom alive at 84 - well; dad died at 80 with prostate cancer;
2 brothers - well.

Pertinent Results:
[**2113-1-30**] ECHO
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed. A mechanical
aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic prosthesis cannot
be fully assessed but a 1cm somewhat mobile echodensity is seen
on the LV side of the prosthesis in the subcostal views
(clip#[**Clip Number (Radiology) **]) c/w a vegetatiaon. The aortic valve gradient was not
assessed. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. No discrete vegetation is seen
(does not exclude). Mild to moderate ([**1-3**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. No discrete
vegetation is seen (does not exclude). There is no pericardial
effusion.

[**2113-1-31**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system with
severe three vessel disease and occluded SVG grafts.  LMCAhad a
mid
vessle 30% stenosis. The LAD had a 50% lesion at S1 and an 80%
lesion at
D2. The dital vessel filled via LIMA. LCX was proximally
occluded and
the distal OM filled via collaterals. RCA was occluded in the
mid-vessel. SVG to RCA, diagonal and OM were all occluded. LIMA
to LAD
was patent but there was a 60% lesion just proximal to the
anastomosis.
2. Aortography showed 3+ AI.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred given endocarditis on the
prosthetic valve.
4. Limited hemodynamic assessment showed normal systemic aortic
pressures.
5.  Fluoroscopy showed excessive motion of the prosthetic aortic
valve.

[**2113-2-1**] Head CTA
1. No acute hemorrhage or mass effect.
2. Mild chronic microvascular infarction, as noted above.
3. No evidence of central or peripheral arterial aneurysms.
Please note that CTA has limited sensitivity for peripheral
mycotic aneurysms, for which conventional angiography may still
be required for detection.
4. No significant arterial stenoses.

[**2113-2-1**] Chest/Abdomen CT
1. Single small solitary pulmonary nodule, for which 12- and
24-month followup CT chest examinations are recommended to
ensure stability and/or resolution, in the absence of known
malignancy.
2. Transvenous pacer wire terminating in the right ventricle.
3. Status post aortic valve replacement.
4. No definite evidence of septic emboli or abscesses. However,
there are small bilateral perfusion defects in the kidneys which
could relate to non- occlusive emboli. A similar appearance can
also be seen in pyelonephritis.
Correlation with urinalysis is recommended.

[**2113-2-3**] Renal Ultrasound
The right kidney measures 12.5 cm and the left kidney 11.2 cm.
Both kidneys are morphologically normal without stones,
hydronephrosis or solid mass. There are normal waveforms in the
right lower, mid, and upper interlobar arteries and main renal
artery. Color Doppler shows uniform perfusion of the right
kidney. Doppler evaluation of the left kidney was not possible
due to the patient's difficulty with breath holding maneuvers.

[**2113-2-3**] Carotid Duplex Ultrasound
Less than 40% right carotid stenosis. No stenosis of the left
carotid.

[**2113-2-27**] LE U/S
1. No DVT on the right. The basilic vein on the right is not
visualized secondary to a PICC line with overlying dressings
which preclude assessment for the basilic vein.
2. Residual left internal jugular vein non-occlusive thrombus.
Patent subclavian, axillary and basilic veins without thrombus.

[**2113-3-6**] Chest X-ray
Right PICC line and permanent pacemaker remain in place. There
has been prior median sternotomy and coronary artery bypass
surgery. Lung volumes are low, accentuating the cardiac
silhouette and bronchovascular structures. There is persistent
interstitial edema. More confluent opacities are again
demonstrated at the lung bases, right greater than left adjacent
to moderate right and small left pleural effusions. Appearance
of the base is slightly worse that could be accentuated by the
lower lung volumes.
