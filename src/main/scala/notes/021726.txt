Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 678**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension, septic shock

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation
central venous line placement

History of Present Illness:
59M with MMP inlcuding CAD s/p MI, chronic systolic CHF (EF
30-35%), DM2 on insulin, HTN, and ESRD on HD, who was brought to
the ED on [**2-3**] after being found lethargic at home by partner.
[**Name (NI) **] his partners report, he had been progressively "sicker" over
the last day, with more general malaise, weakness, and lethargy.
He was dialyzed on Monday and was fine there, but complained of
foot pain. He went out with his son-in-law today, but when he
returned, he felt ill and was too weak to walk back in the house
by himself. Took FSG, was 241. He had N/V x 2. His partner
eventually called EMS for a change in mental status, decreased
responsiveness. On EMS arrival he was noted to hypotensive and
altered. By his partners report, no fevers but + shaking chills
and weak, with diaphoresis. Did complain of being cold and some
SOB but no CP or abdominal pain. Had a new cough productive of
phlegm. Had diarrhea x 1. No sick contacts.
.
In ED, patient arrived in extremis, VS 97.1 88 50/palp 18 100%
NRB. Was immediately intubated for altered mental status and
airway protection. A CVL was placed in the RIJ, and vasopressors
were started (dopamine and levophed). He received 2L IVF, and
dopa was gradually weaned down, but remained on levophed at 0.12
mcg/min. Initial labs revealed venous lactate of 8.2 and
non-hemolyzed K of 6.7. EKG was without peaked T waves, but pt
received calcium and insulin. There were no acute ischemic EKG
changes (has RBBB, old inferior Q waves). 1st set of CE's
revealed flat CKs with baseline elevated troponin. CXR showed ?
development of bilateral early infiltrates. He is anuric so no
urine studies were able to be obtained. Serum tox was negative.
Blood cultures were drawn and he was empirically covered broadly
with vanco/zosyn/flagyl. CT head showed no ICH, and CT abdomen
showed no acute intraabdominal process, but revealed LLL
atelectasis vs PNA. He was then admitted to the ICU.
.
On arrival to the ICU the patient is intubated and sedated. Full
ROS is unable to be obtained at this time

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU COURSE: Patient arrived intubated and sedated with evidence
of severe sepsis. His lactate peaked in the ED of 8.2, and
improved with IV fluids. He had [**Month/Day/Year 13241**] on [**2-4**] and [**2-5**].
On [**2-4**] he was also extubated and weaned off pressores.  On
[**2-5**], he was hypertensive to the 200s. He was restarted on his
oral antihypertensive medications and has been stably in the
120s-130s since.
On [**2-5**], he was noted have melanotic stools. On [**2-6**] he had 300
cc BRBPR. His hematocrits have been stable and his stools have
been brown recently. He continues to have loose stools that were
C.diff negative.
He had evidence of altered mental status in the ICU that was
likely [**2-16**] hypoxemia. He was monitored initially on CIWA scales,
but was not requireing benzodiazepines.
59M with CAD, CHF, DM, ESRD on HD, who presented with severe
sepsis possibly from line infection or pneumonia, called out
from MICU, also with GI bleed.
.
SEPSIS: On presentation, patient had hypotension to 50/palp with
evidence of initial hypoperfusion with lactate in ED of 8.2, but
improved to 5.4 with fluids in ED. Based on time course, patient
most likely became bacteremic in [**Month/Day (2) 13241**]. A primary
pulmonary source is also possible. He has remained afebrile. CXR
with improving pulm edema but no clear evidence of pneumonia.
Endotracheal sputum showed sparse OP flora that was likely a
contaminant.  Following discharge from ICU, patient had normal
oxygen saturation on room  air.   Presuming a skin flora source,
he was treated with Vanc for a 14 day course ([**2-3**] ?????? [**2-17**]).
.
HEART BLOCK: Patient reported 1 hour of sharp left sided chest
pain, improved
