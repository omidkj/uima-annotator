History of Present Illness:
This 44 year old female with a history of pancreatic endocrine
cell tumor, s/p resection of the distal pancreas and spleen in
[**4-22**] c/b recurrent abscesses, chronic abd pain, reflux, and IBS
was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital [**6-23**] (1d pta [**Hospital1 18**]).

Admitted yesterday to [**Hospital3 **] with 10/10 abd pain/vomitting.
Upon arrival to their ED had a seizure (rec'd dilantin) and was
intubated.  CT of head showed nothing acute- but there was some
demyelination. Abd CT also showed nothing acute.  Trop was 2.0,
Ck 200's. Ekg was read at [**Hospital3 **] to show evolving anterior
MI-flipped T's anteriorly, no r waves, slight ST elev ant.  Echo
was read to show anterior septal and apical akinesis.  OG tube
was placed because the patient was vomitting coffee grounds on
the day pta then againg this am at 6am.--hct is stable at 44.

MRI: Multiple hyperintensities are visualized in the subcortical
white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, predominantly
involving the parietal and occipital lobes. No abnormal
enhancement is seen in this region. No evidence of slow
diffusion is identified in these regions. Following gadolinium,
no evidence of abnormal parenchymal, vascular, or meningeal
enhancement identified. There is no evidence of midline shift or
hydrocephalus seen. The ventricles and extraaxial spaces are
normal in size. IMPRESSION: Multiple T2 hyperintensities in the
parietal occipital region including involvement of the corpus
callosum without enhancement or slow diffusion. The appearances
are suggestive of posterior reversible encephalopathy. Clinical
correlation recommended. No abnormal enhancement is seen.

EEG: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the presence of a
slow and disorganized background rhythm in the [**2-25**] Hz delta
frequency
range. This finding suggests deep, midline subcortical
dysfunction and
is consistent with a moderate encephalopathy. The patient was
noted to
be on Propofol at the start of the recording which is a likely
culprit
and, after discontinuation, there was improvement in the degree
of
slowing; however, the slowing did persist. Other causes for
encephalopathy include infection and metabolic derangements. No
lateralizing or epileptiform abnormalities were seen.

ECG: Sinus tachycardia Extensive wave changes may be due to
evolving anterolateral myocardial infarct. Q in V2 and small Q
in leads V3-V6.

CT Abdomen: 1) Thickening in left colon seen from the splenic
flexure through the rectosigmoid. This is only seen where the
bowel is not well distended. Findings could simply be due to
underdistension, but if a true finding, differential diagnosis
includes infection, including C. difficile colitis, ischemia
(although all major mesenteric vessels are patent), or
inflammatory processes. Correllation with C. Difficile toxin
assay is reccommended. 2) Bibasilar atelectasis. 3) No evidence
of intraabdominal abscess.

Cardiac Cath:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Successful stenting of the ostium of the RCA with a Bare
Metal Stent.
4. Mild pulmon
