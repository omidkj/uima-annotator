hemoptysis, which has occurred infrequently, last occurring 2

CT CHEST W&W/O C ; CT 100CC NON IONIC CONTRAST

Reason: eval for possible abscess in trachea, eval for narrowing
of
Field of view: 36 Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
63 year old woman with recent tracheal stent placement
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for possible abscess in trachea, eval for narrowing of
trachea
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 63-year-old woman with recent tracheal stenting,
distant partial tracheal resection and multiple biopsies,
evaluate for possible abscess or peritracheal fluid collection.

COMPARISON: Chest x-ray done the same day.

TECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT images through the chest with and without
IV contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformats were performed.

CT CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: At the superior portion
of the trachea imaged, there is moderate narrowing and a focal
soft tissue density along the right lateral aspect of the
trachea. Tracheal stent is identified and appears well
positioned. Tiny anterior tracheal diverticulum noted at the
level of the stent. The trachea is grossly patent from this
point more distally. There is a small- to- moderate amount of
peritracheal inflammatory changes, which is likely post-
surgical/procedural. No focal fluid collection or abscess is
identified. There is no evidence of tracheal perforation. No
abnormal lymph nodes are identified. The vasculature is within
normal limits. The heart and pericardium are unremarkable. The
lungs are clear. A tiny 5-mm nonspecific nodular opacity in the
right mid lung along the course of the major fissure. Limited
axial images through the upper abdomen demonstrate no gross
abnormalities. Bone windows demonstrate no suspicious lytic or
blastic lesions.

MULTIPLANAR REFORMATS: Only sagittal reformats were available
for interpretation at this time. They helped to better delineate
the tracheal stent, which appears in place and maintaining a
grossly patent trachea at its mid and distal aspect. The
superior aspect of the tracheal stent is not imaged.

IMPRESSION:
1) Indwelling tracheal stent, with a small soft tissue lesion
causing mild- to-moderate stenosis superiorly. Distal to this,
the airways are patent. The superior aspect of the stent is not
visualized on this study. If clinically warranted, a dedicated
CT trachea may be useful.

2) Nonspecific soft tissue stranding surrounding the trachea
about the course of the stent, likely postoperative/procedural
in nature. No focal abscess, fluid collection, or hematoma is
identified.

3) No evidence of pneumonia. Tiny nonspecific nodular opacities
in the right mid lung zone, nonspecific in nature, possibly
related to recent surgery.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted from the ED to the SICU for worsening
shortness of breath and pain. SHe was started on levofloxicin
and azithromycin for bronchitis, multiple nebs/inhalers to
maximize oxygen status, as well as morphine for pain. After 2
days, wHen patient was stable and breathing comfortably, was
transferred to the floor. Underwent rigid brnochoscopy on [**5-28**],
showed patent stent, and was prepared for discharge. HOspital
course was uncomplicated once started on appropriate meds.
Patient will go home with tylenol and ibuprofen for pain.
