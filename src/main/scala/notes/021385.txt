Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2186-3-13**] Aortic valve replacement with a 23-mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Epic
tissue valve. Left atrial appendage resection.

[**2186-3-9**] Cardiac Cath

History of Present Illness:
80 year old male with a history of CHF, aortic stenosis, atrial
fibrillation was admitted to outside hospital with shortness of
breath X 3 weeks with exertion and syncope while shoveling snow.
He ruled out for myocardial infarction with negative cardiac
markers. Echocardiogram [**2186-3-8**] showed increase in aortic
stenosis, with valve area 0.4cm and an EF of 55%. He was
transferred for cardiac catheterization to evaluate known aortic
stensosis and for Coronary artery disease.

Pertinent Results:
[**2186-3-9**] Cardiac cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this
right dominant system revealed no angiographically significant
coronary artery disease. 2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated
mildly elevated right atrial pressures, mild pulmonary artery
hypertension, and elevated left heart filling pressures with
prominant PCW v-waves (23mmHg). The cardiac output and index
were low normal (CO=4L/min, CI=2.2L/min/m2). The SVR was
elevated at 1640 dynes/sec/cm-5. The PVR was normal at 120
dynes/sec/cm-5. 3. Simultaneous measurement of femoral artery
pressure and left ventricular pressure (mean femoral artery
pressure was identical to central aortic pressure on
simultaneous measurement) revealed a mean transaortic gradient
of 49mmHg. The calculated aortic valve area was 0.63cm2. On
carefull pullback of the pigtail catheter from the LV apex to
the ascending aorta there was no subvalvular gradient
appreciated.

[**2186-3-13**] Echo: PRE BYPASS The left atrium is dilated. Moderate
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left
atrial appendage. Moderate spontaneous echo contrast is present
in the left atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying
velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). Moderate spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the right atrium. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal
(LVEF 50%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The number
of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is critical
aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was
notified in person of the results in the operating room at the
time of the study.
POST BYPASS The patient is being a-paced. There is normal
biventricular systolic function. There is a bioprosthesis
located in the aortic position. It appears well seated. The
leaflets are not well seen. There is trace valvular aortic
regurgitation. The maximum gradient through the valve was 29 mm
Hg with a mean gradient of 16 mm Hg at a cardiac output of 4.8
liters/minute. The left atrial appendage has been resected. The
effective orifice area of the valve was about 1.4 cm2. The rest
of valvular function was unchanged from the pre-bypass study.
The thoracic aorta apperas intact after decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a cardiac cath on
[**3-9**] which again confirmed his severe aortic stenosis but found
no coronary artery disease. He was referred for surgery. He
[**Month/Day (4) 1834**] usual pre-operative work-up and was medically managed
while awaiting surgery. On [**3-13**] he was brought to the operating
room where he [**Month/Day (4) 1834**] an aortic valve replacement and left
atrial appendage ligation. Later on op day he was weaned from
sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated.
Beta-blockers and diuretics were initiated and he was gently
diuresed towards his pre-op weight. On post-op day one he was
transferred to the step-down floor for further care. Chest tubes
and epicardial pacing wires were removed per protocol. Coumadin
was resumed for atrial fibrillation for a goal INR of [**3-8**].5. He
continued to make good progress and worked with physical therapy
for strength and mobility. On post-op day 4 he was discharged
with the appropriate medications and follow-up appointments.
