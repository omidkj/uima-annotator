Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Spinal fusion, lumbar puncture


History of Present Illness:
59 yom with Asthma, CHF, Depression initially presented to
[**Location (un) **] ER [**2133-6-29**] with severe back pain. Per records fell from
chair of [**6-25**] landing backward onto the back of his head. And
complained of back pain since that time. CT T-spine at [**Location (un) **]
ER revealed linear fracture of T9 body and underlying ankylosing
spondylitis. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care and ortho
eval.
.
In the ED at [**Hospital1 **] c/o back pain given IV Morphine and
transferred to TSICU. Initially fell injured t and c spine. T
spine concerning for ankylosing spondylitis, also T9 fx. Plan
for T and C spine MRI, unable to tolerate MRI, got T spine but
agitated so came back. Underwent Tspine surgery on [**7-4**] with
fusion. Intubated for repeat C spine, however, pt deemed too
large for MRI and plan was changed to have MRI done at [**Hospital1 2025**] (open
MRI). However this did not happen due to logistic reasons and
per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**] change to hard collar for 6 weeks. Pt self
extubated [**2133-7-5**] (intubated for ~5 days) and did well so not
reintubated.
.
Patient continued to have signs of delirium and psychosis so
consulted by Neurology and psychiatry. Neuro assessement
decreased mental status most likely confusion consistent with
metabolic encephalopathy and recommended repeat CT head
(negative for ICH), avoid narcotics, and CIWA scale. ICU course
complicated by delirium and psychosis including pulling out NG
tube and disorientation. Psych consult recommendations: On
alprazolam at home and may also have signs of benzo withdrawl.
Recommended alprazolam taper [**7-10**] 0.5mg PO TID, [**7-11**] 0.25 mg PO
TID, [**7-12**] 0.25 [**Hospital1 **], 0.25 mg qhs. Recommended using Haldol 2.5 mg
IV tid:prn and add 1.5mg IV TID standing. Patient also noted to
be aspirating and s/s consulted. ET tube secretions revealed
Ancef sensitive klebsiella thus started on cephalexin(day 1
[**2133-7-5**]).
.
At time of transfer patient denies any complaints. States that
earlier he was hung upside down. States that he is the little
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] hospital. Easily reorientable. Date states [**2133-7-8**]. Able to identify the president. Earlier states hard collar
was uncomfortable so he took it off, but now states that he will
keep it on. Denies any cp/sob. No n/v/d.

IMAGING:
Non-contrast CT of the cervical spine with coronal and sagittal
reformations.

FINDINGS: There is no acute fracture. There is extensive
degenerative change at multiple levels with large anterior
osteophytes some of which are bridging. The soft tissues of the
neck appear unremarkable. The lung apices are clear. The
visualized mastoid air cells and paranasal sinuses are clear.

IMPRESSION: Multilevel degenerative change without evidence of
fracture.

Non-contrast head CT.

FINDINGS: There is no intra or extra-axial hemorrhage, shifted
normally midline structures, or hydrocephalus. A 1.7 cm x 2.3 cm
cystic structure posterior to the right cerebellum could
represent an arachnoid cyst. No fractures are seen and there are
no air-fluid levels in the paranasal sinuses. The mastoid air
cells are clear. Soft tissues appear unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
2. Likely arachnoid cyst in the posterior fossa on the right.

Thoracic spine:
IMPRESSION:
1. T9 fracture with distracted fracture fragments with small
amount of fluid/blood in between the distracted fragments.
2. Unclear if there is extension of the fracture line into the
posterior elements- correlate with outside CT scan (not
available to us at this time).
3. Small amount of prevertebral soft tissue swelling likely due
to hematoma/anterior longitudinal ligamentous injury.
4. Increased signal intensity in the posterior spinal soft
tissues from T9- T12, unclear if this represents ligamentous
injury.
5. Normal-appearing thoracic spinal cord.

[**7-15**]
MRI OF THE BRAIN: There is mild ventricular and focal prominence
suggestive of mild degree of involutional change. There are no
signal or enhancement abnormalities within the brain parenchyma.
There is no hydrocephalus. The 2.6 x 1.9 cm arachnoid cyst just
to the right of midline in the posterior fossa is unchanged.

The fluid in the mastoid air cells bilaterally persist. Minimal
mucosal thickening of the left maxillary sinus is noted. The
craniocervical junction appears unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1. Stable right posterior fossa arachnoid cyst. No signal or
enhancement abnormalities in the brain parenchyma.
2. Fluid within the mastoid air cells bilaterally, as has been
seen on the prior CT scan.

[**7-20**]:
CHEST AP, UPRIGHT: Comparison is made to [**2133-7-15**]. A
right-sided PICC line enters the mid superior vena cava, as
noted previously, its tip again not well visualized. Vertical
spinal fusion rods are again noted. The cardiac and mediastinal
contours are unchanged. The lungs are clear. There are no
pleural effusions or pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

[**7-24**] T spine XR:
A total of five views is compared with recent examination dated
[**2133-7-13**]. Again demonstrated is the fracture deformity of the T9
vertebral body, unchanged. There is [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 931**]-type fixation
construct posteriorly with no significant overall change in the
position of the fixation rods and laminar hooks; no cross-piece
is identified. There is no evidence of interval hardware
complication or change in alignment, and no new fracture is
seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
Delirium - Patient was initially admitted after a fall and was
in the TSICU.  While there he was treated with benzodiazepines
for presumed alcohol withdrawal and had a persistent delirium.
Then there was thought by psychiatry that it was due to
benzodiazepine withdrawal and he was slowly tapered.  However
the delirium persisted out of the ICU and was placed on haldol.
Despite the limiting of sedating medications, he continued to be
disoriented and occasionally agitated.  He was evaluated with CT
head, MRI, and LP.  With all of these, there were no signs of
either structural abnormalities or signs of infection.  However,
the patient remained in
