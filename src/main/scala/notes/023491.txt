Brief Hospital Course:
1. Hypotension:  On admission, the idea that the patient had
evidence of sepsis given leukocytosis was considered.  Possible
sources included septic knee (with resulting bacteremia); less
evidence for pulmonary, GI, or GU.  Thought that hypovolemic,
cardiogenic, anaphylactic etiologies less likely.  PE a
possibility given ortho procedure this fall and prior clot
history but seems less likely as not hypoxic.  No evidence for
tamponade.  The patient was volume resuscitated, given empiric
vancomycin and ceftriaxone to cover for possible septic joint,
however knee films and ortho eval of right knee suggestive that
knee not nidus of infection.  Held home [**Last Name (un) **] and beta blocker.
Cardiac enzymes cycled.

2. Acute on chronic renal failure:  Likely seccondary to
hypotension.  Improved with fluids.  Renally dosed meds and
avoid nephrotoxins, hold [**Last Name (un) **]

3. Anemia:  Patient likely hemoconcentrated at admission. No
active bleeding. Iron, B12, folate levels within normal limits
[**9-16**].  Followed hct daily, type +screen.  Patient did not
require a transfusion.

4. Chronic pain:  Continued home pain medications with holding
parameters

5. h/o chronic pancreatitis:  Continued pancreatic enzyme
replacement, pain meds as above

6. DM: Continued insulin, follow fingersticks goal <150

7. CAD:  Continued ASA, statin. Held [**Last Name (un) **] in setting of renal
failure and BB in setting of hypotension.

8. Crohn's disease: Continued mesalamine

9. CHF, chronic, diastolic: Held [**Last Name (un) **] and BB as above. Appeared
euvolemic on exam.

10. h/o EtoH abuse: Patient denied any recent drinking.
