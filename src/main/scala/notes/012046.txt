Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2344**]
Chief Complaint:
Flank Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Attempt at IR guided embolization

History of Present Illness:
65yo male with h/o [**Doctor Last Name 933**], hyperlipidemia presenting with left
flank pain; CT with bilateral pulmonary emboli.
.
Per report patient had been in USOH when developed acute onset
left sided flank pain. Pain described as a burning is
non-radiating and localized to left flank.  Reports associated
pleuritic component and difficulty breathing when pain severe.
Aggravating factors: sitting upright
Alleviated factors: lying flat, deep breaths
Pertinent +/-: no personal or family of DVT/clotting disorder,
no long trips, no recent surgery, no fevers, weight loss, night
sweats, no abdominal pain, no melena, no hematchezia, no h/o
colonscopy
.
Persistent pain prompted presentation to the ED. On arrival VS:
97.2 107 120/80 16 100% RA. Ed labs notable for an elevated
Ddimer: 1381 EKG showed NSR 99 with no sign of R heart strain.
.
CTA of chest/abd/pelvis obtained with prelim read concerning for
bilateral PE's of basal segments with no sign of strain or
pulmonary infarct. Patient received Dilaudid 0.5IV for pain
control and was started on heparin per weight based protocal (wt
151): bolus 5500 and 1250 infusion to start. Vitals on transfer
afeb 110 118/78 20 98% on 2L NC.
.
On the floor, patient with persistent left flank pain, was
initially [**7-10**]. Reports breathing is comfortable. The patient
was started on heparin gtt in the ED. This was continued until
heparin was discontinued on [**4-24**] in the PM. On [**4-24**] PM the
patient was started on lovenox and coumadin in anticipation for
discharge. However at 1530 the patient became hypotensive to the
70s. He was also pale and diaphoretic with tachycardia. The
patient was triggered. He complained of abdominal pain and had
tenderness so went emergently to CT scan which showed
intra-abdominal hemorrhage.

STUDIES:
CTA:
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral segmental pulmonary emboli with small associated
pleural
effusions. There is no right heart strain or pulmonary infarct.

2. 1-cm cyst within the neck/body of the pancreas probably
represents a side branch IPMN.
.
CTAP:
IMPRESSION:
1. Large right heterogeneously hyperdense subcapsular liver
hematoma with
active extravasation. Possible extravasation from a posterior
inferior right liver branch; unable to definitively identify
vessel of origin. Extracapsular extension of hemorrhage into the
peritoneal cavity along the right paracolic gutter and adjacent
to the spleen. Large amount of hemorrhage within the dependent
pelvis.
2. Heterogeneous hypoenhancement of the liver adjacent to the
subcapsular
hematoma is likely related to mass effect. If clinical
suspicision remains for an underlying subcapsular liver lesion,
multiphasic CT would be useful to assess.
3. Prostate enlargement.
4. Enlarging left pleural effusion with worsening left lower
lobe atelectasis and/or consolidation.
.
CXR:
IMPRESSION:
1. New left lower lobe atelectasis and possible left pleural
effusion.
2. Position of new left subclavian central venous catheter as
described.
3. No evidence of post-insertion pneumothorax.
.
TEE:
Conclusions
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Extremely limited study. Globally-preserved
biventricular systolic function. Aerated saline contrasted study
was performed at rest, but its results are uninterpretable. If
clinical question regarding valvular disease or possible
intracardiac shunting persists, would recommend a
transesophageal study.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2171-11-25**], biventricular function still appears
normal overall.
.
CXR [**2185-4-26**]:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient
has been
intubated. The tip of the tube projects 8 cm above the carina,
the tube
should be advanced by approximately 2 to 3 cm. The venous
introduction sheath over the left subclavian vein is in constant
position. There is no evidence of complications, notably no
pneumothorax. In the interval, the patient has received a
nasogastric tube. The course of the tube is unremarkable.

No evidence of pulmonary edema, the cardiac silhouette is
unchanged.
Unchanged right retrocardiac atelectasis. Newly appeared mild
volume loss in the middle lobe, repeat radiograph should be
performed to exclude early
pneumonia. Tip of an inferior vena cava filter is included on
the image.
.
CXR: [**4-29**]
There is slight interval improvement of preexisting interstitial
pulmonary
edema. There is no change in bilateral, left most likely more
than right,
pleural
