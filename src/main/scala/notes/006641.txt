Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 330**]
Chief Complaint:
aspiration PNA, copious secretions

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
65 M with HepC/EtOH cirrhosis, HCC s/p orthotopic liver
transplant [**2157**], DM2, CAD, tracheostomy [**1-9**] prolonged intubation
s/p transplant, prior episode heart block c no pacemaker, [**Hospital **]
transferred from OSH for ongoing management of aspiration
pneumonia, ARF/CRI, and ongoing suctioning requirement.
.
Per OSH d/c summary, pt admitted to OSH [**8-12**] after being found in
his nursing home "unresponsive." At OSH ED he was briefly
intubated via trach, found to have a signficant amount of mucus
plugging which was recovered with trach suctioning, after which
pt rapidly improved. He was hemodynamically stable, sats 88-90%
(unclear on what), and improved with suctioning and nebs to
96-99%3L NC. He was called out to the medical floor.
.
On [**8-17**] pt noted to have increased secretions, increased RR
requiring frequent suction, ?aspiration. Sputum cx, BCx, UA
negative. creatinine 1.9, pt noted to have fever 100.2, RR 24,
sats 98%5L NC. CXR with ?infiltrate, started on levaquin/flagyl
x 7d course. S&S revealed worsening swallow, NGT placed. Pt seen
by renal for elevated BUN/Creatinine (up to 2.0), report of
elevated K (6.5), and treated with IVF x 1L and 1U PRBC, d/c'd
lasix, as was felt to be pre-renal etiology.
.
Of note, at OSH, also noted to have R elbow pain and found to
have joint effusion over R elbow. Evaluated by ortho and found
to hvae non-displaced right radial head fracture, R arm placed
in a sling. Effusion not drained. Treated symptomatically with
vicodin/oxycodone.
.
Decision was made to transfer pt to [**Hospital1 18**] hepatorenal service
given his h/o liver transplant here. Prior to transfer, pt
decline PEG tube placement for feeding.

Brief Hospital Course:
65 M c Hep C/EtOH cirrhosis complicated by HCC s/p liver
transplant complicated by prolonged ventilation now tracheostomy
dependent, transferred from OSH after being found unresponsive
[**1-9**] mucus plugging, hospital course complicatd by PNA and [**Hospital **]
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with ongoing suctioning requirement.
.
# respiratory distress - pt with h/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] induced BOOP,
initially transferred to OSH [**1-9**] being found unresponsive,
however apparently due to mucus plugging, and resolved quickly
after suction.  pt was briefly intubated at OSH via
tracheostomy, but quickly weaned. However pt then developed PNA
(?aspiration event), and is now s/p 7d course of levo/flagyl,
with slightly improving secretions.
.
CXR on admission to [**Hospital1 18**] demonstrated no obvious infiltrate.
ABG obtained showed increasing CO2 (66, and worsening
respiratory acidosis).  Given ongoing secretions and worsening
acidosis and patient's history of multiple drug resistent
organisms in sputum, decision made to start pt on 10d course of
meropenem and vancomycin for ongoing PNA vs tracheobronchitis
(day 1 [**8-24**]).  Pt's suctioning requirements gradually decreased
on meropenem and vancomycin, to q8h, and he was treated with
aggressive pulmonary toilet. On [**2161-9-1**], patient was noted to
have aspirated a significant portion of his lunchtime meal;
although he maintained his O2 sats. Video speech and swallow was
performed on [**2161-9-2**] and the results are still pending. The
results of the video speech and swallow and nutrition
recommendations will be faxed when ready.
.
# cirrhosis - pt with h/o hepC/etoh cirrhosis, s/p liver
transplant, on prograf, and cellcept, h/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] induced BOOP.
LFTs wnl at OSH,  AP midly elevated here 140. on [**8-14**] AST/ALT
18/18, tbil 0.7.  tacro levels obtained here were initially low
(2.1), and prograf level was increased from 1 QAM and 2QPM to
2mg po BID.  However due to again rising prograf levels, the
dose was decreased again to 1.5mg PO bid. Pt was discussed with
the liver service, and felt stable for discharge.   He will need
to have daily prograf levels drawn, with levels faxed to his
hepatologist (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 497**], ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 1582**], fax=([**Telephone/Fax (1) 48518**]), so that these can be adjusted (pt has a history of
mild rejection).
.
# ARF/CRI - baseline creatinine unclear (was 1.6-1.7 per OSH
consult report). cre= 2.2 at time of admission to OSH, trended
down to 1.9, then up to 2.0, felt [**1-9**] dehydration, and pt's home
lasix regimen d/c'd, in favor of rehydration with 125 ml/hr
D5NS.  At time of admission, pt's creatinine 1.5, where it
remained during hospitalization, this was felt to represent his
baseline.
.
.
# elbow effusion - right radial head fracture of R UE,
nondisplaced, seen by orthopedics at OSH who recommended a
sling, no other intervention.  Repeat films here showed no
fracture, and pt denied elbow pain.
.
.
# anemia - baseline hct ~27-30 over past 6 months, though normal
in [**12-14**].  guaiac negative stools, this admission.  likely with
component of ACD.  His HCT remained stable during this
admission.
.
.
# Leukocytosis - initially presented with WBC 11.8, felt likely
[**1-9**] resolving PNA, though ongoing pulmonary secretions.  BCx,
UCx unremarkable.  Pt
