Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1115**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
RIJ

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 104318**] is a  45 year old male with a PMH significant for DM
2, ESRD on HD with a history of multiple admissions for left
flank and left chest pain and hypertension admitted from
outpatient HD with chest pain.  Patient is somnolent likely due
to large doses of narcotics in ED, but he states that he was 4
hours into his hemodialysis session when he had abrupt onset of
sharp CP rated [**9-25**] without radiation to back, arm, or jaw. He
endorses SOB during this episode, and says this is a pain he has
never had before. He also was having nausea and vomiting during
[**Month/Year (2) 2286**] that has continued since presentation to [**Hospital1 18**]. He
states that, per usual routine, he did not take his
anti-hypertensive meds prior to HD.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, VS 97.2 91 [**Telephone/Fax (2) 104341**]0%4L nc.  During his ED
course, he had a max SBP of 240. Cardiac biomarkers and an ECG
were unchanged from baseline. He received [**Telephone/Fax (2) **] 325 mg, nitro SL
x3, morphine 4 mg IV x2, dilaudid 1 mg x1, labetalol 10 mg x1.
He was started on nitro gtt without improvement in his BP, so he
was started on a nicardipine gtt.  Given inadequate PIV access,
a RIJ was placed.  Cardiology was consulted in the ED, and his
chest pain and elevated TnI was felt to be at most demand
ischemia and not ACS. He was then transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
further management.
.
On arrival, he denies any CP/SOB, but endorses nausea, vomiting,
and left-sided flank pain.

IMAGINGS:

CXR ([**8-31**]) final: Two portable AP chest radiographs demonstrate
unchanged cardiomediastinal contours compared to [**2124-7-11**].
Multiple surgical clips project over the axilla. The lungs are
clear. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

edema, mass effect, or infarction. There is a septum cavum
pellucidum et vergae, unchanged which is a normal variant.

there is no shift of normally midline structures. The ventricles
and sulci are unchanged in size or configuration. There are
vascular calcifications of bilateral carotid siphons and
bilateral vertebral arteries as well as bilateral temporal

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 104318**] is a 45 year old male with ESRD on HD admitted with CP
and hypertensive urgency.

# Hypertensive urgency: In the [**Name (NI) 153**], pt was taken off
nicardipine gtt (he was on nicardipine gtt for at least 5
hours).  He then received lisinopril, nifedipine, labetalol for
blood pressure control. Also received nitro SL, morphine, and
dilaudid. We were unable to assess end organ damage to kidneys
given ESRD. Cardiac biomarkers and ECG unchanged from baseline
per cardiology evaluation in ED. Chest pain may have contributed
to hypertensive episode. Unclear precipitating even, but
medication non-compliance is a possibility and patient has
frequent admissions for hypertension.  Volume overload is
unlikely given recent HD session and physical exam. Patient was
transferred to the floor on HD2, lisinopril was converted to
captopril, home metoprolol, valsartan and nifedipine were
continued. Slowly SBP returned down to normal range on the above
regimen. It appeared that patient's blood pressure tends to run
high after [**Name (NI) 2286**], so the post-[**Name (NI) 2286**] period is the time of
maximal vigilance for blood pressure monitoring. On [**Name (NI) 2286**]
days, Patient should be given nifedipine prior to [**Name (NI) 2286**] as
nifedipine is not dialyzed, and resume other blood pressure meds
after [**Name (NI) 2286**].
.
# Chest pain: ACS was ruled out with serial cardiac biomarkers
and repeat ECGs. Pain was initially controlled with IV morphine
and dilaudid which were discontinued due to patient somnolence.
A similar episode of chest pain associated with hypertension
occurred on [**9-7**] after [**Month/Year (2) 2286**], and patient was ruled out with
EKG and negative cardiac enzymes.
.
# Left flank pain: This is chronic issue. He's had this pain
since [**2119**] with multiple admissions and extensive work-up and it
is thought possibly due to diabetic thoracic polyneuropathy.
After IV pain medications were discontinued, patient was put
back on his home percocet with better pain control. We also
restarted gabapentin which patient thinks helped him in the
past. It fell off the discharge medications in [**6-24**]. We talked
to PCP's office and it continues to
