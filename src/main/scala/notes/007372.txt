Chief Complaint:
respiratory distress, fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
87 y/o F and resident of [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with PMH asthma on chronic
steroids, s/p GI bleed, h/o diverticulosis, HTN, hypothyroidism
who presents with respiratory distress from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab to ED.
Per report, pt had developed fevers to 101, increased oxygen
requirement, wheezing and shortness of breath. Pt was unable to
provide history on presentation but per ED notes complained of
RUQ abd pain and [**Hospital **] Rehab nurses had reported that pt was
exposed to influenza from neighboring resident at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.

.
In [**Name (NI) **], pt initially had T 103.5, BP 187/69, HR 102, RR 44, O2
sats low 90s on 6 L NC. Wbc nl with no significant left shift,
lactate 2.3, U/A was positive for UTI and CXR showed ?R hilar
opacity c/w PNA. Pt was given Vancomycin/Levofloxacin/Flagyl,
Ativan 1mg x 2, Tylenol #3 for pain. Her sats began to worsen
and later on [**3-18**], pt became hypertensive with BP 190/90,
increased RR to 40s with increased bibasilar crackles and was
given 40 IV lasix. Pt was shortly thereafter placed on BIPAP 5/5
on [**3-19**] and placed on NTG gtt with improvement in sats and RR.
Pt became tachypneic late last night as well with drop in O2
sats to 80s, CPAP was attempted again but pt could not tolerate
mask. She was placed on NRB and O2 has been titrated down to 5 L
FM. She was admitted to MICU for further management

.
CXR [**2111-3-21**]: Allowing for marked patient rotation, cardiac and
mediastinal contours appear stable. Pulmonary vascularity is
normal. There is improving aeration at the lung bases with
resolving atelectatic changes. Previously reported small left
pleural effusion has nearly resolved in the interval. There are
no new or worsening areas of opacification in the lungs to
suggest a new or evolving pneumonia.

TTE [**2111-3-20**]: 1. The left atrium is moderately dilated.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is
a moderate
resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, probably
secondary to
hyperdynamic heart.
3. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Trace
aortic
regurgitation is seen.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
severe mitral
annular calcification.
5. Compared with the findings of the prior study (images
reviewed) of
[**2105-12-15**], the LV outflow tract gradient has increased and the LV
is
hyperdynamic.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 87 y/o F with asthma on chronic prednisone,
anxiety/depression, ?h/o CHF who presents from [**Hospital **] Rehab with
worsening respiratory distress and evidence of UTI and PNA.
.
1) Respiratory distress/respiratory failure: Thought to be
likely multifactorial, combination of PNA, asthma exacerbation,
diastolic CHF exacerbation and anxiety.  The patient was started
on vancomycin and ceftriaxone for (given concomitant UTI),
placed on BIPAP and IV steroids, and was diuresed with BP
control.  Because of high anxiety component causing tachypnea
and respiratory distress, pt was placed on Ativan, haldol, and
morphine (although morphine sulfate is listed as allergies, pt
tolerated morphine well.  Per daughter, pt previously developed
psychosis).  Given her poor clinical improvement after >48hours
of broad abx, IV steroids, and diureses, a discussion with
family regarding goals of care was held in the afternoon of
[**3-21**].  Family decided that comfort is the main goal, and the
patient was placed on morphine sulfate gtt to titrate RR to
[**10-16**] and discontinued BIPAP.  The patient expired peacefully at
23:52 on [**3-21**].
.
2) UTI - evidence of E. coli on urine cx from [**3-18**], resistant to
Levo and Cipro. Started ceftriaxone.
.
3) Asthma - Pt was placed on bipap, received iv solumedrol.
BIPAP was discontinued after decision was made to make the
patient comfort measures only.
.
4) CHF - Had evidence of fluid overload on exam and per ED notes
and was diuresed with lasix.  Pt was ruled out MI with 2
negative sets in the Ed.  Repeat echo showed EF of 75%, likely
has diastolic disfunction.  Held further diurese in the unit on
[**3-21**].  Controlled her BP with iv nitro gtt, hydralazine and
diltiazem.
.
5) Abdominal pain - Abd CT neg for acute abdominal pathology to
explain pain.  Likely from respiratory distress/tachypnea.
.
6)Hypothyroidism - cont with synthroid
.
7)Elevated blood sugars - Insulin drip was refused by family due
to too frequent FS checks (q1h).  Thus, q4h finger sticks, HISS.

.
8) Anxiety - cont with ativan, haldol and morphine/prn. Pt's
daugthers state that pt becomes extremely anxious without ativan
dosing.
.
9) FEN- NPO while on BIPAP. Repleted lytes aggressively.
.
10) A
