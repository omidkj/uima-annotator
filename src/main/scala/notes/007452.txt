Brief Hospital Course:
Following initiation of resuscitative efforts in the ED the
patient was taken to the operating room for debridement of his
left flank necrotizing soft tissue infection.  He was
subsequently tranferred to the surgical intensive care unit for
resuscitation of his septic shock.

The remainder of his hospital course will be summarized by
system:

Neuro:
The patient was maintained on sedative and analgesic medications
throughout his course.  There were no specific untoward events
during his stay.

Pulmonary:
The patient was mainained on the ventilator throughout his
hospital course due to the severity of his illness.  There were
no

Cardiovascular:
Beginning in the ED and continuing thereafter the patient
required multiple pressor agents to sustain a perfusing
pressure.  Agents included vasopressin, and levophed
predominantly.  He stabilized with massive fluid resuscitation
and these medications but remained dependent on them throuhout
his stay.

Fluids/GI:
Initial and continued fluid resuscitation to approximately 15
liters above his baseline was required to maintain peripheral
perfusion.  There were no GI problems except for ileus.

Renal:
The patient was oliguric throughout his course consistent with
his basline ESRD.  Hemodialysis was started after he appeared to
stabilize late in his hospital stay.

Heme/ID:
The patient was started on broad spectrum empiric antibiotic
therapy with input from the infectious disease team as well.
Blood cultures were positive for Strep Pneumo and his antibiotic
coverage was tailored accordingly.  Additional work-up to rule
out an occult process contributing to his sepsis included
cross-sectional body imaging, and cardiac echo both of which
were unfruitful.

Endocrine:
Good glycemic control was acheived with insulin therapy.

Wound:
The left flank wound was found to track extensively along the
fascial plane of the left side.  Wet to dry dressing changes
were done daily with significant improvement in the overall
appearance of the wound.  The progress of the wound necrosis had
been halted with sharp debridement and resuscitation.

The patient stabilized on intensive supportive therapy including
antibiotics, mechanical ventilation, IV fluids, blood products,
sharp debridement of the necrotic tissue, and pressors.  However
there was little evidence that he would be able to wean from
these measures.  Multiple meetings were held with members of his
family.  By hospital day 5, they requested that comfort measures
only be administered and the patient subsequently expired the
same evening.  The cause of death is thought to be compications
secondary to septic shock.
