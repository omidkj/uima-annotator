Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo Italian speaking M with AS (area 1.2), complete heart
block s/p pacer, DVT/PE (on coumadin) p/w worsening SOB most
consistent with acute CHF exacerbation.

# Acute Diastolic CHF exacerbation: On arrival to the CCU from
the ED the pt was on BiPAP for a respiratory rate of 32 and
labored breathing. He tolerated BiPAP well and was given a bolus
of IV lasix to which his urine output increased appropriately.
He was then started on an IV lasix drip and metolazone. He
continued to diurese well and he was able to be taken off BiPAP
and placed on nasal can
