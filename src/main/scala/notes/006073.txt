History of Present Illness:
19F with four year history of asthma (prior intubation one year
ago per patient) presenting with a two day history of increased
SOB, cough and increased use of home nebulizer treaments. The
patient was recently seen at [**Company 191**] [**2150-10-28**] for asthma
exacerbation and was given a prescription for a short prednisone
taper. The patient did not improve and noted decreased peak
flows in 200s from baseline 450. The patient spoke with her
allergist and took prednisone 60 mg the day of admission. The
patient presented in moderate respiratory distress with stridor,
use of accessory muscles, and increased work of breathing.
Within 10 minutes of being seen, the patient started to
decompensate with increasing stridor and intermittent coughing.
Oxygen saturation was noted to be mid-90s% on RA. Patient was
given ativan, magnesium, epinephrine SC 0.03 mg, solumedrol 125
mg IV, racemic epinephrine nebs, albuterol nebs and atrovent
nebs. Patient's breathing appeared to improve, but within 20
minutes the patient began to decompensate with RR 30-40 and
stridorous breathing. A CXR was taken at this time which showed
a LLL infiltrate consistent with pneumonia. The patient received
etomadate, ativan, succinylcholine and was intubated. Initial
CXR showed right mainstem intubation and the ETT was withdrawn.
She was started on levofloxacin for her pneumonia.

At the time of admission, the patient was intubated and sedated
and unable to provide further history. Her mother was present
and provided the patient's home medications.

Brief Hospital Course:
   Ms [**Known lastname 3501**] was admitted with respiratory failure originally
thought to be due to asthma exacerbation in the setting of LLL
PNA.  Pt was initially treated in the ED with nebulizers and
steroids, followed by intubation. Pt was extubated 8 hours later
once in the ICU.  She was treated for her pneumonia with
Azithromycin x5 day course and continued on her nebulizers and
home inhalers. Pt was also treated with heliox. Pt was evaluated
