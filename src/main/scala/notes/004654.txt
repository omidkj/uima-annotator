Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain

History of Present Illness:
This is a 74 y.o. male w/ cryptogenic cirrhosis who was
discharged after a short admission six days ago for nonspecific
abdominal pain thought due to lactulose. He reports that over
the past few days he has continued to have this pain thus
leading him to seek care. He reports this is constant diffuse
abdominal and bilateral flank pain (R>L). This is similar to his
previous pain during his last hospitalization but he claims it
is more intense and persistent. This is made slightly better by
bowel movements and worse by eating. The patient reports that
with this he has had a great deal of trouble sleeping and that
he has been wandering around at night, which his wife and
daughter confirm. [**Name2 (NI) **] describes the abdominal pain as crampy in
nature and reports it feels like bloating. He also complains of
near constant itching that is bothering him a great deal. He
denies any fevers or chills. He endorses relatively chronic
nausea. He denies any dysuria or hematuria. He reports he had a
large bowel movement last night after lactulose but unclear how
many he is having regularly. Does report being intermittently a
bit confused and slow.
.
In ED, vitals were T 97.5, P 80, BP 101/50, RR 16, O2 Sat 98% on
RA. He had a nonfocal exam with diffuse abdominal discomfort.
Labs were at his baseline. He was guiac negative from below.
Ultrasound showed no portal veing clot or other acute pathology
so he was admitted for further work up.
.
Currently, he is mostly complaining of his bilateral flank pain
and is very frustrated he is back in the hospital without a
clear diagnosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7046**] is a 74 year old gentleman with crypytogenic
cirrhosis who presented with abdominal pain and low back pain
who was found to have CAP PNA, and subsequently had worsening
volume overload, hyponatremia, and DJD, who underwent a liver
transplant

1)Community Acquired Pneumonia: The patient was found to have an
infiltrate on CXR, and subsequently grew E. Coli resistent to
Ciprofloxacin.  He had initially been treated with Levaquin and
then was empirically switched to Ceftriaxone followed for a 5
day course. His urine legionella was negative. He was
subsequently treated once more with ceftriaxone for a five day
course because the infiltrate on his chest x-ray had not
resolved.

2) Abdominal Pain/DJD: He had abdominal pain that was similar in
nature to his prior presentation which was felt to be
non-specific and releated to his lactulose.  During this
admission, his lactulose was discontinued, and plain films of
his spine revealed severe DJD.  On PE he was noted to have
decreased ankle jerks and sensory changes consistent with
possible protruding or herniating disc.  He denied any bowel or
bladder incontinence, or decrease in peri-anal sensation.  He
will require an MRI as an outpatient.  His back pain was
adequately controlled on oxycodone.  He was noted to be
ambulating on the floor without any pain or radicular symptoms.
General Surgery was consulted as the patient's pain occasionally
became very severe; a CT of the abomden/pelvis revealed
bilateral fat inguinal hernias, for which gen [**Doctor First Name **] did not want
to operate.

3) Cryptogenic Decompensated Cirrhosis: MELD 20 upon admission.
Although his ferritin and transferritin were elevated, his HFE
gene mutation was negative.  His pathology was reviewed, and
determined that he did not have a diagnosis of hemachromatosis,
despite several physical exam features consistent with the
disease.  He was therefore labeled as cryptogenic cirrhosis.  He
did not have any hematemesis.  His diurectics were continued for
persistent peripherial edema, with minimal ascities.  His
creatinine trended up from his baseline, and responsed to  IV
fluids and albumin in addition to midodrine and octreotide.  His
Creatinine, however did not return to base line and his LFT's
continued to worsen in addition to his creatinine. Although HRS
treatment initally appeared to be successful, the patient had
another decompensationw with his creatinine, and was started on
maximal doses of HRS therapy. He had several episodes of
ascities requiring therapeutic paracentesis, particualrly after
his Cr rose, and we had to discontinue is diuretics. He had
several taps in the hospital, none of which showed SBP, but the
patient was started on PRIMARY prophylaxis with Cipro (later
switched to Bactrim, as he could not tolerate Cipro)
.
4) [**Last Name (un) **]: The patient initially presented at his baseline CR, but
it continued to rise in the setting of diuretics.  He was
initially given volume without improvement, when Renal was
consulted who felt that his [**Last Name (un) **] was initially not secondary to
HRS, and with the administration of volume in addition to
continued use of midodrine and octreotide his CR resolved to
1.0.  However, upon re-initiation of his diurectics his creatine
started to climb until it peaked around 2.9. He was started on
maximal doses of ocreotide, midodrine, and daily albumin
infusions.
.
5) Hyponatremia: It was initially thought that his hypernatremia
was secondary to volume overload.  He was Hypernatremia improved
slightly on diurectic therapy, but resolved after administration
of intravascular volume and colloid.

6) Depression: The patient endorses feelings of despair prior to
his transplant, at one point asking if he was "wasting [our]
time." The patient has been evaluated by psychiatry in the past,
whom felt that this was adjustment disorder. Would avoid remeron
given concerns for sedation, although this medication would help
with appetite, he was started on low dose citalopram. Mood has
improved since time of transplant.
