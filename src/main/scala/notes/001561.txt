Admission Date:  [**2102-10-10**]       Discharge Date:  [**2102-10-18**]

Date of Birth:   [**2041-11-27**]       Sex:  M

Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 60-year-old male with
no medical care for the last ten years, who had sudden onset
of dyspnea while riding his bike.  He had positive
palpitations, no chest pain, no nausea or vomiting or
diaphoresis.  He stopped and rested, with no relief.

He entered the [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency
Department and was found to have an oxygen saturation of 70%.
Electrocardiogram showed no complex tachycardia, with an
elevated blood pressure.  Adenosine was given with no effect.
It was given again, and he was broken to normal sinus rhythm
with a rate of 80s.  Chest x-ray showed congestive heart
failure at that time, and he was started on a nitro drip,
given aspirin and lasix, and the patient improved.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Questionable hypertension, which was
untreated, arthritis, essential tremor.

MEDICATIONS:  Ibuprofen as needed.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on admission:  Afebrile,
heart rate in the 80s, blood pressure normal, oxygen
saturation 98% on 3 liters.  He was alert and oriented, no
jugular venous distention was noted.  Pupils equal, round and
reactive to light.  He had crackles halfway up the lung
fields.  His cardiovascular examination showed distant heart
sounds, regular rate and rhythm, with no murmurs, gallops or
rubs.  His abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended, bowel
sounds present.  The extremities were warm and well perfused,
with no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 16.5, hematocrit 46.0, platelet
count 362.  Sodium 141, potassium 3.2, chloride 101,
bicarbonate 20, BUN 12, creatinine 0.9, glucose 101.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]
service and begun workup of congestive heart failure.  The
patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory,
which showed three vessel disease and was planned for
coronary artery bypass graft at that time.  EP studies were
also done at that time due to his narrow complex
supraventricular tachycardia requiring adenosine.

During the catheterization, it was found that the patient had
moderate aortic insufficiency and it was planned that he
would have an AVR at the same time.

On [**2102-10-12**], the patient was taken to the operating room,
where a coronary artery bypass graft x 3 and AVR was
performed.  The patient was transferred to the CSRU
postoperatively.  He did well.  The patient was weaned from
his ventilator and was extubated and continued to improve.
His Foley was removed.  His chest tube was removed.

The patient was noted to have supraventricular tachycardia
postoperatively, which was broken with adenosine.  Lopressor
was started in order to control his supraventricular
tachycardia, however, the patient continued to have repeat
episodes of supraventricular tachycardia.  He was kept in the
Intensive Care Unit for monitoring and for administration of
adenosine.  EP was following at this time, and it was planned
for a workup.  His Lopressor was increased, but again had no
effect.

The patient was taken to the EP laboratory on [**2102-10-17**], where
he was studied and found to have a pathway which was
successfully ablated.  Physical Therapy was consulted for
ambulation, and the patient did well, and it was felt that
the patient would be safe to be discharged home.

After his ablation, the patient was transferred to the floor,
where he did well.  On postoperative day number six, the
patient had no further episodes of supraventricular
tachycardia, and his heart rate was stable.  The patient was
able to clear stairs with physical therapy, and the patient
was discharged home in stable condition.

The patient is instructed to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] in
four weeks, and with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 284**] of Cardiology in two to
four weeks, and his primary care physician in one to two
weeks.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lopressor 50 mg by mouth twice a day
2.  Lasix 20 mg by mouth twice a day
3.  Potassium chloride 20 mEq by mouth twice a day
4.  Colace 100 mg by mouth twice a day
5.  Zantac 150 mg by mouth twice a day
6.  Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once daily
7   Percocet one to two tablets by mouth every four hours as
needed

The patient is discharged in stable condition.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Supraventricular tachycardia status post ablation
2.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass graft x 3

The patient is discharged in stable condition to home, and is
instructed to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] in four weeks, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 284**] in two to four weeks, and his primary care
physician in one to two weeks.
