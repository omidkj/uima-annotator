History of Present Illness:
76y/o lady with DM2, AFib on Warfarin s/p DCCV [**2116**] and also 2
weeks ago, h/o rheumatic fever s/p mechanical AVR and MVR in
[**2098**], systolic CHF (EF=20-25%), interstitial lung disease on
home O2 (question of amio toxicity), and h/o strep endocarditis
who was referred to the ED from her PCP's office due to
AFib/RVR, and is admitted to the CCU due to difficulty
controlling her HR in the ED.
.
Of note, she was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 69954**] from her PCP's
office due to AFib/RVR in the setting of UTI and volume
depletion from uptitrated diuretics.  At that time, she was
given Diltiazem IV in the ED, dropped her BP, and was admitted
to the CCU.  She was successfully cardioverted [**5-30**] and was in
NSR at the time of discharge.  Her Lasix dose was decreased, her
Lisinopril was stopped due to hypotension, and she was started
on Cefpodoxime for UTI.
.
She has been doing well overall since discharge.  Denies any
chest pain, worsened shortness of breath, lightheadedness, leg
swelling.  2 nights ago she felt the sudden onset of
palpitations; she took her pulse which was 160 so she figured
she might be back in AFib but she hoped it would only be
temporary.  A few times since then, she repeated the pulse and
it was ~130.  Today she was at her post-discharge PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 702**]
and was found to be in AFib/RVR so she was referred to the ED.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: T 98, HR 151, BP 108/67, RR 20, POx
100% 3L NC.  EKG confirmed AFib/RVR, no changes concerning for
ischemia.  Labs were notable for Cr 1.8 (this is the lowest it
has been in years), and therapeutic INR at 2.7.  She was given
500cc normal saline over 45 minutes with no change in HR, but
she and developed mild crackles at the lung bases without
dyspnea or decrease in O2 sat.  She was then given Diltiazem
10mg IV x1 with HR still 140's but BP dropped to 80/50.  She was
Digoxin loaded with 0.5mg IV.  She was started on a Diltiazem
gtt and was admitted to the CCU due to trouble controlling her
HR.  VS prior to transfer were: HR 130-150, BP 108/70, RR 12,
POx 100% 2L NC.
.
On arrival to the CCU, she feels well.  No chest pain, no
palpitations.  She is at her baseline level of shortness of
breath (feels dyspneic even when walking a few feet).
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
Pertinent for mild cough that is non-productive.
Also, mild left ankle edema, though better today.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

Imaging:
.
Chest x-ray [**6-12**]
FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was
obtained.  The
patient is status post median sternotomy.  The cardiac
silhouette remains
moderate-to-severely enlarged.  The aorta is calcified.  There
is mild
pulmonary vascular congestion.  Hazy opacity projecting over the
left
costophrenic angle may relate to overlying soft tissue, although
a pleural
effusion cannot be excluded.  Small right pleural effusion is
also difficult
to exclude.
IMPRESSION:  Persistent moderate-to-severe enlargement of the
cardiac
silhouette.  Difficult to exclude small bilateral pleural
effusions.
Pulmonary vascular congestion.
.
Renal US/Artery Doppler:
1.  Bilateral renal cysts, as described above.
2.  The left kidney is decreased in size.  Left arterial
waveforms demonstrate blunted systolic upstroke, suggestive of
renal artery stenosis.
.
Chest x-ray [**6-19**]:
FINDINGS:  There is a biventricular pacemaker in the left chest
wall with
leads in the right atrium, right ventricle, and a third lead
through the
coronary sinus. There is no pneumothorax.  Left retrocardiac and
right basilar opacities are likely atelectasis.  There is mild
improvement in pulmonary edema.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
unchanged.  There is no focal consolidation or pleural
effusions.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Biventricular pacemaker/AICD with leads in appropriate
positioning.
2.  Improved pulmonary edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF CLINICAL SUMMARY:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 76y/o lady with DM2, AFib on Warfarin s/p
DCCV [**2116**] and also 2 weeks ago, h/o rheumatic fever s/p
mechanical AVR and MVR in [**2098**] on warfarin, systolic CHF
(EF=20-25%), and interstitial lung disease on home O2 (question
of amio toxicity) who presents with recurrent AFib/RVR.  She had
a BiV ICD placed and was started on dofetilide prior to
discharge, without complication.

ISSUES:
#. AFib with RVR: Patient had successful AC cardioversion on
[**2120-6-12**] from atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm.  The patient
then went back into atrial fib
