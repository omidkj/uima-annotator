HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old man
with a history of one hour of a headache on the afternoon of
admission that progressed to right sided hemiplegia and
aphagia with a blood pressure noted to be above 200 systolic
and a blood sugar of 248 on arrival.  He was taken to the MRI
left sided subdural hematoma.  He was taken to the Operating Room
for evacuation of a hematoma and postop was noted to have equal
and reactive pupils again.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  History of hypertension, noninsulin
dependent diabetes mellitus, aortic insufficiency, chronic
atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease with a past

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Coumadin.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa for which he developed a rash in the past.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He was afebrile.  Vital signs were 70
to 80 in atrial fibrillation with a blood pressure of 150/60
at the time of examination.  Respiratory rate 8 on 100%, but
he was ventilated with SIMV with pressure support, tidal
volume 700, rate of 8 and 100% O2 with PEEP of 5 and pressure
support of 5.  His arterial blood gas at that time were 7.36,
PCO2 43, PO2 41, PCO2 25, and in general he was sedated and
intubated at the time of the examination following surgery.
He had a irregular rate and rhythm to his heart.  Lungs
showed coarse breath sounds bilaterally.  Abdominal
examination was soft and nontender.  Extremities were warm
with minimal edema and increased Babinski on bilateral toes.
He did not move extremities or withdraw to any painful
stimuli and following his surgery he was admitted to the
Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit having had an acute
subdural hematoma, which occurred while on Coumadin drained
in the Operating Room just prior to admission to the Neuro
Intensive Care Unit.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the day of admission the patient was
taken to the Operating Room as noted above where a craniotomy
for evacuation of a left sided subdural hematoma was
performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] and assisted by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1022**].  The
patient tolerated the procedure well, but showed no
improvement neurologically following the procedure.  He was
admitted to the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit and was
followed throughout his hospitalization by the Neurosurgical
Service as well as seen in consultation by Neurology.
However, he showed no evidence of increased neurological
activity.  He remained essentially comatose with limited if
any spontaneous movements and limited if any withdraw to
painful stimuli and due to the gravity of the situation after
several days of hospitalization and no evidence of
neurological improvement, a discussion was entertained with
the family and the family decided to convert the patient from
resuscitative status to nonresuscitative status with comfort
measures only and the family requested that the patient be
provided a morphine drip for comfort.  All of this was done
and the patient was transferred from the Neurosurgical
Intensive Care Unit to the regular hospital floor and
subsequent to this the patient showed no evidence of
neurological improvement.

On the [**2129-12-28**] the patient was examined at 5:16
p.m. and showed no evidence of spontaneous activity or
response to verbal or painful stimuli and showed no evidence
of spontaneous respiration.  There was no peripheral pulse
palpable and no respirations or heart sounds auscultated on
the chest.  The pupils were 6 mm and nonreactive to light
bilaterally and therefore the patient was declared deceased
at 5:16 p.m. with the family present at the patient's bedside
at the time of pronouncement.
