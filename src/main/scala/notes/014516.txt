HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 34227**] is a 65-year-
old male with past medical history significant for coronary
artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft, end-
stage renal disease on hemodialysis, multiple episodes of
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia,
multiple access issues for hemodialysis with stent stenosis
of the left subclavian and right IJ and IVC stents, who was
admitted to an outside hospital on [**2173-3-8**] with an episode
of nausea, vomiting, and dehydration.  Patient was discharged
but had returned to [**Hospital6 4620**] on [**2173-3-19**]
with chest pain and shortness of breath that developed while
in hemodialysis that day.  The patient had noted an episode
of chest pain one day prior to admission which was relieved
with one sublingual nitroglycerin.

In the [**Hospital3 **] Emergency Department the patient was
found to have a blood pressure of 65/47, heart rate 79,
temperature 96.8 F.  He was emergently intubated for
hypoxemia and airway protection.  Despite intravenous fluids
the patient's blood pressure did not increase and he was
initiated on Neo-Synephrine.  One set of cardiac enzymes was
negative and a CT angiogram of the chest was performed which
indicated no pulmonary embolism.  An ultrasound of his
hemodialysis graft of his left extremity demonstrated no
thrombosis or abscess.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further management.

general, the patient is intubated and sedated.  HEENT
examination demonstrates conjunctival edema.  Cardiovascular
exam is irregular irregular, S1 and S2 without murmur.
Respiratory examination demonstrates decreased breath sounds
at the bases bilaterally, rhonchi on the right side

nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities
demonstrate no lower extremity edema, left AV fistula with

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE FROM [**2173-3-20**] THROUGH THE
TIME OF THIS DICTATION, [**2173-4-10**]:
1. Respiratory failure:  Mr. [**Known lastname 34227**] presented to [**Hospital 34228**] complaining of chest pain and was
   emergently intubated secondary to hypoxemia and depressed
   mental status.  A CT angiogram at the outside hospital was
   negative for an aortic dissection or pulmonary embolism.
   There were large bilateral pleural effusions noted which,
   upon thoracentesis, were transudative.  Cultures that were
   drawn at [**Hospital6 4620**] were negative.  A
   component of the patient's respiratory failure was felt to
   be secondary to a pneumonia which was clearly demonstrated
   on chest x-rays.  A sputum culture from [**2173-2-19**] was
   positive for E. Coli, two different morphologies,
   multiresistant, but this organism was sensitive to
   Meropenum, Tobramycin, Bactrim, cefepime, and Gentamicin.
   The patient's sputum culture from [**2173-3-21**] also
   demonstrated MRSA.

The patient's antibiotics on transfer included Ciprofloxacin,
Linezolid.  These were continued until the results of the
sputum culture returned.  Ciprofloxacin was continued and
Gentamicin initiated on [**2173-3-25**].  Patient finished a seven-
day course of Linezolid for the MRSA.  Despite treating the
underlying pneumonia, the patient was difficult to wean.  A
repeat thoracentesis was performed on [**2173-3-23**], which
demonstrated a transudative fluid which, upon culture and
cytology, was negative.  We continued the daily treatment,
and appropriate spontaneous breathing trials were performed,
but the patient's mental status limited his extubation
despite adequate pulmonary esthetics.

Hospital course was complicated by a self-extubation that
occurred on [**2173-3-29**] and emergent reintubation.  He was
successfully extubated on [**2173-4-1**] and remains so at the
time of this dictation.

Mr. [**Known lastname 34227**] continued to do well status post extubation
until [**2173-4-7**] when he developed significant upper
chest/neck and upper extremity edema secondary to a worsening
SVC syndrome.  His breathing became more labored presumably
secondary to decreased chest wall compliance secondary to
this edema, potential aspirations, and pleural effusion, and
a VVD demonstrated hypercarbia on [**2173-4-9**].  The patient
was placed on masked ventilation for six hours and has
continued to do well off of ventilatory support.

A family meeting was held on [**2173-4-9**] with the patient's
wife [**Name (NI) **] and brother [**Doctor First Name **] and his three children.
However, they agree not to reintubate the patient.  This,
because the underlying etiology of his respiratory failure
would not be quickly reversible; i.e., SVC syndrome secondary
to failing collaterals and potential aspiration.

1. Distributive shock:  [**Known lastname 34227**] presented to [**Hospital **] hypotensive despite aggressive fluid
   resuscitation.  He was initiated on vasopressors at that
   time.  On transfer the patient had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] stim test to
   evaluate for potential adrenal insufficiency in the
   setting of his likely septic shock presentation.  His [**Last Name (un) **]
   stim test did demonstrate that he was relatively adrenal
   insufficient, and hydrocortisone and Fludrocortisone were
   initiated.  The patient's sepsis was treated with broad-
   spectrum antibiotics initially, including Linezolid and
   Ciprofloxacin.  Blood cultures, urine culture, portal
   fluid cultures were followed.

The patient's sputum culture was positive for MRSA and E.
Coli, as above.  His antibiotics were changed to Linezolid,
Gentamicin on [**2173-3-25**] to complete a seven-day course of
Linezolid for the MRSA in the sputum.  Patient's blood
cultures from [**2173-3-28**] returned positive for E. coli and he
had intermittent meropenem added to Gentamicin at that time.
He completed a five-day course of Gentamicin and continues on
meropenem for a 14-day course; last dose to be administered
[**2173-4-11**].

Mr. [**Known lastname 34227**] continued to require vasopressors
intermittently with Levophedrine and Vasopressin until
[**2173-4-3**] and has remained hemodynamically stable throughout
to the time of this dictation.  The underlying etiology of
his continued hypertension was unclear, although it was felt
to be secondary to a combination of septic shock, a
