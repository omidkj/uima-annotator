Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy ([**7-27**])
Tracheostomy tube exchange ([**7-27**])


History of Present Illness:
60 yo with h/o of an elective endoscopy complicated by ARDS, [**Month/Day (4) 16630**]
(Klebsiella and E.Coli - pansensitive), Sepsis, DIC,
tracheostomy, ARF requiring CVVH/HD (now resolved), ventilator
dependence, anemia, H. pylori gastritis/PUD, remote pancreatitis
s/p partial pancreatectomy who was transferred from [**Hospital 100**] rehab
to [**Hospital1 18**] for increasing respiratory support requirements and
fever suspicious for HAP to the rehab physician.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 357**] refer to a detailed D/C summary of [**6-2**] for details of
the complicated course. He was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] with
treatment for HAP, recurrent fevers, persistent anemia,
ventilator dependence, RIJ thrombus on coumadin, resolving
thrombocytopenia and severe steroid/ICU myopathy. He had
developed marked cystic changes on interval CT chest [**7-6**] but
was noted to have improvement in consolidations/ground glass
opacities. Since discharge, he had had moderate success of
weaning from the ventilator (end of [**Month (only) 116**] was on [**5-25**] CPAP
overnight and on trache mask during the day), however, had
developed significant anxiety and felt he could not tolerate
staying off ventilator resulting in tachypnea, low TV requiring
reinitiation of PSV. He was started on Klonopin that was
eventually advanced to 1mg TID (last week) with mild
improvement.
Of note, he developed low grade fevers and tachypnea, requiring
increasing PS and was treated with Vanco/Zosyn x 4 days (started
[**7-4**]) and eventually changed to Levofloxacin for a total of 14d
of ABx completed [**7-18**]. At the same time, underwent further
investigation for low grade fevers with CT abdomen that showed
no signs of infection and had a negative C.Diff x1. As
respiratory status improved, another weaning trial was
attempted, during one of which he developed emesis and likely
aspirated at that time. On [**7-22**] he was found to be tachypneic to
mid 30s, had a repeat CXR that was unchanged and required
increase in PSV to 15/5 from [**6-25**] during that time to maintain
ventilation.
On [**7-23**] at ~ 3am, was noted to have a fever to 102.6F and
developed tachypnea. CXR at [**Hospital1 100**] was unchanged but poor
quality. BCx and CBC were obtained and he was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further evaluation given concern for recurrent infections and
physiatrists suspicion for bronchiolitis/BOOP. There has been no
productive cough, no sputum production, infrequent suctioning
that remained clear. Over the past week, was treated with "cough
medicine" and chloraseptic to provide relief.
In the ED, initial vs were: T100.4F P132 BP103/66 RR 30s O2 sat
100% bagged w/ 100%. Patient was given 4L IVF for SBP nadir of
86 and suspected hypovolemia, he was empirically started on
Vancomycin and Meropenem, Tylenol for temperature of 101F and
WBC of 18K with 7 bands. S/p R femoral placement. VBG showed
7.35/54/118. He received ativan 1mg and APAP 1300mg total while
in ED. He underwent a CT chest which showed "small mixed changes
in a post-ARDS fibrotic phase. some new tree-in-buds, some
decrease of prior consolidation"
Of note, had a L midline placed on [**6-26**]. Had a R arm hematoma
(early [**Month (only) **], not in records) thus discontinued his coumadin.
Required 1U PRBCs. Over the past 10 days has lost 7 pounds,
despite increase in caloric intake via TFs.
He had improved in terms of deconditioning and is now able to
stand and take a few steps with PT.
On the floor, VS were 99F 113 144/86 RR29 and 100% on 70% FiO2.
He appeared ill and diaphoretic, however had no complaints,
including no dyspnea/cp/pressure. He noted feeling air hunger
intemittently over the past 4 days.

[**7-23**] CT Chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. Many focal areas of unchanged scarring in the lungs.
Previously seen LLL focal consolidation has mostly resolved, and
some other areas of opacity have also improved. However, there
are a few new focal tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities, particularly in the
RLL and lingula, which may represent an acute on chronic
infectious process, or perhaps a shifting pattern of chronic
airway inflammation. Tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities can be seen with
bronchiolitis.
2. Interval decrease of now small right-sided pleural effusion.
