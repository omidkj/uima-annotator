History of Present Illness:
76 y/o male with sCHF (EF 35-40%), AS s/p biologic AVR, CAD,
pAF, DMII c/b neuropathy, hypothyroidism and stage III/IV CKD,
with a recent admission for [**Female First Name (un) 564**] fungemia, who presented from
[**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with SOB and altered mental status. He was recently
hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 4108**] with [**Female First Name (un) 564**] fungemia
(no evidence of endophthalmitis and TEE without evidence of
Endocarditis) with a hospital course complicated by a left IJ
DVT (for which he was bridged to Coumadin with Heparin), acute
on CKD (CKD [**1-20**] AIN, most likely [**1-20**] Nafcillin, with baseline
creatinine of ~ 2.3, 2.9 at discharge on [**2124-2-3**]), and a
systolic CHF exacerbation.
.
He was discharged to [**Hospital **] Rehab on [**2124-2-3**]. He states that
since his discharge he has been profoundly short of breath with
minimal exertion, especially over the last few days. He states
that initially he was making good urine to his Lasix 100 mg [**Hospital1 **]
but that one to two days ago he stopped making urine. He was
also noted to be increasingly confused at [**Hospital1 **].
.
On [**2124-2-11**], he was taken to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] Emergency Department for
severe SOB and altered mental status. On arrival to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]
he was noted to be hypotensive. A right IJ central line was
placed and he was given Zosyn and started on Levophed prior to
transfer. A BNP was reportedly 34,000. He was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 86**] for concern for hypotension from CHF vs. sepsis.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, his initial vitals were 97.5, 60, 96/54,
25, 91%on RA. The Levophed was discontinued but his blood
pressure subsequently dropped to 56/46 and the Levophed was
restarted. His CBC was notable for a WBC of 17.9 with 82.1% PMNs
but no bands. His extended chemistry was notable for a potassium
of 5.6, HCO3 of 20, a BUN of 85, a Cr of 4.7, a calcium of 7.6,
and a phosphorus of 9.5. His lactate was 5.2 and his INR was
4.1. A CXR was consistent with pulmonary edema. He received
Vancomycin, zosyn and 100 cc of NS. His vital signs at transfer
were 99/50, 62, 17, 94 on 4L.
.
On arrival to the MICU, his vitals were 96, 64, 113/56 (on 0.12
mcg/kg/min), 24, 97% on 4L. He looked uncomfortable but was in
no apparent distress. He reported the history as detailed above.
He additionally reported a nagging non-productive cough in
addition to his worsening DOE. He denied any recent fevers,
chills, chest pain, palpitations, nausea, vomiting, abdominal
pain, diarrhea, dysuria or hematuria.

MICROBIOLOGY:
Urine cx [**2-12**]: negative
Blood cultures 2/25: pending, negative to date

[**2124-2-12**] ECHO: The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with infero-lateral akinesis and inferior
hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free
wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. A bioprosthetic aortic valve
prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well
seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular
gradients. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

CXR [**2124-2-12**]:
1. Right internal jugular central venous catheter with tip in
the right atrium. Consider retraction by approximately 2-3 cm.
2. Mild interval improvement of pulmonary edema.
3. Bilateral collapse/cponsolidation and possible small
effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
76M with sCHF (EF 35-40%), AS s/p biologic AVR, CAD, pAF, DMII
c/b neuropathy, hypothyroidism and stage III/IV CKD, with a
recent admission for [**Female First Name (un) 564**] fungemia, who presented from [**Hospital1 **]
[**Location (un) 620**] with hypotension and initial concern for sepsis vs. CHF.
 Given concern for possible sepsis, he was continued on
fluconazole, and also started on broad spectrum antibiotics
(vanco/meropenem).  However, fu
