History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 916**] is a 69 year old individual who is s/p CABG/mech AVR on
[**2165-3-26**] who had a complicated post-op course including
pericardial tamponade on POD#3 requiring bedside intervention
who now presents with LLE erythema and a draining wound. He was
discharged to rehab on [**2165-4-15**]. His course in rehab is
significant for diagnosis of multi-drug resistant Klebsiella UTI
on [**4-29**] and a draining LLE incision what was cultured on [**5-4**]
with gram stain revealing beta-hemolytic Staph. As per report,
the leg had been edematous and cellulitic in appearance since
his arrival in rehab. He is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for tachycardia
and hypotension since last night as well as oliguria/anuria for
the
past "3 days".

Past Medical History:
morbid obesity
diabetes mellitus type II
aortic stenosis
coronary artery disease
pericardial tamponade
chronic venous stasis
chronic atrial fibrillation

urinary tract infection
obstructive sleep apnea
post thyroidectomy hypothyroidism

PSH:
Aortic valve replacement(25mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical), aortic root

Ext: LLE with edema, peau d'orange, warmth, erythema; medial
knee
wound with necrotic fat, medial LLE linear wound with necrotic
fat now debrided to fascia, fascia is viable with tracking to
medial knee wound. No bogginess on lateral aspect.

On my serial exams 3 hours apart, the erythema has receded
slightly after abx. and debridement.

Pertinent Results:
[**2165-5-7**] ECHO
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20
%). The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free
wall contractility. A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is
present. The transaortic gradient is normal for this prosthesis
and no significant aortic regurgitation is detected in
suboptimal views. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean
gradient 4mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification. Physiologic
mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is a very
small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs
of tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-4-3**],
left ventricular systolic function is now more depressed (which
may be at least partly due to tachycardia). The right ventricle
now appear dilated with free wall hypokinesis. Estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher. Tricuspid
regurgitation is now more preominent.

[**2165-5-7**] Lower Extremity Ultrasound
Limited study. No DVT identified in either common femoral or
superficial femoral veins bilaterally. Diffuse subcutaneous left
calf edema. A small amount of focal fluid in the left calf is
likely not amenable to percutaneous drainage.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 916**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2165-5-7**] for further
management of his hypotension and likely sepsis. He was
intubated for cardiogenic shock. He was pancultured and
antibiotics were started. The vascular surgery service was
consulted for evaluation of his lower extremity cellulitis. The
wound was debrided at the bedside with drainage of infected
material. The infectios disease service was consulted and
vancomycin and meropenum were continued. Cultures were sent
which showed moderate growth of beta streptococcus. Antibiotics
were switched to penicillin G which a 6 week course was
recommended. Physical therapy worked with him daily. Fluconazole
was given for a groin fungal infection with good results. A VAC
dressing was placed in his leg. Imaging of his leg showed no
evidence of osteomyelitis. A PICC was placed for long term
antibiotics. Coumadin was continued for atrial fibrillation and
a mechanical aortic valve.

Mr. [**Known lastname 916**] continued steady progress. He did remain in the
hospital likely longer then needed due to insurance issues.  He
was discharged to rehab on hospital day 20 with explicit
instructions for follow-up, antibiotic course and wound
management.  He is to continue penicillin G at least through
[**2165-6-5**].  He will see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2165-6-4**] and this date may
be adjusted at that time.
