.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2133-6-8**] demonstrated:
The left atrium is dilated. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is
seen in the body of the left atrium. No mass/thrombus is seen in
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. Moderate to severe
spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial
appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is
seen in the body of the right atrium or the right atrial
appendage. There is mild diastolic bowing of the interatrial
septum suggestive of elevated right atrial pressures. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch and descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.
RENAL ULTRASOUND [**2133-6-9**]:
1. No evidence of hydronephrosis. Bilateral renal cysts.
2. Small amount of ascites around the liver and questionable
right pleural effusion.
.
CT ABD/PELVIS [**2133-6-16**]:
1. Abdominal and pelvic ascites. No secondary signs to
definitely suggest ischemic colitis, although this is a limited
examination secondary to lack of IV contrast administration.
2. Left diaphragmatic hernia with intrathoracic stomach. An
upper GI barium study would allow for evaluation of functional
impairment if clinically warranted. No definite evidence for
obstruction on CT examination.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
4. Sigmoid diverticulosis.
5. Small amount of pelvic ascites and small right inguinal
fluid-containing
hernia.
6. Anasarca.
.
CXR [**2133-6-18**]:
The heart is enlarged, the aorta is tortuous and the hilar
contours are normal. Bibasilar atelectasis is unchanged. There
is increasing moderate right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.
The pacemaker device is in place. IMPRESSION: Increasing
moderate right pleural effusion.
.
CT HEAD [**2133-6-15**]: There is no hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or
shift of normally midline structures. Vertebral artery
calcifications are identified. There is left cerebellar
encephalomalacia, chronic in nature. The white matter is normal
in attenuation. The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and
configuration. There is a right maxillary sinus mucus retention
cyst or polyp (2A:2). The visualized paranasal sinuses are
otherwise clear.
IMPRESSION:
1. No hemorrhage.
2. Left cerebellar encephalomalacia.
3. Vertebral artery calcifications.
4. Single Right maxillary sinus mucus retention cyst or polyp.
.
LIVER ULTRASOUND [**2133-6-15**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Somewhat limited examination secondary to patient body
habitus. If
clinical concern persists, recommend CT imaging for further
evaluation.
2. Small ascites is seen.
3. Right-sided pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
#GI Bleed/Anemia: During MICU stay pt experienced LGI Bld
requiring 1unit of pRBC. for the last week his Hct has remained
stable and his stools have been guaiac negative. Bld occurred
whilst pt had supra therapeutic INR. He will need an outpatient
colonoscopy.

#Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Stage III CKD likely secondary
to chronic HTN. Pt developed acute on chronic renal failure
likely related to ICU status with pancreatitis. Patient now on
dialysis [**Month/Day/Year 766**], Wednesday, Friday access via tunnel catheter
(placed [**7-2**]).

#Diastolic Heart Failure: Prior to this admission, patient had
been experiencing increasing SOB and increasing girth. During
this admission patient developed worsening diastolic heart
failure managed by hemodialysi
