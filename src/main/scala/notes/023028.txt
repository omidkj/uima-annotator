Pertinent Results:
[**2176-5-21**] CT SCan
Multifocal pneumonia. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, likely
reactive. Cardiomegaly. Cholelithiasis.

[**2176-5-28**]- ECHO
Prebypass

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesia of the apical and mid portions of the inferior wall.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed
(LVEF= 40 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was
notified in person of the results on [**5-28**]/2010at 930am.
Suboptimal views.

Post bypass

Patient is A paced and receiving an infusion of phenylephrine.
Biventricular systolic function is unchanged. Mild mitral
regurgitation persists. Aorta is intact post decannulation.

[**2176-5-22**] Carotid Ultrasound
Impression: Right ICA stenosis <40%. Left ICA stenosis <40%.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 13512**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2176-5-22**] via transfer
from [**Hospital6 5016**] for surgical management of his
coronary artery disease. He was worked-up in the usual
preoperative manner including a carotid duplex ultrasound which
showed no significant internal carotid artery disease
bilaterally. Plavix was allowed to clear from his system. On
[**2176-5-28**], Mr. [**Known lastname 13512**] was taken to the operating room where he
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to four vessels.
Please see operative note for details. Postoperatively he was
taken to the intensive care unit for monitoring. Over the next
several hoours, he awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated. Beta blockade, aspirin and a statin were resumed.
Prssors were slowly weaned without issue.

On postoperative day two, he was transferred to the step down
unit for further recovery. His chest tubes and pacing wires were
removed per protocol. He was diuresed toward his pre-operative
weight. He was started on betablockers, niacin, and diuretic.
His preop HgBA1c was elevted at 7.4 and he was followed by
[**Last Name (un) **] team for new diabetes. He was started on metformin and
lantus insulin. On POD#3 he was noted to have erythema at his
left SVG harvest site and was started on keflex with
improvement. He was evaluated by physical therapy for strength
and conditioning and was cleared for discharge to [**Last Name (un) **] by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] on POD#5.
