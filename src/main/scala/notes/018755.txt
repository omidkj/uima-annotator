Service:

This Discharge Summary addendum covers the [**Hospital 228**] hospital
course from [**2139-5-21**] to [**2139-5-25**] at which time he patient was
discharged from the floor to acute rehabilitation.

On the floor the patient had continued modifications of his
congestive heart failure regimen with his Lasix dose
eventually decreased to 80 mg p.o. q.d.  He was also started
on standing potassium and magnesium in the setting of ongoing
diuresis.

The patient's hyponatremia responded well to fluid
restriction to one liter per day.

The patient's platelets stabilized around 110, again off
heparin.

From the infectious disease standpoint the patient's
surveillance blood cultures from [**5-20**] and [**5-21**] remained
negative and the patient has received five days of Gentamicin
overlapped with a two week course of Vancomycin.  The course
of Vancomycin will finish on [**2139-6-2**].

The patient had a PICC line placed on [**2139-5-22**] without
complications.

While on the floor it was observed that the patient had three
episodes of seven to eight beats of NSVT (nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia) with no symptoms.  Given the fact
that he has very mild coronary artery disease and is symptom
free, despite his low ejection fraction, EP consultants felt
that there is no indication for electrical mapping of the
ventricles and possible placement of an AICD at this point.
They recommended EP follow up after the patient's left main
is revascularized.  In the interim they were comfortable with
the current medication regimen.

On [**2139-5-25**] the patient was felt to be stable for discharge to
acute rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSE:
1.      Congestive heart failure secondary to cardiomyopathy
        of unclear etiology, viral versus idiopathic of 10
        to 15 percent at time of discharge with left
        ventricular dilatation.
2.      MRSA bacteremia with negative surveillance culture
        on Vancomycin and Gentamicin.
3.      Mild hyponatremia resolving with fluid restriction
        with serum and urine osmolality suggestive of
        antidiuretic hormone action.
4.      Heparin induced thrombocytopenia type 2.  No
        thrombotic complications observed clinically.

DISCHARGE FOLLOW UP:  Patient should continue to have one
liter per day fluid restriction and will follow up with Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of the heart failure clinic for further management.
An EP referral may be in order as an outpatient.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., Captopril
25 mg p.o. q.d., iron sulfate 325 mg p.o. t.i.d., Lasix 80 mg
p.o. q.d., Aldactone 25 mg p.o. q.d., Protonix 40 mg p.o.
q.d., K-Dur 20 mEq p.o. q.d., magnesium oxide 400 mg p.o.
q.d., Vancomycin 1 gram q 12, last day [**2139-6-2**].
