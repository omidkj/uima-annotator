Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 78**]
Chief Complaint:
lethargy, worsening left weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2106-9-14**]: Right Craniotomy for evacuation of hematoma


History of Present Illness:
70 woman who was diagnosed with breast cancer in [**2104**] with
metastatic spread to bone. The patient is currently on
emcitabine and was to begin cycle 2 on [**9-1**]; however, the
patient
presented to  [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] with complaints of weakness for the
past two days. The weakness has been mainly noticed in the BLE.
Imaging revealed Right SDH and she subsequently underwent a
craniotomy and evacuation of the SDH on [**9-2**]. She was discharged
to rehab. On [**9-13**] she returned to the ED with reported lethargy.
CT scan revealed increasing chronic R SDH with increased MLS.
She
was afebrile and WBC=10, but U/A was positive.

Pertinent Results:
[**2106-9-13**] CT head: IMPRESSION:  Increased size of predominantly
hypodense right cerebral subdural collection, likely a CSF
hygroma, with increased shift of midline structures.  Effacement
of suprasellar cistern is new and compatible with early
transtentorial herniation.

[**2106-9-13**] CXR: Left lower lobe consolidation could be secondary to
pneumonia, aspiration, or atelectasis.  Pleural effusions are
small if any.  Volume overload is mild.  Left-sided Port-A-Cath
ends in cavoatrial junction.  Mediastinal and cardiac contours
are normal.

[**2106-9-14**] CT head postop: Decreased right subdural collection, now
consisting of fluid and air, with improvement in associated mass
effect. No new hemorrhage.

[**2106-9-15**] Chest Xray:FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous
radiograph, the pre-existing bilateral pleural effusions have
increased.  Also increased are the signs suggestive of moderate
pulmonary edema.  Increase in extent of the pre-existing
retrocardiac atelectasis.  Unchanged mild cardiomegaly.

Cardiovascular Report ECG Study Date of [**2106-9-15**]  1:58:56 PM
Sinus rhythm with premature atrial contractions. Diffuse
non-spefific
ST-T wave changes. Low voltage in the axial leads. Compared to
the previous tracing of [**2104-8-25**] the heart rate is slower and the
T wave inversion in  leads V2-V3 is more prominent. Clinical
correlation is suggested.

Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF 65%). The right ventricular free wall thickness is
normal. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed
free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen (may be underestimated due
to the suboptimal nature of this study). There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.


CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2106-9-16**] 11:37 AM

FINDINGS:  The right-sided subdural drainage catheter has been
removed.  There is no change in the size of the subdural
hematoma.  There has been reduction in extra-axial
pneumocephalus when compared to the prior study.  The leftward
shift of midline structures is unchanged, approximately 6 mm.
The ventricular size and configuration is unchanged from the
prior study.  There is no evidence of new hemorrhage or acute
vascular territorial infarction.  The imaged portion of the
mastoid air cells and paranasal sinuses are well aerated.

IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change since removal of the
right
subdural drainage catheter.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2106-9-17**] 4:25 AM

Mild pulmonary edema has improved, now persisting mainly at the
lung bases.  Moderate left pleural effusion stable.  Heart size
normal.  No pneumothorax.  Infusion port catheter ends in the
low SVC.  Heart size normal.  No pneumothorax.

[**9-17**] CT Head- 1.  Status post evacuation of the right subdural
hemorrhage. Minimally increased right lateral ventricular
effacement and increased size of the right subdural collection
by measurements. This may be technical as there are no new
hyperdense blood products, but small interval reaccumulation
cannot be entirely excluded.

COMMENTS ON ATTENING REVIEW: There is interval enlargement of
the right
epidural fluid collection underlying the craniotomy flap, which
explains the slightly increased effacement of the right lateral
ventricle, compression of the third ventricle, and slightly
increased leftward shift of midline structures. The right
subdural fluid collection is stable.

[**9-18**] EEG: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU
monitoring study because of continuous focal slowing and
attenuation of faster frequencies in the right hemisphere. There
are occasional runs of very rhythmic delta activity or sharp and
slow wave discharges in the right posterior quadrant which do
not clearly involved in frequency or field. These findings are
indicative of a highly potentially epileptogenic focal
structural lesion in the right posterior quadrant. The
background on the left shows mixed theta and delta activity,
suggesting moderate diffuse encephalopathy. There are no
definite electrographic seizures.

[**9-18**] CT Head: IMPRESSION:
1.  Increased right epidural fluid collection underlying the
right craniotomy flap, compared to [**2106-9-16**], with associated
increased effacement of the right lateral ventricle, compression
of the third ventricle, and slightly increased leftward shift of
midline structures.
2.  Stable right subdural fluid collection.

[**9-18**] CXR: NG tube tip is coiled in the stomach that is
intrathoracic in a moderate hiatal hernia, the tip projects at
the level of the hemidiaphragm .  Cardiac size is top normal,
accentuated by low lung volumes.  Port-A-Cath is in standard
position.  Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions with
adjacent atelectases are unchanged allowing the difference in
positioning of the patient.  Of note, the atelectasis in the
right lower lobe has minimally increased.  Mild-to-moderate
pulmonary edema is stable.
