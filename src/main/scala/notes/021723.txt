Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
metoprolol / Fosamax

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2186**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension, altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Blood transfusion [**2153-8-8**]
L IJ placement

History of Present Illness:
81-year-old female with history of atrial fibrillation, CHF s/p
mitral and tricuspid annuloplasty [**2-/2153**] c/b ACA infarct and
recent resistant proteus mirabilis UTI presenting from rehab
with altered mental status and hypotension. Per her husband,
patient was in her usual state of health until this morning when
she became minimally responsive. En route to the hospital, she
became more interactive with EMS, but has remained somnolent and
confused. In the ED, triage vital signs were P90 55/36 R30 98%.
MAPs remained in the 50s despite 4L NS and levophed was started
peripherally. She was also noted to have several episodes of
bradycardia to the 30s with spontaneous resolution. A right IJ
was attempted but not obtained and a left IJ was placed. VBG
7.31/50/32 on RA, lactate 3.1. UA showed 39 RBC and >189 WBC and
ceftriaxone 1g was given based on sensitivities from her prior
admission.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS 97.5 P77 BP 95/63 R 14 97%
RA.

Microbiology:
Blood cultures 9/12: pending
Urine culture [**8-8**]:  mixed bacterial [**Month/Year (2) **]
Stook [**8-8**]: negative for C. diff

Imaging:
CXR [**8-8**]: There is interval placement of a left internal jugular
catheter
with tip terminating in the upper SVC.  There is no
pneumothorax.
Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are stable.  There is
stable scarring or atelectasis at the left lung base as well as
calcifications at the costochondral junction.  The lungs are
otherwise clear. IMPRESSION:  New left IJ catheter with tip in
the upper SVC, no pneumothorax.

CT head w/o contrast [**8-8**]: Evolution with encephalomalacia due
to a prior left ACA infarction, without evidence of hemorrhage
or new infarction.

EEG [**2153-8-9**]: This is an abnormal waking EEG because of frequent
intermittent left temporal slowing with moderate amplitude
polymorphic delta and theta. These findings are indicative of
subcortical dysfunction over left temporal region but of
non-specific etiology

TTE [**2153-8-9**]: The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed (LVEF = 45 %) secondary to
ventricular interaction, with a pressure/volume overloaded right
ventricle. The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The
right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present. The
gradients are higher than expected for this type of prosthesis
(at heart rates 110-120 beats per minute). The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. A tricuspid valve annuloplasty
ring is present. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
tricuspid regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2153-7-25**], the apparent pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is significantly increased. Ventricular interaction is
more prominent.

CXR [**8-9**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change.  There is no right pneumothorax after failed internal
jugular vein
catheter placement.  No evidence of mediastinal widening.  No
other changes.  The previously placed left internal jugular vein
catheter has been removed.

Brief Hospital Course:
81-year-old female history of atrial fibrillation, CHF s/p
mitral and tricuspid annuloplasty [**2-/2153**] c/b ACA infarct
presenting from rehab with AMS and hypotension following a
syncopal episode, transferred to the ICU for hypotension
requiring pressor support.

Active Issues:
#Hypotension/Shock: Initial SBP 50s was minimally responsive to
fluid resuscitation and levophed was started in the ED. Lactate
was elevated at 3.1. Initially suspicious for septic shock from
presumed
