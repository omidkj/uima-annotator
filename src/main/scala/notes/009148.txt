Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea on exertion


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
 [**2125-7-16**] AVR (27 mm CE Magna pericardial)/CABG x4
(LIMA to LAD, SVG to DIAG, SVG to OM, SVG to PDA)

History of Present Illness:
71 year old male has a history of
chronic renal insufficiency, aortic valve disease and s/p RCA
stenting in [**2119**] and stenting x 2 of the proximal and mid LAD
with Xience drug eluting stents in [**2123**]. His [**Location (un) 109**] by
catheterization last year was noted at 1.5cm2. He reports about
one year of dyspnea on exertion that is sometimes associated
with
lightheadedness. Currently he becomes short of breath after
walking 20 feet at a fast pace or with raking for 10 minutes. He
also reports a recent evaluation at a hospital in [**Location (un) 24402**] for
chest pain that resolved with nitroglycerin. He apparently ruled
out for an MI and was discharged to home. His most recently
cardiac testing was done in [**Month (only) 958**] and [**2125-3-30**] while down
in
[**State 108**]. Nuclear stress testing revealed mild anterior ischemia
and an LVEF of 34%. An echo showed a severely enlarged LV at
6.3cm with an LVEF of 55% and an aortic valve area of 0.7cm2. He
was referred for cardiac catheterization to assess
his coronary arteries and the severity of his aortic valve
stenosis. He is now being referred to cardiac surgery for
revascularization and aortic valve replacement.

Pertinent Results:
Echocardiogram: [**7-16**]
Conclusions
PRE BYPASS The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left
atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 25-30 %). The inferior wall demonstrates the most severe
hypokinesis but all of the other segments are moderately to
severely depressed. The right ventricular free wall demonstrates
borderline normal free wall function. There are simple atheroma
in the aortic arch. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly
dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve
area 0.7 cm2). Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a very small pericardial
effusion. There is a globular mass about 1 cm in diamter seen in
the pericardial space between the left atrial appendage and
ascending aorta. It may represent epicardial fat but clinical
correlation is suggested. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of
the results in the operating room at the time of the study.
POST BYPASS The patient is being AV paced. Epinephrine is being
administered by IV infusion. There is normal right ventricular
systolic function. The left ventricle displays improved systolic
function of all segments. The inferior wall displays moderate
hypokinesis. The septum displays a "bounce" likely secondary to
ventricular pacing. The other segments display borderline normal
systolic function. Left ventricular ejection fraction is about
40%. There is a bioprosthesis located in the aortic position. It
appears well seated and there is normal leaflet function. The
maximum gradient across the valve was 15 mmHg with a mean of 8
mmHg at a cardiac output of about 6 liters/minute. No aortuic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation is improved -
now mild. The thoracic aorta is intact after decannulation.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was a same day admission for AVR/CABG  with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 914**]. Please see operative report for details, in summmary he
had:
1. Aortic valve replacement with a 27-mm [**Doctor Last Name **] Magna Ease
aortic valve bioprosthesis (serial # [**Serial Number 88945**], Model # 3300TFX
2. Coronary bypass grafting x4: Left internal mammary artery to
left anterior descending coronary; reverse saphenous vein single
graft from aorta to the first    diagonal coronary artery;
reverse saphenous vein single graft from aorta to the first
obtuse marginal coronary; as well as reverse saphenous vein
single graft from aorta to posterior descending coronary artery.
3. Endoscopic left greater saphenous vein harvesting.
4. Epiaortic duplex scanning.
His bypass time was 152 minutes with a crossclamp of 124
minutes. He tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively
was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition on Propofol and
Epinephrine infusions, for recovery and invasive monitoring. He
remained hemodynamically stable in the immediate post-op period,
woke neurologically intact and was extubated. POD 1 found the
patient alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.  The
patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable, he
weaned  from inotropic and vasopressor support. Beta blockade
was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward the
preoperative weight.  Norvasc was resumed for hemodynamic
control.  The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for
further recovery. All tubes lines and drains were removed per
cardiac surgery protocol. He developed atrial fibrillation.
Amiodarone was started and beta blocker titrated.  He converted
to Sinus Rhythm within hours.  He develped
