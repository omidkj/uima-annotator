HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 40-year-old
female with a history of C3-C4 spinal cord lesion leading to
quadriplegia, who was admitted initially for a history of
desaturation to 85%, oxygen saturation on room air, and with
increased somnolence.  Also, of note, the patient has been
intubated five times during the past month.;  Most recently,
the patient has been treated for MRSA in the sputum.  The
most recent hospital admission prior to this admission was
between [**6-5**] and [**6-7**], during which time she was
intubated for respiratory distress and hypercarbic
respiratory failure.  During that admission, the patient's
sputum was MRSA positive.  She was treated with Vancomycin.

Previous admission had been between [**4-7**] to [**2145-4-12**] for
which she was intubated for approximately 36 hours for
hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Previous to that she had
been admitted between [**2145-2-28**] to [**2145-3-10**] at the [**Hospital 882**]
Hospital for a right lower lobe pneumonia, which had required
intubation.  The patient was noted to be MRSA positive at
that time.  She was intubated for approximately seven days
and at that time she refused the placement of her
tracheostomy or PEG.  During this admission, the patient, as
noted, has increased shortness of breath and decreased oxygen
saturations with saturations in the 80s.  She was able to
speak in full sentences at this time, but she was noted to
have slightly labored breathing.  Blood pressure was at her
baseline admission value of 90/60.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  C3-C4 spinal cord lesion in [**2139**], status post motor
vehicle accident.
2.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
3.  Depression.
4.  Chronic adrenal insufficiency from chronic steroid use.
5.  History of anemia.
6.  History of heel osteomyelitis.

intubations during the last nine months.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has been a resident at the
[**Hospital 33091**] Rehabilitation Service.  Her mother is involved in
her care.  She has a history of smoking in the past.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the following on
admission:  The patient was a female in no acute distress,
who was alert and oriented times three.  Temperature was
98.5, pulse 64, blood pressure 110/57, saturation 90% on room
air.  HEENT:  Notable for clear oropharynx with positive gag
reflex.  NECK:  Examination was supple.  LUNGS:  Lungs were
notable for diffuse and coarse rhonchi bilaterally.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs,
rubs, or gallops.  ABDOMEN:  Benign.  EXTREMITIES:  1+ edema.
The patient was alert and oriented times three.  The patient
also had decubitus ulcers.  The patient had an ischial wound,
stage 2, with granulation approximately 3 cm deep.  The
patient also had an area on the posterior thoracic region of
her skin, which was approximately 4 cm x 4 cm with an eschar.
NEUROLOGICAL:  Examination was notable for quadriplegia.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data on admission revealed the
following:  White count 9.3, hematocrit 26.3, platelet count
116,000, coagulations and BMP was within normal limits.  The
bicarbonate was 26.  The patient had a urinalysis, which was
notable for nitrate positive, large leukocyte Estrace
positive, as well as 3 to 5 white blood cells and many
bacteria.  EKG:  Sinus rhythm with no acute ST or T segment
changes.  Chest x-ray:  The patient had a persistent left
lower lobe opacity, which was similar to a previous chest
x-ray on [**2145-5-28**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient, initially, was admitted to the
Intensive Care Unit for observation.  During this time, the
patient was noted to have good oxygen saturations of 95%, 98%
on room air.  The patient's blood pressure has been in the
range of the 90s to 110 systolic blood pressure, which is
near her baseline blood pressure.

The patient also completed her 14-day course of Vancomycin
during this admission.  Regarding the patient's pulmonary
status during this admission she also had been given chest PT
to help with her secretions.  Albuterol and Atrovent were
also continued.

INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient has been completing a course
of Vancomycin for MRSA in her sputum for 14 days, which had
been completed upon admission.  The patient also was noted to
have UTI by urinalysis and she was started on a 7-day course
of Ciprofloxacin for the UTI.  During the admission, the
patient spiked a fever to 101.2.  The patient has been
afebrile for 36 hours and the patient's blood cultures and
urine cultures have no growth to date.

ENDOCRINE:  The patient was admitted with a history of
chronic adrenal insufficiency and she was given stress dose
steroids of 100 mg hydrocortisone in the emergency room.  The
patient continued on her pre-admission regimen of
Prednisone  5 mg PO q.d. afterwards.

GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient has history of reflux, so we
continued Protonix for that.  The patient also was treated
with Reglan and Colace for promotility and stool softening.

DECUBITUS ULCERS:  The patient was seen by the Plastic
Service during this admission and they noted that she had the
left ischial wound stage II with approximately 3 cm
granulation tissue, as well as the left posterior thoracic
area with some skin breakdown with approximately 4 cm x 4 cm.
They felt that at this time that these wounds did not need to
be debrided.  They recommended b.i.d. wet-to-dry dressing
changes in the ischial wound.  They recommended wet-to-dry
changes to the left back wound.  They also noted an area of
early breakdown on the right ischemic, for which they
recommended DuoDerm dressing.

In addition, the patient, during this admission, was screened
for rehabilitation and currently the plan is to return to
Brick Farm and at that time the patient will have further
placement and screening from there.
