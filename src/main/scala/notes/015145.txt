worsening abdominal pain.  The pain was most severe last night,
when the patient became nauseous and lightheaded, and almost

underwent EGD that showed evidence of ulceration with overlying
clot at the gastrojejunostomy site, with surrounding erythema,
friability, and few erosions.  The area was injected with 5cc of
epinephrine and electrocaudery was applied.  She had several
tarry BMs in the ED, had a Hct drop to 24, and was transfused
PRBCs.

Of note, the patient was previously hospitalized in [**3-3**] for
acute abdominal pain, with EGD that showed para-anastomotic

remaining from the bypass.  She was followed medically, which
required high doses of narcotics.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. GI bleed: Pt admitted to floor, started on IVFs, protonix,
with close Hct monitoring.  On the floor, she had a large BM and
BRBPR that was concerning for rebleeding.  Her Hct was not
appropriately increasing following transfusions, and she was
evaluated for possible MICU transfer.  During this time, she was
followed by surgery, who did not intervene, and GI, who felt
that the bleed was likely from para-anastamotic ulcers, and took
her to the endoscopy lab for EGD. She spent 1 night in the MICU
for observation, and was then transferred back to the floor.
Her Hct was stable following, and her abdominal exam was benign
throughout the admission.  GI ultimately decided to have pt go
out on [**Hospital1 **] protonix and sucralfate, with trial of ursodiol and
encouraged to stop smoking.  Per GI, she may ultimately a
surgical revision.

2. Pain control: Felt to have a possible element of anxiety.
She was given morphine, as well as oxycodone and oxycontin
throughout.

3. Anxiety: Persistent insomnia unrelieved with ambien or
ativan.

4. Hx of PE: No events. Placed on pneumoboots.
