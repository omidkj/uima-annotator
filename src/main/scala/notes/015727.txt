Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Lisinopril

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of subclavian dual chamber pacemaker


History of Present Illness:
80-year-old Russian-speaking woman with aortic stenosis status
post aortic valve repair, presenting with dyspnea and complete
heart block. She underwent aortic valve replacement and septal
myectomy in [**2126**], then subsequently developed aortic
insufficiency and recurrent aortic stenosis. Her activity has
been limited by her AS to about [**Age over 90 **] yards of walking. Today her
home health aide found her dizzy and short of breath. EMS was
called and found her to be in complete heart block on ECG. She
was given atropine and brought to the ED.

In the ED, initial vitals were HR 42, BP 100/80. She was short
of breath at rest, but concious and mentating well. She appeared
somewhat volume overloaded. She was given 2L of IV fluids. EP
was consulted and recommended pacemaker placement in the
morning. A temporary wire was not necessary at this time due to
her narrow complex and hemodynamic stability. On admission, her
vitals were 97.8-38-102/56 to 87/65-20-99% 2LNC.

In the CCU, she is dyspneic with any movement, but comfortable
at rest. She is mentating well. She was given 20mg IV lasix
immediately and a foley was placed for UOP monitoring.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
 ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope

EKG on adm: Sinus rhythm. Complete heart block. Junctional
escape rhythm at 42 beast per minute. QRS complexes suggest left
ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization changs. Possible
digoxin effect. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2127-10-28**]
third degree A-V block has appeared. Repolarization changes
secondary to left ventricular hypertrophy are more marked.

Imaging:
[**5-5**] TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF 70%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. A bioprosthetic aortic valve
prosthesis is present. A paravalvular aortic valve leak is
probably present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is severe
mitral annular calcification. There is mild functional mitral
stenosis (mean gradient 8 mmHg) due to mitral annular
calcification. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due
to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may
be significantly UNDERestimated.] Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2129-1-14**], mild mitral stenosis is now present.

[**5-5**] CXR: There is small left apical pneumothorax. The pacemaker
leads are
unremarkable. They are projecting over the expected location of
right atrium and right ventricle. No pleural effusion is seen.
Cardiomegaly is stable.  Lungs are essentially clear.
.
[**5-7**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**5-6**], there is little
change.
Pacer leads remain in position. No evidence of acute focal
pneumonia or
vascular congestion. Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
persists

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY:  80-year-old woman with history of HTN, HLD, CAD s/p
stenting [**2124**] and aortic stenosis s/p aortic valve repair [**2126**],
admitted for shortness of breath, found to be in complete heart
block, s/p subclavian dual chamber pacemaker on [**2130-5-5**]
.
# Bradycardia:  ECG revealed complete heart block.  Initially,
patient was stable, and a non-emergent subclavian dual chamber
ppm was placed on [**2130-5-5**].  Post-procedure course was
complicated by a very small apical pneumothorax, which remained
stable.  The patient was given peri-procedure antibiotics, and
will complete a course of keflex for prophylaxis.
.
# SOB:  Most likely due to volume overload from fluids given in
the ED and CHF from her complete heart block.  Improved with
gentle diuresis and ppm placement. Patient was ambulating with
O2 sats >94% on room air prior to discharge
.
# HTN ?????? was on nifedipine, atenolol and valsartan.  Initially
held and were restarted prior to discharge. Could consider
changing atenolol to a different medication on an outpatient
basis.
.
# CAD s/p stenting in [**2124**]:  Aspirin, Rosuvastatin were
continued - patient was chest pain free this admission.
.
# Osteoporosis: continued calcium and vitamin d supplementation
.
# HLD:  Continued Rosuvastatin Calcium (Crestor) 20mg daily
.
=============
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-Needs f/u in device clinic 1 week after discharge
-Consider changing atenolol to alternative [**Doctor Last Name 360**] as an
outpatient
