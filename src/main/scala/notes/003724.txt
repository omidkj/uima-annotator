Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 1007**] was seen by Neurosurgery and taken emergently to the OR
to undergo a left sided craniotomy for evacuation of left sided
subdural hematoma and partial lobectomy.  Post operatively he
did not respond to any painful stimuli until approx 24 hours
post operatively.  He would attempt to localize his right arm
and infrequently his left arm with very little movemment of his
lower extremeties.  His immediate post op course was complicated
by high fevers with only source was HFlu in his sputum.

His post operative CT that showed extensive hemorrhagic
contusion within the left temporal lobe, a large quantity of
pneumocephalus within the left frontal region, as well was as
within an apparent partially evacuated left cerebral convexity
subdural hematoma. There does appear to be persistent mass
effect, as well as continued rightward subfalcine herniation.

An EEG showed some generalized slowing.

His exam continued to show roving eye movement, occasional eye
opening, localizing on right>left.  On [**7-30**] a CT showed some
increase mass effect causing midline shift.

His family was adament that Mr [**Known lastname 1007**] would not want a Trach or
PEG or 24 hour nursing care on [**8-1**] they made him CMO.  He was
started on a Morphine drip and passed away on [**8-2**].
