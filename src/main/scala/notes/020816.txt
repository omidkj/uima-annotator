History of Present Illness:
79 yo male with PMH of HTN, critical AS, AFib, remote
pancreatitis, and aortic aneurysm who presented to [**Hospital3 635**]
hospital on [**2100-12-26**] with weakness and RUQ pain. He was found to
be anemic, tachycardic, and had an INR of 5.5. He was given
blood, fluids, FFP and had a CT scan at the OSH which showed
stranding of the tail and mid body of the pancreas with
overlying hematoma. A visceral angiogram performed showed no
active bleeding or vascular abnormality to explain the bleeding.
The patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.

On transfer ([**2101-1-4**]), the patient was afebrile, tachycardic to
116, abdomen nontender, and AxO x 1. The patient was started on
clears which he tolerated well.

Upon transfer to medicine, the patient was made NPO again due to
abdominal pain and distension. He was felt to be clinically
stable and did not require surgical intervention. He was on a
diltiazem gtt initially for his Afib in the SICU, but was
converted to a PO regimen prior to transfer with decent rate
control. The patient states that he continues to have abdominal
discomfort, but he is hungry. He is a poor historian due to his
dementia.

Since his admission he has been receiving rate control with
dilt. He has required nasal cannula (2-4L) during his stay. He
was found to have 5/5 blood cultures positive for coag neg staph
and has been treated with vancomycin. He had a TTE that was
negative for endocarditis but did confirm that he had critical
AS. He has run I/O approximately even the past 24 hours.
Yesterday he was intermittently dropping his O2sats to upper 80s
which would resolve quickly with nebs. His O2 requirement was 4L
NC. This morning ~6:30am he was receiving his morning dose of
dilt and was soon thereafter to be more short of breath (~within
30minutes). No cough or choking was witnessed.

His remained hypoxic requiring NRB. His vitals prior to transfer
were
97F 120/84 112 25 97%NRB.  He states that his breathing was
difficult. He denies chest pain or cough. He denies abd pain.

Of note he had a PICC that was placed at the OSH that has since
been removed after the blood cultures were resulted as positive.
He is also day 3 of levofloxacin therapy for a potential
aspiration pneumonia.

EKG: afib @114 leftward axis. LVH with repolarization changes.
slow Rwave progression. no change from prior

Imaging:
[**2101-1-5**] CT abd/pelvis - .
1Severe pancreatitis associated with a hemorrhagic pseudocyst
within the gastric wall, without evidence of vascular
complication. A component of necrosis cannot be excluded.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions and ascites, a component of which
is
loculated.
3. Aneurysms of the ascending thoracic and infrarenal abdominal
aorta.
4. Extensive coronary artery and aortic valvular calcifications.

5. Small focus of consolidation within the right upper lobe.
Early pneumonia cannot be excluded and attention is recommended
on followup studies.

[**2101-1-7**] TTE - The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 60-70%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetations seen. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function. Severe calcific aortic
stenosis. Mild mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension. Dilated thoracic aorta

CXR:
[**2101-1-7**] -
1. Mild CHF, essentially unchanged since the prior study.
2. Mildly dilated loops of small bowel. Clinical correlation is
advised.
3. A persistent left retrocardiac opacity.
[**2101-1-8**] - (unofficial) underpenetrated film. worsening bilat
edema with [**Hospital1 **]-basilar atelectasis. marked enlarged stomach
bubble


Brief Hospital Course:
79 yo male with h/o HTN, critical AS, dementia who presents with
hemorrhagic pancreatitis, found to have coag neg staph
bacteremia (treated with vancomycin), elevated bilirubin, atrial
fibrillation, acute renal failure and ileus transferred to MICU
for respiratory distress and worsening hypoxia.  Imaging
revealed b/l pleural effusions.  B/L thoracenteses revealed
exudative effusion on the left and serosanguinous fluid on the
right.  His respiratory status declined, felt likely due to
complication of pancreatitis and volume overload, while in
setting of critical AS.

On [**2101-1-20**], the family decided that the patient would not want
a prolonged illness and a decision was made to make the patient
DNR/DNI and comfort measures only.  The patient was made
comfortable and expired at 1:57pm on [**2101-1-20**].  The family
declined autopsy.
