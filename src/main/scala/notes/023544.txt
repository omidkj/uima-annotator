Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
68 yo male with h/o bladder CA presenting with STEMI.  Patient
reports that he developed severe heartburn 3 days ago which
began when he was lying down in bed.  The pain radiated down
both arms and to his jaw and occasionally to his back.  He
denies any associated shortness of breath.  The pain was
relieved with slow deep breathing and sitting up in bed. Patient
reports that he did not have the pain during the day until this
morning, when he got out of bed, and the pain did not improve.
He called his sister who has bad heartburn and she explained
that his symptoms were not consistent with her usual symptoms,
and so he called 911.
.
In the ED, patient had marked anterior ST elevations and a code
STEMI was called.  Patient received 325mg ASA, 600mg
Clopidogrel, Nitro gtt, Integrillin gtt, Heparin gtt, IV
metoprolol and was taken to the cath lab.
.
In the cath lab, patient had evidence of three vessel disease
with total mid-vessel occlusion of the LAD, 90% mid-vessel
occlusion of left circumflex and 80% occlusion of the RCA. Two
bare metal stents were placed in the mid-LAD. There was a
significant anterior thigh hematoma without active
extravasation.  The arterial site was closed with angioseal and
a compressive fem-stop was placed.
.
On arrival to the CCU, patient reported no ongoing chest pain.
He was awake and alert. Approximately 1 hour after arrival,
patient had recurrence of chest pain, [**4-8**], with diaphoresis.
No changes on EKG.

Cardiac catheterization:
1.  The LMCA was normal in appearence.  The LAD had diffuse
disease proximally, with mid-vessel total occlusion.  The LCx
had a 90% mid vessel narrowing.  The RCA was also diffusly
disease, with an 80% mid vessel stenosis.
2.  Limited resting hemodynamcis revealed normal systemic blood
pressure, with a central aortic pressure of 116/51mmHg.  There
was no
transvalvular gradient across the aortic valve to suggest aortic

stenosis.
3.  Two bare metal stents were placed in the mid-LAD.

ECHO ([**2142-8-27**]):  The left atrium is mildly dilated. A color
Doppler flow signal c/w a small secundum atrial septal defect is
seen with left-to-right flow. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the
distal half of the anterior and anterolateral walls, distal
inferior wall. The apex is mildly aneurysmal and dyskinetic. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 35 %). A mural
apical thrombus cannot be fully excluded (clips 71, 72).
Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic
function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is an anterior space
which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (mid-LAD
distribution). Mild mitral regurgitation with normal valve
morphology. Possible mural apical LV thrombus.  If clinically
indicated, a follow-up study with Definity contrast is
suggested.

POST CONTRAST ECHO:  The left ventricular apex is mildly
aneurysmal and dyskinetic. No discrete masses or thrombi is
seen.

CXR ([**2142-8-27**]):  The lung volumes are normal. There is minimal
atelectasis at both the right and the left lung bases. No
evidence of pulmonary edema. Normal size of the cardiac
silhouette. Minimal tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. No pleural
effusions. No evidence of pneumonia.
