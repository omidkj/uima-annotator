History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 78 year old gentleman with CAD s/p CABG in [**2164**],
s/p PCI in [**2169**], chronic stable angina, COPD and GERD who
experienced onset of severe substernal chest pain at 12:30 am on
the morning of [**10-13**]. Pain radiated only to his left arm.
A call was placed to his cardiologist who instructed him to take

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Branch vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Patent LIMA to LAD with excellent flow via a native LAD.
3. Patent SVG to RCA with an excellent competitive flow via a
native
RCA.
4. Ulcerated lesion in SVG to OM.
5. Known occlusion of jump graft to D1.
6. Mildly elevated LV filling pressure.
7. Two drug eluting stents placed to SVG-OM graft.
.
[**2178-10-14**] ECHO:
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a fat pad..

Brief Hospital Course:
78 y/o M with CAD, s/p CABG who presented with unstable angina
and underwent PCI with successful stenting of an occluded
SVG-->OM graft, procedure complicated by new T-wave inversions
on post cath EKG with persistent chest pain x several hours,
likely due to thromboembolic shower. Hospital course complicated
by developmenyt of atrial flutter and foley catheter trauma with
persistent hematuria.
.
#) Cardiac:
(a) Vessels: Patient was taken to cath lab with placement of
cyper stent x 2 in SVG to OM. Thromboembolic shower likely
explains patient's post cath EKG changes and chest pain. EKG
changes resolved on serial EKGs and chest pain resolved on nitro
gtt, able to be weaned off on post-cath day #1. Cardiac enzymes
climbed post-catheterization, as expected iwth microemboli, but
peaked and then trended downwards. He received Integrillin gtt x
18 hours. He was then managed medically with aspirin, a statin,
plavix, isosorbide mononitrate, and ranolzazine. Beta-blocker
was held given persistent bradycardia (was borderline
bradycardic at baseline prior to cath).
.
(b) Rhythm/A-flutter: Patient with sinus bradycardia post-cath.
Patient reports baseline HR 50-60. Beta blockade ws held. On
post cath day #1 patient developed atrial flutter with variable
3-4:1 block. He was entirely asymptomatic and HR was in the
60-80s. He was placed on a heparin gtt while bridging to
coumadin. He underwent a TEE which showed no [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 7388**], and he was
then cardioverted. Follow-up EKG demonstrated NSR.
.
(c) Pump: LVEF 50-55% TTE. No CHF issues.
.
#) Hematuria: Patient failed initial vioding trial and so Foley
was replaced. While in bed patient accidentally pulled on Foley
and had subsequent hematuria. This persisted despite frequent NS
foley flushes. Clots were removed during flushes. Urology was
consulted who recommended against constant bladder irrigation,
recommending just prn flushes. The hematuria was also felt to be
exacerbated in part by his systemic anticiagulation with heparin
while awaiting cardioversion. He was scheduled for outpatient
urologic followup with his primary urologist.
.
#) Hypertension: well-controlled on medical therapy.
.
#) CRI: Baseline Cr 1.2 - 1.3. Remained at or better than
baseline throughout stay with no evidence of post-cath CIN.
.
#) COPD: albuterol PRN
.
#) FEN: Cardiac diet.
.
#) Code Status: Full code.
