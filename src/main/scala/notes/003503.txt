NOTE:  This is an interim Discharge Summary through today
([**2188-4-18**]), and there will be a further Discharge
Summary required.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  This is a 58-year-old Caucasian female who
presents with hypoxia, and mental status changes, and
hypercapnia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 58-year-old female
with a history of morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea,
and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who presents with
hypoxia, per [**Hospital6 407**].  The patient had
been found by [**Hospital6 407**] on the morning of
admission confused, with shortness of breath, and an oxygen
saturation of 79% on room air.  The patient initially
reported a sore throat, tightness, and chest pain which was
not reported by the patient on presentation to the Emergency
Department.

Ms. [**Known lastname **] had recently been admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] a few days before with a workup for
subacute renal failure.  At that time, it was decided that
Ms. [**Known lastname 34727**] renal failure was likely secondary to
hypovolemia.  She was given intravenous fluids, and her usual
dose of 80 mg p.o. of Lasix b.i.d. was held.  The patient's
creatinine peaked around 4.1, and at discharge was 2.9.

Currently, the patient is disoriented, awake, and alert.  She
has no complaints of chest pain, nausea, vomiting,
diaphoresis, sore throat or shortness of breath.  In the
Emergency Department, she was given Levaquin 500 mg p.o.
q.d., Lasix 40 mg intravenously times one, Solu-Medrol 120 mg
times one, albuterol nebulizers, bicarbonate, D-50, and
intravenous insulin.  This was in response to a white blood
cell count of 8.4, potassium of 6.1, and a blood urea
nitrogen of 54, and creatinine of 2.6.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Morbid obesity, weight of greater than 400 pounds.
2.  Obstructive sleep apnea.
3.  Cor pulmonale; echocardiogram in [**2188-1-12**] showed
an ejection fraction of greater than 50%.  There was also
right atrial and ventricular dilatation, and severe global
right ventricular hypokinesis.  There was also abnormal right
ventricular wall motion abnormalities.  There was 4+
tricuspid regurgitation.  Dobutamine MIBI on [**2187-3-30**] showed no defects.
4.  Osteoarthritis/rheumatoid arthritis.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Peptic ulcer disease.
7.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  The patient has a
72-pack-year smoking history, but no pulmonary function tests
in the record.  There is a history of intubation in the past,
and she requires home oxygen of 2 liters to 3 liters.  Her
baseline bicarbonate was noted to be 48 to 50.
8.  Renal insufficiency with a creatinine of 0.7 up until
[**2187-9-12**], and since then has been 2 to 4.

ALLERGIES:  DEMEROL and CASHEWS.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications at home include
Flovent 4 puffs b.i.d., Combivent 2 puffs q.i.d.,
albuterol 2 puffs q.i.d., Vioxx 25 mg p.o. q.d.,
trazodone 100 mg p.o. q.d., Prozac 20 mg p.o. q.d.,
Plaquenil 200 mg p.o. q.d., Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.,
Detrol 2 mg p.o. b.i.d., glucosamine 100 mg p.o. q.d.,

digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d., Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d., and
K-Dur 20 mg p.o. q.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed a temperature of 98, pulse of 100,
blood pressure of 164/90, respiratory rate of 20, satting 96%
on 50% face mask.  In general, she was a very morbidly obese
Caucasian female in moderate respiratory distress.  Skin was
pink.  On neck examination unable to assess.  On
cardiovascular examination difficult to hear heart sounds.
Second heart sound and second heart sound, tachycardic.
Lungs were clear to auscultation anteriorly and laterally.
The abdomen was obese, nontender and nondistended, positive
bowel sounds.  Extremities revealed some breakdown of the
skin at the ankles.  Pretibial edema was present.
Neurologically, cranial nerves II through XII were intact
bilaterally.  Moved all four extremities and followed
commands.  Thought that the year was 200; had no response to
date.  She noted location was the hospital, but not that it
was [**Hospital1 69**].  Otherwise, there
were no focal neurologic deficits.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on
admission with a complete blood count that showed a white
blood cell count of 8.4, hematocrit of 31.2, platelets of 187
(with 78% neutrophils, 1% basophils, 12% lymphocytes,
3% monocytes, and 5% eosinophils).  Chem-7 revealed the
following:  Sodium of 143, potassium of 6.1, chloride of 105,
bicarbonate of 30, blood urea nitrogen of 64, creatinine
of 2.6, blood sugar of 95.  Digoxin level of 2.3.  Urinalysis
showed the following:  Specific gravity of 1.025, large
blood, 30 protein, moderate leukocyte esterase, negative
nitrites, 6 to 10 white blood cells, many bacteria.  Lactate
of 1.1, A-gradient of 15.5.  Arterial blood gas on 50% face
mask was the following:  pH of 7.18, PCO2 of 88, PO2 of 231.
Urine culture from [**2188-4-4**] showed Klebsiella
sensitive only to imipenem with 10,000 colony-forming units.
Urine culture from [**4-8**] was pending.  Sputum from
[**3-29**] showed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus in rare colonies.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray was limited, but no definite
congestive heart failure or pneumonia.

Electrocardiogram showed low voltages, rate of 110, with
atrial abnormalities, far right axis deviation.  No acute
ST-T wave changes.  No sign of Q waves.  This was compared to
an electrocardiogram from [**2188-3-23**].

CT of the abdomen and pelvis in [**3-15**] showed moderate
ascites.  She underwent paracentesis on [**2188-3-25**]
which showed no spontaneous bacterial peritonitis by white
blood cells or culture.

Hospital course prior to being transferred to the [**Hospital1 **]
Service, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit Service for further management of her respiratory
distress.

She was placed on BiPAP and did not tolerate this well
overnight.  However, she maintained her oxygenation and was
switched to nasal cannula during the day on the following
morning.  It was uncertain in the beginning as to whether her
respiratory distress was secondary to congestive heart
failure versus pneumonia/chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease.  Chest x-ray, lack of fever, and lack of
leukocytosis suggested that there was not an infectious
component.  Thus, Solu-Medrol was discontinued at this time
as well as Levaquin for pneumonia.  She was diuresed in the
intervening days with good response.  Since then she has been
able to maintain herself off of BiPAP and only on 3 liters to
4 liters nasal cannula.

During her Medical Intensive Care Unit stay, Mr. [**Known lastname **]
also converted to new atrial flutter with transient
hypotension.  At that time DC cardioversion was considered,
but Ms. [**Known lastname 34727**] blood pressure improved.  She was also
tried on ibutilide drip without affect.   She was
anticoagulated initially with heparin and then converted to
Coumadin and started on amiodarone while in the unit.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1.  Flovent 4 puffs inhaled b.i.d.
2.  Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers q.6h.
3.  Imipenem 500 mg q.6h. intravenously.
4.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.
6.  Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. t.i.d.
7.  Heparin drip.
8.  Combivent 2 puffs q.4-6h.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON TRANSFER:  Complete blood count
showed a white blood cell count of 6.5, hematocrit of 28.7,
platelets of 171.  Chem-7 showed the following:  Sodium
of 142, potassium of 5.2, chloride of 103, bicarbonate of 30,
blood urea nitrogen of 67, creatinine of 2.7, blood sugar
of 110.  Calcium of 8.3, phosphate of 5.8, magnesium of 1.9.
Urine culture from [**4-9**] did eventually grow out
100,000 Klebsiella pneumoniae which was sensitive only to
imipenem.  Nasal swab from [**2188-3-25**], showed positive
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON TRANSFER:  Temperature of 96.3, pulse
of 89 (in atrial flutter), blood pressure of 104/62,
respiratory rate of 27, satting 88% to 97% on 4 liters nasal
