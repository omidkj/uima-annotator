CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Transfer from an outside hospital after
complaint of chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 57456**] is an 84-year-old
man with a history of PVD symptomatic by claudication
diagnosed 10 years ago and noticed over the past several days
to have a decreased walking ability. The patient is a former
smoker, quit 30 years ago.  Last week the patient was golfing

arms and jaws. Also, 3-4 days prior to admission, the patient
noted dysuria and urinary frequency at night. The patient's
claudication is described as calf pain.  He also has
dependent posturing pain.  He was admitted to [**Hospital6 3426**] on the [**10-26**] and had an MRI with cardiac
catheterization done on the day of transfer that showed 50
percent left main and 80 percent LAD and 35 percent
circumflex with a 100 percent RCA lesion.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Patient's past medical history is
significant for PVD, COPD and skin CA.

MEDICATIONS:  Prior to admission include aspirin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Former smoker.  Occasional alcohol use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father dies of a brain tumor.  Mother died
of diabetes complications.

ALLERGIES:  The patient states an allergy to penicillin.

PHYSICAL EXAM AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION:  Vital signs:
Temperature 96.6, heart rate 102, blood pressure 138/70,
respiratory rate 30, O2 sat 93 percent on 4 liters.  General:
The patient lying in bed in no acute distress.  HEENT:
Pupils equally round and reactive to light.  Extraocular
movements and clear OPs clear.  Neck is supple with no
lymphadenopathy.  Positive carotid bruits.  Chest is clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Irregular rate and rhythm.  Lungs
are clear.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended.
Extremities with no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Pulses:
Carotid two plus with a bruit bilaterally.  Femoral two plus
with a bruit bilaterally.  Dorsalis pedis dopplerable and
posterior tibial monomorphic.

LAB DATA:  White count 12.3, hematocrit 38.9, platelets 528,
PT 14.4, PTT 41.3, INR 1.3, sodium 136, potassium 4.3,
chloride 97, CO2 of 28, BUN 33, creatinine 1.1, glucose 323.
Chest x-ray shows congestive heart failure.  EKG shows A-fib
with frequent PVCs. nonspecific ST changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  A Urology consult was obtained prior to
surgery as the patient reported prostatitis. The Urology
service dilated the meatus with up to 16 French and placed a
12 French Foley. On [**10-2**], the patient was brought to
the operating room for coronary artery bypass grafting.
Please see the OR report for full details. In summary, the
patient has CABG times three with the LIMA to the LAD,
saphenous vein graft to PDA and saphenous vein graft to OM.
His bypass time was 68 minutes with a cross-clamp time of 46
minutes.  He tolerated the operation well, was transferred
from the operating room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care
Unit. At the time of transfer, the patient's rate was 89
beats per minute.  He had a mean arterial pressure of 78 with
a CVP of 8.0. He had propofol at 20 mcg/kg/min, epinephrine
at 0.03 mcg/kg/min and lidocaine at 2 mg per minute.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient had a low
cardiac index and was therefore begun on a milrinone infusion
following which the patient improved hemodynamically. He
remained intubated throughout the evening of his operative
day.

On postoperative day one, his sedation was weaned.  He was
weaned from the ventilator and attempts at extubation caused
some hypoxia following which a pulmonary consult was
obtained. Pulmonary's recommendation was to begin on IV
steroids, to decrease his PEEP and FIO2 as tolerated.
Postoperative day two, the patient was hemodynamically
stable.  His blood gases had improved dramatically.  His PEEP
was weaned as was his of FIO2 and he was successfully
extubated. Following extubation, the patient was awake, alert
and oriented, following commands and moving all extremities.
His speech was clear.

While the patient was having a conversation with the
pulmonary service, he became unresponsive, not withdrawing to
painful stimuli. Also noted to be pursed-lip breathing.
Pupils were equal and reactive at that time. He was
immediately seen by the neurology service and was transported
to MRI for scanning. MRI revealed a small stroke. The
neurology service is aware and they are also questioning
whether the patient had seizure activity and was postictal,
this being the reason for his unresponsiveness. By the time
the patient returned from MRI, he was again alert, responsive
and moving all extremities.  Additionally, the patient was
noted to have some periods of atrial fibrillation during
postoperative day two for which an amiodarone infusion was
begun. Following his neurological event, the patient was
begun on heparin and Coumadin as well and was discontinued.
For the next several days, the patient was monitored in the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.

On postoperative day six, the patient was ultimately
transferred from the CSRU to 520 for continuing postoperative
care and cardiac rehabilitation. Once on the floor, the
patient had an uneventful hospitalization. His activity level
was advanced with the assistance of the nursing staff and
physical therapy. His medication regime was refined and on
postoperative day nine, it was decided that the patient was
stable and ready to be discharged to rehabilitation. At the
time of this dictation, the patient's physical exam is as
follows.  Vital signs:  Temperature 97.4, heart rate 84,
sinus rhythm, blood pressure 129/44, respiratory rate 20, O2
sat 93 percent on room air, weight preoperatively 97.7 kg, at
discharge 98.1 kg.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 16, hematocrit 32, platelets
360, PT 16.1, INR 1.6, sodium 141, potassium 4.3, chloride
103, CO2 of 22, BUN 44, creatinine 1.4.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  Neuro:  Alert and oriented times three, moves
all extremities, follows commands.  Respiratory:  Clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and
rhythm, S1 and S2.  Sternum is stable.  Incision with Steri-
Strips open to air, clean and dry.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds.
Extremities are warm and well-perfused with one plus edema
bilaterally. Left leg saphenous vein graft harvest site with
Steri-Strips open to air, clean and dry.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  CAD status post coronary artery bypass
grafting times three with the LIMA to the LAD, saphenous vein
graft to the PDA and saphenous vein graft to the OM.
