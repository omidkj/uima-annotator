Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Dilantin / Heparin Agents

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9240**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH with intravetricular bleed.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line placement.

History of Present Illness:
77 year-old male with history of seizure and atrial fibrillation
on coumadin who presents with intraventricular bleed. He was
found yesterday sitting on the floor of his apartment and was
incontinent of urine and confused. He went to [**Hospital3 **] in Methuan where he was found to have fever 101.2 and
leukocytosis of 14. INR was 1.1 and hematocrit 58.6. Head CT was
obtained and showed an intraventricular bleed. Patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work-up and management. The
patient was loaded with dilantin prior to transfer.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ER, repeat CT head was obtained without change from
the OSH study. The patient was followed by neurosurgery and it
was decided not to proceed with surgical intervention at this
time. Incidental finding was made of a T2 compression fracture
and the patient was placed in a C-collar. The patient was given
one dose of levofloxacin in the ED.
.
MICU course: He was continued on Dilantin intially with stable
neurologic exam. Ortho Spine was consulted for the T2 fracture,
and they recommended continuing C-collar and bedrest as he was
felt unable to tolerate flex-ex films. He was also found to have
a large pulsatile abdominal mass and ultrasound showed a 6 cm
AAA. [**Hospital1 **] Surgery was consulted and recommended CTA and
deferred intervention for now as would require heparin for
repair. He was started on NTG gtt for BP, then changed to
labetalol gtt, ultimately transitioned to po. He developed
agitation and dyskinesia. Neurology was consulted with change of
dilantin changed to keppra for dyskinesia. The patient was
maintained on CIWA scale for possible alcohol withdrawal. EEG
showed encephalopathy but no seizure activity. MRI/A with no
aneurysm or infarct. He failed two swallow evaluations and tube
feeds were initiated. He completed a three-day course of
ciprofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection. He continued
to spike fevers and was started on Vancomycin/Zosyn for empiric
treatment of aspiration pneumonia. The patient was afebrile
prior to transfer to the floor. PICC line placed [**1-10**]. Mental
status now improving, off 1:1 sitter.
.
On transfer to the floor, the patient complained of discomfort
at NG tube site. Denies headache, neck pain, chest pain,
shortness of breath, abdominal pain. Unable to provide further
history.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2199-1-6**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Intraventricular hemorrhage within the right lateral
ventricle and layering both ventricles posteriorly.
2. Hypodensity with sulcal effacement within the right parietal
lobe, which may represent a subacute infarct. There is equivocal
hyperdensity within the right MCA.
3. Mild dilatation of the ventricles, particularly the third
ventricle.
4. Chronic lacunar infarcts in the left basal ganglia.
5. Mucosal thickening of the sphenoid sinuses.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: The right parietal infarction
appears chronic.
There is a possible tiny, nondisplaced, fracture of the left
parietal bone, seen on images 43 and 44 of series 3. There is no
associated soft tissue swelling or hemorrhage, and this may
alternatively represent a venous channel.
There does not appear to be a nasal fracture on these images,
but the nose is not completely included in the study.
The periventricular hypodensity appears to be due to chronic
small vessel ischemia, there is not evidence of hydrocephalus at
this time.
The right internal carotid artery and MCA appear enlarged. These
may be due to hypertension. However, given the intraventricular
hemorrhage, it may be advisable at some point to obtain an MR, a
CTA, or both to evaluate the possibility of an arteriovenous
malformation.
.
CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2199-1-6**]
IMPRESSION:
1. T2 compression fracture.
2. Interventricular hemorrhage as described on head CT scan.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: The T2 fracture involves the
posterior aspect of the vertebral body with buckling of the
cortex and retropulsion of bone into the canal.
.
RETROPERITONEAL US  [**2199-1-6**]
IMPRESSION: Large fusiform abdominal aneurysm, measuring up to
6cm in the mid abdomen. Findings d/w the covering medical
resident.
.
CHEST (SINGLE VIEW)  [**2199-1-6**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Emphysema.
2. No focal consolidations.
.
ECG Study Date of [**2199-1-6**]  2:43:56 AM
Technically difficult study
Atrial fibrillation
Early R wave progression
Extensive ST-T changes
Consider left or biventricular hypertrophy
.
CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS  [**2199-1-7**]
IMPRESSION:
1) Stable right choroid plexus, intraventricular hemorrhage.
2) No focal aneurysm, however, there is diffuse broadening of
the anterior communicating artery and likely atherosclerotic
irregularity of the M1 segment of the right MCA.
3) Stable right posterior parietal encephalomalacia, likely from
chronic infarct.
4) Previously questioned left parietal fracture is not seen on
today's study and thought to most likely have represented a
small venous channel.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) [**2199-1-9**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  Too proximal position of the NG tube should be advanced for
at least 10 cm.
2.  Pulmonary hypertension and lung hyperinflation suggests
chronic lung
disease.
3.  Worsening of pulmonary edema.  An underlying infectious
process or
aspiration in the right upper lobe cannot be excluded.  Please
correlate
clinically.
.
CTA CHEST/ABDOMEN/PELVIS [**2199-1-9**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 6.6 cm in
transverse x 6.1 cm in AP x 7.8 cm in craniocaudal dimensions
with a dissection of fresh blood between two layers of old
thrombus.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions, emphysematous change and
calcified bronchiectasis in the upper lobes.
3. Pneumobilia in patient status post cholecystectomy.
4. Enlarged prostate and bladder diverticula.
.
MRI/A BRAIN W/O CONTRAST  [**2199-1-10**]
IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with inter
