Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 17865**]
Chief Complaint:
broken external fixation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
53 yo m with hx of severe COPD, s/p trach, and recent prolonged
hospitalization ([**Date range (1) 110912**]) after a mechanical fall resulting
in R radius and ulnar fracture s/p external fixation complicated
by PEA arrest after trach change, COPD exacerbation, VAP, C.
diff colitis, clinical seizures though negative EEG, and altered
mental status who presents with broken external fixation.
.
Per rehab notes, he has had recurrent episodes of vomiting 2-3x
per day and continues to have diarrhea.  His tube feeds have
been placed on hold and his G-tube is currently on gravity.  WBC
from [**11-8**] is 12.  He had a KUB that either showed an ileus or
is unremarkable.  UCx is growing ESBL E. coli but no
sensitivities are included.  Reportedly, he is on po vanc for c.
diff and empiric gent for recent pseudomonas pneumonia though
these are not on his medication list.
.
In the ED, initial vs were:  100.8, 130, 122/42, 18, 100% on
FiO2 50%.  Tmax was rectal of 102.3.  On exam his ex-fix was
noted to be broken and taped together.  There are areas of
purulent drainage.  CXR shows possible L sided pneumonia v.
aspiration.  Pt recevied vanc/levo/flagyl and tylenol.  He also
received 1mg of ativan for agitation.  Ortho plans to take him
to the OR tomorrow to replace the pin.  Current vital signs are:
 124 101/68, 96% on vent settings.  Access:  midline on L.

 GRAM STAIN (Final [**2126-11-10**]):
      >25 PMNs and >10 epithelial cells/100X field.
      Gram stain indicates extensive contamination with upper
respiratory
      secretions. Bacterial culture results are invalid.
      PLEASE SUBMIT ANOTHER SPECIMEN.
[**11-10**] Blood cultures x2
[**11-10**] Urine culture negative
[**11-10**] Blood culture negative

[**11-10**] CXR
Low lung volumes with persistent retrocardiac and left lower
lobe airspace
opacity and bilateral pleural effusions. While the retrocardiac
opacity may
in part be secondary to compressive atelectasis, infection
cannot be excluded.

[**11-10**] arm x-ray
Stable position of external fixator without evidence of hardware
complication.

[**11-10**] abdominal x-ray
There is no evidence of small-bowel obstruction or ileus.

[**11-11**] R arm x-ray
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-10**], the external
fixation has
been removed. There is still a large joint effusion seen as
displacement of
the anterior and posterior fat pads. There is some displacement
of the
olecranon from the fossa, consistent with dislocation. Small
areas of bony
opacification are consistent with heterotopic ossification or
previous small
avulsions.

[**11-12**] R arm x-ray
FINDINGS: Single view of the elbow shows overall normal
alignment of the bony
structures. Probably avulsion is seen from the outer aspect of
the proximal
ulna.

The views of the wrist show metallic fixation device in place
about the
comminuted fracture of the distal radius. Severely comminuted
fracture of the
distal ulna is seen with some callus formation.

Brief Hospital Course:
53 yo m with hx of severe COPD, s/p trach, and recent prolonged
hospitalizzation after a mechanical fall resulting in R radius
and ulnar fracture s/p external fixation complicated by PEA
arrest after trach change, COPD exacerbation, VAP, C. diff
colitis, clinical seizures though negative EEG, and altered
mental status who presents with worsening wrist pain.
.
1. Leukocytosis/fever: Patient was empirically treated for
presumed C diff with po Vancomycin and flagyl. However once C
diff toxin came back negative, these antibiotics were stopped.
UA, Urine culture were negative. Blood cultures were negative.
CXR was negative. His external fixation has broken though there
was no inflammation at the site.  Midline site appears clean. He
was treated with Meropenem for ESBL Ecoli from Urine culture at
rehab. Meropenem was started on [**11-9**], and will need to be
continued for a 14 day course (last day [**11-22**]).  On
discharge, patient was afebrile, with resolving leukocytosis.

.
2. Respiratory failure:  Patient is trach-dependent from COPD.
He was weaned to pressure support, and did not tolerate trach
collar. Vent settings on discharge were
Pressure support [**10-14**], with FiO2 of 40%. Patient tolerated this
well. Please continue to attempt to wean to trach collar.

.
3 Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea:  [**Hospital 110913**] rehab notes
regarding possible ileus on KUB. Abdominal x-ray here was
negative.  C diff negative.  Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea
resolved.

.
4. R ulna/humerus fracture, s/p external fixation on [**10-7**]: Pins
of external fixation were adjusted
- cont. calcium and vitamin D
- DVT ppx with Fondaparinux .

#  Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease:  He is on steroids
chronically.
- cont. current dose of prednisone 7 mg, switch to IV
formulation,
.
# Seizure:  Neurology felt that the patient had clinical
seizures although his EEG did not show any epileptiform
activity.
- cont. Keppra
.
# Fungal rash on back:
- cont. antifungal cream
.
# Diabetes:
- cont. home ISS.
.

# Anxiety/Agitation:  On klonopin and haldol at rehab. This was
held during hospitalization.

.
# FEN:  Tube Feeds by PEG
# PPx:  Fondaparinux, PPI
