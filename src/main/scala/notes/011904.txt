Past Medical History:
Oncologic history:
CLL, diagnosed in [**2137**] when incidentally noted to have elevated
WBC count. Treated with fludarabine then relapsed and required
four cycles of PCR and then again had five cycles of PCR, but
had persistent disease. He underwent reduced intensity allo-[**Year (4 digits) 3242**]
from his brother in [**2-16**] that was relatively uncomplicated,
though he did have grade I skin and hepatic GVHD, and febrile
neutropenia. In [**7-19**] his CLL relapsed and he underwent DLI in
[**9-18**] and [**10-19**]. in [**7-20**] his WBC rose and he developed
lyphadenopathy. It was decided to start campath. He has suffered
from oral lesions, and has been on famvir.

   WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2142-12-1**]):
      Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an
abbreviated
      workup is performed appropriate to the isolates recovered
from the
      site (including a screen for Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
Staphylococcus
      aureus and beta streptococcus).
      GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).    MODERATE GROWTH.  BEING ISOLATED.

      VIRIDANS STREPTOCOCCI.    MODERATE GROWTH.
      STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.    SPARSE GROWTH.

   FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):
      A swab is not the optimal specimen for recovery of
mycobacteria or
      filamentous fungi.  A negative result should be
interpreted with
      caution.  Whenever possible tissue biopsy or aspirated
fluid should
      be submitted.

The concentration of drug which results in a 50% reduction in
plaque formation
induced by viral cytopathic effect (CPE) versus the no-drug
control established
the inhibitory Dose 50 (ID 50) drug concentration.  the range of
drug
concentration tested varies with respect to the type of drug.

This test was developed and its characteristics determined by
ViroMed
Laboratories.It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S.
Food and Drug
Administration.  The FDA has determined that such clearance or
approval is not
necessary.  This test is used for clinical purposes.  It should
not be regarded
