Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 1728**] is a 72 year-old female with history of ESRD on HD,
sCHF, history of CAD, diabetes, and a.fib on coumadin who was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED this morning from [**Location (un) 620**] due to need
for
cardiac catheterization.  The patient has had angina for the
past
month and was recommened to undergo cardiac catheterization,
however her son just died and she was overwhelmed and had put
off
the procedure.

Yesterday she developed right-sided, nonradiating, dull chest
pain while watching TV.  She had associated nausea and dyspnea.
The pain ranges between a [**2202-2-25**].  She went to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] and
was given nitroglycerin with short-term resolution of the pain,
but she states the pain would return about 30 minutes after the
nitro was given.  She had one epsidoe of vomiting last night.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED where EKG shows TWI and STD
in V4-V6.
.
She was taken to the cath lab where she was found to have
instent restenosis of the mid-LAD BMS that was placed in 9/[**2203**].
Also was found to have tight dig that was felt to be consistent
with prior dimensions. A RHC showed elevated right sided
pressures with PAD pressure 27. A DES was deployed across the
instent restenosis. The right sided pressures dropped to the
15's by report.
.
She was dyspneic throughout the procedure and maintained on
BiPAP. She is transferred to the CCU for urgent HD for fluid
overload following procedure.
.
On arrival to the CCU she was initially hypertensive with MAPs
in the 80's and SBP of 150 on BIPAP with SaO2 100%. She was
comfortable. HD was initiated for fluid optimization. Shortly
after initiation of HD she developed worsening CP with acute
drop in BP to MAP of 50. HD was discontinued. BiPAP was also
discontinued to avoid interfereing wiht pre-load. She received
500c of fluid as HD was being discontinued.
.
EKG at that time showed evoulution of ST depressions in V3-V4
from pre-procedure EKGs. There is no post cath EKG in the chart
to compare with. CXR at the time of her decompensation was
fairly unremarkable on bedside interpretation.
.
BiPap was discontinued. Her BP's have retunred to normal and she
is satting 95% on 4L NC. She is still endorsing chest pain [**5-1**].

EKG [**2204-5-18**]:
Sinus rhythm. Possible septal myocardial infarction, age
undetermined.
Anterolateral ST-T wave changes may be due to ischemia. Clinical
correlation
is suggested. Compared to tracing #2 ST-T wave changes are seen
in
leads V3-V4 and more prominently in leads V5-V6 raising concern
for ischemia.
Clinical correlation is suggested.

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION [**2204-5-18**]:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Congestive heart failure NYHA class 4, on BiPAP during the
procedure.
3. Unstable angina CCS class 4
4. Mid-LAD 90% in-stent restenosis (likely culprit lesion for
unstable
angina) was successfully treated with a 2.75 x 15 mm promus
drug-eluting
stent. Unchanged stenosis at the ostium of the diagonal
following PCI to

5. Successful deployment of Angioseal to right femoral artery
with
excellent hemostasis.

TTE [**2204-5-21**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is mild to moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of
the inferolateral, anterolateral, distal septal and distal
anterior walls. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF =
30-35 %). No intraventricular thrombus is seen.Right ventricular
cavity size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild to moderate
aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral reg
