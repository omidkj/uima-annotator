Sternal debridement/omental flap closure

History of Present Illness:
64 year old female s/p reedo-sternotomy mitral valve replacement
on [**2150-12-15**]. She was discharged to rehab on [**12-24**]. At that time
she had some sternal
drainage and was placed on Keflex. She states she has always had
some drainage (mostly minimal) until the last 2 days when it
became more copious. In addition she states of feeling general
malaise with low-grade temp. Today in clinic her lower sternal
wound appeared erythematous with approximately 1cm opening and
purulent drainage. Her wound was opened several cm's and
appeared to have fat necrosis. She was transferred from clinic
to [**Wardname 5010**] to be admitted for further treatment.

Pertinent Results:
1. Diffuse ground-glass opacities involving both lung fields as
well as
bibasilar consolidation and small bilateral pleural effusions.
2. Soft tissue defect and associated absence of the sternum in
this patient
who is apparently status post resection, though not stated
within the
requisition. Also noted is prominence of the ascending aorta and
extensive
mitral annular calcification.
3. No acute abnormality in the abdomen or pelvis. Note of
chronic changes
which includes right renal cysts, probable splenule on the left,

atherosclerotic disease, gallbladder sludge without evidence of
acute
inflammatory change, calcified fibroids.

Conclusions
Patient brought for sternal debridement.
1. The left atrium is normal in size. The left atrial appendage
emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). A left atrial
appendage thrombus cannot be excluded.
2. The right atrium is moderately dilated.
3. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal.
4. The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global
free wall hypokinesis.
5. There are simple atheroma in the aortic root. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
6. The aortic valve is not well seen.
7. A mechanical mitral valve prosthesis is present. The motion
of the mitral valve prosthetic leaflets appears normal. There is
a moderate-sized vegetation on the mitral valve. There is mild
valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.5-2.0cm2). The degree of mitral
regurgitation seen is normal for this prosthesis.
8. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Readmitted from office clinic for sternal drainage. Vanco/cipro
started. Pt noted to be in renal failure at admission with
creatinine 3.6 (baseline 0.8). Early the following morning, she
became lethargic and mottled and was urgently transferred to the
CVICU for closer monitoring. Also given volume resuscitation
with calcium. CVL placed the next morning and she was intubated
for respiratory distress. Went to OR on [**1-8**] for sternal
debridement/wire removal/partial sternectomy and transferred
back to the CVICU with VAC/open chest pending further evaluation
by plastic surgery. Blood cultures and pleural fluid grew MSSA
and sputum grew Klebsiella. TEE in OR showed a vegetation on the
mitral valve with no evidence of obstruction. She remained in
septic shock on pressor support and abx. Multiple bronchoscopies
done for thick secretions. Feeding tube placed endoscopically.
JP drains ultimately were draining pus, and she became stable
enough to return to OR on [**1-17**] for closure with omental flap by
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].  Her renal function continued to decline and she was
on a high amount of PEEP for ventilatory support. She developed
a diffuse rash on her extremities and dermatology was consulted.
On [**1-22**] the family requested a meeting to discuss goals of
care. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] and Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 14738**], the PA and RN met with the family
who stated that the patient would "never want all of this" and
reported that they would refuse further invasive measures, such
as dialysis, tracheostomy or feeding tube, as it was stated in
her Living Will. They felt that her chances of a meaningful
recovery were small and they expressed their wish to withdraw
care.  After speaking with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **], it was agreed that care
would be withdrawn.  She was started on a morphine drip and
extubated to T piece at 1700.  She expired at 1735.  The sister
[**Name (NI) 382**] declined autopsy.
