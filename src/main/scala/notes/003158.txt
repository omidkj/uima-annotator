Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
Atrial Fibrillation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
D/C Cardioversion


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 27735**] is a 67 year old male with past medical history
significant for diabetes, HTN, GERD, and recent pancreatectomy
for necrotizing pancreatitis who presents with nausea,
diaphoresis and new onset atrial fibrillation. The patient was
in his USOH on the morning of admission when he came to the
[**Hospital1 18**] to have his percutaneous cholecystostomy tube removed. He
returned to his rehabilitation facility ([**Hospital 100**] Rehab) without
incident. Shortly after being seen by the physician [**Name Initial (PRE) **] (Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] he began to experience nausea and diaphoresis, which
he experiences fairly frequently since his pancreatectomy. He
then had a 5minute episode of epigastric pain. This was a [**4-3**]
dull ache, that he had never felt before and that he
distinguished as being lower down than the discomfort he
experiences with reflux. The pain did not radiate and was not
accompanied by subjective palpitations or light headedness. At
this time the patient's physician had returned to the room and
his heart rate was noted to be in the 162. Per the NH notes an
EKG demonstrated new ST depressionsin V3-V5 with old TWF in III
and AVF and LVH. Also noteworthy is that the physician at the
nursing home documented the absence of CP, nausea, or
diaphoresis. Patient was sent to the [**Hospital1 18**] via ambulance.


Per the EMS record Vital signs were HR 160-180, BP 100/70, EKG
showed SVT. Given 6mg IV adenosine and 15mg IV cardizem.


In the ED the patient's vital signs were HR 160 BP 88/46 RR20
and Sa02 99% on RA. EKG showed Afib with RVR. He was given Dilt
20 IV and 120 PO, fentanyl 25 IV x2, Versed 1mg IV x2,
amiodarone 150mg IV x1 and then 1mg/min gtt, and heparin gtt.
DCCV 50 joules unsuccessful and then 200 joules with resolution
to NSR. CXR performed and CTA deferred [**2-26**] contrast allergy.


Past Medical History:
chronic pancreatitis - complicated by pseudocyst. s/p multiple
ERCP's with multiple sphyncterotomies. Now S/P pancreatectomy in
[**2173-2-24**].
Diabetes - recent diagnosis.
HTN
Patient reports recent C.diff diagnosis - per daughter (a
physician) he has been treated.
[**Last Name (un) 865**] esophagus
COPD
h/o MRSA pneumonia
Melanoma s/p removal 15 years ago
Prostate CA - radical prostatectomy in [**2165**]


Social History:

years aog. There is no history of alcohol abuse - drinks [**1-26**]
beers/week.

ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests
a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right
ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired
relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2173-2-15**],
left ventricular
systolic function is now slightly less vigorous.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the CCU after d/c cardioversion
converted him to Sinus Rhythym. Anticoagulation was begun with
heparin IV. He will be discharged on a heparin drip and not
started on warfarin given possible future surgical procedures.
He remained in sinus rhythym with stable blood pressures. An
echo revealed low-normal EF. Surgery saw the patient who agreed
with a discahrge back to Rehab with surgery follow up. His
primary outpatient cardiologist was called [**2-26**] a patient history
of "fast heart rate" in the past. A message was left and the
patient was encouraged to schedule a follow up appointment with
this cardiologist on discharge. He has close follow up with
surgery and care at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.
