Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
ICD pocket infection

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ICD generator and lead extraction

History of Present Illness:
54 y old male w/ hx of CHF w/ EF of 30% s/p biV ICD/pacer in
[**9-18**], and NYHA functional class II-III, CAD s/p MI in '[**15**] with
BMS to OM1, CABG and MV repair [**9-19**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM,
SVG to PDA, 30 mm [**Doctor Last Name **] Physio-Ring), L shoulder replacement,
Left TKA, cervical spine fusion with hardware tx'd from [**Hospital 3856**] for pacer pocket infection.
Approximately 3 weeks ago the skin over the pacer started to
turn dark red/purple and became exquisitely tender. The patient
denied any fever, chills, nausea, headache, or general malaise.
He has not had any recent rash, skin breakdown or insect bite.
He did notice increase in cough but no increased rhinorrhea,
sputum production, or sinus pressure.
Last Friday, the patient went to his PCP and was prescribed
Keflex for presumed soft tissue infection overlying the
ICD/Pacer. He had normal WBC and no fever at that time. The
symptoms of redness and swelling did not improve so was taken
for pacer generator revision on [**10-19**] at [**Hospital **] hospital. They
discovered a large pus pocket, placed a drain and transferred
the patient to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent pocket washout and lead
removal.
ABG on arrival was 7.23/72/209/30/1 with a lactate of 1.0. Was
taken directly to OR where pacer pocket and lead extraction
which was uncomplicated although one pacer in the LV had to be
abandoned.

CXR ([**2122-10-20**]): FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of
[**2121-9-26**], the pacemaker device has been removed.  A prosthetic
mitral valve is again seen.  There is continued enlargement of
the cardiac silhouette with relatively mild vascular congestion.
 No evidence of acute pneumonia.
Endotracheal tube tip lies about 4 cm above the carina and the
nasogastric
tube extends to at least the upper stomach.  Metallic fixation
device
involving the lower cervical spine is again seen.
.
CXR ([**2122-10-20**]): FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**10-19**],
there is little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.
 The endotracheal and nasogastric tubes have been removed.
IMPRESSION:  No acute pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
54 y old male w/ hx of CAD s/p MI in '[**15**] with BMS to OM1, CABG
and MV repair [**9-19**], CHF w/ EF of 30% s/p Dual Chamber ICD [**9-18**]
w/ epicardial lead, Left TKA, L shoulder replacement, cervical
spine fusion with hardware tx'd from [**Hospital3 1280**] for pacer pocket
infection on [**10-19**]
At [**Hospital1 18**], was taken to the OR urgently and he had the atrial and
RV leads explanted along with the generator. A ventricular lead
was pulled back, cut and allowed to self-retract. In the OR, the
patient was hypotensive on neosynephrine for much of the case.
The episode of hypotension and fever to 101.5 was concerning for
sepsis and the patient was started on Vanco/Zosyn.
Intraoperative TEE did not show any evidence of endocarditis.
.
In the CCU at [**Hospital1 18**] pt was intially febrile to 101 when arriving
with sbp's in low 90's although appearing quite well with good
mentation, UOP and perfusion.  Pt's ABG quickly normalized and
pt was extubated on the day after admission.  Sbp's responded to
gentle fluid boluses and maintenance IVFs during the night of
the admission and  was never on pressors in the CCU.  Pt has
since continued to be afebrile and HD stable with sbps in the
120s and without an elevation in white count.  Pt was re-started
on BB prior to d/c.
.
On the day of transfer the following plan was discussed:
# ID/ICD pocket infection s/p ICD lead extraction with abandoned
pacer in LV remaining
- Cont vancomycin and zosyn for empiric abx therapy since we
have no cultures to follow.  Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] also NGTD
including cultures from pacer pocket; it is possible the
infection was treated with keflex prior to drainage if the
infection was g-staph
- ID recommended cont. current abx for now and for at least 4
weeks to be followed by oral supressive therapy
- cough productive of clear sputum positive with 4+ G- rods and
1+ G+ cocci; If truly has a pulm infecton as sputum suggests it
is covered with vanc/zosyn although CXR without obvious
infiltrates
- PICC line placed prior to transfer
- f/u culture of pacer tips, blood cultures, and sputum cultures
- daily wet to dry dressing changes
.
# Pump/CHF w/ EF of 30% s/p Dual Chamber ICD [**9-18**] now s/p ICD
lead extraction
- appears euvolemic to mildly overloaded
- cont. titrate up on BB, [**Last Name (un) **] as tolerated
- pt to go home with life-vest: This will need to be set up via
case management at [**Hospital1 **] and with the patient's
cardiologist.
- pt will likely need a new ICD implanted at some point in the
future
.
# Rhythm
- monitor on tele
- pt should go home with life-vest
.
# Ischemia/Coronary Artery Disease, s/p MI in '[**15**] with
thrombectomy and BMS to OM1, s/p CABG and MV repair [**9-19**]
- cont ASA 81, atorvastatin 80 mg
- cont. titrate up on BB, [**Last Name (un) **] as tolerated
.
# Pulm
- cough productive of clear sputum possitive with 4+ G- rods and
1+ G+ cocci; If truly has a pulm infecton as sputum suggests it
is covered with vanc/zosyn although CXR without obvious
infiltrates
- f/u sputum cultures
.
