Service: NEUROSURGERY

Allergies:
Codeine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**]
Chief Complaint:
Brain tumor

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Craniotomy for tumor resection


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 60-year-old male who is well-
known to our service from a previous admission and
stereotactic brain biopsy. The patient had after trauma and
incidentally diagnosed brain tumor. The tumor was largely
asymptomatic initially and underwent a stereotactic biopsy.
This revealed subependymoma. The patient recently became
symptomatic with progressive headaches and it was felt that
ventricular entrapment contributed to this particular
situation. The patient was therefore extensively counseled.
The patient wished to undergo surgical decompression to
decrease his risk in the future and allow for better
treatment options in the future.

Physical Exam:
He is awake, alert, and oriented times 3. His language is fluent

with good comprehension. His recent recall is intact. Cranial
Nerve Examination: His pupils are equal and reactive to light, 4

mm to 2 mm bilaterally. Extraocular movements are full; there is

no nystagmus or saccadic intrusions. Visual fields are full to
confrontation. Funduscopic examination reveals sharp disks
margins bilaterally. His face is symmetric. Facial sensation is
intact bilaterally. His hearing is intact bilaterally. His
tongue is midline. Palate goes up in the midline.
Sternocleidomastoids and upper trapezius are strong. Motor
Examination: He does not have a drift. His muscle strengths are
[**5-7**] at all muscle groups. His muscle tone is normal. His
reflexes are 0-1 bilaterally. His ankle jerks are absent. His
toes are downgoing. Sensory examination is intact to touch and
proprioception. Coordination examination does not reveal
dysmetria. His gait is normal. He does not have a Romberg.

EKG [**12-19**] Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Since the previous tracing earlier on [**2140-12-16**] no change.

Echo: [**12-16**] : Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderate symmetric LVH. Small LV cavity.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall normal LVEF (>55%). No resting
LVOT gradient. No VSD.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch
diameter. Focal calcifications in aortic arch.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Mild mitral annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral
valve chordae. Calcified tips of papillary muscles. No MS.
Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Normal tricuspid valve supporting structures. No TS.
Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with physiologic PR. Normal main PA. No Doppler evidence for PDA


PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Suboptimal image quality - poor parasternal views. Suboptimal
image quality - poor apical views.
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There are focal calcifications in the aortic
arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined

MRI of brain: Residual mass within the left lateral ventricle
demonstrates patchy enhancement that has decreased in size
compared to the preoperative study, now measuring approximately
2.7 x 1.8 x 1.8 cm, previously 2.9 x 2.2 x 2.8 cm. There is a
new tract that extends through the left frontal lobe to the left
lateral ventricle with surrounding signal abnormality and
enhancement. There is post op pneumocephalus. Extraaxial
fluid/blood products are also present, and presumably
postoperative. No new masses are identified. There is mild
ethmoid mucosal thickening.




Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname **] was admitted electively for a endoscopic craniotomy for
tumor resection.  Post operatively he was noted to have some
expressive aphasia.  A CT showed no hemorrhage, he spent
overnight in the PACU was started on Decadron. His BP was kept
less than 140 overnight.  On POD#1 he was transferred to the
surgical floor and later that evening he went into atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response thought to be
related to hypervolemia.  He was transferred to the surgical ICU
and started on a Cardiazem drip.  on [**12-16**] CTA chest showed
consolidation in the lower lobes bilaterally as well as less
prominent in the upper lobes. The distribution is suggestive of
aspiration pneumonia. no PE, no DVT was seen on lower extremity
dopplers. An Echo showed an EF 70%, LV and RV nrml, valves nrml.
 He ruled in for an MI by troponin.  He was started on beta
blockers (already on Metoprolol)and a statin.  His Cardiazem po
was titrated while the drip was weaned.  He remained
neurologically stable with the exception of expressive aphasia.
[**12-15**] MRI Head: Residual tumor in the left lateral ventricle.
On [**12-20**] he was transferred to the neuro step-down unit. The
patient remained neurologically stable, was eating, and
ambulating. He had difficulty voiding and required a new foley
catheter.  Bladder training was started and it was successfully
removed on [**12-22**].  His staples were also removed on discharge,
the site was clean and dry.
