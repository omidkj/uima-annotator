History of Present Illness:
This 55 Hispanic male arrived from [**Location 7196**] 2 months ago and is
s/p aortic valve replacement with a mechanical valve 10 years
ago.  He has had increasing fatigue and shortness of breath over
the past year and has also developed
ascites and has had 2 paracenteses.  He was admitted 1 month ago
with shortness of breath and had an outpatient echocardiogram 2
days ago which revealed a 6 centimeter ascending aortic
aneurysm. He had a subtheraputic INR at the time and his
cardiologist prescibed a Lovenox bridge.  The patient could no
afford the prescription and presented to the emergency
department to receive the medication.  He complained of
abdominal discomfort and had an abdominal CT which revealed an
aortic dissection.  A chest CT was then performed and revealed a
Type A dissection.

[**2124-6-8**] CTA
1. Type A dissection involving the right internal carotid artery
and left
subclavian artery extending to the iliac bifurcation.
2. Superimposed Type B dissection arising from the distal
arch/descending
aorta extending just below the takeoff of the SMA.
3. Ascending aortic aneurysmal dilatation measuring 6.6 x 7.8
cm. Left
subclavian artery aneurysm measuring 3.0 x 2.3 cm. Abdominal
aortic aneurysm measuring 3.9 x 4.9 cm.
4. Large right pleural effusion and cardiomegaly. No pericardial
effusion.
5. Moderate amount of ascites, partially imaged.
6. Heterogenous appearance of liver with reflux of contrast from
IVC/hepatic veins.

Note that the true lumen is compressed but patent and feeds the
celiac and
SMA, each false lumen gives rise to one renal artery. Overall no
findings of ischemia however.

[**2124-6-9**] CT Scan Cardiac
1. Possibly obstructive mixed plaque in the mid LCX at the
origin of the
single OM branch.
2. Non-obstructive calcified plaque involving the distal left
main.
3. Nonobstructive mixed plaque involving the LAD and RCA.
4. Known thoracic aortic aneurysm with a type A dissection

[**2124-6-12**] ECHO
The left atrium is dilated. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left
atrium or left atrial appendage. The right atrium is dilated. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left
ventricular cavity is dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is depressed (LVEF= 40 %). The right ventricular cavity
is dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic
root is markedly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta
is markedly dilated. The descending thoracic aorta is moderately
dilated. A mobile density is seen in the ascending aorta, aortic
arch, and descending aorta, consistent with an intimal
flap/aortic dissection. The aortic wall is thickened consistent
with an intramural hematoma. Ther is predominant thrombosis of
the false lumen distal to the left subclavian (up to 40 cm from
the incisoirs) with a small channel of antegrade flow. A
mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve
prosthesis leaflets appear to move normally. The transaortic
gradient is normal for this prosthesis. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. The mitral valve leaflets do
not fully coapt. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of
moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Markedly dilated ascending aorta with type A
dissection involving the ascending aorta, arch, and descending
aorta. Normal functioning mechanical aortic valve.
Moderate-severe mitral regurgitation. Biventricular dilatation
and hypokinesis.

[**2124-6-12**] Stress Test
No anginal symptoms or additional ST segment changes from
baseline. Nuclear report sent separately.

Gated Perfusion Study
1. Large, moderate to severe, fixed inferior wall defect as well
as a small,
moderate, fixed defect in the mid-lateral wall. A thallium study
could be
performed to evaluate for any viability in these regions, if
clinically
indicated.
2. Markedly dilated LV cavity with calculated EDV of 231 ml.
3. Reduced ejection fraction at 33%.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 68506**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2124-6-8**] for further
management of his abdominal pain. He underwent a CT scan which
showed a Type A dissection involving the right internal carotid
artery and left subclavian artery extending to the iliac
bifurcation, a superimposed Type B dissection arising from the
distal arch/descending aorta extending just below the takeoff of
the superior mesenteric artery, an ascending aortic aneurysmal
dilatation measuring 6.6 x 7.8 cm with the left subclavian
artery aneurysm measuring 3.0 x 2.3 cm, an Abdominal aortic
aneurysm
measuring 3.9 x 4.9 cm, a large right pleural effusion and
cardiomegaly, a moderate amount of ascites, partially imaged and
a heterogenous appearance of liver with reflux of contrast from
IVC/hepatic veins. The hepatology service was consulted given
his ascites. Paracentesis was performed with the fluid being
negative for malignant cells. The infectious disease service was
consulted for an infectiuos etiology of his liver disease.  No
infectious process was identified during admission, however,
there are pending tests on discharge. ID will follow up on these
results.  The patient's ascites reaccumulated and he did undergo
a second paracentesis on the day of discharge.  A family meeting
was held to discuss the risks and benefits of surgery.  The
patient and his family have decided to take some time to make a
decision regarding surgery.  Coumadin was resumed for his
mechanical aortic valve.  When INR was therapeutic, the patient
was discharged home with extensive follow up instructions.
