Chief Complaint:
Weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
56F with PMH of DM2, CHF with multiple admissions for CHF
exacerbation and recently discharged [**2147-11-21**] for atypical chest
pain thought to be secondary to viral syndrome presents with
tacycardia. She went to her endocrinology appointment today and
her heart rate was in the 130s, so she was send to the ED for
evaluation. She endorses approcximately 1 week of weakness and
previously had a sore throat, which has resolved. She also notes
she bumped her leg 3-4 days ago and has developed a scab with
surrounding erythema. Per the patient, she has been busy running
to various appointments over the past week or so. She has not
been eating quite as much and feels dehyrated. Of note, she
mentions her Lasix dose was recently ([**12-5**]) increased from 80mg
daily to 80mg [**Hospital1 **]. On arrival to the ED, she denied any chest
pain, palpitations, SOB, or DOE.
.
In the ED, initial vs were T 99.1, BP 175/9, RR 15, sat 100% on
2LNC, and she triggered for HR of 142. On exam had very dry
mucous membranes. Labs notable for HCT 33 (baseline), lactate
3.0, U/A negative. EKG showed sinus tach at 132, non-path Q III
which was old, STD with TWF V4-V6 that are ?rate related or
similar to prior.  Patient was also given Cefazolin IV for 4cm
area cellulitis around the site of her scab. Given her CHF she
was gently rehydrated with 1L IVF bolus, following which her HR
decreased to the 120s, but rales were reported in the lung
bases. ABG at 10pm was 7.44/51/62/36. Given hypoxia and
hypercarbia on ABG and need for careful fluid balance, she is
being admitted to the ICU. Vitals at the time of transfer HR
123, BP 116/72, RR 11, and sat 97% on 2L.
.
On arrival to the ICU, she complians of feeling dehydrated. Her
ROS was + for headache and otherwise unremarkable. Per the pt,
her leg swelling is at baseline.

[**12-8**] EKG Sinus tachycardia. Possible left atrial abnormality.
Baseline artifact.
Non-diagnostic Q waves in leads III, aVF and leads V5-V6. Poor R
wave
progression. Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared to the
previous tracing
of [**2147-11-21**] sinus tachycardia is new and T wave changes are more
pronounced
which could be rate-relatead.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT)IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.

Brief Hospital Course:
56yo F with multiple admissions for dCHF exascerbation who
presents with tachycardia in the setting of a viral syndrome and
mild cellulitis admitted for close management of fluid status.

1. Tachyacrdia: Given lactate of 3.0 on admission, exam on
initial presentation, recent viral illness, and recent
uptitration lasix, patient was hypovolemic on exam. Her
tachycardia and volume status improved with gentle hydration.
Patient received antibiotics in the ED, which were held on
arrival to the ICU, as it did not appear that she had ongoing
cellulitis.

2. Hypercarbia, hypoxia: Pt does not have known primary lung
disease, but is a current smoker and has OSA. She had no prior
ABG in our system, but her bicarb since [**6-/2147**] has been
persiatntly in the 30s, indicating that she has a chronic
respiratory acidosis (i.e. CO2 retention). Given HCO3 that
appears to be between 32-36 at baseline, her expected PCO2 would
~60. ABG in the ED demonstrated a PCO2 of 51.

3. Chronic dCHF/hypertension, benign: Home diuretics and
antihypertensives were held on initial arrival to the ICU. Held
home Lasix and lisinopril given normotension and initial
hypovolemia. She was continued to be monitored on the medical
floor on metoprolol while her lasix, amlodipine, and lisinopril
were held.  She continued to be normotensive, without evidence
of CHF despite holding these medications.  We were unable to
resume her diuretics or other antihypertensives as an inpatient,
as it did not appear that her BP or volume status would
tolerate.  Pt is scheduled to see her cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
on [**12-13**] for follow up, at which time she should be reevaluated
for resuming medications.  Given the fact that she remained
normotensive off of multiple cardiac medications for several
days while inpatient, I suspect she has a significant dietary
component of her dCHF and hypertension.  She was counselled on
the importance of maintaining sodium restriction and [**Location (un) 1131**]
food labels.

4. Type II DM: Held orals while inpatient, covered with HISS.
Resumed metformin at the time of discharge.

5. Hx of opiate abuse: Continued home methodone dose.

6. Hyperlipidemia:  Continued Simvastatin 20 mg PO/NG DAILY.
