Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer from OSH for submassive PE

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
78 F with htn, HL, [**Hospital 106626**] transferred from OSH for new
cardiomyopathy and question for AICD placement. She had been
doing well until [**Month (only) **] when she got ill with pneumonia. Since
then, she has not gone home and has been boucing between rehab
and hospitalization. In early [**Month (only) 404**], she has severe pnuemonia
requiring ICU stay but did not get intubated. She improved and
went to rehab. Then on [**1-13**], she developed SOB and was
admitted to [**Hospital3 7571**]again. She ruled out for acute MI.
She was diagnosed with bilateral lower lobe PNA and was given a
course of Vanc/Zosyn (transitioned to Vanc/Augmentin), and a
steroid course for COPD flare. She also had CHF and was diuresed
until her creatinine bumped. Per report from OSH, she had a
normal echo about 6 months ago, and repeat echo in early
Janurary showed new depressed EF of 30-50% with WMA. Repeat echo
on [**2168-1-14**] showed further depressed EF of 20-30%. She also had a
Dobumatine/persantine stressed test that was abnormal. She is
then sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of new cardiomyopathy and
abnormal stress test.
.
At [**Hospital3 **], she also had diarrhea and Cdiff cultures were
negative. Nonetheless, she was started on Flagyl emperically.
Her stools were occult blood negative. Her hct dropped to 27 and
because of her CHF, she was given two units of blood and her hct
bumped to 31-35.

RADIOLOGY:
CXR [**1-22**]
IMPRESSION:
Abnormal opacities involving both lungs. The reticular and
nodular pattern
involving both lungs, relatively sparing the left upper lung, is
nonspecific.
Diagnostic considerations include pulmonary edema superimposed
on chronic
interstitial disease. Pneumonia is not excluded. These findings
would be
better characterized with CT examination of the chest.
.
ECHO [**1-22**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis, with septal near-akinesis (LVEF =
25%). The left ventricle appears visually dyssnchronous. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free
wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-25**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The main pulmonary artery is dilated. A 12 x
9-mm mobile echodensity is seen just proximal to the pumonary
artery bifurcation, most consistent with thrombus. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined.

IMPRESSION: Probable main pulmonary artery thrombus. Severe
global left ventricular dysfunction, with mild regional
variation, suggesting multivessel CAD. Mild to moderate mitral
regurgitation.
.
EKG [**1-23**]
Sinus rhythm. Occasional premature atrial contractions. Diffuse
ST-T wave
abnormalities. Cannot rule out myocardial ischemia. Compared to
tracing #1
left bundle-branch block has resolved. However, diffuse ST-T
wave
abnormalities are now present. Clinical correlation is
suggested.

.
CTA CHEST [**1-23**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Large pulmonary embolus extending from main pulmonary artery
into the
right main pulmonary artery and into branches of the right
pulmonary artery in
the upper, middle and lower lobes.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Background pulmonary interstitial fibrosis in a subpleural
and
predominantly basal distribution, with involvement also of the
lingular
segment of the left upper lobe.
.
Bilateral LENIs [**1-23**]
IMPRESSION: No bilateral lower extremity DVT.
.
EKG [**1-24**]
Sinus tachycardia. Left bundle-branch block. Compared to the
previous tracing
of [**2165-4-4**] left bundle-branch block is new.
Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T

EKG [**1-24**]
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Left
bundle-branch block
which is likely rate-related. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2168-1-24**]
atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response has
appeared.
