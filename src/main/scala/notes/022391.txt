History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 55 yo M with a history of
Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome (spongiform
encephalopathy), recent hospitalization for UTI and urinary
retention, transferred from OSH with sepsis and found to have
pneumonia. Family had noticed declining mental status since
Thursday at his nursing home and decreased po intake. He was
also noted to be unresponsive and febrile today, brought in to
outside hospital, where he was found to be hypotensive
(responded to 2.5L of IVFs), he had a WBC count of 39K and a
Creatinine of 5.5.  He was noted to have UTI, given a dose of
ceftriaxone at OSH.  SBP in 90s and HR 110s at OSH prior to
transfer.

On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vs were as follows: 97.8 104 82
16 96% 6L. Patient was noted to be unresponsive with minimal gag
reflex and was subsequently intubated, started on fentanyl,
after which BP appears to have dropped to 80s systolic.  He
received a dose of levofloxacin IV, 4L of NS and he was started
on peripheral levophed for BP 79/52.  Peripheral levophed was
running about 45min prior to Left IJ placement.  He was started
on versed gtt.  Vitals prior to transfer to MICU were as
follows:  HR 78  BP 127/80s  O2sat 100% intubated on ventilator,
100%FiO2 Vt 500cc RR 14 PEEP 5.

Of note patient was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] from
[**Date range (1) 25051**] for difficulty caring for him at home and
agitation. He was found to have UTI thought to be secondary to
urinary retention. Hospital course was complicated by social
issues including guardianship. [**Name2 (NI) **] was treated with a 10-day
course of ciprofloxacin for complicated UTI; initial UA was
positive with a urine culture showing mixed flora. There was
some question as to whether etiology could have been related to
progression of his primary encephalopathy with dysautonomia vs.
potential psychiatric medication side effect vs BPH.  Patient
failed initial voiding trials early during hospitalization, but
had successful voiding trial after 3 weeks, though he remained
incontinent of urine, reported to have no evidence of
significant obstruction. Subsequent urine cultures during that
hospitalization grew Corynebacterium Species (Diphtheroids)
10,000-100,000 organisms/ml (Final [**2150-3-12**]) and Enterobacter
Aerogenes >100,000 organisms/ml (Final [**2150-3-26**]), for which he
did not appear to get any antibiotics.

On arrival to the unit, patient is intubated and sedated, unable
to communicate.  Food was suctioned from his mouth.

Unable to obtain review of systems because patient intubated and
sedated.

IMPRESSION:
1. Both the endotracheal and nasogastric tube should be advanced
for optimal positioning.
2. Right middle and lower lobe collapse, new from [**2149-12-13**].
Given the
rapid development, this may reflect mucus plugging, though
bronchoscopy or cross-sectional imaging to exclude obstructing
mass lesion is recommended.
