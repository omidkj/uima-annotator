History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 52730**] is a 70 year old male with medical history
including severe COPD on home O2, chronic diastolic CHF, and CKD
who was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2179-1-5**] to [**2179-1-21**].
During this hospitalization the patient was admitted to the ICU
for hypoxia and dyspnea in setting of Influenza and possible CAP
for which he was treated with Tamiflu as well as CTX/Azithro.
The patient was treated with Solumedrol and required intubation
with need for repeat intubation given recrudescence of symptoms
post-extubation thought to be secondary to volume overload from
hypertension and volume. It was also thought the patient had a
significant component of anxiety contributing to his extubation
failure for which his anti-anxiety regimen was increased with
impression that hyperventilation was contributing to auto-PEEP
and worsening obstruction. Atrovent was discontinued [**12-26**] mucous
plugging. The patient's course was additionally complicated by
reported STEMI on admission with 1mm ST elevations in V1-V3 and
elevated Troponins, CKs flat. Patient was seen by cardiology
with recommendation for medical management, repeat Echo with EF
45-50%.
    The patient was again admitted recently on [**2179-2-24**] for
symptoms of low grade fever and productive cough for which he
was again treated for COPD exacerbation with Levofloxacin and
ongoing PO Prednisone. The patient was also noted to have a UTI.
Ux on admission now reveals growing Pseudomonas resistant to
quinolones. The patient now presents with recurrent shortness of
breath since this morning. He reports that minimal activity
resulted in severe dyspnea and prolonged recovery. He denies
chest pain, nausea/vomiting. No fevers, chills. His sputum
production is small and at baseline per his report. The patient
has noted some LE edema over the last couple of weeks. He has
been unable to lie flat for years, no PND.
.
ED Course: 100.1, 137/57, 114,  22, 97% on NRB. In the ED
patient was given Ceftaz, Vanc, Solumedrol 125mg and combivent
nebs.

Imaging: New bibasilar opacities. Given the presence of severe
emphysema, pulmonary edema cannot be entirely excluded,
multifocal pneumonia remains a diagnostic consideration as well.

.
Echocardiogram [**2179-3-2**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%) The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral
Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I
(mild) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Preserved regional and global biventricular systolic
function. Mild diastolic dysfunction with elevated left
ventricular filling pressures. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSEMENT/PLAN: 70 yo M with known severe COPD who presented
with recurrent symptoms of dyspnea admitted with pneumonia, COPD
exacerbation, found to have mild acute on chronic diastolic CHF
and also with pseudomonal UTI. Required intubation for
respiratory distress. Completed treatments for pneumonia as well
as UTI.
.
# COPD exacerbation: ABG revealed hypercarbia most likely
secondary to his COPD exacerbation. He was also thought to be
slightly volume overloaded, secondary to known diastolic CHF.
He was intubated on [**3-1**] for increased work of breathing.  He was
treated with IV steroids, inhalers and antibiotics for a COPD
flare.  Over his course of stay, he was transitioned to an oral
steroid taper.  His ventilation and oxygenation improved
steadily and he was successfully extubated on [**3-9**], requiring 3L
NC with sats 95%. He will complete a slow steroid taper to be
maintained on baseline Prednisone 5mg po daily. He has follow up
with pulmonary Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 21848**] on [**2179-4-15**], however will
require an earlier appointment.
.
# Anxiety: Pt with significant anxiety r/t breathing, being
alone contributing to symptoms of shortness of breath. We
maintained pt on lorazepam 1mg po q4h PRN anxiety and shortness
of breath.
.
# [**Hospital 7502**] hospital acquired: Completed treatment with 7 day
course of vancomycin.
.
# Parosxymal atrial fib with RVR: He was in sinus throughout the
majority of his admission; however, on two occasions while in
the MICU and intubated he developed Afib with RVR; slight
hypotension during second episode.  He was treated with
metoprolol and IV fluids and both occasions broke out of his
rhythm within a few hours. He was also started on digoxin.
Anticoagulation was attempted given high CHADS score. This
resulted in gross hematuria (likely due to known bladder tumor)
with supratherapeutic PTT. Hematuria resolved following d/c of
anticoagulation.  He remained in sinus through the rest of his
course. Given risk for bleeding, plan to hold off
anticoagulation for now until after urologic surgeries completed
given gross hematuria.
.
# UTI: He was also noted to have a pseudomonal UTI which h
