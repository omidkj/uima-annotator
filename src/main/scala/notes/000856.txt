History of Present Illness:
70 year old man with severe COPD, CHF, and dementia secondary to
chronic alcohol use was admitted [**2145-9-13**] for acute respiratory
distress and hypoxia requiring intubation in teh ED and transfer
to the MICU.

At his extended care facility in [**Hospital1 789**], NH, the patient was
noted to be agitated and wheezing.  At baseline he is prescribed
continuous 02 but is reportedly noncompliant as per his
neuropsychiatric baseline of agitation and behavioral outbursts.
 On the day of admission, he was increasingly agitated and his
nurse noted that his RA sats dropped to 73% from low 90s.  Also,
he had a temperature of 99.0, drop in blood pressure 120/78 ->
100/60, tachycardia 132-150, wheezing, and respiratory distress
without improvement after nebulizer therapy and oxygen
supplementation by face mask.

In ED patient was found to be agitated with saturation of 87% on
non-rebreather mask in respiratory distress and ABG 7.39/37/57.
He was intubated with etomidate and succinate.  Copious, thick
yellow secretions were found post-intubation.  His temperature
spiked to 101.8 and he was started on vancomycin and
levofloxacin, given 40mg IV lasix with 1L IV normal saline with
resulting urine output of 540ml.  Also, he received nebs,
solumedrol 125 x1, haldol, and  ativan.

In the MICU, the patient was was extubated on [**9-14**] and tolerated
a switch to CPAP well with preserved oxygenation, maintaining 02
sats 90-94%.  Chest x ray post extubation showed worsening
bilateral lower lobe infiltrates which improved over time.  By
[**9-16**], the patient was oxygenating well at 95-100% on a
non-rebreather mask.  However, it was difficult to assess the
patient's true oxygen requirement since he frequently exhibits
agitated behavior and would remove the mask. In the MICU, the
patient became severely agitated and delirious. Psychiatry
consult was obtained while the patient was in the MICU and all
psych meds except haldol were discontinued per psych
recommendations. Ativan was discontinued because it worsened the
delirium.  The patient's mental status and behavior became less
acutely agitated over time.

The patient transferred to the medicine floor today in
restraints with a security guard sitter in stable condition
breathing spontaneously on ventimask oxygen supplementation.

unknown. PCP [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5762**] of [**Hospital3 4262**] Group, gets other care

[**Hospital3 1443**].

Family History:
Unknown.

Blood Cx x4 pending

ECG Study Date of [**2145-9-17**]  12:49:06 PM Sinus tachycardia.
Probable left atrial abnormality. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2145-9-15**] the rate is slightly faster. Otherwise, no
significant diagnostic change.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2145-9-15**] 12:24 AM IMPRESSION:
1. Triangular opacity adjacent to right heart border, concerning
for a collapsed right middle lobe. In a patient recently
intubated, this could be due to mucus plugging. However, follow
up films are suggested to document resolution. If this fails to
resolve, CT or bronchoscopy would be recommended.
2. Improving aeration at the lung bases, likely due to a
resolving aspiration pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
Brief Hospital Course by System

70 year old man with history of severe COPD, CHF, and dementia
due to prior alcohol abuse presented with respiratory distress,
was intubated and treated for pneumonia in the MICU, and
transferred to the medicine floor in stable condition.

1) PNEUMONIA:  Admitted from Provident NH, where he was found to
have desaturated to 73%, wheezing and in resp distress.
Susequently intubated and sedated on propofol. Initially started
on Vancomycin, levofloxacin, nebs and solumedrol. LLL infiltrate
on CXR.  HD #2, Pt placed on PSV, did well and susequently
extubated. Pt placed on shovel mask post extubation but agitated
and wouldn't cooperate. He received IV vancomycin and
levofloxacin for his first 2 days of admission and the
vancomycin was discontinued on [**9-15**] since cultures were negative
for s. aureus. Sputum was legionella negative and consistent
with normal flora. For several days Pt remained dependednt on
NRB for sat's >95%. [**2145-9-13**], Pt transfered to general medical
service. Pt slowly improved saturation wise so that eventually
weaned off O2 and with refusal of NC was saturating consistently
inthe low 90's.  Pt finis
