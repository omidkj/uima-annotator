Service: Neurosurgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 68 year old
right handed man who, a couple of days prior to admission,
was [**Location (un) 1131**] a paper and developed blurry vision and felt
lightheaded with bilateral arm heaviness.  He tried to pick
up a coffee cup with both hands but his arms felt weak.  He
tried to stand but again his legs felt weak and he could not
move well.  He felt lightheadedness.  He called 911 and says
his speech was slurred.  He could understand what was being
said to him.  This episode came on suddenly and resolved
within one hour.

He had a similar episode of this approximately three weeks
prior that occurred while walking when he felt lightheaded at
that time as well.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
3.  Left femoral-popliteal bypass.
4.  Pneumonia.
5.  Vertigo.
6.  Headache.
7.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
8.  Status post appendectomy.
9.  Status post tonsillectomy.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Zestril 30 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q. day.
3.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q. day.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   Smokes two packs of cigarettes per day
since age of eight.  Takes two to three drinks of alcohol per
day.  Has a second marriage currently.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On physical examination, the patient
is afebrile, vital signs are stable.  He is awake and alert;
he answers questions appropriately with fluent speech.
Memory registers three out of three.  Recall three out of
three at five minutes.  No right to left confusion.  No
apraxia.  Face is symmetric without ptosis.  Extraocular
muscles are intact.  Pupils 4 to 3 bilaterally.  The
patient's upper extremities were full strength.  Left lower
extremity full strength as well.

LABORATORY:  An MRI / MRA was done that showed right
vertebral artery stenosis.

White blood cell count 8.5, hematocrit 47, platelets 162.
Sodium 133, BUN 27, creatinine 1.1.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Name (STitle) **] Service.  He underwent an angiogram on [**4-27**].  This
showed intracranial stenosis of the right V4 vertebral
segment.

This was discussed with the patient.  The risks and benefits
of this procedure were explained to the patient.  He wished
to proceed.

Preoperative diagnosis again was right intracranial vertebral
artery stenosis.

Procedure that the patient underwent was:
1.  Cerebral angiogram.
2.  Angioplasty and stent deployment within the right
vertebral artery stenosis segment.

This operation was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 1132**] and was
characterized by a prolonged decreased right vertebral flow
because of the need for the guide catheter to be high enough in
the neck to allow PTA balloon and  stent navigation to the site
of stenosis.

The patient awoke with right arm and leg hemiplegia.  A STAT
head CT scan was performed to rule out hemorhhage and that
was negative.

Over the next couple of hours, the patient recovered
excellent strength in the right arm and leg back to normal
baseline strength, a finding most consistent with relative
reversible hypoperfusion of his brainstem intra-procedurally
because of the guide catheter position.

The patient was continued on heparin, Plavix and aspirin post
procedure.  The heparin was discontinued on [**5-3**].  The
patient's arterial sheath was also discontinued on [**5-3**].
The patient did well.  He was transferred out of the
Intensive Care Unit.

He was continued on aspirin and Plavix and did well on the
floor and was stable for discharge to home on [**2136-5-6**].

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  The patient will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 1132**] in one
month.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  The patient will be discharged on all
his preoperative medications.
1.  Zestril 30 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q. day.
3.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q. day.
4.  He will also be discharged on Plavix 75 mg p.o. q. day.
5.  Add aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day.

It has been explained to the patient the absolute necessity
that he take these medications every day.
