History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 93612**] is a 67 year old male with a St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**] mechanical
aortic valve admitted [**Date range (3) 93613**] for subtherapeutic [**Date range (3) 263**] who
presents with 2 days of low back pain.  There was no associated
trauma or injury. The pain is in his central lower back, is
present almost all the time, and varies in severity up to [**11-4**].
It is throbbing in nature and worse when sitting up or flexing
his legs. It is worse with palpation. He has also noticed
increased abdominal distention in the last few days. He has
tried tylenol for pain without much relief. He was discharged on
[**5-9**] on lovenox bridge and coumadin. Other than his lovenox and
coumadin, he has no new medications or changes in his
medication. He was discharged 7.5 mg daily (up from 5mg 6 days
per week, 7.5mg on sundays), but his [**Month/Year (2) 263**] was 1.9 on [**5-11**] and his
dose was increased to 10 mg qd. His last dose of coumadin was
[**5-14**]. He was taking Lovenox 100mg SC BID, last dose 4/20 in the
morning. He took his antihypertensives and ASA this morning. He
denies any lightheadedness, CP, SOB, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation (though no BM today), red/maroon/bloody stools,
hematuria.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 97.2 66 102/68 18 98. He was then
noted to have systolic pressures in the 70s and he was
complaining of lightheadedness; he was transferred to the core.
EKG showed paced rhythm and hematocrit was noted to be 31.4 from
39.2 one week prior. CTA was done for concern of dissection and
showed a left RP bleed with active extravasation at the left
iliacus muscle. He received D5W with bicarb for renal
protection. [**Month/Year (2) 263**] was 4.2 and creatinine was newly elevated to
1.7. His pressures were noted to increase to the 100s systolic,
and he was given 2 units of FFP, 1 unit PRBCs, 3.2L IVF. He was
noted to void only 100 cc in the ED. Vascular surgery and IR
were both consulted for possible intervention. IR recommended
reversal of coagulopathy for [**Month/Year (2) 263**] < 2, and consider embolization
if HCT continues to fall. The patient received 4mg IV morphine x
2 for abdominal pain when pressures were improved, with
improvement in pain. Repeat vitals: HR 80, BP 111/70 18 100% RA.
 FAST exam showed a small pericardial effusion. Cardiology
recommended slow reversal with FFP; no indication for vitamin K.
In ED, unable to place Foley due to resistance.
.
On the floor, patient was given second unit of pRBC. Repeat [**Month/Year (2) 263**]
2.4, and pt was ordered for 2 more units of FFP. Repeat Hct
stable at 26.6. Lactate 3.9. Attempted to place Foley but unable
to due to resistance; urology consulted. Creatinine stable at
1.6. Bladder scan showed 50 cc urine in bladder. IVF were
started at 150 cc/hr.


Past Medical History:
1. Mechanical AV: Pt had bicuspid AV requiring replacement.
Aortic valve replacement with the Bentall procedure done in
[**2124-4-26**] with a redo procedure done in [**2132-5-26**] secondary to
methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus abscess.
2. Afib: [**Year (4 digits) **] ([**Company 1543**] Sigma dual chamber) placed in
setting of CHB in [**1-/2139**], continues amiodarone.

4. H/O GI Bleed ([**2132**])
5. CAD requiring CABG: SVG to LAD, SBG to OM, and SVG to PDA
6. Hypercholesterolemia
7. HTN
8. COPD
9. Endocarditis: Pt has had multiple episodes of endocarditis,
most recently in [**2138**] with concern for culture negative
endocarditis (veg seen on valve), per recommendation of
infectious disease team at [**Hospital1 18**] (consulted in prior
hospitalization) he will require chronic Levofloxacin
10. Herniated disc
12. Thoracic aneurysm
13. Pulmonary hematoma in [**2132**] requiring pulmonary decortication

and surgical evacuation of hematoma from left upper lobe of
lung.
14. Septic Cerebral Emboli ([**2132**]) without residual defecits.
