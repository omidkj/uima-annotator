Service:  ICU

HISTORY:  Mr. [**Known lastname 2470**] is a 69-year-old male who was transferred
to [**Hospital3 **] Medical Center for management of respiratory
failure and unresponsiveness.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 69-year-old male with prostate
cancer, known metastases to hip, who presented with increased
anxiety and poor sleep the week prior to admission which his
family attributed to his worrying about rising prostate
specific antigen.  On [**2194-12-19**], he had trouble sleeping.  In
the morning of [**12-20**], the patient's son noticed ankle
swelling and the patient was more lethargic with a harder
time verbalizing himself, although he continued to follow
commands.  Of note, he had been on hydrocodone approximately
30 mg daily for significant baseline bony pain.  His family
held the hydrocodone on [**12-20**] because of concerns of his
mental status.  Saturday, [**12-21**], in the morning, the patient
was too weak to walk to the bathroom and his speech was not
coherent. He had labored breathing and dry cough on [**12-20**],
worse on [**12-21**].  On [**12-21**], his breathing was shallow with use
of accessory muscles.  EMS was activated and the patient was
transferred to an outside hospital Emergency Room where
temperature was 97.5, blood pressure 197/97, pulse 112,
oxygen saturation 96% on two liters.  Arterial blood gas
analysis showed pH 7.38, PCO2 38, PO2 64.  The patient was
combative and had labored breathing, and was intubated on
[**2194-12-21**], still at the outside hospital.  Chest x-ray showed
bilateral infiltrates and the patient was started on
ceftriaxone and levofloxacin.

For sedation, the patient received intravenous haloperidol
and lorazepam.  This was changed to morphine sulfate and
midazolam; both were held at 10 o'clock a.m. on [**12-22**].
Neurology was consulted and gave the patient naloxone which
produced facial grimacing.  CT of the head with contrast was
negative for all pathology.  The patient also ruled in for
myocardial infarction on [**12-22**] with peak creatine kinase of
300 and cardiac troponin-I 2.1.  Echocardiogram on [**12-23**]
showed ejection fraction greater than 55%.

Antibiotics were changed to ticarcillin with beta lactamase
inhibitor on [**12-23**].  At that time, a lumbar puncture had no
white cells.  Given his dyspnea on presentation, a
computerized tomography of the chest with angiogram was
performed which showed no evidence of pulmonary embolus.

Other notable abnormal labs included an alkaline phosphatase
of 1,000, lactated dehydrogenase of 800, and ammonia of 85,
for which the patient has been receiving lactulose.

The patient was extubated on [**12-24**], but developed respiratory
distress after 12 hours and was reintubated on the same day.
He was noted to be unresponsive during his period of
extubation.

On [**12-25**], the patient had a normal magnetic resonance imaging
of the head which was limited by artifact from patient
motion.

On [**12-26**], the patient's morphine sulfate IV drip was
discontinued and the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**].  On arrival, he was again on
morphine sulfate IV drip, 5 mg per hour.  Also of note, the
patient had intermittent fevers to 101.5 at the outside
hospital.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives in [**Location 12017**], [**State 792**]with wife
and four sons, three of which live locally.  Social ethanol.
Two cigarettes per day for many years, quit two months prior
to admission.  Retired public works superintendent.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 99.8, pulse 69-96, blood
pressure 126/41 to 151/68.  Ventilator settings: Assist
control 700/12, FIO2 40%, no spontaneous breathing, no
breathing when ventilator temporarily stopped.  General:
Intubated.  No response to voice, no response to pain, except
for grimacing to deep sternal rub.  HEENT: Pupils 2 mm, no
Doll's eye reflex.  Chest: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Heart: Regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2.  No
murmurs.  Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended, with
positive bowel sounds and a pulsating mass in the
epigastrium.  Extremities: 2+ edema to knees.  Normal muscle
bulk.  No atrophy.  Tone flaccid.  Neurologic: Notable for
decreased left corneal reflex, normal right.  Unable to
elicit biceps, patellar or Achilles' reflexes on either side.
Toes do not respond to Babinski maneuver bilaterally.

LABORATORY/DIAGNOSTICS:  White blood cells 6.0, hematocrit
29.5, platelets 186.  Sodium 156, potassium 3.5, chloride
118, CO2 27, BUN 19, creatinine 0.5, glucose 125.  PT 15.8
with INR of 1.6, PTT 25.8.  ALT 17, AST 35, LDH 879, alkaline
phosphatase 708, total bilirubin 0.6.  Ammonia 82, magnesium
2.0.  Urinalysis negative.

Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at 90 with right bundle
branch block and left anterior hemiblock.

Chest x-ray at [**Hospital1 **] showed mild diffuse
pulmonary edema.  No infiltrates.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient's unresponsiveness was felt to have
a differential diagnosis including medication effect from
narcotics, cerebrovascular accident, infection, anoxic brain
injury, hypernatremia.  Respiratory failure felt to have a
component of pulmonary edema, but diuresis initially held,
give hypernatremia.  Hypernatremia was, in the meantime,
repleted with 5% dextrose and water.  Blood cultures were
sent looking for source of infection.

On [**12-27**], the patient opened eyes to verbal stimuli, although
did not track with his eyes.  Electroencephalogram showed
toxic metabolic disorder.  Antibiotics were changed to
ceftazidime and vancomycin given the possibility of
nosocomial pneumonia.

Clinical nutrition assessment recommended tube feeding which
was initiated.

On [**12-28**], the patient had bursts of nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia and remained sedated.  Neurology consultation
recommended that diminished arousal was likely
multifactorial, but secondary to metabolic state.  Exam,
however, was confusing for left MCA distribution ischemic
event with right facial and arm weakness.  Magnetic resonance
imaging with diffusion was recommended, as well as
electroencephalogram discussed above.

On [**12-29**], MRI was obtained, but, unfortunately, did not
include diffusion imaging and Neurology consult recommended
repeat MR.  On that day, Cardiology consult agreed with
diagnosis of non-Q wave myocardial infarction and recommended
increasing beta blockade and adding ACE inhibitor.  It was
not clear whether wide complex tachycardia was ventricular
tachycardia or supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy.
Heparin anticoagulation was also advised.

On [**12-30**], insulin drip was started for elevated blood
glucose.  Antihypertensive management continued, as well as
ventilatory support.  Hypernatremia was persistent and
dextrose 5% and water continued to be administered.

On [**12-31**], sedation was entirely weaned due to concerns for a
toxic metabolic encephalopathy.  Hydralazine was added and
carefully increased for blood pressure control.  Vancomycin
and ceftriaxone continued for copious pulmonary secretions
and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray.
Neurology was re-consulted and recommended repeat lumbar
puncture and following of pneumonia, electroencephalogram,
and ammonia.

On [**1-1**], computed tomography of torso showed bilateral
pleural effusions.  Serum ammonia noted to continue to be
elevated and lactulose increased.  Persistent tachycardia led
Cardiology Service to suggest repleting potassium to 4.5 and
