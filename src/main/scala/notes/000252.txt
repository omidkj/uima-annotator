History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 33681**] is a 84 year old male with severe aortic stenosis
(valve area of 0.9 cm2; LVEF of 50-55%; peak velocity of 2.0 m/s
based on TTE on [**2160-6-9**]) and [**Year (4 digits) **] III/IV COPD (FEV1 46% of
predicted on [**4-/2160**] PFTs), Coronary artery disease s/p NSTEMI
with peaked troponin of 0.23 in [**7-/2159**] and inferior wall motion
abnormality in TTE (08/[**2158**]).
.
He presents to the ED with two day history of shortness of
breath. He reports having increased lower extremity swelling,
paroxysmal noctural dyspnea, two pillow orthopnea, whitish
productive sputum and abdominal distention over past two days.
He does not report fever, chills, pleuritic chest pain,
palpatations, dizziness, syncope or sick contacts. [**Name (NI) **] reports he
has been using his inhaler more frequently yesterday without any
help. Of note they were at his son's house for [**Holiday **]
dinner. Patient and family do not report any sick contacts or
high salt intake. No history of eating outside.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 98.2 97 131/61 30 96%. EKG showed
sinus rhythm at rate of 90 with prolong AV delay and LBBB which
is similar to his previous EKG (01/[**2159**]). No ST-T changes
compared to prior. CXR showed pulmonary vascular congestion with
cephalization of vessels. Labs significant for normal WBC,
creatinine at baseline of 2.3, troponin of 0.07, BNP of 2776, Mg
of 1.4 and lactate of 4.0
.
He was treated for COPD exacerbation with IV methylprednisolone
125 mg x 1; azithromycin 500 mg IV x 1; albuterol/ipratropium q1
nebs. He also received IV lasix 20 mg x 1 for acute on chronic
systolic heart failure though no urine output was noted. CPAP
with 4LNC was started to help with respiratory distress from
acute on chronic systolic heart failure and COPD exacerbation.
He was transferred for further evaluation and management of
hypoxemic respiratory distress. His vitals prior to transfer
were afebrile 87 127/72 24 99-100% CPAP 4LNC.
.
On arrival to the MICU, he reports feeling better after CPAP and
therapeutic regimen in the ED. Extensive discussion revealed he
would not like to be intubated or have cardiac resuscitation
which was confirmed with wife and HCP [**Doctor First Name 12239**] at bedside. He is
ok with noninvasive positive pressure ventilation mask like CPAP
and BPAP. He reports having daily bowel movement. His baseline
shortness of breath is with walking to the bathroom which has
worsened to any activity over past two days.
.
