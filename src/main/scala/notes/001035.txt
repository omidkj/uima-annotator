Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**]
Chief Complaint:
Lower extremity weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Dobhoff placement and removal

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 74 year old woman with history of metastatic
pancreatic cancer and distant history of [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 7816**] [**Location (un) **] Syndrome
who is now transferred from an outside hospital with lower
extremity weakness. Patient is unable to provide any history at
present. Chart review from the OSH and discussion with patient's
husband provided history contained here. Per husband, the
patient had her last chemotherapy about 10 days ago and was
feeling well one day following. Was able to go shopping with a
few friends for an hour or two. The following day the patient
complained of generalized malaise, fatigue, then rigoring at
home. EMS took her to [**Hospital **] Hospital [**2116-12-8**] where she was
noted to be febrile and she was treated with Ceftriaxone and
Azithromicin for ? RLL pneumonia and UTI. The patient improved
the following day and was ambulatory in the hospital, however
the following day (Sat. [**12-12**]) the patient was very lethargic
and slept most of the day. This continued to Sunday [**12-13**] and pt
was noted to be unable to get out of bed on her own. She could
sit at the edge of the bed but her "legs were like a rag
doll's," and she was unable to stand. Her arms also seemed weak.
The patient and her husband had a negative experience with a
neurologist at [**Hospital1 **], and they love their GI surgeon here at
[**Hospital1 18**] and requested transfer for further evaluation. The patient
underwent MRI of her T and L spine without note of cord
compression at the OSH prior to transfer.

Vitals at OSH T 98--Tm 99, BP 98-120/56-82, she was on 2L NC sat
91-93%, Prior to transfer NIF -30, Vital capacity 1 Liter. MRI T
and L spine with no reported compression, ? bone metastsis in T
5, T6, T10. Pt was more drowsy than earlier due to ____ she got
(for MRI sedation?). Also given 1g solumedrol earlier in the
day.

She was treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycine for RLL
pneumonia and also treated for E. Coli UTI.

In arrival to the Trauma ICU the patient was hypoxic at 89% and
started on 40% facemask.

Patient is unable to offer a full ROS. She denies any pain or
discomfort at present.

Past Medical History:
1) Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer- diagnosed with obstructive
jaundice d/t pancreatic head mass, mets to liver and ? lung,
tumor is inoperable. She is s/p biliary stent placement. Pt was
undergoing chemotherapy, last dose ~10 days ago, her oncologist
is Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 19948**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in [**Hospital1 **], MA.
2) [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 79755**] [**Location (un) **] Syndrome- "GBS approximately 5 years ago a few
weeks after receiving a flu shot.  She describes being at work
(at [**Hospital1 3597**] Witchcraft Elementary School) when a young boy asked
her to help tie his shoe, when she reached to tie the shoe her
hands completely passed their mark and she was concerned.  She
rapidly worsened with total body weakness prompting
hospitalization at [**Hospital **] Hospital where she was plasmapheresed
x 5 days.  She did have a few days of dyspnea but did not
require ventilatory support.  Residual pins and needles
sensation in the hands and feet and residual BLE weakness.  She
thought she might have had a recurrence a few years ago (felt
weak for 2 days), but these symptoms resolved on their own."
3) Hypertension
4) Hypothyroidism
5) Hyperlipidemia
6) Esopageal spasm
7) S/p CCK.

Social History:
Married with 2 children. Worked at [**Hospital1 3597**] Elemetary in kitchen;
retired after GBS. Quit smoking 5 years ago, no recent ETOH. No
illicits.

Family History:
Father died of MI
Mother died of stroke
No history of other neurologic disease or malignancy

Physical Exam:
Vitals: T 96.7, HR 105, BP 106/70, R 24, 94% on 40% FM
Gen- ill appearing, drowsy but arouses briefly to voice, appears
comfortable.
HEENT- NCAT, pale, anicteric sclera, MMM, OP clear
Neck- no carotid bruits.
CV- tachycardic, no MRG
Pulm- scattered crackles throughout.
Abd- soft, nt, nd, BS+
Extrem- no CCE.

Neurologic Exam:
MS- place=[**Hospital **] hospital, month=[**Month (only) **], year=?. She is
inattentive. able to name days of week forwards, but when asked
to say them backwards she is unable to switch tasks. Her naming
of "watch" is intact, but with other objects the patient is too
inattentive to comply with further testing. She follows simple
commands, but is perseverative "open your eyes" but difficulty
with "show me two fingers on your left hand"

CN- smell not tested, pupils 4mm-->3mm and sluggish to light
bilaterally, EOM's are full, no nystagmus. blinks to threat
bilaterally. Funduscopic exam could not be performed due pt
uncooperativeness with exam (pulled eyes shut forcibly). face is
symmetric with symmetric sensation to LT. no ptosis. hearing
intact to FR bilat, unable to view palate with face mask for O2,
tongue protrudes at midline.

Motor- no adventitious movements, tone appears low throughout.
She displays motor impersistence. Holds both arms antigravity
for 2-3 seconds and they fall to her chest. She spontaneously
holds her legs antigravity briefly. When asked to move her legs
to command she is unable to do so. She briskly withdraws her
legs to noxious stim.

Sensory- intact to light touch in all extrem, intact to noxious
in all extrem. unable to perform detailed sensory testing due to
mental status.

Reflexes: unable to elicit any DTR's in [**Hospital1 **], tri, [**Last Name (un) **], patell,
ankles.

Plantar response down on right, up on left.

Gait- unable to test.

Pertinent Results:
CHEST RADIOGRAPH AP ([**2116-12-13**]): Mild cardiomegaly. No vascular
engorgement. No lung consolidation or mass. No pleural effusion.
Metallic stent projects over the right upper quadrant.

CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST ([**2116-12-14**]): 1. No evidence of
infarction, hemorrhage, of mass effect. 2. MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] is
most sensitive for evaluation of intracranial metastatic
disease.

BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLERS ([**2116-12-15**]): No DVT in the
bilateral lower extremities.

CHEST PA/LAT ([**2116-12-16**]): In comparison with the study of [**12-14**],
the patient has taken a somewhat better inspiration and the
atelectatic changes at the bases have decreased. Some
costophrenic angle filling posteriorly suggests small pleural
effusions. Dobbhoff tube remains in place. Specifically, no
evidence of acute pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
74 year-old female with pancreatic cancer metastatic to her
liver and possibly lung, GBS 5 years ago after a flu shot,
hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who intially presented to an
OSH with a fever after chemotherapy and was found to have
pneumonia and E. coli UTI, and then was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
neurological evaluation for lower extremity weakness. Hospital
course was as follows.

NeuroICU course:
Her neurologic examination on admission was notable for marked
inattention, which further limited detailed motor and sensory
testing; however, she was
