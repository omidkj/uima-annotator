Pertinent Results:
Initial [**1-30**] CXR:
The heart size and mediastinal contours are normal. The lungs
are hyperinflated with attenuation of the pulmonary vascularity,
particularly in the right upper lobe, consistent with emphysema.
No focal pulmonary parenchymal consolidation or pleural
effusions identified. No pneumothorax.

Initial ECG:
Sinus tachycardia. Biatrial abnormality. P pulmonale with very
tall P waves in leads II, III and aVF. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2115-9-12**] tachycardia has appeared. Left atrial
abnormality is more pronounced.

TTE [**1-31**]:
Conclusions:
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. Aortic stenosis is
present but could not be quantitated. An aortic valve
vegetation/mass cannot be excluded. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. There is severe mitral
annular calcification. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. No vegetation/mass is seen on the
pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion. The absence of
a vegetation by 2D echocardiography does not exclude
endocarditis if clinically suggested.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], intubated. She was
continued on her COPD regimen of prednisone, levofloxacin, and
albuterol/atrovent MDIs. There were initial difficulties finding
an appropriate ventilatory mode due to problems triggering
breaths. This was present on several modes tried, and it was
decided to keep the ventilator on AC mode, with appropriate
levels of propofol for sedation. The day after her admission,
initial blood cultures grew GPC in pairs and clusters in [**1-9**]
bottles. This was unexpected, given infrequent hospital exposure
and lack of infiltrate on CXR that might suggest a staph PNA. It
was suspected that this was contamination from placement of PIVs
in the ED, but vancomycin was started to cover until speciation
and sensitivities returned. A TTE was also done to assess for
evidence of endocarditis. Thickened AV were noted, but no clear
evidence of vegetations. The team decided that, while a TEE may
be clinically indicated, her wishes, as clearly conveyed by her
son [**Name (NI) 382**] and husband, were that minimal invasive testing be
done, and a TEE was deferred.

Mrs. [**Known lastname **] also had a nasopharyngeal aspirate done for
respiratory viruses, which was positive for influenza A. Droplet
precautions were instituted; however, since her URI symptoms had
been occurring for several days prior to admission, it was not
felt that antiviral therapy would be beneficial, and supportive
measures were continued.

Several conversations were held with Mrs.[**Known lastname 96174**] husband and
son, both physicians. They clearly indicated that Mrs. [**Known lastname **]
would want to be DNR and, if her clinical course did not rapidly
improve within 24-48h of admission, that she would want to be
placed on comfort measures, and the endotracheal tube removed.
While stable from a hemodynamic and respiratory perspective, she
did not demonstrate any increasing ability to be weaned from the
ventilator over this time frame. It was thought by the primary
team that her respiratory failure was probably reversible, given
the likely exacerbation by her inluenza, but that her underlying
COPD was
