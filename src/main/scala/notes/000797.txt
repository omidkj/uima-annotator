Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
GIB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation (electively for EGD only; otherwise DNR/DNI)
colonoscopy
EGD

History of Present Illness:
86M with h/o recent NSTEMI [**1-17**], and recent admission to OSH
for GIB of unclear source (plavix stopped x5d, then restarted),
presenting to [**Hospital1 18**]-N this morning for altered mental status,
lethargy, and black stools.  VS there 97.7  118  16  78/48
90%RA.  Exam notable for guaic positive stool and lethargy. Labs
revealed HCT 22, K 6.0 (hemolyzed), CRE 2.9.  NG lavage revealed
green gastric contents, no blood, no coffee grounds.

He received 2 PIVs, nexium gtt, CTX 1 gm, azithromycin, and 2U
PRBC, with BP improvement to 101/42 HR 89 at time of transfer to
[**Hospital1 18**].

Of note, he was admitted to [**Hospital **] Hospital [**Date range (1) 30614**] in the
setting of weakenss and [**Doctor Last Name **] large dark bowel movement, found to
be anemic (HCT 21.3 on admission, up to 34.1 at discharge after
total 5U PRBCs), and was admitted for evaluation of GIB with
EGD, with course c/b respiratory failure requiring intubation
(per family x3d) felt [**3-14**] CHF vs PNA.  EGD at that time revealed
esophagitis and duodenitis per discharge summary.

In ED VS = 97.8  93  128/58 20  100%.  Labs upon arrival notable
for K 5.8, CRE 2.4 (baseline 1.3 at time of discharge [**6-30**]), HCT
25.6 (after 2U PRBC from OSH), WBC 20.1, INR 1.2.  SBP dropped
to 77/42 with HR 103, so CVL was placed and he was started on
levophed, and received an additional .  SBP improved to 120s
after 1L NS and an additional 1U PRBC, which is still hanging.
GI consult obtained, cardiology made aware.

Past Medical History:

STUDIES:
[**2135-7-14**] ECG: LBBB (old), nl axis, no STE per sgarbossa criteria,
STD and TWI in 1, avl, V4-6 c/w LVH.

[**2135-7-14**] CXR: no obvious infiltrate, pulmonary edema.  ?free air
under right diaphragm. prior cabg and avr seen.

[**2135-7-15**]: Colonoscopy:
There was a very tight bend at the sigmoid colon which could
represent previous anastomosis if patient has had prior surgery.
There were a few areas of a few red drops of blood seen in the
ascending colon which were washed without underlying lesion
seen. Mucosa appeared very friable and occasional contact
bleeding was seen. However, this was minimal and does not
account for transfusion requirement. Polyp in the sigmoid colon
Bile was seen in the terminal ileum and cecum without evidence
of blood. Ileum was normal up to 25 cm. Otherwise normal
colonoscopy to terminal ileum to 20 cm.

[**2135-7-15**]: EGD:
Impression: Mild gastritis.
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum

[**2135-7-15**]: CT ABD/PELVIS
1. No retroperitoneal bleed. Right femoral venous catheter in
expected position.
2. Two rim calcified infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms
measuring up to 3 cm in diameter are chronic, without adjacent
paraaortic abnormality. These may be the sequelae of prior
penetrating ulcer or focal dissection. Dense calcification at
the origin of the renal arteries and SMA; significant stenosis
cannot be excluded.
3. Cholelithiasis without evidence for cholecystitis on this
limited non-contrast exam.

[**2135-7-16**] Echo
 The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
inferior and infero-lateral akinesis with septal hypokinesis. No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
ventricular septal defect. A bioprosthetic aortic valve
prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well
seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular
gradients. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild functional mitral
stenosis (mean gradient 5 mmHg) due to mitral annular
calcification. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
# GIB - Patient having melanotic stools with hemodynamic
instability requiring total of (6units, last transfusion on
[**2135-7-15**]) of pRBCs at [**Hospital1 18**]. GI was consulted. EGD was negative
for acute bleed. Colonoscopy was negative for acute bleed. CT
scan was negative for RP bleed. Hemolysis labs were negative.
Hct remained stable since last transfusion on [**2135-7-15**]

# hypotension - Initially concerning for GIB given guaic
positive stool, decreased HCT, and recent similar admission.
ddx also included sepsis, so evaluated for possible sources with
CXR, Bcx, and UCx. CXR was negative. Bcx and Ucx were negative
Patient was given aggressive IVF and blood as above. After the
colonoscopy he did require levophed briefly, but then was able
to maintain BPs without pressor-support.

# confusion - per family, confusion was typical of pt's
hospitalizations, and likely multifactorial with contribution
from poor neurologic reserve (h/o CVA, chronic vascular
changes), hypotension, and possible
