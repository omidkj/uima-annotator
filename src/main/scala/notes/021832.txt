Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 46206**] was admitted and placed in cervical traction and
strict bedrest. The plan was for him to proceed to the operating
room after his cervical spine became aligned in traction. On
hospital day four he underwent a CT of his cervical spine  did
not show good alignment so the operative procedure was cancelled
and ten more pounds of traction were applied. That evening a
worsening chest x-ray revealing pneumonia and desaturations led
to the patient being transferred to the surgical ICU  and
subsequent intubation. The following day, the patient was placed
on Neo for blood pressure support in the setting of fevers and
hypotension. Operative case was cancelled and the patient was
taken out of traction, but remained in the [**Location (un) 2848**] J collar.

The patient remained on Neo until [**10-11**] and was able to
successfully maintain a systolic BP of 123-130. He remained
extubated until [**10-11**] and tolerated extubation without
difficulty. He was taken to the operating room on 11/0 for an
occipital to C4 fusion. he tolerated the procedure well, and was
transferred to the Neurosurgical care unit. here, he regained
full strength and recovered well.

RESP:
The patient's cultures were positive for MRSA pneumonia; he was
placed on Vancomycin/Zosyn for 8 days.  The Zosyn was
discontinued,and the vanc is to be continued until [**2114-10-30**]
