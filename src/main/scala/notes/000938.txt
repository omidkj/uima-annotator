Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, hypertension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
87 year old female with history of poorly controlled
hypertension, CHF, CAD presents with dyspnea of sudden onset the
morning of admission. She reports strict adherence to
medications and diet restrictions (no salt, no sugar, limits
fluid intake).  In the ED, she was found to have a RR of 30, O2
= 77%, BP of 220/P and placed on BiPAP.  On exam, she had
wheezing and crackles, lower extremity edema. CXR showed fluffy
infiltrates.  Patient also noted to have cellulitis on left
lower leg.  She recieved one dose of levofloxacin, aspirin,
lasix and started on a nitroglycerin gtt.  She was afebrile,
transfer vitals 98 73 175.67 24 100% on bipap.  She continued to
be dyspneic although her blood pressure did improve on the nitro
gtt.
.
Of note, she was recently admitted in [**Month (only) 116**], acutely dyspneic with
hypertension in the setting of a CHF exacerbation.
.
On the floor, she appeared to be comfortable but frustrated. Per
report, her SBP was 170 yesterday.

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI


Past Medical History:
1. Coronary artery disease status post inferior myocardial
infarction in [**2157**], treated with balloon angioplasty of the RCA.
Complicated by an RCA dissection.

branch with 70% stenosis in the lower pole, all of which was
unfavorable to PCI.
3. Combined diastolic and systolic heart failure. Most recent
EF: 40% per cards note.
4. Peripheral arterial disease with a left superior femoral
artery angioplasty complicated by dissection requiring stent in

Imaging:
CXR [**2168-9-16**]:  Fine detail is obscurred by motion artifact.
Within this limitation, perihilar haziness, cardiomegaly and
cephalization of the pulmonary vessels are similar to prior. No
new focal consolidation.  Atherosclerotic calcification of the
aortic arch is noted. The mediastinal silhouette is otherwise
unremarkable. No appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
.
TTE [**2168-9-16**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid to
distal anteroseptal and inferior hypokinesis. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve
area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2168-6-16**], the
severity of mitral regurgitation has decreased, the other
findings are similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Hypertension: Admitted to MICU on nitro gtt, able to wean from
drip over the first hospital day.  Transitioned to home BP meds
on HD #1.  One episode of HTN systolics in 180s, given
hydralazine 10mg and lasix 20mg with return to SBP 140s.  On HD
#2 isosorbide mononitrate increased to 30mg [**Hospital1 **].  After some
clarification over her home dosing, written to increase to 30mg
tid (her home dose is 90mg ER q day.)  BP stable on increased
regimen, but continues to be difficult to control and should be
followed up closely.

# Dyspnea/CHF Excerbation/Pulmonary edema: Responded well to
lasix bolus with no evidence of fluid overload on HD #2.  There
was some confusion over her home lasix dosing, initially she
received 40mg but was then transitioned to 20mg q day.  Patient
has underlying COPD for which her home nebs were required.

# h/o NSTEMI: Patient was continued on aspirin 325mg, plavix
75mg and statin.  ECHO showed no change from prior.  She was
ruled out for MI with serial cardiac enzymes and repeat ECG.

# Cellulitis LLE: Initially started on
Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole + Amoxicillin-clavulanate but Cre
increased.  Bactrim was discontinued and patient was switched
from Augmentin to doxycycline.  She is discharged on
doxycycline.

# DIABETES: Patient's ALF medications were different from what
was listed in OMR so her initial home insulin regimen was
incorrect.  She was placed on sliding scale until her home
dosing was clarified through [**Last Name (un) **].  She is now written for NPH
16 units q am with sliding scale at meals.

# Right Shoulder Pain:  The patient has chronic right shoulder
pain due to known torn rotator cuff.  Received home lidoderm
patch and continued to have significant pain for which she is
discharged on oxycodone.  Please follow-up pain control.

# Bacteriuria:  The patient had a positive urine culture without
symptoms (no dysuria, no increased urinary frequency).  As she
was asymptomatic, she did not receive treatment. However, it
should be noted she received a full course of antibiotics as
described above for cellulitis.

# Pending Blood Culture:  The patient has one pending blood
culture from the ED on [**2168-9-16**] which has shown NGTD, but should
be followed-up.
