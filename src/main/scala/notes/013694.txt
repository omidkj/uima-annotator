Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 12**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy, no intervention


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 76 yo M with PMHx of stage IV NSCLC who presents with
three weeks of productive cough. The cough is productive of
white sputum, no hemoptysis. The day prior to admission he
stated he closed a garage door with his right hand then began
having left lower chest pain. The pain was worse with
inspiration. It prevented him from taking a deep breath in. He
states that since the pain started he has also been short of
breath at rest. In the ED, initial vital signs were: T 102.1 P
130s SBP 200s R 30s O2 sat 88% RA. He was wheezing on exam and
had CXR c/w LLL PNA. EKG showed sinus tachy with nonspecific
lateral ST-T changes. He was given nebs, fluids, morphine,
vanco/levo/flagyl and had improvement in VS to HR 120s, BP 170s,
RR 30, 100% 2L. Labs notable for stable HCT at 27, stable Cr at
1.4, and lactate 1.1, neg CE x1, and was transferred to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he was breathing at 40, which decreased to
~13/minute with morphine and nebulizers. He was treated with
vancomycin and levofloxacin, with intention to add anaerobic
coverage if decompensated.
.
On arrival to the OMED floor, he is comfortable and satting 100%
on 4L nasal cannula. He reports that his shortness of breath is
much improved and has no current complaints.

.
[**10-22**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia. Borderline low limb lead voltage.
Prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2146-9-6**] the rate has increased. Otherwise,
no diagnostic interim change.
.
[**10-22**] CXR: 1. Mild interstitial edema. 2. Left lower lobe mass as
seen on recent CT with new left-sided pleural effusion and left
basilar atelectasis and/or pneumonia (likely post-obstructive).
.
[**10-23**] CXR: Mild interstitial edema is unchanged. Right lower lobe
atelectasis is stable. There are low lung volumes.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Left lower lobe
opacity consistent with a lung mass, better visualized in prior
CT from [**9-6**], and post-obstructive pneumonitis is stable.
The left lateral CP angle was not included on the film. Right
subclavian catheter remains in place.
.
[**10-23**] PA/LAT CXR: Bibasilar atelectases have worsened. Minimally
improved interstitial edema.  No other change.
.
[**10-24**] CT Chest: 1. No CT evidence of pulmonary embolism. 2.
Marked enlargement of left lower lobe mass and left hilar
lymphadenopathy.
The left lower lobe mass obstructs adjacent bronchi, resulting
in post-
obstructive atelectasis and/or consolidation within the lower
lobe and
inferior segment of the lingula. 3. New small pericardial and
small left pleural effusion. 4. No significant change in right
apical and superior segment right lower lobe pulmonary nodules,
with morphology concerning for possible synchronous neoplasms.
5. Slight increase in left paratracheal and right hilar lymph
nodes.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 76 yo M with PMHx of stage IV NSCLC who presents with 3 wks
of productive cough and now with hypoxia, tachycardia, and
hypertension.
.
# PNEUMONIA: Clinical picture and chest xray most suggestive of
LLL pneumonia, possibly post obstructive. Initially treated with
vancomycin and levofloxacin; flagyl added for additional
anaerobic coverage. Other considerations in the differential of
shortness of breath include pulmonary embolism, ACS. CT chest
showed LLL pneumonia. He was evaluated by IP via bronchoscopy;
there was no stent placed. Radiation oncology saw the patient
and set up a follow up appointment for additional consideration
of radiation to the mass. He was discharged to complete a course
of levofloxacin and metronidazole.
.
# COPD: emphysema per pulmonary notes but FEV1/FVC 105% of
predicted and FEV1 85% of predicted in [**3-26**]. Given nebs during
the hospitalization.
.
# Renal Failure: baseline Cr 1.4-1.7. Stayed at baseline
throughout the admission.
.
# Hypertension: Continued lisinopril and HCTZ with holding
parameters.
.
# Tachycardia: sinus tachycardia. Likely related to fever and
pneumonia. Resolved for now, will continue to monitor.
.
# Hypercholesterolemia: continued statin.
.
# Pain: had pleuritic chest pain on admission. CTA negative for
PE; thought secondary to pleural proximity of pneumonia. Treated
with pain medications titrated to good effect.
.
# Lung Cancer: NSCLC, not currently on chemotherapy. Per onc
notes previous chemo regimen has been palliative chemo. He has
stage IV NSCLC. Further management per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4149**]; follow up with
rad-onc on [**11-2**], follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4149**] on [**11-3**].
