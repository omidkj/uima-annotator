CXR [**2169-10-20**]:
FINDINGS: Lung volumes are diminished. There is diffuse
interstitial and alveolar edema and engorgement of the [**Year (4 digits) 1106**]
pedicle. Calcified plaque is seen at the aortic arch. The
cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable accounting for patient
and technical factors. No definite large effusion is noted.
Limited evaluation of the left costophrenic angle due to the
enlarged cardiac silhouette. There is no pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: Heart failure. Recommend repeat radiography after
appropriate diuresis to assess for underlying infection

CT head [**2169-10-21**]:
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

CXR [**2169-10-22**]:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant change. The distribution of the pre-existing
parenchymal opacities, likely caused by pulmonary edema, is
changed but its overall severity has not decreased. Unchanged
appearance of the cardiac silhouette. Unchanged mild
retrocardiac atelectasis.

ECHO [**2169-10-23**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with hypokinesis of the distal half of the septum and anterior
wall, distal inferior wall and apex. The apex is not aneurysmal.
The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 40 %). No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aorti
