HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 48 year old woman with
presumptive diagnosis of Crohn's disease presumptively, PUD
diagnosed in [**2087**] which was refractory to medical management
requiring two operations, a vagotomy/antrectomy and Billroth
obstruction requiring two additional surgeries, a Roux-en-Y
and a revision.  Despite these aggressive interventions, the
patient has been unable to tolerate p.o. feeds without
substantial pain.  The patient presents with total parenteral
nutrition chronically.

In [**2100-2-21**], small intestine biopsy found to be consistent
stomach area, subsequently the patient was found to be ANCA
negative with gastrointestinal series and computerized axial

was then started on Prednisone 60 mg q.d.  The patient was in
this state of health until four days prior to admission when
she began to develop fevers up to 104?????? with nightsweats and
increase in baseline nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.  One day
prior to admission, the patient developed a dry cough,
dependent edema and fatigue.  The patient presented to the
[**Hospital6 256**] for further evaluation.

pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation, extraocular movements intact, mucous membranes

bilateral lung fields, in some segments late inspiratory
crackles are audible.  Abdominal examination, slightly
distended diffusely tender to palpation, positive bowel
sounds.  Well healed midline scar, no rebound tenderness.
Chest examination, Hickman site clean, dry and intact without
erythema.  Extremity examination with 2+ pitting edema up to
the knees.  Neurological examination, cranial nerves II
through XII grossly intact to motor and sensory examination.
Mental status intact.  Rectal examination was guaiac positive
as per surgery team.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 15.7, hematocrit
28.9, white count differential 70% neutrophils, 13% bands, 9%
lymphs, 8% monos, platelet count 300, PT 11.8, PTT 30.0, INR
0.9.  Urinalysis, color yellow, specific gravity 1.034,
negative for blood, nitrates, glucose, ketones, bilirubin 30
mg/dl of protein, 0-2 red blood cells, [**1-25**] white blood cells,
no bacteria or yeast.  +/+ mucous noted.  Glucose 93, sodium
138, potassium 3.4, chloride 99, bicarbonate 22, BUN 19,
creatinine .2.  ALT 49, AST 82, alkaline phosphatase 1101,
amylase 18, total bilirubin .6, lipase 19, albumin 2.6,
calcium 7.3, phosphate 3.4, magnesium 1.8.  Chest x-ray
significant for severe bilateral opacities.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the Emergency Department the patient was
afebrile, oxygen saturation of 84% on room air, 92% on 4
liters.  Examined by the Surgery Team for abdominal symptoms
and was found to have a nonacute abdomen.  Sputum cultures
sent times three for pneumocystis carinii pneumonia as well
as blood cultures.  The patient was begun on broad coverage
to cover pneumocystis carinii pneumonia versus atypical
pneumonia.  Antibiotics included Levofloxacin, Clindamycin,
Primaquine.  Right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed
for the high liver function tests showing a large amount of
layering sludge in the gallbladder with a normal liver.

On [**6-25**], the first of an eventual 4 out of 5 blood
cultures returned as positive for yeast.  The right
subclavian Hickman was pulled and tip sent for culture.  The
patient was started on Amphotericin B, Pripto,
Cytomegalovirus, HSV, legionella studies sent as well as
stool studies for fecal leukocytes, ova and parasites.  On
[**6-26**], holosystolic murmur located in the lower left
sternal border was noted, I/VI and echocardiogram was
performed to evaluate for endocarditis, the results of which
were negative.  On this day the patient's cough became
productive, sputums were sent for multiple studies and
arterial blood gases was performed for increasing oxygen
requirement.  The patient was sating 93 to 100% on 70% face
mask.  Arterial blood gases showed a pH of 7.42, pCO2 of 45,
pO2 of 66, total bicarbonate of 30, base 3.  The patient was
taken for bronchoscopy and [**Male First Name (un) **], intubated electively for
hypoxia.  On bronchoscopic examination no abnormalities were
visualized with microcystic and cytocytic studies sent.  The
patient was extubated the day following the procedure, 97 to
98% on 50% face mask.  The patient's pneumocystic carinii
pneumonia medications were switched from Clindamycin and
Primaquine to Pentamidine by the pulmonary team.

On [**6-27**], the patient had a hematocrit of 24.7, received 1
unit of packed red blood cells with a hematocrit revised to
only 25.7.  The following day she received two more units of
packed red blood cells rising appropriately to 30.1.
Echocardiogram results revealed ejection fraction of greater
than 55%, mildly thickened mitral valve leaflet, normal
aortic valve leaflet, no evidence of endocarditis.  On [**6-29**], the patient's sputum cultures grew out [**Female First Name (un) 564**] Albicans
believed to be a contaminate.  Yeast species for the blood
cultures described as Parapsilosis.  The patient was kept on
intravenous Amphotericin as [**Female First Name (un) 564**] Parapsilosis can be
resistant to Fluconazole as suggested by the Infectious
Disease Service.  On [**6-30**], the patient's respiratory
status began to improve with an oxygen saturation of 93% on
2.5 liters.  On this date the patient first began to complain
of her severe back pain which was treated initially with prn
Morphine.  The patient was treated with Dilaudid PCA Zanaflex
with prn Morphine discontinued.  On [**7-1**], an magnetic
resonance imaging scan of the spine was performed for
evaluation of the lower back pain.  Results were negative for
stenosis foraminal narrowing, nerve/cord impingement, normal
alignment was noted.

On [**7-2**], given the negative blood culture results from
[**6-29**], the patient had a repeat PICC line placement under
fluoroscopic guidance.  The patient's pulmonary status at
this time was much improved.  She was sating 94% on 2 liters.
The patient was at this point evaluated by physical therapy
and felt to be safe to return home with supplemental oxygen.

The patient was discharged [**7-3**] in fair condition.
