Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Ventricular tachycardia ablation


History of Present Illness:
82F h/o CAD s/p CABG, HTN, DM, CRI, bilateral RAS s/p stenting,
h/o atrial flutter transferred from OSH after presenting with
chest pain and found to have stable wide complex tachycardia.
Had been feeling well until the morning of admission when she
developed diarrhea and nausea with emesis x 1. Began to
experience SSCP radiating to the back at 5pm that was unrelieved
by nitro. No associated SOB, diaphoresis. Has not had angina
since CABG. The patient called EMS who found her in stable wide
complex tachycardia with rate 200's. Given 2x lidocaine boluses
with resolution of the tachycardia and chest pain. Presented to
[**Location (un) 620**] ED where she again developed wide complex tachycardia
captured on ECG, likely VT. Given amiodarone boluses and placed
on amiodarone gtt with termination of arrythmia. Transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation. Currently CP free. Denies resting
SOB, edema, PND, or orthopnea. Endorses DOE with 1 flight
stairs. No abdominal pain.

COMMENTS:
1. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated systolic hypertension and
mildly
elevated biventricular filling pressures.  The cardiac index was
normal at 3.8 L/min/m2.
2. Selective native coronary arteriography demonstrated total
occlusion of all coronary arteries proximally.
3. Selective graft angiography was performed.  The LIMA to LAD
was
widely patent.  The RCA filled well via collaterals from the
LAD.  The SVG to OM1 was widely patent.  The SVG to RCA was
totally occluded proximally.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel native coronary artery disease.
2. Patent LIMA to LAD and SVG to OM1.
3. Normal cardiac output.
4. Systolic hypertension.
.
TTE ([**1-/2135**]):
CONCLUSIONS:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate symmetric
left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is hypokinesis of the inferior and posterior
walls, but the overall ejection fraction is well-preserved
(50-60 percent). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is no significant aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved left
ventricular ejection fraction, inferior-posterior hypokinesis,
and probable diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle.

Brief Hospital Course:
82F with CAD s/p CABG, CHF, DM2, CRI presents with SSCP and
stable VT. No more episodes VT or CP during admission. Unable to
induce VT on EP study but underwent empiric VT ablation based on
[**Month/Day/Year **] mapping.
.
# Wide complex tachycardia: likely VT based on OSH ECG given
left axis, atypical RBBB; thought to be originating from prior
inferior MI [**Month/Day/Year **] rather than new ischemia. at presentation, the
patient was asymptomatic and in sinus. transferred from OSH on
amiodarone gtt but discontinued to aide in ability to induce VT
at EP study. no more VT episodes during admission. underwent
cardiac MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] mapping. at EP study on [**10-27**], they were
unable to induce VT. the patient underwent presumptive ablation
of inferior/septal myocardial [**Month/Day (4) **]. f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] next week.
.
# CAD: s/p CABG with 2/3 grafts patent on [**2133**] cath. cardiac
enzymes positive in the setting of rapid sustained VT. concern
for ACS as may have new obstructing graft lesion however given
that symptoms of chest pain resolved when arrythmia terminated
thought to be less likely. she was contiued on ASA, plavix,
statin, beta blocker, and nitrate. heparin gtt was discontinued.
cardiac MR was performed (see above for results) for [**Year (4 digits) **]
mapping prior to ablation. no cardiac cath given less likely VT
from active ischemia and poor baseline renal function. she was
restarted on all of her home dose medications prior to
discharge.
.
# CHF: preserved EF on last echo, likely distolic dysfunction.
elevated JVP (possibly related to TR) but no edema or rales on
exam. she was given a low sodium diet, daily weights, strict
I/Os. lasix was initially held as thought slightly volume
depleted from vomiting and diarrhea prior to admission,
supported by exam and pre-renal indices. she maintained good
SaO2 and was restarted on lasix 40mg [**Hospital1 **] was restarted at
discharge.
.
# HTN: elevated BPs at admission in the setting of not receiving
her home medications. initially, clonidine and ACEi were held to
give room to up-titrate beta-blocker given VT and concern for
ACS. BPs remained slightly elevated at discharge (SBP 130-170).
She was re
