Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 12174**]
Chief Complaint:
Encephalopathy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Nasogastric Tube


History of Present Illness:
HPI:
41 yo M with PMH of pulmonary hypertension, ESLD from alcohol
and hepatitis C on [**First Name3 (LF) **] list, known moderate esophageal
varices by EGD [**2147-12-7**], who has a history of multiple episodes
of unresponsiveness requiring intubation.
.
On this admission, he was found down at home by his mother with
his home CPAP mask off and vomitus around him. Per mother, no
vomitus in the mask. EMS called, but pt unable to be intubated
in the field. Brought to [**Hospital3 2737**], intubated with
Rocuronium for airway protection, OGT placed, which produced
100cc pink-tinged fluid. ABG was 7.39/35/434. Initial labs at
[**Hospital **] hosp revealed Hct 23 (BL upon discharge [**2147-12-3**] was
24.5), and he was given 1 units PRBCs at [**Hospital1 **], lactulose 15
ML, along with Ertepenem for aspiration pneumonia. He was
transiently hypotensive to SBP 90s, received 2L NS with good
effect. Also received Vitamin K 2.5mg IV for INR 1.9 (BL).
Ammonia was 480 at [**Hospital1 **]. Blood toxicology positive for
benzodiazepines. U/A negative. 2 sets of blood cultures and
urine cultures sent. Of note he had outpatient paracentesis on
[**2147-12-19**] at [**Hospital1 18**]. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED as he receives his
liver care here.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS= 121/67, HR 86, RR 14, 100% ventilator
(AC, FI02 100%, TV 500, RR 19, Peep 5). CT head done b/c of AMS
and was unremarkable. CT torso done and wet read shows massive
ascites but no other acute pathology. Hepatology consulted,
recommended starting octreotide gtt (25mcg bolus, followed by
24mcg/hr) and IV protonix. He also received 1gm vancomycin for
gram postive coverage (resp source suspected).
.
On the floor, patient was doing well and getting ready for
discharge, when he was noted to be minimally responsive by the
phlebotomist. He was evaluated by nightfloat who found him
completely unresponsive to sternal rub and pain (no arousal with
ABG). He was on BIPAP overnight but had not gotten his PM
lactulose dose though had had several bowel movements during the
day.

[**2147-12-19**] US Guided Paracentesis:
INDICATION: 41-year-old man with cirrhosis on liver [**Month/Day/Year **]
list; has
gained 15 pounds since last paracentesis on [**12-4**].

IMPRESSION: Successful ultrasound-guided therapeutic
paracentesis: 6.5
liters obtained.
[**2147-12-20**] CT Head:
INDICATION: 41-year-old man with altered mental status and
hypertension.
Comparison is made to the prior head CT of [**2147-11-30**],
and MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**2147-10-28**].
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: No edema, masses, mass effect, hemorrhage,
or
infarction is detected. Ventricles and sulci are mildly
prominent consistent with involutional changes. Diffuse
periventricular white matter hypodensities are unchanged
compared to the prior study and are compatible with small vessel
ischemic changes based on the prior MRI. The visualized part of
the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. No
fracture is identified.

IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial pathology including no hemorrhage.
2. Unchanged periventricular white matter hypodensities which
are compatible with small vessel ischemic change.
[**2147-12-20**] CT ABD
HISTORY: 41-year-old man with severe cirrhosis, status post
paracentesis
yesterday, with 6.5 liters of fluid drainage. Subsequently
became hypotensive and required intubation. Evaluate for acute
process.

TECHNIQUE: Non-contreast helical MDCT images were acquired from
the thoracic inlet to the pubic symphysis. Multiplanar
reformatted images were obtained in 5-mm slice thickness.

COMPARISON: CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast on [**2147-11-5**].

FINDINGS:
CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: The tracheobronchial architecture is
patent and
normally aerated to the subsegemental levels. The cardiac size
is within
normal limits. A nasogastric tube is seen in the esophagus. And
an
endotracheal tube are visualized with the tip terminating
slightly superior to the carina. There is no evidence of
pneumothorax. There is no evidence of pleural effusion.

CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is a large amount of simple
ascites in the intraperitoneal cavity. There is no evidence of
acute hemorrhage. The liver is again seen with unchanged severe
nodularity and shrunken in size, but there is no evidence of
focal lesion, allowing for the limits of the non-contrast study.
There are numerous small hyperdense gallstones in the
gallbladder, also unchanged, but no evidence of acute
cholecystitis. The tip of the NG tube is seen terminating at the
antrum of the stomach. The stomach, pancreas, duodenum are
normal without evidence of abnormality, allowing for the
obscuration of the ascites. There is mild thickening of the
jejunal wall, unchanged, and likely secondary to the underlying
liver disease. The spleen is mildy enlarged, but unchanged.
There are unchanged perisple
