History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 36818**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] an 87 year old woman hx atrial fibrillation on
coumadin, right thalamic infarct, who was last known to be well
at 8pm on [**2178-3-24**], who was found by a nursing aide at 8am on
[**3-25**] to be dysarthria and severely  phasic. The patient was able
to say that she was "cold". She had left-sided weakness. EMS was
called at 8:15am and patient was taken to [**Hospital1 18**]. En route, her
fs was 221 and she vomited two times.

In the ED, her exam was pupils reactive, with eye deviation to
the right, not following commands, and non verbal. Her arms were
drifting down bilaterally. At 9:49am, the patient developed
ventricular tachycardia. Vitals were BP 175/118 and HR 124. She
was given amiodarone 150mg iv once, followed by amiodarone
0.5mg/min drip. Patient was intubated and sedated with Propofol.
Her rhythm became atrial fib with rate in the 120's to 140's.
Her BP decreased to 119/74.

CT brain did not show early signs of infarct or bleed. CTA did
not show cutoff of an intracranial vessel. CT perfusion shows
increased mean transit time of the right MCA and left ACA
region. Patient was outside the window for TPA or mechanical
clot retrieval.  She was admitted to the SICU.

Past Medical History:
Atrial Fibrillation
CVA
HTN
Hypercholesterolemia
Depression
Anxiety


Social History:
Lives alone in independent living facility since her husband
died. She has an aide for 12 hours per day, then for 1 hour in
the evening. At baseline, 1 assist transfer to wheelchair. 3
sons who live in the area, 1 son is a physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) 4273**] EtOH,
tobacco or IDU.


Family History:
Mother had CVA.

STUDIES:
========
[**3-25**] CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS; CTA NECK W&W/OC & RECONS
IMPRESSION:
1. CT perfusion findings are consistent with acute ischemia in
the right MCA and right MCA/ACA watershed distribution as well
as the left ACA distribution. Possible acute ischemia in the
left PCA territory. No evidence for intravascular thrombus or
intracranial hemorrhage.
2. 3-mm left PCA P2 segment aneurysm without evidence for
hemorrhage.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2178-3-25**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Endotracheal tube extending into the left main stem bronchus.
Repositioning is required. This was discussed with the nurse
caring for the patient, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], at cell number [**Serial Number 36819**], at
approximately 10:45 a.m.
2. Increased opacity of the left lung base, possibly
representing aspiration. Followup radiographs are recommended.
3. Stable cardiomegaly with no evidence of acute congestive
heart failure.

EKG [**3-25**]
Atrial fibrillation, average ventricular rate 120. Left anterior
hemiblock.  Intraventricular conduction delay. Non-specific
lateral repolarization changes. Cannot exclude anterior
m
