[**2191-10-6**] CHEST, PORTABLE UPRIGHT FRONTAL VIEW: The suprahilar
right lung mass is again identified, now measuring 3.9cm
(previously 2.9cm). Right apical opacity may reflect
atelectasis, pneumonia or pulmonary infarct. The cardiac
silhouette is unchanged. Hilar contours are stable. There is no
effusion on this frontal view. Shunt catheter courses over the
right lung into the peritoneum.
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval growth of right suprahilar lung mass.
2. Right apical opacity is a non-specific finding, may reflect
atelectasis, pneumonia, or pulmonary infarct.
A wet read was entered into the ED Dashboard on [**2191-10-6**].

CHEST XRAY [**2191-10-7**]:
Left lung is clear. Right infrahilar consolidation slightly
worse today
compared to [**10-6**]. Right suprahilar mass noted. Heart
size is normal though increased over 24 hours. Right pleural
effusion is small if any. No pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
71 year old male with multiple medical problems including
diastolic HF, [**Name (NI) 7792**], CVA in [**5-20**] with baseline L hemiparesis
and limited vocalization, Alzheimer's dementia, and hx of
multiple resistant infections, recent admission in [**8-21**] with
similar presentation, admitted from nursing home with fever,
dyspnea, hypoxia, and hyperglycemia found to have sepsis/PNA.

1. Hypovolemic Shock and Sepsis:He was originally admitted to
the medical ICU with leukocytosis and tachypnea. A central
venous femoral catheter was placed for access. He was noted to
have a right apical infiltrate and enlarging right upper lobe
mass on chest x-ray.  This was most consistent with
post-obstructive vs. health-care associated pneumonia.  Given
his history of MRSA and ESBL Klebsiella pneumonia, he was
started on vancomycin and meropenen for a total course of 14
days.  He was given IV fluids in the ED and in the ICU.  Despite
this, he became hypotensive and Levophed was started.  A few
hours after Levophed initiation, he became bradycardic with a
heart rate in the 30s and systolic blood pressure noted to be as
low as 65.  He was given 1 amp of atropine and 1 amp of sodium
bicarbonate.  Levophed was increased and 2 liters of normal
saline were bolused.  His heart rate and blood pressure
recovered and he never lost his pulse.  He was thought to be
significantly hypovolemic given an increased BUN/Cr ratio,
hypernatremia and ph
