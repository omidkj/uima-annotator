EKG: Persistent elevations in V2-V5
.
[**2104-2-20**] Transthoracic Echocardiogram demonstrates EF30%.
Moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with mid to distal septal, anterior, antero-lateral
and apical hypokinesis to akinesis. No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size is normal with borderline
normal free wall function. Trivial pericardial effusion. Trivial
MR.
[**2104-2-21**] Chest X-ray: Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of
normal in size, and pulmonary vascularity is within normal
limits for portable semi-upright technique. Patchy opacities in
both infrahilar areas, most prominent in the left retrocardiac
region, could be due to atelectasis, aspiration and less likely
developing infection.

Cardiac catheterization: [**2104-2-19**]
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this left dominant system
demonstrated single vessel disease. The LMCA, LCx and RCA had
minimal
disease. The LAD had a total occlusion mid-vessel.
2. Successful PCI of the mid-LAD with non-overlapping Promus
DES:
2.5x18mm distally and 3.0x23mm proximally (post-dilated to
3.5mm).
3. Successful closure of the right femoral arteriotomy site with
a 6F
Perclose device.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful PCI of the LAD with DES.


Brief Hospital Course:
71 year-old male presenting with 4 days of severe chest pain
with elevated cardiac biomarkers transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
cardiac catheterization and stent placement.

#STEMI:
Patient presented s/p [**Hospital **] transferred from outside hospital
with peak CK [**2093**] and Trop-I of 74, reportedly after 4 days of
constant chest pain.  Two drug-eluting stents were placed in the
mid-LAD and the mid-distal LAD for total occlusion.  He was
transferred to the CCU where he recieved frequent morphine
boluses and a nitroglycerin drip for chest pain.  Patient
continued to endorse chest pain overnight post procedure.  It
was similar in quality and site to presentation pain, but less
intense.  Chest pain persisted intermittently on the day
following procedure, but only with exertion, which was also
accompanied by SOB.  Patient completed integrilin drip for 18hrs
post procedure.  EKG shows persistent ST elevations in leads
V2-V5 after intervention.  Post-procedure TTE demonstrated EF30%
as well as moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with mid to distal septal, anterior, antero-lateral
and apical hypokinesis to akinesis. No VSD, masses, or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle. Trivial pericardial effusion.
Trivial MR.  In addition to aspirin patient was treated with
prasugrel as an anti-platelet [**Doctor Last Name 360**] indicated for this patient
with post-PCI angina and to reduce stent thrombosis and ischemic
events.  Metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] was initiated, well tolerated by
blood pressure during hospitalization.  Low dose ACE inhibitor
was started upon discharge, held initially in the setting of
acute kidney injury.

#Apical hypokinesis.
Patient noted to have Left ventricular akinesis on Echo, so he
was started on anticoagulation for prevention of LV thrombus
formation. He was started on a heparin IV drip then lovenox
injections for bridge to longterm warfarin anticoagulation.  He
was discharged with
