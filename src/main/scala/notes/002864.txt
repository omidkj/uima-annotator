Chief Complaint:
Rt thigh swelling and pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cystoscopy
Thoracocentesis
IVC filter fixation

History of Present Illness:
68 yo male, who presented with right swollen painful thigh for 3
days. He could hardly walk due to the pain and pain is more when
he walks around otherwise while sitting there is minimal pain.
He never had similar compaint before. He was in his usual normal
state of health until [**Month (only) **] when he started to have right
lower abdominal pain and right flank pain for which he seeked
his doctor, percocet was prescribed however it worsened. He also
took Motrin for the last 3 months in addition to percocet for
the pain. In addition to this pain, he had intermittent
hematuria. For this, he had an abdominal US and CT abd/pelvis at
[**Hospital1 2177**], and according to the patient, there was a mass in the
urinary baldder and a cyst in his right kidney. He was reffered
for urology appointment, however his appoitnement was cancelled.
He also mentioned that it seems like he lost weight, however on
the scale it still shows 182, but the wife mentioned that his
arm size was bigger than what it is today. Also, the patient
mentioned that he has a new onset hypertension that started
about 3-4months ago for which he is on anti-hypertensive. In the
last 2-3 weeks, he also noted bilateral scrotal painless
swelling but no lower limb swelling bilaterally until wed. when
he started to have swelling and pain in his right thigh. No
fever or chill or sick contact. 2 years ago he had a left sided
abd pain, for which he also had a CXR that showed 3.5cm mass in
his left lung. For that mass he had an MRI, and he was told that
he doesn't need further MRI, it can be followed up by CXR. He
also mentioned shortness of breath on exertion and dry cough for
the last 3 months. 3-4 months ago he could go upstairs before he
gets SOB, however recently by minimal effort he is SOB. No
associated chest pain or dizziness or sweating or palpitations.
He uses valid-date puffer occasionally within the last few
months with minimal relief. He also described some lower chest
tightness, a few times post-meal, and not with his SOB.

In the ED, initial vs were: 98.3 118 163/72 18 95%. On exam
tender right leg, guiaic negative. Labs notable for WBC 13.3,
creatinine of 2.7 (unclear baseline). UA positive, urine culture
sent. Blood culture sent. LENI showed nonocclusive DVT of the
right distal SFV. He was started on a heparin gtt. He developed
new oxygen requirement in the ED. CXR showed RML opacity
obscuring right heart border. He was given levofloxacin 750mg
for presumed pneumonia. He was given tylenol, and morphine. He
was given 1L IVF. Vitals on transfer: 98.2 117 101/84 18 92%2L
.
On the floor, reports shortness of breath with minimal exertion.

Cytology/histopathology:
[**2137-2-16**]: URINE CYTOLOGY: Very atypical urothelial cells, present
singly and in clusters, suspicious for urothelial
dysplasia/neoplasia.

[**2137-2-19**]: Pleural fluid: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS, Consistent
with poorly differentiated carcinoma. The neoplastic cells are
immunoreactive for keratin AE1/AE3; CAM 5.2, CK7, CK20, focally
positive for B72.3, [**Last Name (un) **]-31.  They show no immunoreactivity for
calretinin, WT-1, TTF-1, P63, CK5/6, CEA, or CD15.  Based on
this immunophenotypic profile, it is difficult to determine the
origin of the tumor.

[**2137-2-19**]: Bladder mass biopsy:
A. Bladder, left lateral dome, deep biopsy:
- Invasive high grade papillary urothelial carcinoma,
extensively invading lamina propria. No definitive muscularis
propria seen. Note: The invasive component is poorly
differentiated, in some areas growing in spindle cells and in
other areas in single pleomorphic cells.

B. Bladder tumor, dome, biopsy:
- High grade papillary urothelial carcinoma, suspicious for
lamina propria invasion. No muscularis propria seen.

Imaging:
--------
[**2137-2-16**]: Lower Ext. Doppler: Non-occlusive thrombosis of the
right distal superficial femoral vein.

[**2137-2-16**]: CT head without contrast: No overt intarcranial
pathology

[**2137-2-17**]: CT Chest w/o contrast:
1. Numerous multifocal pulmonary nodules several of which have a
central
solid component and peripheral ground glass component.
Additional nodules
have a more spiculated contour. Overall, the appearances are
highly
concerning for multifocal metastatic disease.
2. Abnormal soft tissue seen in the mediastinum posterior to the
esophagus
and in the superior paraaortic retroperitoneum consistent with
lymphadenopathy. In addition, there is a large soft tissue mass
in the left
supraclavicular region, likely a metastasis.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right. Possible
solid
components seen bilaterally as described.
4. 3.2-cm likely fat-containing mass at the left base consistent
with a
hamartoma. Stable since [**2132**].

[**2137-2-18**]: ECHO: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricu
