History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 67738**] is a 72 y oF with CAD s/p multiple PCIs, HTN, PVD,
and DMt2 who presented to an OSH with severe chest pain on
[**2188-10-28**]. She describes the pain as a "tightness" in the center
of her chest that she rated as 10 out of 10 on a pain scale.
Onset of pain was while watching television after attending a
relatives funeral. [**Name2 (NI) 1194**] was associated with nausea and shortness
of breath. She denies palpitations, dizziness, diaphoresis,
syncope, recent illness, fever or chills. It is not associated
with position or diet. She states this chest pain is similar to
the chest pain she experienced with her heart attack in [**2185**].
While at home pt took three ntg tablets without relief so she
called EMS.
.
At the OSH she received additional sublingual ntg without relief
and was subsequently placed on ntg drip. EKG was read as
bigeminy and trigeminy. She had Troponin I of 7.[**Street Address(2) 67739**]
depressions in V3-6. She given aspirin and started on heparin
and integrillin drips. She was continued on home plavix and beta
blocker. CXR showed evidence of congestive changes so she was
gently diuresed with lasix. Pt was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
cardiac catheterization.
.
On presentation to the floor, pt admits that her chest pain has
never completely resolved but that it has been maintained at a
level of 1 out of ten since admission. She denies current
palpitations, shortness of breath, and nausea. On review of
systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep
venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for abscence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope. She admits to exertional calf pain despite prior
interventions. She also admits to increased dyspnea on exertion
over the last year.
.
Patient was admitted to floor and the triggered for chest pain
that was not controlled with nitroglycerin SL or drip. She was
bolused for 500 ml IVF for low blood pressures. Shortly
thereafter, she became acutely hypoxic, and was started on face
make oxygen. She was given 40 mg lasix, 2 mg morphine, and
increased nitroglycerin rate. She diuresed well with the lasix.

.
On arrival to the CCU, she was chest pain free and respiratory
distress was resolved.

Social History:

two grandchildren in [**Name (NI) 67740**], MA. Pt admits to an extensive
tobacco history. Pt had quit but recently restarted, smoking [**12-19**]
packs per week. Pt denies any etoh or drug use. Pt currently has
multiple stressors including a son with substance abuse
disorder, a close relative that recently died, a sister recently
diagnosed with [**Name (NI) 309**] body dementia. She is currently raising her
two grandchildren.

Pertinent Results:
Cardiac ECHO ([**11-4**]) The right atrium is markedly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
is not well seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mitral
valve leaflets are not well seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation
is seen (may be underestimated due to poor technical quality).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat
pad.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mildly depressed left
ventricular systolic function. Preserved right ventricular
function.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2188-10-30**],
the severity of mitral regurgitation appears to be reduced, but
image quality is extremely suboptimal. If clinically indicated,
a TEE would better assess the severity of regurgitation.
.
CARDIAC CATH:  1. Selective coronary angiogrpahy in this right
dominant system revealed 2 vessel obstructive coronary disease.
The LMCA had a distal taper. The LAD had an 80% proximal and 80%
mid vessel stenosis. The LCX was subtotally occluded proximally
with TIMI 2 flow. The RCA had ostial dampening with a filling
defect in the proximal stent.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed low systemic blood pressure and
shock physiology with SBP as low as 50 mmHg up to 118 mmHg with
initiation of a dopamine IV gtt. There was moderate to severe
pulmonary hypertension with PASP of 84 mmHg. There was elevated
right and left sided filling pressures with RVEDP of 21 mmHg and
mean PCWP of 60 (with giant V waves noted). The cardiac index
was preserved at 3.40 l/min/m2 on IV dopamine.
3.  Successful PTCA and stenting of the left circumflex with two
overlapping bare metal stents a Microdriver (2.5x24mm) bare
metal stent proximally and a MiniVision (2.5x28mm) bare metal
stent distally.  The stents were postdilated with a 2.5mm
balloon.  Final angiography demonstrated no angiograghically
apparent dissection, no residual stenosis and TIMI III flow
throughout the vessel (See PTCA comments).
4.  Successful placement of an intraortic balloon pump via the
right femoral artery.
Cardiac cath final diagnosis:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate mitral regurgitation noted on perprocedure TTE and
TEE with no disruption of subvalvular apparatus or frank rupture
of the valve leaflets.
3. Pulmonary hypertension
4. Elevated right and left sided filling pressures.
5. Hemodynamic compromise necessitating IABP placement.
6. Successful placement of a 30cc IABP via the right femoral
artery.
7. Successful PTCA and stenting of the LCX with two overlapping
bare metal stents.


Brief Hospital Course:
CARDIOGENIC SHOCK:  Patient was admitted to CCU service for
intractable chest pain without ST elevations.  Shortly after
admission to the CCU, she developed progressive hypotension and
dyspnea.  She was emergently intubated for hypoxia and was
started on dopamine en route to cath lab on [**10-30**].  In the cath
lab, she had two vessel coronary artery disease, moderate mitral
regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension, elevated right and left
sided filling pressures and overall hemodynamic compromise
necessitating IABP placement.  She had successful
