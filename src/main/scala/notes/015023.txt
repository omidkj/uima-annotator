History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 53 M with PMH of COPD, schizoaffective disorder,
depression, HTN who was found down w/albuterol inhaler at side.
He was found to be hypoxic to the 70s. He was intubated at the
scene with succinylcholine, etomidate, fentanyl 250 mg, versed 3
mg by EMS. He also received magnesium 2 mg iv. He was taken to
[**Hospital6 204**] where his initial VS on arrival to
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 189**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] were: P: 112, BP: 56/41, 80% ventilated.  He was
started on levophed and neosynephrine. Had large A-a gradient
and was difficult to ventilate. He remained hypoxic despite high
PEEPs and 100% FiO2. A non-contrast CT was performed at OSH
which showed left sided pleural effusion and large
consolidation. Imaging also showed an old 9th rib fracture,
normal CT head and neck. CT abdomen was unremarkable. He was
started on heparin drip for concern of PE given the difficulty
in ventilating the patient. He then developed UGIB with 1L BRB
per OGT, at which point heparin stopped and he was given
Protonix drip. He also received albuterol, vanc, flagyl,
levaquin, solumedrol, Ceftriaxone. For sedation, he received an
additional 12 mg ativan, 30 mg iv morphine.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], his VS were P: P: 87, BP: 105/70, RR: 14,
02 84% on ventilator. NG lavage showed only coffee ground emesis
and no further BRB. He was given albuterol nebs. A groin line
was placed. On transfer to the MICU, his most recent VS were P:
87, BP: 115/62, RR: 14, O2 89% on CMV PEEP 20, FiO2 98%, plateau
37 on phenylepinephrine 1 mcg/kg/ min.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient was intubated, minimally
responsive. Guaic negative brown stools.

Brief Hospital Course:
53 yom obesity, COPD, schizoaffective disorder, depression, HTN
who was found down w/ albuterol inhaler at side who presented
with respiratory failure and shock.

#Respiratory Failure/ ARDS: Patient admitted with respiratory
failure after requiring intubation in the field for respiratory
distress and unresponsiveness. Pneumonia and pleural effusion
were the main cause of hypoxia. No PE seen on CT but no contrast
given in the setting of his elevated creatinine. LENIs showed no
DVT. He was kept on ARDS net protocol for his mechanical
ventilation. He was given albuterol and ipratroprium MDI q4h.
His pneumonia was treated with vancomycin/ zosyn / levofloxacin
for an 8 day course. The patient failed extubation on two
occasions during the current hospitalization.  Recommendation
was made to proceed with tracheotomy tube placement, but
following extensive and comprehensive discussions with the
patient's HCP, tracheotomy tube placement and chronic mechanical
ventilation were not consistent with the patient's previously
expressed wishes.
Plans were initiated to optimize [**Hospital 228**] medical condition in
preparation for a final extubation trial without plans for
reintubation or resussitation (DNR/DNI).  Following optimization
of medical condition, the patient was extubated, and remained
stable over the intitial 24 hours, primarily demonstrating
aggitation and restlessness, but without meaningful neurological
interaction.  Patient gradually developed respiratory distress
and hypoxemia, and following additoinal discussions with the
patient's HCP, focus of care transitioned to comfort as the
primary goal.
Patient expired comfortably.

#Pulmonary Embolus: patient diagnosed with PE on [**12-12**] and
started on heparin drip. LENIs showed extensive clot in RLE.
Determined to be HIT+ while receiving heparin, so argatroban was
substituted.

#A. Fib: Patient developed a. fib with RVR in setting of new PEs
on [**12-12**]. He was given iv metoprolol and dilt with limited
response and was loaded with amiodarone and then started on po
amiodarone with metoprolol 100 mg po TID.

#Upper GI bleed: [**1-17**] ulcer in antrum in the setting of being
placed on heparin drip. He was treated initially with
pantoprazole drip and pantoprazole [**Hospital1 **]. His hematocrit remained
stable and he did not require a blood transfusion.

# Cardiac ischemia - Cardiac enzymes were elevated and EKG had
ST changes attributed to shock and demand ischemia. ECHO showed
old wall abnormalities. Troponins stabilized. He was continued
on aspirin 81 mg.

#Shock Liver: Patient's transaminitis were likely secondary to
shock liver in the setting of hypotension and hypoxia.
Acetaminophen level negative in tox screen. LFTs continued to
trend down.

#. ARF:  Likely secondary to shock and hypovolemia. Creatinine
continued to normalize. He maintained good urine output.

# Schizoaffective disorder: Lives in group home. He was
continued on his citalopram and topamax. Wellbutrin was stopped
as outside records indicated he had had a recent suspected
seizure.
