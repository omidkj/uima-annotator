FINAL REPORT


INDICATION: History of tracheal stenosis with asthma, new
unexplained oxygen
requirement, and tachycardia, evaluate for pulmonary embolus.

COMPARISON: CT dated [**2103-3-23**].

TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired images of the chest were obtained
before and after
administration of IV contrast as per CTA PA protocol.

CT of the chest with IV contrast: There is no evidence of
pulmonary embolus.
Aortic calcifications are demonstrated. The heart and
pericardium are
unremarkable. There is a tracheostomy tube. The airways appear
patent to the
level of the segmental bronchi bilaterally. Lung windows
demonstrate no
pulmonary nodules or areas of parenchymal consolidation. There
is no pleural
effusion. There are no pathologically enlarged axillary,
mediastinal, or
hilar lymph nodes. Limited noncontrast views of the upper
abdomen are
unremarkable.

Bone minerals reveal no suspicious lytic or sclerotic foci.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of pulmonary embolus.

[**4-30**] chest CTA:
INDICATION: History of tracheal stenosis and asthma with new
hypotension and
hypoxia.

COMPARISON: CTA, [**2103-4-19**].

TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired images of the chest were obtained
before and after
the administration of IV contrast.

CT OF CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is no evidence of pulmonary
embolism. The
tracheostomy tube is in place. There is a central venous line
terminating in
the SVC. There is a 6-mm paratracheal node and 12-mm left
axillary node,
unchanged compared to the prior study. Lung windows demonstrate
a tiny, 1-mm
pleural-based density in the right middle lobe that is unchanged
compared to
the prior study and the study dated [**2103-3-23**]. There is minimal
left basilar
atelectasis. The heart and pericardium are unremarkable. Limited
views of
the upper abdomen are unremarkable.

BONE WINDOWS reveal no suspicious lytic or sclerotic foci.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of pulmonary embolism.

[**5-1**] sinus CT:
HISTORY: Respiratory failure. Sinus pain.

Three views of the sinuses are submitted. The frontal,
maxillary, ethmoid,
and sphenoid sinuses are all clear. Bony structures are
unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of sinusitis

[**4-30**] chest x-ray:
INDICATION: 46-year-old woman with severe asthma, diastolic
congestive heart
failure, tracheal stenosis, and tracheomalacia. Now status post
tracheostomy.

AP view of the chest dated [**2103-4-30**], is compared with PA
and lateral
chest x-ray of [**2103-4-22**]. There is a new right subclavian
PICC line,
which terminates at the cavoatrial junction. There is stable
cardiomegaly.
The lung fields are grossly clear. There is no pneumothorax.
There are no
pleural effusions. There are no focal areas of opacity to
suggest a
consolidative process. The patient is status post tracheostomy.

IMPRESSION: New right PICC line terminating at the cavoatrial
junction. No
pneumothorax. Stable cardiomegaly. Status post tracheostomy
placement.

[**4-16**] trach placement:
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Tracheal stenosis and respiratory
failure from asthma.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Tracheal stenosis and respiratory
failure from asthma.

PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Open tracheostomy tube placement.

ASSISTANT SURGEON: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD

ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal.

INDICATION FOR OPERATION: The patient is a delightful 47-
year-old woman with post tracheostomy tube tracheal stenosis.
She has been intubated in the past for asthma. I evaluated
her with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] for potential treatment of a
tracheal stenosis, but due to her severe asthma and recurrent
intubations, and the fact that the stenosis is not
particularly limiting to her, we elected to treat it
medically. She was recently readmitted with a severe asthma
attack and intubated and required tracheostomy tube
placement. Therefore, the following procedure was performed.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the
oper
