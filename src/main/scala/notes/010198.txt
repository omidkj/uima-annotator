History of Present Illness:
67 year old man with h/o CAD s/p 3v CABG, hypercholesterolemia,
and hypertension, who fell down appoximatly one flight of stairs
[**2128-2-23**], unknown if LOC, and was admitted to NSICU with with a
right skull base fracture extending into the right mastoid and
sphenoid sinuses, multiple foci of intraparenchymal hemorrhage
in the right frontal and temporal areas, and left and right
temporal subdural hematomas, diagnosed by head CT .  He was
initially treated with mannitol and haldol, and started on
clindamycin for sinus fractures.  Repeat head CT [**2128-2-24**] showed
worsening contusions with no midline shift.
.
His mental status deteriorated, and on [**2128-2-25**] at [**Last Name (un) **] bolt
was placed for ICP monitoring, initial ICP 9.  He was started on
Kefzol at that time.  On CT [**2128-2-25**] a new distal MCA watershed
infarct was also noted.  CTA showed no evidence of carotid
stenosis.  Echo on [**2128-2-25**] showed mild EF 35%, inferoseptal and
inferolateral hypokinesis, and impaired relaxation.  The ICP
monitor was pulled [**2128-2-27**], and mannitol was stopped.  C-spine
MRI showed no fracture.
.
On [**2128-2-28**] he was evaluated by Speech/swallow and failed the
swallow study.  A PEG was placed by IR [**2128-3-2**].  Repeat head CTs
on [**2128-3-1**] and [**2128-3-3**] showed stable appearance of the
bitemporal intraparenchymal hemorrhages, SDH, and right skull
fracture.
.
On [**2128-3-3**] the patient spiked temperature to 101.5.  Work-up
including urinalysis, blood cultures, lumbar puncture, chest CT,
LFTs, stool for c. diff, and bilateral LENI's was at first
non-diagnostic, and a medical consult was obtained for further
fever work-up.  Subsequently, blood cultures grew Gram + Staph,
methicillin resistant.  The patient was transferred to the
medicine service for further work-up and treatment of his
bacteremia.
.
On presentation today he opens and closes his eyes.  He does no
arouse to voice.  He responds to pain.  Per report he
occasionally verbalizes, mimics one word sentences, and says
"[**Last Name (un) **]."

Blood cultures:
[**2128-3-4**] Methicillin resistant coag (+) Staph; 3/4 bottles
[**2128-3-3**]: No growth [**3-8**]
[**3-6**], [**3-7**], [**3-8**], [**3-9**]:  no growth

PEG site:
[**2128-3-7**]:  MRSA

Catheter tip:
[**2128-3-3**]:  No growth

Urine cultures:
[**2128-3-4**] No growth

[**2128-3-3**]:  no growth

[**2128-2-23**] CT:

IMPRESSION:  No fracture through the cervical spine.  Fractures
to the right base of the skull as previously described.

IMPRESSION:
1) Multiple contusions with foci of intraparenchymal hemorrhage
in the right frontal, right temporal and left temporal lobes.
There are thin subdural hemorrhages at the left temporal tip
cerebral convexity and the right frontal cerebral convexity.

2) Fractures of the right skull base through the petrous ridge,
extending as far as into the sphenoid sinus, with gas in the
soft tissues of the
infratemporal fossa.  Fracture line extends along the right
temporal to the
right parietal calvarium.

3) Opacification of the right mastoid air cells, right sphnoid
sinus, and
scattered ethmoid air cells, probably related to the fracture
described above.

4) Underlying white matter microvascular changes in both the
corona radiata.


[**2128-3-3**] Head CT:
IMPRESSION:  Unchanged examination with stable bilateral
temporal lobe
intraparenchymal hemorrhages and subdural hematomas.  No new
areas of
hemorrhage nor fractures are visualized.

[**2128-3-5**] CT Abdomen/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of abscess.  Trace fluid adjacent to
the anterior
left liver edge and stranding adjacent to the gastrostomy tube,
likely related to the recent procedure.

[**2128-3-3**] Bilateral lower extremity dopplers: negative for DVT

[**2128-2-23**], unknown if LOC, and was admitted to NSICU with with a
right skull base fracture extending into the right mastoid and

in the right frontal and temporal areas, and left and right
temporal subdural hematomas, suffered left MCA watershed
infarct, and subsequently developed MRSA bacteremia.  For
details of hospitalization from [**Date range (3) 46564**] while under the
care of the Neurosurgery team, please see the note dated
[**2128-3-3**].  As per the HPI, on [**2128-3-3**] the patient spiked a fever
to 101.  Blood cultures drawn on [**2128-3-3**] were negative; those on
[**2128-3-4**], however, were positive (4/4 bottles) for MRSA
bacteremia.  He was transferred to the medical service for
