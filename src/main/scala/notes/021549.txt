Pertinent Results:
CT/CTV [**1-13**] :
1. Status post gunshot injury with multiple radiodense foci
related to the
gunshots noted in the soft tissues of the scalp at the vertex,
in the brain parenchyma in the frontal and the parietal lobes at
the vertex, and in very close proximity to the superior sagittal
sinus. A few tiny foci are noted in extremely close proximity to
the superior sagittal sinus at the vertex and an intrasinus
location cannot be completely excluded. However, there is no
obvious contrast extravasation to suggest obvious injury within
the limitations of artifacts. Some degree of cerebral edema, as
mentioned in the report.
2. Multiple fractures involving the left and the right parietal
bones as
described above, with displaced and shattered fragments on the
left side,
likely exit site. A few displaced fragments on the right side as
described
above.
3. Small areas of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the vertex, along
with possible small subdural hemorrhage along the falx and
minimal amount in the right lateral ventricle. Few possible foci
of parenchymal contusion are also noted in the vicinity of the
gunshot wounds, in the brain parenchyma at the vertex.Small
areas of pneumocephalus and soft tissue laceration as described
above.
4. Possibility of venous air embolism and dural tear that can
lead onto CSF leak and intracranial hypotension later cannot be
completely excluded.

CT Head [**1-16**]
1. Interval development of large area of hypodensity along the
superior
frontal lobes near the vertex, concerning for interval
development of
parenchymal edema versus infarction.

2. Mild amount of intra-axial/subarachnoid hemorrhage injury. No

intraventricular hemorrhagic extension or hydrocephalus.

CT Head [**1-18**]
 Little change from [**2139-1-16**]. Large area of hypodensity

involving the bilateral frontal lobes with associated metallic
and osseous
fragments, are compatible with history of gunshot wound. There
is no new
parenchymal edema. Small amount of intracranial hemorrhage is
also stable,
without new hemorrhagic focus identified. Ventricles are stable
in size, and there is again no shift of midline structures.
Basal cisterns are patent.

CT head with contrast [**2139-1-21**]:
Overall stable examination as compared to [**2139-1-18**].
Herniated brain tissue, similar in extent to the prior
examination. No evidence of abscess or fluid collection. The
presence of cerebritis, however, would be difficult to exclude
on this examination.

Chest X ray [**1-20**]

1. New large right pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum without
tension.
2. Moderate-to-large pneumoperitoneum, likely related to PEG
placement.
3. New left aspiration.

Chest X ray [**1-24**]
  One view. Comparison with the previous study done [**2139-1-23**].
There is
interval decrease in the right apical pneumothorax. Bibasilar
pulmonary
infiltrates are unchanged. Mediastinal structures are unchanged
as well. A
tracheostomy tube and right subclavian line are unchanged in
position.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient had ICP placed, opening pressure 37.  She was admitted
to TICU on neurosurgery service and closely monitored. She was
started on mannitol for ICP management which was transitioned to
hypertonic saline. Her Serum Osm and serum Na were checked every
six hours and saline was held for OSM>320 and Na>155. Upon
initial discussion and given her initial prognosis she was made
DNR. Her ICP's remained slightly elevated in the mid twenties
but her Serum Osm and Na were elevated making treatment
contraindicated. Her ICP's did resolve to normal values and a
head ct was obtained on [**1-16**]. Head CT was consistent with large
bifrontal hypodensity that was consistent with stroke or edema.
This was repeated on [**1-18**] and showed little change from
previous exam. Her ICP monitor was removed on [**1-18**] without
complication.
 In family discussion it was decided to move towards Trach/PEG
which was performed on [**2139-1-20**].  During tracheostomy procedure
pneumothorax occured and chest tube was placed.  She spiked
fever to 104 and sputum cultures grew gram negative rods and she
was begun on broad spectrum antibiotics.  There was concern for
possible infection and head CT with contrast was performed but
did not reveal infection.  However due to fever and drainage
from wound it was decided to bring her to the OR for craniectomy
and debridement on [**2139-1-21**]. She tolerated this procedure very
well with no complications and returned to the ICU post
operatively. Her chest tube was removed on [**1-23**] with no
complication. A chest x ray on [**1-24**] showed decrease size in her
pneumothorax, she had no difficulty with O2 saturations. She was
transferred to the floor and the step down unit on [**2139-1-24**].
Upon arrival to the floor she was seen by the physical therapy
team and it was decided she would benefit from long term rehab
placement. She remained afebrile while on the floor and her
antibiotics were discontinued after an 8 day course for hospital
aquired pneumonia and her whire blood cell count remained in
normal range and she was afebrile.  Her staples were removed
[**1-30**] and wound was well healed.
  She remained stable over the weekend of [**1-31**] and [**2-1**] and
was discharged to Rehab on [**2-2**].
