range. He otherwise remained asymptomatic. He underwent
scheduled hemodialysis. He was initially treated with Penicillin
VK and Fluconazole to cover both strep throat and possible
Candidal esophagitis ([**Female First Name (un) **] is questionable by records;
admission note reports white plaques, while all other notes,
including ENT consult note after performing detailed inspection,

Imaging:
Abdominal ultrasound ([**1-7**]): 1. Markedly shrunken and cirrhotic
liver with no focal liver lesions identified. 2. Massive ascites
3. Patent umbilical vein..
CXR ([**1-7**]): 1. Right middle lobe and right lower lobe opacities
could be due to atelectasis or aspiration. 2. Unchanged COPD.
CT chest ([**1-8**]): 1. Bilateral ground-glass opacities could
represent infection or hemorrhage. 2. Right middle lobe and
right upper lobe consolidations with element of atelectasis
might be due to aspiration. The right middle lobe and right
lower lobe atelectasis could be also secondary to high position
of the hemidiaphragm. 3. The distal lumen of the right internal
jugular line catheter terminates in IVC. 4. Severe ascites with
cirrhotic appearance of the liver. 5. Cholelithiasis with no
evidence of cholecystitis. 6. Left renal cortical cyst.


Brief Hospital Course:
59yo man with ESLD, ESRD on HD, known chronic low blood
pressure, chronic hepatitis C, COPD, paroxysmal SVT,
thrombocytopenia transferred from outside hospital with likely
bronchitis.
Bronchitis/PNA: Repeat CXR with evidence of RLL and RML
infiltrate. On levo/flagyl for ? aspiration PNA. D/c zithromax.

Patient initially admitted to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 10, howver he was transferred
to the MICU on HD 3 due to episode of ongoing SVT with HR to the
170's. He received adenosine x 4, diltiazem and Lopressor. EP
evaluated and felt this was an atrial tachycardia and he was
started on amiodarone drip. Also, on [**1-10**], his tunnelled
dialysis catheter
was replaced as the current line was felt to be too far into the
atrium, potentially causing atrial irritation.
On [**1-12**] the patient complained of abdominal pain, diffuse in
nature and an increase in absominal distention. Patient also had
5 episodes of bilious, non-bloody emesis. NGT placed. No BM x 5
days per patient report. CT scan was obtained which demonstrated
complete small bowel obstruction at the distal terminal ileum.
After 12 hours of conservative management, a follow-up CT scan
12 hours did not demonstrate progression of the contrast.
Patient taken to the OR for exploratory laparotomy, lysis of
adhesions and stricturoplasty. Drain left in place following
surgery with copius amounts of output. Replacement provided with
NS and 5% Albumin. Blood cultures drawn on day of surgery
yielded VRE. Patient had been started on Daptomycin on [**1-16**]. VAC
dressing in place.
Following the surgery, the patient remained hypotensive, treated
with pressors. Remained on Amiodarone for SVT control. Followed
by EP.
Patient continued with a right sided pleural effusion. A
bronchoscopy was performed on [**1-13**] with no evidence of
obstruction. Mucous plugging was reported.
As this was not responding a diagnostic and therapeutic
thoracentsesis was performed on [**1-21**]. A right-sided moderate
pleural effusion, most likely outside of thorax was reported
with 1900 cc of fluid returned. Tube was not left in secondary
to lack of further fluid remaining at the end of the procedure.
Cultures of this fluid were no growth.
Patient also followed by Renal. Due to continuing low BP's,
patient was dialyzed using CVVHD.
Patient received TPN while in ICU. Tube feeds were started,
however these were discontinued due to patient intolerance and
TPN remained in place via PICC line.
On [**1-26**] patient had AVNRT converted with Adenosine. Converted to
sinus with no recurrence. At this time, patient was on
Amiodarone 200 mg PO BID and low dose beta blocker IV.
In addition, on [**1-26**], the patient was presented at the Liver
Transplant meeting, and the decision was made at that time that
the patient would be placed on the inactive list due to the
current severity of his illness.
On [**1-28**], patient was complaining of worsening abdominal pain. CT
of abdomen obtained showing multiple dilated loops of small
bowel with air and gas and contrast seen in the colon, most
likely
