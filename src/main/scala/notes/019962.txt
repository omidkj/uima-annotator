History of Present Illness:
67 year old man with a history of metastatic pancreatic cancer
and hx of DVT diagnosed in [**Month (only) 958**] on Lovenox 1mg/kg [**Hospital1 **] who is
admitted following CT Torso today to assess for progression
pancreatic cancer that showed bilateral PEs with possible right
heart strain.  The patient was first diagnosed with bilateral
DVTs on [**3-19**], and was started on lovenox.  At time of
diagnosis, he did have right lower extremity tenderness.  Since
initiation of lovenox, the patient has taken it meticulously at
8am and 8pm daily and lower extremity pain has long resolved.
However, this Saturday morning (4 days PTA), he awoke with
intermittent sharp stabbing right sided chest pain
(non-pleuritic), associated with right-sided abdominal pain
radiating around his side.  Chest pain did not radiate.  Pain
was associated with dyspnea on exertion on climbing 1 flight of
stairs and occasional palpitatons.  No lightheadedness/dizziness
or syncope.  The patient was evaluated by his oncologist, who
increased his fentaynl patch for radiating abdominal pain, and
referred him for a CT torso with contrast to evaluate for
progression of disease.  CT showed multiple segmental pulmonary
emboli, and thrombus surrounding the tip of his porto-cath
extending into his low SVC.  The patient was referred to the
emergency department.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 99.8 123 170/79 18 100% on RA.  The
patient was started on a weight-based heparin drip with bolus.
He underwent lower extremity duplexes.  He was admitted to the
ICU for close monitoring given ongoing tachycardia.
.
On admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], VS 116 20 160/73 100%.  The patient
states that chest pain currently resolved.  He denies shortness
of breath at rest, calf tenderness, palpitations.  Abdominal
pain well controlled on fentanyl patch (due to be changed [**5-10**]).
No recent fevers, chills.  Appetite intact on megestrol.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI; recent history of constipation, improved on
increase in bowel regimen
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denies cough or wheezing. Denies chest pain, chest
pressure, palpitations. Denies abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark or

.
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
- [**10-17**] diagnosed with IPMN
- [**1-/2192**]: admitted to [**Hospital1 112**] with intense, crampy abdominal pain.
MRI showed a lesion in the uncinate head of the pancreas.
- [**2192-2-16**]: EUS done at [**Hospital1 18**] showed a 2.5 x 2.5 cm mass in the
uncinate process of the pancreas as well as several cysts.
Biopsy of the uncinate mass was suspicious for adenocarcinoma.
Biopsy of the mass in the tail continued to show mucinous fluid,
consistent with IPMN.
- [**2192-3-9**]: planned Whipple procedure; during the procedure he was
found to studding of the liver with at least 15 discrete nodules
in both lobes.  He also had 1 firm, hard, whitish nodule that
was in close proximity to the pancreatic head.   Liver and
pancreatic biopsies were taken and he was proven to have
adenocarcinoma in the liver. A port-a-cath was placed.
- [**2192-4-9**]: Gemcitabine 1000mg/m2 day 1
- [**Date range (1) 101157**]: admitted for jaundice, hyperbilirubinemia,
biliary obstruction.  ERCP was done with sphincterotomy and CBD
stent placed
- [**2192-4-16**]: Gemcitabine 1000mg/m2 day 8
- [**2192-4-23**]: day 15 Gemcitabine HELD due to dehydration
- [**2192-5-1**]: Gemcitabine given

Imaging:
CT chest/abd/pelvis with contrast:
1. Bilateral pulmonary emboli with occlusion of the right lower
lobe
pulmonary artery, new from [**2192-4-6**]. Eccentric thrombus in the
left lower
lobe pulmonary artery suggests that this portion may be
subacute, but it is still new from [**2192-4-6**]. There is no
definite evidence of right heart
strain. This finding was communicated to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4587**] by
phone at
1:50 p.m., [**2192-5-9**], upon discovery.

2. Heterogeneous opacity in the right lower lobe with extension
into the
right middle lobe may represent aspiration, infection or right
lower lobe
infarct.

3. Filling defect at the inferior tip of the Port-A-Cath within
the SVC may be due to thrombus at the tip, less likely due to
mixing of contrast.

4. Interval increase in size of numerous hepatic hypodensities,
consistent
with metastatic disease. The pancreatic head adenocarcinoma is
similar to
[**2192-4-6**]. Adjacent peripancreatic nodes are unchanged. A
hypodense lesion in the pancreatic tail is likely a side branch
IPMN, which is slightly larger, possibly due to progressive
ductal obstruction.

5. Fat stranding in the right upper quadrant omentum may
represent
post-surgical or post-radiation change, but omental metastasis
is not
excluded. The finding is similar in appearance to [**2192-4-6**].

6. Common bile duct stent with air in the gallbladder and
pneumobilia,
attesting the stent patency.
.
LENIS: 1. Partially occlusive thrombus in the mid superficial
femoral vein on the left.
2. Apparent resolution of the remainder of the venous
thromboembolisms from the [**3-19**] study.
.
ECHO:  The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is a 1.6 x 1.7
round, mildly mobile echogenic mass in the right atrium, likely
representing the extension of a known catheter-associated
thrombus. An independent pathology, such as myxoma or other
tumor cannot be entirely excluded. No atrial septal defect or
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast with maneuvers. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic
