Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1561**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath , cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
R Chest tube placement
R VATS, decortication, biopsy of cavitary lesion

History of Present Illness:
84 yo M from [**Hospital3 **] w/ MMP incl COPD, Macronodular
pulmonary amyloidosis, CAD, HTN, AAA, HTN presenting with
several days cough and dyspnea, including increasing difficulty
with activities of daily living. He also has some dyspnea at
rest. he has a cough that started ~10 days PTA, productive of
greenish-brown sputum, no hemoptysis. He has had no fevers. He
denies chest pain or abdominal pain.
.
He is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 21848**] for his pulmonary amyloidosis
and COPD. He was seen in pulmonary clinic 2 days PTA for
evaluation of these symptoms. A CXR showed increased
nodularities and pathcy infiltrate. A CT of the chest was done
which showed significant increase in size and number of
pulmonary nodules with new cavitation, as well as loculated
pleural effusion. The patient was started on augmentin.
Consideration was for semi-urgent VATS. On the morning of
admission, the patient "looked bad" to his daughter, and his
vitals were noted to be 80/50, HR 120, RR 32, O2 88RA. At this
time, the patient was transferred urgently by ambulance to
[**Hospital3 **].
.
At [**Hospital1 392**], noted to be afebrile with BP 94/48 and satting 90% on
RA. Notable lab results were a WBC of 31.4, Cr of 4.3 and a K of
6.5. The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for continuity of
care.
.
In the ED, the patient was afebrile. His blood pressures were in
the 80s-90s systolic, with a nadir of 68/45. Other VS include RR
18-22, Hr 80s-90s, Sat 94-96% 6L FM. His lactate was 2.5. He was
pan cultured and started on Vanco, ceftriaxone and flagyl. A CT
abdomen/pelvis was done to r/o leaking AAA as cause of his
hypotension, and a bedside FAST exam was negative. A CXR showed
loculated pleural effusion. Dr. [**Name (NI) **] placed a 28Fr CT
in R chest wall with return of pus. The patient was then
transferred to the MICU for further care. He recieved a total of
2350 IVF, and Had 800 UOP + 60cc from the CT.


Past Medical History:
1. COPD followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 217**]. His FVC is 3.27 or
75% of predicted, FEV1 is 0.8 which is 30% of predicted, and his

FEV1-FVC is 24% which is 39% predicted.
2. Coronary artery disease with one vessel disease of the right

coronary with collaterals, status post catheterization in
[**2195-8-4**].
3. Hypertension.
4. Hypercholesterolemia.
5. Bilateral renal artery stenosis.
6. Abdominal aortic aneurysm status post repair with
aortobi-iliac bypass graft [**2195-8-26**], complicated by
trilobar pneumonia, high-grade four out of four bottles
Staphylococcus bacteremia, enterococcus urinary tract infection

associated with the bacteremia.
7. Peripheral [**Year (4 digits) 1106**] disease, status post
bilateral stents and bypasses.
8. Atrial fibrillation/flutter status post ablation.
9. Macronodular pulmonary amyloidosis diagnosed with biopsy in
[**2193-4-4**].
10. Positive lupus anticoagulant.
11. Anterior neck mass, questionable etiology.
12. Hx Clostridium difficile.
13. s/p bronchoscopy in [**2195-1-4**], complicated by right
pneumothorax.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Status post abdominal aortic aneurysm
repair in [**2195-8-4**], status post bilateral femoral-tibial
bypass in [**2184**] and [**2185**].

Pertinent Results:
STUDIES.
[**7-12**] CXR - 1. Loculated right pleural effusion with lucencies
within it consistent with air. 2. Nodular and parenchymal
opacities predominantly in the right middle and right lower lung
zones seen on the prior CT examination of [**2198-7-10**]. The
differential diagnosis again includes infectious process,
unusual manifestation of the patient's known pulmonary
amyloidosis, Wegner's disease, and malignancy cannot be
excluded.
.
[**7-12**] ABD/PELVIS CT - 1. No evidence of increase in the size of
the abdominal aortic aneurysm. No evidence of aneurysmal leak.
2. Extensive consolidative opacity in the right lung base,
primarily
appearing pleural, which has increased in size over the past two
days, and contains small cystic spaces. This is most concerning
for an infection. Clinically correlate.
.
[**7-10**] CHEST CT - Significant interval increase in size and
development of new nodules, several of which are now cavitary.
The overall appearance is most worrisome for a superimposed
infectious process, possibly septic, particularly given pleural
reaction, loculated pleural fluid and adjacent opacities in the
right lower lobe. This appearance may also be unusual
manifestation of the patient's known pulmonary amyloidosis. The
differential diagnosis radiographically would also include
Wegner's or other [**Month/Day (4) 1106**] disease, rheumatoid or low-grade
lymphoma. Lung cancer would also be included in differential.
.
ECHO [**2197-2-16**]
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%).
3. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild aortic
regurgitation is seen.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen.
5. Compared with the findings of the prior report (tape
unavailable for review) of [**2195-12-21**], there has been no
significant change.
.
CT abd/pelvis [**7-12**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of increase in the size of the abdominal aortic
aneurysm. No evidence of aneurysmal leak.
2. Extensive consolidative opacity in the right lung base,
primarily appearing pleural, which has increased in size over
the past two days, and contains small cystic spaces. This is
most concerning for an infection. Clinically correlate.
3. Likely cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
4. Simple-appearing cysts in the right kidney.
.
CT chest [**7-14**]:
IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of multiple cavity nodules in
both lungs likely  representing an infectious process, possibly
septic.  The differentials include [**Doctor Last Name **], rheumatoid or
low-grade lymphoma.  Lung cancer should also be included in the
differential.  Interval increase in the size of right-sided
pleural effusion status post chest tube placement.  This
effusion now has multiple air bubbles, which could be secondary
to the chest tube placement. However, a secondary superimposed
infection cannot be excluded.


Brief Hospital Course:
84 yo M w/ MMP incl. COPD, Macronodular pulmonary amyloidosis,
others transferred from OSH w/ dyspnea, low sats, hypotension;
rescently found to have worsening pulmonary infiltrates/pleural
effusions.
.
#Resp Distress - likely due to baseline COPD/amyloidosis with
superimposed acute infection, loculated effusion with pus
drainage at time of chest tube placement.
After drainage remained stable from respiratory standpoint,
oxygenative well on RA.  Chest tube without any evidence of air
leak, approximately 100cc output, trailing off on second day.
- Pleural fluid s/w exudate, cx pending, no orgs on GS
- Cont Vanco/Zosyn empirically.
- To OR for decortication once renal function and coagulopathy
improved. (see below)
.
#Hypotension - Pt w/ hx hypertension. No AAA on abd CT, neg
FAST.  Resolved with IVF by the second hospital day, lactate
trended down
.
#Coagulopathy - on coumadin for hx Aflutte
