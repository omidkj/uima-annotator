none directly prior to admission.  The patient was also on
hemodialysis three times a week.  The patient denies fevers
or chills, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, shortness of breath.

5.  Esophageal varices, although no bleeds.
6.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
7.  Peripheral neuropathy.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was in no acute distress.
Alert and oriented times three.  Neck was supple.  No JVD.
Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmur.  Clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended.
Positive bowel sounds.  Extremities no lower extremity edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the Operating Room
on [**2125-8-16**].  Attending surgeon Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], assistant Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  For complete account please see
operative reported dated [**2125-8-16**] for both orthotopic liver
transplant and cadaveric kidney transplant.  Postoperatively,
the patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit per
protocol.  Intensive Care Unit course was unremarkable.  The
patient was transferred to the floor on postoperative day
number eight.  Delay in transfer was only due to bed
availability issues.  Upon transfer to the floor the patient
had a creatinine of 2.2, ALT 105, AST 32, alkaline
phosphatase 104 and total bilirubin 2.3.  On postoperative
day number ten the patient's immunosuppression regimen went
as follows, Cyclosporin 100 mg b.i.d., Prednisone 20 mg q
day, CellCept [**Pager number **] mg b.i.d.  Cyclosporin levels were being
adjusted daily per level.  On postoperative day number 11 the
patient's JP output picked up to 180 cc and JP output
creatinine was noted to be 15.5.  The patient was examined by
CT to evaluate for possible leak.  CT scan was normal.
Ultrasound, however, approximately 7 by 2 by 2 cm fluid
collection superomedial to the transplanted kidney.
Treatment at that time was decided to be leave the JP drain
in until output was minimal as well as the Foley.
Contributing to this treatment plan was the fact that the
patient suffers from benign prostatic hypertrophy.

On postoperative day number 13 the patient began to get
increasingly agitated and began to have mental status
changes.  A sitter was written for in order to watch the
patient.  Psychiatric consult was also obtained recommending
Haldol to treat the patient's agitation.  By postoperative
day number 15 the patient became increasing agitated,
actively hallucinating and frankly delirious and psychotic.
The patient requiring 4 point leather restraints at times.
Haldol seemed to have no effect.  Later on postoperative day
fifteen the patient began to have respiratory difficulties
and the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit
and was intubated and sedated.  The patient remained
intubated in the Intensive Care Unit for a day and a half at
which time CT scan revealed a right lower lobe consolidation.
The patient received bronchoscopy to reopen atelectally
collapsed right lower lobe.  Cultures from that consolidation
had been negative to date.  The patient was placed on Zosyn
for a ten day course for empiric treatment of pneumonia.  The
patient was then taken off Cyclosporin for a presumptive
Cyclosporin induced psychosis and delirium.  After extubation
the patient quickly returned to baseline mental status.  He
remembered vividly his episodes of confusion.  The patient
was started on Prograf and got to a therapeutic level of 10.


On postoperative day number 20 the patient was found to have
on ultrasound duplex of the central veins a nonocclusive
thrombus on the right IJ.  On [**2125-9-5**] the patient went back
to the Operating Room for ligation of right arm AV fistula
prior to which the patient had marked right upper extremity
edema.  Postoperative day number 21 from the liver kidney
transplant the patient returned to the floor doing well.  The
patient's staples were removed and Steri-Strips were applied.
Postoperative day number 22 status post kidney liver
transplant and on Zosyn day eight for right lower lobe
pneumonia the patient remained afebrile, vital signs were
stable.  JP drain was discontinued for minimal output.
Creatinine was 1.1, AST 20, ALT 27, alkaline phosphatase 82,
total bilirubin 0.7.  The patient's mental status was at
baseline.  The patient was therapeutic on Prograf 2 mg b.i.d.
dose being adjusted daily for levels.  Also postoperative day
number 22 hepatitis C viral load continued to be negative.
The patient's wound was clean, dry and intact and preliminary
read of an ultrasound of the transplanted kidney revealed no
detectable fluid collection.  The patient's Foley still in
place.  The Foley is to remain in place for one to two weeks.
The patient at this time was deemed well enough and go be
discharged to a rehabilitation center and then to home
thereafter with close follow up with the transplant center.
