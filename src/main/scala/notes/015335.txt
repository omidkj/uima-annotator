CT HEAD
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images of the head were obtained
without IV
contrast; several sections were degraded by patient motion
artifact, and
were repeated.

FINDINGS: There is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, edema,
mass effect, shift of normally midline structures, or acute
major vascular territorial infarction. The ventricles and sulci
are mildly prominent, likely reflecting atrophy. Visualized
paranasal sinuses revealed mucosal thickening of the right
maxillary sinus. Noted are burr holes in the left parietal and
frontal bones, as before.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

CXR
PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST, ONE VIEW: The heart is normal in size.
Atherosclerotic calcifications of the aorta are present.
Otherwise, cardiomediastinal and
hilar contours are unremarkable. Lung volumes are low. Lungs are
clear
without consolidation or pulmonary edema. There is no pleural
effusion.
Osseous structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7168**] is a 52 yo male with alcohol abuse, here for
alcohol.benzo withdrawal within three hours of being discharged
AMA from MICU.  He was found in his apartment building running
in the halls naked, intoxicated, and covered in feces. He was
brought in by the police.
.
1. Alcohol withdrawal. The patient presented in alcohol/benzo
withdrawal.  He was started on folate, thiamine and a
multivitamin.  He was given diazepam per hourly CIWA.  He
required a 1:1 sitter and restraints for safety. However,
following large amounts of benzos (>200 mg of Valium) the
patient remained agitated, tachycardic, and delerious.  At that
point, we became concerned that the patient may have developed
benzo intoxication.  Psychiartry was consulted.  He was started
on PRN haldol for agitation and benzos were discontinued on
[**10-1**]. The patient remained acutely agitated and assaulted staff
on numerous occasions. He required a security sitter and was
placed in seclusion. Psychiatry suggested that his acute
agitation could possibly be secondary to keppra, for which there
are case reports citing aggressive behavior in the setting of
keppra for seizure prophylaxis. However, his delerium and acute
agitation could have also resulted secondary to benzo
withdrawal, of note his urine was positive for benzodiazapine
several days after stopping these medications. With neurology
consultation, his keppra was tapered off and he was started on
neurontin. His delerium slowly resolved over the course of his
stay. The haldol was tapered off while in house.
.
2. CAD: through history, the patient was intially thought to
have a history of an MI, however, medical records obtained
showed normal LV and RV function on echo. A previous excercise
test in [**2120**] showed no evidence of flow limiting CAD. Noted were
frequent PVCs. He was continued on his BB, HCTZ and an aspirin.
.
3. hypertension: continued on home dose of hctz and metoprolol
was added.
.
4. Agitation/Psych.  The patient was initially continued on his
home psychiatric medication regimen- buspar, trazodone, remeron.
However, with psychiatric consultation his regimen was
simplified. He required haldol and zyprexa for agitation;
psychiatry followed and assisted with his medication
adjustments. The haldol was tapered off while in the hospital.
.
5. chronic back pain: Mr. [**Known lastname 7168**] required prn doses of oxycodone
for his radicular back pain. He has a history of SDH and was
told not to take aspirin.
.
6. Insomnia: trazadone prn
