Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2187-7-15**] Aortic Valve Replacement(32mm CE tissue), Coronary
Artery Bypass Graft x 2 (SVG to LAD, SVG to OM), Aortic
Endarterectomy

History of Present Illness:
This 81 year old patient with severe aortic stenosis and CAD has
been experiencing daily episodes of chest pain for the last 10
days. His symptoms occur with activity such as taking a shower,
doing yard work or after he eats dinner. He has some associated
shortness of breath. The patient has a history of a cardiac
catheterization done at [**Hospital1 2025**] in [**2176**] due to unstable angina which
revealed a right dominant system with an 80% discrete OM1 artery
and a discrete 50% RCA lesion. EF 65%. An aortoiliac angiogram
was also done which revealed marked tortuosity, right greater
than left and a mild fusiform aneurismal dilation of the distal
aorta. (Of note, there is no indication on the cath report that
any coronary intervention was done).

Past Medical History:
Coronary Artery Disease, Hypertension, Hypercholesterolemia,
Rheumatic Fever (as child), RBBB, Gastroesophageal Reflux
Disease, Chronic Renal Insufficiency, s/p TURP, s/p Carpal
tunnel release bilaterally, s/p Benign tumor removed from chest
wall removed 50 years ago

Social History:
Quit smoking 1 month ago/previously smoked 1 pack per week/40+
yr smoking history. Married, lives at home with his wife.
Alcohol- 1-2 drinks per day. Retired.

Family History:
Father died at age 74 from heart disease. Mother died from
[**Name (NI) **]??????s lymphoma. One brother died at age 9 from congenital
heart disease

Pulses: DP dopplerable b/l

Pertinent Results:
[**7-13**] Cardiac Cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography revealed 2
vessel disease within the left coronary arterial anatomy and
presumed RCA disease. The LAD had 70% proximal stenosis.  The
LCX had a proximal long segment of 80% stenosis. The OM1 had a
proximal long segment of 80% stenosis. The RCA was not
selectively cannulated, but presumed likely to be totally
occluded as left to right collaterals were visulalized. 2.
Limited  resting hemodynamic assessment revealed elevated
systemic arterial pressure with an aortic pressure of 157/76.
The aortic valve
was evaluated with careful pullback from LV to aorta as well as
simultaneous measurement of LV pressure and femoral artery
pressure. The mean gradient was 28.12 mm Hg, consistent with a
calculated aortic valve area of 1.02 cm2.  The PCWP was normal
at 12 mm Hg.  The cardiac index was below normal at 2.36.
[**7-15**] Echo: Prebypas: Very limited TEE examination as unable to
advance TEE probe beyond 35 cms. Very poor image quality. Dr
[**Last Name (STitle) **] informed re very limited TEE exam. 1. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. 2.Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %). No trans gastric
images obtained. Very poor quantification of ejection fraction.
3.The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
4. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. 5. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of
the results on [**2187-7-15**] at 1500 hours. Post Bypass: 1. Very
limited views. Unable to comment on post bypass findings.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 66958**] was electively admitted for a cardiac cath. Cath
revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease and
moderate to severe aortic stenosis. Please see report for
details. Cardiac surgery was consulted and he underwent usual
pre-operative work-up. On [**7-15**] he was brought to the operating
room where he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x 2 and
aortic valve replacement. Please see operative report for
details. Mr. [**Known lastname 66958**] was transferred to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring in stable condition. In initial post-op course he
required multiple Inotropes for hypotension, along with multiple
blood transfusions and Amiodarone for Atrial Fibrillation. He
required aggressive diuresis and DCCV x 2 on post-op day two for
AF. Also on this day bilateral chest tubes were placed d/t
pleural effusion. Renal service was consulted d/t renal failure.
On post-op day five Heparin was started d/t continued episodes
of Atrial Fibrillation. His Inotropes were slowly weaned off
over time. Mr. [**Known lastname 66958**] required prolonged intubation d/t
difficulty with oxygenation. He was eventually weaned from
sedation and was extubated on post-op day nine. Chest tubes were
eventually removed. Vancomycin had to be restarted d/t
bacteremia.  The patient was transfered to the floor on POD 12
where he continued to progress.  By the time of discharge on POD
15, the pt was ambulating with assistance, the sternal wound was
healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  He was
discharged in good condition to [**Hospital3 **].
