Admission Date:  [**2183-10-18**]     Discharge Date:  [**2183-10-25**]

Date of Birth:   [**2110-5-31**]     Sex:  M

Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73-year-old
gentleman with a past medical history significant for chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (with recent exacerbation),
chronic atrial fibrillation, and the onset of lower extremity
weakness over the past several weeks.  The patient was
transferred from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital with methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas in his sputum, and
questionable new cerebrovascular accident.

Per the patient's daughter, the patient has a long history of
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and is on home
nebulizers but not oxygen.  On [**2183-8-15**], the patient
became acutely short of breath and was admitted to [**Hospital 1562**]
Hospital with a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
exacerbation.  His sputum grew methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus, and the patient was treated with
antibiotics.  The patient subsequently improved and was
discharged to a rehabilitation facility.  Per the patient's
daughter, he was doing well.  He was mentally alert and was
ambulating without difficulty at the facility.

On [**2183-10-11**], the patient developed severe worsening
of back pain he had been having since [**2183-5-18**] in
addition to lower extremity weakness with the right being
greater than the left.  The patient's daughter reports he was
unable to stand without pushing himself up from a chair.

In the early morning of [**2183-10-12**], the patient was
readmitted to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital with a fever.  Significantly,
he had previously had methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus cultured from a wound in his sacral area and
peripherally inserted central catheter line.  The
peripherally inserted central catheter line was subsequently
removed on [**Month (only) 359**] ? 16, [**2182**].

In the Emergency Department at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital, the
patient's blood pressure was 80/50, his temperature was 99
degrees Fahrenheit, and his heart rate was 106.  His white
blood cell count was 17.7.  The patient received fluids,
ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and hydrocortisone.  He was then
admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit at the outside
hospital for further care.  The patient was stabilized
hemodynamically.  He received vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and
Azactam.  Per the patient's daughter, his speech became very
garbled on hospital day one, and he was suddenly unable to
swallow.  The patient continued to have worsening weakness
(right greater than left) and developed right upper extremity
weakness.

On [**2183-10-13**], the patient had a computed tomography of
the head showing subacute versus chronic lacunar infarction
and right parietal arachnoideus.  On [**2183-10-14**], a
magnetic resonance imaging showed an acute left brain stem
and lower cerebellar infarction.  A magnetic resonance
imaging of the spine showed increased activity in the lumbar
spine with L1 and L2 compression fractures and L4 compression
fracture versus metastases.  Throughout this time, the
patient continued to have positive blood cultures and sputum
cultures.  On [**2183-10-15**], the patient became unable to
handle his secretions, requiring intubation.  He underwent a
bronchoscopy at that time and was found to have copious
yellow-brown sputum, mainly from his right bronchus
intermedius and right middle lobe.  Bronchial washings showed
rare epithelial cells, and many neutrophils, and many
gram-positive cocci, moderate gram-negative rods, and
frequency gram-positive rods.  No fungi were seen on smear.

Per family wishes, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further neurologic and oncologic
workup.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed the patient's temperature was 102.5
degrees Fahrenheit, his blood pressure was 147/37, his heart
rate was 100, synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation
650/37/0.4/5.  In general, the patient was not sedated but he
was lethargic.  The patient blinked appropriately and
responded to questions.  The patient followed simple
commands.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination
revealed the patient was intubated.  No cervical
lymphadenopathy.  Cardiovascular examination revealed
hyperdynamic.  Normal first heart sounds and second heart
sounds.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  A regular rate and
rhythm.  Pulmonary examination revealed coarse breath sounds
anterolaterally with diffuse rhonchi.  There was diminished
air movement bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft, nontender,
and nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.  Extremity
examination revealed no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  No
peripheral signs of endocarditis.  Rectal examination
revealed complete lack of rectal tone.  The prostate was
enlarged and boggy.  No nodules palpated.  Neurologic
examination revealed the patient followed simple commands.
The patient squeezed left hand but was unable to do so on the
right.  The patient wiggled his toes bilaterally.  Deep
tendon reflexes were 1+ and symmetric.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories
on admission revealed the patient's white blood cell count
was 25.5, his hematocrit was 29.5, and his platelets were
317.  Differential revealed 76 neutrophils, 0 bands, 15
lymphocytes, 5 monocytes, 0 eosinophils, 0 basophils, and 1
atypical cell, and 2 metamyelocytes, and 0 myelocytes.  The
patient's prothrombin time was 13.4, his partial
thromboplastin time was 37.8, and his INR was 1.2.
Chemistries revealed his sodium was 137, potassium was 4.3,
bicarbonate was 34, blood urea nitrogen was 50, creatinine
was 0.8, and blood glucose was 124.  His
alanine-aminotransferase was 149, his aspartate
aminotransferase was 107, his lactate dehydrogenase was 396,
his alkaline phosphatase was 162, his amylase was 164, his
total bilirubin was 0.8, and his lipase was 18.  His albumin
was 2.7.  His calcium was 9, his magnesium was 2.1, and his
phosphorous was 3.3.  His lactate was 1.3.  Free calcium was
1.18.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray on admission
revealed bilateral patchy infiltrates with loss of right
costophrenic angle and loss of left heart border.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  Following admission, the
patient had methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
bacteremia with multiple sources of infection.

(a)  Bacteremia:  The patient was continued on vancomycin
throughout his admission.  He also completed five days of
gentamicin for Synergy.  The patient consistently had
positive blood cultures on admission; however, on [**2183-10-24**], he had pending negative cultures from [**2183-10-22**].
However, on [**2183-10-24**], his white blood cell count was
increasing.  Surveillance cultures were continued.

(b)  Aortic valve endocarditis:  The patient had a small
vegetation on his aortic valve.   He was evaluated by
Cardiothoracic Surgery on [**2183-10-23**].  The patient was
not a surgical candidate at that time since he had no
abscess.  The patient did have mitral regurgitation which was
considered most likely due to coronary artery disease and/or
left ventricular dysfunction.

Given the patient's multiple surgical risk factors,
Cardiothoracic Surgery did not feel he was a candidate for
valve replacement surgery at this
