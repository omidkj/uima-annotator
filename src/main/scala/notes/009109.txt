Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known firstname 7232**] [**Known lastname 106665**] is a 74F who is s/p kidney living related renal
transplant [**9-29**] complicated by incisional hernia who was
admitted to the hospital for elective repair of her hernia on
[**2187-7-5**]. The surgery was performed without complications and the
patient had adequate repair of her hernia defect with placement
of kerlex mesh.  On POD#2 the patient developed oliguria, and
the Renal Transplant team was consulted. Pt had a Creatinine
bump up to 2.4 (her baseline is 1.9), and after eval it was
determined that she had [**Last Name (un) **] from an undetermined source. Patient
was initally given fluid boluses and IVF without increase her in
her urine output. A renal U/S was performed on [**7-7**] and did not
demonstrate hydrenoephrosis, stones, or mass of the transplanted
kidney, althought it was significant for absence of diastolic
flow in the main renal and intrarenal arteries. After this
initial evaluation patients urine output remained somewhat
marginal, while her Cr started to improve. On hospital day 4,
patient was transufesed 2units of PRBC for a Crit of 22, and
soon after developed respiratory distress requiring intubation
and transfer to the SICU on [**7-9**]. Her post transfusion Hct was
30, and her urine output improved while in the ICU s/p
transfusion. Pt was also started on lasix PRN with adequate
improvement in urine output of 1.1L on [**7-10**], and consistent
diuresis. Her pulmonary status improved on that day and she was
extubated. A speech and swallow evaluation was performed, and
the patient was started on a thin liquid, soft mechanical diet.
Pt was deemed stable for transfer to the floor on [**7-11**]. While on
on the floor she continued to remain hemodynamically stable,
with adequate urine output, and was restarted on her home dose
of lasix. She was weaned off her oxygen requirement (pt is not
on oxygen at home). Throughout her hospital course she received
adequate immunosuppresion with Tacroliums and Azathioprine.
Tacrolimus levels were checked daily, and dose adjustments were
made accordingly (last tacro levels range 9.3-10.3). Patient was
placed on all home medications, including her medications for
HTN, COPD. On [**7-13**] she was evaluated by speech therapy again and
progressed to thin liquid/regular solid diet. She remained
hemodynamically stable, eating well, and producing adequate
urine with Cr at her baseline 1.8. She was evaluated by PT and
was cleared to be discharged home with her daughter.
