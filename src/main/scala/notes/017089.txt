RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2187-2-25**] 9:40 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: evaluate for effusion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
[**Age over 90 **] year old woman with s/p avr
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate for effusion
CLINICAL HISTORY: Status post AVR.

CHEST: Compared to the prior chest x-ray of [**2-23**] cardiac
failure is still present. The distribution of the fluid is
changed somewhat with increase in size of the left effusion and
decrease in size of the right effusion and also in the areas of
interstitial failure but the degree of failure probably is
unchanged.

IMPRESSION: No change in degree of failure.

Left Atrium - Four Chamber Length:  *5.9 cm  <= 5.2 cm

Findings
bilateral pleural effusions.
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2187-1-29**].
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall normal LVEF
(>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV not well seen. Moderately dilated RV cavity.
Paradoxic septal motion consistent with prior cardiac surgery.

AORTIC VALVE: Bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis (AVR). AVR
well seated, normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular
gradients. Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Well-seated mitral annular ring with normal
gradient. Moderate mitral annular calcification. Physiologic MR
(within normal limits).

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR. Mild PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: No PS. Physiologic (normal) PR.


PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation.
patient. Echocardiographic results were reviewed with the
houseofficer caring for the patient. Bilateral pleural
effusions.
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic
valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc
motion and transvalvular gradients. Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral annular ring appears well seated and is not
obstructing flow. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen
(within normal limits). There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2187-1-29**],
the overall left ventricular function is similar. A
bioprosthetic valve is in the aortic position and functioning
well. The mitral annular ring is also well seated and
functioning well. The severity of tricuspid regurgitation has
decreased.

Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to cardiac surgery for preoperative workup. Her
ocumadin was held and she was started on heparin. She was
started on levofloxacin for pneumonia on CXR. She required 5
dental extractions which were done on [**1-28**]. POstoperatively she
complained of chest pain and was transferred to the CCU. Sh
