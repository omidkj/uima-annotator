Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**]
Chief Complaint:
Poor balance and nausea with vomiting.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 87 year-old right-handed female, with history of
Afib on Coumadin, hypertension, and hypothyroidism who had 2
weeks of worsening balance and fatigue who was unable to get up
from the toilet 6:30am ont he morniing of admission.  She called
out for help and her daughter who lives with her came into
assist her.  She found the patient to be leaning to her right
and assisted her to the living room.  She was able to eat
breakfast but soon felt nauseated and when she returned to the
bathroom, she vomitted several times.  She was even weaker than
before, leaning on her daughter more hence EMS was called.  No
reported trauma or complains of headache. Patient was brought by
EMS to [**Hospital3 **] where she was noted to be in afib. Her
head CT revealed a left cerebellar hemorrhage.

Initial INR was 3.1. She was started on FFP, given VitK 2mg
prior to her transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.

Neurologic:
Mental Status: Arouses to voice and can respond verbally.
Oriented to TPP,  unable to relate history. Decreased attention
span but redirectable. Language is fluent with intact
comprehension.  There were no paraphasic errors.  Able to read
without difficulty.  Speech was slightly dysarthric. Able to
follow both midline and appendicular commands. There was no
evidence of apraxia or neglect.

Cranial Nerves: Olfaction not tested.  Anisocoria - s/p cataract
surgery bilaterally, right pupil reactive (4 to 3 mm), left
pupil reactive (1 1/2 mm to 1 mm).  Left eye ptosis, EOMI
without nystagmus. Normal saccades. Facial
sensation intact to LT. No facial droop, facial musculature
symmetric. Hearing intact grossly bilaterally. Tongue protrudes
in midline.

Motor: Normal bulk, tone throughout. Formal strength testing
limited due to level of alertness and cooperation. Spontaneous
movement of all extremities agaist gravity and some resistance,
symmetrical and bilateral, UE & LE.

Sensory: No deficits to light touch, 2 pt and cold sensation.

Coordination: unable to asses due to limited cooperation
alertness.

Reflex: No clonus

Neurological Examination prior to discharge
Mental Status: Alert to time, place and person. However, does
not remember the year.
Cranial nerves: intact
Motor: No pronator drift, full strength of the arms,
questionable weakness in the bilateral IPs. She had intention
tremor of the left greater than right with FNF testing. Needs
the assistance of one person to stand. PT has walked her with a
walker.

Pertinent Results:
CT Scan on [**2130-10-19**]: There is a 2.3 x 2.1 cm area of increased
attenuation within the left lobe of the cerebellum with some
central hypoattenuation. There is mild surrounding edema. There
is mild mass effect, although the fourth ventricle is patent
without more proximal hydrocephalus. There is cerebral atrophy
and small vessel ischemic change. Included paranasal sinuses and
mastoid air cells are clear. There are no fractures.

MRI/A on [**2130-10-20**]: Left cerebellar hemorrhage measuring 2.1 X 2.4
cm,
associated with mild mass effect on the fourth ventricle. Areas
of chronic
microvascular ischemic changes. There is no evidence of acute
ischemic event. Prominence of the sulci and ventricles, likely
age related and involutional in nature.

There is evidence of vascular flow in both internal carotids as
well as the vertebrobasilar system. The vessels demonstrate
segmental areas of narrowing, more evident on the left M1
segment and diffuse narrowing in both medial cerebral arteries,
also the basilar artery demonstrate minimal
segmental narrowing likely consistent with diffuse
atherosclerotic disease.

MRA with Contrast [**2130-10-22**]:  Unchanged appearance of left
cerebellar hemorrhage with surrounding edema and mild mass
effect. No new hemorrhage, ischemia, or hydrocephalus. Following
administration of gadolinium contrast, there is no evidence for
abnormal enhancement.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 87yo RHW with hx of Afib on Coumadin, HTN,
hypothyroidism and hx of breast cancer s/p L mastectomy here
with 2 weeks of being "off-balance, leaning more to right" and
being acutely more unbalanced and weak with nausea and vomitting
on the morning of admission who was found to have 2.1 X 2.4 cm L
cerebellar hemorrhage more likely secondary to HTN and
anticoagulation. She was supra-therapeutic since INR on
admission was 3.1.

She was initially admitted under neurosurgery service given the
significant cerebellar hemorrhage. Although there was some
effecement of the 4th ventricle, there were no signs of
increased signs of ICP.  She was then switched to neurology
service and remained well without HA, nausea/vomitting or visual
disturbance.

MRI and MRA without contrast were performed. There were no signs
of ischemic infarct or AVM/aneurysms. Then MRI brain was
repeated WITH contrast on [**10-22**]. There was enhancement of the
border of the left cerebellar hemorrhage but this was thought to
be consistent with hemorrhage. The enhancement pattern was not
suggestive of a neoplasm. There was less effacement of the 4th
ventricle.

She was restarted on ASA 81mg daily on [**10-27**] for cardiac stent
and stroke prevention.  The issue of restarting coumadin was
discussed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3075**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 17976**] ([**Hospital1 756**]),
her cardiologist, the patient, and her daughters. Based on the
risk of recurrent hemorrhage with resumption of Coumadin and the
patient's preference, coumadin was not restarted.

Patient will have a repeat MRI brain with contrast in [**3-28**] weeks
to re-evaluate whether there could be a neoplasm underlying the
cerebellar bleed.
