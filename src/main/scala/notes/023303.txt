Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8850**]
Chief Complaint:
Mental status changes and confusion.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Microsurgical navigation guided resection of left frontal tumor.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 75-year-old right-handed man with CAD, CHF, h/o
stroke, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and metastatic NSCLC
cancer, s/p Cyberknife on [**2148-3-14**] to brain metastases who
presents with progressive confusion over the past month.
Patient is unable to provide any details of the events
precipitating this admission; thus, history was obtained from
his son [**Name (NI) 12041**] [**Name (NI) **]. He has had waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] confusion for
the past two weeks. His son states that he "seems to have lost
his logic and common sense." He recognizes his family but has
exhibited much confusion with performance of his ADL's.  Son
reports that he has only been putting on his left shoe and
walking around the house with only one shoe on. Similarly he has
had difficulty with putting on only one side of his pants. He
has not been performing self-hygiene and has not been taking
medications. Family has noticed changes in his balance, and
patient reports that he has fallen twice in the past week.  His
son recently noticed scratches on his arms and legs, but a fall
was never witnessed.  He frequently complains of fatigue and has
been sleeping more than usual.  Patient has not reported any
dizziness. He has had one episode of urinary incontinence
approximately one month ago, but otherwise has been using the
bathroom unassisted.  He has not had any observed seizure-like
activity or fecal incontinence.

In the ED, vital signs were 97.6 F, heart rate 105, blood
pressure 148/89, respiratory rate 18, and oxygen saturation was
96% on room air.  He received Decadron 10 mg PO x 1.  CT head
was performed and he was evaluated by Neurology consult.  He was
admitted for further work-up to the Oncology Medicine service.

Past Medical History:
1) NSCLC w/brain metastases (see below)
1) CAD - s/p inferior STEMI [**11-15**], stent to left circumflex
2) CHF(EF 55% on [**4-16**])
3) HTN
4) Paroxysmal afib
5) CVA
6) Left LE DVT on coumadin
7) s/p prostatectomy
8) s/p IVC  filter

ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: He was in his usual state of health until
[**2145**] when he was experiencing a persistent cough.  In [**Month (only) **]
[**2146**], he suffered from a myocardial infarction with congestive
heart failure and inferior lead ST elevation.  His chest X-ray
showed a right upper lobe mass.  A biopsy showed adenosquamous
carcinoma.  He was staged at IIIA. He later had carboplatin and
taxol, together with chest irradiation.  After neoadjuvant
chemo-irradiation, he underwent a right upper lobectomy. He had
staging head MRI in [**2147-10-13**] that reveals a left medial
frontal brain metastasis.  That has increased in size over time.
 He then received Cyberknife radiosurgery in late [**2148-2-12**].
Last seen in [**5-18**] with some increase in edema on CT head, felt
to be related to weaning his dexamethasone.

Social History:
Originally from [**Country 651**], cantonese speaking.  Retired.  Worked a
variety of jobs, including in restaurants.  Lives with wife and
one of his sons.  [**Name (NI) **] three kids.  He is a non-smoker,
occasional ETOH, AND no drugs.

Family History:
Father and mother had CAD.

unable to folow commands or answer questions. He has significant
psychomotor slowing.  His recent recall is poor.  Cranial Nerve
Examination:  His pupils are equal and reactive to light, 3 mm
to 2 mm bilaterally.  Extraocular movements are full.  Visual
fields are full to confrontation.  Funduscopic examination
reveals sharp disks margins bilaterally.  His face is symmetric.
 He has corneals bilaterally.  His hearing is grossly intact.
His tongue is midline.  Palate goes up in the midline.
Sternocleidomastoids and upper trapezius are strong.  Motor
Examination:  He does not have a drift.  He can move all 4
extremities well.  His muscle tone is normal.  His reflexes are
2- at brachioradialis, 2+ at biceps, 0 at triceps, 2- at knees,
and 0 at ankles.  His toes are down going.  His gait is
wide-based and he has retropulsion.

Relevant Imaging:
1)CT Head ([**7-5**]): No acute intracranial hemorrhage.  Vasogenic
edema from the known metastatic lesion in the left frontal lobe
is more prominent.  For further evaluation, MRI with gadolineum
can be performed.

2)MRI Head ([**7-5**]): Increase in size of enhancing component of
the left frontal lobe metastatic lesion with increased
surrounding edema compared with the immediate prior MRI of
[**2148-5-20**]. No underlying infarct is identified. No evidence of
midline shift or hydrocephalus.

2)Cxray ([**7-5**]): Post-radiation and post-surgery changes in the
right perihilar region.  No new abnormalities to account for
change in mental status.  CT may be considered for more complete
characterization if clinical suspicion persists.

4)CT Chest w/contrast ([**7-9**]): Stable post-operative appearance,
right upper lobectomy. No evidence of intrathoracic malignancy.

5)CT Head ([**7-12**]): Small foci of blood and pneumocephalus in the
left frontal lobe status post left frontal craniotomy are
expected post- operative findings. No evidence of large
intracranial hemorrhage. Unchanged mass effect on frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**]
of the left lateral ventricle.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 75-year-old right-handed man with CAD, CHF, h/o
stroke, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and metastatic NSCLC
cancer, s/p Cyberknife on [**2148-3-14**] to brain metastases who
presents with altered mental status.

(1) NSCLC with Brain Metastases: Patient presented with acute
mental status changes in the setting of increased vasogenic
edema surrounding left frontal metastasis. He was placed on
Decadron for edema and Keppra for anti-seizure prophylaxis.
Aspirin, Coumadin, and [**Date Range **] were held in anticipation for
surgery. He was transferred to the neurosurgery service for a
left frontal craniotomy for tumor resection. He underwent the
procedure without complications. Repeat CT scan head consistent
with post-operative changes. Patient was then transferred back
to oncology service. Mental status slowly returned to baseline.
He is scheduled to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] within 1 week after being
discharge. In addition, he is scheduled in the neurosurgery
clinic on [**7-22**] for removal of his sutures.

(2) CAD: s/p inferior STEMI in [**2146**] with [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 5175**] to left
circumflex. He had been on Aspirin and [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] as outpatient but
per wife had not been taking the [**Name (NI) **] everyday. Both were
stopped few days prior to surgery. Per neurosurgery, Aspirin
325mg should be started on [**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**7-19**]. Since patient is 2
