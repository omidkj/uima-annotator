Service: [**Month/Day/Year 662**]

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2763**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension, tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bilateral IJ attempts
R femoral CVL placement

History of Present Illness:
88F with s/p high grade MRSA endocarditis s/p prolonged
hospitalization now on suppressive doxycycline, CHF, DM-II,
anuric renal insufficiency on HD, Afib not on AC, and s/p being
dropped off a stretcher at HD 3 days ago resutling in an ICH who
presents from HD for management of hypotension to the 60s and
tachycardia to the 170s. It appears that she was in Afib. Over
the past few weeks she has had to stop dialysis for hypotension
on several occasions. She denies symptoms at those times, but
per her son she slurred her words somewhat more. She has also
had recurrent bouts of nausea and vomiting in that time. She is
diffusely edematous. She denies asymmetric edema. She
unfortunately was dropped off of a stretcher and landed on her
head three days prior to admission. She was seen in the [**Hospital1 18**]
ED, and was found to have an ICH. The family decided to make her
CMO and take her home, but continue dialysis. At her HD session
today she was hypotensive to the 60s and tachycardic to the
170s. She was transfered to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED once again. In the ED
her initial vital signs were 97.2 87/57 134 18 95% on RA. A CXR
showed no focal infiltrates and no pulmonary edema. A RIJ and
LIJ were attempted, but failed. Ultimately, a R femoral CVL was
placed. She was started on neosynepherine ggt for hypotension,
but continued to drop her SBP. Vasopressin, then norepinepherine
were then added and titrated to maximum doses with persistent
hypotension to the 80s. The patient was asymptomatic the entire
time. A repeat head CT showed no interval change in her known
ICH. She was given vancomycin and pip/tazo for possible sepsis,
bolused 750mL NS, and sent to the floor.
.
On the arrival on the floor she was tachycardic to the 170s.
Initially, BPs were not possible to read on her arms or legs. A
large blood pressure cuff was inflated on her arm for a few
minutes, and then a small cuff was placed over the area of her
arm that had been compressed and was thus less edematous. The BP
then read 109/79. She received diltiazem 5mg IV push x 2 and her
pulse ccame down to the 90s. Her SBP was sustained around 100.
.
A discussion was held with her son [**Name (NI) 382**] and daughter. [**Name (NI) **]
DNR/DNI status was confirmed. We further agreed not to perform
further invassive procedures such as Alines. The were told
explicitly that if we cannot support her blood pressure with
medications, that she may die.
.

Images:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2167-12-24**] 5:34 PM An AP
radiograph of the chest reveals low lung volumes bilaterally. A
dual-lumen central venous line terminates AT the cavoatrial
junction. There is a left pleural effusion and prominent
interstitial markings bilaterally. Mild cardiomegaly is noted as
well as some fullness to the hila bilaterally. Degenerative
changes are noted at the right glenohumeral joint. IMPRESSION:
Suboptimal image with suggestion of a left pleural effusion,
cardiomegaly, and interstitial opacities, together suggestive of
hypervolemia. We would recommend repeat evaluation with PA and
lateral views for more precise characterization, when clinically
feasible.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2167-12-19**] 1:05 PM There is a
linear focus of hyperdensity adjacent to the left lateral
ventricle in the corona radiata (2:19) which is new since prior
exam and may represent a focus of intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Prominence of the ventricles and extra-axial spaces is stable
and compatible with age- appropriate volume loss. Subcortical
and periventricular areas of hypodensity are related to chronic
small vessel ischemic disease. There is no mass effect. The
basal cisterns and suprasellar cistern are clear. There is no
fracture. The visualized mastoid air cells are grossly
unremarkable. There is minimal mucosal thickening in the
posterior right ethmoid sinus air cell. Patient is likely status
post bilateral cataract surgery. IMPRESSION: New focus of
hyperdensity in the left corona radiata adjacent to the left
lateral ventricle may represent a focus of intraparenchymal
hemorrhage. Clinical correlation and close followup is
recommended. MRI can help for further assessment.

Brief Hospital Course:
88F with s/p high grade MRSA endocarditis s/p prolonged
hospitalization discharged on suppressive doxycycline, CHF,
DM-II, anuric renal insufficiency on HD, Afib not on AC, and s/p
being dropped off a stretcher at HD 3 days prior to admission
resulting in an ICH admitted for management of hypotension and
tachycardia. Given her history of high grade MRSA bacteremia,
sepsis was a concern intitially. However, she was febrile for
all of her past bacteremias and is afebrile now. Alternatively,
her hypotension could be due to Afib, PE, cardiogenic shock, or
adrenal insufficiency. Her goals of care are more focused on
palliative care. Her SBPs were initially [**Location (un) 1131**] around 100mmHg
on levophed at max dose, neosynepherine at max dose, and
vasopressin at max dose. Her Afib with RVR was rate controlled
briefly with diltiazem, and her SBP improved somewhat. She was
also extremely edematous. Despite three pressors at max doses
her blood pressure continued to fall and her mental status
worsened. She was treated empirically for sepsis with daptomycin
and pip/tazo. A central venous oxygen saturation was 22%
consistent with a cardiogenic picture. Given her massive edema
over the past week and clinical picture, it was ultimately
believed that she was in caridogenic shock. She was unresponsive
to treatments. Given her goals of care prior to admission were
comfort, she was m
