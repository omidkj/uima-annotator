Pertinent Results:
Labs on admission:
[**2118-4-14**] 11:30 am Hct 31.5, WBC 4.3, Plts 128, INR 1.9
               Na 146, K 4.0, Cl 112, CO2 22, BUN 27, Creat 0.9
               CK 93, Trop T 0.01
               UA negative

Studies:
CXR [**2118-4-14**] Heart size is unchanged; bilateral small pleural
effusion with atelectasis.  No CHF noted.  No PNA.

EGD [**2118-4-14**]:
Schatzki's ring.
Erosions in the gastroesophageal junction.
Esophagitis in the gastroesophageal junction.
Gastric deformity.
Erythema in the antrum compatible with gastritis.
Ulcers in the duodenal bulb.
Erythema in the duodenal bulb compatible with duodenitis.

Head CT [**2118-4-15**]:
Stable appearance of the brain parenchyma from earlier in the
day. No intracranial hemorrhage.

KUB [**2118-4-16**]:
Features of mechanical small-bowel obstruction.

CT abd [**2118-4-17**]:
1. Findings consistent with ileus. There are dilated loops of
small bowel with air-fluid levels without transition point.
2. Gallstone.
3. A small amount of fluid around the liver, around the
gallbladder and in the pelvis.
4. Cirrhotic liver.
5. Persistent native portosystemic shunt. (right posterior
portal vein to right hepatic vein)

EEG [**2118-4-19**]:
This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the presence of
intermittent, focal delta frequency slowing involving the right
anterior
quadrant. This finding suggests subcortical dysfunction in this
region
and is a relatively non-specific finding with regard to an
evaluation
for seizures. In addition, the background rhythm is slowed with
occasional generalized delta frequency slowing. This finding
suggests
deep, midline subcortical dysfunction and it is consistent with
an
encephalopathy. Note was made of an irregular rhythm with
occasional
ectopy on the cardiac monitor. No epileptiform abnormalities
were seen.

CXR [**2118-4-21**]:
1) OG tube terminating in the distal esophagus. It should be
advanced to appropriately lie within the stomach.
2) Retrocardiac left lower lobe atelectasis/consolidation.

EGD [**2118-4-21**]:
- Ulcer in the upper third of the esophagus, Schatzki's ring,
grade II esophagitis in the gastroesophageal junction.

A.  Upper esophagus, mucosal biopsy:
1.)  Squamous epithelium with active esophagitis and ulceration.
2.)  No neoplasm identified.
3.)  Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain for fungi is negative
(positive control slide).

Colonoscopy [**2118-4-21**]:
multiple non-bleeding diverticula in the entire colon and rectal
varices.

Video Swallow [**2118-4-25**]:
Video oropharyngeal swallow study: The study was performed in
conjunction with the Speech and Swallow Service. Please refer to
their note for recommendations and full details in the online
medical record. Various consistencies of barium were
administered to the patient. There was premature spillover of
thin liquids through straw to the level of the piriform sinuses.
There is prolonged AP transport piecemeal swallow for all
consistencies. Bolus propulsion is mildly impaired. There is a
small amount of ground solid residue in puree consistent in the
valleculae, which clears after a subsequent swallow. There was
penetration noted for consecutive straw sips of nectar thick
liquid. A chin tuck maneuver effectively prevents penetration of
straw sips. The barium pill passes freely without holdup.

IMPRESSION: No aspiration observed for all consistencies.
However, there is moderate oral and mild pharyngeal dysphagia as
described

Brief Hospital Course:
88 yo man with A fib on coumadin and CHF presents with melena
and maroon stool in rectal vault. EGD done in the ED revealed
gastritis, esophagitis, and duodenitis with signs of recent
bleeding but no active bleeding. He was hemodynamically stable
and transferred to the floor. He was noted to be obtunded on
HD#2 and was transferred to the ICU.

Patient transferred from floor after being intubated for airway
protection secondary to altered mental status.  Felt that
patient may have encephalopathy secondary to GI bleed.  Patient
started on lactulose while in unit.  Patient had CT scan of head
and EEG which were both negative.  He was given 6 liters of prep
for a colonoscopy and put out very minimal stool.  Felt that
patient may have partial bowel obstruction.  Patient's Hct
stabalized felt that c-scope not urgent.  Patient after 2 days
in the unit started to produce stool.  Felt better to have
c-scope procedure done while patient on sedation and intubated.
Patient had c-scope and EGD with push enteroscopy which was
negative for any active bleeding.  Rectal varacies were
indentified.  After scope patient was weaned off sedation and
exubated.  During ICU course patient had witnessed aspiration
after coughing out trach tube.  Patient was started on
antibiotic course for asp. PNA after temperature spike and
positive sputum cultures for Klebsiella, E. Coli, and
Pseudomonas.  PAtient was initially put on levo/ceftaz and
flagyl.  Later patient kept on just ceftaz and flagyl.
Patient's mental status gradually improved while in the ICU and
he was transferred back to the floor.

1) Esophagitis, Gastritis, Duodenitis - No signs/symptoms of
active bleeding.  Etiology unknown.  Patient denies recent NSAID
use.  H.pylori IgG negative.  He was Continued on Protonix. He
initially receieved 2 units of PRBC in the ED, Hct remained
stable during the rest of his hospital course.

2) Delirium. Likely related to encephalopathy precipitated by
GIB (elevated ammonia) vs meds from EGD done in ED. Likely with
continued delirium after prolonged intubation and ICU stay. His
mental status is somewhat improved since starting lactulose
although not at baseline. As per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was independent of all
ADL's, cooking, and driving.
- Head CT negative.
- EEG done on [**4-19**] with right anterior bursts of delta slowing
amidst theta/delta background consistent with encephalopathy. No
epileptiform activity.
- He was continued on lactulose for a goal of 3 BM's per day.

3) Cirrhosis noted on Abd CT (Abd CT from [**6-15**] with some
evidence of cirrhosis). Etiology unclear. Liver Team was
involved in his care.

DDX includes EtOH (although no known history of EtOH abuse),
autoimmune (not likely given [**Doctor First Name **] 1:40, IgG 1210, anti-smooth
muscle 1:20), hemachromatosis (Fe studies WNL), infectious
(unlikely given negative Hep B and C viral load), Celiac Sprue
(TTG WNL), PBC (IgM WNL, AMA pending at discharge ), cardiac
congestion.

- RUQ U/S ([**4-16**]) w/o ascites
- unconjugated bili not elevated, therefore less likely related
to cardiac congestion as per liver
- continued on la
