History of Present Illness:
This 54 year old with history of DM, HTN s/p total knee
replacement presenting with acute worsening of right knee pain.
He reports fevers at home and not feeling himself.  His wife
noted that he had some slurring of his speach at home which she
felt was due to how dry he was.  He reports that he has had this
knee pain for three days and has been unable to bear any weight.
 He had a fever at home to 102 the day before yesterday.  He has
had no chest pain, no shortness of breath, no belly pain, no
urinary symptoms.  He also noted that his blood sugars had been
very difficult to control.
  In the ED Ortho tapped his knee and got 70 cc of purulent
fluid.  He was hypotensive to 70/45 so the sepsis protocol was
initiated.  He was given Vanco, Levofloxacin, and started on an
Insulin drip.  He was also given 6 liters NS and Levophed was
started peripherally.  On transfer up here he had continued knee
pain, no chest pain or shortness of breath.  His BP remained
with SBP in the 90-110s.
.
During his stay in the MICU, was found to have positive blood,
urine, and knee joint aspirate cultures for MSSA on [**11-13**].
Blood cultures grew out 6/6 bottles. His MAP was supported with
fluid boluses and levophed for goal MAP>60.  His levophed was
eventually titrated off, his lactate trended down, and his WBC
count trended downward as well.  An echo (TTE) was performed
that did not show any masses or vegetations.  IV Vanc and Gent
were continued.  He was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for surgical
management of his R knee, removal of hardware/potential source
of sepsis.  On arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], c/o right knee pain and RUQ
pain.  VSS.  Sepsis greatly resolved, normal WBC ct, afebrile,
hypertensive.  With elevated total bili with elevated direct
bili, clinical jaundice.  RUQ ultrasound with dopplers neg for
portal vein thrombosis, pos for gallstones and mild gall bladder
wall edema, poss [**3-4**] underlying liver ds, no biliary ductal
dilitation, diffuse nodularity of liver c/w cirrhosis,
splenomegaly.  Pt with known h/o hep C, untreated, and alcoholic
cirrhosis.  His amylase and lipase were not elevated, and his
LFTs are only slightly elevated.  Liver was consulted, and it
was felt to be not optimal at this time to take him to the OR,
given that his sepsis has largely resolved/held at bay with IV
antibiotics, no emergent need to take to OR.  Orthopedics aware
and would like to be notified when pt is stable from LIver
standpoint on the medical floor to go for surgery.
Also, for his antiobiotic therapy, he underwent Cefazolin
desensitization upon arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], and is to continue this
for 6 weeks per ID recommendations.  He will need placement of a
PICC line and this was ordered today.
