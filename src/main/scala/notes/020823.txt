Brief Hospital Course:
Saddle pulmonary embolus: The patient was transferred to the ICU
and monitored on telemetry. He did not have any hemodynamic
compromise and stayed stable from a respiratory standpoint on
nasal cannula. The patient was immediately started on a heparin
drip. Oral therapy with Coumadin was initiated. Since the
patient remained stable, he was transferred to the general
medicine floors. On the general medicine floors, the patient
remained stable. His heparin was discontinued after his INR was
in the therapeutic range of 2.0-3.0. The day prior to discharge,
the patient had an INR=2.8 and on the day of discharge his
INR=3.2. The patient was educated about Coumadin and advised not
