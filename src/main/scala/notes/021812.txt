None


History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 88 yo male with CAD, GERD, Hyperlipidemia, who
presented on [**2156-6-26**] with shortness of breath. He had seen his
PCP two days prior to admission with fevers to 102.5, chills,
dry cough, and started on Levaquin for community acquired
pneumonia. He got worsening shortness of breath and went to the
emergency room. In the ED, noted to be 96% on room air with
ambulatory sat of 93%. CTA was negative for PE. He was started
on levaquin for likely community acquired pneumonia as well as
prednisone for a likely reactive airway component.
ROS: normally, able to walk 1.5 miles stopping secondary to leg
pain. No CP/PND/orthopnea. No recent travel. No pets. No sick
contacts. [**Name (NI) **] recent weight loss. No night sweats.

first diagonal
5. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
6. Depression.
7. Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
8. Status post cholecystectomy.


Social History:
FOrmer vocational school teacher. No tobacco. Rare EtOH.


Family History:
No lung or heart disease in family. M: died of CVA

Physical Exam:
T: 95.3, BP: 136/60; HR: 73; RR: 19; O2: 98 NRB
Gen: On NRB, comfortable, able to speak in 5 word sentences. No
accessory muscle use.
HEENT: PERRL; EOMI; sclera anicteric; OP clear
Neck: No LAD. JVD flat
CV: distant, S1S2. No M/R/G
Lungs: Diffuse rhnochi bilaterally in all lung fields. +wheezing
Back: no spinal, paraspinal, CVA tenderness
Abd: Soft, NT, ND
Ext: No edema. DP 2+
Neuro: A&O x 3. Conversant and appropriate.


Pertinent Results:
CXR PA/LAT 5/19/07-1.  No pneumonia is identified.
2.  Low lung volumes are diminished bilaterally, some of which
is related to poor inspiratory effort and some of which is
related to dependent atelectatic changes which is more severe on
the left side.
3.  Severe osteoarthritis of the right acromioclavicular joint.
An old fracture deformity of the right distal clavicle.
.
CTA [**2156-6-26**]-
1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2.  Mild bronchiectasis in both lower lobes posteromedially,
with mild bronchiectasis in the right middle lobe.  There is
bronchovascular thickening and bronchial wall thickening in both
lower lobes. Findings may represent early pneumonia.
.
EKG: Atrial fibrillation at 62. Normal axis. Normal intervals.
No ST
changes.

[**6-28**] ECHO

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity
size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta
is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally
normal with
good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an
anterior space
which most likely represents a fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Preserved global biventricular systolic function.

CT HEAD WO CONTRAST [**6-30**]

FINDINGS: The study is limited by patient motion. No intra or
extraaxial hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of normally midline
structures is identified. Ventricles and sulci are slightly
prominent consistent with age-related involutional change and
stable since the prior study. The previously noted right
sphenoid [**Doctor First Name 362**] meningioma is not well seen on the current study.
There is an air-fluid level in the left maxillary sinus. Soft
tissues appear unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Air-fluid level in the left maxillary sinus.

Brief Hospital Course:
88 yo male with HTN, CAD, hyperlipidemia, presents with hypoxia,
thought to have pneumonia.

# Hypoxemia- The patient was initially diagnosed with CAP and
was stable on [**3-14**] L nc on the floor. On day 2, O2 saturtion
noted to be 93 on 3L NC. On routine vital sign check at 9 pm,
noted to have O2 saturations 81-88%. A nebulizer treatment
improved O2 saturations to 90% to 94% on NRB. ABG on 5L was
7.52/28/56. On NRB it was 7.48/32/79 with a lactate of 3.2. Per
wife, at 6 pm pt sounded "congested" on the telephone, which was
a change. Also, pt reported that a piece of rice may have been
aspirated when he coughed at lunchtime. He was transferred to
the ICU for 24 hours, was able to wean down NRB to FM and then
again nc. Acapella device was used, pt thought to have
bronchiectasis besides pneumonia. A speech and swallow
evaluation was normal. Initially on levaquin, later switched to
azithromycin and CTX. Received 3 days of steroids.

.
# Atrial fibrillation-a fib on EKG on floor. Repeat in unit
showed sinus tachycardia. Likely [**3-12**] hypoxia. No acute EKG or ST
changes. He was monitored on telemetry with no events, and an
echo was wnl, showing only slight diastolic CHF.
Anticoagulation not indicated.
.
# MS changes: 2 days prior to discharge, the patient became
combative and confused in the evening and had to be restrained.
CT head was normal. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1634**] consult was obtained, recommendations
were 0.25 mg Haldol prn and zyprexa standing at night. The pt??????s
confusion resolved prior to discharge and was thought to be due
to hospital environment, ICU, and medications.

# CAD- no changes on EKG. Continued ASA, statin, BB

# CKD- creatinine baseline 1.3. s/p mucomyst and bicarb post
contrast.  Improved to 1.2
.
# HTN- continue CCB, restart BB.
.
# FEN cardiac diet
.
# Access PIV
