Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3256**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea and cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
59 yo F w/ PMH of gastric bypass and known DVT/PE >10 years ago
in post-op course presents with worsening dyspnea and cough.  Pt
reports over the past many months that she has had worsening
cough which is productive of sputum leading to coughin fits and
she has been worked up by her PCP and allergist.  Two days prior
she noted acute worsening of her dyspnea on exertion as she
walked up a slight incline and then the day of admission noted
to have dyspnea just alking around the kitchen and was concerned
re: reoccurance of a PE.  Pt reports no family history of
PE/DVT, denies any recent hospitalizations or prolonged
immobilizations. She reports being worked up by a hematologist
after her last DVT/PE but does not know what the workup
consisted of. She reports being up to date on her colonoscopy
and mamaograms which have all been negative.  She reports
chronic right sided knee pain from her OA s/p TKR and recently
has developed worsening groin pain that is uncomfortable to sit
at times.

In the ED she initially triggered for tachycardia and was found
to be in sinus tach on her EKG, her exam was notable for a
normal lung exam and CXR that per report was unchanged compared
to prior.  She had a d-dimer checked that was eelvated and CTPA
showed massive bilateral Pulmonary emboli.  She was given one
dose of lovenox 90mg (1mg/kg dosing) and admitted to the MICU
for monitoring given her persistent tachycardia.  She had some
ST depressions in the lateral leads of her EKG and her troponin
was 0.02. She denied any chest pain.

On arrival to the MICU she complained of cough but denied chest
pain, reported some chest discomfort. Denied fevers, chills,
sick contacts.

CXR - FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were
obtained.  Posterior left diaphragmatic hernia is again seen
with mild overlying atelectasis.  No focal consolidation,
pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The
cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable, as are the hilar
contours.
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.

CTA Chest - IMPRESSION:
1.  Extensive bilateral pulmonary embolus, without evidence of
pulmonary infarction.  Mild dilatation of the right ventricle as
compared to the left may be an early sign of right heart strain.
 Findings could be correlated with echocardiogram.
2.  Chronic elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  Previously
fat-containing left Bochdalek hernia now contains colon

TTE
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is unusually small. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The right ventricular cavity
is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. There
is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2135-9-2**],
the right ventricle is dilated and hypokinetic with evidence of
pressure/volume overload. The left ventricle is smaller and
hyperdynamic, likely due to interventricular dependence.
Pulmonary pressures are now elevated. Findings suggestive of
acute right heart strain from pulmonary embolism.

LENI's -IMPRESSION:
1. Focal DVT in the left popliteal vein of indeterminate age. No
other sites of DVT within the left lower extremity.
2. No evidence of DVT in the right lower extremity.

Brief Hospital Course:
59 yo F w/ pmh of PE presenting with worsening dyspnea,
tachycardia found to have bilateral PEs on CTPA.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
#Bilateral Pulmonary Emboli: Patient presented with nonspecific
respiratory symptoms and worsening dyspnea with 3L oxygen
requirement and was found to have elevated Ddimer with CTPA
consistent with bilateral pulmonary emboli.  EKG showed sinus
tachycardia and only TW flattening in lead III. She was started
on lovenox 1mg/kg (100mg) [**Hospital1 **]. The patient's risk factors for PE
are previous DVT/PE in the post-op setting following orthopedic
surgery. Age appropriate cancer screening including mamogram and
colonoscopy had been negative per patient.  Ultrasound of lower
extremities were ordered to assess for clot burden and revealed
LLE popliteal DVT.  TTE showed evidence of moderate right heart
strain.  On lovenox, the patient's respiratory status improved.
She was started on coumadin. On discharge she understood plans
for bridging and was planning to have INR checked on [**10-7**] at
PCP's office.

#Cough: Patient had cough with worsening dyspnea on admission.
While it may relate to her known PEs, she also had productive
sputum and a history of cough over the previous several months.
She remained afebrile and without leukocytosis while in the ICU.
She was treated symptomatically with guaifenasin and albuterol
nebs.

#Tachycardia: Patient was in sinus tachycardia 110s-120s most
likely due to her pulmonary emboli. Her blood pressure remained
stable with SBP 120s-130s.

INACTIVE ISSUES:
#Anemia: Hct remained stable and close to baseline of 29 from
[**5-/2136**] throughout ICU stay. Given her history of gastric bypass,
is likely due to malabsorption.  Iron studies showed evidence of
[**Doctor First Name **].

#Depression/Anxiety: Continued home cymbalta and
