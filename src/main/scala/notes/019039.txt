Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1390**]
Chief Complaint:
15-foot fall from ladder with sternal fx/mediastinal hematoma, R
PTX, R rib fxs [**6-24**], T6-10/12 fx, L hemothorax

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**12-17**]: R chest tube placement
[**12-18**]: L chest tube placement
[**12-20**]: IVC filter placement
[**12-19**]: R chest tube placement
[**12-24**]: R chest tube placement

History of Present Illness:
69M s/p fall from a ladder, approximately [**9-30**] feet.  He was
initially managed at an OSH where he received CT scans of the
head, c-spine, chest, abdomen, and pelvis which revealed a
sternal fracture at the manubrium with associated hematoma,
right [**6-24**] rib fractures with pneumothorax, T6-10, T12 vertebral
fractures, and subcutaneous air near the neck. Patient was
intubated and a right sided chest tube placed to evacuate the
pneumothorax. Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] he was evaluated by the
Acute Care Surgery service who also consulted Thoracic Surgery
to evaluate possible tracheobronchial injury.

Patient was admitted to TSICU, and blood pressures remained low
despite aggressive fluid rescucitation. Patient was placed on
low dose Levophed and bedside TTE and TEE performed. A hematoma
slightly compressing the left atrium was visualized on ECHO and
CTA, deemed to be likely slow venous bleed. A left chest tube
was placed that drained 300 cc sanguinous fluid. Several
fractures of the thoracic spine visualzed on MRI, and abdominal
brace in place.

report he was AOx3
at time of presentation to OSH.

Resp: Intubated, coarse ventilator sounds, CTA
anteriorly, unable to auscultate posteriorly due to precautions
for spinal fractures.  Right sided chest tube with a 1 chamber
air leak and serosanguinous discharge.  Small amount of

of crepitus over right chest, no crepitus palpable in neck or
left chest.
Neck: cervical collar in place
Lungs: R chest tube
MAE spontaneously off sedation, not following commands.

[**2198-12-18**]:
TTE Preserved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular systolic function. Trivial
pericardial effusion. Concern for mechanical external
compression of the left atrial wall.

CXR:  There again is widening of the superior mediastinum.
Indistinctness is seen of the aortic arch, possibility of
post-traumatic bleeding. Engorgement of pulmonary vessels is
consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Hazy
opacification in the left hemithorax suggests pleural effusion
with opacification tracking upward along the lateral chest wall.
The possibility of this supervening consolidation would be
difficult to exclude in the appropriate clinical setting.

CXR: Interval placement of the left chest tube. Left deep sulcus
sign with small radiolucent area concerning for a small
pneumothorax.

CTA CHEST: Slight enlargement of hematoma surrounding the
descending intrathoracic aorta most likely from a venous source
as there is no evidence of active arterial extravasation or
aortic injury. The hematoma may be causing slight mass effect on
the left atrium. Shortening of the thoracic AP diameter due to
multiple displaced posterior right rib fractures, likely
contributing to mild left atrial compression. Small
hemopericardium, unchanged since the outside hospital study
performed one day prior. No evidence of tamponade. Small
bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right. The left
hemothorax has slightly increased in size since one day prior.
Pneumothorax has nearly resolved with only a tiny right anterior
pneumothorax remaining. Retrosternal hematoma remains stable in
size. No evidence of active extravasation. Significant right rib
fractures, comminuted sternal fracture, and vertebral body
fractures as described above.

CT TSPINE: Multiple thoracic spine compression fractures as
described in with retropulsion of the inferior aspect of T8 and
T9 vertebral bodies. Associated findings consistent with
enlargement of
hematoma surrounding the descending intrathoracic aorta,
subcutaneous
emphysema, bilateral pleural effusions, multiple rib fractures.

MRI CSPINE/ TSPINE: 1. Multiple thoracic vertebral fractures
with retropulsion of the posterior cortex at T8 and T9 levels.
The retropulsed posterior cortex contacts the spinal cord at [**Name (NI) 59724**]
with a suspicious area of increased cord signal at this level
concerning for cord edema/contusion. Close attention on followup
imaging is recommended. 2. Interspinous ligament injury at T7-T8
and T8-T9 levels. 3. Increased signal intensity along the
posterior paraspinal soft tissues, suggestive of soft tissue
injury.
4. Bilateral pleural effusions and prevertebral hematoma are
similar to that seen on the prior CT. 5. Unremarkable MRI of the
cervical spine.

[**2198-12-20**] KUB Fluoroscopic assistance was provided to the surgeon
without the radiologist present. Total fluoroscopy time was 81.8
seconds. A single fluoroscopic spot view demonstrates a deployed
IVC filter with its tip at the lower edge of L2 vertebral body.
Please refer to the operative note for further details.

[**2198-12-20**] CXR Bilateral chest tubes remain in place, with no
visible
pneumothorax. Indwelling support and monitoring devices are
similar in position with endotracheal tube terminating about 2.4
cm above the carina. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
Bibasilar atelectasis is again demonstrated, slightly worse on
the right, but improving on the left. Small pleural effusions
are also demonstrated.

[**2198-12-21**] CXR: No evidence of active bleeding. Unchanged positions
of bilateral chest tubes and endotracheal tube.

[**2198-12-22**] CXR: interval increase in bilateral pleural
effusions. Multiple rib fractures on the left are better
appreciated as well as the right rib fractures than on the prior
examination. The patient is also in pulmonary edema.

[**2197-12-23**] : The ET tube tip is 6.5 cm above the carina. The right
subclavian line tip is at the level of mid SVC.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Right lung opacity
and left basal consolidation are unchanged. Mild pulmonary edema
is unchanged. The NG tube tip is in the stomach. Overall no
substantial change since the prior radiograph is demonstrated.
No interval development of pneumothorax is seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 92275**] was evaluated in our trauma bay with physical survey
and imaging showing the following injuries:
Sternal fx
Mediastinal hematoma
Pulmonary contusion
R pneumothorax
L hemothorax
T-spine fx t6-10 & 12

By system:

Neuro: CT of the T-spine showed multiple T-spine fractures
(T4,T6-T10,T12), with possible unstable T8 & T10 fractures.
This was followed with an MRI showing spinal cord contusion at
T9 but stable ligaments throughout.  Patient's neurologic exam
was within normal limits. Neurosurgery recommended non-operative
management with a TLSO brace which was maintained through his
hospitalization.
