Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain and shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2120-12-2**] Five vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting utilizing
the left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending;
saphenous vein grafts to diagonal, first and second obtuse
marginals, and posterior descending artery
[**2120-12-5**] Exploratory laparotomy, liver biopsy and
cholecystectomy


History of Present Illness:
This 66 year old woman has a history of hypertension,
hyperlipidemia and diabetes. Several weeks prior to admission,
she reported that she has had two episodes of chest pain and
shortness of breath. The first occurred while having to climb up
32 steps at a movie theatre during a fire drill. She describes
having very severe shortness of breath and a feeling that there
was no way she would make it to the top. The second episode
occurred while trying to walk [**State 101220**]to go from
her parking lot to the theatre. She again described having
severe shortness of breath and chest pains, resolving with
relaxation. She states that she recently saw her primary care
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3845**] who told her that her EKG looked
significantly different compared to the one from several years
back. She has since seen Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 33428**] [**Name (STitle) **] in consultation and
underwent stress testing that was positive for ischemia.
Subsequent cardiac catheterization on [**2120-11-21**] revealed three
vessel coronary artery disease and a reduced ejection fraction
without evidence of mitral regurgitation calculated at 34%.
Coronary angiography showed a codominant system; the LAD showed
a 80% stenosis of the midsegment followed by sequential 80%
stenosis in the distal segment, accompanied by a 80% proximal D1
stenosis; the LCX was a large, codominant vessel with an 80%
midsegment stenosis and 80% OM2 and 80% OM3 stenoses; the RCA
showed an 80% midsegment stenosis with a 100% distal occlusion
and left to right collaterals filling the codominant RPDA. Based
on the above results, she was referred for cardiac surgical
intervention. At the time of cardiac catheterization, she
underwent routine preoperative evaluation. She was cleared and
discharged home per cardiology. She now presents for elective
surgical coronary revascularization.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted and underwent five vessel coronary artery
bypass grafting by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. The operation was uneventful and
she transferred to the CSRU for invasive monitoring. Within 24
hours, she awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. She
weaned from inotropic support without difficulty and transferred
to the SDU on postoperative day one. On postoperative day two,
she developed atrial fibrillation which was treated with
Amiodarone and beta blockade. Early on postoperative day three,
she complained of right sided abdominal pain and concomitantly
experienced altered mental status. Initial abdominal ultrasound
was unremarkable while a head CT scan found no evidence for
hemorrhage, or acute major vascular territorial infarction. She
rapidly declined clinically, becoming unresponsive and
hypotensive with increasing oxygen requirements and decreased
urine output. She emergently returned to the CSRU where she
underwent intubation and resuscitation. Monitoring lines were
placed. Amiodarone was discontinued. She required pressors and
was profoundly acidotic with an elevated lactate, low
bicarbonate and high white count. Her creatinine also rose.
Based upon this clinical picture and strong suspicion for
mesenteric ischemia, she was taken without delay to the
operating room. On [**2120-12-5**], an exploratory laparotomy, liver
biopsy and cholecystectomy was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
Operative findings were notable for severe liver and gall
bladder congestion - there was no evidence of mesenteric
ischemia as the large and small bowel appeared normal. Liver
pathology was consistent with ischemia while gall bladder
findings revealed mild chronic cholecystitis. She returned to
the CSRU for further invasive monitoring and medical management.
She was kept intubated and sedated while broad spectrum
antibiotics were continued. Her acute renal failure was
attributed to acute tubular necrosis secondary to hypoperfusion.
Her creatinine peaked to 5.1. The renal service was consulted.
She temporarily required CVVH. A renal ultrasound was
unremarkable. Her urine output and hyperkalemia gradually
improved with intravenous Lasix and Diurel. Her shock liver
gradually improved as well. During her hospitalization, her AST
and ALT peaked at 6339 and [**Numeric Identifier 101221**]; LDH and Alk Phos peaked at
[**Numeric Identifier 101222**] and 276; and Total bili peaked at 2.9. A repeat abdominal
ultrasound on [**12-6**] remained unremarkable. She
concomitantly continued to experience episodes of atrial
fibrillation and sinus bradycardia. Several cardioversions were
attempted, but unsuccessful. Pronestyl and Procainamide
therapies were eventually started in attempts to maintain a
normal sinus rhythm. She was eventually started on tube feedings
for nutritional support. Over several days, her clinical status
improved. By postoperative day 10, she weaned from sedation and
was re-extubated without incident. She remained neurologically
intact and weaned from pressor support without difficulty. Her
renal and liver function continued to improve. She maintained
mostly a normal sinus rhythm with a rate in the 60-70's but
continued to experience paroxsymal atrial fibrillation. Warfarin
was eventually initiated. Procain and NAPA levels were monitored
closely and titrated accordingly while serial ECGs were obtained
to assess QTc interval. Tube feedings were eventually
discontinued and her diet was slowly advanced as tolerated. On
postoperative day 15, she returned to the SDU. Antibiotics were
empirically continued. Medical therapy was optimized and
Warfarin was dosed for a goal INR around 1.5 - 2.0. She
continued to work with physical therapy and make clinical
improvements. Due to poor IV access, a double lumen PICC line
was temporarily placed in her right upper arm. She was
eventually cleared for discharge to rehab on postoperative day
18. At d
