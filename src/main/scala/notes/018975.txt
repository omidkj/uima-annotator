History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 75 year old female with a history of
cryptogenic cirrhosis (seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with portal
hypertension, CHF EF >60%,  and DMII who presents to the ED on
[**2141-9-6**] with the chief complaint of diarrhea for 10 days. The
patient was recently discharged approximately a week ago with
cellulitis and placed on clindamycin and levaquin. During her
stay, she had developed diarrhea but failed to inform her
doctors.
.
In addition, she had been taking sandostain 100mcg [**Hospital1 **] since
[**Month (only) 216**] which has significanly reduced the frequency of PRBC
transfusion requirement secondary to angiodysplasia which may
have also contributed to her symptoms.
.
After her discharge, she continued to experience voluminous (>2
cups), bloody diarrhea occuring 8-9 times a day for the past 10
days. She denies any abdominal pain but admits to nausea without
vomiting. She has also noted increased abdominal girth. She
informed her hepatologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who planned for a flex
sigmoidoscopy which the patient is scheduled for tomorrow.
However, as the patient was having poor PO intake, she was
advised to report to the ED directly.
.
She denies any fevers/chills/sick contacts at home. No recent
travel but recent antibiotics. She does have a history of GIB
secondary to angiodysplasia but states that this has not been a
problem recently and this bloody diarrhea is unlike her prior
presentations. No abdominal pain. No melena.
.
She admits to lightheadedness/dizziness but denies any syncope.
She admits to shortness of breath which she says happens when
she's anemic.
.
ROS:
.
No CP, positive for SOB. No hematuria/dysuria. Positive for
hypoglycemia ( BS of 49 at home) with little PO intake.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Diarrhea: Patient had non-bloody diarrhea, with streaks of
blood on the toilet paper from known hemorroids.  Stool cultures
including C. Diff were all negative and diarrhea resolved
without further treatment over the course of this admission.
Flex sig was negative for evidence of C. Diff and KUB was
benign.
.
# Acute renal failure with secondary hyperparathyroidism:
Appeared entirely pre-reanl in the setting of diarrhea and
cirrhosis.  Creatinine improved with hydration.
Patient had marked hypocalcemia, hypomagneiumenia, and
hyperphosphatemia, all of which is attributable to ARF.  Calcium
was as low as 5.6 at one point, and was agressively repleted
with IV calcium.  Magnesium was repleted orally.
.
# Cirrhosis: Patient had significant ascites on exam.  Patient
had abdominal U/S and 3 liters were removed by parcentesis.  No
evidence of SBP but patient was placed on SBP prophylaxis.
Spironolactone was discontinued because of hyperkalemia.
.
# DMII:  Patient was initially peristently hypoglycemia with
blood sugars down to the 30's and 40's, in the setting of taking
oral diabetes medications (Metformin and Glyburdide) at home,
then having acute renal failure.  It took 3-4 days for the
medication to completely clear her system.  Patient was
temporarily transferred to the ICU for close monitoring and one
on one nursing care.  Patient was maintained on D10W and PO
intake with adequate control.  As the ARF improved, her sugars
came up and patient was then maintained on a insulin sliding
scale.
.
# Hypothyroidism: TSH was high and levothyroxine dose was
increased.  Will likely need to be re-checked and adjusted once
acute episode resolves.
.
# Blood loss anemia:  Patient is guiac positive.  She has known
vascular ectasias and is transfusion dependent to maintain her
hematocrit.  GI was consulted and in light of her history, they
did not feel repeat endoscopy would add anything to her care.
Patient recived periodic transfusions, and it was arranged for
her to continue to have outpatient transfusions after discharge.
.
# MRSA UTI: Culture poitive, patient started in 14 day course
ofVancomycin.
.
# Thrombocytopenia: Anti-heparin antibodies negative and
platelets improved when Protonix was discontinued.
.
#Aspiration: Patient was noted to be having difficulty
swallowing her medications and speech and swallow evaluation
followed by video swallow study was ordered.  Patient was seen
to have aspiration with thin liquids and she was transitioned to
ground solids with necatr thick-liquids to good effect.
