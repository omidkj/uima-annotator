Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3043**]
Chief Complaint:
Possible CSF Leak

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Lumbar Drain Placement [**2131-3-26**].


History of Present Illness:
This is a 78 year old patient that underwent a L4-L5 [**Location (un) **]
procedure and decompression of L5-S1 with repair of L [**4-9**]
meningocele and L5-S1 posterior stabilization with pedicle
screws on [**2131-3-20**].  Postoperatively the patient has been
experiencing severe headache that he describes as a level 9 on
[**1-14**] pain
scale.  The patient also reports minimal low back pain with
movement in bed at his incisional site. The patient denies
blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, weakness, numbness, tingling
sensation.

[**Hospital **] Hospital suspected a CSF leak and transferred the
patient here at the request of the patients daughter for further
care.

_______________________________________________________
IMAGING:
[**2131-3-25**] CXR
Apparent asymmetrical left apical thickening, difficult to
assess due to technical factors.
.
[**2131-3-26**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) **]
IMPRESSION:
1. There is a hyperintense fluid collection effacing the
posterior thecal sac at the levels of L4-S1. This likely
represents a CSF leak from a dural tear.
2. There is extension of the collection into the posterior
subcutaneous tissues via a small tract.
3. The fluid collection is most conspicuous on the T1
post-contrast images with minimal rim enhancement, but lack of
other typical features of abscess formation.
4. Multilevel degenerative changes and disc bulges with
narrowing of the neural foramina on the left side at L3-L4 and
on the right more than on the left at the level of L5-S1.
.
[**2131-3-28**] LENIs
IMPRESSION: No evidence of bilateral lower extremity DVT.
.
[**2131-3-28**] CT chest w/o contrast
IMPRESSION:
1. No apical mass. Small left apical nodule is likely scar, but
it should be monitored on followup CT recommended for multiple
subcentimeter nodules.
2. Moderate chronic bronchiectasis in the upper lobes. without
active
infection.
3. Moderate centrilobular emphysema with upper lobe
predominance.
4. Diffuse mild peripheral paraseptal changes, non-specific,
could represent paraseptal emphysema with wall inflammation or
very early form of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.
5. Small hiatal hernia. Status post cholecystectomy.
.
[**2131-3-28**] CT l spine
IMPRESSION:
1. Tiny 2 mm radiopaque focus, noted at the level of S1-2,
posteriorly along the left side likely subdural/epidural in
location. This most likely represents the fractured tip of the
prior lumbar drain.
2. Intact new lumbar drain noted, the tip at the level of L4 as
described above.
3. Multilevel degenerative changes with small amount of air as
described above in the anterior epidural space at L4 level,
which likely relate to the recent procedure along with
degenerative changes. Followup can be considered, to assess
resolution.
4. Postsurgical changes at L4, L5 and S1 levels. Limited
assessment of the intrathecal and neural structures as well as
posterior spinous soft tissues for fluid collections, etc. If
this information is desired, MR of the lumbar spine can be
considered if there is no contraindication.
5. Marked atherosclerotic vascular calcification involving the
abdominal aorta and its branches; small 5 mm intermediate signal
intensity focus in the left kidney medially, which needs further
evaluation with ultrasound. Other details as above.
6. Abnormal appearance of the left ilium, as described above.
Further
evaluation with PXR/CT Pelvis can be considered.
.
[**2131-3-31**] CXR
IMPRESSION: Small focal area of increased density at the right
base, which could represent pneumonia. Mild compression
deformity of a mid thoracic vertebral body, most likely old.
.
[**2131-4-1**] CT head w/o contrast
IMPRESSION:
1. No intracranial hemorrhage or edema. No fracture.
2. Paget's disease of the skull.
.
[**2131-4-2**] CT CHEst with contrast
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive pulmonary emboli involving lobar, subsegmental, and
subsegmental branches bilaterally. No secondary findings of
right heart strain.
2. New ground glass opacity and consolidation within the right
lower lobe, which may reflect an evolving infarct or pulmonary
hemorrhage.
3. Multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, without short interval
change from [**2131-3-28**].
4. Centrilobular emphysema with an upper lobe predominance.
5. Subpleural-based interstitial fibrosis predominantly within
the lower lobes.
.
[**2131-4-3**] ECHO
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Preserved global left ventricular systolic function.
Preserved right ventricular function. Mild aortic dilation. Mild
pulmonary hypertension.
.
[**2131-4-3**] CXR portable
In comparison with the study of [**3-31**], there is some continued
hyperexpansion of the lungs. Small areas of increased
opacification at the bases are again consistent with some
atelectasis and possibly small right effusion, though the right
costophrenic angle is more sharply seen. No evidence of vascular
congestion or acute focal pneumonia.
.
[**2131-4-3**] LENIs
1. No evidence of deep venous thrombosis involving the bilateral
lower extremity venous systems.
.
[**2131-4-4**]: CXR
As compared to the previous examination, there is unchanged
massive
pulmonary emphysema. The pre-existing minimal opacities at the
bases of the right lung are better visible than on the previous
examination, in case of persistent [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] atypically
distributed infectious process should be considered. No evidence
of pleural effusions. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. No
hilar or mediastinal abnormalities.

Brief Hospital Course:
Neurosurgical course summary:
Mr. [**Known lastname 2412**] was admitted to the NSurg service, where he was kept
HOB <30 degrees and on bedrest. The decision was made to place a
lumbar drain to enable and control the draining of the CSF.
This was done under interventional Radiology.  During the
procedure, the tip of the drain catheter broke off intradurally,
and was unable to be retrieved
