CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Confusion with right facial droop.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old
gentleman with a history of Parkinson's disease,
hypertension, previous right basal ganglion infarction in
[**2126**], who presented on [**2137-1-28**], after having an episode of
confusion and right facial droop in the setting of an
elevated systolic blood pressure of 220. The patient was
treated by his physician with Zestril with improvement of
these symptoms.

The morning of admission the patient developed a change in
his mental status with slurred speech and decreased
responsiveness.  He was again noted to have a right facial
droop and his systolic blood pressure was in the 200s.  He
was brought to the Emergency Department for further
evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Parkinson's disease.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Right hemicolectomy.
4.  Small bowel resection.
5.  Peptic ulcer disease.
6.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
7.  Macular degeneration.
8.  Prior right basal ganglion infarction in [**2126**].
9.  Paranoid delusions.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Paxil 5 mg q.d.
2.  Calcium Carbonate 650 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3.  Sinemet 25/100 two tablets p.o. q.6:00 a.m., 10:00 a.m.,
2:00 p.m., 6:00 p.m.
4.  Zestril 10 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
6.  Multivitamin.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a nursing home resident.  His
code status is DNR/DNI.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On general physical examination, the
patient was afebrile with a heart rate of 62, blood pressure
220/102, respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 98% in room
air.  His neck was supple without bruits.  His cardiovascular
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs,
rubs or gallops.  His lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally and his abdomen was benign.  Neurologic
examination demonstrated alternating level of alertness and
he was disoriented to place when asked to choose from a list.
He did not know the town but was aware of the state.  He was
not oriented to time including day of week and year.  He
followed simple commands inconsistently.  His attention was
poor and a slight right gaze preference was noted on
extraocular examination.  The pupils are equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation bilaterally.  He had a
mild right facial droop.  Spontaneous movements in his
extremities favored the use of his left arm.  He was able to
lift his right arm against gravity.  The patient withdrew
both legs to noxious stimuli but had minimal voluntary
movement.  Tone was slightly decreased in the right arm and
leg.  There was no evidence of cogwheel rigidity.  Reflexes
were also diminished in the right arm and leg.

LABORATORY DATA:  Electrocardiogram demonstrated slight ST
segment elevations in the anterior leads.  Magnetic resonance
scan demonstrated T2 hyperintensity in the left greater than
right corona radiata consistent with a watershed ischemic
infarction.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit for closer monitoring of
his ischemic cerebral infarction.

The patient's blood pressure was closely monitored and he was
maintained on Aggrenox for antiplatelet therapy.  A carotid
duplex was obtained and showed minimal right internal carotid
artery plaque.

On his second hospital day, the patient was noted to have a
decreased level of responsiveness.  He was described as not
opening his eyes to sternal rub.  A repeat CAT scan of the
brain was obtained which demonstrated evidence of his prior
infarction of the left corona radiata.  There was no acute
bleed or mass effect.

The patient was transferred to the Neurologic service on his
fourth hospital day and at that time would open his eyes to
voice but had no spontaneous verbal output and would not
follow commands.  Repeat magnetic resonance scan of the brain
was obtained that demonstrated a near complete left anterior
cerebral artery occlusion.  The patient's change in mental
status was attributed to abulia.

These findings were discussed with the patient's family
including the sister, the concern being that he would no
longer be capable of taking p.o. nutrition without the need
for a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.  His family
felt that the patient would not want to be dependent on tube
feeds in this manner and would prefer Hospice care.

The patient's code status was changed from DNR/DNI to comfort
measures only.  The patient is to be transferred back to his
nursing home facility of [**Hospital3 **] Center for
Hospice care.
