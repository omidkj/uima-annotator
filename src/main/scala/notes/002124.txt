History of Present Illness:
EU Critical [**Doctor Last Name **] ([**Numeric Identifier 101896**]) aka Ms. [**Known lastname 71492**]  ([**Numeric Identifier 101897**]) is a
[**Age over 90 **]
year-old woman with a history of a fib (coumadin discontinued),
remote right parietal +/- right cerebellar stroke, and
Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia who presented following a period
of unresponsiveness.
.
According to reports, the patient was last known well around 4pm
on the day of evaluation.  After enjoying lunch with her family,
she became "unresponsive."  Observers noted right eye deviation
before what sounds like horizontal nystagmus.  EMS was called.
Apparently concerned the abnormal eye movements represented
seizure, the patient was given ativan 2 mg IV x 1.  Blood
glucose
was 118.  To protect her airway, the patient was given succ. and
then intubated at the scene.  She was then transported to the
[**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and care.


Past Medical History:
Atrial fibrillation, no longer on Coumadin
Stroke with left sided deficit
Chronic kidney disease, stage III/IV, baseline Cr 1.5-1.8
Anemia of chronic disease
Systolic congestive heart failure, EF 45%
Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia



Social History:
She lives at home and son is in the house. He is a lawyer. She
has 2 daughters, one in [**Name (NI) 6624**] and one in [**Name (NI) 311**]. No alcohol or
current smoking. She was an Opera singer for more than 30 years
with the [**Location (un) 86**] pops. She played piano before her stroke. She
now uses one hand to play the piano.


Family History:

Wet Read: JKSd MON [**2150-2-9**] 7:47 PM
1. thrombus of left MCA and ACA with corresponding large infarct
of the
entire left MCA and ACA territory. No mismatch present on
perfusion between
CBV and CBF to suggest a penumbra. basilar artery patent. no
acute hemorrhage.


Final Report
EXAMINATION: CTA head and neck with CT perfusion of the brain.

INDICATION: Unresponsive.

COMPARISON: [**2150-2-9**] non-contrast head CT.

TECHNIQUE: Initially, non-contrast head CT was performed.
Subsequently,
contrast was administered intravenously and serial axial images
through the
head and neck were obtained in the arterial phase. CT perfusion
was also
performed of the brain as per protocol.

FINDINGS:

NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT:
There is a large infarction involving the left MCA and ACA
territories with
loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation, and diffuse edematous
changes with
effacement of adjacent sulci and of the left lateral ventricle.
In addition,
there is right parietal encephalomalacia, compatible with remote
infarct.
There is no evidence of hemorrhage.

CTA NECK:
The aortic arch has mild calcific arteriosclerosis with no
stenosis of the
great vessel origins. The right brachiocephalic, left common
carotid and left
subclavian have separate origins off the arch.

The bilateral common, external, and cervical right internal
carotid arteries
have regions of minimal calcific arteriosclerosis, but no
flow-limiting
stenosis. The vertebral arteries have no flow-limiting stenosis.
There is
mild calcific arteriosclerosis of the left vertebral artery
origin. The left
vertebral artery is dominant. The proximal left internal carotid
artery is
unremarkable. There is mild tapering of the left high cervical
internal
carotid artery.

CTA HEAD:
There is a thin linear filling defect within the petrous and
remaining
intracranial left internal carotid artery. This extends through
the carotid
siphons, the supraclinoid left carotid. The lumen of the
communicating segment
then quickly tapers with low-density filling defect extending
from the left
lateral wall, and occluding this vessel just proximal to its
bifurcation and
just distal to the left posterior communicating artery origin
which is pa
