Chief Complaint:
Bradycardia

right internal jugular line placement

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61yo male with a past medical history significant
for CAD s/p CABG in [**2102**], HIV, hepatitis B and C, who presented
to the ED with bradycardia to the 30s. The patient reports that
he was in his baseline state of health until about 24 hours
prior to admission, when he began to feel SOB. He also reports
that he had chest pressure for about the day prior to admission,
which was relieved with administration of oxygen in the
ambulance. The patient reports taht he has been eating a lot of
potatoe chips lately. He denies use of heroin and cocaine since
mid-[**Month (only) 359**]. Notably, the patient is somnolent and it is
difficult to obtain a throrough history although he does answer
questions appropriately. He denies cough, fevers, [**Month (only) 28877**], sore
throat, rhinorrhea, headache, ear pain, sick contacts. [**Name (NI) **] says
that he is able to walk down his hallway and is not able to walk
up stairs, limited by shortness of breath. He denies orthopnea.
He denies recent travel, no hiking and no tick bites.

In the ED, the patient was initially bradycardic to the 30s and
initially normotensive, but his pressures then dropped to
systolic 70s. Bedside ultrasound was performed which showed no
pericardial effusion and poor ventricular squeeze. Fingerstick
was 99. The patient was given atropine 1mg without change. There
was concern for beta blocker vs calcium channel  blocker
overdose and the patient was given glucagon 5mg PO with zofran.
The patient vomited in response. A cordis was placed in the RIJ
and a dopamine drip was started which increased her HR to 50s
and SBP to 100. A CXR revealed bilateral pleural effusions,
unable to exclude pna. The patient was started on broad spectrum
abx for presumed pna. The patient did receive about 1L of NS.
Throughout the patient's time in the ED, he was mentating well.

Labs are notable for creatinine 4.2 (baseline 1.5), troponin
0.03, lactate 3 and potassium 6.1 repeat K is 4.2.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or
red stools. He denies recent fevers, [**Name (NI) 28877**] or rigors. He denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

ECHO [**12-25**] The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF 65%). The right ventricular free wall
thickness is normal. The right ventricular cavity is dilated
with borderline normal free wall function. [Intrinsic right
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] There is abnormal septal
motion/position. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild to moderate
([**1-26**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
