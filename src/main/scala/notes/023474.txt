Chief Complaint:
Dizziness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Angiogram with aneurysm coil [**2189-3-20**]
Intubation


History of Present Illness:
66 year old female who reports dizziness since [**Month (only) 1096**]. She was
scheduled for a MRI today by her Primary Care physician to
further diagnose her dizziness and was found to have a large
vertebral artery aneurysm.  She presented today to the ED for
further workup and management. She reports seeing floaters in
her visual fields for the past few months and states that her
legs feel "heavier" or "weaker", but denies any recent falls,
use of cane or walker,or her legs giving out on her. She denies
bowel and bladder incontinence, numbness or tingling sensation,
other visual disturbance, nausea, vomiting, headache. She
reports a chronic productive cough.

Physical Exam:
Vitals: T99.9 BP 103/92 HR 94 RR 33 100% 40% FIO2
Gen: intubated, awake and alert, following commands, no acute
distress
Neck: supple, no JVD
CV: RRR, nl s1/s2, no appreciable murmur
Resp: vented breath sounds, decreased BS at bases, no wheezing
Abd: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no rebound or
guarding
Ext: warm, no edema


Pertinent Results:
CTA Head and Neck:
1. 3.2 cm extra-axial mass centered in the cerebello-pontine
cistern on the left avidly enhances following contrast
administration, and may originate from the proximal portion of
the left PICA (though not from the origin). Most likely, this
represents a giant aneurysm. However, given that it enhances
slightly less than blood pool, unusual appearance of a mass
lesion such as meningioma or other extra-axial neoplasm should
also be considered. MRI and angiography may be helpful for
further evaluation.
2. Emphysema.

ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-10mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 4 mmHg) due to mitral
annular calcification. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.


CT CHEST/ABDOMEN/PELVIS:
IMPRESSION:

1. Left upper pole homogeneously enhancing kidney lesion may
represent a
complicated cyst; however, further characterization of this cyst
with MRI is recommended to exclude cystic renal cell carcinoma.
2. Indeterminate left adrenal lesion likely represents adenoma.
This could be confirmed at the time of MRI.
3. Dilation of the hepatic ducts may be related to ampullary
stenosis or
reflect postsurgical change. MRI would be helpful to further
exclude a
malignancy.
4. Moderate emphysema.
5. Right lower quadrant lymph node and associated stranding are
nonspecific. They may relate to infectious process or recent
procedure. Clinical correlation is recommended.

[**2189-3-31**] MRI Abdomen:
1) Limited study due to limited breath-holding capacity and lack
of
intravenous gadolinium.
2) Left adrenal adenoma.
3) Left renal cyst in question appears completely simple, but
can be re-
assessed at the time of MRCP with intravenous gadolinium.
4) Mild bilie duct dilatation with the suggestion of some debris
within the common duct. Dedicated MRCP is recommended for
further assessment when the patient is able and an IV can be
placed.
5) Bibasilar consolidation and effusions, new compared to the CT
of [**2189-3-17**], likely secondary to aspiration.

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course:

Mrs. [**Known lastname 79193**] is a 66y/o F with a PMH of PVD s/p SMA stenting,
HTN, hyperlipidemia initially presenting on [**3-15**] after being
found to have an incidental unruptured 3X3X 2.5 cm left PICA
aneurysm identified on oupatient MRI for workup of dizziness.
She reported seeing floaters in her visual fields and leg
heaviness over the past few months. Denies falls, incontinence,
visual disturbance. CT Head and Neck demonstrated a 3.2 cm
extra-axial mass centered in the cerebello-pontine cistern on
the left, consistent with a giant aneurysm. HCT dropped to 21.6
on [**3-17**], med consult obtained and she was transfused 2U PRBC. CT
torso demonstrated several indeterminate lesions (L adrenal, L
kidney).  ECHO: EF >55%. She underwent coiling of the anuerysm
on [**3-20**]. She was placed on a heparin drip following the
procedure.  She had an episode of desaturation immediately after
extubation and received a bolus of Glycopyrrolate, and
Neostigmine for suspected residual paralysis. She developed a
slight worsening left sided weakness on [**3-21**] w/ right sided
sensory deficit, per nsurg c/w Wallenberg syndrome (lateral
medullary infarct).  Also developed a femoral hematoma, but
follow-up US without evidence of aneurysm or fistula. CT head
stable on [**3-22**]. Sputum was obtained on [**3-22**] given worsening
hypoxemia and thick secretions, grew Moraxella and ceftriaxone
was started.

During her first stay in the MICU, it was suspected that she was
having aspiration events. Passed bedside swallow eval, but due
to high suspicion for aspiration a barium swallow was performed
with aspiration of barium into the lungs. Antibiotics were
switched to Vanc/Zosyn and she required intubation for worsening
respiratory distress. A BAL was performed with washout of the
barium. She was extubated and transferred to floor on [**2189-3-29**].
On floor, she continued to be tenuous for a respiratory
perspective with high oxygen requirements. This was believed to
be multi-factorial from VAP, repeated aspiration events, poor
cough and baseline lung disease. A repeat speech and swallow
evaluation showed evidence of aspiration with deficits
consistent with neurological deficit and it was decided to
proceed with PEG tube placement on [**3-31**].  Following PEG
placement, she had an episode of acute desaturation on the floor
to 60% on NRB.  She was reintubated and retransferred to the
ICU.  Hypoxemia was most likely [**2-9**] mucous plugging given that
it resolved following ET suctioning.  She was extubated the
following morning however continued to require chest pt,
pulmonary toilet and significant supplemental O2.  She did have
several episodes of acute desaturation due to mucous plugging
which resolved with chest pt and suctioning.
