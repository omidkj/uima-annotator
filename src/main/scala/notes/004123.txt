Pertinent Results:
Conclusions
Prebypass

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the
results on [**2133-7-9**] at 900am.

Post bypass

Patient is in sinus rhythm and receiving an infusion of
phenylephrine. Biventricular systolic function is unchanged. 2+
mitral regurgitation persists. Aorta is intact post
decannulation.

Very poor transgastric views throughout the case.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted on [**7-9**] and underwent surgery with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 914**].Transferred to the CVICU in stable condition on titrated
phenylephrine and propofol drips. Postop right pneumothorax
necessitated right chest tube placement in ICU. Extubated on
morning of on POD #1. Left PICC placed for poor access on POD
#1. Gently diuresed toward his preop weight. Beta blockade
titrated. Transferred to the floor on POD #4 to begin increasing
his activity level. Evaluated by clinical nutrition for
diminished appetite which improved slowly over the course of his
stay.  Oral hypoglycemic agents were resumed with good glucose
control.  Oxygenation was an issue post-operatively and improved
with aggressive diuresis with sats 89% on room air. He does have
a history of obstructive sleep apnea on CPAP. A pulmonary
consult was obtained and it was recommended that he follow up
with his PCP to arrange [**Name Initial (PRE) **] sleep study as an outpatient. His last
sleep study was 2 years ago. He was noted to have a scant amount
of serosanguinous drainage from the lower aspect of his sternal
incision and was started on cipro (levaquin allergy) for 7 days.
He will return for a wound check this thursday unless there is
no drainage then he will return in the usual 2 week time period.
All othe rappointments were advised. He was discharged to home
on oxygen. He continued to make steady progress and was cleared
for discharge to home on POD# 10 with VNA services by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 914**].
