Chief Complaint:
Respiratory depression

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
46 yo man w/ h/o schizophrenia and bipolar disorder who presents
from rehab for altered mental status.  Reportedly, patient was
found by RN staff at rehab to be lethargic, sleeping all day.
RN staff commented that the patient appeared "drugged."  Per [**Hospital1 1501**]
staff, trazodone tabs were found on his floor.  Staff suspected
possible ingestion since this was not witnessed.  Only recent
changes in medication was increase in Neurontin recently from
300 to 600 mg TID. Patient had been living alone prior to an
admission to [**Hospital1 2177**] [**2-26**], but was transferred to rehab on
discharge.
.
In the ED, the patient was afebrile, satting in the 80's on room
air.  He was put on NRB, given narcan 4mg x 1, then 2mg x 1.
Head CT did not reveal bleed or mass effect, but showed lacunar
infarct in left putamen of unknown age.  Patient was very
lethargic and could not answer questions.  However, he was
oriented to place.  ABG was done: 7.18/78/125 on NRB.  Patient
was started on BiPAP in the ED.  Subsequently, the patient had
large volume non-bloody emesis.  Anesthesia was called and the
patient was intubated.

Pertinent Results:
Head CT ([**2152-8-24**]):
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
No evidence of mass effect is seen. No shift of normally midline
structures is seen. Note is made of oval-shaped low-density area
in the left putamen, probably representing a lacunar infarct of
unknown age. The surrounding soft tissue and osseous structures
are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Low-density area in the left putamen, probably
representing lacunar infarction of unknown age. For further
evaluation, please consider MRI with diffusion-weighted images.

EKG ([**2152-8-24**]):
Sinus tachycardia
Consider old septal infarct
Inferior and lateral ST-T wave changes may be due to myocardial
ischemia
No previous tracing for comparison

Brief Hospital Course:
46 yo man w/ h/o schizophrenia and bipolar disorder who presents
from rehab for altered mental status admitted to the MICU on
[**2152-8-24**] where he was treated for his altered mental status,
respiratory failure, and acute renal failure.  Workup for
altered mental status included workup for possible ingestion via
serum and urine tox screens, as well as a head CT. His urine tox
screen was positive for opiates but otherwise negative. His
serum to screen was negative tof ETOH and other substances. The
ICU team felt the most likely suspect for ingestion was
trazadone. They also felt it was possible that his recent
increase in neurontin may be causing excess sedation and this
was held.  The head CT scan revealed a lacunar infarct, which
was likely old and exam, was without focal neuro deficits. Over
his 2 day ICU course his somnolence improved.  He was also
evaluated by psychiatry who felt it was safe to restart his
psychiatric medications except for trazadone and neurontin.
.
In terms of his AMS: suspected ingestion; possibly trazodone or
other meds such as narcotics. may also be related to recent
increase in Neurontin dose from 300 --> 600 mg PO TID. H/o EtOH
but serum alcohol negative in ED. Tox screen positive for
opiates, but otherwise negative. Lacunar infarct on CT, likely
old, no focal neuro deficits. No longer somnolent. Per psych we
resumed psych meds, except trazodone and neurontin. Rehab may
resume neurontin at pt's original dose (300mg), but recommend
only if pt complains of LE pain.
.
In terms of his respiratory failure, the etiology was unclear.
[**Name2 (NI) **] was hypoxic on arrival to ED, put on NRB.  There was no
initial ABG, so it is difficult to assess the cause of his resp
distress.  Possibly hypoventilation from OD.  Eventually became
hypercarbic with ABG 7.18/78/125, which may have been due to CO2
retention on NRB.  Patient was placed transiently on BiPAP, and
required intubation after vomiting while on BiPAP.  Unclear
reason for CO2 retention, patient has h/o asthma but no clear
h/o COPD.  Likely [**2-23**] to obesity, possibly Pickwickian.  Likely
also has OSA. Pt extubated and weaned from sedation two days
ago. ABG off meds now demonstrates good pH and adequate
oxygenation. On transfer from ICU, patient with 100% oxygen
saturation on room air.
.
In terms of his acute on chronic renal failure, the patient was
resuscitated with IVF. His medications were renally dosed and
creatinine trended down. Creatine 3.5-->2.2-->1.8 across
[**Date range (1) 20341**]. (Note: Creatinine at day of discharge was 0.8.)
.
Patient then transferred to the floor where his overn
