Admission Date:  [**2176-7-19**]       Discharge Date:  [**2176-7-23**]


Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77-year-old man
with a history of hypertension, catheterization ten years ago
complicated by intracranial bleed, and a 120 pack-year
smoking history, who developed the acute onset of substernal
chest pain with shortness of breath, nausea, and diaphoresis
on the day of admission.  He was taken to [**Hospital3 3583**]
where he was found to have ST elevations in electrocardiogram
leads V2-V6, I, II, and AVF.  He was brought via [**Last Name (un) **]-Flight
to [**Hospital6 256**] for primary
angioplasty.  On catheterization, he had elevated filling
pressures with pulmonary artery systolic of 37, diastolic of
21, and mean of 29.  He was found to have right dominance.
His left main was normal.  Proximal LAD had a 30% stenosis.
Mid LAD had 100% stenosis.  Left circumflex had no disease.
Proximal right coronary artery had 30% stenosis.  Mid right
coronary artery had 60% stenosis.  The mid LAD lesion was
stented with mild impingement of D1 at the origin.  He
received Lasix 20 mg in the lab.  Integrilin was deferred
secondary to history of hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident.
He was then admitted to the CCU in stable condition for
continued management.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  On admission temperature
was 97.9??????, blood pressure 112/54, pulse 89, respirations 19,
oxygen saturation 96% on 4 L nasal cannula.  General:  He was
alert and oriented times three.  He was in no acute distress.
He was pain free.  HEENT:  There was no jugular venous
distention present.  No bruits.  There were 2+ carotid pulses
bilaterally.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Heart:  Regular, rate and rhythm.  S1 and S2.  There was a 1
out of 6 systolic ejection murmur.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Active bowel sounds.  Extremities:
Right pressure dressing intact.  No discomfort or hematoma in
groin.  Distal pulses 2+ bilaterally.  No edema present.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission white count was 13.7,
hematocrit 28.1; CHEM7 within normal limits; coags with an
INR of 1.3, PTT 95.1; CK initially 219, peaked to 3611, the
second cycle of CKs with a MB fraction of 518, troponin
8.0-12.4, and the rest of the admission laboratories were not
of noted.

Electrocardiogram on admission revealed normal sinus rhythm
at 88 beats per minute, normal axis and intervals, marked ST
elevation in the anterior precordium, V2-V6, lead I, II, and
AVF.  After stenting, there was partially normalizing of the
ST elevations, new Q-waves and loss of R-wave in V2 and V3.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted and ruled in for
myocardial infarction by enzymes and by electrocardiogram.
The enzymes peaked at 3611 on the 10th and continued to
decrease on that day until the day of discharge.  The patient
diuresed well on Lasix.  Captopril was added for afterload
reduction and to decrease mortality.  Plavix and Aspirin were
added status post myocardial infarction, as well as because
of the stent placement.  Lopressor was added because of
beta-blocker favorable affects on mortality.  The patient was
also given subcue Heparin and Zantac for prophylaxis.

The patient developed hemoptysis with brown sputum, slightly
blood tinged on day #2 of admission.  This continued but
decreased throughout the rest of his hospital stay.  The
patient was covered with Levaquin initially for community
acquired pneumonia.  The patient's temperature spiked to
104.2?????? on this regimen, and was switched to Ceftriaxone and
Azithromycin; however, the patient spiked a temperature to
103.2??????.  At that point, the patient was switched to Levaquin,
Flagyl and received one dose of Vancomycin, at which point
the patient defervesced.

An abdominal CT scan was also done which was negative for
intra-abdominal abscess; however, it did reveal right middle
lobe pneumonia which had also been seen on earlier chest
x-rays.  Also urinalysis revealed probably urinary tract
infection which was felt to be treated on the Levaquin, and
an electrocardiogram revealed possible V5 ST elevation, which
would have been a new finding compared with previous
electrocardiograms.  However, because of a lack of increase
in the CK or the CKMB fraction, this was felt to be
noncontributory.  The patient's remaining course was
insignificant.

DISPOSITION:  Stable for discharge.

DISCHARGE PLAN:  He is to be discharged to home with VNA
nursing, possibly home Physical Therapy.  He will most likely
have home oxygen.  He is to have cardiac rehabilitation in
[**3-15**] weeks.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Levaquin 500 mg p.o. q.d. to finish
off a 10-day course, Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. to finish a
10-day course, Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d. to finish a 30-day
course, Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., Lopressor will be switched
to Atenolol, Captopril will be switched to Univasc,
Phenobarbitol 60 mg p.o. t.i.d., Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.h.s.

The patient will not receive any antibiotics as an
outpatient.
FOLLOW-UP:  He will follow-up with his primary care
physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 3**] well as his cardiologist.
