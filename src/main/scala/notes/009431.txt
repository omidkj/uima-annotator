Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1561**]
Chief Complaint:
69 yo female w/ respiratory condition has deteriorated and
now she suffers from multiple recurrent pulmonary infections
and severe dyspnea on exertion. After full pulmonary w/u she was
found to have TBM which responded to stenting therefore she was
admitted to proceed w/ tracheoplasty.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
tracheoplasty


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a delightful 69-
year-old lifelong nonsmoker who suffered from respiratory
problems including bronchiectasis for the past 17 years. She
has undergone a right lower lobectomy 11 years for
bronchiectasis with some improvement for several years.
Unfortunately her respiratory condition has deteriorated and
now she suffers from multiple recurrent pulmonary infections
and severe dyspnea on exertion. She has undergone a full
investigation of her tracheobronchomalacia including a
stenting trial and had an excellent result. CT scan and
pulmonary function test demonstrated good underlying lung
parenchyma function. Given these findings and an excellent
response to the stenting trial, it was felt that she was a good
candidate for tracheobronchoplasty with mesh.

and increased interstitial markings; however, hemorrhage or
mediastinitis should be excluded. No pneumothorax.
