Admission Date:  [**2134-7-9**]       Discharge Date:  [**2134-7-14**]


Service:  CCU

REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Substernal chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 82-year-old gentleman
with aortic valve replacement (St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**]), rheumatic heart
disease and mitral stenosis with an ejection fraction of 50%,
atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, who awoke on the day of
admission with substernal chest pain approximately [**7-8**].  He
presented to the emergency room at an outside hospital where
an EKG showed 1-[**Street Address(2) 1766**] elevations laterally in 1, L, V5
through V6 with concomitant ST depressions in the inferior
leads.  The cardiology service was consulted and while
evaluating the patient he was noted to go into polymorphic
ventricular fibrillation.  Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was
begun and the patient was shocked at 360 joules.  He then
became bradycardic, was given atropine 1 mg and an amiodarone
drip was started and the patient was taken emergently to the
Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory.  In the catheterization
laboratory the patient was found to have normal left main,
normal left anterior descending coronary artery, and a 20%
proximal left circumflex coronary artery.  Of note, there was
also an obtuse marginal #1 with very distal thrombotic
occlusion with TIMI 1 flow.  The patient had a normal right
coronary artery.  He was taken to the coronary care unit for
monitoring.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for diaphoresis, nausea,
vomiting or palpitations.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Aortic valve replacement (St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**]
placed in [**2114**]).  2. Rheumatic heart disease with moderate to
severe mitral stenosis.  3. Echocardiogram of [**2134-3-30**]
demonstrating an ejection fraction of 50%.  4. Atrial
fibrillation on Coumadin with previous cardioversion attempts
in 06/99 and [**7-30**].  The patient had been switched from
sotalol to atenolol for the past year.  5. Asthma.  6. HCV,
chronic.  7. Hypertension.  8. Hypercholesterolemia.  9.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to amiodarone, reaction
unknown.

30 q.d.  3. Procardia XL 30 q.d.  4. Coumadin.  5. Albuterol
two puffs b.i.d.  6. Flovent 10 mcg b.i.d.  7.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Remote history of cigarette smoking.  No
alcohol use, no drug use.  The patient is a [**Street Address(1) 8901**] clerk.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for a brother with emphysema.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission temperature was 98, blood
pressure 137/72, heart rate 68 and regular, respiratory rate
12, breathing at 95% on a shovel mask.  General:  No apparent
distress, lying on back with shovel mask.  HEENT:  Five cm of
jugular venous distension, pupils equal and reactive to light
and accommodation.  Oropharynx was negative.  Cardiovascular:
Regular rate with a 2/6 systolic murmur without radiation,
nondisplaced point of maximal impulse, no carotid bruits
auscultated.  Pulmonary:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities:  No
cyanosis, clubbing or edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis and radial
pulses bilaterally.  Neurological:  Examination was nonfocal.
Skin:  Examination showed a groin incision which was clean,
dry and intact without hematoma.

LABORATORY DATA/STUDIES:  Echocardiogram in [**2133-3-30**] shows
an ejection fraction of 50-55% with moderate left ventricular
hypertrophy, moderate to severe MS.  The white count on
admission was 9.1, hematocrit  38.1, platelet count 183,
sodium 140, potassium 3.2, chloride 101, bicarbonate 25, BUN
31, creatinine 1.3, glucose 143, CK 210, MB 5, troponin less
than .01.  A repeat echocardiogram showed an ejection
fraction of 20%, aortic valve normal, prosthetic mitral valve
1+ MR, left atrium was dilated, left ventricle showed severe
hypokinesis, right ventricle was dilated.  The
catheterization report is as above.  The chest x-ray showed
congestive heart failure, mild.  An EKG showed atrial
fibrillation at 65 beats per minute with normal intervals, ST
elevations in 1, L, V5 through V6, approximately 1-2 mm; ST
depressions in leads 2 and 3.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the coronary
care unit for observation.  His CKs were cycled.  The patient
was placed on telemetry and serial EKGs were performed.

1. Status post ventricular fibrillation arrest:  The patient
was continued on an amiodarone drip in the coronary care unit
at 1 mg per minute, then decreased to 0.5 mg per minute due
to bradycardia (heart rate in the 40s to 50s) and an episode
of hypotension with systolic blood pressure in the 80s.  On
[**2134-7-11**] the patient was switched to p.o. amiodarone [**Company 8902**].i.d.  On [**2134-7-13**] the patient's amiodarone was
discontinued.

2. Distal obtuse marginal #1 lesion:  The patient's distal
obtuse marginal #1 lesion was thought to be embolic in origin
secondary to being off of Coumadin in anticipation of a
prostate biopsy.  A transthoracic echocardiogram was
performed on [**2134-7-13**] which demonstrated an ejection fraction
of 35%, mildly dilated left atrium, decreased atrial velocity
with a mechanical aortic valve, mitral stenosis, global left
ventricular hypokinesis, rheumatic mitral disease with no
thrombus.

3. Anticoagulation:  The patient was anticoagulated in the
setting of atrial fibrillation and left ventricular
hypokinesis.  His Coumadin dose was titrated to an INR of
[**2-1**].  The heparin drip was overlapped with Coumadin and was
discontinued on the day of discharge at which time the
patient's INR was 2.5.

4. Post myocardial infarction:  The patient was put on a post
myocardial infarction regimen of aspirin, beta blockers,
statin and ACE inhibitor.

5. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma:  The
patient's clinical findings of wheezing gradually improved
over the course of his hospital stay on metered dose inhalers
and nebulizers.  The patient's oxygen requirement decreased
and on the day of discharge the patient was breathing at 98%
on room air and his physical examination was remarkable for
the absence of crackles or wheezing.

6. Bradycardia:  The patient did have any episode of
bradycardia to the 40s to 50s, during which time he was
symptomatic and resolved spontaneously.

7. Cardiac enzymes:  The patient's CK dropped from a maximum
of 1,412 to 187.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  On the day of discharge the patient's
blood pressure is 112/62 with a heart rate of 72, breathing
at 98% on room air.  The patient was asymptomatic with no
events on telemetry.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Posterior/lateral myocardial infarction.
2. Atrial fibrillation.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 325 mg, one p.o. q.d.
2. Protonix 40 mg tablets, p.o. q.d.
3. Atorvastatin 10 mg, one p.o. q.d.
4. Fluticasone propionate 110 mcg aerosolized, two puffs
b.i.d.
5. Ipratropium bromide 0.2 mg per mL inhalation q. 6.
6. Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d.
7. Coumadin 2.5 mg alternating with 3.75 mg q.o.d.
8. Albuterol 90 mcg aerosolized, 1-2 puffs q. 4-6 hours
p.r.n.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  The patient was discharged home with a
visiting nurse.  He was advised to take his medications as
prescribed and to return to the Emergency Department or call
911 with fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, chest discomfort,
shortness of breath, bloody stools, worsening cough, or any
