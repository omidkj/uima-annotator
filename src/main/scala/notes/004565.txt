Chief Complaint:
Left hand numbness, tingling, weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ligation L AV graft


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 49 y/o female with diabetes mellitus s/p
cadaveric renal transplant [**12-7**] who presented for ligation of a
left upper extremity graft that had caused her to experience
left hand numbness, tingling, and weakness and subsequently
became acutely hypoxic in the PACU.  In the PACU, her oxygen
saturation dropped to 68% on room air, but increased into the
90s with oxygen supplementation via nasal canula and deep
breathing.  ECG obtained in the PACU showed sinus rhythm with no
ST segment changes.  Chest x-ray showed congestive heart
failure.  A VQ scan showed no evidence of PE.  The patient
denied any lightheadedness, dizziness, shortness of breath,
chest pain, or palpitations.  The patient currently smokes a
pack of cigarettes every 2 days.  She also denies fever, chills,
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or dysuria.

Past Medical History:
1. ESRD s/p cadaveric renal transplant [**12-7**]
2. Diabetes mellitus with diabetic retinopathy
3. Hepatitis virus C
4. osteoporosis
5. h/o left arm AV fistula
6. hysterectomy

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted for her hypoxia and monitored.  It was
unclear why the patient suddenly became hypoxic from her
congestive heart failure during the operation or in the interval
following her operation as she only received 200cc of
crystalloid during the AV fistula ligation and her oxygen
saturation was 98% on room air pre-operatively.  Cardiac enzymes
were negative.  The following day, the patient was administered
lasix for diuresis and encouraged to perform incentive
spirometry, but continued to require supplemental oxygen.  A
chest CT scan was obtained which showed:
 1. Soft tissue mass in the anterior mediastinum, which is
highly suspected to be thymoma. Further evaluation with MRI is
recommended for better characterization of these findings.
2. There are multiple areas of discoid atelectasis.
3. Cardiomegaly.
The findings on the CT scan did not clarify the reason for the
patient's gross hypoxia.
An transthoracic echocardiogram was performed which showed
normal EF.  The patient continued to remain hypoxic on room air
and was discharged with supplemental oxygen.  She will follow up
with Pulmonary in regards to her hypoxia.

Thoracic surgery consult was obtained for the patient's thymoma
and she will follow up with that service as an outpatient.

Prograf levels were checked on a daily basis and dosed
accordingly.

At the time of discharge, the patient was able to ambulate on
supplemental oxygen without symptoms and was tolerating a
regular, diabetic diet well.  Her initial symptoms of left hand
numbness, tingling, and weakness had also improved after they
surgery.
