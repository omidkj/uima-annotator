History of Present Illness:
HPI: Patient is a 84 y/o F with a history of CAD, s/p CABG and
PCI in [**2-20**] on [**Date Range 4532**], HTN, DM II, and dyslipidemia who was
initially was brought to the ED by her granddaughter who noted
the patient having slurred speech earlier this evening.  The
patient herself thought she felt "funny" in the face.  While in
the ED, the patient was promptly evaluated for possible CVA, and
after returning from CTA of the head and neck, acutely become
dyspneic with RR to the 30's, complained of feeling SOB, and was
noted to be hypoxic to 93% on RA (from 98% on RA).  This
occurred while the patient moved from a sitting to a standing
position.  She denied any CP, N/V, diarphoresis, jaw pain, arm
pain, lightheadedness or dizziness during the episode.  Repeat
CXR showed interval development of worsening bibasilar
interstitial edema pattern concerning for flash pulmonary edema.

  Earlier this morning, the patient complained of feeling
generalied fatigue, and an overall decrease in energey level,
which was new since the day prior.  Given her symptoms, she
measured her BP at home which was 105/50.  Apparently, the
patient frequently develops fatigue and has a history of labile
BP's at home - often low in the AM, and higher in the evening.
Given her low BP, the patient did not take her antihypertensive
medication this morning (atenolol).  At that time she denied any
CP, palpitations, SOB, N/V, and drank some herbal tea which made
her feel better.  Later that evening, the patient's granddauther
was visiting and thought she noticed her grandmother having
slurred speech with trouble enunciating her words, as well L
sided facial paralysis.  The patient said she did not notice any
trouble with her speech, and thought nothing was abnormal,
except for a slight "funny" sensation throughout her face.  In
the ED, the pt was noted to possibly have a  L sided pronator
drift on exam, and given her symptoms, was evaluated by
neurology for a possible acute CVA.  Preliminary report of the
non-contrast head CT shows no acute CVA, and a 50% stenosis of
the right carotid bifurcation.


ROS: No fevers/chills/night sweats, nausea/vomiting, no cough,
sputum production, abdominal pain, change in urine appearance,
dysuria, hematuria, diarrhea, melena, or hematochezia, +
occasional calf cramps, + mild left upper extremity weakness

Brief Hospital Course:
 In the ED, the patient's initial vitals were, T 97.9 , HR 70 ,
BP 218/63 . RR 20 , O2: 98% RA.  After developing acute SOB, the
patient's RR increased to 36, and her O2 sat dropped to 93% RA.
Given her CXR findings, the patient was given a dose of IV Lasix
and started on a Nitroglycerin gtt following her dyspnea and CP.
 The first set of cardiac enzymes were flat.  A trial of Bi-pap
was initiated, but was not tolerated well by the patient.  The
patient was then placed on a non re-breather mask with
improvement in her symptoms as well as her oxygenation.

  On admission to the MICU, the patient is comfortable, she is
no longer complaining of dyspnea or chest pain. Nitro gtt was
d/c'ed in the ER prior to transfer to the MICU given BPs of
111/52.  Goal SBP of 140 given possible CVA.  The patient
diuresed approx 1 Liter since recieving the IV Lasix.  Vitals on
arrival were: T-96, BP 116/79, HR 69, RR 21, O2: 95% RA

Acute pulmonary edema
Etiology likely related to hypertension and labile blood
pressures, especially given systolic BP's in 110's in ED. Given
the timing of acute dyspnea after CTA of head and neck, contrast
reaction a possibility, but unlikely given resolution of
symptoms shortly after control of BP and diuresis w/Lasix.  BNP
was elevated to 1700 suggesting that pt. had some acute
decompensated heart failure, likely due to her labile blood
pressure. Her blood pressure stabilized around SBP 120's and pt.
was transferred to the floor where she remained stable.
.
Hypertensive urgency
Likely contributed to development of acute pulmonary edema, and
possibly even neurologic symptoms upon presentation to ED as
well. Given labile blood pressures and history of PVD and CAD,
renal artery stenosis was considered but renal u/s was negative.
Pt briefly on nitro gtt for BP control. Her lisinopril was d/c'd
because of concern for renal artery stenosis and her blood
pressures in the 110s on the floor.
.
Stroke
Slurred speech and facial paralysis noted by family. Pt seen and
evaluated by neurology in ED, s/p CTA of head and neck. Symptoms
seem to have resolved since initial presentation. But Pt. still
has slight L facial droop more than 24 hours later. L sided mild
hand weakness was not appreciated on reexamination on [**8-9**]. CTA
head and neck showed 50% stenosis of R carotid artery, but no
acute defect. Neurology wanted a f/u MRI but Pt. left AMA before
this could occur. Pt. was advised that she could still be at
increased risk and that she could die or have a recurrent stroke
if she left, but stated that her husband had just died at [**Hospital1 18**]
and it was extremely distressing for her to be here.
.

CAD
Currently pt denies any symptoms of chest pain, chest pressure
or discomfort. Given recent acute pulmonary edema, pt ruled out
w/ 3 sets of enzymes not trending up. No change in EKG.

DM II  Remained Diet controlled, BG well controlled during
admission.
.
Hypothyroidism: Continued home synthroid dose, TSH 1.3
Glaucoma : continued Xalatan and Trusopt eye drops, pt. had no
eye complaints.
