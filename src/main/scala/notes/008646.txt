Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins / Sulfa (Sulfonamides)

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1257**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left Thoracentesis [**3-29**]


History of Present Illness:
59 y/o F referred by [**Hospital 100**] Rehab for acute kidney injury and
concern for CHF exacerbation. Patient was evaluated at [**Hospital 100**]
Rehab by nephrology due to increasing creatinine ([**2118-3-25**] 2.6
now 3.9) and recommended general work-up for renal failure.
Recently patient also developed low grade fevers and increased
eryhtema of her right heel - ID was consulted and started on IV
Abx (Cipro, Flagyl, Vanco) for concern of osteomyletis based on
supportive x-ray (per report). She was scheduled for CT scan
this Wednesday. Patient being aggressively diuresised, given 120
mg IV lasix prior to transfer. Weight stable 78 kg past week
despite aggressive diuresis.

[**Name (NI) **] husband concerned regarding increasing cough, laboured
breathing and worsening edema. No chest pain. Per husband her
mental status has been her baseline. She has not been sleeping
for the past 72 hours.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 98.1 P 93 BP 178/82 R 22 O2 sat
100% NRB. During ED patient's oxygenation improved to high
90s-100% on 2 L. Patient was given 2 baby [**Name (NI) **]. During stay
patient became progressively somnolent and is being admitted to
the MICU for altered mental status.

Of note, patient had recent admission [**2118-2-22**] to [**2118-3-11**] for
delirium work-up. During hospital stay patient had mutiple
episodes of hallucinations/agitation/anxiety with intermittent
lucidity. Felt to be secondary to recent hosptialization, poor
PO intake, and at least five psychiatric medications, all in the
setting of a poor substrate (i.e. Hypoxic Brain Injury),
however, pt's baseline is alert and oriented x3 and highly
functioning. B12/folate/RPR wnl. TSH was
high, but on synthroid, and unclear how to interpret while
hospitalized. OSH records indicating ?thalamic stroke were
obtained, and read by [**Hospital1 18**] radiologist who said that in the
setting of a noncontrast study, not ideal study, but nothing to
suggest acute thalamic stroke. Psychiatry, Neurology, and
Geriatrics followed her case closely while she was hosptialized.
Patient was tried on depakote (stopped because LFT's began to
trend up after having previously normalized in the setting of
stoping mexilitine), and a trial of low-dose seroquel
(ultimately not effective enough). Patient was eventually tried
on [**Hospital1 **] with close monitoring of the QTc.

STUDIES:
CXR [**2118-3-28**]: Hazy right base opacity concerning for
consolidation and acute
infectious process. Prominence of the hilum may relate to
vascular
engorgement.
.
NCHCT [**2118-3-28**]: No acute intracranial process.
.
TTE [**2118-3-29**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild to
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
focal hypokinesis of the mid to distal anterior wall, lateral
wall, apex, and distal inferior wall. The remaining segments
contract normally (LVEF = 35-40 %). The diameters of aorta at
the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**2-5**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate regional left vent
