Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 826**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia/tachypnea, fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left subclavain line

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 349**] is a 75yo woman with h/o ESRD on HD, DM2, CHF,
afib and CAD who presented to the ER today from her NH with
complaint of fever to 103.8, chills, diaphoresis and confusion.
On arrival to the ER she was found to have temp 101.0, HR 126,
bp 180/86, and to be satting 82% on RA which improved to mid-90s
on 4LNC.  Chest XR showed continued and possibly increased R
pleural effusion.  She complained of midl abdominal pain, and CT
abd/pelvis was unremarkable except for known enlarged
gallbladder.  She was given 1LNS, vanco and levo and was sent to
HD where they were able to remove 1.2L.  While at HD, the
patient spontaneously desaturated to the 80s on 4LNC and
required 50% face mask to regain sats of the mid-90s.  ABG at
that time showed 7.36/58/271.  Stat CXR showed R pleural
effusion but no clear pna.  She received nebs and zosyn and was
transferred to the MICU for further care.
.
In the MICU the patient had a bedside ultrasound to evaluate her
effusion which showed no safe area for diagnostic tap.  After a
few hours in the MICU she dropped her pressures to as low as
sbp78. She was given 1500cc total of NS. Central line was placed
in a sterile fashion (LIJ) and she was started on levophed.  Her
blood cultures returned 4/4 bottles GPC in clusters.

Past Medical History:

infection (attempted tap x 3 without success, on fourth attempt
were able to remove 200cc only)

ECHO:   [**2114-11-14**]
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is
elongated.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic
(EF>75%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6.There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
Impression:  No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis seen.

CXXR [**2114-11-14**]
IMPRESSION: No change is demonstrated in large right pleural
effusion and atelectasis of the right lower lobe. An infectious
process cannot be excluded.
The left lung is unremarkable. The left subclavian line tip
terminates in the left brachiocephalic vein.

Brief Hospital Course:
#MRSA sepsis:  Pt was admitted to the MICU and started on
vancomycin and zosyn for antibiotic coverage.  Once
sensitivities returned as MRSA, the zosyn was discontinued.  Her
blood pressures were low on initial presentation so the patient
was given bolus IV fluids and levophed.  Her CVP was maintained
above 8.  She was eventually weaned off of the levophed.  An
extensive workup for the source of infection was limited by
patient's wishes.  She had a TTE which was negative but refused
an MRI of the spine.  The patient was afebrile during the ICU
course.  Surveillance cultures were negative after [**2114-11-14**].
She will receive long duration therapy with 6wks of Vancomycin
to cover for osteomyelitis, as she has had this in the past.
Her most recent vanco level was pending at time of discharge.
.
#Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia:  The patients platlet count
continued to fall during her ICU stay.  Heparin products were
held and sent off HIT Ab labs which eventually came back
positive.  Her central line was also discontinued which was
pre-treated with heparin.
.
#ESRD:  The patient has ESRD and received dia
