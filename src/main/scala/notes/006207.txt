Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status and melena

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
esophageogastroduodenoscopy [**2158-9-1**], esophageogastroduodenoscopy
[**2158-9-5**], colonoscopy [**2158-9-11**]


History of Present Illness:
88 year old male with recent gastrointestinal bleeds attributed
to gastric ulcer, status post mechanical aortic valve
replacement on Coumadin, chronic kidney disease, history of
NSTEMI in [**7-11**], with altered mental status and a hematocrit drop
from his baseline of 30 to 20 after being transferred to a new
long term care facility. He was found to be dizzy, confused, and
weak to the point where he could not stand up. He is not
demented at baseline per the family, but today he was exhibiting
extensive mental slowing. His blood pressure was 100/60 with a
heart rate of 60 and his Hgb=6.7, HCT=20.9. Prior Hgb [**8-8**] was
10.7. He used to get his care at [**Hospital3 **] and presented
[**7-11**] with altered mental status and anemia in the setting of a
GI bleed. He was also seen [**6-10**] for anemia in setting of
supratherapeutic INR.

In the ED, initial VS: 97.5, 93, 123/67, 99% 3L. EKG shows right
bundle branch block and left ventricular hypertrophy which was
unchanged. His stools were guaiac positive and he has a sacral
decubitus ulcer. His Coumadin was not reversed and he was
ordered 1 unit of blood, but could not receive it because he has
antibodies that need to be screened for. He received PO
Protonix.

On the floor, the patient had active melena(about 7 pm) which
given his anticoagulation status and difficulty with blood
products was felt to require intensive care monitoring. He was
transferred to the MICU.

Social History:
He was born in NY and has been a book binder all of his life. he
moved to [**Location (un) 86**] to be closer to his son. [**Name (NI) **] does not smoke or
drink currently. He was just transferred to [**Hospital 100**] rehab, but
also lived at the [**Hospital3 **]. His brother recently died. He
requires a significant degree of assistance in all his ADLs and
IADLs.

.
Blood smear without large amount of hemolysis
.
EKG: sinus with atrial ectopic foci, vs. ectopic atrial rhythm,
RBBB, 1st (present on EKG at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab), 1st degree AV block,
no signs acute ischemia
.
EGD [**2158-9-1**]: Small hiatal hernia ,Normal stomach. No fresh or
old blood seen. A single 8mm non-bleeding polyp was found in the
second part of the duodenum.  Otherwise normal EGD to third part
of the duodenum

CXR [**2158-9-2**]: no acute infiltrate, possible [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1915**] and mild
vascular congestion, costophrenic angles clears
.
ECHO [**2158-9-4**]: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with overall low normal left ventricular
systolic function. LVEF 50-55%. Mechanical AVR with normal
gradients. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid

Colonscopy [**2158-9-11**]: Stool was found in the cecum, ascending

visualization of the colon- especially the right colon. Small
polyps and flat lesions could have easily been missed. No large
lesion noted

Brief Hospital Course:
88 year old male with mechanical aortic valve on warfarin and hx
of gastric ulcer who presented with melena and altered mental
status.
.
# GI bleed: Patient was admitted to the floor on [**2158-8-30**] but
transferred to the MICU due to melena and low blood pressure.
Patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells and 2 units
of fresh frozen plasma. Hematocrit bumped from 22 to 28. Patient
was started on proton pump inhibitor drip and transferred to
floor after stabilization of hematocrit and vital signs. EGD on
[**2158-9-1**] was negative for source of bleeding. Patient was started
on heparin drip and developed recurrent bouts of hematemesis.
Patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**2158-9-2**] and received 1
unit of packed red blood cells on [**2158-9-3**] for a hematocrit down
to 28.3 from 34. Patient developed atrial fibrillation with
rapid ventricular response. He was started on metoprolol 5mg IV
every six hours with resolution of atrial fibrillation.
Hematocrit was stabilized in the mid 30s. On [**2158-9-5**] patient
underwent a second EGD which was again negative for active upper
gastrointestinal bleed. Patient was restarted on intravenous
proton pump inhibitor. On [**2158-9-7**] pt was transferred back to
the floor. Heparin drip was started on [**9-9**] and discontinued on
[**9-10**] hours prior to placement of nasogastric tube for bowel
prep. Colonoscopy on [**2158-9-11**] was limited by poor prep. However,
no source of bleeding was identified. Patient was bridged to
coumadin with heparin drip after colonscopy. By discharge, his
hematocrit was stable in the high 20s with no sign of active
bleeding. He is to follow up with GI as outpatient when a
capsule endoscopic study will be considered.
.
# Aortic valve replacement with mechanical valve [**2151**]: Given
acute gastrointestinal bleeds with anticoagulation, warfarin was
held until colonoscopy was conducted. Warfarin 3.5mg daily was
started on [**2158-9-12**] with heparin bridge.  INR at discharge was
2.5. Heparin drip was discontinued.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: with one episode of rapid ventricular
response that resolved with metoprolol IV and amiodarone drip.
At discharge patient's heart rate was stable.
.
# Chronic diastolic heart failure: Echo on [**2158-9-4**] showsed
ejection fraction of 50%. On furosemide (20mg daily)at home,
which was held given gastrointestinal bleed. Patient was
significantly edematous. Patient was diuresed with 20mg IV
furosemide from [**9-13**] to [**9-15**] with significant improvement in
edema. Creatinine level rose but plateaued at 1.4. Home dose of
furosemide was held at discharge and could be restarted once
cr
