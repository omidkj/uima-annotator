History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 15499**] is a 65 y.o. F s/p liver [**Known lastname **] in [**2196-6-5**] for
primary biliary cirrhosis, now admitted for hypotension, near
syncope, vomiting, and hypothermia. The patient is not a good
historian, but she reports that she went to a coffee shop today
before she wanted to run some errants. In the coffee shop she
started to feel fatigued, lightheaded and weak. She went to the
bathroom, but had trouble to get up from the toilet. She then
walked out of the bathroom and asked for help. She reports
vomiting only if she gets probed about it and reports nausea
preceeding the vomiting. She states that she vomits bilious
vomitus about once daily. She denies any blood in her vomitus.
She also reports intermittent abdominal pain in her lower
abdomen, that she associates with Lactulose intake. The patient
reports that she might have missed some of her Lactulose and
immunosupressive medications.
.
Of note, she has been recently hospitalized twice in [**8-13**] and
[**11-13**] for hepatic encephalopathy.
.
In the ED, VS: 96.6 78 109/56, initially. Pt then became
hypothermic with a temperature to 34.8 rectally. Her pressure
continued to rise and was 186/83 on discharge from the ED.
The patient received cefepime, vancomycin, and dexamethasone.
Urine culture and blood cultures were sent. A CXR showed no
evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process. Preliminary results
of a CT torso showed no evidence of a septic source or other
etiology for deompensated status; few nonspecific ground glass
foci in the right lung with a large amount of fluid in the
esophagus to level of thoracic inlet. She was also evaluated by
[**Month/Year (2) **] surgery, which did not feel that there was anything
acute to recommend or intervene upon.
.
Currently, Ms. [**Known lastname 15499**] feels fine and has no particular
complaints.
.
ROS: Denies CP, SOB, arthralgias, myalgias, headache, vision
cahnges, confusion, dysuria, abdominal pain (out of the
ordinary). She reports lighter stools and darker urines
recently. She also denies cough. She reports fever, but when
asked when she states "when in the coffee shop last time" and
then "when here in the hospital". She reports weight loss, but
is unsure how much.

Brief Hospital Course:
In Brief, this is a 65 y/o F s/p liver [**Year/Month/Day **] [**2196**] for PBC,
hypertension, hypothyroidism who presented with hypotension and
hypothermia to the ED on [**2201-3-8**]. ON arrival, VS T 92, HR 73, Bp
74/58, RR 27 sats 100 2l. She was initially admitted to the ICU.
Broad spectrum antibiotics were given vancomycin, cefepime and
Decadron. IV fluids were given ~ 3 L obtaining good response.
Her initial WBC 7 with no bands, second value WBC 8.6 with 19
bands. Blood CX and urine CX were obtained. Chest x ray with no
clear infiltrates although Ct torso showed R lower Lobe ground
glass attenuation (this has to be followed up in one month by
repeat CT). Ct abdomen with no acute intraabdominal pathology
but with a distended fluid filled esophagus.
.
In the unit she was never hypotensive - instead hypertensive
into the 170's. IV fluids were continued, antibiotics as well.
she was found with persistent diarrhea up to 6-7 episodes a day.
She was started on Flagyl [**2200-3-9**] for ? c Diff. C Diff sent x 1
negative. r/o for MI. TSH was elevated but free T4 was normal.
She also had metabolic acidosis, with low bicarb, thought to be
due to diarrhea. Currently she feels well, no clear complaints.
she has been tolerating PO's.
.
# diarrhea: significant improvement, now bowel movement x4 on
lactulose, stool negative for C-Diff x3 and no other pathogen
could be identified. Given sudden leukopenia, thought to be
consistent with viral gastroenteritis.

# s/p Liver Transplantation: continued tacrolimus with decreased
dose from 1.5 Q12H to 1 mg Q12H, as trough levels were on the
upper normal range. Continued Bactrim SS 3x/week prophylaxix.
.
# hepatic encephalopathy: resolved with lactulose and rifaximin.

.
# HTN: BPs remained elevated. Switched back to captopril 50 mg
[**Hospital1 **] and low dose BB started (metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **]).
.
# Depression: continued Sertraline
.
# Hypothyroidism: continue Levothyroxine
