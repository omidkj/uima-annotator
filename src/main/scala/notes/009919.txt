CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Nausea, vomiting, abdominal distention.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74-year-old
female  with complicated past medical history significant for
squamous  cell  lung  cancer  status  post  left  upper  lobe
resection in [**2115**], multiple pneumonia, ischemic colitis.  The
patient   presents   with  nausea,  vomiting,  and  abdominal
distention.      The   patient   has   been  discontinued  to
rehabilitation  late  in  [**Month (only) 956**],  [**2116**] on TPN and NPO with
exception  to  medications  due to ischemic colitis for which
the patient needs elective hemicolectomy.

At the rehabilitation, she has been gradually weaned from the
ventilator,  but  had recent fever spikes and the sputum grew
Methicillin  resistant  Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella.
These  were  treated  with Cefotetan and Vancomycin with mild
improvement,  however, the patient spiked a fever and at this
time  she  only  grew  out Klebsiella in her sputum.  She was
started  on  Imipenem  for her Klebsiella pneumonia.  The PIC
line was discontinued.  Once her blood cultures grew [**Female First Name (un) 564**],
at   that   time   she   was   started  on  Fluconazole  with
surveillance.   Blood culture were negative per report of the
rehabilitation.    Over  the  last  few  days,  prior  to the
admission,   the   patient   required  increased  ventilatory
support,  and  she was restarted assist control 500/20.  Over
the  last  three  to  four  days,  the patient had increasing
abdominal  distention.  She was complaining of nausea and had
bilious  emesis.   Per husband's report, vomiting had stopped
approximately  two  days  ago.    The  NG  tube was placed on
suction and the abdominal x-ray showed dilated loops of small
bowel and air fluid levels.

On  admission, the patient denied abdominal pain, and nausea.
On  arrival,  she  had a moderate-sized, green bowel movement
guaiac-positive.

HOSPITAL  COURSE:    In summary, the patient is a 74-year-old
female   with  complicated  past  medical  history  including
squamous  cell  lung  cancer,  status  post  left  upper lobe
resection,    ischemic   colitis,   CMV   colitis,   multiple
pneumonias, coronary artery disease, presenting with three to
four  days  of  nausea  and vomiting abdominal distention, as
well as fungemia with [**Female First Name (un) 564**].

Issues during this hospitalization included the following:

#1.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient has history of fungemia
with  [**Female First Name (un) 564**],  which  was  treated with Fluconazole.  During
this  hospitalization,  the  patient's  blood was found to be
positive  for [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 564**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**] and the patient was started on
Amphotericin  B  on [**2-12**].  She is to receive 28 days of
Amphotercin  B.    In  addition,  the patient was found to be
bacteremia with Staphylococcus, coagulase negative, which was
resistant  to  Methicillin, but sensitive to Vancomycin.  The
patient   completed   a   seven-day   course  of  Vancomycin.
Transesophageal  echocardiogram was obtained, which showed no
vegetations   and   a   good  ejection  fraction.    She  had
ophthalmological examination of her eyes, with no evidence of
Candidal ophthalmitis.

In  addition,  the  patient underwent CT scan of her abdomen,
which  did  not  reveal  any abscesses or localized source of
infection.

#2.    GI:    The  patient  presented  with nausea, vomiting,
abdominal  distention,  suggestive of small-bowel obstruction
base on her abdominal film showing gas all the way through to
the  rectum.  She  was  judged  to  have  partial small-bowel
obstruction.    The  NG tube was placed to suction.  Over the
course  of  her  hospitalization  the NG tube output has been
progressively  decreasing.   She underwent colonoscopy, which
revealed  stricture at 25 cm from her rectum.  CT scan of her
abdomen  was  obtained,  which had no evidence of small-bowel
obstruction  or  ischemic colitis.  The Department of Surgery
followed  the  patient  throughout  the  hospital and did not
think  that  she  would  be a good candidate for the elective
