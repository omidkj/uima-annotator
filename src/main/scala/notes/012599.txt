History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 122**] is a 64F with a history of COPD (not on home O2) and
recent spinal fusion with hardware at [**Hospital6 17390**] on [**2165-6-27**] who presented with back pain, fever and
malaise. She had been recovering well from her recent surgery at
rehab ([**Hospital3 **]) until a few days ago when she began to
experience increasing back pain. She did not have bowel or
bladder dysfunction. She did have weakness in her left lower
extremity however she reports this is chronic. She did not
notice any drainage from the surgical site. Because of her
increasing pain she was seen by her orthopedic surgeon in clinic
this morning. Records from that encounter are not available at
this time. The patient reports that she was told that the top of
her wound "looked infected" but she was not given antibiotics.
After she went back to rehab she began to experience fevers and
malaise and therefore she was sent to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.

In the ED initial VS were 102.7 117 110/47 20 99% 4L. An EKG was
performed which showed sinus tach and right bundle branch block
which is old. CK-MB was negative. Lactate was 1.8. She was given
3 liters of fluid and a right IJ was placed. She was started
empirically on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, and Flagyl. A CTA of
the chest/abdomen/pelvis was performed which was (prelim)
negative for PE but showed a very large fluid collection
posterior to the thoraco-lumbar fusion hardware. Orthopedics was
consulted in the ED and recommended admission to the MICU for
fever workup.

On arrival to the MICU, the patient immediately spiked to 102.
She was alert and oriented and able to recount details of recent
events. She reported that her back pain was well controlled.

Of note the patient was admitted between [**6-27**] and [**7-4**] to [**Hospital1 **] for a thoracolumbar spinal fusion.
Post-op course was complicated by leukocytosis. Initially a PNA
was suspected and she was treated with levofloxacin. However
cdif subsequently came back positive and levofloxacin was
stopped and she was started on PO vancomycin(course completed
[**2165-7-14**]). She was transferred to rehab after discharge. She has
not had diarrhea in several days.

Reports:

CT Abdomen - IMPRESSION: 1.  No pulmonary embolism detected to
the proximal segmental levels.  More distal evaluation is
limited by patient motion. 2.  Very large fluid collection
posterior to thoracolumbar fusion hardware, extending superiorly
to T6. The differential includes, seroma, abscess, and
pseudomenigocele. 3.  Widening of the L3-L4 disc space for which
correation with operative note and prior imaging is suggested.
4.  Moderate lingular atelectasis.

ECHO - IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with preserved global systolic function. Right ventricular
dilation and mild global hypokinesis. At least moderate
pulmonary hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 122**] is a 64 year-old woman with a history of COPD and
recent spinal fusion with hardware at [**Hospital6 17390**] on [**2165-6-27**] who presented with back pain, fever and
malaise, and found to have a MRSA infecton of surgical site. Now
s/p surgical washout, hardware extraction and replacement on
[**2165-7-20**].

ACTIVE ISSUES
-------------
#. MRSA wound infection: The patient underwent spinal fusion on
[**2165-6-27**] at [**Hospital6 **] and subseqeuntly developed
worsening back pain. Seen in the ED where she was febrile. A CTA
torso was performed which showed a large fluid collection
posterior to the thoraco-lumbar fusion hardware. Patient was
transferred to the MICU for fever work-up. On [**2165-7-20**], the
patient went to the OR for wash-out. During the operation, the
previously placed hardware was found to be unstable and was
replaced. Transferred back to the ICU where the patient was
started on vancomycin with ID following. Initiall
