Service:  MICU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Rectal bleeding.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 47 year-old
female with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma,
chronic constipation who was discharged to [**Hospital **] Rehab on
[**2103-6-26**] from [**Hospital1 69**].  Last
hospital course at [**Hospital1 69**]
notable for back surgery that was complicated by a
gastrointestinal bleeding and a chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease flare that required intubation.  Further workup of
her gastrointestinal bleeding was deferred until resolution
of her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare.  The
patient reports no bowel movements for the past five days
prior to admission.  On the night prior to admission she took
Milk of Magnesia.  On the morning of admission she had a bed
pan and had watery red stool.  She felt very tired and
fatigued since then and was slightly dizzy.  The patient
denies fevers or chills, only chronic pain at the site of her
back surgery.  On arriving to [**Hospital1 188**] her blood pressure was 140/80.  Pulse 126.  O2 sat 98%
on 2 liters.  Frank blood clots were seen in the perirectal
area on admission.  No bowel movements since admission.
Hematocrit upon admission was 33.8, subsequently went down to
28.4 at which point she was transfused 2 units of packed red
blood cells.  The patient had no complaints of chest pain or
shortness of breath.  At baseline she has a bowel movement
every three to four days with a fair amount of straining
required.  She had a lower gastrointestinal bleed on [**6-13**]
in house after a TA vertebrectomy and T7-9 stabilization
after a fall injury.  At that time she had a hematocrit drop
from 34 to 24, transfused 4 units of packed red blood cells
and 4 units of fresh frozen platelets.  Afterwards she was
hemodynamically stable.  Given the patient's recent surgery
and that the bleeding had stopped a colonoscopy was planned
as an outpatient.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 18.4,
hematocrit 31.1, platelets 226, neutrophils 24, bands 1,
lymphocytes 14, monocytes 3, eosinophils 2, PT/PTT was
12.8/21.1, INR 1.1.  Urinalysis specific gravity was 1.025,
moderate blood, trace protein, trace ketone, trace leukocyte
esterase, 6 to 10 red blood cells, 6 to 10 white blood cells,

INITIAL ASSESSMENT:  The patient is a 47 year-old female with
gastrointestinal bleeding three weeks ago now presenting with
five days of constipation, bright red blood per rectum on
admission.  The patient with a prior history of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and recent back surgery.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Gastrointestinal bleeding:  The patient
remained hemodynamically stable at all times throughout the
hospital course without any further episodes of hypotension
or tachycardia.  The patient did have an episode of about 500
cc of bright red blood per rectum on the day after admission
with a hematocrit drop of approximately 6 points.  She
received 2 units of packed red blood cells to bring her
hematocrit from 26 up to 33.  Thereafter her hematocrit
slowly rose on its own without requiring any further packed
red blood cell transfusions.  The plan was for colonoscopy
with a 500 cc of bright red blood per rectum she did have a
bleeding scan, which was negative.  The patient was then
vigorously prepped for a colonoscopy with attempts to clear
her stool requiring 4 gallons of GoLYTELY and 4 Dulcolax.  An
attempted colonoscopy after the bright red blood per rectum
was aborted after 75 cm of insertion due to a poor prep and
black out from blood.  The patient was prepped for two more
days until clearing of stool until a good colonoscopy could
be performed.  Results of the colonoscopy will be dictated as
a discharge summary addendum.

2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:  The patient was
oxygenated and ventilated adequately.  The patient was
continued on inhaler therapy and was sating 100% on room air
at all times throughout admission with no desaturations.  The
patient had her Flovent decreased to two puffs inhaled b.i.d.
and her Combivent increased to four puffs inhaled q 6 hours
and was stable on this regimen.

3.  Schizoaffective disorder:  The patient was continued on
her outpatient antipsychotic regimen with no further
problems.

4.  Recent back surgery:  Neurosurgery service was contact[**Name (NI) **]
as to the safety of performing a colonoscopy prep and
colonoscopy procedure since she had recent back surgery.
They informed us that it would be safe as long as she was
lying either flat in bed at all times or wearing her back
brace while not in bed.  These precautions were maintained.
The patient had significant back pain, which was treated with
Oxycodone and Percocet and a one time dose of Toradol.

Overall the patient was watched carefully in the MICU after
the episode of hypotension.  She had one episode of bleeding,
which required packed red blood cells, however, no further
episode of bleeding and stable hematocrit by the time of
discharge.  Colonoscopy results will be dictated as a
discharge summary addendum.
