The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization which showed
left main and three vessel disease, elevated wedge pressure
with depressed cardiac index.  Intraaortic balloon pump
inserted in [**12-19**] into the right heart catheter.

The patient was admitted after catheterization.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient underwent a coronary artery
bypass graft times five with a left internal mammary artery
to the left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to the
distal right coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to the
obtuse marginal one and obtuse marginal two sequential, and
saphenous vein graft to the diagonal.

The patient came from the Operating Room on Milrinone and
Levophed.  The patient had an echocardiogram done on
postoperative night and was taken to the Catheterization
Laboratory on [**2132-7-12**], postoperative day one, which showed
all grafts were open.

On [**2132-7-16**], the patient was believed to be experiencing
alcohol withdrawal symptoms and an alcohol drip was started.

On [**7-18**], Milrinone drip was discontinued and on [**7-19**], tube
feeds had been advanced and were at goal.  Levaquin was
started for sputum cultures and on [**2132-7-20**], Ceptaz was
added for better coverage.

On [**7-25**], the patient underwent a swallow evaluation and was
started on thickened liquids and ground solids, but on [**7-29**],
a swallow evaluation showed worsened swallowing capabilities
and therefore the patient was returned to n.p.o. with
nasogastric tube feeds started.

The patient was also noted to have maroon stools.
Nasogastric tube lavage was negative and hematocrits were
stable.  Bronchoscopy done on the same day showed bilateral
thick pulmonary secretions.  The patient again had
bronchoscopy on [**8-1**], which showed bilateral thick brown
secretions.  On [**8-2**], the Levaquin was discontinued.

On [**8-3**], the stools returned to be guaiac positive.  Two
units of packed red blood cells were transfused.  A
gastrointestinal consultation was obtained regarding the
melena and recommendation included an outpatient colonoscopy.

Also, a neurology consultation was obtained regarding
agitation with question of mental status change.
Recommendations included a CT scan of the head, which was
negative for any type of bleed.

The patient underwent a tracheostomy and PEG at bedside on
[**8-6**], and on [**8-7**], the patient dislodged his tracheostomy
and suffered a massive venous bleed which required
re-intubation.  Resuscitation was with three units of packed
red blood cells and fluid bolusing.

The patient then had an open tracheostomy revision done in
the Operating Room and on [**8-13**], the bronchoscopy showed
moderate whitish secretions on the left side.  The patient
was started on Vancomycin for Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus growing out of his sputum on
[**2132-8-15**].

On [**2132-8-17**], the patient was again noted to have [**Last Name (un) 30212**]
stools which were continued to be followed but was stable
otherwise with hematocrits.

On [**8-19**], the patient had his tracheostomy changed to a
Passy-Muir valve for talking capability.  On [**8-21**], the
patient was bronchoscoped and showed left sludging and
copious secretions in the right middle lobe and had a fluid
like quality to it.

On [**8-23**], the patient was noted to be having continuously
guaiac negative stools.  On [**8-27**], the patient was
bronchoscoped again which showed thick mucus secretions on
the left and again on the 12th; to same type of secretions.

On [**8-31**], the patient was noted to have a short episode of
bradycardia into the 40s which returned to the 80s with some
suctioning.  On [**9-1**], the patient was noted to have purulent
secretions on the left side and some bronchomalacia /
obstruction with breathing.

On [**9-3**], the patient was taken to the Operating Room for a
left bronchial stent placement.  On [**9-5**], the patient was
bronchoscoped and had bilateral mucus plugs but the stent was
noted to be in good condition.

On [**9-6**], the patient was once again bronchoscoped showing
left copious secretions with the stent being continued to be
okay.

On [**9-7**], the patient was bronchoscoped once again with left
mild to moderate secretions and the stent continued to be
okay.

On [**9-9**], the patient was taken to the Operating Room and the
stent was removed secondary to minimal improvement with the
stent in place.  The patient was also started on high dose of
guaifenesin.  On [**9-12**], the patient was noted to be
tachypneic on a tracheostomy mask and was arrested on the INV
with CPAP versus tracheostomy mask in the day time.

On [**9-13**], the patient self discontinued his tracheostomy and
it was replaced without incident.

On [**9-14**], the patient was arrested at night.  On [**9-15**], the
patient had a chest x-ray which showed left sided opacity and
the patient was once again bronchoscoped.  Mucous plugs were
removed and the post procedure x-ray was much improved.

The patient was felt to be ready for discharge to a
rehabilitation facility to be determined at a later day.
