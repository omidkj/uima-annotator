PORTABLE CHEST, [**2136-1-8**] AT 14:59.

COMPARISON STUDY: [**2136-1-6**].

CLINICAL INFORMATION: Question pneumothorax.

FINDINGS:

Since the prior study, the Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed.
There is mildly increased opacification of the left lung base, a
combination of atelectasis and small pleural effusion. There is
continued mild blunting of the right costophrenic angle
consistent with a small right pleural effusion. There is mild
cardiomegaly. Valvular prosthesis is present. There are mild
degenerative changes in the thoracic spine and shoulders.

IMPRESSION:

1. Left lower lobe atelectasis and small left pleural effusion.

2. Status post removal of right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter.

Findings
Multiplanar reconstructions were generated and confirmed on an
independent workstation.

LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement. Moderate to severe
spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the LA. Mass in the
body of the LA. A mass consistent with a myxoma or tumor in the
body of the LA. Depressed LAA emptying velocity (<0.2m/s)
Definite thrombus in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. Normal interatrial
septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Mildly depressed LVEF. [Intrinsic LV systolic function likely
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Normal descending aorta diameter.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AR.


MITRAL VALVE: Characteristic rheumatic deformity of the mitral
valve leaflets with fused commissures and tethering of leaflet
motion. Myxomatous mitral valve leaflets. Moderate valvular MS
(MVA 1.0-1.5cm2) Moderate (2+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with physiologic PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The rhythm appears
to be atrial fibrillation. Results were personally reviewed with
the MD caring for the patient.
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is markedly dilated. Moderate spontaneous
echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. Two masses
are seen in the left atrium along the intra-atrial septum
measuring 2.4x1.1cm and 1.4x1 cm.
2. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is depressed
(<0.2m/s). A definite thrombus is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
3. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
4. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %). [Intrinsic
left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
5. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
6. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
7. The mitral valve shows characteristic rheumatic deformity.
The mitral valve leaflets are myxomatous. There is severe
valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.0cm2). Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.

POST-BYPASS:
Pt removed from cardiopulmonary bypass on phenylephrine and
epinephrine infusion and AV paced.
1. A mechanical prosthetic valve is noted in the mitral
position. The valve is well seated with good leaflet excursion.
There is no paravalvular leak and there is trivial mitral
regurgitation in the expected locations.
2. The masses in the left atrium along the intra-atrial septum
are no longer present.
3. The left atrial appendage is still present but there is no
flow through the appendage.
4. Biventricular function is maintained LVEF 45%.
5. Aortic contours are intact post-decannulation.
