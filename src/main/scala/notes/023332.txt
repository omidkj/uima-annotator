History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 98022**] is an 80 year-old male with a history of AVR/MVR
who is being transferred from an OSH for vtach.
.
Over the last few months, has had increasing dyspnea on
exertion. Prior to [**Month (only) 958**], he could walk for a few hundred yards
without DOE. Now he has difficulty walking more than 20 yards or
one flight of stairs. Since his AAA in [**Month (only) 547**], he has also
noticed significant lower extremity edema.
.
On the day of transfer, was admitted to an OSH on with severe
respiratory distress. He complained of two days of SOB, but he
did not initially want to go to the hospital. Overnight
([**9-29**]-->[**9-30**]) he experienced extreme SOB at 4am (after waking to
use the bathroom) and called EMS. Upon arrival to the OSH ED,
was in extreme respiratory distress, responsive, but unable to
talk. Vitals showed BP 192/110 HR 108 RR 20 Temp 96.7 O2 Sat 96%
on RA. An EKG showed IVC which was suspicious for slow vtach so
an amiodarone drip was started. A CXR showed heart failure and a
nitro drip was started and 80mg IV lasix was given with >1 liter
of urine output resulting. CPAP was also used.
.
Prior to transfer, had another episode of Vtach at 1:45pm.
.
Currently, the patient is feeling significantly improved. His
SOB is resolved and he states that his breathing is almost at
it's baseline. He denies any chest pains, palpatations. He did
have some mild nausea on arrival, which he atributes to a bumpy
ambulance ride. He remains on a nitro gtt.

Family History:
NC

Physical Exam:
Blood pressure was 134/69 mm Hg while sitting in bed. Pulse was
86 beats/min and regular, respiratory rate was 19 breaths/min
with an oxygen saturation of >95% on 2 liters. Generally the
patient was well developed, well nourished and well groomed. The
patient was oriented to person, place and time. The patient's
mood and affect were not inappropriate.
.
There was no xanthalesma and conjunctiva were pink with no
pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. The neck was supple with
JVP 2-3cm above the neck at 45%. The carotid pulse was easily
palpable. There was no thyromegaly. The chest wall showed pectus
excavatum. The respirations were not labored and there were no
use of accessory muscles. The lungs showed bibasilar crackles
with good air movement.
.
Palpation revealed no thrills, lifts or palpable S3 or S4. The
heart sounds revealed a harsh midsystolic murmur at the aortic
site.
.
There was no hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. The abdomen was
soft nontender and nondistended. The extremities had no pallor,
cyanosis, clubbing. There was [**3-17**]+ bilateral edema. There were
no abdominal, femoral or carotid bruits. Inspection and/or
palpation of skin and subcutaneous tissue showed no stasis
dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
.

CT HEAD [**2142-10-2**]
FINDINGS: Comparison is made to [**2142-10-1**] and [**2142-6-20**].
.
The tiny hyperdensity of the left centrum semiovale is again
visualized which is not significantly changed. There is no
surrounding vasogenic edema. This finding may represent a
calcification.
.
No intracranial hemorrhages are identified. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white
matter differentiation is maintained. Again seen are extensive
periventricular hypodensities consistent with small vessel
ischemic changes and small watershed infarcts of the right
frontal and occipital lobes. The ventricles and extra-axial CSF
spaces are unchanged.
.
The visualized orbits are normal. The visualized paranasal
sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. No suspicious bony
abnormalities are seen.
.
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhages.
No significant change in tiny hyperdensity of the left centrum
semiovale which likely represents a calcification.
.
ECHO [**2142-10-1**]
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated.  There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size  and regional/global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber  size
and free wall motion are normal. A bioprosthetic aortic valve
prosthesis  is present. The transaortic gradient is at the upper
limit of normal for this  prosthesis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets  are mildly
thickened. A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present. The
mitral  annular ring appears well seated and is not obstructing
flow. No mitral  regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.  There is an anterior space which
most likely represents a fat pad.
 .
IMPRESSION: Mild left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved
regional/global  biventricular systolic function. Marked
biatrial dilation. Mild aortic  regurgitation in the presence of
a bioprosthetic AVR. Gradients across AVR at  at upper limits of
normal. Mitral valve annuloplasty ring appears well seated.
Gradients across ring also at upper limits of normal. Mild
pulmonary
hypertension. Mildly dilated thoracic aorta.


Brief Hospital Course:
80 year-old male with a history of CAD, Atrial fibrillation s/p
AVR/MVR who was transferred from from an OSH for concern for
ventricular tachycardia.  On arrival his EKG's were as follows:
EKG #1 ([**9-30**]; OSH): Wide complex tachycardia with a rate of 110.

EKG #2 ([**9-30**]; [**Hospital1 18**]): NSR with a 1st degree AV block. LAD;
possible [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 24898**]. Loss of R-waves in precordial leads
(old). LVH
Electrophysiology consult was placed and it was felt that this
was more likely a supraventricular tachycardia in the setting of
a bundle branch block.  Plan was for evaluation and possible
ablation in the electrophysiology lab however we had to wait
several days as his INR was supratheraputic.  Once INR < 2 he
went to EP lab and had ablation of atrial tachycardia focus.
.
1. Respiratory distress:
The patient's examination and CXR were most consistent with
pulmonary edema. He responded well to lasix and a nitro gtt.
Regarding possible causes for this, he was hypertensive on
admission to the OSH which may have been a precipitant, as well
as his tachycardia. He has significant valvular disease and
symptoms of both right and left heart failure. The patient
diuresed appropriat
