Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9157**]
Chief Complaint:
anemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endoscopy with AVM clips


History of Present Illness:
77yo F with h/o jejunal AVMs resulting in prior GI bleeds (last
bleed in [**2103-4-8**]), CAD, CHF (EF 35%), SVT s/p ablation, who was
initially admitted to OSH with diaphoresis on [**9-21**] while
working. Was brought to ED via EMS and was found to have OSH Hct
of 20.9 in setting of melena. On admission she was ruled out for
MI. Was initially transfused 2 units of pRBCs and started on
protonix gtt. Hct then improved to 26.1 however then drifted
down to 22.7 after 18h. Subsequent Hct without furhter
transfusion was 19.1. She was then given 3u of pRBCs. GI was
consulted who performed an EGD (enteroscopy)and clips were
deployed in area of fresh blood in mid-jejunum. Unclear if
vessel was noted. Area was also stained. Given concern for
potential ongoing bleeding, pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further evaluation.

On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], pt was resting comfortable without any
concerns. She arrived with another unit of pRBCs.

[**2103-9-27**] TTE:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
There is a moderate resting left ventricular outflow tract
obstruction (26 mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The study is inadequate to
exclude mild aortic valve stenosis, though it is unlikely that
clinically significant AS is present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Small hypertrophied left ventricle with hyperdynamic
systolic function and moderate resting LVOT obstruction. Cannot
exclude mild superimposed aortic stenosis. Mild aortic
regurgitation. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension.

Enteroscopy:
Findings: Esophagus: Normal esophagus.
Stomach: Normal stomach.
Duodenum: Normal duodenum.
Jejunum:
 - Lumen: Previous hemoclips were seen in the mid-jejunum.
 - Contents: Red blood was seen in the mid jejunum.
Ileum: Not examined.
Other
findings: Residual bleeding was seen at the site of the
previusly placed hemoclips. No identifiable vessel was
identifiable, but a small mucosal tear at the insertion of a
previously placed hemoclip was seen. 4 9 cc.Epinephrine 1/[**Numeric Identifier 961**]
injections were applied for hemostasis with success in the
mid-jejunum. Three endoclips were successfully applied for the
purpose of mucosal tear closure in the mid jejunum, at the site
of the previously placed endoclips. afte injection and clips
placement, no further active bleeding was observed.
Impression: Blood in the mid jejunum
Previous of the jejunum
Residual bleeding was seen at the site of the previusly placed
hemoclips. No identifiable vessel was identifiable, but a small
mucosal tear at the insertion of a previously placed hemoclip
was seen. (injection, endoclip)
Otherwise normal small bowel enteroscopy to mid jejunum


Brief Hospital Course:
77yoF with history of jejunal AVMs, CAD, CHF (EF 35%)+ initially
presented for diaphoresis found to have anemia [**1-10**] GI bleed with
bleeding jejunal [**Hospital 91277**] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] further care.

# Acute Blood Loss Anemia: Known bleeding jejunal AVM. S/P clip
placement at OSH. Transferred to MICU where she remained
hemodyanically stable. She was then sent to the floor. Overnight
on the floor, Hct dropped from 25 to 17. She was transfused and
send back to MICU for close monitoring. GI completed enteroscopy
showing mucosal tear in jejunum, which was repaired with clip.
Hct was trended. She received a total of 4 units of PRBCs in
MICU. Patient remained HDS. Pt was then transferred back to
floor. She remained stable on the floor with a Hct around 29.
Discharged home with explicit instructions to return to the ED
immediately if she experienced any bleeding or symptoms of
anemia.

# CAD/CHF: Reported EF of 35% but TTE performed in hospital
showed an LVEF of 70% and some LVOT obstruction. Results of the
echo were sent to her cardiologist for followup as outpatient.
Her aspirin was stopped due to GI bleed. This can be restarted
per outpatient recommendations. Simvastatin was stopped in favor
of atorvastatin due to concurrent verapamil.

# H/O Arrhythmia (SVT, 1st degree heart block): All
anti-hypertensives were held due to GI bleed. On day of
discharge, she was tachy up to 180s while having a bowel
movement. Restarted metoprolol and verapimil with good heart
rate control.

# Hypertension:  All anti-hypertenives held initially in setting
of GI bleed. Restarted on day of discharge and continued on
discharge.

# Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
# LVOT Obstruction on echo should be addressed by cardiology
# Aspirin held due to GI bleed
