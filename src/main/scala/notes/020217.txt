Brief Hospital Course:
74 yoM w/ h/o PVD, CAD s/p CABG X 4 originally admitted to the
medical service [**2150-5-26**] from [**Hospital1 **] (d/c'd there following TMA
[**3-10**]) with BRBPR. GI consulted. EGD [**2150-5-26**] w/
gastritis/erosions; treated with PPI PO BID and repeat EGD
[**2150-5-28**] showed interval improvement. Sigmoidoscopy [**2150-5-26**]
showed flecks of bled from unclear source. Colonoscopy [**2150-5-28**]
showed internal hemorrhoids and multiple sessile nonbleeding
polyps 3-8 mm polyps in cecum, transverse, sigmoid, and rectum
with granularity in cecum c/w polypoid tissue (biopsy showed
focal hyperplastic changes, lymphoid aggregade and focal active
inflamation with a few crypt abscesses). Fecal cx/campylobacter
cx negative, however C. diff was positive and patient was
started on Flagyl PO [**5-26**] (course completed [**2150-6-16**]).
.
Given recent right fem-posterior tibial bypass and right TMA c/b
wound infection, he was covered with vanco/levo/flagyl and
vascular surgery was consulted, who recommended right arterial
duplex U/S. This was performed on [**2150-5-27**], c/w high grade right
femoral-tibial bypass graft stenosis just above tibiofemoral
joint space, and he was transferred to the vascular surgery
service [**5-31**]. His anticoagulation was changed from lepirudin to
argatroban and he underwent a RLE arteriogram [**6-1**] which showed
80-99% stenosis at mid fem-posterior tibial argery graft;
angioplasty performed X 2. On [**6-4**] p.m., his RR increased to 24
and his mental status declined, necessitating transfer to SICU
and intubation. Declining clinical status was attributed to
potential sepsis and antibiotics were broadened to Vanco
IV/Flagyl PO/Vanco PO/Zosyn. Given drop in HCT (26.3 from 33.1),
drop in plt (33 from 106 on admit), argotroban was discontinued
and hematology was consulted, who felt this was most likely
secondary to septic physiology (no evidence of TTP or
hemolysis). EP was also consulted given concern that PM may have
played a role in declining mental status prior to intubation.
They noted that he may have experienced a mode switch on [**6-2**] as
reached end of battery life. Given [**1-7**] bcx [**6-4**] with coag
negative staph, PM change was delayed until he finished 1 week
course of vanco IV [**6-12**].
