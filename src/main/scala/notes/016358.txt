History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 73 yo male resident of [**Hospital 100**] Rehab recent MRSA PNA, and
osteomyelitis, with h/o CAD s/p CABG, hypertension,
osteomyelitis with recent MRSA bacteremia who presented with
shortness of breath at rehab on the AM of admission.
.
He was found to be in septic shock, acute renal failure (which
quickly resolved with fluid administration) was intubated, and
was weaned off pressors, and was empirically treated with
vancomycin and zosyn for presumed nosocomial infection, though
there was no clear source of infection.  Despite antibiotic
therapy he continued to spike high temperatures and TEE, abd CT,
RUQ u/s, and MRI C/L/S spine were performed in addition to
routine cultures to look for evidence of endocarditis, occult
abdominal infection, or reoccurence of MRSA epidural infection.
All of these were negative.
.
Blood cultures grew VRE and pt is s/p 14 day course of
linezolid. In terms of his respiratory status initial hypoxic
respiratory failure on admission was felt to be [**1-19**] to high
demand in setting of sepsis. He was extubated on however became
increasing tachypneic and fatigued. Pt was reintubated and felt
to be a high risk of  extubation and underwent tracheostomy on
[**12-8**] requiring pressure support and now only trach mask.
.
Course was also complicated by UTI treated with 3 days of cipro,
however, spiked temperature related to cipro and this was d/cd.
His urine culture from [**2135-12-17**] is growing GNR and pt was
started on bactrim this am. Additionally, pt with anemia
(chronic disease) supported by blood transfusions prn.
.
Today, pt feels well. He says that his breathing is stable, no
CP.  He has been wearing his Passy-Muir valve for one hour and
still feels well.  His right finger has been painful for the
past 2 days wsith decreased ROM.

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course from [**11-27**] to [**12-13**] is briefly summarized by
problems:

1. Septic shock - patient was initially admitted for sepsis
requiring levophed for maintainece of blood pressure and
ultimately weaned off by [**11-28**] after aggressive IVF repletion.
Infectious diseases was consulted and he was empirically treated
with Vancomycin and Zosyn for presumed nosocomial pneumonia
although no clear source of infection was identified.  Despite
antibiotic therapy he continued to spike high temperatures and
TEE, abd CT, RUQ u/s, and MRI C/L/S spine were performed in
addition to routine cultures to look for evidence of
endocarditis, occult abdominal infection, or recrudescence of
his MRSA epidural infection.  However, all imaging studies were
negative and central venous lines were resited for persistent
fevers.  Blood cultures drawn from CVL on [**12-1**] grew GPC
ultimately speciated to be VRE and he was initiated on 14 day
course of Linezolid (started [**12-4**]) with improvement of symptoms
and fevers. He currently finished 14 day course of Linezolid and
has not been spiking fever and leukocytosis is trending down

2. Respiratory failure - initial hypoxic respiratory failure
felt to be [**1-19**] to high demand in setting of sepsis.  Pt required
minimal ventilator support and exhibited good lung mechanics.
He was extubated on [**11-28**] but became increasing tachypneic and
fatigued.  He was re-intubated on [**11-29**] for increased secretions
and fatigue.  Remained intubated despite rapid shallow breathing
indices <90 but copious secretions.  Ultimately he was felt to
be high risk of extubation and underwent tracheostomy on [**12-8**]
without complications.  Since that time, he has been
intermittently placed on trach mask and requiring PS ventilation
for fatigue.  He continues to be actively diuresed for his
secretions.  On [**12-12**] he was noted to have some upper airway
bleeding near trach site in setting of systemic heparinization.
It quickly resolved with discontinuation of heparin and felt to
be nose bleed draining around tracheostomy cuff.  He was
evaluated and fitted with a Passy-Muir valve. He has been doing
well on regular medical floor on trach mask.
.
3. Fevers - pt had defervesced several days after Linezolid had
been intiated.  However he has low grade temperatures that have
not yielded an etiology.  He has undergone search for
non-infectious w/u including infection with negative results.
However, his WBC count has trended downwards.  He was found to
have UTI in setting of foley catheter and intiated on 3 day
course of ciprofloxacin.  On [**12-13**] AM pt had temperature of 102F
without localizing symptoms and hemodynamically stable.  His WBC
continues to be low and temporally related to ciprofloxacin
dosing.  He has completed his course of ciprofloxacin on [**12-13**].
On [**12-16**], pt spiked another fever and a urine cx from that day
grew Actinobacter which was sensitive to zosyn which was started
on [**2135-12-19**] and has to complete a 5 day course
.
4. Acute Renal Failure - His creatinine at admission was 2.6 and
felt to be pre-renal in setting of septic shock.  It quickly
normalized to after IVF resuscitation and currently around 1.0.

.
5. atrial flutter - throught his ICU course he remained in
atrial flutter.  He was well rate controlled on digoxin and
b-blockers.  His anti-coagulation was held peri-operatively.  He
had two episodes of bradycardia into 40's that was felt to be
[**1-19**] digoxin effects from electrolyte derrangements during
diuresis.  They quickly resolved after electrolyte repletion.
Please montior pt on telemetry during rehab.  Following the
placement of the tracheostomy, pt noted to have large amounts of
bloody secretions from trach.  His coumadin and hepar
