Chief Complaint:
loss of consciousness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
stereotactic brain biopsy
right frontal craniotomy with resection of mass
bronchoscopy with tumor debulking


History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 2816**] is a 53-year-old man with a past medical history
significant for HIV, Hep C, metastatic squamous cell lung ca
with mets to the brain who was transferred from an outside
hospital with a seizure. The patient only recalls that his blood
sugars were elevated on the night before admission, that he got
up to go to the bathroom around 1 am, and remembers waking up
around 8 am in the bathtub covered with stool. He denies
confusion, but reports some left sided numbness that has
persisted but improved slightly. Head CT at the [**Hospital 78319**]
hospital showed a large mass in the right frontoparietal area
2.5 cm in diameter with vasogenic edema.

Past Medical History:
Past onc history (per Dr.[**Name (NI) 6767**] initial outpatient note
[**2110-6-9**]):  Mr. [**Known lastname 2816**] developed hemoptysis in [**2110-3-1**]. A
chest X-ray and chest CT showed a tumor in his R lung. He
underwent a bronchoscopy at an OSH, which was complicated by
hemorrhage. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 1170**] on [**2110-5-7**] to have the broncoscopic biopsy with
bronchial stent placement. Pathology showed poorly
differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with ulceration, necrosis
and lymphovascular invasion. Subsequent PET/CT showed the lung
tumor together with brain metastases. He was taken to [**Hospital1 9191**], where he had a gadolinium-enhanced head MRI, showing
brain metastasis.  He was started on dexamethasone for this.

The patient was referred by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD, to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 724**]
(neuro-onc at [**Hospital1 18**]) for management of his brain mets. He
presented to Dr.[**Name (NI) 6767**] office on [**2110-6-9**]. He had a nonproductive
cough but denied fever, chills, nightsweat,headache, nausea,
vomiting, seizure, imbalance, urinary  incontinence, or fall. He
was sent to the ED for further management and admitted to the
Interventional Pulmonary service. A bronch on [**6-10**] showed that
the stent had migrated proximally. The stent was replaced, and
the patient is being transferred to the Oncology service for
further management of his oncologic issues.

Imaging:

[**2110-6-21**]. PA/LATERAL CXR: A large central right upper lobe
mass is again demonstrated with associated right hilar and
paratracheal lymphadenopathy. Linear opacities projecting distal
to the mass may represent a component of minor post-obstructive
atelectasis or localized lymphangitic spread of tumor. Heart
size is normal. No pleural effusions or acute skeletal
abnormalities are identified.
IMPRESSION: Large central right upper lobe neoplastic mass with
associated
right paratracheal and right hilar lymphadenopathy. These
findings have
previously been evaluated by CT of the chest, and correlation
with that study recommended for more complete assessment.

[**2110-6-21**]. Non-contrast head CT.
Images are degraded by motion artefact. There is a 2.5 x 2.6 cm
right parasagittal frontal lobe mass with central areas of low
attenuation and extensive adjacent vasogenic edema unchanged
since recent MR study. There is no significant mass effect or
shift of normally midline structures. There are no other masses
or lesions. There is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage. The
ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration. The
[**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter differentiation is well preserved. Osseous
structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Unchanged right frontal parasagittal mass with
surrounding
vasogenic edema, without significant mass effect or shift of
midline
structures. No hemorrhage.

[**2110-6-24**]. Triplanar post-Gadolinium spin echo T1-weighted
images and axial post-Gadolinium MP-RAGE of the head were
obtained. Again seen is an enhancing mass involving the right
frontal lobe with central area of apparent cavitation. The mass
measures approximately 2.7 x 2.7 x 3.1 cm in its traverse, AP,
and craniocaudal dimensions. This appears to have minimally
increased in size since the prior study from [**2110-6-11**]. Again seen
is a large area of surrounding edema with sulcal effacement.
There is also depression of the right lateral ventricle and
minimal right to left shift of the normally midline structures.
No new enhancing lesions are identified. Overlying right frontal
burr hole is again seen. IMPRESSION: Large right frontal mass
with surrounding edema again visualized. The mass may have
minimally increased in size compared to [**2110-6-11**].

[**2110-7-3**] MDCT-acquired contiguous axial images of the head
were obtained without IV contrast.
The patient is status post right frontal craniotomy. There is
some
adjacent soft tissue swelling. There is no new intracranial
hemorrhage. There is again marked vasogenic edema. There appears
to be minimally increased subfalcine herniation with 14 mm
midline shift compared to 13 on prior, although this may be due
to technique and slice selection. There is
persistent edema and mass effect on the lateral ventricle as
well as sulcal effacement, which overall is otherwise similar.
There is trace residual pneumocephalus. The subcutaneous
emphysema is similar. The mastoid processes are not well
pneumatized but are unchanged. The mucosal thickening in the
left mastoid is similar. IMPRESSION: Persistent right frontal
vasogenic edema with subfalcine herniation and minimally
increased midline shift, which may be due to technique. No new
intracranial hemorrhage.

[**2110-7-7**]  TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is normal. There is no peri
