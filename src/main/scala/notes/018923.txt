CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Abdominal pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 52-year-old
male with multiple medical problems, status post recent
discharge from the [**Hospital1 69**] for
hypoxia who presents now with one to two days of abdominal
pain, fever with a temperature of 102.6, and leukocytosis.  A
chest x-ray at [**Hospital3 7**] demonstrated new right lower
lobe pneumonia and the patient was started on vancomycin and
ceftazidime.  On the day of admission, the patient had
worsening symptoms and there was concern over his rigid
abdomen so the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 346**] for further evaluation.  The patient
denied any rigors, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, but did
complain of a significant amount of right upper quadrant
abdominal pain.

percent.

Status post brain abscess and septic emboli from the
staphylococcal endocarditis.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for coronary artery disease and
valvular disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Remote tobacco use, quit 20 years ago.  The
patient does not drink alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  On admission,
temperature 100.6, heart rate 112, blood pressure 97/59,
oxygen saturation 100 percent on ventilator support.
General:  The patient was a chronically ill-appearing male.
HEENT:  Dry mucosal membranes.  The pupils were equal, round,
and reactive to light.  The extraocular muscles were intact.
Heart:  Irregularly/irregular with a II/VI systolic ejection
murmur at the left lower sternal border at the apex.  Lungs:
Coarse breath sounds bilaterally.  There was scattered
rhonchi at the bases.  Abdomen:  Tense, tender, positive
bowel sounds with guarding, mainly in the right upper
quadrant.  Extremities:  There was no clubbing, cyanosis, or
edema.  Chronic venostasis changes with mottling in the lower
extremities bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 30.5, 98 percent
polys, 5 percent lymphs, hematocrit 32, platelets 230,000.
Sodium 148, potassium 3.9, BUN 52, creatinine 3.7.  PTT 43.6,
INR 3.6.  The U/A was negative for infection.

The abdominal CT showed right lower lobe consolidation
consistent with pneumonia, multiple intra-abdominal loculated
fluid collections with peripheral enhancement concerning for
infected fluid and a distended gallbladder.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. SEPSIS:  In the Emergency Department, the patient was
   febrile to 100.6 with a blood pressure of 90/60 and
   tachycardia.  He was enrolled in the MUST protocol for
   sepsis.  His lactate was 1.8.  He had a right IJ triple
   lumen catheter placed.  He was given IV fluids, was
   continued on vancomycin and ceftazidime.  His abdominal CT
   revealed a right lower lobe pneumonia and several
   abdominal wall fluid collections with a faint peripheral-
   enhancing ring.  The patient was seen and evaluated by the
   surgical team as there was concern for acalculous
   cholecystitis and/or abdominal wall abscesses.  At this
   time, it was felt that the patient was a poor surgical
   candidate and that the best option would be to undergo an
   ultrasound-guided drainage of these abdominal wall fluid
   collections by Interventional Radiology.

The patient underwent this procedure and the abdominal
ultrasound revealed a large left lower quadrant fluid
collection and a simple right upper quadrant fluid collection
with a few thin septations.  The gallbladder was distended
and full of sludge.  There was gallbladder wall edema and
irregularities along the mucosal surface and the nondependent
portion.  There was no common bile duct dilatation and there
were no stones identified.  The two abdominal wall fluid
collections were drained and a #8 French pigtail catheter was
left in the right upper quadrant fluid collection.  Over the
next several days, the right upper quadrant fluid collection
contained dark material with a total bilirubin of 2.2 and an
LDH of 923.  Initially, the right upper quadrant fluid
collection was felt to potentially be a biloma; however, upon
further discussion with the Surgery Team, it was felt that
this low-level bilirubin was more consistent with an
abdominal wall hematoma and breakdown of red blood cells.

The patient was continued on a seven day course of vancomycin
and Zosyn, renally dosed, and defervesced within 48 hours.
He continued to do well and have improvement in his abdominal
pain.  However, on the day of discharge, the patient had mild
to moderate tenderness and tenseness in his right upper
quadrant.  He was seen by his surgeon, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who felt
that his abdominal examination was consistent with his
baseline abdominal examination preadmission.

RIGHT LOWER LOBE PNEUMONIA:  On admission, the patient had a
chest x-ray from [**Hospital3 7**] which showed a right lower
lobe consolidation.  In addition, his admission CAT scan at
the [**Hospital1 69**] showed a right lower
lobe consolidation.  The patient was continued on a seven day
course of vancomycin and Zosyn for his sepsis and on the day
of discharge the patient had no further evidence of ongoing
pneumonia.

RESTRICTIVE LUNG DISEASE AND RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  The
patient has a history of restrictive lung disease and was
recently intubated and had a tracheostomy performed in [**2153-3-26**] for progressive respiratory failure.  His respiratory
disease is felt to be due to restriction secondary to his
ankylosing spondylitis.  During this admission, the patient
was maintained on his usual ventilator settings of AC with a
tidal volume of 400, rate of 12, PEEP 5, and an FI02 of 40
percent.  The patient underwent several two to three hour
periods where he was off ventilatory support.  Upon
discharge, the patient should continue at Pulmonary
Rehabilitation and should have his ventilator weaned with a
goal of having him eventually off the ventilator during the
day and resting on the ventilator with AC overnight.  The
patient's pulmonary rehabilitation and ventilator weanings
should include several short one to three hour periodic
breaks off the ventilator as bursts of respiratory muscle
exercise are better than long-term trials over several days
that could exhaust the patient.

CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  The patient was with congestive
heart failure with an ejection fraction of [**11-9**] percent.
His volume was maintained with hemodialysis three times a
week.  The patient has ischemic cardiomyopathy with an
ejection fraction less than 35 percent and has NSVT with
short runs of up to 25-30 beats seen on telemetry.  He should
be continued on his heart failure beta blocker  and if he
continues to do well at the rehabilitation facility an
outpatient EP consult should be considered for possible ICD
placement.
