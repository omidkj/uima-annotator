Pertinent Results:
[**10-16**] CNIS: Minimal plaque with bilateral less than 40% carotid
stenosis. [**10-16**] Echo: Pre Bypass: The left atrium is mildly
dilated. No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. There is mild to moderate global left
ventricular systolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in
the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There are
filamentous strands on the aortic leaflets consistent with
Lambl's excresences (normal variant). There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened, but appear structurally normal.
Mitral regurgitation varied dramatically throughout the
prebypass period.. High Mild to Moderate([**1-29**]+)/low Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen with provactive manuvers. With
application of nitroglycerin, mitral regurgitation became trace
to absent. Vena contracta was 0.5-0.6 cm at worst. Mitral
annulus averages 3.1 cm in diameter. Post Bypass: Patient is on
phenylepherine with atrial pacing. LV function is improved to
50-55% with no wall motion abnormalities. RV function remains
normal. Mitral Regurgitation is now trace to mild. Remaining
exam is unchanged. All findings discussed with surgeons at the
time of the exam.
[**10-21**] CXR: Resolved left apical pneumothorax and decreasing right
atelectasis. Increasing pleural fluid on the left.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Ms. [**Known lastname 74520**] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for surgical management of her coronary disease. She underwent
all pre-operative testing prior to surgery and on [**10-16**] was
brought to the operating room where she underwent a coronary
artery bypass graft x 5. Please see operative report for
surgical details. Following surgery she was transferred to the
CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. Within 24
hours she was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact
and extubated. On post-op day one she was started on beta
blockers and diuretics. She was gently diuresed towards her
pre-op weight. Later on this day she was transferred to the SDU
for further management. Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires
were removed on post-op day two. On post-op day three she
required a blood transfusion for low HCT. She continued to do
well and worked with physical therapy for strength and mobility.
Early on post-op day five she had an episode of atrial
fibrillation and was started on amiodarone. She was discharged
the following day (post-op day six) in sinus rhythm with VNA
services and the appropriate follow-up appointments.
