CT Head ([**9-8**]):  Large developing left MCA infarction. No
evidence for intracranial hemorrhage. These findings were
discussed with the Neurology team in person, and a wet read was
provided at the ED dashboard at the time of the study.

Carotid Echo ([**9-9**]): Duplex color Doppler demonstrate no plaque
or wall thickening, normal peak systolic velocities, normal ICA
to CCA ratios, and normal antegrade flow involving both
vertebral arteries.

MRI/MRA ([**9-9**]): Acute infarct involving the entire left MCA
territory.   Non-visualization of the entire left middle
cerebral artery from its origin.

CT Head ([**9-10**]): Massive increase in the left-sided edema in the
known left MCA infarct. 2-cm herniation of the midline
structures with subfalcine and uncal herniation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted to ICU.  On day one, patient was awake and making
purposeful spontaneous movements with the left upper extremity.
Was unresponsive to all prompts including when done in Russian,
her primary language.

On early AM of [**9-10**] (about 36 hours after admission) was found to
have decreased mental status with eyes closed, still
unresponsive, sluggish right pupil and absent left corneal
reflex.  Respiratory status was tenuous and patient did not seem
to be protecting airway adequately.  Stat head CT showed massive
progression of edema in Left MCA/ACA distribution with
significant mass effect and shift.  There was subfalcine
herniation and some uncal herniation. Son was called immediately
and arrive shortly for discussion of plan of care.  Patient's
poor prognosis was discussed and inspite of the poor outlook,
the son requested full code and aggressive supportive measures
including intubation.

On [**9-12**] early AM, the patient was suddenly noted to be
hypertensive and tachycardic.  Son was called immediately and
given the poor outlook requested code change to DNR.  Later
around 0700, patient's pressures fell to around 70/30 and the
son requested initiation of pressors.  Stated that he understood
futility of pressors, but requested them based on wanting a
grandson in [**Name2 (NI) **] to be able to make it up before her dying.
Later in early afternoon requested that pressors be shut off.
Patient's pressures dropped as expected.  After a second
conversation son requested that pt. be made comfortable, and
extubated, and this was performed in the afternoon.  Pt.'s
breathing slowed and at 6:35 she passed away.  Son declined
autopsy.
