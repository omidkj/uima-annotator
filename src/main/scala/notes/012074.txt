History of Present Illness:
70 year old male with DM, dialated ischemic cadiomyopathy
(EF=10%) s/p PCM/ICD, CAD s/p MI x 3 and CABG, aflutter s/p
cardioversion on dabigatran, Stage III CKD, and DM, PVD s/p
right 4th toe amputation on [**2112-6-5**].  He was most recently
admitted on [**2112-7-5**] debridement of his right foot for an
osteomyelitis from a right 4th digit ulcer.  He was discharged
on [**7-12**] to [**Hospital3 **] with a PICC and a 6 week course of
vancomycin.  On [**7-30**] the pt reportedly d/c'd his own PICC.  He
was discharged from Rehab on [**2112-8-1**] on PO vancomycin because he
had no IV access.  He left AMA.  He was doing well at home until
2 days prior to admission when he started to be more "altered"
according to his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] was not responding appropriately and
speaking less.  He had decreased PO intake.  According to his
wife, he "lives" for his food and so she always knows something
is wrong when he loses his appetite.  She denies fevers, sweats
in him.  She said his urine was very cloudy, but denies that he
had reported dysuria.  He did not have increased frequency.  She
was suspicious for a UTI because he had similar symptoms when he
had a previous UTI.  Patient also started having diarrhea 2 days
prior to admission.  He had an unspecified amount of diarrhea
and the wife thought it was secondary to the vancomycin.
.
Of note, the patient was seen in podiatry clinic on [**8-5**] the pt
was seen in podiatry clinic that notes that the right foot was
"friable" but had "no signs of infection".
.
Here in the ER the pt presented altered, and reportedly without
any localizing symptoms, just becoming increasingly altered with
decreased PO intake over the preceding 3-4 days.  The pt's wife
did report that the pt had abdominal pain, but the wife reported
that this was chronic.  In the ER, the pt was 99.4*F, p91,
90/56, r14, 100% on 3L, hypotensive, had "foul" urine, the pt's
right foot was erythematous, and had [**Last Name (un) **], and was administered
vancomycin, zosyn, and then D50, 10U regular insulin, calcium
gluconate, and 30mg kayexalate.  A CT head, abdomen, and pelvis
was performed which was unrevealing.  While in the ER, the pt
began to have "shaking".  Per the pt's wife, the shaking is near
baseline as the pt has a near constant tremor, and didn't
particularly notice that it was particularly worse.  Regardless,
a bedside EEG was performed, which revealed seizures.
.
On arrival to the MICU the pt was oriented only to person,
essentially non-verbal.  The wife was [**Name (NI) 653**] and the HPI was
reviewed.

EEG [**2112-8-9**]: This telemetry from [**8-10**] showed a
slow and encephalopathic background with some bursts of slowing
and additional generalized blunted sharp waves. Some of these
had a "triphasic" appearance. Early in the record, they could
recur almost once a second, but this was brief and only for five
to ten seconds at a time. After the first half an hour or so,
sharp waves were significantly less frequent and not
particularly rhythmic. They appeared likely to be part of the
encephalopathy. There were no clearly epileptiform features.
There were no focal abnormalities although it should be noted
that encephalopathies may obscure focal findings.

CXR (portable AP) [**2112-8-9**]: Cardiomegaly, no signs of CHF or
pneumonia.

wall. Correlate for ladder infection.
