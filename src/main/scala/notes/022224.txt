[**2104-1-12**] LENI: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis.

[**1-12**] CXR: Various lines and tubes are unchanged in position
since a recent radiograph. Diffuse airspace opacification and a
layering moderate left pleural effusion are again demonstrated
as well as a confluent opacity at the extreme right base. The
lung volumes are slightly increased compared to the previous
study, but there is otherwise not a significant interval change.

Brief Hospital Course:
1.  sepsis and hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to
pneumonia - in the ICU, pt was treated with vancomycin, Zosyn,
and levofloxacin for a 10 day course, with levo x 14 days total.
 He was fluid repleted and eventually weaned off pressors.  Was
also given empiric steroids due to hypotension.  Had also
initially been paralyzed to try to improve oxygenation.
Pressors and vecuronium discontinued within 2 days of OSH
transfer.  Pt was placed on vent settings consistent with
ARDSnet protocol.  Sputum did not reveal a specific
microorganism, [**Known lastname **] cultures were negative.  Bronchoalveolar
lavage on [**1-17**] revealed 2+ PMNs and MRSA.  He was clinically
much improved by that point and was successfully extubated on
[**1-19**], which he tolerated well.  When he was transferred to the
floor, he had been afebrile for >24 hours, satting well on 5L
NC. On the floor, supplemental oxygen was weaned as tolerated,
and patient was diuresed with good effect. On 2L at home, on 2L
at discharge.

2.  ATN - On transfer, pt's Cr was 5.3 (unknown baseline).  This
gradually improved with IVF and pt maintained good UOP
throughout his stay.  Renal ultrasound negative.  He did not
require dialysis.  Cr was 1.3 on discharge.

3.  arthritis - pt has arthritis of unclear etiology (rheumatoid
vs psoriatic vs osteoarthritis).  States that he has been on
Remicade in the past but failed this.  He states that he took
80mg OxyContin [**Hospital1 **] at home.  However, his mental status
prevented the team from giving this quantity of narcotics.  Of
note, he is requesting being considered for a fentanyl patch or
more long-acting pain regimen.  Pain under control on floor with
Oxycontin 40 [**Hospital1 **].

4.  Diarrhea - Pt developed diarrhea a couple of days prior to
his transfer to the floor.  Stool cx, and C diff x3, were
negative.  Diarrhea improving per nursing report.

5.  Hypernatremia - pt developed hypernatremia while in the ICU.
 He was given free water flushes through his OG tube, and then
more free water was repleted via IV.  This resolved by the time
of discharge.

6.  Diabetes mellitus type 2 - Pt was maintained on an insulin
sliding scale while in the ICU.  His glyburide was held in the
setting of renal failure but can be restarted when his Cr
returns to baseline.  Sugars have been running low, please be
cautious in re-starting. Pt was maintained on a diabetic diet.

7.  Altered mental status - pt complained of "slow thinking" and
clouded sensorium after extubation.  This was likely due to
course of fentanyl/versed, as well as his critical illness.
Narcotics could also have contributed.  Mental status remained
stable to improved, and no further workup was pursued at this
time.

8.  Depression - pt was restarted on outpatient wellbutrin and
celexa.

9.  Access - pt had L subclavian in ICU, discontinued.  Had L
arm swelling thought [**12-27**] IV infiltration, improved.

10. Communication - HCP is brother [**Name (NI) 1312**]; wife [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **]
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 65913**].
