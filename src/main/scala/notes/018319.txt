Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 10493**]
Chief Complaint:
Bleeding from the left ear

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Upper endoscopy [**2181-10-19**]
2. Colonoscopy [**2181-10-22**]


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with PMH significant for HTN, atrial fib on
coumadin, and CHF (EF 20%) admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**10-19**] with a
Hct of 20. Pt was in her normal state of health until four days
prior to admission when her ear began bleeding after she cleaned
it with a Qtip. Pt denies pain or decrease in hearing from this
ear. She presented to the ED on [**10-19**] for evaluation of the
continued bleeding.

In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was found to have a Hct of 20--- it was 33.5 on
[**2181-8-25**]. Rectal exam showed melena. NG lavage was negative
showeing clear fluid and no bile. Pt denied any abdominal pain.
Pt's INR was 3.3 and she was given vit K 1 mg, 2U FFP, and 1U
PRBC. Her post-transfusion Hct was 22. Pt then had an EGD which
showed normal mucosa in the stomach, possible gastric inlet
patch 17 cm from incisors, 20 mm in diameter, erythematous and
not friable (unlikely to have caused her bleeding), normal
mucosa in the duodenum and spots in the stomach. After EGD, pt
desatted and became tachycardic to the 170s. She responded well
to a NRB and lasix.

In further discussion, pt had noted two "purple colored" stools
prior to admission and several maroon colored stools. She also
noted feeling week and fatigued. She has felt lightheaded for
approximately six months. Pt has had a significant weight loss
over the past few months from 130 to 90 pounds. She notes a
decrease in her appetite and intrest in activities since her
husband's death last year.


Past Medical History:
1. Hypertension
2. CHF- LVEF 20%
3. Mitral Regurgitation documented on prior echo
4. Recent ([**8-17**]) hospitalization for CP. This was felt to be
musculoskeletal.
5. Atrial fib- Diagnosed in [**1-17**] and thought to be secondary to
mitral regurgitation. Pt has been anticoagulated on coumadin.
6. Hemicolectomy 10 y ago for diverticular bleed. No malignancy
found, per pt.
7. Colonoscopy [**2176**]- Previous side to end ileo-colonic
anastomosis of the ascending colon
Polyp in the rectum (polypectomy)
Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and descending colon
Grade 2 internal hemorrhoids
Otherwise normal Colonoscopy to ascending colon.
8. S/P left hip replacement

Social History:
Lived with her husband until he passed away in [**Month (only) 359**]. Pt now
lives alone. Her sons and daughter-in-law are involved in her
care. Non-smoker. Occassional EtOH.

Family History:
Non-contributory.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with past medical history
significant for hypertension, atrial fibrillation on coumadin,
and congestive heart failure (ejection fraction of 20%) admitted
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**10-19**] with a Hct 20 down from 34 and INR 3.3. NG
lavage was clear without bile. An upper endoscopy was performed
which was negative for source of bleed and patient suffered post
procedure flash pulm edema which resolved with IV lasix. Patient
received another 2 units of PRBC with an appropriate increase in
her Hct. Pt received 40 mg IV lasix between these units of blood
and her respiratory status remained stable. Patient's hematocrit
remained stable with no further bleeding. Pt was transferred to
the floor on [**10-21**] for further care.
.
1. GI bleed- Patient presented with melanotic stools. Patient
was at high risk for bleed given anticoagulation with coumadin.
Negative NG lavage and no evidence of active bleeding on EGD
[**10-19**]. Differential diagnosis of lower source of bleeding
included diverticular bleed, AVM or internal hemorrhoids. A
colonoscopy was performed on [**10-22**] with diverticulosis of the
sigmoid and descending colon and grade 2 internal hemorrhoids
without active bleed. Per GI, colonscopy findings Were
nonbleeding but could have caused bleed per GI. Patient was
continued on IV protonix twice daily and her Hct was followed
every 6 hours with a transfusion threshold of Hct 30. Patient's
hematocrit remained stable after colonoscopy until day of
discharge.
.
2. [**Name (NI) 4964**] Pt with LVEF of 20%. Her respiratory status is stable at
this time but need to monitor closely for any fluid overload.
Will give IV lasix with any needed blood transfusions.
.
3. Atrial fib- Pt was well rate controlled. Since she was
hemodynamically stable and no evidence of further bleeding, she
was continued on her beta blocker. Coumadin was held. Patient
was not resumed on her coumadin at discharge given her risk of
GI bleed in the setting of recent bleed. She will follow-up with
her PCP and discuss long term plans for anti-coagulation.
.
4. HTN- Continued on beta blocker at this time as vitals stable
and no further active bleeding. Held lisinopril, CCB.
.
5. CAD- Continued on beta blocker given stable vitals but
holding ASA.
.
6. Ear bleeding- Traumatic in nature. Was irrigated in the ED
with removal of several clots. Scant bleeding since that time.
.
7. FEN- Full liquids. Electrolyte replacement as needed.
.
8. Proph- Pneumoboots; PPI
.
9. Code status- DNR/DNI.
