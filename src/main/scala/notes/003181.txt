History of Present Illness:
56 y/o man with PMH significant for "heart problems" admitted
through the ED for CAD and cardiac cath on [**2124-1-16**]. Pt
reports that he has had problems with his heart for the past
five years. He is unable to given any specifics. He reports that
he saw a physician at the urging of his wife when he first
developed chest "squeezing" five years ago and was prescribed SL
NTG. He has not seen a physician again for his cardiac issues
until establishing care at [**Hospital3 **]
approximately four weeks ago. In the interum, he continue to
have occasional chest pressure and took SL NTG for this that
relatives obtained for him from [**Name (NI) 651**]. He reports that during
this time he had intermittent chest pain but is unable to
describe exactly how often. It sounds like it occurred
approximately one time per month and was always relieved with SL
NTG.
.
At this time, the pt reports that he has had increasing episodes
of CP over the past two months. He reports that he has CP up to
three times per day but then will go for two to three days
without any pain. He describes the sensation as a pressure or
squeezing sensation over his substernal chest area and
occasionally radiates to his left arm. It is not associated with
any symptoms including SOB, diaphoresis, n/v, or syncope. He
reports that it is always relieved with one SL NTG. Pt reports
that it can occur both with exertion and at rest. It seems to
occur fairly frequently at night when he gets up to urinate. The
pt's most recent episode of CP occurred this morning when he was
walking to his physician's office. It was relieved with one SL
NTG. The physician then sent him to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care. In
pertinent recent history, the pt had a exercise MIBI at [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**1-9**] that showed a moderate reversible perfusion defects of the
inferior wall and septum.

Exercise MIBI ([**2125-1-9**]): Exercised for 7 min on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
protocol and stopped for fatigue. Developed mid-sternal chest
"tightness"with exercise that resolved with three minutes of
recovery. 0.5 mm ST segment depression in the anterolateral
leads that resolved by three minutes into recovery. MIBI images
showed a moderate reversible perfusion defects in the inferior
wall and septum suggestive of multi-vessel CAD. There was also
inferior wall hypokinesis with a calculated EF of 40%.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2125-1-12**] for further
management of his chest pain. He was taken to the
catheterization lab where he was found to have a diffusely
stenosed left main coronary artery, mid total occlusion of the
left anterior descending with retrograde filling via a diagonal
collateral, and a totally occluded right coronary artery after
the acute marginal, left ventricular ejection fraction of
45-50%. Given the severity of her disease, the cardiac surgical
service was consulted for surgical revascularization. She was
worked-up in the usual preoperative manner.  On [**2125-1-16**] he
successfully underwent CABGx4 (LIMA->LAD, SVG->Diag, SVG->OM).
Afterward he was transferred to the Cardiac surgery recovery
unit in stable condition and awakened neurologically intake.  On
POD 2 He was weaned from ventilator support, and extubated.  His
pressors were weaned and chest tubes removed.  He was then
transferred to the Stepdown unit for further recovery.  He was
gently diuresed to his preoperative weight, beta blockade and
aspirin therapy were resumed, and physical therapy service was
consulted to assist with her postoperative strength and
mobility.  On POD 3 his epicardial pacing wires were removed
without complication, he continued to improve his ability to
ambulate including climbing stairs without respiratory distress
or chest pain.  On POD 4 Mr. [**Known lastname **] was 3kg above his preop weight
with good exercise tolerance, no SOB, or Chest pain.  His blood
pressure was stable.  His sternotomy and leg incision were
clean, dry, and intact without evidence of infection.  He was
discharged home on POD 4 with services in good condition,
cardiac diet, sternal precautions, lasix 20mg po QD for 14 days,
and instructed to follow up with his PCP and cardiologist in [**1-8**]
weeks.  He will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in four weeks.
