Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 800**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered Mental Status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation [**2166-11-13**]
Extubation [**2166-11-15**]

History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 86 year old male with past medical history of
atrial fibrillation, not on anticoagulation, coronary artery
disease, COPD, chronic renal insufficiency, and recent resection
of transitional cell carcinoma who was found to be less
responsive today at his nursing home. Per report from the
emergency room, at baseline, patient has been confused at times
confused but conversant. Today patient was only responsive to
some commands and noxious stimuli.
.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] emergency room, his presenting vital
signs were 98.2, HR 76, BP 117/71, RR 18, and 100% on NRB. Per
discussion with emergency room staff, his mental status was so
poor there was considerable concern for airway protection, so he
was intubated. An ABG was completed after intubation on 100%
FiO2, which was 7.34 pCO2
54 pO2 440 HCO 30. A chest x-ray was completed, which was
concerning for possible RLL infiltrate. He received vancomycin
and zosyn. He also received a total of 2 liters of normal
saline. A head CT was completed which was negative for any acute
pathology. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis was also completed as
noted below. Blood and urine cultures were obtained. Per ED
notes, patient had transient hypotension after intubation,
resolved with IVFs. Bedside echocardiogram done without good
visualization, but no pericardial fluid visualized.
.
Upon arrival to the floor, patient was noted to be moving
extremities in response to tactile stimuli and calling of name.
.
History is obtained from ED, chart review, discussion with son,
and nursing home attending physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 24202**], as
patient is unable to provide any history.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is an 86 year old male with past medical history of
coronary artery disease status post bypass, atrial fibrillation,
chronic renal insufficiency, COPD, and bladder cancer who
presents from a nursing home with altered mental status,
intubated in the ED for airway protection.

#) Transitional cell carcinoma/ hematuria: Patient had recent
surgery for removal of transitional cell carcinoma. Per
discussion with son and [**Name2 (NI) 80283**] at the nursing home, patient
had had hematuria requiring re-admission. At time of admission,
patient was making good urine, however was noted to have dark
maroon colored urine with significant hematuria. Urology was
consulted the morning after admission, and in light of his
recent carcinoma resection, continuous bladder irrigation was
recommended and initiated. Pt continued to have CBI even while
on the floor. This was continued until his urine was no longer
bloody grossly on appearance, and was then discontinued upon
urology recommendations. His foley was also discontinued, and
the patient continued to have dark red urine. Urology said this
is expected with foley removal from dislodging clots. Pt was
watched overnight. The next morning the patient still had
hematuria, and Urology saw the patient. They were not concerned
and thought he should continue to improve since the clots have
become very infrequent. The foley was replaced so that these
final clots can be irrigatated and the patient is expected to
get better over the next week.
It is expected that the patient will continue to have hematuria
at time of discharge.
- foley should be kept in for at least 3 days, if the patients
urine returns to completely yellow it can be taken out at that
time, but the foley may be kept in place if pt continues to have
hematuria.
- please irrigate foley any time patient has blood clots or
urinary obstruction in the foley
- only if the clots become so severe that the urinary retention
does not improve from flushing the foley, or the urine becomes
very thick like tomatoe paste, only then should he return to the
hospital, and to call the patient's primary Urologist

#) Altered mental status: It was unclear what prompted the
patient's acute mental status change. Based on his initial
arterial blood gas post-intubation, it was supsected that there
was some degree of carbon dioxide retention secondary to his
COPD, which may have contributed in the setting of an infection.
Potential sources of infection included pulmonary given that his
CT appeared possibly consistent with an aspiration event,
urinary given his recent
