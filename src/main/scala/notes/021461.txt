continued to have copious secretions. He was weaned off

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 83 M with pancytopenia [**3-8**] MDS, h/o smoking,
bronchomalacia, chf, pulm htn, and recent [**Doctor First Name **] infection admitted
with respiratory failure.  After a 48 hour period of mechanical
ventilation, he was weaned from the ventilator and transferred
out of the ICU.

1. Respiratory Failure: multifactorial --> COPD, pneumonia due
to MAC and possibly other pathogens, possible CHF
-He was continued on antibiotics and nebulizer treatmetns.  Pt
had a bronchoscopy to further evaluate his bronchomalacia.  The
interventional pulmonologists found severe bronchitis upon
broncoscopy but nothing amenable to pulmonary stenting.


2. MAC Infection
   -continue ethambutol/claritrhomycin

3. Other bacterial pneumonia
   -continued on  levofloxacin for 7 day course

4. ARF: likely pre-renal azotemia [**3-8**] diuresis
   -diuretics were held, urine output was followed, and steadily
improved


5. MDS: transfusion dependent but stable
   -Pt was transfused two units of platelets for bronchoscopy
   -transfused for hct < 25
   -continued on danazol and erythropoietin


6. FEN: fluid goal even; QD lytes; low sodium/heart healthy diet

7. PPX: protonix, bowel regimen as needed, pneumoboots (NO
HEPARIN GIVEN MDS)

8. Code status: full --> had extensive discussions with family,
social work, and consultants.  Patient wished to receive
aggressive care.

9. Disposition: Rehabilitation stay was arranged.
