Chief Complaint:
Chief Complaint:  UGIB
.
Reason for MICU transfer:  post-arrest, intubated, on Levophed


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PEG tube, tracheostomy

History of Present Illness:
This is a 62yo M with h/o CHF, DM and peptic ulcer who now
presents with black, tarry stools all day and three episodes of
coffee ground emesis. A neighbor called EMS who brought the pt
into the ED.
.
In ED, initial VS were HR 68, RR 21, BP 92/53 and O2Sat 98%  Pt
denied CP, but had ST elevations w/ reciprocal changes on EMS
strip. ST elevation 1 mm in III and depressions in aVL on
initial EKG here.  Pt had coffee ground emesis, and an NGT
placed with return of same. Pt then became hypotensive to 78
systolic, and a R IJ cordis was placed due to lack of other
access.  Hct was 29 (baseline of 47 in [**4-/2139**]), wnl plts, INR
1.5.  Also, Cr is 1.8 (baseline 1.2 in [**2139**]).  Pt was then
getting blood with plans to be admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] when the pt
had a brady/PEA arrest.  CPR was performed for 5 min, during
which time he received Epi, Ca and additional blood.  Pt then
got pulses back.  During the code, pt was intubated, sedated. GI
plans to perform an emergent scope tonight to investigate the
etiology of his UGIB.  Pt has been given 2-3L NS and 6U pRBCs
total.  Also, started on Protonix bolus and gtt.  Currently,
also on Levophed gtt to support his pressures.  ED plan to give
pt [**Name (NI) **]/Zosyn to cover for possible aspiration pneumonia, given
the code.  Repeat EKG shows that ST elevations have resolved,
but still 1 mm depression aVL remains.  It is thought to be [**3-17**]
demand ischemia, with TnT of 0.04.
The post-arrest team evaluated pt and is considering cooling the
pt after GI performs EGD.  After intubation, pt desatted briefly
to low 80s, PEEP was incr PEEP to 12 and pt is now satting 100%.
 Pt has a cordis and two PIVs (18g and 20g) for access.  Also,
pt had an elev K (6.5) which improved to 4.8 after
insulin/glucose.  Pt also received Ca during the code. Of note,
lactate was 6.3, then 8.7 after code.  On transfer, VS were HR
105, BP 106/78, 100% on vent.
.
On arrival to the MICU, pt is sedated, intubated.  On minimal
sedation (Versed 1mg/hr), pt is not responsive to voice, sternal
rub.  Pt is responsive to painful stimuli in upper ext, not
lower.  Is not following commands.

IMAGING:
MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2140-8-16**] 10:47 AM
FINDINGS: The study is significantly limited by motion artifact.
However, the diffusion weighted images are diagnostic,
demonstrating no diffusion
abnormality to suggest an acute infarction.  The gradient echo
images are
nondiagnostic, limiting evaluation for hemorrhage. An area of
encephalomalacia in the left frontal lobe is unchanged from
[**2140-8-10**], compatible with a prior MCA territory infarct.
Prominent ventricles and sulci are unchanged and compatible with
global age-related volume loss.  Principal vascular flow voids
are preserved.  The mastoid air cells are opacified bilaterally.


IMPRESSION:
No evidence of acute infarction. Otherwise, a motion-limited
study.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2140-8-15**] 4:48 PM
FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the
monitoring and support devices are constant in position.

The pre-existing right basal opacity, with maximum in the
infrahilar area, is not substantially changed.  On the left,
there is decreased visibility of the left hemidiaphragm,
suggesting the appearance of either atelectasis or small left
pleural effusion.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.  The right
costophrenic sinus is unremarkable.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2140-8-10**] 8:27 AM
FINDINGS:  In the left frontal lobe, there is a region of
established
encephalomalacia.  The adjacent sulci are not effaced and there
is mild ex
vacuo ventricular dilatation, confirming that this relates to an
old
infarction.  There is no evidence acute vascul
