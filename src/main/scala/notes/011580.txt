Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Ace Inhibitors

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4765**]
Chief Complaint:
Lethargy, STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with Hx of CAD, HTN, HLD,
dementia (OX2 at baseline) who presented from home with lethargy
and dyspnea, which started this morning while going to the
bathroom (near pre-syncopal episode).
.
According to our records, the patient has a history of stable
angina- chest pressure and dyspnea occurring with exertion,
never rest, for which she underwent a stress MIBI in 09, which
was negative for symptoms or ischemic EKG changes, but nuclear
study revealed mild reversible inferior wall  defect. She was
started on ASA 81 daily, Metoprolol, and a low-dose statin. Per
report, the patient had stopped all of her medications about 6
months ago. This report is consistent with her documented
medical hx (her daughter is a naturopathic physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] the
patient would often discontinue traditional medications in favor
of herbal regimens).
.
Vitals on presentation to ED were pain 0, 99.4, 92, 159/86, 20,
99% on ? 4L via NC. EKG revealed Q waves in II, III and ST
segment elevations in II, III, avF, V5, V6. Troponin was
elevated at 5 (CK and CKMB flat). CXR had a small L-sided
pleural effusion, but no evidence of PNA. Cardiology consult
called- given ASA, Plavix, Heparin gtt. Became dyspneic and
hypertensive- repeat EKG showed improvement in V5/V6 STE, but
new TWI in V2/3. Repeat CXR unchanged and without evidence of
volume overload. Started on Nitro gtt 1mcg/kg/min (45 kg) with
subsequent improval in dyspnea. Also given 1 dose of Cipro out
of concern for UTI. Vitals prior to transfer 83, 134/82, 24, 98%
4LNC.
.
Of note, Pt presented to ED on [**2157-2-14**] c/o "not feeling well,"
was diagnosed with viral gastroenteritis (Vom/Diarrhea), and
sent home with instructions for supportive care.
.
ROS is difficult to obtain given the patient's current mental
status. She denies any pain or dyspnea currently. According to
her family, she has possible orthopnea (sleeps upright in
chair), dyspnea on exertion, and occasional chest pressure. No
recent fever or chills, cough or symptoms of infection.

DISCHARGE LABS:

.
STUDIES:
CXR [**2157-2-27**]:
IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of pulmonary edema.
Atelectasis and
retrocardiac distribution is stable compared with prior with a
possible small left pleural effusion.
.
TTE [**2157-2-28**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
severe hypokinesis of the inferior septum, inferior and
inferolateral segments. There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with moderate
global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction consistent
with inferior ischemia/infarction. Dilated and hypokinetic right
ventricle, suggestive of RV ischemia/infarction. At least
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE: [**Age over 90 **] yo W with HX of CAD, HTN, HLD presenting
with lethargy, found to have inferolateral ST segment elevations
and elevated cardiac biomarkers, transferred to CCU for medical
management of STEMI.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# GOALS OF CARE: Patient and family decided to pursue aggressive
measures to optimize comfort and quality of remaining life.
Palliative Care was consulted and patient, family, and medical
team all agreed that hospice care was the most appropriate means
to achieving our goals of comfort. The patient was discharged
with home hospice services.
.
# ST SEGMENT ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION: The patient has a
history of CAD. Exercise MIBI in [**7-16**] was without symptoms or
ischemic changes on EKG (performed 6 mins on mod [**Doctor Last Name 4001**]), but
nuclear portion revealed a mild reversible inferior wall defect.
EKG on presentation revealed Q waves & ST segment elevations in
Inferior/Lateral leads. Cardiac biomarkers were elevated. Given
her age and documented history of medication non-compliance, it
was decided not to pursue cardiac catheterization. She was
medically managed with a heparin gtt, aspirin, plavix, and
atorvastatin. She was started on a nitro gtt for dyspnea and
hypertension, which was weaned once her enzymes peaked. She was
started on Metoprolol, which was uptitrated to 50 daily. Given
her kidney function we did not begin an ace inhibitor. Heparin
gtt was off at 48 hours. She was discharged on ASA, Plavix,
Simvastatin, and Metoprolol.
.
# ISCHEMIC CARDIOMYOPATHY: The patient had no echocardiogram
prior to this admission. Clinically she did not appear volume
overloaded, with exception of mild lower extremity edema (per
report) of chronic duration. Post-infarct TTE demonstrated EF
30-35%, moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction consistent
with inferior ischemia/infarction in addition to dilated and
hypokinetic right ventricle, suggestive of RV
ischemia/infarction. She initially had poor urine output, which
improved with 250 cc boluses of IV hydration as necessary. Given
her RV involvement, and lack of heart failure symptoms, we did
not diurese her or start a diuretic at discharge.
.
# RHYTHM: Monitored on telemetry and remained in sinus rhythm.
.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Creatinine of 1.7 on admission.
