History of Present Illness:
PCP: [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 4844**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2425**], [**Company 94804**]

HPI: Ms. [**Known lastname 68181**] is an 82yo woman with h/o afib, COPD, recent
hospitalization [**Date range (1) 61523**] with shortness of breath, (treated for
pneumonia with levofloxacin for 10d (ended 3d ago) and COPD
flare with prednisone 5d course), and chronic low back pain on
oxycontin who presented to the ER today feeling drowsy and with
diarrhea.  very poor historian.  She has not had fever at home.
There are several calls to [**Date range (1) **] by her son, after which [**Name (NI) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2425**], NP called an ambulance to bring her in today.
.
Per [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] notes and ER staff there are questions of whether her
son has been giving her more than her prescribed oxycotnin
versus taking it himself (or selling).  Per [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] notes the
patient has been refusing all of her meds except oxycontin all
week, and her son has been giving her extra doses. She has also
been quite sleepy all week. Denies dysuria, cough, sob, abd
pain.
.
In the ER the patient was noted to be afebrile and in afib with
RVR at 160. Cards was called and recommended dilt drip. She
received 3LNS and was given potassium repletion and was started
on a dilt drip, which was able to bring her heart rate to
100-120s with an SBP of 100s. O2 sat 97-100% on 2LNC. She had a
WBC of 28. CXR was performed and revealed her prior pna seen on
CXR 3w ago. UA was negative for infection. Stool was not sent.
Blood cultures were drawn and she was given a dose of ctx and
azithro to cover for possible CAP before it was noted that her
infiltrate was unchanged from prior.
.
ROS: denies HA, states diplopia lasting a few seconds at a time
for last "month or so", lower back pain which is worse since
they lowered her oxycontin dose, not wearing bottom dentures
because gums are swollen and sore. no dysuria.
.


Past Medical History:
- chronic low back pain on oxycontin with oxycodone for
breakthrough
- HTN
- CAD with RCA stent: Pmibi in [**1-29**] showed  Mild, reversible
perfusion defects of the apical portions of the inferior and
inferolateral walls. Normal left ventricular cavity size and
systolic function.
- CHF due to valvular disease: mod AR and AS with severely
thickened AV, mild MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 20440**] deformity and
annular calcification.
.
- rheumatic heart disease followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]: echo [**9-28**]:
left atrium mildly dilated. [**Month/Year (2) 1192**] symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. [**Month/Year (2) 1192**]
aortic valve stenosis. [**Month/Year (2) **] (2+) aortic regurgitation.
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The mitral valve
shows characteristic rheumatic deformity. There is severe mitral
annular calcification. There is [**Month/Year (2) 1192**] thickening of the
mitral valve chordae. There is mild mitral stenosis. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.]  [**Month/Year (2) 1192**] pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Compared with the findings of the prior report
(tape unavailable for review) of [**2124-8-29**], the pulmonary
hypertension is worse, and the mitral regurgitation may be
better.
.
- tachy-brady syndrome s/p dual chamber pacer
- panic disorder
- COPD: last PFTs [**9-28**] showed TLC 2.76 (72%), DLCO 39%pred, FVC
1.61 (75%) with FEV1 1.18 (83%) and FEV1/FVC 111% pred.
- restrictive lung disease with scoliosis
- s/p TAH/BSO
- multinodular goiter
- hyperlipidemia
- chronic leg edema with venous stasis

Markedly limited study. There is still persistent opacity at the

medial right lung base which may be the residual of prior
infection or recurrent disease. No significant edema.

EKG: afib at 150, nl axis, ST depression in II, III, F,
downsloping ST depression in V5-6. ST depressions decreased in
size on repeat at rate 123 .

Brief Hospital Course:
82yo woman with CAD, rheumatic valve disease, COPD, afib,
tachy-brady syndrome s/p pacer, recent hospitalization [**Date range (1) 61523**]
where she was treated for pneumonia with levo and COPD flare
with prednisone.
.
MICU course:
# SIRS/diarrhea: The patient was admitted overnight to the MICU,
where she was found to be afebrile, in atrial fibrillation with
RVR, hypotensive with systolic BP in the 80s-90s, confused and
clearly dehydrated.  She was hydrated with normal saline
aggressively overnight, including 250cc boluses x 3 and a
continuous NS IV drip at 250cc per hour. CXR showed only
persistence of her known prior pneumonia. Blood cultures were
drawn and were pending. Stool cultures were sent for general
bacterial infection as well as C diff toxin and she was started
on Flagyl empirically and placed on contact precautions for
presumed C diff given her recent antibiotic exposure. On the
morning after admission, the patient was much improved
hemodynamically. Her urine output and blood pressure had
recovered to normal values and her acute renal failure as well
as hyponatremia both resolved after overnight hydration with NS.

# afib with RVR: She was continued on her sotalol and was
initially on a diltiazem drip for her atrial fibrillation,
however given her hypotensionand the fact that this was not
adequately controlling her HR this was stopped. Her heart rate
improved somewhat with hydration, dropping from the 140s to the
100-120s.  At approximately 4am, the patient spontaneously
converted to NSR and was atrial paced at a rate of 70. After
this time, her SBP remained in the 100-120s.

# CAD: Her initial EKG at rate 150s showed marked ST depression
in II, III, F and V5-6. On repeat EKG at rate of 120s, ST
depressions were still present but smaller.  After the patient
converted to NSR and was atrial paced at 70 ST depressions
resolved in II, III, and F but remained (although only 1-2mm) in
v5-v6. Notably the patient has known reversible inferior and
infer
