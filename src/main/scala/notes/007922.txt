Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Percocet / Tylenol

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2763**]
Chief Complaint:
progressive DOE x 3 days

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line placement
CPAP

History of Present Illness:
87 yoM with h/o AFib not on coumadin and SCC on the face s/p
resection, who presents with three days of progressive DOE. He
reports pink-tinged frothy sputum as well as chills, anorexia
and rhinorrhea, though he denies fever, Ha,
arhtralgias/myalgias, chest pain, emesis and diarrhea. He says
he "may have gained weight recently," though was at the doctor
on [**2203-12-22**] and seemed to be doing well. He denies weight loss
over the last several months. He also told the ED he had
increased urinary output.
.
In the ED, VS were T 100.3, BP 139/70, HR 124 in AFib, RR 16,
96% on NRB (85% RA, 95% 4LNC) on presentation. He was given ASA
325 mg, ibuprofen 400 mg Po, and levofloxacin 740 mg IV,
ceftriaxone 1 g IV, and vanco 1g IV for CAP. In the ED, BP was
initially in the 120's on admission but then dropped to 84/43;
it improved to the 110-120's with a IVF bolus. He got a total of
~2L betwen IVF and antibiotics. Blood cultures were sent. ABG
was not done. There was concern for an element of CHF with a BNP
> [**Numeric Identifier 3652**], though he was not diuresed in the ED because of the
concern for infection.
.
On arrival to the ICU, T 96.0, HR 92, BP 122/49, 92-96% NRB.
Initially there was concern for volume overload and he was given
lasix 20 mg IV. He also had some hemoptysis.

Pertinent Results:
Admission CXR (12/6/9):
SINGLE UPRIGHT FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: There is near-complete
opacification
of the left hemithorax, with some residual aeration noted in the
upper lung.
Air-bronchogram is the mid lung suggests a component of
air-space
consolidation with probable increased effusion. The right
hemithorax is
normally aerated. There is no pneumothorax. No large pleural
effusion is
noted on the right. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
incompletely assessed
secondary to the left hemithorax opacification. There is
unchanged
calcification in the aortic knob.
IMPRESSION: Interval near-complete opacification of the left
hemithorax,
compatible with a large left-sided pleural effusion and likely
consolidation.
.
12/7/9 echo:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35 %). The
right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global
free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2199-10-11**], biventricular systolic function is now
seen.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
The left ventricular ejection fraction is <40%, a threshold for
which the patient may benefit from an ACEI or [**Last Name (un) **]
.
12/7/9 CT chest:
1)Diffuse dense left lung consolidation and collapse with
extensive airway
occlusion, likely due to infectious pneumonia and coexisting
atelectasis from retained secretions. Correlation with
bronchoscopy may be helpful to clear secretions and to exclude a
fixed endoluminal lesion. No definite hilar mass but assessment
limited by absence of IV contrast.
2)Focal consolidation in the right upper lobe also likely due to
infection but attention to this area on follow up imaging
recommended to ensure resolution.
3)Coronary artery, aortic valve and mitral annulus
calcification.
4)Gallstones
.
[**1-1**] CXR:
There is slight improvement of the left lung consolidation
although
significant amount of consolidation is still involving most of
the left lung with some minimal sparing of the lateral portion
of the left lower lobe. The right upper lobe is entirely
consolidated but the right lower lung appears to be relatively
clear. There is potentially present left pleural effusion.
There is no pneumothorax. Multiple abnormalities might be
further evaluated by chest CT if clinically warranted.
.
[**1-5**] CXR:
Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged with cardiac size top
normal.
Multifocal consolidations have continuously improved. Still they
are greater on the right upper lobe and left lower lobe. If any,
there is a small left pleural effusion. There is no
pneumothorax.
.
[**1-11**] CXR:
Left PICC tip is in the proximal SVC. Cardiomediastinal contours
are obscured by the lung abnormalities. Multifocal
consolidations are unchanged as does a left pleural effusion.
There are lower lung volumes . There is no evident
pneumothorax.
.
[**1-16**] CXR:
HISTORY: Pneumonia, to evaluate for change.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**1-14**], the patient has
taken a
somewhat better inspiration. The degree of left perihilar
opacification,
retrocardiac opacification, and perihilar opacification on the
right is
similar. There may be some increase in the right upper lobe
opacification
when compared to the prior study.

PICC line position is unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] is an 87yoM, with a PMH significant for AFib not on
coumadin and SCC on the face s/p resection, who presented to the
MICU with complete white out of left lung.
.
#. UNILATERAL PLEURAL EFFUSION: This was thought to be due to a
pneumonia given the unilateral nature of the effusion;
parapneumonic effusion as most likely diagnosis. Given smoking
history and degree to which whole lung is affected,
post-obstructive PNA (due to malignancy) was considered as a
possibility too. Less likely CHF b/c of left-sided unilateral
nature, although the pt appeared to have element of volume
overload with peripheral edema and response to lasix. It seems
of relatively short onset, given that the patient had a normal
PEat PCP's office four days prior to
