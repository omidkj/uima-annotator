Admission Date:  [**2198-7-16**]     Discharge Date:  [**2198-7-24**]

Date of Birth:   [**2129-7-30**]     Sex:  F

Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient presented at an
outside hospital for foot issues.  She had a left heel ulcer
and an anterior left plantar ulcer.  At the outside hospital,
she developed [**9-26**] substernal chest pain while in chest x-ray
for a low-grade fever.  The patient had no concomitant
shortness of breath but positive fever, diaphoresis, negative
dizziness.  This happened in the setting of cough and dry
heaves, the latter of which had been happening for two months
since her recent discharge.  The patient was treated at the
outside hospital with sublingual nitroglycerin and heparin
without pain relief.  The patient was also started on
morphine and a nitroglycerin drip which achieved pain relief.

The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for EKG changes and
chest pain and was admitted to be sent to the Catheterization
Laboratory on [**2198-7-16**].  The patient was pain-free on
admission.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  General:  The patient was
an elderly woman in mild distress.  Vital signs:  Heart rate
55, blood pressure 118/36, respiratory rate 37 with shallow
breathing, 02 saturation 99% on 1 liter.  Skin:  Positive for
marked pallor.  HEENT:  Dry mucous membranes, EOMI.  Heart:
Harsh [**4-22**] holosystolic murmur, no gallops or rubs.  Lungs:
Bibasilar crackles to a third of the way up, otherwise CTAP.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, scaphoid, with
positive bowel sounds. Extremities:  Left heel ulcer, left
anterior plantar ulcer, 1+ bilateral pedal pulses.  Neck:
Bilateral transmitted heart murmur.  No bruits appreciated.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  On admission, EKG showed sinus
rhythm at 57 beats per minute with ST depressions and
inverted T waves in V4 through V6.

The laboratories on admission were unremarkable in terms of
cardiac enzymes.  The patient ruled out for a MI.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for
catheterization for chest pain, anginal symptoms.  She went
to catheterization first on [**2198-7-16**].  The results were
(1)  Native three vessel coronary artery disease.  (2)
Occluded SVG to RCA, occluded SVG to OM1 and OM2.  (3)
Significant stenosis of LIMA, LAD.  (4)  Abdominal
aortography.  (5)  Severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
(6)  Successful stenting of occluded SVG to OM1 and OM2.

After catheterization, it was planned to repeat
catheterization in the next day for stenting of LIMA to LAD
and left main.  The patient developed chest pain after the
first catheterization and was taken back to the
Catheterization Laboratory for a re-look.  The second
catheterization results on [**2198-7-16**] revealed final diagnosis:
(1)  Three vessel coronary artery disease.  (2)  Patent SVG
to OM1 and OM2 that had been placed prior that day.  (3)
Severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.  (4)  Successful
stenting of LIMA to LAD.  (5)  Successful stenting of the
native left main artery.

After catheterization, the patient developed shortness of
breath and was sent to the CCU.  The patient was transferred
back to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] on [**2198-7-19**].  The patient had an echocardiogram
while she was in the CCU.  The results of the echocardiogram
on [**2198-7-17**]:  (1)  Left atrium is mildly dilated.  (2)  Left
ventricular cavity size is normal.  There is moderate global
left ventricular hypokinesis with posterior akinesis.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is difficult to
assess but is probably moderately depressed.  (3)  Aortic
valve leaflets are mildly thickened.  (4)  Mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened, moderate 2+ MR is seen.  (5)
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Chest x-rays while in the CCU showed bilateral patchy
opacities that could represent worsening pulmonary edema and
increase in retrocardiac opacities that suggested parenchymal
infiltrate which raised the suspicion for ARDS.  This report
was dated [**2198-7-18**].

Repeat x-ray, AP and lateral, on [**2198-7-19**], showed no change
in diffuse bilateral patchy airspace process since [**07**] hours
prior.

After admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**], the patient had shortness of breath
with respiratory rate in the 30s and an oxygen requirement of
up to 4.5 liters by nasal cannula.  With treatment of
Levaquin 250 mg p.o. q.d. renally dosed (and diuresis), the
patient slowly regained pulmonary function with decreased
need for nasal cannula oxygen, eventually being able to be
weaned off of oxygen and improvement in clinical examination.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged in good condition to
home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Pneumonia.
2.  Unstable angina, status post stent times three.
3.  Congestive heart failure.
4.  Coronary artery disease.
5.  Diabetes mellitus type 2.
6.  Pedal ulcers.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Atorvostatin 40 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5.  Reglan 10 mg p.o. p.r.n. nausea.
6.  Norvasc 5 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. q.d. times two days.
8.  Metoprolol 100 mg SR q.d.
9.  Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.d.
10. Furosemide 80 mg p.o. q.d.
11. Metformin SR 500 p.o. q.d.

FOLLOW-UP: The patient was recommended to follow-up with her
cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], within one to two weeks and her
primary medical doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for diabetes control
within one to two weeks.  The patient was recommended to use
former regimen of Metformin but consult with diabetologist
for optimization of regimen.
