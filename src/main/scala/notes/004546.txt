Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
ED CODE STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
passed [**2156-5-23**]

History of Present Illness:
88 year old woman with past medical history significant for
hypertension, atrial fibrillation not on anticoagulation, prior
tobacco use and dementia who was sent from her nursing home
because of nausea, chest discomfort and "not feeling well."  Of
note, she was recently started on levaquin for pneumonia on [**5-17**].
 At the [**Hospital1 1501**] she was noted to have SaO2 76-93% on room air and
93% on 2L nasal cannula.  An ECG en route was concerning for ST
elevations in V4-6 and she recieved ASA 81mg x4 and lasix 40mg
IV.

In the ED at [**Hospital1 18**] the STEMI team was activated.  The patient
recieved IV heparin bolus and IV integrilin bolus and was given
plavix 600mg po x1 but she was not able to swallow the pills,
and spit them out.  She was briefly on a nitro gtt.  An ECG
showed small lateral ST elevations in V4-6 and poor R wave
progression.  Her vital signs were stable and she was in no
distress.  The patient was denying any complaints of chest
discomfort, nausea, or diaphoresis and was oriented only to
self.  After confirmation with the [**Hospital1 1501**] that this is her baseline
mental status the decision was made to medically manage her
likely small STEMI.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course:
88 year old woman with hypertension, prior tobacco use, and
dementia being treated for pneumonia now presenting with an
episode of nausea and chest discomfort that has fully resolved,
found to have STEMI on ECG and positive cardiac biomarkers.
Given that she is pain free and hemodynamically stable the
decision was made not to take her to the catheterization lab for
coronary angiography at this time because of questionable
long-term mortality benefit in this elderly, demented woman.
The patient is a poor historian and it is unclear how long she
may have been experiencing symptoms since her cardiac enzymes
are already elevated at presentation.

CCU course.  Patient had echo that showed severe regional and
global left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD and
another concomitant process (tachycardia-related, metabolic,
etc), mild regional right ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w
CAD, moderate to severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and
moderate pulmonary hypertension.  Cr elevated, urine lytes c/w
prerenal and so patient received ivfs.  Patient was kept on a
heparin gtt, plavix, aspirin, lipitor, metoprolol and
lisinopril.  She was started on dilt gtt for rate control.
Subsequent day, after a long discussion with her son, patient
was made [**Name (NI) 3225**] and the focus was turned toward comfort measures.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] passed [**5-23**].
