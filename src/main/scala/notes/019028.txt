History of Present Illness:
HPI per daughter
77 y.o. Italian speaking woman with multiple medical problem who
was discharged from [**Hospital 100**] rehab 1 day PTA, and presented from
home with respiratory distress.  She apparently had multiple
failed swallow tests but was reportedly had been advanced to
pureed diet at rehab. She returned to home after a pureed diet
meal and reportedly did not have anything else after arriving
home. She is minimally communicative at baseline.  She was only
home for several hours before she developed shortness of breath
and had to go to the hospital.
In ED, her initial vitals were P142 BP191/101 R27 76% NRB. She
was started on vanco/levo/flagyl.  Her CXR was clear.  Due to
persistent hypoxia on the NRB, the trachea was intubated.  Pt
was continued on levaquin and flagyl but vanco was d/c'd.  She
had a low grade fever of 99.9 on initial presentation.  She was
extubated on [**11-17**], and respiratory status has been stable all
day.  In addition, she became agitated that evening, which per
the family is her usual pattern.

She was admitted in [**8-22**] with altered MS with a negative workup
that included CT head, EEG, LP.  At the time she had a failed
swallow eval and a PEG was placed for nutrition.
