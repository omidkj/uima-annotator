Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain/distention

History of Present Illness:
63 year old woman with C5 tetraplegic s/p (MVA 30 years ago).
Patient
has baseline partial ventilation dependence at night. She has
had multiple prior obdominal surgeries with use of the abdominal
wall bilaterallt for tissue transfers. She had been admitted and
managed medically earlier this
month for SBO (d/c'd [**8-15**]). She re-presented on this occasion
with increased abdominal distention that had progressed
throughout the day on [**8-16**] and resulted in her going to [**Hospital 6451**] hospital, There she had a CT that showed a distal SBO
and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

Past Medical History:
C5 quadraplegic s/p MVA has chronic trach with ventilator
dependence at night. Anemia, recurrent UTIs, active decubiti R
ischium. suprapubic tube, hyponatremia, s/p bladder augmentation
using a cecal pedicle, L hip recurrent decubiti s/p use of
abdominal wall flaps for treatment of chronic L hip
osteomyelitis, now with VAC treatment. History of adrenal
insufficiency.


Social History:

her primary caretaker

ABDOMEN (SUPINE ONLY)  [**2119-8-17**] 3:15 AM
Dilated loops of small bowel suggestive of small-bowel
obstruction. Limited evaluation of the colon and intrapelvic
loops of bowel.

[**2119-8-17**] [**2119-8-18**]
Segment of small intestine with diffuse acute serositis
extending to one resection margin; submucosal acute
inflammation, edema, and vascular congestion with focal
hemorrhage are also present.

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST, CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2119-8-23**] 12:50 PM

1. Multifocal pneumonia demonstrated by tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities
diffusely bilaterally and consolidation and volume loss within
the right greater than left lower lobe.
2. Small 6 mm left lower lobe pulmonary nodule. Recommend
followup CT following resolution of pneumonia.
3. Mediastinal, hilar, and subclavicular lymphadenopathy.
Although this may be related to pneumonia, given the size and
distribution of this lesion, other etiology should be considered
such as lymphoma or sarcoid. Recommend correlating with
patient's clinical history.
4. Tiny liver hypodensities in segment II and segment VII that
are not completely characterized. Further evaluation with MRI or
multiphasic CT is suggested if clinically indicated.
5. Moderate ascites.
6. Diffuse small bowel wall thickening. This finding is fairly
nonspecific, however the most likely possibility is diffuse
edema secondary to third spacing, which is consistent with
surrounding ascites.
7. Mild-to-moderate right hydronephrosis and hydroureter.
8. Ill defined heterogeneous area within the region of the
patient's neobladder on the right side. The differential
includes collapsed segment of an ileal pouch, cervical or lower
uterine segment mass, or bladder mass. A fluoroscopic evaluation
of the neobladder could be performed to evaluate for bladder
mass. A pelvic ultrasound could further delinate the location of
this lesion.

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2119-9-3**] 11:44 AM

1. Distended fluid-filled colon raises the possibility of
superficial colitis. No wall thickening or evidence of
transmural colon disease.
2. Persistent collapse of the lower lobes bilaterally.
3. Improved peribronchial inflammatory changes in the right
middle lobe and tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] centrilobular inflammatory opacities
in the upper lobes bilaterally.
4. Decrease in size in mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
5. Hypodensities in the liver are too small to be characterized.
6. Ascites.
7. Mild improvement in small bowel wall thickening.
8. Unchanged mild-to-moderate hydronephrosis on hydroureter.
9. Stable ill-defined heterogeneously enhancing area in the
region of the patient's neobladder on the right
