[**2162-12-17**] - Cr 3.6 from a peak of 3.9

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on the day of surgery. His
intraoperative course was uneventful. Please refer to the
operative report of [**2162-12-13**] for further details of the
procedure. He received 3 liters of intraveous fluids during
surgery and was admitted to the PACU for recovery. While in the
PACU, he failed extubation.

A chest xray, EKG and cardiac enzymes exams were obtained. The
patient's chest xray showed borderline vascular congestion. The
EKG revealed left axis shift that was different that the
pre-operative EKG. A cardiology consultation was requested in
light of the patient's cardiac history. After discussion with
the cardiology fellow, a careful decision was made to diurese
the patient with 10mg of IV furosemide. He diuresed 500ml and
his arterial blood gas measurements improved. He was admitted to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for mechanical ventilation and close monitoring. Three
sets of cardiac enzymes were all within normal limits.

By the morning of post-operative day (POD)#1, the patient was
comfortable on CPAP. He was weaned of CPAP and was transferred
out of the ICU on 3 liters oxygen via nasal cannula, mentating
and feeling well.

On POD#2, the pt. complained of mild intermittant pain for which
he refused pain medication adjustment. He ambulated with
physical therapy and did very well. He was weaned of oxygen and
was saturating at 92% on room air. His chest tube was placed to
water seal but was subsequently reconnected to suction after
chest x-ray revealed a larger R apical pneumothorax. Overnight,
the patient desaturated to 85% on room air and was placed on
oxygen therapy, which brought his saturation up to 95% on 2
liters oxygen. He was given an additional 5mg IV of furosemide x
2, and this seemed to improve his breathing.

On POD#3, he passed flatus and was advanced to a regular diet
without incident. He was ambulating and breathing well. He was
replaced on all of his home medications.

The patient was observed while asleep given his desaturations at
night. He was noted to have a fairly loud snore with
intermittant pauses in respirations, consistent with obstructive
sleep apnea. The urology team is recommending follow-up with the
patient's primary care physician to have this issue addressed.

On POD#4, the patient was relieved of his foley catheter and he
voided.  His [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drainage was sent for creatinine,
which came back 76, consistent with a urine leak from his
partial nephrectomy bed.  To maximize drainage of urine, a 16F
Foley catheter was replaced with ease.

He was discharged on POD#5 in stable condition with the Foley
and J-P drains in place with Visiting nurse set-up for ongoing
care.  He was given instructions to follow up in clinic with
both his primary care physician and with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
