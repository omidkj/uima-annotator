[**2148-11-18**] ECHO
1.The left atrium is normal in size. The left atrium is
elongated. The right atrium is moderately dilated.
2.Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity
size is normal. There is moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is moderately depressed. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic
function may be more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Resting regional wall motion abnormalities
include inferior, lateral, distal septal, inferolateral and
apical hypokinesis.
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a
minimally
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.

[**2148-11-18**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Selective coronary angiography showed a right dominant system
with
severe three vessel disease. The LMCA had an ostial 90%
stenosis. The
LAD wrapped around the apex had had a proximal 90% and 70%
stenosis. The
mid and distal LAD was diffusely diseased. The LCX had a mid 90%

stenosis. The OM1 was subtotally occluded and OM2 had a 90%
stenosis.
The RCA was proximally occluded and filled via right to right
and left
to right collaterals.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics showed a normal central aortic
pressure (AO mean 81 mmHg). There was no gradient across the
aortic
valve. The LVEDP was severely elevated (LVEDP 37 mmHg).
3. An IABP was inserted via the right femeral artery using a
long 8F
sheath. The iliac arteries were tortuous.

[**2148-11-19**] Carotid Duplex Ultrasound
Mild plaque/wall thickening is present in the carotid arteries
bilaterally. However, there is no significant carotid stenosis
on either side (evaluated as less than 40% stenosis
bilaterally).

[**2148-11-19**] Renal Ultrasound
Bilateral renal cysts. No evidence of normal renal parenchyma.
Underlying masses cannot be excluded.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2148-11-17**] for further
management of chest pain. He was treated with lasix, heparin and
lopressor were started. The renal service was consulted given
his creatinine of 6.1. It was assumed that he would likely need
to start hemodialysis post cardiac catheterization. On [**2148-11-18**] a
cardiac catheterization was performed. This revealed a 90%
stenosed left main, a 90% stenosed left anterior descending
artery, a 90% stenosed circumflex, a 90% stenosed obtuse
marginal and an occluded right coronary artery. Given the
severity of his disease, an intra-aortic ballon pump was placed
for coronary perfusion. The cardiac surgical service was
consulted for surgical management and Mr. [**Known lastname **] was worked-up in
the usual preoperative manner. An echocardiogram was performed
which showed an ejection fraction of 30-35% and 2+ mitral
regurgitation. A carotid duplex ultrasound was performed which
revealed mild (<40%)plaque/wall thickening present in the
carotid arteries bilaterally. A renal ultrasound was also
performed which showed Bilateral renal cysts, no evidence of
normal renal parenchyma and underlying mass could not be
excluded. Mr. [**Known lastname **] continued to have episodes of atrial
fibrillation which was treated with beta blockade. Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 8783**]t hemodialysis on [**2148-11-19**] prior to cardiac surgery. On
[**2148-11-20**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room where he
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to four vessels and a
mitral valve repair. Postoperatively he was taken to the cardiac
surgical intensive care unit for monitoring. On postoperative
day one, Mr. [**Known lastname **] again underwent hemodialysis to remove fluid.
He underwent a bronchoscopy for secretions. The transplant
service was consulted as his fistula appeared to be clotted off.
A fistulogram was performed with angiodilation of an outflow
stenosis. Mr. [**Known lastname **] continued to have runs of atrial
fibrillation and amiodarone was started. On postoperative day
two, Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**] neurologically intact and was extubated. He
again underwent hemodialysis. On postoperative day three,
heparin was started for anticoagulation for his atrial
fibrillation (Coumadin was started shortly thereafter). Mr.
[**Known lastname **] continued to undergo daily hemodialysis for fluid
management. The physical therapy service was consulted for
assistance with his postoperative strength and mobility. He was
transfused for postoperative anemia. On postoperative day seven,
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to the cardiac surgical step down unit
for further recovery. A revision was made to his AV fistula by
the transpla
