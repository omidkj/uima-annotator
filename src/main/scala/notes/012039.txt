Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was placed on levofloxacin for treatment of
pneumonia with some improvement in mental status. The patient
has a history of SVT as above and on the evening following
admission, she was found to be tachycardic to 179 with BP
103/66. The patient was transferred to the MICU given her
persistent hypotension in the setting of tachycardia. The
patient was placed on diltiazem gtt but could not tolerate the
transition to oral diltiazem. In the MICU, goals of care were
readdressed with Ms. [**Known lastname 6823**] healthcare proxy, son [**Name (NI) **], and
her other children who were present. It was felt that her
previously stated wishes were for no invasive measures. Ms.
[**Known lastname **] had one witnessed episode of agitation, wherein she
expressed to her children "Let me go." The family declined the
option of DC cardioversion. The family declined placement of an
NG tube for nutritional support. Goals of care were transitioned
to comfort measures only. Antibiotics were discontinued. She
remained comfortable with morphine boluses as needed. A
lidocaine patch was applied to the painful area of her back in
the area of compression fracture of the mid thoracic spine.
