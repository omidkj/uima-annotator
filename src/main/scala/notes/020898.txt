Pertinent Results:
[**2149-11-20**] Intraop TEE: Pre-Bypass: The left atrium is mildly
dilated. The right atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the left or right atrium. There
is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular
free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is
markedly dilated with normal free wall contractility. There is
abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular volume overload.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. There are
simple atheroma in the ascending aorta, aortic arch and in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Severe pulmonic
regurgitation is seen.
Post-Bypass: The patient is in SR on a phenylephrine and
epinephrine infusion s/p pulmonary valve replacement and
triscuspid ring annuloplasty.
Left ventricular function is preserved with an estimated
EFR>55%. The right ventricle remains dilated and mildly
depressed. There is a well seated #27 bioprosthetic pulmonary
valve. There is no evidence of perivalvular leak. There is no
pulmonic regurgitation. Peak/mean gradients are [**4-28**] at a CO of
4.3. Tricuspid regurgitation is no longer present. Peak/ mean
gradients are [**3-27**]. There is no echocardiographic evidence of
aortic dissection s/p decannulation. The remainder of the exam
is unchanged.
.
Echo [**2149-11-25**]: Overall left ventricular ejection fraction
appears normal (LVEF 57%) (by fractional area change measurement
in the short axis window) during intrinsic conduction. The right
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular
cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility. There
is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. However, the degree of
ventricular interaction appears reduced compared to the prior
study. There is no pericardial effusion. During right
ventricular apical pacing, marked pacing-induced left
ventricular mechanical dyssynchrony is seen, with a reduction of
left ventricular ejection fraction to approximately 45 percent
(by fractional area change measurement in the short axis
window).
.
Chest X-ray [**2149-11-25**]: As compared to the previous radiograph,
the left pectoral generator has been changed. There is one lead
projecting over the right ventricle and one over the right
atrium. No evidence of pneumothorax. Borderline size of the
cardiac silhouette. No pulmonary edema. No other acute lung
parenchymal changes.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 107971**] was a same day admit and on [**2149-11-20**] was brought to
the operating room where he underwent a redo-sternotomy,
pulmonic valve replacement, tricuspid valve repair and partial
ICD lead removal. Please see operative note for surgical
details. Following surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for
invasive monitoring in stable condition. Within 24 hours he was
weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated.
He remained on pressors for several days and were eventually
weaned. He remained in the ICU with both epicardial wires and
transcutaneous pacer pads on patient while he awaited a new ICD
placement. On post-op day four he underwent an AICD placement.
Following procedure he was transferred to the step-down floor
for further care. Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were
removed per protocol. He continued to work with physical therapy
for strength and mobility while making good progress. On post-op
day six he was ready for discharge home with VNA services and
the appropriate medications and follow-up appointments.
