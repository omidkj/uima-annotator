History of Present Illness:
77 year old male with DM2, hypertension, COPD, and prostate
cancer s/p prostatectomy who presented with progressively
worsening shortness of breath.  He had worsening shortness of
breath at home, not responding to nebulizer treatments so was
brought in by ambulance to the ED.  Denies any fever or cough at
home, no chest pain. Of note, patient is frequently hospitalized
with asthma/COPD exacerbations, most recently on [**2-17**] at [**Hospital1 **], and has been on a steroid taper since then.  Because
of his frequent hospitalizations, he and his PCP have been
considering a stay in pulmonary rehab in the near future,
however he has not gone yet.
.
In the ED initally RR 46 and pt appeared to be in distress,
although maintaining O2 sat in the mid 90s on nonrebreather.  Pt
received methylprednisolone IV 125 mg, azithromycin 500 gm IV,
albuterol and ipratroprium nebss and foley was placed.  He was
placed on BiPAP, ABG on BiPAP showed 7.29/61/139/31, pH improved
from 7.22 prior to BiPAP started although no full ABG from that
point.  Appeared mroe comfortable on BiPAP as well and RR
improved to 20s.  Attempted to wean off BiPAP however RR
increased to 40s again and pt became tachycardic so was placed
on BiPAP again prior to transfer.
.
On arrival to the ICU, pt complains of pain in his L ankle,
which is chronic and stable, otherwise has no complaints.
Appears comfortable on BiPAP.

IMAGING:
CXR: FINDINGS: The view is lordotic. The heart is at the upper
limits of normal
size. The aorta is moderately tortuous. The mediastinal and
hilar contours
appear unremarkable. There is a patchy opacity in the right
costophrenic
sulcus, probably atelectasis, although it is difficult to
exclude a small
pleural effusion. No definite pleural effusion is seen, however.
There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: No definite acute disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
77 year old male with type 2 diabetes on metformin,
hypertension, chronic lung disease (COPD vs asthma vs. partially
steroid-responsive ILD), and prostate cancer s/p prostatectomy
admitted with shortness of breath due to an exacerbation of the
patient's chronic lung disease.

#COPD/asthma exacerbation/exacerbation of chronic underlying
lung disease:
The patient was initially admitted to the Intensive Care Unit
and treated with BIPAP in addition to steroids and azithromycin
for respiratory acidosis. CXR showed no obvious infiltrate and
it was felt that the patient was experiencing a flare of his
underlying lung disease. He improved on bronchodilators,
steroids, and azithromycin. In discussion with the patient's
[**Month/Day/Year 19039**] Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], it is unclear what the patient's
underlying lung disease is as he does not have significant
obstruction on his PFTs and does have some restriction. Given
his repeated admissions and improvement with steroids it is
possible that the patient has another steroid responsive
underlying lung disease such as chronic eosinophillic pneumonia
or ILD. The patient was discharged on a 2 week prednisone taper
and will follow up with PCP and Pulmonology shortly after
completion of taper for further evaluation. The patient was
continued on PPI and started on Calcium/vitamin D as he is on
steroid taper often. PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] was deferred based on converation
with the patient's [**Name9 (PRE) 19039**] Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. He was continued on
his home Advair as well as anti-allergic regimen including
flonase nasal spray and fexofenadine.

#Chronic diastolic heart failure/Hypertension/Hyperlipidemia:
It was not felt that the patient's acute respiratory illness was
due to decompensated heart disease and he was continued on his
maintenance diuretics, home antihypertensives and statin.

#Anemia: baseline Hct 29-30. This was stable and there was no
evidence of bleeding.

#Stage III chronic kidney disease: Baseline Cr 1.2-1.4. Remained
stable through admission
.
#Type 2 diabetes mellitus: Patient was continued on metformin
and sliding scale insulin was
