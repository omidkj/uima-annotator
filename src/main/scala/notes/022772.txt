Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9240**]
Chief Complaint:
PEA arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
L subclavian central line sterilly placed
Endotracheal tube placement
OG tube placement

History of Present Illness:
85 year old F w/MMP including complete heart block s/p pacer,
severe AS, AAA, asthma, hx DVT, CAD tranferred urgently to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
for apnea and cardiac arrest. She had just been admitted from ED
to floor for 1 week of productive cough, dyspnea, confusion
including visual hallucinations, and an 02Sat of 88% RA. At that
time VS were noted to be stable: BP 102/47, HR 73, T 96.9 RR 18
96% on 4L.
.
Approximately 30min after her admission, she was found to be
unresponsive, pulseless and apneic. Code Blue was called, CPR
initiated. She had some electrical activity on the monitor, and
had no pulse. Compressions continued; the pt was intubated.
After Epi X2, atropine X1, and cardiac compressions, pt regained
pulse with a BP 105/50. ABG prior to intubation 7.20/ pCO2 92/
pO2 29 /HCO3 38. She was then transferred to ICU for further
management.


Past Medical History:
1) Aortic stenosis: last echo [**6-16**] with EF > 55%, severe AS
(worse than prior echo)
2) Rheumatoid arthritis (followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Rheum, on
methotrexate)
3) asthma
4) HTN
5) LLE DVT
6) Pneumonia
7) Anemia of chronic disease
8) CAD
9)h/o thrombocytopenia of unknown etiology (negative HIT, and
SRA)
10) Areflexive bladder (requiring chronic foley)


Social History:
Lives with daughter. [**Name (NI) **] EtOH/Tob/IVDU


Family History:
Non-contributory

Physical Exam:
105/60 74, paced AC 450x20 98% on 40% FiO2
Gen: Chronically ill appearing elderly female, intubated
HEENT: anicteric, MMM, pupils fixed and dilated 1 day post
arrest, then became responsive
NECK: Supple, shotty LAD, JVP not appreciated, but prominent EJ

CV: Paced. no S3 or S4. III/VI SEM best at USB though heard
throughout precordium; difficult to appreciate an S2.
LUNGS: Wheezes bilaterally, decreased BS
ABD: Soft, NT, protuberant hernia. NL BS. No HSM or pulsatile
mass.
EXT: 2+ tense edema, equal.
SKIN: flaking skin on legs
NEURO: intubated, not responsive, moving all extremities. Triple
flexion response to plantar reflex. Pupils 4-->3, equal (were
unresponsive immediately after code).


Pertinent Results:
[**2149-11-29**] 10 PM CXR: IMPRESSION: Interval placement of
endotracheal tube with distal tip in appropriate position. The
previously noted patchy opacity in the lateral left lung base is
not included on the current radiograph secondary to positioning.

.
[**2149-11-29**] PA and lat CXR: IMPRESSION: Small left pleural effusion
and left retrocardiac opacity representing atelectasis versus
pneumonia. Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
.
[**2149-11-30**] CT: wet read - head negative for acute process; CTA
chest negative for PE or dissection. ? low lung volumes in left
chest and left ventricular mass that could be LVH. Abdominal
scan notable for hernia; no acute change in AAA; no ascites.
.
ECG: a-sensed, v-paced at 74 bpm, wide QRS.


Brief Hospital Course:
MICU Course:
  The etiology of the patient's PEA arrest was not obvious. She
was rescuscitated, and transferred to ICU when stabilized. In
the ICU, a R subclavian was ultimately placed - the patient had
very difficult access. A CXR ruled out a pneumonthorax. The ECG
showed normal voltage, though paced, making tamponade less
likely. The CTA was  without evidence of PE. The cardiac enzymes
were not suggestive of an acute MI. Cardiology was consulted.
Interrogation of the pacer revealed that at approximately the
time of the incident, she had a 13 minute episode of atrial
tachycardia suggestive of afib; however, there was no way to
know for certain what rhythm she was in. It was felt that,
perhaps, afib coupled with underlying severe AS may have
resulted in hypoxia leading to PEA arrest. Once resucitated, she
was able to maintain a BP without pressors, and remained
intubated.
  However, she did not regain her mental status over the
subsequent days despite being on minimal sedation (0.5 versed)
or at times completely without sedation. At most, she would open
her eyes and move, but no reproducible purposeful movements or
ability to follow commands was seen.  A discussion was had with
the family regarding withdrawal of aggressive measures and
providing comfort measures only.  The family concurred with this
course of action and the patient was extubated on [**2149-12-3**].  All
medications save for nebulizers and morphine were stopped.  The
patient was transferred from the unit to the floor on [**2149-12-4**].
On the morning of [**2149-12-5**] at 9:26 am the patient passed away on
a morphine gtt. Her daughter, [**Name (NI) 14573**], her HCP, was notified and
declined an autopsy.
