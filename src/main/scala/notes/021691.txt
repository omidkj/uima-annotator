HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 54 year old Caucasian
male with a history of alcoholic cardiomyopathy, ejection
fraction of 50%, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus with
known hepatic abscesses secondary to perforated diverticulum
on p.o. Levaquin and Flagyl, who was found unresponsive on
the morning of [**2136-2-19**], and transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit after resuscitation for pulmonary arrest.
He had been found with [**Last Name (un) 6055**]-Stoke breathing, hypoxic and
then later found responsive.

The patient's course was notable for admission to surgical
service on [**2136-2-18**], with complaints of shoulder pain,
fatigue and hallucinations as well as left upper quadrant and
right upper quadrant pain after eating without associated
nausea and vomiting.  The patient had been recently admitted
on [**2136-1-26**], with pain at a pigtail site and bleeding.
During that admission, CT abdomen had showed increase in size
of the abscess.  During current admission, no surgical
intervention was indicated and he was treated for mild
congestive heart failure with intravenous Lasix.  The
transfer had been on [**2136-2-26**].

The patient had been transferred to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit on [**2136-2-19**], as well for hypoglycemia and
ventilatory distress.  He was intubated at that time and
extubated approximately six hours after.  He had returned to
the floor and had two unsuccessful CT guided drainages of
abscesses.  It was decided by infectious disease at that
point to treat medically with Nasalide for six weeks.  As
stated above, on [**2136-2-29**], the patient was again found
unresponsive and coded for pulmonary arrest.  He was
intubated at that time and transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation.

The patient was extubated two days later but then received
four units of fresh frozen plasma.  He was found again to be
in respiratory distress and so was reintubated.  The patient
was finally extubated successfully on [**2136-3-8**], and his code
status had been changed to DNR/DNI.  On [**2136-3-9**], the patient
was thought ready for transfer to the floor.  However, his
family decided that he should be comfort measures only and
Morphine drip was started.  The patient passed away at 1:43
p.m. on [**2136-3-9**].

CAUSE OF DEATH:  Respiratory failure and sepsis.

The patient's family is at bedside.  They do not want an
autopsy at this time.
