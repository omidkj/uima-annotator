History of Present Illness:
71W pmhx recurrent Cdif, ESRD on HD, DM, Dementia, CVA, b/l AKA,
CAD, Afib, recently discharged from the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**10-30**] for
possible VRE UTI, Cdiff and also osteomyelitis on
levaquin/linezolid/PO vanco presents from NH found unarousable
after a HD session today her VS 99.4 132/81 97 20 and o2 sat
93RA, cxr performed for chest congestion, became less responsive
and BP 143/92 P 149, T 102.9 R22 o2 sat 89%RA.  The transferred
to ED.
.
In the ED, Vs 100.4  139  133/99  20  100% ? NRB, then in triage
was noted to be 133 148/112 40 100% NRB, Tm in ED 102.2 was
noted to have crackles b/l she was intubated for tachypnea.
Otherwise received zosyn,  in addition to her outpatient
antibiotics, and when an OG tube was placed there was the a
question of fecal discharge from the OG tube, but with  no abd
tenderness. A CT scan was performed which showed no obstruction,
but a Distended gallbladder with gallstones and mild surrounding
stranding, raising possibility of cholecystitis. Surgery was
consulted but based on no clinical evidence on examination of
sedated pt, with no RUQ abd pain, surgery recommendations were
to follow LFTs, and consider cholecystostomy tube as needed
.
She was then tx'd to the ICU for further treatment. Here, she
was sedated, VS were stable, bilious fluid was noted from her ET
tube. Radiology was consulted for RUQ US.

Discharge:


Pertinent Results:
EKG: afib 140s bpm, slight LAD, ST depression in lat leads, w
TWI V4-V5 unchanged from previous.
.
Echo:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
0-5mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function are normal (LVEF 60%). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion
.
Head CT:  No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. Evidence of
prior infarcts in the right cerebral hemisphere, in particular,
a large chronic-appearing infarction involving the right middle
cerebral artery territory.
.
CXR's:
CXR [**11-4**]: Slightly elevated L hemidiaphram, Dialysis catheter
in place, ET tube in place
CXr [**11-8**]: The bibasilar opacities appear less distinct which
may be related to breathing versus small new pleural effusions
superimposed upon atelectasis. Cannot exclude pneumonia. There
is no appreciable vascular congestion. The endotracheal tube,
nasogastric tube, and right internal jugular catheter are stable
in position.
CXR [**11-13**]: In comparison with the study of [**11-12**], there is
continued decrease in the right pleural effusion. Again the area
behind the heart cannot be evaluated for possible pneumonia.
Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is consistent with left
effusion. Various tubes remain in place.
CXR [**11-18**]:Right lower lobe atelectasis is new. ET tube is in
standard position. There is no pneumothorax. Bilateral internal
jugular catheters remain in place. The left lung is grossly
clear. There are no sizable pleural effusions. New right lower
lobe atelectasis.
CXR: [**11-23**]: In comparison with the study of [**11-23**], the
tracheostomy tip is about 2.5 cm above the carina, essentially
unchanged. There has been development of increasing
opacification at the right base without obscuration of the
hemidiaphragm, consistent with some combination of pleural
effusion and atelectasis. The left hemidiaphragm is also not
sharply seen, with the same probable etiologic factors.
CXR [**11-26**]: Two portable images of the chest were obtained and
compared to prior examinations dating back to [**2102-11-20**]. Low lung
volumes are again noted. There is improved aeration of the lung
bases. There is persistent partial obscuration of the left
hemidiaphragm, likely secondary to underlying atelectasis. There
is a right perihilar prominence that is slightly indistinct,
likely secondary to underlying pulmonary venous congestion. In
addition, there is a new right perihilar opacity, may reflect
crowding of the vasculature associated with the low lung
volumes, however cannot exclude atelectasis and an evolving
pneumonia.

CT ABD:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Cholelithiasis, within a distended gallbladder with mild
wall thickening and surrounding stranding, raising the
possibility of cholecystitis.  Please correlate with patient's
symptoms.  These findings could be further evaluated by
ultrasound if clinically indicated.
