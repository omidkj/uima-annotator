Pertinent Results:
[**2151-1-1**] CNIS: 1. Widely patent right common and internal carotid
artery. 2. Calcific plaque involving the left common and
internal carotid artery, unassociated with any stenosis,
however.
[**2151-1-1**] Echo: There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Mild inferior and apical hypokinesis noted. Right ventricular
free wall motion is normal. There are simple atheroma in the
ascending aorta. There is diffuse calcification of the ascending
aorta. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild to moderate ([**11-24**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
There is a left pleural effusion. Post procedure: Mild global
and inferior and apical focal abnormalities persist. MR remains
2+. Aortic contours remain unchanged.
[**1-2**] Abd U/S: 1. Gallbladder wall thickening and edema with
multiple stones within the gallbladder with no evidence of
gallbladder distension. Since fluid accumulation is also noted
within the abdominal cavity, gallbladder wall edema is most
likely secondary to underlying medical problem. HIDA scan is
recommended for further evaluation if strong clinical suspecion
of cholecystitis exists. 2 The doppler fiondings are a little
difficult ot interpret-The vessels are all patent, but the
findings suggest right sided heart failure. There is one clear
image with hepatofugal main portal flow, which would also
suggest bidirectional portal venous flow indicating or at least
suggesting portal hypertension. A physician directed repeat
examination may help to resolve these findings [**2151-1-14**] CXR:
Persistent bilateral small layering effusions and bibasilar left
retrocardiac atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 94685**] was taken to the operating room on [**2151-1-1**] where
he underwent a CABG x 2. Please see operative report for
surgical details. Following surgery he was transferred to the
CSRU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. Later that day
he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated. He was also seen by renal services that day and
throughout hospital course for his history of kidney disease. On
post-op day one, he was found to have cardiogenic shock and a
respiratory acidosis for which he was re intubated and started
on Epinephrine, Levophed and Vasopressin. He was seen in
consultation by surgery for metabolic acidosis, rising LFTs and
lactate, that was felt to be shock liver and mesenteric ischemia
likely secondary to cardiogenic shock. No surgery was indicated.
His liver enzymes trended down throughout hospital course
following initial rise on first several post-op days. He did
require Inotropic support for several more days and remained
intubated until post-op day six. On post-op day seven speech and
swallow eval was performed and his diet was eventually advanced
to regular. Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were removed
per protocol. Beta blockers and diuretics were initiated and he
was diuresed towards his pre-op weight. He remained in the CSRU
for several more days requiring Neo-synephrine gtt at times d/t
hypotension and also needed aggressive pulmonary toilet. He
eventually was transferred to the telemetry floor on post-op day
twelve. The remainder of his hospital course was uneventful and
he was discharged on post-op day thirteen to rehab with the
appropriate follow-up appointments.
