History of Present Illness:
This is a 73 year old male with remote history of mitral valve
endocarditis and known mitral regurgitation who presented with
two week history of worsening shortness of breath. Patient
reported dyspnea that was worse with laying flat and with
exertion. His shortness of breath improved with rest and most
recently with supplemental oxygen. Patient reports mild
associated cough, nonproductive. Denies fevers, chest pain,
diaphoresis, chills and rigors. Patient reports eating out a lot
during this time, including high-sodium foods. During this time,
patient had been in touch with his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **]; per report
from PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has had serial echocardiograms since
establishing w Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], which have not shown any significant
increase in end-systolic dimension of the left ventricle,
although he has been noted to have left atrial enlargement
previously. Per PCP notes, patient's symptoms would briefly
improve with daily Lasix dosing. However, on day prior to
admission symptoms overall worsened and PCP recommended patient
present to ED. Patient initially presented to OSH, had CT chest
that did not demonstrate signs of infection and was discharged.
As symptoms continued to worsen he presented to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further workup.
.
On initial presentation to ED, vital signs were 97.3 93 139/68
18 100% RA. Exam was significant for crackles and systolic
murmur. Labs were significant for WBC15.9, Hct37.4, Cr2.1 (no
prior), Trop<.01, BNP5903, Ddimer2916. EKG w L atrial
abnormality (?p-mitrale), peaked twaves in precordials w ST
changes. OSH CT scan was re-read and w/o sign of PE. CXR did not
demonstrate any acute process. Patient was given 40mg IV Lasix,
ASA 325mg and admitted to cardiology.

[**2157-7-11**] Echocardiogram:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is [**4-26**]
mmHg.Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved
global and regional systolic function (LVEF >55%). [Intrinsic
left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
given the severity of mitral regurgitation.] Right ventricular
chamber size is normal with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is partial posterior leaflet flail with torn
mitral chordae attached (cannot exclude vegetation if clinically
suggested). An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of severe (4+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderat to severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
.
[**2157-7-12**] Cardiac Catheterization:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system

demonstrated no angiographcially apparent, flow-limiting
coronary artery
disease.  The LMCA, LAD, LCx, and RCA were all normal in
appearence.
2.  Resting hemodynamcis revealed  mildly elevated right and
severly
elevated left ventricular filling pressures, with a RVEDP of
16mmHg and
an LVEDP of 28mmHg.  There was severe pulmonary hypertension,
with a
PASP of 63 mmHg.  There was no transvalvular gradient to suggest
aortic
stenosis.  Significantly depressed cardiac function, with an
cardiac
index of 1.6 L/min/m2.
3.  Successful placement of an 8F 30cc IABP.
.
[**2157-7-13**] Intraop TEE:
PRE BYPASS The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left
atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 50 %). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] The right ventricle
displays moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Aortic
regurgitation is seen. The aortic regurgitation jet is
eccentric, directed toward the anterior mitral leaflet. The
aortic regurgitation is at least mild to moderate in intensity.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
extensive posterior mitral leaflet flail. Torn mitral chordae
are present. Severe, anteriorly directed (4+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. An intra-aortic balloon pump is seen in
situ. Its tip is about 3 cm below the distal aortic arch. There
is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was
notified in person of the results in the operating room at the
time of the procedure.

POST BYPASS The patient is in sinus rhythm. The intra-aortic
balloon pump is set at a 2 to 1 ratio. Initially after
separation from bypass, the right ventricle displayed continued
moderate global hypokinesis. The left ventricle displayed septal
dyskinesis likely secondary to cardiopulmonary bypass. There is
also some moderate inferior wall hypokinesis. Epinephrine
infusion was then started and right ventricular systolic
function normalized. Overall left ventricular function improved
though inferior hypokinesis and septal dyskinesis remained -
ejection fraction approximated 40-45%. The mitral valve is
status post repair. A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is in situ.
There is some redundant anterior leaflet beyond the coaptation
point but no significant mitral valvular systolic anterior
motion is noted. Mild mitral regurgitation is seen. The maximum
gradient across the mitral valve was 5 with a mean of 3 at a
cardiac output of 5 liters/minute. The maximum gradient across
the aortic valve was 19 mmHg. The tricuspid and aortic
regurgitation is unchanged from the pre-bypass period. The aorta
appears intact after decannulation.
