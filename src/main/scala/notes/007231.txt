-Multiple negative sets of cardiac enzymes.

[**2127-11-11**] CXR: limited radiograph. There are findings consistent
with CHF/fluid overload. Cannot exclude possibility of pneumonia
or pleural effusions on the basis of these films. If indicated,
PA and lateral views should be obtained.

[**2127-11-12**] TTE: mild symmetric LVH, normal LVEF 55%, suboptimal
technique therefore difficult to assess for WMA. Trace AR.

[**2127-11-15**] CXR Pa/Lat: Improving status. Some persistent features
of volume overload.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Dyspnea: The patient presented with worsening of baseline
dyspnea.  He was treated in the ICU for fluid overload with IV
Lasix, to which he responded very well.  Upon arrival to the
floor, he continued to be treated with Lasix and round the clock
nebulizer treatments.  On the day of discharge, he reported
feeling much better.  He was discharged with a home nebulizer
and prescriptions for nebulizer solutions.  He used oxygen when
in his room, however, was able to use his wheelchair in the
hallways without desaturation.  He refused to use the Nasal CPAP
machine.
.
2.  Chest pain: several times on the floor the patient
complained of chest pain. Repeated EKGs and cardiac enzymes were
unrevealing.  His home medical management of coronary disease
was continued. His chest pain responded well to nebulizer
treatments and minimally to sublingual nitroglycerin.  It is
likely his chest pain was related to underlying lung disease.
.
3. UTI: At admission, he was complaining of dysuria and was
found to have a urinary tract infection. He was initially
treated with Vancomycin/Ciprofloxacin, because he had a history
of enterococcal urinary tract infections.  The Vancomycin was
discontinued and he was discharged to finish a 10 day course of
Ciprofloxacin. He had a Foley while inpatient which was removed
at discharge.  He has a history of urinary incontinence,
however, does not have a chronic Foley at home.
.
4. Chronic lower extremity edema: He was treated supportively
for chronic lower extremity edema with Triamcinolone cream and
daily dressing changes.
.
5. Diabetes: at admission, it was recorded that the patient took
Metformin 1000 mg po bid.  He repeatedly refused the medication
and reported that the Metformin had been changed to Glyburide as
an outpatient.  He was changed to Glyburide on the day prior to
discharge. He refused all sliding scale insulin, believing that
it made the oral agents less effective.
.
6. Constipation:  The patient had not had a bowel movement in
six days on arrival on the floor.  He was treated with Colace,
Senna and Dulcolax, and ultimately Prune Juice.  He proceeded to
have several bowel movements.
.
7. History of meningioma resection: Continued on home dose
Dilantin.
.
8. Disposition:  the patient was discharged home with a home
nebulizer and several home services in place.  He was full code.
 Communication with the patient throughout the hospitalization
was difficult, especially when several attempts at drawing blood
were unsuccessful.  Through the assistance of the Russian
Interpreter, an effective plan was able to be developed and the
patient felt considerably better on the day of discharge.
