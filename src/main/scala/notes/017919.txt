Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right Mid-Line Placement


History of Present Illness:
77 y o F with bronchiectasis, severe COPD with baseline 2L 02
requirement, tracheobronchomalacia s/p Y-stent admitted to MICU
with Influenza A on [**11-3**].

As per patient, her symptoms began on [**10-31**] with sore throat,
headache, cough and SOB.  Denied any fevers, chills, myalgias or
other systemic symptoms at the time.  In ED, initial VS: 98.5,
71, 127/70, R=38, 96% 2LNC. Pt received methyprednisolone 125 mg
x 1, albuterol and ipratropium nebs x1, ativan, and IV
ciprofloxacin.  She was placed on BIPAP 10/5 with FIO2 30% and
sent to MICU.

Patient was unable to tolerate BiPAP secondary to inability to
clear upper airway secretions; but was able to maintain
saturations on nasal cannula alone although she remained
tachypnic.  In MICU, the patient was started on oseltamivir for
influenza and azithromycin.  MICU course was complicated by low
urine output with a FeNa < 1% which resolved with 500 cc bolus.
Also found to have dysuria with positive urinalysis: started
empirically on ciprofloxacin prior to transfer to floor.

On transfer to the floor, VS 98.2 146/77 67 18 96% on RA.  Still
complains of dyspnea greated than baseline, although notes an
improvement in initial symptoms of headache and sore throat.
Her cough is at baseline and she denies any increase in
purulence or quantity of sputum.  Review of systems is otherwise
negative besides that noted in HPI.

EKG: [**2152-11-3**]
Baseline artifact is present. Sinus rhythm. The axis is
indeterminate.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared to the previous tracing
voltage has improved in the limb leads.

CXR: [**2152-11-3**]
The lungs are massively hyperexpanded but stable from prior
exam.
This likely indicates underlying obstructive lung disease. No
consolidation or edema is evident. There is a markedly tortuous
aorta with calcified plaque at the arch. The cardiac silhouette
is within normal limits for size. No effusion or pneumothorax is
seen. There is blunting of the right costophrenic angle,
presumably due to scarring. The osseous structures are grossly
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Underlying COPD. No acute pulmonary process

CXR: [**2152-11-10**]
Cardiac size is normal. The aorta is tortuous. The lungs are
hyperinflated
but clear. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. If any, there
is a small
left pleural effusion. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged,
with cardiac size top normal. The patient has known bibasilar
and right middl
