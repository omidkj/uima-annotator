[**2140-10-30**] Head CT :1. Bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage. Possible
tiny left cerebral subdural hemorrhage measuring less than 2 mm.

2. Hemorrhage within the prepontine cistern and in the pons
(anteriorly).
Linear hyperdensity anterior to the pons is likely extraaxial.
3. Bilateral longitudinal temporal bone fractures extending to
the right
carotid canal. Left lateral and medial orbital wall fractures
and left
zygomatic fracture. CTA is recommended to exclude carotid
injury.
4. Sinus opacification with fractures of the sphenoid sinus.

[**2140-10-30**] Abd/Chest CT : 1. ET and NG tubes positioned adequately.

2. Consolidation in the superior segment of the right lower lobe
and complete consolidation of the left lower lobe which reflect
aspiration.
3. Anterior mediastinal density which is most compatible with
residual thymic tissue. No evidence of aortic injury.
4. Nonspecific hypodense lesions in the liver and right kidney
which are
incompletely characterized

[**2140-10-30**] C Spine CT : 1. No cervical spine fracture.
2. Bilateral skull base fractures, better evaluated on dedicated
head CT.
3. Secretions within trachea surrounding endotracheal balloon
concerning for aspiration.

[**2140-10-31**] Left forearm : No fracture of the left forearm is
detected. Assessment of the left wrist is limited on these
views. Allowing for this, the left wrist is grossly
unremarkable. However, if there is specific clinical concern for
wrist injury, dedicated views of the wrist would be recommended.


[**2140-10-30**] CTA Head :
  1. No evidence of carotid artery dissection.
  2. Focal abnormality of the right ACA just superior to the
ACA/ACOM junction. This likely represents tortuosity of vessel,
although tiny focal aneurysm cannot be excluded. Repeat CTA or
MRA could be performed in two to three weeks for further
evaluation.
  3. Multiple bilateral skull base fractures, unchanged.
  4. Bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage and hemorrhage anterior
to the pons
within the interpeduncular cistern is better appreciated on
non-contrast head CT performed earlier.

[**2140-11-1**] Head CT : 1. Apparent resolution of subarachnoid
hemorrhage.
  2. Persistence of possible left cerebral subdural hemorrhage.
  3. Bilateral longitudinal temporal bone fractures and left
lateral medial orbital wall fractures and left zygomatic
fracture (see CT fromSeptember 20, [**2140**] for details).
  4. Sphenoid sinus opacification and sphenoid fractures.
  5. High-density material in the bilateral maxillary sinuses is
likely
hemorrhage.

[**2140-11-1**] CT sinus/mandible :
There is partial opacification of bilateral mastoid air cells as

well as fluid seen within the left external auditory canal.
High-density
material is seen within the bilateral maxillary sinuses and
sphenoid sinuses compatible with blood. The right skull base
fracture extends longitudinally through the temporal bone
(series 2, image 39; series 401B, image 16). There is also a
fracture that extends from the right posterior wall of the
sphenoid sinus (series 401B, image 41; series 2, image 41) into
the right carotid canal. A longitudinal left temporal bone
fracture is noted that extends into the left parietal bone
superiorly series 2, image 4).There is a minimally displaced
fracture of the left zygoma (series 2, image 35) as well as the
left lateral wall of the left orbit. A thin lucency noted at the
superomedial aspect may represent a subtle fracture. No obvious
extension into the TMJ is noted, the lucency noted on the
studies in the posterior aspect of the TMJ relating to the site
of [**Hospital1 **] of the mastoid and squamous portions of the temporal
bone and seen on both sides. Thin non-displaced fracture of the
lateral pterygoid is noted on the left. Scattered foci of air
are noted including the right side of the neck , related to the
trauma. Evaluation for any other subtle
 fractures may be limited.

[**2140-11-5**] CTA Chest :
1. Enlarged now moderate-to-large left pneumothorax. Left chest
tube
terminates in the anterolateral subcutaneous soft tissues of the
chest wall. Slight rightward shift of midline structures.
  2. Pneumomediastinum. Subcutaneous gas along bilateral
anterior chest wall, tracking up to the thoracic inlet on the
left. Right chest wall laceration.
  3. Multifocal consolidation involving all lobes of the lungs,
likely due to aspiration and pneumonia.
  4. Assessment is slightly limited due to respiratory motion,
particularly along the lingula, but no evidence of PE seen.

[**2140-11-5**] MRI C Spine ;
Negative cervical spine MRI scan. Incomplete study of the
thoracic spine.

[**2140-11-8**] MRI Head and orbits :
1. Punctate hemorrhagic diffuse axonal injury in the left
parietal
subcortical white matter, and possibly also in the left
posterior frontal
subcortical white matter. Extensive diffuse axonal injury in the
splenium of the corpus callosum and associated infarction, with
a small hemorrhagic
component.
  2. Probable evolving acute/early subacute infarct in the right
pons, which is nonspecific but could be related to
nonhemorrhagic axial injury.
  3. Bilateral small retrocerebellar subdural hematomas.
  4. Subarachnoid hemorrhage again demonstrated.
  5. Unremarkable appearance of the orbits.

[**2140-11-10**] CXR : Near resolution of left apical pneumothorax.





Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the Trauma ICU for management of
his traumatic brain injury.  His GCS at the scene was 3 and 7 at
the time of admission.  He was seen by the Neurosurgical service
for evaluation and placement of a bolt for ICP monitoring.His
initial ICP was 10.  His left pupil was fixed and dilated and he
had a left hemiparesis.  His right upper and lower extremities
were moving.  He did require sedation while he was intubated as
he was very agitated.

From a neurologic standpoint he has had marked improvement
during his hospitalization.  He was treated with dilantin for 12
days and had no seizure activity.  Following his extubation from
the respirator he was able to speak and understand, respond to
commands and his left sided weakness improved. He continued to
have a left HP though this had been improving daily.  Most
recent MRI of the C and T spine showed no cord contusion.  MRI
of his brainshows axonal injury parietal and frontal white
matter on left aswell as in the left corpus collosum and the
right pons infarct,likely the cause of his
