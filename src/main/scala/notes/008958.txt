HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 44169**] is a 56-year-old
male with past medical history significant for hypertension
who originally presented to outside hospital the day prior to
admission with complaint of substernal chest pain.  He was
treated with Nitroglycerin and continued to drop his blood
pressure.  He also complained of lower extremity tingling and
had decreased femoral pulses bilaterally.  A chest x-ray at
the time showed widened mediastinum.  The patient was
intubated and transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for further management.

Emergent transesophageal echocardiogram was performed which
demonstrated Type A aortic dissection with a
pleural/pericardial effusion and low normal left ventricular
function.  Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted.  The patient
was consequently taken to the operating room for an emergent
ascending aortic dissection repair.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Elbow fracture.
3.  Lower gastrointestinal bleed in [**2175**].
4.  History of back spasm.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Anti-hypertensive medication (Name unknown).

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Works as manager.  Has no history of tobacco
use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is afebrile, heart rate
72, blood pressure 107/palpable.  Intubated at 100% oxygen
saturation.  General:  Intubated in no apparent distress,
opens his eyes spontaneously.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat:  No jugular venous distention, atraumatic.  No
bruits.  Chest exam:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiac Regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Extremities:  Warm, well perfused, bilateral
pulses present.

LABORATORY:  Hematocrit 32.1, white blood count 11.1,
platelets 157, INR 1.4.  Glucose 194.  BUN 21, creatinine
1.1.  Sodium 141.  Potassium 4.1.
Chest x-ray obtained on [**2178-10-30**] showed widened mediastinum.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The emergent echocardiogram
showed definite extensive Type A aortic dissection
originating just distal to the aortic valve and extending
into the ascending aorta to at least the level of the stomach
and mild aortic regurgitation.  No definite pericardial
effusion was seen.  Low normal left ventricular systolic
function without focal wall motion abnormality was also
noted.

The patient was taken to the operating room on [**2178-10-30**] and
underwent repair with resection and grafting of the ascending
hemi-arch of the aorta valve resuspension using 26 mm
Gelweave-Dacron graft and bioglue.  The patient received
multiple blood products in the operating room.  Chest tubes
were placed.  Cardiopulmonary bypass time was 171 minutes,
aortic cross clamp time was 91 minutes.

The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit,
intubated in fair condition.  The patient originally was in
sinus rhythm with occasional paroxysmal atrial contractions.
He was making good urine.  He was placed on insulin drip.  He
was maintained on Dopamine.  The bronchoscopy done on [**11-2**]
revealed mild amount of mucous secretions in the left lower
lobe region.  He was started on Vancomycin and Levofloxacin.
The patient experienced a brief episode of hypoxia and
intravenous Heparin was started for presumptive pulmonary
embolism.  CT angiogram was negative for a pulmonary embolism
performed on [**2178-11-4**].

At the same time, the patient underwent cardiac
catheterization which showed no significant obstructive
coronary artery disease, anomalous origin of the left
anterior descending, biventricular diastolic dysfunction and
no evidence of pulmonary embolism.  On postop day four  the
patient experienced atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.
Cardiology service was consulted.  At the time he was being
maintained on the Amiodarone, Dopamine, insulin drips.  His
Amiodarone was increased.  The patient was also started on
tube feeds do no oral food intake.  The patient received
additional transfusion postop day five for a hematocrit of
26.9.  Anti-coagulation was continued and he was started on
Esmolol for rate control.

Repeat bronchoscopy was performed given partial pulmonary
collapse on the imaging and mucous plugging bronchoscopy.
The chest tubes were removed on postop day 7.  The patient
was maintained on a Lasix drip and also Labetalol.  He was
noted to be hypertensive at times and was treated
appropriately.  The patient was transfused again on postop
day nine.  The patient proved to difficult to wean off the
ventilator.  Also, Dermatology was consulted regarding a rash
in multiple areas of the body.  Drug reaction was thought to
be the primary suspect.  He also developed a fever.  The
Infectious Disease consult recommended the continue
Vancomycin to pan culture the patient and to start
Fluconazole.  His blood cultures revealed coagulase negative
staff on [**2178-11-11**] and [**2178-11-13**].  The patient remained on
CPAP/PS by postop day 15.  No clear source of fever was
identified.

The patient went into atrial flutter/atrial fibrillation
again on postop day 15. He was extubated on postop day 16.
The tube feedings were stopped.  He appeared alert and
oriented.  He did experience some short of breath post
extubation. His atrial fibrillation was difficult to control.
Cardiology was re-consulted.

On [**2178-11-18**] he underwent an ablation procedure for his atrial
flutter by the Electrophysiology service.   The procedure was
without complications and the patient converted to sinus
rhythm.  The plan was to anti-coagulate the patient for the
next six weeks.  The sensitivity of the two positive blood
cultures were different which was suggestive of a possible
contaminant.

The patient was stable.  He was transferred to the regular
floor in stable condition.  He remained afebrile.  He was
making good urine.  He was ambulating with assistance.  He
remained in sinus rhythm with occasional premature
ventricular contractions.  He was maintained on oral
Labetalol, Coumadin, Amiodarone and Lopressor.

Physical therapy was consulted which recommended
rehabilitation facility post discharge.  The patient was
consequently discharged to the rehabilitation facility in
good condition.

PLAN:  Anti-coagulation for a total of six weeks.
