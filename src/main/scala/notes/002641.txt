Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 67-year-old gentleman
with aortic insufficiency and left main coronary artery
disease.  He presented with increasing fatigue and shortness
of breath.  On [**10-1**], he underwent a cardiac catheterization
which showed a 60% left main stenosis and 3+ to 4+ aortic
insufficiency.  The catheterization was complicated by a
groin hematoma.  The decision was made that the patient
should undergo an aortic valve replacement, as well as a
coronary artery bypass graft.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2132-10-8**] and underwent an uncomplicated aortic valve
replacement with a 25 mm Bovine pericardial valve, as well as
a coronary artery bypass grafting x2 with the left internal
mammary artery to the diagonal branch and the saphenous vein
graft to distal left anterior descending artery.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CSRU
being atrially paced.  The patient continued to do well
overnight, remaining hemodynamically stable and being
subsequently extubated that evening.

On postoperative day #1, his Neo-Synephrine was weaned and he
was started on Lopressor 25 b.i.d. as well as aspirin.  His
diet was advanced.  He began a Lasix diuresis and his central
venous line and peripheral artery lines were discontinued.
The patient was subsequently transferred to the floor in
stable condition where upon arrival his chest tubes were
removed.

On postoperative day #2, the patient remained pain free.  He
was noted to have several episodes of rapid atrial
fibrillation with a heart rate above 150 beats per minute
with a spontaneous conversion back into sinus rhythm.  The
patient was subsequently loaded on intravenous amiodarone.

On postoperative day #3, the patient remained hemodynamically
stable, however his activity level was only graded at level
3.  He continued to have brief episodes of rapid atrial
fibrillation.

On postoperative day #4, he had spiked a fever to 101.6??????
overnight.  Due to the presence of a bioprosthetic valve, it
was decided to send off urinalysis cultures and sputum which
all subsequently returned negative results.  His amiodarone
drip was discontinued and he was converted to p.o., as well
as continuing his Lopressor.  Physical therapy determined his
activity level to be a level 5 and so they signed off of the
case.

On hospital day #5, the patient had remained afebrile.  His
lungs were clear.  He was ambulating well, tolerating a full
diet and was requesting to be discharged to home.  The
patient was subsequently discharged home in stable condition.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. x1 week
3.  Potassium chloride 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. x1 week
4.  Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5.  ASA 81 mg q.d.
6.  Amiodarone 400 mg t.i.d. x4 days, then 400 mg b.i.d. x7
days, then 400 mg q.d. x30 days
7.  Percocet 1 to 2 tablets p.o. q 3 to 4 hours prn pain
8.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.

The patient was discharged home on [**10-13**] in stable
condition.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Aortic insufficiency
2.  Coronary artery disease
3.  Congestive heart failure
4.  Status post coronary artery bypass graft x2 with an
aortic valve replacement
