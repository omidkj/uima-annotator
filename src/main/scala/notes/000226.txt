HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 64-year old female
with a past medical history significant for aortic stenosis,
congestive heart failure, hyperlipidemia, hypertension,
hypothyroidism, [**Doctor Last Name **] syndrome, and arthritis.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2181-6-6**]; at which time she underwent an aortic valve
replacement with a 9-mm [**Company 1543**] mosaic valve and
replacement of the ascending aorta with a 22-mm gel weave
graft.  The surgery was complicated by an aortic dissection
with replacement of the aorta and a transfusion of packed red
blood cells, platelets, and fresh frozen plasma for bleeding.
As well, due to a low cardiac output the patient was
transferred from the Operating Suite to the Cardiac Surgery
Recovery Unit with an open chest.  The patient was on
Levophed, milrinone, epinephrine, and propofol.

While in the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit - that day - the
patient converted to atrial fibrillation.  She was
cardioverted back to a sinus rhythm with large amounts of
serosanguinous drainage from the chest tube.  A Quinton
catheter was placed on postoperative day one in order to take
off the excess volume.

The Renal Service was consulted, and they came by to see the
patient and recommended starting continuous venovenous
hemofiltration at an ultrafiltration rate of 100 per hour.

The patient was brought back to the Operating Room on [**6-9**]; at which time she underwent sternal debridement of
evacuation of a mediastinal hematoma, and closure of the
sternal incision, as well as placement of irrigation
catheters.  The patient was transferred from the Operating
Room Suite to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit
hemodynamically stable with her chest closed.

The Renal Service came by to see the patient again; at which
time they felt the patient was massively fluid overloaded.
However, they felt that there was no need to start continuous
venovenous hemofiltration dialysis at that time; and, if
necessary, would start hemodialysis.  The Renal Service did
decide to perform continuous venovenous hemofiltration
dialysis the following day due to her persistent volume
overload.

On postoperative day four, the patient received one unit of
packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 25 and continued
to be weaned off of her pressors.  The patient remained
intubated and sedated for the next couple of days with a
transfusion of packed red blood cells to keep her hematocrit
greater than 30.  However, her blood pressure continued to be
labile.  She was receiving continuous venovenous
hemofiltration dialysis as needed.  The patient continued to
be aggressively diuresed with high doses of Lasix and Diamox.
Neurologically, the patient was lethargic; however responsive
with purposeful movements.

On postoperative day eight, the patient became febrile; for
which her cortice was changed over to a triple lumen with the
cortice being sent for culture.  On postoperative day eight,
the patient also had two brief bursts of atrial fibrillation
with a heart rate up to the 150s, with the heart rate coming
down to the 80s after being treated with Lopressor.

A computed tomography of the head was performed due to the
patient's continued somnolence, which  revealed no evidence
of intracranial hemorrhage; however, with a calcified mass
(likely a meningioma)overlying the right frontal convexity
measuring 1.7 cm X 1.3 cm.

A Neurology consultation was called on [**6-15**] to evaluate the
patient's mental status changes after surgery - to rule out
stroke.  The Neurology Service impression was that the
patient was now with likely subacute embolic stroke.  They
recommended to watch the blood pressure carefully to avoid
hypertension.  They did not recommend heparinization.

The Stroke team was also consulted and saw her on [**2181-6-16**].  At that time, they assessed that her examination was
significant for weakness of her right upper extremity.  They
also felt that computerized axial tomography suggested
multiple infarctions of indeterminate age.  They recommended
checking an echocardiogram to rule out a source of these
embolizations.  They also recommended changing aspirin to
Plavix.

The patient continued to remain intubated over the next
several days with a stable white blood cell count and
hematocrit.  She was in a sinus rhythm.  The patient was
finally extubated on the evening of [**6-19**] without event.
She was continued on her tube feeds for nutritional support.
The patient was advanced to a liquid and puree diet following
a bedside swallow evaluation.

The patient was then transferred to the floor on
postoperative day 16 ([**6-22**]) in stable condition.  She was
alert, oriented, and was following commands well.  The
patient became confused on postoperative day 18; for which a
sitter was required at the bedside for safety precautions.
The patient's neurological status continued to improve, and
she started to be screened for rehabilitation.

On postoperative day 20, the patient had a 7-beat run of
ventricular tachycardia; at which time the patient was
asymptomatic.  An electrocardiogram was obtained, and the
strips were reviewed.  They revealed atrial fibrillation with
aberrant conduction.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient continued to progress
slowly and is currently continuing to be screened for
rehabilitation placement.  The remainder of this report is to
follow.
