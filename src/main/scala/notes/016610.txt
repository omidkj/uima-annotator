Chief Complaint:
Septic left knee


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2141-5-16**] - Left knee washout


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 284**] is a 58 year-old male
with a history notable for kidney-pancreas transplant 15 years
ago (on immunosuppressive therapy), Diabetes (on insulin), HTN,
HLD, CKD, PVD (status-post L BKA, R TMA) who presented to [**Company 191**]
today for left knee pain and swelling.  Of note, he does have a
chronic ulcer over his left stump for years that usually does
not drain.  On Friday, he noted the onset of left knee swelling.
 Denied trauma to the area or any open wounds around the site.
Over the weekend, his symptoms progressed, with intensified
pain, and he developed chills and a temperature to 100.7 on the
day of presentation.  He did continue to wear his prosthesis
over the weekend.  From [**Company 191**], he was referred to [**Hospital 2225**]
clinic.  In [**Hospital **] clinic, he had his knee aspirated which
returned 50cc of cloudy fluid concerning for septic arthritis.
From there, he was referred to the ED for concern of septic
arthritis.

In the ED, initial VS were: 101.3 133 106/65 18 99% RA.  Labs
showed WBC of 9.7, Hct 34.3, Cr of 2.7 (baseline 1.6-2.0), K
5.8. Joint fluid analysis showed WBC of [**Numeric Identifier 21397**] with 93% polys as
well as "FEW RHOMBOID EXTRACELLULAR POSITIVELY BIREFRINGENT C/W
CALCIUM PYROPHOSPHATE" as well as crystals C/W Monosodium Urate
Crystals.  Gram stain was positive for 2+ Gram positive cocci as
well as 4+ leukocytes.  Blood and urine cultures were sent.
Lactate was 3.0.  Orthopedics was consulted who recommended ICU
admission and NPO for OR tomorrow.  He was given vancomycin 1gm
IV and meropenem 1gm IV as well as morphine 5mg IV x1.  On
transfer, vitals were:   Temperature 99.5 ??????F (37.5 ??????C). Pulse
129. Respiratory Rate 18. Blood Pressure 117/89. O2 Saturation
99. O2 Flow ra. Pain Level [**9-1**].

On arrival to the MICU, patient was tachycardic but otherwise
VSS without acute distress.

Past Medical History:
Type 1 diabetes, status post kidney and pancreas transplant [**2125**]

with subsequent 'burnout' of the pancreatic graft, now on
insulin (Patient states his DM is now treated more like a type
II s/p pancreatic transplant)
Congestive heart failure, EF 60-65% on echo [**7-3**], calcified
aortic and mitral valves.
Hypertension
Hyperlipidemia
PVD s/p L BKA, R TMA, and multiple digit amputations both hands
DVT in [**2133**]
Chronic Kidney Disease baseline Cr 1.6
Tertiary Hyperparathyroidism s/p parathyroidectomy (three
lobes).
Sleep apnea (patient does not use CPAP)
Multiple admissions for osteomyelitis.


Social History:
Previously smoked 2 ppd for 10 years, but quit 20 years ago.
Drinks alcohol rarely on social occasions.
Denies use of illicit drugs.
Volunteers in the hospital as a patient liaison.
Lives with daughter and wife at home.


Family History:
Diabetes runs on both sides of his family, many generations.

Imaging:

-L knee plain film ([**2141-5-15**])
IMPRESSION:
1. Status post below left knee amputation.
2. Small-to-moderate suprapatellar joint effusion.
3. No evidence of acute fracture or dislocation.
4. Osteoarthritic changes, as above.
5. Extensive vascular calcifications.

-TTE ([**2141-5-16**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The estimated
cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no
valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is
likely related to high cardiac output. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildl
