Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, hypotension.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Removal of left subclavian line.
Placement of right internal jugular line.

History of Present Illness:
49 year old female with h/o Pulm HTN DM lupus on flolan via
hickman presenting for possible line infection. A new Hickman
line was placed 3 weeks ago after [**Last Name (un) **] line became infected
and she is s/p 14d vanco course for Micococcus. Micrococcus was
grown out of Cultures on [**2155-4-23**] and [**2155-4-25**]. Subsequent cultures
on [**4-19**] were all negative. Hickman line insertion (for
Flolan) was on [**2155-4-29**] and PICC line (for Vanco) insertion was
on [**2155-4-28**].
.
She comes in with 2 days sweats, chills, as well as tenderness,
warmth and drainage from line. Blood sugars 220, usually
100-200. It also has been draining a clear green fluid. She was
apparently scheduled for a dental procedure tomorrow for ?
infected tooth. No other ROS positive. Mult drug allergies.
Exam: crusting and purulence at site.
.
In the ED:
Her initial vitals were 98.1 103 145/82 12 94RA, she was started
on Vancomycin but developed itching and rash, benadryl given, ->
continued vanco at slower rate -> got worse -> stopped. This is
strange since she finished off a 14 day course of Vancomycin
dating from her recent visit.
.
On arrival to the floor she was noted be hypotensive 70s, 1L NS
in ED, and received 500cc NS, and 2nd iv was placed.

ECHO Study Date of [**2155-5-23**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is >20
mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function
is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is markedly
dilated. Right
ventricular systolic function appears depressed. There is
abnormal septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload.
The aortic root is moderately dilated athe sinus level. The
aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is at least
moderate to severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

No vegetations seen (cannot definitively exclude).

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2155-4-9**],
the IVC is now
more dilated.


Brief Hospital Course:
49 F PMH pulmonary HTN on flolan, SLE, APA syndrome, underwent
recent Hickman change due to line infection who returned with
likely line sepsis.
.
#) Sepsis: Most likely due to Hickman line infection.  She was
in the ICU for sepsis for a few days where she received several
liters of fluids, pressors which were quickly weaned, high dose
antibiotics and stress dose steroids.  She was subsequently
transferred to the floor when off pressors x 48 hours.
UA/culture remained negative. CXR negative for infection. Of
note, her Hickman was removed [**5-24**] and a RIJ placed.  She was
treated with Gentamycin/Linezolid since [**5-24**] until [**5-26**] when
Daptomycin replaced Linezolod (see "Headache" section below) and
then on [**5-27**] we switched Gentamycin to Levofloxacin to prevent
Gentamycin induced toxicity.  All of the antibiotic regimens
were per ID recs.  No blood or catheter tip cultures grew out
any organisms during this admission.  On the floor she remained
hemodynamically stable and afebrile with no further signs of
sepsis.  She had a midline placed [**5-28**] for 8 more days of home
antibiotics (per ID) to end [**6-6**] and she had her Hickman
replaced by surgery without event on [**5-29**].
.
#) Pulmonary HTN: She had a right heart cath on [**5-27**] which
revealed pulmonary hypertension with mean PA pressure of 47mmHG
with PA systolic of 70.  The PVR was 513. There was elevation of
RA pressure with mean RA of 15mmHG. The PCWP was
near normal at 13mmHG.  The cardiac index was preserved.  Based
on this, and concersations with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (pulmonology) we will
continue Flolan at home for now via her Hickman.  She has follow
up scheduled with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to discuss further management of her
Pulmonary HTN.
.
#) Tooth pain:  Pt with right questionable tooth infection prior
to admission.  She had considerable pain and headaches off
Amitriptyline.  based on this we got Panorex films of her jaw
and a Dental consult.  Per Dental recs, there was no obvious
source of infection/abscess and she was recommended for
outpatient dental workup.
.
#) SLE: Stable throughout admission.  We continued steroid taper
for a few days after stress dose steroids.  As she has had
recurrent infections in the past few months, we consulted Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] (Rheum) re: tapering her home Prednisone which may be
contributing to her susceptibility to infections.  Per Dr. [**Name (NI) 29165**] recs, we will discharge Ms. [**Known lastname **] on 9mg daily
Prednisone and she will follow in the outpatient setting and
consider a further taper.
.
#) Migraine HA: Patient was off amytriptilline for migraine
prophylaxis while on Linezolid (due to increased risk of
Seratonin syndrome).  Her headaches were significantly worse off
her home meds.  We temporized with Toradol, and Dilaudid PRN and
eventually switched from Linezolid to Daptomycin per ID so we
could resume Amytriptilline which we did a few days prior to
discharge.  Her headaches subsequently improved significantly.
.
#) APA syndrome/history of HIT: Stable. Coumadin was held for
procedures/line placements and she remained off Heparin products
without event.  We resumed Coumadin on day of discharge which
she is on for line patentcy.  She will follow
