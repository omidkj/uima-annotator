History of Present Illness:
Patieht is a 77 year old female who was transferred from
[**Hospital6 **].  She initially presented on [**8-17**] with RUQ pain and noted to have cholelithiasis.  She
underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy on [**8-19**] with a fibrotic
gallbladder and biliary structures were difficult to visualize.
Patient had increased JP output with concerns for a biliary
leak.  A follow-up HIDA scan revealed large biliary leak of the
cystic duct of common bile duct.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further evaluation of this leak.

In addition, the patient had a [**Hospital **] hospital course
which was notable for atrial fibrillation with RVR with episodes
of hypotension with pressors requiring dopamine.  In addition,
she was noted to have an inferior myocardial infarction with 2mm
ST elevations.  Peak CK of 263 and troponin I of 38.45.  The
changes had resolved with aspirin and heparin.  Patient also
developed acute on chronic renal failure with a creatinine of
3.2 which was thought to be due to acute tubular necrosis
secondary to hypotension.  Initially, her low blood pressure had
been thought to be sepsis and placed on cefotetan and
hydrocortisone.  Swann performed and consistent with cardiogenic
shock.  Intermittent findings of congestive heart failure and
had been treated with lasix.  Upon transfer to the MICU on [**8-23**],
the patient had be stable on an esmolol drip and heparin drip,
off pressors.

Currently, patient reports that she is doing well.  She denies
any nausea or vomiting.  She had mild abdominal pain when she
ate some chocolate pudding this afternoon.  Denies chest pain,
shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing.

Brief Hospital Course:
77 year old female with history of aortic valve replacement,
CABG, atrial fibillation who presented on [**8-17**] to an outside
hospital for right upper quadrant pain who underwent a
laparoscopic cholescystectomy on [**8-19**], transferred for
evaluation of a biliary leak.  Her post operative course had
been notable for resolving ARF, inferior MI, rapid atrial
fibrillation.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU on [**8-23**] and to floor on
[**8-27**].

1. Gastrointestinal:
a. Biliary: Patient had undergone an ERCP on [**2122-8-26**] which was
notable for extravasation of contrast noted at mid CBD in the
area of external drain. This finding was consistent with prior
operative bile duct injury.  In addition, a 9 cm by 10 Fr Cotton
[**Doctor Last Name **] biliary stent was placed successfully in the CBD. In
addition, patient had CT scan which was notable for ho abdominal
abscess or evidence of a biloma. Stranding and post-op change in
the surgical cholecystectomy bed. Minimal ascites.
Atherosclerotic calcifications of the aorta and its major
branches. Right common femoral artery/vein fistula. She was
treated with levofloxacin and flagyl. THe size of the collection
was noted to be increasing on CT scan and Interventional
Radiology placed a drain with 20 cc of drainage. Cultures were
negative. She will need repeat ERCP in 3 months for stent
removal/exchange.

b. Patient with history of gastritis at OSH. She was continued
on Protonix.

2. Cardiac:
a. Pump.  Patient had cardiac ECHO on [**2122-8-24**] which revealed
mild left atrium dilation. Mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction 40%) with is hypokinesis
of the inferior and inferolateral walls. Right ventricular
systolic function appears normal.  Trace aortic regurgitation
and mild (1+) mitral regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. Clinically she was noted to
be in mild failure with elevated JVP. We follwed her volume
status carefully. She was treated with lasix as needed and
spironlolactone and lisinopril for afterload reduction. She was
stable on lasix 40 mg daily at the end of her hospitalization.
After cardioversion and pacemaker placement her CHF improved
likely due to improved cardiac functioning in a normal rhythm.

b. Rhythm: Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] patient had been on an esmolol
drip for rate control of the rapid atrial fibrillation.  This
had been transitioned to po regimen once patient had been able
to tolerate po medications. We switched to metoprolol for rate
control later on during the hospitalization. She was
anticoagulated with hepain gtt for her atrial fibrillation and
AVR. She developed sinus sick syndrome after her ERCP and was
noted to have heart rates ranging from 39 to 140's.
Electrophysiology was consulted. She was loaded with amiodarone
400 mg [**Hospital1 **], this was lowered to 400 mg daily on [**2122-9-10**]. She was
cardioverted on [**2122-9-8**] and converted to sinus rhythm. She had a
temporary pacemaker placed on [**2122-9-7**]. EP was initially
reluctant to place a permanent pacemaker given her recent
subhepatic collection. After she remained afebrile for 1 week
and subhepatic collection cultures and urine cultures were
negative, EP felt comfortable placing a permanant DDD pacemaker
on [**2122-9-9**]. She tolerated the procedure well. She will remain on
metoprolol for rate control and on amiodarone 400 mg daily for
one month and then decrease to 200 mg. She should have PFTs as
an outpatient to document baseline while on amiodarone.

c. Coronary Artery Disease: Given patient's elevation in cardiac
enzymes and concern for myocardial inf
