History of Present Illness:
HPI: 49 y/o female with HTN, COPD/Emphysema, and CHF who has had
two admissions (first to B&W hospital and most recently to
[**Hospital 16843**] Hospital, where she was discharged from last week) in
the last month for COPD/PNA requiring intubation. She was doing
well after her discharge last week, but her daughter had a cold,
and the patient began to develop cough with sputum leading to
fevers, chills, and eventually lethargy on the morning of
admission, prompting her daughter to call EMS. Per her daughter,
she was not having chest pain, but was having increased leg
swelling, and orthopnea/dyspnea causing her to be unable to move
about the house and requiring her to sleep sitting up at the
kitchen table.
.
Arrived at [**Hospital 16843**] Hospital at 4AM [**2168-5-9**], Temp 99.5, Tachy

Echo ([**2168-5-10**]): The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 16-20 mmHg. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left  ventricular cavity size
is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a  focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). There is no
ventricular  septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal.  The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined. There is no aortic  valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears  structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral  valve prolapse. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.  There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely  represents a fat
pad.

BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUNDS ([**2168-5-10**]):  No evidence of
bilateral lower extremity DVT.

CXR on admission ([**2168-5-9**]): Mild upper lobe vascular
re-distribution and possible small bilateral pleural effusions
likely representing mild CHF.

CXR prior to discharge ([**2168-5-19**]): The tip of the nasogastric
tube does appear to lie below the diaphragm.  The lung fields
appear clear.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**5-9**]. By problem:

# Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Etiology of CO2 retention
likely multifactorial--COPD flare in setting of bronchitis,
obstructive sleep apnea, with possible contribution of pulmonary
edema. She was treated with combivent nebulizers,
corticosteroids, and 10d course of levofloxacin for presumed
bronchitis.  Despite positive d-dimer, PE was deemed unlikely
given clinical picture and negative LENIs, but her body habitus
precluded CT angiogram. Given 3 intubations within past six
weeks and OSA component, thoracic surgery was consulted and a
7mm [**Last Name (un) 295**] trach was placed on [**2168-5-11**] in the OR. Weaning pt from
the vent proved difficult; pt initially did not tolerate trials
of pressure support ventilation (she would become agitated and
anxious, and blood pressure would increase).  With diuresis and
decrease of airway resistance with abx/steroids, she was finally
able to tolerate pressure support ventilation on [**2168-5-18**]. On
[**5-19**] she was able to transition off the vent for up to 2 hours
at a time.  A Passey-Muir valve was attempted but tracheal
pressures were too high (20) and so it was not continued.
Eventually the trach can be replaced with a smaller trach for
re-attempt of PMV. She should remain on 20 mg predisone until
follow up with pulmonary after dischartge from rehab.
.
# CHF: An echocardiogram was performed which showed LVEF 70%,
mild symmetric LVH, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and R
atrial pressures of 16-20mm Hg. Admission cxr showed bl pleural
effusions and prominent pulmonary vasculature; pt was diuresed
with Lasix with good effect on pulmonary function and LE edema.
She was maintained on Digoxin 0.125mcg daily and lasix was
restarted at 80 po daily on discharge, which can be increased to
120 po daily (her home dose)
