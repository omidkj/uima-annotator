Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**]
Chief Complaint:
COPD exacerbation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 13621**] is a 66-year-old smoker with a history of COPD, recent
DVT now off coumadin, AAA, and multiple admissions for pneumonia
who presented with dyspnea and is transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
management of COPD exacerbation requiring bipap.

He has been hospitalized multiple times for COPD exacerbation
and pneumonia requiring ICU admission and intubation on a single
occasion in [**2131-9-23**], and most recently was discharged in [**Month (only) **]
[**2131**] to rehab and has been home for a few weeks.  At baseline he
is unable to walk a few steps without getting short of breath
and he is not on supplemental O2 at home.  He was in his usual
state of health when he developed worsening of his chronic,
productive cough of white sputum, worsening dyspnea, and
tachypnea last night.  His symptoms progressed and he activated
EMS.  Per report, O2 sat on room air upon their arrival was 81%.
 Of note, he was diagnosed with a right segmental PE and LLE DVT
in [**2131-12-24**] and was on warfarin until [**2132-5-22**] when it was
discontinued because of concerns of medication adherence.

In the ED initial vital signs were 97.5 116 158/94 28 95%O2.
His exam was notable for minimal air sounds and mild wheezes,
and he was intermittently tachypneic to the high 30s, with
tachycardia to the 130s.  A CXR demonstrated left sided
infiltrate, which was confirmed on a chest CTA that was negative
for PE but demonstrated multifocal pneumonia.  He was placed on
cpap and given nebs, solumedrol 125 mg iv x1, ceftriaxone, and
levofloxacin.

Review of Systems:

[**2132-8-3**] CXR
IMPRESSION: Interval development of left mid lung hazy opacity ,
concerning for pneumonia.

[**2132-8-4**] Chest X ray
IMPRESSION: Unchanged left mid lung field opacity concerning for
pneumonia.

[**2132-8-3**] CTA
CT CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST:
There is no pulmonary embolism. The pulmonary arterial
vasculature is patent to the segmental level. The aorta
demonstrates no acute pathology. The remaining great mediastinal
vessels are unremarkable. The heart is normal in size without
pericardial effusions. Moderate coronary calcifications are
again noted. Small mediastinal lymph nodes are not
pathologically enlarged, compatible with the underlying
pneumonia. There is no definitive hilar or axillary
lymphadenopathy.
Again noted are severe emphysematous changes of the lung
parenchyma, with
upper lobe predominance and also parasagittal bulla in the
anterior lungs.  There is interval increase of honeycombing
opacity in the left upper lobe, with persistent left lower lobe
consolidation, compatible with worsening infectious process in
the left lung. The right lung base opacification from prior
pneumonia appears to decrease in size. There is no pneumothorax
or pleural effusion. The central tracheobronchial tree remains
patent.
The study is not designed for subdiaphragmatic diagnosis. An
abdominal aortic aneurysm is not adequately assessed in the
current study, measuring up to 30 mm in diameter (image 3:127).
BONE WINDOW: Multilevel degenerative changes are mild to
moderate.
Left-lateral spinal fusion rod is unchanged in position.
Mild-to-moderate
loss of vertebral heights are again noted. There are no
suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval worsening of left-sided multifocal pneumonia.
Near-resolution of right lower lobe pneumonia.
2. No PE or acute aortic dissection. Incidental note of an
abdominal aortic aneurysm.
3. Unchanged severe centrilobular emphysema.

Lower extremity ultrasound [**2132-8-6**]:
FINDINGS: There is normal compressibility, color Doppler and
pulse-wave
Doppler waveforms of the left common femoral vein, popliteal
vein, posterior tibial and peroneal veins. There is
non-occlusive thrombus in the superficial femoral vein on the
left. Overall, this represents partial resorption of clot seen
on the prior exam [**2131-12-30**]. There is normal
compressibility, color Doppler and pulse-wave Doppler of the
right common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal veins.
There is thrombus seen within the duplicated posterior tibial
veins. The right peroneal vein was not seen.
IMPRESSION:
1. Partially resorbed clot in the left popliteal vein with
persistent
thrombus in the left superficial femoral vein.
2. New thrombus in the right posterior tibial veins.


Brief Hospital Course:
66 yo male with hx of severe COPD, recent DVT now off coumadin,
AAA, and multiple admissions for COPD exacerbations and PNA, p/w
COPD exacerbation and found to have multifocal PNA on CT.
Patient was admitted with shortness of breath, treated with nebs
in the ER, and ultimately required bipap. Patient was
transferred to the ICU, where he was weaned off Bipap and
eventually tolerating O2 via NC. He was started on Solumedrol
and Levaquin/Ceftriaxone. Patient was transferred to the floor
on O2 via NC and converted to PO Prednisone. We also stopped the
ceftriaxone and continued the levaquin. Patient eventually was
tolerating RA and was discharged home with VNA services.

Problem [**Name (NI) **]:
1. COPD Exacerbation: Patient started on ceftriaxone, levaquin,
and IV solumedrol on admission and required bipap. He was
quickly weaned off bipap and continued on abx and steroids. He
rapidly improved clinically and was saturating well on RA upon
discharge. He was discharged and instructed to take 50 mg
Prednisone daily x 3 days, and taper by 10 every three days
thereafter.

2. Multifocal PNA: Patient had leukocytosis on admission and
found to have evidence of multifocal PNA on CT. He was started
on Levaquin and Ceftriaxone. Blood cultures were negative as was
legionella antigen. The leukocytosis quickly resolved over the
hospitalization and the ceftriaxone was discharged once patient
was transferred to general medicine floor. Patient was
discharged after completing a 5 day course of his levaquin.

3. Cavitary Lung Lesion: Seemed to have decr
