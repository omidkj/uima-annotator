History of Present Illness:
HPI (per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **]): Ms. [**Known lastname 28119**] is a 49 year old female s/p OLT
in [**5-/2142**] for
fulminant hepatitis due to unknown etiology c/b post-op biliary
stricture required multiple [**Year (4 digits) **] and stents. Patient was
recently admitted on [**2145-2-19**] for pan colitis and UTI and was
treated with Cipro and Flagyl. Her diarrhea resolved and she was
discharged on [**2145-2-24**] with Bactrim for her UTI. Two to three
days prior to this presentation, patient reported having
effusive diarrhea, almost every 2-3 hrs. She felt weak and
fatigue but denied any fever/chills/nausea/vomiting. She has
been trying to drink more fluid to keep up with her diarrhea but
admitted that she hasn't been doing enough. Patient was
evaluated in the ED, given Cipro/Flagyl and resuscitated with
IVF.

(-): change in vision, sob, chest pain, dyspnea, abdominal pain,
nausea, vomiting, dysuria.

Past Medical History:
1. Severe acute hepatitis in [**2134**] (with ascites, coagulopathy)
ultimately attributed to ditropan (diagnosis by exclusion after

workup including: hep a,b,c serologies, ebv, cmv, hsv
serologies, cerulosplasmin, 24 hr urine [**Last Name (LF) 32276**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], [**Last Name (un) 15412**] was
negative and liver bx with bridging necrosis but no viral
cytopathic changes or fatty change). Initially, liver function
improved with no specific intervention, but a recurrent episode

of fulminant hepatitis led to OLT in [**2142-5-3**], complicated by
stenosis of the bile duct anastomosis in [**2142-6-3**], which
required stenting.
2. Multiple sclerosis, primary progressive, diagnosed in [**2133**].
3. Status post C-section.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Tranplant Surgical Service for
evaluation and treatment of large volume watery stool.

Neuro: The patient received dilaudid with good effect and
adequate pain control.  When tolerating oral intake, the patient
was transitioned to oral pain medications.

CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.

Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary
toilet, and incentive spirometry were encouraged throughout
hospitalization. Supplemental oxygen was weaned gradually to
room air.

GI/GU/FEN: Diet was advanced when appropriate, which was well
tolerated.  Patient's intake and output were closely monitored,
and IV fluid was adjusted when necessary.  Electrolytes were
routinely followed, and repleted when necessary.

ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were
closely watched for signs of infection. Due to large volume
watery stool, stool cultures were sent which were positive for C
Difficile. PO Vancomycin was started empirically with subsequent
gradual decrease in stool output.

Endocrine: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout
his stay; insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly.

Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined
routinely; no transfusions were required.

Immunology: Tacrolimus was continued and levels monitored daily
with dosing adjustments as needed.

Prophylaxis: Venodyne boots were used during this stay; was
encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as possible.

Disposition: Pt worked extensively with physical therapy with a
plan to continue follow-up at her rehab facility.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and
agreement with the discharge plan.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 28119**],

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your
hospitalization. You were admitted to the hospital after
developing severe diarrhea. During your hospitalization, we
determined that your diarrhea was most likely secondary to a
Clostridium Difficile (C.diff) infection. You were hydrated and
started on an oral antibiotic, vancomycin. We recommend
continuing this antibiotic for a total of 3 weeks. Your diarrhea
has improved and we recommend that you follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
in 2 weeks after discharge.

Followup Instructions:
Please follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 2 to 3 weeks after discharge.
Please see below for the dates of your next appointment:
