Chief Complaint:
Pleuritic Chest Pain and Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Mechanical Ventilation and Intubation.


History of Present Illness:
39 yo previously healthy African-American male patient is
transferred from an outside hospital with respiratory distress.
The patient was in his usual state of good health until
approximately one week prior to transfer when he had an episode
of vomiting and believes he may have aspirated. He developed a
right sided chest pain, sharp and pleuritic in nature.  He
subsequently developed shortness of breath and presented to the
hospital where he works. He was noted to have concerning lesion
on chest X-ray and he was admitted and placed on 100% oxygen. He
was given broad spectrum antibiotics with gatifloxacin and
clindamycin. Linezolid was eventually added. He was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] per the family's request.

On arrival, the patient continues to report shortness of breath
and pleuritic right-sided chest pain. He states that when he
takes the oxygen off, he can only speak two sentences before
becomming short of breath. He denies fevers, chills and night
sweats.

Past Medical History:
None

Social History:
The patient lives in [**Location 42513**] with his girlfriend and her
parents. He and his girlfriend have been together and monogomous
for over six years. He has had less than five sexual partners in
his lifetime, all women. He denies travel outside of the state
in over ten years. His girlfriend's parents just got a new dog.
He works as a health aid at [**Hospital6 302**] and does direct
patient care. He has a ten-pack year smoking history. One beer
per night. No illicit drug use.

Family History:
Mother and father alive and healthy.

speak, but cannot complete full sentences.
HEENT: moist mucous membranes, posterior OP erythema, white
tongue but no evidence of plaques

site on right forearm with no evidence of induration at this
time (placed earlier today)


Pertinent Results:
Labs at OSH ([**2176-3-3**]):
WBC 12.0 (88% N, 8% L, 3.5% M), Hct 35.7, Plt 454
Na 136, K 3.8, Cl 95, CO2 29, BUN 4, Cr 0.9
ALT 13, AST 42, Alk phos 84, TB 0.4, Alb 2.2, TP 6.1
Fe 15, TIBC 162
ABG: 7.44/50/74

CXR (OSH): right upper lobe cavitary infiltrate

Chest CT (OSH): diffuse prominent right upper lobe infiltrate
with 5cm cavitary mass, 2cm right upper lobe cavitary mass,
small right pleural effusion, some right hilar lymphadenopathy

[**Hospital1 18**] LABS/STUDIES:

CT CHEST ([**2176-3-6**]) - IMPRESSION: 1) 3.5-cm cavitary lesion with
air-fluid level and thickened wall in the right middle lobe as
described above, probably representing lung abscess, mentioned
in the requisition. However, please also consider the
possibility of septic emboli. 2) Multiple patchy opacities in
bilateral lungs, more on the right, which may represent
multifocal pneumonia versus atypical edema. 3) Bilateral diffuse
opacity, representing pulmonary edema due to ARDS. 4) Bilateral
pleural effusion, greater on the right, associated with
bibasilar atelectasis. 5) Perivascular lymphadenopathy.

ECHO/TTE ([**2176-3-5**]): The LA is mildly dilated. LV wall
thicknesses are normal. The LV cavity is moderately dilated.
Overall LV systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%). No masses or
thrombi are seen in the LV. There is no VSD. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
mildly dilated. The AV leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No
masses or vegetations are seen on the AV. The MV appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no MVP. No mass or vegetation is seen on the MV. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. No vegetation/mass
is seen on the pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.
The absence of a vegetation by 2D echocardiography does not
exclude endocarditis if clinically suggested.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) Respirtory Distress/PNA: The patient presented to an OSH with
fever, bandemia, and respiratory discomcomfort. He was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with ARDS-like findings (ARDS, PNA or lung
injury via mechanical ventilation) and a RUL cavitary lesion
(Infarction vs Abscess/Infection). He was then intubated and
mechanically ventilated for respiratory failure with an intialy
ABG of 7.46/44/103/32. He was afebrile over his course. Since
his admission to the outside hospital, he had been on
Gatifloxacin, Linezolid, Clindamycin, Zosyn, and Vancomycin. His
final antibiotic regimen was Levofloxacin and Clindamycin for
CAP/Aspiration PNA coverage. Bronchoscopy/BAL was not revealing.
HIV, PPD, Legionalla Urine Ag, BCXR, UCXR, BAL/AFB, and a Viral
Panel were negative. He was continued on Albuterol/Atrovent
nebulizers as needed. Of note, a TTE/ECHO showed a normal EF
without clear signs of endocarditis. The patient had improved
dramatically over his course and was comfortable on room air
upon discharge. He was discharged with pulmonary follow-up. He
was counseled in regards to smoking cessation.

2) Normocytic Anemia: He had a HCT in the high 20's to low 30's
early in his course. The baseline was unknown. His iron studies,
LDH/Bili/Hapto, B12/Folate were normal. His clinical picture was
consistent with anemia of chronic disease and as his pulmonary
inflammation/infection resolved, his HCT improved.
