History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 19896**] is a 85 year old male with PMH intracranial
hemorrhage with right-sided residual weakness, HTN, HLD, anemia,
CKD, dementia who presents with fever. Wife states that he was
complaining of abdominal pain 5-6d prior, which resolved on its
own after 2 days. She felt that he was excessively tired ever
since he was put on Keppra for a new-onset seizure that he
suffered 1 month prior. Per nursing home report, Pt had fever of
103.7F. Pt was found lying a large pool of dark brown stool.
Apparently reported vomiting x 1. No melena noted, no stomach
pain. Patient did not have any complaints but has [**Known lastname 5348**]
dementia. Prior to transport, Pt's vitals at nursing home were T
103.7, HR 117, R 20, BP 108/61, O2 Sat 90% on RA. He is full
code per ED resident report (confirmed). On route, EMS reported
that the patient was initially unresponsive. However upon
questioning in the ED, the EMS denies such history.
.
In the ED inital vitals were temp 100.0F, hr 107, bp 137/80, rr
21, sat 97% ra. Pt's BP gradually decreased to 78/36 over 3.5
hrs at 12.50p, then 68/35 on re-test. Central line was placed,
and Pt was given 4L NS, with improvement in BP to 133/59.

On exam he was noted to have guaiac positive brown stool. Labs
showed lactate 2.7, Na 146, Cr 1.8 ([**Known lastname 5348**] Cr 1.5-1.6), WBC
9.1 with PMN's 90.2%, Hct 37, plts 102, Coags normal, UA was
negative. Cultures were sent. LFT's were unremarkable. CTAP
showed no acute issues. He was initially placed on Cipro/Flagyl
for concern for bowel source. NGL showed feculent material with
small amounts of blood. No evidence of obstruction from CT, and
therefore NGT pulled out. GI was consulted and recommended
protonix gtt and plan to likely scope tomorrow. Surgery was
consulted as well, and thought exam and CT were non-concerning.
He had BP drop to 50s? around noon, and left IJ was palced for
access. Levophed was drawn up, but never used, as pt was fluid
responsive. He was given 3.5L NS with improvement in BP. Lactate
improved to 1.4. Access left IJ, 2 20's PIV's. He had Tmax
101.2.

VS prior to transfer T 99.2 HR 82 133/59 RR 16 91% 3LNC.
.
On arrival to the ICU, Pt's vitals were 99.2F, BP 145/71, Hr 96,
RR 20, Sat 93% ra -> 94% 2L nc.
.
Pt was recently admitted in [**11/2145**] for preseptal cellulitis
from [**Date range (1) 78748**]. That hospitalization was complicated by acute
renal failure and UTI.
