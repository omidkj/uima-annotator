Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p cardiac cath with BMS to prox RCA, hypertensive urgency


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
55 yo W with Hx of CAD s/p PCI with BMS to RCA in [**4-13**], also PVD
s/p R SFA stenting, dCHF, IDDM, HTN, HLD and active tobacco use
who presented to OSH on [**2183-2-7**] with acute dyspnea and chest
discomfort, had pulmonary edema on CXR and elevated troponins
(peak at 0.67). Treated with IV Lasix 40 [**Hospital1 **] with resolution of
symptoms, and began on heparin gtt (which was d/c in setting of
g+ stools). Per report, repeat echo revealed preserved EF.
.
At OSH Pt had one episode of agitation and disorientation the
morning of transfer. Head CT was negative for ICH. She was
brought to [**Hospital1 18**] where she underwent cardiac catheterization and
had BMS placed to a 60% proximal RCA lesion with positive
resting gradient by pressure wire. During the procedure her
blood pressure was extremely difficult to control. She was
started on a Nitroglycerin gtt at 180 mcg, then Nipride gtt, as
well as given IV labetalol bolus (dose unspecified) to keep her
sBP<180. She had normal b/l renal arteries. She required 4L of
O2 by facemask to keep her oxygen saturations in the mid 90s.
Her LVEDP was 30. She is being transferred to the CCU for
management of her hypertension and CHF.
.
Currently she reports feeling well. She denies any chest pain,
dyspnea, fever or chills. No abdominal pain or pain at cath
site.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, or
red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
Right and Left Heart Catheterization:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated single vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA was
free of angiographically significant disease. There was mild
paquing of the LAD with a 60% ostial stenosis leading to a small
D2. The LCx had diffuse insignificant plaquing. The RCA had a
40% ostial lesion and a 60% proximal stenosis. Pressures were
damped with a 5-Fr catheter. The gradient across the lesion by
pressure wire was hemodynamically significant at rest (32mmHg).
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left
heart filling pressures. There was moderate pulmonary artery
hypertension. The cardiac output and index were normal as was
the SVR. The PVR was slightly elevated. There was severe
systemic arterial hypertension despite aggressive IV vasodilator
therapy (SBP=184mmHg). On careful pullback from the LV there was
no pressure gradient across the aortic valve.
3. Selective angiography of the bilateral renal arteries
revealed no angiographically significant disease.
4. Successful PCI with BMS to RCA.
5. [**Hospital **] medical therapy and BP control.
6. Watch renal function closely.
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. NSTEMI with one vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe systemic arterial hypertension
3. Moderate diastolic dysfunction
4. No renal artery stenosis
5. Successful FFR guided PCI to proximal RCA.
.
LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Targeted Grayscale and Doppler
son[**Name (NI) **] of the right common femoral artery and vein was
performed. There is normal flow and waveforms within the veins.
There is no evidence of pseudoaneurysm.


Brief Hospital Course:
55 yo W with PMHx of CAD s/p POBA to LAD in 99, BMS to RCA in
[**4-13**], PVD (s/p L iliac angio & R SFA stenting), HTN, HLD, IDDM
presenting to OSH with elevated troponins and acute on chronic
diastolic CHF, transferred for cath where she received BMS to
prox RCA, and had significantly elevated blood pressures
necessitating nitroglycerin and nipride gtts
.
# Hypertensive Urgency: Patient had been receiving her home
antihypertensive medication regimen at the OSH. Per report, the
day prior to transfer her pressures were elevated and
supplemental labetalol was given. During catheterization the
patient was maxed on a nitroglycerin gtt, then started on a
nitroprusside gtt to keep her SBPs <180. Her renal arteries
appeared normal. Based on the patient's description of the
procedure, a component of her elevated BPs was likely secondary
to anxiety. On arrival to the CCU she denied any symptoms of end
organ damage. Given her baseline poor renal function we
discontinued the Nipride gtt and re-started the Nitroglycerin
gtt, as well as re-started her outpatient antihypertensive
regimen (except for Lisinopril during [**Last Name (un) **]). She was easily
weaned off the Nitroglycerine gtt and her blood pressure
remained well controlled. On discharge we asked the patient to
hold her Lisinopril until she follows up with her providers.
.
# Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: Patient presented to OSH with
acute dyspnea, and had CXR findings of pulmonary edema and
elevated troponin (peak 0.6, CKMB flat). She was diuresed with
IV Lasix 40 [**Hospital1 **] with subsequent improvement in her symptoms. An
echocardiogram obtained at the OSH revealed preserved EF of 55%,
mild MR, mild TR, mod elevated PAP, and mild LVH. Unclear
trigger as the patient denied medication non-compliance, dietary
indiscretion, or symptoms to suggest infection. She was
transferred to our hospital and underwent cardiac
catheterization where her LVEDP was noted to be 30. BNP was
elevated at 2891. Clinical exam revealed bibasilar rales. She
was given IV Lasix boluses and diuresed over her hospital
course. She initially required supplemental oxygen to maintain
adequate oxygen saturations, but that improved with diuresis.
She was continued on Metoprolol, but Lisinopril was held given
her acute on chronic kidney injury. She was discharged on a
decreased dose of Lasix 40 mg PO daily.
.
# Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury: Likely secondary to contrast
nephropathy given her baseline poor renal function and history
of diabetes, despite pre and post-cath hydration. She received
160 cc dye load during the catheterization. Her ace-inhibitor
was held. Her creatinine was 1.2 on admission (baseline likely
1.5 based on OSH re
