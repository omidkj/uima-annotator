History of Present Illness:
This 77 year old white female has known coronary artery disease,
having undergone stenting of the LAD and circumflex vessels in
the past. She presented with recurrent angina elsewhere and

circumflex stenosis. LV function has been shown to be ~55%.  She
was referred for surgical revascularization.

[**2200-2-24**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
revealed three vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had no
angiographycally apparent coronary artery disease. The LAD was
non-obstructed. The D1 had an ostial 80% lesion. The LCx had a
subtotally occluded in-stent restenosis in the mid stent at the
ostium
of the vessel. The RCA was small caliber, with a 70% lesion
proximally.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left sided filling
pressures
with LVEDP of 20 mmHg. There was normal  systemic arterial
systolic and
diastolic pressure with SBP of 109 mmHg and DBP of 72 mmHg.
3. There was a peak to peak transaortic gradient of 5 mmHg
4. Left ventriculography was not performed.

[**2200-2-25**] ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is elongated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
normal free wall contractility. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-27**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2199-10-19**],
the severity of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation has
increased. Estimated pulmonary artery pressures are higher.
Aortic stenosis is mild in severity.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 14330**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2200-2-24**] for a cardiac
catheterization and further management of her myocardial
infarction. A cardiac catheterization revealed two vessel
disease with severe instent restenosis of her circumflex artery.
Given the severity of her disease and the fact that she refused
to take plavix, surgical revascularization was decided upon.

Ms. [**Known lastname 14330**] was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner
including a carotid ultrasound which showed mild right and
moderate left internal carotid artery stenosis. Heparin was
continued and she remained without chest pain. The wound care
nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4221**] for assistance with her coccyx ulcer and
appropriate dressings and barrier creams were applied. On
[**2200-2-26**], Ms. [**Known lastname 14330**] was taken to the Operating Room where she
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to three vessels.
Please see operative note for details. Postoperatively  she was
taken to the intensive care unit for monitoring. Over the next
several hours, she awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated. Beta blockade, aspirin and a statin were resumed.
Diuresis towards her preoperative weight was begun.

The coccyx wound is being treated with Aquacel AG daily.
Surgical wounds are clean and dry. Pacing wires and CTs were
removed according to protocol. Bactroban was administered for
MRSA  positive nasal swab. Lopressor and digoxin were given and
advanced for rate control of her chronic atrial fibrillation and
diuretics were continued, to be so until she achieves her
preoperative weight.
