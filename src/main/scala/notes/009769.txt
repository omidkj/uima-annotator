Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization on [**9-22**]

History of Present Illness:
75 y/o M w/ h/o CABG [**2167**], NSTEMI [**2180**], HTN, CRI, DM p/w chest
pain. He had chest pain at rest yesterday evening, took maalox
and went to bed. On awakening in the morning, he had breakfast
and began to have CP again. Took NTG X 2 at home and did not get
relief so called 911. Still not relieved w/ another NTG en-route
to ED. CP is sub-sternal, central chest, sharp in quality
without radiation. He has baseline SOB but this was not made
worse by pain. No N/V/diaphoresis. He states that he has not had
pain like this since his last hospitalization one year ago. He
takes one NTG every morning for good measure but has not used
them for CP since prior discharge. No orthopena or PND. He has
chronic LE swelling which is not worse than usual. No f/c. No
cough/diarrhea. His only exercise is walking to the mailbox.
.
In the ED, initial vitals: T 97, 194/71, 82, 18, 97% on RA. NTG
ggt started for hypertensive urgency. Also, given ASA, metop,
maalox, demerol, morphine, heparin ggt. BP symmetric in both
arms.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

STUDIES:
[**2182-8-30**] PTCA COMMENTS:  The initial angiography revealed a
distal 70-80% RCA stenosis between two previously placed stents
and a 90% in stent PDA
stenosis (within a previously placed Taxus stent). Heparin was
administered for anticoagulation. The inital strategy was to
perform
angioplasty with angioscore balloon of the in stent restenosis
in the
PDA and balloon angioplasty with provisional stenting of the
distal RCA.
The JR4 Guide providede poor support and was exchanged for an
AR-1 guide
which provided poor support. The lesion was wired with some
difficulty
due to proximal stent struts with both Prowater and Choice PT XS
wires
but we were unable to deliver the 2.0 X 15 angioscore or Voyager
balloon
past the mid vessel. We recrossed with Wizdom wire and with much

difficulty were able to deliver a 2.0 X 15 balloon to the PDA
and dilate
it at 12 atms with rsidual 30% stenosis. The distal RCA lesion
was also
dilated with the same balloon at 12 atms with 30-50% residual
stenosis.
We attempted to deliver a 3.0 X 8 mm Vision stent but were
unable to do
so. Given good angioplasty result and high contrast load in a
patient
with renal insufficiency we aborten further attempts at stent
delivery.
There was no evidence of dissection or embolization and the TIMI
flow
was III. The patient left the cath lab in stable condition
.
CT Abd [**2182-8-31**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
2. Multiple low-attenuation lesion seen within the kidneys
bilaterally, some of which are consistent with cysts, others are
too small to characterize by CT.
3. 3-mm low-attenuation lesion again seen at the liver dome,
unchanged from [**2180-10-10**].
.
[**2182-9-9**] ECHO
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal
hypokinesis of the inferior and mid inferolateral wall and
distal septum. There is mild hypokinesis of the remaining
segments (LVEF = 30%). The right ventricle is not wall seen -
mild free wall hypokinesis is suggested. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic
valve stenosis (area 1.0cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**12-11**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2182-9-3**],
global left ventricular systolic function is more depressed
(mild global hypokinesis with similar regional dysfunction).
Right ventricular hypokinesis may now be present.
