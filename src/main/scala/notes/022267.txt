History of Present Illness:
88 yo F with hx of esophageal dysmotility (secondary to
radiation therapy to neck indicated for thyroid cancer) who is
s/p aspiratioin event on evening on admission. According to
patient's son, she finished her meal without sequelae tonight;
however, while on toilet after the meal she regurgitated her
food (as she often does). What was different about this event
was that she complained of fatigue after vomiting and went to
her bed. Her son went to check on her and she was complaining of
difficulty breathing. She was coughing and was continuing to
regurgitate food. Son called PCP's office who called an
ambulance. Prior to arrival of ambulance, patient's son reports
several witnessed apneas and some somnolence which terrified
him. EMTs arrived shortly after she became unresponsive and
noted an oxygen sat of 59%. They began to bag her and got her
sats up to 90% quickly and her mental status improved.
.
In the ED, initial vs were T 96.8, HR 74, BP 181/77, RR 22,
O2Sat 95% on NRB. A CXR was obtained. Patient was given
ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, and metronidazole. Reportedly desats
into 80s quickly off of non-rebreather, though is in mid-90s
while on NRB. Is fully alert and answering questions. Prior to
transfer to the floor, vitals were T 96.7, HR 60, BP 126/44, RR
18, O2Sat 98% NRB.
.
On the floor, patient reports that she is having slight dyspnea.
She denies chest pain. Reports some wheezing. She notes that she
has dyspnea "all the time", though it is worse today. She has
not been able to drink any fluids due to more frequent
regurgitation. Denies nausea.

Brief Hospital Course:
88 yo F with hx of esophageal dysmotility (secondary to
radiation therapy to neck indicated for thyroid cancer) who is
s/p aspiration event on evening on admission.

## Aspiration/Goals of CARE
Likely cause of the hypoxia, this is a chronic issue. She has
also not had any swallowing rehab or therapy since her radiation
treatment in [**2182**].  She had tried numerous outpatient therapies,
including peppermint but without success.  Speech and swallow
evaluated her on hospital day 3, however due to her acute change
in mental status was unable to perform a swallow evaluation.
Multiple family meetings were performed with the son concerning
possible solutions, which include allowing continued aspiration
or possible G/J-tube placement.  TPN was started in the ICU. Pt
was reevaluated by speech and swallow therapy after her ICU stay
and had severe evidence of aspiration. Pt was made strict NPO as
it was not safe for her to continue eating at that time. Pt
expressed on several occasions her wish to return to eating and
enjoy sweets. Therefore, a family meeting was held on [**7-19**] with
patient's son's, including [**Location (un) **] the HCP, niece, palliative
care, speech and swallow therapy and the chaplain. Pt has intact
cognition, has capacity, and clearly expressed her wishes to
return to eating regardless of the consequences as well as to
return home if possible. In addition, she also stated that she
would not want to be resuscitated. Therefore, pt's diet was
advanced. S+S worked with the patient in order to offer dietary
options that may prove less choking/aspiration and her diet was
modified to a soft solid, thin liquid diet. Pt and son were
given information by the speech and swallow therapists regarding
eating techniques that may lessen risk of aspiration. However,
pt is allowed to eat whatever she desires as the goal of eating
is for pleasure and comfort. Pt will aspirate, does spit up food
contents after meals, and may choke and pt and her family are
aware of this. If a significant choking/aspiration episode were
to occur, the goals of care are again comfort oriented and pt
should be given IV morphine or IV ativan prn choking or dyspnea
according to her wishes. These were not administered in the
hospital setting as pt did not require them. Pt has made it very
clear on several occasionals that she would not want aggressive
measures, "tubes and wires", would not want to be a "burden" and
desires to eat while acknowledging the risks associated with it.
In addition, she also is clear that in the event of an
aspiration/hypoxic/choking episode she would want to be made
comfortable and not have aggressive measures taken.
.
## Hypoxia, secondary to aspiration pneumonia and pneumonitis-
The patient was acutely hypoxic and required a non-rebreather
initially on coming from the emergency room.  This was weaned
rapidly first to venti-mask then to nasal cannula.  There was
also a marked leukocytosis and left shift, an
