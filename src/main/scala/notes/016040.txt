Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5827**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from surgery for thrombocytopenia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
67 year old male from NH with a past medical history significant
for hepatitis C, recent prolonged hospital course for Group B
Strep endocarditis with porcine MVR [**4-9**], and laryngeal cancer
admitted to surgery for intervention of L foot nonhealing ulcer
with pain x 3 months. The patient was admitted for intervention
[**2174-6-26**] but Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3124**] was forced to reschedule. On this
admission, the patient was found to be thrombocytopenic with
elevation of INR to 1.5, new findings per OMR and PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] note,
the patient had been started on levofloxacin and Lasix
approximateley 6 days prior to presentation for presumed
pneumonia and pleural effusion, respectively. In addition, the
patient has had a PICC line in place with heparin flushes for
approximately 4 months per report. [**Name8 (MD) **] RN at nursing home, there
have been no changes in diet or new supplements. The patient is
confused but otherwise has no complaints.

ART EXT (REST ONLY) [**2174-5-12**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  Severe arterial insufficiency at the level of the left
superficial femoral
artery with probable outflow disease.
2.  Outflow disease in the right lower extremity.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) [**2174-7-10**]
Tip of the right PICC line projects over the mid third of the
superior vena cava.  Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion and
severe left lower lobe atelectasis have worsened.  The patient
has had median sternotomy, coronary bypass grafting and mitral
valve replacement.  The heart size is top normal. There is no
pulmonary edema, or indication of pneumothorax.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) [**2174-5-20**]
IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
radiographs: The patient has had median sternotomy, mitral valve
replacement, and coronary bypass grafting.  Heart is mildly
enlarged.  Mild interstitial abnormality present is probably
edema.  Opacification at the base of the left lung is probably a
combination of atelectasis and small-to-moderate left pleural
effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Tip of the right PIC catheter
projects over the
upper third of the SVC.  No pneumothorax.

Abdominal/Pelvic US [**2174-7-13**]: 1.Geographic heterogeneous liver
consistent with fatty infiltration.  More advanced forms of
liver disease such as fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded.
2.Gallbladder sludge without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Patent hepatic vasculature.
.
Liver/Gallbladder US [**2174-7-13**]: 1. Geographic heterogeneous liver
consistent with fatty infiltration.  More advanced forms of
liver disease such as fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded. 2.
Gallbladder sludge without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Patent hepatic vasculature.
.
CT Thorax: [**2174-7-14**] 1)Multiple right-sided pulmonary emboli to
the lobar arteries. 2)  Elevation of left hemidiaphragm with
either atelectasis or pneumonia in the left lower lobe and
lingula and a small non-loculated appearing left pleural
effusion.  Findings could all be due to atelectasis from prior
cardiac surgery with a chronic elevation of the left
hemidiaphragm.  A sniff test could be performed to assess for
left diaphragmatic paralysis if indicated. 3)  Enlarged liver
with attenuation of the intrahepatic branches of the portal
veins.  Heterogeneous perfusion could be due to nutmeg liver
(passive cardiac congestion) or cirrhosis.  This study was not
tailored to assess for focalhepatic masses.
4)  Sigmoid diverticulosis. Slight colonic wall thickening in
the sigmoid most likely due to chronic diverticular disease.
Superimposed low protein state from liver failure is also
possible.
.
Bilateral LE US ([**2174-7-15**]):Thrombus in relation to the right
common femoral vein extending down into the upper portion of the
right superficial femoral vein.
.
Right UE US ([**2174-7-15**]):Partially occlusive thrombus within the
right subclavian vein. Patient refused evaluation of the right
internal jugular vein.
.
CT Head ([**2174-7-16**]): 1.  No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
2.  Periventricular changes consistent with chronic
microvascular infarctions. 3.  Extraaxial spaces are prominant
for a patient of this age; this can be associated with chronic
alcohol or benzodiazopene exposure.
.
RUQ Ultraound ([**2174-7-17**])
1.  Patent hepatic vasculature. 2.  Trace ascites with
pericholecystic fluid and gallbladder wall edema and sludge that
is worse compared to the previous exam.  No gallstones are seen.
The gallbladder was not distended. This appearance may be seen
in the setting of liver disease. Clinical correlation
recommended.
.
CT Head ([**2174-7-18**]): No acute intracranial pathology including no
signs of intracranial hemorrhage.
.
Chest X-ray ([**2174-7-18**]): There has been prior median sternotomy,
coronary bypass surgery and mitral valve replacement.  The
cardiac silhouette is enlarged and has slightly increased
compared to the previous radiograph.  There is vascular
engorgement and perihilar haziness.  Moderate left pleural
effusion has likely slightly increased in size even allowing for
slight differences in patient positioning. There is a new area
of patchy consolidation in the right lower lobe, which may be
due to aspiration or evolving pneumonia in the appropriate
clinical setting.
.
Repeat Chest X-ray ([**2174-7-19**]): The NGT is now present with its
tip in unremarkable position in the proximal stomach. There is
persistent collapse/consolidation/effusion at the left base.
Persistent patchy streaking infiltrates are slightly more
prominent in the right upper lobe and at the right lung base.
The visualized lung fields are otherwise clear.  No overt CHF.
.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] ([**2174-7-19**]): Study significantly limited by patient's
motion demonstrating no acute ischemic event or intracranial
arterial occlusion.  Generalized atrophy and small vessel
chronic ischemic changes in the deep/periventricular white
matter.
.
MR Abdomen: No abscess is visualized within the liver. No
abnormal collections are visualized within the abdomen and
pelvis.
