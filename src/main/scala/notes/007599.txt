Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
This is a 75-year-old man with a history of multiple myocardial
infarctions with resultant cardiomyopathy and an ejection
fraction of approximately 20%
who had, in the past undergone 2 prior CABG, the first one being
in the [**2128**] and the second one in the [**2138**]'s at another
institution. He had recently undergone treatment by his
cardiologist for decompensating heart failure and his
diuretics had been adjusted. Recent echo reveals really dilated
LV with 3 to 4+ mitral regurgitation. Based on these findings,
the patient was referred for evaluation for mitral valve
replacement. He underwent cardiac catheterization prior to this
which revealed his previous grafts were open and patent as well
as his LIMA to LAD. The patient understood the risks and
benefits of the procedure including but not limited to bleeding,
infection, myocardial infarction, stroke, death, renal and
pulmonary insufficiency as well as the possibility of a blood
transfusion and the future revascularization
procedures. He then agreed to proceed.


Past Medical History:

PE
CHF
[**Hospital1 **]-Ventricular pacemaker/ICD

Social History:
Lives with wife. Retired contractor. Quit smoking 30 years ago.

Physical Exam:
HR 88  BP 112/57  RR 18
GEN: NAD
HEENT: Unremarkable
LUNGS: CTA bilaterally
HEART: RRR, III/VI holosystolic murmur
ABD: Soft, ND, no rebound, no guarding, NABS
EXT: Warm, dry [**1-14**]+ pulses.
NEURO: Nonfocal

Pertinent Results:
[**2155-7-28**] CTA Chest and Pelvis
1. No evidence of an aortic dissection or an aneurysm.
2. Small bibasal effusion with passive atelectasis of the lower
lobes. Small ground-glass opacity in the right lower lobe likely
represents infectious or inflammatory change.
3. Atherosclerosis of the thoracic and abdominal aorta with
atherosclerosis involving the origin of a single right and a
single left renal artery.
4. Small trace of free fluid in the pelvis of uncertain
significance.

[**2155-7-31**] Ultrasound
1. Gallbladder contains small amount of sludge. Exam is
equivocal for cholecystitis. If suspected, consider HIDA scan.
2. Small right-sided pleural effusion. Small amount of free
fluid is also noted within the abdominal cavity consistent with
ascites.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 72855**] was admitted preoperatively for IV heparin. On
[**7-29**] he was taken to the operating room where he underwent a
mitral valve replacement with a porcine valve through a right
thoractomy. He was transferred to the ICU in critical but stable
condition on epinephrine and phenylephrine and propofol. He was
seen by elelctrphysiology for his biv icd as well as post op
ventricular ectopy in the setting of hypokalemia and epinephrine
and milrinone. He was extubated on POD #2. On POD #2 he was
jaundiced, complained of right sided pain,  and was found to
have elevated LFTs. Ultrasound showed sludge in the gallbladder.
He was seen by general surgery and hepatology.  He was started
on ursodiol. His LFTs improved and he was transferred to the
floor on pod#6 and his LFTs continued to improve. He was
restarted on coumadin for underlying afib. He was not started on
an ace inhibitor and his lasix dose was decreased to 20 mg daily
slightly increased creatinine and increased need for beta
blockade. He was ready for discharge to rehab with continued
creatinine and INR monitoring on POD #9 .
