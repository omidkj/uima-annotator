Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2880**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2110-7-11**] Cardiac catheterization
[**2110-7-12**] Pericardiocentesis with drain placement and L+R heart
cath

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo F with h/o HTN, rheumatoid arthritis and gallstones (but
no cholecystitis) presents with 1 day history of chest pain.
Was in her USOH when yesterday afternoon ([**7-10**]) she began having
a "choking sensation"-like pain in her chest.  This progressed
to include sharp pains up and down her left arm.  Later in the
afternoon, she began to have a "burning" sensation from her
epigastrium up into her mouth/jaw.  Pain was worse with lying
down, associated with some dizziness and diaphoresis, but no
shortness of breath, nausea, or palpitations.  Also noticed
yesterday that her urine was darker than normal, but stool was
still normal color.  Pain continued to get worse until she told
her sister at 2 AM "I feel like I'm having a heart attack", so
her sister rushed her to the [**Name (NI) **].  She had never had a pain like
this before, no history of reflux disease.  At baseline walks
around her house and occasionally outside with a cane, but only
goes short distances because of gait instability.

In the ED, initial vitals: 97.6, 88, 118/58, 18, 100%.  ECG
notable for SR @ 89 with ?ST-elevations and hyperacute T waves
in anterolateral leads with Q waves that are new compared to
last prior ECG in [**2107**].  Troponin was 0.04, MB (added on later)
was 5, hct was decreased to 29 from previous baseline 35.
Guaiac negative.  LFTs revealed bili 4.4 (4.1 indirect), so RUQ
obtained and showed gallstones with no sign of obstruction.  CXR
showed no acute abnormalities.  Bedside US showed small
pericardial effusion but no evidence of aortic dissection (no
comment on WMAs).  She was given aspirin 325, 1 SL NTG, after
which BP dropped to 60s but improved with 200cc bolus.  Chest
pain resolved but then came back, responded well to morphine.
Started briefly on heparin gtt but then stopped prior to
admission to the floor.

On arrival to the floor, the patient was feeling comfortable
with no chest pain since receiving morphine in the ED.  She
relayed the above story with no difficulty and with excellent
memory and attention to detail.

Shortly after her arrival, she began to have chest pain again,
same in quality as her previous chest pain.  Also complained of
feeling very very weak.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for:
+ chest pain, syncope and presyncope (most recently last week)
- dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations

Past Medical History:
- Hypertension
- Rhematoid arthritis
- Gallstones
- s/p hysterectomy
- s/p appendectomy

Social History:
Lives with her sister (also in her 90s) in [**Location (un) 1468**], MA.
Formerly worked in a school nursery, post office, and Navy ship
yards.  She is still completely independent at home with all
ADLs, cooks her own food and cleans the home herself.

STUDIES/IMAGING:

[**2110-7-11**] Cardiac cath:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated single vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA
had distal
tapering into a 90% lesion at the origin of the LAD.  The LAD
was
otherwise free of angiographically significant coronary artery
disease.
The LCX was free of angiographically apparant coronary artery
disease.
The RCA had an ostial 30% lesion and a 60% distal lesion.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
arterial blood
pressure with a central aortic blood pressure of 109/49 mmHg.
3. Successful PTCA and stenting of distal LMCA into LAD origin
with
3.0x18mm Integrity bare metal stent with proximal stent segment
postdilated to 4.0mm. LCx jailed, however only minimal pinching
of
origin with TIMI 3 flow.
4. Successful closure of right femoral arteritomy with 6F
angioseal.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Single vessel coronary artery disease of the LAD.
2. Normal systemic arterial blood pressure.
3. Successful distal LMCA-LAD PCI with BMS
4. Successful RFA angioseal.

[**2110-7-11**] TTE:
There is mild (non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal
septum. There is severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with anterior, septal and apical akinesis. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 25-30%). The right
ventricular cavity is unusually small. The ao
