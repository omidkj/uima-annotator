History of Present Illness:
58 yo M with hx of HIV who was transfered from [**Hospital3 **]
for initial presentation of COPD exacerbation and who then
developed a massive GI bleed. Per OSH DC summary, he was
admitted on [**2-18**] for a COPD exacerbation. COPD improved on nebs,
IV steroids and IV antibiotics. Within 2-3 days of admission,
patient developed a GI bleed, which started as a combination of
melena and hematochezia. Felt likely UGIB and GI was consulted.
Had an EGD which was negative. During course of bowel prep for
colonoscopy he developed massive rectal bleeding. Colonoscopy
was defered because GI was concerned about not being able to
visualize anything given bleeding. Patient subsequently went
into hypovolemic and hemorrhagic shock and was transferred to
the ICU where he received continuous blood transfusions and
fluid resuscitation. He remained persistently hypotensive and
continued to bleed so he was started on pressors on [**2-23**]. GI
continued to defer colonoscopy. IR was consulted and a bleeding
scan was done which was nondiagnostic. He continued to bleed and
require transfusions.
.
Per DC summary, on the day of transfer GI decided to do a
colonoscopy despite the persistent bleeding. They were unable to
clearly visualize any bleeding because the entire colon (from
the cecum to rectum) was full of blood. The scope was sent right
midway into the ileum where there was also blood suggesting a
mid-point GI bleed, however GI was unable to locate a specific
area. IR was reconsulted to consider angiographic embolization
but was not comfortable performing this procedure. Entire team
agreed that best course was transfer to tertiary care facility
for possible IR embolectomy. He had received a total of ~14
units of packed red cells across his admission.
.
Other complications during his hospital course included a left
iliac partial thrombosis. Also developed rising creatinine to
~1.3 and consulted renal who felt likely HIV nephropathy.
Consulted ID for possible of PCP pneumonia and per ID note he
was ruled out by sputums.
.
At the time of transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] at [**Hospital1 18**], his VS were stable on
1.5 mcg/kg of neo. He was noted to still be sleepy from sedation
for his scope (done at 4pm on day of transfer). He was
comfortable and in NAD. Abdomen noted to be firm and distended.
He subsequently became very tachycardic and hypotensive, and was
found to have large mealonic stool. He was intubated for
respiratory distress, and received 6 U PRBC, 4 U plts, and 4 U
FFP during the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay. He underwent a CTA, which showed
active bleeding in a loop of mid-to-distal ileum situated within
the right hemipelvis. Unfortunately, once he went down to IR on
the [**Hospital Ward Name **], they were unable to find anything. IR did say,
however, that the patient might have better luck with an IR
machine on the [**Hospital Ward Name **], and so he was being transferred West
for this.
.
In the MICU, patient has had several more episodes of BRBPR,
last one on [**3-1**] at 3pm. Patient had a second CTA on [**2-28**], but
no active bleed was identified. On [**3-1**], patietn had tagged red
cell scan done which was negative as well. Mr. [**Known lastname 26211**] also
experienced some respiratory distress and pulmonary edema
requiring 2 days of intubation. He was diuresed with Lasix IV
and responded well. Patient was extubated on [**3-1**]. Solumedrol,
which was started at OSH for COPD exacerbation, was tapered from
40mg IV bid to 40mg IV qd.
He has not received blood transfusion since [**96**] hours prior to
transfer to the floor. He has been transfused a total of 11
units pRBCs since admission to [**Hospital1 18**].. HCT increased from 32->
39, and has remained stable. At this point, GI may attempt push
enteroscopy. Surgery has requested to maintain hct >30, plts
>100, fibrinogen >100 (ICU has been doing plts >50). Of note,
TSH was checked and found to be 0.89, Free-T4:0.59 (low).
Difficult to interpret in setting of acute illness, can
re-evaluate as outpatient.
.
Today, patient states that he feels "ehh." Denies any sob,
abdominal pain, nausea. States he has not had any BRBPR or
melena today.
.
