History of Present Illness:
26 yo man D +199 after single cord transplant for hypoplastic
MDS with h/o persistent pancytopenia thought to be [**3-20**]
myelosuppression from CMV + antivirals who is now admitted for
sepsis.
.
Patient was first diagnosed with with MDS in Fall [**2136**] when he
presented with pancytopenia. Initial MDS course was complicated
by mucor infection of the tongue with prolonged ICU course for
upper airway obsturuction, followed by pericoronitis as well as
perirectal abcess.  Was subsequenntly managed with a single cord
transplant on [**2137-6-24**] with reduced intensity Flu/MEL/ATG
conditioning.  Post transplant course c/b VRE + Coag neg staph
bacteremia [**6-/2137**] (treated with dapsone); CMV viremia [**7-/2137**],
c.dif infection [**10/2137**] (treated with 14 days oral vanc),
admission on [**10/2137**] for low grade temperature attributed to +CMV
viremia with prolonged IV ganciclovir --> oral Valgancyclovir
course; last admission 10/4-6 for neutropenic fever, CT chest
showed non specific minimal peribronchial ground-glass opacity
in the left lower lobe, treated with course of levofloxacine;
Saw ID [**12-11**] Valgancyclovir was stopped as CMV viral loads
remained negative since [**10-21**], was started on valacyclovir for
HSV/VZV PPx. He also continues oral Posiconazole for mucor and
monthly pentamidine nebs for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] (most recent [**12-27**]). His
last Neupogen was [**1-3**].
.
Patient had > 97% donor on chimerism on peripheral blood from
[**2137-10-17**].  He has been intermitently leukopenic and neutropenic
throughout his illness with especially low white counts
generally ranging around 1000-3000 during the past 2 months.
This has been attributed to possible BM supression by CMV and/or
antiviral meds. Thrombocytopenia has been continous throughout
his illness and latley stable at ~ 25,000. Hct generally in the
high teens to low twenties. He also had had a stable
transaminitis for months which is attributed to drug effect +/-
hemochromatosis. Finally he is thought to be at low risk for GVH
and thus stopped immunosupressive meds in [**2137-9-16**] (was on
tacrolimus prior).
.
Patient now presents with 3 weeks of rhinitis and dry cough,
mild soar throat, pain in anterior chest when he coughs. Since
day prior to admission chills and rigors, and from day of
admission weakness, malaise and fever tp 104. Denies hemoptysis,
no sinus pain, no headaches or photophobia. No rash. No
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea, no myalgias or
arthralgias, no urinary complaints. His sister has been having
some URTI sx lately, other wise no exposure to sick persons. No
pets. No exposure to woodlands or ticks. No recent travel.
.
ED Course- Initial Vitals/Trigger: 103.0 160 88/51 16 98%RA
- labs: WBC 11.5 from 3.8 (9% bands), Hct and PLT stable at 34
and 25. Lactate 2.4, bicarb of 21 gap of 14.
- CXR: left retrocardiac opacity ? non acute c-p process, left
sinus not visualized.
- got NS X4L, tylanol (1g at 12:00AM),  BP's increased to 91/46,
 pulse down to  120's-130's.
- Got vanco + cefepim @ 12:00AM
- Patient a large bore IV on the left.
- Patient refusing any further IV placements (used translator)
- 13:20 - 123, 92/28, 22, 95% RA Temp still 103, + toradol (30mg
at 13:30)
- prior to transfer started on levophed per peripheral vein.


Past Medical History:
- Hypoplastic MDS (deletion 7q and 13) - single cord transplant
on [**2137-6-24**] with reduced intensity Flu/MEL/ATG. Last chemo:
Tacrolimus [**10-4**], d/c'ed as not thought to be at significant risk
for GVHD.
- Oral Mucor infection [**2136**]:  infiltration into base of the
tongue with bleeding requiring intubation and IR guided ablation
of bleeding artery. s/p excision by ENT. Treated with Ambisome,
now on Posiconazole
- Complicated hospital course involving multiple ICU stays for
worsening respiratory status [**3-20**] post-operative laryngeal edema
following intubation.
- H/o C. difficile infection [**10/2136**]
- H/o pericoronitis s/p extraction 4 teeth [**2137-1-24**]
- H/o peri-rectal abscess s/p drainage [**2137-2-27**]
- H/o periodic transaminitis of unclear etiology, though
possibly due to iron load from frequent transfusions; has been
evaluated by hepatology.
- s/p excision of a mass at the base of his tongue by ENT that
was diagnosed as mucor
- s/p embolization of lingual artery
