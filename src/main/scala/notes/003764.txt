CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fevers.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 48-year-old
morbidly obese female with a past medical history significant
for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus complicated by severe
gastroparesis (on intermittent total parenteral nutrition),
coronary artery disease (status post coronary artery bypass
graft in [**2179**]), sarcoidosis (status post tracheostomy), and
multiple admissions for line an urinary tract infections
(most recently for a Escherichia coli resistant emphysematous
cystitis and Staphylococcus epidermidis line infection
treated with an 8-week course of meropenem and linezolid) who
presents with 24 hours of fevers, shaking chills, nausea,
vomiting, shortness of breath, and complaints of
foul-smelling urine.

The patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 190**] from [**5-24**] to [**5-28**] for emphysematous
cystitis with multiple drug resistant Escherichia coli.  The
patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility and
treated with an 8-week course of broad spectrum antibiotic of
meropenem and linezolid with reported resolution of the
urinary tract infection.

The patient was recently discharged from rehabilitation to
home; and while at home developed the acute onset of fevers
to 103, associated with shaking chills, nausea, vomiting, and
shortness of breath.  The patient also notes a pustular
discharge from her right upper extremity peripherally
inserted central catheter line site through which she
received total parenteral nutrition.  The peripherally
inserted central catheter line was placed during her prior
hospitalization.

In the Emergency Department, the patient was found febrile to
103.3 and hemodynamically unstable with a blood pressure of
86/39, heart rate was 119, and oxygen saturation was 100% on
a 10-liter tracheal mask.  While in the Emergency Department,
the patient's blood pressure dropped to a systolic blood
pressure in the 60s, and the patient was started on
aggressive intravenous hydration as well as dopamine for
blood pressure support.  The peripherally inserted central
catheter line site was noted to be markedly erythematous with
pustular discharge.  The peripherally inserted central
catheter line was removed, and the patient was meropenem and
linezolid empirically.  An ultrasound of the right upper
extremity demonstrated a thrombus of the distal right
brachial vein; however, no abscess was noted.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  Type 1 diabetes mellitus diagnosed at the age of 16.
 2.  Morbid obesity.
 3.  History of emphysematous cystitis in [**2185-5-10**] with

aureus.
 5.  History of sternotomy; status post osteomyelitis
following coronary artery bypass graft in [**2179**].
 6.  History of coronary artery disease; status post coronary
artery bypass graft in [**2179**] (with left internal mammary
artery to the left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein
graft to the first obtuse marginal, and saphenous vein graft
to second obtuse marginal) with an ejection fraction of 40%
in [**2185-5-10**] (known to have reversible defects).
 7.  Hypertension.
 8.  Asthma.
 9.  History of sarcoidosis with upper airway obstruction
leading to permanent tracheostomy and history of mucus
plugging.
10.  History of pleural effusions with atypical cells.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed temperature was 103.3, blood pressure
was 79/33, heart rate was 99, respiratory rate was 25, and
oxygen saturation was 100% on 10-liter tracheal mask.  In
general, the patient was a morbidly obese female who appeared
older than her stated age, in mild distress. Head, eyes,
ears, nose, and throat examination revealed normocephalic and
atraumatic.  Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light
and accommodation.   Extraocular movements were intact
bilaterally.  Mucous membranes were dry.  The oropharynx was
clear.  The neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy or
jugular venous distention.  Tracheostomy in place.  The lungs
were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No wheezes, rhonchi,
or rales.  Cardiovascular examination revealed tachycardic
with a regular rhythm.  Normal first heart sounds and second
heart sounds.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops were appreciated.
Abdominal examination revealed obese, soft, and nontender.
Jejunostomy tube in place with foul-smelling discharge.
Extremity examination revealed right upper extremity
peripherally inserted central catheter site was indurated
with erythema.  No fluctuance; however, the presence of
pustular discharge.  The lower extremities were warm and well
perfused with no evidence of edema.  Neurologic examination
revealed awake, alert and oriented times three with a
nonfocal neurologic examination.
