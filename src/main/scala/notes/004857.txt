Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2110-8-4**]:

Sinus rhythm. P-R interval prolongation. Probable left atrial
abnormality.
Rightward axis. Possible inferior wall myocardial infarction of
indeterminate age. Modest inferolateral ST-T wave changes which
are non-specific. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2110-8-1**]
there is no significant diagnostic change.

CAROTID STUDY, [**7-30**]:
FINDINGS: Scattered areas of calcific plaque involving the left
common,
internal and external carotid arteries and the right internal
and external
carotid arteries. The peak systolic velocities bilaterally,
however, are
normal as are the ICA/CCA ratios. There is normal antegrade flow
involving
both vertebral arteries.

IMPRESSION: Scattered plaque as described above; however, no
appreciable ICA stenosis bilaterally (graded as less than 40%
bilaterally).

Brief Hospital Course:
This patient has a history of  peripheral vascular disease with
multiple amputations
and chronic gangrene (both wet and dry) of his lower extremities
bilaterally. He  originally presented on [**2110-7-23**] after he was
seen in HD and his lower extremities were noted to be getting
worse. The patient reports that for several weeks, he noted
increasing pain, drainage from his bilateral
wounds, and worsening smell of the wounds prior to his
presentation. He denies any fevers, chills, or sweats.
He was taken to the OR for a right above-the-knee amputation and
a left below-
the-knee amputation.
Given his overall condition with continues drainage and possible
infection from his  wounds and a dropping blood pressure, the
patient required postoperatively  multiple blood transfusions.
In addition the patient wasn't able to void and initial
placement of a Foley catheter wasn't successful. Thus, Urology
was consulted and placed a 22Fr coudet catheter. A voiding trial
is planned after the patient is discharged to rehab (please see
follow up instructions, if voiding trial is not successful). The
patient was on hemodialysis every third day.
He was also complaining of shortness of breath along with an
increased white blood cell count. Chest x-ray revealed a left
lower lobe collapse/consolidation and a pleural effusion.
His wound cultures did grow pseudomonas as well as group B
streptococcus. Several blood cultures were reported as negative.
The patient was put on a vancomycin/meropenem/gentamicin regimen
for initial coverage
of GNR. This regimen has been switched to cefepime according to
recommendations of Infectious diseases since [**2110-8-11**] and should
be continued for the next 6 weeks.The patient will require
weekly monitoring with CBC, LFT's, BUN, creatinine as well as
follow up.
Over the course of his hospital stay his condition improved.
Upon discharge the patient is afebrile and hemodynamically
stable.  There is still some serosanguinous drainage present on
his left stump, no erythema, no pus noted. The patient is on
cefepime monotherapy.
