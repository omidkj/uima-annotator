Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2136-8-31**] right video-assisted thoracoscopic evac. hemothorax

History of Present Illness:
This 88 year old male is s/p AVR/aortic endarterectomy [**2136-8-6**].
His postoperative course was complicated by a hemothorax for
which he was reexplored.  His chest was closed with pectoral
flaps.  He developed acute renal
failure and was dialyzed while in house.  He recovered, no
longer required dialysis, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 **]
for rehabilitation [**2136-8-29**].  At 2 AM he complained of shortness
of breath and was transferred to [**Hospital3 1196**] where
he was given Diltiazem, Labetolol and was treated with BIPAP.
He became bradycardic and was given Atropine.  He was intubated
and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

Pertinent Results:
IMPRESSION:

1. Large right hemothorax with adjacent collapse of the lung;
however,
superinfection cannot be excluded. Dense fluid seen layering in
the right
pleural effusion suggestive of ongoing bleeding/oozing; however,
no focal site
of active extravasation is identified.

2. No thoracic and abdominal aorta dissection.

3. Small flap/focal dissection in the right common iliac artery.


4. Small simple left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis
at the left
lung base.

5. Small non-obstructive filling defect in the right internal
jugular vein.

Discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 35979**] from cardiac surgery, and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] from
anesthesia at the time scan done.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Approved: FRI [**2136-8-31**] 7:50 PM

IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.

The finding was discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at 1:55 p.m.
on [**2136-8-31**].

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Conclusions
The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Preserved left-ventricular systolic function. No
evidence of pericardial effusion
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**8-31**] after transfer from [**Hospital1 **] for SOB,
bradycardia and was intubated. He was pan-cultured upon arrival.
Echo and scanning done to look for source of bleeding as a
possible cause of severe hypotension. Right hemothorax noted
again and he underwent VATS for evacuation and ligation of an
intercostal bleeder. Transferred back to the CVICU in serious
condition. Extubated on POD #2. Chest tubes removed per
protocol. Continued on abx therapy pending cultures. Swallowing
eval. done POD #3. Serratia in sputum treated with cipro.
Aggressive pulmonary hygiene was performed with
nebulizers/nasotracheal suctioning and chest physiotherapy.
Large amount of secretions required multiple therapeutic and
diagnostic bronchoscopies.

He failed swallowing re-eval on POD #6. Dobhoff feeding tube
placed. Tube feeds were initiated.

Mr.[**Known lastname **] became agitated and combative requiring Haldol and
Zyprexa. By POD#11 Mr [**Known lastname **] continued to require aggresive
pulmonary hygiene, had periods of somnolence and was becoming
more acidotic. BIPAP was initiated in intervals and serial ABGs
followed. Mr.[**Known lastname **] was reintubated and placed on the ventilator
for respiratory failure and secretion clearance. The following
day he was weaned to extubate without difficulty. All
antipsychotics were held to optimize his alertness.  Within 24
hours BIPAP was reinstated due to respiratory decompensation.
Post intubation hypotension required Phenylephrine. Pan cultures
sent. Linezolid started for + VRE UTI (last dose [**2136-9-26**]).
Cefepime started for Serratia in his sputum (last dose [**2136-9-27**]).


POD#17 Mr [**Known lastname **] was taken to the OR and underwent rigid
bronchoscopy/flex bronchoscopy and Tracheostomy #8 Portex and
PEG placement.

He was weaned to trach collar. Tube feedings via Gtube at goal.
ON POD# 25 from his right thoracotomy, POD#8 from Trach/Peg, Mr.
[**Known lastname **] was cleared by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 914**] for discharge to [**Hospital3 **]
in [**Hospital1 8**].  All follow up appointments were advised.
