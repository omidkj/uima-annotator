Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization [**2124-8-12**]

History of Present Illness:
85 yo F with PMH of DM, CHF, CVA in [**2116**] who presented to [**Hospital1 2519**] with dyspnea where she was reportedly in paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation however no documentation of this and concern
for ischemic EKG changes. In [**Hospital1 **] she recieved ASA and Plavix
75mg. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] ED for further evaluation. Her
admission EKG was not concerning however while she was in the ED
her nurse noted her to become diaphoretic with labored breathing
and ST changes on telemetry. She had an EKG that showed new
massive ST elevations inferiorly and laterally. She was started
on heparin gtt and given a dose of levaquin. She was taken to
the cath lab emergently and was not found to have any flow
limiting lesions or acute thromboses. Her right heart cath was
notable for an elevated PA pressure. Her wedge pressure was 15
and her LV appeared to be contracting normally. There was no
evidence of main PA thrombus and her proximal aorta appeared
normal. Her EKG changes resolved. On transfer out of the cath
lab she is on a heparin gtt with femoral venous line in place.
.
In the CCU, patient was tachycardic at 100 bpm, tachypenic
(25-30 RR), afebrile, with a stable blood pressure of 124/54.
Patient appeared comfortable and noted no pain.
.
Of note patient was admitted to [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital on [**7-28**] after
feeling warm an not well. At [**Doctor Last Name 1263**] she was diagnosed with
pneumonia and started on levaquin (course unknown). She was
discharged from [**Doctor Last Name 1263**] to [**Street Address(1) 12253**] Well. She was at Park
Well for two days befor being sent to [**Hospital3 **] with
concerns of pneumonia vs. CHF and acute renal failure. Patient
was given [**Street Address(1) 12254**] Well.
.
On review of systems, positive for general weakness, loss of
appetite, weak voice, vomiting, arm/leg swelling and
constipation. Notes no diarrhea or new pains. At baseline
patient requires assistance with ADLs, including bathing. On
weekends could go up 10 stairs with assistance, would use
wheelchair or walker when ambulating.

Pertinent Results:
[**2124-8-16**] - FECES POSITIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA
.
[**2124-8-16**] Abdominal Radiograph IMPRESSION: No definite evidence of
free air in this limited abdominal radiograph.
.
[**2124-8-16**] CXR FINDINGS: Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged but
has decreased in the interval. Pulmonary vascular congestion is
also improving. Multifocal pulmonary opacities show general
interval improvement, suggesting that at least a component of
pulmonary edema accounted for the widespread abnormalities on
the prior study. Residual patchy areas of opacification could
still potentially represent an underlying bronchopneumonia in
the setting of clinical concern for infection. Small pleural
effusions are present bilaterally.
.
[**2124-8-13**] Head CT IMPRESSION:
1. Tiny amount of high-density material layering in left lateral
ventricle
occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] may again represent small amount of
intraventricular
hemorrhage.
2. No evidence of increase or extension of hemorrhage. No
evidence of major vasculature territory infarction.
3. Chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
4. Age-related involutional change.
.
[**2124-8-12**] Cardiac Catheterization FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. No significant coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
3. Mild left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
4. Preserved left ventricular systolic function.

Brief Hospital Course:
85 yo F with DM, HTN, Obesity, prior CVA presenting with
episodic dyspnea with dynamic EKG changes s/p cardiac
catheterization with clean coronaries, but significantly
elevated PA pressure with concern for PE despite normal A-a
gradient, due to persistent tachypnea, tachycardia and hypoxia.
.
# Dyspnea: The patient was taken to emergent cardiac
catheterization after new ST changes inferiorly and laterally on
ekg. No evidence of flow limiting lesions or acute thromboses
was seen on ekg.  Her right heart cath was notable for an
elevated PA pressure.  Her wedge pressure was 15 and her LV
appeared to be contracting normally. There was no evidence of
main PA thrombus and her proximal aorta appeared normal. Her EKG
changes resolved. She remained quite hypoxic with continuing O2
requirments, tachypnea, and tachycardia in the CCU. It was felt
she may have had a PE. A CTA of chest was negative for PE and a
duplex ultrasound of her bilateral lower extremeties was
negative for DVT, however her TTE showed evidence of an acute
right heart strain pattern as well as a clot seen in the right
atrium. The chest CTA was not ideal quality per radiology (SN
90%, SP 95%), so it was felt a PE was the primary diagnosis, as
no focal infiltrate/considation noted. She was placed on a
heparin gtt and transitioned to warfarin once her INR > 2.
.
# Altered mental status - patient's family felt her mental
status had deteriorated from her baseline. She did not have any
focal neurological findings, but with a concern for thrombotic
emboli to her brain, a non-contrast head CT was performed. The
results showed small microhemorrhages in the occiptal lobe. A
repeat head CT the following day did not show progression of
these hemorrhages. Neurology felt that these findings should not
hinder anticoagulation.
.
# Leukocytosis/C. difficile infection: Patient with significant
leukocytosis on admission with count of 20,000. Hx of previous
pneumonia, prior to admission, treated with levofloxacin. Per
reports, this was a right sided pneumonia. CXR in ED with
reports of possible left sided infiltrate. Initially started on
IV vancomycin and cefepime, prior to positive C. difficile
toxin.  Once positive, these Abx were stopped and patient was
placed on PO vancomycin and IV flagyl. Over the course of her
admission her white count continued to rise and peaked at 85.1
despite treatment for C. difficile.  Her lactate rose to 10 and
her ABG was 7.14/41/72 prior to passing away.
.
# Mixed Acid Base Disorder:  ABG [**2124-8-12**] showed a respiratory
acidosis with a pH of 7.31 and a PaCO2 of 60. She was tachypneic
to the 20s-30s through the course of her admission, with unclear
etiology. Her A-a gradient was normal suggesting a non V/Q
mismatch. Her bicarb levels increased through the course of
