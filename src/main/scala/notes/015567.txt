History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 39953**] is a 73 yoM on HD-anuric, h/o AFib not currently on
coumadin (though is on at home), who is being transferred from
the neurology service for respiratory distress and hypoxia.  He
was admitted on [**2191-8-12**] after a fall resulting in acute on
chronic SDH on the left; his course is complicated by seizure
and he has been started on fosphenytoin & phenytoin.

This evening he was noted to be in acute respiratory distress
with desats to the low to mid 90's on 3LNC (reportedly desatting
to the mid 70's on room air; has had a variable O2 requirement
since being admitted).  His blood pressure dropped to the 70's
systolic and was responsive to the 80's and then 100's after a
250 cc NS bolus.  he was febrile to 101.9.  The neurology and
medicine MERIT teams were concerned for an aspiration event vs.
volume overload vs. PE.  CXR is c/w volume overload; however it
is grossly unchanged from earlier films.  His normal schedule is
M-W-F though he did not get dialyzed on Friday [**8-19**] because he
was having focal motor seizures.  He was last dialyzed Saturday
[**2191-8-20**] for a shorter cycle b/c of low blood flow from the HD
catheter(per renal note).  His mental status has been poor since
being in the hospital.

Of note, on arrival to MICU pt was being treated with vanco/gent
for a possible line infection given recent fevers.  Nothing has
grown out of numerous blood cultures since [**2191-8-12**] yet he
continues to spike.  he was briefly in MICU green on [**8-17**] - [**8-18**]
for fevers and hypotension to the 70's.

Since arriving to the MICU satting in the upper 90's on NRB,
code status was confirmed with his wife on the phone and he was
intubated with vecuronium and etomidate.  He is currently on AC
500x14 with PEEP 5 at 50% FiO2.  Peri-intubation, MAP's dropped
to the 50's and he was started on low dose levophed through his
right PICC.

Pertinent Results:
[**2191-8-16**] RUE U/S
1. No deep vein thrombosis seen in the left arm. No subcutaneous
fluid collection identified.
2. Occluded left arm fistula graft.
3. Small amount of non-occlusive thrombus material seen adherent
to the intravenous line which is identified within the right
subclavian veins.
.
[**2191-8-15**] portable CXR
In comparison with earlier study of this date, there has been
placement of a nasogastric tube that appears to extend to the
upper portion of the stomach. However, the image is extremely
light in the upper abdomen. To better evaluate the tip of the
tube, a repeat study could be obtained showing the lower chest
and upper abdomen and using abdominal technique.
.
EKG [**8-17**] @ 1249 SR @ 80 bpm NA/NI QIII,F TWI I,aVL no ST
elev/depr not significantly changed from [**2191-8-12**].
.
[**2191-8-12**] CT Head:
1. Acute on chronic left subdural hematoma. It is measuring up
to 11 mm in
greatest dimension. A component of extra-axial hemorrhage
towards the vertex appears contiguous with the subdural
collection and is less likely epidural.
2. Left hemisphere sulcal effacement and unchanged 3-mm
rightward shift of
midline structures.
3. Small right frontoparietal acute subdural hematoma.
4. Partial opacification of right mastoid air cells. No fracture
is
identified.

[**2191-8-12**] MRI Head:
1. Left-sided subdural hematoma with fluid-fluid level,
unchanged in size or mass effect. No new hemorrhage or shift of
normally midline structures. Thin subdural hematoma layering
over the right frontal convexity is also unchanged.
2. No evidence of acute infarction.
3. No significant stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm, although
evaluation of
intracranial vessels is somewhat limited due to patient motion.
4. Left sphenoid sinus opacification.
.
[**9-1**] MRV:
1. Narrowing of the right subclavian as well as right
brachiocephalic veins.
2. Narrowing of the left subclavian as well as left internal
jugular vein.
3. Widely patent SVC and the right-sided internal jugular line
ends in the
distal SVC. Linear filling defect in the left internal jugular
vein is
suggestive of a fibrin sheath from prior catheterization.
4. Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, some of which are unchanged
from prior CT and of uncertain significance. Assessment by chest
CT could be obtained as per clinical need.
.
[**9-6**] CT torso:
1. Endplate erosive changes involving L2 through L4. While these
have a
typical location for Schmorl's nodes, the increased hazy border
is concerning for underlying infectious etiology. MRI of the
lumbar spine is recommended for further evaluation.
2. Prominent mediastinal lymph nodes as described above. These
are
nonspecific. The largest lymph node measures 1.6 x 2.1 cm in the
prevascular space.
3. Mild fluid overload.
4. Multiple renal hypodensities, likely cysts.
5. Extensive vascular calcifications.
6. Anterior abdominal wall hernia containing loops of small
bowel without
evidence of obstruction.
.
[**9-6**] MRI L spine:
1. No evidence of osteomyelitis or discitis.
2. Multiple Schmorl's nodes.
3. Multilevel degenerative changes.
.
[**9-6**] ECHO:
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved
global biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral
regurgitation. Mildly dilated ascending aorta. These findings
are c/w hypertensive heart.
.
[**9-12**] EEG:
This is an abnormal routine EEG secondary to a background
that is slow and low voltage consisting of mixed delta and theta

activity, consistent with a mild to moderate diffuse
encephalopathy.
There were no focal, lateralized, or epileptiform features
noted.
.
[**9-13**] CXR:
In comparison with the study of [**9-12**], there are slightly
improved
lung volumes. The nasogastric tube has been removed and the
tracheostomy tube remains in place. There is little change in
the cardiomediastinal silhouette. The opacification at the left
base may be slightly improving. Mild prominence of the
interstitial markings is consistent with elevated pulmonary
venous pressure.
.
LABS on DISCHARGE:
CBC: 10.9/24.9/373
CHEM: 141/4.6/99/25/50/9


Brief Hospital Course:
73 y.o. M with CAD s/p CABG, DM, ESRD on HD, Afib on coumadin
admitted with acute on chronic L SDH complicated by right-sided
weakness and epileptiform behavior, requiring ICU level care for
sustained respiratory failure and sepsis.
