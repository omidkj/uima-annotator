IMAGING:
CXR: Acute infective change in the right lower lobe with right
basal effusion superimposed on multifocal pulmonary opacities
consistent with areas of infection.

EKG: SR 94 nml axis, rSr' in V1, 1mm J point elevation in V2. No
significant change compared to [**1-17**].

ECHO ([**7-/2126**]): Global, diffuse HK; EF 35%

TTE [**2128-2-5**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild basal
inferior wall hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 50%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
c/w CAD. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2126-8-6**],
overall biventricular systolic function has substantially
improved, but regionality of LV dysfunction is now appreciated.
The other findings are similar.

2 view CXR [**2128-2-6**]:
PA AND LATERAL CHEST, [**2-6**]

HISTORY: Multifocal pneumonia. Hypoxemia.

IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**1-25**] through [**2-4**].

Moderate interstitial pulmonary edema is stable since [**2-4**]. Moderate
right and small left pleural effusion have increased. Right
middle lobe
consolidation most likely pneumonia. Moderate cardiomegaly
stable. Tip of
the left PIC catheter projects over the superior cavoatrial
junction.
Interval improvement in left suprahilar consolidation suggests
that this
second region of pneumonia is improving.



Brief Hospital Course:
AP: 47 yo M with IDDM, recent multifocal, MRSA pneumonia, now
with hypoxia at rehab

#. Hypoxia: The patient had a recent/resolving multifocal, MRSA
pneumonia, and his symptoms (cough, sputum production) have been
resolving, although there does appear to be a new RLL infiltrate
and he has completed > 14 days now of vanc and zosyn. He had no
crackles on exam, but there was mild bilateral ankle edema,
grossly elevated BNP, and pt has history of systolic dysfunction
which could point to heart failure as a cause of his hypoxia.
Also in favor of heart failure is the improvement he had with
diuresis at rehab prior to transfer. Finally, diabetic
gastroparesis may predispose to aspiration as well as his
impaired oropharyngeal swallow seen on recent S & S, which, with
his new RLL infiltrate and acuity of event, seems most likely
explanation.
Patient underwent IV lasix diuresis and was discharged on his
normal lasix 20 mg po qd regimen.  The patient may require
further diuresis to optimize his pulmonary status per discretion
of the physicians at [**Hospital1 **].

He was treated with cefepime (day 1 [**2-4**]), renally dosed for an
8-day course days given his likely aspiration; He was continued
on vanc(8 more days)& flagyl.

#. CAD risks: Given the patient's acute hypoxia and cardiac risk
factors such as DM and a low EF. Serial enzymes were checked to
rule out ischemia.  He was continued on ASA and a B-blocker.  A
TTE showed EF 50%, mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w CAD, mild mitral regurgitation, mild pulmonary
hypertension.

#. IDDM: He was continued on glargine 12 units at bedtime and
HISS with meals.

#. C diff: The patient was diagnosed recently with C.diff and
was continued to be treated with flagyl x14 past end of other
antibiotics.

#. Thrombocytosis: likely due to his recent, serious infection.


#. Depression: The patient was continued on his outpatient
medication regmien.

#. HTN:  Patinet's metoprolol was continued.

#. CKD, Stage 3: current Cr of 2.2 is below recent values of
[**3-25**].

#. Chronic pain syndrome: The patient continued to experience
low back pain.  He was continued on fentanyl patches, lidocaine,
neurontin per his outpatient regimen and given break through
pain control with morphine 5mg oral liquid.

#. Anemia: The patient has anemia likely secondary to CKD. He
was continued on epo (formulary exchange for darbepoetin).

#. FEN: The patient's most recent S & S recs were pills whole or
with purees, thin liquids and pureed diet and he was continued
on this regimen.
