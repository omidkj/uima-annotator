Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9871**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This is a 58 year old woman with scoliosis, chemo related
cardiomyopathy that has since resolved, metastatic breast CA s/p
first dose of monthly faslodex who initially presented to the
[**Hospital1 18**] on [**10-4**] with shortness of breath, hypotension and new
anemia / thrombocytopenia.
.
Upon arrival to the ED, temp 98.6, HR 91, BP 84/53, RR 22, and
pulse ox 91% on room air. Her labs were notable for
transaminitis, thrombocytopenia with Plt 24. CTA chest
demonstrated no pulmonary embolus and known liver and bony mets.
She received zosyn.
.
She was tranferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the patient underwent an
echocardiogram and CTA of the chest, both of which were
unrevealing for significant cause of the patients hypotension
and SOB.  The patient's hypotension was easily corrected with
holding her home antihypertensives and fluid repletion.  The
patient had new LFT abnormalities, thrombocytopenia, elevated
INR, hemolytic anemia and these were thought to be related to
chronic DIC related to the patient's malignancy.  She was given
1 unit PRBC but did not require any other blood products.  Given
her anemia she was ruled out for babesia with parasite smears.
The patient's breathing stabalized and she was transferred back
to a regular floor

.
Studies:
[**2180-10-6**] Liver U/S: 1. Numerous echogenic small lesions in both
lobes of the liver, measuring up to 0.5 cm concerning for
metastatic disease.
2. A number of cystic lesions in the liver in both lobes.
3. No evidence of hepatic or portal vein thrombosis.
[**2180-10-5**] Echo: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%).
Diastolic function could not be assessed. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. An eccentric,
posteriorly directed jet of mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal regional and global biventricular systolic
function. Mild mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2180-9-20**], the
pulmonary artery systolic pressures can be estimated on the
current study (and are moderately elevated).
[**2180-10-4**] CTA: 1. No evidence of pulmonary embolus or thoracic
aorta dissection. 2. Trace pericardial effusion. 3. 3mm right
middle lobe pulmonary nodule. Recommend follow-up chest CT in 12
months to assess for stability. 4. Diffuse osseous metastatic
disease again seen. 5. Multiple hypodense intrahepatic lesion,
some of which represent cysts,



Brief Hospital Course:
Impression / Plan: 58 year old woman with scoliosis, chemo
related cardiomyopathy that has since resolved, metastatic
breast CA s/p first dose of monthly faslodex who initially
presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**10-4**] with shortness of breath,
hypotension and new anemia / thrombocytopenia.
.
# Shortness of breath: Restrictive lung disease likely due to
lymphangitic spread of tumor vs pulmonary fibrosis. After
extensive work up the patient was put on Prednisone 60mg by
mouth with a plan to do a slow taper and follow up in pulmonary
clnic. She was also started on Bactrim prohylaxis, Ca/Vit D.
.
# Chronic DIC: The patients platelet count and HCT stabalized
during this admission but remained low. The patient has close
follow up with her Oncologist who will follow these values.
.
# Abnormal LFTs: Likely [**2-14**] to liver mets. They were elevated
but stable before discharge.
.
#Metastatic Breast CA: Her oncologist will follow this issue.
The patient was started on lovenox.
