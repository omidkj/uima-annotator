Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2712**]
Chief Complaint:
Hemoptysis


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**3-19**]: Right superficial bronchial artery embolized with
embospheres and 4 coils. Rt inferior bronchial artery embolized
with PVAs. Angioseal deployed.
[**3-20**]: Had another episode of bleeding which required DL ETT
placement. Bronch showed active bleeding from same site of
emoblization. Patient hemodynamically stable but did not respond
to 1U PRBC. No further intervention.
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
This is a 52 year old male with PMH of morbid obesity with
resultant lymphedema, depression, Afib on Coumadin, OSA on CPAP,
and h/o LLL pulmonary hemorrhage secondary to an AVM requiring
rigid bronchoscopy and APC to cauterize area of bleeding
presenting for further evaluation of repeat hemoptysis. He
reportedly coughed up some bright red blood at home this evening
and was initially stable upon arrival to the ED until he was
witnessed coughing up a pint and a half of blood. Of note, he
developed a UTI about a week ago and received ceftriaxone
followed by a po cephalosporin, which likely interfered with his
Coumadin levels.
In the ED, initial VS were: 98, 130, 128/75, 16, 97%
Non-Rebreather. He arrived with normal mental status and a
patent airway, but began coughing in the ED which was productive
of bright red blood. Over the next couple minutes, the
significant bleeding continued and he was intubated for airway
protection him. Before intubation, he was noted to have about
200-300 mL of bright red bloody hemoptysis. Peripheral IV access
was obtained and 4 units of FFP were given in addition to 10mg
of IV vitamin K since his INR was supratherapeutic at 6.1 on
Coumadin. Interventional radiology, interventional pulmonology,
and cardiothoracic surgery were consulted in the ED. After
intubation, the ventilator kept alarming due to elevated
pressures likely secondary to blood clot obstruction. He
therefore required manual bagging to maintain his sats and his
resistance improved once placed in the left lateral decub
position to a point where he could be placed back on the vent.
Of note his HR was consistently in the 130s probably from Afib
RVR.
.
On arrival to the MICU, he could not be placed on the ventilator
due to the high resistance in his airways from the blood and
clots in his lungs. He required manual bagging at times to
maintain his sats as well as paralysis with cisatracurium. A
central line was placed in his right IJ to continue infusion of
blood products. A bedside flexible bronchoscopy revealed massive
hemoptysis and clotting of his bilateral bronchi. IP was
contact[**Name (NI) **] and the patient was immediately taken to the OR for
rigid bronchoscopy in an attempt to clean out the clots and find
the site of bleeding in order to cauterize it.

Brochial angiogram ([**2129-3-19**]): Two arteries of possible bleed
in the right lung from the right superior and Preliminary
Reportinferior bronchial arteries which were successfully
embolized with
Preliminary ReportEmbospheres, PVAs and four coils.

CT head [**3-23**]:
IMPRESSION: Compared to study of [**2129-3-14**], there are new regions
of subtle
hypodensity involving both the [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter in the
right temporal, right occipital, and left parieto-occipital
regions. These are suspicious for cytotoxic edema related to
acute embolic infarction. Recommend MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] of the brain for
better evaluation.
.
Echo [**3-23**]:
IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body
habitus. Left ventricular function is probably normal, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is mild
right ventricular dilatation and global free wall hypokinesis.
No pathologic valvular abnormality seen. Pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined.
.
Bilateral LENIs [**3-22**]:
IMPRESSION:
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in visualized portions of
bilateral
lower extremities. Suboptimal exam due to patient's body
habitus.
.
CTA chest [**2128-3-20**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple bilateral segmental and subsegmental lower lung
pulmonary emboli.
2. Bilateral peribronchovascular opacifications consistent with
provided
history of pulmonary hemorrhage or edema.
3. Dual channel endotracheal, distal chamber ends in left main
bronchus,
proximal channel ends in distal trachea. No apparent means of
right bronchial
obturation.
4. Possible right retrohilar hematoma.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 52 year old male with PMH of morbid obesity with
resultant lymphedema, depression, dilated cardiomyopathy with an
EF=35-40%, Afib on Coumadin, OSA on CPAP, and h/o LLL pulmonary
hemorrhage secondary to an AVM requiring rigid bronchoscopy and
APC to cauterize area of bleeding presenting for further
evaluation of repeat hemoptysis.

#. Hemoptysis/respiratory failure.  He presented to the ED with
massive hemoptysis requiring intubation for airway protection
and ventilatory support to maintain his sats. Flexible
bronchoscopy on admission in MICU showed fresh hemorrhage in
right lung.  He was taken to OR for rigid bronchoscopy whose
course was complicated by persistent hypoxia and hypotension. He
was taken to IR suite where they embolized superior bronchial
artery embospheres and 4 coils while right inferior bronchial
artery was embolized with PVAs. Coagulopathy was reversed with 8
units of FFP and vitamin K while coumadin was stopped and given
3 units of PRBC.

On [**2129-3-20**] he was noted to have opacification of the right
lung.  IP's bronchoscopy showed fresh bleeding.  He was given 1
unit of PrBC.  Double lumen ET tube was placed and plan is to
take him for rigid bronchoscopy tomorrow.

After some brief progress was made at lowering the patient's
oxygenation requirements, the patient had increasing oxygen
requirements that resulted in a CTA chest, which ended up
showing bilateral pulmonary embolism. In addition, the patient's
chest X-ray suggested some left infiltrate and he was started on
treatment for ventilator-associated
