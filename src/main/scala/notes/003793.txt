History of Present Illness:
57M with h/o of dilated cardiomyopathy, afib on digoxin, COPD,
ESRD, dyalisis who is admitted due to lethargy, hypotension,
pulmonary congestion and hyperkalemia.
.
At baseline patient lives at home with sister and mother, is ADL
independent and ambulates with cane. He gets dyalisis Q mon,
wed, Fri. Previous admission to [**Hospital1 **] in [**9-/2102**] for hyperkalemia
which was treated with dyalisis. Most recent dyalisis session
was [**1-20**] and was due for another session today. Yesterday he
reported experiencing some generlized weakness and lack of
apetite. Denies any recent fevers, chills or any focal symptoms.
 This morning in dyalisis unit prior to starting dyalisis was
noted to be lethargic at with blood pressure in the 70s and was
sent to the ED where he was found to have Afib with wide-complex
RVR and hyperkalemia to 6.5.
.
In the ED, he claimed his BP's are usually low in the 80-90's
but his previous chart showed SBP's in the 110's usually.
initial VS in the ED were:  13:25 0 97 140 109/50 28 98% r/a
.
- ecg: Afib RVR: HR in the 100-140's in the ED. HD BP's in the
high 90's low 100's occasionally dips down into the 80's,
mentating well throughout.
.
labs: hyponatremia 130, hyperkalemia 6.5, bicarb 19, AG = 18,
cr:BUN 10.1:79, WBC = 17,000 with neutrophil predominance, Hct
32.7 which is at baseline. Dig level 1.2. Lactate = 1.7.  Blood
cultures sent.
- CXR: med-line sterotomy, dyalisis line in place left SC,
cardiomegaly, mild congestion/edema, LLL is obscured by heart

ECG [**2103-1-22**]: Atrial fibrillation with a mean ventricular rate of
122. Right bundle-branch block. Left axis deviation. Left
anterior fascicular block. Possible left ventricular
hypertrophy. Leftward precordial R wave transition point.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2102-10-18**] multiple
abnormalities as described persist without major change.

CXR [**2103-1-22**]: IMPRESSION: Stable massive cardiomegaly and mild
pulmonary edema.  Supervening left lower lobe infection cannot
be excluded due to cardiac obscuration.

ECHOCARDIOGRAM (TTE) [**2103-1-24**]: The left atrium is elongated. The
right atrium is markedly dilated. The left ventricular cavity
size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with depressed free
wall contractility. There is abnormal septal motion/position.
The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The
study is inadequate to exclude aortic valve stenosis as the
aortic valve and the LVOT were not visualized and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 109**] could
not be calculated. There was a slight increase of peak aortic
valve velocity. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: poor technical quality study. With this limitation,
no endocarditis or abscess was visualized. Left ventricular
function is probably low normal, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. No pathologic valvular abnormality
seen.
