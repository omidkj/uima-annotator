Ventricular Tachycardia

History of Present Illness:
57 yo M w/ no sig PMH p/w SOB x 1week, found to be in VT at
[**Location (un) **]. He appeared stable but BP was in the 80s so
cardioverted him w/ one shock and has been in sinus since w/ BPs
in 110s to 120s and HR in the 110s. He was started on amio drip
and heparin drip, got plavix loaded and ASA. Sinus EKG w/ TWI
inferiorly and anterior Qs Trop I was 0.59 and CK 139. Pt. now
asymptomatic. He says that he was feeling well until 10 days ago
when he started noticing DOE a/w palpitations, his dyspnea would
resolve w/ rest and he also noted that his rapid heart rate
would resolve w/ rest. He says that his DOE was intermittent and
did not reliably occur to the same degree every time. He did not
have any chest pain at any time. Today he had acute onset of SOB
at rest a/w cold sweat, he tried to drink some water but
vomitted. These Sx persisted for several hours w/o improvement
and he presented to [**Location (un) **] ED.
.
surgical Hx. He has had chronic RLE swelling and duskiness for
several years, slowly progressive but noticed about 10 days ago
that his LLE also started swelling and turning purplish.
.
On review of systems, he denies any f/c/ns, cough.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for presence of one episode
of syncope which occured about 1.5 yrs ago when he was doing
work outside in the heat and felt dehydrated, he lost
consciousness and his neighbors called 911, he did not revive
until EMS arrived and refused hospital transport at that time.

ECHO [**2126-1-10**]
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 15-20%). The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated
with severe global free wall hypokinesis. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is a very small pericardial effusion. The effusion
appears circumferential.
.
IMPRESSION: Biventricular dilatation with severe hypokinesis.
The lateral wall of the LV has relatively better function. No
significant valvular abnormality seen. Very small pericardial
effusion.
.
CHEST XRAY [**2126-1-10**]
FINDINGS: Moderate cardiomegaly with slight tortuosity of the
thoracic aorta. No pulmonary edema. No pneumonia, no pleural
effusions.
.
Bilateral Lower Extremity Doppler [**2126-1-10**]
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
.
Cardiac MR: [**1-17**]
Findings:
Structure and Function
There was normal epicardial fat distribution. The pericardial
thickness was
normal. There was a small pericardial effusion. There were no
pleural
effusions. The indexed diameters of the ascending and descending
thoracic
aorta were normal. The main pulmonary artery diameter index was
normal. The
left atrial AP dimension was moderately increased. The right and
left atrial lengths in the 4-chamber view were moderately
increased. The coronary sinus diameter was normal. The left
ventricular end-diastolic dimension index was normal. The
end-diastolic volume index was moderately increased. The
calculated left ventricular ejection fraction was severely
decreased at 29% with global systolic dysfunction. The
anteroseptal and inferolateral wall thicknesses were normal. The
left ventricular mass index was mildly increased. The right
ventricular end-diastolic volume index was normal. The
calculated right ventricular ejection fraction was moderately
decreased at 35%, with global hypokinesis. The aortic valve was
poorly visualized but did not appear stenotic.
Impression:
1. Moderately increased left ventricular cavity size with global
left
ventricular systolic dysfunction. The LVEF was severely
decreased at 29%.
2. Normal right ventricular cavity size with global hypokinesis.
The RVEF was moderately decreased at 35%.
3. The indexed diameters of the ascending and descending
thoracic aorta were normal. The main pulmonary artery diameter
index was normal.
4. Moderate biatrial enlargement.
5. Small pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN 57 yo M with no known prior cardiac history
presented with monomorphic VT and likely underlying dilated
cardiomyopathy.
.
# Monomorphic VT/CHF: Likely that the patient had an ischemic
event in the past week or so which lead to scarring and
ventricular tachycardia as anterior qwaves apparent on EKG and
troponin I only 0.59 and CK in the 130 130s. Underlying dilated
cardiomyopathy likely given significant alcohol use.  He was
transferred to the CCU due to stable ventricular tachycardia on
telemetry on the floor.  In the CCU he was given IV lasix and
metolazone with significant urine output.  He continued to
autodiurese in the hospital with weight at discharge 125.7 kg.
He was started on hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate in the
CCU, later changed to low dose Lisinopril and his home
metoprolol was titrated up. Cardiac MR was completed showing
severely depressed EF. Decision was made place ICD for secondary
prevention prior to discharge. Patient tolerated procedure well
without any complications. he will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11493**] and
the device clinic here at [**Hospital1 18**].
