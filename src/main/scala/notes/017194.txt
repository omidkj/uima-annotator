ADDENDUM:

1.  CELLULITIS:  The patient developed a left antecubital
area cellulitis from her IV line the day before discharge.
This developed while the patient was on levofloxacin.  Blood
cultures were drawn and overnight the cellulitis did not
change in appearance.  The plan is to continue warm
compresses and elevation.  However, if the patient develops
fevers, increasing WBC count, or worsening appearance of
cellulitis, acute rehabilitation should consider starting
vancomycin as the cellulitis developed while the patient was
on levofloxacin.

2.  ANEMIA:  The patient's baseline hematocrit is 38-40.
However, on discharge and during this hospitalization, the
patient's hematocrit was lower in the range of 32-34.  The
patient remained Guaiac negative during this hospitalization
and had no obvious signs of bleeding.  The patient will need
follow-up hematocrit checks q.o.d. while at rehabilitation
until the patient is stable.

3.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  The patient was tried on
lisinopril, carvedilol, and Lasix two days before discharge.
However, the patient's blood pressure with the carvedilol
dose dropped from systolics of 90-70.  After a discussion
with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2031**], the CHF attending, the patient should only
be discharged on lisinopril which the patient tolerates with
no blood pressure changes.  In one week, the patient can be
tried on carvedilol while at acute rehabilitation.  If the
patient's blood pressures do not tolerate carvedilol, Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 2031**] or Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] can follow-up in three to four weeks.
If the patient has a weight gain of greater than 3 pounds,
consider starting Lasix at rehabilitation.
