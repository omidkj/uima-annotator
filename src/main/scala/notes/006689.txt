History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 84831**] is a 79 year old female with past medical history of
systolic congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation on
warfarin, diabetes mellitus, COPD, known aortic aneurysm, and
coronary artery disease who presented with dyspnea to the [**Hospital1 **]
[**Location (un) 620**] ED.
.
Per referral notes, she was reported to have shortness of breath
with use of accessory muscles. Referral note recorded full code.
.
In the [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] ED per report and review of records, she was
noted to have a rapid heart rate to 150's-160's, consistent with
atrial fibrillation. Due to respiratory distress, she was
intubated with 120 mg of succinyl choline, and initiated on
phenylephirine for blood pressure support--initially she was
hypertensive with systolic to 180. A central line was placed She
also received 2 grams of cefepime, 750 mg of levofloxacin, 125
mg of solumedrol, 325 mg aspirin, and 150 mg of IV amiodarone.
En route, it was reported that she had bradycardia with heart
rate to 20-30, without hypotension.
.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, once cardiac monitor was attached, no
pulse was noted. At that time--10 AM, and chest compressions
were initiated. She received epinephrine three times and
atropine once, as well as 1 gram of calcium. At 10:12 AM,
ventricular tachycardia was noted, and patient was shocked with
200 joules. Levophed was initiated and she was resuscitated with
intravenous fluids, per report 4 liters prior to transfer. She
also received 1 gram of vancomycin and 4.5 grams of
piperacillin-tazobactam. She was also initiated on amiodarone
drip to help improve control of her heart rate, which was
140-160's after return of circulation.
.
Imaging of the CT chest/abdomen/pelvis revealed thrombosed aorta
below the renal arteries.  Vascular surgery was consulted and
felt that the occlusion was chronic, given the degree of
collaterals noted in the iliacs. There was also noted to be a
question of gall bladder edema, possibly consistent with
cholecysitis. General surgery was consulted, and HIDA scan was
recommended to rule out acute cholecystitis.
.
Cardiology was also consulted, given history of coronary artery
disease, AF, and systolic heart failure. It was recommended that
amiodarone continue for her tachycardia, along with levophed for
blood pressure.
.
At time of transfer to ICU, her vitals were reported to be heart
rate 126, blood pressure of 120/60 on 0.75 mg/kg/min of
levophed, with oxygen saturation of 95% on ventilator.
Her brother was reported to be at the bedside as well.
.
Of note, she was evaluated at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] on [**2185-6-23**], per
documentation, for possible CVA. At that time, an ABG ws
7.22/85/60/34.8, with lactate of 4.0. INR was >10.0, and BNP was
16,677. Her ALT was 709, and AST 901, with normal alk phos and
total bilirubin. A head CT was negative for acute process. She
was transferred to [**Hospital3 **], where she was admitted until
[**2185-6-29**]. She was treated for a CHF exacerbation as well as
COPD exacerbation, with non-invasive ventilation ceftriaxone,
levofloxacin, and steroid taper. LFT abnormalities were
attributed to hepatic congestion from CHF. It appeared that she
may have had a thoracentesis, as pleural fluid was reported as
negative for malignancy.
.
She was admitted [**10/2184**] to [**Hospital1 18**] with respiratory failure
(hypercarbic) and cardiogenic shock with hypotension.  She was
intubated, and then diuresed and extubated. During that
admission a right apical spiculated mass was seen on chest CT as
well as descending thoracic AAA.
.
On the floor, she is intubated and not making any purposeful
movements.
.
After her family arrives, they clarify several points--she was
admitted to [**Hospital1 1774**] as noted above. After that, she was
transferred to a skilled nursing facility, where she has been on
oxygen during the day and BiPAP at night. She was feeling very
well last week, though her family reports that over the weekend
she appeared more tired and somnolent. Her nephew reports that
she did not wear the BiPAP over the last [**2-5**] nights as she
thought the mask did not fit well. Otherwise said she did not
report any cough, shortness of breath, GI complaints, or known
sick contacts--she has been eating well recently. They do report
she was private and did not always share details about her
health.
