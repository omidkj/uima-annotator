INTERPRETATION:

Findings:
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Aneurysmal
interatrial
septum.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Normal regional LV systolic function.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter.
AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR. LV
inflow pattern  c/w impaired relaxation.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Conclusions:
1. The interatrial septum is aneurysmal.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal cavity
size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular
wall motion
is normal. The apex was not well seen.




Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 93410**] was admitted and maintained NPO on iv fluids. Her
abdominal pain as well as bowel funciton did not improve over
the next days. She was taken to the operating room for
diagnostic laparoscopy and then exploratory laparotomy with
lysis of dense adhesions entrapping the small bowel. The
proximal bowel was markedly dilated. Postoperatively, she was
transferred to the surgical floor for further care. On POD 1 she
complained of chest pain. An EKG was obtained, which showed
st-elevation. Cardiology was consulted and recommended to
continue beta-blockers and start aspirin. The chest pain
resolved on nitroglycerin. Four sets of cardiac enzymes were
obtained and within normal limits. Otherwise, she had an
uncomplicated postop course. She developed bowel function in a
timely fashion and tolerated a regular diet at discharge. Her
pain was well controlled on oral pain medications. She was
mobile and walked the hallways without problems. [**Name (NI) **] incision
was clean, dry and intact. Her staples were removed just before
discharge. Leaving the hospital, she was in a good condition.
