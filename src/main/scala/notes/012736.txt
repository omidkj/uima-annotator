Admission Date:  [**2174-4-7**]       Discharge Date:

Date of Birth:   [**2129-2-20**]       Sex:  M

Service:  MICU

ADDITIONAL DIAGNOSES:
1.  Respiratory failure.
2.  Pulmonary embolism.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 45 year old
male with a history of diabetes mellitus, chronic low back
pain and a recent L4-S1 laminectomy representing to [**Hospital1 1444**] Emergency Room from [**Hospital3 6373**] one day after his discharge with a chief
complaint of shortness of breath.

The patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 190**] for a laminectomy of L4 to S1 on [**3-31**] with
indication of sciatica and radiculopathy symptoms.  However,
at rehabilitation he was noted to have shortness of breath
and dyspnea on exertion with decreased oxygen saturation to
79%.  Of note, he has also reported weakness of his
extremities.

Postoperatively he had good strength throughout, however, on
postoperative day he was noted to have weakness.  An MRI was
done which showed postoperative fluid without compression of
the [**Month (only) **] and any evidence of cauda equinus syndrome.

At rehabilitation he continued to have weakness and in the
Emergency Department here was also noted to have possible
four limb paralysis.  In the Emergency Department, he had a
CT angiogram which showed subsegmental pulmonary embolisms,
multiple.  Neurology was consulted for an evaluation.

blood pressure 192/91; heart rate 99; respiratory rate 14 to
20; breathing on SIMV mode 700 by 15 respiratory with PEEP of
5 and FIO2 of 100%.  Generally, he is an intubated sedated
male in a cervical neck collar.  HEENT:  Pupils were equal
and reactive at 2 millimeters but sluggish.  Endotracheal
tube in mouth.  Chest with coarse breath sounds bilaterally
without any wheezing.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm with
no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdomen was soft, nontender,
positive bowel sounds.  Extremities with right femoral groin
triple lumen, no edema.  Right leg was placed in a boot.
Back had a laminectomy site without edema or any drainage.
Neurological:  He was intubated and sedated.

LABORATORY:  Initial labs showed a white blood cell count of
15,400, hematocrit 34.2, platelets 554.  Chemistries were
sodium 138, potassium 4.8, chloride 102, bicarbonate 28, BUN
14, creatinine 0.7, glucose 198.  He had an INR of 1.4 with a
PT of 14.3 and a PTT of 22.4.

Initial CK was 296 and MB 2, and a troponin of less than 0.3.
Chest x-ray showed low lung volumes, endotracheal tube 5
centimeters above the carina.

Head CT scan showed no bleed or no infarction.

CT angiogram showed multiple subsegmental pulmonary
embolisms, left lower lobe pneumonia and a right upper lobe
collapse.

He had an EKG which showed a sinus tachycardia at a rate of
104 with an old T wave inversion in III and a new incomplete
right bundle branch block.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1.  Neurological:  Although the patient was evaluated by
Neurology in the Emergency Department and after weaning was
found to have a four limb paralysis without any elicitable
reflexes, the differential on neurology was a mass
compressing the spinal [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] infectious process or
Guillain-[**Location (un) **] syndrome, or also possibly another
cerebrovascular accident.  The patient had an MRI of his
spinal [**Location (un) **] and brain which showed no new changes.

We than went on a presumptive diagnosis that he had
Guillain-[**Location (un) **] syndrome and was started on IVIG.  Several
days after his initial admission, the patient had an EMG
which was significant for slowing of the majority of his
nerves consistent with a Guillain-[**Location (un) **] syndrome with sural
sparing.  He completed his five day course of IVIG and
remained intubated since he was not able to breath on his own
secondary to diaphragmatic paralysis.  His sedation was
weaned to off and he was alert and followed commands with his
eyes throughout all this.

On the final days of admission, he began to regain some
strength and at the time of this dictation was able to move
his shoulders bilaterally as well as some of his fingers on
his left hand.

2.  PULMONARY:  The patient was intubated on this admission
for respiratory failure, hypercarbic.  This was first
initially thought secondary to pulmonary embolism, however it
was found that his paralysis was most likely due to his
Guillain-[**Location (un) **] syndrome.  he was continued on assist control
ventilation with good oxygenation and ventilation.  He then
had a tracheostomy placed without incident.  It was felt that
he would eventually recover his respiratory strength on his
own.

He was also noted to have a left lower lobe pneumonia on his
admission and was treated with one week of ceftriaxone and
Levofloxacin and ceftriaxone was stopped.  At the time of
this dictation, his infiltrate had resolved.  He should
complete a full two week course of Levofloxacin.

3.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was noted to have guaiac
positive stool with a drifting hematocrit while in-house.  A
gastrointestinal consultation was obtained.  He had an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy significant only for duodenitis.
At the time of this discharge, they were still deciding
whether or not he should have a colonoscopy.  He was given a
proton pump inhibitor and tolerated his tube feeds well
throughout this admission.

4.  CARDIOLOGY:  Hypertension; The patient with significant
hypertension during this admission although he was only on 10
of Lisinopril at home.  He was initially managed on p.r.n.
Labetalol and at the time of this discharge most of his
hypertension had resolved.  He was started on a beta blocker
and Lopressor in addition to his Captopril at that time.

5.  ENDOCRINE:  The patient with diabetes mellitus type 2, on
Glucophage at home.  He had significant hyperglycemia to the
200s and he was started on an insulin drip which was still
being titrated at the time of this dictation.  He should be
changed over to NPH insulin and sliding scale insulin for
rehabilitation.

6.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient with a drifting hematocrit and
at the time of this dictation has received two units of his
own blood.  He is guaiac positive, however, there is also
concern that since he had a femoral line that he may have a
retroperitoneal source given the fact that he is on
intravenous heparin.  At the time of this dictation, we are
still considering colonoscopy.

7.  PULMONARY EMBOLISMS:  The patient with multiple
subsegmental pulmonary embolisms and was continued on
intravenous heparin during this admission.  At the time of
this dictation, he had not yet been started on Coumadin as we
were still considering a colonoscopy.

8.  ORTHOPEDICS:  The patient was followed by the Orthopedics
Service while in-house.  He did have a fluid collection on
his back which was stable and Orthopedics did not see the
need to tap it nor did they see any more interventions.

9.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient did have two fevers, one
to 101.0 F. and one to 100.4 F.  His blood cultures were
always negative and his chest x-ray remained clear after his
initial infiltrate.  There was concern that the fluid
collection in the back might be a source, however, it was not
tapped at the time of this dictation.

10. SACRAL DECUBITUS ULCER:  The patient developed a sacral
decubitus ulcer.  He was followed by Plastic Surgery while
in-house and was given Duoderm dressing changes.

11.  NUTRITION:  The patient was given tube feeds which he
tolerated well throughout his time here.

12.  LINES:  The patient initially had a right femoral down
in the
