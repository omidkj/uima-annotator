Attending:[**Last Name (un) 11974**]
Chief Complaint:
VT storm

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Ventricular Tachycardia ablation

History of Present Illness:
59yoM with nonischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 35% in [**7-12**]), s/p
BiV/ICD device in [**12/2199**] with recent admission for firing in
[**7-12**], chronic afib on dabigatran, HTN, pulm HTN, CKD who
presents with increasing frequency of ICD firing, having gone
off 9 times today, 14 times total in past 1.5 weeks. First
episode of was about 1.5 weeks ago, was seen in clinic 6 days
ago and things settled down by then. Yesterday was at bed bath
and beyond when received first shock and has been going in and
out of VT storm since. Pt denies any chest pain or shortness of
breath, however right before he gets shocked he experiences
feelins of heartburn, jaw pain, diaphosesis and palpitations. He
does not have any sx of heart failure despite recent decrease in
torsemide from 40->30 mg/daily and aldactone 25mg -->12.5 mg.
Volume status is euvolemic currently.
.
He was recently admitted to the hospital in [**2206-7-2**] for an
increasing frequency of symptomatic ventricular tachycardia
noted on device interrogations. It was noted that he was on
Amiodarone 200mg daily instead of 400mg daily when these
episodes occurred. Cardiac catheterization (left sided) was done
which showed no evidence of coronary artery disease. His
amiodarone dose was increased to 600 mg daily with plan to
decrease to 200mg twice daily after two weeks - which he is
currently on. Prior to this admission, he reports that whenever
he got defribrillated he would be out and did not feel anything.

.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.
In the ER, initial VS:
He received lidocaine bolus and was started on a gtt. On
transfer from the ER, VS 98.6 po 92/67 70 15 96&2L

Brief Hospital Course:
59yoM with nonischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 35% in [**7-12**]), s/p
BiV/ICD device in [**12/2199**] with recent admission for firing in
[**7-12**], chronic afib on coumadin, HTN, pulm HTN, osa, CKD who
presents with VT storm.

# Ventricular Tachycardia:
The pt was admitted to the CCU and started on a Lidocaine drip
from rhythm control. He underwent a VT  ablation procedure for
prior multiple episodes of Vtach s/p ICD firings. He was found
to have VT with multiple morphologies, epicardial in origin. The
procedure was complicated by a RV puncture during difficult
epicardial access resulting in a stable pericardial effusion
without signs of tamponade physiology. Following the procedure
the pt was restarted on Amiodarone and Mexilitene and sent back
to CCU for observation. He was noted to have a new pericardial
rub presen
