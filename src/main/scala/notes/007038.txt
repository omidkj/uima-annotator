History of Present Illness:
This is a 60yoF w NSCLC dx in [**12-14**] c/b brain mets s/p brain XRT
and has h/o recent admission for occipital stroke [**Date range (1) 75354**]/08. Pt
presented to outpt oncology clinic for regular scheduled
appointment for chemo when she was found to be weak and w/BP
69/49. In the office, she received 500cc IVF and BP increased to
91/55. Per pt, she had had steroid doses increased a few weeks
ago and since has been tapering doses. She notes that she's had
bilateral upper extremity weakness for ~3wks which she feels is
progressively worsening. She associates it w/steroid use. She
denies fever/chills/n/v, d/c/abdominal pain. Endorses fatigue
and her most bothersome complaint is blurry vision which was her
presenting complaint on her prior admission. She ntoes that
she's had some difficulty word-finding over the past month but
denies ha/dizzyness. Denies cp/palpitations/sob, but endorses
cough x 3d, nonproductive, no other URI sx associated.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was afebrile w/ BP 94/60 HR NSR 96-97% on 2L. She
was given Prednisone 20mg PO and Decadron 4mg IV for presumed
adrenal suppression. She also received CeftriaXONE 1g IV and
Levofloxacin 500mg IV. She was started on Norepinephrine for BP
support after receiving 4L NS and a LIJ was placed under sterile
conditions. CTA (-) for PE, and on echo in ED no significant
pericardial effusion was noted. U/A negative, and no changes
were noted on EKG.

IMAGING
CXR [**2-22**] - 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
2.  Known left upper lobe spiculated mass concerning for
malignancy is not
clearly visualized.  Please refer to the CT torso from [**2103-2-10**]
for additional details.

CTA chest [**2-22**] - 1.  Linear filling defect within a subsegmental
branch of the superior segment of the right pulmonary artery
likely attributable to motion artifact.  The finding represents
a true pulmonary embolus, the size and location of the filling
defect make it of doubtful clinical significance.  No evidence
of aortic dissection.
2.  14-mm spiculated left upper lobe nodule with mediastinal and
left hilar lymphadenopathy consistent with history of
non-small-cell lung cancer.

CXR [**2-24**] -  No significant interval change versus prior with no
evidence for acute cardiopulmonary disease.

MRI head [**2-27**] - Evolving lesions in bilateral occipital lobes
and centrum semiovale bilaterally, differential is unchanged and
includes PRES or embolic ischemia/vasculitis. No new lesions are
identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 60 yo F with history of NSCLC complicated by brain
mets recently discharged after admission for stroke now
presenting with hypotension.

#  Hypotension - The patient was initially bolused 4 L IVF in
the ED without much response in her BPs and was placed on
levophed gtt on arrival to the ICU. She was given 2 L of
additional IVF boluses with success in weaning her off levophed.
The differential diagnosis included dehydration [**3-10**] poor po
intake, infection, adrenal insufficiency, or possible PE. A
chest CTA was negative for PE. Cardiac ischemia was unlikely
given a EKG without ischemic changes. The patient did have
elevated troponins, but in the setting of flat CKs and renal
failure. Infection was unlikely given a negative CXR, negative
UA and lack of fevers. She was given stress doses of IV
dexamethasone for likely adrenal insufficiency (pt on steroids
at home due to brain mets, has not tolerated decreases in
steroid doses in past). At the time of transfer out of the ICU,
the patient had no longer required pressors for BP support for >
48 hours. On the oncology floor, the endocrinology service was
consulted and felt strongly that this was not adrenal
insufficiency since she was still taking large dose of steroids
at home. She was slowly weaned off of her steroids by 4 mg
weekly. There were no subsequent episodes of hypotension. All of
her antihypertensives were held during her stay and on
discharge.

#  Elevated troponins - In setting of ARF, EKG w/o ischemic
changes. There were no episodes of chest pain during her stay.

#  Confusion/word finding difficulty/blurry vision - Likely
residual from bilateral occipital strokes. Continued on
dipyridamole and full dose ASA. A repeat MRI brain showed
evolution of the lesions consistent with either stroke or
posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). Neurology
felt that patient exhibited signs of lower [**Last Name (un) 75355**] neuron weakness
consistent with possible steroid-induced myopathy. An MRI spine
was performed which was pending at time of discharge.

#  ARF - On presentation, Cr 1.3, up from baseline Cr 0.8. This
resolved with IVFs.

#  NSCLC - Stage IV c/b mets to brain, s/p brain whole brain
XRT. The patient was followed by her oncologist during ICU
admission. After her ICU stay, she was begun on chemotherapy
with her first round of carbplatin and gemcytabine on [**3-1**]. She
tolerated this well with no nausea or vomiting.

# Cough - No evidence of infection on imaging, afebrile.
Finished a 5 day course of azithromycin for presumed bronchitis.
Then started on cough suppressants prn.
.
# Hyperlipidemia:  Continued outpt crestor and zetia

# HTN: Held home anti-hypertensives given hypotension.

# Code: pt confirmed DNR/DNI on this admission.
