Chief Complaint:
dyspnea, fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
56yoW with metastatic BAC lung ca on weekly Taxol-carboplatinum
who presented to the ED on [**7-30**] with fever and dyspnea. She had
a recent hospitalization on the thoracic surgery service
[**Date range (1) 31081**] with large left spontaneous pneumothorax that was
treated with a chest tube and removed prior to discharge with a
residual small left apical pneumothorax. She had been in her
normal state of health on intermittent home oxygen (2L n/c)until
[**7-29**] when she developed a cough productive of clear sputum with
blood streaking and a fever to 100.8. On initial presentation to
the ED T 102.3 HR 131 BP 136/65 RR 16 84%RA, 95% 2Lnc. CXR
showed persistant but not enlarged left apical PTX and a new RUL
consolidation. CTAngiogram of chest was negative for PE. She was
treated with cefepime, vancomycin, and metronidazole for concern
of pneumonia. Thoracic surgery was consulted. She desaturated on
2Lnc to 80% and was placed on a 100%non-rebreather with O2
saturation improving to 99%. She denied having chest pain,
tightness, or pleuritic pain. She was admitted to the MICU for
antibiotic treatment and was weaned to 2L O2 by n/c.  Prior to
transfer out of the ICU she felt much better and was anxious to
go home.

ribs, currently on Taxol-carboplatinum

Pertinent Results:
Labs on admission:
Na 140, K 3.7, Cl 100, Bicarb 30, BUN 30, Cr 0.5
WBC 5.5, Hgb 9.8, Hct 27.7
.
Labs on discharge:
hgb 8.6, plt 305, wbc 4.2
INR 1.5
.
Urine and blood cultures negative
.
sputum culture not accepted
.
CXR
1) Stable small left apical pneumothorax, unchanged from
[**2180-7-25**].
2) Interval worsening right upper lobe opacity, likely
infectious or
aspiration related given its rapid development.
3) Mild interval worsening in left mid and lower lung zone
opacities, which
may be related to the patient's underlying tumor and/or
infection/aspiration.
Correlate with the subsequent CT.
4) Persisting small left pleural effusion.
5) At least one destructive left-sided rib lesion, likely a
metastasis.
.
CTA chest: no pulmonary embolus.  Numerous ill-defined lung
nodules bilaterally with more confluent opacity in the left
upper lobe, bronchial narrowing, and  irregular interlobular
septal thickening and ground- glass opacities representing
metastatic BAC.  Increase in size of soft tissue mass destroying
a portion of the T7 vertebral body and medial left 7th rib.
Deformity of the left 6th rib at the site of previously seen
destructive lesion.  Chronic fracture deformity of theleft
lateral 8th rib.  Pneumothorax on the left, approximately 15% of
the left hemithorax.



Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 56yoW with metastatic bronchoalveolar lung cancer with a
recent admission for spontaneous pneumothorax presenting with
fever, dyspnea, persistant small-moderate pneumothorax.
.
# Dyspnea/Fever: Ms. [**Known lastname 31082**] presentation of fever, dyspnea,
productive cough and known sick contacts were considered most
concerning for pneumonia. PE was considered however the patient
was therapeutic on coumadin and CT angiogram of the chest,
although poor study, was negative.  Ms. [**Known lastname 16462**] was therefore
treated broadly to cover for community and hospital aquired
pneumonia with ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and azithromycin.  She
was hypoxic on presentation above her baseline need for 2L n/c
oxygen.  She was placed on a 100% non-rebreather mask with good
oxygenation in the emergency room and spent one night in the
intensive care unit where she was treated supportively and was
rapidly weaned back to nasal cannula oxygen and was transferred
to the floor the next day.  Her dyspnea improved along with her
hypoxia.  Ms. [**Known lastname 16462**] remained afebrile the rest of her admission
and the aggressiveness of her antibiotic regimen was weaned,
first with the discontinuation of vancomycin.  She was
transitioned to cefdinir and azithromycin oral therapy prior to
discharge without decompensation.  She received her usual home
regimen of inhalers as well.  She was encouraged to walk and was
able to walk with 2 L N/C maintaining oxygen saturations>92%
prior to discharge.
.
# Lung ca: patient getting weekly Taxol. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] following
and will decide on therapy.  She was continued on dexamethasone
.
# Depression-Ms. [**Known lastname 16462**] has struggled with longstanding
depression.  It was decided to increase her zoloft to 100 qday.
.
# Anemia: Ms. [**Known lastname 16462**] has a normocytic normochromic anemia.
Studies are suggestive of anemia of chronic disease/likely
hypoproliferation secondary to chemotherapy. Will transfuse for
hct<25.
.
# Anticoagulation: Ms. [**Known lastname 16462**] was continued on her home regimen
of comadin at 5mg qday.  She became supratherapeutic with the
institution of antibiotics and her dose was decreased and she
became subtherapeutic.  She is sent out with her home regimen
and instructions to follow up with her PCP this week for INR
check
