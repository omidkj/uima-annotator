Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**]
Chief Complaint:
"Tachy-brady syndrome"


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

-dual chamber pacer placement

History of Present Illness:
HPI: Ms. [**Known lastname 1263**] is a 75 y/o female with PMH significant for
COPD/asthma, systolic CHF (EF<20%), HTN, Afib, CRI (baseline Cr
1.1), and seizure d/o, with recent [**Hospital1 18**] admission from [**2168-8-17**]
to [**2168-9-22**], who presents from rehab with Afib/Aflutter that was
difficult to rate control. She was initially admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
[**8-17**] for resp distress thought [**2-10**] COPD failure and CHF, and
eventually transferred to CCU for tailored CHF therapy. Major
issues during this extended hospitalization included rate
control of a fib s/p failed cardioversion, amiodarone (increased
LFTs) and procainamide trials without effect, failed rate
control as dilt caused hypotension, as well as placement of a
trach after development of pneumonia, contained bowel
perforation, maroon-colored stools and GI bleed, and management
of volume overload. She was subsequently discharged to [**Hospital **]
hospital. Discharged on Dig 0.25 mcg qd as only nodal blocking
[**Doctor Last Name 360**].
.
She now returns from NESH after noted to have HR in 140s
(flutter), given extra dose of 12.5 mg PO Lopressor, and
subsequently having a [**3-11**] second pause at rehab.
.
In ED, was noted to have ABG with hypoxia/hypercarbia, CXR
consistent with mild CHF though improved from prior with
elevated BUN/Cr and seeming dry on exam. Also with leukocytosis,
left shift, bandemia; lactate wnl. Troponin T elevated at 0.17
from first set. In ED, NGT and PIV placed, received 500cc NS,
Levaquin 500mg, Vanc 1gm, Tylenol 650mg. Evaluated by Cards
fellow, felt to be likely infected with early ARF. Cards fellow
recommended decreasing digoxin to 0.125, checking dig level,
considering cautious hydration, normalizing electrolytes,
avoiding lopressor with consideration of pindolol as an
alternative, holding anticoagulation, and consulting EP for
possible AVN ablation +PPM.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 74 y/o female with CHF (EF <20%), h/o afib/flutter s/p
failed cardioversion, COPD, HTN, renal insufficiency, h/o GIB,
now presenting with atrial flutter/tachycardia to 150s and
bradycardia with pauses of as long as [**3-11**] secs. Unsuccessful
ablation therapy. Now s/p permanent dual chamber pacer
placement.
.
1. Tachy-brady syndrome: The pt has past history of atrial
flutter/fib. The pt may have gone into aflutter this time
secondary to infection vs. hypoxia vs. prerenal failure. On
admission the pt's digoxin level was decreased to 0.125 per EP
and she was maintained on this level throughout her admission.
On [**2168-10-21**] EP evaluated the pt for flutter ablation. EP
evaluated the pt for atrial ablation which was performed.
However, on [**10-23**] the pt had recurrent episodes of tachy/brady
with HRs as hisg as the 150s and as low as the 30s. The pt was
asx during periods of tachy, lightheaded/pre-syncopal during
brady, That evening a temporary pacer was placed after gaining
consent from the pt's HCP. The following day a permanent dual
chamber pacemaker was placed. EP has followed the pacer since
placement. The pt's HR has been well-controlled since placement
and the pacer was adequate upon EP interrogation.

2. CV
#? Ischemia: On admission the pt experienced ST depressions in
inferior leads and V2-V6. However, these changes were felt to be
[**2-10**] to dig effectc. The pt's troponin was initially slightly
elevated. However, the pt's cardiac enzymes contined to cycle
down.
#Pump: The pt has a h/o of significant CHF (EF 20% by echo).
Throughout admission, the pt remained euvolemic-to-hypovolemic
on exam. She was diuresed gently as needed. She was started and
maintained on lisinopril and hydralazine.

#Rhythm: as above.
.
3. Leukocytosis/fever: Following permanent pacer placement, the
pt spiked a temp to 103 and had elevated WBCs. Pan cxs were sent
and her right SC cordis was removed. The pt demonstrated no
evidence of pna on exam or cxr. Blood cxs were all negative,
therefore infected pacer lines were felt to be unlikely. The pt
was initially treated with keflex. However, her Ucx grew out
enterococcus. It was also postulated that given her longterm NG,
the pt possibly has sinusitis. The pt was started on a 7 day
course of augmentin for UTI and possible sinusitis. After the
pt's initial spike, her temp has trended down and on the day of
d/c was 98 off all antipyretics.
.
4. Resp Failure s/p trach: The pt has been at [**Hospital1 **]
long term for ventilator maintenance and possible weaning. She
was a h/o COPD. During her stay, potential vent weaning was
deferred until til discharge. She was continued on
albuterol-ipratropium nebs. She was given supplemental oxygen as
required.
.
5. ARF/CRI: Upon presentation the pt had an elevated BUN and Cr.
She was pre-renal by FENA (0.21%). Her renal function resolved
shortly after admission.
