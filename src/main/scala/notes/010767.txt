CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Right frontal parietal stroke.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 84 year old gentleman
with a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and one
vessel coronary artery disease, who presented on the day of
admission with inability to see the left half of his field of
view.  According to his family, the patient seemed "space"
and did not recognize that he had a deficit.  The patient was
initially brought to [**Hospital6 2910**] where it
was felt that the patient was having a stroke.  An
electrocardiogram done there revealed what appeared to be
atrial fibrillation.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] Emergency Department and was
evaluated.  There on telemetry he was observed to be in
atrial fibrillation, however, there were no twelve lead
electrocardiograms done during the time in the Emergency
Department that documented this.  The patient was evaluated
by neurology and it was felt that the patient should get CAT
scan of the head.  This appeared to reveal an early
infarction in the right frontal parietal area.  The patient
was sent to MR of the head.  While in the MR, the patient had
an episode of chest pain, one to two out of ten in intensity,
midline sternum.  This was similar to his chest pain in the
previous year when he had a stent to the diagonal artery.  He
was given sublingual Nitroglycerin and the pain went away.
There were no ischemic changes on electrocardiogram of note.
The patient was finally transferred up to the CCU under the
Neurology Intensive Care Unit service.  He was watched
expectantly to look for signs of evolving stroke.  He had
further episodes of chest pain while in the Intensive Care
Unit.  At this time, cardiac enzymes from admission in the
Emergency Department revealed a troponin leak in the 2.0 to
3.0 range, however, the creatinine-kinase remained in the
100s.  The patient was evaluated by Cardiology for the
significance of the troponin leak.  It was felt initially
that this did not represent ischemic angina.  He was
transferred to the Medicine service for further evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Hypercholesterolemia.
3.  Severe one vessel coronary artery disease, status post
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent to
the second diagonal in [**2160-5-16**].
4.  Cataracts.
5.  History of prostate cancer.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Verapamil.
2.  Triamterene.
3.  Atorvastatin.
4.  Casodex.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone in [**Location (un) 9188**] on [**Hospital3 15516**] and his family lives in the [**Location (un) 86**] area.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon presentation, temperature
afebrile, blood pressure approximately 144/80, heart rate
80s, oxygen saturation 98% on two liters nasal cannula,
respiratory rate about 18.  General examination - This was a
well appearing elderly man, appearing younger than his stated
age.  On head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination, he
had moist mucous membranes and no audible carotid bruits
bilaterally.  The lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally with just a few coarse breath sounds heard
intermittently.  The cardiac examination revealed a regular
rate and rhythm, without murmurs, rubs or gallops.  The
abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended, with positive
bowel sounds.  The extremities showed no pedal edema.  His
neurological examination revealed a patient who is alert and
oriented to time and place.  Speech was fluent,
comprehensible.  His naming and repetition were intact. He
had on cranial nerve examination a left homonymous
hemianopsia which appeared to be worse in the inferior
quadrant rather than the superior quadrant.  He otherwise had
cranial nerves intact.  His motor examination was notable for
only mild weakness on the left upper extremity, and otherwise
both sides were equal in strength.  The coordination appeared
to be intact bilaterally to finger-nose-finger.  The sensory
examination revealed only impairment of proprioception in the
right big toe.  His sensation appeared to be intact to pin
prick.  The gait was not tested.

LABORATORY DATA:  Upon transfer to Medicine, laboratories
were significant for troponin to about 2.7.  This fluctuated
in its level with again normal creatinine-kinase.  His renal
function remained stable between 1.1 to 1.4.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Stroke - The neurology team felt that his blood pressure
should initially be kept between 150 and 180.  This was
attempted, however, because of his intermittent atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate, he had to be put on
a beta blocker.  In addition, he had a new echocardiogram on
[**2161-11-30**], which revealed an ejection fraction of 25% and
global left ventricular systolic dysfunction.  For this
reason, he was placed on ace inhibitor as well as beta
blocker and this subsequently lowered his blood pressure.
His deficit appeared stable and was notable no major motor
deficits.  Follow-up MRA revealed the possibility of carotid
internal carotid artery disease of the siphon.  Transcranial
Dopplers were pending at the time of this dictation.  Carotid
ultrasounds revealed no extracranial hemodynamically
compromised carotid disease.  The mechanism of the patient's
stroke was felt to be embolic from atrial fibrillation.
Therefore, it was recommended that he be started on Coumadin
for anticoagulation.

2.  Chest pain - The patient's chest pain continued to
predominate with at least one to two episodes per day during
the hospitalization.  Each time electrocardiograms were done
and revealed no ischemic changes.  However, in light of the
patient's history and increasing symptoms, cardiology was
consulted and they recommended cardiac catheterization to
look at the coronary arteries.  The catheterization results
revealed that he had stable coronary artery disease.  They
did note, however, he had an elevated left ventricular end
diastolic pressure and felt that chest pain was possibly due
to wall stress due to left heart failure due to chronic
hypertension.  The patient was put on long acting nitrates
and titrated to decrease chest pain.  In addition, the
patient was diuresed to reduce afterload as well as reduction
in blood pressure to reduce afterload and this was felt to
result in the relief of his chest pain.

3.  Atrial fibrillation - The patient is found to be
intermittently in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with most of
the time being in normal sinus rhythm.  The patient was
started on Coumadin at 5 mg p.o. once daily.

4.  Heart failure - The patient was started on Metoprolol,
Captopril, Digoxin at 0.125 mg p.o. once daily, and diuresed
with Lasix 40 mg intravenously once daily times three days.
He had good effect with the diuresis.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To [**Hospital3 **].

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. once daily.
2.  Isosorbide Dinitrate 20 mg p.o. three times a day.
3.  Captopril 12.5 mg p.o. three times a day.
4.  Warfarin 5 mg p.o. once daily.
5.  Metoprolol 12.5 mg p.o. twice a day.
6.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. once daily.
7.  Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o. once daily.
8.  Atorvastatin 10 mg p.o. once daily.
9.  Casodex 50 mg p.o. once daily.

There may be an addendum to the medications at a later date.
