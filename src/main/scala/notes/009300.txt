[**2181-5-10**] CXR:IMPRESSION: Interval cardiomegaly and fluid overload
indicating mild cardiac failure. Small right pleural effusion.
Followup examination is recommended after appropriate clinical
interval. Findings discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] by telephone at
time of interpretation.
.
[**2181-5-11**] Cardiac [**Month/Day/Year **]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.  The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is a moderate to large sized pericardial
effusion. There is right ventricular diastolic collapse,
consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology; the
right ventricle also appears compressed. There is significant,
accentuated respiratory variation in mitral valve inflows,
consistent with  impaired ventricular filling.
.
[**2181-5-14**]  Cardiac [**Month/Day/Year **]
Conclusions:
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal  (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal.  The aortic valve leaflets
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. There is a small (1-1.5cm;
?loculated pericardial effusion around the right atrium. No
effusion is seen around the right ventricle or left ventricle.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2181-5-12**], the
?loculated
effusion around the right atrium is slightly larger, but
hemodynamic
compromise is not suggested.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 54 year old woman with a past medical history
significant for treated tuberculosis as a child and mild
hypertension who presented to her PCP with shortness of breath.
A PA and Lateral chest x-ray revealed cardiomegaly and an
admission cardiac [**Month/Day/Year **] revealed a pericardial effusion with
tamponade physiology.  A pericardial drain was placed which
relieved the patient's symptoms.  The patient also had a large
right sided pleural effusion which was drained.  Neither fluid
contained any organisms on gram stain (including specific stains
for tuberculosis).  Cultures had not grown anything at the time
of discharge.  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 6**] [**Doctor First Name **] was checked and felt to be non-specific at
1:40.  A TSH was elevated at 6.1 but the free T4 was normal at
1.7.  The patient was never febrile and she never developped an
elevated white blood cell count.
.
Again, the patient's dyspnea resolved with drainage of her
pericardial fluid.  She did have some pain at the pericardial
drainage and thoracentesis sites for which she was treated with
percocet.  She was noted to have an elevated hematocrit, which
was thought to be unrelated to her pericarditis.  It was
determined that she should fol
