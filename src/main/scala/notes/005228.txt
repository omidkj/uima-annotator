HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Mr. [**Known lastname 20240**] is an 88-year-old
male who was referred to Dr.[**Name (NI) 6444**] clinic on [**5-11**] by a
urologist by the name of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who is a urologist in
[**Hospital 882**] Hospital, for a bladder tumor.  He carries a
diagnosis of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder,
which reportedly had been causing an obstructed left ureter.
On visiting Dr.[**Name (NI) 6444**] office on the 12th, the patient had
copious clots irrigated from the patient's bladder via a
Foley catheter that was placed at the appointment.  It
appeared that the patient was probably losing a significant
amount of blood out of his bladder, so the patient was
immediately admitted to [**Hospital1 69**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Includes a 15 year history of
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, chemical
pleurodesis in [**2161**] for three spontaneous pneumothoraces
secondary to a long history of smoking, and emphysema and
blebs, bilateral inguinal hernia repair in [**2160**], left
inguinal hernia reoperated in [**2162**], bilateral cataract
surgery in the 70s.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   The patient quit cigarettes in [**2133**].  He
has a 100 pack year history.  Quit drinking alcohol in [**2133**].
He was a truck driver, retired in [**2130**].

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  Tambocor 100 mg by mouth every morning and 50
mg by mouth every evening, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg by
mouth every morning, Diltiazem 240 mg by mouth every evening,
Digoxin 250 mcg every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, Flomax .4
mg every morning, Zestril 10 mg by mouth every morning.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission, the patient's
temperature was 97.1 degrees, vital signs stable.  Physical
examination significant at the time for a distended abdomen,
consistent with a mass in the suprapubic area, thought to be
a bladder filled with clots.

LABORATORY DATA:   Hematocrit on admission 28.8, creatinine
2.5.  The patient, per his primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Name Initial (NameIs) **]
baseline creatinine of 2.2.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital.
Additional clots were irrigated from the patient's bladder,
and he was started on continuous bladder irrigation.  He was
transfused a unit of packed red blood cells.  Considering his
history of atrial fibrillation for 15 years and several
cardiac medications, a preoperative Cardiology consult was
obtained.  They made several recommendations, and recommended
that the patient no longer be on Digoxin because it is
renally cleared and the patient has impaired creatinine
clearance.  They instead recommended that he be put on beta
blocker perioperatively and postoperatively.  He did undergo
a preoperative echocardiogram which showed a left ventricular
ejection fraction of 55%.

On [**5-13**], the patient underwent radical cystoproctatectomy
with ileal loop urinary diversion for a preoperative
diagnosis of invasive bladder cancer.  Postoperative
diagnosis is also invasive bladder cancer.  Findings
intraoperatively included a bladder full of blood clots and a
markedly enlarged prostate.  The patient was extubated in the
operating room, brought to the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit, and
then transferred to the Intensive Care Unit postoperatively
for close cardiopulmonary monitoring.

The patient was quite hypertensive postoperatively, and
required treatment with intravenous Lopressor, intravenous
enalapril.  His blood pressure continued to be high, and the
patient was put on a Diltiazem drip.  However, he went into a
2:1 AV nodal block, and the Diltiazem drip was discontinued.
The patient's blood pressures were thus controlled with
intravenous enalapril, intravenous Lopressor, and as needed
Hydralazine.

The patient, on postoperative day one, was doing well, making
good urine output.  He did pull out one of his ureteral
stents when he became disoriented on postoperative day one.
The patient was continued on Kefzol and Flagyl for five days
postoperatively.

The patient was kept nothing by mouth with a nasogastric tube
for several days postoperatively, as he had no bowel sounds
and no reports of flatus.  The patient had some tachycardia
in the low 100s on [**2163-5-17**].  He had an electrocardiogram that
was done that showed that the patient continued to be in
sinus rhythm and was not in atrial fibrillation, and he was
ruled out appropriately with a set of CPKs.

On [**5-18**], postoperative day five, the patient continued to
do well.  He had some hypoactive bowel sounds.  He was
advanced to a clear diet, and he was put back on all of his
oral antihypertensive and cardiac medications, and was
transferred to the floor.

On [**5-19**], the patient's central venous line was
discontinued, and the patient's right ureteral stent was
discontinued.  On [**5-20**], the patient was advanced to a
regular diet.  [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] fluid was sent for creatinine,
and the creatinine level was 2 after it had been 1 two days
previously.  The [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain was discontinued on [**5-21**], and the patient was discharged to rehabilitation on the
22nd.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Tambocor 100 mg by mouth every morning and 50 mg by mouth
every evening
2.  Labetalol 200 mg by mouth twice a day
3.  Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg by mouth once daily
4.  Zestril 10 mg by mouth once daily
5.  Protonix 40 mg by mouth once daily
6.  Percocet one to two tablets by mouth every four hours as
needed for pain
7.  Colace 100 mg by mouth twice a day, hold for loose stools
8.  Tylenol 650 mg by mouth every four hours as needed for
fever

One thing of note, the patient, after being transferred out
of the Intensive Care Unit, was put on labetalol, which
seemed to control his blood pressure very well, and the
Medicine team, who was taking care of the patient in the
Intensive Care Unit, felt that that would be a good
medication long-term, however, the patient should definitely
see his former cardiologist to adjust his antihypertensive
and cardiac medications within one to two weeks.  The patient
will also follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 365**], and will call his office
for an appointment.
