Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
46-yo-man w/ active cocaine use presents w/ LE edema.  10 days
ago, he developed b/l LE edema that has gotten progressively
worse until now.  Three days ago, he developed dyspnea on
exertion when climbing stairs, assoc w/ 2-pillow orthopnea and
PND.  He denies any recent chest pain, palpitations, headache,
confusion, weakness, numbness, abd pain, or hematuria.  No
recent viral syndromes or URIs.  He does admit to cocaine use
last night. Today, his wife convinced him to present to the ED
for evaluation.
.
In the ED, his BP was 230/170.  BNP was elevated at 7500.  CXR
revealed evidence of cardiomegaly and pulm edema.  He was
treated w/ ASA 325 mg, lasix 10 mg IV, and hydralazine 10 mg IV
x 2.  He responded well to lasix w/ good UOP, but diastolic BP
remained elevated at 170, prompting initiation of nitroprusside
gtt.  He is now admitted to the CCU for further care.

none

significant for current tobacco use.  Drinks 3-4 beers a few
times weekly, no h/o withdrawal symptoms, seizures or DTs.

.
EKG demonstrated NSR at 87 bpm, nl axis, nl int, LVH w/ strain
pattern, no ischemic changes.
.
CXR:  Moderate to severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette,
and  particularly the left atrium accompanied by pulmonary
vascular  congestion and mild pulmonary edema consistent with
heart failure.
.
Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate
symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with mild cavity dilation and severe
global
hypokinesis. No left ventricular thrombus is seen. Tissue
Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with severe free wall
hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are minimally thickened. No aortic
stenosis or
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally
normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a
very small circumferential pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate symmetric eft ventricular hypertrophy with
severe global
biventricular hypokinesis c/w diffuse process (toxin, metabolic,
cannot
exclude myocarditis; in the absence of LVH on ECG, an
infiltrative process
should also be considered). Mild mitral regurgitation. Moderate
pulmonary
arterial hypertension. Very small circumferential pericardial
effusion.
Possible abnormality on the aortic valve as described above
without aortic
regurgitation. .
If clinically indicated a TEE would be better able to define an
abnormality of
the aortic valve.
.

.


Brief Hospital Course:
46-yo-man w/ cocaine abuse presents w/ LE edema and DOE likely
from diastolic heart failure in the setting of cocaine use
complicated by hypertensive urgency.
.
Hypertensive urgency:  BP 230/170 on presentation, most likely
from chronic HTN exacerbated by cocaine use.  No signs of
end-organ damage at present except for elevated creatinine,
which is more likely a chronic problem. The patient was started
on labetalol and Lisinopril. His blood pressure was taken down
from 230 systolic to approx 160 systolic/100 diastolic on
discharge. His lower extremity edema improved with diuresis. An
echo performed on admission showed an LF EF of 25%. It is hoped
with good blood pressure control and use of an ACE-I with follow
up in addition to cocaine abstaining will improved his cardiac
function.
.
Renal Failure: creatinine on admission was 1.6 Likely acute
hypertensive nephropathy plus probalbe long-standing
hypertensive disease. discharged on ACE-I.
.
Substance Use: Social work saw patient and counceled him
regarding substance abuse.
.
