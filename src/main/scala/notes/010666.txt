HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 88 year-old
female with a history of coronary artery disease status post
coronary artery bypass graft times two, congestive heart
failure with ejection fraction of 35%, paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation status post DDD pacer placement, admitted
[**2185-12-22**] with sudden onset of right eye pain at home.  She
subsequently developed slurred speech and was taken to the
Emergency Department via EMS.  In the Emergency Department
the patient was noted to have slurred speech and a left
hemiparesis.  CAT scan was negative for hemorrhage, but
positive for a probable embolic right MCA stroke.  TPA was
administered in the Emergency Department without benefit.
The patient developed respiratory distress in the Emergency
Department requiring supplemental oxygen, Lasix and a trial
of a noninvasive ventilator.

The patient was subsequently transferred to the MICU.  Blood
pressure was elevated on admission to 160 to 180.  Symptoms
of congestive heart failure were controlled with a
nitroglycerin drip initially.  Neurological examination
revealed complete left sided hemiplegia with decreased
sensation of the left arm and a left facial droop.  The
patient has required no further diuresis in the MICU.  Blood
pressures were running in the 120s to 130s.  Nitroglycerin
drip was discontinued on [**2185-12-22**] upon arrival to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.  Speech and swallow evaluation on
[**2185-12-23**] recommended nectar thick liquids since the patient
was considered to be at aspiration risk.  A repeat head CT on
[**12-22**] showed a large right MCA stroke unchanged from prior.
The patient's creatinine was slightly increased from
baseline, but her urine output was good.  An increased white
blood cell count was noted on [**12-22**] considered to be stress
response versus evidence of infection and cultures were sent.

On [**12-22**] and [**12-23**] the patient was noted to have increased
alertness complaining of a headache with an unchanged
neurological examination.  On [**12-23**] systolic blood pressure
was running 100 to 110 with the head of the bed at 30 degrees
elevation.  The patient was alert and interactive though not
opening her eyes.  She was subsequently transferred to the
floor.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Coronary artery disease status
post coronary artery bypass graft times two in [**2181**]
complicated by a left ventricular aneurysm status post
patched graft and third degree heart block.  2.  History of
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation status post DDD pacer.  3.
Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 35%.  4.
Hypertension.  5.  Hyperthyroid.  6.  Chronic renal
insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.4.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Cozaar 25 mg po q.d., Lasix 40 mg po
q.d., enteric coated aspirin, Ambien, Lipitor, Levoxyl.

MEDICATIONS AT MICU:  Protonix 40 mg q.d., Tylenol, subQ
heparin and enteric coated aspirin.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON TRANSFER FROM THE MICU:  Vital signs
temperature 98.2.  Pulse 61.  Blood pressure 121/56.
Respiratory rate 20.  Pulse ox 100% on room air.
Examination, the patient is lying in bed with her eyes
closed, unable to open them, but is interactive and responds
to questions and commands.  Mental status, the patient is
oriented to hospital, state, but not year.  She is oriented
to the reason for her hospitalization and answers questions
appropriately.  HEENT she has dry oral mucosa.  The tongue is
midline.  She is unable to raise her eyelids.  The pupils are
poorly reactive bilaterally, but the patient does respond to
light stimuli.  There is poor response to threat bilaterally.
We were unable to assess visual fields and extraocular
movements at this time.  Neck was supple with no bruits.
Cardiovascular, regular, 2 out of 6 systolic murmur best at
the right upper sternal border.  Lungs were with rhoncerous
breath sounds bilaterally in the anterior lung fields.
Abdomen is soft, mild, diffuse tenderness to palpation with
no rebound or guarding and active bowel sounds.  Extremities
no edema.  There are several small raised red lesions on the
distal lower extremities.

Neurological examination the patient's sensation is intact.
The patient is able to open her jaw against resistance and
shrug her shoulders.  She has a left sided visual field
defect/neglect.  Sensation, there is no response to light
touch to the left arm.  She does sense touch on the right
arm.  Light touch sensation is intact bilaterally in the
lower extremities.  Strength of the left arm is flaccid with
0 out of 5 strength.  The left leg is also flaccid.  The
right arm shows 5 out of 5 biceps and triceps.  The right leg
3 out of 5 hip extension, 5 out of 5 ankle flexion and
extension.  Reflexes, biceps 2+ bilaterally, brachial
radialis 2+ bilaterally, patellar 1+ bilaterally.  Toes are
down going on the right and up going on the left.

LABORATORY STUDIES ON TRANSFER FROM INTENSIVE CARE UNIT:
Hematocrit 34.9, white blood cell count 10.4, INR 1.1.
Urinalysis showed large blood, negative nitrite, greater then
50 red blood cells, 3 to 5 white blood cells, few bacteria
and no epithelial cells.  Sodium 150, potassium 3.5, chloride
110, bicarbonate 32, BUN 39, creatinine 1.5, glucose 350,
calcium 8.0, phosphate 32.6, magnesium 2.2, albumin 3.2.
Blood cultures and urine cultures were negative at that time.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Neurological:  The patient is admitted
with a large right MCA stroke of embolic origin.  The patient
was administered tissue plasminogen activator in the
Emergency Room without benefit.  The patient's residual
defects were a left facial droop, left hemiparesis and left
hemisensory deficits.  The patient's mental status seemed to
fluctuate at intervals during the course of the
hospitalization with intermittent periods of somnolence.
However, the patient was generally awake and easily oriented.
 There were no new focal neurological findings during this
admission and there was no reimaging of the head after
transfer to the floor on [**2185-12-23**].  The blood pressure goal on
transfer to the floor was 130s to 140s to maintain adequate
cerebral perfusion.  The patient remained intermittently
hypotensive and had to be bolused with fluids in order to
maintain a blood pressure in the low 100s.  Despite periods
of hypotension the patient's mental status remained largely
unchanged.  For the latter portion of the patient's admission
blood pressure remained stable in the 110s to 120s.  The
patient will follow up with the stroke service in several
weeks following discharge.

2.  Cardiovascular:  Patient with a history of coronary
artery disease.  She was continued on aspirin during this
admission.  Captopril was added shortly after the [**Hospital 228**]
transfer to the floor for treatment of congestive heart
failure.  The patient was known to be prone to flash
pulmonary edema as she had experienced in the Emergency
Department.  After her transfer to the floor she developed
increased respiratory distress over several days.  Pulmonary
examination and x-ray were consistent with moderate
congestive heart failure.  The patient was initially gently
diuresed with Lasix.  Following diuresis the patient became
transiently hypotensive to the 70s and 80s with mildly
depressed level of alertness and responsiveness.  At that
time the patient was bolused with 250 cc boluses of normal
saline to elevate the blood pressure to the low 100s.
Despite these boluses, the patient did not drop her O2
saturation.

As the patient's po intake improved over the course of the
admission.  She was ultimately taken off of maintenance
hydration and required no further fluid boluses to maintain a
blood pressure in the 110s to 120s.  She also maintained good
urine output and was considered to be essentially euvolemic
with a creatinine at or near baseline of 1.6 at the time of
discharge.  On [**2185-12-27**] during one period of relative
hypotension the patient was noted to be in atrial
fibrillation/flutter.  On further review of the patient's
vital signs and telemetry it was clear that the patient may
