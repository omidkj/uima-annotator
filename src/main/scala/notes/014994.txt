Imaging:
Head CT [**11-26**]:
There is a large mixed density but predominantly hyperdense
left-sided subdural hematoma extending approximately 23 mm from
the inner table with
moderate mass effect on the adjacent brain parenchyma resulting
in
approximately 10 mm of rightward subfalcine herniation but
without significant uncal herniation or transtentorial
herniation. Small amount of blood is likely also layering along
the left tentorium and adjacent to the falx. There is an
underlying chronic small vessel ischemic disease with
periventricular white matter hypoattenuating changes extending
into the corona radiata bilaterally. No intraparenchymal
hemorrhage or intraventricular hemorrhage is identified. No
hydrocephalus is noted, although there is expected mass effect
on the left-sided frontal,temporal, and occipital horns. The
globes are intact with no significant soft tissue edema noted.
No underlying bony fractures are present. Mild mucosal
thickening is noted within the ethmoid air cells bilaterally,
and there is bilateral circumferential mucosal thickening within
the maxillary sinuses. Remaining paranasal sinuses and mastoid
air cells are well aerated. A large amount of cerumen is present
within the external auditory canals bilaterally. Small polyp is
also present within the sphenoid sinus.

CXR [**11-27**]:
FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Exam positioning is somewhat limited
due to
lordotic technique. Given these limitations, the exam still
appears normal
without evidence of pneumothorax, pneumonia, edema, or pleural
effusions.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are within
normal limits.

No displaced rib fractures are identified with chronic grade 3
right AC
seperation with heterotopic bone formation noted.

CT OF THE CERVICAL SPINE [**11-26**]:
The degree of lumbar lordosis is somewhat accentuated but there
is no evidence of acute fracture or malalignment. No
prevertebral soft tissue swelling is identified. Multilevel
degenerative changes consisting with anterior and posterior
osteophytes as well as disc space narrowing and irregularity is
present most marked at the C4-C5 and C5-C6 interspaces. Anterior
well corticated osseous fragments are also likely degenerative
in nature. Visualized soft tissues are unremarkable. Visualized
contents of the intrathecal sac is somewhat limited on CT
examination and displays expected mass effect of the adjacent
thecal sac related to disc osteophyte complexes most pronounced
at the C5-C6 interspace where the entire ventral thecal sac
appears effaced. Visualized lung apices are clear with mild
centrilobular emphysematous changes noted.

CT Brain [**11-28**]:  Mild interval increase hyperdense material
along the left frontal extra-axial space consistent with likely
increased subdural bleeding; small epidural bleeding.

CT Brain [**11-30**]: Mild interval improvement in the amount of
pneumocephalus with persistent bilateral low-density extradural
collections. Soft tissue post-surgical changes at the craniotomy
site are unchanged. No evidence of new intracranial hemorrhage.

MRI [**2141-1-16**]:
FINDINGS: This single sequence is compared with the multiplanar
post-contrast MR examination obtained the preceding day, which
was extremely motion-limited, as well as the more diagnostic
study of [**2141-1-6**]. There is persistent thick dural enhancement
overlying the left cerebral convexity and along the anterior
aspect of the falx, as on that study, likely related to previous
left frontoparietotemporal craniotomy. The enhancing lesions in
the right parietal corona radiata and at the superficial left
frontal [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction, demonstrated on the
T1-weighted spin echo sequence on [**1-6**] are not seen as such on
the present examination; however, at these sites, there are now
faint rim-enhancing lesions with low, relatively hypointense
centers, with an overall appearance consistent with active
demyelinative plaques. This is in the context of innumerable
T1-hypointense ovoid and round lesions, oriented roughly
perpendicularly to the long-axis of the lateral ventricles.
Allowing for the limited nature of this study, no new enhancing
lesion is identified.

IMPRESSION: Limited pre-operative study, with:
1. The more uniformly enhancing superficial left frontal and
right corona
radiata lesions now appear as rim-enhancing, predominantly
T1-hypointense
abnormalities. In the context of the numerous round and ovoid
low-signal
foci,in a pattern most suggestive of underlying demyelinative
disease
(consistent with the apparently known diagnosis of multiple
sclerosis), these two lesions likely represent foci of more
active demyelination.
2. Relatively uniform frontoparietal dural thickening and
enhancement
overlying the left cerebral convexity, likely related to
previous craniotomy.

CT scan [**2141-1-16**]:
FINDINGS: There is a right parietal craniotomy defect with right
frontal
pneumocephalus and air in the right lateral ventricle frontal
[**Doctor Last Name 534**] is within the spectrum of post-surgical change. There is no
evidence of acute intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage with minimal
left extra-axial fluid collection/meningeal thickening
representing the residua of prior subdural hemorrhage that is
unchanged since five hours prior. The ventricles and sulci are
normal in caliber and configuration. Extensive bihemispheric
white m
