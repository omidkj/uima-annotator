Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2154-12-23**] - CABGx5 (Left internal mammary artery to left anterior
descending artery, vein->diagonal artery, vein->obtuse marginal
artery, vein->posterior descending artery sequential to
posterior left ventricular artery.) PFO closure
[**2154-12-18**] - Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
This is a 57 yo M w/extensive h/o CAD s/p multiple PCI last cath
[**7-24**] with 60-70% ostial LAD, mod diffuse left circ, 60% prox RCA
medically managed recently admitted for A.fib, PNA requiring
intubation who presents with chest pain x 1 1/2h. Pt reports
that [**2-18**] x over the past couple of wks he has awoken from sleep
w/anginal pain which he describes as starting w/upper jaw and
teeth tingling sometimes radiating to throat and shoulders/arms
BL. He reports that when it is very severe it also radiates to
substernal chest. He notes that prior to last night, the angina
lasted several minutes resolving w/2-nitro radiating only to his
throat, not to shoulders/arms/chest. He reports that last night
~11pm he awoke w/the anginal pain. He took 4nitro at home
w/improvement but no resolution of pain. It was associated
w/nausea which was especially concerning to pt b/c he usually
does not have associated sx. He called the ambulance and was
brought to OSH where his pain was [**9-26**]. At the OSH, vitals upon
presentation to OSH ED were BP 154/77 HR 55 sat98%RA. Troponin I
at OSH was 0.14(nl 0-0.3), EKG was unchanged from baseline dated
[**2151-4-25**]. He received 1 sl ntiro and Heparin IV per weight based
protocol was started; pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
w/u. He notes that the CP resolved en route here after he
received morphine IV. He has been CP free since. He notes that
at baseline he is able to climb a flight of stairs w/o CP or
SOB. If he climbs 2 flights(which he has at home) he does get
some SOB, but does not have anginal pain. SOB resolves w/rest.
He has only had his anginal pain while asleep. He reports that
he has otherwise felt well since discharge from his prior
admission. He does note fatigue but no f/c, no LE edema,
+intermittent palps which are his baseline, no orthopnea/PND.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], pt's vitals were stable. EKG showed 0.5mm ST
depressions V2-V6, troponins came back at his baseline. He
received ASA and Heparin IV was continued. Cardiology was
notified. Pt has been chest pain free since arrival.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
Cardiac review of systems is as in HPI syncope or presyncope.

EKG demonstrated NSR at 59 with subtle STE in III, avF, also
possibly in V1-V4 compared with prior dated [**2154-10-17**].

Cath [**2149-12-18**]:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed
three vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had mild diffuse
disease. The LAD had diffuse 50-60% disease in stent and within
gap  between stents. D1 had an 80% stenosis at its origin before
the stent (unchanged from prior cath). The LCx was a small
vessel with mild diffuse disease. The RCA had a severe proximal
and mid in-stent restenosis with focal 70% proximal and diffuse
80% mid with possible filling defects. There was a 70% distal
RCA de [**Last Name (un) 11083**] stenosis and 90% mid PDA.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mild systemic systolic
hypertension with SBP of 163 mmHg and DBP of 88 mmHg.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Systemic systolic arterial hypertension.
3. CABG recommended, ideally with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Ramus/High
D1, SVG
to distal RCA and distal PDA.

[**2154-12-23**] ECHO
PRE-BYPASS:
1. A patent foramen ovale is present. A left-to-right shunt
across the interatrial septum is seen at rest.
2. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25-30 %). There is noted
hypokinesis of the inferior, inferior-lateral, anterior and
anterior-septal walls for the mid to apical segments;
thereafter, the walls appear akinetic.
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. There is mild
global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
4. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending t
