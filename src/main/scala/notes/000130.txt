EKG:
irregular. rate 130 bpm. nl axis. narrow qrs. LVH. ST depression
in II, aVF, V4-6

CXR ([**2176-4-22**]):
There has been interval placement of endotracheal tube, which
lies 4 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen extending
below the diaphragm and out of view. Patient is slightly rotated
on current radiograph, limiting evaluation. Marked global
cardiomegaly is probably unchanged. Mediastinal widening is
difficult to assess given the degree of rotation. No focal
consolidations are seen, and there is no pleural effusion or
pneumothorax.

ABD US ([**2176-4-22**]):
Cholelithiasis without son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of cholecystitis.

ECHO ([**2176-4-23**]):The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] The
aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal. No mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2176-3-8**],
global
biventricular systolic function is similar. The severity of
tricuspid regurgitation and the estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure are now lower (may be related to technical
quality rather than a true decline).

XRAY SHOULDER and HIP and WRIST ([**2176-4-23**]):
Mild left acromioclavicular joint arthrosis. No fracture. No hip
fracture.
Wrist - Diffuse demineralization.
Mild degenerative change about the articular surfaces of the
scapholunate interval. The intercarpal spaces are normal on this
non-stress view.

CT HEAD ([**2176-4-23**]):
No intracranial hemorrhage. Mild chronic microvascular ischemic

changes.

CT CHEST ([**2176-4-23**]):
1. New large left pleural effusion, predominantly loculated.
2. Bronchomalacia bronchus intermedius. Possible air
extravasation.
3. Marked cardiomegaly, especially right atrial enlargement due
to tricuspid insufficiency. Pulmonary hypertension.
4. Bibasilar atelectasis. Right lower lobe pneumonia cannot be
excluded.
5. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, slightly increased, most likely
reactive, but other causes such as neoplasm can not be excluded.


CT CHEST/ABD/PELVIS ([**2176-4-28**]):
1. Decrease in left pleural effusion, status post left pleural
catheter. Loculated effusion persists in the anterior pleural
space with new focal areas of air within the effusion that could
be secondary to recent intervention.
2. Increasing atelectasis with consolidation of the right lower
lung with opacification of the right lower lobe bronchus with
endobronchial secretions.
3. Persistent cardio megaly and small pericardial effusion.
4. Right renal cysts


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Hemoptysis/anemia:
In setting of supratherapeutic INR (22) and pulmonary
hypertension. Bleeding stopped once INR reversed. Bronchoscopy
initially showed large clot across the carina but no active
bleeding. Repeat bronchoscopy showed slight ooze from LLL. Again
no active bleeding but a large clot. IP subsequently came and
removed the clot.  After INR reversal and clot removal, patient
no longer had hemoptysis and hematocrit remained stable.

2. Respiratory failure (pneumonia and pleural effusions):
Patient intubated in ED for hemoptysis. Extubated the following
morning but had increasing respiratory difficulty through out
the day and was re-intubated in early evening. In addition to
hemoptysis and heart failure, patient developed aspiration
pneumonia. Sputum showed GPC on gram stain but cultures negative
(taken while on levofloxacin). Vancomycin was added. CT scan of
the chest showed left loculated pleural effusion that was tapped
on [**4-25**] by IR showed 4+ PMNs but no organism.  IP further
drained the L posterior loculated fluid (~900cc) and a pigtail
catheter was placed on [**2176-4-26**].  The pigtail catheter can be
removed when drainage stops.  Pt developed fever on [**4-27**] despite
being on vanc/levofloxacin and aztreonam was added after
panculture was obtained.  Repeat CT chest subsequently showed
improved L posterior pleural effusion, unchanged L loculated
pleural effusion (too small to tap) and increased opacities in
the RLL.  Because all her sputum, pleural fluid cultures were
negative, vancomycin and aztreonam were discontinued on [**4-29**] and
[**4-30**], respectively.  A 10 day course of Levaquin was completed.
Patient was extubated successfully on [**4-29**], and at the time of
transfer was satting well on room air.

3. Coagulopathy:
On coumadin for a fib. Her coumadin dose was increased a week
prior to admission.  Unclear why INR so dramatically elevated.
Reversed with FFP and PO vitK. and had no longer hemoptysis.

4. Congestive heart failure, diastolic:
Initially BB/diuretics were held due to hypotension.  They were
reintroduced once hemodynamically stable.

5. Atrial fibrillation:
Initially held BB given hypotension.  Metoprolol was readded to
control her rate (and titrated up).  Her elevated INR was
reversed as above.  Given her recurrent falls per family and
hemoptysis, patient was not felt to be a
