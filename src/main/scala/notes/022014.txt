HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 58-year-old gentleman
with history of colon cancer status post resection, history
of personality disorder, who presented with syncope [**Location (un) 8150**].  Emergency medical services were called.
Patient awoke and was brought to the Emergency Room, where he
was found to be tachycardiac with a new right bundle branch
block.  CT angiogram showed pulmonary emboli with large clot
burden.  An echo by report showed new RV dysfunction.
Patient was hemodynamically stable and transferred to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management.  Heparin
drip was started in the Emergency Room.

Patient was admitted 10 days prior to admission for atypical
chest pain.  He ruled out for a myocardial infarction by
enzymes but refused to stay in house for stress test and was
discharged home.  Patient then went to primary care physician
on day prior to admission with complaints of persistent right
lower extremity pain but no shortness of breath, no chest
pain.  Except for a history of colon cancer, no risk factors
for hypercoagulable state.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Depression with paranoid personality disorder versus
paranoia and borderline personality disorder.
2.  Chronic abdominal pain, unclear etiology.
3.  Irritable bowel syndrome.
4.  Hyperlipidemia.
5.  Colon cancer status post resection in [**2132**] with good
follow up with colonoscopies and CT scans.
6.  Hypertension.
7.  Chronic low back pain with left thigh numbness, disc
protrusion on C6 and C7.
8.  History of atypical chest pain and stress in [**2140**] with
Persantine MIBI was normal.  An ejection fraction of 54%.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Valium 10 mg q. a.m., 20 mg q. p.m.
2.  Lactulose p.r.n.
3.  Aspirin 81 mg q. day.
4.  Risperidone 0.25 mg b.i.d.
5.  Desipramine 100 mg q. h.s.
6.  Cholestyramine 625 mg b.i.d. with meals.
7.  Percocet, one, p.o. q. 6 hours p.r.n.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Negative for deep venous thrombosis, no
history of coronary artery disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives alone at home with one son.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Notable for a temperature of 97.2,
blood pressure 122/92, pulse ranging from 129 to 131,
respiratory rate of 18, sats 97% on 100% non-rebreather.  In
general, he is a middle-aged man who appears agitated,
refusing complete examination.  Extraocular muscles intact.
Neck:  Supple.  Jugular venous distention could not be
assessed.  Cor is tachycardiac, loud split S2.  Lungs with
anterolateral decreased breath sounds at the base
bilaterally.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, positive bowel
sounds, slightly distended.  Extremities:  With right lower
extremity painful calf to palpation.  Rectal exam is guaiac
negative.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White count 9.7 with 59% white
blood cells, 33% lymphs, hematocrit 49, platelets of 306, INR
of 1.2, PTT 21, Chem-7 within normal except creatinine of
1.4, which is within his baseline, CK of 97, no MB, troponin
T less than 0.01.

EKG was sinus tachycardiac at 120 beats per minute, new right
axis deviation, and right bundle branch block also new.

CT of the head with no acute hemorrhage, no acute injury.

CT of the chest with multiple pulmonary emboli.  Left main
pulmonary artery was occluded, non-occlusive thrombus in the
main right pulmonary artery.  Pulmonary emboli in his right
upper lobe, right middle lobe and right lower lobe.

Chest x-ray:  No congestive heart failure, no pneumonia.

Echo:  Ejection fraction of 55%, RV is dilated, severe global
right ventricular hypokinesis.

Lower extremity Dopplers with right popliteal deep venous
thrombosis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This was a 58-year-old gentleman with no
significant hypercoagulable risk factors who presented with
bilateral large clot burden pulmonary emboli initially
admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.

1.  Bilateral pulmonary emboli with lower extremity deep
venous thromboses with RV dysfunction status post syncope:
Patient was continued on his Heparin drip, made therapeutic
after a bolus in the Emergency Room.  Continued on Heparin,
and patient was considered a candidate for lysis if he became
hemodynamically unstable.  However, he refused lysis and
eventually was just continued on his Heparin drip and
transitioned to Coumadin and goal INR of 2 to 3.

Initial inpatient hypercoagulable workup including
anticardiolipin, antiphospholipid, and homocystine levels
were negative.  Rest of hypercoagulable workup can be done as
an outpatient.

Overall, patient's oxygenation improved and patient was
transferred to the floor, did fairly well, and stayed while
waiting for his INR to become therapeutic to be discharged on
his regimen.  Patient had three sets of negative CKs and
troponins and otherwise remained hemodynamically stable.

Two days follow admission patient had resolution of his right
bundle branch block and was otherwise stable and discharged
to the floor with continued INR and PTT monitoring.  His
Heparin drip was within therapeutic range, and we are waiting
for his INR to be greater than 2.2 for discharge.

Overall, pulmonary emboli status and deep venous thrombosis
status patient was stable on his regimen of Coumadin, and
patient understood risks and benefits of anticoagulation
therapy and will have rest of his hypercoagulable workup as
an outpatient.

2.  Depression/paranoid personality disorder:  During the
course of his hospitalization patient refused to take his
psychiatric medicines because of a mistrust of the system.
Patient said he would restart at home, where he trusts his
medicines, and otherwise remained stable throughout course.

3.  Chronic renal insufficiency:  Per baseline through trends
on the computer system, creatinine runs from 1.2 to 1.6, and
since this was chronic, no further workup was done at this
time.  Patient did have previous ultrasounds and CTs with
otherwise normal renal functioning on imaging in [**2140**].

4.  Hypertension:  He was normotensive and did not require
any further medications for his hypertension.  His glaucoma
was stable.

5.  Glaucoma:  Stable on his Timolol drops.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good, patient ambulating without
difficulty, not requiring oxygen.

DISPOSITION:  Discharged to home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Pulmonary embolus.
2.  Deep venous thrombosis.
3.  Depression.
4.  Personality disorder.
5.  Chronic renal insufficiency.
6.  Glaucoma.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Diazepam 10 mg p.o. q. a.m.
2.  Diazepam 20 mg p.o. q. p.m.
3.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day.
4.  Risperidone 0.25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5.  Desipramine 100 mg p.o. q. h.s.
6.  Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q. h.s.
7.  Timolol Drops, one drop ophthalmic, b.i.d.
