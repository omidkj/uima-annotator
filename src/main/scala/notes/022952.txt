CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2116-4-28**] 7:48 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: S/P cabg W/?L effusion-pls evaluate

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
72 year old woman s/p cabg x2
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
S/P cabg W/?L effusion-pls evaluate
INDICATION: 72-year-old woman status post CABG, question
effusion.

AP UPRIGHT CHEST: Compared to [**2116-4-26**]. Unchanged position of
endotracheal tube, right-sided central venous line, Swan-Ganz
catheter. Median sternotomy wires. NG tube unchanged in
position. Stable cardiomegaly. Stable appearance of mediastinal
and hilar contours. Persisting left-sided pleural effusion, not
significantly changed. Persistent prominence of the pulmonary
vasculature, likely consistent with mild CHF/fluid overload.

IMPRESSION: Persisting mild congestive heart failure with
left-sided pleural effusion, not significantly changed.
Underlying consolidation not excluded.



Brief Hospital Course:
72 F admitted to [**Hospital3 1443**] Hospital on [**4-18**] in atrial
fibrillation with RVR after c/o dyspnea and nausea, who ruled in
for NSTEMI and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] after rate control
for cardiac catheterization.
She went directly to the cath lab and cath revealed:  LMCA: 80%
distal [**Last Name (un) 2435**]., LAD/LCX: mild disease, 100% prox. RCA, with an
LVEF of 45-50%.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was consulted and the pt. had
carotid studies which showed no significant disease.  She was
found to have a UTI and was started on Levaquin.  She had a LLL
density which was an effusion on chest CT. She was cleared by
endocrine with a TSH of 0.9.
On [**4-23**] she underwent CABGx2 with LIMA->LAD, and SVG->OM.  She
was transferred to the CSRU on Amiodorone, Milrinone, Levophed,
and Propofol.  Her atrial fibrillation was rapid and was hard to
control.  She was cardioverted several times on POD#1 without
success.  She remailned intubated and on Milrinone and Neo.
Endocrine followed the pt. closely.  EP also saw the pt. for AF.
 On POD#4 the Milrinone was d/c'd, she was weaning from the
vent, and tube feeds were initiated.  She was extubated on POD#5
and was aggressively diuresed.  On POD#7 she was transferred to
the floor and continued to progress.  Initially she had L arm
and leg weakness and was evaluated by neurology.  Her weakness
improved, but then she complained of R arm weakness.  They felt
that she did not have a stroke, and she had an EMG.  She has
been anticoagulated with heparin and coumadin and on POD#12 she
was discharged to rehab in stable condition.
