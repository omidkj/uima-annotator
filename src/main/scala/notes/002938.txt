Date of Birth:   [**2059-9-23**]     Sex:  F

Service:  UROLOGY

ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:  Pheochromocytoma.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 52-year-old
white female who was initially referred for evaluation of
microscopic hematuria and right adrenal mass. The patient
underwent a cystoscopy, which was normal. Review of outside
films did not demonstrate any ureteral or renal abnormality.
However, a magnetic resonance scan was performed which
demonstrated a 3.6 x 4.4 irregularly shaped right adrenal
mass with T2 hyperintensities. On further questioning, the
patient was found to have proximal palpitations, chest pain
and headaches all precipitated by exertion several times per
day for the last half year or so. The blood pressure was
checked by her school nurse during one of these episodes, and
her blood pressure was elevated to 190/120. The patient had
also developed night sweats starting [**9-/2111**], and reported a
[**11-30**] pound weight loss between [**7-/2111**] and 12/[**2110**]. The
patient had been treated with p.o. phenoxybenzamine and
nifedipine with partial resolution of her palpitations and
headaches. A 24-hour catecholamine study revealed elevated
normetaepinephrine of 493 and elevated combined metanephrine
and normetanephrine of 633. Vanillylmandelic acid or VMA was
normal at 5.3. The patient also had normal levels of urinary
17-ketosteroids, cortisol, chromogranin-A, .....tosterone,
aldosterone, and plasma renin. The patient denied any flank
pain, fevers, chills.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Glaucoma.
2.  Hypothyroidism.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Glaucoma surgery.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Levothyroxine 50 mcg q day.
2.  Phenoxybenzamine 10 mg b.i.d.
3.  Nifedipine 30 mg q day.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a teacher at a local school.
The patient smokes about one and a half packs of cigarettes
per day for thirty years. The patient also drinks [**12-18**]
alcoholic beverages per day.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  Pulse 95, blood pressure 137/77, respiratory
rate 16.
HEAD AND NECK:  Within normal limits.
CHEST:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  Soft, nondistended, nontender, no CVA
tenderness, no palpable mass.

LABORATORY DATA:  Please see History of Present Illness.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2112-1-14**] and
underwent a laparoscopic right-sided adrenalectomy. The
patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no
immediate postoperative complications. The patient's pain was
well controlled with intravenous morphine. The patient was
continued on intravenous fluids for hydration, and the
patient's hematocrit and creatinine were stable and normal.

On postoperative day one, the patient was continued on NPO
status, and the patient's diltiazem was continued, but her
alpha adrenergic blockers were discontinued. The patient's
blood pressure remained stable.

On postoperative day two, the patient had decreased breath
sounds on the left chest, and the patient's O2 saturations
began to decline. The patient denied any shortness of breath,
but an arterial gas revealed a pH of 7.38, PCO2 of 49 and a
PO2 of 45. The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care
Unit and was intubated for better oxygenation. A chest x-ray
revealed opacification of her left chest. The patient was
started on levofloxacin and Flagyl for possible pneumonia.
The patient's poor oxygenation was felt to be due to a
combination of her underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease and possible atelectasis/pneumonia.

By postoperative day three, the patient had improved O2
saturations overnight, and her blood pressures were well
controlled on nifedipine. The patient was continued on
levofloxacin and Flagyl, and a follow-up chest x-ray also
showed only slight improvement on the left side. A
bronchoscopy performed on [**2112-1-17**] revealed some secretions
on the right lower lobe, but the left side was indeed clear.

On postoperative day four, the patient's respiratory status
slightly improved from the previous day. A chest x-ray also
showed some improvement and Pulmonary consult recommended
starting on systemic steroids, as well as inhaled steroids.

By postoperative day five, the patient's chest x-ray was
dramatically improved, and her O2 saturations remained
stable. The patient was extubated successfully. As the
patient appeared comfortable and in no respiratory distress,
it was felt that the patient would be transferred to the
floor on postoperative day five. The patient was continued on
Solu-Medrol 60 mg q eight which was eventually tapered.

On postoperative day six, the patient was weaned off her O2,
and her O2 saturations remained above 90%. Chest x-ray showed
marked clearing of the left side. The Foley was discontinued
and the patient was encouraged to ambulate t.i.d.

By postoperative day seven, the patient was in no further
respiratory distress. It was felt that the patient would be
ready for discharge home.

FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient was to follow-up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4229**] within 2-4 weeks.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Home.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

2.  ............ four puffs inhalation b.i.d.
3.  Percocet 5/325 mg tablets, 1-2 tablets p.o. q 4-6 hours
p.r.n. for pain.
4.  Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q day.
5.  Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d.
6.  Prednisone 20 mg q day.
