Chief Complaint:
Dizziness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pacemaker placement

History of Present Illness:
This is a 70 year old female with a history of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation and tachy-brady syndrome who was scheduled for
elective pacemaker placement for symptomatic bradycardia on the
week of presentation due to an outside holter monitor showing
sinus pauses up to four seconds.

This morning she presented to the ED and was noted to have sinus
pauses up to 3 seconds, intermittently in a junctional escape at
a rate of 30 maintaining adequate pressures. In the ED, initial
vitals were 123/46 with HR 40. She received only Aspirin, zofran
and 1L of NS in the ED prior to admission to the CCU. Temporary
pacing wire was not placed in the ED.
.
She stopped taking amiodarone in [**2161-3-27**] after developing
transaminitis. Her last dose of coumadin was on [**11-19**] in
anticipation of the elective procedure scheduled for this week.

.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope.

---------------
EKG ([**11-22**]): Sinus bradycardia (HR35) with atrial premature
beats and junctional beats. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2161-8-1**] the rate is slower with appearance of junctional beats.
---------------
STUDIES:
CXR ([**11-22**]): The lungs are clear without focal opacity. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar contours, and pulmonary
vasculature are not significantly changed from prior. There is
no overt pulmonary edema or evidence of CHF. There is no pleural
effusion or pneumothorax. There is slight elevation of the left
hemidiaphragm.
IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic abnormality.
.
CXR ([**2161-11-24**]): Prelim: Pacemaker position appropriate.

Brief Hospital Course:
70F with PAF, tachy/brady syndrome presents with symptomatic
bradycardia with sinus pauses of up to 4 seconds.
.
# BRADYCARDIA ?????? symptomatic with sick sinus syndrome:  Patient
with PAF on diltiazem and flecanide & previously known
tachy-brady syndrome with symptomatic sinus pauses presents with
dizziness and is found to have intermittent sinus arrest with
pauses up to 4 seconds.  She was planned for a pacemaker
placement later this week.  Initially her junctional escape was
proven to be reliable and she did not require a temporary pacing
wire.  However, she then developed very frequent pauses up to 5
seconds in duration with symptomatic bradycardia.  She was
treated with dopamine which improved her heart rate to the 50s
with symptom resolution.  She had a pacemaker placed the next
day without complication.  Of note, her TSH was elevated at 6.1,
but her free T4 was normal.  She should have a repeat TSH in a
4-6 weeks.
.
# DIZZINESS / VERTIGO / LIGHTHEADEDNESS: [**12-29**] bradycardia, now
resolved.
.
# FEN:  Patient received cardiac healthy diet.  She tolerated
POs well.
.
