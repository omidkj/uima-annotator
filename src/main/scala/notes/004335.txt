History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 62 year old gentleman well known to the
transplant surgery service. In brief, he is s/p renal transplant
in [**2137**] for post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. This failed
after several years and he underwent transplant nephrectomy in
[**2143**]. He was recently admitted in [**3-/2160**] for
increased drainage and irritation from his G tube(originally
placed in [**2156**] as
part of a re-do ex. lap for mesenteric ischemia following
subtotal colectomy
for pneumatosis intestinalis). During his latest admission, his
G tube was
removed and his overlying cellulitis was treated with IV
antibiotics and
thought to be secondary to gastrocutaneous fistula. He has since
had increased
output from his former G tube site, and is here today for
preoperative
anticoagulation management prior to his gastrostomy takedown.

Brief Hospital Course:
62 y/o male with complicated PMH who is admitted for
preoperative anticoagulation management prior to his gastrostomy
takedown. The patient is on warfarin for an existing St Jude
valve. Patient was taken to the OR with Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for
takedown of the gastrocutaneous fistula. Per the operative
report the fistula tract was taken down completely to the
stomach. The surgery was without complication and he was
transferred to the PACU in stable condition.

He had an NG tube in place and was kept strictly NPO through
post op Day 3.
On POD 2 the patient had fever to 101.1, and on subsequent days
he has run a low grade fever. Blood cultures have been sent on
[**4-12**], [**6-16**] and [**6-18**] in response to low grade fevers. They are
no growth to date but have not yet been finalized.
Hemodialysis was continued per routine schedule.
On POD 2, the patient had an episode of hypotension into the
80's and desaturation. He was also having a lot of pain at the
incision site, and as such was transferred to the SICU, where he
was able to receive hemodialysis, and increased monitoring.
Blood pressures improved and with fluid removal, the patient had
improved respiratory status.

He was transfered back out of the ICU the following day, and has
maintained adequate blood pressures thereafter.
Heparin drip was restarted following surgery, and when
appropriate, coumadin was restarted with the heparin bridge. He
was therapeutic on POD 7 and the heparin drip was discontinued.

On POD 5, the incision was opened due to drainage, and on POD 6
the incision was further opened and a wound VAC was placed for
assistance with wound healing.
Ostomy output has remained stable from 300 -700 cc daily. He was
evaluated by the wound consult service who noted some maceration
at the stoma, changed the dressing to better fit stoma.  He was
see by physical therapy who determined he would need rehab
services. His pain was well controlled on PO pain medication.

On POD 7, his INR was 5.9 and he received 1 unit of FFP and
coumadin was held. His wound vac changed. At this time a 1 cm
fascial dehiscence was noted over medial aspect of incision. It
appeared amenable to wound vac, so a vac was replaced.
On POD8, [**2160-6-21**], he was discharged to rehab. He was afebrile
with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet, and pain was
controlled. He was discharged to [**Hospital **] Healthcare center and
will resume his regular [**Hospital 2286**] schedule.
