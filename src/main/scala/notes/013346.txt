History of Present Illness:
76 yo female with h/o CAD s/p MI, ischemic CM (EF=21%), OA, CRI,
and HTN who initially presented to [**Hospital1 18**] [**7-11**] for a L shoulder
arthroplasty.  Post-op [**7-11**], the patient developed hypotension
with SBP in the 80s and was anuric.  She was given IVF
(approximately 4 liters total) and transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 12837**] for further management.  In the PACU, she was transiently
started on Neo, which was stopped on [**2142-7-12**] at 4AM. She was
then stable without complaints.  During this interval, the
patient also developed A fib with RVR, which was felt to be new.
 At that point, the patient was evaluated by the med-consult
team, and the decision was made to transfer the patient to
medicine.
.
After transfer to medicine, EP evaluated the patient and
recommended starting amiodarone and digoxin, with plans for
cardioversion in the future after INR [**1-18**] for 4 weeks.  The
patient was started on amio, digoxin, as well as heparin gtt.
.
The following morning ([**7-13**]), the patient became hypotensive at
around 11am with BP 80/40 and was anuric.  Hct had fallen from
28.5 to 22.8 overnight.  She received at total of 1.5 liters NS,
as well as 2 units PRBCs.  Subsequently, her BP stablized at
106/70, with increased urine output.  She was sating in the high
90's throughout this event.  The MICU team was called for
evaluation at this point.  Approximately 45 minutes later, the
patient dropped her BP to 82/58.  She received an additional 1L
NS which brought her SBP back up to the 100's.  The patient was
in T-[**Doctor Last Name **] and began to cough, with gurgling breath sounds.
Patient still satting well at 95-100% on 2L NC.  ABG was
7.31/40/72, lactate 1.0, Hct 26.  The patient c/o mild SOB and
left shoulder pain.  The primary medicine team commented that
her left shoulder appeared more edematous than it had the
evening before.  She denied SOB, palpitations, nausea, vomiting,
BRBPR, dysuria.

[**2142-7-11**]: OPERATIVE REPORT
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Left shoulder severe osteoarthritis.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Left shoulder severe
osteoarthritis.
PROCEDURE:  Left total shoulder arthroplasty.
ANESTHESIA:  General combined with interscalene block.
COMPLICATIONS:  None.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  150 cc.
INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:  This 76-year-old female has been
complaining of 1 year of increasing left shoulder pain
despite conservative treatment. She is status post left
shoulder arthroscopic subacromial decompression by me a year
ago. At that time, she was noted to have severe degenerative
changes, grade 4, of the glenohumeral articulation. After
failure of conservative treatment, she elected to have left
total shoulder arthroplasty.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  The patient was brought to the
operating room after left shoulder interscalene block was
introduced satisfactorily by the anesthesia service in the
preoperative area. She was placed supine on the operating
room table and underwent general endotracheal anesthesia
without complication. She received 600 mg of clindamycin IV
preoperatively. She was placed in modified beach chair
position. All bony prominences were well padded. The left
shoulder was prepped and draped in the standard sterile
fashion. An anterior deltopectoral approach was utilized
after infiltrating the skin with 10 cc of 2%  Xylocaine with
epinephrine. The incision was carried sharply through the
skin and subcutaneous tissues just lateral to the coracoid
process.

The deltopectoral interval was developed. A deep retractor
was placed. The clavipectoral fascia incised just lateral to
the conjoined tendon. The [**Last Name (un) **] retractor was placed beneath
the conjoined tendon medially  and the deltoid laterally. The
subscapularis bursa was excised. The anterior humeral
circumflex vessels were coagulated. A portion of the humeral
insertion of the pectoralis muscle was released to gain
better exposure. Arthrotomy was then performed of the
glenohumeral articulation by dissecting through the
subscapularis and capsule insertion approximately 1 cm medial
to the insertion of the lesser tuberosity using
electrocautery. The arm was placed in approximately 40
degrees of retroversion. Severe degenerative changes of the
glenohumeral articulation. The sagittal saw was then used to
remove the humeral head using the Osteonics guide as a
template. Osteophytes were removed with a rongeur.

The arm was then extended, and using the Osteonics straight
reamers, the intramedullary canal reamed up to a size 13 mm.
The arm was then placed back on the padded arm table, and
attention directed to the glenoid. The [**Last Name (un) 104772**] humeral head
retractor was placed beneath the posterior aspect of the
glenoid. The labrum was removed. The biceps tendo
