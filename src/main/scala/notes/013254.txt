HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 61-year-old gentleman
who initially presented in [**2152-11-23**] with back, and
abdominal pain, and fevers.

He was discharged subsequent to that and was treated on an
outpatient basis with ciprofloxacin for question prostatitis.
He continued to have pain and eventually had a computed
tomography scan of the abdomen which showed a 7-cm left
pericolic abscess and thickening of the splenic flexure.

He was admitted to the hospital upon discovering this in
[**2152-12-24**] and placed on broad spectrum antibiotics
with ampicillin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl.  He underwent
computed tomography-guided drainage of the abscess collection
that grew out enterococcus in two strains; of which one was
vancomycin resistant.

One month following (on [**2153-2-1**]), he again noticed
abdominal pain with chills and cramping with emesis.  He had
a follow-up computed tomography which demonstrated another
abscess adjacent to the previously drained collection was
noted on repeat computed tomography done at this time.  He
was admitted to the hospital and placed on broad spectrum
antibiotics consisting of levofloxacin and Flagyl and
scheduled for percutaneous drainage of the second collection.
Of note, the patient had grown vancomycin-resistant
enterococcus from the prior collection that was drained in
[**Month (only) 404**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Diabetes mellitus.
2.  Status post angioplasty times two.
3.  Coronary artery disease.
4.  Hypercholesterolemia.
5.  Hypertension.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  None.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Glucophage 1000 mg twice per day.
2.  Glipizide 10 mg twice per day.
3.  Actos 40 mg by mouth once per day.
4.  Lipitor 40 mg by mouth once per day.
5.  Spironolactone 50 mg by mouth once per day.
6.  Diltiazem 180 mg by mouth once per day.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Initial physical
examination revealed the patient had a temperature of 99.1,
his heart rate was 108, his blood pressure was 176/79, and
his respiratory rate was 18.  He was alert and oriented times
three and in no apparent distress, comfortable.  The lungs
were clear to auscultation bilaterally.   The abdomen was
obese, soft, nontender, and nondistended.  His extremities
were warm.  He had a drain in place in his left upper
quadrant with dark serous fluid.  Rectal examination had
normal tone.  No stool in the vault, normal prostate, and
guaiac-negative.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION: Initial
laboratories significant for a white blood cell count of
16.1.  The rest of his laboratories were within normal
limits.  He was also pan-cultured at the time.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A computed tomography of the
abdomen showed an increase in the left upper quadrant fluid
collection with a significant amount of air and fluid;
consistent with an abscess with the percutaneous catheter
inferior and posterior, and no communication with between the
abscess collection and the percutaneous drain.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Based on the patient's
clinical presentation, he was admitted to the hospital and
started on intravenous levofloxacin and Flagyl.  He was made
nothing by mouth and placed on intravenous hydration and
pan-cultured.

He was taken the following day for a computed
tomography-guided drainage of the left upper quadrant
collection.  He continued to spike fevers, and the decision
was made to take him to the operating room for definitive
resection and drainage of the abscess.  He was taken to the
operating room on [**2153-2-6**] where he underwent a en bloc
excision of the abdominal tumor with a transverse colectomy,
partial gastrectomy, splenectomy, and distal pancreatectomy.
Intraoperatively, they found a large intra-abdominal tumor
involving the above-mentioned strictures in transverse colon
and splenic flexure as well as the transverse mesocolon.  An
intraoperative gastroscopy was done which showed
no mucosal lesion, but the lesion was found to be
clearly adherent to the stomach.  The liver was free of
disease.

The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred
to the Recovery Room intubated and sedated.  The remainder of
the hospital course will be outlined by system.

1.  NEUROLOGIC ISSUES:  He had an epidural catheter placed
intraoperatively, and this was run with good pain control.
He was also maintained on low-dose propofol for additional
sedation.

However, on postoperative day two, he spiked a fever to
101.2, and his epidural catheter was removed by the Acute
Pain Service.  He was changed to intermittent boluses of
Dilaudid for pain which he tolerated well.  His propofol was
discontinued, and he was maintained on Dilaudid only.  After
extubation, he had minimal pain receiving only intermittent
doses of Dilaudid; however, he did have some episodes of
confusion and persistent pulling out of his nasogastric tube.

He cleared somewhat and was transferred to the floor.
However, on postoperative day 12, he had an episode of acute
confusion and was given Narcan, and all of his narcotics were
discontinued.  At this time, he was felt to have a PCO2 of 80
which decreased to 66 after treatment.

He was transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit at this
time for further monitoring and continued to sundown, but he
was easily reoriented.  The following day, he was found out
of bed on the floor trying to go to bathroom.  He had a
completely nonfocal examination.  At the time of discharge,
he had cleared and was oriented times three with all sedative
medications discontinued.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  The patient reported a history of
bronchospasm with beta blockers, and thus was maintained on a
diltiazem drip for heart rate control.  After his tube feeds
were being tolerated, he was changed to intermittent oral
diltiazem with good heart rate control in the 70s and 80s.
He remained hemodynamically stable throughout his
hospitalization.

3.  RESPIRATORY ISSUES:  Postoperatively, her remained
intubated.  Just out of the operating room had an increasing
oxygen requirement because of decreased oxygen saturations
and an increased positive end-expiratory pressure
requirement.

A chest x-ray was consistent with mild congestive heart
failure.  He was stabilized, and his ventilator was slowly
weaned on pressure support.  However, he initially did not
tolerate a pressure support wean after adequate diuresis;
however, he was able to tolerate very minimal settings.

He subsequently developed a left lower lobe opacity, and a
sputum culture grew out multiresistant Klebsiella, for which
he was changed to meropenem.  He was eventually able to be
extubated on postoperative day nine.  However, he continued
to have a significant oxygen requirement and continued to
have low-grade temperatures.  He received aggressive
pulmonary toilet with chest physical therapy and was weaned
down to room air at the time of discharge.  He did have one
episode of hypoxia, as previously mentioned, when he was on
the floor associated with his acute confusion with a
saturation of 73% on room air.  He was placed on a
nonrebreather with improved oxygenation.  After transfer to
the Intensive Care Unit, he was able to be weaned off his
oxygen.   However, on chest x-ray he continued to have a left
lower lobe opacity/consolidation consistent with a ventilator
associated pneumonia.

3.  GASTROINTESTINAL ISSUES:  He underwent the
above-mentioned procedure including a splenectomy, partial
gastrectomy, distal pancreatectomy, and transverse colectomy.
At the time of this dictation, the final pathology results
were still pending.

He was started on tube feeds on postoperative day four.
These were advanced to goal, and he tolerated them well
without difficulty throughout his hospitalization.  His
nasogastric tube was self-discontinued on [**2-15**] and was
replaced without incident, and his tube feeds were resumed.
He again self-discontinued his nasogastric tube, and it was
changed over to a Dobbhoff tube.  However, this was post
extubation.  After he stab
