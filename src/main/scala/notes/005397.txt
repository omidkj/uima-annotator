Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pressure, atrial fibrillation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Dr. [**Known firstname 26693**] [**Known lastname **] is an 87yo retired male cardiothoracic
surgeon with h/o CAD with inoperable multivessel dz, 2 prior
anterolateral and inferior MI s/p BMS to pLAD in [**11/2195**], DES to
D1 in [**2-/2200**] c/b GIB in setting of anticoag, ICM with EF
30-40%, HTN, hyperlipidemia, colon and prostate CA, who awoke at
home at 4am with chest discomfort, diaphoresis and atrial
fibrillation to rate of 130s. He reported chest discomfort as a
pressure that was "moderate" in severity. He took nitro spray at
home without improvement and called EMS. He had received ASA
325mg po x11, morphine 5mg Iv, NTG x3 SL enroute with EMS.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were  HR 130 BP 152/112 RR 21 POX 95%
on RA.   A code STEMI was called when EKG revealed in III/aVF.
He received 600mg Plavix, integrellin bolus and was taken to the
cath lab. Prior to catheterization, his ST elevations were felt
to be rate related and he received metoprolol 5mg IV x3 and was
transferred to the CCU for esmolol gtt in the setting of EF 35%.
.
On review of systems, he has suprapubic fullness from bladder
distention and difficulty voiding lying flat. He denies any
prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary
embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint
pains, cough, hemoptysis, recent black stools or red stools. He
denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional
buttock or calf pain but does report decrease energy tolerance
and use of a walker. All of the other review of systems were
negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

CXR [**12-13**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, the
pre-existing right
pleural effusion has slightly increased. Also increased are the
pre-existing left basal areas of hypoventilation. Due to a
lesser inspiratory effort, the cardiac silhouette is slightly
larger than on the previous examination. There is no evidence of
focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia. The size of the
intrapulmonary vessels is borderline, overt overhydration is not
present, minimal pleural effusion.
ECG [**12-14**]:
Sinus rhythm. Since the previous tracing of [**2204-12-14**] inferior
and anterior
T wave inversions may be more prominent. Clinical correlation is
suggested.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Atrial fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response - Patient
was initially started on esmolol gtt with limited success at
rate control.  After discussion with the Electrophysiology
service, the patient was started on dofetilide with oral
beta-blockade to control rate.  Patient cardioverted on
dofetilide.  The need for anticoagulation (CHADS2=3) was
discussed with this patient, but he insisted that he did not
wish to be on AC given his h/o GI bleeds.  He expressed
understanding re: stroke risk of not being on anticoagulation.
On [**12-16**], QTc was found to be prolonged at 0.51 on Dofetalide,
changed to Dronedarone at 400 [**Hospital1 **] with good rhythm control, in
NSR on discharge. Metoprolol was uptitrated to HR of 50's,
converted to Succinate on discharge. Pt has an appt with his
[**Last Name (LF) 26702**], [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for further medication adjustment.
.
# Coronary Artery Disease - Last cath [**2-10**] showed severe 3VD.
Cath films were reviewed again during this admission and it was
felt that he did not have intervenable targets.  Patient had
troponin-T elevation, peaking to 4.63, during hospital admission
that was thought [**3-5**] demand ischemia in the setting of RVR. He
was continued on aspirin, Metoprolol and statin, Imdur was
restarted before discharge.
.
# Chronic Systolic COngestive Heart Failure - Appeared euvolemic
on admission.  EF 35%, NYHA Class II. Cont on home dose of Lasix
and Valsartan. Metoprolol increased as noted above.
.
# H/o GI Bleed on anticoagulants: Guaiac negative in cath lab
after plavix/integrilin gtt. No evidence of bleeding during this
admission. Pt has refused IV heparin or coumadin because of
bleeding history. Aspirin was increased to 325mg.
.
# CKD: Baseline of 1.7, at baseline on admission and at
discharge.
.
# CODE: DNR/DNI confirmed w/ pt and son at bedside.

Medications on Admission:
Aspirin 81mg po daily
