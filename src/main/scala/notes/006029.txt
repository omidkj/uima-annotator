Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Ampicillin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
worsening shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2149-11-25**]: TAVR with [**Doctor Last Name **] [**Last Name (un) 30978**] valve

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 51yo caucasian male with severe aortic stenosis in
the setting of post mantle radiation for childhood lymphoma (age
4) resulting in chest cavity deformity, cervical kyphosis and
stiff fixed neck. History includes CAD with 80-90% proximal RCA
nondominant treated medically,  multivalvular disease secondary
to radiation, complete heart block s/p PPM, PE s/p PPM, HTN, CKD
stage I. He was experiencing severe NHYA class III/IV symptoms
earlier this year, underwent BAV [**2149-10-14**] with short term
improvement. He now notes return of shortness of breath, able to
ambulated one block slowly before stopping due to SOB, able to
climb 2 stairs only, admits to dizziness when getting up quickly
or bending down. He was deemed not a surgical candidate for
surgical AVR at [**Hospital1 112**] in [**2147**]. He was also seen by cardiac surgery
at [**Hospital1 18**] and was again deemed not a surgical candidate for AVR
secondary to hostile mediastinum and anatomical deformities. He
was screened for TAVR and met criteria. He returns for elective
TAVR.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains,
cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. he denies recent
fevers, chills or rigors. he denies exertional buttock or calf
pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
palpitations. he admits to worsening shortness of breath.


Past Medical History:
1.  Multivalvular disease secondary to mantle cell radiation as
a
child.  Most prominent is his aortic stenosis with peak velocity
of 4.8 m/sec, peak gradient 91, mean 50, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 109**] is 0.9 cm2.
   - s/p BAV [**2149-10-14**] (22mm)
2.  Severe mitral annular calcification with mild functional MS
(mean gradient 3 mmHg).
3.  Mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation may be underestimated
due to his MAC.
4.  At least moderate tricuspid regurgitation again potentially
underestimated due to shadowing.
5.  Mild depression of LV function to 45-50%.
6.  Complete heart block, status post [**Company 1543**] dual chamber
pacemaker (05/[**2149**]).
7.  Pulmonary embolism - CTA done for CoreValve workup
identified
right acute right lower lobe PE with associated thrombosis of
right basilic and cephalic veins, presumed secondary to
pacemaker
implantation.  Completed three months of Lovenox.
8.  Hypertension.
9.  CKD stage I.
10.  Coronary artery disease with 70-80% stenosis of a
nondominant right coronary artery, otherwise, clean.
11. Hypothyroidism - s/p thyroidectomy
12. Hodgkin's lymphoma (at age 4) s/p Cobalt Radiation

Imaging:
[**2149-11-24**] CXR:
As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged
position
of the right pectoral pacemaker and there is unchanged moderate
cardiomegaly with signs of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.  No
pleural effusions.  No other acute lung changes.  No
pneumothorax.  No pneumonia.

[**11-25**] CXR: Greater opacification in the right lower lung is
probably a combination of dependent edema and pleural effusion
layering posteriorly.  In the interim, the patient has had an
aortic endoprosthesis placed.  There is no pneumothorax.
Chronic moderate cardiomegaly is slightly larger today than on
[**11-24**], but it has been larger in the past.  Pleural
effusions are presumed, but not appreciable.  Transvenous right
atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are unchanged in their
respective positions.

[**2149-11-25**] ECHO:
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50%). The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied secondary
to marked ventricular interaction. The right ventricular cavity
is dilated with depressed free wall contractility. There is
abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. An aortic valve prosthesis
([**Last Name (un) 30978**]) is present. A mild paravalvular aortic valve leak is
probably present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

[**2149-11-26**] ECHO: Well seated [**Doctor Last Name **] [**Last Name (un) 30978**] AV bioprosthesis with
normal gradient and mild valvular and perivalvular AR. Symmetric
LVH with preserved global systolic function. Compared with the
prior study of [**2149-11-25**], mild perivalvular AR is now seen.

[**11-29**] CXR: IMPRESSION:  AP and lateral chest compared to [**11-25**]:
Previous mild pulmonary edema has improved.  There is sufficient
consolidation at the right lung base, which obscure that
hemidiaphragm on the lateral view and this could be pneumonia.
Small bilateral pleural effusions persist.  Post-operative
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is essentially stable.
Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are
unchanged in their respective positions and the CoreValve is
grossly unchanged.  No pneumothorax.

subcutaneous tissues in the left thigh overlying the cath site
with no evidence of dr
