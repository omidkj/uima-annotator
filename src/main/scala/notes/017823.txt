Chief Complaint:
Fever.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Central venous access insertion.


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 72yo F with DM2, HTN, CAD,  s/p CABG in [**2146-10-5**] with
MVR and AVR who presents with bladder pressure for 2 days and
fever and chills since this morning. Pt states that she saw her
OB/Gyn for vaginal spotting. She had a pelvic u/s down which she
states was normal & there was no evidence of bleeding seen.
Since Thursday, 3 days ago, she had bladder pressure sensation
with sensation that she was unable to void completely. She
denied any nausea, vomiting, back pain, dysuria, hematuria, or
odor to her urine. She felt cold over the weekend, and then
developed fever and chills this morning. She said she was
shaking a lot and her daughter decided to bring her to the [**Name (NI) **].
They did not take a temp prior to coming to the ED.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 101.7 P 116 BP 106/72 R 18 O2 sat
100% on RA. UA was positive. Patient was given 3L IV fluids,
tylenol 1000mg, Ceftriaxone 1g, 4g of IV Magnesium. The patient
was started on levophed gtt for persistent pressures in the
80's.  Lactate went from 3.3-->2.3 after 3L IVF. Prior to
transfer to the floors, she was on Levophed 0.04.
.
.
On the floor, she feels like her mouth is dry, but has no other
complaints. She currently denies any abdominal pain or back
pain. BP apparently runs in 110s at home. Pt has not taken am BP
meds. Pt does not recall prior UTIs and has not taken any recent
abx.
.

Images:
[**2147-6-3**] RUQ ultrasound: Liver echotexture is normal. There are
no focal hepatic lesions. The previously demonstrated right
liver lobe abnormality on CT is not visualized on this
ultrasound study. The portal vein is patent with normal
hepatopetal flow. There is no ascites. There is no intra- or
extra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation with the common bile duct
measuring 4 mm. The spleen is normal measuring 9 cm.
IMPRESSION: No US finding that would be corresponding to the
previously seen lesion on CT.

[**2147-6-2**] CT abd/pelvis: 1. Bilateral patchy enhancement of the
renal parenchyma, consistent with the stated history of
pyelonephritis, without evidence of renal or perinephric
abscess. Additional areas of scarring suggest previous infection
or ischemic change. No hydronephrosis. 2. 12 mm focal hypodense
lesion within the right lobe of the liver, not fully
characterized, could be further assessed with ultrasound when
clinically appropriate.  3. Severe atherosclerotic change of the
abdominal aorta and iliac arteries. 4. Diverticulosis without
evidence of diverticulitis.

[**2147-5-29**] CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, the
opacities indicative of pulmonary edema have minimally
decreased. No focal parenchymal opacities have newly appeared.
Presence of a minimal left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
Unchanged alignment of the sternal wires, unchanged position of
the right internal jugular vein catheter. Unchanged size of the
cardiac silhouette.

[**2147-5-29**] TTE: Poor image quality.The left atrium is elongated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably
mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %) with global hypokinesis. There is
no ventricular septal defect. with depressed free wall
contractility. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is
present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with
normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. A mitral valve annuloplasty ring
is present. The gradient across the mitral valve is increased
(mean = 10 mmHg). Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] Tricuspid regurgitation is
present but cannot be quantified. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2147-1-26**], the degree of MR is less. If
indicated, a TEE would better assess the degree of MR due to
poor TTE quality and acoustic shadowing from the mitral ring.

[**2147-5-28**] CXR: One portable view. Comparison with the previous
study of [**2147-5-28**]. There is diffusely increased parenchymal
density bilaterally with increased interstitial markings most
suggestive of edema. The patient is status post median
sternotomy and MVR as before. Mediastinal structures are
unc
