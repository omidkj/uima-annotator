Pertinent Results:
Non-contrast Head CT [**2165-8-14**]- Slight short-interval increase in
left posterior fossa subdural hematoma, layering subjacent to
the tentorium without significant mass effect. There is also
more evident left more than right frontotemporal subarachnoid
hemorrhage and associated underlying diffuse axonal (shear)
injury cannot be excluded.
.
CT torso with contrast [**2165-8-14**]- IMPRESSION: 1. Small left-sided
hemothorax and left second through seventh rib fractures. 2.
Moderate amount of stranding within the left anterolateral chest
and body walls. Small foci of hyperdensity within the superior
anterior left thoracic subcutaneous tissues represents vessel
vs. foci of extravasation. No delayed images were obtained.
.
X-ray Left Hand [**2165-8-14**]- IMPRESSION: Fractures of the navicular,
cuboid, all three cuneiforms, bases of the third, fourth, and
fifth metatarsals, suspected fracture of the second metatarsal
base as well.
.
Right Ankle X-ray [**2165-8-14**]- IMPRESSION: 1. Small avulsion fracture
off the inferior anterior aspect of the right calcaneus. 2.
Mildly displaced avulsion fracture of the left lateral
malleolus.
.
Left Anle X-ray IMPRESSION: 1. Small avulsion fracture off the
inferior anterior aspect of the right calcaneus. 2. Mildly
displaced avulsion fracture of the left lateral malleolus.
.
Chest X-ray [**2164-8-15**] IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate left pleural effusion consistent with known
hemothorax, with increased in size since admission trauma chest
radiograph of one day prior.
2. Multiple left rib fractures.
3. Marked gastric distention.
.
Chest X-ray [**2165-8-17**]- Left-sided chest tube is unchanged in
position. Left effusion appears slightly smaller but positional
differences may account for this apparent change. Worsening
perihilar opacities attributed to pulmonary edema are
demonstrated as well as persistent atelectasis in the
retrocardiac region.
.
CT Right and Left Ankles [**2165-8-18**]-  LEFT ANKLE: There is a
fracture through the anterior/lateral aspect of the left lateral
malleolus. There is no evidence of left talus fracture. There is
subcutaneous edema particularly at the medial aspect of the left
ankle, with no evidence of flexor, extensor or peroneal tendon
tear. RIGHT ANKLE: There is a fracture through the anterior
process of the calcaneus, which is comminuted and involves the
calcaneocuboid articulation. There is a small well-corticated
bony density inferior to the right lateral malleolus in keeping
with old trauma or an accessory ossicle. there is no soft tissue
edema around this ossicle.
Note is made of medial talar tilt with narrowing of the ankle
mortise medially and widening of the ankle mortise laterally.
There is soft tissue swelling overlying the medial and lateral
aspects of the right ankle.
There is no evidence of extensor, flexor or peroneal tendon tear
on the right.
.
Chest X-ray (AP) [**2165-8-20**]- No evidence of pneumothorax post-chest
tube removal.  Interval improvement in pulmonary vascular
congestion.  Atelectasis or consolidation at the left base.
Pleural thickening and/or fluid on the left.  Focal area of
increased density in the upper right lung which may represent
asymmetric edema or developing focal consolidation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 74651**] was admitted to the the trauma surgical intensive
care unit with the following injuries: small subdural hematoma,
subarachnoid hemorrhage, displaced left 2nd-7th anterior rib
fractures, left hemothorax, 7 cm laceration left popliteal fossa
- sutured, right calcaneal avulsion fracture, left lateral
malleolar avulsion fracture.  She was transferred to the general
surgical floor on hospital day 6.
.
#) Intracranial Hemorrhage- Non-contrast head CT left posterior
fossa subdural hematoma with layering subjacent to the tentorium
without significant mass effect as weel as left more than right
frontotemporal subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Neurosurgery was
conulted and did not recommend any neurosurgical intervention.
Ms. [**Known lastname 74651**] should follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**] in 6weeks
with repeat head CT.  Ms. [**Known lastname 74651**] did have [**3-14**] brief (< 1
minute) episodes of vertigo beginning the day prior to
discharge.  Episodes occurred with head movement and were
associated with brief nausea but no headache. Episodes were
similar to episodes of vertigo patient experienced in the past.
A repeat head CT was performed and showed improvement in
subdural and no new areas of hemorrhage.  On exam prior to
discharge, patient did not have vertigo or nystagmus with normal
mental status, strength and cranial nerve exam.
.
#) Rib fractures-  Treated with pain management and incentive
spirometry.  Patient was saturating well prior to discharge.
.
#) Left Hemothorax- Repeat chest X-ray on hospital day 2
revealed an increase in left hemothorax. A left chest tube was
placed and was removed on [**2165-8-20**]. Repeat chest x-ray revealed
no new pneumothorax. Chest tube was discontinued on hospital day
7 and repeat chest x-ray was negative for pneumothorax.
.
#) Orthopedic Injuries- Given left fibula fracture and right
anterior process of calcaneus [**Doctor Last Name **], orthopedic surgery was
recommended a CT of the right and left ankles.  CT revealed
anterior process of right calcaneus fracture, tear tilt on the
right with asymmetric mortise narrowing anteromedially and
widening laterally and left distal fibular fracture.
Orthopedics recommended partial weight bearing in right lower
extremity in aircast boot and weight bearing as tolerated in the
left lower extremity in ankle stirrup.  She should follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of orthope
