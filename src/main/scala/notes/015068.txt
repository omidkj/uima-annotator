Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5868**]
Chief Complaint:
Syncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The pt. is an 85 year-old right-handed female who presented on
[**2159-9-8**] after she experienced a syncopal episode.  The pt is
unclear of the events surrounding her hospitalization, therefore
the history is primarily per the pt's daughter.  The pt was home
alone last night until her daughter returned at approximately
midnight.  At that time, her daughter found her sitting in a
chair, too weak to get up, incontinent of stool.  When the
daughter attempted to get the pt out of the chair to clean her,
she slumped back into the chair, became minimally responsive,
and had a "blank stare" for approximately 5 minutes.  There was
no evidence of abnormal jerking movements. Her daughter noted
that her left eye looked "droopy."  The pt does not recall the
events, but did feel that after she was found by her daughter
and before EMS arrived, her speech seemed "slurred."  EMS
arrived shortly after she was found by her daughter.  At that
time, she was described as alert, oriented x 3.  She was brought
to the ED for evaluation.  ED notes document "4-/5 strength of
upper and lower extremities."  She was admitted to the medicine
service for work- up of syncope and physical therapy.  The
primary medicine team noted that the pt had severe bilateral
proximal muscle weakness.  The pt stated that this had been
present since the prior evening.  She offered no other
complaints at the time of the neurology consult.  Specifically,
the pt denied headache, loss of vision, blurred vision,
diplopia, dysphagia.  She denied vertigo. She denied
difficulties producing or comprehending speech.  She denied
focal numbness, parasthesiae.  She did admit to progressive
difficulty with her gait and multiple falls over the
past year.
.
On review of systems, the pt. denied recent fever or chills.  No
night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denied cough,
shortness of breath.  Denied chest pain or tightness,
palpitations.  Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation
or
abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
No
dysuria.  Denied arthralgias or myalgias.

.
CXR ([**9-9**]): There is again present a dual lead left-sided
cardiac [**Month/Year (2) 4448**] with leads in stable position. A large bore
right-sided dialysis catheter is again present with the tip
terminating in the right atrium. There has been interval
development of bilateral small pleural effusions with associated
atelectatic changes. There is mild interstitial prominence
without overt edema. Linear atelectatic changes are also noted
in the left mid lung zone. The osseous structures are stable.
.

NCCTH [**9-9**]: FINDINGS: There is no intraparenchymal or
extra-axial hemorrhage. There is no shift of normally midline
structures, mass effect or hydrocephalus. Scattered
periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensities are
again noted consistent with mild chronic small vessel ischemic
change. The visualized paranasal sinuses and osseous structures
are within normal limits.
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
.
NCCTH ([**9-10**]): New small focal hypodensity in left frontal
periventricular location, likely a small focus of evolving
infarction. No intracranial hemorrhage, midline shift, or change
in ventricle size.
.
NCCTH ([**9-11**]): No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or edema.
Further evolution of tiny left periventricular white matter area
of infarction.
.
Carotid series:
1. Appearance suggestive of complete occlusion of the left
common, internal, and external carotid arteries in the neck.
2. Significant plaque at the origin of the right internal
carotid artery, associated with a severe stenosis, estimated
between 80 and 99% in diameter reduction.
3. Tardus parvus flow pattern in the left vertebral artery.
Antegrade flow in the right vertebral artery.
.
TEE:
Thickened, calcified mitral valve with torn chordae and possible

partial flail. At least mild to modertae mitral regurgitation. A
valvular
vegetation cannot be excluded. If clinically indicated, a TEE
may better
characterize the basis and severity of mitral valve disease.
Compared to the prior study (tape reviewed) dated [**2158-8-7**],
prolapsing, torn
mitral chordae are new. The degree of mitral regurgitation
appears similar
(may be underestimated).
.
There has been placement of an endotracheal tube, with the tip
terminating within 1.5 cm of the carin
