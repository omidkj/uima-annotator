History of Present Illness:
67 yo female rehab resident h/o CKD, PMR currently on a long
steroid taper, recent MRSA HD line infection on Vancomycin
presented to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital today with AMS since Tuesday,
and a UTI. Per her son, she was recently admitted to [**Name (NI) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Date range (1) 88611**] ago and was placed on temporary HD for large
volume diuresis. Volume overload at that time was felt secondary
to high dose steroids. On admission, her Cr was 1.1 and prior to
d/c her cr was 1.9. She was discharged on lasix 80 [**Hospital1 **] as she
was still felt to be volume overloaded. She developed a MRSA
blood stream infection from her HD line. Line was discontinued
and completed a 2 week course of vancomycin. HD was stopped. She
regained renal function after continuing lasix 80 [**Hospital1 **] and was
reportedly euvolemic. On the Tuesday prior to admission, the
family and rehab staff noted that the patient was becoming
increasingly paranoid and yelling at staff members. She was
taken to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and found to have ARF. The family decided
to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 98.2 90 85/43 18 92% on 4L. Exam
notable for oriented x 0 and uncooperative with questions. Found
to be hypoxic to 86% on 5L NC and improved to 100% on NRB. Also,
notably had decreased sbp's in the 70s transiently that
recovered without intervention. A right IJ was placed.
.
She was found to have a diffuse rash in her medial thighs. She
was given 125 methlypredisone and 50 IV benadryl. There was
concern for necrotizing fasciatis and an abdominal CT was
performed with cuts down to her thighs that did not show
evidence of this, however she was given 150 mg of clindamycin.
.
Also, EKG showed sinus tach with mild depressions in lateral
leads. She was given 600 mg PR ASA. She was notably guaiac
negative.
.
Other labs notable for a wbc of 12.9 with a left shift, proBNP:
[**Numeric Identifier 88612**], elevated ALT: 597, AST: 282, Cr of 3.1 (baseline ?1.1),
and a grossly positive UA. CXR significant for a left pleural
effusion and increased peri-hilar fullness consistent with
volume overload. She was given a dose of 750 mg of levofloxacin
for presumed PNA and her UTI.  VS prior to transfer: 80 105/43
14 100% NRB, CVP: [**11-12**].

Upon arrival to the MICU, patient is yelling at nursing to stop
hurting her and not oriented. Her NRB was weaned down to a 70%
shovel mask


Past Medical History:
- CKD, baseline Cr 1-1.2. Prior to d/c from OSH [**3-25**]: Cr 1.9.
- Recent admission to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] where she was placed on
temporary HD for volume overload, subsequently developed a MRSA
HD line infection/bacteremia and treated with line removal and 2

Brief Hospital Course:
Death: The patient presented to the hospital with altered mental
status secondary to bacteremia. The patient on hospital day 3
was intubated for airway protection as she was tachypneic and
tiring out. Subsequently she continued to develop hypotension
with multiple repeat blood cultures, urine cultures and sputum
cultures that grew out multiple organisms including pseudomonas,
MRSA and yeast. The patient was started on a myriad of
antibiotics including vanco, zosyn, linezolid, dapto,
amphotercin, cefteraline. She also developed hypotension during
the admission that required a central line to be started. She
was at time of CMO status on 3 pressors to support a MAP of 50s.
The patient also became acutely fluid overloaded and was started
on CVVH for ultrafiltration and pulling fluid off. This was
successful in returning the patient to her dry weight however
subseuqently the patient became severely hypotensive. During the
admission the patient also became neutropenic with an ANC of 0.
Otherwise also became thrombocytopenic with a negative DIC
panel. A family meeting with the patient resulted in CMO status.
The patient was extubated and all pressors were discontinued.
The patient died within minutes of this occuring. She was
pronounced at 0043 on [**2200-4-21**]. NEOB was notified prior to time
of death and was refused. PCP was [**Name (NI) 653**]. Admitting office
was [**Name (
