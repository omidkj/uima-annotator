History of Present Illness:
30M w/ metastatic HCC s/p exlap w/ debulking, s/p sorafenib
therapy (d/c 3 weeks ago following R bloody pleural effusions)
today presented [**Hospital **] clinic, where he is followed for a malignant
effusion, and has pleurex catheter without recent drainage. The
pt complained there of worsening dyspnea, total body pain. In
clinic received 5FU/leukovorin in 1L NS when he was noted to be
dehydrated and hyponatremia to 126. He was called at home and
asked to come to the ED for evaluation. Of note Mr. [**Known lastname **] was
recently admitted on [**11-26**] for SOB and pleuritic chest pain to
the thoracic service. A CTA was negative for PE. A repeat
thoracentesis for his chronic right sided pleural effusion was
done with only 30cc of fluid removed. He was then transferred to
the omed service for pain control and further management. His
pain was adequately controlled with the addition of mscontin to
his home dilaudid regimen and he was d/c'd on [**2137-12-2**]. The
patient is currently off anticoaggulation [**3-9**] to hemorrhagic
pleural effusion in setting of sorafinib use.
.
In ED hr 85, 106/64, 216, 98% on 2.5L. The pt was noted to have
increased dyspnea from baseline. Pleurex, not much drainage. The
patient was seen IP. EKG was noted to have new lateral T-Wave
Inversions. CXR revealed a massive Pulmonary effusion. While CT
revealed progressive Pulmonary Emboli. The pt was guaiac neg. He
received levo/vanco for question post-obstructive pna in the
LUL. In addition there was a question of LLL infarct. His repeat
labs revealed a sodium of 132. He's admitted for further
evaluation. The patient also underwent a CT head to evaluate for
metastatic process. The pt was started on a Heparin gtt without
Bolus and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 30 man with metastatic HCC now with increased SOB, pain
found to have worsening PE's.
-
# Pulmonary Embolism: Pt with known PEs, worsened based on
symptoms and imaging findings. Pt recently taken off
anti-coagulation in setting of malignant hemorrhagic R pleural
effusion and concurrent chemotherapy with sorafenib. However,
per onc fellow pt has been off chemo for 3 weeks. Due increase
of clot burden, decision was made to start heparin without a
bolus.
.
#Pneumonia: Pt with subjective fever, normal WBC count, but CXR
findings of a LUL/?post-obstructive pneumonia.  Patient was
given IV vanco for MRSA coverage, levoflox for CAP/atypicals
.
# Hyponatremia: 128 in ED, same on last [**Month/Year (2) **] draw [**12-24**]. Likely
secondary to SIADH. However, pt appears dry on exam and had
decreased PO intake.
.
#metastatic HCC/Hep [**Name (NI) **] Per pt's outpt oncologist, pt is s/p
cycle [**4-11**] of chemotherapy. Pt wants to give full regimen a try.
Known metastasis to the lung and abdomen. Head Ct appears to be
negative.

[**12-28**]
- Patient incredibly uncomfortable with pain.
-[**Name (NI) **] pt's family at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 26386**]- Talked with woman who
called herself the pt's mother- [**Name (NI) 1022**] [**Name (NI) 26387**] [**Name (NI) 26388**] and pt's cousin-
[**Name (NI) 915**] [**Name (NI) **]. I told them the pt is here and very ill. They seemed
to be aware of his chronic illness and have apparently seen him
within the last week or so. The woman stated that the pt also
has an adoptive mother in [**Country 3992**] but she does not know where
this woman is. She will try to get contact info for this other
mother and bring it with her to the hospital tomorrow.... The
pt's relatives ("mother" [**Doctor Last Name 1022**], "father", and cousin) came in this
evening around 7pm. Through an interpreter, I informed them of
the pt's condition and that it is very serious. They will
attempt to contact the family in [**Country 3992**] themselves.
-Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from oncology was [**Last Name (STitle) 653**] and noted that he was okay
with a decision to changed the patients code status/ goals of
care/ further tx to keep him more comfortable given his
intractable pain overnight.
-Decision was eventually made with help from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2270**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1764**] to make
patient CMO and he was changed to morphine gtt.
- Family came to visit and made patient CMO. Palleative care
facilitated family meeting and transition
- on [**12-29**] he passed at 0450 AM.  Family was [**Month/Year (2) 653**] and
[**Name2 (NI) 26389**] post-mortem examination.
