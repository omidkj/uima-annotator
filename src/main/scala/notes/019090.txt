Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**]
Chief Complaint:
Right sided weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
extubation

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 72 yo woman who was with her family, and as per report from
[**Hospital 15405**] at time of transfer, was last seen well by her family
at 3 pm, she as
sitting on a couch, watching TV, and was actively conversing
with
the family, she then presented with acute right sided weakness,
right facial weakness, dysarthria. When the EMS arrived, a
non-rebreather mask was placed on the patient, the family stated
that the patient had been in the US for 3 weeks. [**Hospital 15405**]
mentioned that she was lethargic, and that her GCS was 8.  When
she was intubated at [**Hospital 15405**] with etomidate (20 mg then 10 mg),
succinylcholine (100 mg) and vercuronium (10 mg), she had
non-sustained Vtach and needed 150 mg of amiodarone, and an amp
of bicarb and magnesium, given 1 g Dilantin, 10 U insulin with
an
amp of D50. At the OSH, her first set of cardiac enzymes were
negative but in the transfer paperwork, there was question of an
anterior septal MI. In the OSH, her potassium was 3.2, sodium
139, her INR was 0.95, Plts 261, crit 38.8. She was initially
put
on Propofol, but because of her blood pressure dropping too
much,
she was given doses of Fentanyl before she was transferred here
by Mediflight.

Imaging:

Radiology Report CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2158-10-23**]
5:44 PM
FINDINGS: There is an acute hemorrhage in the left thalamus
measuring 29 x 36
mm. There is associated mass effect with shift of a variant
cavum vergae.
There is also intraventricular hemorrhage layering in the right
occipital
[**Doctor Last Name 534**], likely due to extension of the left thalamic hemorrhage.
There is no
associated obstructive hydrocephalus. This area of hemorrhage,
is largely
unchanged since examination from [**2158-10-23**] from outside hospital.
No other foci
of hemorrhage is appreciated. There is prominence of the basilar
artery and
aneurysm cannot be excluded. There is periventricular
hypodensity compatible
with chronic small vessel ischemic changes. There is no evidence
of
transtentorial or uncal herniation. Note is made of fluid in the
nasopharynx,
likely representing pooling of secretions. The visualized
portions of the
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated. No
acute fractures
identified.

IMPRESSION:
1. Right thalamic hemorrhage, likely hypertensive in etiology,
with
intraventricular extension. No significant interval change from
outside
hospital CT performed on [**2158-10-23**].
2. Prominence of the tip of the basilar artery - please refer to
subsequent
CTA head for additional details.

Radiology ReportCTA NECK W&W/OC & RECONS Study Date of [**2158-10-23**]
7:10 PM

NONCONTRAST HEAD CT: The previously noted hematoma centered in
the left
thalamus, with extension into the corona radiata, is unchanged
in size.
Surrounding edema is unchanged in extent. Partial compression
and mild
rightward shift of the third ventricle are unchanged. The extent
of blood
products in the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and body of the left lateral
ventricle is
unchanged. The lateral ventricles are unchanged in size without
evidence of
hydrocephalus at this time. No new intra-axial or extra-axial
hemorrhage is
noted.

There is thickening of the posterolateral walls of the maxillary
sinuses,
suggestive of previous chronic sinusitis. However, there is no
evidence of
sinusitis at this time. Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes are
present, with
associated nasopharyngeal secretions.

NECK CTA: The aortic arch and origins of the great vessels
appear
unremarkable. There is no evidence of significant
atherosclerosis or stenoses
in the cervical common carotid, internal carotid, or vertebral
arteries.

There is a 1.8 x 1.8 cm pulmonary lesion with spiculated margins
in the imaged
upper right lung (image 3:13). This lesion is either cavitary or
abuts a pre-
existing cavity, such as a pneumatocele, bulla, or dilated
bronchiole. No
evidence of lymphadenopathy is seen in the imaged superior
mediastinum.
Spondylosis is noted in the cervical spine.

HEAD CTA: The intracranial internal carotid and vertebral
arteries, and their
major branches, are patent without evidence of hemodynamically
significant
stenoses or aneurysms. There is no evidence of an arteriovenous
malformation.

IMPRESSION:

1. Unchanged appearance of the left thalamic/corona radiata
hemorrhage with
intraventricular extension.

2. Normal CTA of the head and neck. No evidence of intracranial
aneurysm or
arteriovenous malformation.

3. 1.8 cm mass with spiculated margins in the imaged portion of
the right
upper lung, which is either cavitary or abutting a pre-existing
cavity. A
dedicated chest CT is recommended for further evaluation. This
