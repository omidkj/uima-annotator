Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 69838**]
Chief Complaint:
Syncope, altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation.

History of Present Illness:
84yo woman with past medical history notable for hypertension,
hypothyroidsim, rheumatoid arthritis, CHF was brought into ED
after syncopal episode. By EMS reports, she was walking outside
on sidewalk when she told a bystander that she was not feeling
well. She subsequently fell (no trauma, caught by bystander) and
lost consciousness. When EMS arrived, they found her minimally
responsive and s/p nausea/vomiting.
.
On evaluation in our ED, initial vitals were 98.9, 75, 146/70,
16, and 100% on RA;  she was suspected to have had an aspiration
event, and she was intubated for airway protection. Otherwise,
her evaluation in ED was notable for the following: UA with
negative LE, Nit, WBC, trace ketones. Normal CBC. Normal Coags.
Negative serum and urine tox screen. Mild elevation in amylase
at 208, but otherwise normal LFT's and lipase. Chemistry with
mild elevation of BUN at 23, normal anion gap of 11, and
elevated lactate at 3.3. Initial set of cardiac enzymes was CK
35, MB nd, trop < 0.01. Abdominal CT was done to evaluate
abdominal pain and nausea/vomiting, which was negative for any
acute abdominal pathology. Chest film had no acute infiltrates
or other findings. CT and CTA of the head demonstrated no new
pathology and patent cerebral and vertebral vasculature.
.
In ED, she received empiric levaquin/flagyl for possible
abdominal infection. She also received fentanyl and versed for
intubation/sedation.

CXR [**3-28**]: Minimal patchy density at the right base, new compared
with
[**2161-3-26**].  Most likely etiology is some subsegmental atelectasis,
but given the history of fevers, the possibility of an early
pneumonic infiltrate cannot be entirely excluded.

B LE u/s: Postsurgical changes of the left leg, with patent left
common
femoral and popliteal veins.  The left superficial femoral vein
can only be followed for a few centimeters proximally, where it
is patent.

Ct abd: 1.  No acute intra-abdominal pathology.
2. 5 x 3 cm left adnexal cyst is smaller than on prior study.
Slightly
enlarged uterine cavity could be further evaluated with pelvic
ultrasound when the patient's clinical status improves.

CTA head and neck: No evidence of infarction.  No evidence of
hemorrhage.  No vascular stenosis or occlusions detected.

Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are  normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal  technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.  Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve  leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no  aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with  trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial  effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of  [**2154-6-6**], there is no definite change.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 102770**] is an 84yo woman with hypertension, untreated
hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis on prednisone and congetive
heart failure.  She reports symptoms lasting over months
including lethargy, feeling presyncopal about once per week,
pins and needles in her feet and hands with poor sleep at night,
and recurrent chest pain.  During her admission, her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) 2903**] was out of his office so we could not speak with him
direcly, however notes faxed form his office to [**Hospital1 18**] reported
all of the above symptoms (except for presyncope/syncope) over
the course of months.  She presented to the hospital after a
syncopal episode with nausea and vomiting.

# Syncope: On arrival she was quite lethargic. She was seen by
the stroke team, who found her exam to be nonfocal and not
consistent with stroke. She was intubated in the ER for airway
protection given her somnolence and nausea. There was fear of
aspiration, however this was not noted on her intial CXR.  She
was transferred to the MICU for further care where she remained
intubated until HD#2 when she was successfully extubated without
evidence of respiratory distress. Subsequent work up of syncope,
including CT of the head, abdomen, and pelvis were all
unremarkable. Telemetry showed no arhythmia. A TTE was
unremarkable, with no valvular disease, normal EF, and no wall
motion abnormalities.  She had no further episodes of syncope or
presyncope throughout her stay.  Cause of her syncope remains
unknown but is likely multifactorial, including hypothyroidism,
dehydration (the patient drinks a maximum of 2 glass water per
day at home, orthostatics could not be checked given early
intubation), and possible vasovagal component.

# aspiration pneumonia: On hospital day 2, after extubation, she
became febrile to 101.1, her CXR revealed evidence of likely
aspiration PNA and she was started on levofloxacin and flagyl
without difficulty. She was quickly weaned to room air and
remained on this throughout her hospital stay without
respiratory difficulty. On the day of discharge flagyl was
discontinued as the patient complained of nausea. She is
discharged to complete a 10 day course of levofloxacin.

# Hypothyroid: On pasat records, the pateint has a history of
hypothyroidism.  Per discussion with Dr.[**Name (NI) **] office as well
as his faxed notes, she was previously treated with 125mcg
synthroid which resulted in hyperthyroidism.  She was
subsequently treated with 100mcg synthroid which resulted in
hyperthyroidism.  She has not taken any synthroid since [**Month (only) 216**]
[**2160**], however her TSH has been elevated during this time. She
does seem symptomatic, noting months of lethargy, constipation,
feeling sleepy, sleeping late in the morning. Her TSH was
elevated at 5.8 during this hospitalization and she was started
on 50mcg synthroid po qday. Her TSH should be checkedto monitor
this dose in one month as an outpatient.
.
# Rheumatoid Arthritis: The patient came in on prednisone for
her rheumatoid arthritis. After receiving dexamethasone poast
extubation as above for facial swelling, she was tapered down to
her homedose of prednisone and is discharged on this dose. She
complained of continued leg and knee pain during her stay, which
has been an ongoing problem for her as an outpatient.
.
# Bilateral lower extremity ?neuropathy: She notes tingling
bilaterally in
