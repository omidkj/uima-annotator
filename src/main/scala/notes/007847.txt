History of Present Illness:
82 year old female with PMH significant for Afib on coumadin,
HTN was transferred from [**Hospital 15096**] medical center with 2-3cm
left parieto-occipatal bleed. The patient was in her USOH until
around 2pm on day of admission when she suddenly felt
"weird/unable to complete sentences" while sitting at her
kitchen table. Confusion was noted by EMS and at the OSH ED, she
was noted to have an expressive aphasia. CT demonstrated ICH and
FFP was given to reverse and INR of 2.7. She was then
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she was initially hypertensive to the
220s/140s.
Nitro gtt was initially hung, then changed to a nicardipine drip
and then to a labetolol drip due to high heart rate.
- She then had a repeat head CT that did not demonstrate any
significant change.
- She was given Factor 9 complex x2 and vitamin K and decadron
8mg x 1
- After returning from CT scan, she had repetitive stereotyped
movements of the fingers of the right hand and right gaze
deviattion
and no longer spoke. It seemed that the patient was having a
seizure and 2mg of ativan was given.
- She then desatted into the 80s and intubated. She was loaded
with 1g dilantin and started on a propofol gtt.
- Subsequently, her blood pressure dropped to as low as 60s/40s
and was started on a Neosynephrine gtt.
.
In the ICU, she was noted to have transaminitis, ARF, troponin
elevation, elevated lactate and thrombocytopenia and [**Female First Name (un) 1634**]/Med
Consult recommended that she be transferred to the MICU for
management.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2153-10-28**] 7:10 PM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: Please evaluate for enlarging bleed.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
82 yo F transferred from OSH with expressive aphasia.
Intraparenchymal head bleed in L occipital lobe 2-3 cm.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please evaluate for enlarging bleed.
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 82-year-old female transferred from outside hospital
with expressive aphasia and known left occipital lobe
intracranial hemorrhage. Evaluate evolution.

Despite the given history, no comparison studies available at
the time of review.

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast CT of the head.

FINDINGS: Within the left occipital lobe there is a 2 x 2 cm
round hyperdense lesion consistent with an intraparenchymal
hemorrhage. There is a moderate amount of surrounding
hypodensity consistent with edema. There is no evidence of
herniation. No additional areas of hemorrhage are identified.
Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.

IMPRESSION:
1. Left 2-cm occipital lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage with
surrounding edema.
2. No evidence of new intracranial hemorrhage.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGL; DUPLEX DOPP ABD/PEL

Reason: ASsess for Budd Chiari Syndrome or other clots in the
hepati

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
82 year old woman with intracranial hemorrhage, s/p hypotensive
episode with ? DIC and now rapidly rising LFTs
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
ASsess for Budd Chiari Syndrome or other clots in the hepatic or
portal vasculature.
INDICATION: 82-year-old woman with intracranial hemorrhage and
hypotension with question of DIC and rapidly rising LFTs.

COMPARISON: None.

RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: The study was limited, given
bedside technique and patient's inability to cooperate. The
left, middle, and right hepatic veins are patent with normal
waveforms. The main portal vein is patent with normal waveforms.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilation. The
liver parenchyma is difficult to evaluate; however, no focal
lesions is seen. The gallbladder is collapsed, but does have a
thickened wall which may be related to systemic processes, such
as hypoalbuminemia; there may be a small amount of sludge
layering within it. There is no evidence of right-sided
hydronephrosis.

IMPRESSION: Limited study, with patent hepatic veins and main
portal vein.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
