[**2124-11-1**]
MRI C SPINE
IMPRESSION:
1. Fracture/compression deformity of C4 with retropulsion
causing severe
spinal stenosis at C6-7 level. No abnormal signal detected
within the cord.  Rupture of the posterior longitudinal and
interspinous ligaments at C6-7 interspinous space with
surrounding edema.

2. Perched facet on left and dislocated/locked facet on right at
at C6-7
level. Multilevel degenerative changes with disc bulge and
neural foraminal narrowing as described above

CT C-Spine [**11-3**]:
No significant change, status post anterior spinal fusion of C6
through T1 with partial corpectomy of C7 and bone graft
placement.

CXR [**11-4**]:
Patchy opacity left lower lobe, consistent with collapse and/or
consolidation, new c/w [**2124-11-1**]. Small effusions.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt seen in emergency room after MVA and CT C spine with findings
of C5-6 jumped facet and C6-7 perched facet. On admission she
was slightly weak in her RUE with strength 4/5. In discussion
with attending Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**] it was decided that she would benefit
from urgent decompression with C7 corpectomy with allograft and
plate from an anterior approach. She tolerated this procedure
very well with no complications. Post operatively she was
transfered to the ICU for further care including q1 neurochecks
and pain control with dilaudid PCA. On post op exam she was
doing well. Her complaints of R arm pain had improved as did the
strength in her R arm. Though she was somewhat limited by pain
her strength was 4+/5. She had no difficulties overnight and on
the morning of POD#1 she was transferred to the floor in stable
condition. The pain management team was consulted for
recommendations to change to PO pain medications given her
history of IV drug abuse. Pain medications were altered in
attempt of achieving adequate control.

On [**11-3**] her foley was removed and PT/OT consults were
requested. They determined that she met criteria for discharge
to home with PT services.

On [**11-4**] she developed a fever and slight cough.  A CXR was
obtained, which demonstrated LLL consolodation, consistent with
CAP.  She was started on Levaquin PO for 7 days. Her central
line was removed, and the tip of the catheter was sent for
cultures.

On [**11-5**] she was afebrile, and ambulatory with PT.  Cantral line
cx were still pending, but the decision was made to discharge
the patient and follow up on the line cultures as an outpatient.
 She was discharged to home on [**11-5**].
