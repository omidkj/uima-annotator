Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1271**]
Chief Complaint:
Cerebellar hemorrhage

History of Present Illness:
59yo F h/o HTN who was in good health until she woke at 3am
on [**3-26**] with headache, nausea and dizziness which caused her
to fall twice at home going to the restroom (presumably
vertiginous). She sustained no traumatic injury in these falls
and at 6:30am she called in sick to work, due to the dizziness.
At 10:30am, she went to her PCP but while in the waiting room,
she became unresponsive and limp, with eyes deviated to the
right
while sitting in a chair and was taken emergently to [**Hospital **]
Hospital. Exam there was documented as "pt now awake,
understands
staff, answers yes & no questions with nods. Points with both
hands."

There, head CT found cerebellar hemorrhage and she was given
dilantin IV and was intubated (with paralytics) for transport
here for neurosurgical intervention.  On arrival here she had an
EVD placed.

MRI: [**3-29**]: Today's exam is correlated with the head CT from
[**2156-3-27**]. There is a small area of increased T2 signal
within the right thalamus, which does not appear to have slow
diffusion. This could represent a subacute infarct. There is a
large cerebellar hemorrhage as on the head CT, involving both
the left and right cerebellar hemispheres as well as the vermis.
There is considerable mass effect upon the fourth ventricle.
Hydrocephalus remains, although the size and shape of the
lateral ventricle is unchanged from the head CT.

The right frontal ventriculostomy catheter has been repositioned
since the head CT. The tip now terminates approximately 1 cm
within the mid brain.

I discussed positioning with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 7306**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], M.D., from
neurosurgery and the catheter has been pulled back.

There continues to be tonsillar herniation.

There are no definite areas of enhancement with no definite
underlying masses. Followup examination can be obtained once the
edema resolves and the blood products evolve.

IMPRESSION: Subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage as well
as large posterior fossa hemorrhage causing compression of the
fourth ventricle. No change from the head CT in the degree of
hydrocephalus. The ventriculostomy catheter has been
repositioned but now has tip terminating in the midbrain.

Small subacute infarct in the right thalamus.

CXR [**4-6**]: AP chest compared to [**3-30**] through 19:
Pulmonary edema. Previous pleural effusions and left lower lobe
atelectasis have all resolved. Feeding tube ends in the stomach.
Heart size is normal. Fullness at the thoracic inlet suggests
enlargement of the right lobe of the thyroid gland.

CT of Head [**4-6**]: Progression of ascending transtentorial
herniation compared to [**2156-4-5**]. Slight possible increase in
right cerebellar hemispheric edema and hemorrhage. Interval
removal of right ventriculostomy catheter with associated
interval pneumocephalus within the ventricular system and
associated increased lateral ventricular and third ventricle
size.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 71733**] was admitted and emergently had a right sided EVD
placed.  She was started on Mannitol, admitted to the ICU her BP
was kept strictly below 140.  She was noted to have increased
triponins from 0.19 to 0.91.  An MRI was performed which showed
no masses or underlying lesions.  Her EVD drain was noted to be
near the midbrain and was pulled back twice.  The patient was
followed closely with serial CTs showing intraventricular and
posterior fossa hemorrhage.  She was extubated on [**3-27**],  Her
examined improved daily but was noted to have a left gaze palsy,
she would follow commands and have attempt to speak [**12-16**] words.
She failed a speech and swallow video swallow and was receiving
tube feeds.  She was found to be VRE positive and was on day 4
of Levofloxacin on discharge.  She was MRSA negative.   Her EVD
was weaned over 3 days and she was transferred to the step down.
 She was making good progress and her vent drain was weaned over
three days and removed on [**4-5**].  On the morning of [**4-6**] she was
found to have more lethargic and febrile a stat CT showed a
hydrocephlus and herniation and question of increase cerebellar
blood.  She was taken emergently to the OR and had a EVD placed
on left side ICP were noted to be [**4-24**].  CSF cultures were sent
and they have been preliminary negative along with urine
cultures.  Chest XRays showed: Pulmonary edema. Previous pleural
effusions and left lower lobe atelectasis have all resolved.

On day of transfer she was intubated but followed commands in
all extremities, answered yes/no question appropriately.   Her
right pupil has been larger than left but reactive since
admission and she continued with left gaze palsy.  She appeared
to be moving all extremities symmetrically and with good
strenght.

An angiogram was performed to assess for possible new posterior
fossa blood and a 2cm AVM was found at the L ICA/SCA junciton
and a 9mm draining anuersym.  She is transferred for vascular
neurosurgery care.
