Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5790**]
Chief Complaint:
Trachaelbronchialmalcia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2127-7-2**]: Right thoracotomy and tracheoplasty with mesh, right
mainstem bronchus/bronchus intermedius bronchoplasty with mesh,
left mainstem bronchus bronchoplasty with mesh, and flexible
bronchoscopy with aspiration.
[**2127-7-1**]: Dynamic flexible bronchoscopy.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 56-year-old gentleman with a history of COPD who
was found to have severe tracheobronchomalacia. He [**Known lastname 1834**] a
placement of a tracheobronchial silicone Y stent on [**2127-5-20**].
Following this his dyspnea on exertion markedly improved.
Unfortunately, he did suffer a stent-related infection and this
needed to be removed. We spoke at length at the utility of
moving on to a surgical correction of his malacia with posterior
splinting with Marlex mesh. We talked about the risks of this
procedure including injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve,
tracheal injury, esophageal injury, vessel,
heart, or diaphragmatic injury. We talked about the risks of
pneumonia or other infection as a result of this, as well as the
possibility of postoperative pain from the thoracotomy. We also
talked about the possibility that the cervical
trachea may develop or may present with symptomatic malacia
which would not be corrected by this intrathoracic procedure.
Finally, we discussed the possibility of improvement of the
malacia without betterment of his symptoms despite the stent
trial findings, if his underlying lung disease were to take
precedence. Mr. [**Known lastname **] and his partner had a chance to ask all
pertinent questions following this discussion and they wished to
proceed.

Brief Hospital Course:
56M former smoker with TBM and COPD who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2127-7-1**] s/p Y-stent removal for follow-up bronchoscopy and
Tracheoplasty. On [**2127-7-2**] Mr.[**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] Right thoracotomy
and tracheoplasty with mesh. He tolerated the procedure well and
a right chest tube was left in place. Pt was extubated
transferred to the surgical ICU from the operating room.
Post-operative pain was controlled with an epidural catheter as
well as a PCA (split bupivacaine/Dilaudid) managed by the acute
pain service. Pt received scheduled nebulizer treatments. On
POD#2 PCA and epidural were increased, and clonidine was started
for improved pain control. The patients blood pressure was low
via arterial line with systolic pressures in the 70's and 80's.
The pts urine output was also decreased during this time for
which he was bolused with crystalloid and transfused with
Hespan. Diltiazem was held and narcotics were reduced with good
effect of SBP in the 120's and return of appropriate urine
output by the morning of POD#3. On POD#3 the chest tube was
removed and the patient was transferred from the ICU to the
surgical floor.  Pt continued to improve with scheduled
nebulizer treatments, and was ambulating and tolerating a
regular diet. O2 was weaned as tolerated but still required to
maintain saturations >90%. Pts home medications were restarted
including his home dose of diltiazem which he tolerated well. On
POD#5 dermatology was consulted for a lesion on the patients
penis which was not improving with antifungal cream. A biopsy of
the lesion was taken by dermatology, of which the pathology was
pending at the time of discharge. On POD#6 pt was weaned off of
oxygen and maintained saturations above 90% with ambulation. Pt
was discharged home on POD#7 off of supplemental oxygen,
tolerating a regular diet, and ambulating without assistance.
