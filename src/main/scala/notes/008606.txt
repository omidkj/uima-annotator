Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2234**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
posterior cervical fusion laminectomy w/ non-segmental
instrumentation of c1-c2 on [**2185-1-13**]

History of Present Illness:
86 F w/ htn, ?chf, asthma, gerd, h/o C1 fx in [**8-7**], admitted on
[**1-13**] for posterior cervical fusion laminectomy w/ non-segmental
instrumentation of c1-c2. The operation was performed on [**2185-1-13**]
w/out complication.
Per report, post-op, the patient remained intubated initially.
Extubation was attempted on [**1-14**], but reportedly pt became fluid
overloaded and had respiratory distress/hypoxia and was
re-intubated (? component of pain medication contribution at
this time as ABG demonstrates hypercarbic resp failure w/
7.13/77/99). She was administered several doses of lasix during
day yesterday w/ good UOP. Today AM, ABG was noted to be
7.43/28/132, pt was re-extubated at approximately 7AM,
maintaining good oxygenation for approximately 2 hours, then
desaturated to O2 sats in the 80's and was unable to follow
commands. Per report, pt was getting increased labored
breathing, and plans to get lasix, but was delayed in getting
this. She eventually was given lasix 40mg IV x 1 w/ good UOP,
but was re-intubated nasally using fiberoptics due to edematous
airway.  Transferred to MICU for difficulty to extubate.

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2185-1-14**]:
The ET tube tip is 3 cm above the carina but note is made at its
tip impinging the lateral wall of the trachea and should be
repositioned to prevent future stricture or tracheal stenosis.
The right subclavian line tip is in mid SVC. The moderate
cardiomegaly is unchanged as well as left retrocardiac
atelectasis and pleural effusion. New right lower lobe opacity
obscuring the right heart border is consistent with new right
middle and partially lower lobe atelectasis. Small right pleural
effusion cannot be excluded. Sutures in the left upper abdomen
are unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Tip of the trachea at appropriate level but the
impinging the right lateral wall of the trachea should be
repositioned. Unchanged left retrocardiac atelectasis and
pleural effusion. Right middle and partial lower lobe
atelectasis, new since [**1-13**]. No evidence of failure.
.
CXR [**2185-1-15**]:
The ET tube tip currently is low about 1.2 cm above the carina.
The ET tube cuff is slightly hyperinflated. There is no
significant change in the bibasal atelectasis, pleural effusion
and cardiomegaly.
The cervical spine fusion hardware is noted.

Echo [**1-18**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. The left ventricular cavity
is mildly dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment/Plan: Pt is an 86 yo woman w/ h/o htn, ?chf, asthma,
gerd, h/o C1 fx in [**8-7**], admitted on [**1-13**] for posterior cervical
fusion laminectomy w/ non-segmental instrumentation of c1-c2,
transferred to the MICU for recurrent failure to extubate.

# Respiratory failure/CHF: Respiratory failure/failure to
extubate thought to be multifactorial.  First extubation was due
to hypercarbic respiratory failure and was felt to be due to
opiates.  Second extubation failed due to hypoxemic respiratory
failure thought to be due to flash pulmonary edema.  She was
treated with lasix, and metoprolol and hydralazine for afterload
reduction.  Hydralazine was chosen over ACE-inhibitor due to
element of acute renal failure.  Once this resolved she was
started on captopril.  She has an echo on [**1-18**] which
demonstrated diastolic and systolic dysfunction.  A murmur of
variable intensity was noted on exam from admission and echo
showed mild AR and MR and significant pulmonic regurgitation.
  With diuresis and afterload reduction, patient was extubated
on [**1-19**] and weaned to room air on [**1-21**].  She was given albuterol
and atrovent nebs which can be continued on a PRN basis.
Captopril may be converted to a long-acting ACE-inhibitor once
blood pressure adequately controlled (goal systolic BP 100-120).
 Patient had been on quinapril 20mg daily as an outpatient.
Patient should have daily weight monitoring and additional lasix
given if she gains more than 1kg.  She was on furosemide 20mg
daily as an outpatient and has been restarted on a standing
furosemide regimen prior to discharge to keep euvolemic.

# ARF: Acute renal failure was initially felt to be due to
pre-renal etiology in the setting of lasix and ace-inhibitor
administration.  Urine electrolytes however showed an elevated
Na suggesting ATN.  Creatinine normalized and Ace-inhibitor
restarted.

# HTN: As outpt, patient was on quinapril 20mg, Toprol XL 20mg,
lasix 20mg daily.  Were returned to prior outpatient regimen
prior to discharge and discharged on these medications.
