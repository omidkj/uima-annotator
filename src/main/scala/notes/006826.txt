History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 64yo woman w/ PMHx HTN, HLD, asthma, GERD, lumbar
radiculopathy who presented to ED w/sudden onset of worsening
SOB while climbing stairs. Per pt, she has had worsening SOB
over the last week which she says felt initially like her prior
asthma exacerbations. Last night she did four treatments at home
for her asthma w/some benefit but it was not lasting; this is
more than she usually needs. Denies fever, cough. No new leg
swelling or weight gain noted. Pt reported that SOB became
significantly worse over the last 24hr to the point where she
couldn't walk up 5 steps and when she got to the ED, had to rest
multiple times on her way from the parking lot to triage nurse.
Pt noted that she needs to sleep more upright during this time.
Of note, recent travel to [**State 2748**] ([**Street Address(2) 100294**]) 2 days ago.

In the ED, 97.3 153 147/96 28 95% 4L NC. On exam no wheezes but
felt tight in chest, peak flow of 300. Pt was tachycardic
(sinus). Guaiac negative but D-dimer elevated at 6496. ECG:
showed no rv strain; old left axis deviation and RBBB. CT of
chest showed bilat PE, large thrombus load, bowing of RV
concerning for right heart strain. CE show trop 0.03, proBNP
2290. WBC was elevated at 18.9 and HCT of 48.5. Lactate of 3.4.
IR was consulted and aware, but felt that "by imaging looks
difficult to treat, would recommend anticoagulation". Heparin
was initiated; had taken full aspirin at home. Admitted to the
ICU for tachycardia, dyspnea in setting of new diagnosis of PE
w/large clot burden.

On transfer VS were 136 134/99 23 99% 4 L NC. On arrival to
floor pt denied chest pain; did appear slightly breathless when
speaking at length but otherwise comfortable and no complaints
of pain. Hoping to get out of hospital soon and back to
teaching.

Review of sytems:
(+) Per HPI. SOB as above; did acknowledge some leg weakness but
gets this sometimes w/disc problems.
(-) [**Name2 (NI) **] abdominal pain. No paresthesias. No fever or chills.
Denies chest pain.

Past Medical History:
herniated disc; lumbar epidural steroid injection #2 of [**2106**] at
L5-S1 on [**2107-5-30**]
asthma
htn
Polypectomy after colonoscopy four years ago.
carpal tunnel syndrome.
knee surgery for ligament tear due to dislocation.
cesarean section.
moderate MR based on echo from [**2103**]


Social History:
Denies tobacco (no hx of smoking), EtOH, or illicit drug use
Special education teacher

Family History:
No hx of clots or PEs in family

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING
-------
CTA [**6-9**]:
1. Bilateral large pulmonary emboli seen filling both the right
and left
pulmonary arteries and all the distal branching vessels. There
is right heart strain secondary to bilateral PEs. There is no
evidence of distal pulmonary infarction.
2. Bronchial wall thickening suggestive of underlying airway
inflammatory
disease.

Chest X-ray [**6-9**]:
1. Limited examination of the left lower lung zone. If
clincially feasible, a PA and lateral chest radiograph series is
recommended.
2. Visualized portions of the lungs appear clear.

TTE [**6-10**]:
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent
with right ventricular pressure overload. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate thickening
of the mitral valve chordae. There is mild functional mitral
stenosis (mean gradient 6 mmHg) due to mitral annular
calcification. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderately dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle
with signs of pressure overload. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension. Mild left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved
regional/global systolic function. Mild functional mitral
stenosis. Mild-to-moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2103-5-11**], right ventricular size/function are
now abnormal, pulmonary artery pressures are higher, the
severity of tricuspid regurgitation has increased. The severity
of mitral regurgitation is reduced.

Bilateral lower extremity ultrasounds:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT. One left peroneal vein is not
visualized.

Brief Hospital Course:
64 yo woman w/ PMHx HTN, HLD, asthma, GERD, lumbar radiculopathy
who presented to ED w/sudden onset chest pain after feeling a
[**Doctor Last Name **] in leg while climbing stairs. Pt complains of feeling SOB
and tachycardic worsening last few days similar to prior asthma
exacerbations but now w/orthopnea. Found on CT to have bilateral
large thrombus burden PE with bowing of the ventricular septum
suggestive of right heart strain.

ACTIVE ISSUES
-------------
Pulmonary embolism: Patient had dyspnea and chest pain on
admission, with a risk factor of a recent long car ride but
otherwise medications and family history negative for PE, clots,
DVTs.  CTA showed bilateral pulmonary embolism, and patient was
initiated on a heparin drip, with warfarin started thereafter.
Transthoracic echocardiogram was performed and showed some
evidence of right heart strain and preexisting pulmonary
hypertension.  Lower extremity
