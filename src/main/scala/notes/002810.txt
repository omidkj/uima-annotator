Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2119-12-26**] Aortic Valve Replacement(19mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical),
Mitral Valve Replacment(25mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical), and Tricsupid

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 45 year old female with history of Hodgkins
Lymphoma treated with splenectomy as well as mantle radiation.
She has known aortic insufficiency and recently complainted of
worsening shortness of breath. A recent echocardiogram revealed
mild aortic stenosis, [**2-6**]+ aortic insufficiency, 3+ mitral
regurgitation, 2+ tricuspid regurgitation, with normal left
ventricular function. Subsequent cardiac catheterization
confirmed 3+ mitral regurgitation and 3+ aortic insufficiency
with normal LV function. Mean pulmonary artery pressure was
50mmHg. Coronary angiography showed only minimal coronary artery
disease. Based on the above results, she was referred for
cardiac surgical intervention.

Past Medical History:
Congestive Heart Failure, Hypercholesterolemia, History of
Hodgkins Lymphoma - s/p MANTLE radiation, Bipolar Disorder,
History of Endometriosis, s/p Thyroidectomy, s/p Splenectomy,

Social History:
Active smoker, 1PPD for the last 30 years. She denies ETOH. She
is married with children. She is currently on disability.

Family History:
Negative for premature coronary artery disease.

Abdomen: soft, nontender, normoactive bowel sounds

Brief Hospital Course:
On the day of admission, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**] performed aortic and
mitral valve replacements along with repair of the tricuspid
valve. Given history of Hodgkins lymphoma, mediastinal lymph
node biopsy was also obtained at time of the operation. For
further surgical details, please see seperate dictated operative
note. Following the operation, she ws brought to the CSRU for
invasive monitoring. She initially required Epinephrine,
Neosynephrine and volume for hemodynamics instability. She was
gradually weaned from sedation and eventually awoke
neurologically intact. On postoperative day two, she was
extubated without incident. Inotropes were weaned without
difficulty. She otherwise maintained stable hemodynamics and
transferred to the SDU on postoperative day two. She continued
to experience a drop in platelet count for which the Hematology
service was consulted. Platelet count dropped as low as 23K.
Initial HIT assays were negative and there was no evidence of
DIC or ongoing hemolysis. Given double mechanical valves,
anticoagulation with intravenous Argatroban was initiated and
titrated for a PTT between 60-80 seconds. Warfarin was not
started until platelet count reached over 100K.  Over several
days, platelet count improved and Warfarin anticoagulation was
started. Her target INR is between 3.0 - 3.5.  She was
aggressively diuresed during her stay.  During the
post-operative period she experiences atrial fibrillation and
was therefore seen in consultation by the cardiology service.
She was placed on amiodarone and ordered for [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of hearts
monitor upon discharge.  The rest of her hospital course was
unremarkable. She continued to make clinical improvements with
diuresis and made steady progress with physical therapy. She was
cleared for discharge to home on postoperative day 17.
