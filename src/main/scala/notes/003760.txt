CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE  [**2110-12-12**]
No hemodynamically significant stenosis was identified in the
bilateral extracranial carotid arteries
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2110-12-11**]
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. No
evidence of acute infarction. MRI is more sensitive for the
detection of acute infarction.
.
MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2110-12-11**] 12:33 PM
CONCLUSION: Unremarkable MRI and MRA of the head for age. No MR
features of acute vascular territorial infarct.
.
[**12-13**] EEG
IMPRESSION: Probably normal awake and drowsy EEG without focal,
lateralizing, or epileptiform features seen. A senile drowsy
pattern is
considered normal for this age although deep midline dysfunction
cannot
be fully excluded.
.
UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS RIGHT  [**2110-12-14**]
No right lower extremity DVT

Brief Hospital Course:
81 year old woman with h/o htn and rheumatoid arthritis (on
chronic steroids) admitted with urosepsis and found to have
stress-induced cardiomyopathy (s/p cath [**12-8**]). Found to have
thrombocytopenia consistent with HIT and may have suffered a TIA
 with negative head CT and MRI/MRA. Was placed on argatroban gtt
and aggrenox and bridged to coumadin while HIT Ab test was
pending.
.
## Thrombocytopenia: Patient's platelet count was 122K on
admission and dropped three days later to 62K. Differential
diagnosis included sepsis, possible HIT I or II. SQ heparin and
all flushes stopped. Concurrently, patient developed facial
droop, ptosis, tongue deviation and right LE swelling concerning
for arterial and venous thrombi. US of right LE negative for
DVT. While HIT Ab was pending, patient was started on argatroban
gtt. Hematology/oncology was consulted and recommended bridging
patient to warfarin. First HIT Ab [**Doctor First Name **] test returned as
negative. Argatroban ggt was discontinued after the INR was >3
after a 3 hour trial off argatroban. Second HIT Ab [**Doctor First Name **] was
negative suggesting no HIT Ab. Also, per heme/onc time course of
thrombocytopenia was shorter than expected for development of
HIT Ab (usually 5-6 days) however in the setting of a possible
TIA, patient will continue warfarin with goal INR betw [**2-20**] until
follow-up at hematology/oncology clinic.
.
## Neuro: Had new facial droop and tongue deviation on [**12-11**]
thought be a TIA likely secondary to HIT Ab. Head CT was
negative for bleed. Head MRI/MRA was negative for acute
ischemia. Carotid doppler showed no significant stenosis. HBAIC
6.0 and lipid panel within normal limits. Stroke team was
consulted and recommended starting ASA. Patient was switched
from salsalate to ASA without adverse drug rxn (hx of asa
allergy), and then switched to aggrenox. Patient placed on baby
ASA while on coumadin. Unclear whether facial signs were TIA or
twitching so EEG was performed which was negative for
epileptiform activity. Per stroke, continue ASA until outpatient
follow-up. Recommended increasing ASA dose to 325mg once off
warfarin.
.
## Cardiac: likely stress-induced cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo)
versus secondary to sepsis.
# Ischemia: patient had PTCA [**12-8**] revealing an LAD 60% occlus,
patent Lcx & RCA. Repeat echo [**12-9**] EF 25-30% severe LV
hypokinesis and LV sys fcn depression, RV sys fcn depression, no
endocarditis. TropI peaked at 25.3 at outside hospital, tropT
1.80 on admission. Patient started on toprol XL 25mg QD,
lisinopril 5mg PO QD and baby ASA. Nifedipine was held.
# Pump: Patient with low EF in setting of sepsis. Initially
hypotensive on levophed and aggressively fluid resuscitated.
Patient was on also hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone for 1
week course and then resumed on her outpatient dose of
prednisone 1mg PO BID. Patient was gradually weaned off
pressors. Patient became  hypotensive again secondary to
excessive diarrhea which improved with fluid boluses and
resolution of her dairrhea.
# Rhythm: Sinus with PVCs. Cont telemetry.
.
#. Fever/Leukocytosis: Likely [**2-19**] E coli UTI and +BC GNR, has
been afebrile since admission, leukocytosis may also be
secondary to steroids, newly diagnosed lymphoma. OSH cx ([**
