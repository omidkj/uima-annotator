Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Demerol

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
cardiac arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pacemaker/ICD generator change [**2186-9-5**]


History of Present Illness:
42 yo M CAD s/p MI '[**78**] (tx with TPA with rescue PCI of p LAD),
no significant dz on cath in '[**84**], ESRD on HD, former smoker, h/o
recent tunnelled HD line sepsis (pulled 2 weeks ago, on vanco at
HD since) p/w n/v and respiratory distress. Found by EMS to be
bradycardic HR 50 with agonal respirations at a rate of 4/min,
then became pulseless with wide complex irregular rhythym,
shocked 3 times, unclear number of shocks delivered by patients
own device, pulse regained, but with wide complex rhythym.
Intubated in the field. Self extubated en route to [**Location (un) **].
.
At [**Location (un) **] vitals V paced at 70, BP 140/113 R 17 sat 100% NRB,
had ABG 7.19/32/116 K 5.2 HCO3 12 trop I 0.11, treated with:
lidocaine gtt (which had been stopped prior to arrival to [**Hospital1 **]),
D50, insulin, Ca; He was then medflighted to [**Hospital1 **] for further
management.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 **], vital signs remained stable. ABG 7.27/36/228 K
5.6 lactate 2.6, given D50, insulin, bicarb, Ca, and kayexylate.
K peaked at 6.3, but most recently is 5.0. EKG here shows V
paced rhythym at 82 bpm.
EP interrogated the device.


Past Medical History:
ESRD on HD via L forearm AV graft at [**Location (un) 1157**] North County
Kidney Center
CAD s/p MI '[**78**], tPA and rescue PCI of LAD
EF 20%
LV thrombus
h/o VT
s/p pacer and ICD
recent line sepsis, line pulled, treating with vanco at HD


Social History:
former smoker

Family History:
non-contributory

Brief Hospital Course:
Overnight: Renal came to see patient and felt K was not the
precipitant for these rhythyms. EP interogated his paced and
found several episodes of VT and VF, many of the VT episodes
were below his lower rate threshold to shock (> 188 bpm). His
device was reprogrammed to treat VT at rate > 170 and record
rates >150. There was no inappropriate function of ICD detected.
We increased his toprol from 25 to 50, left his amio at 200
daily, plan for possible EPS in next few days.
.
A/P
42 yo M CAD s/p MI '[**78**], no significant dz on cath in '[**84**], EF
20%, ESRD on HD, presents with V-fib/v-tach arrest with delayed
ICD response.

1. V-tach/v-fib:
Interrogation of the device revealed that the pt had episodes of
V-tach which degenerated into v-fib. The device was found to be
functioning appropriately to the parameters with which it was
programmed. The device was not programmed to detect V-tach so it
only shocked him when it degenerated into v-fib. The EP
consultant changed v tach sensing parameters to detect rates
below 188 and added in anti-tachycardia pacing function. The
device will try ATP twice, then shock. The pt underwent a
prcedure for the generator change of the device. The pt
underwent this procedure without complications. The pt remained
stable without further episodes of arrhythmia during the
hospitalization.
.
2. CHF:
pt currently well compensated. EF 20% by report. Echo was done
at [**Hospital1 18**] to eval cardiac fxn. The coumadin which the pt takes
for mural thrombus and CHF was held for the EP procedure, then
restarted afterwards. The pt was continued on his home
medications.
.
3. Renal failure
Pt was found to be in metabolic acidosis with bicarb 17. K 6.3.
Pt recieved calcium, insulin, bicarb, kayhexelate in ED. He was
dialyzed while in the hospital. The AV graft was not functioning
optimally for dialsis, with elevated pressures and suboptimal
flow, although he was able dialyze. A AV fistulogram was
obtained which revealed venous obstruction. Renal and transplant
surgery teams followed the pt. The pt was informed of the need
to see his regular renal physician for planning to revise the
AVF.
.
4. CAD:
no active ischemia during hospitalization. ASA/statin/BB were
continued
.
5. ID:
being treated for tunneled r IJ line infection. R IJ was pulled
2 weeks ago. Vanco with HD was recommended for an additional
week, because a device was implanted.
.
6. Ppx: heparin when INR <2
.
7. FEN: follow K, renagel 2400, NPO p MN
