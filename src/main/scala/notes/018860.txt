HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83-year-old male with
a complex cardiac past medical history notable for CAD status

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory values significant for a
hematocrit of 31.3, a creatinine of 3.6, and an INR of 3.5.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Congestive heart failure.  The patient was
admitted and immediately started on Natrecor.  The patient
tolerated it well and it was able to be increased over the
next few days.  Lasix was held given elevated creatinine.  On
[**2104-6-25**], dopamine was added at low dose to help better
diurese the patient.  This was continued and the patient
diuresed 1 to 2 kg over the next few days.  The patient was
continued on his beta-blocker and he was also continued on
hydralazine for afterload reduction.  He was not on an ACE
given his creatinine insufficiency.  While the patient had an
intermittent stay in the CCU for rapid atrial tachycardia, on
discharge from the CCU, he was continued on Natrecor with
Lasix boluses and was able to be diuresed further and on
discharge was felt to be at his baseline in terms of dry
weight with improved JVD, though never completely improved
(thought to be secondary to patient's tricuspid
regurgitation).

Rhythm.  The patient had a history of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation, but was in regular sinus rhythm through the
early part of his admission.  He was continued on amiodarone.
Coumadin was given for an INR goal of 2.5 to 3.5, though he
was supratherapeutic on admission and it was initially held.
On [**2104-6-29**], the patient was found by the ninth floor to be
in rapid atrial tachycardia with a heart rate of 120s,
initially thought to be atrial fibrillation.  The patient
also had a 6/10 chest pain, which was nonradiating and was
reported to be different from his anginal pain.  The
patient's blood pressure was 90/60.  His dopamine and
Natrecor were held and Lopressor was given at this time.  His
blood pressure decreased to systolic 80s and high 70s.
Because of the hypotension and rapid atrial rate, which
continued even after the Lopressor, the patient was
transferred to the CCU.  In the CCU, patient was reloaded on
amiodarone although he initially was controlled with an
esmolol gtt and a Neo-Synephrine gtt.  These were quickly
weaned off.  Etiology of the patient's hypotension was
thought to be rate related, also from possible sepsis as the
patient was found to have a UTI.  On discharge from the CCU,
the patient's heart rate was 86 on the amiodarone as well as
metoprolol.

Coronary artery disease.  The patient was without chest pain
until his transfer to the CCU when he did experience chest
pain, which was nonradiating with any minimal exertion.  The
patient was controlled with a nitroglycerin drip in the CCU.
On transfer, this was able to be weaned off and the chest
pain was thought to be related to the patient's fast rate.
In addition, the patient is known to have severe three-vessel
disease, but it was decided that medical management would be
the best way for treating the patient's known coronary artery
disease given his many comorbidities.  The patient agreed to
this plan as well.  After transfer to the floor, the patient
was able to be switched to Imdur for his anginal pain and
really was without further pain on the floor.  He was also
continued on aspirin and Lipitor and a beta-blocker.

Valvular.  The patient has a known St. Jude's valve as well
as severe TR.  His INR was maintained at 2.5 to 3.5, though
he was supratherapeutic at one time.

ID.  The patient was found to have a urinary tract infection
in the CCU, which was probably related to instrumentation.
The urinary tract infection grew Citrobacter and
Enterobacter.  This was sensitive to Levaquin, and he was
continued for a 14-day course.  The patient's Foley catheter
was discharged.

Renal.  The patient's creatinine hovered around the 3s during
his entire admission.  On discharge, when patient was more
euvolemic it was down to 3.0, which was the best it had been
during his hospital course.  This will be followed closely by
the [**Hospital 1902**] Clinic on discharge.  All of his medications were
renal dosed during his hospital course.  The patient has a
known renal cell carcinoma that is seen on CAT scan.  Again,
because of the patient's comorbidities, no surgical or
chemotherapeutic interventions have been planned, and this
will be a watch-and-wait carcinoma.  The patient is aware of
this problem and agrees with the plan.

Heme.  The patient's INR was supratherapeutic during much of
his admission.  The patient required two units of blood on
[**2104-7-3**] for a slowly dropping hematocrit, though the patient
remained guaiac negative.  He was noted, on [**2104-7-3**], to have
some abdominal tenderness and a hard mass in his abdomen.  A
CT without contrast showed a rectus sheath hematoma and this
was thought to be the site of the patient's blood loss.  The
area was monitored and the patient's hematocrit remained
stable for the rest of his hospital course and on discharge
was 31.7, which was his baseline.  The patient was discharged
on a lower dose of Coumadin than he had been on previously.
The patient was restarted on Epogen, which he had been on as
an outpatient for his anemia.  He will be continuing this as
an outpatient.

Access.  On the floor, the patient had peripheral IV access,
but in the CCU, the patient required a right EJ to IJ line.
This was
