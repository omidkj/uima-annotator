Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7055**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain; shortness of breath.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 3142**] is an 85 year-old woman with a history of severe
2-vessel CAD, congestive heart failure and restrictive lung
disease who presents with chest pain and shortness of breath.

Initially presented to an OSH on the evening prior to transfer
where she was noted to be short of breath with clear lungs. CK
was checked and negative with a troponin of 0.14 and BNP of 246.
Second troponin noted to be elevated (6.91) and her O2 sat
decreased to 88% on RA. Lovenox and aspirin was given, along
with IV diltiazem for a HR in the 120s. For possible COPD
exacerbation, she was also given nebs and solumedrol.

Upon presentation to our ED, vitals showed T 98.6, HR 90, BP
108/44, RR 20 and 88% on room air with increase to 94% on 3
liters. Plavix 600mg, lasix 40mg IV were given and she was taken
to the cath lab.

Review of systems: unable to obtain given intubation.

STUDIES:
EKG ([**2140-11-6**]): Sinus tach at 111. 1mm ST-elevations in II/F and
lateral ST-depressions. Inferior q-waves (?old). Anterior
q-waves (old).
EKG #2 ([**2140-11-7**]): Sinus at 92. 1st degree AV block.
ST-elevations less pronounced.
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**2140-9-7**]):
- left atrium is elongated; estimated right atrial pressure is
0-5 mmHg
- mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size (due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded)
- LVEF>55%
- Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg); transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity
imaging are consistent with Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic
dysfunction
- RV chamber size and free wall motion are normal
- AV leaflets are mildly thickened; no AS; trace AR
- MV leaflets are mildly thickened; [**12-9**]+ MR
- TV mildly thickened
- Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension
.
CARDIAC CATH ([**2140-11-7**]):
1- Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system
demonstrated severe three-vessel CAD. Thewhole coronary system
was
mildly calcified. The LMCA had no angiographically-apparent
disease. The
LAD had 90% diffuse lesion at the previous PCI site. The LCX
proximal
stent was patent and the the OM1 (POBA [**2136**]) was 100% occluded.
The RCA
was a dominant vessel and totally occluded proximally (known)
after the
AM1 takeoff. The distal RPDA supplied the inferior wall and
received
faint collaterals from the LAD septal. Most of these collaterals
arose
from the diseased mid LAD segment (also the site of previous
PCI).
2- Limited resting hemodynamic assessment revealed mildly
elevated
arterial pressure (145/75 mmHg).
3- Successful POBA of the mid LAD at teh site of previous PCI
with
marked improvement in flow to the distal LAD and more robust
septal
collaterals to the distal RPDA.
4- Unsuccessful attempt to recanalize totally occluded OM1
proximally.
5- Successful deployment of an angioseal device to the RCFA.
6- Successful endotracheal intubation by the end of the case for

worsened pulmonary edema.

TTE ([**2140-11-7**]):
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the inferior wall and
distal half of the anterior septum. The remaining segments
contract normally (LVEF = 40 %). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-9**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

Renal US ([**2140-11-10**]):
1. No hydronephrosis.
2. Very limited Doppler study due to technical factors which
demonstrates
bilateral arterial and venous blood flow. No further Doppler
characterization can be made.
