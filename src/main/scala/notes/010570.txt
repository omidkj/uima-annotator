Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1148**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation, ART line


History of Present Illness:
63F w/ DMII, HTN, CKD, presented to the ED with pleuritic CP and
lightheadedness that started on the afternoon of [**10-17**]. She
states the pain was in the middle of her chest, radiating
through to her back, intermittent, combination of sharp pain and
pressure. It was associated with some shortness of breath and
mild nausea, and the pain was much worse with deep breathing.
She states the pain progressed throughout the day, and
overnight, she had diaphoresis soaking through her bedclothes.
She states she developed bilateral LE edema and calf pain 4 days
ago. She denies fever/chills, cough, hemoptysis, vomiting,
bloody or black stools, abdominal pain. ROS was positive for 1
episode of loose stool last night.
.
In the ED, her VS on presentation were T 96.9, HR 40, BP 91/40,
RR 25, O2sat 98% RA. She appeared to be in mild respiratory
distress, with clear lungs, regular heart rate, and bilateral LE
edema. ECG showed sinus bradycardia with no concerning ST/T
changes. Her labs showed ARF with a creatinine of 2.3.
Cardiology was consulted for her bradycardia, and it was felt to
be most likely [**2-16**] beta blocker or calcium channel blocker
toxicity, so she was given glucagon 1mg IV x 2 and calcium
gluconate 2g IV, but had no response. Her SBP dropped to mid-80s
and 70s with standing, and she was given 2L NS bolus. Her O2
sats dropped to high 80s on RA, was put on NRB, satting 94-97%.
CXR was clear. Cardiology performed a bedside TTE, which showed
normal biventricular function, normal bubble study, no RV
strain. She was started on IV heparin for empiric treatment for
PE, as a CTA could not be performed due to ARF and iodine
allergy and she was felt to be too unstable for a V/Q scan. She
was admitted to the MICU for further management.
.
On arrival to the MICU, she was complaining of severe L rib/LUQ
pain. Her HR was 40, BP 90s/40s, and O2sat 92-96% on NRB. She
was intubated semi-urgently for hypoxia.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 63F w/ DM, HTN, and CKD presented with chest pain,
bradycardia, hypotension, and hypoxia.
.
While in the ED, she was bradycardic w/ HR 40 and hypotensive w/
BP 91/40. +mild respiratory distress, although clear lungs. ECG
showed sinus bradycardia w/o ST/T changes. Also ARF w/
creatinine of 2.3. Cardiology consulted for bradycardia; felt to
be [**2-16**] beta blocker or calcium channel blocker toxicity. She was
given glucagon 1mg IV x 2 and calcium gluconate 2g IV, but had
no response. SBP dropped to mid-80s and 70s with standing, and
she was given 2L NS bolus. Her O2 sats dropped to high 80s on
RA, was put on NRB, satting 94-97%. CXR clear. Cardiology
performed bedside TTE, which showed normal biventricular
function, normal bubble study, no RV strain. CTA could not be
performed due to ARF and iodine allergy and she was felt to be
too unstable for a V/Q scan. IV heparin started for empiric PE
treatment. She was then admitted to the MICU.
.
On arrival to the MICU, she was complaining of severe L rib/LUQ
pain. Her HR was 40, BP 90s/40s, and O2sat 92-96% on NRB. She
was intubated semi-urgently for hypoxia. BP improved w/ IVF. HR
improved w/ holding CCB and BB. Cause of hypoxia unclear, but
thought to be [**2-16**] to PE given her pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea
and hypoxia. MRA chest done which ruled out central or segmental
PE. Small filling defects seen which could be artifact, but tiny
subsegmental PE could not be ruled out. The MICU team felt this
was unlikely to be cause of her presentation so heparin was
stopped. Patient extubated successfully on [**2197-10-19**]. Patient
found to be hypertensive, so she was restarted on BB and CCB.
Transferred from MICU to the floor.
.
While on medicine wards, the patient was stable without oxygen
supplementation and was ambulatory.  She was kept on telemetry
and was without events.  However, she did have HRs in the
50's-60's.  For this reason, her CCB and BB were held on
occasion and her BP was slightly elevated.  A note of
transaminitis was made in ICU and rechecked on wards that showed
mild improvement. Additionally 2 days prior to discharge patient
had several episodes of hematuria.  Urinalysis showed only RBCs
without signs of infection. Given previous renal failure and
pulmonary distress, there was concern of a renal-pulmonary
syndrome.  For this reason, ANCA and ASO were sent, but were
negative.   The hematuria cleared after one day.  Additionally,
the patient had increasing sore throat on day of discharge.
Cultures were sent and the patient was given an Rx for lidocaine
and instructed to treat symptomatically.  Viral titers were also
sent which were negative.  Cause of sore throat unknown but the
patient did have symptomatic improvement with rx.
