Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
Fall, question of seizure, altered mental status and new
right-sided weakness.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 74 y/o M with a PMH of CAD (s/p MI and CABG in
[**2196**]), CHF, NIDDM, and chronic Afib on coumadin, who presented
to the ED of OSH after being found slumped over in a chair by a
neighbor with slurred speech and question of right sided
twitching. NCHCT at OSH showed new hemorrhage involving left
parasagital posterior frontal lobe. ROS was significant for
recent fall on [**1-3**] when patient slipped on the ice while
walking dog. Denies LOC from that fall, but did require staples
for occipital laceraction. Head CT at that time (per records)
was negative. No URI symptoms, no SOB, no CP. INR at ED was 1.7.
CXR showed bilateral LL opacities and patient received Lasix for
pulm edema. Also received Dilantin 1 gm, Ativan 0.5mg for
seizure prophylaxis. Exam at OSH was notable for right-sided
weakness and confusion. Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management.

Past Medical History:
1. NIDDM - on amaryl, recent HgA1C 6.7,
2. Coronary artery disease status post CABG [**7-19**]

5. Hypercholesterolemia
6. Hypertension - on Metoprolol and Lisinopril

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Neuro: Patient was initially brought to the ICU for
management of intracranial bleed and right sided weakness. A
repeat NCHCT showed no extension of bleed. He received 2 units
of FFP on [**1-8**] and another 2 units on [**1-9**] to correct INR of 2.1
for goal of 1.5-1.7. Since his bleed was stable and since he
will need continued long-term anticoagulation given his risk for
ischemic [**Month/Year (2) **], it was decided not to give vitamin K, but
rather to follow his INR and correct with FFP as needed. On day
of discharge, INR was 1.7. Until [**2198-1-17**] (10 days
post-hemorrhage) goal INR should remain 1.5-1.7 (or less). After
that time, coumadin should be restarted with goal INR 2-2.5.

Additionally, his blood pressure was maintained below 130
systolic to minimize changes of worsenig bleed. His outpatient
medications were used. Lisinopril was increased to 10 mg, but
now that his toprol xl has been increased to his home dose, it
may be necessary to decrease his lisinopril again.

Secondary prevention for future [**Year (4 digits) **] was also assessed.
Cholesterol was excellent (total 152 LDL 74, HDL 62, TG 82), and
lipitor was continued. HgbA1C was 6.7, and his amaryl was
continued, in addition to insulin sliding scale.

He was maintained on Dilantin 100mg PO TID for seizure
prophylaxis given initial presentaion with possible right-sided
shaking, and the cortical location of teh bleed. Has been
therapeutic with level of 15.2 since [**1-9**].

Etiology of bleed unclear, most likely amyloid angiopathy vs
hypertension. He will need repeat CT with contrast in [**5-23**] weeks
to evaluate for any underlying mass or lesion.

2. ID: He was started on 14 day course of Levofloxacin 250 mg PO
QD for possible aspiration pneumonia.

3. Cardiac: He has remained on cardiac telemetry and has had
persistent atrial fibrillation with occasional sustained
tachycardia to 117, exacerbated by dehydration, and requiring NS
fluid boluses. Patient has not received maintanence fluids given
concern for fluid overload due to his baseline CHF. Toprol XL
was increased to home dose of 100mg to improve rate control.

His home dose of lasix for his CHF was held as he had elevated
creatinine and was dehydrated. He has tolerated this well,
though may need to be restarted as outpatient.

4. Renal/GU: In the ICU, he was noted to have decreased urinary
output and a creatinine of 2.2. ICU staff was unable to pass
foley and urology called to perform flex cystoscopy and
placement of foley over guidewire at bedside, and drained 900cc
of urine from bladder. They diagnosed him with bladder neck
contraction. Patient's creatinine has since returned to baseline
at 1.3. Urology recommends that his foley remain in place for 5
days, and then he should have a voiding trial beginning at
midnight.

Serial neurological exams show patient to be oriented to place
and time but with abulic affect and poor attention and recall.
He continues to have spastic hypertonicity in bilateral LEs,
symmetric face, full strength on left and improving strength on
right. At time of discharge, strength on right as follows:
deltoid 3, biceps 5, triceps 4, WE 3, FE 4, FF 5, IP 3, H 4, Q
4, TA 4, G 4, [**Last Name (un) 938**] 3, EDB 3.

Of note, patient's wife died at home on [**2198-1-6**] (day prior to
admission) after prolonged illness and hospice. Patient has
started to express his grief in the last few days, and has been
eating poorly. He would greatly benefit from social work
consultation. In the hospital, he refused pastoral care.

Additionally, patient expressed some desire for DNR status. When
asked he said "I will go join her."  It is currently unclear if
this is a long-standing desire or if this is due to his acute
grief over her death. I do not believe he is currently in the
right frame of mind to think about this objectively, and
therefore he is currently full code. As he gets further away
from her death, this discussion would be more appropriate.
