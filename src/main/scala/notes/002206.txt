Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 398**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation
L subclavian central line
Swan-Ganz catheter

History of Present Illness:
This is a 47 year old man with a history of HTN, DM, possible
NSTEMI but negative cardiac cath in [**11-14**], who presents with 2
days of increasing dyspnea. He felt well until about 2 days ago
when he noticed he was feeling more short of breath,
particularly when walking around his house. That night he was
unable to lie down to sleep, and was awake the whole night. He
normally sleeps on 1 pillow. He also noticed that his feet were
more swollen than usual. He has never had symptoms like this
before at any time. He does not know any of his medications, but
he says he has been taking them with the exception of labetalol
(which he missed "a few days" and lasix missed "1 day" - he did
not take any meds this morning at all). He has been taking his
insulin.
.
He otherwise denies F/C/NS, cough, CP, abd pain, N/V/diarrhea,
constipation, dysuria.
.
In the ED, VS were 99.7, 115, 213/119, 16, 96% (not clear on how
much O2). Eventually, he was recorded as satting mid-90s on 5L
nc. He was briefly tried on BiPAP, but did not tolerate it. He
apparently did not need it, and was put back on nc O2. He was
given aspirin and started on a nitro gtt. He was given lasix
80mg IV to which he put out 1200cc urine. Since his BP was not
yet adequately controlled, he was also given hydralazine 20mg
IV. SBP ranged 150-200 in the ED.

(last use many weeks ago)
# h/o NSTEMI: possible NSTEMI during admission in [**11-14**], but

disease.

Physical Exam:

Gen: Appears comfortable, lying in bed at ~30 degree angle, no
accessory muscle use.
HEENT: L eye with conjunctival injection, R pupil reactive

enough), MMM, OP clear
Neck: JVP 9-10cm

.
[**3-23**] CXR: 1. New perihilar haziness likely due to pulmonary
edema given clinical suspicion for CHF. Differential diagnosis
includes viral and PCP pneumonia as well as lung disease due to
sarcoid.
2. Longstanding symmetrical bilateral hilar and mediastinal
lymphadenopathy highly suggestive of sarcoidosis.
.
[**3-24**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 11-15mmHg. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
focal hypokinesis of the basal inferior wall and entire
inferolateral wall. There is normal systolic function of the
remaining segments. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a small (0.5cm) pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2143-11-19**],
the findings  are similar.
.
[**3-26**] CT Chest: 1. Large bilateral consolidative changes within
the posterior lungs. Aspiration and/or pneumonia are considered.
2. Large bilateral pleural effusions.
3. At least small amount of ascites, partially imaged.
4. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
5. Multiple lung nodules.
6. Multiple tubes and lines as described.
.
[**3-26**] CT head:
Profound diffuse cerebral edema, with near complete effacement
of the fourth ventricle, supracellar and basal cisterns,
indicative of downward transtentorial herniation.
.
[**3-26**] TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low
normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to hypokinesis of the inferior and
posterior walls. There is no ventricular septal defect. The
right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function is borderline normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2144-3-24**], no major change is evident.
.
[**3-27**] EEG:
This EEG demonstrated a severe diffuse encephalopathy with no
clear cerebral electrical activity. No clear EKG, pulse, and
movement artifacts were noted throughout the recording as
described above.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 47 year old man with DM, HTN, sarcoid, CKD, clean
coronaries on cath in [**11-14**], who p/w dyspnea consistent with CHF
exacerbation.
.
He initially responded well to lasix and improved rapidly from
his apparent CHF exacerbation.  This CHF exacerbation had
occurred in the setting of severe hypertension, which was
initially controlled with ntg gtt.  He was given his usual PO
medications and ntg gtt was titrated off.  BP was decreased from
210/110 -> 160s/70s over the course of the night.  Patient was
comfortable on minimal O2 by morning.  TTE showed EF 40-50%, no
significant change from prior. BNP was elevated at 9000.  EKG
was unchanged from baseline, and the patient ruled out for MI.
