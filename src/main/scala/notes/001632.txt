Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1561**]
Chief Complaint:
post pneumonectomy syndrome

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**6-2**]-airway stents removed by IP
[**6-3**]- trach placed

History of Present Illness:
42 yr old woman with hx of right pneumonectomy in [**2107**] for stage
IIb adenocarcinoma c/b post op chronic dyspnea with multiple
acute L PNA episodes (post pneumonectomy syndrome) transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital **] Hospital, GA for IP evaluation s/p failure
of L sided stenting procedure.

In [**Month (only) 956**] of this year, the patient was taken to the OR for
postpneumonectomy syndrome, where she underwent repeat R
thoracotomy, LOA, pericardial implantation , breast
implantation. Postoperatively, she was unable to wean from the
vent and underwent tracheostomy after one week. She had
continued difficulty weaning of the trach, and bronchoscopy
revealed severe tracheomalacia, with almost complete obstruction
throughout the airway due to anterior movement of the posterior
membrane and collapse of root of trachea. She was also noted to
have L mainstem with severe malacia. An custom made14x6mm L
stent was planned, but this broke, and in [**2111-4-6**] a 14x5mm L
stent was placed under rigid bronchoscopy. She was extubated
successfuly. Prior to discharge, a flexible bronchoscoy noted
significant granulation tissue at the distal portion of the
stent, but this was noted not to be obstructive. Upon discharge
she did well for ~ 1 month, whern she had repeat episode of
respiratory distress. At this time, the [**Last Name (un) 2435**] was removed, and a
dual lumen L sided ETT placed in the OR. On [**2111-5-21**], the patient
returned to the OR for replacement of the orginial L sided
stent. This was overlapped with a 14X5cm polyflex (distal
overlap 3cm). ON POD#4, she developed heavy secretions requiring
intubation of stent. She had been weaned to a successful SBT
(600-700cc Vt), but was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further IP
evaluation.

Pertinent Results:

Imaging:
[**2111-5-30**] CXR - Right hemithorax is nearly uniformly opacified
except for air at the base. This could represent an expander in
the right hemithorax. Tracheobronchial stent extends from the
subglottic trachea to left main bronchus, approximately 15 mm
beyond the carina. Left lung is well expanded. Mediastinum is
shifted mildly to the right of midline.

CT airways: Tracheal and bronchial stents are patent and free of
complications, aside from minimal ingrowth in the bronchial
portion. Stented central airway is normal calibre.
Post-pneumonectomy mediastinum midline. Right intrathoracic
spacers.  Mild left lung aspiration and/or pneumonia. Lower lobe
lesion should be followed to confirm that it is inflammatory

[**2111-5-31**] CT Abd:
1. Marked pneumoperitoneum with extensive loculations. This
likely is consistent with recent surgical intervention (J-tube)
as well as peritoneal adhesions.
2. Pericolonic fat stranding in the region of the ascending and
proximal transverse colon. This is nonspecific but could be
related to an inflammatory process though diverticuli are not
visualized. Perforation cannot be excluded.
3. Peripancreatic lymphadenopathy. Further evaluation is limited
on this non-contrast scan.
4. Cystic structure in the pelvisd ma represent hydrosalpinx
versus peritoneal inclusion cyst within the pelvis.

[**2111-5-31**] Abd U/S:
1. Patient is status post cholecystectomy. No intrahepatic
biliary ductal dilatation.
2. Diffusely echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration.
Other forms of liver disease, and more advanced liver disease
including hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this
study.
3. No ascites.

[**2111-6-3**] CT Abd:
1. Interval decrease in the amount of loculated intraabdominal
free air, consistent with recent jejunal tube placement.
2. Interval decrease in the degree of inflammatory fat stranding
surrounding the hepatic flexure of the colon.
3. Unchanged fullness within the region of the pancreatic head.
Unchanged low- density structure anterior to the uncinate of the
pancreas. Evaluation of these structures is limited due to the
lack of intravenous contrast enhancement.
4. Bilateral cystic structures within the pelvis which may
represent bilateral hydrosalpinx versus loculated pelvic free
fluid.
5. Status post right pneumonectomy with fluid filled cavity at
the right lung base and subsegmental airspace opacification at
the left lung base, which may represent atelectasis versus
consolidation.
6. Left lung base nodular density and atelectasis, stable.

[**2111-6-10**] ECHO - Suboptimal views. There is probably a small
pericardial effusion. Left ventricular systolic function appears
grossly preserved. Valves could not be adequately assessed.

[**2111-6-17**] CXR - No change in mediastinal position since [**6-9**],
lower mediastinum midline, trachea deviated to the right. No air
in the right pneumonectomy space. Left lung fully expanded and
clear. Tracheostomy tube in standard placement. Tip of the left
subclavian line projects over the SVC.  Redundant lucencies
projecting over the trachea and the right paramedian lower chest
could be small gas collections in the mediastinum. If there is
clinical concern about mediastinal infection, CT scanning
employing esophageal contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**], would be required.

[**2111-6-25**] ECHO -  Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size,
and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal.  No evidence of endocarditis
seen.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS  [**2111-7-3**] 2:01 PM
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
42 year old woman with s/p pneumectomy now tachycardia,
tachypnea
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o PE
INDICATION: Status post pneumonectomy, now tachycardia and
tachypnea, rule out PE.

COMPARISON: [**2111-5-31**].

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast and contrast-enhanced axial CT imaging
of the chest with multiplanar reformats was reviewed.

CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: The patient is status post right
pneumonectomy with two saline implant devices in the right
thorax. There is unchanged elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
The pulmonary arteries opacify without filling defects. The
heart and great vessels in the mediastinum are unremarkable.
Multiple small and non-pathologically enlarged mediastinal lymph
nodes are identified.

There is near total collapse of the distal trachea,
approximately 4 cm distal to the tip of the endotracheal tube.
At its most narrow margin, there is only a 4-mm patency of the
left main stem bronchus. The left lung is inflated adequately,
and a patchy ill-defined opacity at the left base is unchanged.
There is a small left pleural effusion and associated
atelectasis. Central venous catheter terminates in the
cavoatrial junction. The visualized portions of the abdomen are
unremarkable. The patient is status post cholecystectomy.

IMPRESSION: Near total collapse of the distal trachea and left
main stem bronchus with only 4-mm patency at its most narrow
margin. The left lu
