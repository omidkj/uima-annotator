History of Present Illness:
67-year-old female with hepatic cirrhosis secondary to PSC
presents with neutropenia of unknown etiology. She is being
admitted for work-up of neutropenia not responsive to neupogen
on [**5-4**] and [**5-5**]. No fever. On evaluation, she is alert and
oriented to person and place but not to time completely. She
also has reported 5 bowel movements a day on lactulose.

She was recently admitted from [**2167-4-22**] to [**2167-5-2**] on the
[**Year/Month/Day **] surgery service in the SICU for hypotension for fall,
hypotension requiring pressors and fluid resuscitation,
hypothermia, bradycardia. Her hypotension was felt be due to
dehydration from extensive diarrhea with the whole clinical
picture likely suggestive of sepsis as the main case. She was
started on empiric antibiotics including vancomycin, zosyn, and
flagyl in addition to PO vancomycin for presumed C. diff. GI
source was explored with abdominal CT indicative of increased
rectal and pan-colonic wall thickening since [**2167-1-31**] suggestive
of colitis either infectious or inflammatory. Urine culture from
[**4-22**] had ESBL E. coli sensitive to meropenum, which was started
on [**4-22**]. Sputum culture on [**4-22**] isolated ESBL E. coli with
meropenem continued (14 day total course, [**4-22**] - [**5-5**]) . She
was also on IV flagyl. ID was consulted with impression of ESBL
E. coli colonizing the respiratory/GU tract with evidence of
toxemia and bacteremia. There was no clear etiology with no
intrabdominal source on noncontrast CT of abdomen.

She also had diarrhea for which she was to complete a 2 week
course with PO vancomycin ([**4-27**] - [**2167-5-10**]) empirically for C.
diff.

Brief Hospital Course:
67-year-old female with hepatic cirrhosis secondary to PSC
presented with neutropenia likely multi-factorial that resolved.
Hospital course complicated by volume overload refractory to
hepatorenal therapy and diuretics and requiring hemodialysis
with ultrafiltration.

#. Neutropenia
Patient had ANC below 100 prior to admission with admission ANC
of 300. Her ANC climbed to 3770 on [**2167-5-11**]. Hematology
impression was likely multifactorial with baseline pancytopenia
related to liver disease and antibiotic effect. Following
completion of her ESBL UTI treatment her ANC returned to >1000
and remained there throughout her hospitalization.

# Renal Failure
Her creatinine was 1.2 on admission elevated from baseline ~ 0.8
secondary to diarrhea and poor PO intake. Subsequently developed
hepatorenal syndrome with ineffective fluid excretion requiring
initiation of hemodialysis with ultrafiltration on [**2167-5-22**]. At
the time of initiating therapy she had 50 liters of excess
volume and required ultrafiltration of 3-5L daily. A
hemodialysis holiday was tried on [**5-31**] - [**6-1**] with evidence of
continued significant renal impairment requiring ongoing HD/UF
therapy. She received a tunneled HD catheter and continued HD/UF
until [**6-5**]. Creatinine was improved as was volume status. She
is discharged on 80 mg PO Lasix [**Hospital1 **] until re-evaluation in
clinic.

#. PSC complicated by cirrhosis with jaundice, ascites, and
encephalopathy. She is on the [**Hospital1 **] list with a MELD of 41.
During hospital course, she was AAOx3 with no asterixis. She was
continued on rifaximin, ursodiol, lactulose, mesalamine. Patient
had marked jaundice, increased MELD score from prior
hospitalization and was transplanted on [**2167-5-31**].

# Asthma
She had signs of active symptoms or evidence of exacerbation.
She was continued on albuterol and advair.

# Prior ESBL E. Coli cystitis
Patient had prior infection. Urine culture again showing ESBL
organisms ranging from 10,000 - 100,000. She remained afebrile
and without urinary symptoms.

# CAD s/p NSTEMI with PCI to LX with BMS ([**2-10**])
CK index of 21% in setting of sepsis and PCI to LX with BMS with
3 x 22 mm Integretti stent in [**2167-1-31**]. She had 3-month
plavix course. She was continued on ASA 81 at rehab and
atorvastatin is on hold until clinic.

# Psoriasis
She was continued on clobetasol

#.  Cholangitis prophylaxis
She was continued on ciprofloxacin.

#. L-spine fractures from last hospitalization
Neurosurgery consulted during last hospitalization. She was
placed on vitamin D and calcium. She should follow-up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in 8 weeks with CT L-spine
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 1669**] to schedule)
**********
Patient received orthotopic liver [**Telephone/Fax (1) **] on [**2167-5-31**]. She
was taken to the OR by Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 816**] who performed a Liver
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. The patient had
no initial complications and was transferred to the ICU in
stable condition.
Approximately 12 hours after the initial surgery was completed,
although initially stable, she dev
