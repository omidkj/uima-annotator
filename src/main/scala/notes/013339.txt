Patient's HbA1c was 7 in [**Month (only) **] and has not had a previous
admission w/ hyperglycemia and does not have a formal diagnosis
of DM.

Pt was given 3L NS, morphine 4mg X 2 and was started on insulin
10 meq/hr gtt in the ED.

Per his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **], who talked to him over the phone
yesterday, "We had deferred steroids given side effect profile,
but probably cannot do that anymore. See my telephone note from
last night; has some serositis, fatigue. If this is not renal
failure and indeed a flare of his myositis/serositis, we may
have to give him pulse methylprednisolone, would consult with
[**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name 1667**] his outpatient rheumatologist. His outpt therapy is
hydroxychloroqine and myfortic (though myfortic he has not been
able to tolerate b/c of GI sx, may be related to current flare).

Brief Hospital Course:
37m k/c of SLE, CKD, HTN, s/p MI X 2, and impaired glucose
intolerance presenting with hyperglycemia.

#Hyperosmotic hyperglycemic state + IDDM:
  On presentation was hypovolemic with anion gap acidosis and
grossly elevated glucose but no urine ketones indicating HHS,
not DKA.  After starting insulin gtt, his gap closed and
metabolic derrangements improved.  Although he did not have
previous dx of DM, has numerous risk factors for diabetes and
was recently on prednisone, which likely contributed to acute
exacerbation.  In [**2114-4-20**], pt's A1C was 7.1 and on admission
it was >14 indicating that he has been diabetic for at least
three months.  Pt required very large doses of insulin to
control blood glucose and he was eventually stabilized on
humalog and lantus regimen.  Pt understood how to administer
insulin and how to use humalog sliding scale.  He was taught how
to use his home glucometer and will follow up in [**Hospital **] clinic
in two weeks time.  At time of [**Hospital **] islet cell antibody was
pending. Glutamic acid decarboxylase was checked and was normal.

.
#SLE flare:
Pt was worked up for SLE flare at time of admission.  His CK
elevated and ESR, CRP and C4 were mildly elevated. Rheumatology
was consulted and it was determined that he was not having an
SLE flare.  He was continued on his home chloroquine and
prednisone was discharged in setting of hyperglycemia.
.
#CKD: Patient's baseline Cr is 1.5-2.5.  On admission Cr was at
baseline and remained at baseline until his diuretics were
restarted.  He diuresed 4 liters in 1 day and creatinine rose to
3.3.  Diuretics were temporarily stopped due to [**Last Name (un) **] and his
creatinine improved to baseline at time of [**Last Name (un) **].
Metolazone was discontinued and he was restarted on
spironolactone 100mg [**Hospital1 **] and his torsemide was decreased to 60mg
daily at time of [**Hospital1 **].
.
#Gout: Pt's colchicine was held in setting of [**Last Name (un) **].  Febuxostat
was continued at time of [**Last Name (un) **].
.
#CAD: Patient continued to recieve aspririn, isosorbide
dinatrate, and carvedilol.
