CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 66-year-old gentleman,
status post multiple lung resections for tumor. On [**2151-6-29**], the patient underwent a mediastinoscopy and therapeutic
bronchoscopy and was found to have this large right upper
lobe mass abutting the mediastinum and right main pulmonary
artery. Biopsy proved this to be a mixed tumor, mostly small
lung cell cancer, however, some features of small cell lung
cancer. He had had a failed attempt with chemotherapy and
radiotherapy and had decided to proceed with a resection.

PRIOR MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Known coronary artery disease.
2. Known lung cancer.
3. Peptic ulcer disease.
4. Home oxygen requirement.


MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1. Advair.
2. Combivent.
3. Ativan.
4. Prevacid.
5. Effexor.
6. Ambien.


BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2151-6-29**], the patient
underwent a purportedly uneventful right upper and middle
lobectomy without complication. He was kept intubated
overnight in the PACU and sedated, planned for extubation in
the morning.

By the afternoon of postoperative day #1, the patient had
been extubated, however, had a persistent inotrope support
requirement. He was changed to ICU status and transferred to
the intensive care unit.

By postoperative day #3, the patient was comfortable,
however, remained extremely disoriented. There was some
question of whether his disorientation was secondary to
alcoholic withdrawal or was secondary to his respiratory
distress.

Through postoperative day #4 and postoperative day #5, the
patient's agitation continued to worsen. On the morning of
[**2151-7-4**], the patient was found to have increased work of
breathing and deterioration in his mental status. Again, it
was unclear if this was secondary to his respiratory failure
or advanced signs of delirium tremens.

Per family wishes, and after consultation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] on
the morning of postoperative day #5, the patient was
successfully intubated. Several attempts were made at weaning
sedation and vent management, but the patient became
increasingly agitated and had difficulty breathing during
each of these events.

On [**2151-7-6**], the patient became hypotensive and dyspneic.
A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed, showing a high output
picture consistent with sepsis. The patient was started on
vancomycin, Zosyn, and Xigris. This septic picture continued
to evolve throughout the course of the day with final blood
gas of 7.15, 64, 24, -7. At that time, the patient's family
had become increasingly vocal regarding their wishes to
withdraw the patient's care. After several discussions,
including the patient's wife, 2 daughters, and a grandson,
decision was made to withdraw and make the patient comfort
measures only.

At approximately 2:30 in the morning on [**2151-7-8**], the
patient's drips, including Xigris, vasopressin and Levophed
were all discontinued. The ventilator, likewise, was stopped.
The patient expired shortly thereafter.

The medical examiner declined the case. The family likewise
declined autopsy.
