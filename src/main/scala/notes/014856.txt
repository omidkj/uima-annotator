Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Increased somnolence

Bronchoscopy, central line placement, PICC placement


History of Present Illness:
53 year old male with severe COPD, remote L CVA (residual R
sided weakness), DM, hypercarbic respiratory failure,
chronically vented was sent to ED because of worsening
somnolence and hypotension.

Pt usually gets his care at [**Hospital1 112**]/BU but was just recently at
[**Hospital1 18**] for VAP. He has been intubated at the beginning of [**Month (only) 359**]
[**2140**], reportedly at [**Hospital3 **] for hypercarbic respiratory
failure in setting of severe COPD. Before that he has been O2
dependent due to severe COPD, living at a NH. At the OSH, he was
found to have a RML and RLL collapse and paratracaheal LAD as
well as chronic right pleural effusions. He also has
questionable old granulomatous lung disease with calcified hilar
LAD. He eventually required trach/PEG because of difficulties
weaning from the vent. He reportedly had a bronchoscopy done
ruling out malignancy. He was at rehab (Radius [**Hospital 4094**]
Hospital) since [**11-9**]. He has been doing better until the middle
of [**Month (only) **], when he was on CPAP transiently. However, since the
end of [**Month (only) **], his respiratory status worsened again and he
remained on AC. He was treated for VAP in [**Month (only) 1096**] here due to
pseudomonas ESBL. Since then he was back at rehab and was weaned
successfully.

The day of admission, he underwent a T-piece trial and then was
found to be unresponsive on the floor. The circumstances are
unclear and oral report from the [**Name (NI) **] included tonic-clonic
movements, while another report does not confirm that. The
patient was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.

In the ED, his VS were 97.9, 110, 80/46, RR 20, 98% on unclear
settings. A CT head and spine were unremarkable. A CXR showed
chronich RLL collapse but then subsequently after a R subclavian
line placement showed almost complete R sided white-out with a
[**Last Name (un) **] off at the R mainstem bronchus. The patient was given Abx,
Vanco, Levo, Cefepime and he received a total 5L NS. He
persisted to be hypotensive and was started on Levophed.

On arrival to the ICU, his BP was 96/70 and HR 117. He was only
complaining of mild R foot pain but did not recall and injury to
the foot. He reports that he had a seizure, but denies any
complete LOC. He denies any CP, abd pain, HA, vision changes,
f,c,ns, dysuria, problems breathing or worsening secretions.

Right lung base opacity could be a combination of pleural fluid
