Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5547**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 76 y.o. man with a history of CAD and
prostate cancer who presented to an OSH ER with hematemesis and
BRBPR on the day before [**Hospital1 18**] admission. He underwent EGD which
showed only gastritis and some "trauma" to the esophagus but no
ulcers, MWT or Dieulafoy.
Subsequent colonoscopy was notable for a dusky appearing colon
to
the hepatic flexure. There were no ICU beds at the OSH and he
was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work-up. 3 months prior the
patient had a
single episode of upper abdominal cramping that radiated to the
lower abdomen with associated vomiting of bilious material. The
pain was relieved by multiple bowel movements about 30
minutes later which were initially formed thenloose. He had a
similar episode last month which again subsided after he passed
a loose but non-bloody stool. About 8 days ago he developed low
back pain radiating down his left leg which his PCP diagnosed as
sciatica. He was prescribed Flexeril, OxyContin and
Ibuprofen which he has been taking at least 3 times a day for
the last 3 days. Yesterday, he developed the same upper
abdominal pain for the third time and proceeded to vomit 9 times
followed by 3 episodes of small volume hematemesis.

Past Medical History:
CAD s/p MI
History of TIA
HTN
Prostate cancer

Pertinent Results:
CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  [**2119-1-2**] 5:16 AM
1. Acute colitis spanning from the mid transverse colon to the
proximal sigmoid. Given this distribution, ischemic colitic is
the most likely etiology though the mesenteric vasculature is
patent. Recommend clinical correlation.
2. Emphysema.
3. Right adrenal adenoma.
4. Cystic lesion in the subcutaneous tissues of the mid-back,
likely a a sebacious cyst.

Echo:[**2119-1-3**] at 09:54
IMPRESSION: Symmetric LVH with mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.

ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)  [**2119-1-5**] 11:18 AM
No evidence of small-bowel obstruction.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2119-1-7**] 11:34 AM
FINDINGS: There are bilateral pleural effusions, best seen on
the lateral film. These are probably increased compared to the
film from the prior day. The PICC line is unchanged. There is
increased opacity at the right base that could represent an
early infiltrate versus volume loss
