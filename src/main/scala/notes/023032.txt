Weakness

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 14696**] is a 58 year old male with a PMH significant for HTN,
HLD, DM 2, and 40+ pack year smoking history admitted for
weakness found to have lung and brain masses. The patient
reports that he was in his usual state of health until 1 day
prior to admission, at which point he had acute onset of
weakness while walking with his wife. [**Name (NI) **] describes this an an
inability to stay standing last for several minutes, after which
he felt unsteady but was able to walk home independently. Per
the patient's wife, he did not exhibit any difficulty with
walking or gait imbalance. He denies any vertigo, headache,
lightheadedness, dysarthria, vision changes, tinnitus, CP/SOB,
or nausea. This morning, the patient reports that while walking
his dogs he experienced a similar episode requiring him to sit
down. After approximately 5-10 minutes, he was able to walk back
home. Over the course of the day, the patient felt fatigued and
stayed in bed, and this evening the patient was brought to [**Hospital1 18**]
by his family for further evaluation.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, intial VS 95.8 62 138/84 16 100%RA. The patient
was had a CXR that demonsrated a right perihilar spiculated
mass, and a CTH that demonstrated extensive left parietal lobe
vasogenic edema. The patient was seen by Neurology and
Neurosurgery, with the recommendation for MRI, and he was
admitted to Medicine for further management.
.
Currently, the patient is resting comfortably. States that he
has a [**1-6**] right sided headache described as right temple
pressure. Denies weight loss, night sweats, hematochezia/melena,
cough, hemoptysis, dysuria, hematuria, N/V/D, abd pain. ROS is
notable for several months of fatigue, unchanged dyspnea on
exertion, and a stutter that is worse than baseline over the
past several months.

MRI Head PRE OP: IMPRESSION:
1. Heterogeneous enhancing lesions in the left parasagittal
parieto-occipital lobe and the left cerebellum, with
susceptibility artifacts and extensive left parietal parenchymal
edema. The constellation of findings is compatible with
hemorrhagic brain metastasis with vasogenic edema. In the
clinical context of a spiculated pulmonary mass, this is highly
suggestive of squamous cell carcinoma metastasis with
hemorrhagic components.
2. No hydrocephalus or significant midline shift.

CT torso: IMPRESSION:
1. Right lower lobe mass consistent with primary bronchogenic
neoplasm. Lymphadenopathy is identified in the ipsilateral hilum
and the subcarina. Equivocal lymph nodes are identified in the
contralateral mediastinum.
2. No evidence of hepatic metastases. A tiny right adrenal
nodule is too small to characterize.

CT Head [**5-9**](Post-op); expected post-operative changes.

MRI Head [**5-9**](Post-op):1. Post-surgical changes, with hemorrhage
in the resection cavity, but no definite evidence of residual or
recurrent neoplasm.
2. Small punctate focus of decreased diffusion in the posterior
left parietal lobe, and deep to the resection cavity, may
represent a tiny infarct versus cytotoxic edema.
3. Stable enhancement and intrinsic T1 hyperintense foci in the
left
cerebellar hemisphere, also likely representing metastatic
disease, and
unchanged since the prior study.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 14696**] is a 58 year old male with a PMH significant for HTN,
HLD, DM 2, and 40+ pack year smoking history admitted for
weakness found to have lung and brain masses.
.
# Weakness: Almost definitely due to malignancy and brain
masses. Given the patient's significant tobacco/smoking history,
right perihilar mass concerning for primary lung neoplasm,
specifically squamous cell lung cancer, with brain metastasis,
although cannot rule out another primary at this time. Chief
complaint of weakness in the setting of subtle neurologic
findings as detailed by Neurology also concerning in setting of
left parietal vasogenic edema. He was started on dexamethasone
4mg IV Q6H and got Q4H neuro checks.  Given his history of a
Dilantin as a child, he was started on Keppra for seizure
prophylaxis.  His neurologic exam remained stable, but given the
size of the brain mass, he was taken by neurosurgery for
surgical resection [**2182-5-8**].
.
# DM 2: His Glipizide and Actos/Metformin forumulation were
held.  He was covered with a Humalog sliding scale QACHS.
.
# COPD: Respiratory status stable without hypoxemia. He was
initially on an ipratropium inhaler QID, but was then changed
back to his home tiotropium daily. Did not require an albuterol
rescue.
.
# Learning disability/anger management: He was continued on his
Risperdal.  After speaking with the patient and his outpatient
case manager, it was felt that he was competent to make his own
medical decisions.  He was able to articulate understanding of
the need for surgery and the potential risks involved.  He
signed papers to have his uncle, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 14696**], as his health care
proxy.

On [**5-8**], Mr. [**Known lastname 14696**] was transferred from the medicine team, to
neurosurgery team following open craniotomy for resection of
brain mass. He was taken to the ICU for frequent neurological
examinations and systolic blood pressure control. He was kept in
the ICU until the morning of [**5-10**], when he was transferred to
the
