hernia.

MAJOR INVASIVE PROCEDURES:  Diaphragmatic hernia repair.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 41 year-old male who
had a motor vehicle accident in [**2198-3-21**] with a coma. He
had a left chest tube placed and was seen to have a right
wrist fracture. He had a long course in the hospital which
was complicated by intubated resulting in tracheal stenosis.
He also had a left diaphragmatic hernia and was discharged
home on [**2198-10-21**] and was readmitted for nausea and
vomiting. He was admitted to an outside hospital with this
condition and then transferred here to the [**Hospital1 346**] for the management of tragal
stenosis and treatment of his hernia repair.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Notable for asthma, OSA, obesity,
hypoventilation syndrome and diabetes x2, morbid obesity,
peripheral neuropathy, hyperlipidemia, depression. Patient
was status post tracheostomy x2, gastrostomy tube and
inferior vena cava filter placement.

MEDICATIONS:  The patient is on Pepcid 20 b.i.d.,

p.r.n., Haldol 0.5 IV q 4, Dilaudid 1 dose IV q 4, Ativan x1
IV q 2, Phenergan, Advil and albuterol. The patient was
taking all these medications in his rehab facility.

He lives alone in a rehab facility in [**State 2748**].

FAMILY HISTORY:  Denies any family history in his family.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Remarkable for shortness of breath.
Everything else is within normal limits.

The patient was admitted on [**2198-12-4**] and was
admitted to the thoracic surgery service under Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**]. He
was initially started on total parenteral nutrition the next
day after admission. Interventional pulmonology was consulted
on the [**2198-12-5**] for a bronchoscopy to be done to
assess the patient's trachea. It did notice tracheal stenosis
with mild supraglottic edema. The larynx was normal and
showed normal vocal cords. He had mild tracheal stenosis 2 cm
below the vocal cords which involved the cricoid and the
first tracheal ring. After performing the bronchoscopy and
consulting with interventional pulmonology it was felt that
patient should undergo repair of his diaphragmatic hernia
which was done. An x-ray was more of a priority during this
admission because of his tracheal stenosis. Patient was pre-
opped on the [**12-6**]. He was started on his total
parenteral nutrition. On the 17th the patient was taken to
the OR for left diaphragmatic hernia repair with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**]. Patient tolerated the procedure
well without any major postoperative complications or any
intraoperative complications. He was typed and crossed for 2
units and consent was obtained. Chest x-ray preoperatively
was clear with no cardiopulmonary disease. There was
diaphragmatic hernia which was notable. In the OR the patient
was placed under general anesthesia. He had 1 liter of output
and had 3500 cc of Crystalloid with about 100 cc of estimated
blood loss. A left chest tube was placed into the patient's
thorax. A chest x-ray was obtained immediately
postoperatively which showed atelectasis at the base of the
left lung which increased slightly. Basal pleural drain was
in place. The right lung was clear. His cardiomediastinal
silhouette was the same as preoperatively. There was tracheal
narrowing noted and the nasogastric tube was also placed. It
was passed into the stomach. The patient had no pneumothorax
postoperatively. On the 21st the patient was then placed on
water seal and again there was no pneumothorax. A left sided
PICC was placed with the tip in the superior vena cava but
the mediastinal and hilar contours remained stable. An x-ray
was again obtained on [**12-12**] which again showed a
moderate size loculated left anterior hydropneumothorax and
smaller posterior pleural air and fluid collection which
remained unchanged. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouette
was also noted. After this the patient had his chest tube
remained on [**12-12**]. A post pull chest x-ray was obtained
which showed slight pneumothorax on the left chest. The
following day on the 23nd the patient underwent another chest
x-ray which showed no significant interval change. There was
a mid right pneumothorax which was unchanged in size and
morphology. However, the right lung remained clear. The
patient had no complaints of shortness of breath, abdominal
pain, nausea, vomiting or dyspnea on exertion throughout his
hospital course and immediately postoperatively. The patient
did well and on the [**12-13**] his PICC was removed as
we did not feel that he needed any intravenous antibiotic or
IV hydration for an extensive period of time. A peripheral
was placed. Total parenteral nutrition was also discontinued
on the [**12-12**]. Patient was started on a regular
diet which he tolerated well.

Patient is being discharge in stable and healthy condition.
He is ambulating with his walker. He is afebrile. His vital
signs are stable. He is making good urine. He is ambulating
and voiding appropriately and he had 1 bowel movement prior
to discharge. Patient was instructed. He is to follow up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] in 2 to 3 weeks for evaluation and postoperative
assessment. He was told that if was to get increased nausea
or vomiting he was to come to the emergency room along with
any temperature greater than 101.5, any increased pain, any
increased abdominal distention that may occur, any chest pain
or shortness of breath that he may experience. Patient is
also to be discharged on pain medications and instructed to
not drive or operate heavy machinery. He is also told not to
lift more than 10 pound object at any one time as this can
cause pressure along his incisions in the skin. Again patient
is being discharged in good condition without any significant
issues.

LABORATORY DATA:  He did not require any transfusions during
his hospital course. His hematocrit remained in the 33.2 to
38.8 requiring no transfusions. His white count remained
within normal limits except for the postoperative period on
postoperative day 0 when it was 15.2 immediately
postoperative. Cultures were obtained on this patient. Urine
culture which was notable on the 15th showed pseudomonas
enterococcus. The patient was then placed on vancomycin and
Zosyn for the treatment of this urinary tract infection. On
the 21st another culture was obtained which showed
contamination. Blood cultures from the 22nd and [**12-13**] also pending. The catheter tip from the PICC line
was also sent for culture and is pending. Sputum shows
greater than 25 polynuclear neutrophils and greater than 10
epithelial cells by 100x field. There was noted to be
contamination of the upper respiratory secretions.
