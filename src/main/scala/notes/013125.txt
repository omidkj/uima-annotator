presented to [**Hospital 4199**] hospital with throat pain, painful
swallowing and feeling like his throat was closing. He has been
having this problem for the past 7 days or so and was being
treated nystatin and fluconazole for thrush. He has been having
difficulty handling his own secretions and now upper lip
swelling for past 24hours. Evaluated at OSH ED and felt to be
stridorous. He was given methylprednisolone, magic mouthwash,
ativan at outside hospital. This improved his symptoms but still
having mouth and chest discomfort. He had a CT scan of the neck
at OSH showing esophagitis but not read as having laryngeal
edema.  He was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] given concern for airway
obstruction.  VS prior to transfer: Tmax of 101.1, Tcurrent
98.9, 88, 122/73, 98% 4L NC

Patient was given viscous lidocaine, benadryl, methylprednsinone
125mg, famotidine, zofran, oxycodone liquid, ativan, scopolamine
patch, and maalox.
.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], feels that throat pain and swallowing improved and
no SOB. No stridor on exam. The OSH CT neck was reviewed with
radiology here who also felt that no evidence of laryngeal edema
but did note esophagitis. He was continued on methylprednisone
with plan for five day course. He was given fluconazole IV given
difficulty taking PO for the esophagitis. He also reported new
cough, sputum production and given that had been febrile (OSH
ED?) was emperically started on antibiotics (cefepime, vanc,
azithro) for HCAP. Of note he was treated in [**Month (only) 956**] for
pneumonia at [**Hospital1 2025**]. He also reported unilateral leg pain. LE u/s
was obtained which showed non-obstructive thrombus in peroneal
vein. He was started on heparin IV. Of note, radiology evaluated
CT neck there was question of recanulated thrombus in pulmonary
vasculature on right.  He is transferred out of [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] given
clinical improvement. Vitals are afebrile today, 99.1 85  96/56

Brief Hospital Course:
67M with PMH metastatic prostate ca presented initially to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for concern over airway swelling in the setting of recent
radiation.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

#CONCERN FOR LARYNGEAL EDEMA: Patient reported throat closing
and initial exam with concern for stridor but over the first
forty-eight hours symptoms improved and not stridorous on exam,
CT without evidence of laryngeal edema.

Radiation induced edema considered, angioedema considered as
patient on [**Last Name (un) **].

- Pt was initially treated overnight in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with IV
methylprednisolone
- After transfer to the floor, his steroid regimen was switched
to PO prednisone and then tapered to off by [**3-4**]
- Difficulty with handling secretions thought to be more related
to oropharyngeal candidiasis combined with likely radiation
mucositis
.
#ESOPHAGITIS / MUCOSITIS: Patient with throat pain with
swallowing with evidence on imaging of esopagitis. Exam with
white patches on oropharyx concerning for [**Female First Name (un) **]. Suspect
radiation induced esophagitis, [**Female First Name (un) **] esophagitis or likely
both

- pt was placed on fluconazole and treated symptomatically with
liquid pain relief and maalox
-advanced diet to soft mechanical, well tolerated with over 1.5L
of intake for each of the two days leading up to his discharge

#PERONEAL VEIN THROMBOSIS: Patient reporting leg pain and
swelling found to have non-occlusive distal vein thrombosis.
Given hypercoagulability secondary to cancer and symptomatic
plan to treat for 3months.  Initially treated with heparin gtt,
and sent out on fragmin shots (ease of once daily dosing).
.
#PRODUCTIVE COUGH: Patient with fever to 101.1 in the OSH
emergency department also with productive cough for several days
concerning for pneumonia.

- No infiltrate seen on CXR
- Given recent hospitalization, thought reasonable to treat for
HCAP
- Initially treated with IV vanc/cefepime and then transitioned
to oral levaquin for a course of 8 days
- viral swab cultures negative.

#METASTATIC PROSTATE CANCER: PSA increasing on anti-androgen
therapy over past several months, concern that becoming
refractory
- outpt zometa will be discussed, deferred to outpt Atrius
oncologist
