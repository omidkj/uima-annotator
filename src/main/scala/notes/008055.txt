HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77 year old
gentleman with a history of hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, heavy smoking, who presented on
[**2107-7-17**], to [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency
Department with two weeks of exertional chest pressure,
shortness of breath, fatigue and light-headedness.  The
patient had no prior history of cardiac problems.  His
symptoms got progressively worse over two weeks.  He stated
that he felt dizzy, had headaches at times and became
diaphoretic which is unusual for him.  He saw his primary
care physician [**Name Initial (PRE) **] few days prior to admission and had an
electrocardiogram done which showed third degree block and
bradycardia after which he presented to [**Hospital1 190**] Emergency Department.

with some speech impairment completely resolved.
2.  Prostate cancer in [**2122**], treated with radiation, followed
with PSA level recently normal.
3.  Compound fracture, below the knee amputation of right
foot.
4.  Hypertension.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Status post below the knee amputation, trauma.
2.  Status post cholecystectomy.
3.  Status post appendectomy.

ALLERGIES: Gadolinium (sneezing/cough).

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Triamterene/Hydrochlorothiazide one capsule p.o. once
daily.
2.  Atorvastatin 20 mg p.o. once daily.
3.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. once daily.
4.  Hydrocortisone cream p.r.n.
5.  Warfarin 2 mg p.o. once daily.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is a pleasant cooperative
male in no acute distress.  Vital signs revealed blood
pressure 146/79, pulse 75, respiratory rate 14, temperature
97.4, oxygen saturation 95% in room air.  Chest revealed some
crackles heard in the lung bases bilaterally.  Cardiovascular
revealed no jugular venous distention, no lift, III/IV
holosystolic murmur loudest at the apex.  Pulses irregularly
irregular bilaterally.  The abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Extremities are warm and well perfused.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count 8.0,
hematocrit 41.7, platelet count 234,000. Sodium 139,
potassium 3.7, chloride 103, bicarbonate 24, blood urea
nitrogen 19, creatinine 1.2, blood sugar 108, CK 69.
Prothrombin time 18.4, partial thromboplastin time 32.4, INR
2.4.

Electrocardiogram revealed a heart rate of 40 beats per
minute, bradycardia, third degree AV block, P wave
independent of QRS, AV node pacing, normal axis, slight ST
depression in precordial leads.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to Medicine
service with Electrophysiology service consulted.  Due to the
patient's presentation, it was recommended that an
echocardiogram, coronary catheterization would be performed
to evaluate the patient's problems.  The patient's Coumadin
was discontinued.  He was given Vitamin K and was transfused
four units of fresh frozen plasma.

On hospital day number two, the patient had a temporary
pacemaker placement.  The procedure went without
complications.  The base rate was set at 50 beats per minute.
On hospital day number three, the patient reports feeling
much better than he has for the past couple of months.

On hospital day number five, the patient underwent coronary
peripheral catheterization which showed severe aortic
stenosis, left main coronary artery distal 30% stenosis, left
anterior descending mid 80% at S1, D1, 40 to 50% stenosis,
left circumflex proximal 50% stenosis, OM mild stenosis,
right coronary artery ostial 60% with pressure dampening.
Mid ulcerated 60% diffuse disease distally.

On hospital day number one, echocardiogram was performed
which showed an ejection fraction of 60 to 65%, severe aortic
stenosis, mild aortic insufficiency.

Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted and it was recommended
that the patient undergo coronary artery bypass graft
procedure with aortic valve replacement.  The patient
underwent duplex ultrasound of the carotids precardiac
procedure which showed no significant stenosis bilaterally.

The patient was taken to the operating room on [**2127-7-23**],
where coronary artery bypass graft times two (left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending, saphenous vein
graft to posterior descending artery) was performed with
aortic valve replacement (#21 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical valve).
Wires chest and mediastinal tubes were placed.  The procedure
went without complications and the patient was transferred to
Post Anesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.

On postoperative day number one, the patient was stable, was
successfully extubated.  His chest tubes were left in place.
He was transferred to regular floor.  Overnight on
postoperative day number two, the patient developed severe
abdominal pain, most intense in the right upper quadrant.
Nasogastric tube was placed.  General surgery was consulted
which recommended continuing nasogastric tube and NPO and
intravenous fluids and serial abdominal examinations along
with blood chemistries for the patient.

Later that day, the patient developed respiratory distress
and was transferred back to CSRU.  On postoperative day
number three, the patient was on Levaquin.  His chest tube
had a leak.  The patient had extensive pulmonary toilet.
Right femoral venous triple lumen catheter was inserted for
intravenous access.

Postoperative day number four, the patient was stable,
however, had extensive cough, rales and rhonchi on
respiratory examination.  He had frequent Albuterol nebulizer
treatments.  His ventricular pace was increased to 80 to
increase capture.  The patient's systolic blood pressure
remained 120 and stable.  The patient was started on Milk of
Magnesia and Dulcolax for bowel movement.

On postoperative day number fine, the patient had a bowel
movement and his diet was slowly advanced.  His respiratory
status improved and he was changed from 50% face down to six
liters nasal cannula.

On postoperative day number five, the patient continued on
Levaquin, Vancomycin and Heparin drip.  His Coumadin was
discontinued for permanent pacemaker placement.  The patient
remained stable. Pulmonary toilet was performed.

On postoperative day number six, PICC line was placed.  Line
was removed.  The patient's diet was further advanced.
General surgery conclusion for patient was that abdominal
issue was not very likely in this patient and is probably
most likely due to his respiratory distress.

On postoperative day number seven, the patient remained
stable and was transferred to the regular floor in stable
condition.  While on the floor, the patient remained stable.
His permanent pacemaker placement was delayed for a few days
due to the patient's increased white blood cell count.  On
postoperative day number nine, the patient's chest tube was
removed without complications.

On postoperative day number twelve, the patient had permanent
pacemaker placed.  The procedure went without complications.
The patient ambulates with physical therapy without any
problems.  On postoperative day number thirteen, he was
started on Coumadin.  His Heparin was continued until the
goal INR could be reached (2.5 to 3.5).  The patient is
stable with no active issues.
