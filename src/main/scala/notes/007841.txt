Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 11605**] is a 80yo male with PMH as listed above presents with
acute dyspnea.

1)Respiratory distress: Patient presented with acute onset
dyspnea. Combination of new onset afib w/RVR likely causing him
to flash and productive cough suggestive of an underlying
pneumonia. Also has component of CHF w/EF~35%. He was initally
started on Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin for presumed pneumonia
but was changed to Levofloxacin which he should continue for the
next 10 days. He also received PRN nebulizer treatments with
rapid improvement in his respiratory status. He was continued on
home regimen of Lasix 20mg PO with appropriate diuresis. Patient
may require 1-2L supplemental oxygen.

2)CHF: Patient has history of systolic CHF with depressed
EF~35%. Likely contributed to acute respiratory decompensation.
He was seen by cardiology on admission and recommended diuresis.
Close to euvolemic at time of discharge and diuresing
appropriately on current regimen of Lasix with close monitoring
of his I/O's. He was continued on Lasix, beta-blocker, and
ace-inhibitor.

3)Atrial fibrillation: Patient has history of aflutter s/p
ablation. On admission found to be in AF w/RVR but converted
back to NSR but now back in AF. Likely caused him to flash
resulting in his acute respiratory distress. Coumadin was
initially held given supratherapeutic INR but then restarted at
time of discharge. INR on discharge is 1.7. Patient discharged
on Coumadin 4mg and titrated up if necessary to keep INR between
[**2-27**]. He was also continued on Amiodarone 200mg [**Hospital1 **].
