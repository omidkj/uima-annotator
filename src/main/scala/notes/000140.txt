History of Present Illness:
80 yo female with pmh of DM and htn who was admitted with CP on
[**12-25**]. The day prior to admisssion she had substernal CP,
diaphroesis which occured for a few minutes. The next morning
she had a repeat episode also with HA (which she has when her BP
increases with anxiety. In the ED her BP was 232/95 upon
presentation. She stated she had taken her BP meds. She was
given lopressor. Head CT was negative. Her HA improved. Her EKG
showed NSR in the 90s with no ST segment changes, however her
Trop was 1.8. She was started on a nitro gtt, heparin gtt, and
given ASA.
.
She was taken to cath today where she complained of chest pain.
She became acutely anxious and agitated. Her SBP increased to
the 240's with her LVEDP in the 30's even when given TNG 200
mcg/min IVD, furosemide 20 mg IV, 6 mg total of morphine,
midazolam IV, labetalol IV bolus, nitroprusside IV infusion, and
amlodipine 10 mg po. As the procdure continued she began
complaining of SOB and worsening chest pain so the procedure was
stopped. Her renal arteries where not visualized
angiographically. Her SBP eventually fell to the 150s.
.
Here she is confused and only occasionally will answer
questions. She does admit to continued chest pain, but denies
shortness of breath.

FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses,
mass effect or
infarction. The ventricles and sulci are normal in caliber and
configuration.
No acute fractures are identified. There is hyperostosis
frontalis. The
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.

IMPRESSION: No evidence for intracranial hemorrhage.

COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
2 vessel obstructive coronary artery disease. There were dual
ostia
giving rise to the LD and LCX. The LAD had a tubular 65%
stenosis in the
proximal portion just before D1. The distal LAD wrapped around
the apex.
The LCX had a 95% subtotal occlusion in the AV groove segment
immediately after OM1, which was a tortuous vessel. The [**Month/Day (2) 11641**]
had a hazy
proximal 70% stenosis followed by a mid 75% stenosis. The RCA
tapered in
the proximal to mid portion suggestive of moederated disease
with
diffuse plaquing througout. There was a large very tortuous AM
and RPL.
2. Limited resting hemodyanmics demonstrated severe systemic
systolic
arterial hypertension with a SBP >200mm Hg. There was evidence
of
diastolic heart failure with an elevated LVEDP of 23. There was
no
transaortic valvular gradient on careful pullback of the
catheter from
the left ventricle to the aorta.
3. The patient became progressively uncomfortable, dysnpneic and

agitated during the procedure, which was terminatned. Renal
angiography
was planned but not attempted.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Multivessel coronary artery disease involving LAD, [**Month/Day (2) 11641**], AV
groove
CX, with diffuse disease in the RCA.
2. Mild to moderate LV diastolic heart failure.
3. Severe systemic arterial hypertension.

[**12-27**] C Cath
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography showed 2-vessel coronary
artery
disease.  The LAD had a proximal tubular 70% stenosis.  The LCx
had a
high OM1 with proximal and mid 60-70% stenoses.  There was a 90%

stenosis in the distal AV groove LCx that was of small caliber.
The RCA
was not injected.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderate systemic
arterial
systolic hypertension with a central aortic pressure of 175/75
mmHg.
3. Successful direct stenting was performed in the proximal LAD
using a
3.0x23mm Vision bare-metal stent.  This was post-dilated using a
3.0mm
NC [**Male First Name (un) **] balloon.  Interim angiography showed normal flow, no
apparent
dissection, and no residual stenosis.
4. Successful PTCA was performed in the distal LCx using a
2.0x15mm
Voyager balloon.  Final angiography showed normal flow, no
apparent
dissection, and a 40% residual stenosis.
5. The right femoral arteriotomy was successfully closed using a
Mynx
device.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate systemic arterial systolic hypertension.
3. Placement of a bare-metal stent in the proximal LAD.
4. PTCA of the distal LCx.

[**12-27**] Echo
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Diastolic function could
not be assessed. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2139-12-4**],
the degree of mitral regurgitation has increased. Diastolic
function cannot be determined on the current study. The other
findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
80 yo female with pmh of htn and DM admitted with an [**Hospital 7792**]
transferred to the CCU after an attempted cath due to a
hypertensive emergency secondary to anxiety and agitation.

She was taken to cath on [**12-25**] where she complained of chest
pain.  She became acutely anxious and agitated.  Her SBP
increased to the 240's with her LVEDP in the 30's even when
given TNG 200 mcg/min IVD, furosemide 20 mg IV, 6 mg total of
morphine, midazolam IV, labetalol IV bolus, nitroprusside IV
infusion, and amlodipine 10 mg po. As the procdure continued she
began complaining of SOB and worsening chest pain so the
procedure was stopped.  Her SBP eventually fell to the 150s when
she was transferred to the CCU on a nitrogylcerin and
nitroprusside drip.

The two drips were weaned off overnight.  Her CP resolved as her
anxiety and agitation decreased.  The heparin gtt was held given
her recently elevated SBP due to the risk of hemorrahage.  She
had elevated BS in the 430's which remained elevated after 6
units of humalog x2, so she was started on an insulin gtt until
the morning when she was weaned off and given 4 units of lantus
and covered with SSI.  She was delirious overnight and was given
5 mg of zyprexa x2 and 2.5 mg iv haldol x1 for agitation and
required restraints to avoid her from climbing out of bed and
pulling ou
