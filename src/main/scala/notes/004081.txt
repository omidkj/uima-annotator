pain 2 days ago.  She does not recall her last passing of flatus
or stool, but believes she did not have a bowel movement in the
last 24 hours.  Her last colonoscopy was two years ago, and
negative.  Denies fevers or chills.

DIAGNOSIS:
[**Numeric Identifier **], cecum, cecectomy:
- Unremarkable [**Numeric Identifier 499**].
- Unremarkable small intestine.
- One unremarkable lymph node.

[**2197-6-13**] EKG:
Normal sinus rhythm. RSR' pattern in leads V1-V2 with QRS
duration
of 78 milliseconds. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2197-3-7**]
no
diagnostic interval change.

[**2197-6-14**] CT ABD:
IMPRESSION:
1. Cecum appears to be flipped and is in the left upper
abdominal quadrant
concerning for cecal volvulus in appropriate clinical setting.
Surgical
consult recommended.
2. Diverticulosis with no evidence of diverticulitis.
3. Left adrenal nodule, incompletely characterized. MRI
recommended in a
nonurgent setting.
4. Gallbladder fundal thickening, likely adenomyomatosis.
5. Calcified fibroid uterus.
[**2197-6-15**] Chest CTA:
IMPRESSION:
1. New bilateral small- to moderate-sized pleural effusions with
interlobular thickening suggest a degree of volume overload. In
addition, area of bronchial plugging involving the right lower
lobe with nonspecific
consolidation that could relate to atelectasis and aspiration,
though early pneumonia is not excluded.
2. Severe emphysema.
3. No evidence of pulmonary embolism to the subsegmental levels.

[**2197-6-15**] EKG:
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response at
approximately 150.
Borderline low voltage. Delayed precordial R wave progression,
possibly normal variant. Non-specific repolarization
abnormalities. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2197-6-15**] sinus
tachycardia at a rate of 115 has given way to atrial
fibrillation at a rate of 150.
[**2197-6-17**]: CHEST XRAY:
Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Small bilateral pleural
effusions
larger on the left side are unchanged. The component of the
pulmonary edema has resolved. Persistent, unchanged opacities in
the left lower lobe and lingula are consistent with infectious
process. It is unchanged though from prior study.

Brief Hospital Course:
General Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service for
evaluation and treatment.  On [**2197-6-14**], the patient underwent
cecectomy, which went well without complication (reader referred
to the Operative Note for details). After a brief, uneventful
stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor NPO, on IV
fluids and antibiotics, with a foley catheter, and epidural
analgesia for pain control.  The patient was hemodynamically
stable.
Neuro: The patient received  Dilaudid PCA with good effect and
adequate pain control.  When tolerating oral intake, the patient
was transitioned to oral pain medications. Patient continue to
take 2-6 mg Dilaudid PO.
CV: Patient was stable from cardiac standpoint after surgery,
with RRR and occasional  sinus tachycardia. On [**6-18**] patient
developed an onset of rapid a-fib with HR up to 150s. Patient
was started on IV Metoprolol, and she was reversed to regular
rhythm. After been transitioned to PO Lopressor on [**6-19**], patient
had several episodes of sinus tachycardia, which was resolved
with IV Lopressor. Since [**2197-6-19**] the patient remained stable
from a ca
