# Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial including LLL PNA,
COPD exacerbation, and CHF.  Intubated; succesfully extubated
[**2157-1-16**] after made DNR/DNI
- Consulted neurology for ?myopathy vs. neuropathy in effort to
understand inability to wean.  Neurology service does not
believe exam consistent with myositis/nerve process/myasthenia
but cannot exclude steroid myopathy.   Successfully extubated
[**2157-1-16**]
- Continue prednisone taper for COPD; patient failed attempt to
wean from 40 mg to 5 mg (fast taper preferred in setting of
concern re steroid myopathy), becoming hypotensive.  Currenttly
on 30mg qd.  Will be discharged on slow taper to goal of 10mg qd
- initially treated w/ CTX and Azithro for CAP, continue
vancomycin for sputum +MRSA for a total of 14d course.  Last day
[**2158-1-22**]
-diuresed well with lasix 40 mg IV qAM, transitioned to 40mg po
qAM on discharge
.
# Sepsis likely secondary to PNA.  Received 4 liters of NS in
ED.
- Received 4 liters of NS in ED.
- transiently hypotensive when titrating steroids quickly, but
has been normotensive on slow taper
- continued vancomycin as above, dosed per level given her
improving renal function
.
# CKD.  Creat improved to better than baseline during admission.
 attempted low dose linsinopril dose, but failed [**2-10**] Cr bump
(see below)
.
# CAD/CHF: s/p stent [**5-13**].  initially held statin as may have
contributed to myopathy/weakness, but CK wnl, so we restarted
it.  We continued ASA, B- blocker and started ACE-I at low dose
2d prior to discharge, but her Cr bumped from 1.4 to 1.8, so it
was discontinued
.
# PAF: not coumadin candidate given h/o falls and diverticular
bleeds. Currently in sinus. Continue ASA.  Was in sinus during
her stay here.  She was discharged on the same metorprolol dose
she was on prior to admission
.
# Hypothyroidism:
-TSH on [**2158-1-10**] low at 0.055, initially levothyroxine was
decreased from 88 mcg daily to 50 mcg daily. However, this was
in context acute illness and other labs c/w sick euthyroid, so
thyroid replacement was returned to standard dose prior to
discharge
.
# FEN:
-speech and swallow evaluation, initially failed [**2-10**] somnolence
and cough s/p extubation, but was reevaluated and was cleared to
take regular foods and thin liquids with as tolerated.
