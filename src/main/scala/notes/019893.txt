History of Present Illness:
HPI: Ms. [**Known lastname 95152**] is an 87 y.o. F with recent STEMI in
mid-[**Month (only) **] and then in [**2109-9-5**], HTN, s/p CVA, CHF with
EF 25%, and atrial fibrillation, admitted for shortness of
breath. In mid-[**2109-8-6**], the patient had been admitted to
[**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] for AMS and found to have a UTI and STEMI. At that
time, family decided against intervention for STEMI. She was
treated wtih abx for her UTI and sicharged back to NH on
[**2109-8-30**]. She was then transferred from [**Location (un) 620**] to [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2109-9-6**] for cold purple R leg and EKG with ST elevations in
V3-V5 with positive troponins. She was placed on heparin gtt
after discussion with family. Vascular surgery was consulted who
believed that there was not a reasonable intervention, given
that the patient would likely require amputation even if flow
was restored, which family declined. Heparin gtt was continued
until day of discharge. Per d/c summary, agreed that pt be
transitioned to hospice care and transferred back to nursing
facility with goals of comfort / pain control and no escalation
of care. Pt also noted to have bacteremia (coag negative staph),
likely from ischemic leg, and family did not want escalation of
care. No abx or cultures continued. Patient was discharged
[**2109-9-9**] to NH.

Brief Hospital Course:
This hospital course summary is a modified version of recent d/c
summary from [**2109-9-9**]. Only differences are that she was formally
made Comfort measures only. She was readmitted on [**2109-9-9**] for
acute shortness of breath, requiring HR control and diuresis in
the ICU. She is now comfortable and made CMO. If there is a
recurrence of SOB, tachycardia, hypotension, fevers, etc., she
will not return to the hospital as per discussion with family.
She is being sent to [**Location (un) **] with hospice care.
------------------

87 yo F with signifcant PVD, DM, HTN, recent STEMI without
intervention [**1-7**] family preference who presented to [**Location (un) 620**] with

ischemic right leg and STEMI 2 weeks ago, transferred here for
further management x 2. This admission focused on acute SOB [**1-7**]
systolic CHF exacerbation and family requested diuresis for
further comfort. She has now been made comfort care only and
will not receive any further interventions. This has been
discussed extensively with family with help of paliative care
team.
.
#. Ischemic Right Leg: Known severe PCD, presented to [**Location (un) 620**]
with cold, purple leg. Vascular Surgery saw the patient here and

they did not feel there is a reasonable intervention, given that

the patient would likely require amputation even if flow was
restored, which family does not want. Family did request that
heparin be continued during her stay at [**Hospital1 18**], despite extremely

miniscule chance that heparin would restore any flow. She had no

improvement over the course of her stay, and the drip was
stopped on [**2109-9-9**], the day of her initial discharge.  The
family is
well aware of her poor prognosis, and the fact that she will
likely become septic from her ischemic leg. It was agreed that
the patient be transitioned to hospice care and transferred back

to nursing facility with goals of comfort/pain control and no
escalation of care. She received IV dilaudid inhouse (allergy to

morphine- pruiritis). Patient should receive concentrated
oxycodone for pain control every three hours for pain.


#. History of STEMI: Patient with ST elevations in anterior
distrubution on EKG, residual from STEMI 2 weeks prior to
admission. 2 weeks ago, patient had no intervention, as per
family request. Family would like patient to be managed
conservatively. They understand the many complications s/p such
a massive MI and that she may pass away from acute arrhythmia at

any time.

.
#. Atrial Fibrillation: Patient was in AF with RVR at [**Location (un) 620**].
Had been on dilt drip and was unable to take home beta blocker
given inability to take PO ([**1-7**] mental status). Agreed that
medications be minimized and that no further medications be
given for rate control.
.
# Bacteremia: Patient with 2/2 bottles coag negative staph and
leukocytosis. Possibly element of bacteremia from ischemic leg.
Patient has been afebrile. Family wants no escalation of care.
No antibiotics or continued cultures.
.
#. Chronic Systolic CHF: EF 25%. Was diuresed during
hospitalization.
Patient comfortable on 2L oxygen now. No further diuresis for
SOB.
Should be given oxycodone for any discomfort.
.
#. Diabetes: Insulin sliding scale was held during hospital
course to minimize overall finger sticks and increase comfort.
She does not need finger sticks or medications on discharge.
.
#. HTN: SBP's 120-140's while inhouse. Goal bp 110-130 given
STEMI and did not want to decrease cardiac perfusion.  Patient
discharged on home dose of beta blocker.
.
# Altered Mental Status: Likely toxic metabolic encephalopathy
in setting of STEMI and ischemic leg. Per family, patient had
UTI 2 weeks ago and was not herself at that time and has not
returned to her baseline. CT head at [**Location (un) 620**] was without acute
bleed. Of note, patient has h/o ICH while on coumadin per
family. Family had expressed understanding of risks and benefits
of
starting heparin for ischemic leg, and wanted to continue it
inhouse. On initial admission, patient with decerebrate
posturing. No
changes on neuro exam upon discharge, although neuro exam
extremely difficult as patient is nonverbal and does not follow
commands even with Russian interpreter.

.
#. H/O CVA: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 620**] d/c summary on [**8-30**], new stroke was
identified - left posterior/ occipital stroke. [**2106**] R MCA
stroke. Neurology evaluation at [**Location (un) 620**] during prior
hospitalization stated
