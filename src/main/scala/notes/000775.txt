Chief Complaint:
Gastrointestinal bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right Internal Jugular central line placement and removal

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 916**] is a 66 year old man with DM, CAD, s/p recent STEMI,
Ischemic cardiomyopathy LEVF 25%, errosive gastritis, and colon
polyps who is admitted from [**Hospital **] rehabilitation for 1 week of
black stool, and a slow hct drop. According to the report HCT
trend: 30 ([**5-15**]) -> 27 ([**5-19**])->22 today and he was transferred
to the emergency department.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T: not recorded, P:92 BP:120/69
RR:28 Sa02:100% FiO2: 40%. He subsequently spiked to T:102.6.
Labs were remarkable for HCT 20.9, WBC 6.7 83.2% Lactate 2.4, Cr
1.5, UA positive. Patient was given Vanc/zosyn, pantoprazole
drip and 80mg bolus, and a RIJ was placed, GI was consulted who
recommended non-urgent scope, and to continue pantoprazole 40mg
IV BID vs drip. Not transfused in the ED. VS prior to transfer:
T99.8 HR 84 122/67 22 on vent 100% AC 450x12 Peep 5 fi02 50%
.
On arrival to the ICU, T:99.9 BP: P:84 R: 18 O2:100% AC 450x12
50% FiO2. He reported that his breathing is comfortable, denies
chest pain. He complained of pain at the site of his saccral
decubitis.
.
Review of sytems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills. Denied shortness of breath. Denied
chest pain or tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting.

.
Of note patient was hospitalized recently in the MICU [**Date range (1) 29015**].
He was admitted for STEMI, urosepsis and hypotension. STEMI was
medically managed with heparin, plavix, asa, statin, ECHO showed
newly depressed EF to 25% with wide LV hypokinesis. He grew VRE
from blood and urine and was treated with daptomycin, meropenem
and linezolid. He was intubated for increased work of breathing
and treated for heart failure and VAP however the MICU team was
unable wean him off of the vent, he is s/p trach and PEG.
Hospital course was also complicated by pulseless VT x4 managed
with synchronized cardioversion and amiodarone. Goals of care at
end of hospital course were DNR, do not escalate care

IMAGING:
[**5-20**] CXR
1. Interval placement of right internal jugular central venous
catheter
terminating in the proximal to mid SVC, without evidence of
pneumothorax.
2. Bilateral layering pleural effusions, increased, with
overlying
atelectasis, underlying consolidation not excluded. Additional
peripheral
right upper lobe patchy opacity may be due to additional site of
infection
and/or aspiration. Pulmonary edema. Cardiomegaly.
.
[**5-21**] TTE
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30
%) secondary to akinesis of the inferior and posterior walls,
and hypokinesis of the interventricular septum. Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Severe (4+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. [In the setting
of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be
underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.] There
is a small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic
signs of tamponade. Compared with the findings of the prior
study (images reviewed) of [**2131-4-9**], there has been marked
progression of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation (both of the
functional ischemic classification) consistent with the natural
history of this patient's recently documented untreated
extensive inferior posterior and right ventricular myocardial
infarction.
