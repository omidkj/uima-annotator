[**2131-6-14**] 12:08PM Digoxin-0.8*

Transvaginal ultrasound [**2131-6-13**]
1.  Fibroid uterus. Allowing for differences in technique, no
significant interval change in size of multiple fibroids.
2. Relatively normal appearance of the endometrium. Please note,
the LMP is unknown.


Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, this is a 42 female with [**Last Name (un) 22989**] ataxia/Musc
Dystrophy, cardiomyopathy with EF 20%, afib/flutter s/p DC
cardioversion on coumadin with uterine fibroids and menorrhagia
in setting of elevated INR who was transferred to the CCU for
bradycardia and hypotension.

Bradycardia/afib: Patient has tachy-brady syndrome and had long
pause in setting of digoxin/amiodarone/carvedilol use and
hypokalemia.   However, she has had no recent change in
medications.  She was transferred to the CCU and a temporary
wire was placed.  Responded well to brief peripheral dopamine
and atropine.  Now appears to be in sinus rhytm/afib and has
fluctuated as an outpatient despite cardioversion.
All medications were held and patient underwent
electrophysiology study with permanent pacemaker placement for
her tachy-brady syndrome.  Amiodarone dosage was decreased to
200mg daily and carvedilol 6.25 TID continued.  Patient was
continued on coumadin 2mg and set up for INR follow up.

Hypotension: Likely related to acute bradycardia.  Admission
hypotension likely related to blood loss.  Responded well to
IVF.  Hypotension resolved after IVF and rate control was
acheived.

CHF/Cardiomyopathy: EF 20% per last TTE.  Followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**].
Related to underlying muscular dystrophy.  No current signs of
decompensation.  Digoxin and ACE were held in setting of
bradycardia and hypotension.  Home lasix of 80mg po daily and
digoxin 0.125mg were continued.

Menorrhagia/Fibroids: Related to fibroids given vaginal U/S.
Nothing to suggest abnormal uterine bleeding per GYN.  Hct
stablized slightly below her baseline.  INR corrected with
FFP/Vit K.  Uterine bleeding resolved during hospital stay.
Patient was instructed to follow up with GYN as an outpatient
for further management of her uterine fibroids.

[**Last Name (un) 22989**] Ataxia: Currently stable.  Pt is wheelchair bound.
Outpatient regimen of pain control and muscle relaxants was
tailored on this admission.  Tizanadine was discontinued due to
its interaction with amiodarone.  Amiodarone causes decreased
clearance of tizanadine and increases the sedative effects.
Patient instructed to discuss use of tizanadine with PCP.

Diabetes Type I: Secondary to Friedreichs Ataxia.  Patient was
contined on home doses of NPH with RISS, QID fingersticks.

Hypothyroidism: Continued home dose Levoxyl.  TSH elevated, may
be amiodarone related as Free T4 was normal.

Depression: Continued on home Lexapro dosage.
