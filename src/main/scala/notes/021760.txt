History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 50946**] is a 48 year old woman with a history of depression,
anxiety, bipolar, and hypertension. She is currently intubated
and unable to provide additional history. Per medical records
she was found by VNA on [**2171-6-4**] to be altered. She has VNA to
deliver her psychiatric medications. The VNA thought the patient
may have taken extra klonopin. Narcan was tried without effect.
EMS was called and the patient was transfered to OSH for altered
mental status. At OSH ED, she was noted to be hypoxic in 80's
and altered. Tmax was 101.7. Therefore, she was intubated. A CT
head showed frontal parietal lesion, concerning for a mass. CXR
was concerning for fluid overload vs. pneumonia. She was given
lasix, ceftriaxone 2g, vancomycin, and azithromycin. Labs were
notable for negative tox screen, BNP 705, WBC 23.5, Hct 36.5, 11
bands. She was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED a head CT was repeated. Differential included
low grade neoplasm, a subacute infarct, encephalitis or another
inflammatory process, or tumefactive demyelination. An LP was
performed. which had 1 WBC, protein 28, glucose 97, 86% lymphs,
15% monos.  Neurology was consulted. They recommended acyclovir
and an MRI. Initial lactate was 3.5 which trended down to 1.8
after 4 L IVF. An initial u/a showed positive nitrites. She was
noted to have movements of all four extremities L>R.

3. Imaging/diagnostics:
- CT head ([**2171-6-5**]):
Left frontal cortically based lesion, as detailed above.
Diagnostic
considerations include a low grade neoplasm, a subacute infarct,
encephalitis or another inflammatory process (though location is
atypical), and tumefactive demyelination (such as MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]).
MRI with and without contrast is recommended.

- MRA/MRV brain ([**2171-6-5**]):
1. Large left MCA territory infarction, predominantly involving
the cortex
and the subcortical white matter with possible scattered small
punctate foci of petechial hemorrhage. The basal ganglia is not
involved. There is minimal mass effect upon the involved sulci
without mass effect upon the ventricular system or shift of
midline structures.
2. There is extensive paranasal sinus disease with air-fluid
levels within
the ethmoid, maxillary and sphenoid sinuses.
3. The MRA of the head demonstrates complete loss of flow signal
within the left ICA with collateral flow to the supraclinoid
left ICA, MCA and ACA, which is less in flow intensity compared
with the contralateral side, which is likely an result of
contralateral collateral flow. The left MCA is apparently
globally smaller in caliber than the contralateral side, also
likely a result of contralateral flow. No evidence of focal
stenosis to suggest vasculitis, although CTA is more sensitive
and can be performed if clinically warranted.
4. The intracranial left vertebral artery is not well seen. In
correlation
with the CTA of the head and neck (performed at the time of this

interpritation) the vessel appears hypoplastic although
occlusion can not be excluded.
5. Normal MRV.

- CTA head/neck ([**2171-6-6**]):
1. Occlusion of distal segment I through segment VI of left
internal carotid artery, with reconstitution of segment VII.
Cause is unclear; MRA neck w/ T1 Fat/Sat recommended if there is
concern for dissection.
2. Left MCA smaller in size and number of branches than right,
consistent
with known left MCA large area of CVA.
3. Left vertebral artery hypoplastic; V4 segment does not
opacify.
4. No evidence for vasculitis.

- MRA neck ([**2171-6-10**]):
1. Smooth narrowing and tapering of the left proximal ICA with
narrowing of the middle and distal segments, with intracranial
reconstitution suggesting chronic non occlusive dissection or
partial recanalisation.
2. Diminished flow-related enhancement of the left V3 vertebral
segment as
seen on the CT study.

- CT head ([**2171-6-8**]):
1. Expected evolution of large left MCA territory infarct with
increased mass effect. While the left midbrain is slightly
crowded, there is no uncal herniation.
2. Mild hemorrhagic transformation of the left MCA territory
infarction.
3. Fluid in the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells, likely
due to
endotracheal and nasogastric intubation.

- CT head ([**2171-6-11**]):
1. Expected evolution of large left MCA territorial infarct,
with stable 3-mm rightward shift of normally-midline structures
and no central herniation.
2. New subtle foci of hyperdensity within the superior portion
of the
infarcted territory; small focal hemorrhagic transformation is a

consideration.

- CXR ([**2171-6-13**]):
Endotracheal tube has been removed. Nasogastric tube remains in
place, terminating below the diaphragm. Cardiac silhouette
remains enlarged and is accompanied by mediastinal vascular
widening. The latter has progressed since the previous study of
earlier the same date, and is
accompanied by worsening perihilar and basilar airspace
opacities. Findings likely reflect worsening pulmonary edema.
Considering the marked increase in size of the cardiac
silhouette compared to a baseline radiograph of [**2170-6-23**],
pericardial effusion should be considered.

- Echocardiogram ([**2171-6-5**]):
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate to
severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with with
focal hypokinesis of the distal 2/3s of the left ventricle. .
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global
free wall hypokinesis. The number of aortic valve leaflets
cannot be determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Focal left ventricular
dysfunction involving the mid and distal left ventricular
segments, likely of non-coronary etiology
(stress-mediated/Takotsubo's, myocarditis, etc..). Cannot
exclude large LAD wraparound territory ischemia/infarction. Mild
right ventricular dilation and systolic dysfunction.

- Echocardiogram ([**2171-6-11**]):
This is an echo contrast study. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal (spetal thinning from infarct). The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with anterior, septal, distal
LV and apical hypokinesis to akin
