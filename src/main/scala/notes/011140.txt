Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1363**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, delirium


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
71 y/o M with NSCLC, hep C, COPD, and remote etoh/IVD/tobacco
abuse who was brought to the ED from his rehab center for
agitation, in the setting of ~3 weeks of reported delirium, that
has improved somewhat on a new risperidone. He reportedly
refused antibiotics when awoken, then became agitated and
combative at midnight last night, throwing objects around his
room and screaming at his caretakers. [**Name (NI) **] swung his cane at staff
members. Chemical restraint with haldol was unsuccessful. He was
placed on a section 12 by psychiatry and sent to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED
for further management.
.
In the ED inital vitals were 98.2, 112, 110/77, 20, 98% 3L NC.
Exam notable for +2 symmetric pitting edema to the thighs. Labs
included normal WBC and stable Hgb/Hct, elevated creatinine to
1.9 (baseline ~1.1), normal LFTs other than alkaline phosphatase
131, INR 1.3, BNP >6700, troponin 0.04, and a urinalysis with
moderate leukocytes, 6 WBC/hpf, but no bacteria. Lactate was
1.5. Head CT was negative for acute process but +clivus bony
lucency, as previously seen on MRI. CXR showed new bilateral
pleural effusions and worsening right sided opacities concerning
for infection and/or progression of malignancy. He had a 1:1
sitter for possible self-injurious gestures with oxygen tubing.
Solumedrol 125 mg IV, combivent nebs x3, ampcillin 1g,
vancomycin 1g, cefepime 2g, levofloxacin 750 mg, and enoxaparin
80 mg. Vitals prior to transfer were 108, 121/90, 28, 100%
(supplemental O2 not recorded).
.
On the floor, he has no complaints other than ongoing chronic
low back pain. Denies chest pain, dyspnea, cough, palpitations,
fevers, chills, leg pain, or constipation. Is hungry and is
asking for food.
.
OMR note written by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of hematology/oncology on [**2191-9-26**]
indicates that the patient had been declining clinically at
rehab, including worsening renal function, dyspnea and
performance status, and his sister [**Name (NI) 382**] at the time) had decided
to refocus his care on comfort measures.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies night sweats, recent weight loss or gain. Denies
headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies
wheezing. Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or changes in bowel
habits. Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency. Denies
arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rashes or skin changes.


Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
- [**4-/2189**]: presented to an outside hospital with severe back
pain, with CXR showing right upper lobe lung mass. PET scan
revealed FDG avidity at the periphery of the mass, with an
FDG-avid paratracheal lymph node
- [**2189-7-31**] cervical mediastinoscopy, multiple lymph nodes neg for
malignancy (report not available).
- [**2189-8-5**] transthoracic biopsy at [**Hospital1 18**], nondiagnostic. Pt
declined RUL lobectomy
- [**2189-11-3**] new moderate right-sided pleural effusion; right lung
nodule increased from 6.6 to 7.7 cm and was again noted to have
broad contact with the chest wall
- [**2189-12-2**]: Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] again saw the patient and recommended a
right thoracotomy and RUL lobectomy. Surgery was scheduled but
was canceled by the patient
- [**2190-1-1**] chest CT revealed further increase in the known
necrotic RUL lung mass, now measuring 8.1 x 7.5 cm. It was in
direct contact with the peripheral pleural surface, with loss of
a normal intercostal fat plane between the adjacent ribs,
suggesting possible chest wall invasion. The epicenter of the
mass was in the right upper lobe but crossed the fissure to
extend into the adjacent right middle lobe. Prevascular and
right paratracheal and precarinal lymph nodes were again
demonstrated, with a slight interval increase in the size of the
enlarged precarinal node. In the multidisciplinary thoracic
oncology conference, it was felt that the patient would most
likely
require a right pneumonectomy given the extent of his tumor.
However, due to his poor pulmonary function, with a DLCO of 60%,
it was felt that he would not tolerate a pneumonectomy.
- [**2190-2-4**]: A repeat bronchoscopy and endobronchial ultrasound
was performed for diagnostic purposes, with a biopsy of the
right upper lobe mass revealing poorly differentiated
adenocarcinoma with immunostains positive for P63 and CK7
(weak), negative for TTF-1. Squamous cell carcinoma was favored.
A transbronchial needle aspiration of station 7, 4R, and R11
lymph nodes revealed no malignant cells. Two sets of washings
were negative, but brushings were positive for malignant cells.

- [**2190-2-18**]: A repeat PET scan demonstrated no evidence of bony
metastatic disease. The previously biopsy-negative right
paratracheal lymph node was noted to be FDG-avid (SUV 4.7).
Thus, the patient was felt to have likely Stage IIIA (T3N1M0)
squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.
- [**2190-3-4**]: The patient began weekly carboplatin (AUC 2) and
paclitaxel (50mg/m2) given concurrently with radiation therapy.
Finished chemoradiation in [**3-/2190**], last dose of chemo on
[**2190-4-8**].
Required prednisone taper due to severe radiation pneumonitis.
.
[**2190-12-7**] CT torso showing a mildly enlarged cavitating lesion
in the right upper lobe, which is now 6.5 x 4.4 cm, increased
from 6.3 x 3.7 cm. There are two new right hilar lymph nodes,
both measuring approximately 2 cm
.
[**Month (only) **]-[**2191-1-25**]: Treated with carboplatin, gemcitabine, with doses
intermittently held for LFT abnormalities.
[**2191-2-25**]: CT chest without contrast showing slightly enlarged
right upper lung mass, measuring 7.5 x 5.2 cm, with slightly
enlarged soft tissue component at the right middle lobe
bronchus, measuring 3 x 3 cm
[**2191-2-22**]: Palliative chemo with taxotere, with doses held due
to dehydration and cytopenias.
.
[**2191-4-3**]: Admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] because of uncontrolled nausea and
emesis, dehydration, volume depletion. Patient [**Hospital1 34676**] on [**2191-4-4**]

[**2191-4-12**]: discontinue taxotere due to intolerable nausea, emesis,
decreased appetite
.
[**2191-4-24**]: Chemo with vinorelbine
.
[**2191-7-14**] CT chest: decreased size in primary mass, measuring 6.5
x 4.1 cm, as compared to 7.4 x 5.2 cm previously. The previously
noted thickening of the medial wall has also decreased,
measuring 2.1 x 1.9 cm compared to 2.9 x 1.6 cm previously. No
new nodules are present. Severe traction bronchiectasis related
to post-radiation therapy changes has mildly improved. Severe
paraseptal emphysema is unchanged.
.
[**Date range (3) 34677**]: Hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] for enterococcus mitral
valve endocarditis and T12-L1 diskitis/osteomyelitis. Treated
initially with ampicillin and gentamicin, with gentamicin
discontinued due to
impaired renal function. Six-week course of ampicillin is
scheduled to end on [**2191-9-16**]. He had a right internal jugular

and axillary vein thrombosis, associated with his right sided
port-a-cath, which was initially diagnosed at [**Hospital3 34678**] on [**2191-7-29**], and has continued on Lovenox for
treatment.
He was seen by cardiology for NSVT, mitral valve endocarditis,
and was started on metoprolol for rate control. He was seen by
cardiothoracic surgery for consideration of mitral valve repair,
with outpatient followup planned. He was discharged to the MACU
unit of [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, where he has been since discharge.
.
[**2191-8-2**] CT angio of the chest showed a 4.5 cm x 3 cm thick-walled
mixed solid and cystic structure in the right upper lobe
corresponding to interval necrosis of treated tumor. There is no
pulmonary embolism. Severe paraseptal emphysema was seen, along
with post-radiation changes in the right lung. There is an
enlarged and irregular substernal thyroid goiter, with features
concerning for malignancy.
[**2191-8-5**] MRI of the L-sp
