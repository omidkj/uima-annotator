History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 66722**] is a 61M with a history of SDH in [**2171**] complicated
by cognitive impairment/seizure disorder and BPH with frequent
UTI who is brought in from his nursing home for AMS after being
found unresponsive. FSBG was 170, and decreased UOP was noted
from indwelling Foley (catheter was changed last week, and nurse
at [**Hospital1 1501**] thinks it may have been replaced this morning as well).
He has recently been well; staff at his [**Hospital1 1501**] report that he was
wheeling himself around in his wheelchair the last few days, and
his sister saw him last weekend and said he was talking, eating
well, and laughing at jokes.

Of note, he was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 66732**] with
AMS and UTI (did not require ICU admission at that time). Urine
culture grew pan-sensitive pseudomonas. He was treated with a
two-week course of ciprofloxacin, and follow up with urology was
arranged for the end of this month. An indwelling Foley was left
in place given his issues with BPH. Also, his prophylactic
macrobid antibiotics were stopped, with a plan to have him
follow up with urology at his appointment regarding continued
need.

In the ED, initial VS were: T 99.1, HR 94, BP 90/52, RR 22, O2
sat 98% 15L Non-Rebreather. During his ED stay, BP dropped to
80/40 but came up to 90s with 150cc of IVF; however, then fell
to 80s again after 2L IVF. He became febrile to 102. He was
intubated for airway protection, and central line was placed. He
received a total of 4L IVF in the ED. EKG notable for poor
R-wave progression, no evidence of ischemia. Initial CXR showed
grossly clear lungs. U/A was grossly positive. He was given a
dose of vancomycin and Zosyn after blood and urine cultures were
sent. Vitals on transfer were BP 136/72, HR 78, vent settings
tidal volume 550, 14/5, 100% FiO2.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient is heavily sedated and
unresponsive to questions, not following commands.
.
Review of systems: Unable to be obtained given AMS/intubation.
