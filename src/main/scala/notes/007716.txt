[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 27634**] for consultation regarding a new diagnosis of
endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia.  The patient had a period
of amenorrhea between [**5-/2134**] and 01/[**2134**].  She then had very
irregular bleeding.  She had one episode where her bleeding was
so heavy that she visited the emergency room at [**Hospital 1474**]
Hospital in [**Month (only) 956**].  She did not require transfusion.  She
subsequently underwent endometrial biopsy with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 27634**].
This was read as EIN, both at [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital and at [**Hospital1 27635**] Hospital.  The slides were reviewed here and the [**Location (un) 1131**]
was atypical endometrium with extensive squamous morular
metaplasia.  This was thought to possibly represent EIN.

anxiety, history of multiple pulmonary emboli during one episode
eight years ago.  She has subsequently been on anticoagulation.

Tylenol with codeine, lorazepam, albuterol inhaler, and
hydrocortisone cream.

OB HISTORY:  Negative.

Physical Exam:
A complete physical examination was performed.

ABDOMEN:  Soft and nondistended and without palpable masses.

PELVIC:  The vulva and vagina and cervix were normal.  Bimanual
exam and rectovaginal examination was limited by body habitus.
The uterus and adnexa were not palpable.  There was no
cul-de-sac nodularity and the rectal was intrinsically normal.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was take to the operating room on HD 1 for a planned
ex-lap, TAH/BSO, possible staging procedure for EIN.  Shortly
after gaining access to the abdomen, the patient developed
oxygen desaturation to the 80s, hypotension to approximately
84/40, with an elevated A-a gradient.  The clinical picture was
concerning for intra-operative PE.  Given the patients history
of PE, the procedure was aborted and her pelvic organs were left
intact.  See operative note for details.

Immediately post-operatively, the patient was transported to the
ICU on a ventilator.  She was imperically anticoagulated with a
heparin drip.  The workup, including a VQ scan, EKG, lower
extremity doppler, were negative for PE or other pathology.  The
patient was extubated on POD 0 and her clinical status returned
to baseline.

The patient was bridged to her home dose of coumadin and the
heparin drip was discontinued.  The remainder of her
post-operative course was uncomplicated.

She was discharged home in stable condition with the plan to
re-attempt surgery in several months with continuous TEE.
