fevers and mental status change

pleural tap


History of Present Illness:
72 yo Mandarin speaking female with metastic breast CA who had a
hip fx 2 months ago with a prolonged hospital course and long
recovery at rehab, presents with MS [**First Name (Titles) 767**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1501**] on [**2138-11-20**].  She
also complained of sharp right sided chest pain.
.
Her temp in ED was 102.  She received 1L NS, tylenol,
vancomycin, ceftrioxone, [**Date Range **], lopressor and plavix.  She was
aditted to [**Hospital1 1516**] for rule out MI and fevers.


Past Medical History:
-- R. breast cancer s/p mastectomy no chemotx /
radiation[according to records from [**Hospital1 **]--pt had 1.9cm
infiltrating, poorly differentiated ductal carcinoma; 8 axillary
nodes (-). ER/PR negative & HER-2/Neu 3+. Pt reportedly lost to
follow-up after mastectomy - 10 years ago per notes. Chest CT
from [**2138-10-14**] shows "extenisive tumor mass involving the right
anterior chest wall & ribs...there appears to be increase in the
extent of . The lesion extends from the level of the aortic arch
caudally to the inferior costal margin." ]
-- s/p excisional bx of right neck lymph node [**10-3**] (for purpose
of assessing recurrance of breast CA via tumor markers
-- Stage 4 sacral decubitus ulcer
-- Osteoarthritis (according to son)
-- Anemia NOS
-- Pulmonary nodule (6mm) seen on [**10-3**] CT, unchanged from prior
scan
-- Calcified lung granuloma (? remote h/o TB)
--- choledolithiasis - 3 months ago @ MWH, had subsequent
sphintorectomy and biliary duct stenting placed with improvement
in n/v -> subsequent functional decline with overall weakness
leading to R hip Fx after a fall at home.
--- R hip replacement - 6 weeks ago - s/p ORIF, subsequent care
at [**Hospital1 **]
--- SI/attempt [**1-30**] to hip fx and associated pain


Social History:
Pt moved from [**Country 651**] to US 10yrs ago to live w/ her son & his
children. She has served as primary care giver for them. Has two
sons in [**Name (NI) 651**]. Hopes to move back one day.

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2138-11-20**]: Right lower lobe pneumonia with a small
parapneumonic effusion.
.
EGK [**11-20**]: 99bpm Sinus rhythm. Low limb lead voltage. There is
diffuse slight ST segment elevation.
.
TTE:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity  size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular  wall motion is normal.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are  normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
.
MR head:
Moderate brain atrophy.  No enhancing brain lesions to indicate
metastatic disease.
.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **]:
1.  There is no spinal cord compression.
2.  There are STIR and T1 hyperintense lesions in C7 and T2 most
consistent
with hemangiomas.
.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 2854**]:
There is no evidence of metastatic disease to the thoracic spine

or thoracic spinal cord compression.
.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **]:
1.  No lesion is seen that suggests a lumbar spine metastasis.
2.  There is moderate degenerative stenosis at L4-5 where there
is grade 1
spondylolisthesis and posterior element hypertrophy.
.
CT chest, Abd, pelvis:
1.  Large right breast/anterior chest wall soft tissue mass,
measuring
approximately 7.4 cm in size, eroded the adjacent sternum.
Associated right lateral chest wall 1.2 cm subcutaneous deposit.
 Moderate-sized layering right pleural effusion with three right
upper lobe/right middle lobe nodules.  No primary lung mass
identified. No additional osseous metastatic lesions seen.
2.  Calcified lung nodule with associated multiple calcified
mediastinal nodes suggest prior tuberculosis exposure.
3.  Pneumobilia with distended intra- and extra-hepatic biliary
ducts.  No
hepatic metastases visualized.
4.  Large right sacral decubitus ulcer extending to the
sacrum/coccyx, chronic osteomyelitis cannot be excluded.
5.  Right total hip replacement without evidence for loosening.
No acute
fracture or dislocation.
.
Pleural fluid Cytology: PND
.
Bone scan:
Patchy uptake involving the anterior right ribs and sternum
correlates with right chest wall osseous tumor invasion on CT
scan.
Uptake around the trochanteric portion of the right hip
prosthesis may relate to surgery, but if there had been a
pathologic fracture initially, residual osseous tumor cannot be
excluded.


Brief Hospital Course:
72 YO mandarin speaking woman with metastatic breast cancer and
recent hospitalization for hip fracture, state IV ulcer, and
recent suicide attempt who presents with fevers, N/V and found
to have pneumonia, UTI, bacteremia, Stage IV decubitus ulcer,
pleural effusion.
.
# Fever: Has multiple sources of infection including RLL PNA
treated with a course of azithromycin and at time of discharge
no cough or sputum production, lungs are clear.  UTI with
enterococcus, Strep milleri bacteremia. At time of discharge,
she was afebrile, normal WBC count.  Stage IV decubitus ulcer
dressing changes and family teaching.  Will complete a 14 day
course of antibiotics with moxifloxacin per ID recommendations.
Pleural effusion was tapped and showed exudate negative for
bacterial culture.  AFB stain was negative.  Cytology is pending
at the time of discharge.  It is thought the pleural effusion is
most likely associated with her malignancy but await cytology
results.
.
# ID: During her hospitalization, the infectious disease service
was concerned about active tuberculosis.  Her pleural effusion
was negative for AFB stain.  Pulmonary does not believe that
further evaluation is needed.  Infectious disease and infection
control have cleared patient for active TB; she does not need to
wear mask at home OR have contact TB precautions when
hospitalized (unless she develops new symptoms suspicious for
TB) at which point this will need to be reevaluated.
.
# HYPOTENSION: Likely [**1-30**] [**Month/Day (2) **] dose.  She only had low grade
temperatures and her lactate was normal which argues against
sepsis.  However, she currently has multiple infections and a
dramatic stage IV decubitus ulcer which puts her at high risk
for sepsis.  She responded to IVF and is currently at her
low-normal baseline.  (Her son reports that her SBP runs between
100-105.)
.
# MS CHANGE: She is back to baseline currently, confirmed with
son.  This was likely from her multiple infections.  MRI head
was negative for metastatic disease
.
# ANEMIA: She had a HCT drop from 27 to 22 and responded to 32
after 1u of pRBC.  She denies blood in stool but was guaiac + is
ED.  She has iron panel suggesting anemia of chronic disease.
She takes iron at home. She was continued on iron and her HCT
was monitored and PPI continued. At the time of discharge her
HCT was stable in the mid 30s.
