Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**]
Chief Complaint:
right facial droop, vomiting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
PEG tube placement
Tracheostomy

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old left-handed woman with a history of
HTN, HLD and prior stroke with residual left sided weakness who
presents with nausea, vomiting, blurred vision and new right
facial droop.  Per the patient and EMS, she was last seen normal
between 1700-1730 when she was at dinner. After dinner she was
brought back to her room, and between 1730 and 1740 developed
acute onset of blurry vision and severe nausea, and vomited up
her entire meal.  In this context it was also noted that she
developed a new right facial droop, and EMS was called.  Upon
arrival they noted that her FSG was 126, and her blood pressure
was 220/110.  They noted a significant right facial droop, and
slight dysarthria, but noted full strength on her right side.
In
transit they reported that her right facial droop actually
improved slightly.

The patient reports that her prior stroke occurred 'several
years
ago' and since that time she has had left arm and leg weakness,
but was not aware of any right sided weakness or eye movement
abnormalities.  She reports that after her stroke she was told
not to take aspirin or Plavix by her doctor, but it is unclear
why this is so.  She denies any history of GI bleeding or
intracranial hemorrhage.


Past Medical History:
- OA
- s/p right sided stroke with residual left arm and leg weakness
- urinary incontinence
- Hx of Grave's disease
- HTN
- HLD
- s/p right eye cataract repair.  Glaucoma in left eye


Social History:
Lives at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.  No EtOH, smoking or illicits.


Family History:
Mother died at 102 of old age.  Unclear what her
father died of, as patient becomes quite tearful when asked any
questions about him

IMAGING:
CT CODE STROKE PROTOCOL (CT, CTA, CTP)
No hemorrhage, and no definite CT evidence of acute vascular
territory infarct. Extensive white matter hypodensity likely
reflects
sequelae of chronic small vessel disease, but also makes it
difficult to rule out small acute lacune. Ventricular and sulcal
prominence is most consistent with atrophy

MRI
acute infarct in the right medulla . multiple punctate areas of
susceptibility artifact on GRE, most consistent with amyloid
angiopathy.
other findings consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic
changes and prior infarcts.

TTE
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF
80%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting
structures of the tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. There
is no pericardial effusion.

REPEAT CT HEAD [**8-9**]:
FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Right
hypodensity in the medulla (2:7) is progressed from the
comparison study dated
[**2197-7-31**], representing evolution of the known infarction in
that
location. Note is made of periventricular white matter hypodense
areas which
are bilateral, reflecting chronic microvascular infarction.
Ventriclar and
sulcal enlargement signifies parenchymal volume loss. There is
no fracture.
Fluid in the mastoid air cells on the left, is new from
[**0-0-0**] as is fluid
layering in the nasopharynx and a small air-fluid level seen in
the sphenoid
sinus. Marked atherosclerotic vascular calcifications are noted.


IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect or obvious
new infarct. If
there is continued concern, consider MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] if not
contra-indicated.
2. Expected evolution of the known right medulla infarction.
3. New fluid in the mastoid air cells on the left as well as in
the sphenoid
sinus and nasopharynx.
