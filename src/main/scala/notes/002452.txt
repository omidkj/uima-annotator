History of Present Illness:
OUTPATIENT CARDIOLOGIST: Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 3733**]
EVENTS / HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:
Mr. [**Known lastname 17684**] is a 61 year old male with history of IDDM, HTN,
hypercholesterolemia, 3v CAD who presents with worsening
shortness of breath over the past four days. His dyspnea on
exertion began initially in [**Month (only) **] of this year. He is a dog
walker and was walking the dogs 2 miles three times per day
without difficulty. In [**Month (only) **] he noted that he was unable to walk
two blocks without shortness of breath. He additionally had
increasing fatigue. He underwent echocardiogram which showed EF
50%, exercise MIBI showed reversible inferior wall defect. He
was admitted here [**9-8**] for elective catheterization. Cath showed
diffuse 3v disease, no intervention was done. CT surgery was
consulted for CABG planning. Repeat echo at that time showed
mild regional LV systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of
distal septum and apex. Apparently CABG had been on hold pending
dental extractions. Since [**Holiday 1451**] he has had increasing
shortness of breath. He was hanging [**Holiday **] lights on [**11-12**] and
became dyspneic after 10 minutes. His shortness of breath has
worsened until today when he was unable to walk across the
street due to extreme SOB. He also report LH every morning for
the past 3 days. The lightheadedness persists for 3-4 hrs and he
feels as though he may pass out.

Pertinent Results:

.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2135-8-25**] demonstrated:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of
the distal septum and apex. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The [**Date Range 5554**] pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2131-2-15**], the mitral regurgitation has resolved.

.
ETT performed on [**2135-9-1**] demonstrated:
IMPRESSION: 1. Moderate severity, reversible inferior wall
perfusion defect. 2. Moderate severity, partially reversible
apical perfusion defect. 3. Defects are seen at submaximal
exercise. 4. Transient ischemic dilatation. 5. Global
hypokinesis more pronounced in the inferior and apical wall. 6.
LVEF 39%.
.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2135-9-8**] demonstrated:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated diffuse three (3)
vessel coronary artery disease. The left main demonstrated a 50%
lesion in the proximal portion of the vessel. The left anterior
descending artery was diseased throughout the vessel including a
total occlusion in the mid portion of the vessel along with a
70% lesion in the first diagonal. The left circumflex was
diffusely diseased including serial 70% lesions in the proximal
and mid portion of the vessel. The right coronary artery was a
small vessel with diffuse disease throughout the vessel.
2. Subselective arteriography of the left subclavian
demonstrated a
widely patent LIMA vessel and no obvious subclavian stenosis.
3. LV ventriculography was deferred.
4. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated right
(RVEDP =
13mm Hg) and elevated left (mean PCWP=20mm Hg). The cardiac
index
calculated via the Fick method was preserved at 2.8.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2135-11-21**] 3:58 PM
CHEST (PA & LAT)
Reason: assess for ptx
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
61 year old man s/p cabg and ct removal
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
assess for ptx
INDICATION: Search for pneumothorax.
COMPARISON: Comparison to [**2135-11-18**].
The endotracheal tube, the nasogastric tube, the Swan-Ganz
catheter have all been removed. No suggestion of pneumothorax.
The size of the cardiac silhouette is slightly increased; there
is a slight increase in caliber of the pulmonary vasculature. No
evidence of circumscribed opacities suggestive of pneumonia. The
lateral view shows small bilateral effusions that are limited to
the costophrenic sinuses. No other changes.
IMPRESSION: After removal of the tubes and lines, no
pneumothorax. Slight cardiomegaly with mild signs of
overhydration. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
