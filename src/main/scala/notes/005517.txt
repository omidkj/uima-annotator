History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness: 54 YO M with history of COPD, OSA
and afib presented to an OSH ED in severe hypercapnic
respiratory distress on [**2158-10-4**] requiring intubation at the
time. Given his history of COPD he was empirically treated with
Vanc and Zosyn for a 7 day course and was started on IV
methylprednisone.  He was extubated on HD5 without complication.

.
Mr. [**Known lastname 4281**] notes that in [**2154**] CT scans first noted a lesion in
his rgith mainstem bronchus. OSH CTs have subsequently noted
interval enlargment of a lesion.  A bronchoscopy on this
admission revealed a ball-valve type lesion, mobile with
positive pressure and is thought to be causing obstruction
leading to COPD exacerbations and pneumonias. He presents to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further treatment and evaluation by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
Per report, Mr. [**Known lastname 4281**] has been admitted at least five times
this year for COPD exacerbations resulting in multiple
intubations. In addition, one month prior to this admission he
was noted to have a PE and subtherapeutic INR which was treated
with heparin drip.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
54M with h/o of COPD, a-fib, Diabetes, CHF, and PE recently
intubated for COPD flare in the setting of multiple PNAs and
COPD flares admitted for debulking of ball-valve lesion of RUL
on [**10-12**]. Hospital course included 1 day stay in intensive care
unit for obersvation after required reintubation in PACU. The
patient left against medical advice and was agitated about his
length of stay.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure  - The patient was taken to
the operating room for debulking procedure on the day after
admission. The patient was initially extubated in the operating
but required reintubation due to hypercarbic respiratory
failure. After the patient was extubated in the PACU, he was
given ipratroprium and albuterol nebs.  He denied SOB, DOE,
Chest Pain, and then was transferred to the MICU to monitor for
respiratory failure.  Overnight in the MICU, he was stable at
90% O2 on 3-4L of O2 by nasal cannula, which was above his home
O2 requirement of 2L's of O2.  He was restarted on his home meds
for COPD and CHF, including tiotropium, albuterol, ASA,
diltiazem , metoprolol, Hydrochlorothiazide, and lasix.  He was
transferred to the floor for continued monitoring and treatment
of COPD (see below)
.
# Bronchial mass - the bronchial mass was removed by rigid
bronchoscopy and electrocautery by interventional pulmonology.
The mass was sent for pathologic examination and revealed
endobronchial hamartoma. The procedure was tolerated by the
patient and without complication.
.
# Pulmonary Embolus, chronic - diagnosed on OSH CT approximately
one month prior to this admission. The patient was kept on
heparin drip with goal PTT of 60-80 except for immediately prior
to, during, and after his procedure. Coumadin was resumed on the
day prior to discharge. His INR was 1.2 at the time of discharge
and the patient was advised to start lovenox until INRs could be
checked and were ensured to be in the therapeutic range.
.
# Discharge against medical advice: on Sunday [**2158-10-15**], the
patient was adamant in wanting to leave the hospital. He was
hostile toward staff, and a Code Purple was called. Despite
explaining to him the need for Lovenox teaching,
co-administration of Lovenox and warfarin, and the need for INR
checks, he wanted to leave the hospital right away. Risks were
explained to him, and he expressed understanding. He should
follow-up with his PCP for INR checks.
.
INACTIVE ISSUES:
# COPD with acute exacerbation - The patient was continued on
his home medications during this hopsitalization. Steroids that
was started prior to transfer were tapered to off on the day
after discharge.  No antibiotics were given during this
hospitalization. As above, the patient did require reintubation
for hypercapnic respiratory failure after his OR procedure.
.
# CHF - The patient presented with some edema likely due to
volume overload from suboptimal diuresis versus IVF during ICU
stay at this and recent hospitalizations. The aptient was
continued on his home dose of lasix as well as home doses of
beta blocker, calcium-channel-blocker and aspirin. An ACEI and
statin can be considered in the outpatient setting.
.
# Smoking - Continues to smoke at home. A nicotine patch was
provided.
.
# DM type 2- the patient's glyburide was held during the
hospitalization and he was kept on SSI. He was instructed to
resume home medications upon discharge.
.
