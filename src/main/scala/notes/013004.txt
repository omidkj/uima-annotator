History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 58 year old male with a current history of AV
endocarditis with resultant aortic insufficiency and congestive
heart failure. On [**5-7**], he was hospitalized with complaints
of [**2-9**] month history of fatigue, weight loss, and low grade
fever. He was found to have HACEK endocarditis and was treated
with Ceftriaxone. A TEE at that time revealed severe AI and a
small vegetation on the right coronary cusp of the aortic valve.
He was readmitted on [**5-20**] for worsening SOB. He was found to
have pulmonary edema and required further diuresis. His
shortness of breath has been slowly improving since he started
taking Lasix daily. He denies any chest pain, palpitations, LE
edema, claudication or lightheadedness. Prior to cardiac
surgical intervention, he will be admitted for preop cardiac
catheterization to rule out coronary artery disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted and underwent cardiac catheterization
which was notable for a right dominant system and normal
coronary arteries. Further workup included dental consultation
which cleared him for surgery after clinical and radiographic
evaluation found no evidence of infection. He otherwise remained
stable on medical therapy. Prior to the OR, the PICC line was
successfully removed.

On [**6-4**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**] performed an aortic valve replacement
with closure of an aorto-right ventricular outflow tract
fistula. For surgical details, please see seperate dictated
operative note. Following the operation, he was brought to the
CSRU for invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. The central line and
chest tubes were removed without complication. He maintained
stable hemodynamics and transferred to the SDU on postoperative
day one.  A PICC line was placed on [**2120-6-7**] for continuation of
IV antibiotic upon discharge, in coordination with the
infectious disease consultant.  He participated with physical
therapy successfully and was discharged home on POD 4.
