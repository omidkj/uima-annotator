Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 80 year-old man with a history of critical AS
(peak velocity 5.2 m/s, peak gradient 106 mmHg, [**Location (un) 109**] .8 cm2)
presenting with acute onset shortness of breath this morning.
He has never been short of breath in the past and actually leads
quite an active lifestyle.  His symptoms seem to have started on
the morning of [**8-7**] when he experienced 5 minutes of shortness
of breath.  This feeling quickly resolved and the patient felt
well enough to play 18 holes of golf later that day.  At
baseline he is very active and he is able to log 20 miles per
week on his stationary bicycle without any episodes of chest
discomfort, palpitations, or lightheadedness.  Later on the 18th
the patient went out for dinner and ate a very salty meal of
clams and stuffed shrimp.  He also ate a pint of ice cream and
biked for 6 miles on his stationary bike before going to bed.
He slept well overnight on 1 pillow and got up to urinate over
night.  He then woke up at 8AM and felt extremely short of
breath after brushing his teeth.  It didn't effect him that much
because he was still able to carry out his normal morning
routine, although with difficulty.  He was not able to do his
morning exercises, however, and he tried to lay down and his
shortness of breath did not resolve.  Finally he went outside to
get some fresh air with his dog and got diaphoretic and wheezy.
His neighbor convinced him to call the ambulance to be brought
in to the hospital.  He specifically denies any fevers, chills,
cough, change in bowel habits, dysuria, dizziness,
lightheadedness, chest pain, or abdominal pain.
   An outpatient ETT-echo had been planned to assess his blood
pressure response to exercise in anticipation of a possible back
surgery for his spinal stenosis.  He has had 2 back surgeries in
the past for this condition, the last being 7-8 years ago.  Of
note, he received a Cortisone injection of his back 2 weeks ago.
 This pending surgery would be to address his chronic right leg
pain which he feels has been limiting his activity.  The plan
was to proceed with the surgery unless he had an abnormally
hypotensive response to exercise, then AVR would be considered.
No AVR was planned because the patient has never experienced any
lightheadedness, dizziness, presyncope, chest pain, or shortness
of breath in the past.

Documentation of inital EMS vitals is not available.  By report,
en route to hospital he received 1 SL nitro and albuterol nebs
after which he felt somewhat better.  On arrival to the ED, the
first set of documented vitals T 97.8, HR 120, RR 36, BP 163/91,
O2 Sat 95% on 10 L O2.  In the ED he desatted to the 80s on RA.
Exam notable for poor air movement, tachycardia with SEM, and 2+
b/l pitting edema.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia, and CXR was
without evidence of infiltrate but did show volume overload.
Labs notable for WBC 17.4 with 93% PMN as well as a D-Dimer of
1411. His oxygen requirement escalated and he required CPAP.  He
received 40 mg IV lasix and put out 300 cc of urine within 30
minutes. He also received 1 g vancomycin.  VS prior to transfer
HR 108, BP 114/65, RR 17, 99% on CPAP,  T 97.4.

En route to CCU patient underwent CTA which, per discussion with
radiology resident, was negative for PE, infiltrate, volume
overload, or other abnormalities apart from small bilaterally
symmetric pleural effusions.

On arrival to the CCU the patient had diuresed a total of 1700cc
and was satting well on 3L nasal cannula.

On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope
