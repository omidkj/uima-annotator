Date of Birth:   [**2099-2-5**]       Sex:  F

Service:  HEPATOBILIARY SURGERY

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Acute pancreatitis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 39-year-old
woman transferred from [**Hospital6 43614**] Center for
treatment of severe pancreatitis.  She was transferred to
[**Hospital6 43614**] Center on [**2138-8-1**], after
presenting to another hospital the day before with the sudden
onset of severe epigastric pain with nausea and vomiting.  On
admission she was tachycardiac and tachypneic and febrile.
She had significant abdominal tenderness at this time.  She
had a leukocytosis with WBC of 15.7 and 5 bands.  Amylase was
1128, and lipase was 5856.  She was resuscitated with fluids
but became hypotensive and required 9 L of Crystalloid on
[**8-3**].  A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis without
contrast was performed which demonstrated marked
peripancreatic inflammation with phlegmon and fluid.  She
developed significant bandemia to 33.  Her hematocrit was 45
on [**8-2**] which fell to 35 on [**7-3**].  Given the
severity of her pancreatitis and concern for pancreatic
necrosis, the patient was started on Imipenem.  Her amylase
upon presentation to the [**Hospital6 256**]
was 243.  Her LFTs had normalized.  She was intubated for
transport with a pO2 of 65 on 60% FI02.  She required an
Insulin drip for hyperglycemia.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus.  2.  Hypertension.  3.  Hypercholesterolemia.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  1.  Total hip replacement.  2.  Open
reduction and internal fixation.  3.  Deviated septum.  4.
Bunionectomy.

ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Insulin, Aspirin, Zocor, Prinivil.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient does not smoke.  She is a social
drinker.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 100.8??????,
pulse 217, blood pressure 127/68, respirations 13, oxygen
saturation 98%, vent settings for CMV of 650 x 10 space 5
space 100%.  Arterial blood gas on admission was 7.33, 46,
127, 25, -1.  General:  The patient was intubated, sedated,
but was responsive to painful stimuli.  HEENT:  Pupils equal,
round and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular
eye movements intact.  She was anicteric.  Nasogastric tube
in place.  Chest:  Coarse bilaterally.  Heart:  Tachycardiac
but regular.  Abdomen:  Distended and tympanitic.  Tender to
palpation.  Extremities:  Without clubbing, cyanosis, or
edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation and treatment for
pancreatitis.  The patient was continued on Imipenem.  She
remained intubated and sedated on Fentanyl and Ativan.
Insulin drip was continued for control of her hyperglycemia.
The patient continually spiked fevers with a T-max of 102?????? on
hospital day #2 and 103?????? on hospital day #3.  Blood cultures
were obtained with these spikes.  She also had decreased PA
O2s during her hospital stay.

Sputum cultures were obtained which revealed 2+ gram-negative
rods, 1+ gram-positive rods, and 1+ gram-positive cocci.
Sputum cultures grew Haemophilus influenza and Imipenem was
continued for her pancreatitis and pneumonia.  Repeat CT scan
was also performed which revealed no evidence of pancreatic
necrosis.

Due to her continued pulmonary issues, on hospital day #4, an
esophageal balloon manometer was used to calculate
transpulmonary pressures.  The patient was also started on
TPN for nutritional supplementation.  On hospital day #5, it
was decided to also add trophic tube feeds through an NG
which was placed extending to the third to fourth portion of
the duodenum.  The patient tolerated these feeds well.

The patient continued to be treated with fluid resuscitation,
as well as treatment for her pneumonia and pancreatitis.
Serial chest x-rays revealed improvement in her pulmonary
status.  She also continued to spike fever over the next
several days.  Cultures were obtained with these fever
spikes; however, no organisms were isolated.

Pulmonary status did progressively improve; however, it
remained very serious with the appearance of ARDS.  With the
progressive resolution of her pancreatitis, she became more
hemodynamically stable, and she was able to be progressively
diuresed with Lasix as needed.

On hospital day #7, the patient was transfused 2 U of packed
red blood cells for a falling hematocrit which had decreased
to 22.3.  She was also started on Epogen once a week.

On SICU day #8, the patient began having loose stools which
were found to be C-diff positive.  She was started on Flagyl,
in addition to the Imipenem.  Repeat CT scan on SICU day #11
revealed no obvious abscess or fluid collections in the
abdomen.  Chest was remarkable for bilateral pleural
effusions which were progressively improving.

The patient's pulmonary status continued to improve.  Her
vent settings were weaned, and she was extubated on hospital
day 12.  Her fever curve continued to trend down as well.
Her tube feeds were increased to goal, and she continued to
be diuresed.  Imipenem was discontinued after a two-week
course.  NG tube was discontinued, and the patient was slowly
progressed on an oral diet.  She continued to do well and was
transferred to the floor on hospital day #16.

By [**2138-8-21**], the patient was tolerating a regular
diet.  Her abdominal pain had completely resolved.  She was
ambulating well without assistance.  She completed a 10-day
course of Flagyl.  Repeat CBC, CHEM10, LFTs, amylase, and
lipase were within normal limits.  She was started on Lipitor
80 mg q.d. and Niacin SR 500 mg b.i.d. because of the
possibility that hypertriglyceridemia was the cause of her
acute pancreatitis.  Triglyceride levels at the outside
hospital were measured to be over 1000.

On hospital day #18, the patient was felt stable for
discharge home.

DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vitals signs:  Temperature
99.8??????, pulse 66, blood pressure 120/70, respirations 20,
oxygen saturation 95% on room air.  Heart:  Regular, rate and
rhythm.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen:
Soft, nontender, nondistended.  Normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  Without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Insulin 30 U NPH in the morning and
at dinner, Lipitor 80 mg q.d., Niacin SR 500 mg b.i.d.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is to be discharged home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Acute pancreatitis likely secondary to
hypertriglyceridemia.
2.  Systemic inflammatory response syndrome.
3.  Acute respiratory distress syndrome.
4.  Haemophilus pneumoniae.
6.  Clostridium difficile colitis.
7.  Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
8.  Hypertriglyceridemia.
