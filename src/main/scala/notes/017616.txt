Brief Hospital Course:
64 y/o male initially transferred from OSH to the SICU.
Triple phase CT scan was performed on his abdomen.
-Segment VIII 4.0 x 3.9 x 4.0-cm heterogeneously enhancing liver
mass is
concerning for a hepatoma.
-No change in hemoperitoneum, with no evidence of active
extravasation.
-Subtle focus of arterial enhancement in segment VI, also
concerning for
malignancy.
-Tumor/ thrombus in middle hepatic vein.
-Mesenteric stranding and thick walled colon, likely from third
spacing. Varices.
He received 3 units of RBC's for the bleeding from the right
lobe of the liver. His Hct remained stable following the
transfusions.
Patients' main complaint was pain, most notably in shoulders and
upper back. He was initially given oxycodone with fair effect
and switched to dilaudid which appeared to provide better pain
relief.
Patient was seen by the GI service while in house, and an
attempt was made to obtain EGD. He was unable to tolerate
conscious sedation, and in fact became agitated with
administration of Versed. The patient will be scheduled for an
outpatient EGD and potentially for liver biopsy to assess status
of the hepatitis C and evidence of cirrhosis as this has not
been done in the past.
Patient underwent nuclear bone scan which reports:
No scintigraphic evidence of osseous metastases. Degenerative
changes in the
lower lumbar spine, mid thoracic spine, right sternoclavicular
joint and right
knee.
He was also seen by Hepatology service who will follow, and if
patient wishes to pursue interferon therapy at some point, they
will become involved.
Patients case was presented at Radiologic rounds and the
decision was made to offer patient chemoembolization as this was
not felt to be resectable.
He will return to Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 9411**] clinic in 2 weeks and also has GI
follow-up scheduled.
