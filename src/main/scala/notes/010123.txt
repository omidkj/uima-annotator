hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
.

History of Present Illness:
70 yo M with history of ESRD on HD, multiple MRSA line
infections, atrial fibrillation, and CAD who is admitted to the
MICU for respiratory distress.
.
The patient was noted at dialysis on the day prior to admission
to have a fever to 102 with altered mental status and was sent
to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED. He was admitted to the general medicine service
on [**2132-6-5**] with fever and lethargy. On the floor, the patient
was continued on Vancomycin for likely HD line infection. An LP
was not performed given that the pt's lethargy had improved and
he was thought to be at his baseline mental status. He was
started on Levofloxacin this morning for GNR in his blood.
.
The patient had been doing well until today. 35 minutes after
initiating dialysis (with 500cc fluid removal), the pt began
having rigors with shortness of breath. His temperature
increased to 101.7, BP was 203/126 with HR 122. His oxygen
saturation decreased to 88% RA.  He was given a nebulizer with
slight improvement in his subjective complaints of dyspnea. He
was initially placed on 5L NC which was titrated up to 15L NRB
mask. The MICU was called for evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: Etiology of respiratory
distress/failure not entirely clear. CXR reveals slightly
increased vascular markings and new cuffing, concerning for
possible volume overload though compared to last several months
the CXR is not that different. This CXR was after the patient
was acutely hypertensive to 203/126 with HR 122, which could
point to possible flash pulmonary edema. Given hx of DVT, can
also consider PE, especially with large A-a gradient. Pt also
has element of hypoventilation with poor oxygenation by ABG.
gave pt trial of BiPAP to see if pt appeared more comfortable,
pt's respiratory status did not improve and pt appeared
uncomfortable. Pt intubated, received CTA to r/o PE. Pt
tolerated intubation but attempts to wean from ventilator
unsuccessful. Pt developed opacity on CXR suggestive of pna and
abx treatment initiated once MRSA pneumonia identified; however,
pt's respiratory distress did not resolve c vancomycin x 19
days. Trach placed and pt weaned on ventilator. Pulmonary edema
noted on CXR and pt diuresed gently because prone to hypotension
particularly c hemodialysis. Required assist control but
eventually weaned to pressure support. Currently, limiting
factor largely pt's respiratory muscle weakness 2/2 prolonged
hospitalization. Pt has tolerated PS x 7 days and nights.
Yesterday also tolerated trial sprint of [**3-27**] although became
tachypneic. Partly [**12-26**] anxiety--> will try ativan during
sprints.
-In effort to improve resp muscle weakness continue sprints of
lower pressure for 45 mins until pt SOB/tachpneic c return to
higher pressure afterwards to allow pt to rest
-Placed passe valve
.
2. Sepsis: Pt with elevated lactate, fevers and hypotension
(after intubation) pointing to sepsis. Likely line infection
from femoral dialysis catheter. Blood cultures growing GNR and
GPC. Will discontinue dialysis line. Continue Levofloxacin for
GNR (which are sensitive) and Vanco given hx of staph aureus
line infections. After abx course pt continued to have
intermitent feverss and multiple episodes fo MAP dropping into
30-40s. Initially treated c multiple IVF boluses. However, pt
eventually required levophed to maintain MAP>60. Etiology of
hypoT likely sepsis and hypovolemia as pt had CVPs<10 and
hypotension worse after hemodialysis. Pt eventually grew
Serratia out of his blood cultures and was treated c a 21 day
course of ceftaz. In addition, his dialysis cath was pulled and
a new one placed. Afterwards, he continued to have low grade
fevers and developed the aforementioned LLL pna. Also, his R
femoral line was pulled and grew Coag- staph. Therefore he was
started on a 7 day course of meropenem and vancomycin. On this
regimen his LLL opacity has resolved and his fever curve has
turned downward. He has since had no positive blood cultures. Pt
currently no WBC, no tachyc and today hypertensive c MAPs>75.
Bld cx NGTD. Stool neg for C diff. TTE no signs of IE.

3. ESRD: Received hemodialysis initially and then was
transitioned to CVVH. Once his BP tolerated he was transitioned
back to HD. Followed by Renal Service throughout. The pt did not
make any urine throughout his stay. With HD his BP initially
dropped. Therefore, his HD was spaced out and less fluid was
withdrawn during each session. Attempts were made to keep the pt
net fluid negative during the week. Pt c temporary dialysis cath
in place and will require more permanent line eventually. Pt
required supplementation of his phosphate c neutraphos regularly
and briefly reqrd recalcitrol. Pt currently tolerating removal
of 2kg of fluid via HD three times a week. Holding beta blocker
on dialysis days to prevent instigation of hypotension. -Per
Renal pt will eventually require more permanent access.

4. [**Name (NI) 3674**] Pt's Hct repeatedly dropped over last three weeks
requiring multiple transfusions. Etiology unknown. Possibly [**12-26**]
GI bleed as pt c h/o melanic stools, Guiac positive regularly,
and on significant anticoagulation c argatroban/coumadin. RBC
scan negative for GI bleed. Alternatively, maybe [**12-26**] ESRD. Pt
given epo [**Hospital1 **]. Also, maybe [**12-26**] Fe deficiency and so pt given
iron supplements. Currently Hct stable x 5ds off
anticoagulation. Following Hcts [**Hospital1 **] and remained in low 30s.
Will restart anticoagulation. Transfuse for Hct<25. Pt will
require colonoscopy/EGD as outpt to further eval guiac positive
stools.
.
.
5. Atrial fibrillation: Intermittently V-paced. Pt c one episode
of tachycardia c rate controlled c diltiazem. Otherwise no
incidents. Pt's anti-coagulation held for one week while Hct
unstable. Currently Hct stable and restarted coumadin. Goal INR
2-

6. [**Name (NI) 34483**] Pt c h/o HIT and also upper extremity clots so not
started on heparin. Anti-coagulated in hospital c argatroban and
then transitioned to coumadin. Anticoagulation held while pt's
Hct unstable.
.
7. FEN: Pt tolerating tube feeds via PEG tube. Requires
intermitent supplementation of phosphate c neutraphos based on
low serum phosphate.
.

8. Access: Right IJ in place c 3 ports, 2 of which are dedicated
for use only c CVVH. R femoral removed and grew coag negative
staph. IR reluctant to place on R as stent from IJ to SVC. On
left pt has braciocephalic clot preventing PIC placement. Pt now
c 1 peripheral IVs.
