Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5552**]
Chief Complaint:
fever, vomiting, weakness, dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal Intubation


History of Present Illness:
67yo man with h/o esoph CA dx'd [**6-29**] on endoscopy after he
presented with dysphagia and hematemesis, s/p chemo and XRT in
[**8-5**], s/p esophagectomy [**2115-11-14**], with recovery c/b poor
nutrition requiring G-tube placement, who was doing well until
4d PTA when he began to have fevers and dyspnea.  He developed a
productive cough with greenish sputum 3d PTA, then began
vomiting 1d PTA with his wife noticing [**Name2 (NI) **] streaks in his
mucus.  When the streaking became worse on the AM of admit, the
patient's wife brought him into the [**Name (NI) **] for evaluation. [**Name (NI) **]
wife reports recent URI and feels that the patient may have
caught her illness.

In ED, CXR showed RML and RLL infiltrates with persistant small
bilateral pleural effusions. The patient was given 2L of normal
saline, as well as Azithromycin and Levaquin, and then
transferred to the floor.

Pertinent Results:
[**2116-1-14**]   Chest PA and Lat: Comparison with [**2115-12-12**].
The [**Year (4 digits) **] electrodes are unchanged. Median sternotomy wires and
clips and replacement valve are unchanged. Stable cardiac and
mediastinal contours. There is a stable left pleural effusion.
There is probably also a small right effusion, stable. There is
a new air space opacity in the right lower lobe and possibly
right middle lobe. No pneumothorax. There is also probably
atelectasis in the left retrocardiac region. The left subclavian
central venous catheter remains unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Hypoxia/resp distress: [**1-29**] R sided PNA, flu, ?UIP and CHF.
Presently not felt to be related to heart failure as echo with
no change in LV function and no evidence of pulm HTN. Creatinine
and BUN rising so aggressive diuresis aborted. Feel that
underlying respiratory distress may be related to interstitial
pneumonitis.  He initially presented on the floor, but
subsequent respiratory distress necessitated transfer to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  His respiratory distress was thought to be
multifactorial; due to CHF (he was in afib, likely volume
overloaded), influenza (tested positiv from nasal aspirate),
?pneumonia, and his underlying lung disease.  Although he has
never had a lung biopsy, he has been radiographically diagnosed
with UIP.  Pulmonary followed him while in-house.  They felt
that the differential for his interstitial lung disease was UIP,
amiodarone toxicity, and BOOP.  They recommended high dose
steroids to be continued for a month (prednisone 60 mg).  This
will then be tapered, and he will follow up in pulmonary clinic.
 He was diuresed in the unit, started on broad spectrum
antibiotics, and given supportive care.  His empiric
ceftriaxone/flagyl was stopped on [**2116-1-30**].  Follow up CT scan
showed improvement in the ground glass appearance, and he
remained afebrile and without leukocytosis.  He was also paced
out of his afib/aflutter by electrophysiology.  The irregular
rhythm had probably been contributing to his CHF and volume
overload.  He remained in normal sinus rhythm after this
intervention and had not more problems with volume overload.  He
was kept even with respect to Ins and Outs.

When clinically stable, he was transferred back to the floor
where he remained afebrile, was saturating stably on 2 L NC.  He
did not require more aggressive ventilation. He was saturating
well on room air at time of discharge.  He will continue 60 mg
Prednisone daily until the beginning of [**Month (only) 958**] when he will
follow up with Pulmonary clinic (steroids will likely be tapered
at this time).  He will also need to follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] after leaving rehabilitataion.  In terms of volume
status, he should still be kept even with respect to his
Ins/Outs, for he gets volume overloaded very easily.

2.  Esophageal Cancer (T3N0M0): He is s/p chemotherapy and
radiation in [**6-29**] followed by esophagectomy in [**10-30**].  His
recovery has been complicated by issues of nutrition.
Postoperatively, he had a J-tube placed to aid with nutrition,
and he has not been able to take PO's safely (has failed
multiple speech and swallow evaluations).  He failed video
swallowing study repeatedly on this admission.  He likley needs
to regain more strength and then retry this study in a few
weeks.  He should be maintained solely on J-tube feeds until
that time.

3.  Hypernatremia-He had some hypernatremia while in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
which responded to free water boluses.  He remained clinically
euvolemic with normal sodium subsequently.

4. CV
a) Ischemia: he had a small troponin leak while in the unit,
likely demand related.  Beta blocker, statin, and ace were
started.  He was discharged on a regimen of Toprol, Lisinopril,
and Digoxin.  He will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 284**].

b)Pump: EF 30%, MVR.  He was aggressively diuresed in the unit
(component of volume overload likely contributing to his
respiratory distress and requiring [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay).  Upon returning
to the floor, he was kept even with respect to Ins/Outs and had
no further problems with volume overload.

c) Valve: S/p MVR: He was kept appropriately anticoagulated on
heparin and coumadin as necessary while in-house and discharged
on coumadin.  He will need to have his [**Hospital Unit Name 263**] checked twice a week
(goal [**Hospital Unit Name 263**] 2.5-3.5), and his coumadin dose may need to be
adjusted accordingly based on these results.

d) Rhythm: s/p [**Hospital Unit Name **] + ICD/h/o afib- on coumadin. Required
cardioversion initially in hospitalization
