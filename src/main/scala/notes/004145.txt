Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was emergently taken to the operating room and he
underwent thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair.  Post operatively
patient was taken to ICU for recovery.

By systems:

Neuro - Patient did not move his bilateral lower extremities nor
the right upper extremity.  Patient underwent CT of the head
which did not show any signs of stroke.  Per neurology
recommendations we planned to obtain an MRI of the spine which
we were unable to obtain due to his poor cardiac fuction.

CV - Patient continued to require pressors.  Towards the end of
his hospital stay he had required three different pressors to
maintain adequate blood pressue.

Resp - He developed pseudomonas pneumonia which required
increased ventilatory support and broad spectrum antibiotics.
He was never weened from the full ventilatory support

GI - He was kept NPO due to development of gut ischemia.
Patient had bloody bowel movements and a sigmoidoscopy that
showed ischemic colon.  He was supported with fluids and TPN.

Renal - Patient was placed on CVVHD.  He was too unstable for
HD.

ID - Patient had rising WBC to 59 prior to expiration.  He was
on broad spectrum antibiotics and he was pan cultured throughout
the hospital stay.

Heme - He maintained his hct throughout but he developed
thrombocytopenia during the hospital stay.  His HIT was
negative.

Endo - Patient was on insulin drip at times to control his blood
sugar.

Patient developed multi organ failure on last hospital day.
After a long discussion with the family.  Patient was made DNR
