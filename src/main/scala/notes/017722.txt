Brief Hospital Course:
60 y.o. Male with NSLC with post-obstructive PNA with
radiographic evidence of LUL mass with gas pockets.

##. Left Upper Lobe obstruction: Pt was admitted for fevers and
cough, chest x-ray on admission showed post-obstructive
pneumonia that failed to improve on a course of Ceftriaxone,
Vancomycin and Clindamycin. Pt was then seen by interventional
pulmonary for possible stent placement to improve drainage for
his pneumonia. Upon flexible bronchoscopy pt was noted to have
tumour with the left main bronchus. Pt was then rescoped with
rigid bronchoscopy and cryotherapy which unfortunately showed
complete obliteration of the left upper lobe bronchus secondary
to his thoracic mass. Pt's thoracic mass most likely tumour
versus abscess formation, case was discussed with pt's
outpatient Oncologist; he will follow up as an outpatient and
will likely be referred to Thoracic surgery for possible mass
removal. Per ID recommendation pt was discharged on Levofloxacin
and Clindamycin to prevent bacterial spread of possible abscess
to the vascular system.

##. Left lung atelectasis: Following Mr. [**Known lastname **] rigid bronch his
Chest X-ray was notable for complete atelectasis. Pt's clinical
pulmonary exam however showed adequate aeration and saturation.
Pt was discharged following a course of incentive spirometry,
PEP therapy and respiratory therapy.

##. Anemia: Pt was noted to be anemic during hospitalization
requiring a 1unit of PRBC transfusion. Hemolysis labs for anemia
work up was negative, pt's anemia most likely due to his
chemotherapy.

##. Latent TB: Pt reported a history of a positive TB test with
only a month of treatment. As pt will also be undergoing
chemotherapy treatment for latent TB was started, pt currently
on a 9 month course of Isoniazid and Pyridoxine. Pt will also be
followed up in [**Hospital **] clinic.

Discharge Condition:
Stable, febrile.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for fevers and a mass in the
left upper part of your lung.  Whilst in the hospital you were
given antibiotics but you still continued to have fevers. You
had two bronchoscopies which showed that there was a mass that
was blocking the left upper lobe of your lung. The blockage may
be from an abscess or your tumour. You will be seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1852**] on [**2117-10-12**] to see if a surgeon can remove the
mass which is likely the cause of your fevers. We checked your
blood multiple times which showed no bacteria in your blood
system. Your fevers are most likely from the mass, you have
