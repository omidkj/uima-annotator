Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain, some nausea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 84 year old male transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for management of undetermined biliary tree injury.
Patient was originally admitted on [**2151-6-23**] with
chest pain. Cardiac cath revealed LAD and LCX disease. Pain
continued and patient was diagnosed with acute cholecystitis.
Patient underwent a laproscopic cholecystectomy [**2151-7-1**] which
was complicated by small bowel enterotomy. The procedure was
converted to open, with repair of the enterotomy and completion
of the cholecystectomy. Postoperatively, a intrabdominal bile
collection was diagnosed and a 7mm stent was placed on [**2151-7-14**].
 Patient presented again to [**Hospital3 15402**] on [**2151-8-28**], and underwent
a CT guided percutaneous drain placement for a RUQ abscess.  At
that time patient was still having seropurulent drainage.

Patient was readmitted to [**Hospital3 15402**]  a third time on [**2151-9-12**]
with low grade fevers, and RUQ pain.  He was found to have a WBC
count of 26.2 with a left shift.  Abdominal/pelvic CT showed no
fluid collection or free air, but some slight inflammatory
changes around the drain. The stent was in place, with no
duodenal erosion. Patient was placed on unasyn and  flagyl
empirically.  Patient underwent an ERCP to remove the biliary
stent on [**2151-9-14**].  Following this, he had copious drainage from
the pigtail catheter, suggesting an ongoing bile leak, possibly
from the R hepatic duct. Patient was transferred to [**Hospital3 **]
Deconess for further evaluation and treatment. Urinalysis and
culture was negative, chest xray revealed bibasilar atelectasis
vs scarring. Blood cultures remained negative after 48 hrs.
