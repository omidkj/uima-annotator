Brief Hospital Course:
81 year-old male admitted to the SICU on [**10-1**] for neuro checks
every hour, initial INR:1.5 FFP given to reverse INR<1.3 to be
able to evacuated subdural hemorrhage, nipride drip to keep SBP
<160.

Pateint status post left subdural hematoma evacuation under
general anesthesia without intra-op complition on [**2147-10-2**].

POD1: alert, attentive, follows commands intermittently, opens
eyes, moves all extremities L>R, remains intubated.Head CT shows
evacuation of a large left subdural hematoma with near complete
resolution of the midline shift.

POD2/3: Tmax 101.5-->CXR: Right lower lobe opacification
reflecting likely developing pneumonia.  Started on
Levofloxacin.  Extubated.  Sputum cx shows:
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary) showed ENTEROBACTER
CLOACAE.MODERATE GROWTH, and  GRAM NEGATIVE ROD which is
Sensitive to Levaquin.

POD4 ([**10-5**]): Tmax 98.7. Transfer to step down.  Repeat CT: The
drainage catheter has been removed. There is no significant
short interval change in the mixed attenuation left convexity
subdural hematoma. Again seen in the left temporal lobe is a
focal area of likely evolving infarct, possibly from compromise
of the inferior branch of the left middle cerebral artery due to
the large subdural hemorrhage or coexistent embolic process. No
new areas of hemorrhage are seen. There is no change in the
amount of local mass effect or shift of normally midline
structures.Neurologically aawake, unable to follow commands,
moving all extremities. Patient intermittently became agitated,
confuse.

POD5 ([**10-6**]): Tmax 98. taransferred to floor status. Pt improving
clinically.  More awake today,no agititation, answers questions,
moves all extremities to command.  Increased lopressor to 50 [**Hospital1 **]
for BP control which is started in this admission can be
discontinued after blood presurre normalized.

Pyhisical therapy consulted for safety and needs for rehab.PT
recommended rehab. Patient eating well.Foley catheter removed
[**10-6**] due to void [**2142**] [**10-6**], please follow up.
