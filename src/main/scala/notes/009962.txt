Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2758**]
Chief Complaint:
Right hip pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Operative insertion of short trochanteric femoral nail into
right femoral neck.
2. Intubation

History of Present Illness:
88 yo female with a history of dementia, diabetes, hypertension,
COPD, asbestosis, GERD and anemia who presented to [**Hospital **] [**3-1**] with hip fracture and found to have elevated
cardiac enzymes.
.
In brief, she had an apparently mechanical fall at home injuring
her right hip and was brought to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 75865**] Hospital where
initial vitals were T98.4 P82 BP162/63, SaO282% on RA, CT showed
a subtle non-displaced intertrochanteric fracture of the right
hip. She was admitted with a plan for surgical repair however
troponinI trended 0.04->0.14->0.18->0.14->0.08. ECHO was
performed but was technically limited showing an LVEF 60% and
diastolic dysfunction. Orthopedic surgery was concerned about
her operative risk and requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for
cardiology evaluation and clearance. On the day of transfer, UA
was grossly positive for UTI and she was started on levaquin
500mg IV Q24H.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient vitals were T99.5 HR108 135/63
rr20 SaO295%3LNC. She is confused but easily redirected. She
complained of pain "all over". She was able to confirm that she
fell at home and was brought to [**Location (un) **]. She reports mild
dyspnea, denies cough, chest pain, pleuritic chest pain.
.
Review of Systems
Positive for chills, orthopnea, ankle edema
.
Negative for cough, chest pain, pleuritic chest pain, paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea. All other review of systems negative.

IMAGING:
[**2147-3-3**] CXR: Frontal view of the chest compared to prior study
from [**2147-3-1**]. Aorta is tortuous and ectatic. There is shift of
the mediastinum to the right. There is atelectasis of the right
lower lobe. There is mild atelectasis of the left lung as well.
There is patchy airspace opacity in the right lower lobe.
Further evaluation with CT may be helpful.
.
[**2147-3-3**] CTA Chest:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism, though assessment limited
by motion.
2. Pleural thickening and caclification may be due to prior
asbestos exposure.
3. No gross pulmonary consolidation.
4. 1.4-cm right-sided thyroid nodule, incompletely imaged. This
could be further assessed by non-emergent ultrasound if
indicated.
5. Multilevel thoracic vertebral body compression of
indeterminate age.
.
[**2147-3-4**] KUB: Single abdominal radiograph demonstrates air within
the stomach, dilated bowel segments either colonic or small
bowel, nonspecific bowel gas pattern. The radiograph is degraded
by motion.
.
[**2147-3-5**] CT Abdomen/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of obstruction or abscess.

2. Distended gallbladder - if concern for cholecystitis, should
assess by ultrasound.

3. Pleural-based calcification, and basal atelectasis with
possible
superimposed mild consolidation at right base. Small left
pleural effusion.

4. Recent gamma nail fixation of right intertrochanteric femoral
fracture.

5. Multiple wedge compression deformities involving T12, L2 and
L4, age indeterminate, with osseous retropulsion at L2 and L4,
and resultant spinal canal stenosis.

6. Likely 18mm hyperdense renal cyst in the lower pole of the
left kidney, though ultrasound on non-emergent basis is
recommended for confirmation.

7. Mild dilation of the left ureter to the level of UVJ, without
associated obstructing mass visualized. Recommend correlation
with urine cytology and non-emergent urology consultation.
.
TTE [**2147-2-6**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE:
88 yo female with a history of dementia, diabetes, hypertension,
COPD, asbestosis, GERD, and anemia, who presented to [**Hospital **] on [**3-1**] with a hip fracture and was found to have mild
elevation in troponins and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac
evaluation prior to hip surgery. She was originally admitted to
the cardiology service and was thought to have demand ischemia
in setting of tachycardia. She underwent ORIF, which was
complicated by hypoxia after extubation requiring reintubation
and transfer to MICU. Pt was quickly re-extubated, but remained
hypoxic on 4LNC and transferred to medicine floors for further
management. On the medical floors, pt was diuresed with lasix,
and able to maintain O2 sats in low 90s on 2LNC. She continued
to have agitation, and Geriatrics was consulted. Her Seroquel
dose was increased, and this improve
