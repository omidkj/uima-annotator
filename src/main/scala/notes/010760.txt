History of Present Illness:
50 yo man with progressive weakness. Symptoms started one month
ago with slurred speech . Then he noticed difficulty lifting a 2
pound rope at work (fisherman, labor intensive work). Was "weak
all over" and was worse in the afternoon. + blurry vision,
fatigue. No diplopia. + difficulty chewing a steak dinner, got
worse the longer he was chewing. 2 weeks ago noted a right hand
cramp when washing his face. He began to isolate himself. His
son brought him to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER as he was so weak he was bobbing
his head, unable to keep it upright, and could not talk. He
presented to an OSH ED 2 times, and then to his PCP with workup
including negative lyme titers and MRI brain (normal). His PCP
diagnosed him with depression and he was started on lexapro
several days before admission.

No SOB or respiratory compromise. No fevers, chills, sweats,
tick bites, trauma, rash, recent infections.

Radiology

MRI brain (from [**Hospital 1474**] hospital): some tiny white spots on T2
bilaterally on FLAIR lateral to ventricles on one slice only,
otherwise clear to my read.

CXR: unusual contour

CT chest: 6x3cm mass anterior mediastinum

Abdominal x-ray: Suboptimal study. No evidence of ischemia.

EKG Results: Sinus rhythm, Possible left atrial abnormality,
Poor R wave progression possible anterior infarct, inferior T
wave changes are nonspecific

Echocardiogram: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal.

Brief Hospital Course:
50 year old man with worsening weakness over one month that
appears consistent with myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**].  Diagnosis was
confirmed by observing rapidly worsening fatigue with repeated
movements, tensilon test, and positive anti-acetylcholine
receptor antibody test.  Chest CT evaluating for presence of
MG-associated thymoma was positive for a 6 x 3 cm mass.  This
patient was treated as follows:

A) Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **]
1) Mestinon: Received course of mestinon with marked relief of
symptoms.  Dose increased gradually to discharge dose of 90 mg
ever 4 hours.

2) Plasmapheresis: Underwent two rounds of plasmapheresis via
peripheral route on [**11-21**] and [**11-23**].  During first round had
transient episode of hypotension and diaphoresis.  This was
followed by transient elevation of pancreatic enzymes (AST, ALT,
Amylase, Lipase) that resolved; a KUB was performed to rule out
the possbility of bowel ischemia.  Second round completed
without difficulty.  Strength appeared to improve following each
round.  Three additional rounds of plasmapheresis were given as
described below.

3) Surgery: Underwent successful resection of 6 x 3 cm anterior
mediastinal mass on [**11-24**] via a medial sternotomy.  Pathology
completed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 533**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] showed no capsular invasion and a
benign pattern.  The patient recovered under care of
cardiothoracic surgery team and returned to care of neurology
team.

4) Myesthenic Crisis and Pneumonia: On post-op day [**11-27**], Mr.
[**Known lastname 60090**] had some difficulty breathing and was noted to have
marked fatigue of his muscles, consistent with a myesthenic
crisis.  He was intubated to preserve his airway and transfered
to the surgical intensive care unit, where he received 2
additional rounds of plasmapheresis.  During his SICU admission,
Mr. [**Known lastname 60090**] was noted to have coarse sounds in his right
hemithorax; a portable chest x-ray showed a pattern that was
suspicious for pneumonia.  A sputum culture was obtained and was
positive for S. pneumoniae. Mr. [**Known lastname 60090**] was initally treated
empirically with vancomycin and levoquin pending culture
results, and was then changed to ceftriaxone once species and
sensitivities were established.  Mestinon dosing was also
increased, and respiratory failure improved and pt was extubated
and transferred back to the care of the neurology team.

5) Post-SICU Care: Mr. [**Known lastname **] returned to the neurology service
where he continued recovery.  He was noted to have cough,
surgical site pain, and difficulty sleeping.  He also complained
of diarrhea.  He was given Guaifenesin for his cough, percoset
for pain, trazadone for sleep, and loperamide for diarrhea; each
of these problems subsequently resolved.  Improvement in pain
control resulted in marked improvement in his breathing, as it
became apparent that he had difficulty breathing earlier because
of his pain.

B) Cardiovascular
Prior to surgery, a cardiovascular workup was performed given
Mr. [**Known lastname 60091**] family history of early cardiac death.  Lipid
profile was normal.  EKG showed slowed R wave progression.
Echocardiogram was reassuring, but showed mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy.  Mr and Mrs [**Known lastname 60090**] were advised about
the eventual need for stress test after current hospitalizationa
and advised to follow up with about cardiovascular health. He
was also started on metoprolol for some peri-operative
hypertension, which we will continue given his family history,
and allow his PCP to make changes as needed.

C) Depression
Continued lexapro per primary care physician's prescription.
