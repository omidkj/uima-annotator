Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer from OSH for brain lesion on CT

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left cerebellar craniotomy with excision of lesion


History of Present Illness:
HPI: 77 yo R-handed female who presented to an OSH with
nausea/vomiting and diarrhea since midnight, diagnosed as
gastroenteritis but given her complaint of headache she had a
non-contrast head CT which showed a L cerebellar lesion. No
family member
present at this time for further history but the patient denies
chest pain/SOB, gait unsteadiness, vertigo/lightheadedness. No
fever or other constitutional symptoms. There was comment on the
OSH report about 5 mm midline shift but this was not appreciated
on her repeat NCHCT. Tx'd w/ Zofran and Decadron 10 mg iv. She
was noted to have BP up to 213/101 treated w/  Labetalol.   At
baseline, pt oriented x 1.

MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2158-12-16**] 2:54 PM
Reason: eval masses, bleed
Contrast: MAGNEVIST

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
77 year old woman with F w/new cerebellar lesions on CT with
Bleed. Exam for further evaluation per Neurosurgery
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval masses, bleed
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

EXAM: MRI of the brain.

CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with left cerebellar lesion, for
further evaluation.

TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and
diffusion axial images were obtained before gadolinium. T1 axial
and coronal images were obtained following gadolinium. The
post-gadolinium images are somewhat limited by motion.

FINDINGS: As seen on the previous CT, there is an area of
hemorrhage seen in the left cerebellar hemisphere with
surrounding edema and mild mass effect on the fourth ventricle
with some effacement of the left side of the fourth ventricle.
Following gadolinium, subtle adjacent enhancement is suspected
on the medial aspect of the lesion, but the evaluation is
limited secondary to motion artifacts.

There are moderate changes of small vessel disease and brain
atrophy. No midline shift or hydrocephalus is seen.

There is no evidence of acute infarct on diffusion images.

IMPRESSION: Left cerebellar area of blood products with
surrounding edema and mild effacement of the left side of the
fourth ventricle. Subtle enhancement is suspected surrounding
the lesion suspicious for underlying abnormality. However, the
evaluation is limited by motion. A repeat post- gadolinium study
is recommended for further assessment.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2158-12-23**] 12:20 PM
Reason: f/u
Contrast: MAGNEVIST

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
77 year old woman post-op excision L cerebellar tumor
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
f/u
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

EXAM: MRI of the brain.

CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient is status post resection of left
cerebellar mass.

TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and
diffusion axial images of the brain were acquired before
gadolinium. T1 sagittal, axial and coronal images were obtained
following the administration of gadolinium. Correlation was made
with the patient's preoperative MRI of [**2158-12-22**].

FINDINGS: Since the previous study, the patient has undergone
postoperative changes with the left-sided occipital craniotomy.
Blood products are seen in the left cerebellar hemisphere with
small amount of air from recent surgery. There is edema seen in
the left cerebellar hemisphere with minimal mass effect on the
left side of the fourth ventricle which has remained unchanged
from previous study. Following gadolinium administration, no
definite area of residual enhancement identified in the surgical
bed. There is no other abnormal area of enhancement seen. There
is mild-to-moderate prominence of ventricles identified with
prominence of temporal horns. The ventricular system appears to
be slightly more prominent than before. There is periventricular
hyperintensities visualized as before. There is no midline shift
seen.

Bilateral extensive soft tissue changes are identified in the
mastoid air cells.

IMPRESSION:
1. Status post resection of left cerebellar mass with blood
products at the surgical site with small amount of air from
recent surgery. No residual enhancement seen. No change in the
appearance of edema or mass effect identified.
2. Slightly more prominent ventricular system compared to the
preoperative MRI of [**2158-12-22**]. This is more apparent in the region
of temporal horns. Clinical correlation and a followup CT
recommended.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2158-12-24**] 8:04 AM
Reason: LEFT CEREBELLAR MASS RESECTION, EVALUATE FOR POST OP
CHANGES

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
77 year old woman s/p Left cerebellar mass resection
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
post op changes
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Status post cerebellar tumor excision. Evaluate for
interval change.

COMPARISON: CT of the head [**2158-12-22**] and MRI of the brain [**2158-12-23**].

NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: Left occipital craniotomy is consistent
with the history of left cerebellar resection. Pneumocephalus in
the resection site is slightly decreased compared to the prior
exam and there is a similar degree of mass effect on the fourth
ventricle. No evidence of tonsillar herniation is seen. The
overall ventricular size is unchanged. High-density foci at the
biopsy site are consistent with hemorrhage. There is no shift of
normally midline structures. Cerebral periventricular
hypoattenuation is consistent with chronic microvascular
infarction. Moderate-sized left parietal subgaleal fluid
collection has appeared, compared with the prior examination,
measuring 9 mm in greatest diameter; however, there is no
high-density material within it to suggest acute hemorrhage
