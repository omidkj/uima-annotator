Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion, pain in calf


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 72-year-old man who complains of [**1-3**] weeks of
dyspnea on exertion, as well as swelling and soreness of his
left calf for approximately one week. He went to his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**]
referred him here to rule out DVT. He also notes some mild lower
abdominal cramping that has been intermittent for approximately
three weeks and that has since resolved, and some nonbloody
diarrhea. The patient has never had any previous DVTs or PEs. He
denies fever, chills, chest pain, pleuritic pain, nausea,
vomiting, hematochezia, melena. The patient deneis any long time
spent immobile, any recent flights.
.
In the ED, initial vital signs were 92 154/72 17 98% RA. The
patient's LENIs demonstrated a significant DVT. The CTA showed a
saddle pulmonary embolism. Though he has been hemodynamically
stable in the Emergency Department, the CTA suggested right
heart strain and atrial enlargement. Because of concern of heart
failure secondary to his saddle PE, the patient was admitted to
the ICU.
.
On the floor, the patient was pleasant, in no acute distress. He
was having continued pain in his left leg and was still
experiencing dyspnea on exertion. He denies any worsening of his
symptoms since his arrival at the hospital.

LENIs: Deep venous thrombus involving the left superficial

emboli. Possible mild right heart strain


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 72-year-old man with a family history of
clotting disorders presenting with known DVT and saddle
pulmonary embolism.
.
# PE/DVT: The patient had a proven saddle embolus on CTA, likely
migrated from the patient's lower left leg, which demonstrated a
DVT.  He was started on a heparin drip and transferred to the
ICU.  He did well in the ICU and had no hemodynamic instability.
 He was bridged to warfarin.  On discharge, he will continue
lovenox 1 mg/kg [**Hospital1 **] with coumadin.  He will follow-up with PCP
and coumadin clinic for titration.  He was provided with patient
education handout on coumadin and frequent medication/diet
interactions.  Hematology/oncology was consulted who agreed with
above plan (goal INR [**1-3**], bridge patient to warfarin with
Lovenox 150mg SC q12h, follow-up in [**Hospital3 **]
follow-up for warfarin management). Of note, patient will
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 15672**] at [**Hospital1 2025**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 15673**]) in [**1-3**] months for
discussion of duration of therapy and need for further testing.
He will require at minimum 3-6 months of therapy, and possibly,
life-long therapy. Also of note he has a family history of
factor V, and is in fact heterozygous himself which may be the
etiology.
.
# DVT: The patient has been symptomatic for at least one week
with calf pain and had an extensive clot on the left extending
from the superficial femoral to the popliteal vein.  He was
placed on a heparin drip and bridged to warfarin as above.
.
# Sleep apnea: The patient was on CPAP at night throughout his
stay.
.
# Type 2 diabetes: His sugars were controlled on an insulin
sliding scale.  His metformin was held in the event that he
needed further imaging. He will continue his oral agents for
diabetes on discharge.
.
# Hypertension: Patient has home regimen of epleronone and
valsartan.  These were continued on discharge.
.
# History of possible tachyarrhythmia: continued on digoxin
throughout his stay.
.
# GERD: He continued his home regimen of omeprazole.
.
# Transitional Issues:
- patient to follow-up with [**Hospital3 **] for INR
monitoring
- patient to follow-up with  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 15672**] at [**Hospital1 2025**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 15673**]) in
[**1-3**] months for discussion of duration of therapy and need for
further testing. He will require at minimum 3-6 months of
therapy, and possibly, life-long anticoagulation therapy.
