pericardial effusion.
.
ETT [**2128-4-20**]: [**Doctor Last Name 4001**] protocol. 6.5 min. Limited physical working
capacity.  Peak MET 3.0 (37% of age predicted max).  No anginal
type symptoms, sustained ectopy or interpretable ST segment
changes.  Compared to previous in [**5-24**], marked reduction in
physical working capacity.

Cath [**2128-4-27**]
 Resting hemodynamics demonstrated moderate pulmonary
 arterial hypertension (46/24 mmHg), elevated right-sided
filling
 pressures (RA mean 16 mmHg, RVEDP 19 mmHg, PCWP mean 27 mmHg
with v
 waves up to 38 mmHg).  Cardiac output was markedly diminished
at 1.9
 L/min with a cardiac index of 1.4 L/min/m2.
 FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1.  Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   2.  Biventricular diastolic dysfunction and low cardiac
output.

Brief Hospital Course:
35 yo female with h/o ICM who was transferred to the CCU s/p
cath with low cardiac output and low cardiac index and elevated
wedge pressures..
1. CHF/ICM: Given her low CO, she was started on dobutamine in
the cath lab for inotropic support. CI and CO improved on
dobutamine. She was able to be weaned off dobutamine on HD 6.
Her symptoms were stable and it was felt she did not require
home dobutamine at this time. Although she was not fluid
overloaded on exam, she was diuresed intermittently with low
dose lasix. We initially held her coreg, but it was restarted on
discharge for arrhythmia control. We continued low dose
aldactone at 12.5 mg per day. We also increased her losartan
slowly for afterload reduction, and on discharge was taking 25
mg QAM. A biventricular pacemaker was implanted on [**2128-4-30**] to
help with synchrony of the ventricles.
2. Cardiac Transplant workup: This was started while in house.
She did have a + PPD of 13 mm. SHe notes that she has had PPDs
before and were previously negative. She was in [**Country 651**] in
[**Month (only) **] and her father had a history of TB. Her CXR was
negative and she had no symptoms. She was started on INH and B6,
was seen by the infectious disease consult service. She will
follow up with them and should complete a 9 month course.
3. Rhythm: She has a history of palpitations. She was recently
started on coumadin as an outpatient for possible atrial
fibrillation. She was briefly on a heparin drip but was very
sensitive to the heparin and her PTTs were persistently
supratherapeutic so anticoagulation was held. She did not have
any episodes of afib while in house. She did have several
episodes of NSVT on telemetry. Her electrolytes were repleted.
She was restarted on coumadin at discharge on her home regimen
of alternating 1 mg QHS and 2 mg QHS. She will follow up in
coumadin clinic in 4 days.
4. Thrombocytopenia: Her platelets dropped to a nadir of 69 from
135 on admission. Given she was on heparin, we checked a HIT
antibody that was negative. Her platelets were rising at time of
discharge.
