Pertinent Results:
[**2129-6-6**] Carotid Ultrasound
1. Mild heterogeneous plaque in the right internal carotid
artery with less than 40% stenosis. 2. Significant heterogeneous
plaque in the left internal carotid artery with 70-79% stenosis.
This is a baseline examination at the [**Hospital1 18**].
=====================================
[**2129-6-7**] ECHO
PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is markedly dilated. Moderate to
severe spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is present
in the left atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying
velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). A left atrial appendage
thrombus cannot be excluded.
2. The right atrium is markedly dilated. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the right atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF=
35-40 %). There is calcification of the inferior midventricular
segment.
4. The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free
wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal systolic septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure
overload.
5. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.

POST-CPB: On infusions of phenylephrine and epinephrine, AV
pacing, preserved biventricular systlic function compared with
pre-bypass, LVEF = 35-40%, MR remains mild, aortic contour
normal post decannulation, no evidence of hematoma or dissection
of aortic wall.
=========================================
[**2129-7-8**] Head CT Scan:
There is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, shift of normally
midline structures, edema, mass effect, or evidence of acute
infarct. There  is periventricular and subcortical white matter
change as well as there is an old left basal ganglia infarct
noted. There is no evidence of acute vascular territorial
infarct. The mastoid air cells are hypoplastic bilaterally. The
right maxillary sinus is opacified. Ethmoid and sphenoid sinus
opacification is also noted. The bony calvarium is intact.

         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.
         PIPERACILLIN AVAILABLE ON REQUEST.
