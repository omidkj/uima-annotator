Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
fevers, altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p cardiac catheterization with intraaortic balloon pump

History of Present Illness:
This is an 84-year-old woman with history of HTN, COPD,
recurrent breast cancer and ETOH related dementia, admitted to
the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] [**Hospital1 18**] with fever, altered mental status, a
productive cough and elevated WBC, thought to have PNA. She had
been recently admitted with a LUE cellulitis. On the day of
admission her oxygen saturation dropped to 90% on 2L, and she
was wheezy with labored breathing. A CTA was obtained and found
to be negative for PE. After the CTA she was noted to have
increased work of breathing and crackles on exam. She was
thought to be in CHF, possibly secondary to the dye/volume load
during the CTA. An EKG was obtained and showed troponin 0.63
with positive CKs. The decision was made to go to cath.
The patient also complained of vague abdominal pain and a CT
Abdomen suggested a cecal mass.

IMAGING STUDIES:
.
[**6-4**] Head CT: There is no interval change. There is no acute
intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. Left temporal
encephalomalacia and extensive periventricular white matter
hypodensities are again noted. The ventricles are stable in
size. The imaged bones and extracranial soft tissues appear
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No interval change.
.
[**6-4**] CT Abd/Pelvis:
1. Equivocal focus of cecal wall thickening may be simply
secondary to underfilling with contrast, however a concentric
mass cannot be excluded. Inflammation seems less likely as no
pericolonic stranding seen. Recommend correlation with
colonoscopy.
2. Small right adrenal nodule may represent adenoma, though it
is
incompletely characterized. Are there any prior for comparison?

3. Multiple small hypoattenuating renal lesions too small to
characterize but likely represent cysts.
4. Evidence of prior granulomatous infection.
.
CTA [**2156-6-5**]:
1.  No evidence of central pulmonary embolism. The study is
limited due to motion artifact. 2.  Unchanged appearance of the
radiation changes in the right upper lobe. 3.  Atherosclerotic
changes involving the aorta and coronary arteries. 5.  Equivocal
bilateral septal thickening predominantly on the right with
bilateral small pleural effusions right greater than left, may
represent mildCHF.

[**2156-6-3**] EKG:  initiall read as: sinus [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] elevations
inferiorly. Official read: Sinus tachycardia. Left atrial
abnormality. Prior inferior wall myocardial infarction. Low
precordial lead voltage. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2156-5-24**] the rate has increased. There is occasional atrial
ectopy. Otherwise, no diagnostic interim change.

CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2156-6-5**] demonstrated:
LMCA normal
LAD mild disease
LCx mild disease
RCA: mild disease
IABP placed.
LV-gram: severe mitral regurgitation EF 50%
Hemodynamics: markedly elevated filling pressures, giant v
waves, severe Pulm HTN
C.O 3.60  C.I. 1.69
PCWP mean 41
PA pressure 64/30;  mean 46
TTE performed on [**2155-11-17**] demonstrated:  lipomatous hypertrophy
of interatrial septum, mild symmetrical LVH with normal cavity
size + LV function (EF>55%), normal RV size and free wall
motion, normal AV with no AS or AR, normal MV, trivial MR.

TTE performed on [**2156-6-7**] demonstrated:
The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is
11-15mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal
cavity size and low normal systolic function (LVEF 50%). Due to
suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad. Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2155-11-17**], the severity of mitral regurgitation
has increased and the heart rate is much higher. The left
ventricle is less vigorous (may be related to tachycardia). If
clinically indicated, a TEE would be better able to define the
mitral valve morphology and to exclude possible
endocarditis/vegetations.
.
CXR:
[**6-4**] CXR: Left basilar atelectasis and possible tiny pleural
effusion. No evidence for pneumonia or CHF.
.
[**6-5**] CXR: Cardiomegaly with mild interstitial prominence without
overt pulmonary edema.

[**6-6**] CXR: Mild prominence of the pulmonary interstitial markings,
particularly within the left lung, suggestive of minimal
pulmonary edema.  No focal consolidation is identified.  There
are no
pneumothoraces seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
84 y old F with h/o HTN, COPD, EtOH-related dementia, admitted
to [**Hospital1 18**] ([**Hospital Ward Name 516**]) on [**2156-6-4**] for fever, MS changes and
productive cough, found post CTA to have positive cardiac
enzymes, ST elevations on EKG, and sent to cath for evaluation
of revascularization. Cath revealed clean coronaries and severe
mitral insufficiency. Hospital course by problem:

#) Mitral valve insufficiency: Because initial cath suggested 4+
mitral regurgitation, an IABP was placed for afterload reduction
and CT [**Doctor First Name **] was consulted for consideration of MVR. Differential
