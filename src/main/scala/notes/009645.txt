Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5129**]
Chief Complaint:
"found unresponsive"

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation, extubated.


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname 22924**] is an 81 yof who was found unresponsive in her
nursing home bed. Per report, she was hypoglycemic (glucose 50)
and was noted to be "acting inappropriately." The patient
remembers "passing out," and experiencing right arm
stiffness/numbness, but no other details surrounding the
incident. On arrival of EMS, her Blood Glucose was found to be
20, she was given 1mg glucagon/1 amp D50 and was brought to the
ED. Vital signs were all stable and she remained afebrile, O2
Sat was 99% 10L NRB, FSG 150. On presentation, EKG was without
acute ischemic changes. The patient was responsive to pain, w/o
response to narcan, and intubated for airway protection. CT head
was negative; RIJ placed for access. Repeat BS 21, given D10 gtt
and 2 bolus dextrose. She was then given 100mg hydrocortisone x
1, vanc and zosyn, and was admitted to the ICU.

ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is markedly
dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. There is
abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Severe [4+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. Pulmonary hypertension cannot be reliably
assessed given degree of TR. There is a small pericardial
effusion.

CT HEAD:
CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is no intracranial mass
effect, edema, hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline
structures, major vascular
territorial infarct, or acute hemorrhage. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation is preserved. Hypodensities are present in the
supratentorial white matter and the inferior right lentiform
nucleus, likely related to chronic microvascular ischemic
disease in a patient of this age. Intracranial vascular
calcifications are seen.
The surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are
unremarkable. The
visualized paranasal sinuses are clear.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.
2. Chronic small vessel ischemic disease.

CXR:
FINDINGS: Portable AP view of the chest in upright position was
obtained.
There is marked cardiomegaly. Tortuous aorta with
calcifications. The
pulmonary vasculature is normal. There is no pneumothorax or
consolidation. Opacity in the left lung base may represent
atelectasis, pleural effusion or penumonia. The osseous
structures demonstrate diffuse demineralization.

CT AB/PELV:
IMPRESSION:
1. There is no free air in the abdomen to suggest a bowel
perforation. There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.
2. There is a moderate amount of ascites fluid within the
abdomen, which
measures up to 20 Hounsfield units in density. The fluid could
be
proteinaceous or serosanguineous given this density. Please
correlate
clinically, as the etiology of ascites is indeterminate on this
study.
3. Marked atherosclerotic disease involving the abdominal aorta
and extending into the SMA. Vascular patency cannot be assessed
on this study.
4. Marked cardiomegaly and a moderate-to-large pericardial
effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname 22924**] is an 81 yof with h/o DM2, CHF, CKD, AF (on
coumadin), p/w unresponsiveness and found to be hypoglycemic
(BG<20). She was intubated for respiratory failure [**1-15**] CHF
exacerbation and admitted to the MICU. Her MICU course was
significant for diuresis and treatment of UTI (CFX). Patient
transferred to floor in a stable condition.
.
# CHF/tricuspid regurgitation/pulmonary HTN - Based on patient's
report, her CHF had been exacerbated over the past few months,
with an increase in weight and swelling of her LE/abdomen. The
history of her heart failure is not completely clear from
history, but is likely a longstanding issue. She typically
receives care at [**Hospital1 336**]. Echo from [**9-19**] revealed dilated right
ventricle with mild systolic dysfunction, preserved left
ventricular global and regional systolic function, severe
tricuspid (+4) regurgitation, and small pericardial effusion.
She was diuresed slowly over her hospitalization.  We kept her
torsemide dose at 40mg to prevent from overdiuresing her.  Her
aldactone was restarted and her digoxin was restarted.  She was
able to be weaned off oxygen and was satting well on room air.

# DM: Pt. with episode of hypoglycemia precipitating admission,
with acute mental status changes. Unclear as to why patient
became hypoglycemic - poor po intake, change in medications, CHF
exacerbation, etc. Now with elevated glucoses post-extubation,
presumably from improving renal functio
