HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 54-year-old
female without significant past medical history who presented
to [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Department
on [**1-6**] with complaints of fever and increasing
shortness of breath.  Chest x-ray at her primary care
pneumonia.  She took one dose of Levofloxacin at home, but
her family noted persistent temperature at 103.0 F and mental
status change so they brought the patient to the Emergency
Department.

At the Emergency Department, the patient received Ceftriaxone
and evaluation by MICU Team given her vital signs with a
80/42.  Oxygen saturations were 90 to 03% on four liters
nasal cannula.  She was transferred to the MICU on [**1-7**] where she was intubated secondary to worsening
respiratory distress and hypoxemic respiratory failure.  Due
to persistent hypotension, she was transiently maintained on
a Neo-Synephrine drip on [**1-7**] and [**1-8**].
Her systolic blood pressure has been stable since then and
her blood pressures were supportive of IV fluids.

Her respiratory status slowly improved and she was able
to be weaned from the ventilator and was extubated on
[**1-14**].  Studies performed in the MICU as part of her
evaluation and treatment included CT Scan of the chest on
[**1-7**] which showed consolidation of the right lower
lobe and part of right middle lobe with multiple patchy
opacities and ground-glass opacities bilaterally as well as
small bilateral pleural effusions, left more than right.  Of
note, the CT Scan was also significant for diffuse fatty
liver infiltration.

Bronchoscopy was done [**1-8**] which showed no
intrabronchial lesions.  TT was done on [**1-9**] and was
significant for an ejection fraction of 60%, no valvular
disease, normal LV and RV function, no pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.  PA catheter was placed on [**1-9**] through [**1-12**] to monitor the volume status.  This
showed increased CVP and decreased urine output.  This showed
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 18 to 20.

The patient also had decreased urine output, however she had
no rising creatinine.  Given her clinical improvement, she
was transferred to the floor on [**2122-1-15**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Viral meningitis.
2.  History of ectopic pregnancy.
3.  History of ovarian cyst.

MEDICATIONS AS OUTPATIENT:  Motrin p.r.n.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Married and lives with her husband.  Smokes
two to three packs per week for 40 years.  Denies alcohol
use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.6 F, heart rate 63,
blood pressure 140/80, respirations 18.  Saturations 96% on
three liters.  In general awake, alert, breathing comfortably
on three liters of nasal cannula.  Able to answer questions
appropriately in no acute distress.  Slow, but appropriate.
Extraocular movements intact.  Anicteric sclerae.  Oral
mucosa dry.  Neck supple.  Thyroid is palpable, mildly
enlarged without any palpable nodules.  No lymphadenopathy
noted.  Lung exam:  Crackles at the bases bilaterally and
right mid field, no wheezes.  Cardiac exam:  Regular rhythm
and rate, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended with positive bowel
sounds.  Extremities:  No edema with 2+ pulses in all four
extremities.  Neuro exam:  Cranial nerves II through XII
intact.  Sensation is intact in all four extremities.
Extremities:  Strength is 3 to [**5-16**] in all four extremities.

PERTINENT LABORATORIES:  White cell count 9.5, hematocrit
31.1, platelets 579, INR 1.1.  Sodium 144, potassium 4.1,
chloride 106, bicarbonate 27, BUN 10, creatinine 0.5, glucose
104, calcium 8.8, phosphorus 3.8, magnesium 2.2.

Microbiology data:  Clostridium difficile was negative on
[**1-12**].  Viral cultures sent on [**1-9**] and
negative for date, negative for influenza and B antigen.  BL
culture sent on [**1-8**].  Gram stain showed PMNs, but
no organisms, no AFB, no fungus was isolated.  Cultures
negative to date.  Legionella cultures negative to date.  PCP
IF test was negative.  Blood cultures times four drawn on
[**1-7**] negative to date.  Legionella urine antigen
negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was transferred from the MICU to the
floor on [**2122-1-15**] for pneumonia.  The patient was
continued on Azithromycin and Ceftriaxone, both started on
[**1-7**].  Her oxygen saturations improved over the next
two days with oxygen saturations at 96% on room air at the
time of this dictation.

2.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient had diffuse fatty liver
infiltration on CT Scan on [**1-6**] and mild transaminase.
At the time of admission, the liver function tests were
repeated and came back with ALT, AST normal at 25, alkaline
phosphatase normal at 79 and total bilirubin normal at 0.2.

3.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was admitted with anemia at
baseline with a hematocrit of 33.  Her hematocrit remained
stable with no symptoms or signs of bleeding.

4.  NEUROLOGIC:  The patient had profound weakness upon
transfer.  This with mild mental status changes was
contributed to a prolonged MICU stay and resolved on [**2122-1-16**] with improved muscle strength.  She was evaluated by
Physical Therapy who recommended acute rehab.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Pneumonia.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DIET:  Regular.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Miconazole powder 2% to apply as needed.
2.  Ceftriaxone 1 gram IV q. 12 hours, last day [**1-22**].
