Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
S/p emergent tracheostomy


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 86057**] is a 60 year old male w/ h/o COPD who presented with
sore throat for several days and stridor for 3 hours. No
vomiting, no CP, no abd pain. + Fever, chills.
.
In ED, vitals were, Temp:102.8 HR:90 BP:1421/P Resp:26-28
O(2)Sat:98 normal. Pt was dyspneic and noted to have biphasic
stridor.  ENT was consulted was who upon examination of the
patients oropharynx with fiberoptic scope, noted significant
supraglottic and epiglottic swelling with a 2 mm airway.
Preparations were made for emergent transfer to the OR. The pt
received IV ceftriaxone and unasyn as well as 10 mg IV
dexamethasone and nebulized racemic epi as a temporizing measure
in the ED.  The patient was noted to have increasing respiratory
distress on arrival to the OR.  Fiberoptic intubation was
attempted but unable to visualize arytenoids or pass a bougie.
Perc cric was then attempted with puncture of the airway through
the thyroid cartilage.  The patients sats dropped to 70s,
unclear if pt aspirated while in extremis. A temporary airway
was established and then converted to a formal tracheostomy.
The pt was then transferred to the MICU.

IMAGING/STUDIES:
# ECG ON [**2194-5-29**]:
Baseline artifact. Sinus rhythm. Left axis deviation. Late R
wave
progression. No previous tracing available for comparison.

.
# CXRAY [**2194-5-29**]:
SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST: Vascular engorgement and
minimal basal
interstitial abnormality could be due to cardiac decompensation,
although
heart size is only top normal. No pneumonia.

The laryngeal and subglottic airway looks diffusely narrowed and
should be
evaluated with conventional or CT radiography. Leftward
displacement of normal calibre trachea below the thoracic inlet
could be due to tortuous vasculature.

IMPRESSION:
1. Possible narrowing larnyngeal and subglottic airway should be
imaged
further.
2. Borderline cardiac decompensation.
.

#NECK SOFT TISSUE [**2194-5-29**]:
PORTABLE SINGLE LATERAL VIEW OF THE NECK: Only C1 through C4 is
visualized on this lateral view. The visualized prevertebral
soft tissues are within normal limits. The epiglottis is largely
obscured by overlying patient's shoulders. Degenerative changes
are noted throughout the visualized cervical spine.

IMPRESSION: Limited evaluation. Apparent soft tissue swelling of
the
anterior neck.
.

#PATHOLOGY Tracheal cartilage:
Respiratory mucosa with mild acute and chronic inflammation,
bone, and cartilage.
Clinical: Acute epiglottitis.
Gross:

The specimen is received fresh in a container labeled the
patient's name, "[**Known lastname 86057**], [**Known firstname **]", the medical record number and
"tracheal cartilage". It consists of two fragments of pink-tan
cartilage measuring 1.5 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm in aggregate. The
specimen is entirely submitted in cassette A.

#CXRAY ON [**2194-6-1**]:
One portable view. Comparison with [**2194-5-31**]. There is persistent
asymmetric
density at the right lung base suspicious for pneumonia. The
left lung
appears relatively clear on the current study. The heart and
mediastinal
structures are unchanged. A right subclavian catheter,
tracheostomy tube and nasogastric tube remain in place.

IMPRESSION: Persistent asymmetric density at the right base
suspicious for
pneumonia.
.
#UGI SGL CONTRAST W/ KUB Study Date of [**2194-6-5**] 4:25 PM
FINDINGS: The initial scout radiograph of mediastinal area was
performed.
Limited visualization of the lung bases. However, the previously
noted
asymmetric opacity in the right lung base is improved. No
pneumothorax or
subcutaneous emphysema is identified in the lower neck and
chest.

A barium swallow study was performed with thin liquid barium. On

administration of thin liquid barium, there was normal free
passage of barium through the oropharynx and the esophagus. No
definite leak is identified in the oropharynx or the esophagus.
There is no evidence of obstruction with contrast passing freely
into the stomach. Detailed evaluation of the motility of the
esophagus was not performed at this time.

IMPRESSION: Limited upper GI study, did not reveal contrast leak
from the
oropharynx or the esophagus.


Brief Hospital Course:
60 yo M w/ h/o COPD here with ST for several days, fever,
stridor with epiglottitis seen on fiberoptic scope s/p emergent
trach in OR prior to transfer to the MICU.
.
# Epiglottitis- Confirmed by fiberoptic scope by ENT in the ED
then again during emergent trach in the OR.  The trach was left
in place, with the balloon inflated x5d post admission for
airway protection while supraglottic and glottic edema resolved.
 The patient received high dose dexamethasone in the first 24
hours in the ICU to speed improvement in the airway edema.  He
was given IV unasyn x5d as well as IV vancomycin x4d (for
presumed aspiration during emergent airway procedure)  with plan
to transition to orals once pt passed barium swallow.  The
oropharynx was visualized again on HD6 with moderate but
resolving supraglottic edema seen. His antibiotics were changed
to Augmentin 875mg twice daily for total of 14 days (Day 1 was
on [**2194-6-4**]). On [**2194-6-5**] he had oropharynx was visualized and
supraglottic edema was improved. He had both tracheotosmy and NG
tube removed. Patient had Barium swallow study wich showed no
aspiration and no leakage. He was advanced to regular soft diet
which he tolerated well, he no difficulty swallowing. Patient
denies having any shortness of breath and his o2 sats have been
in mid 90s% while walking and while resting. Patient and family
wanted to leave today and drive to [**Location (un) 7349**]. He was given instruction
to follow
