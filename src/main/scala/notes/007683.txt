[**8-3**] SUPINE AND UPRIGHT ABDOMINAL RADIOGRAPHS.

There is a nonobstructive bowel gas pattern with no abnormally
dilated loops of bowel identified. A moderate amount of stool is
noted within the ascending and transverse colon. Trace amount of
air is noted distally within the region of the rectum. No
evidence of pneumatosis or pneumoperitoneum. There is stable
appearance to an IVC filter and mild levoscoliosis of the lumbar
spine.

IMPRESSION:

No signs of underlying obstruction. Moderate amount of stool
noted within the ascending and transverse colon. No
pneumoperitoneum.

[**8-3**] PA AND LATERAL CHEST: Patchy left lower lobe opacity is
again seen, probably unchanged from [**2107-7-28**], given
differences in technique between exams. This opacity was not
present in [**Month (only) **] or [**2106-7-24**], and most likely represents a focus
of pneumonia. There are no other consolidations, and no
congestive failure. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
unchanged, with a mildly tortuous aorta. No pleural effusions or
pneumothorax. Osseous structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe patchy opacity is unchanged from six
days ago, and likely represents pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
On presentation to the floor, the patient continued to complain
of chest and abdominal discomfort.  He was found not be
experiencing myocardial ischemia as evidenced by lack of cardiac
enzymes and ECG changes. He continued to complain of nausea, and
diahrrea, and it was felt that the patient was receiving an
inadequate dose of his methadone.  The patient reported thatthe
dose of his methadoen was in fact correct, however he was not
familiar with the dosage form being tablets of 40mg, as compared
to his usual tablets of 10mg.  His systolic blood pressure was
gradually lowered over a span of 4 days from the 170's to the
130's, with the addition of nifedipine and lisinopril to the
clonidine he was already taking.  He continued to complain of
light headedness while walking.  Physical therapy worked with
the patient daily and did not report decreased blood pressure or
decreased oxygen saturation on ambulation. Psychiatry met with
the patient on several occasions, though he was resistant to
speaking with them.  They eventually recommended he go to a pain
clinic, which could be handled as an outpatient. his TSH was
also found to be elevated and he was started on levothyroxine.
He was discharged on [**8-4**], afebrile, with stable vital signs and
systolic blood pressure in the 130's.  He was given instructions
to follow up with his new primary care physician on [**8-24**],
and to return to the hospital if he experiences any further
chest pain.
