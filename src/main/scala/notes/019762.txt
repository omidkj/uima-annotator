Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Levofloxacin / Seroquel

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**]
Chief Complaint:
bradycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old gentleman with atrial fibrillation, Mobitz II block,
chronic kidney disease (Cr 1.3), COPD, hypertension, and
dementia.
He presented from the [**Hospital1 **] dementia unit. Per the daughter, he
apparently felt dizzy with "waves coming at his head". Staff
attempted to have pt eat breakfast but he vomited. Couldn't
tolerate taking medications either. The facility performed stat
labs reportedly consistent with dehydration with K 6.3 and ARF.
HR 30 on Digoxin. [**2106-1-22**] dig level was 1.2
On presentation to the ED, the patient was bradycardic to HR
20's to 30's, sBP in 120's. EKG revealed complete Laboratories
notable for K of 6.3 with BUN of 65 and creatinine of 2.2.
Digoxin 3.5. Patient given calcium
gluconate/bicarbonate/dextrose along with Kayexelate. K to 4.5
two hours later. Heart rate to 80's with EKG now with rates in
80's with Mobitz II. Chest X-ray read as R pleural effusion.
Lactate rose from 1.2 to 3.5. Pt given levofloxacin which was
stopped mid-infusion when it was realized he had a known allergy
to this medication. Later patient passed a large stool and heart
rate fell to 40's, SBP unchanged; however, pt also seemed
cyanotic and became hypoxic to 80's. Given atropine and
monoclonal antibody to digoxin.
Pt placed on non-rebreather with normalization of oxygen. Given
benadryl, high dose steroids and continous combivent.
Per daughter, he is currently at his normal baseline with
respect to his baseline. He responds to simple questions, but is
unable to respond to commands.
Review of symptoms: Pt unable to provide.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.


Past Medical History:
1) COPD
2) Asthma
3) Dementia
4) Psoriasis
5) Glaucoma
6) Mobitz Type 2
7) Atrial fibrillation/flutter
8) CRI, baseline creatinine around 1.3

Social History:
Used to live alone in [**State 108**] with assistance from son. Sent up
here by same son and then told daughter that he could not
return. Sister is now the legal guardian. [**Name (NI) **] recently has been
living at rehab.
(From d/c summary of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2455**] Smoked a pipe approximately 70

Reports:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2106-3-12**] 10:25 PM
FINDINGS: This examination is markedly limited by patient motion
during image acquisition. Since the earlier examination of [**3-12**], a right-sided pleural effusion is probably little changed.
Slight blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus could represent
a tiny pleural effusion. The heart size and mediastinal contours
are grossly within normal limits. The appearance of increased
density at the right lung base could partially relate to patient
motion as it is less apparent on a repeated radiograph of [**3-13**], [**2105**], at 8:20 a.m. No definite pneumothorax is seen,
although evaluation is limited on this examination.
IMPRESSION: Technically limited study. No significant interval
change in bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left,
and probable no significant change in right lower lung
consolidation or atelectasis.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2106-3-12**] 5:56 PM
FINDINGS: Low lung volumes. Large right-sided pleural effusion
is seen with subjacent atelectasis. Left basilar ateleactasis
also noted. The cardiac silhouette cannot be completely
evaluated, but appears grossly unchanged. There is no
pneumothorax. The aorta is mildly tortuous with calcifications.
The pulmonary vasculature is normal. The osseous structures
demonstrate degenerative changes of the thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION: Large right-sided pleural effusion, bibasilar
atelectasis. Cannot exclude pneumonia at the right lung base. No
evidence of CHF.
.
ECG Study Date of [**2106-3-12**]  5:36:38 PM
Atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response. Underlying
right
bundle-branch block. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2105-11-26**] the
ventricular rate is markedly diminished.
TRACING #1
.
ECG Study Date of [**2106-3-12**]  5:52:34 PM
Sinus bradycardia with 2:1 block. Right bundle-branch block with
secondary
ST-T wave abnormalities. Compared to tracing #1 normal sinus
rhythm has
returned.
TRACING #2
.
ECG Study Date of [**2106-3-12**]  6:00:12 PM
Normal sinus rhythm with variable block. Right bundle-branch
block.
P waves are best appreciated in leads V1-V2. No diagnostic
change from
tracing #2.
TRACING #3.
.
ECG Study Date of [**2106-3-12**]  7:42:14 PM
Normal sinus rhythm with right bundle-branch block and secondary
ST-T wave
abnormalities. Compared to tracing #3 the variable block is no
longer
present.
TRACING #4
.
ECG Study Date of [**2106-3-12**]  9:59:54 PM
Sinus bradycardia with variable block and underlying right
bundle-branch block with 2:1 block. Compared to tracing #4 the
2:1 block is new. Clinical correlation is suggested.
TRACING #5
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2106-3-13**] 7:41 AM
FINDINGS:
Since the examination of several hours earlier, which was
limited by motion, as well as the examination of earlier on
[**3-12**], a right-sided pleural effusion is probably little
changed all
