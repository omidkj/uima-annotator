History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 75909**] is a 57 year old man with recent diagnosis of lung
cancer who presented to [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] with fevers, chills, and
non-productive cough. He initially felt a cough the morning of
admission, and over the course of the day felt worse and worse,
eventually developing a fever (to 102F) and chills. CXR
demonstrated a post-obstructive PNA. He received IV ceftriaxone,
4L normal saline after a hypotensive episode, and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and treatment.
.
In the ED, his initial vital signs were T99.7F, BP 115/55, HR
107, RR 24, Sat 96%4L. His blood pressure decreased to 91/72 and
a central line was placed. He required Levophed at rate
0.03mcg/hr. He was given 1g vancomycin and 600mg IV clindamycin
and sent to the MICU.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Denies shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, chills, pain.
.
In the MICU he was transiently started on pressors and his
pressures remained stable and responded to IVF boluses and w/
CVP at 2 and low PO intake, pt was intravascularly depleted. He
had bronchoscopy on [**11-16**] that confirmed the tumor obstruction on
the left and chest CT confirming mass and likely
post-obstructive PNA.  Pt had MRI and PET CT at OSH for staging
of his disease and will have stent placed [**11-17**] by interventional
pulmonology.

Past Medical History:
- Asthma/COPD
- Recently diagnosed squamous cell lung CA; diagnosed with cough
requiring ED visit; 18-lb weight loss;
- Positive PPD exposure on INH (had BCG in [**Country 5881**])-negative
smear for AFB on recent bronch
- History of PE on Lovenox


Social History:
Quit smoking 4 weeks ago, had 35 years x 2 ppd. Social EtOH, no
illicit drugs. Lives in [**Location 1411**]. Moved to US from [**Country 5881**] 40 years
ago. Has two daughters, one son, several grandchildren.

Family History:
Father died of/with laryngeal cancer

Physical Exam:
VITALS: T98.3F, BP 120/76 (on 0.03mcg/hr Levophed), HR 88, RR
21, Sat 96% 2LNC
GENERAL: Thin-appearing, no acute distress
HEENT: OP clear, EOMI, PERRL
NECK: JVP flat
CARD: RRR, normal S1/S2, no m/r/g
RESP: Decreased breath sounds on left throughout, clear on
right, no wheezes
ABD: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, + bowel sounds
EXT: No peripheral edema


Pertinent Results:
CHEST CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. Large central left perihilar mass obstructing the left upper
and lower lobe bronchi with resultant collapse of left lung.
Findings are consistent with a central lung cancer, likely
squamous cell carcinoma. This lesion is amenable to
bronchoscopic biopsy if the diagnosis has not already been
confirmed.
2. Moderate left pleural effusion surrounding the atelectatic
left lung.
3. Enlarged lower left paratracheal lymph nodes, highly
suspicious for malignancy as well as additional non-enlarged
upper left paratracheal nodes with similar degree of
enhancement. Non-enhancing right hilar lymph nodes could
potentially also be metastatic. Correlative PET imaging may be
helpful if warranted clinically.
4. Poorly defined peripheral right lower lobe opacity is
nonspecific, but may represent focal area of infection,
inflammation, or infarction. Neoplastic etiology (second primary
neoplasm or atypical focus of metastatic disease) is less
likely. Comparison to older studies would be helpful. In their
absence, short-term followup CT would be recommended _____ could
also be helpful for assessing additional smaller peribronchiolar
nodules in the right lower lobe.
5. Asymmetrical appearance of left supraglottic region, possibly
due to asymmetric positioning and dependent secretions.
Attention to this area with direct visualization may be
considered if bronchoscopy is performed for the left perihilar
mass.
.
Pathology
Left mainstem tumor, excision:
-Fragments of invasive moderately differentiated squamous cell
carcinoma with necrosis arising in association with squamous
cell carcinoma in-situ.
-Focus suspicious for lymphovascular invasion seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
57 year old man with newly diagnosed lung cancer presenting with
fever, chills, non-productive cough, and hypotension, found to
have post-obstructive pneumonia.
.
# Lung Cancer
Patient was diagnosed at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with NSCLC (Squamous) via
bronchoscopic biopsy.  He was initially discharged home w/ the
hope that he could get outpatient scheduling / workup for
treatment.  However, he developed a fever and SOB and
hypotension (see below) and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
management.  Inpatient he underwent debriedement and stenting of
his left bronchus, which re-opened the collapsed LLL.  The LUL
was infiltrated w/ tumor.  During the bronchoscopy he also
underwent node bx for staging.  Head MRI and bone scan were
previously performed for staging.  He also underwent
thoracentesis to further eval for extent of metastatic spread
(cytology pending on discharge).  Radiation Oncology saw the
patient and scheduled him for follow up for future therapy.  He
was scheduled for outpatient PET and follow up with Oncology as
well.
.
# Hypotension
Patient was transiently in the MICU for hypotension, treated w/
levophed and IVFs.  On the medical floor his pressure was
improved but low overall (SBP 90-110s).  He was continued on IV
fluids and continued to do well.  The source for hypotension was
considered secondary to post-obstructive PNA (below), but may
have also been related directly to cytokine release from tumor.
.
# Post-Obstructive Pneumonia
Presented w/ increased SOB, cough, and fever.  Radiologically
showed atelectasis and consolidation.  He was treated
aggressively with vancomycin (MRSA coverage for prior
instrumentation), clindamycin, and ceftriaxone.  He continued to
have fevers with negative blood cultures.  Fevers in retrospect
may have been tumor - fever, however given his clinical state he
was continued on PO antibiotics (clinda + cefpodoxime) on
discharge for total of 7 days.

#) TB exposure
Past positive PPD, however also received BCG vaccine in [**Country 5881**].
He was started on isoniazid for a TB exposure several years ago,
but this was never completed.  OSH bronchoscopy showed no AFBs.
He was re-started on INH / Pyridoxime.
.
#) History of PE
Lovenox was held for his procedures.  Afterwards, he was
restarted at home dose.  He will continue on Lovenox as an
outpatient, especially in light of his current malignancy.
.
The patient was staged further w/ transbronchial lymph node
biopsy.  Thoracentesis was performed to evaluate for malignant
cells.  He was treated w/ a total 10 day course for
post-obstructive pneumonia.  He will follow up with radiation
oncology and medical oncology as an outpatient treatment of his
malignancy.
