Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Ranitidine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**]
Chief Complaint:
tachycardia, chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right heart catheterization
Temporary dialysis catheter x2
IR tunneled HD catheter
PICC placement


History of Present Illness:
ICU HPI:
69yoM with h/o DM, CAD s/p CABG, admission from OSH for
hyperkalemia and respiratory distress.  He was admitted from his
PCP's office to an OSH for evaluation of new pan-cytopenia
2.1>28%<83, acute renal failure and symptoms of fatigue and
weakness. He developed worsening oliguric renal failure and new
heart failure and was tranferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**7-5**] for further
workup of renal dysfunction and new pancytopenia. Since transfer
to [**Hospital1 18**] it was thought that he was suffering renal failure from
ATN in setting of some combination of poor PO intake,
hypotension on BP meds and contrast load at OSH. A temporary HD
catheter was placed [**7-7**] and he began dialysis.
.
He has also been evaluated by the hematology service and bone
marrow suppression thought likely due to suppression in setting
of acute illness but also pending EBV, CMV, parvovirus, SPEP.
UPEP negative for monoclonal spike. Hepatitis serologies
negative. There was a plan for bone marrow bx.
.
Of note, his blood cultures have grown out Ampicillin sensitive
enterococci, and he had a TTE just yesterday showing a large
aortic valve vegetation. He was switched to Ampicillin
yesterday.
.
He's also had a fair amount of anginal-type chest pain and was
evaluated by cardiology.  He's had anginal chest pain for quite
a while, maybe x2 / month, worsened with exertion and relieved
with rest. Denies palpitations. Tonight, his HR increased to the
140s, in sinus, with lateral ST depressions, which resolved with
rate control using Metoprolol 5mg IV. This appears to have been
going on nightly for several nights according to the floor night
resident. He has been getting nitro paste and nebs.
.
VS on transfer to the floor were: 108/75, 88, 32, 95/4L. On exam
on the floor, he has cardiac wheeze. ABG showed 7.4 / 35 / 77 on
4L. He looks well, but has some minor anterior chest pain.
.
ROS: As above, otherwise negative for SOB, n/v/abd
pain/diarrhea, palpitations, dizziness.
.
Of note, pt was admitted [**1-/2166**] with enterococcal UTI, finished
7d course Ampicillin
