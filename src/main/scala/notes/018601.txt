PICC line placement


History of Present Illness:
79 yo male with hx of CAD s/p MI with EF 35%, PAF on coumadin
and recent Right MCA stroke now presents from rehab with altered
mental status. He was admitted [**Date range (1) 96329**] to the Neurology service
for left sided weakness and altered mental status found on MRI
to have a right MCA stroke. He has a history of PAF, for which
he was not anticoagulated; given allergy to heparin, he was
bridged with argatroban to coumadin. That hospital course was
also noted for atrial fibrillation with RVR requiring diltiazem
gtt and eventual transition to PO metoprolol. He failed a speach
and swallow evaluation, therefore a PEG tube was placed by
gastroenterology. He also had a coagulase negative
Staphylococcus bacteremia for which he received vancomycin and
his PICC was pulled. He was discharged to complete a course of
levofloxacin and metronidazole for an aspiration pneumonia.  At
the rehabilitation facility, he had a fever on [**2-1**] with a
erythema at the site of his midline. This was pulled and US was
negative for DVT. On [**2-2**] a neurology consult was obtained due
to worsening mental status who recommended repeat CT head to
assess for hemorrhagic tranformation or edema from his CVA. He
was evaluated by CT at [**Hospital 882**] hospital which showed edema
without shift; given a possible new area of hemorrhage, he was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 **] for further workup.
     In ED repeat CT head showed area of laminar necrosis in
parietotemporal area but no hemorrhage or edema. EEG was
negative for acute seizure activity and LP was deferred due to
elevated INR but he was given 10U SC vit K. He also developed
fever to 101.5 and Afib with RVR and was given lopressor 5mg IV
x2, 25mg of PO lopressor, and empirically treated with 2g
Ceftriaxone, 1g Vancomycin, and 800mg of Acyclovir for possible
meningitis. He was admitted to the ICU for further management.

[**2-3**] EKG: Sinus rhythm with atrial premature beats. Left
anterior fascicular block.
Poor R wave progression. Consider anterior myocardial
infarction, age
indeterminate but could also be due to left anterior fascicular
block. Compared
to the previous tracing of [**2186-1-23**] no significant change

[**2-3**] EEG: This is an abnormal EEG due to the presence of a slow
and
mildly disorganized background consistent with a mild to
moderate
encephalopathy of toxic, metabolic, or anoxic etiology. No
evidence of
ongoing or potential seizure activity was seen.

[**2-3**] head CT: A large area of hypodensity within the right
middle cerebral artery territory is largely unchanged in terms
of size compared to [**2186-1-26**]. There is new hyperdensity along the
cortex of this area of infarction extending into the temporal
lobe and insular area. This finding is consistent with laminar
necrosis, a sign of a subacute infarct. There is no new edema or
associated mass effect. No areas of acute hemorrhage are
identified. No new areas of infarction are visualized. There is
no hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures. The
remainder of the density values of the brain parenchyma remain
within normal limits. A small area of isodensity within the
right frontal bone is not changed compared to [**2182-5-16**]. The soft
tissues and osseous structures as well as the visualized
paranasal sinuses are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Laminar necrosis in a subacute right middle cerebral
artery territory infarct.

[**2-3**] CXR: Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle could
represent atelectasis or small effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
79 yo male with hx of CAD s/p MI with EF 35%, PAF  and recent
right MCA stroke presents with delirium. A head CT showed
laminar necrosis in the right parietotemporal area but no
hemorrhage or edema. He was initially covered empirically for
meningitis (CTX/Vanco/Acyclovir); no LP was attempted given
elevated INR. He was admitted to the ICU, where his antibiotics
were changed to Zosyn/vancomycin to cover possible nursing home
acquired pneumonia and possible line infection (erythematous
midline removed [**2-1**]), given low suspicion for meningitis. His
mental status improved and he was transferred to the general med
floor [**2-3**].

1) Altered mental status: Most likely due to the pneumonia and
possible line infection. Head CT was without acute hemorrhage
and EEG was consistent with encephalopathy without epileptiform
activity. The patient's mental status gradually improved on
Zosyn and vancomycin, and, on discharge, was close to his [**1-27**]
baseline. The neurology service followed him throughout his
hospital stay and recommended outpatient follow-up. Additional
toxic/metabolic work-up included vitamin B12 (normal), TSH
(elevated at 5, but free T4 normal at 1.2 - repeat as an
outpatient in [**4-14**] weeks), and an infectious work-up (urine
culture negative, blood cultures no growth to date). The
patient's neurologic status remained stable (improved since
admit) despite elevated INR on discharge; if mental status
worsens, head CT should be obtained to rule out hemorrhage in
the setting of INR 4.3.

2) Pneumonia and possible line infection: Although CXR was
without clear infiltrate, the patient did have a c
