Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 19 year old college student with no significant past
medical history, who presented with chest pain starting on the
morning of admission.  He had recently had a sore throat with
frontal bilateral squeezing headache on Thursday/Friday,
sleeping most of Friday and experiencing some "cold sweats".  He
also noted myalgias and rhinorrhea.  He felt better on Saturday
and went out with friends and had 8 drinks.  The next day, the
day of admission, he woke up and had sharp chest pains. This
pain was not positional.
.
He was seen on the day of admission at his college health
services.  He was noted to have diffuse ST elevations on his EKG
and was sent to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.  He denies palpitations; he denies
diarrhea, nausea or vomiting; he denies any sick contacts; his
family lives in a rural high-tick area; he has traveled only to
[**Location (un) **] two weeks ago but nowhere else.
.
In the emergency department, his vitals on arrival were 96.3,
75, 98/58, 19, 100% RA. He received 2L NS; GI cocktail of 30 cc
maalox, 15 cc lidocaine; ibuprofen 600 mg (appears to be x2 for
total of 1200), morphine 2 mg IV x2, and an additional morphine
2 mg listed as PO but likely to be an additional dose of IV,
zofran 4 mg IV.  On subsequent blood pressure check, he was
noted to be hypotensive to SBP 70s, and was given 2 L IVF with
BP to 100s.  He had an echocardiogram in ED by cardiology fellow
and was noted to have trace pericardial effusion with normal
systolic function.  Cardiac enzymes were positive with trop T of
1.29 and CK 1324 with MBI 9.1.  He was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]
service with myocarditis.

Past Medical History:
Bilateral [**Last Name (un) **]-Calve-Parthes with right hip surgery 3 years ago


Social History:
He had a sexual encounter with a woman five days ago; denies any
oral sex and used condoms for intercourse; he denies any sex
with men.
-Tobacco history: none
-ETOH: drinks socially; last night had "6 beers and 2 shots";
says this is a typical night out for him; does not drink on
nights he does not go out with friends; typically goes out with
friends on weekends except in summer when he goes out more.

RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES:
.
CXR ([**2120-9-15**])
The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. The lungs are
clear. There is no pleural effusion or focal pulmonary
consolidation.
CONCLUSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process
.
CXR ([**2120-9-16**])
In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there is
extensive opacification at both bases consistent with pleural
effusions. No definite pulmonary vascular congestion is
appreciated. Of course, the possibility of some supervening
aspiration cannot be unequivocally excluded in the absence of a
lateral view.
.
CXR ([**2120-9-18**])
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**9-16**] and 9: Previous
pleural effusions have decreased, small on both sides. Heart
size normal. Lungs clear.
.
CXR ([**2120-9-19**])
IMPRESSION: Heart size and pulmonary vascularity are normal, and
lungs are clear. No pleural effusions.
..
ECHOCARDIOGRAMS:
.
TTE ([**2120-9-15**])
CONCLUSIONS:  The left atrium is normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Global
systolic function is good (cannot assess regional function).
Overall systolic function is good (LVEF >40%). Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
TTE ([**2120-9-16**])
CONCLUSIONS:  The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac
index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Transmitral and tissue Doppler
imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Preserved global and regional biventricular systolic
function. Mild mitral regurgitation with normal valve
morphology. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2120-9-15**], biventricular systolic function is better defined on
the current study and appears to be normal.
.
TTE ([**2120-9-18**])
CONCLUSIONS: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with
the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-9-16**], no change.
..
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM ([**2120-9-15**])
Sinus arrhythmia. Extensive ST segment elevation suggests
pericarditis.
No previous tracing available for comparison.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, this is a 19-year old young man with no significant
past medical history, who presented with chest pain and
dramatically elevated cardiac enzymes and diffuse ST changes
consistent with pericarditis with myocardial involvment.

# MYOCARDITIS/PERICARDITIS:  The patient's initial presentation
as a young, otherwise healthy man with chest pain and diffuse ST
elevations was quite consistent with pericarditis.  Grossly
elevated cardiac enzymes and signs of fluid overload/ increased
oxygen requirement suggested myocardial involvement as well.
Initial suspicion was for idiopathic or viral
myocarditis/pericarditis given epidemiology and history of viral
prodromal symptoms (sore throat, headache) as well
