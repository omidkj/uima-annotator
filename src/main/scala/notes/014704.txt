Chief Complaint:
hypertensive urgency, altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 73843**] [**Known lastname **] is a 46 y/o man with type I DM, ESRD on HD,
and hypertension who presented to the ED on [**8-4**] with
nausea/vomiting and dizziness per report of personal care
attendant. The attendant contact[**Name (NI) **] the patient's sister earlier
today to report symptoms. When the patient's sister spoke with
him on the phone, he comlained of "difficulty breathing" and
"feeling sick" but would not further elaborate. He did not take
his morning labs per his sister due to vomiting. At that time,
he was taken to the ED.
.
On arrival to the ED, the patient's initial vitals were T 97.1,
HR 92, BP 235/107, RR 18, O2 91%. Symptoms in the ED included
left-sided chest pain (which patient denied on our exam),
nausea/vomiting, and abdominal pain. Reportedly completed
dialysis yesterday per usual schedule though they were unable to
achieve a dry weight yesterday. Patient's care attendant noted
that patient was more somnolent than usual on the day after
dialysis. Left EJ was placed for access. He was treated with
zofran 4 mg IV X 1. He was then placed on a nitroglycerin gtt
for SBPs over 200. He also took hydralazine 25 mg PO X 1. BP
improved to 178/97 and the patient was taken to dialysis.
.
At dialysis, the patient's temperature increased to 99.8. Blood
cultures were sent. Blood pressure at dialysis was labile,
ranging from 130s-180s systolic, and nitroglycerin gtt was
turned on & off. Three kg were removed at dialysis to achieve a
weight of 65.8 kg (dry weight reportedly 65 kg). On our arrival,
the patient notes ongoing abdominal pain and nausea. Denied
chest pain or shortness of breath. Denied dizziness. Would not
otherwise answer questions reliably.
.
As for his mental baseline, the patient's sister states that he
is typically oriented to self, date of birth, day of dialysis, &
those people he knows. He does have baseline confusion since
last year in [**Month (only) 216**] (after his PEA arrest). He does not
typically know month/year but can tell you what type of building
he is in (i.e., hospital but not [**Hospital3 **]). Of note, the
patient has had multiple recent admissions for hiccups (etiology
unclear) as well as recent admission [**2154-7-29**] for syncope thought
secondary to dehydration following dialysis.

CXR: (prior to dialysis) single portable AP upright view of the
chest was obtained. Cardiomegaly is stable. Indistinctness and
cephalization of pulmonary vasculature and interstitial
prominence are consistent with pulmonary interstitial edema. No
focal airspace consolidation or large effusion is seen on this
single frontal view. Osseous structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Stable cardiomegaly. Pulmonary interstitial edema.
.
Head CT: There is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, mass
effect, shift of normally midline structures or hydrocephalus.
Ventricles, basal cisterns, and sulci are normal in
configuration. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation is normally
preserved. Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells
are well aerated. Increased soft tissue thickening of the left
posterior globe and increased attenuation of the lens are
stable. By report, the patient has a history of glaucoma and
left eye blindness. IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial
abnormality. Stable left globe abnormalities.
.
EKG: sinus rhythm at 75, normal axis, LVH, prolonged PR (200
ms), upsloping elevated ST segments in V2-6, biphasic p wave in
V1

   None.



Provisional Findings Impression: [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 73857**] [**Doctor First Name **] [**2150-8-6**] 3:52 PM
No acute pathology including no evidence of infarction or PRES.
Unchanged

Unchanged left retinal hemorrhage.


Final Report
INDICATION: 46-year-old with chronic renal disease,
hypertension, diabetes,
and mental status changes in the setting of a hypertensive
emergency. Evaluate
for PRES or stroke.

COMPARISON: MRI of the brain [**2149-6-28**].

TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1, axial T2, GRE, and DWI are performed.

MRI OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is no evidence of
acute
hemorrhage, edema or infarction, and no change from [**2149-6-28**]. Again
seen is a small area of T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity within the
left corona
radiata, extending into the left ependymal region and likely
representing a
small developmental venous anomaly. There may be an associated
capillary
telangiectasia to ex
