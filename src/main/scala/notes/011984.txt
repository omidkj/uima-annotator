Date of Birth:  [**2098-4-13**]             Sex:   M

Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1561**]
Chief Complaint:
64 M w/ recurrent pneumonia and hemoptysis from a right lower
lobe lesion.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right video assisted thorocoscopy, right thorocotomy
Right middle, right lower lobectomy  [**1-24**] for hilar lesion
Tissue flap. Mediastinal lymphnode disection.


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 64 yo man w/ long smoking history, recent recurrent
PNA's, who was transferred from [**Hospital1 1562**] Hospitalto thoracics
service on [**2162-12-31**] for work up of lung mass,throacics/IP
consultation, with concern for lung ca. He has had
recurrent, right sided pneumonias in recent months and was
initially
admitted to [**Hospital1 1562**] w/ shortness of breath. Initial
brochnoscopy
at [**Hospital1 1562**] on [**12-31**] showed endobronchial, friable, "pearly
white" lesion @ "take off" of right lower lobe. CT scan here of
airway showed large tumor burden on right with almost total
collapse of
RLL (see below for report). Patient then had rigid bronch on
[**1-4**] which showed tumor origin extending into RLL orifice,
obstructing entire RLL. Tumor excision and destruction was
performed. Prelim
biopsy report c/w lung ca, but final report pending.
Patient was dischared home [**1-6**] to complete staging w/u (PET,
etc), and now returns to [**Hospital1 18**] for O.R. VATS / RLLobectomy.


Past Medical History:
PMH:
h/o tularemia [**2138**] (hospitalized)
h/o babesiosis- 5 yrs ago (hospitalzed)
chornic/recurrent right sided pnas 2-4 episodes in last year-
last admit few weeks before current admission
GERD
eye surgery
OTHER DATA: CT scan at [**Hospital1 1562**] by report [**12-18**]: R lower lobe
infiltrate
spirometry at [**Hospital1 1562**] [**2162-12-30**]: FEV1 2.63 (79% predicted).
FEV1/FVC 63, DLCO 89% predicted. TLC 102% predicted. Flow volume
loop with mild obstruction. Impression "Stage I COPD"
thinks he may have had TIA many years ago w/ right arm tingling-
not worked up


Social History:
Lives in [**Hospital3 4298**]. Has 1.5 ppd smoker x 50 years, quit
on [**2162-12-31**]; heavy Etoh >10 yrs ago but now one beer per day but
"100% whiskey is my weakness." Used to live/work on a farm, now
works for [**Location (un) 65076**] road crew part time. Lives with friend. [**Name (NI) **]
sister close by. Not married. No children.

Family History:
sister w/ CAD, CABG, DM. Brother passed away suddently at age
43, thinks he had MI. Father w/ "[**Name2 (NI) **]-induced cancer." Denies
family h/o anesthesia complications

Physical Exam:
He is a thin elderly male in no acute distress. His vital signs
are within normal limits. His pupils are equal, round, and
reactive. His sclerae are anicteric. Cervical exam reveals no
supraclavicular or cervical adenopathy.
Lungs are clear to auscultation and bilaterally equal. Heart is
regular without murmur. Thorax is symmetrical without lesions or
masses. Abdomen is benign without masses or tenderness.
Extremities show no clubbing or edema. Neurologic is grossly
nonfocal with intact and appropriate mental status.


Pertinent Results:
CT trachea [**2163-1-1**]:
Near-complete collapse of the right lower lobe secondary to a
mass which obstructs the right lower lobe segmental bronchi and
extends up to
the level of the right middle lobe origin.

Bronchoscopy report [**2163-1-4**]:
There was normal anatomy down to the level of the right lower
lobe. The right lower lobe had a white necrotic obstructing
lesion emanating from the superior segment of the lower lobe
(S6) and completely obstructing the right lower lobe. The right
middle lobe was spared. The right middle
lobe carina was spared.

P-MIBI on [**2163-1-21**]:
1. Normal myocardial perfusion. 2. Normal left ventricular
cavity
size and systolic function.
CXR [**2163-1-24**]:
Moderate right pneumothorax with chest tubes in place.

PORTABLE CHEST, [**2163-1-29**] AT 16:31.
INDICATION: Recent lobectomy surgery - check PTX.
COMPARISON: [**2163-1-29**] AT 13:06.
FINDINGS:
Compared with the prior study, the right chest catheter remains
in place, and there is a persistent lower component
pneumothorax, unchanged from prior. Pneumomediastinum also
persists, unchanged. A bit more patchiness in opacity is seen in
the right lower lung field, a finding which should be reassessed
on subsequent followup studies.
Left lung remains clear.
IMPRESSION:Stable right basilar PTX. Possible developing
airspace disease in the right base.
[**1-31**]-
CHEST, ONE VIEW, PORTABLE
INDICATION: 64-year-old man with status post right middle and
right lower lobectomy.
COMMENTS: Portable erect AP radiograph of the chest is reviewed,
and compared with the previous study of [**2163-1-30**].
The right chest tube remains in place. There is continued
moderate-sized right basilar pneumothorax, which is unchanged in
size. There is continued extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the
right chest wall.
The left costophrenic angle is not included in the radiograph.
The left lung appears clear. The heart is normal in size.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
64 year old man with s/p RML/RLLobectomy , continued air leak
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
64 year old man with s/p RML/RLLobectomy , continued air leak
on.Please do at 10am
HISTORY: Right middle and right lower lobectomy.

PA and lateral chest (three images). The right hemithorax is
diminished in size with previous thoracotomy and rib fractures
plus skin staples. There is a small caliber chest tube in the
lower right hemithorax. Moderate-sized right pneumothorax, most
of which is seen adjacent to the diaphragm. Extensive right
subcutaneous emphysema. Heart normal size without vascular
congestion & left lung is clear. The overall appearances and
size of postoperative right pneumothorax are little changed from
one day previous ([**2163-2-1**]).
IMPRESSION: No short interval change in postoperative right
pneumothorax.

[**2163-2-3**] 7:24 AM
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
64 year old man with s/p RML/RLLobectomy , continued air leak
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
64 year old man with s/p RML/RLLobectomy , continued air leak
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Interval evaluation after right middle
lobe and right lower lobe lobectomy. Portable AP chest x-ray was
reviewed and compared to the previous study from [**2163-2-2**].
Right chest tube remains in place. Moderate sized right
pneumothorax, which is most prominent in the lung base but also
may be barely seen in the apex, remains unchanged. Extensive
right subcutaneous emphysema is present and prevents the exact
estimation of the apical part of the right pneumothorax.
The heart size is normal without vascular congestion. The left
lung is clear.
IMPRESSION: The overall appearance of the x-ray is grossly
unchanged in comparison to the previous film.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2163-2-4**] 6:51 AM
Reason: please eval for change--compared to [**2-3**]--9:30pm
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
64 year old man with s/p RML/RLLobectomy, s/p CT removal,
worsenign crepitus and voice change
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please eval for change--compared to [**2-3**]--9:30pm
HISTORY: Status post right middle and right lower lobectomies
and chest tube removal, with worsening crepitus and voice
change.
COMPARISON: [**2163-2-3**].
CHEST: PA and lateral views. Evaluation of the right-sided
intrathoracic detail is once again limited by the extensive
subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall. The moderate
right hydropneumothorax appears unchanged. There is no change in
the position of the heart and mediastinum, including the
trachea. The left lung is clear. There is no left pleural
effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Unchanged moderate right hydropneumothorax.
