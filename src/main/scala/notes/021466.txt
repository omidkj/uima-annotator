Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10593**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
NONE

History of Present Illness:
This is a 60F with a h/o IDDM, CAD s/p CABG [**2172**] (LIMA -> LAD,
SVG to [**Year (4 digits) 11641**]), s/p STEMI ([**2174**]) w/ occlusion of vein graft, s/p
stents to LAD and [**Year (4 digits) 11641**] ([**2174**]), sCHF (EF 30-35% [**8-4**]), s/p AICD,
PVD s/p R toe amputations and L BKA presenting after a period of
unresponsiveness. Per report, the patient was found to be
unresponsive and cyanotic (lips, chest) at her rehab facility
([**Hospital1 **] [**Location 1268**]). Unclear whether the patient was
pulseless, but chest compressions were not performed and the pt
was placed on a nonrebreather. When EMS arrived, the pt had a
normal HR and eventually became interactive. There was a
question of whether the patient had accidentally gotten a large
dose of oxycodone prior to the event. The patient does not
recall what happened; she says she was speaking to another
patient and then woke up to EMS.
.
On arrival in the ED, VS were 98.7 74 143/66 20 100% 12L
non-rebreather. Labs showed lactate 2.3, normal ABG on room air,
troponin 0.04 (~bl), Creat 2.2 (bl 1.8), BNP 7894. Pt was given
full-dose ASA. CT Head showed no accute intracranial process.
CXR was concerning for pulmonary edema. The patient was admitted
to the MICU.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient noted to be lethargic but
without complaint. Her mental status gradually improved. She had
a repeat TTE which was stable w/r/t her prior (EF ~ 35%). Her O2
was weaned. Her clinical status continued to improve and today
(hospital day 2) she is transferred to the floor.
.
On arrival on the floor, the patient c/o tenderness under the
outside of her R breast. She otherwise has no complaints. Cannot
recall what happened at her rehab facility.

[**2-5**] CT head: No evidence of acute intracranial process.

[**2-5**] CXR: Findings consistent with fluid overload including
pulmonary
vascular congestion, small bilateral pleural effusions and
enlarged cardiac silhouette.

[**2-6**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF
?35 %). Poor image quality precluded segmental wall motion
analysis. The right ventricular free wall thickness is normal.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-25**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing caused by the defibrillator
coil, the severity of tricuspid regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
  Compared with the findings of the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2180-8-8**], the findings are grossly similar,
but the technically suboptimal nature of both studies precludes
definitive comparison. The tricuspid regurgitation may be
markedly underestimated on both studies due to acoustic
shadowing caused by the defibrillator coil.

[**2-7**] EEG: This is an abnormal awake and sleep EEG because of
diffuse
slowing of background indicative of moderate to severe
encephalopathy.
No epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures are
present in the
recording.

[**2-7**] RLE arterial studies: Patent popliteal and posterior tibial
arteries with no evidence of stenosis.
 Indeterminant study with falsely elevated ABI and artifact,
likely moderate right lower extremity occlusive disease.

[**2-8**] RUQ u/s: 1. Within limitations above, normal liver
echotexture. Pulsatile flow in the portal vein indicates right
heart failure and tricuspid insufficiency. In the setting of
elevated LFTs, congestive hepatopathy is a consideration.
  2. Right pleural effusion.
  3. Nonvisualization of the left kidney, spleen and pancreas.
