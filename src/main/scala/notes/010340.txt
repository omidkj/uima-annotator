Chief Complaint:
Hemoptysis

History of Present Illness:
46M h/o alcohol abuse, HCV [**3-9**] [**2141**] blood transfusion, GERD,
admitted with self-reported hemoptysis and CP, also found to be
alcohol intoxicated.  Pt had attended baseball game at which he
drank about 12 beers.  Afterwards, while walking home, pt
suddenly coughed up several tablespoonfuls of blood (per pt's
report to NF, he coughed one T of bright red blood).  At that
time, pt also developed sudden onset L sided CP initiated and
aggravated by breathing, accompanied by SOB.  Pt later reported
that this pain had changed to the R side.  Pt noted no other
additional symptoms.  Pt then called EMS and was brought to ED.

.  ED:
# VS: T 98.1, HR 100, BP 120/76, RR 14, SaO2 96/RA
# Meds:  ASA 325, nitroglycerin SL, hydralazine, metoprolol
(AFib RVR), levofloxacin (empiric Rx for PNA).  Multiple pain
medications (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, morphine, Percocet,
hydromorphone).  Diazepam per CIWA.
# Studies: CXR demonstrated ground glass opacities
# Clinical course: Afib + RVR (150s), spontaneous conversion
without meds to sinus tach (100s).  Stable BP, asymptomatic.
.
ROS:  Pt states that he was in his USOH prior to this incident
(+) Fatigue which pt attributes to longer hours at work
(-) CP, SOB, cough, hemoptysis. F/C, N/V, weight loss, sick
contacts. [**Name (NI) **] pt report to NF, prior PPD negative about ~1.5
month ago at inpatient detox.

===========================================
Studies:
.
# BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS  [**2170-10-19**] 6:55 PM
No evidence of DVT.
.
# CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2170-10-19**] 5:04 AM
Diffuse air space process, most likely infectious,involving the
right upper, middle and lower lobes. Small mediastinal and right
hilar lymph nodes, likely reactive. Fatty liver.
.
# CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2170-10-19**] 3:30 AM
Diffuse patchy opacity involving the entire right lung. The most
likely etiology is infectious. However, CT scan is recommended
to further assess.
.
# CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2170-10-20**] 1:00 PM
1. No pulmonary embolus.
2. Mild interval improvement in right lung patchy consolidation
and ground- glass opacity, possibly reflecting improving
infectious or inflammatory process; aspiration and pulmonary
hemorrhage are also considered.
3. 3-mm left upper lobe pulmonary nodule. If there is no known
risk factor for pulmonary malignancy, this may be followed up in
one year with chest CT.
.
# ECG Study Date of [**2170-10-19**]  12:10:46 PM
Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. ST-T wave
abnormalities which are non-specific. Compared to tracing #1
atrial fibrillation is new.
.
# ECG Study Date of [**2170-10-19**]  12:34:48 PM
Sinus tachycardia with occasional atrial premature beats.
Compared to tracing #2 sinus rhythm has replaced atrial
fibrillation.
.
# SPUTUM Procedure Date of [**2170-10-21**]
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS. Bacteria, squamous cells, and
scattered pulmonary macrophages.
.
# Cytology Report BRONCHIAL WASHINGS Procedure Date of [**2170-10-24**]
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS. Reactive bronchial cells, abundant
reactive pulmonary macrophages and inflammatory cells.
.
# CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2170-10-25**] 1:10 PM
AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST: In comparison with films of [**2170-10-19**],
the patient has taken a very poor inspiration, which most likely
accounts for the prominence of the transverse diameter of the
heart. Although, the image is somewhat over-penetrated, there is
no evidence of pneumonia. Nevertheless, if there is a
significant clinical concern, a repeat study with better
inspiration and lighter technique would be recommended.

Brief Hospital Course:
46M h/o alcohol abuse, HCV 2/2 blood transfusion, admitted with
unwitnessed acute-onset hemoptysis and pleuritic CP.
.
# Hemoptysis: DDx included PE and infectious process given
diffuse multilobar opacities in R lung on imaging.  Pulmonary
consult was obtained in the ED.
.
--TB rule-out: Pt was placed in isolation pending TB rule-out
based on reported history of hemoptysis.  One out of three
sputum samples were reported with rare AFB on concentrated
smear.  PPD was placed and was negative.  Bronchoscopy was
performed to assess lungs and airways, returned no bloody fluid,
and found no masses.  BAL results were negative for AFB.  Final
state laboratory results reported negative M. tuberculosis.
.
--Aspiration PNA: Concern existed for possible aspiration PNA
given pt's intoxication on presentation.  Levofloxacin was begun
with goal 10 day course, which was later discontinued given
possible suppressive effects on AFB.  Repeat CXR on [**10-25**]
demonstrated no PNA.
.
--PE rule-out: Concern existed for possibe PE, based on elevated
DDimer, pleuritic chest pain, and episode of atrial fibrillation
which could have been chronic.  Bilateral LENIs were negative
for DVT.  Initial CTA chest had poor contrast timing.  CTA was
repeated and demonstrated no PE.
.
--Autoimmune lung disease: Given isolated R-sided findings, low
suspicion existed for Wegener's or Goodpasture's, but ANCA and
anti-GBM were submitted and, respectively, were negative or
pending on discharge.
.
# Chest pain: Pt presented with pleuritic pain associated with
coughing and deep breathing.  CE were negative and EKG
demonstrated no ischemic changes.  Pt was converted to PO pain
medications and monitored for response.  Pt stated repeatedly
taht .  On [**10-25**], two hours
.
# Alcohol: Pt had h/o unsuccessful detox, and presented with
ethanol level of 291 on urine toxicology.  Pt was highly
defensive when asked about his alcohol intake, attributing his
drinking to normal pattern with watching TV or a sports game.
Pt placed on CIWA scale with diazepam 10mg PRN, as well as
