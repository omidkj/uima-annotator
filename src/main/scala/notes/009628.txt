Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy
Interventional radiology embolization of anterior right upper
lobe feeding vessel.


History of Present Illness:
57F with metastatic clear cell renal carcinoma with pulmonary
involvement, systolic CHF, aortic stenosis who presents with one
day of frank hemoptysis. She reports that starting today she had
three episodes of frank liquid hemoptysis at home, each
approximately one tablespoon. She had two additional episodes of
hemoptysis in the ED, the larger volume estimated to be two
tablespoons. She denies purulent sputum production, fever,
chills. She has no known sick contacts but says she is at the
hospital constantly for appointments. She has chronic back pain
which has not been worse recently. The patient has a
longstanding history (years) of nonproductive coughing spells
which lead to wheezing and dyspnea. This has not been worse
recently and she denies increased SOB or CP. She denies
orthopnea or PND. She has never been incarcerated, lived in a
homeless shelter, or travelled outside the country. Her daughter
urged her to go the [**Name (NI) **] and she presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 98.2 61 158/78 20 96% RA. Labs were
notable for INR elevated at 3.9, Hct 39.7. CXR showed increased
nodularities consistent with increasing metastases, RLL
ill-defined opacity and increased R pleural effusion. Intubation
was discussed in setting of two additional episodes of
hemoptysis but declined by patient. Interventional pulmonology
was consulted and recommended MICU admission for bronchoscopy
and airway monitoring after non-contrast chest CT given contrast
allergy. Patient was given Vitamin K 5mg IV x1 and 2 units FFP.
VS at transfer: 98.7 86 118/70 26 96%RA.
.
Upon arrival to the ICU, the patient feels well and denies
hemoptysis since arriving from the ED or SOB.

[**2133-10-17**] CT Chest w/o contrast:
-New area of ground-glass attenuation in the anterior segment of
the right upper lobe. Surrounding centrilobular nodules with a
few tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities. Findings may reflect superimposed
infection or inflammation on diffuse metastatic disease.
Atypical pathogens should be considered such as [**Doctor First Name **]. Areas of
ground glass are non-specific and could be infectious or
possibly related to hemorrhage - correlate clinically with the
degree of hemoptysis.
-New small right pleural effusion
-Slight increase in the size of known mediastinal
lymphadenopathy
-Mild increase in size of multiple known pulmonary masses.
.
[**2133-10-17**] CXR: Interval increase in size of ill-defined nodular
opacities in both lungs compatible with pulmonary metastases.
Small right pleural effusion has increased when compared to the
prior chest radiograph, with patchy ill-defined opacity in the
right lung base which may reflect atelectasis though infection
is not completely excluded. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy is
re-demonstrated.

EKG: AF 76, LVH, ST changes c/w LVH, no change from prior

Brief Hospital Course:
57F with metastatic renal clear cell carcinoma with pulmonary
involvement, AF on warfarin, symptomatic aortic stenosis who
presents with one day of frank hemoptysis.

# Hemoptysis: unclear etiology, differential diagnosis includes
invasion of pulmonary vasculature by tumor, pneumonia, PE, TB,
adverse effect of chemotherapy. Whatever the primary etiology,
it has likely been exacerbated by her supratherapeutic INR.
Initially IP tried an intervention, but due to excessive
bleeding had to stop. Patient then went to IR to have the area
of the posterior Right upper Lobe embolized. IP successfully
embolized the feeding vessel and the radiologists were fairly
confident that there are no collaterals feeding that area. The
next day she had a repeat bronchoscopy with successful removal
of the clot without incidental bleeding. She had no further
episodes of hemoptysis. We held warfarin and per Cardiology, her
anticoagulation strategy will need to be re-addressed as
outpatient.

# Atrial fibrillation: now rate controlled, INR supratherapeutic
on presentation. CHADS2 score is 2. Held anticoagulation in
house. Will need to re-address as outpatient. We slowly
re-started her beta blockade prior to discharge. We changed her
coumadin to aspirin 81 mg po daily on discharge.

# Aortic stenosis: unknown valve area now, last TTE in 2/[**2132**].
We continued ranolazine

#Chronic Systolic CHF: She was continued on her home carvedilol.
We held home furosemide while admitted and restarted on
discharge.

# Metastatic renal cell carcinoma: on experimental chemotherapy
regimen.
Primary oncology team is aware of this hospitalization. She will
likely need an evaluation by radiation oncology to prevent
hemoptysis in the future.

# Hypothyroidism: stable. Continued home levothyroxine

# Dyslipidemia:
