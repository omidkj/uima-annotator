Relevant Studies:
IMAGING:
-CXR ([**2120-8-22**])
IMPRESSION: Stable small left-sided pleural effusion with
associated atelectasis. No definite focal consolidation is seen.


-TTE ([**2120-8-23**])
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 5-10 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

Scrotal US: IMPRESSION:
1. Multiseptated fluid surrounding the left testis and
epididymis. The left epididymis appears thickened in comparison
with the contralateral side and there is increased blood flow in
the left epididymis and testis.
2. Findings are suggestive of a left-sided epididymo orchitis.
3. No concerning mass lesions.
Small epididymal head cysts as described.
