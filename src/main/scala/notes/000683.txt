Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
Hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 78 yo male with p-ANCA vasculitis, history of
interstitial lung disease, recent d/c from [**Hospital1 **] at the end of
[**Month (only) 547**] who presents with frank hemoptysis, transfer from an OSH.

Pt was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] from [**Date range (3) 18455**] when he presented
with chills, wt loss, muscle cramps, night sweats. He was found
to be in ARF with creatinine of 2.7, CRP 113, ESR >100, mildly
elevated transaminases in the lower 100s, CK 785. He was found
to have a positive p anca (mpo specificity, negative pr3). Renal
biopsy had "evidence of fibrinoid necrosis of the small/medium
vessels. This was consistent with a pauci-immune vasculitis of
the medium vessels. "(per d/c summary. No report in computer).
Pt was started on prednisone (60mg qday) and received one dose
of cytoxan. This admission was also complicated by anemia and
hematuria.

Patient was seen in both rhematology and renal clinic yesterday
and looked and felt well per report. Today, he presented to
[**Hospital1 **] Hospiatl by EMS from home when he had a sudden
onset of difficulty breathing and frothy hemoptysis (per NW
note). He was only able to answer in one word answers,
tachycardic in the 140s, and hypertensive to 190/110. SaO2 was
50s per report (ambulance tx) and pt was having frank hemoptysis
or BRB (150-200 cc) and pt was emergently intubated. He was
given 5 mg versed, 20 etomidate, 120 mg succinylcholine prior to
intubation. ABG at NWH was 7.34/37/180 on an FiO2 of 100%. Labs
were notable for potassium 5.5, BUN/cr of 86/3.8, lactate of
3.6, wbc of 28.2.  He was also give protonix 40 mg IV and 1 gram
of IV solumedrol. He received 3.375 mg IV zosyn, 1 gram of IV
vancomycin. Patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

In the ED at [**Hospital1 **], VS on arrival were: T: 99.0 HR: 80, BP:
146/83; RR 18; O2: 94-97%RA.

Radiology:
CXR AP [**2200-5-13**]-Marked progression to diffuse parenchymal

Echo
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is [**5-15**]  mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF  50-55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The  aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be  determined.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat
pad.

CXR [**2200-5-13**] There has been interval progression of diffuse
parenchymal opacities involving majority of the lung fields
bilaterally with scattered air bronchograms and without evidence
of overt cardiac enlargement or pleural effusions. Endotracheal
tube is approximately 6 cm from the carina and there is mild
over distention of the balloon cuff. Orogastric true terminates
within the stomach fundus. There is no evidence of a
pneumothorax and the hemidiaphragms are well visualized.
CXR [**2200-5-28**]

Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3.9 cm above the
carina. A right subclavian line terminates at the level of the
mid superior vena cava. A Dobbhoff tube courses below the
diaphragm and out of view of the film.

Right lung opacity may demonstrate more confluence today with
persistent left retrocardiac and perihilar opacity with air
bronchograms. Low lung volumes are noted bilaterally and there
is no evidence of pneumothorax. Left costophrenic angle is cut
off on this film; however, a right-sided effusion likely
persists. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Compared
with the prior there is massive increase in the amount of air
within the stomach.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 78 yo male with a history of interstitial lung disease,
newly diagnosed P-ANCA vasculitis presented with respiratory
failure from hemoptysis. He received plasmapheresis, pulse dose
steroids, and cytoxan. Now s/p extubation, episode of AFlutter
s/p cardioversion.

1. Respiratory failure- Patient intubated with likely pulmonary
hemorrhage secondary to vasculitis (capillary alveoli leak) on
admission. He was bronched on HD 3 which did not show active
bleeding. He was treated broadly for possible infection with
vancomycin, levaquin, and flagyl (14 day course) as well as the
fact that blood is a nidus of infection. He had pressure support
trial on HD2 and was extubated on HD3,  failing extubation and
had to be reintubated 8 hours later. His ABG showed good
ventilation and it was purely hypoxic failure and tiring out.
Based on BNP >assay, CXR, and physical exam, it was thought that
fluid overload played a large part in the failed extubation. He
was diuresed aggressively. A repeat echo did not show any wall
motion abnormalities and enzymes checked showed an elevated
troponin but not thought to be ischemia. Rebronch on HD 7 showed
no active hemorrhage and patient was successfully extubated on
HD 8. He continued to need aggressive suctioning (including
nasally) as he was having large mucus plugs. On [**5-27**] he became
neutorpenic with increased secretions. He was started on
vancomycin and aztreonam. On [**5-28**] during a change in his central
line developed respiratory distress with profound hypoxia. Was
intubated. Bronchoscopy showed coupious secretions throughout.
After meeting with family, given overall poor prognosis and
patients prior voiced wishes, care was withdrawn. Patient was
extubated and expired within in minutes.

2. Anca positive non-eosinphilic vasculitis with hemoptysis-
microangiopathic vasculitis vs. wegeners vs. other. He had
respiratory failure as above. He was treated with three courses
of plasmapheresis (HD1, HD3, HD4) and with pulse dose steroids
on admission (1 gram of solumedrol x 3 days).
