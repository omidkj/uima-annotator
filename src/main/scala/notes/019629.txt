History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness ([**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] notes):  80-year-old
male with hairy cell leukemia in remission, prostate cancer s/p
cystoprostatectomy with ileal stoma, recently s/p
cholecystectomy and parastomal hernia repair presents with
persistent fever.  He originally presented to [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**] on
[**7-5**] for cholecystecomy and parastomal hernia repair.  He
was discharged on [**7-8**] with Bactrim for an E coli UTI.  He
returned to the hospital [**7-10**] for recurrent fever and was found
to have a postoperative wound.  He was treated with ertapenem
for Proteus and Klebsiella.  He then developed pyoderma
gangrenosum about 2 cm above his wound.  This was treated with
prednisone 60 mg with a planned taper.  He was discharged on
[**7-17**], however had recurrent fevers and again presented on [**7-20**].

.
Since [**7-20**] the patient has continued to spike daily fevers as
high as 104 [**8-5**]. Antibiotics included Augmentin for [**7-23**] to
[**8-1**], Bactrim for [**8-1**] to [**8-3**], ceftazidime from [**8-3**] to
[**8-5**].  Fluconazole was used from [**7-29**] to [**8-4**], at which point
it was changed to voriconazole for yeast isolated in his urine.
On [**8-5**] antibiotics were changed to Zosyn given persistent fever.
 The patient underwent 2 CT scans of his torso to help evaluate
etiology of fever which revealed LLL consolidation, likely PNA.

.
On the floor, the patient is asymptomatic and afebrile.

Cytology and Pathology:
Bronchial washings ([**8-7**]):
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.  Predominantly macrophages,
neutrophils, and polymorphous lymphocytes, consistent with
reactive inflammatory infiltrate (See Note). Note: Please refer
to the corresponding cell block specimen S11-[**Pager number 95303**]H for further
characterization and the results of immunohistochemistry
studies.
.
Flow cytometry ([**8-10**]): FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING
The following tests (antibodies) were performed: HLA-DR, FMC-7,
Kappa, Lambda, and CD antigens 3, 5, 10, 11c, 19, 20, 22, 23,
25, 103.
RESULTS: Three color gating is performed (light scatter vs.
CD45) to optimize lymphocyte yield.
Abnormal B-cell leukemia cells comprise 57% of lymphoid gated
events and ~1% of all events. B cells demonstrate a monoclonal
Kappa light chain restricted population.  They co-express pan B
cell markers CD19, 20, 22, along with CD25, CD11c, CD103.  They
do not express
