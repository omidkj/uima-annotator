Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 896**]
Chief Complaint:
"Hemoptysis"

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
56 year old male with history of interstitial lung disease
(?Asbestosis), multiolobar PNA in ?[**2159**], hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, GERD, obstructive sleep apnea and ocular
pemphigoid who presents from [**Hospital6 3105**] with
hemoptysis. The patient has had intermittent hemoptysis since
[**2162-12-22**], which prompted work-up that resulted in his ILD
diagnosis (all performed at [**Hospital3 **]). The patient
developed fevers (101F), severe coughing with hemoptysis,
lightheadedness two days ago. When he presented to OSH ED
yesterday, he was mildly febrile at 100.6F, tachycardic 90-100s,
hypoxic to 84% on room air and confused (alert and oriented X2).
He had labs drawn with mild leukocytosis (WBC 11.9), Hct 27.9
(unclear baseline), platelets 180. Na 139, K 4.1, BUN 56,
Creatinine 1.5. He responded to 4L nasal cannula --> O2 sat 94%.
CTA was performed which ruled out pulmonary emboli but
demonstrated ground glass opacities and a calcified granuloma in
the right apex. He did not receive antibiotics prior to transfer
but was transfused one unit and volume resuscitated for
hypotension with BP initially 70-85/39-44, then SBP90s. He also
received 1 gram tylenol for his fever. Of note patient reports
occasional night sweats drenching sheets, cough productive of
yellowish-grey sputum and sharp chest pain which is worse with
inspiration. He denies recent travel or sick contacts.

Upon arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS: T99.5, HR80, BP106/66,
RR16, 98% on 4L. His hematocrit post-transfusion was 29.0. He
was hemodynamically stable with systolics in 110s-120, and was
treated for community-acquired pneumonia with ceftriaxone and
azithromycin; blood and urine cultures drawn. The patient was
guaiac negative. Interventional Pulmonary was made aware and had
no recommendations at this time. Vital signs upon transfer:
T99.4, HR80, BP118/64, 94% on 4L NC.

Imaging:
[**9-11**] CXR PA/Lat: IMPRESSION: Non-specific subtle increase of
opacity in the left lower lobe, could represent either early
infection or small amount of alveolar hemorrhage.

[**9-11**] CT Chest W/O Contrast:
1.  Diffuse peribronchial ground-glass opacities are visualized
at all lobes
of both lungs, but greatest throughout the left lower lobe.
These findings
are suggestive of an infectious or inflammatory process.
Atypical infections,
including mycobacterial infections, are included as differential
considerations.

2. Esophageal thickening with a small hiatal hernia, suggestive
of an
inflammatory process.




Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION:
56yo M PMHx of uncertain interstitial lung disease, obstructive
sleep apnea p/w fevers reporting "hemoptysis", found to not have
any signs of hemorrhagic process, nor any signs of blood in
sputum, started on a rule out for TB and transferred to the
floor.

ACTIVE DIAGNOSES:
# Multifocal pneumonia: Patient has reports of hemoptysis, but
sputum during stay yellowish-grey, guaiac negative.  Given his
radiographic findings and outpatient fever, the patient was
treated with empiric cefpodoxime and azithromycin.  His case was
discussed with interventional pulmonology and reviewed CT of his
chest, a bronchitis was most likely etiology but given apical
granuloma (see below on pulmonary imaging) it was felt that the
patient warranted a TB rule-out.  Upon transfer from the MICU to
the floor the patient was saturating in the low 90s on room air
and his productive cough had improved.  He was discharged on
cefpodoxime & azithromycin (to complete a 10-d course).

# Apical granulomas: Patient w h/o L apical granuloma on prior
CT chest ([**2159**]) and on wet read of admission chest CT.  He
appeared to have a small right apical granuloma.  Given his
prior stay in prison & his presenting symptoms, it was felt that
he should be ruled out for active TB.  He had 3 AFB negative
sputum samples at the time of discharge.

# Iron deficiency anemia: Mr. [**Known lastname 70832**] was found to have heme
occult positive brown stools, but H/H remained stable at 29-31.
Iron saturation was ~10% with ferritin in the 80s. He had
undergone recent colonoscopy and EGD so this was not pursued.
Repeat HCT should be checked in follow-up.

# Esophageal thickening: Noted on CT scan. Patient reported some
intermittant GERD symptoms. EGD done 1 month prior was normal by
his report.

CHRONIC DIAGNOSES:
# Interstitial lung disease: The patient reports that he has
asbestosis and is being followed by an outpatient pulmonologist.
 He was encouraged to discuss his recent admission with his
pulmonologist after discharge.

# Hypertension: The patient was continued on Amlodipine and
Atenolol

# Psychiatric Disorder NOS: Patient was noted to have pressured
speech, flight of ideas, and tangential thinking during his
admission.  He was continued on his home medications including
clonazepam, soma, cymbalta, and ambien.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
# Follow-Up: The patient should follow-up with his outpatient
pulmonologist in [**2-24**] weeks as well as his primary care
physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] discharge, he was given an appointment for
outpatient pulmonary function tests.

Medications on Admission:
* Gemfibrozil 600mg daily
* Atenolol 25mg daily
* Amlodipine 10mg daily
