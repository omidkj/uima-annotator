Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2698**]
Chief Complaint:
NSTEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization
Hemodialysis
Tunneled dialysis catheter placement


History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 72y.o M with a PMH of CAD, AF, CRI now with NSTEMI.
Pt initally admitted to OSH with complaints of increased chest
discomfort at rest. Found to have NSTEMI with CK peak 362 CKMB
12-16% per report and Trop 2.33. Creatinine [**3-23**]. Being
transferred with plan for catheterization on Friday after
evaluation by renal team re: possible placement of dialysis
catheter for likely need of post cath dialysis.

Pt previously admitted with angina [**4-24**] however had an ECG
without changes and had flat CE. Since cardiac catheterization
would be a high risk procedure in the setting of his chronic
renal nsufficiency, he was medically managed.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

On arrival to the medical floor the patient reports [**4-26**] chest
tightness without radiation, similar to prior. Denies dyspnea,
nausea, diaphoresis.

Past Medical History:
1. CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: Dyslipidemia, Hypertension

2. CARDIAC HISTORY:
-PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS [**11/2141**]:
-->LMCA without disease
-->LAD with diffuse disease and vasospasm, reversed with TNG
-->D1: ulcerated 80% lesion
-->LCX: distal vasospasm, reversed with TNG
-->RCA: Severe diffuse disease with serial 90% lesions in the
PDA and 80% stenosis in the mid-RCA
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Acute myocardial infarction, secondary to severe LAD and LCx
coronary vasospasm. This was managed by intracoronary and
intravenous diltiazem and nitroglycerin therapies.

3. OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

cath with NTG

TTE ([**2-23**]): The left atrium is elongated. Mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid inferolateral wall to
distal inferior wall akinesis. LVEF 50-55%. [**11-18**]+ MR. Mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Carotid U/S ([**2-23**]):
1. Calcified plaque with 40-59% stenosis of the right internal
carotid
artery.
2. Calcified plaque with less than 40% stenosis of the left
internal carotid artery.

Cardiac cath ([**2-24**]):
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this co-dominant system
demonstrated severe three vessel coronary artery disease.  The
LMCA had no angiographically apparent disease.  The LAD had a
70% very distal to
apical disease.  There was an 80% diffuse stenosis in a small to
medium
1st diagonal branch.  The LCX had a second OM with a 90%
stenosis and a
TO in the OM3.  There was insignificant plaquing in the large L
posterolateral branch.  The RCA had an 80% distal stenosis and a
diffuse
60-70% stenosis in a small PDA.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left
ventricular
enddiastolic filling pressures at 13 and 16 mmHg.  The mean PA
pressure
was 23 mmHg (phasic 35/13 mmHg).  The PCWP was 16 mmHg.  The
cardiac
index was 3.5 L/min/m2.  The mean systemic arterial pressure was
91
(161/56 mmHg).
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the RCA with a 3.0x18mm
Vision stent.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no
angiographically
apparent dissection and TIMI III flow (See PTCA comments).
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the OM2 with a 2.0x23mm Mini
Vision
stent. Fianl angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no
angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI III flow (See PTCA

comments).
5. Unsuccessful attempt to PTCA of the small 1st diagonal
branch.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. NSTEMI: His cardiac markers trended down at [**Hospital1 18**]. He was
initially started on heparin and nitroglycerin drips, and
continued on ASA, clopidogrel, carvedilol, and statin. Echo
showed new akinesis of inferior/inferolateral walls, although
preserved EF. He went to cardiac cath, where he had stenting of
RCA and OM2. He was transferred to the CCU afterwards for HTN.
He was initially controlled with nitroprusside and nitroglycerin
gtt. Upon arrival to CCU patient was only on nitroglycerin gtt
and this was quickly weaned off. He had slightly higher BPs in
the morning and was started on captopril, later changed to
lisinopril. CK and CKMB were followed and trended down. He was
subsequently asymptomatic except for an episode of CP with
