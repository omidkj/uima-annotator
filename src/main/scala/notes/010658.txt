Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 678**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain and vomiting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tunnelled hemodialysis catheter placement
AV fistula
Hemodialysis


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 107485**] is a 57 yo male with a h/o chronic pancreatitis,
CHF, and polysubstance abuse who presented with 3 days of
abdominal pain and vomiting. Epigastric pain similar to prev.
pancreatitis flare. + emesis (nonbloody and non-billious). Poor
po intake for a few days. He says he has felt intermittent
fevers and chills as well. He denies diarrhea. He says that he
had one drink on the day prior to admission but denies drinking
very much over the past week aside from this one drink.
.
The pt went to the ED at his girlfriend's urging. On arrival,
his vital signs were: T98.3, P118, BP200/94, R18, O2sat 92% on
room air. He was placed on a nitro drip for his hypertension.
His O2 sat dropped to 83% on room air and he was placed on a
non-rebreather-->O2 sats rebounded to the high 90's. He was
found to have elevated pancreatic enzymes and a cxr suggestive
of CHF vs. pneumonia. He was given Zofran 4mg IV, Lasix 60mg IV,
Atarax 25mg po for pruritis, Levaquin 500mg IV and Flagyl 500mg.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for management of hypertensive
urgency.
.
On review of systems, pt complains of productive cough x many
weeks (since discharge in late [**2154-3-14**] for pneumonia). He
says he brings up greenish sputum that occasionally contains
blood. He also complains of vague chest pain that "comes and
goes" and has been going on for an undefined period of time. He
says he has been compliant with his meds. He does admit to
smoking crack 1 day PTA.

.
[**5-9**] cxr: Again, there is significant cardiac enlargement.
Marked perivascular haze is consistent with pulmonary congestion
in the pulmonary circulation. Bilaterally, the diaphragmatic
contours are
obliterated by pleural densities more on the right than the
left. When comparison is made with the next previous examination
([**4-9**], frontal view) the degree of pleural effusion and
pulmonary congestion appears more marked. Possibility of
inflammatory processes on the lung bases obscured by the pleural
effusion cannot be excluded.
.
EKG: Supraventricular tachycardia with atrial rate 230,
ventricular rate 116. Normal QRS axis. IVCD w/ RBBB morphology.
1mm ST segment depressions in leads II, III, aVF.
.
Echo [**1-20**] -
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is 16-20
mmHg. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate to
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (ejection fraction 30
percent). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular free wall
is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right
ventricular systolic function appears depressed. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is at least moderate (possibly severe) pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.  Compared with the findings of the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2153-10-3**], the pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is increased. The right ventricle appears more dilated
and hypocontractile now; the left ventricular ejection fraction
may be somewhat further reduced. The mitral and tricuspid
regurgitation are increased.

Brief Hospital Course:
57 yo male with h/o pancreatitis, chf and polysubstance abuse
admitted with hypertensive urgency and pancreatitis.
.
1) Pancreatitis - On admision with Amylase 701, Lipase 2089, and
abdominal pain c/w prior pancreatitis flares all consistent with
acute-on-chronic pancreatitis. Likely etiology is alcohol (pt
admits to drinking PTA and has h/o polysubstance abuse). He was
made NPO, pain control with tylenol and dilaudid, and diet
advanced slowly as tolerated (patient was repeatedly
non-adherent to dietary restrictions while NPO, frequently seen
eating chocolate and sandwiches from the kitchen).
.
2) Acute renal failure: This was acute on chronic (long-standing
DM and HTN), with baseline Cr ~4.0-5.0.  Creatinine was at
approximate baseline on admission, then doubled with minimal
urine output likely due to ATN as muddy brown casts observed in
sediment; possible compounded by cocaine and NSAID use. Renal
was consulted. A tunneled HD line was placed and dialysis was
initiated without complications. Urine output improving and Cre
returned to near baseline in the setting of HD. An AV fistula
was placed by the Transplant surgery team. He will start MWF
dialysis at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9449**] and received epoetin alfa and zemplar
dosed at HD. An ACEi was restarted prior to discharge.
.
3) HTN: Hypertensive urgency on admission with SBPs 190's-200's
in ED, admitted to the ICU and treated with nitro gtt with
improvement. Started
