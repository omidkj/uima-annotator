Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath, chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catherization


History of Present Illness:
Most of history obtained via notes from OSH and cardiology, who
was able to speak with family, as family no longer at bedside
and pt. intubated/sedated.  In brief, he is a 67 yo with h/o CAD
s/p CABG, with gradually worsening DOE in last 1-2 months, who
was initially seen at [**Hospital3 1443**] for dyspnea on exertion
with concern for unstable angina and was started on heparin gtt.
 While being admitted, he had acute left-sided chest pain,
tachypnea, concurrent with systolic to 200s while getting his
blood drawn, with apparent desaturations, not recorded.  At this
point, pt. was intubated, given 140mg IV lasix, nitro gtt with
concern for flash pulmonary edema [**12-18**] acute MI, and transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath.  ABG prior to transfer showed 7.14/58/323
with trop 0.12 in setting of Cr 2.7
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, SBPs fell to 72/50, so nitro gtt
stopped, with return of SBPs to 140s/150s.  ABG on arrival
7.27/45/264, settings unclear.  EKG showed TWI in inferior
leads, V6.  Initial ABG
7.27/45/264 on unclear settings.  CXR here showed good ETT and
OG tube placement, with no acute cardiopulmonary process.
Repeat enzymes here showed trop 0.18 with negative CKs.
.
Of note, pt. had renal artery stent about 4 weeks ago.  In
addition, had been off plavix for 3d as he had had some rectal
bleeding from chronic hemmorhoids.
.
On review of symptoms per cards notes and OSH, he denies any
prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary
embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint
pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools.  + hemmorhoidal bleeding
in last week. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. Mild
exertional cramping in legs and throughout body. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for chest pain, dyspnea on
exertion, without paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle
edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.

Pertinent Results:

.
CTA Chest:
1. No PE.
2. No overt CHF.
3. Dependent atelectasis and pleural effusions bilaterally.
4. Emphysema.
5. Evidence of old granulomatous disease.
6. Coronary artery disease.
.
EKG demonstrated sinus brady at 53 with peaked Ts in v2-v4, TWI
in inferior leads, V6, with sl. deeper TWIs in inferior leads
compared with prior dated [**12-24**].
.
Cardiac Catheterization [**2180-2-18**]
1. The native coronary circulation was not engaged due to known
proximal
occlusion and need to conserve contrast use in light of severe
renal
insufficiency.
2. The arterial conduit (LIMA) was not engaged as it is known to
be
atretic per recent cath.
3. Selective coronary angiography of the 4 vein grafts revealed
occlude
RSVG-dRCA and RSVG-OM1. The RSVG-D1 and the RSVG-OM2 were
patent. The
RSVG-OM2 had moderate disease throughout similar to the findings
of the
cardiac catheterization from 7/[**2178**].
4. Limited resting hemodynamic assessment revealed normal
systemic
arterial pressure (127/65 mmHg) and borderline elevated
pulmonary
arterial pressure (27/12 mmHg). The left- and right-sided
filling
pressures were normal (mean PCWP 9 mmHg and RVEDP 8 mmHg). The
cardiac
output and cardiac index were normal at 5.7 l/min and 3.5
l/min/m2
respectively.
5. Left ventriculography was deferred due to renal
insufficiency.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Known severe obstructive three vessel coronary artery
disease. The
native coronary arteries were not engaged.
2. Ocluded RSVG-OM1 and RSVG-RCA.
3. Patent RSVG-OM2 and RSVG-D1.
4. The LIMA was not engaged as it is known to be atretic.
5. Normal left and right ventricular filling pressures.
6. Left ventriculography was deferred.

RENAL U.S.  [**2180-2-21**] 2:45 PM
FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 9.5 cm. Normal color
vascularity is seen throughout the right kidney. The left kidney
measures 7.9 cm. A simple cyst measuring 1.6 x 0.8 cm is seen in
the interpolar region of the left kidney. Normal color
vascularity is seen throughout the left kidney. In the main
renal artery, peak systolic velocity is 40 cm/sec with sharp
systolic upstroke. Normal waveforms are visualized in the left
renal vein.
IMPRESSION:
1. Normal waveform in the left renal artery. In comparison with
the examination of [**2180-2-15**], the left renal artery is
better visualized but probably not significantly changed.
2. Left renal cyst.
.
CHEST (PRE-OP PA & LAT)  [**2180-2-22**] 6:14 PM
FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest. The patient is
status post median sternotomy, sternotomy wires are unchanged.
Mediastinal surgical clips are again noted. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There is no
pneumothorax, consolidation, or pleural effusion. The pulmonary
vasculature is normal. The osseous structures are unchanged.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
