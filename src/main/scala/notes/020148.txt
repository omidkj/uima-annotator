Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Inferior MI.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 86-year-old Caucasian
female with past medical history significant for known
intervenable three vessel disease status post inferior MI in
9/00.  At that time she elected only for medical treatment.
She also has a history of hypertension, auto immune hemolytic
anemia, CLL and CHF with an EF of 30-40% who presents with
chest pain on the day of admission since 2 p.m. associated
with mild shortness of breath.  She was brought to the
Emergency Room by her daughter where EKG showed ?????? to [**Street Address(2) 4793**]
elevation in the inferior leads, lead 3 greater than lead 2,
ST elevation V1 and V2, and right sided lead showing ?????? mm V4
elevation.  Initial CPK was 400, troponin 0.5.  She was given
Aspirin, Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg sublingual which caused her
systolic blood pressure to drop from 100 to 89.  Her blood
pressure responded to one liter normal saline.  She was then
made pain free with Morphine 2 mg and 2.5 mg IV Lopressor.
At the same time she was started on Heparin GTT despite being
guaiac positive.  Systolic blood pressure again went to the
mid 80's with mean arterial pressure of 60 which again
responded to normal saline 1 liter.  Chest x-ray showed
deviated trachea and mild CHF.  Per family discussion, she
will not have cath or CABG.  She continues to be full code
and was brought to the CCU for further management.  At the
time of transfer she was comfortable without chest pain or
shortness of breath.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Coronary artery disease, status
post inferior MI in 9/00, cath in 9/00 showed 100% proximal
RCA lesion, left main with 20% lesion, proximal LAD with 80%
lesion, LAD 90% lesion, D1 80% lesion, D2 90% lesion,
proximal left circumflex 100% lesion, OM1 70% lesion with
cardiac output of three liters.  2) Hypertension.  3) Auto
immune hemolytic anemia.  4) Pelvic mass, refused
intervention.  5) Hypercholesterolemia.  6) CLL.  7)
Glaucoma.  8) Congestive heart failure with EF of 30-40%.  9)
Spinal stenosis.  10) Depression.  11) Hip fracture.  12) ?
hokum.

MEDICATIONS:  On admission, Aspirin 81 mg po q d, Lipitor 10
mg po q d, Folic Acid 1 mg po q d, Multivitamin one tablet po
q d, Zoloft 50 mg po q d, Neurontin 300 mg po tid, Lopressor
50 mg po bid, Prednisone 20 mg po q d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with her son and daughter, denied
alcohol or tobacco use.

ALLERGIES:  Percocet and Codeine which cause nausea.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 11.2, hematocrit 37, platelet
count 108,000, INR 0.9, PTT 23.3, Chem 7 shows sodium 146,
potassium 5.4, chloride 107, CO2 25, BUN 42, creatinine 1.2,
sugar 154, CK 413, troponin 0.5.  Chest x-ray showed deviated
trachea with mild failure.  EKG with pain showed normal sinus
rhythm with rate of 82, normal axis and intervals, [**Street Address(2) 4793**]
elevation in lead 3, ?????? mm ST elevation in AVF, lead 2 and 1-[**Street Address(2) 12501**] elevation in V1 and V2.  On right sided leads there was
?????? mm elevation on V4.  Pain free EKG showed improved ST
elevations in leads 3, AVF, decreased ST depressions in lead
1, AVL, decreased ST elevations in V1 and V2.  Echocardiogram
from [**7-/2191**] showed mild LAE, mild focal septal hypertrophy, LV
depression with inferior hypokinesis, posterior akinesis and
lateral hypokinesis.  There is also trace AR and mild to
moderate MR with no effusions.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, vitals afebrile, heart
rate 70-80, normal sinus, respiratory rate 20, satting 99% on
two liters, blood pressure 100/70.  In general this is a
pleasant elderly female in no acute distress.  HEENT:  Pupils
are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation,
extraocular movements intact, oropharynx clear, mucus
membranes dry with an old abrasion on the left forehead.
Neck, JVP elevated, radiating murmur to the right carotid, 2+
carotids, trachea midline.  Chest clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Cardiovascular, regular rate and rhythm, S1 and
S2 normal.  3/6 systolic ejection murmur best heard at right
upper sternal border.  Abdomen nontender, non distended,
normal active bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly.  Rectal
guaiac positive per Emergency Room.  Extremities, clean, dry
and intact.  PT and DP pulses 2+.  Neuro, alert and oriented
times three, grossly non focal.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiovascular:  A) Coronary artery disease.  Mrs.
[**Known lastname 93077**] was admitted to CCU for further management and
observation.  All medications were restarted, but Lopressor
was decreased to 25 mg po bid.  She was ruled out for an MI
with three consecutive cardiac enzymes which showed
decreasing CPK but no significant troponin leak.  She was
also started on Heparin in the Emergency Room as well as
Plavix 75 mg po q d.  Heparin GTT was discontinued on [**2192-9-21**]
after she ruled out for MI.  She underwent echocardiogram
that morning which showed mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with overall left ventricular systolic function
mildly depressed and posterior hypokinesis present.  EF was
45-55%.  There were mildly thickened aortic valve and mitral
valve leaflets with 1-2+ mitral regurgitation.  Overall LV
function appeared to be improved from previous report.
Cholesterol panel was also checked the morning of admission
which showed the following:  Total cholesterol 288,
triglycerides 120, HDL 61 and LDL 203. At this time Lipitor
was increased to 20 mg po q d.  B) Pump.  Mrs. [**Known lastname 93077**] was
hemodynamically stable.  Her blood pressure responded well to
IV fluid boluses as evidenced in the Emergency Room.
Echocardiogram showed improved EF.  Her systolic blood
pressure was well maintained and ACE inhibitor was added on
[**2192-9-20**].

3.  Pulmonary:  Miss [**Known lastname 93077**] [**Last Name (Titles) 8337**] IV fluids without
pulmonary edema or dropping O2 sats.

4.  GI:  As stated above, Miss [**Known lastname 93077**] was guaiac positive
but could be secondary to hemorrhoids.  She was started on GI
prophylaxis with Protonix.

5.  Heme:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 93077**] has a history of auto immune
hemolytic anemia.  On the night of admission she was started
on stress dose Hydrocortisone 60 mg IV tid, and on the
following day her systolic blood pressure was stabilized and
she was decreased to 20 mg po q d of Prednisone.

DISPOSITION:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 93077**] is full code.  She will be
discharged to rehab with the following medications: Aspirin
81 mg po q d, Lipitor 20 mg po q d, Folic Acid 1 mg po q d,
MVI one tablet po q d, Zoloft 50 mg po q d, Neurontin 300 mg
po tid, Lopressor 50 mg po bid as [**Known lastname 8337**], Prednisone 20 mg
po q d, ACE inhibitor or Captopril 6.25 mg po tid.
