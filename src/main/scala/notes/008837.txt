DIAGNOSIS:
Stomach, subtotal gastrectomy:
1.  Gastric segment with invasive adenocarcinoma, diffuse type,
with focal signet ring cell morphology, arising in a background
of chemical gastropathy with glandular dysplasia; see synoptic
report.
2. Duodenum with no carcinoma seen.




Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted for completion gastrectomy and
jejunostomy. Given her significant comorbidities and exceedingly
high perioperative risk for morbidity and mortality, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1924**]
advised perhaps neoadjuvant treatment with chemotherapy
followed by surgery if she remained without evidence of
metastatic disease and tolerated the therapy. However, Ms. [**Known lastname **]
refused to consider this approach in favor of up-front surgery.
She understood the significant risks of the surgery
and consented to proceed. She was pre-op'd and consented. She
was given one unit of IVIG one hour prior to surgery.
.
The patient was admitted to Trama/surgical ICU for close
assessment. On [**3-30**] she her acidosis improved and she was
extubated. She was than transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name **] 5.
.
She was started on supervised sips advanced to regular diet and
tube feeds via J-tube were started and advanced to goal rate.
She tolerated both well.  When she reached goal rate her TF was
cycled over 14 hours. The patient's foley was removed and she
voided with out any issues.
.
The patient appeared to be confused, not able to remember name
of her daughter. Neurology was consulted and an MRI was done.
MRI was with in normal limits. All of the patient's home
medications were restarted. The patient's mental status returned
to baseline. UA was negative.
.
Chest physical therapy was done q 4hrs., physical therapy and
occupational therapy were consulted and recommended that the
patient go to rehab.
.
The patient's staples were removed and steri strips were
applied. The patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1924**] in [**12-22**] weeks
and her PCP in one week or as needed.
