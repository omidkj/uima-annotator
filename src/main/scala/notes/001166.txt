Brief Hospital Course:
Brief Course:
36M with type I DM and gastroparesis recently admitted for DKA
(discharged on [**2187-8-29**]) who presented with nausea and coffee
ground emesis and DKA. He was treated with insulin drip and
received dialysis in house.

Active Issues:
#DKA: Likely secondary to witholding his insulin in the setting
of not eating due to nausea and vomiting from gastroparesis.
Anion gap was 29 on presentation with glucose of 209.
Electrolytes were initially checked q 4 hours and repleted when
needed until the gap was closed. Patient was started on insulin
drip and transitioned to subcutaneous insulin after his gap had
closed with 2 hour overlap. Patient is tolerating good PO and is
discharged on his home insulin regimen.

#Gastroparesis: Complication of type I DM. Likely the cause of
his nausea and vomiting. Patient's outpatient GI doctor has seen
the patient in the hospital. He was continued on eythromycin and
metoclopramide and given zofran and prochlorperazine prn for
nausea.

#Coffee ground emesis: Had similar episode in [**Month (only) 1096**], and EGD
at that time was largely normal. No more episodes while in
hospital and hematocrit was stable. Maintained active type and
screen. Possibly due to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tear from vomiting. PUD,
gastritis also in differential. Placed on PPI. Tolerating good
PO.

#ESRD: Chronic secondary to diabetes, on hemodialysis MWF. The
patient is currently on the dual pancreatic/kidney transplant
list. He missed his Monday dialysis session because it was the
day he came into the hospital, so he was dialyzed while in the
hospital on Tuesday and Wednesday. He will continue his
scheduled dialysis along with nephrocaps and sevelamer.

#HTN: Normalized after dialysis. Pt states that BP is usually
elevated prior to dialysis. He was continued on his home
clonidine patch, labetolol and lisinopril without issues.
