History of Present Illness:
62F with h/o COPD on 3L home O2, sCHF s/p ICD/Ppm, HTN, DM2
presents from [**Hospital3 2558**] with worsening SOB with exertion x
2 days.
.
Of note, the patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 112**] from [**2-21**] to
[**2-27**] for a facial burn sustained when she tried to smoke a
cigarette while on oxygen via nasal cannula. She was initially
on BiPap in the ED, was given high-dose steroids. Bronchoscopy
showed no airway edema or soot. On [**2-22**], she had flash pulmonary
edema and was treated with 40 mg IV Lasix. She was discharged on
her home meds and Prednisone taper.
.
She notes that yesterday she tried to be more active and was
getting up and moving around more and noticed that she felt more
short of breath doing activities - felt she couldn't catch her
breath. She was on her usual 3L nc at that time and didn't try
to increase the rate. She took a Duoneb inhaler yesterday, which
helped her SOB. Then this morning, she noticed that she again
had trouble catching her breath with activity. Duoneb inhaler
was given without improvement. She was given 40 mg Prednisone
(takes 20 mg chronically) and was brought to the ED.
.
In the ED, initial vitals 97.0  128 (sinus)  144/93  20  100% on
2L (home requirement is 3L). Exam was notable for absence of
wheezing, absence of significant crackles, and no LE edema. Labs
revealed Cr 0.5, WBC 17.1, Hct 27.5. CT-A was performed and
showed no PE; did reveal emphysema and a 7 mm LLL pulmonary
nodule. CXR showed COPD, dual-chamber Ppm/AICD, flat diaphragms,
and large cardiac silhouette - no infiltrate or edema. She was
given 1L NS, Solumedrol 125 mg, 5 mg Oxycodone for face/hand
pain, and Levaquin 750 mg IV. She was then transferred to the
floor.
.
Currently, VS are 115  159/83  18  99% on 3L. The patient
generally appears to be breathing comfortably and is in no
apparent distress. She speaks in full sentences. She denies
recent cough. Denies fevers/chills, no chest pain, no n/v,
dysuria, no recent illness. She did have her flu vaccine this
year. ROS is positive for diarrhea for a few days that resolved
one week ago, recent PND - was been waking up more often feeling
SOB, orthopnea - 1 pillow chronically, has gained [**4-11**] pounds
over 1.5 months.

Brief Hospital Course:
62F with h/o COPD on 3L home O2, sCHF s/p ICD/Ppm, HTN, DM2
presents from [**Hospital3 2558**] with worsening SOB with exertion x
2 days
.
# SOB: On presentation to the ED, the patient appeared to be
breathing comfortably; she was satting 99% on her home O2
requirement of 3L. CXR showed no infiltrate or evidence of
edema. CT-A was negative for PE. Exam revealed no wheezing or
significant crackles. She had been given 40 mg Prednisone at
[**Hospital3 2558**]. She received an additional 125 mg of Solumedrol
in ED and a dose of 750 mg IV Levaquin. On the floor, she
appeared comfortable. Antibiotics were discontinued. Nebulizers
were administered prn. On [**3-15**] AM, the patient became acutely SOB
after getting up to go to the bathroom. O2 sats were 95% on 2L.
CXR showed acutely worsened vascular congestion. She was given
80 mg IV Lasix with some improvement but still appeared to be in
significant respiratory distress. She was transferred to the
ICU.  In the MICU, she diuresed approximately 1.5 L from one
dose of Lasix 80 mg IV.  She was noted to be tachypneic with
minimal movements but did not desaturate, so she was eventually
transferred back to the floor on [**2183-3-16**].  Please see COPD
section for remainder hospital course.
.
# COPD: FEV1 listed as 27% in 11/[**2171**]. States that she hasn't
seen pulmonologist in a while but thinks she needs to see one
given multiple recent admits to [**Hospital1 112**]. 125 mg IV Solumedrol was
given initially in the ED. Bactrim DS 1 tab M/W/F was continued.
Home inhalers - Advair, Spiriva were continued.  On transfer to
the ICU, patient started on Levofloxacin daily for COPD
exacerbation, as patient has significant allergies to PCNs and
macrolides. Continued Prednisone 60 mg PO daily with a 2-week
taper. Attempted to use BiPAP but patient did not tolerate well
due to facial burns.  She was noted to be tachypneic with
minimal movements but did not desaturate, so she was eventually
transferred back to the floor on [**2183-3-16**].  On the floor, she
developed increased work of breathing and tachycardia.  Her O2
saturation at this time was noted to be 100% on 3L.  She had an
ABG on this O2 saturation, which demonstrated pH 7.32, pCO2 of
71, and pO2 of 132.  Given that her hypercarbia was felt
secondary to high O2 administration in the setting of COPD, her
oxygen was titrated down to 1 L, with resulting desaturation to
85 %; she was then tried on CPAP, which she failed to tolerate,
and she was then restarted on 3 L NC with improvement back up to
100%.  As she was thought to be dry on physical exam, she was
given 250 cc NS.  Her EKG was unchanged.  She was given Morphine
2 mg IV and was transferred back to the MICU on [**2183-3-17**] for
increasing nursing demand.  Over the next several days in the
ICU, her ABGs continued to improve.  Her Advair was increased to
500/50.  Her respiratory improved to the point that she was
called out to the floor for several days but a bed was not
available.  Anxiety and pain were thought to be a large
contribution to her dyspnea; her symptoms much improved with
Ativan and Morphine as needed.  She worked with physical therapy
daily to help maintain her strength.  On [**2183-3-21**], a bed became
available at
