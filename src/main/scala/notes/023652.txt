CT scan [**9-26**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Postoperative anterior subcutaneous fat inflammation along
with subcutaneous emphysema and minimal simple fluid collection
adjacent to the surgical drain site with a few pockets of air.
These findings are all likely postoperative, however,
superinfection of this small fluid cannot be excluded by CT
exam.

2. Bilateral simple pleural effusions (left greater than right)
with adjacent compression atelectasis of the lower lobes.

3. No intraabdominal/intrapelvic fluid collections. Likely
postoperative inflammation involving the mesentery and anterior
abdominal wall. Minimal amount of residual pneumoperitoneum is
noted.

4. Diverticulosis without evidence of acute diverticulitis.
Unchanged fatty infiltration of the liver.

Brief Hospital Course:
pt was admitted on [**2156-9-20**] for and taken to the OR on [**9-21**] for
transhiatal esophagectomy, pyloroplasty, reduction of hiatal
hernia and feeding J-tube. OR course uneventful. Pt had NGT,
chest tube, JP anastomotic drain, j-tube, PICC line in place.
Admitted to ICU intubated for obdervation. An epidural was
placed for pain control.
PT was extubated on POD#1 and transferred from the ICU on POD
#1. Pt required insulin drip in the ICU for glucose management.
Pain control was a major issue during his hospital course d/t
chronic pain issues and new acute post op pain issues. The acute
pain service followed [**Last Name (un) **] closely. His epidural was d/c'd POD#4
and pain management was via PCA and at the time of discharge pt
was rec'ing roxicet via J-tube and PRN ativan for anxiety
(longstanding issue)

Pt progressed w/ post op course. Trophic tube feeds were started
on POD#3 and when bowel function returned, tube feeds were
increased to goal and he was [**Last Name (un) 1815**] well at the time of
discharge.

On POD#5 pt had temp spike and cervical neck incisional
erythema, neck wound was draining bilious drainage and wound was
opened. CT scan as reported in results section. Anastomotic
drain was d/c'd and pt was started on vanco, cipro, flagyl.
erythema decreased and wound bed is clean and granulating. IVAB
were d/c'd and pt has remained afeb and erythemia is resloving.
QID wet to dry dressing changes continue.

[**Last Name (un) **] was consulted for glucose management since pt is unable
to take oral hypoglycemia agents at this time and we do not put
meds via j-tube to avoid clogging (except lopressor). He will
need SQ insulin until he is able to take po meds.

He was followed by PT and rehab was recommended.
