Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 70F h/o COPD, OSA, HTN, DM2 who presents from NH after
being found lethargic with MS changes and ARF
.
# Hypotension: No fever, leukocytosis, and elevated cardiac
enzymes in setting of ARF make cardiogenic process less likely
without ischemic changes on EKG. Etiology most likely urosepsis
with +UA and recently similar admission requiring ICU for
Urosepsis and unresponsiveness. Hypovolemic shock also
possibility given extremely dry MM and ARF. She was initially
covered broadly with Abx vanco/zosyn, also h/o GPC on blood
culture (coag neg staph, coming from NH). She was kept on a 5
day course of Vanco for MRSA in sputum, no infiltrate on CXR.
She was switched to ceftriaxone and completed 5 days for an E
coli UTI and switched to cefpodoxime po for a total 7 day course
of abx for the UTI. She never required pressors and BP responded
well to IVF boluses. She became Hypertensive when sedation was
weaned off.
.
# Altered mental status: Likely toxic-metabolic due to
infection, hypercarbia, and narcotic use with underlying COPD
(baseline pCO2 low 50s, HCO3 30). Pt responded to narcan but
only transiently. Pt also switched to morphine which is renally
cleared now with ARF. She was treated with Abx as above, she was
intubated for airway protection and hypercarbia. She was
extubated on [**10-5**] and her MS status cleared. She was kept on
oxycodone only for pain control and neurontin and escalation of
other narcotics were avoided. She was kept on BiPAP o/n with
plan to cont Bipap at any signs of lethargy. Her TSH was normal.
.
#. Respiratory: Pt desated in ED with O2 sat 86%RA. However, pt
very lethargic with depressed MS, most likely from obtundation
in setting of hypercarbia, narcotics and infection as above. No
evidence of pulm edema on CXR. COPD [FEV1 82% predicted [**8-16**]].
She was briefly intubaated with fiberoptic nasal intubation
given morbid obesity. She was successfully extubated [**10-5**] with
BiPAP o/n [**11-18**] for settings. She remained on RA while she was
extabated with O2 sats 88-92%goal given COPD. Her advair was
resumed.

# Acute renal failure: Baseline 1.0 now with ARF, unclear
etiology, NSAID related vs. hypotension/ATN, vs. rhabdo. Her CK
was never elevated significantly, she responded very well to IVF
with correction of Renal failure with fluids alone. Her diuretic
was subsequently resumed. Umyoglobin was negative. Her ACE-I was
also resumed.

.
# HTN: PT was significantly hypertensive with BP 180-210 range
requiring nitro gtt for [**2-15**] while she was NPO post extubation.
Her lisinopril was resumed at 40mg daily, her BB was titrated up
to 100mg TID and Norvasc was added [**10-6**] and increased to 10mg on
[**10-7**].

.
# DM2: HISS. Monitor FS.  Her orag hypoglycemics to be resumed
while on floor or outpati
