Chief Complaint:
left shoulder pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization [**2122-5-25**] with [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 5175**]


History of Present Illness:
Patient reports that she first experienced pain in her left
shoulder and radiating down her left arm yesterday morning.  She
was not exerting herself, not eating, she was playing cards
which she usually does most mornings before breakfast.  The pain
was very difficult to describe, not sharp or dull per se, she
thought it was her arthritis.  Lasted about 10 minutes and
spontaneously resolved without interventions.  Then this morning
she had another episode of similar left shoulder pain this am,
lasting a little longer, maybe about 1-2 hours.  She denies
having shortness of breath, nausea, or diaphoresis with these
episodes.  With the pain this am she had a second of
lightheadedness and that is why she decided to come in to the
hospital for it.

In the ED, initial vitals were 97.2 88 122/62 16 99% 2L NC.
Labs and imaging significant for troponin of 0.25 with normal
renal function and EKG with ST elevations in aVR and lead III >
II as well as depressions in I, II, V4-V6.  Otherwise NA/NI,
rate 80s, + LVH and LAE. Patient given heparin gtt, morphine,
and NTG in the ED then  taken immediately by cardiology to the
cath lab.  In the lab, she had totally occluded RCA, which was
old from [**2111**] and previous stent to LAD was patent.   Occluded
OM off a tortuous circ.  DES to circ to obstuse marginal.
Angioplasty to native circumflex. Perclose.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient is feeling well, no more pain
in the left shoulder.  She does not have any complaints.  She
does report history of caludication symptoms in the past and
some chronic shortness of breath, not exertional.  Denies PND.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She reports exertional calf pain.  All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations.

IMAGING:
[**2122-5-25**] CARDIAC CATH: 1) Selective angiography of this
right-dominant system demonstrated
significant three-vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA was
free of
angiographically-apparent flow-limiting stenoses.  The LAD had a
patent
proximal stent, with a long 60-70% mid-vessel eccentric
calcified
stenosis.  The LCx system had a 100% stenosis of a major OM
branch;
there was also a 90% mid-vessel stenosis.  The RCA was known to
have a
100% mid-vessel stenosis and filled via left-to-right
collaterals.
2) Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic arterial
normotension, with a central aortic pressure of 132/67 mmHg.
3) Successful PTCA of the LCx with a 2.5 mm balloon (see PTCA
comments).
4) Successful PTCA and stenting of the LCx into a major obtuse
marginal
branch with a 3.0 x 30 mm Resolute [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 7930**] to 3.25 mm
(see PTCA
comments).
5) Successful RFA Perclose (see PTCA comments).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful PTCA of the LCx with a 2.5 mm balloon.
3. Successful PCI of the LCx into a large obtuse marginal branch
with a
3.0 x 30 mm Resolute [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 7930**] to 3.25 mm.
4. Successful RFA Perclose.

valve chordae. Calcified tips of papillary muscles. No MS. Mild
(1+) MR. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of MR may be
significantly UNDERestimated.]

Borderline PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.

Suboptimal image quality - body habitus.

Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 35 %) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the
inferior, posterior, and lateral walls. The right ventricular
free wall thickness is normal. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with depressed free wall contractility. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. [
