Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3705**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
77 year old female with a history of MVR on coumadin and
thoracic aortic aneurysm, AF and O2-dependent COPD presenting
[**2147-5-25**] to an OSH with acute onset right chest pain radiating
around to the back. She went to an OSH and had a CT which
demonstrated a 4.8 X 4.8 cm fusiform descending aortic aneurysm
with question of periaortic hematoma. The patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for CT surgery evaluation. CT with contrast
at [**Hospital1 18**] did not demonstrate dissection and the patient was
transferred to the general surgery team for concern about
biliary issues. MRCP demonstrated resolving pneumobilia without
acute process.

MICU Admission H/P:
Ms. [**Known lastname 83274**] is a 77 y.o. F with history of MVR on coumadin and
TAA, atrial fibrillation, and COPD on home O2, initially
admitted to general surgery on [**5-25**] from [**Hospital 8125**] hospital concerned
for aortic dissection on OSH CTA.  She was admitted to Cardiac
Surgery and a repeat CTA was negative; however pneumobilia was
noted. She had an MRCP and was transferred to General Surgery.
On [**5-26**], she had a fever, leukocytosis, and RLL infiltrate was
noted on CXR.  She was started on levofloxacin, but continued to
have an increased oxygen requirment and fevers.  She was found
to have a multifocal pneumonia and coverage was broadened to
vanco/levo/flagyl.  She was transferred to medicine service on
[**5-28**] for multiple medical issues. She was noted to have ARF which
resolved with fluids.

Since being on the medical service, she continues to complain of
abdominal pain. KUB showed constipation/ileus and bowel regimen
has been aggressive.  Surgery was consulted on day of transfer
to ICU for possible obstruction. CT scan of chest/abd/pelvis did
not show obstruction, but did show diffuse distension of the
large bowel loops, large hematoma of the L flank area with foci
of active extravasaion, and multifocal pneumonia. IR, general
surgery and vascular surgery consults are following the patient.
Hct today was 26.5 to 24.4 prior to transfer. Due to abdominal
wall hematoma, the patient is being transferred to the ICU for
closer monitoring, including serial Hcts.

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI  (constipation, nausea, abdominal pain, L flank
pain)
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats. Denies shortness of
breath. Denied chest pain or tightness. Denied diarrhea. Denied
BRBPR or melena.

1. [**2147-5-25**] CTA C/A/P: Atherosclerotic thoracic aorta with
aneurysmal dilatation of the descending thoracic aorta. Tiny
nodular intraortic hypodensity at the hiatus is felt most likely
to repesent mural thrombus. No evidence for dissection. Left
renal hypodensity cannot be classified as a cyst and, therefore,
ultrasound is recommended on a non-rugent basis to further
evaluate. Moderate to severe emphysema. Right basilar
consolidations may represent atelectasis vs aspiration

2. [**2147-5-26**] MRCP: No evidence of cholangitis. Pneumobilia still
present though improved since CT examination from [**2147-5-25**].
Conventional anatomy status post cholecystectomy.  Geographic
region of inflammation/edema within the posterior aspect of the
right hepatic lobe. Likely simple hepatic cyst adjacent to
cholecystectomy clips. Benign 7-mm left adrenal adenoma.
Incompletely imaged thoracic aortic aneurysm and right basilar
lung
parenchymal consolidation for which more complete
characterization is
performed on CTA of the chest, abdomen and pelvis from [**2147-5-25**],
and please
refer to report from this time for further details and
recommendations.

3. [**2147-5-29**] Echo: The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%). Diastolic function could not be
assessed. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
mild global free wall hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at the
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is mild aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is
seen. A bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present. The
prosthetic mitral valve leaflets are thickened. The transmitral
gradient is normal for this prosthesis. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Mitral prosthesis with
high-normal gradients and trivial mitral regurgitation. Mildly
dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle. Mild calficic aortic
stenosis.

4. CT c/a/p ([**5-31**]): Diffuse distention of the large bowel loops
with no obstruction. Large hematoma of the left flank area with
foci of active extravasation. Multifocal pneumonia.
Pathologically enlarged mediastinal nodes which are most likely
reactive in origin. Aneurysm of the distal thoracic aorta.
Multiple bilateral non-obstructing kidney stones. Pneumobilia.

4B: CXR ([**5-31**]): IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**5-26**] through
[**5-27**]:
Pulmonary edema has cleared from the left lung, improved on the
right, but
right basal consolidation persists and may represent a focus of
pneumonia,
accompanied by a small right pleural effusion. Moderate
cardiomegaly is
stable. The array of the upper lobe vasculature in the right
lung suggests
substantial emphysema, which could explain the asymmetric
appearance of
pulmonary edema.

5. KUB ([**2147-6-1**])IMPRESSION: Multiple air-filled loops of large
bowel consistent with colonic ileus with no evidence of
obstruction or perforation. NG tube terminating in the stomach
with the side hole below the diaphragm. Stable pneumobilia.
Multifocal
