Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8928**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, Right upper quadrant pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
43F with h/o COPD, HepC, DM, and schizoaffective disorder
presents today with difficulty breathing and right upper
abdominal pain. She was recently discharged after a 5 days stay
at [**Hospital 189**] Hospital with a RUL pneumonia after presenting with
hemoptysis, treated with unknown antibiotics, PPD negative. She
returned to her psych facility yesterday, but was brought to [**Hospital1 **]
today with c/o RUQ/R flank pain and SOB and she was found to
have SpO2 87-90% on RA.. In addition to the SOB, she has chest
tenderness over right chest wall and has been febrile. She
denies characteristics of aspiration, does not have HIV to her
knowledge. She reports ongoing RUQ pain, possibily associated
with food. The patient says the pain goes to her right flank.
She has previously had a cholecystectomy. She denies dysuria,
but is having urgency.
In the ED, initial VS: 101.3 86 107/73 95% 6L NC. She denied SI
but was assigned a 1:1. SBPs were in the 90s (baseline per pt)
so given 1L NS. Labs notable for WBC 11.4 with 73N, ALT 49, AST
41, AP 145, Tbili 0.4, lipase 17, HCO3 32, TroT <.01 x1, CK-MB
1, d-dimer 2810, lactate 1.3, UA negative, ABG 7.36/61/117/36
after she was started on BiPAP. CXR showed patchy consolidation
in the mid/lower R lung c/f pneumonia, low lung volumes,
bibasilar atelectasis. CTA chest done for elevated d-dimer,
showed no PE but did reveal cavitating hypodense pneumonia in
the right lower lobe, concerning for necrotizing pneumonia,
prominent axillary, mediastinal, hilar and inguinal lymph nodes,
and prominent CBD at 12mm. Blood cultures were drawn. She was
given Vancomycin 1gram, Toradol 30mg, Cefepime 2g, Ativan 2mg IV
x1, Tylenol 1g, Methylpred 125mg, 2 ipratropium nebs, 1
albuterol neb x1. VS at transfer: 85/52 60 91% on BiPAP 12/6 80%
FiO2.

On arrival to the MICU, she reports breathing is much improved
since initiating BiPAP, denies CP, N/V, R flank/RUQ pain
resolved. Denies SI or HI. Per report from [**Hospital1 **], SBP in low
100s at baseline.

MICRO

      <10 PMNs and >10 epithelial cells/100X field.
      Gram stain indicates extensive contamination with upper
respiratory
      secretions. Bacterial culture results are invalid.
      PLEASE SUBMIT ANOTHER SPECIMEN

All blood cultures negative to date

CT C/A/P
1. Cavitating hypodense pneumonia in the right lower lobe,
concerning for
necrotizing pneumonia.
2. Prominent axillary, mediastinal, right hilar and inguinal
lymph nodes, some
of which may be reactive, but follow up is recommended after
treatment to
ensure resolution.
3. Prominent 12-mm common bile duct, which may be secondary to
cholecystectomy, but ampullary pathology cannot be excluded.

CXR
FINDINGS:  AP upright portable chest radiograph obtained.  Lung
volumes are
low.  There is patchy consolidation in the right mid and lower
lung concerning
for pneumonia.  Left basal opacity is most compatible with
atelectasis given
the associated volume loss.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size cannot
be assessed.
Bony structures are intact.

IMPRESSION:  Patchy consolidation in the right mid to lower lung
concerning
for pneumonia.  Low lung volumes with basilar atelectasis also
noted.



Brief Hospital Course:
43F with COPD/asthma, HCV, schizoaffective disorder who was
recently admitted to OSH with hemoptysis and treated for CAP,
now presenting with dyspnea, hypoxia, and RUQ pain and found to
have evidence of necrotizing pneumonia on chest imaging.

ACUTE
# Necrotizing pneumonia: Possible pathogens include anaerobes
given poor dentition, Strep. milleri, MRSA, Klebsiella,
Acinetobacter. Unknown what most recent antibiotic regimen was,
but given recent admission to [**Hospital6 204**] and
failure of oral antimicrobial regimen, the patient was treated
as a necrotizing healthcare associated pneumonia. No PE seen on
CTA. CHF seemed less likely given lack of known cardiac history
or evidence of volume overload though does raise concern with
furosemide on home med list. No isolated upper lobe cavitation
to suggest TB, PPD neg per report at OSH. She was started on
Clindamycin, Vancomycin, Cefepime. Sputum culture and blood
cultures sent but contaminated with upper airway flora. Placed
on standing bronchodilators but no empiric systemic steroids.
She was weaned off BiPAP and titrated to 4LNC.  Transitioned to
Vancomycin and Zosyn.  Will have received 3 days of IV
antibiotics on discharge, with resolution of fever, white count,
and improvement in oxygenation status and pain.  She will need 3
more weeks of IV [**Last Name (LF) 112289**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] follow-up with her
