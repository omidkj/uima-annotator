ASSESSMENT & PLAN:  This is an 82 year old woman with a
history of myeloproliferative disorder with thrombocytosis
who presents with an upper gastrointestinal bleed and is
status post esophagogastroduodenoscopy with thermal therapy
immediately prior to admission.  The patient was admitted to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit for transfusion, fluid
resuscitation and serial hematocrit checks.  Her aspirin was
held given her gastrointestinal bleeding.  Two peripheral
intravenous lines were placed for appropriate access.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  In the Emergency Department prior to EGD, the patient had
an nasogastric tube placed which revealed positive coffee
grounds on lavage that was not cleared immediately, and so it
was placed on suction.  The patient's hematocrit on arrival
was 39 but this dropped to 30.  For this reason, she was sent
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit after her first EGD
revealed blood in the antrum of the stomach, body and fundus,
a focus of clot of blood in the superior portion of the
pre-pyloric region with oozing, no actual source or cause
visualized.  Blood in the distal and anterior bulb and BICAP
electrocautery was performed for successful hemostasis.

While in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient
underwent a repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**11-24**],
which revealed blood in the fundus and pre-pyloric region and
an ulcer in the pre-pyloric region and successful injection
and BICAP electrocautery for hemostasis then as well.

While in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient's
hematocrit remained stable at around 33, and she was status
post transfusion of three units of packed red blood cells as
well as approximately eight liters of intravenous fluids.

Throughout the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay she was continued on
Protonix intravenously.  Her hematocrit was continued to be
checked and it was stable. She was continued on her Levoxyl
for her hypothyroidism.

Her blood pressure was adequately controlled throughout her
hospital stay.  On [**11-27**], given that the patient was
stable hemodynamically, it was decided that the patient could
be discharged home.
