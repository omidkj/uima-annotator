Admission Date:  [**2167-11-27**]       Discharge Date:  [**2167-12-9**]

Date of Birth:   [**2099-5-5**]       Sex:  F


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68 year old
female with a history of morbid obesity, history of sleep
apnea, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, congestive heart
failure with diastolic dysfunction, restrictive lung disease,
the Emergency Department with a chief complaint of increasing
shortness of breath for four to five days.  The patient had
mild productive cough but no fevers or chills.  Prior to her
admission on [**2167-11-27**], her O2 saturation dropped from the
low-90s which is her baseline, down to 78 to 80% at home with
a heart rate in the 130s to 140s.

of 99.8 F.; blood pressure 123/70; heart rate 130 to 140;
respirations 30; 02 saturation 80% on room air, up to 95% on
four to five liters.  She was found to be atrial fibrillation
with rapid ventricular response to the 140s and started on
heparin and Diltiazem for rate control.

After admission to the Medical Floor on [**2167-11-27**], she
required more oxygen to the point of 100% face mask.
Arterial blood gas was initially 7.23, 98, 117, 100%
non-rebreather mask; 7.25, 95, 58, on 5 liters nasal cannula,
to 7.25, 99, 75, on Bi-PAP, then to 7.26, 96, 72, on C-PAP.
She was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit on [**2167-11-28**],
for cardiac and respiratory failure.

Her issues in the Cardiac Care Unit included:
1.      Pulmonary:  Respiratory failure secondary to
hypoventilation secondary to morbid obesity in the setting of
restrictive lung disease and congestive heart failure.  The
patient did not require intubation and continued on Bi-PAP
and C-PAP.  She was started on potassium chloride and
progesterone to increase her respiratory drive.  On
[**2167-12-1**], the patient was started on nasal cannula O2
during the day with continued Bi-PAP at night.  Her O2
saturation on nasal cannula of four to five liters was as low
as 90%.
2.      Cardiovascular:  Congestive heart failure; the
patient was aggressively diuresed with intravenous Lasix, for
a total of nine liters negative while in the Cardiac Care
Unit.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation:  Started on
anti-coagulation on Diltiazem and digoxin.
3.      Gastrointestinal:  Constipation; aggressive bowel
regimen including Lactulose and GoLYTELY.
4.      Decreased mental status:  Believed to be secondary to
hypoxia and hypercarbia, resolved with improved oxygenation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Restrictive lung disease with PFTs, FEV of 1.38, 77%, FVC
    of 1.78, 71%, mild decrease in DLCO, on home O2 two to
    three liters at night.
2.  Morbid obesity.
3.  Presumed obstructive sleep apnea.
4.  Obesity hypoventilation syndrome.
5.  Congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction,
    echocardiogram in [**2166**] very limited, ejection fraction
    was 67% on stress test in [**2164**].  History of positive
    stress in 09 of [**2165**]; with reversible defects laterally
    and inferior laterally which was never worked up.
6.  Hypertension.
7.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
8.  Stasis dermatitis.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.9 F.; pulse 85 to 112;
blood pressure 93/60; respirations 23; O2 saturation 90% on
five liters nasal cannula, 95% on non-rebreather face mask.
In general, the patient alert, in no acute distress sitting
in a chair.  HEENT:  Oropharynx is clear.  Moist mucous
membranes.  Neck supple.  Unable to assess jugular venous
pressure secondary to morbid obesity.  Cardiovascular:
Irregularly irregular rhythm, normal S1 and S2.  Grade II/VI
systolic ejection murmur at right upper sternal border.
Lungs:  Rare crackles bilateral bases.  Abdomen obese, soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  Three plus non-pitting edema bilaterally to the
thighs.  Right upper extremity edema near PICC line.
Decreased range of motion of right shoulder secondary to
pain.  Erythema of bilateral calves but not warm to touch.

LABORATORY:  CBC within normal limits.  INR 2.8.  Sodium 143,
chloride 93, potassium 4.4, bicarbonate 41, BUN 12,
creatinine 0.4.

Chest x-ray unchanged from previous studies, shows congestive
heart failure and bilateral pleural effusions.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.      Pulmonary:  Hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary
to morbid obesity/hypoventilatioin and CHF.  She was continued on
nasal cannula during
the day.  Her O2 saturations improved to 93 to 97% on 2
liters via nasal cannula.  An attempt to continue Bi-PAP at
night was tried, however, the patient's O2 saturations
dropped to the high 80s on bi-PAP.  Instead, she was kept on
her nasal cannula at night.  The patient was tried on CPAP but
did not tolerate this either. 2. Cardiovascular:  Congestive
heart failure; the
patient continued to be diuresed with intravenous Lasix.
Total diuresis to date negative 12 to 15 liters.

Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter:  Cardiology
was consulted for a possible transesophageal echocardiogram
and cardioversion.  They did not recommend cardioversion now as
she cannot tolerate TEE due to need to lie flat.Plan to f/u with
cardiology as outpatient after several weeks anticoagualtion and
consider cardioversion at that time. The patient was
continued on Diltiazem and digoxin.  Her rate was still
poorly controlled.  A beta blocker was added.  There
is a questionable history of beta blocker intolerance
with wheezing reported on prior admit however pt's OMR med list
indicates that she was on atenolol at the time of admisison. She
had no wheezing while on beta blockers here ofr last 2 days of
admit.

Coronary artery disease:  The patient has a history of
positive stress tests with reversible defects.  Cardiology
was consulted for possible cardiac catheterization.  The
patient refused cardiac catheterization since she is unable
to lie flat.  The patient was continued on Statin and
aspirin.Repeat TTE was done that showed decraesd EF of 35-40%
and multiple regional wall motion abnormalities. beta blocker
and ACE-I have been added to help with CAD and CHF managament.

Aortic stenosis murmur on examination with mild AS confirmed on
echo this admit.
3. Hematology:  The patient on anti-coagulation for
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
4.      Right shoulder pain:  Right shoulder films were
normal.  The patient's pain improved spontaneously without
intervention.She appears to have right rotator cuff tendonitis
vs bursitis. [**Month (only) 116**] need PT to help increase use and could use
tylenol or low dose nsaids for increased pain.
5.      GI:  severe Constipation; the patient needs to be
maintained standing regimen of lactulose and titrate as needed to
maintain 1 BM per day
6. Diabetes mellitus: The patient was continued on home
medications, Glucophage and Avandia as well as a Regular
insulin sliding scale.Her glucotrol and amaryl were added back
the day prior to discharge.

Code Status:  The patient is "DO NOT RESUSCITATE",
"DO NOT INTUBATE", however, patient is agreeable to Medical
Intensive Care Unit transfer for pressors as necessary.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge patient to Rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:    Stable.Of note, pt says her breathing is
better than it has been in 2 years. She uses home O2.
