HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is an 86-year-old
gentleman who was leaving his eye doctors when [**Name5 (PTitle) **] [**Name5 (PTitle) 50921**]
over his walker and fell on his head.  CT showed a left large
subarachnoid hemorrhage with bifrontal contusions.  Patient
was transferred to [**Hospital6 256**] for
further management.

On admission the patient had left medial orbital wall
fracture, left subarachnoid hemorrhage, left orbital
hematoma, small splenic laceration times two, non-filling
left common femoral and ileac veins.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  T-max is 97, heart rate
65, BP 133/44, respiratory rate 22, sats 100%.  The patient
is intubated.  Patient is moving all extremities, agitated
when off sedation.  Regular rate and rhythm for his cardiac.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended.  Chest is clear to
auscultation.  Head:  A 6 cm laceration or abrasion above his
left eye.

DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:  Head CT on admission showed extensive
subarachnoid hemorrhage with parenchymal hemorrhage in the
left occipital lobe in both high frontal lobes.  There may be
other areas of contusion that share injury as well, but they
may be masked by diffuse subarachnoid bleed.  There are thin
bilateral subdural effusions.  There is no ventricular
dilation in the basal cisterns.  Spaces are well visualized.
There is a fracture of the left superior medial orbital wall
and adjacent frontal sinus.  Fluid is seen within the frontal
sinus, left ethmoid air cells, and left maxillary sinuses.
Mastoid air cells and sphenoid sinuses are normally aerated.
No fractures of the calvarium are appreciated.  There is
extensive soft tissue swelling in the left forehead region,
extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage and intraparenchymal
hemorrhages, hematomas.

Repeat scan on [**2169-8-24**] showed intraparenchymal hematoma
involving most of the temporal lobe causing a flattening of
the right lateral ventricle and slight shift of normally
midline structures to the left.  There is no herniation, no
hydrocephalus.  The blood in the subarachnoid space and the
basal cisterns, contusions in both frontal lobes, and in the
occipital lobe is unchanged.  There is swelling of the
cerebral parenchyma and decreased [**Doctor Last Name 352**] white matter
differentiation.  Large new intraparenchymal hemorrhage
involving most of the right temporal lobe with a slight shift
that is normally midline.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was taken to the OR on [**2169-8-24**] for
evacuation of temporal lobe contusion.  Head CT at that time
showed a large amount of air within the skull extending from
the right parietal region across the midline and anterior to
the left frontal lobe, extensive high attenuation material is
present in both hemispheres consistent with subarachnoid and
intraparenchymal hemorrhage. There has been interval
evacuation of a large area of hemorrhage in the right
temporal region.  Mass effect is still seen with parietal
compression of the right lateral ventricle.  There is no
midline shift and no evidence of brain herniation.

Patient opened his eyes to stimulation.  Pupils:  Left
slightly larger than the right but briskly reactive.  Tries
to localize in the arms, moving the left leg to stimulation,
withdraws the right leg.  He is neurologically stable.

Patient continued to have poor neuro exams, opening his eyes
slightly two to three times with painful stimulation,
otherwise does not.  Right pupil 3 to 4 mm and briskly
reactive.  Left pupil 3 to 5 and sluggishly reactive.  Left
arm not noted to spontaneously lift and fall a couple of
times, but bilateral lower extremities withdraw to painful
stimulation.  Right arm noted to faintly withdraw to nail bed
stimuli.  CT yesterday showed no major change when compared
to previous.  Patient continued to be monitored closely.  The
head CT did show left cortical parietal infarct involving
right parietal cortical infarct as well.

Family meeting was done on [**2169-8-31**].  Family was going to
withdraw care and make patient comfort measures on Sunday.
The patient continued to have progressively worsening CT scan
and progressive decline in neurologic status, becoming less
responsive.  He had been made a DNR/DNI.  All supportive
measures were to continue until Sunday.  On [**2169-8-31**]
patient had no reaction to pain.  Pupils were sluggishly
reactive.  Patient was informed of the grave prognosis and
did want to continue until Sunday to continue to support the
patient.

On [**2169-9-2**] patient had an episode of hypotension.
Patient's family was notified of his poor prognosis, and the
patient's family made the patient comfort measures only, and
the patient died on [**2169-9-2**].
