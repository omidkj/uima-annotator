CXR: lungs well inflated; heart slightly enlarged; interstitial
edema and kurly b lines in lower lobes c/w CHF; no infiltrate;
no comparisons; emphysema

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P
1. Dyspnea: Admitted to floors with ongoing diagnosis of
CHF/pulmonary edema secondary to renal failure. Pt given 80 mg
IV lasix in the ED. On the floor, the pt became acute dyspnic
and tachypnic, with diastolic pressures in the 110-120's and HR
in the 120's. CXR showed likely flash pulmonary edema, and pt
given lopressor and hydralazine at bedside with little effect.
During initial event, pt was satting 88% on NRB, but after being
given an additional lasix, came up into the mid 90's on 100%NRB.
Due to persistent diastolic hypertension and dyspnea, however,
pt was transferred to the MICU for 1 day for closer monitoring.
In the MICU, pt had hemodialysis, after which her respiratory
status markedly improved. Pt was moved back to floor where a
tunnelled catheter was placed successfully for Hemodialysis. Pt
very resistant to starting Hemodialysis, and was skeptical in
her ability to follow the regimen of HD 3 days a week. Social
work and neurobehavioral psych called to evaluate pt's ability
to cope with new diagnosis in addition to waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental
status, mood changes. Seen by psych who did not think patient
had depression or strange affect, but stated the contrary, that
patient appeared to be competent. Changes in mood attributed to
mild post dialysis delirium. Mood improved HD #4 24 hours after
last dialysis.
2. Hyptothyroid: continued on synthroid, though TSH in-house 10.
Levothyroxine was increased to 125 mcg per day. Pt should be
followed up for further evaluation and workup as outpatient.
3. CHF: was ruled out for MI by enzymes. Had no complaints
during hospital visit.
5. Anemia: secondary to renal failure; remained on epoetin.
Should be re-evaluated and possibly started on Fe
supplementation as outpatient.
6. HTN: most likely [**1-2**] Renal failure, and improved with
hemodialysis.
7. CVS: P-MIBI done to evaluate possible etiology causing flash
pulmonary edema at the beginning of hospital course, which
showed fixed lateral defect and EF ~41%. No further cardiac
intervention done on this visit.
8. Hyponatremia: Unclear etiology. Some thoughts were low sodium
levels secondary to fluid overload from ESRD, increased body
water/Na ratio, serreptitious po intake. Levels improved to 128
upon discharge after HD. Pt discharged with instructions to
limit fluid intake to 4 glasses of water/equivalents per day. Na
level will be checked at next HD tomorrow AM.
