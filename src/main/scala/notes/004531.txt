History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 66 year-old woman with a past medical history of
prior lung cancer s/p left pneumonectomy, COPD, history of
breast cancer s/p radiation/lumpectomy, multiple recent
hospitalizations for pneumonia, initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] on [**6-24**] with shortness of breath and persistent cough.
She had a recent admission at the beginning of [**Month (only) 116**] for a CAP,
COPD exacerbation during which she had a CTA of her chest which
showed a new lobulated right upper lobe mass invasive into the
airways, with possible postobstructive pneumonitis, highly
suspicious for malignancy. She was apparently supposed to have
an outpatient bronchoscopy, but this never happened. When she
presented to [**Hospital1 **] with SOB, she had a troponin of .28/.24,
diffuse deep TWI, BNP of 1,000. TTE was done which showed apical
hypokinesis, EF 60%. Cardiology was consulted and per notes,
thought she had stable CAD, not acute coronary syndrome,
recommended statin/aspirin, held off beta blocker secondary to
wheezing. In terms of her SOB, it was felt that she was having
another COPD exacerbation with possible postobstructive
pneumonia. She was initially admitted to the floor and improved
on PO steroids with nebulizers, then her respiratory status
worsened, she became tachcyardic and she was tranferred to the
MICU and started on Vancomycin and Zosyn. According to the
notes, vanco had been dc'ed, however was given earlier today
prior to transfer. It was determined that she needed another CTA
of the chest, however, she declined. After speaking with IP
here, the patient was intuabted on [**6-30**], had a bronch at [**Hospital1 **],
and is being transferred post - procedure to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management and evaluation for possible stenting procedure. At
the time of transfer, the results of the bronch were unknown,
but tissue biopsies were taken.

On arrival to the MICU, patient is intubated and sedtaed,
comfortable on vent.

Social History:
([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital1 **] records):

pack of cigarettes a day for 35-40 years until 4 years ago when
lung cancer was diagnosed. No smoking since then and no exposure
to secondhand cigarette smoke. She does not drink alcohol, does
not use drugs. She does not work right now. She is married,

Physical Exam:
Admission Exam
Vitals: 98.4 95 158/81 18 100%
gen: intubated and sedated, not responding to commands
CV: tachycardic, no appreciable murmurs over vent
Resp: transmitted breath sounds on left, coarse breath sounds on
right
Abd: +BS, soft
Neuro: pupils equal

Pertinent Results:
[**6-30**] Chest Xray
Left lung is airless and mediastinum occupies the left
hemithorax suggesting prior left pneumonectomy.  Right upper
lobe is densely consolidated, and at its periphery is a 5 x 12
cm homogeneous opacity with lobulated margins along the lung
interface which certainly could be a mass involving lung and
pleura.  The right lower lung is free of consolidation but there
are septal lines suggesting mild edema.
ET tube is in standard placement.  Nasogastric tube ends in the
upper stomach. Right jugular line tip projects over the middle
third of the leftward displaced SVC.

[**6-30**] ECG
Sinus rhythm with premature atrial contractions. Right
bundle-branch block. Possible lateral infarction, age
undetermined. No previous tracing available for comparison.




Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 66 year old woman with a history of non small
cell lung cancer s/p left pneumonectomy and COPD who presented
with a new right lung mass and post - obstructive pneumonia. She
was initially admitted to [**Hospital3 **] with symptoms of
shortness of breath. She was transferred for possible stenting.
She had been intubated at [**Hospital3 **]. On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**]
she was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics given concern for a
possible post-obstructive picture. She was seen by the
interventional pulmonary team shortly after arrival to [**Hospital1 18**].
They performed a bronchoscopy, but were unable to perform any
intervention given the location of the tumor compressing her
airway. Multiple discussions were held with the patient's family
and her outside providers were contact[**Name (NI) **]. We discussed her
overall poor prognosis. Ms. [**Known lastname **] family expressed that she
would not want any more invasive procedures or further
treatments. Her care was transitioned to comfort focused
measures. She was extubated on [**7-2**] and passed away on [**7-3**].

Her sons [**Name (NI) **] and [**Name (NI) **] were both contact[**Name (NI) **]. [**Name2 (NI) 6**] autopsy was
declined.
