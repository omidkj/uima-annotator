Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 603**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status (lethargy), bradycardia, hypercalemia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of left sided subclavian central venous line
PLacement of arterial line

History of Present Illness:
This is an 81 year old female with past medical history of
diastolic CHF, anemia, HTN, HL, who presnted today from home
with an unclear period of suffering from lethargy and altered
mental status.  Apparently, the patient's daughter noted she was
very lethargic and thus brought her in to be evlaluated.  It is
unclear when the daughter left but none of her insights are
available and she was not interviewed by either the ED resident
giving sign out or this writer.  The patient apparently
complained of productive cough of an unclear duration but denied
fever or dyspnea.

In the ED initial VS 98.3 52 130/48 18 100%.  She complained of
productive cough but denied fever, chest pain, or dyspnea.  She
denied abdominal pain, nausea, or dysuria.  Exam notable for
encephalopathy without focal findings.  Labs revealed [**Last Name (un) **],
elevated troponin to 0.2, notably benign UA.  CXR w/ ?
retrocardiac opacity and EKG not acutely ischemic.  She was
given ceftriaxone/azithromycin for empiric treatment of CAP.
Trop was 0.2 so she was started on a heparin drip.  PLans were
made to admit to the floor but then the patient was noted to
have sinus brady to the 40s without change in BP and then to the
20's with SBP's dropping into the 60s.  Each of these episodes
resolved with a dose of atropine.  Cards was consulted and said
they would see the patient on the floor, and tox was consulted
and recommended glucagon for treatment of a possible beta
blocker overdose.  Glucagon administered without significant
change in HR.  She was admitted to the ICU.

On arrival to floor pt continued to report productive sputum
without fever and deny other localizing symtpoms.  Speaking very
slowly in short, difficult to understand sentences and not
always replying appropriately.   Soon after arrival she dropped
her rate into mid 20's with decreased pressures with SBP's in
70s.  Initially, HR and SBP improved with atropine but then only
HR with persistent low BPs.  She was started on peripheral
dopamine with little improvement and then had another event
where she became barely responsive with SBP's in 60s but still
breathing and protecting airway.  Anesthesia stat was called but
received one dose of epinephrine prior to intubation and this
increased SBPs into 110's with HR 100 and she became more
responsive so intubation deferred.  Left subclavian CVL placed.

ROS: Unobtainable due to mental status.

PERTINENT IMAGING
#[**2139-6-1**] CHEST (PA & LAT)
FINDINGS: AP upright and lateral views of the chest are
obtained. There is
mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with blunted right CP
angle which
could reflect a small effusion. Evaluation is overall limited
given the low
lung volumes, though there is no focal consolidation of overt
CHF. Bony
structures appear grossly intact. Degenerative spurring in the
mid thoracic
spine noted.

IMPRESSION: Possible small right pleural effusion. No overt
abnormalities
including no definite pneumonia.

#[**2139-6-1**] CT head
FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass
effect or
major vascular territorial infarction. Ventricles and sulci are
slightly
prominent, compatible with central atrophy. Mild periventricular
and
subcortical white matter hypodensities suggest chronic small
vessel ischemic
disease. There is no shift of normally midline structures. There
is no
fracture. Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are
well
aerated.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

#[**2139-6-3**] CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CO
FINDINGS:

CONTRAST-ENHANCED CT OF THE CHEST:

There are small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than
left, along
with bibasilar atelectasis. The heart size is mildly enlarged.
There are
coronary artery calcifications. There is no pericardial
effusion. Central
airways appear patent. There is some calcification noted along
the aortic
arch. There is no mediastinal, hilar, or axillary
lymphadenopathy.

CONTRAST-ENHANCED CT OF THE ABDOMEN:

Scattered hepatic cysts are identified. The gallbladder is
unremarkable.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary duct dilation. The
spleen,
pancreas, and adrenals are normal in appearance. Extensive cysts
and
low-density lesions likely representing cysts are noted in the
bilateral
kidneys. There is no hydronephrosis or hydroureter. There is no
abdominal
ascites. There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal
lymphadenopathy. There is
no abdominal ascites. Extensive calcified plaque is noted
involving the
abdominal aorta along with the origin of the celiac artery, SMA,
and the
bilateral renal arteries. In particular, the SMA origin appears
to be
significantly narrowed.

CONTRAST-ENHANCED CT OF THE PELVIS:

A large amount of retained stool is noted in the rectosigmoid
colon.
Calcified uterine fibroids are present. A Foley catheter is
noted in the
bladder. Trace amount of free fluid is seen the right hemipelvis
(2:94). The
left-sided colon is narrowing, which may be in part to
underdistension. There
is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:

Multilevel degenerative changes are noted. There is no
concerning lytic or
sclerotic lesion.

IMPRESSION:

1. No findings to suggest primary malignancy, as questioned.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions along with bibasilar atelectasis.
3. Numerous renal and hepatic cysts.
4. Extensive atherosclerosis of the abdominal aorta and branch
vessels
including the celiac trunk and the SMA.
5. Large amount of retained stool within the rectosigmoid colon.
