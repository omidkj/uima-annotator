Chief Complaint:
Non-ST elevation Myocardial Infarct

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization
Endotracheal Intubation
Femoral Central Line
Arterial Line

History of Present Illness:
72 yo female with h/o DM, HTN, HLD, longstanding sarcoid on home
O2, newly diagnosed paroxysmal Afib ([**7-4**]) s/p DDD pacemaker
placement secondary to CHB on [**2182-5-25**], who presented to the ED
[**7-15**] with AF and flash. She developed flash pulmonary edema ->
intubated; on neo gtt. Troponin: 0.01, 0.27 CK: 22, BNP 6848.
She also went into atrial fibrillation with RVR at the time
though the time course is not documented. Her cardiac enzymes
were elevated at [**Hospital3 1280**] and EKG was concerning for anterior
ischemia she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for NSTEMI. She stayed in
the MICU in OSH overnight and was transferred here for further
management.

Upon arrival here, the patient went to cardiac cath. She was
found to have a Mid LAD lesion distal to D2. Received a bare
metal stent to the mid-LAD. Patient has an allergy to ASA (SOB),
so is set to receive 75 mg plavix [**Hospital1 **]. In the cath lab she was
in and out of AF.

 Patient was started on heparin and integrillin gtt in cath lab.
Was found to have an INR of 2.6. Her heparin gtt was stopped,
but integrillin continued.

 Upon arrival to the CCU, patient was in Afib with RVR; HR into
the 130s. She was found to be hypotensive and shocked once, she
did not return to sinus rhythm. Given amiodorone 150 mg IV x 1,
and started on a dilt gtt. She continued to have low BP, so
phenylephrine was started at 1 mcg/min.
.
Unable to assess ROS b/c of intubation.

Reports:
Cardiac Cath ([**2182-7-16**]): 1. Selective coronary angiography of
this right dominant system demonstrated two vessel disease.  The
LMCA had no angiographically appaernt disease.  The LAD was a
small caliber vessel with a long, sub-total occlusion extending
fromthe mid-LAD  until D2.  The first diagonal branch was of
moderate size with a 90% ostial stenosis.  The LCx was a
moderate sized vessel with a small OM1, moderate sized OM2 and a
large OM3.  The OM2 had a 90% ostial stenosis and a focal 90%
proximal stenosis.  The RCA is a large dominant vessel with mild
luminal
irregularities proximally and in the mid portion.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left hear
filling
pressures with secondary pulmonary hypertension.  The RVEDP was
17mmHg
and the mean PCWP was 21mmHg.  The cardiac index was at the
lower limit
of normal at 2.17 l/min/m2.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid LAD with a 2.0 x 23
Mini
Vision bare metal stent. Final angiography revealed no residual
stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and TIMI 3
flow. (see
PTCA comments for details)
.
Echo ([**2182-7-17**]): The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are
normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded (LV apex not
clearly seen). There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with focal hypokinesis of
the apical free wall. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad.
.
CXR ([**2182-7-17**]): Central adenopathy is very severe involving both
hila, right greater than left in the paratracheal and
prevascular mediastinum. Hilar adenopathy is inseparable from
the perihilar consolidation or even large perihilar nodules, and
there is extensive peribronchial infiltration in both lower
lungs, particularly the left, obscuring left heart border. How
much of this is chronic and how much is new would depend upon
comparison to prior chest imaging currently unavailable. Without
comparison studies, I cannot say whether there is acute
pneumonia or mild interstitial edema and whether the central
adenopathy, though it contains some calcifications indicative of
chronicity, is entirely stable.
  ET tube is in standard placement. Nasogastric tube passes
below the diaphragm and out of view. Transvenous right atrial
and right ventricular pacer leads are noted. No pneumothorax.
Pleural effusion, if any, is small, on the left.
.
CT Chest ([**2182-7-19**]): 1. Findings compatible with advanced
sarcoidosis. Enlarged pulmonary artery likely reflects an
element of pulmonary hypertension. Tiny left pleural effusion.
No CT evidence of definite active infection.
2. Partially seen solid right upper pole lesion. This may
represent a
hyperdense renal cyst. However, targeted ultrasound of the upper
pole of the right kidney is recommended for further
characterization.
3. Delayed renal excretion.
.
Upper Extremity DVT Study ([**2182-7-21**]): No evidence of left upper
extremity DVT.

Brief Hospital Course:
72 yo female with h/o DM, HLD, HTN, Afib with RVR, s/p pacemaker
and sarcoid who presented with acute heart failure after an
NSTEMI leading to flash pulmonary edema.
.
# NSTEMI: Patient presented with atrial fibrillation with RVR
and hypotension and was immediately sent for cardiac
catheterization.  She was found to have 2 vessel disease and
received a bare metal stent to the mid-LAD artery.  She is on
Plavix 75mg daily, Simvastatin 80mg daily, and
