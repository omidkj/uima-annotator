Brief Hospital Course:
Pt presented electively on [**2-28**] for preop angiogram. Due to
scheduling this was not able to be performed. She was admitted
in anticipation of angiogram the following morning.
On [**3-1**] she underwent a cerebral angiogram without embolization
due to tortuosity of vessels and calcifications. Procedure was
without complication. She was transferred to the PACU for close
neurological monitoring post op. She returned to the floor for
the evening of [**3-1**] and on the morning of [**3-2**] she went to the
operating room for a craniotomy for resection of her meningioma.
Surgery was without complication. She was extubated and
transferred to the ICU. Post operative head CT revealed no
hemorrhage and good resection.

On [**3-3**] she remained neurologically stable and monitored closely
in the ICU. on [**3-4**] she was cleared for transfer to the floor.
Her foley was discontinued and meds were changed to PO. The
patient had a fall and when examined she was noted to have a
small amount of blood over her incision. A stat head CT was
performed and negative for interval change.

On [**3-5**] & [**3-6**] she worked with PT & OT who recommended discharge

repleted as necessary. She was cleared for discharge pending bed
