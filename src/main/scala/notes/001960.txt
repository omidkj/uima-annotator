Pertinent Results:
[**5-20**] Carotid U/S: Right ICA stenosis <40%. Left ICA stenosis <40%

[**2148-5-22**] Echo: Pre-CPB: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in
the left atrial appendage. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Post-CPB: The patient is AV-Paced, on low dose phenylephrine.
There is a well-seated prosthetic aortic valve with no leak and
no AI. The MR is mild. No [**Male First Name (un) **]. The aorta is intact. Dr
[**Last Name (STitle) **] present and aware. Other parameters are as
pre-bypass

[**5-22**] Ct of head: 1. Unremarkable head CT, without evidence of an
acute infarct. 2. Unremarkable CTA of the head, without evidence
of a hemodynamically significant stenosis or aneurysm. 3.
Unremarkable CTA of the vessels of the neck, without evidence of
a hemodynamically significant stenosis or dissection. 4.
Extensive postoperative changes as detailed above, including
pneumomediastinum, small right pneumothorax, subcutaneous
emphysema which extends into the neck, and lines and tubes as
described above.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**5-22**] Ms.[**Known lastname 32859**] was taken to the operating room and underwent
Aortic Valve Replacement (#25mm St.[**Male First Name (un) 923**] Epic Porcine Valve).
Cross Clamp Time=83 minutes. Cardiopulmonary Bypass Time=94
minutes. Please refer to Dr[**Doctor Last Name **] operative report for
further details. She tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred to the CVICU in critical but stable condition
requiring Neo for optimal blood pressure support. She awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated in a timely fashion.
Following extubation, she was unable to move her right side, and
unable to withdraw to pain. Neurology was consulted. Head and
neck CTA scan performed which showed no evidence of any acute
changes. Ms.[**Known lastname 32860**] ability to move her right side improved and
her deficit resolved completely. All drips were weaned to off.
Lines and drains were discontinued in a timely fashion.
Beta-blocker and diuresis initiated. She continued to progress
and on POD# 2 she transferred to the step down unit for further
monitoring. Physical therapy consulted and evaluated her. She
was gently diuresed towards her preoperative weight. The
hematology service was consulted for evaluation for leukocytosis
as there was no evidence of infection. Work-up was unremarkable
and a follow-up appointment was scheduled. The remainder of her
postoperative course was essentially uneventful and on POD# 8
she was cleared for discharge to rehab. All follow up
appointments were advised.
