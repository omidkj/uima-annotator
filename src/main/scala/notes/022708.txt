PRE-BYPASS:
1. A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen
at rest. A secundum type atrial septal defect is present.
2. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
6. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including phenylephrine and is
being A paced.
1. Biventricular function is intact
2. A bioprosthesis is well seated in the Aortic position.
Leaflets move well. Trace central AI is noted. Mean gradient is
< 10 mm of Hg.
3. Aortic contours appear intact post decannulation

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2110-6-10**] Mr. [**Known lastname 496**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] an aortic valve replacement
with a 25mm [**Company **] mosaic ultra porcine valve.   Please see
the operative note for details.  He tolerated this procedure
well and was transferred in critical but stable condition to the
surgical intensive care unit.  He was extubated and weaned from
his pressors.  His psych meds were restarted.  Chest tubes were
removed.  On post-operative day two he was transferred to the
step down floor.  Epicardial wires were removed.  He was placed
on Vancomycin/Zosyn for a presumed pneumonia, but as he remained
afebrile, his leukocytosis resolved, and his chest radiograph
improved these antibiotics were discontinued at discharge.  By
post-operative day seven he was ready for discharge to home with
services.
