Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 68 yo female with afib, systolic CHF with EF 15%, CAD,
DM2 on insulin, s/p L AKA admitted following mechanical fall.

1.MRSE Bacteremia:  On admission, pt was hypotensive in ED and
on floor, found to have GPCs (grew MRSE) in blood on [**6-13**],
[**8-24**], transferred to MICU on [**8-21**], started on Vanco which should
be continued for 14 days after last positive culture which was
[**2119-8-26**] (a fem line tip).  This fem line tip from [**8-26**] also grew
pan-resistant Klebsiella which was thought to be a contaminant.
TTE this admission was negative.  Pt had a left IJ placed after
cultures cleared which was removed at D/C.  Pt briefly required
levophed in MICU. On arrival to the floors, her pressures
continued to improve and she was restarted on home doses of
lisinopril and carvedilol with SBP on day of d/c in 110s. Pt
discharged to continue vanco dosed at HD on Tues, Thurs, Sat to
end [**9-9**].
.
2. Chronic ischemic CM: EF 15% s/p [**Hospital1 **] V pacer also s/p MI and
CABGX2 IN [**2108**] AND [**2118**].  Hypotension resolved at discharge, was
likely from bacteremia. Pt discharged on home regimen of
Lisinopril, Carvedilol, ASA.
.
3. RUE DVT: Discovered [**8-27**] after tunneled HD catheter taken out
[**8-26**].  Pt was on heparin gtt until d/c.  Pt restarted on
coumadin 2 days prior to discharge.  Given Coumadin 5mg Daily at
d/c with INR to be repeated Tues [**9-5**] at dialysis. INR at
discharge 1.9.
.
4. [**Name (NI) 39621**] Pt on heparin gtt here, discharged on coumadin.
.
5. DM2: Pt continued on home dose Glargine 12 units Daily here
with Humalog SS and discharged on same.
.
6. CKD: ESRD, presumed [**3-18**] DM on HD x 1 month prior to admission
T/Th/Sa.  HD continued in house and pt discharged on same home
schedule. Continued Sevelamer.
.
7 Anemia: HCT stable and 31.5 at discharge.
.
8. Hypothyroidism: Pt continued on Levothyroxine.
.
9. Strongyloides: Diagnosed by stool O and P in MICU after
eosinophilia was noticed. Pt given ivermectin x 2 doses (full
course for uncomplicated infxn).
.
