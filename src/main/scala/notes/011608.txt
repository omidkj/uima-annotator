History of Present Illness:
71 year old woman with a recent right AK amputation (recovering
at [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Hospital), who was admitted to [**Hospital3 4107**] on
[**2129-11-14**] with severe shortness of breath of sudden onset that
woke her up at night. She had no chest pain at that time. Her
BNP was found to be [**2120**] and her troponin was elevated at 1.07
which decreased to 0.68 yesterday. Her CK yesterday was 63. No
other cardiac labs were sent. Given her acute respiratory
distress, she was admitted to ICU and diuresed. She was treated
with [**Year (4 digits) **], statin, BB and sq heparin, but no heparin gtt or
plavix. Total UOP not noted in OSH records. Echo at OSH showed
EF of 40%, and ? hypokinesis consistent with CAD, though no echo
report in OSH records. Patient transfered here for possible cath
tomorrow.

On admission here, patient denies SOB, no CP, no abdominal pain,
no change in vision, no N/V/D. Does report orthopnea, at PND as
described above.

Pertinent Results:
CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION [**2129-11-17**]:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system

revealed mild coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had a 20%
stenosis.
The LAD had mild luminal irregularities.  The LCx had 40%
disease at the
OM2.  The RCA had mild disease.

2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right sided filling
pressures
with RVEDP 11 mmHg.  The LVEDP was within normal limits at 9
mmHg.
There was evidence of moderate systolic pulmonary artery
hypertension
with PASP of 46 mmHg.  The PCWP was elevated at 21 mmHg.  There
was
evidence of mild systemic arterial systolic hypertension with
SBP 146
mmHg.  The cardiac index was preserved at 2.3 L/min/m2.  There
was no
transvalvular gradient upon pullback of the catheter from the
left
ventricle to the aorta.

3.  Resting ventriculogram revealed mild global hypokinesis with
an EF
of 45% and 1+ mitral regurgitation.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Mild coronary artery disease.
2. Global hypokinesis.
3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
4. Mild systemic arterial systolic hypertension.
5. Elevated right sided filling pressures.
6. Mild mitral regurgitation.

CARDIAC ECHO:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular systolic function. Probable
diastolic dysfunction. Moderate mitral regurgitation.

CT C/A/P:
A large hiatal hernia persists with a small left pleural
effusion
and associated atelectasis. Non-contrast evaluation of the
liver, spleen,
pancreas, and adrenal glands appears unremarkable. Vicarious
excretion of
contrast is noted within the gallbladder, which otherwise
appears
unremarkable. The kidneys demonstrate residual contrast from
prior
intravenous administration. Atherosclerotic calcification of the
abdominal
aorta and its branches are noted, though the abdominal aorta
remains of normal caliber. Intra-abdominal loops of large and
small bowel are of normal caliber and there is no free air, free
fluid, or pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal
lymph nodes. No retroperitoneal fluid collection or hematoma is
identified. A moderately large fat-containing midline abdominal
hernia is reidentified.

The rectum and sigmoid colon are unremarkable. The patient is
status post hysterectomy and a Foley remains within the bladder.
No pathologically enlarged inguinal lymph nodes or free fluid is
identified. A hematoma in the right groin is not significantly
changed compared to a day prior and no increase in its size is
identified. The previously identified distal left common femoral
artery occlusion is not evaluated on the non-contrast images.

Bone windows reveal no worrisome lytic or sclerotic lesions.
Multilevel
thoracolumbar degenerative change and mild compression deformity
of the T12 vertebral body is reidentified.

IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma or
worsening of right groin hematoma.
2. Small left pleural effusion and lower lobe atelectasis in the

setting of large hiatal hernia again noted.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 71 yo F admitted to an outside hospital ICU with
CHF exacerbation, BNL to [**2120**], diuresed there, found to have
elevated troponin I of 1.07 and EF of 40% with hypokinesis.
EKG with T wave inverisons throughout. She was transfered here
to [**Hospital1 18**] for catheterization which showed essentially clear
coronaries. Echo after cath showed no hypokinesis, EF 50%.
Likely cause of elevated troponins and EKG changes was coronary
vasospasm that caused transient, reversible ischemia resulting
in acute exacerbation of chronic diastolic heart failure.

Following the cath, patient developed a cath site hematoma and
subsequently became hypotensive to the 70's and had a hct drop
from 27 to 21.  She was transfused one unit pRBC and transfered
to the CCU for closer monitoring.  CT showed a right common
femoral artery 5 x 2 cm hematoma, without evidence of active
extravasation or interval expansion following delayed imaging.
On [**11-18**] her Hct dropped down to 21.1 (was originally in the low
30's) and she became hypotenisve to the 80's and she was
transfered to the CCU for closer monitoring.  A repeat CT at
that time showed no evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma or
worsening of right groin hematoma.  Vascular surgery evaluated
her and felt she did not require surgical intervention.  She was
transfused a total of 4 units PRBC with stabilization of her Hct
at 30 for the 24 hours.  Her BP also remained stable following
the transfusions.  Her BP meds were held in the setting of
hypotension and restarted
