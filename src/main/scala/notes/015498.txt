   OVA + PARASITES (Final [**2184-4-8**]):
      NO OVA AND PARASITES SEEN.
      This test does not reliably detect Cryptosporidium,
Cyclospora or
      Microsporidium. While most cases of Giardia are detected
by routine
      O+P, the Giardia antigen test may enhance detection when
organisms
      are rare.

   Cryptosporidium/Giardia (DFA) (Final [**2184-4-8**]):
      NO CRYPTOSPORIDIUM OR GIARDIA SEEN.

[**2184-3-23**] CXR
FINDINGS: The lungs are well expanded and clear. Atheromatous
disease of the
aortic arch is again identified. The cardiac silhouette is
within normal
limits for size. No effusion or pneumothorax is noted. The
visualized
osseous structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process.
.
[**2184-3-23**] CT ABDOMEN: There is mild dependent bibasilar
atelectasis. There is CT
evidence of anemia. Absence of intravenous contrast limits
evaluation of the abdominal parenchymal organs and vasculature.
Diffuse atherosclerotic
calcification of the abdominal aorta and its branches is not
significantly
changed. The liver is unremarkable. Gallbladder is markedly
distended, with
a small punctate calcification along the posterior wall, either
representing a
tiny gallstone or mural calcification. There is no wall
thickening or
pericholecystic inflammatory change.
The pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are unremarkable.
Lobulated contour
of both kidneys is unchanged. Stomach and intra-abdominal loops
of bowel are
unremarkable. There is no free air, free fluid, or abnormal
intra-abdominal
lymphadenopathy.
CT PELVIS: Evaluation of the pelvic structures is limited by
streak artifact
from bilateral hip fixation hardware.
