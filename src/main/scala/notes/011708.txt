RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2158-12-23**] 8:52 AM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: eval for pleural effusions

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
63 year old woman s/p ASD repair
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for pleural effusions
TWO-VIEW CHEST [**2158-12-23**]

COMPARISON: [**2158-12-22**].

INDICATION: Pleural effusion assessment.

Indwelling devices are unchanged in position. Moderate left
pleural effusion has slightly decreased in size and
small-to-moderate partially loculated right pleural effusion is
unchanged. Cardiomegaly and enlargement of central pulmonary
arteries is again demonstrated as well as bibasilar areas of
atelectasis.

IMPRESSION: Slight decrease in left pleural effusion. No
substantial change in right pleural effusion.

Findings
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2158-12-21**].
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Suboptimal technical quality, a
focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
[Intrinsic RV systolic function likely more depressed given the
severity of TR].

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. Eccentric MR jet. Moderate (2+)
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Moderate [2+]
TR. Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor parasternal
views.
Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. [Intrinsic systolic
function may be depressed given the severity of of mitral
regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. [Intrinsic systolic function may be depressed
given the severity of of tricuspid regurgitation.] The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. An eccentric, laterally directed jet of
moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2158-12-21**],
the severity of mitral and tricuspid regurgitaition as well as
the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure are now
reduced.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2158**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2158-12-20**] for further
management of her dyspnea and lower extremity edema. She was
placed on lasix and oxygen.  She was seen in consultation by the
infectious disease service and the plastic surgery service.  An
echocardiogram was performed which revealed moderate mitral
regurgitation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and severe
pulmonary hypertension.  She was placed on Imdur for afterload
reduction and gentle diuresis continued given her m
