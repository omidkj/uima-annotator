Radiology
=============
CT Head [**4-18**]
Extensive chronic microvascular infarct without evidence of
neoplastic or infectious process; however, MRI remains more
sensitive for this indication.
.
CT Torso [**4-18**]
1. Prominent mediastinal and hilar adenopathy is slightly less
bulky along
the right paratracheal region but unchanged in the subcarinal
region.
Adenopathy in the abdomen is improved.
2. Since [**2144-3-31**], there has been interval near-complete
resolution of right
pleural effusion but the patient now has new small to moderate
left pleural
effusion with adjacent compressive atelectasis. However, no
evidence of new
pneumonia.
3. Distended gallbladder with cholelithiasis, but no wall
thickening or
pericholecystic fluid.
4. Small hiatal hernia. Sigmoid diverticulosis.
.
MRI Head [**4-21**]
1. No acute infarction. No focal lesions in the brain parenchyma
to suggest
neoplastic or infectious etiology. Nonspecific white matter
changes in the
cerebral white matter on both sides, likely due to sequelae of
chronic small vessel occlusive disease, with other etiologies
being less likely, due to lack of IV contrast enhancement.
.
CT Head [**4-23**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Periventricular white matter changes, stable from prior,
likely
representing chronic microvascular disease.
.
CT head [**5-2**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process. Meningeal inflammation cannot
be excluded on this non-contrast study.
2. Stable extensive microvascular disease.
.
MR head [**5-13**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Stable patchy confluent nonenhancing T2/FLAIR
hyperintensities within the subcortical white matter, centrum
semiovale, corona radiata, and periventricular regions. This is
nonspecific and likely represents chronic microangiopathic small
vessel ischemic changes.
2. No evidence for acute infarct or hemorrhage.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Fever and Neutopenia: Patient initially covered with broad
spectrum antibiotics including Vancomycin and Cefepime. Culture
data only revealed Eneterococcus in the urine sensitive to
Vancomycin. Counts recovered with Neupogen but patient remained
febrile. CT Torso was unremarkable and blood cultures were
negative. As mental status progressively deteriorated (see
below) antibiotics were changed to Ceftriaxone, Ampicillin,
Vancomycin and Acyclovir for meninigitis coverage.
.
# Altered mental status: Patient's mental status worsened and
eventally became non-responsive. LP was not consistent with
bacterial meningitis, but since WBC was poly predominant
meningitis doses of antibiotics were administered. Viral studies
and CSF culture data were negative. An EEG revaled that patient
was in nonconvulsive status epelepticus. Patient was started on
Keppra and Ativan, and mental status cleared. An MRI head
revealed signs consistent with CNS lymphoma and CSF revealed
atypical cells. Goals of care were changed to comfort measures
only on [**4-23**], and confirmed on [**4-24**], but family decided to
discontinue CMO order on [**4-25**]. After further conversations with
family, the decision was made to make her FULL CODE and to
proceed with further chemotherapy.
.
Events in chronological fashion:
[**4-27**]: Pt received a one-time administration of high dose
methotrexate intravenously on the night of [**4-27**]. She was given
aggressive hydration with bicarb solution to keep her urine
alkalinized (pH>8.0), promoting elimination of methotrexate.
Despite this, serial levels showed that the clearance of
methotrexate was delayed. In the first few days after
methotrexate, pt remained alert and oriented x 3, although her
mentation did wax and wane at times for unclear reasons.
[**4-28**]: Keppra was uptiratred from 750 mg to 1000 mg IV BID
[**4-29**]: New hives on back. Derm consult was obtained. NOT thought
to be due to any medications, more likely dermatographism. Pt
c/o itchiness however only topical sarna lotion was used in
favor of avoiding sedating medications.
[**4-30**]: Pt became febrile to 100.5 early morning of [**4-30**]. Cefepime
was started. In the afternoon of [**4-30**], pt was noted to be more
somnolent and yet more irritable. Pt appeared very
uncomfortable. Pt did not answer questions or follow commands
consistently. She failed to make eye contact. She was noted to
have body tremors, which subsided briefly after 1 mg of Ativan
then returned.
[**5-1**]: Overnight of [**2050-4-29**] pt continued to be somnolent and
tremulous. Multiple doses of ativan were given to little effect.
Acyclovir was started for concern of HSV encephalitis.
Infectious work up was initiated.
[**5-2**]: CT scan did not show any acute changes. Vancomycin was
started. 24hr video EEG monitoring was begun.
[**5-3**]: Pt was noted to be back in status epilepticus. Keppra was
increased to 1 g TID. Pt was loaded with phenytoin 1 g followed
by 100 mg IV Q8 hrs, Dexamethasone 10 mg IV then 4 mg IV BID.
EEG monitoring was continued. All antimicrobials were continued
although microbiology data so far had been negative. A lumbar
puncture was performed for interval check of lymphoma in CNS and
pt was also given IT Ara-C.
[**5-4**]: Pt remained in status despite the multiple anti-epileptics
and pt was transferred to the ICU for phenobarbital
administration.

MICU course:

She was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for elective intubation for
initiation of phenobarbital

# Sedation/ Unresponsiveness:  Her mental status continued to be
nonresponsive for >1 week.  This was likely secondary to
persiste
