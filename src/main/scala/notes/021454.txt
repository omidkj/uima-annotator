Chief Complaint:
Chest pain/ Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Cath
Pericardial fluid drained


History of Present Illness:
77 yo M with hx of asthma, HL, Multiple myeloma presented to
[**Hospital3 **] in [**Location (un) 620**] with cough and fever of one week duration
. The patient describes intermittent pleuritic chest pain and
general malaise and weakness during a 5 day driving trip from
[**State 15946**]. He said he took nsaids without relief. He denied
fevers/chills but endorsed a runny nose.

At [**Location (un) 620**], he had a low-grade fever and was originally treated
empirically for presumed PNA. However on the day of admission he
became tachypneic into the 140s and underwent a CT-A of his
chest to rule out PE which showed a large pericardial effusion.
Patient also had evidence of pericardial tamponade with elevated
neck veins, tachycardia.  His systolic BP was stable between
110- 115. He had a pulsus paradoxus of 30 to 40 mmHg.

He was transfered here and underwent emergent ECHO which showed
large pericardial effusion and hypercontractile ventricle. He
then underwent a RH cath. His effusion was drained, a drain was
placed and he was admitted to the CCU.

On arrival, his vitals were Afebrile, 107, 114/70, 22, 94% 2L

Imaging:

ECHO [**3-17**]
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. Left ventricular
systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 75%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is a moderate to large sized pericardial
effusion. The effusion appears circumferential. No right atrial
or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen. There is
significant, accentuated respiratory variation in tricuspid
valve inflows, consistent with impaired ventricular filling.

IMPRESSION: Moderate to large circumferential pericardial
effusion with early tamponade physiology.

ECHO [**3-18**]
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. There is a
small pericardial effusion, possibly loculated, subtending the
right ventricular free wall and also the basal lateral wall of
the left ventricle. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade. No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic
collapse is seen.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2192-3-17**] the
pericardial effusion is mostly gone.

ECHO [**3-20**]
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
is a small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic
signs of tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2192-3-19**],
the pericardail effusion now appears slightly larger.

CXR [**3-18**]
Comparison is made to prior study from the day before. There is
patchy
airspace opacification at the bilateral lower lobes, small
bilateral pleural
effusions. Heart and mediastinum within normal limits. No
pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
77 yo M with asthma, MM, HL presents with one week of
fatigue/malaise and chest pain with pericardial effusion. The
most likely etiology is viral pneumonia with associated
pericardial effusion.

ACTIVE ISSUES
.
# PERICARDIAL EFFUSION [**1-4**] respiratory viral process: He
presented with a large effusion by TTE, explaining his chest
pain.  Percardiocentesis was done and the >500cc was drained.
The drain was left in place until there was no further drainage.
 To rule out other causes, further testing was done: TSH normal
(2.2), HIV negative, [**Doctor First Name **] negative.  Pericardial fluid studies
were unrevealing. He continued to spike fevers and infectious
work-up did not reveal any additional causes.  We felt this was
likely due to his pericarditis.  Repeat TTEs were done s/p
drainage and when the drain was pulled, showing resolution of
the effusion.  Since he continued to have mild chest discomfort,
he was started on colchicine on discharge until follow-up with
his outpatient cardiologist, after consultation with his
outpatient oncologist.  An echocardiogram will be
