Admission Echo:
Biventricular hypertrophy with echogenic myocardium, restrictive

filling pattern, thickened valvular structures, and a large
circumferential pericardial effusion without overt echo signs of
tamponade (which may be masked in the setting of severe
pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy).
Findings consistent with amyloid cardiomyopathy.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2197-1-23**],
the pericardial effusion is slightly larger. The estimated
pulmonary artery pressures are higher.

Post Pericardial Effusion Drainage:
There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is unusually small. LV systolic function
appears depressed. Right ventricular systolic function appears
depressed. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion. The effusion appears
circumferential. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade. No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic
collapse is seen.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2197-8-1**], a small circumferential pericardial effusion
has reaccumulated; no evidence of cardiac tamponade.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 89 yo M history of CHF, afib, CAD, HTN, CRI, PAH,
CMY (EF 25%), transferred from OSH with large ascites and
significant left sided pleural effusion for therapeutic
intervention.
.
#. CAD - h/o cardiac cath with occluded RCA, unable to
recanulize
- on ASA, BB and statin, no ACEI [**1-13**] hypotension
.
#. Pump - h/o CHF predominantly right-sided failure secondary to
probable cardiac amyloidosis - not biopsy-proven.  EF 40%,
Severe biventricular diastolic dysfunction with low cardiac
output.  Major volume overload, pleural effusion and ascites on
admission with pericardical effusion that responded well to
pericardiocentesis.  Echo revealed a large pericardial effusion
that was also noted in [**1-18**], although appeared larger. Though no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade were seen, it was thought
that tamponade could be masked in setting of RV hypertrophy and
pulmonary htn.  The pt was taken to cath lab and was found to
have hemodynamics midly suggestive of tamponade with cvp 22, PA
67/29, wedge 28, pericardium 14, with mild improvement in CI
from 1.42 to 1.48 after resolving tamponade. Follow-up ECHO
after pericardiocentesis did not reveal reaccumulation.  Patinet
initially on Lasix gtt for peripheral volume overload after the
pericardiocentesis with good diuresis and transitioned to PO
lasix with continued improvemnet.  Patient was also continued on
BB and Aldactone.  ACE was held in setting of hypotension.
Patient remained normotensive while in house and was discharged
in stable condition.  Patient was discharged on Lasix 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]
and was getting Lasix 80 mg [**Hospital1 **] in house.  If patient appears to
be getting volume overloaded patient can be transitioned back to
Lasix 8- mg [**Hospital1 **]. Patient was close to his dry weight upon
discharge.

.
#. Rhythm - irreg, irreg, chronic afib
- on BB, ASA
- no coumadin [**1-13**] allergy/sensitivity
.
Pleural effusion:
Thoracentesis was done which revealed a transudate with WBC 615,
RBC 1475 though gram stain showed no PMNs, no microorganisms.
The patient was sent to CCU for pericardial drain management
.
Ascites: Patinet with ascites in absence of liver disease,
likely due to poor cardiac output.  This was not intervened on
as it was not bothersome to the patient and it actually
responded slightly to aggressive diuresis.
.
#.Renal Failure - likely acute on chronic.  This improved with
improved cardiac output after pericardiocentesis and diuresis.
Patient's nadir with respect to Cr was 1.5 and was discharged at
1.6 suggesting good diuresis.  Patient was close to his dry
weight upon discharge.
.
.
After discussion with the patient and the medical staff, all
were in agreement that Mr. [**Known lastname 15905**] was a suitable candidate for
discharge.
