FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for abdominal aortic aneurysm.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient as reviewed in previous OMR
notes has 24 hour nursing care.  She has a remote history of
tobacco use.  She does not drink alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs - The patient had a heart
rate of 80, blood pressure 155/70, respiratory rate 22,
oxygen saturation 99% on two liters.  Generally, the patient
is tired appearing, depressed in no acute distress. She was
alert and oriented times three.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat is normocephalic and atraumatic.  Dry mucous
membranes.  The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to
light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.
Neck - jugular venous distention was seven centimeters.  The
thyroid was not palpable.  There was no carotid bruit.  Heart
regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no extra sounds.
Lungs - She had decreased breath sounds over the lower lung
fields bilaterally.  She had dullness to percussion.  Abdomen
- The patient had normal bowel sounds, soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Liver edge and spleen were not palpated.
Extremities - She had trace bilateral lower extremity edema.
She had multiple hematomas.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count was 8.7, hematocrit
30.0, platelet count 279,000.  Sodium 134, potassium 3.6,
chloride 98, bicarbonate 21, blood urea nitrogen 27,
creatinine 1.7, glucose 94.

Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm, no acute
changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
Psychiatry - The patient was evaluated by the psychiatry
service and shown in OMR that her Clonazepam was
discontinued.  There were no further psychiatric issues.  The
other medications were not changed.

Cardiopulmonary - The patient had a chest x-ray showing a
small right sided pleural effusion and a left sided pleural
effusion.  She was continued on her antibiotics as described
above.  Specifically, she continued her Levofloxacin and
Metronidazole.

The patient's shortness of breath was initially attributed to
possible pulmonary embolism.  The patient underwent computed
tomographic angiography after echocardiogram showed pulmonary
hypertension.  After having this procedure, however, the
patient was found to not have pulmonary emboli, however, a
thoracic type B aortic dissection was noted distal to the
left subclavian artery extending four to five centimeters.

The patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for
blood pressure management and evaluation by Cardiothoracic
Surgery.  The patient was deemed a poor surgical candidate
and in consultation with her family, the patient opted
against having any intervention other than medical
management.  While in the Coronary Care Unit, the patient
underwent thoracentesis which showed a mixed
transudative/exudative picture consistent with both
congestive heart failure and parapneumonic effusion.  Her
breathing was much improved following the thoracentesis.

Renal - The patient initially presented with her baseline
creatinine of 1.5, however, she did have metabolic acidosis.
She received intravenous bicarbonate with moderate
correction.  However, following the angiography, her
creatinine increased to slightly over 2.0.  This worsening
function peaked at a creatinine of 2.1.

As stated above, the patient's shortness of breath resolved.
She was transferred to the medical floor following removal of
her central line.  After titration of beta blockade in the
Coronary Care Unit, the patient was maintained on Labetalol
100 mg twice a day for a target blood pressure initially of
120 systolic, however, because of the patient's slightly
decreased renal function, the upper limit of the target was
set at 130 mmHg.  The patient remained free of chest pain
while on the medical floor.  As reviewed with her family
previously, the patient wished to have a DNR/DNI order
implemented as she will not be a surgical candidate and does
not want to be intubated or undergo any aggressive measures.

The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service who
deemed it safe for her to go home provided that her home
physical therapy be continued. The patient will also receive
continuing visiting nurse care.

4.  Labetalol 100 mg p.o. twice a day.

minutes as needed for pain times three.
