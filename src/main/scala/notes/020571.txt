Service:  Medicine

ADDENDUM:  The patient should be on Plavix 75 mg p.o.q.d. due
to her carotid disease.  Additionally, she will have
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of vascular surgery as an
outpatient to evaluate her possible carotid disease on the
right side.  She is status post left carotid endarterectomy
two years ago with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and, given the syncopal
episode, it may be worthwhile to pursue further workup with
regard to this lesion.  The patient is aware that an MRA
often over-estimates the degree of stenosis within a given
patient's vessel, however, formal evaluation, including
carotid duplex, ultrasound, as well as possible angiogram can
be pursued as an outpatient with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
