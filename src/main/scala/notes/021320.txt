[**11-26**]- ECHO - The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color  Doppler. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left  ventricular cavity size
is top normal/borderline dilated. There is mild to  moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior
akinesis  and hypokinesis of the infero-septum and
infero-lateral walls. No masses or  thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size is  normal. There is
mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. There is
abnormal septal motion/position. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly  thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild
to moderate ([**12-21**]+) aortic  regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. A  mitral valve
annuloplasty ring is present. The transmitral gradient is normal
for this ring. Mild to moderate ([**12-21**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to  acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly  UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial  effusion.

CT NECK W/CONTRAST (EG:PAROTIDS)  [**2134-12-1**] 4:20 PM
FINDINGS:
Patient is intubated with the endotracheal tube through the
oropharynx. The bulb of the endotracheal tube is inflated. Due
to the presence of the endotracheal tube and inflated bulb, it
is impossible to evaluate for subglottic stenosis or or larynx.
There is a band-like structure noted along the posterior aspect
of the distal trachea beyond the tip of the endotracheal tube
(series 401B, image 30), which could be due to a web. In
addition, there are secretions, partly aerosolized within the
oropharynx and the trachea. The end of the endotracheal tube is
approximately 4.6 cm above the tip of the carina.
Evidence of bilateral lung disease, incompletely evaluated on
the present CT scan.
Evidence of degenerative changes involving the cervical and
thoracic vertebral bodies in the form of osteophytes and facet
joint degeneration.
Status post CABG.Degenerative changes are also noted in
bilateral sternoclavicular joints and distal ends of the
clavicles.
IMPRESSION:
1. As the patient is intubated with inflated bulb of the ETT, it
is impossible to assess for subglottic or laryngeal stenosis.
Recommend direct visualization for assessment.
2. Bilateral lung disease, incompletely evaluated and
characterized on the present study. To consider CT of the chest
for better evaluation.
3. Degenerative changes noted involving the cervical and
thoracic spine, bilateral sternoclavicular joints.

(The case was discussed with the chest radiology team by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], regarding the possibility of better assessment on CT chest
per tracheal stenosis protocol. However, the chest radiology
team prefers direct visualization of the larynx to 3D CT,
considering the fact that the patient is intubated with inflated
bulb of the ETT).

Brief Hospital Course:
80 with history of recent CABG, MV repair admitted to outside
hospital for hypotension after being found down, concerning for
sepsis. Patient was transferred to us for tracheal stenosis
management.
.
# Respiratory failure/tracheal stenosis
Patient was intubated on arrival. However, he extubated himself
while in the ICU. He developed acute hypoxic respiratory failure
and was promptly re-intubated. He was evaluated by
interventional pulmonary and had tracheal stent placed on
[**2134-11-29**]. The stent however migrated on [**2134-11-30**] and was then
removed. He was then evaluated by ENT who recommended
tracheostomy, which he received on [**2134-12-3**]. Direcet
laryngoscopy reveals soft anterior stenosis area 2cm below vocal
cords, taking up to approximately 70% of lumen. #6 Portex trach
was placed/ He is scheduled to have follow up with ENT in [**1-23**]
weekd for future CO2 ablation. At that time, interventional
pulmonary would assist with placement of [**Location (un) **] T tube.
.
# Sepsis
Patient had been normotensive since transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. No clear
source of infection per workup at outside hospital. All
antibiotic was discontinued. He remained afebrile, normal WBC
and normal blood pressure. All culture data remained negative as
well.
.
# Post trach fever - Post trach patient had a low grade fever of
100.1, o2 sat was 93-95% on 30% fiO2.  CXR with mild pulm edema.
Sputum culture and urine cultures were sent.  He was given 1
dose of 10mg IV lasix and started on Zosyn again for presumed
VAP (he received one dose prior to transfer).  Please call Micro
at [**Hospital1 18**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4645**] to follw up the culture data.
.
# Cardiac
Patient had episodes of chest pain while in the ICU. EKG did not
show any changes from baseline. Cardiac enzymes were cycled and
remained negative. Echocardiogramwas performed, revealing EF
35-40%. Cardiology consult was obtained prior to general
anesthesia for rigid bronchoscopy and he was cleared for the
procedure. He was continued on aspirin and metoprolol.
- Strict I/Os.
.
# A. fib
Patient was rate controlled on metoprolol. H
