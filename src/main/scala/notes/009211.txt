Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
respiratory distress, abdominal distention, facial swelling

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
thrombolysis

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 42 year old woman with AIDS (By CD4 criteria, CD4 of 42),
and a high-grade AIDS-related lymphoma (plasmablastic lymphoma
with the initial site of disease in the left maxillary sinus).
She was recently hospitalized here for progressive odynophagia
and possible "pill esophagitis" and/or acid reflux. by EGD
(biopsy results pending), and comes back to the ED with dyspnea,
pain in the extremities (legs > arms), swelling of the right
jaw, and abdominal distension.  Per PCP note patient describes
symptoms prior to arriving to Ed and after recent discharge as:
"she started to notice swelling of the right lower jaw that,
after being recumbent for a while (such as over night) extends
up the right side of her face to close the right eye. The
swelling tends to go down if she is upright for a while, but she
still has painful swelling over the right side of the mandible.
About 48 hours ago, she started to have swelling of the abdomen,
with a feeling of being "bloated" and this is making it
difficult to eat much. She has had increasing dyspnea over the
past 24
hours, and she is not sure if this is because of the abdominal
distension making it difficult to expand her lungs. However,
with
short walks, even across a room, she feels very dyspneic and
"weak" and has to sit down to rest." She also reports having
increasing pain in the extremities, more the legs (thighs and
knees) and the upper extremities. This discomfort is "achy" and
does not seem to worsen or get better with movement or rest.
.
When patient arrived to the ED was found to have temp of 101.2,
have a distended abdomen that was diffusely tender.  She also
was hypotensive with SBP 80-90s and tachycardic with HR 120s.
She then went into SVT that terminated with vagal maneuvers.
She got a dose of dilaudid and her SBP dropped to 70s however
patient mentating normally.  She was given vanc/levo/flagyl in
the ED for concern of infection although no clear source
identified.  Patient then underwent CT torso which revealed
multiple pulmonary emboli including left main artery, right
atrium extending into SVC, cannot exclude extension into IVC,
focal clot within pulmonary veins as well;  abdominal and pelvic
ascites, moderate large right pleural effusion.  She was then
started on heparin gtt in the ED.  Radiology felt that patient
may benefit from cardiac MRI to differentiate between mass vs
clot.  Cardiac surgery evaluated patient who recommended patient
get echo to assess for RV collapse, which will be done in am.
Vascular also consulted in ED and recommend LENI to rule out DVT
and possible IVC filter placement.  Patient hypoxic with O2Sat
90% on RA, put on NRB with O2Sat 97%.  ABG on NRB was
7.48/29/81; in the ED also tachycardic to 120-140s, appears to
be sinus tachy.  Patient also getting boluses of IVF in the ED.

Past Medical History:
1. AIDS (CD4 63 and VL 7,290 in [**1-15**])- multiple antiretroviral
meds. Adherance has never been an issue. Hx of highly resistant
viral strains. Thought to have gotten HIV from blood transfusion
in the [**2131**]'s.
2. high-grade AIDS-related lymphoma diagnosed in
[**4-14**](plasmablastic lymphoma with the initial site of disease in
the left maxillary sinus s/p chemotherapy in [**8-14**] infusional
with a regimen of [**Hospital1 **], complicated by a severe pneumonia in
the left lung requiring intubation, and then a left-sided
empyema requiring several weeks of a chest tube. She had a
recurrence of the lymphoma in the sinus, and has had radiation
therapy to the tumor. She has areas in several bones that are
hypermetabolic on PET scan
3. Thrombocytopenia- responded [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] (antiD-globulin)
4. Lung nodules - 1.5 cm cavitary nodule in the left upper
lung in 9/[**2156**]. She had a CT scan of the chest in [**3-/2157**] that
revealed a 13-mm cavitary lesion in the left upper lobe that had
remained stable, and stable nodule in the other lung fields: 3-4
mm noncalcified nodules in the right upper lobe, lingula and
right middle lobe remain stable.

Social History:
SHx: Notable for having been born in [**Country 2560**]
and she came to the US at the age of 17. She had the surgery of
her mandible the following year and received blood transfusion.
She lives in [**State 3914**] on a farm with her husband and 2 sons (8
and 6 years old), and they own a restaurant.

Family History:
FMHx: Notable for her mother who is in
her 70's and has hypertension. Her father died 2 years ago, at
the age of 69 of lymphoma. She has 3 sisters, one of whom had
problems with ethanol abuse. No other disorders that she is
aware
of run in her family.

IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple filling defects that could be consistent with either
primary cardiac tumor versus tumor thrombus versus de [**Last Name (un) 11083**] bland
embolus located within the left pulmonary artery, the right
atrium extending into the superior vena cava, possibly within
the inferior vena cava, and within the left atrium. The
differential includes a possible primary cardiac tumor centered
in the left atrium and further assessment could be performed by
cardiac MRI. No pulmonary emboli is present within the right
lung.
.
2. Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion. Smaller left
pleural effusion.
3. Incompletely imaged left groin hematoma versus enhancing mass
measuring 5.4 x 2.5 cm. Recommend CT of the left lower extremity
for further assessment.
4. Left upper lobe lesion as described above.
5. Abdominal and pelvic ascites.
6. Thickening of the bladder wall which could be consistent with
cystitis. Clinical correlation is recommended.

Lenis: IMPRESSION: Non-occlusive thrombus within the proximal
right superficial femoral vein that does not extend either
superiorly or inferiorly.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. A large (at least 2 cm x 2
cm) mass is seen in the right atrium, prolapsing into the right
ventricle during diastole. Its attachment is not well-defined,
but it appears to originate in the inferior vena cava, or near
its insertion into the right atrium. The mass is partially
obstructing the RV inflow, creating severe functional tricuspid
stenosis.  There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function is normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary arte
