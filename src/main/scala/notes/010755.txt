Allergies:
Nystatin / Tetracycline

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7455**]
Chief Complaint:
Coffee ground emesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
L Femoral Line placement and then removal.

History of Present Illness:
This [**Age over 90 **] year old lady was found at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab to have an
episode of vomiting of undigested food followed by 5 episodes
coffee ground emesis in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR on
Warfarin for PE and plavix for CAD. She was given Compazine PR,
and Coumadin has been held since [**1-3**]. At that time per ED Call
in, she denied chest pain, dyspnea or abdominal pain. She has
resided at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab MACU [**2124-12-6**]-since [**2124-12-30**], Floor
[**2124-12-31**]-Present after a Rt ankle fracture from [**Hospital3 **]
hospital. She was recently on Cipro for a UTI.

In the ED, initial VS: 98.5 138 101/71 20 93. The patient was
found to be in rapid Afib (rate 130s) with a non-tender abdomen
and guaiac negative; unsuccessful NG lavage. She was given NS
and 1 unit FFP and Vitamin K 10mg IV x1 for elevated INR.
Femoral line and peripheral placed, T&S obtained, started on
Protonix Bolus/Gtt. Given an elevated WBC count, cough, CXR
appearance and infected appearing U/A, the patient was started
on Vanc/Zosyn and admitted to the ICU.

With the assistance of a translator, the patient reports that
she is currently comfortable but for dry mouth. She has a cough
but is unsure of its duration and is unsure if she has had
fevers. She recalls that she was nauseated and vomiting last
night and was nauseous earlier today but is without nausea or
abdominal pain at this time. She denies any bleeding and bloody
stools. She denies chest pain and reports that her breathing is
"bad as usual." Interview limited as she is hard of hearing and
also intermittently awake. Of note, the patient declines any
blood until her daughter arrives.

Her daughter confirms that the patient did not receive a stent
at [**Hospital3 **], her diagnosis of PE was uncertain. Critical
care consent reviewed and signed.

ROS: Denies chest pain, abdominal pain, active nausea, diarrhea,
constipation, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia.

Imaging:
CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW: The heart is mildly enlarged. A calcified
right
fibrothorax, with calcified pleural densities and volume loss in
the right
upper lobe, are similar in appearance. Bilateral pleural
effusions with
bibasilar opacities are new. A large hiatal hernia appears
larger.
IMPRESSION:
1. Mild cardiomegaly.
2. Calcified right fibrothorax, with new small bilateral pleural
effusions
with associated atelectasis of the adjacent lower lobes.
3. Large hiatal hernia.
.
[**1-4**] Echo:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mildly dilated right ventricle with preserved global
and regional biventircular systolic function. Mild aortic and
mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate
pulmonary hypertension.
.
[**1-4**] ECG:
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Diffuse
ST-T wave changes that are non-specific. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2109-10-15**] atrial fibrillation is new.
.
[**1-4**] abdominal x-ray:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of bowel obstruction or perforation.
.
[**1-8**] CXR:
As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal
improvement with reduction of the bilateral pleural effusions
and minimal
improvement in ventilation of the right lung. Otherwise, the
radiograph is
unchanged, unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.
.
[**1-5**] ankle x-ray:
There is again seen a bimalleolar fracture with a transversely
oriented
fracture line to the medial malleolus and obliquely oriented
fracture line to the distal fibula. The ankle mortise is grossly
preserved. There is some bridging callus however the fracture
lines are still visualized. There is generalized soft tissue
swelling about the ankle. No additional fractures are seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
A [**Age over 90 **] year old admitted to the MICU from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with coffee
ground emesis in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR.

#. Hematemesis: The patient was admitted after 4-5 episodes of
coffee grounds emesis without hemodynamic instability, on
Aspirin, Plavix and Warfarin for a recent NSTEMI and ? PE during
a [**Month (only) 404**] admission to [**Hospital3 **].  Her INR was elevating
to [**2-19**], likely due to a Ciprofloxacin interaction without a
concomittant dosage change.
GI Consulted, no EGD necessary.  1 unit pRBCs transfused
although the patient only experienced a drop in hematocrit
consistent with fluid hydration.  ASA restarted, Plavix and
Warfarin held at time of transfer out of the ICU.  PPI converted
from drip to bolus and the patient was able to advance her diet
without issue. Based on risk/benefit ratio (CHADS = 1), are
holding plavix and coumadin, but continuing aspirin on
discharge. Patient without stent or hardware, so also has
presumed history of pulmonary embolism, no clear indication for
plavix even in setting s/p NSTEMI. As such, given concern for
bleed greater than benefit of antiplatelet, we have discontinued
plavix. Opted to continue aspirin however. Hematocrit stable,
after initial drop, through rest of ICU stay as well as on the
floor.

#. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Rate: The patient
was admitted with a sustained rate of 120s-130s in atrial
fibrillation and a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
She spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm with fluid and blood
rescuscitation with a period of transient hypotension that
resolved.  Her beta blocker was held while admitted to the MICU.

Several days into her course patient sponta
