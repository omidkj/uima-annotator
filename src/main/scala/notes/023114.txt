sepsis

TEE


History of Present Illness:
51 year old man who suffered a 30 foot fall in [**8-26**] when
cutting branches from a tree during which he sustained a left
tibial plateau fracture and L2 fracture. He has had multiple
surgeries for the L tib plateau fracture, including placement of
an ORIF [**2196-9-6**] that was eventually removed [**2196-2-8**] with
concern for ongoing infection. Cultures were negative at the
time of hardware removal. On [**2197-2-14**] new hardware was placed
with bone graft from the left iliac crest.
Fluid was aspirated from the bone graft site on [**2197-2-23**]; culture
of the
fluid grew coagulase negative Staphylococcal aureus. A
persistent fluid collection was noted on CT scan [**3-1**]. Mr.
[**Known lastname 19688**] was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] [**2197-3-3**] on vancomycin to treat
the fluid collection and the new hardware placed in a sited
suspected to be recently infected. He was seen in [**Hospital **] clinic on
[**4-3**] by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] where he reported persistent fevers
despite being treated with moxifloxacin for a sinus infection.
Blood cultures were drawn which grew 1/2 bottles coag +cocci. He
was then asked to go to the ED. Upon presentation to the ED his
BP was 144/100. While in the ED his BP fell to 81/52 and his
lactate rose to 3.5. A sepsis line was placed and he was given
3L NS. His lactate rose to 4.5 despite this.
.
ROS
Upon arrival to the ICU he reports a productive cough with
rhinorrhea for the past two weeks which did not improve with
moxifloxacin. He also reports sinus tenderness, HA and ear pain,
fevers, rigors. No visual changes. He notes the development of R
great toe swelling and redness also over the course of two
weeks. Denies trauma. + His knee pain is unchanged and bearable
with his current narcotic regimen consisting of percocet and
oxycodone. He reports worsening back pain solely when he has
rigors. He has reported increasing difficulty controlling his
urination with occasional accidents. Does not report worsening
l/e weakness. In the ED he was evaluated by ortho and their
verdict is pending at this time. His PICCL was pulled. He was
given vancomycin, flagyl and levofloxacin. His ESR and CRP were
61 up from 26 on [**2197-2-23**] and 48.5 (31.5 [**2-25**]) respectively on
[**4-3**]. + non-bloody, non-bilious emesis and diarrhea x 1 today.
+ back pain with rigors. No abdominal pain.


Recent hospitalization/evaluation for diverticulitis last month
-resolved with po abx. +dysuria.

CT ABD:
1. Interval worsening of severe L2 compression fracture.
2. Findings most consistent with post-surgical changes of left
iliac bone with near complete interval resolution of adjacent
collection. Cannot entirely exclude the possibility of
osteomyelitis, given clinical setting. 3. Pericholecystic fluid,
a nonspecific finding, without other signs of cholecystitis
.
MRI LEFT HIP:
Geographic region of marrow edema in the left iliac crest with
associated minimal enhancement. This findings is attributable to
the patient's bone graft harvest site, however, osteomyelitis
can not be excluded in the postoperative setting by MRI.
Overlying soft tissue edema and minimal fluid is present
extending to the subcutaneous soft tissues. This is markedly
decreased from the prior examination. No drainable focal fluid
collection is noted.
.
.
TTE:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function
is normal (LVEF 60%). There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic
regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic
valve. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
mitral valve
prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild to moderate
([**11-22**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic
pressure is normal. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic
valve. There is
no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
1) SEPSIS:
Pt admitted to ICU with septic shock.  He was started on broad
spectrum antibiotics.  His PICC line was pulled due to concern
for line infection and bacteremia.  Blood cultures grew out
serratia and enterococcus.  Pt also found to have cdiff colitis.
 Initially, on vanco, ceftriaxone, and flagyl.  Improved with
that, cultures cleared.
.
2) BACTEREMIA:
As above.  Exact source unclear although line infection was
likely.  He cleared with above antibiotics.  Enterococcus came
back as VRE so vanco stopped and linezolid started.  Pt had MRI
of left hip to evaluate for osteomyelitis and this was negative.
 A TEE was done to r/o endocarditis which was also negative.
Ceftriaxone was changed to cipro for coverage of serratia and he
will complete a 2 week course of that.  He will complete a 4
week course of linezolid and stay on flagyl until 2 weeks after
completing other antibiotics.  Pt will need weekly CBC while on
linezolid and will be followed by ID.
.
3) DEPRESSION:
Pt on celexa 40mg daily as outpt.  This was continued but when
linezolid was started this was begun to be tapered down with
plan to stop temporarily while on linezolid due to risk of
interaction.

Medications on Admission:
Vancomycin dose 1250 mg frequency q 12 hr duration since
