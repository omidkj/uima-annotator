Pacemaker placement


History of Present Illness:
   80yo F with PVD (s/p R EIA stent), HTN, DMII, Lung CA, who
c/o 2-3 days +n/v and general malaise.  She initially went to
OSH and was found to be in high-grade AVB. Of note, the pt was
recently started on a new CCB (x 2 weeks; cardizem from
nifedipine). At OSH, pt rec'd calcium gluconate (unclear dose).
In [**Name (NI) **], pt was given isoproteronal gtt at 1mcg/min then 2mcg/min.
Initial response was an increased sinus rate to 120 with
consistent 2:1 block. As dose was increased, pt developed atrial
flutter with variable block (rates around 40bpm). Throughout her
ED stay, the patient maintained SBP in 180s, mental status was
waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] but pt was able to follow commands and answer
appropriately to most questions with occasional confusion.

Past Medical History:
--DMII
--HTN (poorly controlled, OSH records indicate SBP 190s)
--PVD, s/p right external iliac artery stent, endarterectomy of
the EIA, CFA, PFA with bovine patch angioplasty and iliac and
femoral angiography([**3-22**])
--Lung ca s/p R lower lobe resection (no chemo; [**11-14**])
--COPD
--dCHF (recent admission [**Date range (1) 35545**])
--L pleural effusion (noted on [**6-19**] hosp)
--h/o AFib/flutter (found post-op from R EIA stent)

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital [**Last Name (un) **]: 80yo F with hx of PVD, DM, HTN, Lung CA s/p
resection and COPD presents to OSH with symptomatic AVB (mental
status changes and ARF) now s/p PPM placement.
.
# Rhythm/AV Block: The etiology of the AV Block is unclear at
this moment, however it is most likely related to the recent
addition of CCB. The location of block is also not perfectly
elucidated but it appears to be at level of AV node as
isoproterenol resulted in increased rate.  Vagal manuevers were
attempted but could not be succesfully peformed given her change
in mental status and inability to cooperate.  As she had new ARF
and MS changes, the pt was deemed to have some end organ effects
of bradycardia with a poor perfusion state.  Therefore a
temporary pacer wire was placed under fluoro in the L femoral
position for VVI pacing at 60bpm. Initially the setting was as
follows: paced at low of 0.5mA with sensitivity 3.0mV. However,
she was not captuing all of the time.  She was admitted to and
monitored in the CCU where she was found to still require
pacing, even after the CCB wore off.  She was therefore taken to
the EP lab where a permanent pacemaker was placed on [**7-19**]. She
received vancomycin prophylactically around the device placment.
 She was also given an additional day of clindamycin as well.
Post pace make placement, the temporary pacing wires were
removed.  A CXR confirmed proper placement of the pacemaker and
its leads and the pacemaker was interrogated demonstrating
appropriate capture.  The patient should f/u in the device
clinic on [**2128-7-28**].
   Of note, the pt had been on coumadin 3mg QHS after developing
atrial fibrillation post-op in [**3-22**] and on admission this was
reversed given supratherapeutic INR. She was restarted on
coumadin at 5mg QHS the day after the pacemaker was placed. INR
should be followed closely and coumadin levels should be
adjusted to achieve a goal INR of [**3-19**].
.
# PUMP: The pt has elements of diastolic CHF by recent TTE,
likely from long-standing poorly controlled HTN. BP control was
initially achieved with nitro gtt and then this was weaned off
as outpt meds were restarted, including lisinopril (at same
dose), diltiazem (at higher dose), and lasix (at lower dose).
She was also started on a low dose beta blocker for additional
blood pressure control.  Her final regimen at time of dischage
included diltiazem CR 360mg once daily, Lisinopril 40mg once
daily, Metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] and lasix 40mg once daily.  Given
her history of COPD, the effect of the low dose beta blocker
should be monitored closely.
.
# ARF: The pt has a baseline Cr of 1.0-1.5, which was elevated
up to 2.3 on admission.  This was attibuted to poor perfusion
state from her bradycardia. Urine lytes on admission consistent
with pre-renal azotemia. (FeUrea 31% (FeNa less useful in
patient on lasix)).  Her ACEI and diuretic were initially held
on admission due to the ARF and creatinine and urine output
followed closely.  After placement of the PPM, her Cr has been
trending down.  Her ACEI was titrated back up to her outpt dose
and her lasix was similarly titrated back on.  However at time
of discharge her lasix dose was still lower than previous (40mg
as opposed to 80mg once daily on admission).  Her renal function
and urine output shouuld be followed closely in rehab with
routine chemistries.  Should she develop some amount of fluid
retention, her lasix dose can be returned to her former outpt
dose of 80mg once daily assuming her renal function is able to
tolerate it.
.
# Anemia: HCT was 27.9 on admission which then dropped to 24
after pacer placement (moderate procedural blood loss).  Her
previous medical records indicate a baseline in mid-low 30's (on
admission in [**3-22**]).  She was subsequently transfused 2 U PRBCs
from [**Date range (1) 26325**] (lasix 40 mg iv between units) with some response.
Her pacemaker site appeared to be without significant hematoma
and she remained guaiac negative.
.
# + UA: on [**7-19**] wih WBC, RBC, small leuk. As the pt had a foley
catheter in place at the time of the finding, she was started on
Bactrim DS one tab [**Hospital1 **] for a total of 10day course for
complicated UTI on [**7-19**]. Culture grew pan-sensitive e.coli. She
should complete ten day
