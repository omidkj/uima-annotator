Brief Hospital Course:
56 yo F with history of nephrolithiasis and recurrent resistent
E. coli UTIs presents with urosepsis after recent UTI and
scheduled ureteroscopy/laser lithotripsy.

Pt was transferred to ICU from PACU for tachycardia, high fever
to 102.5, and hypotension.  Cultures were sent from blood and
urine.  IVF boluses were administered to maintain pressures with
systolics in 90s.  Her tachycardia improved with fluid
resuscitation.  Cefepime IV was given empirically.  Tylenol and
narcotic pain medication were given as needed.  A foley was
placed given the large amount of urine the patient was making.
She initially required O2 upon arrival in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], but this was
weaned after autodiuresis and a 20mg dose of lasix.  She
continued her home asthma medications.  A CXR showed no acute
process.  Her electrolytes were watched closely with serial labs
and repleted as necessary.  Her fever curve trended down and she
was transferred to the floor when her hemodynamics remained
stable without intervention for 24h period.  She remained
afebrile on the floor and was dc'd with antibiotics.  We will
f/u her culture results and alter these PRN.  She was
ambulating, voiding, without requiring oxygen, with adequate
pain control and afebrile prior to d/c.  She will f/u with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 3748**] as an outpatient.
