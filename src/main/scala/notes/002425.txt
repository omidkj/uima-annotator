Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1666**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
45 yo M with a PMH Of DMII, HTN, morbid obesity, and sleep apnea
who presents with SOB.  He states that he [**Doctor Last Name **] had worsening
dyspnea on exertion for approximately one month.  States he was
previously able to walk up three flights of stairs, but can now
only go up about 1.5 flights. This week he was unable to walk to
the bathroom without SOB. Also notes increased orthopnea
requiring [**3-19**] pillows, and prior to 9 months ago was able to
sleep on his back. He also notes increasing LE edema and
decreased urination over an unclear duration of time.  He also
notes edema in his back and increasing abdominal girth over the
past month.  Has seen PCP on this issue, and has his had lasix
uptitrated recently to 120mg QAM and 80mg QPM.  He states he is
medically compliant.  On ROS he denies cough, CP, rhonorrhea,
leg pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.  He denies tobacco use but
smokes marijuana daily.  Has also been diagnosed with severe
OSA, requiring him to quite his job [**1-16**] to daytime somnolence
and an MVA while at work.
.
In the ED, his vitals were: 97.5, 201/117, 102, 22 and (?)67% on
RA.  He was noted to have LE edema. He was placed on CPAP and
received NTG 0.3 SL tab x1, [**12-16**] inch of nitro paste,
Albuterol/atrovent nebs, azithromycin 500 mg po x1, and CTX 1 gm
IV x1. CXR was notable for assymetric pulmonary edema, cannot
r/o infiltrate. His BNP was 856. He was placed on BIPAP with
improved O2 sats. He refused A-line and they were unable to
obtain an ABG. He had c/o mild chest discomfort (although he
denies that he complained of this) but denies palpitations.  Has
started taking aspirin one week PTA, but denies ever being
instructed to do so by a physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] leaving the ED, this
O2 sat had improved to 96%/4L NC with these interventions.


Past Medical History:
-Hypertension
-Morbid Obesity
-Type 2 diabetes Mellitus --hgb A1c 6.9 in [**8-21**]
-sleep apnea, mixed sleep disorder: per Dr.[**Name (NI) 935**] note from
[**2167-12-25**]: "On [**2167-12-16**] he had a split study, which showed
severe mixed sleep-disordered breathing.  Sleep efficiency was
decreased in the 50 percentage level at that time with also
evidence of obstructive events as well as periodic breathing and
the baseline oxygen saturation while awake was in the 80s,
suggesting hypoventilation, although carbon dioxide level was
not checked.  He was subsequently evaluated on CPAP and BiPAP
with BiPAP destabilizing him and an effective pressure of CPAP
was not found.  He had a AHI of 130, desaturation to 53%, CPAP
and BiPAP failed in [**12-22**]; He was placed empirically on cpap auto
with a pressure of 15cm and a flex of 2. O2at 2L/min ; the past
six years, he has been having worsening symptoms of excessive
daytime sleepiness, nocturnal awakenings along with even
problems functioning at work.  He also has on occasion fallen
asleep or even just dozed off and most recently rear-ended
vehicle in front of him at a stoplight."

Social History:
Denies tobacco, etOH, or drug use current or past
Occ: previously employed driving trucks but now unable to due to
health problems

Pertinent Results:
ABG pH 7.38 / pCO 257 / pO2 67 / HCO3 35
.
EKG: Sinus tachycardia = 100bpm, nml axis, frequent PVCs, no TW
abnormalities
.
CXR:
AP UPRIGHT RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST: The exam is extremely
limited by poor penetration and technique. Increased
interstitial marking of the pulmonary edema is visualized. The
lungs are difficult to evaluate; however, patchy consolidation
is noted at the right lower lobe which might represent
asymmetric pulmonary edema or pneumonia/atelectasis. No pleural
effusion or pneumothorax is noted. Cardiac silhouette is mildly
enlarged. The hilar contours are prominent. The osseous
structures of the thorax appear normal.
IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with interstitial pulmonary
edema. Focal consolidation at the right lung base cannot be
excluded. This appearance is suggestive of asymmetric alveolar
pulmonary edema or less likely pneumonia/atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
The pt is a 45 yo AA male with a PMH significant for DMII, HTN,
morbid obesity, and sleep apnea who presents with SOB and
increased swelling in his LE.
 .
# Hypoxia/Hypercarbia: Multifactorial. Most likely [**1-16**] CHF: BNP
elevated and subsequent TTE showed LVEF of 35%. However, other
etiologies likely contributed to hypoxia as well:
hypoventilation and pulm HTN [**1-16**] severe OSA and obesity. ABG on
admission was c/w chronic retention at 7.38/57/67. Ruled-out for
MI with negative enzymes. PE and PNA unlikely given lack of
clinical or laboratory signs. On the floor, pt diuresed well
with lasix, and symptoms improved. The patient remained stable
throughout the hospitalization and reported no
SOB/CP/palpitations on day of discharge.
.
# CHF (acute on chronic systolic) - Although has had signs and
symptoms of CHF dating back to [**2162**] in prior notes.  There is no
echo in our system.  Echo done here showed EF of 35%.  Serum
studies were ordered to eval for secondary causes of CHF:  Iron
studies (hemochromatosis), CBC (anemia), TSH(hypothyroid) and
returned within normal limits. A stress test was ordered to
evalute for ischemia, however, given patient's weight  it had to
be a two day stress and patient could not stay in the hosptial.
Most likely etiology of CHF is  severe OSA however stress test
should be done to rule out ischemia as a possible etiology as an
outpatient.  Patient discharged home on 160mg PO lasix [**Hospital1 **] and
advised to f/u with PCP next week for chem 7 check.

# Severe OSA: Recently found to have very severe mixed sleep
apnea, AHI of 130, desaturation to 53%, CPAP and BiPAP failed.
Patient states poorly tolerated mask at home.  We gave
noninvasive mechanical ventilation with CPAP at 15 at night,
tolerated well. Pt was counseled to continue using CPAP at home
and he is scheduled for an overnight sleep titration study with
sleep lab.
.
# Lower extremity edema: Most likely [**1-16**] CHF and non-compliance
with meds.  Low suspicion for DVT given symmetry on exam,
nontender & no history of prolonged recumbency. Improved with
lasix during hospitalization, and was significantly improved by
day of discharge.
.
# HTN:  Hypertensive on admission to SBP > 200.  Confirms mild
CP, but denies HA or other symptoms of hypertensive urgency.
Discontinued Norvasc due to CFH. Maintained BP with lasix,
lisinopril, metoprolol, hydralzaine, while inpatient. The pt's
BP improved significantly with these measures and was stable
throughout this hospitalization. Stopped hydralazine on day of
discharge and changed over to hydrochlorthiazide. Pt was
instructed to follow up with PCP in next few days re: HTN
management.
.
# DM: Per patient is on glipizide and metformin and ASA as an
outpatient. While hospitalized, we held the pt's glipizide and
metformin, and instead used an insulin sliding scale. Restarted
glipizide and metformin on day of discharge.
.
# CRI: BL Cr 1.4. Cr and UO were monitored throughout
hospitaliz
