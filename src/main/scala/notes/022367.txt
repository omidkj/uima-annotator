Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  ICD firing.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 70 year old male with
a history of coronary artery disease, status post myocardial
infarction times two, coronary artery bypass graft
complicated by congestive heart failure (ejection fraction
15%), left ventricular thrombus, on Coumadin in the past, and
recurrent ventricular tachycardia, status post ablation/ICD
placement [**8-5**], now on Mexiletine and Sotalol, who presented
to outside hospital Emergency Department after repeated ICD
firing this a.m.  The patient stated that the ICD had not
fired since [**12-6**].  This incident occurred while he was in
bed, waking up in the morning.  He had no chest pain or
palpitations with these episodes, however, he reported for
the last two weeks feeling nauseated, lightheaded with
decreased exercise tolerance and appetite.  He states that
his weight has been decreasing since he started Zaroxolyn two
weeks ago and that he is constantly thirsty.  In the outside
hospital Emergency Department, he was started on Lidocaine
and Amiodarone drips after noting recurrent runs of
ventricular tachycardia.  His potassium was noted to be 1.8.
He was given 60 mEq of Potassium Chloride and transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**].  On another review of
systems, the patient denies palpitations, fevers, chills,
cough, shortness of breath, vomiting, abdominal pain, changes
in urinary symptoms.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2156**], status post myocardial infarction times
two.
2.  Congestive heart failure, ejection fraction 15 to 20%.
3.  Ventricular tachycardia, status post ablation and ICD
placement [**8-5**].
4.  Hypertension.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Past tobacco and quit thirty years ago.  No
current ETOH or other drugs.  The patient lives with wife in
[**Name (NI) 701**].  Exercises on treadmill thirty minutes a day.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, vital signs revealed
temperature 94.3, blood pressure 102/52, pulse 60,
respiratory rate 21, oxygen saturation 100% on one liter
nasal cannula.  In general, a pleasant male in no acute
distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination -
The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Clear
oropharynx.  Very dry mucous membranes.  Neck - jugular
venous pressure seven centimeters.  Supple.  Cardiovascular
shows regular rate and rhythm, soft S1 and S2, no murmurs,
rubs or gallops.  Pulmonary is clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended,
normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities showed no edema,
bilaterally 1+ dorsalis pedis and 2+ radial pulses
bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, from outside hospital, white
blood cell count 18.5, hematocrit 42.5, platelet count
178,000.  Chemistries notable for sodium 120, potassium 1.8,
chloride 80, bicarbonate 30, blood urea nitrogen 19,
creatinine 1.2, glucose 153, CK 52, MB 2.0, troponin I 0.29.

Electrocardiogram at outside hospital showed wide complex
tachycardia with right bundle branch block pattern.  Here
electrocardiogram showed AV paced right bundle branch block
pattern with wider QRS to 60 milliseconds.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Ventricular tachycardia - The patient was weaned off
Amiodarone and Lidocaine drips.  Liver function tests were
checked as previously had history of rising enzymes in the
setting of Amiodarone use, however, these were normal.  The
patient was taken to the Electrophysiology Laboratory for
mapping of ventricular tachycardia foci and had three
monomorphic ventricular tachycardia foci ablated.  Afterward,
telemetry showed occasional runs of atrial tachycardia
up to nine beats and he was restarted on lower dose of
Sotalol 80 mg p.o. twice a day.  He was not restarted on
Mexiletine.  He will return at a future date for
biventricular pacer upgrade by Electrophysiology service.
His ICD was also adjusted to fire and pace for slow rate
ventricular tachycardia in the 140s.

2.  Coronary artery disease - The patient continued on
Aspirin, beta blocker which was titrated up to Toprol 50 mg
and low dose ace inhibitor which was limited by blood
pressure.  He had no evidence of ischemia.

3.  Congestive heart failure - As the patient was very dry,
he was initially bolused with normal saline which improved
his clinical condition.  He had a repeat transthoracic
echocardiogram which showed ejection fraction of 10 to 15%.
He was started on Aldactone and his home dose of Lasix which
resulted in large amounts of diuresis ranging from one to 3.5
liters per day, which resulted in overdiuresis.  Thus, on
discharge, he will be instructed to check daily weight and
take Aldactone/Lasix if his weight increases beyond that of
his dry weight which is 213 pounds.

4.  Right groin pseudoaneurysm - The patient had development
of right groin hematoma and pseudoaneurysm documented by
ultrasound after his electrophysiology procedure.  Vascular
surgery was consulted and the patient had pseudoaneurysm
injected with thrombin.  His groin examination improved and
his hematocrit remained stable.

5.  Left lower extremity cellulitis - The patient had
leukocytosis initially with 8% bands and 73% neutrophils
suggestive of infection.  Blood cultures and urine cultures
were negative but we did note the development of erythema and
edema of the left lower extremity which was outlined by pen.
He was ruled out for left lower extremity deep vein
thrombosis by ultrasound and started on Unasyn for broad
coverage.  By hospital discharge, he was day 4.5 of
antibiotics.  He was switched to Zosyn near discharge as his
cellulitis had only minimally improved.  However, an
infectious disease consultation assured the team that it was
responsive to antibiotics and that he will be discharged on
two week course of Augmentin.  His left third and fourth toes
were also noted to have purulent discharge which was debrided
by podiatry prior to discharge.  The infectious disease team
took swabs which were sent for culture and are pending though
gram stain has been negative.  He will need to follow-up with
podiatry as an outpatient to continue following the toe
ulcers so will have VNA set up to do dressing changes daily.
He was instructed to be only partial weight-bearing to the
left lower extremity with touchdown weight-bearing to heel
only.

6.  Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus - Fingerstick was
noted to be in high 100s to low 200s and Lantus was increased
to 62 units q.d.  The patient seemed to have elevated blood
sugar mostly in the evenings around 9:00 to 10:00 p.m.  This
may further need to be adjusted as an outpatient.  He will
also continue on Humalog sliding scale p.r.n.

7.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The patient
initially admitted with extremely low potassium of 1.8 at
outside hospital and 2.1 on arrival here.  He required large
doses of Potassium repletion as he was totally body potassium
depleted.  However, after hydration and repletion of
electrolytes, his potassium remained stable on Aldactone and
Lasix.  He was initially noted to be hyponatremic and
hypochloremic as well, but this all improved after adequate
hydration.  He will be continued on cardiac diet.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home with
services.

1.  Congestive heart failure.
2.  Coronary artery disease.
