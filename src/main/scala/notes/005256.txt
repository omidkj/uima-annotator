History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 2405**] is an 83 yo female with PMH of CAD, COPD, MS, and
seizure disorder who awoke on the morning of admission at [**Hospital 100**]
Rehab with non-productive cough and rhinorrhea.  Her O2 sats
were 90-94% with a RR of 24 and she was afebrile. Mild stridor
was noted in the nursing records.  She was able to eat lunch,
but then developed worseing desaturations to 90% around 1:30.
She was given Zyrtec 5mg and combivent nebs with some subjective
improvement.  At 3:15, she was noted to have increasing
respiratory distress, SpO2 85% on RA and RR 38 --> 96%/3L,.  She
was given 60mg PO prednisone.  Given the acuity and failure to
improve with above meds, she was sent to the ED.

Per her daughter, she had a pna this winter, confirmed by xray.
This was managed at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.  She also said that her she
has witnessed her mother choking while eating very often.  She
previously used CPAP at night, but stopped using it because of
discomfort.

In the ED, initial vs were: 98.3 113 148/106 32 98.
She presented in severe respiratory distress with a
nonrebreather.  She was described as lethargic and struggling
for breath.  She was not intubated because of a DNR order in her
chart.  There is also a comfort care order, but the significance
of that was unclear and her family was unreachable.  She became
hypotensive to 62/36 and was given peripheral levophed without
central access because of the ambiguity of her advanced
directive.  Her WBC was 14.1 (85%N, 11%L).  HCT was 40.5.  Her
lactate was 1.8.  Chemistries were unremarkable, CEs were
negative x 1.  A proBNP was 203.  She was given
vanc/levo/flagyl.  She was given 125mg of methylprednisolone as
well [**Doctor Last Name **] albuterol/ipra nebs.  She was given IVF.  A CXR was read
as difficult to interpret given patient motion, possible
infiltrates vs effusions bibasilly, large lucency under left
hemidiaphragm either distended stomach or free air.  Because of
that, a CT abd was obtained.

Per daughter, she is alert and recognized daughter and
son-in-law, not uncomfortable.

On the floor, her breathing is labored though she otherwise
appears comfortable.  She speaks in [**1-27**] word sentences.  She
currently denies and SOB or difficulty breathing.

MICROBIOLOGY:

- Respiratory viral culture PENDING AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE
- Urine legionella antigen negative
- Blood culture 1/4 bottles (aerobic) positive for
coagulase-negative staph on [**2104-6-22**]
- Surveillence cultures [**Date range (1) 16006**] NO GROWTH AT THE TIME OF
DISCHARGE

IMAGING:

Chest X-ray [**2104-6-22**]
Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. The
exam is suboptimal due to patient motion and a repeat is
recommended.
Grossly, thoracolumbar scoliosis is seen. There is suggestion of
loss of
vertebral body height at multiple levels. Patchy opacities at
the lung bases could be due to patient motion, although
effusions and consolidation cannot be excluded. The aorta is
calcified and tortuous. The cardiac silhouette cannot be
evaluated. Lucency in the left hemidiaphragm could relate to a
distended gastric bubble, although free air is not excluded.
Recommend clinical correlation and repeat imaging as able.

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2104-6-22**] 7:19 PM
1. No pneumoperitoneum.
2. Extensive atherosclerotic disease, including a prominent
ascending aorta as well as focal aneurysmal dilation of both
common iliac arteries.
3. Extensive bony demineralization as well as scoliosis and
marked
compression deformities throughout the visualized spine.
4. Likely post-surgical changes from a left nephrectomy.
5. Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.


Brief Hospital Course:
83 yo female with PMH of COPD, multiple sclerosis, CAD presented
with hypoxic hypercapneic respiratory distress, altered mental
status, and hypotension.

#. Respiratory distress: Worsening respiratory distress at
[**Hospital 100**] Rehab requiring non-invasive ventilation in the setting
of worsening mental status.  ABG showed acute respiratory
acidosis.  Physical exam suggests COPD flare with possible
causes including pneumonia and/or aspiration.  Mental status
changes likely due to hypercapnea.  She received nebulizers and
BiPAP in the ED with improvement.  History of CPAP/BiPAP use
suggests history of hypoventilation.  She is a definite DNI per
her daughter who is HCP.  For initial therapy was treated with
Methylprednisolone 125 mg IV TID and broad spectrum antibiotics
for possible pneumonia including Vancomycin / Levofloxacin /
Flagyl.  She improved rapidly within hours of being in the ICU
which was more suggestive of an aspiration event with subsequent
pneumonitis.  Her steroids were rapidly tapered on day #2 to
Prednisone 40 mg with plan to taper over the following 3 days.
Flagyl was also discontinued [**2104-6-24**] and vanco was discontinued
on [**6-25**] after speciation of GPC in blood culture from [**6-22**] as
coag-neagtive staph.  Levofloxacin was continued for planned 5
day course. Rapid viral testing and urine Legionella were
negative.  She was continued on nebulizers both standing and as
needed, and recei
