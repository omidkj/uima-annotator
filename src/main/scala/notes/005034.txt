Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2553**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea / Tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right internal jugular central line placement


History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 88 y/o M with PMHx significant for CAD s/p MI
5 years ago (details unknown), CHF (EF 20-25%), HTN, HLD, who
presented to the ED with palpitations. The patient presented to
his PCP's office for worsened DOE that has been present for the
past month. ECG at his PCP's office reportedly showed SVT with a
HR of ~150. He received full dose ASA while at his PCP's office.
Vagal maneuvers did not work, and he was given 5 mg IV lopressor
with conversion back to sinus rhythm.
.
VS on arrival to the ED were 98 95 107/69 18 99%4LNC. In the ED,
labs were significant for a troponin of 0.39. Creatinine was
also elevated at 2.1 (which is increased from patient's
creatinine levels earlier this month; baseline unclear).
Hematocrit was 39.0, which was consistent with prior values.
Rectal exam revealed guaiac negative brown stool, and the
patient was started on a heparin gtt. Exam was significant for
bibasilar crackles (R>L). Bedside cardiac echo revealed no
pericardial effusion or RV dilations. Of note, the patient had
some borderline hypotension in the ED with systolic pressures in
the 80's, for which he was given 700 cc IVFs with improvement.
He does report that his BP's usually run low. VS prior to
transfer were 97.2 93 103/65 28 95%2L.
.
On arrival to the floor, the patient's VS were 96.2 100/70 100
24 97%4L. He describes one month of worsening DOE. +orthopnea.
+PND. Also with some SOB at rest at times. Denies any chest pain
or LE edema. Denies any palpitations. The patient has no other
complaints.
.
.
ROS: The patient denies any chest pain, palpitations,
diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, urinary
symptoms, focal numbness/weakness. He denies any pain other than
his chronic arthritic pain.

EKG: Poor baseline, SR, Left axis, Q waves in III aVF V1 V2, TWI
in V5 and V6 - consistent with prior
EKG from PCP's office showing tachycardia likely with
rate-related inferolateral TW changes

CXR [**2104-2-27**]:
Interval improvement of pulmonary edema with mild residual
patchy
opacities in the right lung, may be due to receding edema and
less likely
infection, although not excluded. Small bilateral pleural
effusions.

Echo [**2104-2-27**]:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis. Quantitative (biplane) LVEF = 13 %.
Left ventricular contraction pattern does not appear to be
dyssnchronous. The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild to moderate ([**12-2**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-2**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity size with severe
biventricular global hypokinesis c/w multivessel CAD or other
diffuse process. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild-moderate
aortic regurgitation

IMPRESSION: 1. Moderate fixed perfusion defects in the inferior
wall. No
evidence of reversible changes. 2. Evidence of congestive heart
failure with
increased lung activity on early imaging.


Brief Hospital Course:
88 y/o M with PMHx significant for CAD s/p MI 5 years ago
(details unknown), CHF (EF 20-25%), HTN, HLD, who presented to
the ED with palpitations, EKG with SVT, and CHF exacerbation.

# CHF exacerbation/SVT: Considering evidence of fluid overload
on exam, BNP >20,000 and SVT in the setting of heart failure, pt
was initially diuresed with IV lasix on the floor, first with IV
boluses.  On HD1, he had one episode of SVT to 150s, during
which pt was asymptomatic, that resolved with 5 mg IV
metoprolol, after which he appeared acutely more dyspneic and
had inceasing O2 requirement.  Improved with further diuresis on
lasix gtt, however on HD2 he had SVT to 150s again lasting about
one hour and did not improve initially with 15 mg IV metoprolol.
 Patient was asymptomatic from tachycardia, however after rate
returned to 70s, he felt increasingly more dyspneic and
somnolent.  BP 70s/50s.  250 cc of normal saline was given
considering patient had diuresed 1.3 liters overnight, and
pressures improved initially to 90s systolic, however returned
to 70s/50s.  He was then transferred to the CCU for pressors,
diuresis, and an amiodarone drip for rate control. Patient
received 1 dose of dopamine which caused flushing and atrial
tachycardia. He was switched to neosynephrine, but actually did
not require any further pressors during his stay in the CCU. He
achieve his diuresis goal of ~1L per day with the lasix drip and
this switched to lasix IV BID on [**2104-3-2**]. He was also loaded with
amiodarone 600mg TID for 6 days and then transitioned to 400mg
[**Hospital1 **]. He did not exhibit any episodes of atrial tachycardia over
several days. He will be discharged on lasix 20mg PO daily,
lisinopril 5mg daily. He will also continue Amiodarone 400mg PO
daily until [**2104-3-8**] at which point he will continue on Amiodarone
200mg PO daily. He was instructed to weight himself daily and to
report weight gain of more than 3lbs to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6512**].

#Coronaries:  Elevated cardiac enzymes in the ED suggesting
NSTEMI vs. rate-related myocardial strain complicated by
decreased troponin clearance in the setting of renal failure.
Heparin gtt was initiated in the ED but stopped on admission
given the low likelyhood of ACS. However, his aspirin 325 mg was
continued along with his statin. To further characterize
viability, he underwent a thallium scan that did not reveal any
reversible defects. Given the low likelihood of reversing the
cardiac dysfunction with bypass and/or coronary stenting, a
decision was made - in conjuction with himself and his family-
to manage his chronic cardiac issues medically.

# HTN: Documented history of hypertension. However, BP had been
running low prior to admission
