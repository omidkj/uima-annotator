Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1070**]
Chief Complaint:
weakness, falls

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
88 yo male with h/o DM2, HTN, chronic LBP s/p steroid injections
and facet block on [**2109-6-19**] who presents with worsening LBP,
frequent falls, and weakness. History was obtained from the
patient, his wife, and their family friend. [**Name (NI) 3003**] to the facet
block, the patient was apparently walking around and doing his
ADLs, though had significant LBP. After his facet block, he has
had progressive weakness in his BLE, and according to his wife,
worsening hunching of the back. Over the last few days, it has
progressed to where the patient is unable to ambulate with his
walker, and even falling off the couch requiring his family
members to lift him up. Also, his wife states over the last [**2-3**]
days, he's also had worsening BUE. They have also noticed that
he has started to have increase drooling from the right side of
his mouth. The patient fell last night, and now has some right
eye swelling, though his wife states that he did not hit his
head. According to them, he has not had any loss of
consciousness, or seizure like activity. He was evaluated by his
PCP last week for syncope, and had a bilateral carotid US and CT
head performed yesterday. His wife brought him to the [**Name (NI) **] today
because of his worsening back pain. The patient denies fevers,
chills, nausea, vomiting, chest pains, shortness of breath,
diarrhea, or abdominal pain. He has been constipated recently,
and has not had a BM in a few days. He denies melena, BRBPR, or
weight changes. Of note, the patient started mirapex and
gabapentin within the last 2 weeks for his RLS.

In the ED, vitals were 100.2 91/36 16 100% NRB. During his ED
stay, he dropped his BP to 84/36, and was given IV fluids. He
was eventually weaned down to 2LNC and was still 100%. He was
given a total of 3L NS, 3 amps HCO3 (for CKD and CT with
contrast), Vancomycin 1 gm, Levofloxacin 750 mg x 1, and
ceftriaxone 1 gm x 1. He had a CTA chest/abdomen/pelvis which
showed no evidence of aortic dissection or PE. His BP improved
107/50 prior to transfer. He was transferred to the MICU for
hypotension and weakness.

MRI/MRA -
FINDINGS: BRAIN MRI:
There is no evidence of acute infarct seen. There is
mild-to-moderate brain atrophy identified. No midline shift or
hydrocephalus seen. A few prominent perivascular spaces are seen
in the basal ganglia region bilaterally.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute infarct.
MRA OF THE HEAD:
The head MRA demonstrates normal flow signal in the arteries of
anterior and posterior circulation. There are bilateral fetal
posterior cerebral arteries noted an incidental finding with
consequent small basilar artery.
IMPRESSION: Normal MRA of the head.
.
CT abd -
CHEST: Unenhanced CT of the chest demonstrates atherosclerotic
calcification
along the thoracic aorta and coronary arteries. Several small
calcified
mediastinal and right hilar lymph nodes are seen. Post-contrast
imaging
demonstrates nodular enlargement of the right lobe of the
thyroid gland. The
aorta is tortuous but normal in caliber and there is no evidence
of
dissection. There is no pleural or pericardial effusion. No
pathological
enlargement of lymph nodes is seen in the axillary, mediastinal,
or hilar
stations. The central pulmonary arterial branches appear patent.
The airway
is patent centrally.

No concerning nodule, mass, or airspace consolidation is seen
within the lungs
bilaterally. Dependent atelectasis is noted in the lungs
posteriorly. There
is also compressive atelectasis in the left lower lobe adjacent
to the
tortuous aorta. A 4-mm nodule in the right lower lobe on image
61 of series 3
is stable from prior study from [**2108-4-9**]. No additional nodules
are seen within
the lungs.

ABDOMEN: The liver and spleen appear unremarkable, though
contrast phase is
suboptimal for detection of small lesions. The gallbladder
appears
unremarkable and is well distended. There is no biliary ductal
dilatation.
The portal vein appears patent. The pancreas, adrenal glands
have a normal
configuration. Kidneys are unremarkable. There is no
lymphadenopathy.

The abdominal aorta is tortuous but normal in caliber. There is
no aortic
dissection. There is mild atherosclerotic aortic calcification.
There is
tortuosity of the iliac vessels.

PELVIS: Small bowel demonstrates no evidence of ileus or
obstruction. There
is a normal appearance of the appendix. Large bowel contains a
moderate-to-
large amount of fecal residue. There is no definite evidence of
bowel wall
thickening, though lack of enteric contrast limits the
sensitivity of the
study. There is also no evidence to of mesenteric ischemia. The
urinary
bladder is well distended and appears essentially unremarkable.
Large amount
of stool is seen within the rectal vault. Clinically correlate
for impaction.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Degenerative changes are noted without
suspicious lytic
or sclerotic lesion. A sclerotic focus in the left iliac bone is
likely a
bone island, unchanged from [**2108**] CT.

IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of aortic dissection or other acute process.
.
CT of head -
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute hemorrhage.
Lytic changes are noted in the skull of uncertain etiology. A
bone scan may be
performed to exclude neoplatic process as clinically warranted.
.
Echo - The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Transmitral Doppler
and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (
