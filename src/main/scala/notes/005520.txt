History of Present Illness:
Briefly 57 yo F w/ COPD on home O2 and prednisone and
tracheobronchial malacia p/w inability to wean vent. Initially
presented to [**Hospital 1562**] hospital with SOB on [**11-4**] and was
intubated on [**11-5**] for COPD exacerbation/PNA got 11 day course
of zosyn and diflucan. She was trached on [**11-9**]. She was
bronched and diagnosed with tracheobronchial malacia at OSH and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on the TSICU service. TSICU team had been
trying to wean her off of propofol but she repeatedly became
very anxious and dropped her O2 sats. She was started on
quetiapine and her propofol was stopped this am. She has failed
trials with PM valve several times. TSICU team has been
attempting to diurese her but she has continued to run positive.
Her Aline was replaced yesterday. She has been getting nutren
TFs. She is transferred to the MICU for further weaning of her
PEEP and possible stenting of her tracheobronchial malacia.

CXR [**11-18**]:
Tracheostomy tube is in standard position. NG tube tip is out of
view below the diaphragm. Cardiac size is normal. The lungs are
hyperinflated Small right pleural effusion is unchanged from
prior. Of note the left lateral CP angle was not included on the
film. Minimal atelectasis is noted in the left lower lobe. There
is no pneumothorax.

Bronchoscopy [**11-22**]:
Proximal: mild tracheomalacia
Mid: moderate tracheomalacia
Distal: severe tracheomalacia
Airways: Severe right mainstem, bronchus intermedius, left
main-stem bromchomalacia.
Plan: Discharge to rehab, f/u in a few months when recovered.


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT & PLAN:  57 yo F w/ COPD, morbid obesity, TBM and
failure to wean vent.

#  Failure to wean/COPD/TBM: Appears chronic retainer. A large
component of her difficulty with weening was anxiety related.
Upon arrival at the MICU, she was gently diuresed and her
anxiety was controlled with PRN ativan. She was able to be
weened to PS 14/10 and she is able to tolerate PS 8/5 for a
short time, enough to try a Passy Muir valve for some time.
However, she feels much more comfortable with a PEEP of 10. She
does have some significant respiratory muscle weakness with a
NIF of 23, likely due to her extended ventilator exposure, with
no signs of peripheral muscle weakness. However, other
etiologies for respiratory muscle weakness should be considered
if she continues to have difficulty weening. After her PEEP was
weened down to 5 for some time, she was rebronched by the
Interventional Pulmonary service who did see some distal
tracheobronchial malacia but nothing proximal that they felt
placing a stent in would assist in her weening. She may follow
up with the IP service in several months after she has been
weened for further evaluation and treatment. She is continued on
her home dose of prednisone, combivent inhalers, and PO lasix.
Due to her ventilated status, she could not receive her home
Spriva or Foradil but these should be restarted after weening.

#Anxiety: Well controlled with Low dose PRN ativan.
.
#DMII: Blood sugars were noted to be elevated, likely
representing underlying type 2 diabetes worsened by steroids and
stress. Well controlled with an insulin sliding scale in
hospital but should be switched to PO agents at a later time
before returning home.
.
#Trach pain: Uncomfortable at the site of her tracheostomy. Well
controlled with small doses of PO dilaudid and tylenol, with
chloraseptic PRN.

#HTN: Well controlled on valsartan and diltiazem.
.
# PPX: famotidine, heparin SQ, bowel regimen
# ACCESS: PICC
