Admission Date:  [**2174-5-7**]     Discharge Date:  [**2174-5-16**]


Service:  CARDIAC

Transferred from [**Hospital3 **] Hospital for congestive heart
failure.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 85-year-old male with
history of coronary artery disease, status post myocardial
infarction and hypertension, who was in his usual state of
health until [**2174-5-5**].  The patient initially presented
to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital for ventricular fibrillation arrest on
[**2174-5-5**].  The arrest was witnessed by a family member,
who performed CPR.  He was defibrillated in the field and
intubated and was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital in normal
sinus rhythm.  He was extubated on [**2174-5-6**] and was
started on intravenous amiodarone for his ventricular
fibrillation.  After extubation at the outside hospital, the
patient had agitation treated with Haldol and Ativan and was
hypoxic with crackles on exam and jugular venous distention.
He was treated with intravenous Lasix.  On the morning of
[**5-7**], the patient was noted to be minimally responsive.
Arterial blood gas on 50% Ventilator face mask was 7.35, 43,
65.  At 7:30 a.m., the patient received .2 mg of rimexolone
to reverse Ativan with improved mental status.  Patient had
an echocardiogram at the outside hospital showing ejection
fraction of 20-25% with global left ventricular hypokinesis
and heavily calcified aortic valve with moderate aortic
stenosis and based on his chest x-ray, echocardiogram and
bilateral crackles and hypoxia, he was treated with 40 mg
intravenous of Lasix and diuresed 900 cc of fluid.  He denies
shortness of breath, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea
and nocturia and syncope.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives alone.  Health care proxy is his son
[**Name (NI) **].  [**Name2 (NI) **] smoked 30 years, but quit 15 years ago.  No
alcohol, no drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Well-developed elderly male in no
acute distress.  Oriented times one with following simple
commands.  Vital signs were stable at the time of admission.
Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.  Extraocular
movements intact.  Oropharynx with brown dried blood.  No
carotid bruits.  Jugular venous pressure of about 9 cm.
Cranial nerves II through XII are intact, bilateral crackles
with decreased breath sounds at the right base.  Question of
mild wheezing.  Heart was regular with extrasystoles, 3/6
systolic murmur at the apex radiating to axilla.  Soft
abdomen, nontender, nondistended with normal active bowel
sounds.  There is no edema on his extremities.  He had 2+
pulses bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 13.0, hematocrit
44.0, sodium 134, potassium 4.1, chloride 99, bicarbonate 24,
BUN 44, creatinine 1.9.  His CKs were negative.  CK-MB were
negative.  He had a troponin leak with a peak of 3.3.  ALT
183, AST 88, alkaline phosphatase 81, total bilirubin 1.2,
calcium 8.4, phosphate 3.0, magnesium 2.0.  Electrocardiogram
showed sinus rhythm at 84 beats per minute with normal axis,
normal intervals, poor R wave progression, right atrial
enlargement, Q waves in II and aVF are consistent with the
electrocardiogram in [**2171-2-12**].  Echocardiogram by
report from [**Hospital3 **] showed ejection fractions of 20-25% with
global left ventricular hypokinesis, really calcified aortic
valve with moderate aortic stenosis and pulmonary
hypertension and left bundle branch on old electrocardiogram
report, R wave progression.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  Cardiovascularly:  The patient did not show any signs of
active ischemia.  His troponin leak was thought to be from
his congestive heart failure.  He was kept on aspirin and
also underwent a cardiac catheterization, which showed two
vessel coronary artery disease.  The left anterior descending
artery was mildly calcified proximally, but had no flow
limiting lesions.  The left circumflex was totally occluded
proximally and the distal vessel and obtuse marginal filled
via left-to-left collaterals.  The dominant right coronary
artery was totally occluded proximally with a distal vessel
filling via left-to-right and right-to-right collaterals.
Left ventriculography revealed severe 3+ mitral regurgitation
with global hypokinesis and a calculated ejection fraction of
30%.  Resting hemodynamics revealed normal left and right
sided filling pressures.  There is mild pulmonary
hypertension with a mean pulmonary artery pressure of 26
mmHg.  There is no step up in oxygen saturation between the
SVC and the PA.  There was no significant gradient noted
across the aortic valve on catheter pull back from the left
ventricle.  Final diagnosis from the cardiac catheterization:
 Two vessel coronary artery disease, severe mitral
regurgitation, and severe systolic ventricular dysfunction.

An echocardiogram was also obtained on admission which showed
moderately dilated left atrium and right atrium with severely
dilated left ventricular cavity.  There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis with severely depressed systolic
function.  There is severe global right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis as well.  No aortic valve stenosis was seen on
this echocardiogram.  No aortic regurgitation was seen.
There was severe 4+ mitral regurgitation with 3+ tricuspid
regurgitation and severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.  No pericardial effusion was seen.

The patient was aggressively diuresed for his congestive
heart failure.  Seven to eight liters of fluid were removed
with diuresis.  He improved substantially in terms of his
pulmonary status and was weaned off of oxygen.  Due to his
recent ventricular fibrillation arrest, and his poor ejection
fraction of 20-30%, Electrophysiology Team was consulted who
recommended and electrophysiology study, as well as a likely
defibrillator.  The patient was noted to have baseline atrial
flutter.  Ablation was attempted and resulted in atrial
fibrillation.  The patient was started on dofetilide and
ventricular tachycardia was also induced.  During the
electrophysiologic study, a defibrillator was placed via the
left cephalic access.  The patient was loaded on dofetilide,
but continued to be in atrial fibrillation.  He underwent
electrocardioversion without any problems and remained in
sinus rhythm thereafter.  The patient was started back on
beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors which were titrated up as
tolerated.

The patient was started on Coumadin therapy for his atrial
fibrillation, as well as for his poor ejection fraction and
global hypokinesis.  He was discharged after his INR was
above 2.0.  He was also evaluated by Physical Therapy who
recommended home safety evaluation as well as home Physical
Therapy.  He was discharged home with services.  He was to
have his INR and renal function checked by his primary care
physician in three days.  Goal INR of 2.0 to 3.0.

Hospital course was also significant for question of
aspiration pneumonia diagnosed at the outside hospital.  He
was transferred here on clindamycin.  The clindamycin was
switched over to levofloxacin and Flagyl for two days while
waiting for the sputum culture to come back.  Sputum culture
revealed sparse oropharyngeal flora.  The patient remained
afebrile and clinically stable with no infiltrate on chest
x-ray.  The p
