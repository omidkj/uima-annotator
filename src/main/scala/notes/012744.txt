History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo male with PMH CAD s/p NSTEMI, recent pna, GIB, who p/w
hypoxia.  Pt recently d/c'd from [**Hospital1 **] on [**4-19**] s/p NSTEMI which was
medically managed and LLL pna, was d/c'd to NH where he remained
in stable condition where he completed 10-day course of
levoflox, with plans for d/c home today, when he developed SOB
and dizziness, along with anxiety and chest discomfort.
Symptoms similar to past presentation in early [**Month (only) 958**] with
NSTEMI, sent to [**Hospital1 **] for further eval.  On arrival to ED, anxious
and shaking/tremulous, and c/o mild SOB.  Noted to be 94% on RA,
febrile at 100.4, VS otherwise stable with BP 97/45-118/41.
Labs notable for WBC 20,000 and lactate 2.2.  Cxr showed
increased LLL consolidation.  Concern for pna, got ctx 1 gram IV
and azithro 500mg po, along with ASA 325 and lopressor 5mg IV.
Then dropped BP to 83/37, got IVF with some improvement.  Got
total of 5 liters of IVF, with BP's still borderline per ED
staff (?80s-110s), femoral line was placed and started on IV
levophed.  Also got ceftaz for additional abx coverage.  Placed
on NRBM eith O2 sats 100%.
.
Pt without any c/o.  His dizziness has resoleved, and his
breathing feels better than earlier.  He does c/o feeling tired
and general fatigue.  Large, loose BM earlier today, no other
h/o diarrhea, and no abd pain or nausea.
.
In terms of his recent hospital admission, he was admitted on
[**4-16**] with dizziness, "room spinning", found to have NSTEMI which
was managed medically.  Briefly in icu where he was stable.
Managed on heparin/integrelin, along with ASA/statin/bb, he
declined cath.  Noted to have GIB on anti-coagulation, seen by
GI, declined endoscopy, started empirically on protonix.  Noted
to have cough with ?LLL infiltrate.  He was tx for ?pna with
azithro & ctx x 3 days, then transitioned to levoflox, d'c'd on
levoflox [**4-19**] for 10 days of tx.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old male with CAD s/p NSTEMI, GI bleed, recent
pneumonia, who was recently discharged to rehab following an
NSTEMI which was medically managed and left lower lobe pneumonia
 for which he completed a course of levofloxacin, who presented
with shortness of breath and hypotension, found to have a
worsening left lower lobe consolidation. His hospital course was
significant for the following problems:
.
#. Hypoxia/sob/hypotension:  His initial presentation with
dyspnea, leukocytosis, and a CXR showing worsening LLL
consolidation was concerning for a pneumonia.  Given his recent
hospitalization and nursing home stay there was concern for a
hospital/nursing home acquired organism and he was broadly
covered with vancomycin and Zosyn.  His hypotension was treated
with aggressive fluid resuscitation and Levophed which he
required until [**5-1**].  Levaquin was considered a "failure" due to
his worsening pneumonia so he was continued on Vancomycin and
Zosyn which he was completed on [**5-9**].
.
#. C. difficile colitis:  Pt tested positive for C. difficile on
[**5-1**] and was started on oral metronidazole.  He continued to
have diarrhea but it was not considered a failure because he was
still on IV antibiotics for his pneumonia.  He should continue
Flagyl for a total of one week after stopping the antibiotics
(until [**5-16**]).  If his diarrhea continues, he should be started on
po Vancomycin, 125 mg po QID.
.
#. Rhythm: Pt had several episodes of atrial fibrillation with
rapid ventricular response in the ICU.  He was restarted on his
Lopressor at the low dose of 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **].  When the team
attempted to titrate the beta blocker up, he became hypotensive
to the 70s.  He was then loaded with digoxin and had no further
episodes of atrial fibrillation.  He continued to have several
brief runs of NSVT that were asymptomatic.  He was never shocked
given his wishes for no resuscitation.
.
#. CAD:  Pt had a recent admission for a NSTEMI.  His EKG on
this admission was stable as were his cardiac enzymes.  He was
continued on aspirin.  His Lasix and beta-blocker were initially
held given his presentation with hypotension but metoprolol was
restarted.
.
#. CHF: Pt noted to be volume overloaded on exam and on CXR.
Lasix however was held [**3-13**] hypotension.  It was restarted at a
small dose and he tolerated it. The dose of laxis can be
titrated up to the pt's home dose of 20mg daily (as tolerated).
.
#. Gastrointestinal bleed:  Pt had a GI bleed during his last
hospitalization in the setting of anticoagulation for his NSTEMI
(heparin/Integrilin).  He had an small episode of BRBPR but his
hematocrit remained stable during this admission.
.
#. Dizziness:  He has a history of Meniere's disease for which
he was previously on meclizine.  During the hospitalization he
occasionally complained of dizziness, but it subsequently
resolved.
