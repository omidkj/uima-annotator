Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1042**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of PICC line.
Removal of PICC line.


History of Present Illness:
38yM with numerous hospital admissions well known to the
medicine service with history of Type 1 DM, ESRD on HD, recent
anterior STEMI s/p bare metal stent, episodes of hypoxia [**3-17**]
pulmonary edema now being called out of MICU.
.
Briefly, he was recently admitted in [**12/2184**] for anterior STEMI.
He subsequently developed severe pulmonary edema and hypoxia
requiring MICU stay. He was aggressively diuresed with HD and
oxygenation improved. He was discharged last week, but then 2
days ago developed SOB again, was hypertensive and tachycardic,
and was readmitted to ICU service. He responded well to CPAP and
BP improved with nitro gtt. He underwent HD with 3.5 kg fluid
removal and sats improved to 90's on RA. Cardiology was
consulted for lateral ST elevations and concern for another
STEMI, but they did not think this was likely at this time.
.
Upon arrival to floor, he has no complaints and states that his
breathing is significantly improved. He denies any dietary
indiscretion while out of the hospital. He denies any CP, SOB,
palpitations, N/V/abdominal pain or any other of his usual
symptoms. he denies any fevers, chills, but does note frequent
sweats.

.
CXR [**2187-1-9**]: AP chest compared to [**1-1**] and 26 shows
subsequent improvement in diffuse infiltrative pulmonary
abnormality which had worsened between [**1-1**] and [**1-8**]. The progression is consistent with improvement in pulmonary
edema although mild cardiomegaly is stable throughout and there
is no particular mediastinal vascular engorgement. Other
diagnoses to consider include pulmonary hemorrhage. Small
bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged since [**12-27**]. A
dual-channel right supraclavicular dialysis catheter ends in the
mid and low SVC. No pneumothorax.
.
ECHO [**2187-1-9**]: The left atrium is elongated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %) with mid to apical
anteroseptal and anterior akinesis. Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Compared with the
prior study (images reviewed) of [**2186-12-28**], left ventricular
wall motion is similar.
.
IR PICC placement [**2187-1-10**]: Successful placement of 36-cm total
length single-lumen PICC via right basilic vein access with tip
in the SVC. The line is ready for use. Venograms demonstrating
extensive fibrin sheath around the right IJ tunneled dialysis
catheter at the level of the right brachiocephalic vein and SVC.
.
ECG [**2187-1-13**]: Technically difficult study. Sinus rhythm. Inferior
infarct, age indeterminate - consider acute. Anteroseptal
infarct - age undetermined. Lateral ST-T changes offer
additional evidence of ischemia
Since previous tracing of [**2187-1-9**], anterior ST segment
elevation and T wave inversion less prominent.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Respiratory Distress: Two days prior to admission, the patient
was discharged s/p anterior STEMI complicated by severe
pulmonary edema and hypoxia, treated in the MICU with aggressive
hemodialysis which improved oxygenation. The patient then
presented again with shortness of breath. He was found to be
hypertensive and tachycardic, so was readmitted to the ICU. He
responded well to CPAP, nitro GTT and hemodialysis.  After
transfer from MICU, the patient was free of respiratory distress
and was satting in the 90's on room air. His SOB was thought to
be secondary to fluid overload, although underlying etiology
unclear as multiple echocardiograms have not shown dramatic
change in cardiac function. There was initially some concern for
diffuse alveolar hemorrhage; however HCT was stable and he
responds so acutely to hemodialysis an and fluid removal.
.
# Hypertension: The patient is hypertensive at baseline, and
blood pressures can be very labile. In the ICU, nitro GTT was
used to provide aggressive BP control. Of note, blood pressures
increased to 190's systolic or higher during episodes of
gastroparesis. HTN during these episodes responded well to pain
control and, if necessary, nitropaste. In addition, blood
pressures drop to the 110's systolic after hemodialysis; the
patient's antihypertensive regimen was held as needed post
dialysis. Once stabilized in the MICU, the patient's BP med
requirement decreased compared to his pre-admission regimen.
This was thought to be related dietary indiscretion as an
outpatient in the setting of ESRD requiring HD.
.
# STEMI: cards evaluated pt in MICU and felt that patient did
not have a new STEMI; persistent STE at this time were thought
to be residual. The patient's troponins trended down from their
peak. He was maintained on ASA, [**Date Range 4532**], ACEI and statin, as well
as aggressive BP control
.
# Gastroparesis: The patient suffers severe gastroparesis as a
result of his diabetes. It is thought that the severe pain
precipitates a hypertensive crisis which, if untreated, might
contribute to shortness of breath and flash pulmonary edema. The
patient was maintained on PRN ativan/dilaudid for pain control.
When gastroparesis episodes were refractory, the frequency of
his PRN's were increased and blood pressure was monitored and
controlled. He was also made NPO except meds with his diet
advanced
