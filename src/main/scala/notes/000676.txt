Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath.

Endotracheal intubation


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 82 year-old male with a history of diastolic
dysfunction, recent MRSA pneumonia, and asthma, who initially
presented on [**2141-5-1**] with a 1-day history of increased SOB,
productive cough and congestion.

On arrival to the ED, CXR showed moderate CHF. He was
empirically started on Vancomycin, CTX, Prednisone, and Lasix,
with some improvement. However, after several hours in the ED,
he became hypertensive, tachycardic, and hypoxemic, with
desaturation to the 80s. He was started on a nitro drip and
intubated. In ED, he was also noted to have anterolateral EKG
changes, with new TWI in I, aVL, and "pseudonormalization" of T
waves in V3-6. Enzymes elevated. He was admitted to the MICU for
further care.

Past Medical History:
1. Diastolic dysfunction
2. Hypertension
3. Asthma
4. History of bronchiolitis obliterans pneumonia ([**4-/2134**])
5. Chronic renal failure with baseline creatinine high 2s-low 3s
6. History of diverticular bleed, and upper GI bleed in 03/[**2140**].
EGD with gastric erosions.
7. Colonic adenoma
8. Giardia ([**3-/2137**])

prior, worse EF, new WMA. E/A 1.60.

[**2141-5-3**] CXR: Moderately severe pulmonary edema has changed in
distribution but not in overall severity, accompanied by
persistent small left and small-to-moderate right pleural

Brief Hospital Course:
82 year-old male with CHF, CRI, prior GI bleed (both upper and
lower), admitted with respiratory failure. His hospital course
will reviewed by problems.

1. Respiratory failure: His acute decompensation was felt most
consistent with flash pulmonary edema, requiring intubation.
While in the ICU, he was diuresed with IV Lasix, switched to
oral Lasix with good results. He was also continued empirically
on Vancomycin and CTX for coverage of CAP. Sputum gram stain
returned positive for GN diplococci, and culture eventually grew
Moraxella catarrhalis. Vancomycin was discontinued on [**2141-5-5**].
He self-extubated on [**2141-5-4**], and did well thereafter. He
completed a 7-day course of CTX on [**2141-5-8**] for Morazella in his
sputum. Please see below for further details on his CHF
management.

2. CAD: His cardiac enzymes on admission were noted to be
trending up, and an EKG was concerning for "pseudonormalization"
of T waves in V3-6 versus 04/[**2140**]. It is of note that cardiac
enzymes were not obtained in [**3-/2141**] in the setting of these
changes. He was briefly started on heparin, which was
discontinued in the setting of a hematocrit drop and probable
demand ischemia rather than ACS. An echo was obtained on
[**2141-5-2**], which revealed new systolic dysfunction with EF 35%,
with mid to distal septal and apical akinesis. Cardiology was
consulted. Review of his records indicated a recent echo with
preserved systolic function in 03/[**2140**]. He was felt to have
likely had a recent anterior MI, with superimposed
demand/subendocardial ischemia. He was deemed a poor
catheterization candidate given his stage IV CKD, and medical
management was advised. His troponin continued to rise in the
ICU, but CK was trending down. He was continued on ASA and
statin. Toprol was changed to Metoprolol (not renally cleared),
which was titrated up. He was started on Captopril while in the
ICU, subsequently discontinued in the setting of an acute rise
in his creatinine. Hydralazine and Isordil were subsequently
started (lower dose than before admission).

3. CHF: As noted above, he was found to have new systolic
dysfunction, felt likely secondary to a recent anterior MI. In
addition, he likely has a component of diastolic dysfunction.
His acute presentation was felt secondary to flash pulmonary
edema, and he responded well to diuresis. He was weaned off
oxygen, and was saturating well on room air at the time of
discharge. He was placed back on Lasix 40 mg daily. Please note
that while in the hospital, his oral Lasix was transiently held
in the setting of hyponatremia, which improved after holding
Lasix for 48 hours. His sodium and creatinine will need to be
closely monitored as an out-patient. He needs to remain on Lasix
from a cardiac standpoint. He was also discharged oh Hydralazine
25 mg PO QID and Imdur 30 mg daily for afterload reduction
(acute rise in creatinine with Captopril).

3. GI bleed: While in the hospital, he was noted to have guaiac
positive stools, associated with a hematocrit drop to 24 on
[**2141-5-2**] (albeit also in the setting of a short course of IV
heparin). He was transfused 2 units of PRBCs on that day. Review
of his recent data indicated an EGD in [**2-/2141**] remarkable for
gastric erosion. He was placed on PRotonix 40 mg twice daily
(initially IV then PO), and Carafate PO QID. His hematocrit
remained stable thereafter, and further work-up was not pursued.


4. CRI: Patient with known CKD with fluctuating creatinine at
baseline, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3271**] as an out-patient. While in
the hospital, his creatinine rose to a peak of 4.2, at one point
with concomitant hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia. He was
started on CaCO3 and Sevelamer, with correction of his
hyperphosphatemia. A recent renal U/S in [**2-/2141**] was remarkable
for thin cortices suggestive of parenchymal disease. Prior lab
data were also remarkable for known nephrotic range proteinuria,
negative SPEP/UPEP in [**2139**]. The renal service was consulted on
[**2141-5-9**] for further advice, with an impression of probable
hypertensive nephrosclerosis possibly also with superimposed
FSGS. He had no indication for acute hemodialysis, although it
is likely that he will need long-term hemodialysis in the near
future. His family, however, is very reluctant to consider it.
