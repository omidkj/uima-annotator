Chief Complaint:
Cool, pulseless Right foot - R common femoral artery occlusion
found on CTA at [**Hospital3 **]

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2107-2-22**] Right iliofemoral popliteal embolectomy and thrombectomy.
[**2107-2-28**] PCI of the SVG-LAD with DES


History of Present Illness:
71 F with a complex pmh who presented to [**Hospital3 19345**] on [**2107-2-22**] c/o R leg pain.  On exam she was found to
have cool, pulsless right foot and a CTA revealed a right CFA
occlusion.  She was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation
and intervention.

Of note the pt has a h/o PAD with a left fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass and
subsequent angioplasty to the graft about a year ago. She was
admitted to [**Hospital3 **] in [**2106-12-21**] and had bilateral lower
extremity angiography for persistent bilateral LE claudication
symtptoms. Per the report, she had angioplasty of the fem-[**Doctor Last Name **]
bypass graft. Records also state that the angio showed
hemodynamically moderate Right common iliac artery stenosis and
moderate distal right superficial femoral artery and popliteal
artery.

The left atrium is mildly dilated. A small secundum atrial
septal defect is present. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Small secundum ASD. Normal global and regional
biventricular systolic function. Mild pulmonary hypertension.

2. Patent SVG-Diag-OM and SVG-RCA grafts.

5. Extensive left SFA disease.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 43357**] was transferred from an OSH on [**2107-2-21**] with acute
ischemia of her right
lower extremity and a CT angiogram which showed thrombus
involving the distal external iliac, common femoral and proximal
superficial femoral and deep femoral arteries. Upon transfer the
patient was in florid pulmonary edema (as a result of contrast
dye allergy), had EKG changes suggestive of an evolving MI and
was intubated. As a result, we decided to try to temporize with
IV heparin to see if she
would stabilize to the point where surgery could be avoided.
However, by the morning of [**2107-2-22**], it was clear that her foot
was not really improving, it was dusky, somewhat mottled in
appearance although the  muscles were very soft and we
decided in spite of the high risk situation to proceed with
embolectomy. She was taken to the OR and underwent Right
iliofemoral popliteal embolectomy and
thrombectomy. She tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred back to the CVICU on a heparin gtt in stable
condition. Coumadin was initiated and she remained on heparin
until a therapeutic INR was reached. An echo was obtained on [**2-22**]
and was normal with an EF >55% without sign of thrombus. Ms.
[**Known lastname 43357**] was monitored closely and was not felt stable for
extubation until [**2107-2-24**]. She was transferred to the VICU and
began taking po's on [**2-24**] as well.

The pt had atrial fibrillation on [**2-24**] which initially resolved
with iv lopressor. She did have several other episodes of afib
and was eventually rate controlled with beta blocker. Given the
initial ekg changes, rising troponins and afib, and strong
cardiac hx, a cardiology consult was obtained. They advised
continued heparin gtt, aggressive beta blockade, addition of an
ace inhibitor, serial ekgs and troponins. On [**2107-2-28**] her INR was
reversed with FFP and she was taken for a cardiac cath. She was
found to have stenosis of the SVG-LAD graft and underwent
successful PCI of the SVG-LAD with DES. She tolerated the
procedure well. Although initially anticoagulated for her
iliofemoral thrombus, it is also indicated given her atrial
fibrillation. She was restarted on coumadin with a goal INR of
2.0-3.0

On [**2-25**] the bedside nurse noted the pt had difficulty swallowing
and a speech/swallow consult was obtained. It was recommended
that the pt be NPO until further evaluation. However, on [**2-26**] the
pt did take some po's with nursing supervision and tolerated
without difficulty. A speech re-evaluation later confirmed that
the pt was taking po's without difficulty.

Also on [**2-25**] Ms. [**Known lastname 43357**] complained of Right shoulder pain and
reported that she fell and "broke" it several weeks prior. A
should xray and orthopedics consult were obtained. Found to have
a remote rt humeral head fracture which is non operable at this
time. They recommended active and passive ROM as tolerated and
sling as needed for comfort. Pt felt she did not need the sling
at this time. She should f/u in [**Hospital 3782**] clinic in [**4-26**] weeks.

Ms. [**Known lastname 43357**] continued to improve through out the remainder of
her stay. She remained hemodynamically stable and chest pain
free after her stent. She worked with physical therapy and was
able to ambulate with assistance. She was tolerating a regular
diet and voiding without difficulty. On [**2107-3-2**] she was deemed
stable for discharge to home with family.

She is discharged with a VNA and eval for home PT. I have spoken
to her daughter in law who is the only family member that can
read. I have reviewed the instructions with her, and will also
review with the pt and son via a [**Name (NI) 8003**] interpreter prior to
discharge. I have spoken to the nurse at her primary care and
cardiologists office. The PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 16968**] will follow her PT/INR
and see her in clinic next week. Her cardiologist, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 86177**] will see her in 2 weeks.
