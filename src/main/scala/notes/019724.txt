History of Present Illness:
42 y/o M with advanced HIV/AIDS last CD4 1 ([**2163-2-2**]), h/o many OP
including PCP PNA multiple times and recently treated admitted
[**Date range (1) 15253**] and again [**Date range (1) 15354**] for PCP pneumonia [**Name Initial (PRE) **] at those times
was treated with clindamycin/primaquine/steroids (history of
Bactrim allergy->aseptic meningitis) and improved, also history
of lupus anticoagulant c/b DVT/PE and IMI in [**2157**] s/p RCA
stenting, on coumadin as outpt, now presenting to ED with CP
(described as chest pressure, like someone stepping on his
chest) radiating to his teeth, bilateral upper and lower
extremity tingling and +chills. Pt states that he woke up
morning of admission with complaint of substernal chest pain
radiating to his right jaw and bilateral upper and lower
extremity tingling sensation, [**6-6**] in intensity, unrelated to
exertion, and lasting for approximately 6 hrs. Pain stopped at 2
pm and pt presented to ED. Patient denies ever having this type
of pain before. States symptoms with last MI in [**2157**] were more
agitation (reports wandering around the hospital, very
agitated).
.
ROS on admission: increased night sweats x 2 days, HA at back of
head x 2 days intermittent with no n/v/photophobia but
completely resolved today, increased yellow drainage from right
nostril x 1 wk, no increased cough, no abd pain, no diarrhea. Pt
states these symptoms are not typical of his PCP infections
since he usually feels sob and cough with clear sputum.
.
In ED, VS were T 100.8 rectally, BP 93/56 which decreased to SBP
80s, RR 24, HR 90, sats 99% 5L. Pt remained hypotensive with SBP
as low as 75/36 and lactate returned back at 4.0. Given concern
for sepsis, RIJ sepsis CVL was placed, pt was given Vancomycin 1
gm IV and Levofloxacin 500 mg IV as well as ASA 325 mg, Decadron
6 mg IV x1, 4 L IVF, and Levophed started for hypotension. EKG
showed [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevations inferiorly - cardiology was consulted
who felt that pt's EKG was similar to a previous EKG when pt had
been septic. Trop increased from 0.07 to 0.44. Heparin was
briefly started but then stopped per cards consult (then
restarted in ICU). ST elevations resolved on repeat EKG. On
subsequent labs with rehydration, Hct decreased from 38 to 27
and lactate decreased to 1.1. Pt was transferred to ICU for
further management.
.
In ICU, patient was treated with broad spectrum abx w/ vanc and
CTX, given stress dose steroids, otherwise maintained on his
outpatient medications. He was weaned off pressor support,
fevers resolved. He was re-started on hep gtt in ICU for r/i w/
CE. His lab values notable for stabilization of his Hct 28-30,
WBC of 3.9 with 6% bands on day of transfer, Cr resolved from
1.7 -> 1.2, CK 107 -> 202 -> 454 -> 440, MB 11 -> 38 -> 88 ->
72, Index 5.9 -> 18.8 -> 19.4 -> 16.6, Trop 0.07 -> 0.44 -> 1.39
-> 1.48. Clinically improved.
.

yesterday. Denies any chest pain/pressure, SOB, headache, any
other complaints at this time.
