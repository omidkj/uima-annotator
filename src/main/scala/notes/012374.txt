EKG: NSR, 95, NA/NI, TWI in v2-3
.
Imaging:
ECHO [**10-23**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 11-15mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. A mitral valve
annuloplasty ring is present. The gradient across the mitral
valve is higher than expected and suggests mitral stenosis
(probably related to a very small annular ring +/- pannus
ingrowth rather than leaflet stenosis). An eccentric, anterior
directed jet of mild to moderate ([**12-18**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

.
CXR:
Single bedside AP examination labeled "upright" is compared with

similar study dated [**2197-12-27**], as well as interval chest CT, dated
[**2199-11-5**]. There has been interval placement of bilateral
presumed intracranial electrodes, with leads extending beyond
the superior margin of the study. The patient is status post
median sternotomy with seven apparently intact sternal wires.
Though there has been no significant change in heart size there
is prominence of blurring of the central and hilar vessels, with
interstitial edema and bronchial coughing, suggestive of CHF.
There is no overt alveolar edema or pleural effusion. No focal
consolidation is seen.



Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 59 yo M w/ parkinsons disease s/p recent DBS placement, CHF
(EF 50-55% [**10-23**]), s/o mitral valvuloplasty, depression, sleep
disordered breathing p/w acute onset SOB.
.
# Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure:  The patient did
endorse dietary non- compliance over the month of [**Month (only) **] and
was recently in the operating room for placement of DBS when he
recieved fluids. He was intiailly put on NRB and then cpap and
received IV lasix.  His oxygen saturation improved and on the
floor he was confortable on room air.   The chest pressure he
noted was in setting of severe volume overload and shortness of
breath. No recurrent symptoms after diuresis. Last Stress in
[**2194**] was normal.  He was ruled out for an MI, but the patient
would benefit from a stress test as an out patient.

# Parkinson's disease: diagnosed 20 yr back. recently had DBS
placement, continued home meds
.
# Depression: continued zoloft
.
# Hyperlipidemia: continued crestor
