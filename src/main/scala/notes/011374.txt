Chief Complaint: BRBPR, AMS

Reason for MICU transfer: S/p Code Blue for PEA


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
History obtained from the medicine [**First Name3 (LF) **] note done the
morning of her transfer to the MICU since patient has baseline
dementia and is unable to give accurate hitory. This is a [**Age over 90 **]yoF
with history of Alzheimer's Disease, Afib (not on anti-coag),
CVA, recurrent GI bleeds, diverticulosis, recurrent and
resistant UTIs who presents with altered mental status and
dyspnea x2 days. Per HCP/nephew, patient had [**Name (NI) 19456**] symptoms
for approximately 7 days however over the last 2-3 days, he
noticed patient with increased fatigue, DOE and reduced PO
intake. On day of presentation, she mentioned to him that she
had BRB after having a bowel movement. He saw that there was
blood tracking down her leg and onto her sock and decided to
bring her to ED for evaluation.

In the ED, initial VS were: 97.2 85 105/58 20 98% ra. Exam was
significant for diffuse wheezing on lung exam and rectal exam w/
dark blood. Labs had several abnormalities including
hyperkalemia to 6.1, WBC to 11.4 and Plt 127. Lactate was 1.5.
CXR was showed pulmonary edema. UA was positive. EKG showed no
peaked Ts and normal QRS. Pt received 2L IVF and 2g cefepime as
well as calcium gluconate 2g. Patient was then admitted for
further evaluation. VS prior to transfer were 98.2 107 118/83 17
98%RA

She was admitted to the floor over night by night float and
patient reported feeling better however complained of feeling
thirsty. She had episodes of afib with RVR (to the 140s) which
was controlled with unknown doses of beta blocker. Also recieved
fluids for tachycardia in the low 100s. In addition, she was
given Kayexelate for hyperkalemia (peaked Ts) over night.
Started on Cefepime and Meropenem for her h/o
reccurent/resistant UTIs. At 11am on [**2118-10-25**], she was found to
be pulseless by ancillary staff, a code blue was announced.
Initial MD exam showed PEA. Eventually patient was noted to have
a HR in the 20s-30s and continued to be non-responsive. No blood
pressure obtained. She received <30 seconds of compressions. She
eventually had ROSC. There were also reports of a BM with brbpr
prior to the code. VS after resusciatation were HR 110s, BP
140s/80s, RR 10, 100 on NRB.

On arrival to the MICU, she is drowsy with baseline dementia.
Does not endorse any complaints of pain, chest pain, abdominal
pain, SOB, lightheadedness, dizziness. Denies any n/v. Poor
historian.

IMAGING:
CXR [**2118-10-24**]
IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes and mild pulmonary edema.
Cardiomegaly.  There appears to be blunting of the posterior
left costophrenic angle which may be due to a pleural effusion.

CXR [**2118-10-25**]
FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with
patient in
supine position.  Comparison is made to the most recent PA and
lateral chest examination of [**2118-10-24**].  Cardiomegaly as
before.  Generally widened and somewhat elongated thoracic aorta
with extensive wall calcifications, also unchanged.  Moderate
degree of perivascular haze is seen in the pulmonary circulation
consistent with mild degree of pulmonary congestion.  No
evidence of pleural effusion in the lateral pleural sinuses, and
no pneumothorax in the apical area.  In comparison with the
previous study, no new acute pulmonary infiltrate.  Telephone
contact with referring physician, [**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], was
established at 1:50 p.m. using telephone [**Numeric Identifier 19457**].  Telephone
contact with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] revealed that the patient had a
cardiac arrest during the latest examination interval, and CPR
was performed.  It can therefore be added on the portable chest
examination, single view in supine position, there is no
evidence of any rib fracture, pneumothorax, or other
abnormalities.

CXR [**2118-10-30**]
IMPRESSION:

1.  Slight interval reduction in lung volumes with appearance of
patchy
bibasilar opacities which likely reflect patchy atelectasis.  In
addition,
there is an interstitial process bilaterally, likely reflecting
interval
appearance of mild interstitial edema.  The heart remains
enlarged which may reflect cardiomegaly, although pericardial
effusion cannot be excluded.  Mediastinal contours are likely
stable given differences in patient positioning.  No
pneumothorax.  Probable small bilateral effusions.

CXR [**2118-10-31**]:
FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is
moderately
increasing evidence of pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural
effusions.
