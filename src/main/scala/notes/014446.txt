Compazine / Zosyn

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2195**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia, new diagnosis of congestive heart failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
D&E

History of Present Illness:
35F w/PMH SLE (followed at [**Hospital1 112**]) presenting initially to labor
and delivery 21 weeks pregnant with shortness of breath and mild
lower back pain.  She had recently been discharged after a
hospitalization for a lupus flare and was undergoing a steroid
taper due to increased edema and hypertension. She reports that
she had noted a 15 pound weight gain over one week and
difficulty lying flat, but denied ankle edema. She also endorsed
2d of dyspnea on exertion and 1d of lower back cramping. She
denied chest pain, fevers, chills, or known sick contacts.

At L&D triage, she was noted to be tachycardic to the 120-130
range, with oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. A chest x-ray
was completed that demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions,
cephalization of vessels, and enlarged heart, consistent with
CHF. Evaluation of the fetus demonstrated intra-uterine fetal
demise. Cardiology completed an urgent echocardiogram which
demonstrated a depressed ejection fraction of 30%.


Past Medical History:
- SLE: diagnosed in [**2168**], manifested by kidney disease
(membranous nephropathy by report of biopsy), facial rash,
Sjogren's syndrome, Raynaud's phenomenon, and pleuritis
- Gastritis
- Restrictive lung disease: followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], noted to
be moderate to severe on PFTs completed 5/[**2179**].
- History of pancytopenia associated with varicella zoster
infection
- History of persistent thrombocytopenia
- Baseline proteinuria (Cr 0.8-0.9 pre-pregnancy)


Social History:

accompanied at presentation by her husband [**Name (NI) **] and sister. She
denies tobacco or EtOH. This was her first pregnancy.

HEENT: NC/AT. No scleral icterus or conjunctival pallor. MMM.

IMAGING:
CXR ([**7-24**]): FINDINGS: The heart is mildly increased in size.
There are bilateral pleural effusions. There is hazy bilateral
vasculature with pulmonary vascular redistribution.
IMPRESSION: CHF.

TTE ([**7-24**]): Moderate global hypokinesis. Moderate mitral
regurgitation.

CT C spine [**2180-7-27**] Unremarkable study of the cervical spine.


Brief Hospital Course:
35 year old female with history of SLE and restrictive lung
disease presenting with new-onset systolic CHF and intra-uterine
fetal demise.

1. Shortness of breath:
Patient was found to have a new diagnosis of systolic heart
failure with EF 30% and BNP=55,060. Differential diagnosis
includes lupus myocarditis, peripartum cardiomyopathy, or acute
decrease in ejection fraction in the setting of critical
illness. Pt was seen in consultation by cardiology and was
started on a beta blocker, which was titrated up to Toprol 50mg
PO qAM, and she is being sent home on Lasix 40mg PO Daily. ACE-I
was not added given borderline-low blood pressures. Her
discharge weight is 156.8 pounds. She will follow-up in the
Heart Failure Clinic.

2. Fetal demise:
Patient underwent D&E under general anesthesia without
complication. Social support was provided by social work.

3. SLE:
Patient is followed by rheumatoloy at [**Hospital1 112**], and was seen by the
inpatient rheumatology consult team. She was started on stress
dose steroids in preparation for her D+E, and these were
decreased to Prednisone 60mg PO daily on discharge with plans
for outpatient follow-up to determine an appropriate taper.
Imuran was stopped on [**2180-8-1**], and Cellcept was started on
[**2180-8-2**]. She has a follow-up appointment at [**Hospital1 112**] on [**2180-8-10**] at
9:00 a.m.

4. Thrombocytopenia:
Likely [**12-20**] SLE. Platelet count was stable during this hospital
stay.

5. Anemia: Likely [**12-20**] anemia of chronic disease secondary to
SLE, blood loss during D&E, and a physiologic anemia of
pregnancy. Her Hct has remained stable at 26.

6. Acute Renal Failure:
Pt's creatinine peaked at 1.2, from a baseline of 0.9, likely
due to poor forward flow in the setting of CHF, although
worsening lupus nephritis could not be ruled out. Her creatinine
was stable at 1.0-1.1 for several days prior to discharge.
Follow-up with nephrology was scheduled for [**8-22**], which
was the earliest available appointment.

7. Diarrhea:
Patient experienced several episodes of loose stools during this
hospitalization. C.Diff was sent and negative. Patient feels
this is due to her Metoprolol, but understands the importance of
this medication.
