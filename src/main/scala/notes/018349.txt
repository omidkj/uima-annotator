Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2641**]
Chief Complaint:
hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy (x2)

History of Present Illness:
79 y.o male with hx of severe COPD recently treated at [**Hospital 40576**] for SBO and LLL pneumonia, discharged on [**9-14**],
returned on [**9-15**] to ED with hemoptysis, was treated in ED for
pneumonia with Tequin and discharged home. On [**9-19**] pt had
another episode of hemoptysis at home associated with syncope.
Admitted again to [**Hospital6 302**], intubated, CT showed
cavitation on the L side and b/l pneumothoracies R>L,
pneumomediastinum, L pleural effusion and evidence of aspiration
on right.  B/L chest tube placed and bronchoscopy was performed
which showed b/l lower lobe bleeding.  On [**9-20**] patient
trasferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of hemoptysis with
possible endobronchial ablative therapy.

Past Medical History:
PMH:
COPD with FEV1 1.4
Lipomas, several removed "many years ago"
SBO
Colon polyps, s/p L colectomy.
glaucoma
Cholecystecomy


Social History:
Lives with wife. Former [**Name2 (NI) 1818**] for 30 years, but quit 18 years
ago.

Family History:
Father with liver cancer.
Mother with cancer- unknown.

Physical Exam:
Tm: 97.1, Tc:97.0, BP: 109-160/31-62, P: 58-79, RR: 21(17-26),
O2: 90% on 4l nc
Gen: NAD, AAOx3
HEENT: perrla, eomi, mmm
Neck: no jvd, no lad
Chest: rrr, nl s1s2, no m/r/g
Lungs: Bronchial breath sounds throughout, rales at Left lower
lung field
Abd: soft, nt, nd, normal bowel sounds
Extremities: multiple soft/firm/mobile/nontender/subcutaneous
nodules at forearm b/l, UE with non pitting edema r>l, LE with
edematous knees, edematous feet, 2+ peripheral pulses.
Back: multiple subcutaneous nodules as described above


Pertinent Results:
CT chest/abd/pelvis-IMPRESSION:

1. Bilateral lower lobe consolidation with possible cavitation
on the left. On the right, there is obstruction of the right
lower lobe bronchus with appearance suggesting possible hilar
mass surrounding this bronchus.
2. Large left sided pleural effusion with component of
loculation.
3. Right sided pneumothorax and right chest wall dissecting
subcutaneous air. Dissection of air is likely the explanation
for free air seen in the intraperitoneal space within the
abdomen.
4. Multiple cystic lesions of the pancreas. Findings may relate
ot diffuse IPMT. Further evaluation with MRCP could be
performed.
5. 5.1 x 6.5 cm well delineated cystic lesion in the left upper
quadrant.
this may represent a exophytic renal cyst, peritoneal inclusion
cyst from prior surgery, another pancreatic cyst, or possibly a
duplication cyst.

Brief Hospital Course:
Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] pt had bronchoscopy which revealed clot
in anterior segment RUL. Blood clot was removed and BAL gram
stains and cultures negative. Shortly after procedure pt had
recurrent hemoptysis and was transferred to MICU. Pt was
evaluated and found to have a cavitating pneumonia along with
likely superimposed aspiration pneumonia.  He was continued on
Zosyn started at OSH and Vancomycin was started secondary to
spike following intervention of Bronch. On [**9-22**] a second
bronchoscopy was performed, multiple clots and fresh blood was
found which resolved with flushing. Both brochoscopies
determined the most likely bleeding site to be the bronchial
artery of the RUL. Pt arrived to [**Hospital1 18**] with b/l pneumothoracies,
which are resolving though a small right loculated pocket
remains.  Chest tube was removed [**9-22**]. Pt was extubated [**9-23**] and
was saturating 95% on 2l NC on transfer to floor.  While in the
MICU required minimal blood support with 2 u PRBC and fluid
boluses to bring up blood pressure.  Also c/b episode of
hypertension to 160's treated with hydralazine. Upon transfer to
floor all cultures were obtained, without a single positive
bacterial culture noted.  Vancomycin was discontinued.  Pt
required IV fluids to resolve orthostatic hypotension.  Pt was
noted on several occasions, particularly at night, to desaturate
to approximately 83-86% for a matter of minutes.  At these times
he responded to suction and nebulizers, and it is felt that
these episode are due to mucous plugging. He was started on
guafenesin to treat this.  Towards the end of hospitalization,
interventional pulmonary performed a thoracentesis and was able
to drain 1400cc of serosangiunous fluid.  The gram stain and
fluid analysis are not suggestive of empyema, but this fluid is
exudative and due to higher than normal ,ynphocyte % could be
related to lymphoma, therefore it will be absolutely essential
to follow cytology from this fluid which is currently pending.
He will be discharged to rehabilitation for physical therapy and
to complete a 14 day course of Zosyn.  As on out patient it will
be essential to work up incidental finding, CT abd showed
retroperitoneal air and a 7x5 cm soft tissue mass.
