Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 66-year-old
male transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital after ruling in for a
non-Q wave myocardial infarction.  He presented on [**2173-4-13**]
when he developed significant shortness of breath at rest as
well as a pressure-like chest pain.  He had nausea but no
vomiting or diaphoresis.  EMS was called and reported an O2
saturation of 86% and ST elevation in leads 2 and 4.  At the
[**Hospital1 1474**] emergency room the patient was noted to be in
congestive heart failure.  He was treated with Lasix and O2.
The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 1474**] where further work-up
revealed increased BUN and creatinine of 6.6, creatinine
clearance calculated at 11.  Renal ultrasound was reported as
normal.  Echocardiogram reported an ejection fraction of
15-20% down from 60% in [**9-14**], severe diffuse left
ventricular hypokinesis and akinesis noted, one episode of
supraventricular tachycardia to the 160s only symptomatic
with palpitations.  The patient was treated with Lopressor.
Also hematocrit on admission was 26.  The patient was
transfused several units of packed red blood cells.  He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
catheterization which showed severe two-vessel disease
including left main.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Prostate cancer 12-13 years.  2.
Diabetes mellitus x 10 years, insulin x 5 years.  3. Chronic
renal failure.  4. Transient ischemic attack.  5. Right
carotid stent.  6. Hypercholesterolemia.  7. Hypertension.

HOME MEDICATIONS:  1. Accupril.  2. Diltiazem.  3. Aspirin.
4. Imdur.  5. Hydralazine.  6. Plavix.  7. Tylenol.  8.
Lasix.  9. Lopressor.  10. Flutamide.  11. Lupron.  12.
Insulin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient quit smoking cigarettes three
years ago, smoked one pack per day x 30 years.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98, heart rate 57, blood
pressure 148/70, respiratory rate 18, 92% on room air.  In
general the patient was in no acute distress.  He was alert
and oriented x 3.  HEENT:  Pupils were equal, round, and
reactive to light.  Extraocular movements were intact.
Oropharynx was clear.  Neck:  Supple, no jugular venous
distension no bruits.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm, no
murmurs, gallops, or rubs.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation
anteriorly.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended,
positive bowel sounds, no masses or bruits.  Extremities:  No
cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  Vascular examination showed 2+
radial and carotid bilaterally, dopplerable dorsalis pedis
and posterior tibial pulses.  Neurologic:  Intact.

Catheterization showed PAP 30/14, left main 70%, proximal LAD
50%, mid LAD 40%, distal LAD diffuse disease, diagonals 1 and
2 diffuse disease, proximal RCA 20% at the distal end, mid
RCA 20%, right posterior LAD 90%, proximal circumflex 99%,
mid circumflex 100%.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital on
[**2173-4-19**] and initially treated by the medical team.  He was
treated with aspirin and Lopressor.  His ACE inhibitor was
held.  The patient was seen by the renal team who assisted
him in obtaining dialysis.

The patient was also seen by the cardiology service who
recommended coronary artery bypass grafting.  The patient had
a PermCath placed for dialysis.

On [**2173-4-22**] the patient was taken to the operating room where
coronary artery bypass grafting was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**].  After the procedure the patient required
propofol, milrinone, Levophed and insulin drip.  He had chest
tubes and pacing wires in place.  He was transferred to the
cardiothoracic intensive care unit where his postoperative
period was complicated by atrial fibrillation and ventricular
tachycardia for which the patient received amiodarone.  The
patient was later also started on isosorbide and Lopressor.
At the appropriate times the patient's chest tubes and pacing
wires were removed.  Once the patient was stable he was
transferred from the intensive care unit to the regular
cardiothoracic floor where he continued to do well.  He was
seen by physical therapy who indicated that the patient would
probably benefit from a period of time in a rehabilitation
center post discharge.  He was also seen by electrophysiology
who requested an echocardiogram be performed and
signal-averaged electrocardiograms.  The echocardiogram
showed an ejection fraction of 25-30%.

The patient had difficulty with his voiding trial.  He
repeatedly had to be recatheterized probably secondary to his
history of prostate cancer.  He was started on Flomax.

It is now [**2173-4-29**] and the patient is being discharged to
rehabilitation in good condition.  He should avoid strenuous
activity.  He should not drive until he is off pain
medications.  The patient may shower but should not take
baths.  He should follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**] in six
weeks.  He should also follow up with his primary care
physician, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 518**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6700**], [**Name Initial (NameIs) **].D. and his cardiologist,
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4468**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], M.D.
