History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 78 year old RHM with hx of HTN, TIA/stroke on
aspirin transferred from [**Hospital6 204**] after MRI
showing acute bilateral cerebellar infarct.  Patient reports
that
he was having increased phlegm and coughing for 5 days; 2 days
ago, he stood up to go to the bathroom when he suddenly felt

problems.  His wife called for EMS and he was taken to [**Hospital6 39031**].

Patient reports that he developed pressure, squeezing type of
headache at the back of his head while at [**Hospital1 189**] but no
radiation.  He continued to feel nauseated and vomited x1.  He
also reports lightheadedness but only with movement.  He was
found to have bronchitis hence was started on Zithromax and
Rocephin and with MRI showing acute, bilateral cerebellar
infarct
but normal MRA, he was transferred here for further care and
treatment.

Currently, patient denies any nausea, lightheadedness or
diplopia
but does report that he still feels lightheaded with movement.

As for ROS, he denies any chest pain, palpitations, fever,
urinary or bowel symptoms or recent medication change.  He was
recently diagnosed with Parkinson's dz for bradykinesia and L

Additionally, patient reports having tried Plavix in the past
but

ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect
or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast with maneuvers. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
70%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There
is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.  :02AM BLOOD Triglyc-75 HDL-49

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the neurology service for further evaluation
and management of his cerebellar infarcts.  He was initially
admitted to the Neuro-ICU for close monitoring.  He was
monitored with cardiac telemetry and frequent neuro checks.  He
was started on aggrenox since the stroke occured while on
aspirin.  PT/OT were consulted.  TTE was unremarkable and a TEE
was done on [**1-23**] to further look for source of emboli.  The TEE
also did not show any potential source.  He developed diarrhea
and a c. dif toxin was sent.  He has otherwise been doing well.
