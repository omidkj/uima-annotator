Service:  [**Doctor Last Name **] Medicine

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 84-year-old
female with a history of dementia, alert and oriented x 1 at
baseline, hypertension, diabetes, and cerebrovascular
accident.  Per her daughter she has been having shortness of
breath for approximately one month.  The patient's family
reports that four to six weeks ago the patient was diagnosed
with pneumonia and was treated with levofloxacin and upon
completion of the Levaquin, she still was complaining of
shortness of breath, and chest pain with cough.  Another
chest x-ray was obtained and pneumonia was still suspected
and she was treated with another secondary course of
levofloxacin.  She still did not improve.  Chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease was postulated or asthma.  The
family was unclear, and she was started on nebulizers and
inhaled steroids.  However she continued to have shortness of
breath during the week prior to admission and she required
two liters of O2 by nasal cannula.  The patient's daughter
also reported that she had decreased appetite and was still
complaining of shortness of breath when she came to the [**Hospital1 1444**] Emergency Department for
work-up.  At [**Hospital1 **] the patient had a chest CT that revealed a
large filling defect at the bifurcation of the right main
pulmonary artery.  There were also noted to be filling
defects noted within the pulmonary artery supplying the right
upper lobe and left upper lobe suggestive of pulmonary
embolism.  Also noted on the CT scan was extensive
mediastinal adenopathy including at the AP window,
subcarinal, paratracheal, and bilateral hila.  There was no
significant axillary adenopathy.  There was also mild
narrowing of the left main bronchus.  They also commented
that the right main bronchus appeared moderately narrowed
with partial collapse of the right middle lobe.  Lung window
images also demonstrated extensive emphysematous changes
bilaterally and a large bulla noted in the right mid lung
zone posteriorly.  There was no significant pericardial or
pleural effusion, and there were no noted pulmonary masses or
nodules.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She came to the U.S. in [**2093**].  She denies
any current ethanol use.  The patient has an unknown smoking
history.  She has been at the [**Hospital **] Health Center Nursing
Home since [**2147-6-25**].  She previously lived with her
daughter.  She is Ukranian speaking, and her daughters
communicate for her.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination she was a pleasant and
alert but quite dyspneic elderly woman with a face mask.  Her
blood pressure was 150s to 160s/90s, pulse 110, respiratory
rate 28-32, oxygen saturations were 92% on room air but then
improved to 98% on three liters.  Pertinent findings on
examination showed diffuse wheezes throughout heard on lung
examination.  Heart was tachycardic with no murmurs, gallops,
or rubs.  Breast examination revealed no palpable masses.
Extremities showed trace edema.  There was no palpable cord
or calf pain.

LABORATORY DATA:  On 10 liters face mask the patient had an
arterial blood gas of 7.34, 49, and 161.  EKG showed normal
sinus rhythm at 90 with small Q's in 2, 3, and F, and poor
wave progression noted.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] given
the size of her PE as well as the patient carried other
comorbidities.  She was started on IV heparin drip as well as
Coumadin.  She was continued on Atrovent and Ventolin
nebulizers.  She had a rather uneventful [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course.  She
was also started on morphine sulfate p.r.n. for dyspnea as
well as fentanyl nebulizers p.r.n.  She was also started on a
trial of Solu-Medrol for a possible reactive component to her
pulmonary disease.  She was transferred back to the [**Hospital Ward Name 12053**] on [**2147-10-1**] for a bronchoscopy and possible stenting
to palliate some of her symptoms.  She had this procedure on
[**2147-10-2**].  This revealed numerous black plaques in the right
main segmental bronchus as well as the left main segmental
bronchus.  These were sent for biopsies, washings, and
brushings.  The impression of the pulmonary team was that
this could be a possible metastatic melanoma.  After the
procedure the patient was continued on her Atrovent and
albuterol nebulizers as well as IV methylprednisolone.  She
was also continued on p.r.n. morphine for respiratory
distress.

In terms of her other medical issues for her hypertension,
she was continued on Norvasc.  For her diabetes she was
continued on her oral agents and put on a Regular Insulin
sliding scale for her hypothyroidism.  She was continued on
her outpatient dose of thyroid hormone.  For her history of
stroke she was continued on Plavix.  For prophylaxis she was
continued on a proton pump inhibitor.
