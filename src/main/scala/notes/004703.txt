Chief Complaint:
dizziness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Resuscitation

History of Present Illness:
88yo man with PMH significant for HTN and prostate cancer
presents with approximately one year of "dizziness." He notes
this began approx 1 yr ago after a gallbladder operation at
[**Hospital3 **]. Since then, he has had an extensive workup,
including MRI/MRAs x 2, which has shown that he has had a stroke
in the past. He does not know of any other findings. He comes to
the hospital today because it has been progressive over the last
year and his daughter finally brought him to the hospital. He
reports increasing difficulty walking, though he lives by
himself, and is still able to get around his house while holding
on to objects in his home. He describes his dizziness as a
"heaviness" in his head that occurs mostly upon standing up,
though it can occur when lying in bed with change in position.
He always has this feeling when standing. He reports associated
nausea, no vomiting. Denies vertigo (any sense of spinning).
Denies loss of consciousness. He also reports two episodes that
he describes as "seizures." These also occurred upon standing,
and he described them as a feeling that "somebody takes your
head and shakes it up and goes crazy." They last for
approximately five minutes and are associated with weakness.
Once he fell on the bed, once he sat down on a bench and they
resolved. Neither were associated with bowel or bladder
incontinence or loss of consciousness. It is unclear if they
were associated with confusion after the episode, but the
patient was able to get home from the park. ROS is significant
for hearing loss in his right ear x years. Denies vomiting,
headache, cough, URI sx, palpitations.

Admission EKG:
Normal sinus rhythm, rate 93. No diagnostic abnormality. No
previous tracing available for comparison.

Admission CXR:
1. No evidence of consolidation.
2. Bilateral symmetric increased interstitial opacities with
bilateral septal lines. Statistically this is most likely due to
interstitial pulmonary edema. Nevertheless the heart is of
normal size and there are no pleural effusions. If this findings
persist after diuresis, other causes of interstitial lung
disease should be considered and high resolution CT of the chest
should be performed.

L knee xray: Advanced medial osteoarthritis of the left knee and
small joint effusion.

BLE u/s: There is extensive acute intraluminal occlusive
thrombus involving the deep veins of the left side extending
from the below-knee tibial veins to the level of and involving
the common femoral vein. Within the posterior aspect of the knee
there is also identified a 3.6 x 2.5 cystic structure which
contains intraluminal echogenic material, which has the
morphology of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4675**] cyst. This is non-vascular and is not
thought to represent a vascular lesion.The intracystic echogenic
material probably represents fibrinous debris and/or clot. The
deep veins of the right groin appear compressible with normal
augmentation and respiratory variation. A small amount of
circumferential thickening on the right side may represent
recanalization from the previous DVT.The remainder of the right
leg is not examined.
CONCLUSION:
1. Extensive deep venous thrombosis on left side.
2. Complicated [**Hospital Ward Name 4675**] cyst, left popliteal fossa.
3. Possible chronic nonocclusive recanalized thrombosis of right
SFV.

Renal u/s: The right kidney measures 10.3 cm. The left kidney
measures 10.3 cm. There is no hydronephrosis or stones. The
bladder is normal in appearance, without any evidences of wall
thickening. The prostate appears enlarged.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 88 yo man with HTN, prostate ca w/ poss mets to bone,
previous CVA, here for dizziness after extensive outpt workup
with unknown findings. He was found to have an extensive DVT on
his second hospital day, [**12-19**], and was receiving
anticoagulation and further evaluation for dizziness when on the
night of [**12-20**] he went into PEA arrest, was recusitated by the
code team, and transferred to MICU. There goals of care were
made to be comfort measures only, and all other care was
withdrawn.

Hospital course is reviewed below by problem:

1. PEA arrest: This was thought to be most likely secondary to a
PE, given his known extensive DVT. He was resuscitated on four
pressors, and weaned to two in the MICU. However, he remained
unresponsive with questionable hope for improvement. His family
decided that he would not want to remain in the state in which
he was, and they requested that the goals of care be comfort
measures only. All other treatment was withdrawn.

2. Dizziness: Differential diagnosis included central,
peripheral, and cardiogenic etiologies. Suspected peripheral
causes included BPPV or vestibular neuritis possibly from
vertebrobasilar insufficiency. Pt had intermittent rotational
nystagmus.

Central etiologies were also considered and included: a) mets to
the brain from metastatic prostate cancer; b) spinal involvement
from prostate cancer; c) new brain infarcts from additional,
perhaps "silent" CVAs; d) processes affecting the vestibular
nerve, such as schwannomas, although pt did not report tinnitus
or other findings characteristic for acoustic neuromas. MRI/MRAs
of the head and spine were ordered and both oncology and
neurology were following.

Cardiogenic causes for pt's dizziness seemed less likely. Pt was
on telemetry but had no telemetry events despite continued
episodes of dizziness. He also had normal EKG findings, no
cardiac/pulmonary symptoms, and no hx of palpitations,
arrhythmias, or heart disease.

Additionally, the pt had other causes contributing to gait
instability and increased fall risk. He had impaired function in
righ foot, significant right sided leg atrophy, and impairment
of dynamic motion from c
