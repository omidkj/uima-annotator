Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6195**]
Chief Complaint:
Hip fracture

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Open reduction/internal fixation [**3-24**]

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with COPD on 2L O2 at
baseline, who presented s/p fall on [**3-22**] onto her R side when
going from chair to walker.  She denies any LOC or head injury
at the time, and fall was purely mechanical.  She was seen by
cardiology for pre-op evaluation; she has no known history of
CAD, but does have very low functional capacity.  Given the
necesity of doing the surgery earlier rather than later, defered
cath and proceeded to surgery on [**3-24**], ORIF.

Past Medical History:
COPD, on home O2, 2L at baseline.
Anxiety
Anemia (33.6 on admission here, unclear etiology, no outside
records).

Social History:
Denies smoking, alcohol, or drug use.  She lives at home with
her daughter.

Family History:
Unable to obtain.

Physical Exam:
VS:  98.6, 120/60, 87, 16, 98% on 2L
Gen: Slim, frail appearing elderly caucasian female, resting
comfortably in bed.
MS:  Alert and oriented to person but not time.
Neck: No JVD.
CVS: RR, normal rate, 3/6 systolic murmur heard best at apex,
with rad to axilla.
Lungs: Rales at L base.
Abd: NABS, soft, NT/ND.
Extr: R thigh with dressing c/d/i.  DP palpable on L but not R,
however feet warm b/l with good capillary refill.  No c/c/e.
Venodynes in place.


Pertinent Results:
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is a complex
intertrochanteric fracture through the right femur. The distal
fracture fragment is medially angulated and externally rotated.
The lesser trochanter has been fractured. The neck of the femur
and the head appear to be intact. There is soft tissue edema in
the region surrounding the fracture. Note is made of a 2.2 x 2.4
cm radiopaque gallstone in the gallbladder. There are extensive
calcifications of the aorta and iliac arteries. The imaged loops
of bowel are unremarkable, given the limited nature of the
study. The left hip appears to be within normal limits. A Foley
catheter is seen in the bladder.

THREE VIEWS OF THE RIGHT KNEE WITH ONE ADDITIONAL VIEW OF THE
RIGHT LEG: There is no evidence of acute fracture. The joint
spaces are preserved. No definite knee effusion identified.
Vascular calcifications are noted.

EKG [**3-23**]:
Sinus rhythm
First degree A-V block
Probable septal infarct - age undetermined
Possible left atrial enlargement
No previous tracing

CXR [**3-23**]:  AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: IMPRESSION:
1. Biapical scarring.
2. Abnormal contour at the left paraspinal region near the
diaphragm that cannot be entirely separated from the aorta. This
may represent an atypically laterally positioned hiatal hernia,
but saccular aortic aneurysm is not excluded. Dedicated PA and
Lateral views of the chest are recommended when the patient is
clinically capable for further characterization. Alternatively,
CT could be obtained.
3. No radiographic evidence of pneumonia or overt CHF.

EKG [**3-24**]:  Sinus tachycardia. First degree atrio-ventricular
conduction delay.  P-R interval 0.24. Cannot exclude prior
anterior myocardial infarction. Possible inferior myocardial
infarction. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2154-3-23**] multiple
abnormalities as previously noted persist without major change.

CXR [**3-25**]:  IMPRESSION:
Rounded opacity in the retrocardiac region which appears
contiguous with the heart and probably represents a left
ventricular aneurysm. This does not clearly appear to be
associated with the descending thoracic aorta. A CT scan is
recommended for further evaluation.

HIP PA and LAT [**3-26**]:  IMPRESSION: Status post ORIF right
intertrochanteric fracture in overall anatomic alignment.
Evidence for impaction at the fracture line, with backing out of
the screw, as described. No hardware loosening.

CT HEAD [**3-26**]:  IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial
hemorrhage or infarct on this limited study. MRI with
diffusion-weighted imaging is more sensitive to evaluate for an
acute infarct.

CT CHEST [**3-26**]:  IMPRESSION:
1. Distension and filling of the esophagus with debris is
present. This is associated with a probable hiatal hernia.
Clinical correlation is required for further interpretation.
Given the history of aspiration, evaluation by upper GI series
may be useful after evacuation of the debris within the
esophagus for further characterization of the anatomic course of
the esophagus and stomach.
2. Multiple pulmonary opacities primarily peripherally. Images
are most consistent with the provided history of aspiration.
Follow-up examination after appropriate treatment is
recommended.
3. Coronary artery and aortic calcifications.

Transthoracic echo [**3-26**]:  Conclusions:
1. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is a mild resting left
ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
2. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate MAC and thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course from [**Date range (1) 46466**]

Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female on 2L home O2 for COPD, with
low functional capacity, who presented with R intertrochanteric
femoral fracture, had an ORIF on [**3-24**], post-op course
complicated by transient tachycardia and hypoxia necessitating
transfer to medicine service, as well as aspiration pneumonia
and dysphagia, and a UTI.

1) Hip fracture:  The patient had an ORIF on [**3-24**], with
estimated blood loss of 200 cc.  She received 800 cc IVF, and
her post-op hct was found to be 28.7 (down from 33) therefore
she was transfused 1 UPRBC and her hematocrit subsequently
remained stable.  Post operatively, however, she was noted to
have a sinus tachycardia of 110-120, with stable blood pressure.
 Her oxygen requirement was also slightly above baseline at 3L.
She was therefore transfered to the medicine service (from
orthopedics).

2)  Tachycardia:  Her post-operative tachycardia was sinus, and
transient, resolving within a day.  However, while on ortho
service, cardiology was called and a rule out MI was performed,
with negative cardiac enzymes.  She was monitored on tele
without events.  She was started on metoprolol 5 mg IV Q 6 hours
(couldn't take PO meds - see below), and her heart rate remained
in the 70s and 80s for the remainder of the hospitalization.
Her brief post-operative tachycardia was likely related to her
anemia, anxiety, and post-operative state with pain.

3) Hypoxia:  She was never far from her baseline of 98% on 2L.
It is felt that her brief hypoxia was likely related to mild
fluid overload from IVF received in surgery and PRBCs, as well
as an underlying aspiration pneumonia (see below).  She was
started on levaquin and gently diuresed, with improvement back
to baseline of 2 L within a day.  She was given atrovent NEBs
intermittently as well for her COPD.

4) UTI:  As above, post-operatively she was found to have a UTI.
 Levaquin started [**3-25**] for a planned 5 da
