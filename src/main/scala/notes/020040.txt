History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness:
81M chronic AF, CHF, bullous pemphigoid, h/o SBOs, recently
admitted for urosepsis, here w/ Afib RVR and pleuritic chest
pain. Was recently admitted to [**Hospital6 **] with
urosepsis [**Date range (1) 107270**] w/ acute renal failure in the setting of
this, further complicated by LLL pneumonia - unclear if patient
was ventilated, but did have a R subclavian placed. Received
azithro/ceftriaxone for the pneumonia w/ improvement. Discharged
[**3-30**] with plans for outpt continuation of ceftriaxone for an
addition 4 days (suggesting PNA was dx ~[**3-27**]).
.
Following discharge, continued complaining of cough productive
of yellowish sputum, then on day of admission developed
pleuritic chest pain on L. On transfer from NH to [**Hospital1 392**] was
noted to be in Afib/RVR and was given Dilt 18mg bolus w/ good
effect by EMS (notes pulse of 190, BP 90/palp, but strip shows
~150-160). HR improved to 100-104, SBP 100.
.
At OSH, 129 93/46 24 99%NRB on arrival, started dilt 5mg push,
then 2.5mg gtt, given 1g ceftaz and 60mg lovenox @ 0351.
Transferred for addition care at [**Hospital1 18**]. On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ER,
99.2 56 91/57. Dilt gtt stopped when BP to 83/54, BP to
90s-100s, HR continued to be in low 100s.
.
On arrival to MICU, 96.2 120 103/65 16 98% 4LNC. Given 10mg IV
dilt push, then started on 5/hr gtt.
.
MICU Course: Afib rate was controlled with dilt gtt then
switched to po and rate is now in the 80s.  He was placed on
Vanc/Zosyn for Hosp-Acquired PNA + UTI.  WBC count has come down
and is now afebrile.  Was placed on metronidazole for + cdiff
cx.  Was initially hypotensive likely [**1-20**] dilt but BP now
stable.

[**4-3**] Renal U/S
The right kidney measures 8.9 cm and the left kidney measures
9.5 cm.  There is no hydronephrosis in either kidney.  There are
multiple anechoic lesions bilaterally, consistent with
appearance of simple cyst.  There is no evidence of masses or
calculi.  The examination is limited to patient's inability to
cooperate.  Urinary bladder is collapsed around the Foley
catheter.

IMPRESSION:  No evidence of hydronephrosis.
Bilateral renal cysts.
.
[**4-3**] CXR
One view.  Comparison with the previous study done [**2158-4-1**].
Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates persist.  There is increased
density at the lung bases consistent with small pleural
effusions as well.  Compared with the previous study,
interstitial markings in the right upper lung are more apparent.
 The heart and mediastinal structures are unchanged.  A central
venous catheter remains in place.

IMPRESSION:  Persistent bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and
pleural effusions. Development of increased interstitial
markings, which may represent developing edema.
.
[**4-4**] ECHO
Conclusions:  EF 45-50%
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity  size are normal. There is mild (non-obstructive)
focal hypertrophy of the basal septum. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**12-20**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve  leaflets are mildly thickened.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.  There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
[**4-6**] MRI Brain
FINDINGS: There are multiple small regions of signal loss within
the atrophy cerebellar vermis, best appreciated on the sagittal
T1-weighted sequence, raising a suspicion for enlarged vessels
that may signal a vermian AVM. No clear enlarged feeding artery
or draining vein, however, are identified. In addition, there is
notable linear susceptibility artifact in the subarachnoid
spaces surrounding both cerebellar hemispheres, brainstem, and
supratentorial brain. This finding most likely represents
siderosis secondary to repeated subarachnoid hemorrhage, perhaps
from the proposed vermian AVM.

There are extensive focal and confluent T2 hyperintensities in
the subcortical and periventricular white matter of both
cerebral hemispheres, brainstem, and the cerebellar hemisphere,
representing chronic microvascular ischemia. Around CSF signal
structure of 8-mm in the region of the left basal ganglia,
probably represents a dilated perivascular space. There is
approximately 3.5 x 4.2 x 3.5 cm arachnoid cyst in the posterior
fossa to the left of midline. Severe generalized atrophy is
present. There is no acute infarct, shift of midline structures,
or hydrocephalus. Major vascular flow voids are preserved.

There is a 2.0 x 2.5 x 0.8 cm low T1/high T2 signal lesion
within the occipital bone in the midline, at the level of the
skull base, which likely represents an epidermoid. there is
likely a mucus retention cyst in the right maxillary sinus.
There is mucosal thickening in bilateral ethmoid air cells.

IMPRESSION:
1. No acute infarct.
2. Findings concerning for vermian AVM and superficial
siderosis, secondary to repeated hemorrhages from it. But,
evaluation with MRA would be achieved.
3. Extensive chronic small vessel ischemic change in the supra
and infratentorial white matter.
4. Severe generalized atrophy.
5. Arachnoid cyst in the posterior fossa.
6. Likely small occipital bone epidermoid, w
