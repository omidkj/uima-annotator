Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 19193**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
80 year old male with h/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-body dementia, moderate AS (area
1-1.2cm2), CHF (diastolic likely with EF > 70% on ECHO from
[**2104**]), with a known pericardial effusion without evidence of
tamponade approximately 1 month prior, presenting with altered
mental status and hypotension. Per report, the patient was last
noted to be normal at 9 AM with BP 108/72, P72, T 97. Found at
12:30pm to have increased confusion, decreased ability to follow
commands, and hypotensive to 80/40, T 96.8 similar to prior
infections. Per nursing home, no fevers or chills, no nausea,
vomiting or diarrhea, no complaints of dysuria or foul-smelling
urine, no abdominal pain, no noticeable shortness of breath, no
cough, no chest pain, no complaints of headache or change in
vision or neck stiffness. glucose 191.

In the ED, initial vs were: 81 97/54 16 100%. Ultrasound showed
pericardial effusion with RV collapse. Cards was consulted, who
felt that there was no tamponade physiology, but rather that the
hyperdynamic LV was suggestive of volume depletion. Renal was
consulted. Patient was given 3L IV fluids with improvement in
his pressures, and Zosyn b/c of concern for UA. Trop 0.39, no
ECG changes, rectal ASA given. Cr 3.8 from baseline 1.7 to 2.
Vitals prior to transfer were 98.6PR, 99, 100/36, 18, 100% on
2L.

On the floor, patient is minimally verbal. His son notes that he
now eats and drinks very little because many days he is
non-verbal and is not interested in food. Other days he is more
interactive and seems lucid. He has had a rapid decline in
mental status over the last few months and [**Last Name (un) 309**]-Body dementia
has been a recent diagnosis. He has skin breakdown on his
buttocs, posterior heels. He is unable to provide a ROS.

Past Medical History:
- h/o paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, not on coumadin due to
fall risk
- Diastolic heart failure. Echo in [**5-/2105**] showed a small left
ventricle cavity and septal wall thickness was 15-18 mm.
- Aortic stenosis.  Echo in [**5-/2105**] showed aortic valve stenosis
with a valve area of 1.0 cm2. Despite meeting some criteria for
surgery, patient was not judged a surgical candidate.

210. .

bactrim. Most recent UTI was a month ago. He was treated w abx.

- Colon cancer s/p resection in [**2102**] with primary anastamosis.
No XRT/chemotherapy

STUDIES:
[**2108-10-4**] ECHO:
The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). A mid-cavitary gradient is identified.
Significant aortic stenosis is present (not quantified). No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen
(within normal limits). The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is a small to moderate sized
pericardial effusion. The effusion is echo dense, consistent
with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements. There are
no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2108-8-15**],
the left ventricular cavity size is smaller. Overall systolic
function is hyperdynamic. As a result a mid cavitary gradient is
present. The pericardial effusion may be slightly increased in
size.

[**2108-10-4**] CT head:
No acute intracranial process.

[**2108-10-4**] CXR:
Patient rotated to the left and skinfold overlies the chest. The
patient's
chin partially obscures the left lung apex. Low lung volumes. No
focal
consolidation. No large pleural effusion, although it would be
difficult to exclude small effusion.
