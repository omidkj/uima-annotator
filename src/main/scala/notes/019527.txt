History of Present Illness:
75 yo male with h/o CAD s/p MI x3, MDS, CHF (EF 40%), HTN,
chronic AFib (off coumadin), chronic GI bleed x 1 year who
presented with fatigue, admitted for GI bleed.  Guaiac positive
for one year; requiring chronic blood transfusions in the
setting of MDS.  Received 5 units of blood [**2187-1-17**].  Just had
endoscopy on Monday at OSH (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7493**]
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 54080**]); per report, EGD was negative.  He was found to
have a hct 17.8 on [**1-30**] at Hematologist's office.  He reports
that his hematologist advised him to go home with the hopes that
the Hct could be checked again later to see if he would retic on
his own.  Has had continued dark stools and felt fatigue and
DOE, so he presented today to [**Hospital1 18**].  No dizziness or
lightheadedness.  No chest pain.  Has chronic bandlike pain
around abdomen (X 6 months).  No ASA, coumadin, plavix, NSAIDs.

In the ED, vitals revealed T 97.1  BP 87/39  HR 75  RR 18  SpO2
100% on 2L NC.  Hct in the ED was 17.5.  His pressure
transiently dipped to 80s systolic but responded to IVF.  He
received 1L NS and 1u pRBCs.  NG lavage was not performed.  GI
was consulted and recommended ICU admission for monitoring.

ROS: No fevers/chills/URI sx/cough. No
lightheadedness/dizziness, no changes in vision, no focal

Pertinent Results:
[**1-/2186**] EGD: Granularity, erythema and congestion in the antrum
and stomach body compatible with gastritis
Erosions in the antrum
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum

CXR [**2187-2-1**]:
PORTABLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST AT 13:35 HOURS:  Again seen
is chronic
left-sided pleural thickening with left lower lobe atelectasis.
The remainder of the lungs is clear with no consolidation or
pleural effusion.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.
The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Median
sternotomy wires, aortic valve replacement and surgical clips
are unchanged.  Aortic calcifications are again noted.  There is
no pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities.  Chronic
left-sided
pleural thickening with associated atelectasis.

EGD:
 Normal esophagus.
Stomach:
 Excavated Lesions A single 10mm ulcer was found in the proximal
antrum. A red spot suggested recent bleeding.
No fresh blood/clots was seen in the stomach
Duodenum: Normal duodenum. Normal bile flow from the major
papilla
Other procedures: Two [**Company 2267**] Resolution clips were
applied to the gastric ulcer
Impression: 1. Ulcer in the proximal antrum
2. Two [**Company 2267**] Resolution clips were applied to the
gastric ulcer
3. Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
Recommendations: 1.PPI twice daily.
2.Serial hematocrit and PRC as appropriate.
3. Follow up with ICU/floor team.

Brief Hospital Course:
75yo gentleman with h/o CAD and myelodysplastic syndrome
admitted with chronic guaiac positive stools and Hct of 17.
1. GI bleed: Patient has chronic GI bleed and requires chronic
transfusions due to inability to sufficiently produce in the
setting of myelodysplastic syndrome. The patient had an EGD
performed with 2 clips placed to an atral gastric ulcer (full
report above).  He was transfused 2 units of PRBCs prior to the
procedure and his hct was monitored serially for further signs
of blood loss.  He was placed on [**Hospital1 **] ppi, initially IV and then
transitioned to po.  The patient's goal hct was >28 given his
extensive CAD history however this was felt to be unattainable
due to his pre-existing MDS. Follow up hematocri is recommended
with PCP/hematologist.
