Chest Pain and shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catherization with stent placement.


History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with history of hypertension who
was admitted with an ST elevation myocardial infarction.  A few
days prior to presentation, she developed intermittent back and
shoulder pain.  The night prior to presentation, she awoke from
sleep with more severe shoulder and neck pain.  She applied
bengay without improvement.  She also felt short of breath and
was able to catch her breath.  She presented to an outside
hospital at which she was noted to have a new right bundle
branch block with ST elevations in leads V2-V5.  She was
hypertensive to the 200s systolic.  A nitro drip was started and
dropped her pressures.  She was then treated with nitro paste,
aspirin, lopressor, enalopril, heparin drip, morphine, and
lasix.  She was transfered to the [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac
catherization.  She had a stent placed to her left anterior
descending artery and was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit.
At that time, she denied any residual pain or shortness of
breath.

Past Medical History:

.
EKG: Right bundle branch block with ST elevations and prominent
Q-waves in the anterior leads.
.
Cardiac Catherization: The left main coronary had mild diffuse
disease.  The mid left anterior descending artery had a focal
99% stenosis.  The left circumflex had a 60-70% stenosis.  The
right coronary was free of disease.
.
Hemodynamics: Pulmonary artery pressures were 28/10/19.  Wedge
pressure was 14.  Cardiac output was 3.8 with an index of 2.6.
.
Intervention: A drug eluting stent was placed to the mid LAD
lesion without complication.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old female who presented with an anterior ST
elevation myocardial infarction and had a stent placed to the
LAD.
.
1. STEMI: On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**], she was pain free.  Given the
prominent Q waves on her EKG, it was felt that she had completed
her infarction.  At catherization, she was found to have 2
vessel disease with a 99% stenosis of the mid-left anterior
descending artery.  A drug eluting stent was placed over this
lesion with good resultant flow.  She may eventually need
intervention to the 60-70% stenosis in the circumflex.  She was
started on aspirin, Plavix and a high dose Statin.  Metoprolol
and lisinopril were titrated up as her blood pressure tolerated.
 She had no further episodes of chest pain throughout the
admission.
.
2. Congestive Heart Failure: A post-catherization echocardiogram
showed severe left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection
fraction of 20-25% and anterior and apical akinesis.  She was
started on Coumadin with a heparin bridge for anticoagulation.
After discussions with her outside physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was decided not
to anticoagulate her for her apical akinesis because the risk of
bleeding at her age.  During this admission, she had one episode
of flash pulmonary edema after receiving a unit of blood.  She
became acutely short of breath and hypertensive.  She received
Lasix and diuresed 2 litres.  She was started on maintenance
Lasix.
.
3. Elevation INR: She had received 2 doses of Coumadin for
apical akinesis as above.  At the time of discharge, her she had
a supratherapeutic INR at 6.6.  She received vitamin K.  She
will had her INR checked in 1 day post discharge.
.
4. Anemia: She had a hematocrit of 24 post-catherization.  She
received 2 units of red cells with an appropriate bump.
.
5. Hypertension: Her blood pressure was controlled with
lisinopril and metoprolol as above.
.
6. GERD: She was maintained on a PPI.
.
7. Access: Peripheral IVs.
.
8. FEN: She was maintained on a cardiac diet.  Her magnesium and
potassium were repleted.  She was diuresed as above.
.
9. Prophylaxis: Anticoagulation as above, bowel regimen, and
PPI.
.
10. Code: Full.
.
11. Dispo: She was discharged to home with home physical
therapy.
