History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 732**] is a 74-year-old woman with mitral valve prolapse
who recently underwent laparoscopy-assisted sigmoidectomy and
rectopexy on [**2102-2-24**] and was subsequently discharged to rehab on
[**2102-3-2**]. She was re-admitted on [**2102-3-4**] with recurrent rectal
prolapse. She is scheduled to undergo hemorrhoidectomy. However,
she was noted to have new ECG changes and cardiology was
consulted.  An echocardiogram was performed which revealed
severe mitral and tricuspidregurgitaion with a question of a
flail posterior mitral leaflet.

She was transferred to the cardiology service for further
management of acute heart failure.

Of note, the patient reported a significant worsening in dyspnea
on exertion since her recent surgery. At this time, she gets
short of breath with mild exertion. She also reports mild
bipedal edema that has started since the surgery. Dr.[**First Name (STitle) **] was
consulted for surgical repair.

[**2102-3-17**] Intra-op Echo:
PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is markedly dilated. The left atrium
is elongated. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body
of the left atrium. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity
is depressed (<0.2m/s). No thrombus is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
2. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. The coronary sinus is dilated (diameter >15mm). No evidence
of LSVC following bolus of iv fluid in left arm iv.
4. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.]
5. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
7. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is an
eccentric jet directed anteriorly with significant prolapse and
flail of P2 and moderate anterior leaflet retraction.
8. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid annulus measures 4 cm.
9. There is a very small pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.

POST-CPB: On infusion of epi, neo, milrinone. AV pacing.
Well-seated bioprosthetic valve in the mitral position. Poor
images due to air in esophagus. Small amount of MR. [**Name14 (STitle) 86748**]
annuloplasty ring in the tricuspid position. TR is now mild.
Preserved biventricular systolic function on inotropic support.
Aortic contour is normal post decannulation.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2102-3-17**] where
she underwent mitral valve replacement and tricuspid valve
repair. Please refer to Dr.[**Name (NI) 86749**] operative report for
further details.  She weaned from bypasss on propofol and neo
Synephrine infusions. Vancomycin was used for surgical
antibiotic prophylaxis, given the preoperative stay of longer
than 24 hours. She was weaned form sedation and awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated without difficulty. Over
the next 24 hours she was weaned off pressors. All lines and
drains were discontinued in a timely fashion.

Diuresis was begun towards her preoperative weight and beta
blockade begun.  She continued to progress and was transferred
to the step down unit for further monitoring on POD# 5. Physical
Therapy was consulted for strength and mobility evaluation.
Serial chest x-rays and a chest CT scan was done to evaluate
postoperative pleural effusions. A moderate left effusion and a
large right effusion were noted.  A right thoracentesis was
performed which yielded 1600cc of serosanguinous fluid was
obtained uneventfully.  The post procedure CXR revealed no
residual apical pneumothoraces, small left pleural effusion,
full resolution of right pleural effusion.

EP was consulted POD#9 to evaluate heart rhythm after an episode
of bradycardia-AV nodal dysfunction occurred. Beta-blocker was
discontinued. It was determined by EP after following several
days of her electrical activity that due to paroxysmal AVblock a
PPM was warranted. [**3-28**] PPM was placed.

POD#11 she was cleared by Dr.[**First Name (STitle) **] for discharge to [**Location (un) 582**] at
[**Hospital 620**] rehabilitation for further strength and mobility. All
follow up appointments were advised.
