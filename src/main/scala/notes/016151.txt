                            **FINAL REPORT [**2110-9-19**]**

   Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2110-9-19**]):
      STAPH AUREUS COAG +.
         Consultations with ID are recommended for all blood
cultures
         positive for Staphylococcus aureus and [**Female First Name (un) 564**] species.

         FINAL SENSITIVITIES.
         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.

                              SENSITIVITIES: MIC expressed in
MCG/ML

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2110-7-21**], the patient was admitted to the transplant surgery
service and started on broad-spectrum antibiotics.  That night
she underwent attempted exploratory laparotomy for
intra-abdominal abscess from anastomotic leak. This was
unsuccessful and a wound VAC was placed. She was then admitted
to the SICU.  On [**2110-7-22**], she underwent CT-guided drainage of
this abscess. Drain produced succus.  There was evidence on CT
abdomen of enteral fistula into the abscess cavity as well. She
remained NPO with TPN for most of hospital course.

She remained in sinus tachycardia with heart rate ranging
100-130s.  Cardiology consult was obtained and tachycardia was
attributed to infection, hypovolemia, and anemia.  There was no
evidence of myocardial injury.  She was hypotensive and
initially required neosynephrine gtt, which was weaned.  She was
hemodynamically stable on midodrine. This was subsequently
discontinued.

She was intubated episodically for invasive procedures.
Infectious work-up found enterobacter pneumonia on
broncheoalveolar lavage on [**2110-8-5**], and this was treated with
a two-week course of meropenem.

She had h/o bilateral nephrectomy.  She required intermittent
hemodialysis as well as CVVH while hypotensive and requiring
vasopressors in the SICU. Intravenous fluids were given as
needed for maintenance and for hypovolemia. CVVH was switched to
intermittent hemodialysis when she was off pressor support.

Post-operative course was complicated by Candidemia found on
blood cultures on [**2110-7-28**], which was treated with Ambisome ([**8-2**]
thru [**8-15**])then Micafungin [**8-15**] thru [**8-24**]). This was switched to
Fluconazole for 2 weeks (10/3-1016). Ophthalmology was
consulted. Retinal specialist found changes indicating only
tuberous sclerosis. .  Hematocrit was checked regularly and she
was transfused with 2 units of PRBC on [**9-21**] and [**9-24**]. She had
no acutely anemic events.

Central venous access was necessary at all times, with temporary
HD catheter and triple-lumen central venous line, as it was not
possible to establish peripheral
