ECG Study Date of [**2102-8-3**]
Sinus rhythm. Left ventricular hypertrophy. Right bundle-branch
block.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2100-2-10**] right bundle-branch
block has
appeared. The ST-T wave changes in the anterolateral leads
appear to exceed the repolarization abnormalities associated
with right bundle-branch block and there is T wave inversion in
leads II, III and aVF. These findings suggest acute
anterolateral ischemic process. The rate has increased. Clinical
correlation is suggested.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY Study Date of [**2102-8-3**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Massive PE with evidence with evidence of right heart strain.

2. Significant eccentric plaque along the thoracic aorta.
3. 2-mm right upper lobe nodule is visualized. One-year followup
CT is
recommended if elevated risk factors (smoking, malignancy) are
present.

TTE (Complete) Done [**2102-8-4**]
IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension with
dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle. Normal global and
regional left ventricular systolic function. Mild aortic and
mitral regurgitation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 7973**] is an 87 year old portugese speaking woman with
a PMHx significant for HLD and HTN who presented on [**8-3**] to the
ED with a chief complaint of dyspnea associated with pleuritic
flank pain.

# Pulmonary embolism--As mentioned in the HPI, pt denied any
antecedent trauma, surgeries, cancer diagnoses, or
immobilization. She denies recent weight loss or rectal/vaginal
bleeding. She felt asymmetric leg swelling 3-4 weeks ago and
prior to presentation, she experienced 3 weeks of gradually
improving rhinorrhea, cough, and SOB. For this she had been
treated with a 5 day course of Azithromycin per her PCP 3 weeks
prior to presention. Upon presentation to the [**Name (NI) **], pt was found
to have an SpO2 of 89%, but was hemodynamically stable with BP
120's-130's/50's-60's. On EKG she demonstrated symptoms of right
heart strain with S1,T3 and a new RBBB. A CTA was performed
which demonstrated a saddle pulmonary embolus. She was begun on
a heparin gtt and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. Throughout her stay
in the ICU, her BP remained stable in the range of
140-170/70-90's. A TTE performed on the second day of admission
demonstrated normal LV function, severe pulmonary hypertension
with a dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle. Hemodynamically,
however, Ms. [**Known lastname 7973**] remained stable without hypotension or
tachycardia. Given her advanced age and lack of hemodynamic
instability the decision was made not to administer tPA.
Ms. [**Known lastname 7973**] was begun on warfarin in anticipation of
long-term anticoagulation.  Her INR was followed closely, and a
therapeutic INR (goal [**3-9**]) was overlapped with the heparin gtt x
48 hours.  She will follow up closely with her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] she has
an [**Hospital3 **] appointment the day following
discharge. Please see results section for recent INR's and
warfarin dosing.

Of note, Ms. [**Known lastname 7973**] has not had a colonoscopy since [**2091**]
(which was normal), and has not had a mammogram since [**2094**]
(which was normal). The cessation of these cancer screens was
age appropriate, however the PCP may elect to repeat these tests
in light of her PE.

In addition, given that this PE was unprovoked, the patient
should have a hypercoag work-up as an outpt given that this may
impact her length of therapy as well as screening for her
family. Per report, her daughter has a history of DVt.
