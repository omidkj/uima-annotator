Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2880**]
Chief Complaint:
Bowel obstruction, COPD, PNA, NSTEMI


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p diverting colonostomy and Lysis of adhesions on [**3-13**] at
[**Hospital3 **]

History of Present Illness:
81yoM with COPD, Parkinsons disease, asbestosis who presented to
[**Hospital3 **] on [**3-11**] with abdominal pain, distension, and
cough, whose course was complicated by PNA and NSTEMI, now being
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with hemodynamic instability.
.
The patient had reported difficulty moving his bowels, abdominal
pain, and distension for 2 days prior to presentation to [**Hospital1 **] on [**3-11**].  He had a leukocytosis of 12 with left shift
of 80% PMN, 5% bands.  He also reported upper respiratory
symptoms with recent CXR showing only evidence of abestosis and
had completed a course of Zithromax.  He was determined to have
a bilateral lower lobe PNA and was started on Levofloxacin and
then broadened to Vanc/Zosyn, and was given duonebs and
Methylprednisolone 40mg IV.  He was also diagnosed with bowel
obstruction and after three days of conservative management with
NGT, enemas, IVF, he underwent an exploratory laparotomy with
lysis of adhesions on [**3-13**] and ?colectomy with diverting
transverse loop colostomy.  He had an NGT placed and was started
on TPN for nutrition.  Post-op, he had a lateral wall NSTEMI
believed to be due to demand ischemia, and a TTE on [**3-17**] showed a
new diagnosis of severe aortic stenosis with normal EF.  He was
started on a Heparin gtt.  He was also found to be in an acute
CHF exacerbation with pulmonary edema on CXR, and was placed on
a non-rebreather.  He was subsequently diuresed with Lasix 20-40
mg IV and had multiple episodes of hypotension.  During his stay
at [**Hospital3 **], the patient's blood pressure and volume
status was difficult to manage and he was intermittently on
Phenylephrine and Neosynephrine.  He has intermittently been on
bipap and was weaned to a venti-mask the day of transfer.
.
Additionally, the patient was also found to be anemic with a hct
ranging from 30-40, and was given 1 unit PRBC.  He was also
found to have an elevated d-dimer and underwent LENI's which
were negative for DVT.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient was in moderate respiratory
distress on a venti-mask and was also very anxious.  He
complained of abdominal pain at his colostomy and recent
surgical site, but otherwise denied other pain.
