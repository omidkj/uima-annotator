Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7575**]
Chief Complaint:
seizures

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PEG tube placement, intubation x two

History of Present Illness:
65 yo LH man with h/o metastatic melanoma, initially dx'd
[**2134-1-8**] s/p wide local excision, recurrence in the right
parotid gland, s/p radical neck dissection [**9-8**], s/p adjuvant
local field irradiation from [**10-9**] to [**11-8**] and finally adjuvant
alpha-interferon, [**Date range (1) 44733**]. He experienced his first seizure in
[**Month (only) 205**] and was admitted to the [**Hospital1 1170**] neurology service. He was initially put on dilantin but
developed a rash and gradually was placed on keppra as well as
decadron because MRI showed changes in the right temporal lobe
consistent with radiation necrosis. His seizures are varied and
are remarkable for aphasia as either the ictal or post-ictal
phenomenon as well as generalized tonic-clonic seizures. He was
admitted again [**10-10**] and MRI showed no change but he was
increased on his decadron. He was readmitted [**3-11**] after having 3
generalized seizures and prolonged post-ictal aphasia. An EEG
only showed PLEDS during this aphasia state. He was kept on
keppra and lamictal was added to his regimen. He last saw Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 724**] in neuro-oncology on [**2136-3-29**] and the plan was to
remain on Keppra [**2131**] mg [**Hospital1 **] while the Lamictal was to be
increased to 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] within one month or so. In mid-[**Month (only) 116**] he
was hospitalized with chest pain, underwent stress testing and
subsequent cardiac catheterization with placement of an LAD
stent. He recently
visited with his oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1729**] on [**2136-5-10**] who performed
torso CT which showed no evidence of systemic disease.

On the day of admission he was apparently visiting with his
girlfriend at [**Name (NI) 44734**] and had at 4:30pm he said "make a right turn, make
a right turn" as they were driving to dinner. He didn't answer
her when she asked him how his heart was doing. He tried to
indicate that he was all right but he was not able to talk at
all. His left arm was "scooping" about 10 minutes after he
stopped talking. He was just quiet but he was not staring off
into space. The "scooping" lasted 10 minutes and by the time she
was able to pull over and get attention, his whole body is
"swaying" with his left arm and leg but she is not able to give
me a great description. She states that this typically happens
with his seizures. This may have lasted 5 minutes and then EMS
came and were able to give him 5mg valium iv and 1mg ativan iv.
He stopped just about right after he was given the iv meds. He
was brought to [**Hospital 25143**] Hospital in Wolfeboro and then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

His fiancee states that he has been extremely compliant with his
meds. She
denies him having recent fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness
of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. But he
did state that he was more depressed and tired in the last
couple days. Baseline his talking has been much improved but not
100% normal, almost talking normally according to his
girlfriend. However, she denies him having headache, numbness,
weakness, vision problems, lethargy etc.


Past Medical History:

Physical Exam:
On admission:

Examination: T 95.6 BP 150/100 HR 72 RR 16 98% 2l

Lungs: CTA bilaterally
CV: RRR
Abd: soft, NT
Ext: no pedal edema, no rashes, multiple ecchymoses.

Mental Status: Patient is alert with his eyes open, does not
follow simple one-step motor commands. drawing are normal.

Cranial nerves: Active eye closing and I could not visualize
discs. Eyes are at midline and conjugate. Pupils react normally
to light, both directly and consensually. Face seems symmetric.

Motor: He keeps both arms up against gravity when lifted. There
is no obvious drift. He withdraws legs briskly to noxious
stimulus. There is a left sided rest tremor.

Coordination: not tested

Reflexes: The deep tendon reflexes are all present, symmetric
and
normal. The plantar responses are mute on the left, question
upgoing on the right.

Sensory: Withdraws all 4 extremities to pain.

Gait and stance: deferred

Neuro: alert, eyes open, follows some one-step midline and
appendicular commands. He can stick out his tongue, close his
eyes, lift his right hand. He does not completely accurately
show two fingers or point to the window or ceiling. He has
preserved automatic speech- says "fine" when we ask "How are
you?" No utterances longer than 2 or 3 words. Repeat simple
words.
Motor exam: at least 4/5 strength but some limited cooperation
due to decreased comprehension. Moves all extremities
spontaneously.


Pertinent Results:
Phenobarbital level on [**2136-7-5**] = 35.1

Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted on [**2136-5-21**] after having seizures on keppra 2g po
bid, lamictal 100mg po bid and decadron 2mg po bid. He was
admitted to the neurology [**Hospital1 **] service initially but while
waiting in the ED for a bed, he continued to have recurrent
seizure activity (at least 3 additional ones) which were treated
with ativan, and then depakote was loaded as a third
anticonvulsant [**Doctor Last Name 360**].

Subsequently he was on the neurology icu service until [**2136-6-13**],
when he was transferred to the MICU service for persistent
fevers, chronic aspiration and nosocomial pneumonia.

A brief outline of his hospital course on neurology is as
follows (also taken from Dr.[**Initials (NamePattern4) 44735**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] note of [**2136-6-8**]):

[**5-21**]: dexamethasone increased for 2mg to 4mg [**Hospital1 **] for temporal
lobe necrosis secondary to XRT therapy, lamictal dose increased,
loaded with depakote

[**5-23**]: experienced some shaking, given phenobarbital, periodic
lateralized epileptiform discharges over right hemisphere
(PLEDS) seen on EEG

[**Date range (1) 44736**]: repeat head CT with no change from [**5-21**], no
hemorrhage. He was unable to get MRI due to recent CAD stent.
Continuous EEG showed spikes and slow waves thus patient was
intubated on [**5-25**] for versed coma ([**Date range (1) **]) for burst
suppression. Patient required BP support, thus versed d/c'd.
Phenobarbital added, then d/c'd on [**5-29**]. Multiple discussions
with pt's significant other took place during this time. (Formal
epilepsy consult obtained at this time, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**].)

[**5-25**]: anemic, requiring transfusions to keep hct>30 given CAD
and recent stent placement in [**4-10**]. Also, spiked to 101.2 and
started on ceftriax/vanco/flagyl for presumed aspiration pna

[**5-28**]: Urine growing enterococcus and sputum showing signs of
infection, all [**Last Name (un) 36**] to levaquin so antibiotics changed to
levofloxacin/flagyl. Pt completed 10 day course of levofloxacin.


[**5-31**]: vancomycin was added to levofloxacin as pt still spiking
and WBC 20K.

[**6-4**]: lines changed over a wire out of concern for infection.
Catheter tip eventually showed no growth in cultures.

[**6-6**]: extubated

[**Date range (1) **]: Patient started waking up (prolonged depressed mental
status thought to be secondary to phenobarbital effect and
post-ictal lethargy
