History of Present Illness:
Patient transfer from OSH
.
HPI: Patient is a 57 y/o woman with a PMH of DM type II, HTN,
obesity and hyperlipidemia who presented to an OSH on [**9-16**] with
complaints of 5 days of intractable vomiting and fatigue. She
states she was unable to hold anything down and her vomitus
consisted of food, no blood. She denied diarrhea or abdominal
pain at the time. She also denied fevers, chills. On history she
also noted increasing abdominal girth over the last year with a
weight gain of 40 lbs in 1 year. Initially the patient was given
IVF hydration and kept NPO. A RUQ US was done which showed no
cholecystitis. 3 days after admission the patient c/o LLQ pain
and had some diarrhea so a CT abdomen was obtained. CT showed
diffuse peritoneal carcinomatosis with a complex cystic solid
mass in the left adnexa measuring 12x6x7cm. Patient then
underwent CT-guided intraperitoneal biopsy which was consistent
with Burkitts lymphoma. CA 125 was 1580 and CED was less than
0.5.
.
At the OSH the patient's Cr was found to increase to 1.9 and her
uric acid level was 18. She was started on IVF with bicarb.
Renal saw her and questioned the need for dialysis. Her hospital
course was complicated by acute renal failure felt to be
secondary to tumor lysis syndrome and possibly a component of
contrast nephrophathy. Creatinine fluctuated between 1.1-1.5
during OSH stay and then rose to 1.9 on the day of transfer to
[**Hospital1 18**]. The patient also had an episode of a fib [**2120-9-21**].
Cardiology was consulted. She was rate contolled with
beta-blockers and anticoagulation was not continued because of
hematocrit drop. The decision was made to transfer her to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further treatment of her lymphoma.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], she was transferred to BMT service on [**9-27**]. She was
started on chemotherapy for lymphoma and received 4 doses of
chemotherapy. She developed acute renal failure and had urgent
HD. Following her HD treatment on [**2120-9-30**] she spiked to 101.8
and developed new oxygen requirements and placed on 100% NRB.
CXR [**9-30**] with clear lungs. On the morning of [**10-1**] the patient
became hypotensive to SBP in 80's responsive to fluid bolus. ABG
7.40/41/101. The decision was made to transfer patient to ICU
for close monitoring in the setting of hypotension, anuria and
hypoxic respiratory failure.
.
In the ICU, she was found to have perforation and sent to OR.
Ultimately, she was found to have a perforated jejunum and s/p
ex-lap/small bowel resection/left salpingo-oophorectomy ([**10-2**]).
She had a CVL placed for CVVH, and was extubated on [**10-4**]. She is
currently on TPN, and last PM developed atrial fibrillation,
given amiodarone and converted to NSR.
.
She is now being transferred back to the BMT service. Currently,
she is feeling well with no complaints except mild abdominal
tenderness which a controlled with percocet. She denies any
fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, headache, chest pain,
palpitations, lightheadedness, shortness of breath.

Studies performed at OSH:
TTE at OSH: Normal LVEF
.
CT abdomen: Diffuse peritoneal carcinomatosis with high
attenuation throughout omentum, complex cystic solid mass in the
left adnexal region, large area of extensive massive soft tissue
metastatic tumor occupying a vast majority of the left side of
the abdomen, encasing some bowel loops. many gallstones. Fluid
within peritoneum. Bilateral plueral effusions.
.
LE US: Negative for DVT
.
DIAGNOSIS:
Biopsy, "omental cake" High grade malignant lymphoma:
The specimen consists of a core needle biopsies of soft tissue
and fat, which is diffusely infiltrated by sheets of
mediam-sized to large lymphocytes. These lymphocytes are
somewhat monomorphic, with a moderate amount of basophilic
cytoplasm and one mostly a single prominent nucleolus. While
many of these lymphocytes have smooth nuclear contours, others
have irregularly-shaped nuclei. These are mitotic figures and
apoptotic bodies, and scattered tingible-body macrophages
present. There is no recognizable architecture present.
Immunoperoxidase studies performed at the outside hospital show
the lymphoma to be positive for CD20 and CD79a; there is strong
co-expression of CD10; the MIB-1 fraction is estimated at >90%;
CD3 and CD5 stain scattered admixed T-cells. A cytokeratin
AE1/AE3 is negative.  A bcl-2 stain performed at our institution
stains scattered smaller lymphocytes, and rare larger cells.
The submitted peripheral smears show no evidence of circulating
Burkitt's lymphoma. The above histologic and reported
immunohistochemical findings are consistent with a high-grade
non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma. Given the strong CD10 staining with
high (>90%) MIB-1 fraction, Burkitt's or atypical Burkitt's
lymphoma needs to be considered. FISH study for c-myc
translocation may be helpful in confirming Burkitt lymphoma.
.
echo: [**2120-10-2**]: Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is normal in size. The left atrium is
elongated.
2.Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity
size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function appears depressed.
4.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve
stenosis.
5. Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.
7. The RV function is hard to assess but suspect that it may be
slightly
decreased.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 57 y/o woman with h/o DM type II, HTN with newly
diagnosed high grade lymphoma who had hospital course
complicated by anuric renal failure requiring dialysis, acute
respiratory failure, and jejunal perforation s/p ex-lap/small
bowel resection/left salpingo-oophorectomy on [**10-2**].
.
1. Heme/onc (Lymphoma): The patient presented with large ovarian
and omental masses and the OSH did a biopsy and felt the patient
had Burkitt's lymphoma.   The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for therapy. She was treated with (maggrath protocol) 4 days of
CODOX-M ([**Date range (1) 68538**]), but unfortunately developed tumor lysis
syndrome, hypotension and renal failure.  She was transferred to
the ICU in the setting of hypotension, anuria and hypoxic
respiratory failure.  In the ICU, she was found to have
perforation and sent to OR. Ultimately, she was found to have a
perforated jejunum and s/p ex-lap/small bowel resection/left
salpingo-oophorectomy ([**10-2**]), once the patient was stable she
returned to BMT.  On return she was treated with I
