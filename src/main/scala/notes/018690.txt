History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 72-year-old male who in [**2146**] underwent an aortic
valve replacement with a mechanical Bjork-Shiley valve. He has
been followed for an enlarging ascending aorta and his most
recent echo showed it to be now at 6 cm. He is now presenting
for repair of the ascending aortic aneurysm

Physical Exam:
GEN: NAD
NECK: Supple, FROM

EXT: Warm, well perfused, 1+ edema.
NEURO: Nonfocal. No carotid bruits.

Pertinent Results:
[**2167-7-23**] ECHO
PRE CPB The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. There is moderate to severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %). There is moderate
global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The ascending
aorta is markedly dilated. This dilation appears to taper down
near the arch but limited views prevent full assessment. There
are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are focal
calcifications in the aortic arch. The descending thoracic aorta
is mildly dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. A single tilting disk type aortic
valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears
to be well seated. The disk is poorly seen but appears to be
moving appropriately. Some fibrinous echodensities are seen on
the LVOT side of the valve and are likely evidence of some
degeneration. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of tricuspid regurgitation may
be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

POST CPB The patient is receiving epinephrine by infusion. The
left ventricle continues to display moderate to severe global
dysfunction, but now with slightly more hypokinesis of the
inferior wall. The EF is about 30%. The right ventricle displays
somewhat improved function from pre-bypass study - now mildly
globally hypokinetic. The ascending aortic graft is only poorly
seen. The thoracic aorta appers intact distal to the graft.
Mitral regurgitation is now trace. No other changes from pre-cpb
study.

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: evaluate for effusion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
72 year old man with s/p asc aorta replac
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate for effusion
CHEST X-RAY

HISTORY: Status post ascending aorta repair, evaluate for
effusion.

Two views. Comparison with [**2167-7-24**]. The patient is status post
median sternotomy and MVR, as before. Mediastinal structures are
unchanged. An ICD remains in place. A right internal jugular
catheter has been withdrawn. Allowing for differences in
technique, there is no other significant change.

IMPRESSION: No significant interval change.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2167-7-21**] for surgical
management of his dilated ascending aorta. Heparin was started
as he had been off his coumadin for 5 days in aticipation of
surgery. On [**2167-7-23**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room
where he underwent a redo sternotomy with replacement of his
ascending aorta. An intraopertaive vascular surgery consult was
obtained as it was decided to use his right axillary artery for
arterial cannulation. Please see operative note for details.
Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit for
monitoring. By postoperative day one, Mr. [**Known lastname **] had awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. Aspirin, beta blockade
and a statin were resumed. The electrophysiology service was
consulted for interrogation of his pacemaker and it was
reprogrammed to function appropriately. Haldol was used for some
mild postoperative aggitation. Coumadin was resumed for his
mechanical valve. Mr. [**Known lastname **] developed atrial fibrillation for
which amiodarone was started. Mr. [**Known lastname **] remained in the
intensive care unit for a few extra days due to agitation and
confusion however this slowly cleared. On postoperative day
three, he was transferred to the step down unit for further
recovery. He was gently diuresed towards his preoperative
weight. The physical therapy service was consulted for
assistance with his postoperative strength and mobility. His
mental status cleared and on POD 7 he was discharged to rehab in
stable condition.
