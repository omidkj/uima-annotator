Prebypass:
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Aside from the inferior wall which is akinetic, regional wall
motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
mildly depressed (LVEF= 40%). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.
Due to the emergent nature of surgery and fluctuating
hemodynamics interatrial septum was not examined for defects by
2D or color flow.
Postbypass:
The patient is on infusions of phenylephrine and is not paced.
Normal Right ventricular systolic function. LVEF 40%. No
valvular issues. Intact thoracic aorta.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
