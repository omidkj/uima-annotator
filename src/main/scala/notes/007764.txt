Imaging:

LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)	Study Date of [**2107-2-20**]
4:12 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Left lobe hepatic cyst, measuring 2.7 cm.
2. Equivocal wall thickening of the gallbladder, which is
distended. No definite cholecystitis although clinical
correlation is needed. A HIDA scan or MRI with eovist could be
performed for further evaluation.
3. 3 mm CBD. There is no intrahepatic bile duct dilation.

CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2107-2-20**] 5:44 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Distended gallbladder without wall edema or stranding is
nonspecific, but cholecystitis cannot be excluded in the setting
of abnormal LFTs and WBC values. Hepatitis, which is often not
visualized on CT, is also a possiblity. A HIDA scan can be
considered for evaluation of the gallbladder, or an MRI with
Eovist can evaluate both the liver and gallbladder.
2. 2.9 cm cystic lesion within segment IVb of the liver is not
fully characterized due to lack of IV contrast, but likely
represents a cyst.
3. Enlarged porta hepatis node.
4. Left inguinal hernia containing a loop of sigmoid colon, with
no evidence of obstruction. No secondary signs of ischemia are
seen.
5. Severe atherosclerois of the abdominal aorta and iliac
branches.

ERCP:
Impression: Several superficial ulcers were noted in the
duodenal bulb.
A possible small duodenal mass was seen in the distance in the
3rd part of the duodenum. Biopsy was not attempted due to the
patient's coagulopathy.
Successful biliary cannulation was achieved with the
sphincterotome
Cholangiogram revealed very mild diffuse biliary dilation- the
left hepatic system filled incompletely- further attempts to
visualize the left hepatic system were not undertaken because of
the patient's ongoing cholangitis. Several small filling defects
were seen in the lower CBD suggestive of stones.
A 9cm x 10Fr biliary stent was placed in the common bile duct.
There was immediate flow of bile and a small amount of sludge.
No pus was seen.
Otherwise normal ERCP to 3rd part of duodenum.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Cholangitis/Sepsis:Pt was hypotensive and febrile on arrival
to the ED.  He was fluid resuscitated and admitted to the MICU
on pressors with broad spectrum antibiotic coverage.  Infectious
work up revealed abnormal LFTs and blood cultures were positive
for Ecoli in [**1-19**] sets on [**2-20**].  Pt was taken for ERCP on [**2-21**] with
placement of a stent and appropriate drainage of bile.  Pt was
also noted to have small duodenal ulcers and possible duodenal
mass that was not biopsied due to coagulopathy.   Pt was
transferred to the floor and transitioned to IV cipro for a pan
sensitive Ecoli.  His liver function tests normalized and he was
advanced a diet with difficulty.   All surveillance Cx remained
negative and pt was discharged with a plan to complete 14 days
of cipro.   Pt, family
