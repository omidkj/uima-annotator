Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins / Lisinopril / [**Last Name (un) **]-Angiotensin Receptor Antagonist

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4327**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 71 male with a history of coronary artery
disease s/p CABG ([**2186**] at [**Hospital1 112**] SVG to OM, SVG to RCA-RPL), PCI
[**2192**], [**2197**], [**2199-11-6**] (NSTEMI with DES of SVG to OM) as well as
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes who presents from
cardiology clinic with worsening dyspnea. At baseline, he
ambulates slowly outside for about twenty minutes several times
per week. Several days ago, he was outside walking when he
developed dyspnea with limited ambulation. He returned home but
continued to feel short of breath with minimal exertion. He also
feels that his lower extremities were more swollen. He denies
chest pain, cough, fever, chills, syncope, diaphoresis. He
reports stable 2 pillow orthopnea. He endorses taking his
medications as prescribed. He monitors his blood pressure at
home with values typically 130s this past week. Today, he
presented to his cardiologist where he was found to have an
oxygen saturation of 91%. He was referred to the ED for further
evaluation of his dyspnea.
.
He was recently hospitalized ([**Date range (1) 25545**]) in the CCU for NSTEMI
(trop 2.45) with decompensated heart failure with a preserved
ejection fraction. Cath showed 90% distal stenosis with visible
thrombus of SVG-OM graft and he underwent successful PCI with
[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 5175**].  TTE showed ejection revealed that
regional/global systolic function were normal (>55%) with mild
to moderate mitral regurgitation. He was diuresed and was felt
to be euvolemic on discharge with O2 sats in mid to high 90s on
room air. His decompensation was felt to be due to IV fluids
received in the and acute ischemia. He was not discharged on a
diuretic.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 97.7 54 132/65 18 94% 2L (78%RA).
On exam, patient appeared quite comfortable and minimally
symptomatic despite low oxygen saturation, crackles in lower
lung fields. Labs notable for creatinine 1.0 (baseline 1.2), BNP
of 2446 (was 985 in [**2196**]), troponin <0.01, d-dimer 910. ABG:
7.49/34/53 on 4L NC. EKG per report showed sinus bradycardia,
lateral Q waves, unchanged compared to prior. CT chest was
negative for pulmonary embolism but noted severe emphysema w/
right heart strain, interstitial pulmonary edema and small
bilateral pleural effusions. He was given albulterol and
ipratropium nebulizers. He was given lasix 40IV with 2.1L of
urine output in ED. Currenlty on 50% face tent satting mid-90s
and comfortable.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

CXR [**2199-11-29**] Mild-to-moderate interstitial pulmonary edema with
small

likely
atelectasis.
.
CT CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST [**2199-11-29**] 1. No pulmonary
embolus or acute intrathoracic process.
2. Mild pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Severe emphysema with early fibrosis.
4. Pulmonary nodules up to 1.0 cm, for which PET-CT or
three-month follow-up chest CT recommended.
5. Prominent mediastinal lymph nodes, non-specific
.
ECHO [**2199-11-30**] The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of
the inferior wall. The remaining segments contract normally
(LVEF = 50 %). There is no ventricular septal defect (limited
views). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion. IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with
mild regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. No significant
mitral regurgitation or definite VSD identified. Compared with
the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2199-11-3**], inferior left
ventricular hypokinesis is more clearly defined.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 71 male with a history of coronary artery
disease s/p CABG ([**2186**] at [**Hospital1 112**] SVG to OM, SVG to RCA-RPL), PCI
[**2192**], [**2197**], [**2199-11-6**] (NSTEMI with DES of SVG to OM) as well as
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes who presents from
home with worsening dyspnea found to be in hypoxic respiratory
distress
.
ACUTE CARE:
# HYPOXIA: He likely has a low pulmonary reserve from
obstructive airway disease, as although he does not carry a
diagnosis of COPD his chest imaging findings in the setting of
significant smoking history are highly suggestive. His acute
decompensation with hypoxic respiratory distress with a
significant A-a gradient is likely due to worsening  V/Q
mismatch from pulmonary edema and pleural effusion from
decompensated heart failure. There is no evidence of pulmonary
embolism on chest CT.
