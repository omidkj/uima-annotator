BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:   The
patient is a 39-year-old gentleman with a history of human
immunodeficiency virus with a CD4 count of 1 with a high
viral load and history of multiple opportunistic infections
who originally presented on [**3-27**] with fevers.  Likely was
secondary to infected Port-A-Cath with cultures growing
Klebsiella.

1.  KLEBSIELLA PNEUMONIA ISSUES:  The patient's cultures from
[**3-27**] were pan-sensitive Klebsiella.  Continued on his
ceftriaxone to complete a 14-day course.  Surveillance
cultures so far had been negative to date.  He had a
surveillance cultures from the tip that grew yeast, but
Infectious Disease attending asked for blood cultures to be
resent prior to discharge today and would be followed up by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6109**].  The Port-A-Cath was removed.  Surgery was
following initially.  Since he had a peripherally inserted
central catheter line placed for continuous antibiotic
infusion; specifically foscarnet.  So, his transthoracic
echocardiogram was negative since he has been admitted to
rule out endocarditis.

2.  DIARRHEA AND BLOATING ISSUES:  In terms of his diarrhea
and bloating, abrupt drop off in stools after Imodium.  There
was a KUB done that showed no megacolon and no obstruction.
Actually, his abdominal pain had resolved since, and no more
complaints since, and stable on discharge date.

3.  QUESTIONABLE PNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII PNEUMONIA ISSUES:
There was concern for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia
initially given the cough.  There were questionable chest
x-ray findings and desaturation on the evening of admission,
but negative for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia since
admission.  Induced sputum results were positive for
Klebsiella, and respiratory cultures were pending but were
negative so far for that.  Now off prednisone and pentamidine
on the day of discharge.  Since he has been here he got
those.  Now switched off for prophylaxis to dapsone.

4.  HYPOXIA ISSUES:  In terms of his hypoxia, has resolved
since.  For him to continue a 2-week course.  He has eight
more days of ceftriaxone intravenously which he is going to
be continuing at home through [**Hospital6 407**].

5.  ACUTE RENAL FAILURE ISSUES:  In terms of his acute renal
failure, he has resolving acute renal failure.  He initially
came in with 1.5.  On discharge, it was 1.1.  His medications
were renally dosed; specifically, foscarnet renally dosed.

6.  CYTOMEGALOVIRUS RETINITIS ISSUES:  In terms of his
cytomegalovirus retinitis, he was continued on his renal dose
of foscarnet.  He had an eye examination done which showed
active cytomegalovirus retinitis.  Recommendations to
continue foscarnet.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6109**] (his human immunodeficiency
virus doctor) was informed and recommended to continue the
same dose once he was discharged.  The patient to continue
with that.  He has close followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6109**] once he is
discharged from here.
