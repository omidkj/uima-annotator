Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath and chest discomfort


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2148-5-24**]
1. Coronary artery bypass graft x4:  Left internal mammary
    artery to left anterior descending artery, and saphenous
    vein grafts to posterior descending artery and diagonal
    and obtuse marginal arteries.
2. Endoscopic harvesting of the long saphenous vein.


History of Present Illness:
75 year old male with hyperlipidemia, GERD, diastolic
dysfunction, who underwent cardiac catheterization in [**2137**] for
angina symptoms. He was found to have mild to moderate CAD with
a 70% ostial D2 and a 90% mid vessel. His OM1 had a 70% lesion.
His RCA was diffusely diseased with a 50% mid an 80% distal. He
opted for medical management and has done quite well. He has
been exercising regularly walking up to 3 miles daily.
Approximately 2 weeks ago he noted some mild shortness of breath
while climbing stairs. This would resolve with rest. He also
noted some mild chest discomfort with exertion that also would
resolve with rest. This also occured during his daily 3 mile
walk. He stopped exercising and contact[**Name (NI) **] his doctor. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 8783**]t a nuclear stress test which was positive for lateral
wall ischemia and LV dilation at peak exercise. His
Toprol and Lisinopril where increased. He also reports a
constant "odd feeling" in the left side of his neck that does
not change with exertion or position. He has discussed this
concern with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4469**]. He was referred for cardiac
catheterization and was found to have three vessel cornoary
artery disease and was referred to cardiac surgery for
revascularization.

[**2148-5-24**] TEE
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. A patent foramen ovale is present. A
left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at
rest. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
normal free wall contractility. There are simple atheroma in the
aortic root. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
POST CPB:
1. Preserved bo-ventricular systolic function
2. No change in valve structure or function
3. Intact aorta

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
operating room on [**2148-5-24**] where the patient underwent coronary
artery bypass graft x4: Left internal mammary
artery to left anterior descending artery, and saphenous vein
grafts to posterior descending artery and diagonal and obtuse
marginal arteries. Overall the patient tolerated the procedure
well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. POD 1 found the
patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.
The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable
on no inotropic or vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was
initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward the
preoperative weight.  He did have an increase in creatinine from
1.0-->1.5 and Lasix was changed to oral.  Creatinine was back to
baseline at the time of discharge. The patient was transferred
to the telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes and
pacing wires were discontinued without complication.  The
patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge
on POD 4 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was
healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The
patient was discharged home with visiting nurse services in good
condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
