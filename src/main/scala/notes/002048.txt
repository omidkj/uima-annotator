Chief Complaint:
SAH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right Extenral Ventricular drain


History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 80 yo F with hx of HTN/HL who presents with
headache as transfer from OSH with SAH.  Per patient, yesterday
she had the abrupt onset of posterior/occipital HA at around 5pm
that lasted 30 minutes and then resolved on own.  No associated
neurological changes with headache.  Today, at around 4pm she
had
again the sudden onset of posterior/occipital HA with radiation
down neck.  This time the headache was much more severe and
associated with a worsening of her baseline tinnitus.  No N/V.
No weakness or numbness sensation.  No visual changes.  She was
taken to an OSH where a CT head was performed which showed a SAH
in the basal cistern without hydrocephalus. She was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for Neurosurgical evaluation.  Neuro exam at OSH on
presentation intact with baseline L facial droop.

Pertinent Results:
[**2130-5-16**] CTA Head/Neck:
1. Hemorrhage in the collicular cister with extension into the
ventricles is likely secondary to ruptured AVM in the cerebellar
vermis.
2. 17-mm x 11 mm arteriovenous malformation with high-flow
feeding from the bilateral posterior cerebral and superior
cerebellar arteries and draining into the deep cerebral venous
system.
3. 2-mm left cavernous ICA aneurysm.
4. No evidence of an acute infarction.

[**2130-5-17**] CT Head:
No evidence for hydrocephalus, with grossly stable
intraventricular and small subarachnoid hemorrhage.

[**5-17**] Cerebral Angiogram - 1. Mrs. [**Known lastname 8029**] underwent diagnostic
cerebral angiogram which demonstrates an arteriovenous
malformation within the anterior superior cerebellum
predominantly supplied by the bilateral superior cerebellar
arteries and to a lesser extent the right PICA and left
AICA-PICA complex. There may be a questionable 1.5- 2mm aneurysm
at the anterior aspect of the arteriovenous malformation
immediately adjacent to the nidus. Venous drainage is central,
to the straight sinus without stenosis or aneurysm. No active
extravasation of contrast demonstrated.

2. 3-mm broad-based aneurysm along the posterior wall of the
proximal
cavernous left internal carotid artery.
3. Short segment of corrugated appearance of the left distal
cervical
internal carotid artery wall without flow-limiting stenosis may
represent a short segment of fibromuscular dysplasia.
4. Severe tortuosity of the cervical vessels noted. This anatomy
may
complicate future intervention.

[**2130-5-18**] CT head:
1. New focus of left parietal subarachnoid hyperdensity and
increased
hyperdense material layering in the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**], which
may represent redistribution of blood products, but slight new
hemorrhage cannot be excluded.
2. Evolving blood products in the third and fourth ventricles,
aqueduct and foramina of Luschka without evidence for
hydrocephalus.

[**5-18**] CT Head repeat - 1. Interval development of hydrocephalus
compared to seven hours prior, with new dilation of the lateral
and third ventricles, likely secondary to hemorrhage within the
fourth ventricle.

2. No definite evidence of new intracranial hemorrhage. Some
redistribution of blood products into the right occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**]
is noted.

[**5-19**] CT Head - no change
[**5-20**] Ct head - no change

MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST [**2130-5-23**]
1. Multiple areas of small acute infarctions involving the left
centrum
semiovale, parasagittal frontal cortex, splenium of corpus
callosum, and
posterior midbrain.

2. Interval reduction in the size of ventricles and stable
position of the
right transfrontal ventriculostomy catheter.

3. Hemorrhage in the superior vermis with blood products from
ruptured AVM


Brief Hospital Course:
80F who presented after a sudden onset of headache, CT revealed
a SAH at the OSH and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. A CTA was
performed which showed a question of a venous anomaly in the
cerebellar vermis. She was admitted to the Neuro ICU under
Neurosurgery. She was started on Nimodipine and Keppra. She was
monitored closely overnight, as patient was becoming more
lethargic. The family had expressed that if she decompensated,
they did not want to intubate and would want DNR/DNI.

A repeat head CT was done on [**5-17**] which showed no evidence for
hydrocephalus, with grossly stable intraventricular and small
subarachnoid hemorrhage. An Angiogram was recommended and they
reversed the DNI order for procedures. She was intubated for an
angiogram with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. and this showed an AVM possibly being
fed by left SCA aneurysm. She was not able to be extubated and
she was trasnfered to the SICU intubated. On [**5-18**] she was
following commands and opening eyes. The SICU felt that her left
side was weaker and she had a CT which was stable. Her exam did
not improve however and an EVD was placed.

On, [**5-19**] CT of the head showed that the lateral ventreicles were
slightly smaller and the EVD was lowered to 10 and pulled back
2cm. She had some decreased Sats to 90 with decreased breathe
sounds at the right anterior lung base with suggestion of right
middle lobe consolidation on CXR. She also had some thick
secretions and sputum cultures were sent. She required Lasix
20mg. CPAP was increased. Her PICC line was malpositioned
ordered IR
to reposition, will do monday so PICC used as mid-line for now.
pt became oliguric in afternoon and required IVF bolus, started
LR @ 75 w/ good response
On [**5-18**] pt had a brief rise in ICP to 28 after turning and
repeat CT showed no new hemorrhage.  A CXR on [**5-21**] RLL
infiltrate and a Bronchoscopy was performed w/ no secretions for
BAl, and results came back + for MRSA.  On [**5-22**], Vancomycin
started for MRSA in sputum/VAP. Rhythmic twitching of LUE noted,
concerning for seizur
