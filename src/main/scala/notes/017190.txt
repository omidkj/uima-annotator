Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4327**]
Chief Complaint:
RCA [**First Name3 (LF) **], bradycardia, AMS

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
66 y.o woman with past medical history significant only for
hypertension who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] hospital for
management of her RV [**Hospital3 **].  In brief, the patient initially
began feeling unwell on [**5-11**] with symptoms, of nausea, vomiting
and subsequently increasing lethargy.  She first presented to
[**Hospital3 **] hospital on [**5-13**], when she was found to have ST segment
elevations on her EKG and was found to have an inferior MI.
.
The patient was taken to the cath lab where a complete occlusion
of her RCA was found, and 4 bare metal stents were placed with
restoration of TIMI 3 flow.  Her initial echocardiogram
demonstrated RV free wall hypokinesis but preserved LV ejection
fraction.  Right heart cath at that time demonstrated slightly
elevated right atrial pressures.
.
While initially stable, she subsequently declined
hemodynamically and was managed with fluid resuscitation and
lasix in an intermittent fashion.  She was found to have a
[**Month/Year (2) **], and a GI workup including RUQ ultrasound, HIDA
and CT abdomen was negative.  Repeat echocardiogram demonstrated
severe hypokinesis of the RV with enlargement with severe
tricuspid insufficinecy; her [**Month/Year (2) **] was subsequently
thought be secondary to congestive hepatopathy.
.
On the day of transfer on [**2161-5-18**], the patient suffered an R-on-T
phenomenon that caused ventricular fibrillation.  K was 3.1 and
Mg was 1.7 at the time, which were repleted.  She was
defibrillated to SVT with 1 to 1 conduction, and later 2 to 1
conduction with a right atrial focus.  She then developed
episodes of v-tach that responded to lidocaine, in addition to
amiodarone that had previously been started.  Her rhythm later
changed to sinus bradycardia or junctional rhythm, and she was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.  Of note, just prior to
transfer she was noted by family to be quite incomprehensible
with an altered mental status.  This was probably a result of
lidocaine toxicity.
.
On arrival, the patient denied any complaints.  She denied chest
pain, palpitations or shortness of breath.  The family observed
her to be much more interactive from the time she left [**Hospital3 **]
hospital, and while bradycardic she was hemodynamically stable.

EKG: Sinus bradycardia at ~50, mild residual ST elevations in
III, aVF
.
CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
radiographs: Cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged. Hazy
opacification over the both lower lungs, probably due to
dependent pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis. Upper
lungs are clear. No pneumothorax.
.
STRESS: INTERPRETATION: This 66 year old woman s/p IMI and s/p
PCI to the RCA on [**2161-5-13**] and VT/VF arrest on [**2161-5-18**] was
referred to the lab for
evaluation. The patient exercised for 11 minutes of a modfied
[**Doctor Last Name 4001**]
protocol and stopped for fatigue. The estimated peak MET
capacity was
4.3 which represents a fair functional capacity for her age. No
arm,
neck, back or chest discomfort was reported by the patient
throuughout
the study. There were no significant ST segment changes during
exercise
or in recovery. The rhythm was sinus with occasional isolated
apbs and
rare isolated vpbs. Blunted HR and BP response to exercise and
recovery
on beta blocker therapy that was held today.
IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or ischemic EKG changes.
Echo
report sent separately.
.
STRESS ECHO:
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid
regurgitation.] There is abnormal diastolic septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume
overload. There is partial flail of a tricuspid valve septal
leaflet. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen.
.
The patient exercised for 11 minutes 0 seconds according to an
modified [**Doctor Last Name 4001**] treadmill protocol (4.3 METS) reaching a peak
heart rate of 85 bpm and a peak blood pressure of 168/78 mmHg.
The test was stopped at the patient's request. This level of
exercise represents a fair exercise tolerance for age. In
response to stress, the ECG showed equivocal/borderline ischemic
ST wave changes (see exercise report for details). There was a
blunted heart rate response to stress. The blood pressure
response to stress was blunted.
.
Resting images were acquired at a heart rate of 64 bpm and a
blood pressure of 168/80 mmHg. These demonstrated regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal inferior
aneurysm/dyskinesis and severe hypokinesis of the rest of the
inferior free wall. The remaining segments contracted well.
There is no pericardial effusion. Doppler demonstrated
mild-to-moderate (posteriorly directed) mitral regurgitation
with no aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation or significant
resting LVOT gradient.
Echo images were acquired within 49 seconds after peak stress at
heart rates of 84 - 78 bpm. These demonstrated persistence o0f
baseline abnormalities but no definite new wall motion
abnormalities.
.
IMPRESSION: fair functional exercise capacity. borderline ECG
changes with 2D echocardiographic evidence of prior inferior
myocardial infarct but no definite evidence of residual
ischemia.


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 66 y.o woman who is transferred from [**Location (un) 21541**] hospital with a RV [**Location (un) **] s/p 4 BMS, bradycardia and RV
failure with evidence of congestive hepatopathy.  The patient is
also s/p v-fib arrest and successful resuscitation.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
#RV [**Name (NI) **] - Pt had symptoms beginning [**5-11**], however delayed
presentation to the hospital until [**5-13**], at which point she
underwent cardiac catheterization with successful
revascularization and placement of BMSx4 in the RCA.  Post-cath
EKG revealed residual mild ST-segment elevations in the inferior
