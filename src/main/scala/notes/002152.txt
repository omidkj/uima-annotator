Brief Hospital Course:
63 y/o female with NASH cirrhosis, c/b portal hypertension,
grade [**2-9**] esophageal varices s/p TIPS, encephalopathy, recurrent
pleural effusions requiring weekly thoracentesis, and ESRD on HD
who was admitted with GI Bleed.
.
# UGIB:  Has h/o NASH cirrhosis c/b varicies s/p banding and EGD
2 weeks prior with severe portal hypertensive gastropathy vs.
GAVE syndrome. Presented with melenotic stools and hematocrit
drop unresponsive to transfusion. EGD showed clotted blood and
known varices/gastropathy with no active bleeding. ? oozing from
gastropathy. Hct stablelized after 2 units pRBCs and was called
out of the ICU to the medicine floor. PPI was continued.
.
Dyspnea: Likely related to reaccumulating pleural effusion.
Required 2 thoracentesis procedures on the medicine service
prior to [**Month/Day (2) **]. Fluid was exudative by lights criteria and
cultures were negative. Likely related to underlying liver
disease. She received one tap for 1 liter post op and has
otherwise been stable.
.
# Fever: Patient was intermittently febrile while on the
medicine service prior to [**Month/Day (2) **]. Culture data and c diff
toxin were unrevealing. She was placed on Vanco and Zosyn
empirically from [**7-15**] to [**7-21**] until [**Month/Year (2) **] for presumed HAP,
but no adequate sputum could be obtained. She had one episode of
fever post [**Month/Year (2) **] that was related to a Klebsiella UTI which
was treated with Zosyn x 5 days, she remained afebrile through
the rest of hospitalizations.
.
# ESRD: Prior to [**Month/Year (2) **], was on TTS HD schedule. Received
liver/kidney [**Month/Year (2) **].Because she was highly sensitized, she
received plasmapheresis and thymoglobulin. The creatinine was
down to 0.6 by time of [**Month/Year (2) **].
.
# NASH Cirrhosis: On the medicine service, patient was continued
on lactulose, rifaximin, midodrine, ursodiol, nadolol and
bactrim DS for SBP prophylaxis prior to [**Month/Year (2) **]. She received
a combined liver and kidney [**Month/Year (2) **] on [**7-21**] (extending
into [**7-22**]) She was taken to the OR with Drs [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 816**].
The liver surgery consisted of Orthotopic deceased donor liver
[**Name5 (PTitle) **], piggyback,
portal vein to portal vein anastomosis, common hepatic artery
donor to proper hepatic artery recipient, common bile duct to
common bile duct anastomosis with no T-tube. Splenectomy was
also done to assist with increased PRA for the kidney.
Post operatively her liver enzymes returned to [**Location 213**] very soon
after surgery and remained stable throughtout the
hospitalization. She received routine immunosuppression to
include Cellcept and Prograf as well as the induction Thymo and
solumedrol with plasmapheresis for the highly sensitzed kidney.
She also received IVIg x 3 doses.
.
Nutrition: Patient will continue on tube feeds. Her appetite has
improved over the course of the h
