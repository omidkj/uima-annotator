Chief Complaint:
Aortic stenosis, CHF and lower GI bleed


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catherization

History of Present Illness:
77 year old woman tranferred from the [**Hospital 1474**] hospital for
consideration of aortic valve replacement. Admitted to the
[**Hospital1 1474**] on [**2-14**] with UTI sepsis, pneumonia and colitis after
presenting a syncopal episode.  Her BP was found to be 60/palp.
She was given IVFs and antibiotics and transferred to the CCU.
She suffered a PEA arrest and was briefly intubated, but was
extubated within a few hours per her family.  She underwent a
Echocardiogram that revelaed AS with a valve area of 0.7 and and
abdominal imaging that revealed a 4.2 cm AA. She was evaluated
by Vascular surgery, but was not felt to be a surgical
candidate. Patient had multiple episodes of abdominal pain and
bloody diarrhea following an episode of PEA arrest. CT showed an
area of colon consistent with inflammation / infection /
ischaemia and a fusiform aortic anneurysm. She was treated with
multiple antibiotic regimens while at [**Hospital1 1474**]. Her course was
also complicated by acute on chronic renal faily with creatinine
up to 3.7 but back to 1.4-1.6 by discharge.

On aspirin for many years, but denies any other NSAID use
recently.
Bowels have settled down over the past week. Currently no pain
in the abdomen. Had 2 bowel movements today - semi solid maroon
stool, guaiac positive.  Last colonoscopy 3-4 years ago at
[**Hospital1 1474**]. Reportedly removed polyps. Denies CP, SOB, dizziness
and breathing feels improved.

On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors
prior to admission to OSH. She denies exertional buttock or calf
pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.

Past Medical History:
COPD
CKD with baseline creatinine around 2.0
AS  valve area 0.6 cm
DM2 - but denies formal diagnosis of this
Hypothyroidism
[**2135**] - primary lung carcinoma T2M0N0. Excised, no recurrence.
[**2135**] - left hip replacement
[**2133**] - right total hip replacement x2

Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use, quit 9 years ago, denies drug use, occasional wine. There
is no history of alcohol abuse.

ADMISSION EKG: NSR rate 93, nl axis, PVC, biphasic T waves in
V2-V6, nl intervals.

[**2137-2-26**] TTE:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the basal inferior and
inferolateral walls. The remaining walls contract normally and
overall EF is preserved.. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a
normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There
are simple atheroma in the aortic root The ascending aorta is
0.6 cm2). Mild to moderate ([**1-16**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**1-16**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. The pulmonic valve leaflets are
thickened. No pericardial effusion seen.  IMPRESSION: Severe
aortic stenosis (0.6 cm). Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.
Moderate symmetric LVH with mild regional LV dysfunction but
overall preserved function. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.

[**2-25**] CXR: There are new bilateral interstitial opacities and
peribronchial cuffing, more striking on the right than left,
since [**2136-10-18**]. The appearance is most suggestive of
interstitial pulmonary edema, arising in the setting of
underlying emphysema. The patient also has known subpleural
fibrosis, better characterized on a prior CT from [**2136-4-19**].
Small bilateral pleural effusions are also present.  The patient
is status post CABG, and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm
appears unchanged.

[**2137-3-2**] Tagged RBC Study:
No evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding

[**2137-3-4**] Colonoscopy:
Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and descending colon upto
40cm (area reached).  Erythema, congestion and ulceration
involving 2/3rd of circumference in the distal descending colon(
at 40cm)-- findings highly suggestive of ischemic colitis


Brief Hospital Course:
SEVERE AORTIC STENOSIS

Ms. [**Known lastname 3549**] has severe AS with a valve area of 0.6, as well as
mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.  Given her ischemic bowel
(see below), she was not considered an acute surgery candidate.
A temporizing aortic valvuloplasty was considered on [**2137-3-7**]
with the hopes that she would be eligible for AVR in several
weeks to months once her gut has stablized. The cardiac
catheterization showed a mean gradient of 23mmHg across valve
hence no valvuloplasty was performed. Throughout her
hospitalization, she required large volumes of IVF (and briefly
levophed pressor support) to maintain blood pressures, but she
maintained her oxygen saturation and did not require mechanical
ventillation at any point.  Aortic valvuloplasty was considered
to help heal mesenteric ischemia. However, during her repeat
cardiac catheterization her AV gradient was measured using an
aortic catheter and an LV catheter via a transeptal approach
which showed less severe gradient than on ECHO.  Therefore, no
valvuloplasty was pursued and valve replacement was not
currently recommended given significant operative risk.

GI BLEED

Ms. [**Known lastname 3549**] was admitted from the OSH with active lower GI
bleeding, requiring multiple blood transfusions to maintain her
hematocrit.  Abdominal CT from the OSH was concerning for
ischemic colitis.  At [**Hospital1 18**], the GI service was consulted and
performed a tagged RBC study on [**2137-3-2**], which showed no active
bleeding.  Despite his, she continued to have bloody stools and
decreasing hematocrit.  A colonoscopy was performed on [**2137-3-4**],
which showed erythema, congestion and ulceration of the
descending colon, consistent with ischemic colitis.  By [**2137-3-5**],
her bleeding stopped and her hematocrit had stabilized.  The GI
surgery service followed Ms. [**Known lastname 3
