shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2165-7-13**] Re-exploration of mediastinum for cardiac tamponade


History of Present Illness:
34M with aortic insufficiency & aortic stenosis c/b
recurrent endocarditis s/p multiple repeat aortic valve
rreplacements, most recently on [**2165-6-12**] with a 19-mm Onyx
mechanical valve & replacement of ascending aorta/hemiarch with
a
26-mm Dacron graft. He presented ~two weeks post-op with
pericardial tamponade secondary to hemopericardium requiring
re-operation and evacuation of pericardial hematoma. He was
doing
relatively well since discharge with the exception of persistent
mild [**2165-1-19**] anterior chest pain and R sub-scapular pain.

Last night was abruptly awakened from sleep with acute dyspnea
and increase in his chest pain to [**7-27**], similar to his
symptomatic pain during his episode of tamponade. He was
evaluated in the ED at [**Hospital1 18**] and cardiac surgery is being
consulted for concerns about his R pleural effusion.


Past Medical History:

MSSA s/p tissue AVR [**9-23**], s/p redo sternotomy, homograft redo
aortic valve and aortic root replacement with reimplantation of
coronary arteries ([**2161-9-29**]); MSSA bacteremia with recurrent
endocarditis in [**8-25**], endocarditis [**1-27**] following angioplasty of
stenotic arteriovenous fistula; CHF (systolic and diastolic
dysfunction, EF55%); B subclavian vein, left IJ and left
Brachiocephalic thromboses s/p brachiocephalic vein stent, HTN,
chronic low back pain, hyperlipidemia, chronic fatigue syndrome,

pyloric stenosis


Social History:

other family hx of renal disease, no DM or other CA in the
family

Pertinent Results:
Conclusions
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is
unusually small. A mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is
present. There is right atrial and right ventricular collapse
which appears mechanical by nature -- a clot appears to be
compressing on both [**Doctor Last Name 1754**]. There is significant, accentuated
respiratory variation in mitral valve inflow, consistent with
impaired ventricular filling.

IMPRESSION: A mechanical compression by what appears to be a
clot on right atrium ventricle with mitral inflow pattern
compatible with tamponade physiology.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted on [**7-12**] for hypotension after dialysis. Developed
tamponade and was taken to the OR for mediastinal exploration
and evacuation of clot, and drainage of left plerural effusion
by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**7-13**]. Transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition. Followed by nephrology. Extubated later that day.
Transferred to the floor on POD # 2 to begin increasing his
activity level. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] does not want coumadin or heparin
for his mechanical valve for one month. He is to remain on
aspirin therapy. He had continuing chest tube output that
delayed his discharge for several days.  Chest tubes were
discontinued on [**2165-7-21**].  Follow up chest x-rays revealed a
stable hydropneumothorax on the right.  The patient was
discharged to home on POD 10, after dialysis, with appropriate
follow-up instructions.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] has ordered the patient to
stay off of coumadin until [**2165-9-12**].
