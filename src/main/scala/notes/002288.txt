History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 15499**] is a 60 year old male with a very complicated past
medical history. He was recently diagonosed with Enterococcal
and Klebsiella bactermia. This was further complicated by
Enterococcal mitral valve endocarditis and septic emboli to
central nervous system, spleen and lungs. Cardiac surgery was
delayed at that time due to increased risk of bleeding secondary
to central nervous system emboli. While undergoing intravenous
antibiotic therapy, he started to experience progressive
symptoms of an ischemic right leg with 4-5 days of purple and
cool right foot with pain on ambulation. He was subsequently
admitted for right below knee amputation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 15499**] was initially admitted to the Vascular service. The
renal, infectious disease and cardiac surgery services were
subsequently consulted to participate in medical/surgical
management. The day after admission, Mr. [**Known lastname 15499**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a
right below knee amputation by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] of the Vascular
Service. He tolerated the procedure and there were no
complications. He remained on Ampicillin and Gentamicin for his
MV endocarditis while hemodialysis was continued. The renal
service recommended to discontinue the Cellcept and Cyclosporine
and initiate Prednisone in anticipation of upcoming cardiac
surgery. Cellcept and Cyclosporine will not need to be resumed
in the future as his renal transplant graft has already failed.
Mr. [**Known lastname 15499**] otherwise remained stable on medical therapy.
Further cardiac evaluation included blood and urine cultures
with repeat transthoracic echocardiogram. Blood cultures
remained negative while echocardiogram showed a slightly smaller
mitral valve vegetation(compared to [**2187-8-24**] ECHO) with
moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Overall left
ventricular function was normal and his aortic valve was
bicuspid. No aortic stenosis or regurgitation was seen. Initial
urine culture revealed yeast. His urine culture cleared
following treatment with Fluconazole. He was eventually cleared
by the ID service to proceed with cardiac surgery. On [**10-15**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed a mitral valve replacement. The
operation was uneventful and he was brought to the CSRU for
invasive monitoring. For further surgical details, please see
seperate dictated operative note. Within 24 hours, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated without incident. His
postoperative course was complicated by complete heart block.
The EP service was consulted. His complete heart block persisted
and Mr. [**Known lastname 15499**] eventually [**Known lastname 1834**] placement on permanent
pacemaker on [**10-19**]. He maintained stable hemodynamics and
eventually transferred to the SDU. The [**Last Name (un) **] service was
consulted to assist in the management of his poorly controlled
diabetes mellitus. The ID and renal services continued to follow
him throughout his postoperative course. Antibiotics were
continued and titrated according to levels. He remained on
Prednisone for immunosuppression. Mr. [**Known lastname 15499**] gradually made
clinical improvements and worked with physical and occupational
therapies to improve strength and mobility. He was eventually
cleared for discharge to rehab on postoperative day nine. At
discharge, he will cotinue to require a total of four weeks of
intravenous antibiotics from the date of surgery - last dose
should be on [**2187-11-12**].
