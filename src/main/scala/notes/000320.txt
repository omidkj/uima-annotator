RADIOLOGY  Final Report
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2132-4-1**] 9:01 AM
FINDINGS: There is no significant interval change in the
appearance of the present noncontrast head CT scan compared to
the prior [**Hospital3 **] study of [**2131-11-11**], as well as the
outside study from [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital. There is no sign for
the presence of a visible intracranial mass lesion. Both studies
show slightly asymmetric atrophy of the cerebellum, more evident
in the region of the right cerebellar hemisphere. Images of the
cerebellum, at this time, are moderately degraded by patient
motion. In any case, visualization of the MR- described
cavernous hemangioma would be extremely difficult, given its
reported small size and typically limited visibility on a
noncontrast head CT scan. The surrounding osseous and soft
tissue structures show no additional abnormalities.
CONCLUSION: No interval change from prior study of [**2131-11-11**]. In view of the questions you have raised in the history,
kindly forward the original report of the [**Hospital3 417**]
Hospital CT scan for our independent review.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS  [**2132-4-3**] 8:11 AM
CT ANGIOGRAM FINDINGS:
The main right and left, lobar and proximal segmental pulmonary
arteries are widely patent and appear normal, no evidence of
acute pulmonary embolus. At the peripheral segmental level the
contrast opacification is slightly suboptimal.
Normal heart size and central pulmonary arterial vasculature.
Normal caliber thoracic aorta.
Patient is status post right upper lobectomy. Small right
posterior basal pleural effusion. Partial atelectasis of the
medial segment of the right middle lobe.
Patchy consolidation in the posterior aspect of the right lower
lobe also patchy airspace consolidation in the posterior portion
of left lower lobe. There is associated increased ground-glass
attenuation in these areas more marked on the left lung.
Differential possibilities include aspirational pneumonia.
Although the appearances were asymmetric, worse on the left
side, asymmetric pulmonary oedema is also a consideration.
However, the nondependent interlobular septae in the right lung
do not appear thickened at present.
Minor area of residual localized pneumothorax in the central
medial thorax.
No bone lesions demonstrated.
In the arterial phase scan, there is an ill-defined area of
hypodensity in the posteromedial aspect of segment VII (series
4, image 100) which remains unchanged in size compared to prior
CT of [**2131-11-12**].
CONCLUSION:
1. No acute pulmonary embolus demonstrated.
2. Extensive patchy consolidation in the left lung and posterior
aspect of the remaining right lower lobe with associated
ground-glass attenuation in those areas. Differential
considerations include aspiration pneumonia possibly with some
associated and asymmetric pulmonary edema. Small localized right
posterior basal pleural effusion.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2132-4-8**] 11:02 AM
The patient is status post partial resection of the right lung
with volume loss and a persistent small right apical
pneumothorax. The heart is normal in size. There are bibasilar
areas of consolidation, left greater than right, which appear
worsened in the interval. Small right pleural effusion is
without change.
IMPRESSION:
1. Evolving bibasilar pneumonia.
2. Small right apical pneumothorax.

Bronchial lavage [**2132-4-4**]:
  ATYPICAL.
  Rare isolated atypical cells, can not exclude malignancy.
  Neutrophils, histiocytes and red blood cells.

DIAGNOSIS:
I.  Parietal pleura (A):
Fragments of lung and pleura with focal fibrosis.
Note:  By immunohistochemistry, the aggregates of cells present
are negative for cytokeratin cocktail (AE1/AE3, CAM5.2), S-100,
HMB-45, and MART-1.  Calretinin is weakly positive in the
mesothelial cells present.
II.  Right upper lobe, wedge resection (B-J):
Malignant melanoma (1.0 cm), see note.
Note:  Sections show a monotypic population of atypical spindled
and epithelioid cells with prominent nucleoli, arranged in
nodules and small nests.  By immunohistochemistry, these cells
are positive for S-100 and MART-1; they are negative for
cytokeratin cocktail, 34BE12
