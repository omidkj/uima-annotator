[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
77 year old man with aortic pseudaneurysm and pacer with
positive blood cultures
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please evaluate for enlarging aortic pseudaneurysmPlease do I
minus study
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: Please do without contrast

INDICATION: Aortic arch pseudoaneurysm. The patient with
positive blood cultures.

TECHNIQUE: Axial noncontrast CT imaging of the chest. Comparison
is made with CT of the chest performed on [**2139-2-16**].

CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is a large soft tissue
density consistent with a hematoma adjacent to the lateral
aspect of the aortic arch, which measures approximately 5.6 x
3.7 cm. On the prior examination of [**2139-2-16**] this periaortic
hematoma measured approximately 3.6 x 1.7 cm. There is apparent
disruption of calcification along the lateral contour of the
aorta that is new when compared to the prior examination of
[**2139-2-16**] seen best on (series 2, image 21). There is an
significantly increased size of a left-sided pleural effusion.
The pleural fluid on the left measures approximately 20
Hounsfield unit. A small left-sided pneumothorax was seen on the
prior examination with the left- sided pleural fluid measuring
approximately 40 Hounsfield units. A small right-sided pleural
effusion appears unchanged. Multiple calcified pleural plaques
are seen bilaterally. The heart is enlarged with a pacemaker in
place. The stomach is dilated and fluid fills the lower
esophagus. Likely atelectasis is present within the left lung
base. No pulmonary nodules are seen. No pericardial effusion is
seen.

In the visualized portions of the upper abdomen, a distended
stomach is seen. The spleen and visualized portion of the liver
are within normal limits. There are dense nephrograms seen
bilaterally. A stone versus retained contrast is seen within the
mid left kidney.

Bone windows show no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.

IMPRESSION:

1) Increased size of a mediastinal hematoma adjacent to the
patient's known aortic arch pseudoaneurysm. This finding cannot
be further evaluated without IV contrast; however, however, this
suggests worsening of mediastinal hemorrhage.

2) Increased size of left-sided pleural effusion with associated
Hounsfield units of 20. This finding could represent a reactive
pleural effusion or subacute hemothorax given the presence of
blood within the pleural space on the prior CT of [**2139-2-16**].

3) Dense bilateral nephrograms presumably reflecting contrast
nephropathy in the absence of recent contrast administration.

4) Calcified pleural plaques are consistent with prior asbestos
exposure.

These findings were discussed with the clinical team responsible
for this patient's care at the time of interpretation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to surgery found pseudoaneurysm/contained aortic
rupture at aortic arch, treated for low hct withtransfusion,
found to have high wbc and was cultured. As the lesion was not
suitable for surgery in this patient with multiple
co-morbidities, pt was transferred to the CCU team for medical
management.  Treated for pseudoaneurysm with bp control, blood
cultures here with SA (MRSA in blood in past) tx with Linezolid
as "allergic" to Vancomycin. Concern for mycotic aneurysm v.
endocarditis, TTE negative, TEE planned for am. Pacer felt to be
unlikely source and considering CT abdomen with contrast once
renal function improves to evaluated possibility that bifem
graft is site of infection.  Pt developed more horseness - ENT
consulted and found some paralysis of left vocal cord,
consistent with left recurrent laryngeal nerve compression
Repeat CT was obtained as this new horseness made the team
concerned for growth of pseudoaneurysm.  This showed that the
previously observed hematoma adjacent to the aortic
pseudoaneurysm was increasing.
Confirmed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of CT surgery that he is not
operative candidate.  Pt developed hematemesis later in the
night and later expired.
