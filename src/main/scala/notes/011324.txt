Chief Complaint:
Transfer for BiV Pacer placement

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Dual chamber pacer placement

History of Present Illness:
49 year old man with dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF
15-20%, chronic atrial fibrillation who was admitted after
undergoing unsuccessful placement of BiV pacer/ICD at [**Hospital 7912**]. At OSH they were able to place RA/RV leads, but
procedure was complicated by unsuccessful cannulation of
coronary sinus, and development of acute dyspnea thought to be
pulmonary edema. Patient was given nitro gtt, cefazolin 2grams,
lasix 80mg IV lasix in cath lab, amiodarone 400, cozaar 25,
coreg 6.25 given at OSH. Zofran 4mg IVx1. Was on 2L NC prior to
transfer.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], patient was stable and without chest pain
or shortness of breath on 2L NC. Generally patient describes
being symptomatic in his atrial fibrillation. He was able to go
for a 14 mile bike ride this past week, however.
.
At baseline, patient reports 2 pillow orthopnea, no LE edema,
recent weight gain, PND, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

Pertinent Results:
EKG [**10-5**] demonstrated: Sinus rhythm with atrial premature beats
and first degree A-V block. Left bundle-branch block. Compared
to the previous tracing of [**2187-7-13**] atrial fibrillation is absent
and sinus rhythm is now present and atrial premature beats are
new.
.
EKG: atrial fibrillation with LBBB.  ST segments c/w
hyperkalemia, metabolic disturbances.  Precordial leads with ST
Segments > 5mm.
.
HOLTER from [**2187-10-13**] demonstrated:
1. Sinus rhythm from [**Date range (1) 13173**] and AF with controlled
ventricular rate 11-23-12/1/08.
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2188-3-26**] demonstrated:
1.  LV: EF of 20-25%, there was severe hypokinesis of the
anterior, basal-mid anteroseptal, basal-mid anterolateral and
apical walls.  Severe MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 13174**] of flow in portal vein.
Moderate TR.  Low normal systolic function of the RV.  Estimated
PA systolic BP of 35mmHg.
.
OTHER TESTING:

c/w aspiration pneumonitis/atelectasis.  Less likely pneumonia.

significant volume overload, enlarged cardiac silhouette.
.
LABORATORY DATA: OSH data notable for
Cr 1.0, BUN 29, Na 143, K 4.2, CO2 29, Cl 106, T. Bili 1.8,

Brief Hospital Course:
49 year old man with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, dual
chamber pacer who was admitted from an OSH for management of
pulmonary edema and BiV pacer upgrade, now s/p epicardial lead
placement, appendage resection, DC cardioversion on [**2188-3-29**].
.
#. Pump/Dilated Cardiomyopathy (Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart
Failure): EF 15%.  The pt was transfered from an OSH for
inability to canulate the coronary sinus and for presumed
pulmonary edema during pacemaker placement. Initially the pt was
monitored in the CCU, and then on [**2188-3-29**] the pt had a left mini
thoracotomy with an insertion of two epicardial left ventricular
pacing leads. The pt tolerated the procedure well, and
post-procedure Coumadin was restarted. The pt c/o nausea and
anorexia, but otherwise denies sx on ROS. The pt's home
carvedilol, losartan, digoxin and lasix were continued.
.
#. Rate/Afib: On admission the pt's INR was therapeutic, and
coumadin was restarted on [**2188-3-29**] post pacer placement. The pt
was continued on home coumadin, aspirin, digoxin, and
amiodarone.
.
# Nausea: The pt complained of nausea post-mini thoracotomy
which was likely secondary to oxycodone versus constipation. The
pt was able to pass flatus, and the KUB was reassuring (stool
present). The nausea improved as oxycodone was stopped and on
discharge the pt was tolerating oral intake.
.
