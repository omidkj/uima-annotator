Chief Complaint:
GI Bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Colonoscopy [**2182-8-28**]


History of Present Illness:
80M w/ MMP including dementia, CAD, chronic Afib, CHF, CRI, and
diverticulosis, who initially presented to OSH with BRBPR. At
[**Hospital **] Hospital, where he had an additional 2 episodes of
BRBPR. BP was 70/palp and NG lavage was reportedly negative, so
he was transfused 4 units PRBCs and 2 units FFP, and given
Vitamin K and 2.5 L NS. Hct was 34 at [**Name (NI) **] (unclear when this
was in relation to transfusions). He had a CT to evaluate his
endovascular AAA repair, which was intact. He was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**2182-8-25**] where SBPs were stable in 90s, HR 80s. Given
Protonix 40mg IV. GI and surgery were consulted and he was
dmitted to the MICU for further care.
.
In the MICU, received 5 units pRBC with last transfusion
yesterday AM. Hct has remained stable x24h. Colonoscopy today
with left and right diverticulosis but no active bleeding. Has
mild O2 requirement thought to be [**2-9**] CHF from multiple
transfusions. Not on ASA or plavix at baseline, unable to
contact PCP as to why, and not on coumadin for Afib [**2-9**] falls.
Given stability, transferred to the floor. Currently feels well.
 States no new issues. No CP/SOB.  No N/V.  No further episodes
of BRBPR
.

[**8-28**] Colonoscopy:
Findings:
 Protruding Lesions A single pedunculated 10 mm non-bleeding
polyp of benign appearance was found in the sigmoid-descending
colon at 40cm. Given recent history of bleeding no polypectomy
was performed. Small non-bleeding grade 1 internal hemorrhoids
were noted.  Excavated Lesions Multiple non-bleeding diverticula
were seen in the sigmoid colon, descending colon and ascending
colon.

No fresh or old blood was seen in the entire colon.

Impression: Left and Right colon diverticulosis
Polyp in sigmoid-descending colon
Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum
Recommendations: No polypectomy performed because of recent
significant bleeding.
Follow-up full colonoscopy at 3 months for elective polypectomy
- patient has been scheduled for [**11-26**] at [**Hospital1 18**]..


Brief Hospital Course:
Studies:

Colonoscopy: Diverticulosis. Pedunculated polyp. No polypectomy.
No active bleeding. Grade 1 hemorrhoids. Will have f/u
colonoscopy on [**2182-11-26**] for polypectomy.

ECG - A-fib @ 72bpm, LAD, nl intervals, +Qs in III,aVF, TWF
diffusely, poor R-wave progression, no prior for comparison
.
CXR ([**8-24**]) - mild cardiomegaly, retrocardiac opacity
(atelectasis vs. infection), normal pulmonary vascularity, small
left pleural effusion
.
OSH CT-scan ([**8-24**]) - (prelim) aortobiiliac stent in place, no
periaortic hematoma; cholelithiasis and suspected CBD stone w/o
e/o cholecystitis; diverticulosis w/o diverticulitis; suspected
nonobstructing right renal calculus.

.
Hospital Course:
.
80-M s/ MMP incl dementia, CAD, chronic Afib, CHF, CRI, and
diverticulosis, p/w multiple episodes of BRBPR with dropping Hct
and HD instability manifesting as hypotension. Now s/p 4units
PRBCs, 2units FFP, Vit K, 3.5L NS, with continued drop in Hct to
30.
.
#. GI bleeding - Pt p/w BRBPR w/ dropping Hct and hypotension.
NG lavage at OSH reportedly negative. CT to eval AAA s/p
endovascular repair reportedly negative. GI scoped [**2182-8-28**].
Results above. On PPI [**Hospital1 **].  Anti-hypertensives were held
initially given hypotension and patient was given gentle
hydration given CHF history.  Patient remained hemodynamically
stable throughout the remainder of his hospital course and was
transferred to the medical floor in stable condition.  He had no
further episodes of bleeding and his HCT remained stable until
discharge.
.
#. Coagulopathy - Pt w/ INR 1.4 on admit, after receiving 2units
FFP and Vit K at OSH. Unclear reason for elevated INR
(?nutritional) but came down slowly throughout admission.  His
final INR on discharge
