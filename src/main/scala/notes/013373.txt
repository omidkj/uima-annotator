HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 58-year old female with a
known history of aortic stenosis and bicuspid aortic valve
had a stroke in [**2120-10-14**]. She was hospitalized here
at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2120-11-13**] for CHF. A recent cath in
preparation for aortic valve replacement was done, and she
also had followup in [**2120-12-14**]. She developed a left
buttock cyst, that was treated with clindamycin x 10 days and
an incision and drainage, which has now resolved.  Cardiac
catheterization performed on [**2120-12-16**] showed mild
coronary artery disease and no LV-gram was done at that time.

RADIOLOGIC STUDIES:  A preoperative chest x-ray showed no

A preoperative EKG showed a sinus rhythm at 80 with a
question of left ventricular hypertrophy.

HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  The patient was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] and
referred for aortic valve replacement. She had an
echocardiogram in [**2120-11-13**] which showed an ascending
aorta of 4.0 cm and arch of 3.1 cm, aortic valve peak
gradient of 97, mean gradient of 57, aortic valve area of 0.5
cm2.

On exam, she is a 5 feet 3 inches, 160 pounds, mildly obese,
anxious woman with no obvious skin disease. Her left buttock
cyst had fully resolved. Her HEENT exam was unremarkable. She
had no JVD. Her murmur radiated to both of her carotids. Her
lungs were clear bilaterally with a rare expiratory wheeze.
Her heart was regular in rate and rhythm with S1 and S2, and
a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard throughout the
precordium. Her abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended
with hypoactive bowel sounds. No hepatosplenomegaly or CVA
tenderness. The extremities were warm and well perfused with
no cyanosis, clubbing, or edema. No varicosities were noted.
She was neurologically grossly intact with a nonfocal exam.
Moving all extremities with 5/5 strength with minimally
decreased fine motor movement in her left first and second
digits.

Th[**Last Name (STitle) 1050**] came into the hospital on [**1-21**] as a same
day admission and underwent aortic valve replacement with Dr.
[**Last Name (Prefixes) **] with a 21-mm pericardial [**Doctor Last Name **] valve. She was
transferred to the cardiothoracic intensive care unit in a
stable condition on an amiodarone drip at 1.

On postoperative day 1, she remained intubated. Her
postoperative labs were as follows. White count of 11.4,
hematocrit of 24.9, platelet count of 109,000, K of 4.5, BUN
of 8, creatinine of 0.7. She was started on aspirin and an
insulin drip and continued on her perioperative vancomycin.
She was weaned to extubation. She was also seen by case
management initially and was extubated later in the day. On
postoperative day 2, her chest tubes were pulled. She was on
a Neo-Synephrine drip at 1.25 with a goal to wean that down
during the day. On postoperative day 3, her Neo-Synephrine
was weaned to off. She was transfused 1 unit. Her hematocrit
rose to 26.7. She was started on ethacrynic acid and Flovent
as well for wheezing with nebulizers. Her cordis remained in
place, and she was transferred out to the floor.

On the floor she began to work with the nurses and physical
therapist about regaining her strength and activity level.
She was hallucinating and over agitated overnight. On
postoperative day 4, she had been started back on her
nortriptyline. Her pacing wires were discontinued. She was
disoriented and somewhat paranoid. Her lab work remained
stable. Hemodynamics were also stable with a blood pressure
of 120/63, with a pulse of 105, in sinus tachycardia. Her
exam was otherwise unremarkable. Psychiatry evaluated her and
recommended stopping all Xanax and benzodiazepines, and
putting her on some Haldol, and doing neurologic checks.
These recommendations were appreciated. The next day she was
much more alert and more appropriate. The patient was feeling
much better. She was hemodynamically stable, saturating 96%
on 3 liters. She was alert. Her heart was regular in rate and
rhythm. The incisions were clean, dry, and intact. She was
doing much better. She continued working with physical
therapy. The one-on-one sitter was discontinued, and
discharge planning was begun. Psychiatry also did a follow-up
evaluation a day later. The patient was no longer confused or
exhibiting any hallucinations.

On postoperative day 6, the day of discharge, she was doing
very well and was discharged to home with VNA services. On
the day of discharge, she was alert and oriented with a
nonfocal neurologic exam. Her lungs were clear bilaterally.
Heart was regular in rate and rhythm. She had no sternal
drainage or erythema. She had positive bowel sounds. Her
extremities were warm with trace edema. All lines had been
discontinued.

stable condition with the following postoperative
