Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2107-6-14**]
1. Mitral valve repair with a P2 triangular resection and ring
annuloplasty using a [**Doctor Last Name **] Physio II ring.
2. Coronary artery bypass grafting x 1 with a left internal

History of Present Illness:
57 year old male with suspected multiple sclerosis and recently
diagnosed severe mitral regurgitiation in [**State 108**] who preseted
with complaints of dyspnea. He recently moved to [**State 108**], when
he developed acute onset of dyspnea, chest pain, and body aches.
On [**5-16**] he went to an outside hospital, and he was found to have
a pneumonia and a new holosystolic murmur. He was admitted for
further work up. He was treated w/ antibiotics (azithromax,
ceftriaxone). Per review of OSH records TTE showed severe
prolapse of the MV posterior leaflet with severe MR, which was
confirmed by TEE that showed ruptured chordae and flailing of
the posterior leaflet. He also had a BAL that showed usual
respiratory flora, was negative for malignancy and negative for
acid fast organisms. Cardiothoracic surgery, cardiology, and
pulmonary were consulted. He declined further intervention and
wanted to have further work up in [**Location (un) 86**]. He left [**State 108**] and
returned to [**Location 86**]. Throughout this time he continued to have
shortness of breath. He he is now being referred to cardiac
surgery for surgical evaluation of mitral valve.

Past Medical History:
-Mitral Regurgitation
-Right third digit finger fracture two years ago
-Asthma (allergy induced)
-Eustachian tube abscess four years prior
-Progressive myelopathy of unknown cause with single episode of
abrupt worsening responding to steroids; probably progressive
relapsing multiple sclerosis.
-Head trauma after falling 20 feet from a deck. Suffered a R
orbital blow out fracture and mandibular fracture. Operated with
insertion of Sigma plates. Residual symptoms of R
esotropia/double vision from entrapment of the extraocular eye
muscles.

[**2107-6-14**], Intra-op TEE Pre-CPB:
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low
normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Torn mitral chordae are present. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 3D views show a flail
P2, with an anteriorly directed jet. There is no pericardial
effusion. Post-CPB: The patient is in SR, on no inotropes.
Preserved biventricular systolic fxn. There is a mitral ring
with no leak and no MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] = 4 mmHg. No AI. Aorta
intact.

[**2107-6-19**] CXR: The patient is status post sternotomy, with sternal
wires and clips and a prosthetic valve. There is mild
cardiomegaly. The aorta is slightly unfolded. There is upper
zone redistribution, without overt CHF. There is a small left
effusion and minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle
with mild-to-moderate bibasilar collapse and/or consolidation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**2107-6-14**] with severe mitral
regurgitation and critical stenosis in the left anterior
descending coronary artery. He was taken to the operating room
on [**6-14**] where he underwent mitral valve repair and coronary
artery bypass grafting x 1. Please see operative note for
details. Immediately post-operatively he was transferred to the
CVICU intubated and sedated on propofol and Phenylephrine. Later
this day he awoke neurologically intact and was weaned and
extubated. Neo was weaned off and he was started on beta
blockers, statin and Lasix. On post-op day one he was
transferred to the step down unit for ongoing post-operative
care. Chest tubes and pacing wires were removed per protocol. He
experienced post-op atrial fibrillation and was treated with
increased beta blockers and amiodarone and converted to sinus
rhythm. He was transfused 2 units PRBC for post-operative anemia
(HCT 22.8, at discharge 28.9). He was evaluated by physical
therapy for strength and conditioning and a brief rehab stay was
recommended prior to his return home. He redeveloped atrial
fibrillation and was started on Coumadin. At time of discharge
he was in rate controlled atrial fibrillation and will need
titration of his Coumadin for a goal INR 2-2.5 (currently 1.1).
On post-op day 7 he was discharged to rehab ([**Location (un) 15852**] at Rye, NY)
with the appropriate medications and follow-up appointments.
