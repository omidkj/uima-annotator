PA AND LATERAL CHEST, [**3-18**]


IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**3-15**] through
10:

Severe left lower lobe atelectasis has improved slightly, and
small left
pleural effusion has decreased. Less severe right lower lobe
atelectasis and
smaller right pleural effusion have remained relatively stable.
There is no
pneumothorax or pulmonary edema. Enlargement of the
postoperative cardiac
silhouette is what one would expect given the preoperative size,
and
unchanged. Right jugular line ends in the upper SVC.

[**3-16**] EKG: Sinus rhythm. Cannot exclude a prior inferior
myocardial infarction.
Poor R wave progression with precordial ST segment elevation.
Cannot exclude
myocardial injury. Clinical correlation is suggested. Compared
to the
previous tracing of [**2141-3-8**] there is loss of R wave in lead aVF.
Precordial
ST segment elevation is new.





Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
operating room on [**2141-3-15**] where the patient underwent aortic
valve replacement with a 21-mm On-X mechanical
valve, replacement of ascending aorta and hemi arch with a 26-
mm Vascutek Dacron tube graft using deep hypothermic circulatory
arrest and reconstruction of pericardium with Core Matrix
product.
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well please see
intraop note for further deatails. She transferred to the CVICU
in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. POD 1
found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing
comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact and
hemodynamically stable initially hypertensive but transitioned
off Nitro and Nicardipine to Beta blockers. She transferred to
the floor on POD #2. She was gently diuresed and remained stable
on the floor. Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued
without complication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical
therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility.  She
was started on anticoagulation and her INR was therapeutic at
discharge.Her PCP will manage her coumadin therapy. She was
ambulating freely, her wounds were healing and pain was
controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged to
home on POD#5 in good condition with appropriate follow up
instructions.
