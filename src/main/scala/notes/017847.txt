Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2763**]
Chief Complaint:
Weakness, s/p fall, "I was about to die."

Major [**First Name3 (LF) 2947**] or Invasive Procedure:
CVVHD.

History of Present Illness:
79 yo Italian speaking male with h/o cirrhosis [**12-20**] Hep C, who
presented with chief complaint of weakness to [**Location (un) 745**] [**Hospital 3678**]
Hospital ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 65997**]) after falling in bathtub in the water.
Per OSH recs, he said he "didn't feel right" and his "legs were
weak" and he lowered himself into the tub. He hit his left
shoulder (unclear how if he lowered himself down). Did not hit
his head, no LOC. He was unable to pull the cord for help and
yelled until a neighbor came to his assistance. Paramedics took
him to [**Location (un) 745**] [**Hospital 3678**] hospital ED for evaluation.
.
At OSH, he underwent a head CT which was normal, and CXR that
was concerning for PNA. He was thought to be in heart failure
and was given lasix 40mg IV. He received azithromycin 500mg IV
x1 and ceftriaxone 1g IV x1. He was also given 1.5L NS. Labs
were noteworthy for Na 129, Cr of 1.6, and a troponin of 0.12
(last measured here at 0.01). His SBP ~90, which is his
baseline. EKG there demonstrated RBBB.
.
In the ED at [**Hospital1 18**], initial vs were: T97.9  P96  BP 101/68  R30
O2 sat 97% 2L NC. Labs were notable for troponin of 0.05 and pt
received ASA 325mg PO x1, no heparin per discussion with
cardiology in ED. RBBB seen on OSH EKG, but was not noted on EKG
at [**Hospital1 18**]. His T. bili was noted to be elevated 3.8 (previously
2.2). Pt underwent RUQ US, L shoulder plain film, and diagnostic
paracentesis. He was admitted to medicine/liver service for
evaluation fo [**Last Name (un) **] and pneumonia. VS on transfer were T 97.9  P95
 BP99/57  R32  O2sat 97% RA.
.
On the floor, pt states he feels "normal." When prompted, he
complains of L shoulder pain. No chest pain or abdominal pain.
He says his abdominal distention has gone down. When asked about
fevers or SOB, he states it depends on "the winds and drafts"
coming in and out of the room. Denies DOE. He endorses chronic
cough, non-productive, and is unable to describe it more.
Sometimes it is so severe he feels like vomiting. No nausea. His
last bowel movement looked "normal"- unable to detail further.
.
His friend who [**Name2 (NI) **] for him ([**Name (NI) **]) is present and states the pt
eats little, only fruit and water. [**Doctor Last Name **] is concerned that the
patient can no longer live alone and properly take care of
himself and he needs more help at home. He states the patient is
more confused than his baseline.
.
Of note, pt was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 65998**] for acute
kidney injury for which he was given albumin with an appropriate
response. He was also treated for pneumonia/UTI completing 7 day
course of levofloxacin [**2174-10-7**]. He was started on diuretics at
that time for increased weight gain due to his cirrhosis.
.
Review of sytems:
(+) LLE is chronically "sick because of diabetes" -he has
decreased sensation and is unable to walk on it without a walker
(-) Denies fever, chills, recent weight loss or gain. Denies
headache. Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations. No
dysuria. Denied arthralgias or myalgias.

IMAGING:
[**2174-10-19**] L shoulder xray (AP, neutral, axillary): 1. No acute
fractures or dislocation of the left shoulder joint. 2. Moderate
degenerative change at acromioclavicular joint and mild
glenohumeral degenerative change.

[**2174-10-19**] CXR: Low lung volumes persist. Hilar prominence and
cephalization of flow suggest pulmonary edema, which may be
accentuated due to low lung volumes. The heart remains enlarged
and likely somewhat accentuated by the low lung volumes.
Previously seen right lung peripheral reticular interstitial
opacity is less prominent on the current study. While reticular
interstitial opacity in the peripheral right lung is less
prominent as compared to the prior exam, subtle peripheral
reticular opacities persist bilaterally, which may be secondary
to component of chronic interstitial lung disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
FLOOR COURSE [**Date range (1) 65999**]:
79 yo italian speaking male with h/o cirrhosis [**12-20**] Hep C, CAD
s/p fall and with acute renal failure and elevated T bili.
.
# Fall - appears to be mechanical rather than syncopal as pt
denies dizziness or LOC prior to episode. He felt weak, possibly
due to poor nutrition or leg weakness from his diabetes. There
may have been a component of orthostatis due to aggressive
diuresis after last admission. O
