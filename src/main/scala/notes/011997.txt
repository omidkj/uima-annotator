Imaging:  HCT Wet Read:  compared with outside hospital CT from
10:30AM There is increasing size of large right basal ganglia
hemorrhage with increased mass effect, increased leftward shift
of midline (1.7 cm), right uncal herniation, increased
intraventricular hemorrhage.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is an 81 yo man with PMH of stroke, TIAs, Afib, on
coumadin, COPD, Colon CA and Hyperlipidemia who was transferred
from [**Hospital3 **] today with a large right basal ganglia
bleed.  Repeat CT shows progression of the bleed and increased
mass effect and herniation.  His exam without any sedation shows
unresponsiveness, absence of pupillary reflex, gag reflex and
EOM
reflexes, however he does have corneal reflexes bilaterally.

His prognosis is grim and the likelihood of him returning to a
meaningful quality of life seems low at this time.  The size of
the bleed, his age, the ventricular spread and his poor exam all
suggest a poor outcome.  We discussed with the family who wishes
to continue medical care for now, but has deferred EVD for time
being.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:
Patient was admitted to the ICU. He continued to neurologically
decline and he was made CMO. Deceased on [**2157-5-10**].
