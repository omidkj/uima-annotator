is status post a segment 5 liver resection in [**2193-3-11**] by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for cholangiocarcinoma.  On [**2193-10-6**] he presented
via the emergency room with a three week history of
increasing abdominal pain, a 72 hour history of intense
nausea and vomiting and inability tolerate P.O.'s.  Since his
original surgery he had been quite well and denies any
similar events.  He denies any prior abdominal surgery, has
had a negative colonoscopy in [**2191-3-11**].

PRIOR MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Cholangiocarcinoma, status post resection [**2193-3-11**].
2. Tonsillectomy.
3. Colonoscopy in [**2191-3-11**] which was negative.


MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 81 mg P.O. q day.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies smoking.  He is an
occasional alcohol drinker.  Denies intravenous or other
recreational drug use.  He is a retired [**Company 2318**] worker who is
divorced but does spend time with his son.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother died at 85 of unknown cause and
father died at 92 of cancer.

LABORATORIES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell count of
13.4, hematocrit of 45, platelets of 309.  Sodium 135,
potassium 4.3, chloride 92, CO2 32, BUN 31, creatinine 1.0
and glucose 111.  Lactate noted to be 1.5.  AST 35, ALT 26,
alkaline phosphatase 168, total bilirubin 2.0.  PT 13.0, PTT
23.8, INR of 1.1.  CT scan with both P.O. and intravenous
contrast performed in the emergency department shows several
dilated loops of small bowel.  There is a high grade
obsturction in the mid small bowel in an area proximal to
that obstruction which was concerning for pneumatosis.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In the emergency department Mr.
[**Name13 (STitle) 12101**] was described as a frail appearing male clearly
uncomfortable.  He is alert and oriented times three but
easily distracted.  He has a maximum temperature of 96.4,
pulse of 114, blood pressure of 140/80, respirations 18,
satting 19 percent.  In general his conjunctiva and mucosa
both seem to be dry.  Cranial nerves 2 through 12 are grossly
intact.  Pupils are equal and reactive to light with sclera
nonicteric.  Trachea is midline.  Lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Nose is likewise noted to be
nontender, noninflamed.  Cardiac examination is regular rate
and rhythm, no evidence of any murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen shows a well healed midline incision without any
evidence of any herniation.  Auscultation shows highly
pitched hypoactive bowel sounds.  Abdomen is otherwise soft,
diffusely tender, nondistended.  No evidence of any
organomegaly.  Rectal examination shows no evidence of masses
and is guaiac negative.

CLINICAL COURSE:  Based on his presentation to the emergency
department and CT scan findings examination by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in
the emergency department felt that the patient would be best
served by an emergent exploratory laparotomy.  In the
emergency department a Foley catheter was placed and less
than 100 cc of urine was seen with this.  The patient was
immediately bolused 4 liters of Crystalloid and urine output
gradually began to increase.  Shortly thereafter the patient
was taken to the operating room.  During operation diffuse
carcinomatosis was seen.  There was a high grade obstruction
and mat of cancer tethering down a considerable portion of
the bowel.  A diverting enterostomy was placed.  A
decompression gastric tube was placed.  Please refer to
operative note for full details.

Following surgery the patient was extubated and transferred
to the post anesthesia care unit.  He continued to be very
hypotensive and oliguric and ultimately required several
liters of Crystalloid boluses.  Postoperative laboratories
included a white count of 7.7, hematocrit of 36.5, platelets
of 320.  Sodium was 138, potassium 4.1, chloride 103, CO2 26,
BUN 21, creatinine 0.8, glucose 139.

On the first postoperative night patient was again
persistently oliguric and was dosed several times for this.
He was started empirically on Zosyn and his gastric tube was
left to drainage.  From the post anesthesia care unit the
patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.  Pain
control was provided by p.r.n. analgesia.  On the morning of
postoperative day three patient was transferred to the normal
surgical floor.  At that time diuresis was started.
Initially patient had a brisk diuresis but intermittently
required doses of 20 to 40 mg intravenous of Lasix.  Also at
that time surgical teams began engaging both the social work
resources and palliative cancer resources in discussing the
poor prognosis of this patient with him and his family.
Through several meetings the treatment and long term
prognosis of this patient were discussed at length with the
patient.

By postoperative day four there was an attempt to cap the
patient's gastrostomy tube.  This ultimately had to be opened
shortly after for distention and for passage of flatus.  On
postoperative day five patient was initiated on total
parenteral nutrition.  On the evening of hospital day six the
patient had a spontaneous desaturation event.  By report he
attempted to get out of bed on his own and became vasovagal.
Once placed back in bed his oxygen saturations were shown to
go down approximately 60 percent on room but quickly returned
to [**Location 213**] when placed on nasal cannula.  Initial arterial
blood gas on room was 7.46, 44, 36, 26 and 1.  On 6 liters of
oxygen.  This was 7.48, 38, 78 and 283.  Of note, the CBC at
that time showed a rising white count of 15.8.  Full work up
for possible pulmonary embolism was started at that time
including a VQ scan and ultimately a CTA.  Both of these were
shown to be negative for pulmonary embolism.  Patient was
transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit where he
continued to stabilize.  He was started empirically on Zosyn
for suspected pneumonia and consolidation which was seen by
CT scan.  On hospital day 8 patient was placed with a PICC
line.  He clinically responded well to Zosyn and ultimately
was transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit.  On
subsequent days his gastrointestinal tract likewise opened up
and his diet was slowly advanced from n.p.o. to regular
although this total parenteral nutritions continued to be
run.  On [**2193-10-17**], postoperative day 11, patient was
actually felt to be a good candidate for discharge to
rehabilitation.  However, he had an episode of abdominal pain
and distention and is deemed appropriate to keep hem over the
weekend with his gastrostomy tube unclamped.  Over the next
48 hours his gastrostomy tube was reclamped.  He tolerated
this well and tolerated a regular diet.  Again total
parenteral nutrition was left in place.  On the morning of
[**2193-10-21**] after evaluation by the attending surgeon and the
entire surgical team it was deemed that the patient was an
appropriate candidate for discharge.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1. Patient will continue total parenteral nutrition until
   weaned off.
2. Albuterol MDI 1 to 2 q 6 hours p.r.n.
3. Ipratropium bromide MDI q 4 hours p.r.n.
4. Sliding scale insulin as needed for total parenteral
   nutrition.
5. Amitriptyline 25 mg 1 P.O. q h. s.
6. Lopressor 100 mg P.O. B.I.D
7. Alprazolam 0.25 mg P.O. t.i.d.
8. Alprazolam 0.25 mg P.O. q 8 as needed for agitation.
9. Morphine 15 mg tablets 1 to 2 P.O. q 3 hours p.r.n. as
   needed for pain.
10.      Finally Zosyn 4.5 grams intravenous q 8 hours for
   three days.


FOLLOW UP:  The patient is scheduled to follow with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr.[**Name (NI) 1369**] office will likewise contact him to
set up a follow up appointment.

In addition, the patient has been actively involved with the
palliative care team and they are working with him on the
best long term options.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Include all prior diagnoses and add carcinomatosis.
2. Recurrent cholangiocarcinoma.
3. Status post enteral diversion and placement of gastr
