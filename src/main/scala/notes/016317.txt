Imaging:
[**2189-10-22**]: CT abd/pelvis: IMPRESSION:
1. Abdominal and pelvic free fluid, inhomogeneous enhancement of
the liver
and enlarged right atrium consistent with fluid overload,
potentially
contributing to patient's symptoms of anorexia as well as pain.
2. Moderate right-sided and small left-sided pleural effusions.
3. Left lower lobe pulmonary nodule. Based on the [**Last Name (un) 8773**]
guidelines,
initial followup in a low-risk patient would include a CT scan
at six to 12 months. In a high-risk patient, CT followup would
be conducted in three to six months.
.
[**2189-10-23**]: CXR: Mild congestive heart failure. Probable bibasilar
atelectasis.  Minimal, if any, right pleural effusion.
.
[**2189-10-24**]: RUQ US: Normal right upper quadrant ultrasound, with no
intra- or extra- hepatic biliary ductal dilatation. There is no
cholelithiasis or son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of cholecystitis.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 yo F with PMH CAD (LAD/RCA stents),
gastric and duodenal ulcers, recently treated H pylori
presenting with anemia (HCT 29->20) likely due to upper GI
bleed, no evidence of active bleeding at this time.

#Anemia -  Was sent to the ICU given that her HCT down to 20
from 29 one month prior. Patient was hemodynamically stable.
She did have recent colonoscopy that showed diverticulosis but
she has not had any blood per rectum so this is unlikely cause.
Patient received 2u pRBC in the ED, and hct bumped
appropriately. She was started on protonix [**Hospital1 **] and ASA and
coumadin were held.  EGD did not reveal source for her bleeding
and she was discharged with a stable Hct.  2 days prior to
discharge her ASA was restarted after discussion with her PMD.
She was discharged with home VNA to check her hematocrit twice a
week.  She also has follow up for a capsule endoscopy on Friday
after discharge.

#Acute heart failure - with right sided volume overload on
recent CT scan as evidenced by RA dilation/hepatic congestion
and abdominal fluid.  Most likely [**3-16**] cardiac dysfunction in the
setting of severe anemia in setting of known CAD.  No evidence
of active myocaridal infarction, CE's were negative x3. TTE
showed moderate symmetric LVH with hyperdynamic LV systolic
function, mild mitral regurgitation and moderate tricuspid
regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension.  She was started on
lasix 20mg daily and potassium 8mEq daily.  She will have her
electrolytes checked at home after initiation of lasix to ensure
her potassium is stable.

#Acute renal failure - most likely [**3-16**] decreased renal perfusion
in the setting of severe anemia and acute heart failure
resulting in prerenal state. No evidence of UTI on UA.
Creatinine returned to baseline on volume repletion and blood
transfusion.

#CAD - Patient has h/o LAD and RCA stents several years ago, not
on plavix.  No evidence of active ischemia.  EKG without
evidence of acute ischemia and cardiac enzymes were negative x3.
Aspirin, coumadin and metoprolol were held given GI bleed.  On
the floor, her ASA was restarted and Hct was stable.

#Atrial fibrillation - Patient was well rate controlled. Her
metoprolol and diltiazem were held given concern of UGIB.
Diltiazem was restarted on the day of transfer from ICU to the
floor.  She had an episode of AF with RVR, but this responded
well to metoprolol 2.5mg IV x 1.  Her metoprolol was restarted
and her HR remained stable.  With ambulation her HR remained in
the 70s.  On discharge, she was on nifedipine 120mg SR daily and
metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **].  Her ASA was restarted (as above), but
coumadin held
