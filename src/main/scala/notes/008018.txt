Pertinent Results:
[**10-17**] Echo: Prebypass: 1. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. 2.Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function
is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] 3.Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. 4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. 5.The mitral valve leaflets are myxomatous. An
eccentric anteriorly directed jet of Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Post bypass: 1. Biventricular
systolic function is unchanged. 2. Annuloplasty ring seen in the
mitral posiiton. Appears well seated. Trace mitral regurgitation
present.
[**10-22**] CXR: Two views of the chest. Examination on [**10-22**] at
10:31 hours. This is compared with the last film on [**10-19**]. The overall appearance is the same. The heart appears
slightly enlarged, which could be phase of contraction. The
patient is not taking an optimal inspiration and there are tiny
effusions bilaterally. No pneumothorax is seen, there is a
slight amount of reaction adjacent to the minor fissure
laterally on the right which was in the region of the tube
insertion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 33754**] was a same day admit after undergoing all
pre-operative work-up as an outpatient. On day of admission she
was brought to the operating room where she underwent a min.
invasive mitral valve repair. Please see operative report for
surgical details. Following surgery she was transferred to the
CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. Later on op
day she was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact
and extubated. Beta blockers and diuretics were started on
post-op day one and she was gently diuresed towards her pre-op
weight. Later on post-op day one she was transferred to the SDU
for further care. On post-op day two her chest tubes were
removed. On post-op day two beta blockers were discontinued do
to hypotension and diuretics were stopped for auto diuresis.
Over the next several days she slowly improved while working
with physical therapy for strength and mobility. Her HCT was low
couple days post-op but trended up by time of discharge. On
post-op day five she appeared to be doing well and was
discharged home with VNA services and the appropriate follow-up
appointments.
