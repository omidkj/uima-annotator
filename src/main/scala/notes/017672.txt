Attending:[**Doctor First Name 3290**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
64yoM with PAD s/p stents to L CIA/SFA, CAD s/p BMS to D1, DM,
dyslipidemia, idopathic pulmonary fibrosis (unproven biopsy)
presenting with fever, non-productive cough, and chest pain for
the past four days.  Pt notes worsening SOB with any exertion,
productive cough of clear-white sputum (more then usual), and
some chest pain that has been getting progressively worse in 4
days. Denies any sudden SOB symptoms, no new pedal edema or calf
tenderness. He has been checking his Temp in the morning daily
and it is 96, but never took it in the PM. Denies any chills,
rigors, sweats. He called pulmonary clinic this AM with
complaints of SOB, fatigue and weakness, bed-ridden for the past
few days.  No sick contacts.  [**Name (NI) 227**] his prior history, he was
referred to the ED for further evaluation.
.
Of note, per last pulmonary note in [**12/2116**]: He was previously
followed for IPF at [**Hospital1 112**], had initial plans for lung transplant
but decided not to pursue lung transplantation. (although, when
talking to me, pt reports that he did in fact want the
transplant) He is on 2-4L NC O2, on NAC, although he reportedly
stopped taking this in [**Month (only) 1096**]. (however, pt tells me today
that he still takes it). He has undergone pulm rehabilitation.
He is known to feel SOB all the time, even at night. He has a
chronic cough productive of clear white sputum. Known to have a
little blood coming out of his nose when he sneezes a lot. Uses
flonase nasal spray, combivent nebs at night for cough/sob. He
is known to be losing weight.
.
In the ED inital vitals were, Tm 101.2, HR 100 BP 79/47 RR 44
Sat 90% on 100%NRB.  DNI but will accept NIV.  His labs were
notable for Na 129 (baseline low 130s), K 4.2, Cl 98, HCO3 22,
BUN 13, Cr. 0.7, Gluc 115. Trop-T: <0.01 proBNP: 220 wbc 14.9,
hgb 11.1, hct 34, plt 492  PT: 13.5  PTT: 28.6  INR: 1.3;  He
was given Acetaminophen, Vancomycin, and Cefepime.  Got 2L NS.
Most recent vitals: temp 101, BP 99/57, rr 30, sat 90% (baseline
90% on 2L at home) on BIPAP.
.
On arrival to the ICU, pts vitals: T 98.4, 95/61 (baseline BP is
70-90s per son), HR 82, RR 40, 95% on 100% non-rebreather. He
says he is currently feeling at his baseline when he lies still.
But when he ambulates, he feels significantly worse. He notes at
home that he uses CPAP at home for OSA and uses 2L NC during the
day all day long. Occasionally he will use 4 L NC. He notes that
he had back surgery performed 2 months ago, denies any clots in
his legs, no calf pain. Does have known mild pedal edema, for
which he uses compression stalkings. He notes that he has not
been drinking very much lately because he is worried about
taking the trip to the bathroom, concerned he will be too SOB.
Thus, drinking only very little daily and mainly coffee.
.

IMAGING:

[**2-10**] CXR:
IMPRESSION: Increased markings bilaterally may be due to the
combination of
underlying pulmonary fibrosis and moderate pulmonary edema,
superimposed
infectious process cannot be excluded.

[**2-11**] Echo:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal regional and global biventricular systolic
function. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2113-1-23**], the
pulmonary artery systolic pressures can be estimated on the
current study and are moderately elevated. The other findings
are similar.

[**2-11**] CTA chest:
1. Worsened air space disease on a background of emphysema and
chronic
fibrotic changes consistent with reported idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis.
Differential includes acute exacerbation of IPF, infectious
process, or ARDS.
The pulmonary vasculature is well opacified and without filling
defect to suggest pulmonary embolism.

Brief Hospital Course:
64yoM with PAD s/p stents to L CIA/SFA, CAD s/p BMS to D1, DM,
dyslipidemia, idopathic pulmonary fibrosis (on [**2-20**] L NC at
home), OSA on CPAP, presenting with fever, worsening productive
cough, and chest pain for the past four days, suggestive of
underlying pneumonia vs IPF exacerbation.
.
# Dyspnea, Hypoxia:   Etiology pneumonia vs IPF exacerbation,
progression of underlying IPF. Urine legionella, UA, blood
cultures negative. CTA showed extensive GGO, consistent w/
worsening IPF exacerbation, infectious process, or ARDS, but no
filling defects. CTA showed severe progression of disease when
compared to [**2115**] CTA. He was placed on broad spectrum
antibiotics: cefepime, vanco, azithro. Patient was given lasix
for question of pulmonary edema, with good UOP. He was
additionally give
