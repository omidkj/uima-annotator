Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
hip surgery

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Status post right total hip replacement revision [**2141-7-11**]


History of Present Illness:
62 yo Female with significant PMH of renal tx from FSGS, HTN,
CAD s/p MI, DM2, hyperlipidemia, who is s/p right revision of
total hip replacement on [**2141-7-11**]. [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] was called ~10:40 am as
pt with BP of 74/51 after fluid bolus ~400 cc. Pt was
complaining of lightheadedness and subjective dyspnea. Upon
arrival T: 100.3, HR: 90s; O2 90% on 4L and FS 167. BP increased
after initiation of second IV with NS bolus and came up to 130s
systolic after ~700 cc. Pt was transiently placed on a NRB,
though pleth of the O2 was not great. With warming the finger O2
saturation increased from mid 80s to mid-upper 90s and pt put on
FM with 6L. CXR showed scattered patchy alvelolar opacities b/l
greated in upper zones. ABG on 6L was 7.34/33/61/19.
Additionally, pt with ~3 episodes of coughing up hemoptysis,
which has since become clear sputum. It was decided to transfer
pt to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for increasing observation and nursing requirements
as well as for possible potential of increasing respiratory
distress.
.
Upon transfer pt is on 5L via facemask. She subjectively feels
better without lightheadedness. No CP/SOB. No N/V/F/C. Pt does
note that she felt like "I was getting a cold" for the days
prior to surgery and had been coughing with minimal productive
sputum, but no blood until this am. At bseline denies orthopnea,
weigh gain or LE edema. Overall she had been feeling well prior
to admission excpet with cold and mild cough symptoms prior to
admission. Of note in OR receieved 1.5LNS with 250cc blood loss
and 2.3L in PACU and 1.5L on floor, but no PRBC. She was started
on coumadin last night.

CXR [**2141-7-14**]
IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly.

Echo TTE [**2141-7-13**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF 70%). No masses or thrombi are seen in
the left
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic
valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
a small
pericardial effusion. The effusion appears loculated around the
right atrial
free wall. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. No
right atrial
diastolic collapse is seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Impression/Plan at [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission: 62 yo female s/p LRRT on
immunosuppressives, PAF, DM2, hx of squamous cell lung ca s/p
RLL lobectomy in [**2138**] here after right hip revision with
increased SOB and bilateral infiltrates.
.
Respiratory Distress: Likely CHF exacerbation as pt likely
received fluids in the periop and operative period.  Other
causes such as cardiogenic pulm edema, ARDS from infection
either aspiration related to intubation or atypical pneumonia
given immunosuppression or fat emboli and alveolar hemmorrhage
given hemoptysis were considered and ruled out with trial of
diuresis, cardiac enzymes, repeat echo and sputum cultures.  Pt
was diuresed with lasix in the ICU and was transferred to the
floor not requiring further diuresis.
.
Hypotension - in the ICU transient episode of hypotension likely
secondary to overmedication with metoprolol and verapamil.
Quickly resolved with IVF, was not an issue during the rest of
the admission.
.
s/p hip revision: Worked with PT.  She was given lovenox
prophylaxis and started on coumadin.  Discharged with lovenox
until INR becomes therapeutic.  Pt's hematocrit had dropped from
35.2 to 28.7 and repeat was 29.7. Ortho and medicine teams
evaluated patient, no signs of hematoma or bleeding.  Incision
sight was clean.  Pt was less symptomatic in the hip then
previously.  Per Ortho resident low concern for bleeding and the
hct remained stable after this time.
.
CRI: stable at baseline creatinine s/p LRRT on
immunosuppressives, transplant team followed patient during the
hospitilization and checked the sirolimus levels.  Renally
cleared meds dosed accordingly.
.
PAfib: stable continued verapamil, restarted coumadin goal INR
[**12-29**].
.
DM2: stable on glipizide and humalog sliding scale, appreciate
[**Last Name (un) **] assistance.
.
CAD: no hx of MI, but with EKG changes and hyperlipidemia, has
presumed CAD, so continued statin, Repeat Echo essentially
uncahnged from prior EF> 55% - mild demand ischemia likely
source of mild troponin leak.
.
Osteoperosis: stable cont alendronate.
