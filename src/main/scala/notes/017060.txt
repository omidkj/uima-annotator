Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
(by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] y.o. F without cognitive
decline, atrial fibrillation, ischemic colitis, recently
transferred to [**Hospital1 5595**] LTC in [**2123-3-30**] who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for abdominal pain and decreased appetite. At [**Hospital1 5595**] BP = 80/50,
HR = 55, O2 sat = 78% on RA. Upon further discussion with her
grandaughter it was decided that she should come to [**Hospital1 18**] for
evaluation.
<br>
In the ED she was given levofloxacin 500 mg IV, Flagyl 500 mg
IV, Morphine 16 mg IV, and fentanyl 100 mg. Her vitals were T =
34.7 rectally, HR = 60, BP = 101/61, 100 % on RA. In the ED
multiple code status discussions were held with the family,
patient and interpretor.  The patient per staff at [**Hospital1 5595**] and Dr. [**Name (NI) 75203**] note does not have dementia and has capacity to make her
decisions.
I paged the interpretor who interpreted in person for the
patient in the ED. She reported that the patient declined
surgery multiple times.  She did agree to being admitted to
[**Hospital1 18**] to have IV antibiotics and IVF. Per the ED central line
access was discussed but the family refused.  Per the ED the
patient was made [**Hospital1 3225**] and was transported to 11 R.
<br>
Upon arrival to the floor the patient was alert and talking. She
responded to me in Russian. When I paged the interpretor to
discuss goals of care she told her, "I am tired, I cannot talk
now, I don't feel well."  She denied pain in her abdomen.  Upon
further discussions with her grand-daughter [**Name (NI) **] the patient is
not [**Name (NI) 3225**] and they do want her to have antibiotics.  While on the
floor she became unresponsive but continued to have spontaneous
respirations. Her O2 sat decreased to 80% on RA. She was placed
on a NRB and her O2 sat fluctuated from 86-100% on NRB. She
remained unresponsive to vigorous painful stimuli even in the
presence of her family speaking in Russian.
She was given 0.6 mg IV narcan without effect prior to transfer
to the ICU. Her family was made aware of her transfer to the ICU
prior to their departure.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 75204**] is [**Age over 90 **] y.o. female without clear cognitive
impairment, atrial fibrillation, and ischemic colitis who
presented with with abdominal pain and hypotension.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER, her VS were T 34.7 rectal (93.4F),
BP 96/66, HR 69, RR 26 and sats 100% on NRB. Given her abdominal
pain and h/o ischemic colitis, there was concern for an
intraabdominal process. Initial labs revealed worsening renal
function, a bicarb of 9, and a lactate of 4.0. She was given
flagyl and levaquin IV, with plans to perform an abdomen and
pelvis CT. Interpreters were called in order to communicate with
the patient and the patient refused surgery if that was what
would be needed. After lengthy discussions with the patient, her
family, and the interpreters, the conclusion was that there
would be no imaging as the patient would not pursue surgical
intervention if an abnormality was found. Given that she was a
known DNR/DNI, the decision was made to not put a CVL in and she
would be treated with IVF, IV antibiotics and pain medication as
needed. In the ER, her BP ranged from 72-123/39-99, HR 58-67,
and O2 sats 96-100% on 2L nc. It was noted that the interpreter
was called repeatedly for ? of agitation, restlessness and pain
(mostly in her legs). In total, she received 100mcg IV fentanyl
and 16mg IV morphine between 1800 and 2100. She was then
transferred to the floor to be [**Hospital1 3225**].
.
However, on arrival to the floor, the patient's family inquired
about antibiotics and goals of care were readdressed. It was
then felt that the patient was not truly [**Hospital1 3225**], but that she would
want care up to the point of CPR and intubation. In the midst of
this conversation, she became somnolent and unresponsive to
sternal rub. Her O2 sats dropped down to 76% on 10L and she was
placed on a NRB. Her HR was noted to be down in the 30s and her
temperature was 92. She was given 1L NS bolus and a total of
0.6mg narcan with minimal improvement. Decision was made to
transfer her to the ICU for further care.
.
In the ICU, she continued to decline. It was felt that her
hypotension was likely due to sepsis, probably from her UTI but
an abdominal source could not be excluded. Her antibiotics were
thus broadened to meropenem, ciprofloxacin, linezolid and flagyl
(to double-cover for GNR and to cover for both MRSA and VRE -
she had positive swabs for both in the past). She was given IVF
(with bicarbonate, given her low bicarbonate on labs) to attempt
to maintain a SBP >90 or a MAP >60. However, given her DNI
status, fluid resuscitation was limited by her respiratory
status. She was warmed with a BairHugger and was also started on
steroids for presumed adrenal insufficiency from sepsis. She was
also found to be bradycardic, which was concerning. Her calcium
was repleted and we attempted to improve her
