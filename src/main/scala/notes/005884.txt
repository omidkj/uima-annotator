History of Present Illness:
This is a 83 year old man with CAD and DM presented from nursing
home with fevers and desaturations.  Per his wife, he has been
fighting a URI for the past 6 weeks, which he caught from
another nursing home resident.  It seems like he was on a 3 day
course of levofloxacin and a 10 day course of Augmentin without
improvement.  He was also being treated for a left ear infection
with antibiotic ear drops, which was diagnosed in the VA last
week.  His cough was not improving and he developed a fever last
night with desaturations and was subsequently transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation.
.
In the ED, his vitals were: 101.0, 126, 62/39, 32, 84% on 6LNC.
He was given 3L NS and his BP improved to 120/60.  He was put on
a NRB and his ABG was 7.19, 63, 79.  He was then put on BIPAP
and maintained his O2 sats in the 90%'s.  His CXR showed
bilateral LL opacities with small bilateral pleural effusions.
UA was positive for a UA.  Lactate was 1.5.  He was given
vanco/levo/flagyl.  EKG showed new afib with RVR to 130's.
Metoprolol 2.5mg IV x 1 was given and he eventually
spontaneously converted to sinus.  He was transferred to the
MICU for further care.

.
CXR [**7-20**]: Interval progression of now complete opacification of
the left hemithorax likely represents a combination of a
left-sided pleural effusion with collapse/consolidation of the
left lung.  Moderate/large pleural effusion has been present
since the most remote chest radiograph available dated [**2186-9-7**].
If indicated, further evaluation with a CT could be considered.
.
CXR [**2188-7-24**]: Single bedside AP examination labeled "erect at 3
a.m." is compared with the study obtained some 10.5 hours
earlier; allowing for differences in technique, the overall
appearance is unchanged.  There are persistent bilateral pleural
effusions, left greater than right with dense left retrocardiac
opacity, and pneumonic consolidation in this region cannot be
excluded.  There is right basilar subsegmental atelectasis.
Heart remains enlarged with some pulmonary vascular congestion.

Note that in comparison to the previous study, at 0400 H, the
overall
appearance is significantly improved, with the support tubes
removed and the left subclavian central venous catheter,
unchanged in position.
.
Swallow Study [**2188-7-25**]: VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW. Mild
oropharyngeal dysphagia.  Evidence of silent aspiration and
penetration.  Please refer to the speech pathologist note for
details and recommendations.


Brief Hospital Course:
83 year old man with CAD and DM presented from nursing home with
fevers, hypotension and respiratory failure.
.
# RESPIRATORY FAILURE: chronic left pleural effusion and RLL PNA
on top of that which may explain his decompensation. He probably
also has some chronic obstructive disease from his tobacco
history. Initially admitted to ICU with intubation.  He has been
steadily improving since his extubation, and is now saturating
well on 3.5 Lnc. He has completed 5 days of azithromycin, and
finished 8day of vanco / zosyn. Central line dc'd and tip sent
for culture on [**2188-7-27**]. Repeat CXR shows stable LLL effusion and
decreased RLL opacity.  Patient needs to be maintained with
aspiration precautions.
.
# HYPOTENSION: SBP improved since admission- range nearly
normal. Initially held home antihypertensives medications.
Restarted lisopril after renal functions improved to baseline.
Patient tolerated lisinopril well. f/u blood cultures were
negative
.
# CAD: Cath in [**2181**] shows 2VD (LCX and RCA) and s/p stent to
LCX. Subsequently no further symptoms or workup, although
patient became more debilitated and rarely exerts himself. He
has new RBBB since [**5-/2187**] but ruled out with cardiac enzymes.
Patient was not placed on asa per urology recs in the past and
was continued on plavix.
.
# PUMP: Wife does not remember any hx of CHF but remembers the
patient taking lasix for peripheral edema at one point. He does
not appear volume overloaded and was not continued on lasix.
TTE on [**7-28**] showed nl LVEF.
.
# AFIB: No prior history of afib before this admission. Was in
RVR to 130's in ED during acute respiratory distress when
hypotensive. Metoprolol 2.5mg IV x 1 was given and he
spontaneously converted back to sinus rhythm. He has remained in
sinus ever since.  Patient was continued on plavix while
coumadin was not started per prior urology recs given history of
hematuria.
.
# UTI: By UA in ED. No dysuria. Patient was already started on
antibiotics as mentioned above for PNA which would have covered
his UTI.
.
# chronic ear infection: Patient was placed on out patient
antimicrobial drops.  He was advised to make an out patient
appointment with his PCP to follow up his ear infection.
.
# ARF: Baseline creatinine 1.1 to 1.5.  Patient was discharged
with baseline Creatinine.
