Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after cardiac arrest.

 Patient was reassessed morning after admission and his neuro
exam still showed evidence of severe anoxic brain injury.  After
discussing with the patient's family, he was placed on comfort
measures only.  A morphine drip was started and titrated to
maintain the patient's comfort.  He was extubated and the
patient expired 2-3 hours later.
