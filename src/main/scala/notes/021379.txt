History of Present Illness:
68yo man with h/o HIV/AIDS (last CD4 211 [**2200-8-9**], vl <50 [**6-/2200**]
on HAART), CAD s/p CABG [**2194**], PCI RCA [**2198**], CHF (EF >55%,
diastolic dysfunction), admitted [**2200-8-7**] with SOB and fever. He
has been intubated previously for recurrent pneumonia and CHF
exacerbations. The patient was evaluated in the ED [**2200-8-4**] after
noting fever of 101 at home. CXR at that time showed no change
from prior, UA was negative, and other labs were essentially
unremarkable, and he was discharged to home. He was evaluated by
his PCP [**2200-8-5**] and started on Azithromycin for concern of
atypical pneumonia. On the morning of admission [**2199-8-7**] he
developed a fever to 101.8 and worsening shortness of breath. He
denied cough and chest pain. On presentation to the ED T 99.1,
HR 61, BP 146/44, RR 24 93%RA. CXR showed new bilateral patchy
opacities. He was started on azithromycin, ceftriaxone, and
vancomycin. He was transferred to the MICU that night with
worsening tachypnea and decreasing O2 saturation on 100% NRB.
Oxygentation improved after diuresis with torsemide, and he was
transferred back to the floor on Zosyn, vancomycin, and
azithromycin for treatment of pneumonia. Since that time he has
continued to spike fevers, today to 100.7. Renal function has
declined with creatinine rising 3.0 to 4.4 between [**2200-8-11**] and
today, [**2200-8-13**]. On the night of [**2200-8-11**] he was diuresed after
developing pulmonary edema with iv fluid boluses for treatment
of acute renal failure, thought to be prerenal in etilogy.
[**Hospital 106213**] hospital course has been complicated by recurrent
diarrhea, C. diff negative x1.
*
On [**8-8**] patient desaturated to 88% on 100%NRB, RR 26, BP
120/70, HR 75. ABG 7.31/41/63 on NRB. CXR showed diffuse patchy
infiltrates unchanged since last CXR [**2200-8-10**] and small bilateral
effusions. Patient was alert and conversive. He was SOB, denies
chest pain, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness. Prior to
transfer to the MICU he received torsemide 20mg iv x1.

Pertinent Results:
CT chest ([**8-24**]):
Diffuse ground-glass opacifications and septal thickening
bilaterally. There is an associated right pleural effusion. This
could be due to an element of CHF. There is also more patchy
airspace opacifications seen at both lung bases.
*
Left Upper Ext U/S ([**8-22**]): to eval to swelling
There is flow throughout all the veins of the upper extremity.
There is compressibility of the subclavian and axillary veins.
Compressibility of the smaller upper extremity veins is limited
due to technical factors on the current exam.
*
ECHO ([**8-14**]):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular  systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). No masses
or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic  regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There  is no mitral
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial  effusion.
.
Renal U/S [**2200-8-9**]:
No evidence of hydronephrosis. Normal renal ultrasound.
.
EGD [**8-15**]:
Friability and erythema in the first part of the duodenum
compatible with duodenitis.  Erosions in the second part of the
duodenum
.
GI Bleeding Study [**8-15**]:
No evidence of intra-abdominal extravasation of tracer to
indicate
a GI bleed. However, lateral delayed images show abnormal tracer
uptake within the region of the rectum. The rectal area could be
further evaluated by direct inspection.
.
EGD [**8-20**]:
Stricture of the distal bulb
Blood in the fundus
Mucosa suggestive of Barrett's esophagus
Otherwise normal egd to mid-jejunum
.
Colonoscopy [**8-20**]:
There was no blood in the colon or terminal ileum.
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to terminal ileum
.
Video Swallow [**9-3**]:
Aspiration and penetration of thin and nectar-thickened liquids.
Please refer to speech pathologist report for further
evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course:
67 yo man with HIV/AIDS, CAD s/p CABG, HTN, DM2 admitted with
fever and shortness of breath, transferred to MICU with hypoxic
respiratory failure requiring intubation.

#) Hypoxic resp failure requiring intubation.  Trach placed on
[**8-26**].

Pt initially with multifocal PNA and likely fluid overload (PCWP
of 27).  He received 10 days of azithromycin for atypical PNA
coverage and 21 days of Vanco/Zosyn.  1st bronch did not reveal
a great deal of sputum in his airways thus assumed initial PNA
had resolved.

He was then placed on a lasix gtt for aggressive diuresis.  He
was thought to have right heart failure secondary to pulm HTN
(CVP of 13, PA pressure of 69/28).  His Swan was d/c'ed on [**8-17**].
 An echo done on [**8-14**] revealed an EF of 70%, normal E/A ratio,
moderate PA HTN and RV hypokinesis.  His lasix gtt was
eventually d/c'ed on [**8-25**] for acute on chronic renal failure.

A 2nd Bronch was performed on [**8-19**] to evaluate a RLL opacitiy;
