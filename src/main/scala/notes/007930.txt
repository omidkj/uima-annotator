Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**]
Chief Complaint:
Global Aphasia, Right Sided Weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intra-arterial tPA administration
PEG tube placement


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 111870**] is a 69 year-old right handed woman with past
medical history of hypertension, chronic back pain and a left
shoulder fracture one month prior who presented as an OSH
transfer Code Stroke for reported sudden onset aphasia and right
sided weakness.  She was last reported without symptoms (as
noted by husband) at 1700hrs on [**2115-6-5**].  After finding her at
1730hrs on the floor not speaking, he called EMS who on arrival
noted right sided weakness and a left gaze deviation.  Her GCS
per EMS was 3, and on evaluating her, witnessed a systolic blood
pressure drop to 89 with respiratory rate decrease.  EMS
intubated the patient in the field and brought her to [**Hospital1 5979**].  A CT scan obtained at [**Hospital3 **] was negative
for hemorrhage or acute process (comfirmed upon [**Hospital1 18**] review),
but because she was intubated [**Hospital1 487**] reported inability to
obtain a clear exam to warrant tPA administration.

Therefore, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible tPA
and/or intervention. She arrived intubated and sedated at [**Hospital1 18**]
ED, with right-sided weakness when weaned off of sedation.
However, given the shortcomings inherent with an intubated
examination and her difficulty arousing from sedation, she went
to CT/CTA/CTP, which showed a left MCA clot at the bifurcation
and left MCA stroke with perfusion mismatch on imaging.  She was
started on tPA and taken to the neurointerventional suite where
intraarterial tPA was administered.

Past Medical History:
- HTN
- chronic back pain
- tripped down stairs 1 month ago resulting in L shoulder fx
- Thyroid cancer s/p lobectomy
- COPD
- chronic leukocytosis

Social History:
lives with husband, independent
quit smoking 1 year ago

-Mental Status: Alert, intubated, sedated initially and
unarousable.  With propofol held was slow to respond to sternal
rub, grimaced to pain.  Was able to briefly follow commands to
squeeze and let go on her L hand and to wiggle her L toes.  Was
able to wiggle her R toes minimally to command, and could not
move her RUE to command.

-Cranial Nerves:
I: Olfaction not tested.
II: PERRL 3 to 2mm and brisk.  VFF to confrontation.  Decreased
corneal reflex response on the R. Funduscopic exam revealed no
papilledema, exudates, or hemorrhages.
III, IV, VI: pt with midline gaze, able to overcome midline in
both directions when head was moved.
V: unable to test
VII: unable to test.
VIII: Hearing intact to loud voice bilaterally as followed
commands
IX, X: unable to test
[**Doctor First Name 81**]: [**4-6**] unable to test
XII: unable to test

-Motor: Normal bulk, tone throughout. No adventitious movements,
such as tremor, noted. No asterixis noted. Patient withdrew LUE
and LLE briskly to noxious.  She withdrew her RLE slowly to
noxious, with no triple flexion noted. She did not withdraw her
RUE to noxious.

-Sensory: withdrawal to noxious as above
-DTRs:

R  2  2    2    2   1
Plantar response was flexor on the left and very minimally
upgoing on the R.

-Coordination: reached for ETT accurately with RUE until she was
placed in restraints

-Gait: Deferred, pt intubated

CT Perfusion:
1.  Evolving infarct in the left MCA territory with
hypoattenuation and
effacement in the left insular ribbon.
2.  Occlusion of the left distal M1 segment before the
bifurcation.
3.  Mismatch on CT perfusion suggesting penumbra in the left MCA
territory.
4.  Thyroid asymmetry with right lobe coarse calcification. This
could be
further evaluated with nonurgent thyroid ultrasound if
clinically indicated.

CTA head and Neck:
1.  Evolving infarct in the left MCA territory with
hypoattenuation and
effacement in the left insular ribbon.
2.  Occlusion of the left distal M1 segment before the
bifurcation.
3.  Mismatch on CT perfusion suggesting penumbra in the left MCA
territory.
4.  Thyroid asymmetry with right lobe coarse calcification. This
could be
further evaluated with nonurgent thyroid ultrasound if
clinically indicated.

TTE: No ASD or PFO seen. Normal global and regional
biventricular systolic function.

[**6-6**] CT Head:1.  Intraparenchymal hemorrhage at the site of prior
left MCA infarct.
2.  Small left subdural hematoma layering on the tentorium, new
from prior.
3.  No midline shift or evidence of transtentorial herniation.
4.  No evidence of obstructive hydrocephalus.

[**6-6**] CT Head
Hyperdensity in the left frontal lobe with mild sulcal
effacement, likely represents diffusion of permeated contrast
after
angiography rather than hemorrhagic transformation in an area of
left MCA
stroke.  Continued followup is recommended.

[**6-7**] CT abd and pelvis:
1. No evidence of intra-abdominal or pelvic hemorrhage. Trace
free simple
appearing fluid in the pelvis.

2. Multiple bilateral rib fractures at various stages of healing
from acute to
remote.

3.  Moderate complex right pleural effusion, likely hemorrhagic
and related to
rib fractures. Trace left pleural effusion. Small intramuscular
hemmorhage
related to fourth right rib fracture.

4.  Small hyperdense rounded lesion in the upper pole of the
right kidney, may
represent hemorrhagic cyst, though cannot exclude malignancy.
Recommend
further evaluation with ultrasound.

5.  Nodular thickening of medial limb of left adrenal gland may
represent
underlying nodule, or given recent trauma, a small hemmorrhage.
Attention on
follow-up

6. Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.

7. Enteric catheter terminates in the distal esophagus and
should be advanced.

[**6-7**] MRI brain
1.Acute infarct noted within the left frontal, insular cortex
extending to involve majority of the left temporal cortex with
preservation of the left basal ganglia.
2.  Vasculature not completely evaluated on this study, as an
MRA of the brain was not performed due to patient's
deteriorating condition.  Within this limitation, the mean M1
segment of the left MCA demonstrates normal
intracranial flow void; however, the distal M2 segments could
not be
evaluated.  Once the patient's condition is stable then an MRA
of the brain and a GRE sequence is recommended.
3.  Sphenoid sinus disease.
4.  Sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.

[**6-8**] MRA brain
Resolution of occlusion of the left M1 segment of the left
middle
cerebral artery, with persistent diminished flow in its branches
compared to the right.
