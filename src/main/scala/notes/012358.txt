Brief Hospital Course:
HD#1 Ms [**Known lastname 71508**] was admitted through the emergency department and
transferred to SICU. Work up revealed stable hematocrit,
hyperglycemia, and electrolyte abnormalities. She remained
afebrile. Abdominal x-ray and chest x-ray were unremarkable, see
pertinent results for details. She was held NPO with IV fluids,
Zosyn IV and NGT to low suction. She had no more episodes of
nausea or vomiting and only small amounts of clear drainage from
the NGT. GI consult was obtained for possible EGD, which was
never obtained due to the patients improving status. HD#2 she
was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 9 for further recovery.

Ms [**Known lastname 71508**] continued to improve with IV antibiotics and and IV
fluids. Her diet was advanced and she tolerated a diabetic diet
on HD#3. She was followed by physical therapy for strength and
mobility. Urine culture revealed  susceptible enterococcus, she
was changed to Augmentin by mouth HD#5. She continued to have
soft formed stool and gas per ostomy throughout her admission.
Her home dose of Glargine insulin was increased to 24 units at
bedtime and her sliding scale insulin was increased due to
persistent hyperglycemia. Her home dose of Lasix was decreased
to 10 mg daily due to her initial fluid volume deficit. Foley
catheter was discontinued on HD#8 and she voided without
difficulty. At time of discharge her white count normalized and
her UA showed only occasional bacteria, see pertinent results
