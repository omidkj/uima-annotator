History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is 60 year old male with past medical history of
alcohol abuse and withdrawal, diastolic congestive heart
failure, seizures, COPD, intraparenchymal bleed, and atrial
fibrillation who presented with seizures. Patient is intubated
and cannot provide additional history, however per report from
the ED staff, he presented after having a seizure at the home
where he was staying, per report the seizure lasted 1-2 minutes.

.
Per report to ED staff, he stated his last drink was yesterday,
and he has had been to several hospitals recently. His vitals on
presentation were blood pressure 126/75, heart rate 74,
respiratory rate of 18, and 100% on 15 liter non-rebreather
mask. He was reported to be combative and agitated, however was
alert and oriented times three. He denied any complaints or
other difficulties at that time. He was given 10 mg of valium,
then 2 mg of IM ativan.
.
He was noted to have a possible seizure while in the emergency
room, and was intubated for airway protection and anticipated
need for significant amount of sedating medications. There were
not a lot of secretions noted at that time. He was given versed,
fentanyl, 10 mg of haldol, thiamine, folic acid, multivitamin,
and vancomycin for redness of his hand. He was noted to be
initially tachycardic to the 150's, however this improved to
110's at time of transfer and after three liters of fluid
including a banana bag. He underwent a head CT, which was
negative for acute intracranial hemorrhage or fracture. A serum
toxicology screen was negative for alcohol and other drugs. A
phenytoin level was 3.6. He was transferred on a versed drip at
14 mg/hour and fentanyl 100 mcg/hour.
.
Upon arrival to the ICU, he is intubated but agitated,
attempting to sit upright and remove his endotracheal tube.

Imaging:
[**3-13**] Chest x-ray:
1. Endotracheal tube with tip 5.0 cm from the carina.
2. OG tube with tip projecting below the diaphragm; the side
hole is not well visualized but may be above the diaphragm,
recommend advancement.
2. Bibasal pleural effusions and associated relaxation
atelectasis.
.
[**3-13**] head CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
2. No acute fracture. Right occipital nondisplaced fracture is
again noted.
3. Extensive encephalomalacia as above.
4. Slightly increased sinus thickening may be related to
intubation or
worsening sinus disease.
.
[**3-14**] ECHO:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity sizes
and global biventricular systolic function. Dilated ascending
aorta.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 60 year old male with past medical history of
alcohol abuse, seizures, intracranial bleed, diastolic CHF,
esophageal cancer and COPD who presented intubated after
witnessed seizure in the emergency department.
.
# Respiratory distress:  Patient was intubated on admission in
setting of seizure, as below.  Was extubated but required oxygen
transiently since extubation, with occasional desaturations.
Likely related to episodes of AFib with rapid heart rate (see
below), as now that is resolved, O2 sats have stabilized.
Patient was managed on COPD medications as below, discharged
with stable saturation on ambient air.
.
# Atrial fibrillation:  Developed atrial fibrillation with rapid
heart rate during his hospital course.  Metoprolol was titrated
up to metoprolol 25mg PO q 6hr for added HR control.  However,
with this BP dropped, so therefore, started dig 0.125mg daily
and decreased metoprolol to 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **].  With these measures,
heart rate and blood pressure were stable on discharge.
.
# History of alcohol withdrawal and acute delirium: During this
admission the patient initially received >200mg valium during
the first 24 hr of admission.  Head CT [**3-13**] only notable for
encephalomalacia likely from contusion. On [**3-15**] the pt was noted
to be agitated, trying to leave, dysarthric and combative.
Psychiatry was asked to see the patient and the psychiatry
service determined that the patient was likely intoxicated on
benzodiazepines. They recommended standing Haldol 2.5mg po as
well as a taper of valium.  He completed this taper with
improvement of mental status to baseline at time of discharge,
haldol was discontinued on discharge.
.
# Seizure disorder: unclear if seizure on presentation was from
his underlying seizure disorder or ETOH withdrawl. Patient
reported his last drink a day prior to admission and his alcohol
level was zero. Head CT was negative for intracranial
hemorrhage.  Continued on valium taper to completion, and
adjusted dose of dilantin for appropriate level.
.
# COPD: Continued spiriva, inhalers.
.
# Esophageal adenocarcinoma: Patient is status-post trea
