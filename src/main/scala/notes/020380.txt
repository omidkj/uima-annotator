He was taken urgently to the operating room where he underwent a

condition on levophed, epinephrine and neosynephrine. He was
placeed on flagyl prophylactically for his teeth given that he
was unable to get dental clearance prior to his valve surgery.
He was extubated on POD #1. IABP was dc'd on POD #2, and his
vasoactive drips were weaned to off. He was pancultured for a
fever, the cultures were negative. He was transferred to the
floor  on POD #3. His epicardial wires were removed.  A dental
