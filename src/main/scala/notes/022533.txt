Hypotension

History of Present Illness:
72 year old male with h/o CVA with expressive aphasia, OSA, AS,
CAD, OSA on BiPap and chronic systolic CHF (EF30-35%) who was
sent in to the ED by his VNA for hypotension (SBPs in 80s),
slurred speech, lethargy/unresponsiveness.

The patient's son stated that although he was unsure of what led
to his hypotension in this situation, the patient has a history
of inappropriately taking his medications including doubling up
on his medications or taking the same medication repeatedly and
skipping other medications. Of note, the patient was recently
discharged home from a rehabilitation facility following an
admission at [**Hospital1 18**] for altered mental status and acute renal
failure. Since discharge from rehab the patient's son stated
that his father has had problems with his CPAP and was unsure
how frequently he was able to use it.

In the ED, initial vital signs were T:97.3, HR:92, BP:120/62,
SO2:100% on NRB. He was not responsive. Initial labs in the ED
revealed a sodium of 130, K of 7.4 without evidence of peaked T
waves on EKG, a BUN of 207, a serum creatinine of 7.0, a BNP of
[**Numeric Identifier 37155**], and a Troponin-I of 0.12. Initial ABG showed profound
acidosis: 7.01/90/135/25 which was persistent through the
afternoon. He was Bipap'ed with some improvement in mental
status. Subsequently received Calcium gluconate 6 gm IV,
Dextrose and Insulin, NaHCO3 50 mEq, and Kayexalate 60g. He also
received ASA 600 mg PR given his elevated troponins. He
additionally received Levaquin 250 mg IV and Vancomycin 1g IV
x1. He was eventually intubated and brought to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

Of note, pt was recently admitted for AMS/unresponsiveness in
the setting of having taken Ativan for abdominal MRI. He was
admitted to MICU for acute on chronic respiratory acidosis
(thought to be due to Ativan o/d, obesity hypoventilation
syndrome, and diaphragm paresis); there he was weaned from Bipap
uneventfully, and was diuresed for volume overload. On the
floor, he was weaned to 2L NC (baseline at home), continued
Bipap 15/8 for goal O2 >92%, was initially diuresed with rise in
his Cr from 1.5 to 3.6. His creatinine had returned to
approximately baseline (1.3) by discharge. Before this, he's had
several admissions for HF exacerbations with documented weight
gains, HF symptoms, and was diuresed each time. Some notes
indicate poor ability to take care of self at home, med
noncompliance, Bipap non compliance, etc.

A complete ROS was unable to be obtained as the patient was
intubated by arrival to the floor but the patient's son stated
that his father had a cold over the last month with a productive
cough and rhinorrhea but no fevers (no further ROS was
obtainable as he had not seen his father in days).

[**11-29**] CT HEAD:
No evidence of an acute intracranial process. Large chronic
infarction in the left hemisphere.

[**11-29**] CXR

FINDINGS: Evaluation is limited due to low lung volumes and body
habitus. As
compared to the prior examination increased fullness of the hila
and
prominence of the vasculature could represent additional volume
overload.
Right apical opacity correlates with a distend right internal
jugular vein.
Linear and bibasilar opacities most likely reflect atelectasis.
No
pneumothorax is seen.

IMPRESSION: Findings compatible with chronic congestive heart
failure.

[**11-30**] TTE
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free
wall function. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area
1.0cm2). Mild to moderate ([**12-12**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severe aortic valve stenosis. Normal biventricular
cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic
function. Mild-moderate aortic regurgitation. Right ventricular
cavity enlargement with borderline normal free wall motion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2150-4-22**],
global left ventricular systolic function is improved and the
gradient across the aortic valve is increased. The severity of
aortic regurgitation is similar.

CXR [**12-15**]:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2151-12-9**], there are
continued low lung volumes, which enhances the prominence of the
transverse diameter of the heart. Some indistinctness of
pulmonary vessels is consistent with increased pulmonary venous
pressure. There are some areas of atelectasis at the bases.  A
small area of asymmetry in the mid zone on the right could
conceivably represent a developing focus of consolidation,
though it could merely reflect
some crowding of engorged vessels.  Central catheter is now in
place that extends to the lower portion of the SVC.
