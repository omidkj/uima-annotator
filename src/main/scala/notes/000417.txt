Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8850**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, neutropenia, and swollen, painful left elbow

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line placement


History of Present Illness:
61-year-old right-handed woman with glioblastoma multiforme, s/p
subtotal resection on [**2156-7-2**], involved-field cranial XRT, and
chemotherapy (last taken on [**2156-9-10**]).  She developed a fever to
102 F, hypotension to SBP 90s today, and came to our emergency
room.  Husband first noted left elbow 3-4 weeks ago which
resolved in 2 days after application of neosporin (there was a
question of spider bite).  Then 3 days ago she noted erythema
which increased and associated with increasing edema and
tenderness.  Today, the patient was practically unable to move
elbow due to pain.  She experienced fever and chills that began
yesterday, but she did not take her temperature.  Her Review of
System is notable for a new dry cough x 6 days.  She also
developed diarrhea but stopped 3 days ago when she stopped
taking Colace.  She has fatigue but no SOB, congestion,
abdominal pain, dysuria, bright red blood per rectum, or melena.
 There was no trauma to elbow.  There was no recent sick
contacts or travel.

Regarding her oncologic history, her symptoms began in late [**Month (only) 205**]
[**2155**] with headache, word-finding difficulties, memory loss, and
confusion.  She was found to have a left parietal brain lesion.
After subtotal resection on [**2156-7-2**], underwent involved-field
XRT with concurrent temozolomid.  She also received 1 treatment
with CyberKnife radiosurgery to an enhancing lesion in the right
occipital lobe, together with temozolomide.

In the emergency room, her temperature was 102.6 F, HR 130s
(sinus tachycardia), and systolic BP 90s-100s (baseline SBP
120s-130s). Her WBC was 0.3 with no neutrophils or bands.  Her
U/A showed no WBC but there was nitrates and bacteria.  Her
serum lactate was 3.9.  Blood and urine cultures were sent. Her
chest CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism, but there was
mild left lung apical patchy ground-glass opacity; there was a
question of atelectasis versus pneumonia.  She received oxygen
at 7 liters via nasal cannula in the emergency room but her
systolic BP persisted in 90s-100s.  Emergency Department did not
start on sepsis protocol because her serum lactate was not > 4
and she was responsive to fluid, despite the elevated
temperature, heart rate, and WBC.

Pulmonary: CTA bilaterally
Abdomen:  NABS, soft, NT/ND, well-healed vertical [**Doctor First Name **] incision
Extremities: LUE elbow has 5-cm area of erythema, warmth, mild
fluctuance, and tenderness to palpation.  She is unable to
abduct at elbow more than 5 degrees secondary to pain.  Her
lower extremities are cool, without c/c/e.  She has 2+ dorsalis
pedis pulses bilaterally
Neurologic Examination:  Her mental status is intact.  She is
awake, alert, and oriented x 3.  Her language is fluent with
good comprehension.  CN II-XII are intact.  Her motor strength
is [**4-15**] motor in RUE; LUE examination limited due to pain at
elbow.  In the lower extremities, she has 4-/5 strength
bilaterally at thigh flexors, 5/5 strength at quadriceps,
hamstrings, foot dorsiflexion, and plantar flexion.  Her
reflexes are 2- but her ankle jerks are absent.  She has
downgoing toes.  Sensory examination reveals normal sensory
examination.  Coordination examination does not reveal
dysmetria.  Her gait is steady.  She does not have a Romberg.

L elbow Xray [**2156-9-19**]: Four radiographs of the left elbow
demonstrate no joint effusion. No fracture. No cortical
fragmentation to suggest osteomyelitis. Regional soft tissues
are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
Unremarkable radiographs, left elbow.

MRI of L elbow: MR LEFT ELBOW WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is a
moderate elbow joint effusion. The bone marrow appears normal in
signal intensity characteristics. There is circumferential edema
within the subcutaneous tissues about the elbow. There is fluid
signal intensity in the region of the olecranon bursa,
suggestive of bursitis. There is more confluent high signal
intensity surrounding the musculature at the elbow joint. It is
not clear if this represents dense edema or frank fluid, as this
study is limited without intravenous contrast. Also noted is
diffuse increased signal intensity within the musculature about
the elbow, suggestive of myositis.

IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate elbow joint effusion.
2. Diffuse increased signal intensity within the musculature
about the elbow, consistent with nonmyositis.
3. Olecranon bursitis.
4. Edema within the subcutaneous tissues about the elbow,
suggestive of cellulitis.

CT OF THE CHEST: There are no significant axillary, mediastinal,
or hilar lymph nodes. There is a small hypodense area in the
left lobe of the thyroid measuring 1.2 x 0.8 cm. Ultrasound
could be performed for further evaluation.

There is no pericardial effusion. The heart is of normal size.
The great vessels are unremarkable. There is no evidence of
aortic dissection. There is fluid in the pericardial recess
anterior to the aorta, which is unchanged when compared to prior
study. The pulmonary artery is normal size. There are no filling
defects in the pulmonary artery branches. There is no evidence
of pulmonary embolism. The airway is patent to level of
subsegmental bronchi. There are subsegmental atelectasis in the
right middle lobe and lower lobes. There are emphysematous
changes in the lungs. There is a patchy ground-glass opacity in
the left upper lobe near the apex that is new when compared to
the prior study and of unclear significance. It most likely
represents an area of pneumonia. There are no pleural effusions.
Limited images of the upper abdomen do not reveal significant
abnormality.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Emphysema.
3. Subsegmental atelectasis.
4. Small patchy ground-glass opacity in the left apex of unknown
clinical significance. It could representa smal
