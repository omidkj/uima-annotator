HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 70 year old male
transferred from [**Hospital3 23439**] Hospital, where he was admitted
on [**2126-11-7**] with chest pain.  The patient was eating
his [**Holiday 1451**] dinner when he noted a tight squeezing in
his chest with pain into his arms and neck, no shortness of
breath, positive diaphoresis, no nausea or vomiting.  The
patient was unable to eat his dessert.

The patient was started on heparin and nitroglycerin at the
outside hospital and was transferred to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
[**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for cardiac catheterization for a non-Q wave
myocardial infarction.  The patient never had chest pain like
this before, no previous catheterization.  His chest pain was
relieved after eight to ten hours.

The patient was in his usual state of health until prior to
this episode, without nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills,
shortness of breath, abdominal pain or diarrhea.  The patient
also was complaining of abdominal bloating.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination on admission,
the patient had a temperature of 98.7, pulse 56, blood
pressure 135/74 and oxygen saturation 92% in room air.

ears, nose and throat:  Normocephalic, atraumatic,
extraocular movements intact, oropharynx clear.  Neck:  No
jugular venous distention or bruits.  Lungs:  Clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and
rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmur, rub or gallop
appreciated.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended,
positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing
or edema, right groin bruit, 1+ pulses bilaterally.
Neurologic examination:  Alert and oriented times three,
moving all extremities.

LABORATORY DATA:  Admission CK was 67, white blood cell count
10.9, hematocrit 45.3, platelet count 231,000, calcium 10.3,
phosphorous 5, albumin 4.6, magnesium 2.1, sodium 141,
potassium 4.7, chloride 100, bicarbonate 32, BUN 32,
creatinine 1.3 and glucose 96.  CKs at the outside hospital
were 175, 476 and 327 with a peak of 476 at 2:19 in the
morning on [**2126-11-8**].  MBs were 10.3, 54.5 and 38.5
respectively with an MB index of 5.89, 11.45 and 11.77.
Troponin peaked at 149 at the outside hospital, unclear what
this correlates to on our scale.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiovascular:  The patient was
admitted with chest pain and a non-Q wave myocardial
infarction. On [**2126-11-11**], he had a cardiac
catheterization performed.  It showed a pulmonary capillary
wedge pressure of 29 with cardiac output of 2.78, left
ventricular pressure 160/21, pulmonary artery pressure
elevated at 62/34.  Left ventriculography was not performed
due to elevated filling pressures.  Coronary angiography
showed a right dominant system with a normal left main,
diffuse 60% mid-left anterior descending artery, 80% diagonal
one, 70% proximal left circumflex with 99% mid to distal
right coronary artery, it filled mainly via left-to-right
collaterals.

The patient was placed on aspirin and intravenous heparin.
Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted from the catheterization
laboratory.  The patient was evaluated by cardiothoracic
surgery and was taken for coronary artery bypass grafting
initially intended to be on [**2126-11-12**].
Unfortunately, during the preoperative preparations, the
patient was unable to have a Foley inserted.  The team
attempted for approximately three hours.  Urology was called
intraoperatively to attempt Foley placement.  The patient
ultimately ended up having a cold knife urethrotomy performed
on the table with a rigid cystoscope by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  This
negated the coronary artery bypass grafting being done on
this date and the patient was subsequently brought back to
the floor and intended to have coronary artery bypass
grafting the following day.

On [**2126-11-14**], the patient underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting times four with a left internal mammary
artery to the left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein
graft to the posterior descending artery, saphenous vein
graft to the obtuse marginal and saphenous vein graft to the
diagonal one.  The patient did well with this procedure and
was transferred to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit,
ultimately going to the floor under the cardiothoracic
surgery service.

The patient was doing fairly well until [**2126-11-18**],
when he was found to have a rapid rhythm with new atrial
fibrillation.  He had had a brief episode of atrial
fibrillation one day prior, which was treated successfully
with Lopressor and amiodarone.

On [**2126-11-18**], the patient had a left bundle branch
block while he was in atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular response.  Given this and his slightly low blood
pressure compared to baseline, the patient was transferred to
the Coronary Care Unit service and had a cardioversion in the
Coronary Care Unit with 200 joules times one.  The patient
immediately cardioverted into sinus rhythm.  He was stable
following this episode, however, there was concern about
possible ischemia precipitating the arrhythmia and causing
the left bundle branch block.

The patient subsequently went back to the cardiac
catheterization laboratory on [**2126-11-18**].  The repeat
catheterization showed diffusely diseased left main, a
diffusely diseased, 70%, left anterior descending artery
after the large competitive flow in distal left anterior
descending artery and diagonal, left circumflex with 70%
ostial stenosis with severe diffuse disease and competitive
flow in obtuse marginal, totally occluded right coronary
artery in the mid-portion, saphenous vein graft to the
posterior descending artery 90% aorto-ostial stenosis with a
TIMI-II flow, saphenous vein graft to diagonal patent with
mild kinking in mid-portion, saphenous vein graft to obtuse
marginal 30% ostial, left internal mammary artery to left
anterior descending artery mild kinking in mid-graft and near
anastomosis.

The patient ultimately underwent percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty and stent placement at the saphenous
vein graft to the posterior descending artery with TIMI-III
flow.  He was placed on aspirin and Plavix and sent back to
the Coronary Care Unit.

The patient continued to do well following this intervention.
He did not have any recurrent atrial fibrillation and his
rate was controlled on amiodarone in addition to low dose
Lopressor 12.5 mg twice a day.  The patient had his sheaths
pulled and was ultimately discovered to have a right groin
bruit.  He was found to have an arteriovenous fistula after
having an ultrasound.  This was evaluated by vascular surgery
and thought to be appropriate for an outpatient workup.

The patient was placed on an amiodarone drip intermittently,
which was ultimately switched over to oral amiodarone,
especially in the setting of a low left ventricular ejection
fraction of 15%.  Of note, the patient did not ha
