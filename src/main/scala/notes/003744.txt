Blood Cultures from [**2199-9-7**]: Pending

Imaging:
CXR [**8-24**]: An endotracheal tube tip lies 5.7 cm above the carina.
Nasogastric tube appears appropriately positioned. The patient
is rotated. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is obscured by a
prominent retrocardiac opacity with air bronchograms. The
central vessels are enlarged consistent with known pulmonary
hypertension. There is also a right basilar opacity.
.



Brief Hospital Course:
72 y/o F with hx of pulm HTN on Remodulin, PE and CHF who
presented to an OSH on [**8-23**] with hematemesis and hct form
45-->29. She clinically deteriorated from a respiratory
standpoint, sats in 70s while vomiting, and was urgently
intubated. Her INR was reversed with FFP and she received a
total of 5 u PRBCs. She then had an endoscopy showing a
non-bleeding gastric ulcer. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
Remodulin therapy given the OSH pharmacy did not carry the
medicine.
.
On arrival here, she was intubated and sedated. She had a stable
hct. Her SBP was moderately low and levophed was started. Her BP
was thought to be secondary to sedation. GI was consulted and
did not feel a need to rescope her given her stable hct.
Pharmacy was consulted and converted her remodulin to an IV pump
form.
.
# UGIB: OSH report with photos of large gastric ulcer, no longer
bleeding. Her anticoagulation was held, her hct remained stable,
and she was placed on a PPI.  GI was consulted and saw no
indication for further endoscopy.
.
# Hypotension: Occurred in setting of sedation for vent/line and
with increase in PEEP. She required levophed transiently, and
was weaned successfully.
.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure: In setting of UGIB likely [**3-12**]
aspiration. Has underlying hypoxia at baseline from Pulmonary
Hypertension (on baseline 5L nc). No pneumonitis or infiltate
seen on CXR but given underlying lung disease was treated
empirically until cultures returned negative.  For her severe
pulmonary hypertension she was continued on remodulin and
sildenafil, and the remodulin was discontinued successfully
prior to discharge.  She was successfully weaned from the
ventilator.
.
# SVT: Intermittently tachy to 130s with a known h/o SVT.  Here
she intermittently converted in to Afib/flutter.  She was kept
on telemetry, resuscitated with blood, and treated with AV nodal
blocking agents, including diltiazem and digoxin.
.
# Pulmonary Embolus: On admission the patient was anticoagulated
for a recent PE.  Her INR was reversed given GIB. Her
anticoagulation was held for a period and then restarted to in
light of need to minimize right heart strain in pt with severe
pulmonary hypertension.
.
# The patient is DNR/DNI.
