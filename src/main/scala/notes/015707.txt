Brief Hospital Course:
30 y/o male with h/o HTN, asthma, anxiety, ETOH abuse admitted
with alcohol intoxication. See HPI. Given his transient desat,
he was initially transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. However, O2 sats improved
as pt woke up and he was transfered to floor shortly after. He
was given fluids and supportive care as he sobered up. He did
not have any evidence of withdrawal at time of discharge. He did
have mild transaminitis likely ETOH related and was strongly
counseled on ETOH cessation to prevent long-term sequela. He
initially had lactic and ketoacidosis with gap of 24, this
resolved with IVFs.  He was very anxious while here and states
he always becomes anxious in the hospital and made it clear that
it was not his withdrawal. He got a dose of ativan for anxiety
but did not require any benzo;s from withdrawal perspected. He
was reccommended to speak with SW regarding his ETOh abuse and
treatment, however pt stated that his family is very supportive
and have already been working on getting him into outpt
treatment programs.  Nursing did overhear a phone converstaion
with family supporting this. He also has a counseler as outpt
that is involved. He was discharged in stable condition. His
other meds for HTN, asthma, depression are kept the same on
discharge. As for his transient hypoxia while sedated, he may
very well has OSA given his body habitus and posterior crowding
on exam. Can consider outpt sleep study if pt interested. Likely
contributing to his HTN (along with ETOH)

time spent on d/c day management is greater than 30min
