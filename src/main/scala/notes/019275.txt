Service:  Neurology

REASON FOR ADMISSION/CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Mr. [**Known lastname 46153**]
presented with a right-sided weakness and increasing
lethargy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 80-year-old male with
old ischemic infarction and some residual right hemiparesis,
hypertension, and atrial fibrillation (on warfarin with an
INR of 2.5) who presented with increasing right-sided
weakness on [**2192-3-12**].

He subsequently worsened with profound right facial droop and
lethargy.  He was taken to the [**Hospital 16843**] Hospital where he
was found to have a left .................... bleed by
computed tomography scan.  He was given vitamin K and 6 units
of fresh frozen plasma and transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Ischemic stroke.
2.  Coronary artery disease.
3.  Atrial fibrillation.
4.  Hypertension.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Warfarin.
2.  Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4.  Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Paxil p.o. q.d.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He smoked but quit many years ago.  He
drinks socially.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed an elderly male in no acute distress.  Temperature
was 96.4, blood pressure was 154/70, heart rate was 62,
respiratory rate was 18, and oxygen saturation was 100% on 2
liters nasal cannula.  Head and neck examination revealed
normocephalic and atraumatic.  The neck was supple.
Cardiovascular examination revealed an irregular rhythm,
normal rate.  Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Extremity
examination revealed positive pulses.  Neurologic examination
revealed sleepy with extreme lethargy after Benadryl.  Speech
was dysarthric but fluent.  Comprehension was intact.
Cranial nerve examination revealed pupils were equal, round,
and reactive to light briskly.  Funduscopic examination was
normal.  Extraocular movements were full.  Visual fields were
full.  There was a right facial droop with intact palatal
elevation and midline tongue protrusion.  Motor examination
revealed no tremor.  Normal bulk and tone.  There was a right
pronator drift.  His strength was antigravity in both arms,
but the right arm moves much less than the left.  The right
leg appeared to be stronger than the right arm.  Sensory
examination revealed the patient withdrew to noxious stimuli.
Reflexes were brisker on the right than on the left with
extensive plantar reflexes on the right.  Coordination
testing revealed no ataxia appreciated.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  INR was 2.5.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 46153**] was admitted to the
Intensive Care Unit for blood pressure control.  He was
successfully weaned off intravenous blood pressure
medications and converted to oral antihypertensive agents.

His neurologic examination improved over the course of the
hospitalization.  He regained some strength on the
hemiparetic side.  At the time of this dictation, he had
mild-to-moderate upper motor neuron weakness in the right
side with arm greater than leg weakness and proximal greater
than distal weakness.

His bleed was reevaluated with a head computed tomography
scan which revealed a left lenticular nucleus bleed which
involved the left internal capsule.  Subsequent computed
tomography scans have shown stable bleed without evidence of
further extension or ventricular involvement or mass effect.

While in the Intensive Care Unit, he had several episodes of
tachycardia followed by bradycardia, and Cardiology was
consulted.  The decision was made to place a pacemaker, which
he tolerated without problems.  His rhythm remained in atrial
fibrillation with an AV paced rhythm.  He was started on
amiodarone.

The remainder of his Intensive Care Unit stay was stable and
unremarkable, and he was transferred to the regular [**Hospital1 **]
service for further management.  He was found to have a left
lower lobe infiltrate and was started on levofloxacin.  He
also had mild pulmonary edema, and this was treated
successfully with furosemide.

Given the risk of ischemic infarction from his atrial
fibrillation, we have restarted his warfarin at 3 mg p.o.
q.d.  As he is also taking amiodarone, our goal INR is
between 2 and 3.

At the time of this dictation, Mr. [**Known lastname 46153**] is clinically
stable and appropriate for emphasis on his rehabilitation.
He continues to have right hand weakness and inability to
perform fine motor skills.  Therefore, he will benefit from
Occupational Therapy as well as Physical Therapy for his
hemiparesis.

His amiodarone schedule will be continued at 400 mg p.o.
b.i.d. for four more days; and then 400 mg p.o. q.d. for
three months; and then 200 mg p.o. q.d. thereafter.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was improved.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to a rehabilitation facility.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Left basoganglia bleed with internal capsule involvement.
2.  Right hemiparesis (which is improving).

SECONDARY DIAGNOSES:
1.  Atrial fibrillation.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Old ischemic stroke.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d. (for six more days).
2.  Warfarin 3 mg p.o. q.d. (check INR in two days' time for
a goal INR of 2 to 3).
3.  Lopressor 100 mg p.o. t.i.d.
4.  Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Hydralazine 50 mg p.o. q.6h.
6.  Enalapril 10 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
8.  Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. times four more days; and
then 400 mg p.o. q.d. for three months; and then 200 mg p.o.
q.d. thereafter.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  Mr. [**Known lastname 46153**] was to follow up with Cardiology here at
the [**Hospital1 69**].
2.  The patient should follow up with the Stroke Service with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1004**] (telephone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1694**]).
