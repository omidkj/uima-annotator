[**2120-3-30**] pCXR:
FINDINGS: Exam is limited by low lung volumes and slight
rotation. Linear
right basilar atelectasis is present with otherwise clear lungs.
Heart size is normal and aorta is tortuous. No pneumothorax or
pleural effusion is present. Several old right-sided rib
fractures are present.
IMPRESSION: No pneumonia.

[**2120-3-30**] CT abn/pelvis w/o:
ABDOMEN: There is minimal dependent atelectasis, particularly at
the right
base which is little changed from the prior study. The partially
visualized heart appears normal. Evaluation of solid organs is
limited by lack of IV contrast. Within these limitations, the
spleen, adrenals, pancreas, and liver appear normal. There is
hyperdense material within the gallbladder, likely reflecting
vicarious excretion of contrast from CT examination two days
prior. Two cysts are seen within the left kidney, and upper pole
cyst measuring 1.5 cm and a mid pole cyst measuring 7 x 8 cm. No
stones or hydronephrosis is present. The right kidney appears
normal. The stomach and abdominal loops of small bowel appear
normal. No free air or free fluid is present. No
