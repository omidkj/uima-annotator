History of Present Illness:
41yo woman with history of DM1, ESRD s/p transplant in '[**40**],
CAD s/p CABG, PVD, CHF with EF of 45%, and HTN was admitted
to [**Hospital6 33**] on ([**1-16**]) for Diabetic ketoacidosis.
She initially presented on ([**1-13**]) for evaluation of "abnormal
labs",
which revealed an anion gap of 13, sodium of 131, and glucose of
91. She was sent home with instructions to maintain hydration.
On morning of admission to [**Hospital6 **], she was found
by her mother to be suffering from nausea/vomiting, and this
persisted for many hours. She became progressively lethargic,
diaphoretic and pale.
At the outside hospital, she had significant acidosis with
initial ABG of 6.80/11/158 on FiO2 of 21%. Anion gap was 32.
Glucose was > 1000. Initial bicarb was less than 3. She had no
evidence of UTI on UA, and no evidence of any focal infiltrates
on chest xray. Urine and blood cultures were no growth to date
at time of transfer. EKG demonstrated sinus tachycardia at
121bpm with nl axis and intervals; there were increased/consider
hyperacute T waves in V1-3, and she had inverted T waves in V5-6
(seen on previous). Cardiac enzymes were negative with CK of 42,
and troponin of less than 0.01.
.
She was intubated in the emergency department ther for lethargy
and profound tachypnea. She was managed with IVF and insulin
drip. She had a right subclavian TLC placed. Her anion gap had
closed to 11 on day of transfer ([**2145-1-17**]). On transfer, her
insulin gtt was at 4units/hr, and she was on D51/2NS at
200cc/hr. She was also placed on stress dose hydrocortisone

ICU, and her ventilatory support was weaned down to CPAP/PS.
Last ABG done on

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 19419**] was extubated on [**1-18**]. Anion gap closed with
insulin gtt. D5 1/2NS given at 200mL/hr. Complicated by episode
of flash pulmonary edema with HR 150s-160s - resolved with IV
lasix, morphine, IV lopressor. Ruled out with three negative
troponins. [**Last Name (un) **] service consulted, who suggested regimen of
lantus 20U qHS with humalog SSI. Lantus started that evening as
pt started taking PO, insulin gtt d/c'ed four hours later. On
[**1-20**], pt spiked to 101.4, CXR showing consolidation at lung
bases, probably [**3-4**] residual pulmoanry edema and atelectasis,
but can't r/o PNA. On levofloxacin 500mg PO q24h (started
[**1-17**]). ABG done: 7.4/27/96/17, lactate 1.4. has been afebrile
since. Transplant surgery consulted, recommended daily prograf
levels with goal [**6-6**], and qod rapamune levels with goal [**6-5**].
This AM, rapamune level subtherapic, increased dose to 3mg qD.
Had been giving stress dose steroids, d/c'ed and placed back on
chronic dose of 4mg qD due to no evidence of adrenal
insufficiency.

On transfer to floor, pt taking adequate PO, but somewhat
limited [**3-4**] sore throat, most likely [**3-4**] intubation. Given
cepacol lozenges, receiving tid sugar-free shakes with diabetic
diet per nutrition recommendation. on AML, AG 13, bicarb 16,
serum acetone positve, indicating and overlying element of
starvation ketosis [**3-4**] poor PO intake. She admitted eating
poorly over the past couple of weeks prior to admission.

After transfer to floor, BS remained [**Month/Day (2) **]. Glargine
increased to 28U qHS, with more aggressive sliding scale, which
resulted in much improved control. Her PO intake continued to
improve, and was taking a full consistency diet by time of d/c.
She was discharged to home on Glargine 28U qHS, and the most
recently utilized Humalog sliding scale. Transplant surgery was
satisfied with her Prograf and Rapamune regimens. She was d/c'ed
with the remainder of her levofloxacin regimen. A f/u
appointment with her PCP at [**Name9 (PRE) 191**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1852**], was made for
[**2145-2-11**]. She also has a f/u appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
renal transplant on [**2145-2-5**]. She was instructed to call [**Last Name (un) **]
to make an appointment within the next 2 weeks.
