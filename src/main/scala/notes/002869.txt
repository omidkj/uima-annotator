Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 30476**] is a 78 year-old man with a history significant for
CAD, s/p pacer, depression, baseline dementia, and skin cancer
of nose who presented on [**2193-8-10**] with a left facial droop,
drooling, and left sided weakness.  Subsequent CT scan at
[**Hospital3 **] showed right frontal lobe hemorrhage.  He
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, then admitted to the NICU service.
On presentation, he denied headache, nausea, vomiting, visual
changes, numbness, dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain,
abdominal pain.  Wife noted no changes in balance, gait, tremor,
shaking, or seizure.  He has had a 50lb. weight loss over a year
and has is on pureed diet at baseline.  On [**8-10**], patient ruled
out for MI.  Repeat CT confirmed presence of 4.5 x 3.5 x 8.0 cm
right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.  CTA showed no
evidence of abnormal vascular structures to indicate AVM.  EKG
demonstrated A- and V- paced 60bpm, TWI avL, LAD.  Repeat CT on
[**8-12**] no change in hemorrhage or edema and no mass effect.

Management has included BP control with metoprolol, seizure
prophylaxis with phenytoin, and treatment for suspected UTI with
SMX-TMP.  UA/urine culture was negative for bacteria and yeast.
Blood cultures drawn on [**8-11**] are still pending.  Sputum from
[**8-11**] was positive for coag+ staph. aureus.  Pulmonary status
was initially managed with albulterol, fluticasone, and
ipratropium.  Psych status was managed with olanzapine,
citalopram, and mirtazapine.  During hospital course, patient
developed lethargy, fluctuant delirium, and mild dysarthria,
concurrent with pulmonary congestion suspicious for pneumonia.
CXR on [**8-13**] confirmed the presence of left lower lobe
infiltrate, and patient was treated with levofloxacin and
metronidazole with clinical improvement -- decreased lethargy,
improved mental status, and improved pulmonary exam with, at
present, mild rhonchi bilaterally.  Repeat CXR on [**8-14**] showed
apparent interval improvement in LLL consolidation.  Due to
nutritional concerns, patient was fed via NG tube plus
supplemental phosphate,
with multiple swallow studies before switching to PO diet.
While on NG tube, patient was on level II restraints to maintain
tube placement.  Presently, neurologic exam has improved
slightly, with decreased lethargy and improved mental status
when awake.  Mild left facial droop and left-sided weakness
persist.  With improved mental status, stable neuro exam,
resolving pneumonia with antibiotics.  He failed a swallow exam
on [**8-19**] for the 3rd time so the decision was made to place a GJ
tube for continued nutrition.  He is now calm, not on
restraints, alert and ready for rehab.
