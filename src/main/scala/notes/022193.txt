Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**]
Chief Complaint:
respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]F with recent discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] ([**2055-6-16**]) for NSTEMI and
CHF, severe MR and Pulmonary HTN presenting with increased
dyspnea.  During previous admission pt was started on Abx but
did not finish, as was deemed not to have PNA; she ultimately
improved with Lasix.  3 days PTA, son-in-law visited pt's
assisted-living facility and saw she was tachypnic.  Today
daughter visited and saw that she was in severe respiratory
distress, with tachypnea and some wheezing.  Patient has
Parkinson's disease and cannot given more history other than
that she is short of breath and denies headache, chest pain,
abdominal pain.  She had not suffered any known illness since
discharge on [**6-20**]; there has been no sputum.  Facility staff
administer all of her medications.  Pt was brought by EMTs to
ED.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 97.5 78 132/58 20 100% 15L.  On
physical exam there were reportedly rales 75% up lungs
bilaterally.  She improved with nebulizers, but still breathing
at 25-30 and requiring Venturi mask. Pt resisted BIPAP.  Got
methylprednisolone 125mg and CTX/azithro.  Lasix held due to
SBP<95.  ECG showed atrial fibrillation, rate 60s, no ST
elevations, troponin 0.08 (downtrending from previous
admission), BNP 8673.

Past Medical History:
 CHF: admitted [**Date range (1) 96195**] with dyspnea, found to have BNP [**Numeric Identifier **].
TTE revealed moderate to severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], severe pulmonary HTN,
and EF 55-60%.  Symptoms improved with Lasix and she was
discharged to her [**Hospital3 **] facility.  Torsemide and
spironolactone as outpatient.
- Coronary artery disease/NSTEMI: s/p 3V CABG in [**2123**].  In her
CHF hospitalization last month, troponin peak to 0.39 and EKG
with evidence of prior inferolateral MI. Given h/o severe
bradycardia and family's reluctance to place a pacemaker, a
beta-blocker was not started.  She was started on high dose
atorvastatin and continued on ASA.
- Atrial Fibrillation w/ [**1-27**] second pauses and periods of
bradycardia to high 30s. On coumadin.
- Bacterial pneumonia (s/p hospitalization in [**6-/2139**]); daughter
reports that pt has had many PNAs, including Legionella,
beginning with one debilitating episode of several months before
the antibiotic era.
- Parkinsonism (essential tremor but no cogwheel phenomenon)
- Diabetes mellitus (currently not requiring treatment)
- Hypertension (well-controlled with baseline 120s/80s)
- Hyperlipidemia
- Acid reflux
- s/p TAH-BSO
- s/p cholecystectomy
- s/p bilateral cataract surgery
- hypothyroidism

The patient currently lives alone in Springhouse ([**Hospital 4382**]) in [**Location (un) 538**] where she gets OT, PT, and medication
assistance. Also gets assistance in shower and while eating. Her

husband passed away in [**2129**]. She was a nurse at the [**Hospital3 **]
Hospital as a young woman.  Her daughter is on the board of the
hospital and her son-in-law is a pediatrician; they visit her
very frequently and keep close track of her health issues.

living with diabetes.

palpation, no rebound or guarding
Ext: Warm, well perfused, 1+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or
edema.
Neuro: Patient intermittently attentive to examination.
CNII-XII grossly intact, [**3-30**] handgrip strength.  Increased
resting tone in upper/lower extremities, with resting tremor.
1+ biceps/brachioradialis reflexes.  No clonus.  Downgoing toes.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname 2155**] [**Known lastname 41171**] is a [**Age over 90 **]F with CHF, CAD, Afib, COPD, Parkinson's
who was brought to the ED from her [**Hospital3 **] facility for
respiratory distress and transferred to the ICU for presumed CHF
and/or COPD exacerbation.  After receiving albuterol +
ipratropium nebulizers, methylprednisolone, azithromycin, and
CTX, her distress resolved and she quickly returned to her
baseline.

# Respiratory distress: sx responded to steroids and nebulizers;
pt now comfortable.  Patient had no known history of recent
illness, no fever, no sputum production, and CXR showed only
improvement of prior effusions. The etiology of her respiratory
distress was felt to be mucus plugging. While COPD may have
complicated the clinical picture, the patient has no signs of
infection to suggest COPD exacerbation. The patient also has CHF
and pulmonary HTN, which may have made her even more suceptible
to acute respiratory disress. However, she was not felt to be
clinically volume overloaded and did no require diuresis to
improve. It was not felt that steroids or antibiotics were
necessary on discharge.

# HTN/diastolic CHF: TTE on previous admission reveals EF 55-60%
but with moderate-to-severe MR and pulmonary HTN.  Clinical
picture is consistent with primarily left-sided HF: evidence of
pulmonary congestion with no peripheral edema (but elevated
JVP).  Afib also contributes to diastolic failure.  The patient
was seen by cardiology in the hospital, who recommended daily
weights on discharge, and stopping spironolactone for high K.
They also helped coordinate a follow up appointment soon after
discharge.

# Parkinson's: pt's PD limits communication.  Per daughter, pt's
current level of interaction is her baseline.

# Hypothyroidism. home levothyroxine was continued

# CAD: continued home ASA, coumadin

# ?h/o Sz: no dx of seizure disorder per record; EEG [**2140-12-20**]
negative for sz but possibly with epileptogenic focusL continued
home keppr
