Imaging:
1. C-Spine (portable): In comparison with the study of [**7-7**], the
area of the fracture of the dens is very poorly seen. There
appears to be some posterior displacement of the body of C2,
though it is difficult to determine whether there is any change
from the previous study. Some soft tissue prominence is again
seen at this level. CT may be necessary to properly evaluate the
degree of displacement.
2. CXR: Questionable new rounded hazy opacities, could be
artifactual from rib ends, but cannot exclude other processes
such as septic emboli or traumatic etiology.

Brief Hospital Course:
# C2 dens fracture: Patient had originally been hospitalized in
[**4-28**] after the fall from his wheelchair resulting in C2 dens
fracture. At the time, the decision was made to manage him
conservatively and patient was discharged to rehab. However,
fracture did not heal well and patient developed progressive
neurologic loss from spinal cord compression. After medical
clearance, patient was admitted to the ortho spine service,
where he underwent C1-C4 posterior fusion. Postoperatively he
was transferred to the TSICU and kept intubated. He was
successfully extubated and then underwent HD per normal regimen.
He normally is slightly hypotensive during dialysis and required
midodrine. He was transfused 2 units of pRBC at dialysis.
Patient did well and then was transferred to the medical floor
prior to discharge.
.
# ESRD: Patient is well known to the renal service. He was kept
on his Tue/[**Last Name (un) **]/Sat dialysis schedule while inpatient. He
received midodrine to keep him normotensive during dialysis.
Creatinine ranged from 2.1 to 5.5 during this hospitalization.
He was kept on his home medications including nephrocaps and
calcium acetate. His volume  status and electrolytes were
closely monitored.
.
# History of recurrent UTIs: UA on admission was concerning for
UTI. Patient has a history of numerous resistent pathogens (VRE,
ESNL, klebsiella). While on the ortho service received one dose
of Vanco in OR and was started on bactrim, which was
discontinued after urine culture came back negative. Foley was
removed after transfer to the medicine floor. Patient remained
afebrile with no leukocytosis, and thus did not require any
antibiotics treatment.
.
# CAD: On admission did not show signs of ACS. Aspirin was held
in the context of surgery. On discharge aspirin was continued
per orthopedics service suggestion.
.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 12731**], you were admitted to the [**Hospital1 **]
Hospital because the fracture in your neck that you had was not
healing on its own and so you decided to have surgery. Your
orthopedic surgeon took bones from your hip and used it to make
a bone graft for your neck. Your neck was also stabilized with
instrumentation inside. After the surgery, you had a breathing
tube, which was removed. You were placed in a soft neck collar
which you have to continue wearing until you see the orthopedic
surgeon for follow-up. Throughout the hospitalization you
continued to get your normal dialysis treatments for end-stage
renal disease. We gave you blood and medicine during dialysis to
keep your blood pressure up. You never had a fever or had
elevated white blood cell after the surgery.
.
We made the following changes to your medications:
1. Calcium Acetate 1334 mg by mouth three times a day WITH meals
