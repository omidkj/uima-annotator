CATHETERIZATION [**2150-7-14**]:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
2. Moderate systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right-dominant
system with
mild diffuse, slightly sluggish flow but no angiographically
apparent
coronary disease in the LMCA, LAD, LCx, or RCA.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a mildly elevated
left-sided
filling pressure (LVEDP 17 mmHg). There was no gradient across
the
aortic valve on pullback of the catheter from the left
ventricle.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred due to elevated creatinine
and
recent echo.
*
ECHO ([**2150-7-14**]):
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is moderate-to-severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis (ejection fraction 30 percent). The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. There is no pericardial effusion.
*
ECHO ([**2150-7-16**]):
1. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate
global left
ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is
moderately depressed.
2. Compared to the findings of the prior study of [**2150-7-14**], left
ventricular
systolic function has improved.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient came to the ED with lethargy, CP, Abd pain, and N/V.
In the ED, she was tachycardic with otherwise stable vital
signs. EKG showed diffuse ST elevations and there was concern
for ST elevation MI. ECHO done in ED showed depressed LVEF
(30%). The patient was brought for cardiac cath and found to
have patent coronaries. The patient was the transferred to the
floor. Night float admitted the patient later that evening, and
saw that she was in DKA with AG of 18 and HCO3 of 11. At that
point, Ms. [**Known lastname 111059**] was transferred to the MICU for further
management. The patient's glucose in the ED was 145. Per
patient's husband, she received 80 units of "cloudy" insulin
prior to coming to the ED.
*
In the MICU, she was aggressively rehydrated with D5NS and
maintained on an insulin gtt. Her lytes were monitored q2h
initially. [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted, as well as cardiology for her
apparent pericarditis. Her potassium and phosphate were
aggressively repleated. [**Last Name (un) **] made recommendations for NPH
doses as well as ISS. They also recommended not restarting
metformin (b/c acidosis) or Actos (b/c low EF). Throughout her
MICU course, the patient's mental status improved dramatically.
She was weaned from her insulin gtt and maintained on NPH with
ISS recommended by the [**Last Name (un) **] team. She began taking PO's well
without N/V.
*
On transfer to the floor, she was taking good PO's without N/V,
and was not having chest pain.  Listed below are a summary of
her issues as dealt with by the floor team:
*
1) DKA: The patient likely had DKA for several days given her
presenting symptoms. Her gap remained resolved for her course on
the floor, and continued to appear euvolemic.  She continued
taking good PO's.  Her electrolytes (specifically potassium and
phosphate) were continually repleated.  While on the floor,
[**Last Name (un) **] followed the patient, and periodically made adjustments
to her insulin sliding scale and basal NPH doses.  At the time
of discharge, she was taking NPH 32u QAM and 24u QPM.  Her
finger sticks were controlled within the range of 100-200 on the
day of discharge.  A follow up appointment was made for Mrs.
[**Known lastname 111059**] to be seen by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3636**] at the [**Hospital **] Clinic on [**7-29**] at 3 pm.
*
2) PERICARDITIS: The patient had diffuse ST elevations on
admission which was consistent with pericarditis.  She also had
elevated troponin on admission (1.21).  She was taken for
immediate cardiac catheterization which showed patent
coronaries.  Her elevated troponin on admission (1.21), was
likely due to perimyocarditis.  Her CK's were followed and
trended down to normal.  A cardiac echo was done initially in
the ED which showed LVEF of 30%, however, no pericardial
effusion. Cardiology was consulted and recommended follow-up in
one with one of the cardiologists at [**Hospital1 18**] (see d/c planning).
She will also have a follow up echo prior to this appointment.
Cardiology also recommended not giving NSAIDs at this time given
that the patient was CP-free.
*
3) CHF: The first ECHO done on Ms. [**Known lastname 111059**] showed an EF of 30%.
Follow up echo before discharge showed that there was improved
systolic function.  Her initial decrease in LVEF was likely
related to her pericarditis.  She was started on Lisinopril and
Metoprolol in the ICU and changed to Toprol XL.
*
4) ARF: On presentation, the patient was in ARF.  This resolved
quickly with with IVF rehydration.
*
5) HIGH WBC: The patient's WBC count on admission was very hig
