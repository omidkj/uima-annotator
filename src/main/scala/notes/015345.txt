up."  referring to his bills, personal medical care tasks and
mail.  He says that "his heart wasn't in it" any more.  He
didn't
want to "live like this anymore."  He realized that "every day
was costing a lot of money" referring to his care at an [**Hospital3 12272**] facility.  He had always wanted to "end it before things

preparations and [**Doctor Last Name **] contemplating suicide ever before.  A
nurse at his housing facility found him in a pool of blood at

and called EMS.

says that he has more hope now.  That he knows he "will be
better."  He regrets bringing any shame upon his son.  When
asked
if he might do such  a thing again he answers,  "I believe that
I
wouldn't."

Mr [**Known lastname 61512**] says that his spirits began to decline one year
