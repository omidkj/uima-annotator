ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
Mr. [**Known lastname 14194**] was in his USOH until [**2163-7-25**] when he
presented with hemoptysis and weight loss of 10 pounds over
previous 1-2 months. He had a CT scan of the chest on [**8-21**] and
it showed a 4.1 x 4.0 right hilar mass with subcarinal
lymphadenopathy, 19 mm right axillary lymph node as well as
multiple right lower lobe and left lower lobe nodules concerning
for lung cancer. On [**2163-8-28**], he was admitted to [**Hospital1 771**] with chest pain and ruled out for a
non-ST elevation MI. He was seen by the hematology-oncology
consult service while in the hospital and underwent FNA of the
right axillary lymph node, the pathology of which showed
nonsmall cell cancer, squamous cell type. He was discharged on
the third of [**Month (only) 359**] and then on [**2163-8-30**], he had a
bronchoscopy done for evaluation of his hemoptysis as well as
bronchial biopsy and the cytology confirmed metastatic nonsmall
cell lung cancer. He has subsequently completed 2 cycles of
Navelbine.

.
Portable Chest ([**2-6**]): Heart size is top normal given technique.

Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, but there is
prominence of the right hilum which, in comparison with the
chest CT of [**2164-1-13**], is suggestive of stable cancer. Decreased
ill-defined airspace opacification in the right upper lobe
abutting the horizontal fissure suggests resolving pneumonia.
There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Pulmonary
vasculature is within normal limits. Osseous structures are
grossly normal.
.
Portable Chest ([**2-7**]): Improving right upper lobe pneumonia.
.
Chest PA and lateral ([**2-8**]): Comparison is made to prior
examination from earlier the same day. The heart is normal in
size. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Again
noted is the opacity in the right upper lobe. This is unchanged.
There is no opacity in the left lower lobe.

Brief Hospital Course:
81y/o M with a PMH of moderate-sever COPD and non-small cell
lung cancer on chemotherapy with Alimta (last given on [**1-31**]) who
presented with a 2 day history of worsening dyspnea. He had been
in his usual state of health (sats 90's on 2.5L NC at home) when
he became more acutely SOB.
.
In the ED, initial vitals: T 98.7, HR 109, BP 137/67, RR 24, O2
100% NRB. He received levofloxacin 750 mg IV, Vancomycin 1g IV,
Ceftriaxone 1g IV, Solu-medrol 125mg IV, 1 LNS. He required
near-continuous Albuterol and Atrovent nebs, RR increased to 50s
when off neb treatment. He was placed on NIPPV 8/5/100 with
improvement in RR to 20s and sat 97%. He was admitted to the
MICU
.
In the ICU, he was gradually weaned off bipap and back down to
his home 2.5L NC with sats in the 89-91 range. Patient
symptomatically felt better. A chest X-ray showed RUL infiltrate
consistent with pneumonia. He continued solumedrol and Abx were
tapered to levaquin alone. In setting of steroids, he also had
FSBS to 470-493 and recived 36 units humalog with FS returning
to 200's.
.
He was called out to general medical floor on [**2-8**]. On floor he
had an episode of tachycardia to 130's, EKG showed new onset
atrial fibrillation. He was started on metoprolol with
improvement in heart rate to 80's. He was switched to diltiazem
and subsequently (~8 hours after episode started) converted to
normal sinus rhythm. After discussing risks vs benefits of
anti-coagulation with patient, he was started on full dose
aspirin.
.
He subsequently developed watery guaiac negative diarrhea, ~4
episodes daily. This combined with rising leukocytosis
(20-->60K) and recent quinolone exposure was initially
concerning for C Diff, but stool was negative for toxin.
Diarrhea was imprving at discharge therefore this was attributed
to side effect of the antibiotics.
.
His respiratory status returned to baseline. He was discharged
on a steroid taper. He was also discharge with Humalog insulin
to be administered per sliding scale until sugars returned to
baseline, had been 300-400's after steroids were intiated.
