History of Present Illness:
ICU issue: hypotension
.
PCP: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2048**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4223**] at [**Hospital1 **] health.
.
HPI:
51F with ESRD on HD, valvular heart disease(4+AR, 3+MR), DVT on
coumadin, now with hypotension on the medical floor starting
this morning. She initially presented with fever and weight gain
from dialysis. She was started on vanc/unasyn empirically to
cover possible line infection or infxn from LE ulcers. In ED,
she had fever to 100.7, WBC 12.2, lactate was 2.0. At dialysis

post 105. BP [**11/2115**] pre, 128/78 post.
   The pt denies fevers, chills, cough, abd pain, she makes no
urine. Over the course of the night bp was trending down. At
11pm it was noted to be 98/47, in the morning rounds was 85/43.
The pt has had no fevers since the ED, WBC down to 9.4 this am
from 12.2. Of note, the pt received lisinopril 20' this am at
0800. Pt was clinically alert and oriented while sitting up in a
chair. Vitals on ICU arrival: T 98.2, 97/38  p92  rr 15  100 on
3L. Her sats were 94% on RA on floor.
.
MICU course:
[**3-8**]: admitted for hypotension.  received IVF. BP stable.

ROS:
All systems were reviewed and were negative except for
aforementioned in the HPI.

Pertinent Results:
.
CXR:
(Prelim read) worsening mild pulmonary edema. R IJ dialysis cath
in good position.
.
ECG: SR at 90 bpm with nl axis/intervals, non-specific TW
changes
.
CT head:
CT OF THE HEAD WITH CONTRAST: The examination is slightly
limited by patient motion, particularly in the posterior fossa.
The presence or absence of acute hemorrhage cannot be assessed
in the presence of contrast, though no gross hemorrhages are
apparent. There is no shift of the normally midline structures.
The ventricles and cisterns are unchanged. The density values of
the brain parenchyma are normal, without definite areas of
pathologic enhancement. There is appropriate opacification of
the intracerebral [**Last Name (un) 1106**] structures. The visualized paranasal
sinuses are well aerated, with a tiny mucus retention cyst
versus polyp in the medial aspect of the left maxillary antrum.
The mastoid air cells are clear. Osseous and soft tissue
structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: No areas of pathologic enhancement within the brain
are detected on this limited exam.

Please note that MRI with diffusion weighted imaging and
gadolinium administration is more sensitive for the detection of
intracranial pathology, including infarction.
..
ECHO:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated.  Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect.  The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is mild global right
ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. There is a moderate-sized vegetation on
the aortic valve (right coronary cusp). There is no valvular
aortic stenosis. The increased  transaortic gradient is likely
related to aortic regurgitation. Severe (4+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Moderate to
severe (3+)  mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2163-10-27**], no
major change.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment/plan:
51F with ESRD on HD, valvular heart disease(4+AR, 3+MR), DVT on
coumadin, with mental status changes.
.
MICU course: Patient initially admitted to [**Hospital Ward Name **] with
volume overload but transferred patient with hypotension and
hypoxia to the MICU.  Was treated with IVF as necessary as well
as empiric abx (vancomycin and ceftazadime) for seven days.
Improved without knowing source of infection but also without
pressor need.
.
On floor,
# Mental status- waxed and waned throughout stay, thought to be
better with lightening of narcotics and continued dialysis.
Multiple Ct Heads negative.She did have two episodes of
aspiration PNA associated with starting pos during which her
mental status declined.  Her mental status improved, however
with tx. with vanc/ceftazadime/flagyl.  Upon discharge, she
still has some transient episodes of confusion +/- myoclonus,
which husband reports she has had longstanding prior to
admission, likely [**3-2**] narcotics, but risks and side effects
explained to pt. and will tolerate given pain needs.

# line infection: [**2-4**] blood cx. now growing staph coag negative,
?contamination, but given h/o endocarditis, indwelling line,
must assume it is real and treated for bacteremia through line X
10d.  last day vanc was [**4-6**].  She was afebrile and follow up
cultures negative at time of discharge.
