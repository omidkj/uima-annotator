Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4963**]
Chief Complaint:
MI/LGIB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
This is an 80 year old male with a past medical history of
colitis and diverticulosis with history of bleeds, who was
recently admitted at [**Location (un) 620**] with a diverticular bleed
(discharged day before admission here), represented to the OSH
today with sudden onset dyspnea and acute on chronic epigastric
discomfort and was found to have ST changes consistent with
acute MI (not stemi criteria). Hct was 33 on discharge now back
to 27. EKG with old RBBB, but clear new lateral ST depressions
and ST elevation in III. First set of cardiac enzymes were CK
333 MB 11.8 TnT 1.13. Patient presented hypotensive to low 80s,
but now 95-100 with fluid; HR 90s. Is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management. A unit of packed red cells was hung on
transfer.
.
In the ED, the patient remained with stable blood pressures,
dropping only as low as 102 systolic. His initial vitals were
98.7 102/70 20 96%4L. The blood that was hung on transfer
continued to run throughout his ED course and he received an
additional 1L NS. An EKG was rechecked which confirmed the
initial findings, and another troponin was 1.12. He was guaiac
negative, but given his recent history of LGIB and relative
hypotension, he was unable to be anticoagulated or beta blocked.

.
The case was discussed with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 919**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 911**] from Cardiology, who
said to medically manage with ASA (which he received x 1 in the
ED) and blood, and admit to the floor and allow the MI to run
it's course as long as he remains asymptomatic. Given his recent
LGIB and initial hypotension, however, he is admitted to the
MICU for further management and monitoring.
.
On ROS, the patient says that he feels much better and denies
chest pain or shortness of breath. He denies dizziness,
abdominal pain or palpitations.

Brief Hospital Course:
# NSTEMI: Patient had atypical chest discomfort (acute on
chronic epigastric pain, has history of Barrett's) with EKG
changes and positive biomarkers, likely in the setting of recent
LGIB. He was managed medically because of the recent bleeding
with aspirin, low dose beta blocker, low dose ace inhibitor and
simvastatin. Echo demonstrated EF of 25-30% with severe global
LV hypokinesis. His BP remained SBP 90-110. He developed volume
overload from blood transfusions and volume resuscitation for
his hypotension at admission and was gently diuresed.

# LGIB: Presented to outside hospital with bright red blood per
rectum. Hematocrit was 37.4 to OSH initially, underwent an EGD
and a colonoscopy. Colonoscopy revealed diverticulosis and
incidental tiny polyp, otherwise, it was normal with no evidence
of active colitis or bleeding. He then underwent an EGD which
revealed Barrett's esophagus, but no evidence of upper
gastrointestinal bleeding. His hematocrit drifted down to a
nadir of 28 during his stay at the OSH and was stable at 33
prior to discharge. He did not require blood tranfusions there.
Upon this presentation, with a HCT of 27 and active cardiac
ischemia he was transfused 2 units of blood and subsequetly
maintained stable blood counts. He was repeatedly guaiac
negative.

# HTN - Systolic blood pressure after the MI ranged 90-110s. He
was treated with low dose beta blocker and low dose
ace-inhibitor (started [**2190-5-30**]) and intermittent lasix. His
outpatient medications were stopped.

# Fluid overload/ Hyponatremia - Pulmonary edema present on
admission improved with gentle diuresis (Lasix 10mg IV bolus
prn). Appeared vol overloaded on exam based on peripheral edema,
elevated JVP, and cephalization/ small pleural effusions from
CXR on [**5-27**]. Received 10mg IV lasix but diuresis persistently
difficult to quantify given urine spills and incontinence. Urine
electrolytes showed he is salt avid (FeNa = 0.1%); likely
hypervolemic hyponatremia from CHF and possibly SIADH from
stress of hospitalization. Fluid restriction to 1.5L/day.
Appeared euvolemic despite persistent LE edema on day of
discharge. Weight upon discharge 77 KG.
.
# Upper respiratory infection: Cough accompanied by [**Last Name (un) 1993**]
production and upper respiratory congestion. Pt remained afebile
without an oxygen requirement throughout stay. Given
Azithromycin Day 1 ([**2190-5-29**] day 1. To complete 5 days)
guaifensein, encoraged spirometry, OOB.

# Depression - continued celexa
