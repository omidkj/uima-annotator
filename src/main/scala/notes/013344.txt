Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the medicine service initially.  After
workup revealed significant cervical kyphotic deformity and
cervical myelopathy, he was set up for a stage decompression and
deformity correction.

He underwent the 1st of these procedures, anterior cervical
corpectomy (C4, 5) with cage and plate fixation.  He was
transferred to the ICU, extubated without difficulty, then
transferred to the floor in stable condition.  Initial
significant post-operative dysphagia improved and patient
transitioned to a soft mechanical diet.  Pain was controlled
with IV and PO meds.

Patient then underwent second-stage procedure, including C2-T1
fusion and kyphotic correction.  Given length of the procedure,
he remained intubated and was transferred to the ICU.  He was
extubated uneventfully then transferred to the floor.

Post-op, pain was well controlled with IV followed by oral meds.
 Diet progressed without difficulty.  Pt mobilized well with PT
and was independent with ADLs.  [**Location (un) 36323**] was maintained at all
times except for bedtime and showers, at which time he used a
[**Location (un) 2848**]-J.  Pt received a transfusion for symptomatic
post-operative anemia.

With pain adequately controlled, and having passed PT, the
patient was deemed appropriate for discharge with home services.
