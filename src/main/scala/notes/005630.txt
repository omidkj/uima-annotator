Brief Hospital Course:
73 yo female w/ PMH Type I DM, chronic kidney disease, presented
with weight gain, SOB,  found to have bilateral pleural
effusions, and acute renal failure.
.
#Acute Renal Failure
Pt had a baseline creat of 1.3 prior to admission. At time of
admission patient was noted to be in acute renal failure with
creatinine of 3.4. Urine studies revealed a FeNa 4% and FeUrea
22% consistent w/ prerenal cause of renal failure. On thiazides,
FeNa is likely inaccurate. Urine sediment was bland and there
was an absence of urine eosinophils.  Renal ultrasound
demonstrated mild caliectasis of Right kidney. Ultrasound
findings were not definitive for obstructive cause. Pelvic u/s
and abdominal u/s were unrevealing. Patient was followed by
renal team who felt etiology of renal failure was unclear.
[**Name2 (NI) **] showed rapid improvement with diuresis, however did not
return to baseline. Pt may have established new baseline at 2.0.
At time of discharge patient was at regular weight. Patient was
sent home without thiazide or loop diuretic.
.
# Bilateral pleural effusions
In the setting of depressed systolic funtion and acute renal
failure, pleural effusions were likely secondary to volume
overload and transudative fluid shifts. Patient initially
required oxygen via nasal cannula, but with diuresis, we were
able to wean her from her oxygen requirement. Patient was
diuresed with lasix.
.
# Right foot erythema
Patient was noted to have erythema and ecchymoses at base of
third toe. Ecchymoses resolved but redness persisted. There was
concern for fracture but foot films were negative. ERythema did
not worsen and patient was sent home without antibiotics.
DIrected to follow up with [**Hospital6 **] within 1 week,
earlier of redness worsened.
.
#CAD- Patient had signs of lateral ischemia on ECG. However had
3 sets of negative cardiac enzymes. ECG changes likely to be due
to demand ischemia in setting of heart failure. We were unable
to do cardiac catheterization while in acute renal failure.
Patient will likely require stress test as outpatient. Pt was
continued on betablocker and statin.

.
#DMT1- Patient was managed on home regimen of lantus 9 units in
AM and was covered with novolog sliding scale.
