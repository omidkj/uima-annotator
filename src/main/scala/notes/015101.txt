URINE CULTURE (Preliminary):
      ENTEROCOCCUS SP..    >100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..
.
[**2181-5-13**] CXR No evidence of pneumonia.
.
Renal U/S pending at time of [**Month/Day/Year **]
.
[**5-15**] PICC tip located in the upper SVC. No pneumothorax. Could
consider advancing by 2 cm.
.
[**5-16**] The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due
to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The
right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate
global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is moderately
dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis
(AoVA = 1.2 cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets and supporting structures are mildly thickened.
There is trivial mitral regurgitation. The severity of mitral
regurgitation may be UNDERestimated due to acoustic shadowing
related to mitral annular calcification. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2180-10-17**], the
right ventricular cavity is now dilated with prominent free wall
hypokinesis. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is now
identified. Left ventricular systolic function and the estimated
AoV area are similar. Trace aortic regurgitation was also seen
on review of the prior study.
This constellation of findings is suggestive of a primary
pulmonary process or primary right ventricular ischemia. The TR
gradient of 25-28mmHg in [**12-28**] suggests a primary right
ventricular ischemia as more likely.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2178**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.
.
[**5-16**] LENIs 1. Occlusive thrombus in the left mid superficial
femoral vein extending into the popliteal and peroneal vessels.
The tibial vessels were not identified onthe left side. 2.
Normal flow, compressibility, and waveforms seen in the right
lower extremity venous structures.
.
[**5-22**] swallow study
A swallowing videofluoroscopy study was done in conjunction with

speech pathology service. Multiple consistencies of oral barium
were
ingested. Barium passed freely beyond the oropharynx into the
esophagus
without evidence of obstruction. Thin liquids resulted in
aspiration for
which a cued cough was only partially effective in clearance.
.
[**2181-5-22**] CT abd/pelvis
1. Hematoma in the adductor muscles of the right thigh. No
evidence for
retroperitoneal hematoma.
2. Multiple renal cysts bilaterally as well as hypodense lesions
in both
kidneys as described above. One lesion in the upper pole of the
left kidney is increased in size. Further evaluation could be
performed with ultrasound, MRI or CT followup.
.
[**2181-5-24**] CXR: Likely aspiration pneumonitis in the right lower
lobe.
