Chief Complaint:
Back/Flank pain s/p renal biopsy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 92093**] is a 28 y/o female with hx of SLE, asthma, and
hypertension, who is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH due to large
retroperitoneal hematoma and anemia refractory to blood
transfusions.  She underwent a right renal biopsy on [**3-13**], to
evaluate etiology of rising creatinine and proteinuria.  The
following day, she was was evaluated for flank pain, and was
found on imaging to have a 6x1 cm perinephric hematoma.  She
continued to have flank pain on [**3-18**], and underwent arteriography
and thrombin injection by OSH IR, with successful thrombosis of
R renal pseudoaneursym.  She was subsequently discharged home.
.
She re-presented to OSH on [**3-20**], due to worsening R flank pain.
U/s showed thrombosed pseudoaneursym.  CT scan revealed large
subcapsularhematoma (16 x 8 x 4cm), extending into
retroperitoneum and pelvis.  Her admission hgb was 7.4, which
dropped to 6.3 over four hours.  She was transfused 2u RBC and
2u FFP, along with one unit of platelets, with improvement in
hgb to 7.2.  She became mildly hypotensive to 90 systolic, and
tachycardic to 148, with worsening flank and leg pain.  She
received two additional units of RBCs, with her hgb level
unchanged at 7.2.  Four hrs later, hgb was 6.7.  Her labs have
also been notable for rising leukocytosis (18 -> 21) and
creatinine (1.66 -> 1.87), and thrombocytopenia (95 -> 72).
Decision was made to transfer to tertiary care center for IR or
surgical intervention to control bleeding.  VS prior to transfer
were 101.2, 122, 127/66, 92% room air.  Urine output has been
~30 cc/hr.  On transfer, pt was given two additional units (#5
and 6) of RBCs.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient is awake and interactive,
but tearful and in significant distress from pain.  She feels
like she has "a [**Doctor Last Name **] inside of" her abdomen, and the pain
radiates down her anterior and posterior thigh.  She is asking
to be put under general anesthesia if she needs to undergo
another IR procedure.  She denies chest pain, dyspnea, nausea,
vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, dysuria, or rash.  She is
thirsty and is asking for water.
.
On transfer to medicine floor, pt is alert and oriented. Her
vitals are stable and she has not been febrile. Pain is still
limiting her ability to ambulate. Her crits have been stable,
last crit was 25.8. She is eating and drinking adequately.

Discharge Labs:

Abd Ultrasound w Duplex ([**2138-3-22**]):
1. Normal liver Doppler examination.
2. Splenomegaly with splenic calcifications, granulomatous
disease.
3. No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilation.
4. Perinephric hematoma, better seen on recent CT.
.
CXR ([**2138-3-22**]):
New left IJ catheter tip is at the cavoatrial junction. There is
no
pneumothorax. Right IJ catheter tip is in the IVC. There are low
lung
volumes. There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly. There is mild
vascular
congestion. Small bilateral pleural effusions are larger on the
right side. Bibasilar atelectases are larger on the right side.
.
CT Abd/Pelvis ([**2138-3-23**]):
1. Interval enlargement of the perinephric and retroperitoneal
hematoma when compared to the [**2138-3-20**] examination.
Correlation with serial
hematocrits recommended. No evidence of liquified component or
superimposed infection.
2. Approximately 1-cm area of enhancement within heterogeneous
region in the lower pole of right kidney likely relates to
residual pseudoaneurysm.
3. Marked anasarca.
.
MRI/MRA Neck/Head ([**2138-3-24**]):
1. No acute infarct or hemorrhage.
2. No evidence of focal flow-limiting stenosis, occlusion,
dissection or
aneurysm larger than 3 mm in the major arteries of head and
neck. The MRA neck study is suboptimal due to poor timing of the
bolus and significant venous contamintaion.
