Nausea and headache with walking trouble.

None


History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 88-year-old right handed female with a past
medical history significant for atrial fibrillation on Coumadin,
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes type 2, pulmonary
hypertension, was recently seen at [**Hospital1 18**] with an episode of
vertigo on Wednesday, [**2170-10-17**], who now returns six days later
with persistent nausea, left-sided occipital headache and
difficulty with walking.  The patient had her first episode last
Wednesday on [**2170-10-17**].  She describes the episodes as follows:

She woke up after breakfast and went to go brush her teeth.
While standing in the bathroom, she had the sudden onset of
vertigo and the clock was spinning in the clockwise direction.
This sensation lasted for about 3 minutes, but she could not
stand during it and had to sit on the edge of the toilet seat
and
felt that she would fall off if she did not hold on to the seat.
The episodes started to slow down and then ceased at
approximately 3 minutes.  Following this, she then noted a
headache in the left occipital/parietal area and she felt very
nauseous.  At this point, she was able to stand without falling
and noted no dysarthria, dysphagia, diplopia, or any other
concerning brain stem findings or visual symptoms and because of
her history of a-fib, she called her son who advised her to call
EMS and then she came into [**Hospital1 18**], where she was seen by
neurology.

After being seen by neurology, she was complaining of mild
headache and mild nausea; however, her symptoms of vertigo had
resolved.  On exam at the time, she did have a relatively normal
exam that was notable only for left cervical and trapezius
tenderness and evidence of cervical spondylosis with weakness in
the C5, C6, and C7 distribution bilaterally with some evidence
of myelopathy.  A CTA and CT was performed.  It did not show any
evidence of stroke or vessel blockage.  It was felt that this is
possibly a peripheral process and the patient was discharged
home with followup.

Over the past five days, the patient has not had significant
improvement in her two primary symptoms, which are nausea and
her headache.  She has not had any further episodes of vertigo;
however, she remains extremely nauseous and is unable to keep
most food or liquids down.  She stated that she has not eaten
much in the past three to four days because of this.  She notes
the nausea is significantly worse when she stands up and it is
somewhat improved when she lies flat with her eyes closed.  She
still complains of her headache, which again she describes as
partially a pressure like sensation, non-throbbing, and
non-positional.  She localizes it primarily to the posterior
side of her head on the left side.  The patient had continuous
nausea for the last couple of days.  Today and yesterday, she
felt that the nausea increased.  She had one episode of emesis,
which was this morning.  In addition, she did not get out of bed
all day. She gave two reasons for not getting out of bed, one
when she
rose up, she would become extremely nauseous and want to lie
flat again.  The second reason was that she felt very unsteady
if she tended to stand up, she felt that if she leaned in one
direction or the other, she would be pulled down to the floor.
She was able to walk yesterday with a walker, which is unusual
for her, as she has never needed a walker prior to this.

The patient describes the headache as a numb, throbbing,
aching/pressure.  She does not believe there is a positional
component.  The patient does have a history of migraine
headaches, which she had from puberty to menopause.  She
described the headaches as predominantly a throbbing unilateral
headache.  She would get some nausea and vomiting with the
headache.  There was photophobia and phonophobia.  She described
this headache as different from her prior migraines, as she did
not have photophobia or phonophobia.  Based on her continuing
symptoms, she called her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] then spoke with one of our
outpatient neurologists, who recommended that she come into the
emergency room and be evaluated again by neurology.

The patient notes that she feels somewhat improved after getting
a dose of Zofran, although this medication has made her somewhat
sleepy.

On neuro ROS, the pt reports the mild pressure headache in the
left occiput as above, no loss of vision, blurred vision,
diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, tinnitus or new hearing
difficulty. Denies difficulties producing or comprehending
speech.  Denies focal weakness, numbness, paraesthesia. Has long
