Brief Hospital Course:
THIS INTERIM SUMMARY COVERS HOSPITAL COURSE THROUGH [**2104-8-1**].
PLEASE SEE ADDENDUM FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE HOSPITAL COURSE.

The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2104-7-21**] for medical
evaluation for CABG and management prior to surgery. She
underwent carotid angiogram on [**2104-7-23**] as part of her
pre-op work up which showed bilateral extensive stenosis, but no
intervention for carotid disease was done. She did well
initially after the procedure. Then later that night, became
tachy with a fib RVR 130's. EKG done and showed a fib, rt 130, [**Street Address(2) 58212**] elevations in aVR, III, aVF, and TWI in V [**2-16**], I, aVL, II.
Then developed polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, became
unresponsive for a few seconds, code called, pt emergently
intubated, started on amio load/drip, converted to a fib, then
NSR. Initially normotensive, SBP 110's, then became hypotensive
80s/40s. Started on 5mcg/hr Dopamine drip and taken emergently
to cath lab where she had LM stented and PTCA to mid-LAD lesion
and then CCU on IABP.

1. CAD - s/p STEMI c/b VT on [**2104-7-23**] s/p emergent cath s/p
successful stenting of the LMCA stenosis with Cypher stent and
successful PTCA of the mid LAD. No enzyme leak, peak CK 113.
Intraaortic balloon pump was placed and then discontinued after
1 day. The patient was treated post-MI with aspirin, Plavix,
lipitor, beta-blocker and ACe inhibitor. She was permissively
mildly hypertensive initially because of her carotid stenoses
and concern for a new stroke. Her beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor
were gradually titrated up to achieve goal SBP of about 130's.
Her groin checks revealed no complications and were healing
well. She will need repeat catheterization in 6 months for
totally occluded RCA and distal LAD disease. She is not a CABG
candidate b/o carotid stenoses and now s/p LM, LAD intervention.


2. Rhythm - VT and afib were felt to be secondary to
ischemia/peri-ischemia. The patient has no prior history of a
fib. She has been monitored on telemetry and has been in NSR
since [**2104-7-25**]. She had an episode of atrial tachycardia on
[**8-3**] and her beta-blocker dose was increased.

3. PUMP - EF 45% mild hypokinesis. No indications for
anticoagulation. The patient has been treated with gentle
diuresis to keep her euvolemic with goal .5-1L negative every
day. Her total LOS fluid balance for CCU was about 2L positive.

4. Respiratory - The patient failed extubation on [**2104-7-27**] due to
tracheal edema.  Interventional pulmonary consulted and she
received IV steroids. Patient's airway swelling improved (+air
leak) and she was extubated successfully on [**2104-7-29**]. Steroids
were discontinued on [**7-29**]. She was conitinued on nebulizers for
cardiac wheezing and required suctioning for copious thick
secretions.

5. HTN - Patient became more hypertensive after IV steroids were
started and has been controlled with IV betablocker &
transiently on labetolol gtt in CCU. Titrated up metoprolol and
ACEI to goal SBP 130's and HR 60, started amlodipine, and HCTZ.
Of note, because of right subclavian artery stenosis, she has
consistently lower BP readings in her right arm.

6. Vascular - Bilateral carotid stenoses 70-79% stenosis, no
intervention warranted. There was a concern of facial assymetry
and decreased left arm movement. During her CCU stay, the
patient was evaluated by neuro
