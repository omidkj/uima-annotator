Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 59 year old male with HIV/HCV cirrhosis/CAD who
presented with GI bleed, was admitted to the unit for
stabalization and subsequently transferred to the floor prior to
discharge.

1. Upper GI Bleed - The patient presented to the ER with 2 days
of melanotic stools.  He was aggressivly fluid resusitated
(through 2 large bore IV's) in the ER and was found to be + for
blood on NG lavage in the ER.  He cleared after approximately
200cc.  His Hct dropped from 39.4 to 30.0. He was brought to the
MICU for an emergent EGD.  The EGD showed a non-bleeding varices
and gastritis.  In the unit he received 1 unit PRBC.  It was
thought that his bleeding was secondary to gastritis from the
combination of ASA and alcohol.  An H.pylori test was negative.
He was placed on pantoprazole 40mg [**Hospital1 **].  His Hct was followed
closely.  He stabalized quickly and was transferred to the floor
after 24 hours.  He was placed on ciprofloxacin for 5 days for
SBP prophylaxis. During the rest of his hospital stay, the
patient hct remained stable.  His hct on discharge was 32.3.

2.  HIV/HCV -  The patient was continued on his HAART regimen.
There was evidence of esophagitis on EGD.  The patient had no
evidence of bleeding varices on EGD.

3. CAD - The patient diltizaem was held due to active GI
bleeding and hypotension.  He was restarted on his home dose
prior to discharge.  It was also noted that the patient had an
aymptomatic ectopic atrial rhythm on EKG.  I schedule the
patient an appointment with his cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on
[**8-14**].

4. Asthama - The patient was continued on his albuteral and
fluticasone inhalers
