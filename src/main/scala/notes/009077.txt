Brief Hospital Course:
## Upper GI bleed: Mr. [**Known lastname 89105**] was admitted to the MICU for
management of hematemesis and suspected upper GI bleed. GI was
consulted, and initial EGD on [**2128-10-31**] showed gross blood but no
clear source of bleeding. He was placed on a Protonix gtt and
received total of 4U RBC transfusions while in the MICU, as well
as FFP. His Hct remained stable once his hematemesis ceased.
Repeat EGD on [**2128-11-2**] visualized a gatric ulcer, which was
thought to be the source of the bleed. He was eventually
transitioned to po Protonix [**Hospital1 **], which he should continue. His
Coumadin should be held until [**2128-11-9**] (one week post-EGD). H.
pylori Ag was negative. The patient or a representative needs to
call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11048**] to schedule a follow-up EGD within 6-8 weeks.
He was able to tolerate a regular diet at the time of discharge.
.
## CAD: ASA was decreased from 325mg to 81mg daily to reduce
bleeding risk. His Metoprolol and statin were both resumed at
original doses.
.
## Chronic systolic CHF w/ EF 30% s/p AICD: His Lasix was held
given the GI bleed. He had no signs of volume overload, so this
can be restarted as an outpt if his po intake remains adequate.
Discharge weight is 142.8 lbs.
.
## Atrial fibrillation: His Digoxin was continued. As noted
above, Coumadin should be held until [**2128-11-9**] per GI recs.
.
## R heel osteomyelitis: His suppressive Minocycline was
continued.
.
## Stage 3 CKD: Cr remained at his baseline 1.6-1.8. Discharge
Cr was 1.4.
.
## Depression: Home Celexa and Mirtazipine were continued.
Social Work followed him throughout his admission and noted that
he continues to be actively depressed, but not suicidal. He
apparently has a great deal of survivor guilt extending all the
way back to his military days as a young adult. He should
continue to have Social Work see him as an outpt.
.
## Hypothyroidism: Synthroid was continued.
.
## Code status: FULL CODE.
