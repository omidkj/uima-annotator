Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Bactrim DS / Nafcillin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2782**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None this hospitalization


History of Present Illness:
56M with CKD s/p renal transplant, renal artery stenosis s/p
stent last year, DM1, recent admission for MSSA osteomyelitis
and subsequent admission for rash and acute renal failure
presumably from Nafcillin and is now presenting with shortness
of breath and fever.
.
The patient reports he has intermittently felt fatigued and
dyspneic for the past few weeks since his discharge from [**Hospital1 18**]
on [**10-23**] and has seen various providers in outpatient clinic.  He
has experienced shortness of breath, worst when laying down flat
but also on exertion, dry cough, and fatigue which has been
worse for the past week.  His home spO2 was in the high 80's and
he reports his systolic blood pressures were in the 130's, which
is slightly lower than usual.  He also reports progressive pedal
edema.  He was febrile at home with low grade fevers in the
100's.  Additionally, he had one episode of nausea and vomiting
yesterday but denies any further episodes since, and denies
abdominal pain or diarrhea and denies dysuria.  He denies sick
contacts or recent travel.  He notes his dry weight is 176 lb
and was 184 lb at home, which is close to his usual baseline
weight.
.
He had been told to discontinue his Lisinopril, which he has.
He also had his Prednisone dose increased [**12-13**] from 5 mg daily
to 20 mg daily for a possible COPD exacerbation and did notice
improvement of his wheezing.  He was seen again on [**12-14**] for
recurrence of dyspnea and was then told to increase his Lasix
dose to 80 mg [**Hospital1 **] but instead increased it from 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] to 60
mg [**Hospital1 **] due to concerns of over-stressing his kidneys.  He
reports his dyspnea has continued to worsen, and called his PCP
today and was advised to go to the ED.
.
Of note, the patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 26205**] for a
diabetic foot ulcer and suspicion for osteomyelitis, and was
treated with Nafcillin, Cipro, Flagyl.  He was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**]
again on [**11-27**] for a rash believed to be a drug reaction to
Nafcillin and acute renal failure secondary to hypovolemia from
diarrhea secondary to antibiotics.
.
In the ED, initial VS were:  98.8 89 158/60 24 88%
The patient was initially 88% on RA and was placed on a
non-rebreather with PO2 94%.  He has been on bipap in the past.
He was found to be febrile to 101, and received Vancomycin 1 gm
and Cefepime.  He was given Albuterol, Ipratropium nebulizers,
Methylprednisolone, and Acetaminophen.  CXR was obtained.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient had dyspnea on exertion but
was able to be rapidly weaned to a nasal cannula and face mask
with high flow oxygen.  He denied other symptoms at this time.
