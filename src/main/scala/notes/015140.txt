Chest pain, headache, slurred speech and weak

None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 40366**] is a 52-year-old right-handed man presenting with the
above on a background of hypertension and a family history of
stroke.

Three days ago Mr. [**Known lastname 40366**] was having his hair braided by his
daughter. [**Name (NI) **] had also been smoking marijuana immediately before,
"one blunt", that he thinks was not laced. Suddenly he noticed
that the room was spinning and his voice was slurred. He
attributed this to marijuana. He started cooking then went down
stairs, he had trouble immediately on the stairs, saying that
his
right leg kept "coming out from under him". He felt vertiginous
and needed to hold the wall to navigate the stairs. He also felt
drowsy. Thinking that this might be marijuana, he decided to
wait
the symptoms out. He slept normally, but felt drowsy when awake.
Today he developed left sided chest pain, severe, radiating to
the left arm, as if someone was "pushing on his chest", along
with mild headache. He decided to come to the ED.

Review of systems negative except as above. Specifically, no
chest pain at onset of symptoms. No recent symptoms of
infection.
No other drug use. Has been taking all of his medications
without
missing doses, despite marijuana. Chest pain and headache have
resolved with treatment of hypertension (now 200s, 220s on
arrival).

CXR [**2124-5-27**]:
IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly, unfolded thoracic aorta, unchanged. No
signs of
pneumonia or CHF

NCHCT [**2124-5-27**]:

FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass
effect or
large acute tentorial infarction. Re-demonstrated are multifocal
centrum
semiovale and periventricular hypodensities likely consistent
with sequela of
chronic extensive small vessel disease. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white
matter
differentiation is preserved. Ventricles and sulci are normal in
size and
configuration. The paranasal sinuses and mastoids are well
aerated. No
fracture.

IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Chronic sequela of extensive small vessel disease, unchanged
from prior
exam from [**2122-11-8**]

CTA Chest [**2124-5-27**]:
CTA CHEST: There is no pneumomediastinum, mediastinal
hemorrhage,
pericardial, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Moderate
atherosclerotic
calcification of the left main coronary artery. Mild
cardiomegaly without
edema. The thoracic aorta is normal without evidence of
dissection.
There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism.

There is no focal consolidation. Small calcified granuloma in
the LLL, no
suspicious pulmonary nodules. Small hiatal hernia. Partially
visualized upper
abdomen demonstrates no acute pathology.

BONES:There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. No acute cardiothoracic process including no evidence of
aortic dissection.
2. Mild cardiomegaly without edema.
