History of Present Illness:
59 year-old male with a history of cardiomyopathy EF 45-50% with
PCM/ICD who presented due to SOB. He awoke in respiratory
distress and called EMS. He was found to have a SBP in 200s, RR
30-40s, rales in bilateral lung fields. He
was given nitropaste and started on CPAP with presumed flash
pulmonary edema. His symptoms improved enroute to the ER. He had
taken his home lasix of 80mg and urinated before EMS arrived. At
baseline he gets short of breath with a flight of stairs.  In
the ED he was given lasix 80mg IV x 1 and started on a nitro
gtt. He was continued on CPAP with fiO2 of 50%. He was
diaphoretic on
arrival. He was given vanco and levo for possible PNA. He was
admitted for futher evaluation.

[**2106-3-18**] Intraop TEE
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %). Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %). The
estimated cardiac index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Post_Bypass:
Patient is on epinephrine infusion. Cardiac output 3.4L/min by
swan ganz method.
There is moderate improvement of LVEF global systolic function.
LVEF 35%
Intact thoracic aorta.
Aortic valve area calculations by continuity is 1.2 cm2 with
peak aortic velocity at 2.1m/sec.
Surgeon informed of the findings.
Other valves similar to prebypass.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 59-year-old male with history of cardiomyopathy who
had an ejection fraction of 45-50% and had a biventricular
pacemaker placed about a year or 2 ago. He
presented in respiratory distress and responded to diuresis.  He
had an echocardiogram which demonstrated that his left
ventricular function was depressed with moderate to severe
regional systolic dysfunction and ejection fraction about 25%.
His aortic valve showed minimal aortic stenosis.  There was also
a mass that was in the left ventricle and it appeared to be
attached to the papillary
muscle suggestive of a fibroblastoma or torn chord.  He had a
dobutamine stress echo which showed that the majority of his
heart had viable myocardium except for the inferior wall.  He
had a small mitral palpable muscle mass which was suggestive
of a torn chord.  Cardiac surgery was asked to evaulate for
surgery.  He was brought to the operating room on [**2106-3-18**] where
the patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x3 with a
left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending
artery and reverse saphenous vein graft to the posterior
descending artery and the diagonal artery.  See operative note
for full details. Overall the patient tolerated the procedure
well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. POD 1 found the
patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.
 The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically
stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was
initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward the
preoperative weight. A fib was noted to be his rhythm under his
pacemaker and he was loaded with Amiodarone.    The patient was
transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery. He did
have some dizziness and orthostatic hypotension which improved
with albumin.  He had scant sternal drainage which had improved
at the time of discharge with no drainage noted for 48 hours.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy
service for assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time
of discharge on POD 7 the patient was ambulating freely,
tolerating a full oral diet and the wound was healing and pain
was controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged
home with VNA in good condition with appropriate follow up
instructions.
