Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath, fevers to 103, increased cough with sputum,
diffuse sharp chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 67 year old female with a history of
long-standing mycobacterium avium intracellulare and
bronchiectasis who recently had a pneumonia in late [**Month (only) 216**] and
more recently a bronchoscopy on [**2100-10-20**] as preparation for a
planned right pneumonectomy, who presented to the ED early this
morning with sharp pains in her chest, shortness of breath and
fevers up to 103 over the last several weeks at home. The
patient was diagnosed with [**Doctor First Name **] over 20 years ago and was
initially treated with antibiotics including clarithromycin,
ethambutol and rifampin but eventually became resistant to
clarithromycin. In [**2094**], she underwent a right middle lobectomy
with right upper lobe pleural tent. For the last 6 months she
has been taking ehtambutol, rifampin, streptomycin and in [**Month (only) 216**]
she took Levaquin for 10 days for a pneumonia. She stopped the
streptomycin because she was tired of going to the hospital for
infusions and medicare would not pay for infusions at home.
Prior to that, she went off all medications for about 18 months
and per the patient felt "alright." The patient's family reports
that her disease has taken a significant turn for the worse
about a year and a half ago. She has had difficulty maintaining
weight, going as low as 88 pounds from her baseline of 110.
Right now she is around 100lbs. She reports that over the last
few weeks she has been spiking fevers up to 103 at home, has
been having a cough without blood that is productive of yellow
green sputum. She had the bronchoscopy on [**2100-10-20**] and a note from
a telephone call with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2100-10-27**] advised the
patient to come to the ED if she felt worse and to start
amoxicillin-clavulanate 500/125/qid. She took two doses and by
2am on [**2100-10-28**] felt sharp pains all over her chest that lasted
for about one hour and then came to the ED wehre the pain
subsequently resolved.
.
In the ED the patient's vitals were notable for a temperature of
99, a HR of 120, a BP of 82/53, a RR of 36 and an oxygen
saturation of 84 percent of room air. She was given 2L of NS,
vancomycin and zosyn. Labs were sent. WBC was 10.6, Hct 35.7,
electrolytes were within normal limits, urine was clear,
moderate blood, trace protein, [**4-15**] RBC, 305 WBC, few bacteria
and 0-2 epis. Her chem showed a bicarb of 26 and a creatinine of
0.8. LFTs were WNL.  Chest CT compared to a prior showed many
new opacities, particularly in the left lung, most suggestive of
bronchopneumonia with a strong component of airway inflammation,
probably due to infection with suggestion of superinfection. CT
also showed chronic-appearing fibro-cavitary disease bilaterally
in keeping with known diagnosis of mycobacterium avium complex.
Chest x ray in the ED showed a large right apical cavity with
thickening of irregular border, unchanged from her x ray on
[**2100-10-25**].
.
On the floor the patient reports that she no longer feels chest
pain, is still coughing up sputum but no blood, she denies
nausea, reports that she sometimes vomits when she coughs a lot,
denies lightheadedness, dizziness, palpitations, dysuria, or
diarrhea. She is anxious to leave the hospital.


Past Medical History:
.
Past Surgical and Medical History
Her past medical history is notable for Mycobacterium Avium
Intracellulare and bronchiectasis
.
Her past surgical history includes right middle lobectomy with
right upper lobe pleural tent and 3 cesarian sections.


Social History:

socially in her younger years.  She does report significant
second hand smoke exposure from her parents.  She haspreviously
been employed at the airport and reports expsoure to
jet fumes.  She denies significant exposure to asbestos or
silica.  She has not traveled recently. She lives with her
husband and children and currently doese not work. She is the
leader of a support group for [**Doctor First Name **].

Physical Exam:
Physical exam on admission
VS: T98.1 BP 100/52 HR 81 RR 18 O2 90% on 2L NC
General: NAD, sitting in bed talking comfortable on oxygen
HEENT: PERRL, oropharynx clear, MM slightly dry, no LAD, JVP not
visible
CV: RRR, no MRG S1 S2
Pulmonarly: wheezes and rhonchi bilaterally
Abdomen: soft, non tender, active bowel sounds, no rebound, no
guarding,

Pertinent Results:
CT chest [**2100-10-28**]
IMPRESSION:

1. No PE.
2. Compared to the reference CT, there are many new opacities,
particularly in the left lung, most suggestive of
bronchopneumonia with a strong component of airway inflammation,
probably due to infection. Superinfection is suggested and
correlation with clinical symptoms is suggested.
3. Chronic-appearing fibro-cavitary disease bilaterally in
keeping with known diagnosis of mycobacterium avium complex.

CXR [**2100-10-28**]
There is a large right apical cavity with thickening of
irregular
border, unchanged. The lungs show markedly decrease
transparency, with partially nodular, partially small cavitary
and partially interstitial pattern of opacities. The right
costophrenic sinus remains obliterated. The left costophrenic
angle is free. Heart size is noral. Left-sided Port-A-Cath in
situ.

CXR [**2100-10-25**]
The most remarkable abnormality is a large right apical cavity
with
a thickened and irregular border. Additional cavity contents
cannot be excluded. The non-cavitary remaining right and the
entire left lung show markedly decreased transparency, with
partly nodular, partly small cavitary and partly interstitial
patterns of opacities. The right costophrenic sinus is
obliterated, likely caused by a small pleural scar, several
surgical clips project over the right costophrenic sinus. On the
left, the costophrenic sinus is unremarkable. Overall, mild
overinflation is present. The size of
the cardiac silhouette is unremarkable. Right-sided Port-A-Cath
in situ.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 70938**] is a 68 yo female with long-standing history of
[**Doctor First Name **] who was admitted with pneumonia which was complicated by
acute respiratory failure and sepsis.

The patient has a known 20 year history of [**Doctor First Name **] and has had
significant decline over the last year and half prior to
admission as well as a recent pneumonia and had a scheduled
bronchoscopy as an outpatient on [**2100-10-20**] as part of preparation
for a planned right pneumonectomy to treat her [**Doctor First Name **]. In the
emergency room Chest CT compared to a prior showed many new
opacities, particularly in the left lung, most suggestive of
