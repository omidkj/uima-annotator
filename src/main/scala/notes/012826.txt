Chief Complaint:
Chief Complaint: Altered mental status, hypotension


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Midline insertion (removed prior to discharge)


History of Present Illness:
65 M with a complicated PMH including CVA (non-verbal &
quadriplegic at baseline) now s/p trach & PEG [**3-/2200**], atrial
fibrillation on coumadin, chronic aspiration PNAs and recurrent
UTIs with drug-resistant organisms, C Diff s/p colectomy, DM2,
recent ICU admission for urosepsis who presents from his nursing
home.

Of note, the patient was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2202-9-23**] to
complete a course of IV antibiotics on [**2202-9-27**] for a presumed
HCAP.

Per report, the pt was diagnosed with a PNA on CXR yesterday at
his [**Hospital1 1501**] & received IV antibiotics.  Today, he was noted to have
an alteration in his mental status so he was sent to the [**Hospital1 18**]
ED for further evaluation.

In the ED, initial VS were: 99.2  107  95/56  30

Initial labs in ED revealed peripheral lactate 2, creatinine 2.6
(from 0.3), potassium 7.3.  An initial EKG revealed peaked-T
waves.  The patient was given insulin, 1 amp D50%, as well as 2
gm calcium gluconate.  During the calcium infusion, the patient
was noted to develop some erythema around his IV site.

He was started on vanco, cefepime, & levofloxacin in the ED.
His Foley catheter was replaced and it immediately drained
roughly 2 L, suggesting an obstructive uropathy.

After receiving the above therapies, the patient was admitted to
the ICU for further evaluation and treatment.

Brief Hospital Course:
66 M with complicated past medical history most significant for
multiple CVAs now with trach & PEG, also with h.o CDiff colitis
s/p colectomy, recurrent aspiration PNA as well as UTIs in
setting of chronic Foley presented with fever & altered mental
status found to have HCAP.

#HCAP: Pt initially presented meeting SIRS criteria (fever,
leukocytosis, tachycardia) in the presence of two suspected
sources (UTI, possible PNA based on U/A & CXR). CXR revealed
"Right base consolidative opacity and patchy left base opacity
are compatible with pneumonia or aspiration." He was transferred
from the ER to the MICU and responded to fluid resuscitation.
His mental status improved and he was treated with Linezolid and
Cefepime. When he was more stable he was tranferred to the
medicine floor where we continued antiboitics. ID was consulted
and they recommended total of 8 days of cefapime and to
discontinue the linezolid. As patient improved the plan was to
give him a PICC and to discharge him home on cefapime however
patient refused PICC. His family was contact[**Name (NI) **] and it was
believed that he was competent enough to refuse the PICC. He
stayed in the hospital till he finished his course of
antibiotics. Patient is at risk for recurrent admissions for
pneumonia because of his aspiration risk.
