History of Present Illness:
46yo M with hyperlipidemia, no known CAD, and +FHx who was
transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital with an acute MI.  Developed
[**10-3**] CP at 4pm while playing tennis.  Taken to [**Location (un) **] where
EKG showed STE in anterolateral leads.  Started on ASA, BB,
Plavix, and Integrilin, and Benadryl.  Developed rapid AF just
before cath.  Cath at [**Location (un) **]-occluded mid-LAD, 2 stents placed,
and 40% OM1.  SBP dropped to 80-90 in cath lab, started on
dopamine gtt.  Converted to NSR upon revasc. No further CP
post-cath.  Required 100% NRB, rapid desat on RA.  Cr 1.5,
baseline 0.9-1.1.  En route, developed 20-30 beat run of VT, for
which he was started on a lidocaine gtt.  Upon arrival,
lidocaine gtt stopped, DA gtt at 8 to maintain BP in 90s.
Bedside TTE: EF 35%, severe apical akinesis, no regurg.
Intermittent runs of VT.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) STEMI: Mr. [**Known lastname **] suffered a large anterior STEMI.  He is s/p
cardiac cath at the OSH with 2 stents placed to his STEMI, and
resolution of ST elevation and chest pain upon
revascularization.  He experienced intermittent runs of VT en
route to [**Hospital1 18**] and had evidence of cardiogenic shock upon
arrival.  TTE revealed depressed EF and apical akinesis.  He was
continued on ASA, Integrilin, and Plavix, and started on
high-dose statin.  He was initially diuresed with Lasix for his
pulmonary edema.  He was weaned from dopamine the next day with
the help of IV fluids to replete his volume.  He was started on
heparin gtt for the indication of apical akinesis and low EF.
His cardiac enzymes continued to trend down.  He was chest
pain-free throughout his admission.  He was also started on a
beta blocker and ACE inhibitor during this admission.  TTE on
[**6-20**] showed improved EF of 45% and residual apical akinesis.
Heparin gtt was discontinued.  The patient's follow-up plan
includes cardiology f/u in 2 weeks and cardiac rehabilitation
program in [**3-30**] weeks.  He was also instructed to follow up with
his PCP.
.
2) VT: The patient had frequent, intermittent, non-sustained
runs of VT.  The decision was made to monitor the patient
without treatment as he was hemodynamically stable and VT can be
expected within 48 hours of MI--AIVR vs. NSVT.  His electrolytes
were repleted as necessary.  The VT resolved within 48 hours.
The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout his
admission.
.
3) ARF: On admission, the patient had an elevated creatinine of
1.5, likely secondary to hypoperfusion, with possible
contribution from the dye load received in cardiac
catheterization.  It had returned to [**Location 213**] by the time of
discharge.
.
4) Dispo: The patient was discharged to home with a plan to
follow up with his PCP and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for Cardiology within the
next 2 weeks.
