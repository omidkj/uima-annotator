Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
Ventricular tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization with no interventions


History of Present Illness:
81F with DM2, HTN, history of stroke on plavix, dementia
transferred from [**Hospital1 1516**] for closer monitoring in setting of
possible VTach.  Pt in usual state of health until yesterday.
Some SOB ascending stairs to bed last night, Daughter then heard
gurgling noise and noted pt to be difficult to arouse from
sleep, pt was confused and diaphoretic when awoken - pt stated
she was in "deep sleep".  Of note, clear fluid on shirt and
sheets thought to be from mouth, but reported to not look like
vomit. ? syncope.  EMS called, taken to [**Hospital3 4107**] where
troponin I 0.72, BNP 369, Creatinine 1.6, EKG NSR with sub-mm ST
elevations in III and aVF and reciprocal sub-mm depression in I
and aVL.  CXR with no acute process.  Recieved ASA 324mg and
heparin gtt, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath.  This am,
experienced 30s run of VT, self-limited.  Now with persistant
tachycardia, EP consulted and not sure if VT vs other
tachyarrhythmia - recommend transfer to CCU for further
monitoring.  Remained asymptommatic throughout.
.
She reports she is comfortable and never had any chest
discomfort or shortness of breath. Per son who accompanies her,
patient has baseline lower extremity edema, 2 pillow orthopnea
that is unchanged, and stable DOE w/ stairs. Has remote history
of fainting.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of deep
venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of
surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. S/he
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.

Cardiac Cath [**2128-9-29**]
COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system

demonstrated 3 vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had no
angiographically apparent flow-limiting disease.  The LAD had a
90%
mid-vessel stenosis, and was otherwise diffusely disease.  The
D1 had an
80% stenosis.  The LCx had 80% stenosis at the origin, and OMB2
was
totally occluded and filled by left-to-left collaterals.  The
RCA was
totally occluded proximally and filled via left-to-right
collaterals.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated left- and
right-sided
filling pressures with an LVEDP of 20mmHg and an RVEDP of
16mmHg.  There
was no gradient across the aortic or mitral valve.  There was
mild
pulmonary venous hypertension with a PA pressure of 37/19 and a
normal
PVR.  Cardiac output was preserved at 5.5 L/min with an index of
3.2
L/min/m2.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Preserved cardiac output.
3. Mildly elevated left- and right-sided filling pressures

echo
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
near akinesis of the basal inferior wall and distal halves of
the septum and anterior wall. The apex is mildly aneurysmal and
akinetic. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 30-35
%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate
([**1-11**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is an anterior space
which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with extensive
regional systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD. Mild-moderate
mitral regurgitation.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
81F with history of previous stroke, DM and dementia admitted
with likely NSTEMI now with tachyarrythmia concerning for VT.
.
# NSTEMI/CAD:  no known history, multiple risk factors. q's in
III and aVF concerning for history of MI.  elevated troponin of
0.43, CK WNL.  Pt went for cardiac cath which showed extensive
3VD.  Goals of care discussion occured with pt and family and it
was determined not to pursue CABG.  Pt was continued on ASA,
plavix, metoprolol, lisinopril and atorvastatin.
.
# CHF:  On presentation to CCU, pt was found to have bibasilar
crackles on exam, however, no oxygen requirement and minimal
swelling in LE.  Pt was given one dose of lasix 10mg IV and
diuresed appropriately.  At time of discharge, she was not
requiring any diuretic.  She was discharged on lisinopril and
metoprolol.
.
# RHYTHM:  Pt was in stable monomorphic VT on transfer to CCU.
Etiology is likely secondary to scarring from previous event.
Pt was initially started on metoprolol 5mg IV and then lidocaine
bolus and drip.  She converted to 1st degree heart block.  On
[**9-30**] started amio 200TID for 14 days of loading, then 300 qday 4
weeks then 200mg qday.  EP was consulted and determined that pt
is not a good candidate for EP study given age and prior goals
of care discussion.
.
# HTN  - Pt was continued on metoprolol.  At time of discharge,
she was taking lisinopril and metoprolol.
.
# Diabetes - on lantus at home.  Was put on ISS during
hospitalization.
.
Transitional:
- Pt will need f/u care with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8098**] per son's request for
management of CHF and CAD, unsuccessful attempt was made to
schedule before discharge
- DNR/DNI status initiated during
