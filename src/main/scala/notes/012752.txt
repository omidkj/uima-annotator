History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 81 yr old who presents to [**Hospital1 18**] as transfer
from OSH for intracerebral bleed. History from daghter as pt.
incoherent. At baseline, the patient is mildly dememented and
forgetful, but was functional enough to
take care of herself and be independent. Then, this past Friday
her daughter noticed that she became very incoherent with her
speech and was non-sensical.  She also became fatigued and
eventually bedbound over the next three days. The patient was
taken to OSH which showed a well circumscribed 20-30cc
intracerebral hemorrhage in the left frontal lobe located
subcortically.  No midline shift or edema. There is also
encephalomalacia of right fronto-parietal lobe suggestive of

UA ([**6-29**]) RBC 0 WBC 12, blood tr, LE small
UCx ([**6-29**]) <10,000 organisms

NCHCT ([**6-26**])
Large intraparenchymal hemorrhage (32 x 44 mm) with edema or
encephalomacia in the left frontal lobe. Large areas of
hypodensity in the right frontal and parietal lobes, with areas
of encephalomalacia. Possible left petrous meningioma

NCHCT ([**6-29**])
Unchanged

Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the Neuro ICU for management of intracranial
hemorrhage.  Neuro exam at that time was significant for waxing
and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] alertness, inattention and nonsensical speech. There
is more spontaneous movement on L> R. No cranial nerve findings.


1.  Neuro:  Left frontal ICH (likely secondary to amyloid
angiopathy)
Antiplatelet agents were held.  Her blood pressure was
controlled on outpatient regimen (Coreg). Rpt head CT showed
bleed unchanged. She was transfered to the floor on [**6-29**].  Neuro
exam remained stable (fluctuating arousal, inattention,
disorientation, follows simple commands, strength normal).
Though the etiology of the bleed is likley to be amyloid
angiopathy, she could have an MRI/MRA with gado as an outpatient
to exclude other possible causes (mass lesion, AVM)-though these
seem unlikely and to confirm susceptibility changes on MR that
would be c/w amyloid.

2.  CV:
Continued on antihypertensives, BP well controlled. Lasix and
aldactone were held secondary to dehydration.  Ruled out for MI
with 3 sets negative CE.

3. Pulm:
No active pulmonary issues

4.  ID: WBC increased, low grade temp 100.6 on [**7-3**].  Repeat CXR
negative.  UA showed 8 WBCS, awaiting Urine Culture.  She was
started on amoxicillin and clarithromycin on [**6-28**] for recently
diagnosed (and untreated) H. pylori infection.  She should
continue on antibiotics until [**7-17**].

5. Nutrition:  Speech and Swallow suggested nectar thick liquids

6. GI:  COntinued on Protonix.  + constipation, KUB negative for
obstruction.  Started on colace and senna, lactulose PRN for
constipation.

6. PT/OT:
d/c to rehab for further management

7. DVT Ppx:
pneumoboots
