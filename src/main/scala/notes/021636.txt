Brief Hospital Course:
74yo male with multiple medical problems including COPD, type 2
diabetes mellitus, and hypertension was admitted from the ED
with shortness of breath.
.
# Shortness of breath.  He was treated for a COPD exacerbation
possibly exacerbated by bronchitis. He was initially admitted to
the ICU and treated with IV steroids overnight, and transitioned
to PO in ICU next day. He continued albuterol and tiotropium
nebs standing.  He was treated with augmentin and improved to
his baseline over his 24 hours of admission. He remains a high
risk for readmission as his symptoms are exacerbated by his
apartment which he describes as stuffy.  He was set up with
visiting nurses for nursing and vital sign management as well as
teaching.
.
# Atypical Chest Pain.  He ruled out for MI, and chest pain
resolved as his respiratory status improved.
.
#  Hypertension.  Blood pressure was elevated in the setting of
respiratory distress, but improved with clinical improvement,
and he was discharged on his home blood pressure medications.
He was treated in the ED with a nitroglycerin drip
.
# Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus .  Initially treated with a sliding
scale, and then resumed metformin.

5. GERD.  Stable.  Continued PPI.
.
6. Hyperlipidemia.  Stable.  Continued statin.
.
7. Urinary retention with bacterial colonization: Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname 31696**] had recently developed urinary retention and had a foley
placed.  The foley was removed with no difficulty.  He had no
further symptoms of a UTI.  He had repeat urine culture, which
showed two different ecoli species, and was discharged only to
complete the augmentin course for his URI/bronchitis.  Of note
he is colonized by ESBL e coli.
