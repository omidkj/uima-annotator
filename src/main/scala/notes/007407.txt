History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 33474**] is a 70 y/o man with PMH notable for COPD on home
oxygen, atrial fibrillation s/p AV junction ablation, and aortic
stenosis who presents to the ED with worsening dyspnea. The
patient's COPD has been worsening since last [**Month (only) 404**], when he
was admitted to a hospital in [**State 108**] for about one month. He is
followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] in Pulmonary here at [**Hospital1 18**] and
has required relatively high dose steroids since that time;
recently, he has been taking 20 mg of prednisone daily prior to
recent admission to [**Hospital1 336**] for COPD flare (d/c'd last Friday).
During that admission, he was treated with increased doses of
steroids (80 mg X 5 days, then 70 mg X 4 days, took 60 mg
earlier today). Today, he noted that his dyspnea was worsening,
especially with exertion, so he presented to [**Hospital1 18**] after seeing
his PCP earlier in the day. (PCP directed him to the ER; call in
states that patient previously grew aspergillus from his sputum
in [**4-/2158**] and again in [**9-27**].)
.
Initial vitals on arrival to the ED were: T 97.1, BP 120/71, HR
95, RR 26, 96% on 2 L NC (home oxygen). He was evaluated in the
ED. CXR showed small bilateral effusions but no infiltrate or
gross fluid overload. He was treated with albuterol/atrovent
nebs as well as 125 mg solumedrol IV X 1. He was not diuresed as
no failure on CXR and BNP only 151. He was planned for admission
to the medical floor, but after having dinner, he noted
increased shortness of breath. ABG done at that time was
7.30/58/60 on his usual oxygen. Due to hypercarbia above ABGs in
our system in the past, he was placed on NIPPV and admitted to
the MICU.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient is on NIPPV and states that
his breathing is improved. He notes some sputum production over
the past few days but no fevers. He denies any muscles aches,
sore throat, nasal congestion, or chest pain. He denies any
increase in LE edema; he has chronic LUE edema following pacer
placement but has had multiple UE ultrasounds which have not
revealed a clot. He denies any nausea, vomiting, difficulty
swallowing, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or constipation. He also
denies urinary symptoms. He feels "tired" and "weak" all over
his body over the past few days. He has been using his inhalers
as directed per his report. He missed his PO lasix dose earlier
today.

CONSISTENT WITH
                                    OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.
      QUALITY OF SPECIMEN CANNOT BE ASSESSED.

   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):
      MODERATE GROWTH OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.

.
Blood culture: No growth

IMAGING:
CXR:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**12-7**], there is no
interval change. Again there is hyperexpansion of the lungs
consistent with the clinical history of chronic COPD. Cardiac
silhouette is enlarged and a dual-channel pacemaker remains in
place. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia or vascular
congestion.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 70 y/o man with stage IV COPD, atrial fibrillation s/p
ablation, and aortic stenosis admitted with increased dyspnea on
exertion.  His hospital course is as follows:
.
# Dyspnea: The patient was found to be increasingly dyspneic in
the ED after being referred for evaluation.  He had been put on
increased dose of prednisone from his baseline 20mg.  There was
no evidence of obvious fluid overload or infection.  Due to
worsening clinical status in the ED, he was put on BiPAP and
transferred to the MICU.  While in the MICU he was started on
azithromycin.  He subsequently improved and was taken off BiPAP
and put on his baseline 02.  He was maintained on his baseline
steroids and was to be given a full course of antibiotics.  He
was also continued on prophylaxis given his chronic steroid use.
 His culture data was unremarkable.  He was discharged to follow
up with his PCP.
.
# Atrial fibrillation s/p ablation: Stable.  His dofetilide was
continued as well as his dilatiazem and coumadin.
.
# Aortic stenosis: Resumed home lasix. Avoided aggressive
diuresis given moderate severity of AS.
.
# Diastolic CHF: Noted on recent cardiac catheterization.  This
appeared to be stable during admission without signs of
exacerbation or pulmonary edema.  We continued his outpatient
diuretic regimen and rate control for afib
.
# FEN: cardiac diet, repleted lytes prn, continue multivitamin &
calcium
.
# Code: FULL for this admission
