History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 1140**] had a syncopal episode in the bathroom on [**11-11**] at
2pm,she woke up on the floor, possibly hitting her head on the
bath tub. Her daugther was in another room and heard the fall,
no
seizure activity. Her daugther helped her lay down and found her
to be confused and incontient a few hours later complaining of a
headache,she drove her to NSMC. He daughter than called EMS and
she was transported to NSMC. Ms [**Known lastname 1140**] states she has had
intermittent headaches over the last few days along with
bronchitis. She had a headache prior to her vasovagal episode. A
CT at [**Hospital6 28728**] Center showed a left frontal SAH. The
patient also had a BP of 220/114 at NSMC. She received Dilantin
and Vitamin K for an INR of 1.2. She was med flighted here for a
neurosurgery evaluation

Pertinent Results:
CTA Brain [**2141-11-12**]:
Upon review of this study with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], endovascular
neuroradiologist, seen on images 55-57, series 3, and on coronal
reconstructed image 17, series 401b, is a probable aneurysm,
arising from the lateral aspect of the supraclinoid portion of
the left internal carotid artery, and directed in an unusual
anterolateral long axis.
The aneurysm appears to measure 1.5mm in maximal width, by
3.75mm in axial
length.  Particularly in view of this revised finding, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
has informed me that the patient will undergo catheter
angiography today, with potential endovascular coiling as well.


CXR [**2141-11-12**]:
Relatively diminished lung volumes with crowding of the
pulmonary vasculature but no evidence of focal airspace
consolidation, pleural effusions, pulmonary edema, or
pneumothorax. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are
upper limits of normal in size given portable technique. No
acute bony abnormality.

NCHCT [**2141-11-13**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Stable moderate ventriculomegaly.
2. Stable, evolving distribution of subarachnoid and
intraventricular
hemorrhage.
3. Stable mild paranasal sinus disease.

ECHO [**2141-11-14**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve leaflets
cannot be determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with normal global biventricular
systolic function. Mild pulmonary hypertension.

CTA [**2141-11-18**]:
IMPRESSION:

No significant change in the size of the intracranial arteries
allowing for the artifact from the coils. Diminutive basilar
artery and P1 segments along with fetal PCA pattern and
prominent posterior communicating arteries withs lightly more
narrow size of the Basilar artery. Assessment for any residual
flow in the coiled aneurysm is limited on the present study.
Followup as clinically indicated. If there is concern for
parenchymal changes, MR can be considered if not CI.

[**2141-11-19**] CXR
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**11-12**] through 10:

Although mediastinal vascular distention is no longer present,
pulmonary
circulation is engorged, and there is mild edema at the lung
bases. Elevation of the left lung base could be due to left
lower lobe atelectasis or upward displacement by abdominal
abnormality such as gastric distention. Right PIC line ends in
the region of the superior cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax.


[**2141-11-21**] LENIES:  No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either
leg

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1140**] was evaluated in the Emergency room, sent for a CTA of
the brain which was suspicious for an underlying aneurysm as the
cause of her intracranial hemorrhage.  She was taken to the
angio suite emergently where under general anesthesia she has a
cerebral angiogram with coiling of a right PCOM aneurysm.

She was extubated immediately after the procedure and
transferred to the ICU on a heparin drip.

ICU Course:
On [**11-13**], The Heparin drip was discontinued. Patient underwent
TCDs that showed no vasospasm. She was febrile and was cultured.
Her HR went up to the 150's and responded to Lopressor.

On [**11-14**], She developed some delerium over night with the
development of fevers and was given a dose of Haldol.
Priliminarly her UA revealed a UTI, she was started on
Ciprofloxicin . She remained stable. Overnight she was found to
be in afib with RVR, treated with lopressor, checked cardiac
enzymes which appeared negative.

On [**11-15**], She remained stable. TCDs showed mildly elevated
velocities but no vasospasm.

On [**11-3**], cardiology was consulted for the arrythmia's that
developed in the ICU, they believe that the underlying Afib was
not new, patient was taken off of the Amiodrone drip and started
on Sotalol. She underwent a CTA to rule out vasospasm after she
was found to have a new right pronator drift.  The CTA was
negative.

on [**11-19**], Patient was found to be somewhat confused and
periodically halucinating. A CTA that was done on [**11-18**] was
reported as questionable for left A1 spasm. She remains in the
ICU with IV fluids and spasm watch.

Her anti-epileptics were discontinued and she was transferred to
the floor after stable TCD's.  Screening lower extremity
dopplers were performed and were negative for DVT.

On [**11-21**] the foley catheter and IVF were discontinued. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
consult was obtained for elevated blood sugars and the patient
was subsequently started on Amaryl [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 9718**] recommendations.
Nursing iniated diabetic teaching.

On [**11-22**] the patient experienced tachy-brady arrhythmias
