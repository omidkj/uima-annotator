Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
worsening shortness of breath and fatigue


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1) PPM: [**2123-4-23**]
Implant of Pacemaker for AV block second degree, Mobitz II
([**Company 1543**] Model# ADDRL1, Serial#[**Serial Number 88600**])

2) TAVI: [**2123-4-27**]
-Transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement with a
31-mm [**Company 1543**] core valve.
-Balloon valvuloplasty with a 22 mm XiMED balloon.
-Thoracic and abdominal aortography.


History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 83yo caucasian male with history of CAD s/p
CABG x 6 in [**2114**], and known symptomatic aortic stenosis. He
reports worsening shortness of breath over the last 2 years.
Cardiac cath revealed occluded SVG to the RCA with collaterals
and otherwise patent grafts. He was referred for screening for
Corevalve/TAVI 8 months ago and was excluded due to large
annular
size. Since that time a new 31mm Corevalve has been made
available. Since prior visit, patient reports decreased exercise
tolerance with ability to walk less that half a block with out
stopping due to shortness of breath. He reports worsening
fatigue, and 10 lb weight loss. Family members report a decline
in his functional status though he remains independent. He
admits
to frequent episodes of lightheadedness and dizziness though
this
is also in the setting of baseline vertigo disease. In addition,
he has known second degree heart block. It has been determined
that he would likely need a permanent pacemaker if having either
surgical AVR or TAVI.
     Informed consent was obtained for the High Risk cohort for
the Corevalve/TAVI study. He met all inclusion criteria and did
not meet any exclusion criteria. He was screened and accepted
and has been randomized to the Corevalve procedure.


NYHA Class: III

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION [**2122-7-23**]. Three vessel coronary
artery disease with 100% occlusion of the SVG to the RCA with
prominent left to right collaterals to the PDA, Patent
sequential
SVG to the proximal LAD and mid LAD; Patent LIMA to the diagonal
branch; Patent graft to OMB1 (that provides collaterals to the
PDA).  The only area of potential ischemia in the inferior wall
is supplied by collaterals from the LCA.

Echocardiographic Measurements

 Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderate symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Overall normal LVEF (>55%). No resting LVOT gradient.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV hypertrophy. Dilated RV cavity. RV function
depressed.
AORTA: Mildy dilated aortic root. Focal calcifications in aortic
root.
AORTIC VALVE: Severely thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets.
Critical AS (area <0.8cm2).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Moderate mitral annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral
valve chordae. Calcified tips of papillary muscles. No MS.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.
Normal tricuspid valve supporting structures. No TS.
Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR. Normal main PA. No Doppler evidence for
PDA
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
  Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function
is normal (LVEF 65%). The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
depressed free wall contractility. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 0.7 cm2). The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined with
certainty or precision (due to the absence of a reliable
tricuspid regurgitation Doppler spectrum) but appears to be at
least moderately elevated. There is no pericardial effusion.
  Compared with the findings of the prior study (images
reviewed)
of [**2122-9-4**], the calculated aortic valve orifice area is
reduced. This is most likely the result of technical factors
(LVOT diameter measurement was 0.1 cm larger on prior study, and
LVOT flow velocity was 0.2 m/sec higher on prior study) rather
than a major change in the aortic valve itself.

CT: CARDIAC STRUCTURE/MORPH, 3D, FUNCTION Study Date of [**2122-9-4**]


FINDINGS:
  CT CHEST: Airways are patent to the level of subsegmental
bronchi bilaterally.  Extensive interstitial changes are noted
throughout the lungs, with subpleural predominance as well as
apical-basal gradient, consistent most likely with nonspecific
interstitial pneumonia. No focal consolidation worrisome for
infection or neoplasm is noted. Focal areas of airtrapping are
present.
  No pathologically enlarged mediastinal, hilar, or axillary
lymph nodes are present. Post-sternotomy wires in a patient
after
CABG are unremarkable.
  Main pulmonary artery is dilated up to 3.8 cm, right main
pulmonary artery is 2.8 cm and left main pulmonary artery is 2.7
cm, findings consistent with pulmonary hypertension.
CT ABDOMEN: Liver, spleen, adrenals, kidneys are unremarkable.
Questionable gallstones are noted, but no evidence of
cholecystitis is present.
  No bowel wall thickening or bowel wall dilatation is present.
There is no intraperitoneal air or fluid. No lymphadenopathy is
seen.
CT PELVIS: Diverticulosis of the sigmoid with no evidence of
diverticulitis is present.  Bladder is unremarkable. No
lymphadenopathy, free fluid, or air is noted.
  Extensive degenerative changes are present in the imaged
portion of the skeleton, but no lytic or sclerotic lesions
worrisome for infection or neoplasm demonstrated.
CTA:
  AORTA: No pathologic aortic dilatation is noted throughout the
entire aorta. Mild tortuosity of the abdominal aorta is present.

Extensive calcifications at the origin of the SMA are noted with
potentially substantial narrowing. Renal arteries are calcified
at their origins but no substantial narrowing is present.
  Aorta bifurcates unremarkably. Minimal focal dissection/mural
thrombus at the proximal portion of the common iliac artery is
present, 7:180. Measurements of iliac and femoral arteries will
be added separately.
  SUBCLAVIAN ARTERIES: Both subclavian arteries are
unremarkable.

     The aortic valve is calcified, consistent with known aortic
stenosis. The patient is after bypass surgery. Extensive
calcifications of native coronary arteries are present. Right
bypass is occluded with aneurysmatic dilatation at the mid
portion.
IMPRESSION:
1. Evidence of interstitial lung fibrosis, consistent with
nonspecific interstitial lung disease.
2. No evidence of aneurysmatic dilatation of the aorta.
3. Pulmonary hypertension.
