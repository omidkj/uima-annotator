History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 86746**] is a 68 year old lady with severe osteoarthritis.
She has had total knee replacement with an excellent result on
the right side and wished very much to have one on the left
side. [**Last Name **] problem here was soft tissue. Within the past few
years she was involved in a pedestrian motor vehicle accident
and sustained a loss of tissue on the anterior and lateral
aspect of her left leg.
This was treated initially with a skin graft I believe at the
[**Hospital6 1708**]. She has been evaluated by her
joint surgeons who correctly noted that a total knee replacement
on the left side "would be perilous and indeedquite unsuccessful
unless she had adequate soft tissue coverage".

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the plastic surgery service on
[**2126-4-25**] and had a Right latissimus dorsi myocutaneous free flap
to left knee.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.
.
Immediately post operative, she was admitted to the surgical
intensive care unit for flap monitoring.  The patient did quite
well on her first post operative day with good vioptix data and
reassuring physical exam.  She was called out to the floor, but
had a 7 beat run of non-sustained VT in the ICU.  She received
magnesium sulfate and remained in a normal sinus rhythm after
that.  She was kept in the ICU an additional night and
transferred to the floor on POD 2.
.
On postoperative day 3, she was transitioned to oral pain
medications.  She was slow to mobilize and her foley remained in
place.  She worked with physical therapy to get up and out of
bed.
.
She continued with PT throughout the remainder of her
hospitalization.  Her foley catheter was removed on POD 5.
.
Prior to discharge she had a thermoplastic splint palced by OT
to allow knee to stay in 20-25 flexion at rest.
.
Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient received Dilaudid IV/PCA
with good effect and adequate pain control. When tolerating oral
intake, the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications.
.
CV: The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint;
vital signs were routinely monitored.
.
Pulmonary: The patient was stable from a pulmonary standpoint;
vital signs were routinely monitored.
.
GI/GU: Post-operatively, the patient was given IV fluids until
tolerating oral intake. Her diet was advanced when appropriate,
which was tolerated well. She was also started on a bowel
regimen to encourage bowel movement. Foley was removed on POD#5.
Intake and output were closely monitored.
.
ID: Post-operatively, the patient was started on IV cefazolin,
then switched to PO cephalexin on POD#6. The patient's
temperature was closely watched for signs of infection.
.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous Lovenox during
this stay, and was encouraged to get out of bed with assistance
as early as possible.
.
At the time of discharge on POD#6, the patient was doing well,
afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet,
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well
controlled.  The patient is being discharged to a rehabilitation
facility to continue her aggressive physical therapy.
