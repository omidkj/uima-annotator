LABORATORY DATA:  On presentation, white count was 15.6;
hematocrit of 33; platelets of 317.  Sodium of 133; potassium
of 3.9; chloride 101; bicarbonate 22; BUN 29; creatinine 0.7

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 449**] was admitted to the general
surgery service under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  He was made
n.p.o. and given intravenous antibiotics and managed
conservatively.  In addition, a chest x-ray on presentation
showed a large left pleural effusion.

Over the next few days, Mr. [**Known lastname 449**] was watched.  A CAT scan
eventually on [**3-6**] showed a significant peripancreatic fluid
collection.  It was decided that this fluid collection might
be the source of his fevers and Mr. [**Known lastname 449**] was taken to the
operating room on the [**9-5**] for pancreatic
debridement.  Please refer to the previous dictated operative
note by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] from [**2107-3-7**].  Mr. [**Known lastname 449**] did pretty
well postoperatively.  He had some leukocytosis and some low
grade fevers.  Several cultures were sent over the next few
days.  These cultures were positive for the organism based
part of the report.

On [**3-15**], Mr. [**Known lastname 449**] had some respiratory difficulties.  He
started requiring more oxygen and had an arterial blood gases
that showed a significant hypoxemia of approximately 60,
despite being on an oxygen face test.  He was transferred to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit for closer monitoring of his
oxygen saturations.  He did relatively well in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit under closer care and on [**3-17**], it was
decided to drain some of the pleural fluid that might have
been precipitating his respiratory difficulties.  A left
thoracocentesis was performed on [**2097-3-16**] during which 1000 cc
were removed.  This fluid was a transudative fluid that did
not appear infected. Please refer to the previously dictated
operative note by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] detailing this procedure.

After the thoracocentesis, Mr. [**Known lastname 449**] did very, very well and
was transferred subsequently to the floor on [**2107-3-19**].  His
subsequent floor course was subsequently remarkable only for
a physical therapy evaluation where it was determined that he
would most likely benefit from return to a rehabilitation
facility for a short time.  Also, Mr. [**Known lastname 449**] was advanced to a
regular diet, which he tolerated very well.

Neurologic:  Mr. [**Known lastname 449**] pain was controlled with either
Morphine if he was p.o. or Roxicet elixir while he was taking
oral medications.  He is going out on Roxicet which controls
his pain very well.

Cardiovascular:  Mr. [**Known lastname 449**] remained on beta blockade as well
as Norvasc and Zestril to control his blood pressure
throughout his admission.  Mr. [**Known lastname 449**]' blood pressure on the
day of discharge was 145/60.

Respiratory:  Mr. [**Known lastname 449**] presented with a left pleural
effusion. He did well. He received regularly scheduled
medications every six hours and eventually required transfer
to the unit as his oxygen requirements started increasing on
[**3-15**].  On [**3-17**], his pleural fluid was drained and he did very
well.  On the day of discharge, he is [**Age over 90 **]% on two liters.

Gastrointestinal:  Mr. [**Known lastname 449**]' presenting problem was fever of
unknown etiology and it ended up that Mr. [**Known lastname 449**]' pancreatic
abscess was probably the cause of this fever.  This was
debrided on his 4th hospital day, after he did very well.  He
was n.p.o. following this procedure and eventually was
advanced to a regular diabetic diet, which he tolerated well,
without nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain.  In addition, Mr.
[**Known lastname 449**] was given enteral tube feeding via his feeding
jejunostomy.  As he began to tolerate more and more of a
regular diet, his tube feedings were cycled to night.  He is
currently on Peptamen 120 cc full strength from 8 p.m. to 8
a.m. every day.

Hematology:  Mr. [**Known lastname 449**] required transfusion of two units of
packed red blood cells during the course of this admission,
due to chronic blood loss anemia.  In addition, he is on
Epogen to help fight this anemia.

Infectious disease:  Mr. [**Known lastname 449**] was cultured multiple times on
this admission.  His two posterior cultures were the wound
culture from the operating room on [**2107-3-7**].  This culture
ended up growing Methicillin resistant staph aureus as well
as Pseudomonas.  He was treated initially with Ceptaz and
Vancomycin for this.  In addition, on [**2107-3-13**], a sputum
culture revealed Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus
as well as Klebsiella pneumonia.  The Klebsiella pneumonia
was resistant to most antibiotics except for Meropenem.
Since the pseudomonas from the drained abscess also was
sensitive to Meropenem, Mr. [**Known lastname 449**]' antibiotics were switched
over to Meropenem and Vancomycin which he will go back to
[**Hospital1 **] on.  He is to follow-up with Dr. ............ in
two weeks. He is to continue his antibiotics at least until
then.

Endocrine:  Mr. [**Known lastname 449**] had some difficulties maintaining his
blood sugars and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consult was obtained to help
control his blood sugars.

Disposition:  Mr. [**Known lastname 449**] came from [**Hospital1 **] and he is
returning to [**Hospital1 **] today on [**2107-3-22**].  He is in good
condition.

3.  Pancreatic abscess.
