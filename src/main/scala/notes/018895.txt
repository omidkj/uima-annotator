Brief Hospital Course:
86 yo male with CAD s/p 4v CABG [**2097**], CHF with EF 35%, atrial
flutter/fib, CRI who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with stable sustained
VT.
.
#Sustained VT / Rhythm
He was taken to the EP lab for a VT ablation which was
successful.  VT terminated and primary rhythym was atrial
fibrillation post procedure.  Post-procedure, he was also
noticed to have a blue toe in the PACU.  He was transfered for
further care to the CCU.  His arterial and venous sheaths were
pulled and blood flow returned to his foot.  DP pulses were
present w/ doppler bilaterally.  He was re-started on his home
dose sotalol [**2118-7-20**] and resumed normal sinus rhythm on [**2118-7-21**]
around 10am.  A 6 point hct drop was noted along with continued
bleeding from groin, and a CT abdomen was performed which ruled
out a retroperitoneal bleed.  A right groin ultrasound was also
performed to rule out pseudoaneurysm and was normal.
Subsequently patient was started on heparin gtts to bridge to
coumadin therapy for goal inr [**1-22**] with lovenox 80 mg daily for
permanent atrial fibrillation.
.
#CAD
Patient also underwent L + R cardiac catheterization.  LIMA and
other grafts were intact and patent.  No angioplasty was
performed nor were stents placed.  He was continued on ASA 325
mg, moexepril 7.5 mg daily, sotalol 80 mg daily.  Atorvastatin
10 mg daily was changed to simvistatin 40 mg daily since LDL was
101 (above goal 70).
.
#COPD
Patient was continued on home medications of atrovent and
albuterol.  Ipratroprium albuterol nebulizer was added on final
hospital day.  He was discharged on home medication advair +
combivent.  Right cardiac catheterization showed severe
pulmonary hypertension.
.
#Subclavian stenosis
The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 6 cardiology service. He
was taken to the cath lab [**7-19**] which showed proximal L
subclavian disease (60-70% stenosis), but it was not intervened
upon due to technical factors.
.
#CHF
He was continued on home medications of sotalol, moexepril.
Lasix was initially held due to low blood pressures.  Pressures
remained in systolic 80-90's; on [**7-21**] he also experienced one
episode of bradycardia and hypotension with a likely junctional
rhythm after dosage of sotalol so home sotalol was reduced to 80
mg once daily and moexepril was decreased to 7.5 mg daily.
Blood pressures remained subsequently in sbp's 90-110s and maps
60-70's.  He was discharged on sotalol 80 mg daily and moexepril
7.5 mg daily.
.
#Incidentaloma
Renal cysts were found bilaterally during CT abdomen exam.  A
renal ultrasound was performed which only showed simple renal
cysts bilaterally.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 25699**] remained afebrile during entire hospitalization.  He
remained hemodynamically stable in the 24 hrs prior to
discharge.  His home dose sotalol was decreased to 80 mg daily
and moexepril decreased to 7.5 mg daily.  His atorvastatin was
stopped and converted to 40 mg daily simvistatin.  ASA 325 mg
daily was initiated and coumadin therapy was started 5 mg daily
for persistent atrial fibrillation.  Home dose medications
advair was continued and started on combivent.  Lovenox 80 mg
daily should be given for 4 days and coumadin 5 mg for 5 days.
INR should be checked Sunday [**2118-7-24**] and the dose of warfarin
should be adjusted accordingly.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with an irregular rhythm called Ventricular
tacchycardia and went to the catherization lab and
electrophysiology lab where you had an ablation of the abnormal
rhythm. Your heart rhythm is still irregular and you will need
to be on coumadin to thin your blood.

Please take all medications as directed. We changed some of your
medications. We d
