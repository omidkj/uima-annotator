HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65-year-old
female with a history of CAD who presents to an outside
hospital on the day prior to admission with the complaint of
nausea and vomiting for two days.  She denied any chest pain
or difficulty breathing, and did not have any fevers, chills,
hematemesis, cough, or abdominal pain.  She did complain of
loose stools for one day.

On the initial evaluation in the Emergency Department, her
temperature was 98.8, heart rate 94, blood pressure 110/76,
and respiratory rate 18, saturating 93% on 2 liters by nasal
cannula.  EKG demonstrated anteroseptal infarction without
acute ST changes.  The chest x-ray demonstrated a left lower
lobe pneumonia and congestive heart failure.  Initial cardiac
enzymes demonstrated a CK of 1,332 and troponin of 54.6.  She
was admitted to the outside hospital Intensive Care Unit and
treated with Plavix, Lopressor, heparin, and Lasix.  She was
given vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl for her pneumonia.
Repeat CK demonstrated a decrease to 1,100 and she was then
transferred to the [**Hospital6 256**] for
cardiac catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial
infarction.
2.  Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 35%.
3.  Diabetes mellitus.
4.  Chronic renal insufficiency, baseline creatinine 2.5 to
2.8.
5.  Depression.
6.  Peripheral vascular disease.
7.  Neuropathy.

ALLERGIES:  Aspirin causes GI upset.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Captopril 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Diltiazem 120 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5.  Neurontin 300 mg p.o. t.i.d.
6.  Actos 15 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Quinine 260 mg p.o. q.h.s.
8.  Remeron 15 mg p.o. q.d.
9.  Iron.
10. Erythropoietin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in a nursing home and has
been do not resuscitate in the past.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  The patient
was afebrile with a temperature of 96.8, heart rate 82, blood
pressure 116/62, respiratory rate 30, oxygen saturation 95%
on 6 liters by nasal cannula.  She was status post coronary
catheterization.  General: The patient is an elderly female
who was ill appearing but in no apparent distress.  Head and
neck examination:  Moist mucous membranes.  Pupils were
equal, round, and reactive to light.  JV pulsation at 9 cm of
water.  Lungs:  Decreased breath sounds at the bases with
crackles and mild wheezes.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm
with no murmurs.  Abdomen: Soft, nontender.  Extremities:  No
edema with 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.  The patient
had a femoral line for her intra-aortic balloon pump in the
right groin.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  The laboratory studies from the
outside hospital demonstrate a white blood count of 12.7,
hematocrit 32.5, and platelets of 337,000.  Panel 7 was
significant for a BUN of 72 and creatinine of 2.8.

Echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of 35% with
2+ mitral regurgitation and global hypokinesis with apical
akinesis.

Chest x-ray had a left lower lobe infiltrate with congestive
heart failure.

EKG was normal sinus rhythm at 80 beats per minute with
normal axis, prolonged PR interval, Q waves in leads V1
through V4, and [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevations in leads V1 through V3
with poor R wave progression.

Right heart catheterization demonstrated RA pressures of 13,
RV pressures of 55/15, PA pressures of 55/29, and a pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure of 24.  The cardiac index was
calculated at 2.6.

Left heart catheterization demonstrated an 80% discreet left
main coronary artery stenosis, diffusely disease left
anterior descending with 95% midlesion, 70% proximal RCA
lesion, and a 90% midleft circumflex lesion.  The left main
coronary artery was stented successfully as well as the left
circumflex.  Both had TIMI-III flow following stenting.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient
was treated with low-dose aspirin and Plavix and quickly
weaned off her intra-aortic balloon pump.  Her cardiac
enzymes continued to decrease to a normal level following
intervention.  She did not complain of any persistent chest
pain following her catheterization and had no further signs
of ischemia.

2.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:   Repeat transthoracic
echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of 20-25%.
She was diuresed with intravenous Lasix but continued to be
short of breath and required supplemental oxygen by face
mask.  Her pulmonary status worsened secondary to acute renal
failure but she did not require intubation.  The decision was
made with the Renal Service to hold off on diuresis while her
kidney function normalized.

3.  ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  The patient had a peak creatinine
of 6.0 following coronary catheterization, likely secondary
to contrast dye nephropathy as well as persistent mild
hypotension.  Her creatinine slowly normalized to 2.8 at the
time of discharge, and she did not require hemodialysis for
volume overload.  After a long discussion with the family,
the patient decided against any future hemodialysis.

4.  PNEUMONIA:  The patient was continued on levofloxacin and
Flagyl for six days for left lower lobe pneumonia.  She
should continue a 14 day course of levofloxacin but the
Flagyl was discontinued given low suspicion for aspiration
pneumonia.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged in poor condition to
a nursing home with hospice care.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Acute myocardial infarction.
2.  Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of
20-25%.
3.  Acute renal failure.
4.  Chronic renal insufficiency with a creatinine of 2.5.
5.  Prolapsed uterus.
6.  Pneumonia.
7.  Diabetes.
8.  Peripheral vascular disease.
9.  Depression.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. q.o.d. until [**2145-6-6**].
4.  Morphine sulfate elixir 5-10 mg p.o. q. one to two hours
p.r.n. pain or shortness of breath.
5.  Ativan 0.5 to 1 mg p.o. q. one to two hours p.r.n.
anxiety.

DISCHARGE PLAN:  The patient will continue to follow-up with
her primary care provider as needed.  She will return to her
nursing home with hospice care.
