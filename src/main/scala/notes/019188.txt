CT RECONSTRUCTION  [**2151-9-7**] 4:55 PM

CT T-SPINE W/O CONTRAST; CT RECONSTRUCTION

Reason: s/p trauma

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
22 year old man s/p gunshot wound
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
s/p trauma
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Status post gunshot wound.

No prior studies are available for comparison.

TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT scanning of the thoracic spine was
obtained without administration of intravenous contrast. Coronal
and sagittal reformations were also obtained.

FINDINGS: There are no fractures identified. The vertebral body
heights and disc spaces are preserved. There is normal
alignment. The visualized elements and spinal canal is within
normal limits. Note is made of an endotracheal tube and NG tube
which appear to be positioned appropriately. The visualized
portions of the lung are remarkable for a partially visualized
dependent consolidations and bilateral pleural effusions. High
density material is also noted surrounding the visualized
portions of the left kidney, which could be consistent with
hemorrhage.

CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: The above findings were confirmed with
coronal and sagittal reformations.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of thoracic spine fracture. Abnormal
chest findings. Please refer to the above discussion.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2151-9-7**] 7:34 PM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: ? penumonia

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
22 year old man s/p gunshot wound.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
? penumonia
INDICATION: Status post gunshot wound.

CHEST X-RAY, PORTABLE AP: Comparison made to prior study of two
days earlier. There is an endotracheal tube with tip 2.8 cm from
the carina. A nasogastric tube is positioned with tip in the
stomach. There is a right subclavian central venous line with
tip in the right atrium. There is no pneumothorax. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. There is a
small left pleural effusion. Bilateral patchy perihilar
opacities are present. Air bronchograms are seen. These are new
from the prior study.

IMPRESSION:
1. Right subclavian central venous line with tip in the right
atrium. This may be withdrawn 2-3 cm for optimal positioning in
the lower superior vena cava.
2. Patchy bilateral perihilar opacities, concerning for
pneumonia or aspiration.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2151-9-7**] 4:54 PM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: s/p trauma

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
22 year old man s/p gunshot wound
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
s/p trauma
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Status post gunshot wound.

No prior studies are available for comparison.

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT.

FINDINGS: There is no intraparenchymal hemorrhage. There is no
shift of normally midline structures, mass effect, or
hydrocephalus. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation is preserved. The
ventricles, sulci, and cisterns are felt to be within normal
limits for patient age. The visualized osseous structures are
within normal limits. The paranasal sinuses are remarkable for
rounded mucosal thickening within the bilateral maxillary
sinuses with associated air- fluid levels as well as air-fluid
levels within the ethmoid sinuses and sphenoid sinuses. There is
diffuse soft tissue swelling in the subcutaneous tissues most
pronounced near the cranial vertex.

IMPRESSION:
1. No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
2. Diffuse surrounding soft tissue swelling.

DIAGNOSIS

Proximal small bowel segments, two:

1.  Multiple perforations, with hemorrhage and focal
coagulation, consistent with gunshot wounds.

2.  The margins are free of disease.

Clinical:  Gunshot wound left lower quadrant of abdomen.

Gross:  The specimen is received fresh labeled with "[**Known lastname **],
[**Known firstname 1790**]" and the medical record number and "proximal small
bowel" and consists of an unoriented 26.3 cm segment of small
bowel with a diameter that averages 2.5 cm.  Both margins are
stapled.  The serosal surface contains a 8.0 x 3.0 cm area of
erythema/hemorrhage that comes to within 0.5 cm of the stapled
margin.  In addition, there are four areas of serosal disruption
with leakage of bowel content measuring 2.6 cm in greatest
dimension and coming to within 1.0 cm of the nearest stapled
margin.  There is a separate 2.5 cm segment of small bowel with
two stapled margins.  The serosal surface contains a 1.0 x 0.5
cm area that is erythematous and appears disrupted and grossly
to be leaking bowel contents.  Sections are submitted as
follows:  A = representative sections of margins of larger
segment, B = representative sections of serosal hemorrhage.  C =
representative sections of area of apparent perforation, D =
representative sections of uninvolved mucosa, E = representative
sections of smaller segment, including area of apparent
perforation.  Gross photographs are taken.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2151-10-8**] 8:35 PM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: compare to prior.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
22 year old man s/p GSW, multiple injuries, propofol infusion
syndrome with cerebral edema now with persistent blurry vision
and gait unsteadiness.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
compare to prior.
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 22-year-old male who is status post gunshot wound
and multiple injuries. The patient developed propofol infusion
syndrome with cerebral edema. Now has persistent blurry vision
and gait abnormalities.

COMPARISONS: Comparison is made to [**2151-9-4**].

TECHNIQUE: CT of the head without IV contrast.

FINDINGS: There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass
effect, shift of normally midline structures, major vascular
territory infarcts. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]- white matter differentiation is
preserved. There is interval decrease in the amount of edema
located in the bilateral occipital lobes medially to the atria
of the lateral ventricles. No new areas of edema are seen. The
ventricles are stable in size. Interval removal of the right
frontal bone.
