History of Present Illness:
61 year old female with PMH of gastric bypass in [**2193-11-25**]
complicated by gastoparesis, decreased PO intake and TPN
supplementation since [**1-29**] who was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on
[**2194-7-13**] for fever, chills, tachypnea, and hypotension. She was
recently admitted at [**Hospital6 **] [**7-6**] for Right PICC
infection. During that admission the PICC was removed and a new
one was reinserted in the Right arm and Levofloxacin was
administered x 3 days. The patient was discarged to home on
[**7-9**]. On the day of admission she noted chills/ rigors and right
flank pain. She called her PMD who told her to come to the ED.
In the ED, the patient was tachypneic (RR 40), oxygen sat 89%
RA, Temp 101.3, BP 98/36, CVP - 5, EKG with sinus tachycardia,
CXR with RLL infiltrate (possibly old) and Lactate 4.1. The
sepsis protocol was initiated. Her Right PICC was pulled and a
RIJ was placed. The patient received normal saline bolus x 4,
Levo/Flagyl/ vanco. Her RR and lactate trended down while in the
ED. While in the unit, the patients Tmax trended down to 99.0,
RR decreased to 20, BP increased to 112/86 s/p IVFs, CVP
increased from [**5-6**].

The patient denies fever, headache, chestpain, dysuria, rash.
SHe also notes a decrease in her baseline nausea and emesis from
12 to 2-3 times/day. She also notes an increase in her baseline
nonproductive cough approximately 3 weeks ago. Pt notes cough
worst when lying down.

[**2194-7-16**] TTE:
The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated. The ascending aorta is moderately
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
not stenotic. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion. No definite valvular vegetations identified.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of
[**2193-12-31**], no definite change is evident.

[**7-13**] CXR
IMPRESSION: . Consolidations are
again seen in the right lung and in the left mid lung zone.

1) The central line tip is in the right atrium. The line should
be pulled
back by 5-6 cm.
2) Right lung consolidation compatible with pneumonia. Follow-up
after
treatment is recommended to ascertain resolution.
3) Atelectasis or early consolidation in the left mid lung zone.



Brief Hospital Course:
A/P 61 year old female with history of gastric bypass with
recent PICC line infection s/p levo x 3 days, currently with
chill/rigors, dry cough; blood cultures + for gram positive
cocci in pairs and clusters;

1. Fevers/Leukocytosis with Bandemia - The patient was admitted
to the ICU with fevers to 101 and with 20% of her increased
white blood cell count being made up of bands. She was started
empirically on Vancomycin for a presumed line infection and her
left PICC line was pulled. A chest x-ray was taken which showed
a multifocal pneumonia and the patient was started on
levofloxacin for presumed community acquired pneumonia. The
fevers and bandemia resolved within 1 day of hospital admission.
On the day of admission, 2 sets of blood cultures were sent and
one set was positive for gram positive cocci in pairs and
cluster; micro came back positive for coag negative staph
aureus; patient was continued on vancomycin and will remain on
vancomycin for 2 weeks s/p first negative blood culture on [**7-14**].
A urine culture was also sent on admission which was negative.
After the first day of admission in the ICU, the patient did
well with no fevers, chills, hypotension, tachycardia.

2. Increased lactate - on admission the patient's lactate was
4.1 and she was hypotensive and febrile; it was thought that she
might have sepsis, so the sepsis protocol was initiated. The
lactate decreased and her blood pressure increased after the
patient received one dose of vanco/flagy/several liters of
normal saline boluses. The patients blood pressures remained
stable after this initial fluid bolus.

3. ST depressions in V4-V6- on admission the patient was
tachycardic to 135 beats per minute. During this time, an ekg
was done which showed ST depressions in V4-V6. Two days later,
the patient was afebrile without tachycardia and another EKG was
done which no longer showed these depressions. Three sets of
cardac enzymes were also negative making ischemia less likely.

4. Nutrition-the patient is on chronic TPN; she was continued on
her home regimen of TPN throughout the ad
