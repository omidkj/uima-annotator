HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 87-year-old female,
who was a resident at the [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.  She was sent to the
Emergency Department on [**8-29**] for evaluation of
fevers.

In the morning of [**8-28**], the patient was noted to
have fevers and also that she was tachypneic.  It was felt
that she might have pneumonia and was started on
levofloxacin.  In the evening, she was noted to have
abdominal tenderness and altered mental status.  Vitals at
this time showed a temperature of 100.8, respiratory rate in
the 30s, systolic blood pressure in the 70s-90s, and she was
therefore sent to the Emergency Department for further
evaluation.

In the Emergency Department, she was found to be modeled and
in moderate respiratory distress.  She was not communicating
verbally.  Her vital signs showed a systolic blood pressure
in the 50s-60s, heart rate in 130s, and respiratory rate in
the 40s.  An ABG was performed, which showed a pH of 7.31,
pCO2 of 25, and a pO2 of 146 on 100% nonrebreather mask.  A
lactate was 11.6.  A femoral Cordis was placed, and 4 liters
of normal saline were given over two hours.  Her blood
pressure remained in the 80s, so a dopamine drip was started
with increase in her blood pressure to the 120s.  Chest x-ray
showed a left lower lobe infiltrate and her urinalysis
indicated a urinary tract infection.  She was given
ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, Vancomycin, and Flagyl.  She was
also given a dose of Kayexalate for a potassium of 6.3.  She
was transferred to the Fenard ICU for further care.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Nursing home resident for the past three
years.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father with Parkinson's disease.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  Vitals:  Temperature 91.4 axillary, heart
rate 122, blood pressure 138/40, respiratory rate 29, and
oxygen saturation of 95% on nonrebreather mask.  In general,
the patient was moaning, attempting to speak with labored
breathing, and accessory muscle use.  HEENT:  Mucous
membranes were dry.  Pupils were equal and minimally
reactive.  Neck:  Supple.  Cardiovascular:  Tachycardic, no
murmurs appreciated.  Lungs:  Coarse breath sounds
bilaterally with a few crackles at the bases.  Abdomen:  Firm
especially in the midline, unclear if there was tenderness,
but no bowel sounds were appreciated.  Extremities were cool
without edema.  Back showed purpuric discoloration over the
bilateral buttocks, flanks, and lateral thigh.

LABORATORIES:  Initial laboratories were significant for a
white count of 39.2, hematocrit of 38.5, and platelets of
136.  The differential showed 25% bands.  PT was 16.5, PTT
32.8, INR of 1.8.  Chem-7:  Sodium 142, potassium 6.0,
chloride 106, bicarb 10, BUN 60, creatinine 2.1, glucose 110
with an anion gap of 26, calcium 11.6, phosphate 5.7,
magnesium 3.8.  AST 289, ALT 258, alkaline phosphatase 105,
total bilirubin 0.9, amylase 93, lipase 18, albumin 3.
Urinalysis showed large blood, nitrite positive, 100 of
protein, moderate leukocyte esterase, [**11-3**] RBC, greater than
50 WBC, and many bacteria.

EKG showed sinus tachycardia at 110, normal axis, and normal
intervals.  T-wave flattening in inferior leads and ST
depressions in V3 without any prior to compare to.

Chest x-ray showed a left base infiltrate.

KUB showed a large amount of retained stool with nonspecific
bowel gas pattern.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted to the ICU with sepsis
with the most likely source being urosepsis versus pneumonia.
She has a ............ and leukocytosis, an anion gap
acidosis, electrolyte abnormalities, and LFT abnormalities as
well as a coagulopathy.  After a brief time off the dopamine,
the patient's blood pressure again fell.  Pressor support was
resumed at this time with levoephedrine, but there was a
continued difficulty with maintaining a mean arterial
pressure greater than 60.

The patient's code status was discussed by doctor in the
Emergency Room with the daughter, who was the patient's
proxy.  It was confirmed that the patient was DNR/DNI.  On
review of the patient's overall clinical status on the
following day, the family agreed to comfort measures only.
They understood the patient's poor prognosis and felt this
would be the patient's wishes.  Once all family members were
informed of this plan and agreed upon it, antibiotics and
pressor support were removed, and the patient passed away on
[**8-30**] at 1:15 a.m.
