Brief Hospital Course:
79yo man with severe COPD, CHF presented with worsening dyspnea,
cough, hypotension.

1. Hypotension/sepsis

Initial differential included sepsis/distributive shock,
hypovolemia,
cardiogenic.  He responded to IVF volume resuscitation.  He was
covered with
broad spectrum abx, with linezolid, levaquin, and flagyl.
Cortisol level was sent.
He was pan-cultured for infectious etiology.

He met inclusion criteria for SIRS/sepsis by virtue of his WBC
with 39% bandemia, elevated lactate, and tachycardia/tachypnea,
and was managed with aggressive
volume resuscitation, broad spectrum antibiotics. He did not
require pressors.

His course was complicated by acute renal failure with BUN/Crn
elevated
to 52/1.0, which was likely pre-renal azotemia.

Ultimately, his infectious sources included MRSA in his sputum
cultures, as well as c. diff colitis. CT was consistent with c.
diff colitis.

Family meeting was held, and it was made clear that the patient
was
thereafter comfort measures only.  He passed away on [**2161-3-15**] at
545. Family
declined a post-mortem examination.
