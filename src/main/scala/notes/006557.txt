initiation of HD, HTN, and chronic dCHF, recurrent
infections/bacteremia, who presents with fever 102.5, headache
and generalized body aches x 1 day. He complains enlarged right

secondary to lower extremity cellulitis in the setting of
scratching his legs and causing skin abrasions. His hospital
course was complicated by very brief MICU transfer for concern
of septic shock. He has developed tender bilateral inguinal
lymphadenopathy. Blood cultures had remained negative. He was
initially treated with vancomycin and cefepime, then
transitioned to clindamycin upon discharge.

In the ED, initial vitals are as follows: 100.2 95 185/94 20
100%RA.
Exam notable for small lymph nodes in his right inguinal region.
Skin does not look erythematous around blisters, not warm to
touch. No murmur was noted on exam. Labs notable for WBC 11.4
with 91%PMNs, BUN/Cr 86/5.2, negative UA, lactate 1.7. CXR
showed no acute process. Blood cultures were drawn x2. The pt
received a dose of vancomycin 1mg IV and cefepime 1gm IV in the
ED. He also received tylenol PO and 1L NS. Vitals prior to
transfer 101.5, 88, 18, 184,89, 100%ra.
Currently, patient feels tired. He still feels a little
generally weak. Lives alone but reports a gentleman nearby
