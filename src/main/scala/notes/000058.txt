History of Present Illness:
On admission to medical floor:
This is a 83 yo M with HTN, HLD, AAA 5.7cm and recent
hospitalization for diverticulosis initially presenting with
cough and SOB.  On [**10-21**], patient experienced significant DOE,
even when walking across the room.  He went to [**Hospital **] Hospital
on [**10-23**] for evaluation where a V/Q scan showed poor perfusion
in the RLL and CXR suggested RLL PNA.  He received azithro, CTX,
and some lasix and was sent to [**Hospital1 18**].  Upon presentation, he had
no focal lung sounds, was talking in full sentences, but was
tired out by moving.  Bedside echo showed no effusion or
ventricular collapse.  An EKG showed TWI V1, V3, unchanged from
previous.  A repeat CXR was unimpressive and not suggestive of
PNA.  Trop was elevated to 0.16, creatinine was 3.6 (unknown
baseline).  He was started on a heparin drip and received vanco
1g to supplement OSH Abx.  CT w/o contrast was performed showing
hyperdense material in the right main pulmonary artery extending
in the segmental branches, concerning for large pulmonary
embolus with mild enlargement of right cardiac [**Doctor Last Name 1754**] raising
concern for possible right heart strain.  No TPA was
administered.  LENIs showed extensive RLE DVT and thrombus in
the posterior tibial vein in the LLE.  Echo showed moderately
dilated RV with free wall hypokinesis.  Retrievable IVC filter
was placed on [**10-24**].  Patient's creatinine rose on [**10-25**] with
concern for low UOP and patient was bolused.
.
Patient reports no recent immobilization or travel, no
malignancy, and no history of clots in his family.  He has had
no previous clots that he knows of.
.
Currently, patient reports improved dyspnea, no chest pain, no
current cough, no fever or chills.  He successfully got up to
the chair to eat lunch today.  He reports no leg pain and has
noted no swelling.
.
ROS: as above, no dysuria, no diarrhea, no PND, no orthopnea, no
productive cough, no joint pains, no numbness or weakness, no
sinus tenderness.

Labs on discharge:

Micro studies:
Blood cultures [**2118-10-23**]: negative x 2
MRSA screen [**10-23**]: negative

Ancillary tests:
CXR on admission [**10-23**]:
Mild bibasilar atelectasis. Cardiomegaly. Otherwise,
unremarkable study.
.
CT chest w/o contrast [**10-23**]:
1. Hyperdense material in the right main pulmonary artery
extending in the
segmental branches, concerning for large pulmonary embolus with
mild
enlargement of right cardiac [**Doctor Last Name 1754**] raising concern for
possible right heart strain.  Findings were urgently discussed
with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5279**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] 10 p.m. on [**2118-10-23**], by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 10304**].
2. Emphysema.
3. Bilateral lower lobe bronchiectasis, with subtle ground-glass
opacities at the lower lobes and area of ground glass opacity in
lingula, could suggest incipient atelectasis; however, cannot
exclude infectious disease involving lower airways.
4. Several subcentimeter pulmonary nodules. Followup CT chest in
6 to 12
months is recommended to document stability, if clinically
warranted.
5. Atherosclerotic changes at the SMA, with proximal dilatation
of SMA which indirectly could suggest stenosis at the origin of
SMA although suboptimal evaluation due to lack of IV contrast.
.
TTE [**2118-10-24**]:
Moderately dilated right ventricle with free wall hypokinesis.
Mild left ventricular hypertrophy with normal regional and
global systolic function (LVEF 55-60%). Dilated ascending aorta.

.
Bilateral lower extremity U/S [**2118-10-24**]:
Extensive right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis as above
and thrombus also seen in the posterior tibial vein on the left.
.
CXR [**2118-10-26**]:
In comparison with the study of [**10-23**], there is probably little
overall change. Again there is enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette with
opacification at the left base consistent with atelectasis and
effusion. The overall appearance is somewhat worsened due to the
low lung volumes. No
evidence of vascular congestion or pleural effusion. Blunting of
the right
costophrenic angle persists.

CXR postintubation [**11-4**]
there has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube ending
4.5 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is new with the tip
in the
stomach. A right internal jugular catheter projects over the mid
SVC. Right
pleural effusion is stable. Increased opacification at the left
lung base
represents worsening atelectasis and effusion. There is no
pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouette and hilar
contours are stable.

TTE [**11-4**]
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 70%). The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
borderline normal free wall function. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2118-10-24**], the right ventriclre is less dilated and
less hypocontractile.

Pan CT [**2118-11-5**]
