Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 69 y.o male with DM type 1, ESRD on HD, CAD s/p CABG, CHF
with EF 20-25% on last echo, COPD per patient account, admitted
with 4-day history of progressive DOE, cough, and wheezing.
*
1) Bacteremia: Sputum, urine cx negative.  Blood cultures have
grown staph epi.  Pt was maintained on vancomycin throughout
admission, and with his chronic renal failure the levels have
remained quite high.  He will go home with followup at dialysis
on monday at which point he will get blood cultures drawn again
along with vancomycin level to determine his next dosing.  He
will need Vanco doses at HD with levels <15 for two weeks.
*
2) SOB/wheezing: Likely was a COPD exacerbation, triggered by
viral infection vs tracheobronchitis. His history of subjective
fevers, chills, and cough certainly raises suspicion for
influenza which was ruled out by aspirate. CXR without
consolidation, WBC normal, remained afebrile. He has true CAD
without any prior history of typical angina (likely silent
angina [**2-12**] DM), but EKG is without changes and he ruled out by
enzymes for MI. No CHF clinically or on CXR.
-Continue Levofloxacin to cover for community acquired
organisms, although no clear evidence of pneumonia.
*
2) CAD: s/p CABG. Rule out as above. Continue ASA, Plavix, BB,
ACEI, statin on discharge.
*
3) Hypertension: Continued Losartan, Metoprolol, Accupril in
hospital and on discharge. HCTZ was discontinued.
*
4) ESRD: Pt will need dialysis as regularly scheduled.  At
dialysis he needs blood cultures and vanco levels drawn then
vanco dosed per level for two weeks. Continue renagel. Patient
being considered for possible kidney transplant.
*
5) DM type 1: Sugars in 300s in ED. Continue out-patient NPH 24
units qAM and 2 units qPM, with Humalog sliding scale QID.
Needs diabetes outpt followup
*
6) Psudohyponatremia: Sodium 133 in setting of glucose 350.
Clinically, patient euvolemic to hypovolemic.   Trended up
through admission and pt remained stable.
