ECG [**2169-1-9**]: Sinus rhythm with non-diagnostic repolarization
abnormalities. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2168-9-30**] there
is no significant change.

CT HEAD [**2169-1-9**]: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

CXR [**2169-1-9**]: IMPRESSION: Small right pleural effusion and mild
pulmonary vascular congestion. Right basilar opacity is most
likely atelectasis, but infection cannot be entirely excluded.

ECG [**2169-1-10**]: The rhythm appears to be junctional with probable
A-V dissociation. The Q-T interval is prolonged. This has
replaced sinus rhythm seen on the previous tracing. The
previously noted non-specific ST segment abnormalities remain.
Clinical correlation is suggested
