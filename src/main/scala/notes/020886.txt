HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 60-year-old gentlemen
who was in previously good health until [**8-15**] when he
felt weak and fell to the ground and also had one episode of
hematemesis.  In retrospect, the patient recalls that one
week prior to admission he had an episode of melena.  Patient
was evaluated at [**Hospital3 3765**] and was found to have a
hematocrit of 25.5.  An nasogastric tube lavage at that time
revealed maroon fluid coffee grounds.  The patient on that
day underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy which showed 2+
varices and erosions in the cardiac antrum.  The patient was
transfused four units of packed red blood cells to stabilize
his hematocrit at 29-30%. The patient underwent a repeat
esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**8-17**] which again showed
2+ varices and gastritis with no evidence of active bleeding.
 At that point, the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital6 1760**] where his hematocrit was
found to be 28.2.  The patient was admitted directly to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit.  The patient underwent a repeat
esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**8-18**] which showed Grade
III varices in the lower one third of the esophagus and also
stigmata of recent bleeding.  Four bands were placed around
these varices.  In addition, the esophagogastroduodenoscopy
showed some evidence of gastritis and portal hypertensive
gastropathy with nonbleeding varices in the cardia.

In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, his creatinine dropped
further to 26 and the patient was given an additional one
unit of packed blood cells to increase his hematocrit to
29.8.  At the time of transfer out of Medical Intensive Care
Unit, the patient no longer had reported any more episodes of
hematemesis.  He denied any abdominal pain but still noted
tarry stools.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Insulin dependent diabetes times 15
years, macular degenerative, chronic urinary tract
infections, no coronary artery disease, left nephrectomy 40
years ago with blood transfusion at that time.

MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:  NPH 50 in the a.m. and 58 in
the p.m., regular insulin 15 in the a.m. and 7 in the p.m.,
Bactrim as needed for his recurrent urinary tract infections
and he is on a macular degeneration study medication.

While in the hospital, the patient was placed on levofloxacin
when there was a question to treat a possible community
acquired pneumonia.  In addition, the patient was placed on
Protonix, propanolol, Lasix and spironolactone.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Negative for any tobacco or alcohol or
injection drug use.  He thinks he may have received
transfusions 40 years ago at the time of his nephrectomy.
The patient has no tatoos.  Is in a monogamous relationship
with his wife and he denies any common history of liver
disease or liver disease.

EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  He is afebrile.  Blood pressure
125/70.  Pulse of 84.  Respirations 24.  02 saturation of 92%
on two liters.  He has [**2-3**] left systolic murmur, heard best
at the left sternal border.  He had no palpable hepatomegaly
and a well-healed nephrectomy scar.  Abdomen was distended
but was not tense.  He had no lymphadenopathy.  He had
palpable distal pulses and trace to 1+ bilateral lower
extremity edema.  He had no asterixes and is alert and
oriented.  He had no spider angiomata, no gynecomastia.  Of
note were occasional scattered cherry angiomata in his trunk.

LABORATORY STUDIES ON TRANSFER OUT OF THE MEDICAL INTENSIVE
CARE UNIT ARE AS FOLLOWS:  CBC:  White blood cell count 12.3,
hemoglobin and hematocrit of 9.8 and 28.1, platelets of
151,000.  Chemistry panel:  Sodium 142, potassium 3.4,
chloride 115, bicarbonate 20, BUN and creatinine of 19 and
0.8 and glucose of 73.  His calcium was 7.1, his magnesium is
1.6, phosphorus is 2.4.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was hemodynamically stabilized
in the Medical Intensive Care Unit and transferred to the
General Medical Service on the regular floor.  Numerous
hepatology studies were sent off including hepatitis B,
hepatitis C and an autoimmune work-up.  In addition, iron and
ferritin were also sent.  His hepatitis B studies are
currently pending.  His hepatitis C is negative.  His H.
Pylori negative.  His autoimmune antibody studies are all
pending.  His iron is 63 and his ferritin is 41.

An ultrasound on hospital day number three showed the
following results:
1.  Small liver with coarse echogenicity.
2.  Massive ascites.
3.  No intrahepatic ductal dilatation.
4.  Splenomegaly.
5.  Gallstones with no evidence of cholecystitis.
6.  Common bile duct of [**1-4**] mm.
7.  SMV and a splenic vein patent. Patent hepatic artery.
8.  Hepatic vein and portal vein that were patent.

The patient's hematocrit continued to improve over the course
of the hospitalization and on discharge ([**8-20**]), his
hematocrit had stabilized to 31.5.  The patient's phosphorus
was low most of the course of admission and at 2.0 to 2.4 and
the patient was given one packet of Neutra-Phos.  The patient
will be discharged to home with no visiting nurse follow-up.
