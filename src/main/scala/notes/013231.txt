Chief Complaint:
barretts esophagaus

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Trans-hiatal esophagectomy for Barrett's esophagus ([**3-11**]) J-tube

History of Present Illness:
 The patient is a 67-year-old
gentleman with a history of high grade dysplasia, found by
EGD. After discussion with the patient and given the risks of
an invasive carcinoma of the esophagus, it was decided to
proceed with an esophagectomy. It was felt that the patient
would best benefit from a transhiatal approach.

. Partial esophagogastrectomy (A-AJ):

1. Barrett's esophagus of the gastroesophageal junction with
extensive low-grade and focal high-grade glandular dysplasia; no
carcinoma is identified (multiple levels are examined on blocks
B, Q and R).

2. Squamous mucosa with mild active esophagitis; cardiac-type
mucosa with chronic, focally active inflammation and focal
erosion.

3. Rare esophageal submucosal, non-caseating granulomas (see
note).

4. Two esophageal submucosal leiomyomata  (measuring up to 0.5
cm).

5. Gastric segment with predominantly fundic-type mucosa and no
carcinoma seen.

6. Five regional lymph nodes with multiple, non-caseating
granulomas and no carcinoma identified (0/5; see note).

II. Left gastric lymph nodes (AK-AP):

Sixteen regional lymph nodes with frequent non-caseating
granulomas and no carcinoma identified (0/16; see note).

BARIUM ESOPHAGOGRAM: Following oral administration of Optiray,
spot fluoroscopic images were obtained and real-time evaluation
demonstrated no apparent leak at the site of esophagogastric
anastomosis. Thin liquid barium was then administered, and
videofluoroscopy was performed in the left posterior oblique,
right posterior oblique, and AP directions. No leak was
identified. No liquid barium is identified with JP mediastinal
drain.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of anastomotic site leak.


Brief Hospital Course:
pt underwent an uneventful transhiatal esophagectomy. was
extubated on pod1 and transferred to the floor. he did have a
small effusion which improved with time. he progressed well.
worked with pt, ambulated, and used his IS. had an epidural for
pain control. tf were started on pod2 at 20cc, put up to 40cc by
pod4 when he had his ngt dc'd, and kept at that rate until pod6
when he passed flatus. on pod7 he had the "grape juice test".
because there was a question of a small amount in his cervical
drain, he underwent a formal swallow which did not show a leak.
he was then started on clears, and the advanced the next day to
post-esophagectomy diet. on pod9 his cervical jp was dc'd on he
was discharged home in good condition, with TF and
post-esophagectomy liquid type diet with f/u in 2 weeks.
