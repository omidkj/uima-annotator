Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Expanding anterior chest hematoma

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**7-28**]: Evacuation of Hematoma in the anterior chest.


History of Present Illness:
The patient has a long complicated cardiac history, who
underwent a re-do sternotomy which was complicated by a sterile
dehiscence. Back earlier
in the year, he had a plating done which unfortunately lead to
infection required for plate removal.  He had a long
postoperative course including an air leak from his left lung
that took weeks and weeks to heal.  He was seen in the office
periodically with seroma fluid but nothing of major importance
and then suddenly the day prior to admission developed a very
large collection. CT scan did not show a source of bleeding and
ther was no sign of contrast in the hematoma at the time of the
CT.  He was brought to the operating room for evacuation.

Chest CT:
Large transthoracic submuscular hematoma and fluid collection
has
developed in the anterior chest wall in the midline from the
suprasternal
notch to the subxiphoid upper abdomen in the space previously
occupied by an air and fluid collection in the bed of the widely
debrided sternum.
Approximately 15% of the abnormality is intrathoracic extending
through the open sternum to the prevascular mediastinum, where
it is entirely separate from the adjacent vital structures,
specifically the left brachiocephalic vein and ascending
thoracic aorta.  The intrathoracic component is roughly twice
the volume it was in [**Month (only) 547**]; the extrathoracic component is
entirely new filling what was previously an air-filled
submuscular space and bulging the pre-muscular sternal soft
tissue anteriorly.  At the level of its greatest
cross-seEctional area, the underside of the aortic arch, the
diameters are 92x 157 mm, for a lesion that is roughly 24 cm in
vertical diameter. Subcutaneous fat is intact.  Cortical
surfaces of the resected sternum, anterior costal cartilages,
and clavicles are intact. There is no pleural or pericardial
effusion.  Atherosclerotic calcification and mural thrombus or
plaque are heavy in the descending aorta, aortic arch, and
aortic annulus as well as the native coronary arteries.
Moderate left ventricular enlargement is unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**7-28**] he was brought to the operating room. A 1 cm incision
was made and were
liquidified blood was removed. A liposuction cannula was used
and standard pool sucker and approximately 800 cc of mostly
liquid blood and some clot was removed.
A 5 mm 30 degree endoscope was put in the hole to completely
examine the cavity. The cavity was a mature seroma cavity and it
appeared that most likely 1 of his pectoralis flaps had pulled
away from the left side of the sternum leading to the bleeding.
It could be seen into the mediastinum, and the heart beating was
visulazed.  There was absolutely no sign of bleeding down in
this area.  Of note, there was great mobility in his 2 sternal
halves with the left half riding over the right half. It was
agreed he was likely going to do this again unless some sort of
fixation was offered to him. Post op, he was brought to the
CVICU and was hemodynamically stable. He had 2 [**Doctor Last Name **] drains
which showed no signs of air leak when put on a Pleuravac and
were subsequently put to bulb suction. They were draining serous
fluid at the time of discharge.  The patient ambulated several
times on the day
