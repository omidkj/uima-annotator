Epinephrine were weaned off and his IABP was removed. Beta
blockers and diuretics were started and he was gently diuresed
towards his pre-op weight. Chest tubes were removed on post-op
day two and he was transferred to the step-down floor for
further care. Epicardial pacing wires were removed on post-op
