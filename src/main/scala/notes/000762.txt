None

History of Present Illness:
85F history of aortic aneurysm s/p repair, diastolic CHF, Afib,
severe aortic regurgitation, and multiple recent admissions for
CHF exacerbation and pneumonia, presenting with bilateral lower
extremity swelling.  Says her leg swelling has been persistent
for the past month despite hospital admission and diuresis with
IV lasix.  She is on home torsemide increased on [**2163-12-5**] to 30

Of note, patient had multiple readmissions, 3 at [**Hospital1 5109**] and 2 at [**Hospital6 **] over the past 3 months
per patient's report.  At [**Last Name (un) 1724**] admission on [**2163-9-27**], she was
treated with doxycycline and uptitrated her home Lasix to 120 mg
daily.  Patient reports hospital admissions for 7 days at
[**Hospital3 **] in early [**11/2163**] for CHF exacerbation,
pneumonia, and LLE cellulitis for which she is on a course of
Clindamycin (exact timecourse is unclear, will obtain OSH
records).

At baseline, patient is on home O2 2L which she wears all the
time. Denies CP, SOB, lightheadedness at home.  Sleeps on 2
pillows, denies PND. Mobility limited by leg swelling and pain.

STUDIES:
CXR [**2163-12-6**] IMPRESSION:
1. Opacity in the right lower lobe consistent with pneumonia or
aspiration.
2. Emphysema
2. Severe cardiomegaly with mild interstitial edema.

EKG [**2163-12-6**] Afib at 67, diffuse TWI, no ST changes, normal axis


CXR [**2163-12-8**] 1. Minimally increased right lower lobe opacity,
either representing aspiration or pneumonia. 2. Cardiomegaly
with unchanged mild interstitial edema.

KUB [**2163-12-18**] AP supine and left decubitus views of the abdomen
show that the gut is fluid filled and not demonstrably
distended. There is no free
intraperitoneal gas.

ECHO [**2163-12-27**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The
estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thickness and regional/global systolic function
are normal (LVEF >55%). The right ventricular cavity is markedly
dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There is
abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. A
bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic
valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc
motion and transvalvular gradients. Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Severe [4+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion. IMPRESSION: Dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle.
Severe functional tricuspid regurgitation. Small left ventricle
with normal global and regional systolic function.
Normally-functioning aortic valve bioprosthesis. Moderate mitral
regurgitation.

ECG [**2163-12-28**]: Sinus bradycardia, rate 54. Sinus bradycardia
persists. There is low voltage throughout raising question of
hypothyroidism. Otherwise, tracing is unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
85F with history of aortic aneurysm s/p repair, diastolic CHF,
Afib, severe aortic regurgitation, and multiple recent
admissions for CHF exacerbations and pneumonia, presenting with
bilateral lower extremity swelling and dyspnea.

#. Acute on chronic diastolic congestion heart failure:  She
presented with substantial peripheral edema, JVD, and
hepatomegaly felt to be severe right-sided heart failure from
severe tricuspid regurgitation.  Also has some moderate to
severe MR felt to be  contributing to her dyspnea.  She has had
multiple recent admissions for her difficult to control CHF.
Denies any chest pain or palpitations during this adm
