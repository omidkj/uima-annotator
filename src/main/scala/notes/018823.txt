Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2090**]
Chief Complaint:
Intracerebral hemorrhage, Headache, change in mental status.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 105462**] is a 77yo LH man with a PMHx significant for
metastatic melanoma (mets to liver and lymph nodes), afib on
coumadin, placement of a pacemaker and lumbar spinal stenosis
who was originally admitted to neurosurg on [**11-12**] and transferred
to OMed on [**11-15**].  He is being transferred to the Neuro ICU
because of concern for altered mental status this AM.
     To briefly recount his history: he had been in his USOH
until the day of admission, when he developed a sudden left
temporal headache.  He was having difficulty walking and
eventually was unable to stand up.  He was found down with
decreased movement of his left side next to his bed.  Concerned,
his wife activated EMS and he was brought to an OSH for
evaluation.  There, a NCHCT showed a right temporal IPH with
intraventricular extension.  His INR at that point was noted to
be "supratherapeutic".  He was intubated and then transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further management (INR on arrival was 2.3).  Upon
arrival, he was admitted to the Neurosurgery service for further
management. He was observed and his anticoagulation was reversed
while on that service.  He was also started on PHT on admission
for seizure ppx.  A head CT with contrast on [**11-13**] was concerning
for an intracerebral hemorrhage,
     On the AM of [**11-15**], he was found to have decreased
responsiveness -- he barely responsive to name, would have
difficulty opening his eyes and and difficult to arouse.  He
also had a fever to 100.4 with perseveration and [**Last Name (un) 6055**]-[**Doctor Last Name **]
breathing.  Concerned, neuroonc was consulted and it was
recommended that he be transferred to the NeuroICU for further
management for concern for worsening of his bleed.  He was
started on decadron and nimodipine.  He also received an extra
dose of phenytoin (200mg) He also received a NCHCT prior to
transfer, that was unchanged from the one the day prior.

CT Head [**11-13**]:
Large right temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with
intraventricular and subarachnoid extension. Given history of
melanoma, underlying mass lesion is a possibility and may be
evaluated with MRI (not possible given pacer).

Follow-up CT's stable on [**11-15**]/10-->done for altered
mental status.

EEG reveals encephalopathy (generalized slowing) with come
assymetry (possibly attributable to hemorrhage).

Portable chest films revealed cephalization and edema, resolving
during the admission. No frank consolidation.

EKG's revealed atrial fibrillation with atrial pacing and some
periods of AF with RVR earlier in admission. Telemetry with rate
control later in admission.
