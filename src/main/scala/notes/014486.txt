Radiology
[**8-30**] BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS. No evidence of lower extremity DVT.
[**8-30**] CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST
CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The airways are patent to the
segmental level. There are bilateral small pleural effusions
greater in the left side. There is continuos linear
calcification in the inferior and posterior aspect of the right
pleura. Small focal calcifications are seen in the posterior and
inferior left pleura. Aside from a few subsegmental atelectases
in the bases, the lungs are clear. The LAD, left circumflex and
right coronary arteries are heavily calcified, cardiac size is
top normal. Otherwise the aorta and great vessels are
unremarkable. Multiple paratracheal lymph nodes measure up10/4
to 7 mm, they do not meet CT size criteria for pathologic
enlargement. A 9 mm lymph node is seen in the right hilum.

In the abdomen, the liver has nodular contour with moderate
decrease in the size of the right lobe keeping with patient's
known cirrhosis. In the upper pole of the spleen there is a
subcentimeter hypodense lesion too small to be characterized.
There are esophageal varices. The gallbladder is mildly
distended. The pancreas, adrenal glands and left kidney are
unremarkable. In the medial aspect of the upper pole of the
right kidney there is a subcentimeter hypodense lesion too small
to be characterized. There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal
lymphadenopathy. There is a small quantity of perisplenic and
perihepatic free fluid. Extensive calcifications are present in
the celiac axis, the splenic artery, the ostium of both renal
arteries and in the SMA. A infrarenal abdominal fusif
