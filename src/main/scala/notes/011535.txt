Hemoptysis

IVC filter placement


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 93447**] is a 46 year old man with a hx of stage IV NSCLC and
remote Hodgkin's disease who presented to the ED at an OSH with
hemoptysis on [**1-20**] where he was observed overnight, discharged
home, then represented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED the morning of [**1-21**] with
recurrent hemoptysis. The patient reports 3 episodes of
hemoptysis since 7pm yesterday, each with 1-2 tablespoons of
blood. Last chemotherapy treatment was [**2167-1-7**] which was cycle 1
of [**Doctor Last Name **]/taxol + avastin.
.
In the ED, initial vitals: 98.5 126 142/106 20 96. He underwent
CTA which showed bilateral PEs with a post-obstructive PNA. He
received CTX and Vancomycin. Interventional pulmonology (IP) was
called as well as oncology and both recommended IV heparin to
treat the PEs. The CT also showed a small intraparenchymal
hemorrhage in the lung but IP felt it was small and was okay
with starting heparin.
.
On the floor, initial PTT was 48 at 8PM and he received a 1300
unit bolus. Five hours latter he developed an additional episode
of cough and hemoptysis of approximately [**12-6**] cup and he was
transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring.
.
On arrival, he reports mild shortness of breath which is
unchanged in the past 4 days. He denies fevers or chills. He
denies dypnea on exertion, chest pain or palpitations. He denies
dizziness or lightheadedness. He has no calf tenderness or
swelling.

Past Medical History:
hx of Hodgkin's disease, stage IIA, dx [**2141**] s/p radiation
therapy. Relapsed in [**2146**], s/p chemotherapy with alternating
doses of MOPP and ABVD.
s/p splenectomy as part of staging laparotomy.
Stage IV NSCLC diagnosed [**12-14**] - Initially presented w/ dry
cough, CP, night sweats [**11-12**]. He underwent CXR [**12-14**] and CT scan
on [**2166-12-18**] revealed extensive new thoracic adenopathy centered
at the right hilus involving both adjacent and remote nodal
stations in the mediastinum with atelectasis, consolidation, and
possible mass involving most of the right upper lobe,
particularly the anterior segment. A destructive T10 spine
lesion with possible invasion of the spinal canal was also
noted, and bilateral thyroid nodules were observed. An
endobronchial core biopsy of the right upper lobe mass revealed
moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.
.
The tumor was positive for CK7, focally positive for CDX2 and
CK20, and negative for TTF-1, EGFR mutation negative. A
transbronchial needle aspiration of 4L, level 7, and 4R lymph
nodes revealed no suspicious cells.
.
A PET scan on [**2166-12-24**] revealed confluent FDG uptake
surrounding the right upper lobe bronchus and right main stem
bronchus, felt to be related to an infiltrating mass versus
post-bronchoscopy change (SUV max 14.1). Marked narrowing and
irregularity of the right upper lobe bronchus and adjacent
pulmonary vessels was noted, suggesting an underlying
infiltrative lesion. Additional involvement includes a left
adrenal nodule, a right mandibular lesion, a distal sternal
lesion, the left sacral body, a lytic lesion in the left femoral
head, the right lesser trochanter, and destructive lesions of
the T10 and L1 vertebral bodies, which demonstrated possible
spinal canal extension. An MRI of the brain demonstrated no
evidence of
brain lesions.
.
On [**2167-1-7**], the patient began palliative chemotherapy with
carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab

Social History:
The patient is married and has three children, ages 8, 12 and
16. He works for a communications company. He enjoys playing the
violin. He has never smoked. He drinks alcohol occasionally.

Family History:
The patient's mother is 75 years old and has diabetes and
obesity. His father is 76 years old and is well. The patient's
maternal grandmother is 101. [**Name2 (NI) 93448**] of his grandparents have
malignancies. The patient's mother has one brother, and the
patient's father had two brothers and two sisters, none of whom
have a history of cancer. The patient has one brother, age 49,
who is well.

Images:
[**1-21**] CTA CHest:
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral subsegmental pulmonary emboli.
3. Right upper lobe likely post-obstructive pneumonia.
3. Multiple spiculated masses in the right lower lobe concerning
for
malignancy.
4. Left lower lobe greater than right lower lobe, and lingular
ground-glass
opacities may represent pneumonia vs edema vs hemorrhage.
.
[**2167-1-22**] Bilaterally LE US;
IMPRESSION: No evidence of bilateral lower extremity DVT.
.
[**2167-1-26**] Bilaterally LE US:
IMPRESSION: Thrombus in a left posterior tibial vein. More
proximal veins of the left lower extremity and the veins of the
right lower extremity are
patent.
.
[**2167-1-28**] KUB:
IMPRESSION: IVC filter adequately positioned at the level of L2
vertebral
body.

[**2167-1-30**] KUB:
Multiple nonspecific air-filled loops of non-dilated small
andlarge bowel are unchanged since [**2167-1-28**]. There is
no free air.

[**2167-1-30**] Barium swallow:
1. Unremarkable esophagram, without evidence of stricture,
narrowing or
filling defect within the esophagus.
2. Mild delayed transit of contrast from the distal esophagus in
to the
stomach.
3. Large right hilar mass is noted on the scout examination,
consistent with the known lung carcinoma.

[**2167-2-12**]: PET:
IMPRESSION: 1. Interval improvement in the disease burden in the
chest. Decrease in the FDG avidity of the multiple mediastinal
and hilar lymph nodes. Unchanged narrowing of the right upper
lobe segmental bronchi with post obstructive changes likely
representing pneumonitis. 2. Multiple new peripheral ground
glass opacities in both lungs predominantly seen in the right
lower lobe demonstrate mild FDG uptake, may represent
post-radiation changes or an inflammatory/infectious process. 2.
Interval decrease in the FDG uptake of the diffuse bony
metastatic lesions. 3. A single focus of increased FDG uptake in
the region of the right pterygoid process is new since prior
study. Recommended attention to this region in the follow-up
studies.

TTE [**2167-2-10**]: Suboptimal study. The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are grossly normal (LVEF 60%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricle is poorly
visualized. There appears to be some degree of depressed free
wall contractility. There is abnormal systolic septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure
overload. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
The aortic valve is not well seen. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. The mit
