evaluation of this finding.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS  [**2152-9-21**] 6:57 PM
There are numerous filling defects in the pulmonary arterial
vasculature. There is a saddle pulmonary embolus, as well as
filling defects in the right and left main pulmonary arteries.
The filling defect in the main pulmonary artery extends into the
subsegmental branches of the left lower lobe. The large filling
defect in the right main pulmonary artery extends into the
subsegmental branches of the right middle and lower lobes. The
branches of the left upper and right upper lobe pulmonary
arteries seem to be opacified.
There is no pneumothorax. There are no pleural effusions. No
pericardial effusions are seen. Few images through the abdomen
demonstrates a low attenuation lesion in the left lobe of the
liver, that is most likely a simple cyst.
Saddle and bilateral main pulmonary artery emboli as described
above.

Brief Hospital Course:
68F amyotrophic lateral sclerosis now with large saddle
pulmonary embolus and extensive bilateral lower extremity deep
venous thromboses status post t-PA.

1. Hemodynamic instability: Patient was initially hypotensive
upon presentation to the emergency department.  However, patient
responded to large volume IV fluid boluses, and pressure
continued to improve following administration of tPA.  Patient
continued to require occasional boluses of fluid following
transfer to the unit, but was completely hemodynamically stable
by hospital day 5 at which point she was transferred to the
floor.

2. Pulmonary Embolus and Deep vein thromboses: Given patient's
large clot burden, hemodynamic instability, and initial hypoxia,
patient was treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen
activator.  Doppler ultrasound of upper and lower extremities
revealed extensive deep vein thromboses in the lower extremities
bilaterally, with none in the upper extremities.  Therefore, a
permanent [**Location (un) 260**] IVC filter was placed by interventional
radiology, and patient was anticoagulated with heparin (target
PTT range 60-100).

Of note, following administration of tPA, patient's hematocrit
dropped ten points, and patient underwent CT of abdomen and
pelvis, which was unrevealing for any occult bleed.  Therefore,
the hematocrit change was thought to be due to hemodilution,
given administration of large volumes of IV fluids upon
presen
