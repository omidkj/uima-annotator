Chief Complaint:
Melena, hematemesis


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD

History of Present Illness:
51 yo M with HCV, s/p interferon/ribavirin with sustained
virologic response, cirrhosis, liver AVM, GIII esophageal
varices presents with one-2 day of melena and hematemesis.
.
The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2-24**] to [**2166-3-4**] for
abdominal pain of unclear etiology. During that admission his
work up EGD with G3 esophageal varices which were not seen on
EGD [**2162**]. He also underwent a liver MRI which showed a liver AVM
which was believed to be worsening his portal hypertension. He
was scheduled for a planned IR coiling of his AVM tomorrow.
However, yesterday he had an episode of melena/BRBPR and today
had what he describes as one cups of hematemesis. He denies
dizziness or lightheadedness but does endorse crampy abd pain.

In the ED, initial VS were: 112 119/85 18 98%. He was given on
liter of fluid and was given a dose of ceftriaxone, pantoprazole
and was started on a octreotide gtt. Hepatology was consulted
who recommended admission and likely endoscopy in the AM. His
tachycardia resolved to HR 77 with 119/56 prior to transfer.
.
On arrival to the MICU, inital vitals were: HR 77 BP 135/77 16
97% on RA . He is complaining of abdominal pain that he says is
severe. The pain started in the ED, is epigastric, associated
with nausea, not associated with SOB or CP.

IMAGING:
[**2166-3-21**] EGD:
Findings: Esophagus:
 Protruding Lesions 4 cords of grade III varices were seen in
the lower third of the esophagus. There were stigmata of recent
bleeding. 3 bands were successfully placed.
Stomach:
 Contents: Clotted blood was seen in the fundus. There was no
gastric varix underneath.
Duodenum: Normal duodenum.
Impression: Varices at the lower third of the esophagus
(ligation)
Blood in the fundus
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum
.
[**2166-3-21**] Hepatic Angiogram by IR:
1. High flow arterioportal fistula supplied by the right hepatic
arteryinvolving the border zone parenchyma between the segments
VII and VIII of the right hepatic lobe.
2. Successful deployment of a 6-mm Amplatzer endovascular plug
effectively shutting down the flow through the arterioportal
fistula.
3. Variant early origin of the right hepatic lobar artery
directly from the celiac trunk.
4. Successful deployment of 6 French Angio-Seal closure device
in the right common femoral artery.

Brief Hospital Course:
51 yo M with HCV, s/p interferon/ribavirin with sustained
virologic response, cirrhosis, liver AVM, GIII esophageal
varices presents with one day of melena and hematemesis.
.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# UGIB: Likely UGIB given hematemesis and known varices. He
underwent EGD which showed four cords of grade 3 varices with
stigmata of recent bleeding, but no active bleeding. Three bands
were applied. Hct was 37.3 in ED, baseline low 40s. Was
tachycardic in ED but resolved with 1 L IVF. He was placed on an
octreotide drip and a pantoprazole drip at the time of
admission. His HCTs were trended and stabilized. He was then
transferred to the floor, where his Hct remained stable. Hct at
the time of discharge was 20.6. Patient was started on nadolol
40 mg daily to reduce risk of further variceal bleeding. He
tolerated this well. Additionally, he was treated with 5 days of
ceftriaxone IV to prevent development of SBP.
.
# Liver AVM: Patient was scheduled for planned ablation during
the time period of this hospitalization. He did receive this
procedure on [**2166-3-21**] with successful closure of arterioportal
fistula by amplatzer plug deployment by interventional
radiology. This procedure was uncomplicated.
.
# Abdominal pain: Patient developed epigastric pain on the first
night of this admission. Etiology of epigastric pain is unclear;
may be related to esophageal spasm (as patient believes) vs.
banding of varices vs. coiling of AVM vs. gastropathy. No noted
gastritis on EGD Differential diagnosis also includes
pancreatitis, but amylase only mildly elevated (108). Pain was
well-controlled with morphine IV initially, then oxycodone PO.
Prior to discharge, he was not requiring any PRN pain meds.
.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
# HCV Cirrhosis: HCV treated successfully with ribivarin and
interferon in [**2163**]-[**2164**] with sustained response. HCV viral load
undetectable in 3/[**2165**]. Cirrhosis complicated by portal
hypertension and GIII varices which may be exacerbated by AVM.
MELD 9 on admission. Received thourough imaging last admission
including RUQ US, Liver MRI, EGD and [**Last Name (un) **]. This issue was stable
throughout his admission.
.
# Herpes simplex: History of genital herpes. No noted lesions at
present. Patient continued valacyclovir 1000 mg PO daily.
.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
# Patient should be scheduled for follow-up EGD to ensure
improvement of varices.
# CODE: Full (confirmed)
# HCP: wife, [**Name (NI) **] - [**Telephone/Fax (3) 13135**]
