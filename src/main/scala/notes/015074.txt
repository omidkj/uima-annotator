History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 90430**] is a 74 year-old left-handed man
with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and emphysema
(on
3L suppl O2 at baseline)initially evaluated at [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 189**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 85061**]
after being found unresponsive and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**]
when imaging revealed several foci of hemorrhage in the left
forntoparietal regions.
.
According to the patient's fiance, Mr. [**Known lastname 90430**] has not been
feeling well for several days (although the details of the
malaise are unclear).  She does recall that he fell down in the
few days prior to presentation.  He presented to his PCP two
days
prior to presentation and was referred for a head CT.  The
study,
performed on the day prior to evaluation, was apparently normal.
.
The patient went to bed (without dinner) at about 4 pm on the
day
prior to evaluation.  On the morning of evaluation, he appeared
to be sleeping comfortably.  At around 11 am, his fiance went to
wake him up for some breakfast.  At that time she found him
lying
on the ground (rather than in bed) bleeding from the ear and
nose.  He was not responsive to voice or tactile stimulation.
She called an ambulance.
.
Reports from EMS suggest the patient appeared to be seizing at
the time of their arrival (no further details available).  The
patient was intubated for airway protection.  He was
subsequently
transported to [**Hospital3 **].  There, vitals were recorded as T
101.7, BP 214/117, HR 121, RR 19.  A non-contrast CT of the head
was done, and showed hemorrhage in the left frontaoparietal
regions.  He was given fospheytoin 1.5 grams and transferred to
the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and care.

Neuro Exam on Discharge:

He opens eyes to voice. He can follow simple commands on left
such as squeezing fingers, showing thumb, and wiggling toes. On
cranial nerve exam, his pupils are reactive. He does not track
but seems to be able to look around room appropriately. He has a
right facial droop. On motor exam, he moves his left side
spontaneously- LUE [**3-27**] and LLE [**2-27**]. He has dense right
hemiplegia.

IMAGES:

CT chest/abd ([**3-5**]): . No evidence of acute intrathoracic or
intra-abdominal injury; Cholelithiasis; Calcifications along the
pleura on the left, likely due to prior asbestos exposure; Focal
aneurysmal dilation of the infrarenal abdominal aorta measuring
up to 3.1 cm.

CT C-spine: No fracture. Alignment maintained. Degenerative
changes noted throughout the cervical spine with moderate
anterior osteophytes and calcification of the anterior
longitudinal ligament. Small posterior osteophytes are noted at
C4-5 and cause mild canal narrowing

CTA ([**3-5**]): Left frontal hemorrhage with mild surrounding edema;
CT angiography demonstrates no evidence of abnormal vascular
structures,
early draining veins to indicate arteriovenous malformation or
enhancing
lesion in the region of hemorrhage; A tiny 1.5-mm infundibulum
versus aneurysm at the right posterior communicating artery is
likely incidental, unrelated to the hemorrhage.

TTE ([**3-6**]): The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
focal basal free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

MR head with and w/out contrast ([**3-6**]): Left frontal intra-axial
hematoma with mild surrounding edema without evidence of
associated abnormal vascular structures or abnormal enhancement;
Chronic microhemorrhage is seen in the right posterior temporal
region; No evidence of acute infarct, midline shift or
hydrocephalus; Small vessel disease; Soft tissue swelling in the
parietal skull.

EEG ([**3-9**]): continuous EEG on [**3-9**] showed a low voltage
slow encephalopathic background throughout. There were no areas
of
prominent focal slowing, but encephalopathies may obscure focal
findings. There were no epileptiform features or electrographic
seizures.

TEE ([**3-9**]): No evidence for ASD/PFO. No atrial thrombus
identified. Simple atherosclerotic plaque in descending aorta
and aortic arch.

MRI/V head ([**3-10**]): Evolving left frontal intra-axial hematoma
with surrounding edema. No evidence of a mass lesion. No
evidence of major dural venous sinus thrombosis. Punctate foci
of slow diffusion is demonstrated in the left posterior frontal
lobe and right parasagittal frontal lobe likely suggesting
hemorrhage. Stable shallow subdural collection overlying the
right cerebral convexity

CXR ([**2173-3-20**]):   The cardiac silhouette and mediastinum are
within normal limits. The lungs are grossly clear.
