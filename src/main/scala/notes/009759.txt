HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74 year-old man
with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation who
presents to the Emergency Room for evaluation of left sided
weakness and facial droop.  He is a [**Hospital3 537**] resident
and was in his usual state of health until several hours
before admission.  He was noticed by the staff to have a left
facial droop and slurred speech with oxygen saturation of
77%.  The patient was suctioned and his saturations returned
to [**Location 213**], but his speech continued to be slurring and his
facial droop progressed to left arm and leg weakness and
confusion.  The patient denies all symptoms at that time,
numbness, tingling, dizziness and was referred to the
Emergency Department for further workup.  In the Emergency
Room the patient was evaluated by the neurological team and
had a negative head CT, but was thought to have a likely
acute cerebrovascular accident.  He was given aspirin,
heparin.  He was also noted to be in atrial fibrillation with
rapid ventricular response to the 140s with a systolic blood
pressure in the 70s.  The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
for further management of his hypotension and rapid rhythm.
He received 2 liters of normal saline in the Emergency Room
prior to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] arrival.  Also received Levofloxacin 500
intravenously times one, Tylenol, Calcium, Diltiazem and
Clindamycin 600.  It is of note that Diltiazem was given
prior to episode of hypotension.

bulk throughout, intact sensory, language fluent and
dysarthric.  No neglect.  Downgoing toes bilaterally.  2+
reflexes patellar and bilateral biceps.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  Creatinine of 1.1, glucose 128,
white blood cell count 22.6 with 86.3 neutrophils and no
bands.  Hematocrit 40, platelets 219, coags were normal.
Blood and urine cultures were sent.  Head CT were negative.
Chest x-ray showed a left small pleural effusion versus
atelectasis or pneumonia.  Electrocardiogram was atrial
fibrillation rate 155, LAD, ST depressions in V2 through V5.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Left sided weakness:  The patient was
evaluated by the Neurology Service for acute cerebrovascular
accident.  He had a head CT, which was unrevealing.  It was
thought that the patient may have had an embolic stroke due
to his known atrial fibrillation and thus an MRI was obtained
as well of the head.  MRI showed generalized age related
atrophy and no acute bleed or stroke.  There was total
occlusion of the right internal carotid artery at the
bifurcation in the neck.  There is reconstitution of the
right MCA.  The patient also had carotid doppler study, which
showed similar findings to the MRI with a right internal
carotid artery occulusion and intracranial location on the
left.  There were velocities consistent with a 40 to 59%
stenosis.  This is thought to be possibly falsely elevated
due to the contralateral occlusion.  The patient's
neurological examination continued to improve.  Within 24
hours his left sided weakness and facial droop were
resolving.  It was thought that due to the right internal
carotid occlusion the patient's symptoms could be due to
hypoperfusion leading to a low flow state and already
compromised right anterior circulation.  The patient was
followed closely by the Neurology Service and was continued
on anticoagulation with heparin during his admission.  He was
started on Coumadin as well to continue long term
anticoagulation.  It is also of note that the patient had an
echocardiogram to rule out embolic force.  Please see below
for details.

2.  Atrial fibrillation:  The patient was initially in rapid
atrial fibrillation upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  He was given
one dose of Adenosine 6 mg.  The patient's rhythm looked like
atrial flutter and then sinus rhythm then trigeminy with a
decrease in rate to the 60s.  The patient's atrial
fibrillation then returned with a rapid rate.  A cardiology
consult was obtained.  Cardiology suggested the use of a
calcium channel blocker or beta blocker in addition to
anticoagulation and recommended if the patient was
hemodynamically unstable in rapid atrial fibrillation to use
intravenous Amiodarone.  The patient's rate did increase with
some hypotension and the patient was started on Amiodarone
drip load and was converted to po Amiodarone. However, he
converted to sinus bradycardia and thus Amiodarone was
stopped.  The patient had also been started on Digoxin, which
was also stopped due to bradycardia.  At the time of this
dictation the patient continued to be in sinus bradycardia
and is simply on anticoagulation.  He is on no
anti-arrhythmic or nodal [**Doctor Last Name 360**].  Echocardiogram was obtained,
which showed an ejection fraction of 60 to 65%, PA pressure
of 26 mmHg, right atrium with mild dilation, normal left
atrium, no embolus, trace to mild 1+ mitral regurgitation.
Serial electrocardiograms were checked and were sinus
bradycardia.  He was continued on telemetry monitoring during
his [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course and was then transferred to the floor in very
stable condition.  He will follow up with cardiology as an
outpatient.

3.  Questionable aspiration pneumonia:  The patient had a
witnessed aspiration in his nursing home.  Chest x-ray was
also consistent with a mild left lower lobe infiltrate.  The
patient was covered broadly during this admission with Zosyn
and Vancomycin due to various positive blood cultures.  The
patient had one bottle that grew staph epi, which was thought
to be a contaminant.  He also had one bottle with
corynebacterium was thought to be a contaminant and one
bottle of alpha strep, which is likely oropharyngeal course.
Repeat blood cultures were negative.  Upon obtaining these
results the patient was switched to po Augmentin for coverage
of a mild aspiration pneumonia.  The patient's Zosyn and
Vancomycin were stopped once we felt certain that most of
these blood cultures were contaminated.  The patient's sputum
and urine were unrevealing during admission.  He remained
afebrile and his white blood cell count trended downward.
Speech and swallow evaluated him for safety and the patient
was thought to be safe for thickened liquids and soft solids
and that is what he was continued on and aspiration
precautions and chin to chest maneuvers.

4.  Hypotension:  Thought to be due to hypovolemia and
possibly rapid atrial fibrillation.  Sepsis was also
initially entertained.  The patient's hypotension resolved
and the patient returned to his baseline hypertension prior
to his transfer to the floor from the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  He was started
on low dose
