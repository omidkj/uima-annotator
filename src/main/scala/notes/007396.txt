Chief Complaint:
Generalized Seizure

History of Present Illness:
History from OSH/EMS records and from family as history from pt
difficult due to baseline aphasia.

Patient is a 77 year old female with past medical history of
left MCA stroke [**8-6**] with right hemiparesis (resolved per
daughter) and residual aphasia, generalized seizure disorder
with ICU admission to OSH [**2-4**] with status epilepticus, chronic
atrial fibrillation on coumadin who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED on
[**2175-5-23**] at 2:35 am as a transfer from [**Hospital **] Hospital as a Code
Stroke.

Per the EMS trip sheet and husband, patient was in her usual
state of health until around 22:30 on [**2175-5-22**]. At that time, she
complained to her husband that she couldn't see out of her right
eye, and then soon after complained that both eyes were blurry.
Thereafter, husband stated "things just got worse". Says that
she got rigid and stopped talking, unclear if she had shaking
movements. Lasted "minutes" but by time EMS arrived she had
relaxed, though was still unresponsive. Occurred while she was
sitting on bed, so no fall or head trauma. EMS arrived at 23:27.
Per EMS trip sheet, no ongoing seizure activity noted. She was
transported to [**Hospital **] Hospital.

On arrival to [**Hospital1 **], vitals temp 97.4, HR 88, RR 10l, BP
121/77l, oxygenation 86%/RA. Patient was not responsive to
noxious stimuli. Intubated after Etomidate 20 mg IV,
Succhinylcholine 100 mg IV, Ativan 2 mg IV, Narcan 20 mg at
00:12 am.

Head CT at [**Hospital1 **] showed atrophy, prior infarct with extensive
encephalomalacia in left frontoparietal lobe superiorly, small
vessel ischemic disease, left MCA dense, no bleed or mass
effect, ?area of attenuation in left thalamus suspicious for
infarct. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED as Code Stroke.

Arrived to [**Hospital1 18**] at 02:35 am. Patient had been given Vecuronium
en route per Med Flight staff. Thus exam on arrival was
complicated by sedation and paralytics, with intact pupils, VOR,
gag, grimace to noxious stimuli but otherwise unresponsive. Pt
was admitted to neuro ICU for further management.

Dilantin level 4.2 on arrival, so patient was reloaded. She
remained with depressed mental status, and EEG on [**5-23**] showed
PLEDs. Dilantin was still <15, so she was given further dilantin
and mental status improved by [**5-24**] and she was successfully
extubated. She is now being transferred to the floor.

On ROS, husband reports that she has had increased fatigue since
her seizures in [**2-4**]. Also notes that they had been in process
of moving from daughter's home in [**Location (un) 1110**] to their home in [**Location (un) **]
and she has thus been under increased stress lately. She was in
similar situation in [**Month (only) 958**] when she had her first seizures.
Additionally, husband reports that coumadin was recently
increased over the course of 3 weeks, and that one dose of
dilantin may have been missed.

Past Medical History:
1. Left MCA stroke [**8-6**] with right hemiparesis, aphasia.
Reportedly underwent extensive rehab and with minimal residual
hemiparesis but residual aphasia.
2. Generalized seizure with admission to [**Hospital1 **] [**2-4**] with
"status epilepticus". Per daughter, this was first and only
seizure prior to this episode.
3. Cardiomyopathy
4. congestive heart failure
5. Essential hypertension
6. Status post ductal carcinoma in situ of left breast status
post left mastectomy 6 yrs ago
7. Chronic atrial fibrillation, on coumadin
8. Lentigo maligna

Social History:
Married. Lives with husband, daughter and granddaughter. Quit
tobacco >30 years ago. Drinks 1 [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5261**] almost every night
before dinner. No other recreational drugs.


Family History:
Son with stroke age 45 secondary to ruptured blood vessel.

Physical Exam:
Gen: WD/WN thin pleasant female, comfortable, NAD.
HEENT: NC/AT. Anicteric. MMM.
Neck:  Supple. No masses or LAD. No carotid bruits.
Lungs: CTA bilaterally. No R/R/W.
Cardiac:  Irreg irreg. S1/S2. [**1-8**] low pitched systolic murmur,
loudest at base.
Abd: Soft, NT, ND, +NABS.
Extrem: Warm and well-perfused. No C/C/E.

Neurological Exam:
Mental Status: Awake, alert. Oriented to name, "hospital" if
give list (unable to come up with word herself due to aphasia)
but not which one, not season or month.  Mostly fluent, no
dysarthria, frequent paraphasic errors, sometimes almost
gibberish or word salad. Can repeat single words, though with
some perseveration and phonemic paraphasias especially with
numbers, difficulty with longer phrases. Unable to read or write
words, wrote "Jag" for her name. Severe anomia. Seemed
relatively attentive but given aphasia unable to formally test.
Can follow most one but not two-step commands, no left/right
confusion. No apparent neglect. Pleasant affect.

Cranial nerves: Difficult to assess visual fields, but seemed
intact. PERRL EOMs full. Can feel light touch, but unable to
assess if equally. Right facial droop. Tongue midline. Shoulder
shrug full.

Motor: Tone, bulk nl. No tremor or fasciculations. Slight
asterixis. No pronator drift. Difficult to formally assess
strength but overall right seems slightly weaker than left.

Sensation: Difficult to formally assess given mild inattention,
aphasia, but seemed intact to pin

Reflexes: brisk and symmetric, decr at ankles bilat, toes seem
chronically up

Coordination: FNF intact. [**Doctor First Name **] intact.

EEG [**5-23**]
Abnormal EEG, due to marked voltage reduction slowing over the
entire left hemisphere with a relatively slowed right occipital
rhythm as well and superimposed lateralized epileptiform
discharges from the left hemisphere anteriorly, both centrally
and frontally, with secondary spread to the right lateral
hemisphere as generalized slow bursts.

Brief Hospital Course:
77F h/o left MCA infarct with right hemiparesis and residual
aphasia, history of generalized seizure [**2-4**], chronic atrial
fibrillation on coumadin who presented after witnessed seizure
and resultant unresponsiveness. She was intubated and sedated at
[**Hospital **] Hospital for hypoxia, inabilty to protect airway.
Initial exam here was therefore limited by sedation and
paralytics. CT head shows old left MCA infarct with
encephalomalacia but no evolving infarct or hemorrhage. Patient
was called as a Code Stroke, but tPA not given due to history of
seizure to explain findings and outside time window. She was
admited to Neuro ICU for seizure and mental status slowly
improved once dilantin became therapeutic.  She was extubated
and transferred to the [**Hospital1 **] where her mental status and
neurological exam seemed to be back to baseline.

1. Neuro: At time of transfer to floor, exam with mostly
Wernicke's aphasia, which per family is at baseline. Initial
dilantin level on admission was subtherapeutic, possibly due to
recent coumadin increase. Therefore, it was decided to change
anticonvulsant to trileptal, which should not have such severe
drug interactions with coumadin.  We plan to continue dilantin
until trileptal titrated to therapuetic level (600 [**Hospital1 **],
currently at 300 [**Hospital1 **]). Patient reports seeing non-disturbing
illusions that others cannot see (seeing a bug on the floor
where there is actually a smudge). Continue ASA 81 as secondary
stroke prevention.
