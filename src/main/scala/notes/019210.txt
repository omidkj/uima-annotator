Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2745**]
Chief Complaint:
fever and tachycardia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is 78 year old man with history of CAD, dementia who
was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2139-11-20**] following
treatment for pneumonia in the LLL.  He was discharged to
complete a course of levofloxacin which ended today.  During
that admission he was evaluated by speech and swallow for risk
of continued aspiration.  At that time it was felt that his
mental status was the most limiting with regard to his ability
to safely take oral nutrition and was recommended to remain
completely NPO. He was found by wife at the rehab facility
earlier today with decreased responsiveness and worsening cough.
 He also pointed to his stomach and was grimacing.  He was
febrile to 100.8 hr 122-126 O2sat 92%RA bp 136/90.
.
In the ED his initial vital signs were 102.4  140  124/p 28
94%RA.  He had a chest xray that was concerning for a LLL
infiltrate and he received 1 dose of vanc/zosyn for HAP.  He
received a total of 4 L of crystalloid.  His intial HR of 140s
decreased with tylenol and IVF.
.
ROS: no diarrhea. no rash. no difficulty passing urine. no
nausea or vomiting.

IMAGING:
CXR ([**2139-11-22**]) - The patient is status post CABG and median
sternotomy wires are intact. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
unchanged. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. Left basilar
discoid atelectasis has cleared. Osseous structures again
demonstrate mild widening of the left acromioclavicular joint
without change.  IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary
abnormality.
.
ECG ([**2139-11-22**]) - Sinus tachycardia @ 114bpm. Left axis
deviation. Left anterior fascicular block. No major change.
.
CXR ([**2139-11-23**]) - Lung volumes are low. Patchy and linear
bibasilar opacities are present, with configuration favoring
atelectasis over an infectious pneumonia. However, if clinical
suspicion persists, followup radiograph may be helpful.
.
Non-contrast Head CT ([**2139-11-23**]) - No hemorrhage, mass effect, or
shift of normally midline structures. The ventricles remain
moderately enlarged, which may partially be due to age-related
involutional change; however configuration is again suggestive
of hydrocephalus, unchanged. Extent of periventricular and
subcortical white matter hypodensity is stable and consistent
with chronic microvascular ischemic disease. Visualized
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells remain normally aerated.
Atherosclerotic calcification is seen within the cavernous
carotids.  IMPRESSION: 1.Compared to prior exam from [**10-24**], [**2138**], there is resolution of subarachnoid hemorrhage and
intraventricular blood. 2.The ventricles remain prominent, which
is partially reflective of age-related involutional change;
however configuration is suggestive of underlying hydrocephalus,
essentially unchanged from prior exam.
.
AXR ([**2139-11-23**]) - There is a nonobstructive bowel gas pattern.
Moderate amount of stool is seen within the colon and rectum. A
G-tube is present. Surgical clips are identified within the left
upper quadrant.  IMPRESSION: No evidence of obstruction.
.
CXR ([**2139-11-24**]) - In comparison with the study of [**11-23**], there is
little overall change. Mild atelectatic changes are seen at the
left base. A slightly more coalescent opacification medially
could possibly represent a developing pneumonia, though this
still could well represent merely atelectatic change.
.
CXR line placement ([**2139-11-24**]) - Tip of right PICC line
terminates in upper right atrium, approximately 2 cm from the
cavoatrial junction. Heart size is normal. Aorta is generally
large and tortuous. Lung volumes are low with atelectasis of the
left lung base. Otherwise, lungs are grossly clear. No evidence
of pneumothorax. If any, small left pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: Tip of right PICC line terminates in upper right
atrium, approximately 2 cm from cavoatrial junction. No evidence
of pneumothorax.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 78 year old man with a past medical history of
multi-factorial dementia, h/o [**2139**] with diffuse SAH and
intraventricular hemorrhage and hydrocephalus, CAD,
hypertension, hypothyroidism, BPH, and a recent admission for
pneumonia, who presented from rehab with worsening fever, cough,
and tachycardia. He was stabilized in the MICU with IV fluid
resuscitation and empiric broad-spectrum IV antibiotics.
.
#. Fevers - The patient presented from rehab with worsening
fevers while on levofloxacin for treatment of pneumonia. He was
started on empiric broad-spectrum IV antibiotics (Vancomycin and
Zosyn) while in the MICU, with a contaminated sputum culture and
blood and urine cultures showing no growth to date. Urinalysis
was clear, chest X-ray was underwhelming, influenza DFA was
negative, and stool C.diff toxin was negative as well. The
patient was noted to have unclear abdominal discomfort, but
liver function tests and an abdominal X-ray were also
unrevealing. Given the patient's history of recent exposures to
many health-care settings and failure of improvement while on
levofloxacin, it was believed that his fevers were likely due to
a nosocomially-acquired pneumonia. The patient became afebrile
and his leukocytosis normaliz
