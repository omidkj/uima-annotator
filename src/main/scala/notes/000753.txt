Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest tightness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
51yo M w/ HTN, diastolic CHF, hyperlipidemia, sleep apnea,
asthma who had initially presented to an OSH on [**2168-9-5**] with
chest tightness ([**4-5**]), SOB, hypoxia (02 sat to 88%). His
initial EKG showed 2mm ST-T elevations in II, III, aVF and
bigeminy which resolved with SL NTG. He also had elevated
cardiac enzymes (tropT of 1.04).  He was given [**Month/Year (2) **], plavix,
heparin, integrilin and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath. Here his
CE were: CK 1009, CKMB 55, trop T 4.23. At cath, he was found to
have CAD of a non-dominant RCA, probable prox. LPDA stenosis as
well as mild stenoses of the OM and mid LAD. There was also
iatrogenic dissection of the RCA w/o compromise of the lumen or
flow and possible distal embolization/additional dissection of
the AM1. No interventions were made (lesion not amenable to
PCI).
.
Post-cath, the patient had 500cc of guaiac positive coffee
ground emesis, he was orthostatic at the time. An NGT placement
was attempted, however the pt. desated and vomited and the NGT
was not placed. At this time, integrillin and heparin were
stopped and IV PPI was started. A few hours later, the pt.
became hypotensive to the 70's and hypoxic (74% on RA), he again
vomited approx 100cc of coffee ground emesis. His hypotension
responded well to a 500cc fluid bolus and his 02 sats improved
to 95% on a face mask(10L). The patient was then tranferred to
the CCU.

[**2168-9-7**] bedside ECHO: initial read per fellow- suboptimal
quality due to body habitus-moderate to severe eccentric MR,
preserved LV fxn with inferior hypokinesis, RV normal, PA
pressures normal, trace TR, no significant pericardial effusion,
no observed VSD. Mild LVH. LVEF of 55-60%.
.
[**2168-9-7**] TTE:
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is at least
moderate resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. The
findings are consistent with hypertrophic obstructive
cardiomyopathy (HOCM). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. There
is systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets. At
least moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2168-9-7**],
the findings are similar (the resting LVOT gradient is slightly
lower and the overall LVE is slightly greater).  Peak Resting
LVOT gradient: *60 mm Hg (nl <= 10 mm Hg)
.
[**2168-9-6**] Cardiac cath: LAD with mild calcification, ? of mild-mod
mid LAD plaque after D1, LCX with mild-mod stenosis at origin of
OM, prabable prox. moderate stenosis of LPDA, RCA with
dissection possibly on top of pre-existing proximal RCA plaque.
diffuse disease (80%) of AM2, AM3.
.
EKG on admission to CCU: NSR, normal axis, TWI in III, avF, V6.
?qwave in III, normal intervals.
right sided EKG: no ST elevations or depression in the
pre-cordial leads.
.
CTA Chest [**9-12**]:
There is no intimal flap within the thoracic aorta to suggest
aortic dissection.  No filling defects are identified within the
central
pulmonary arteries to suggest acute or chronic pulmonary
embolism.  The main pulmonary artery measures 3.9 cm in greatest
dimension suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension.  There
is a small pericardial effusion.  Coronary artery calcification
is notable within the left anterior descending coronary artery
and left circumflex artery.  There is cardiomegaly.  No
axillary, mediastinal or hilar adenopathy is detected.
There is near-complete atelectasis/collapse of the left lower
lobe.  There is atelectasis within the right lower lobe.  There
is abnormal elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. This study was
not performed to evaluate structures below the diaphragm.
However, there is a simple-appearing cyst within the left lobe
of the liver measuring 1.9 x 1.3 cm.  Partially visualized
spleen and stomach is unremarkable.
.
Echo [**2168-9-13**]:
Focused study for patent foramen ovale: No ASD/PFO present via
color Doppler, or saline administration. Moderate pericarial
effusion located posterior to the inferolateral wall. Mild
resting LVOT gradient that increases with Valsalva manuever.


Brief Hospital Course:
51 yo M w/ HTN, hyperlipidemia, [**Hospital **] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
cath for inferior-STEMI. No intervention at cath. Noted to have
coffee-ground emesis post-cath with hypoxia and hypotension,
transferred to CCU.
.
#CAD:
Presented with inferior STEMI, no [**Hospital1 **] at cath, medically
managed.
Patient discharged on plavix 75mg [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] daily, atorvastatin,
and metoprolol.  He has follow-up with his primary care doctor
in 2 weeks and with cardiology in mid-[**Month (only) 359**].  He had no
further episodes of chest pain during his hospitalization.
.
#Hypotension:
Pt had transient episode of hypotension in the setting of a
recent inferior MI and 2 episodes of bloody emesis.  His blood
pressure responded to IV fluids and home lasix was held, and his
BP remained stable throughout the rest of his hospitalization.
It was felt that his hypotension was due to preload dependence
due to inferior MI, volume depletion after large volume emesis.
In addition, it was noted
