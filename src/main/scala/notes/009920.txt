in his left leg and feet.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin, Neurontin, Prevacid,

ALLERGIES:  KEFLEX.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a former smoker but quit many years
ago.  Negative ethanol.  A retired insurance [**Doctor Last Name 360**].  He lives

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  His admission
examination was unremarkable except for gastrointestinal
examination; he was noted to have an old midline scar.
Neurologically, he was alert and oriented times three.  His
smile was symmetric.  The tongue was midline.  The pupils
were equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation
(3.5/3).  The extraocular movements were full.  Cranial
nerves II through XII were intact.  His strength on the right
was 3 all the way around and 5 on the left.  Unable to elicit
any reflexes.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted
on [**2119-2-13**] for lumbar drain placement.

A lumbar drain was placed at the bedside.  The lumbar drain
was placed via an epidural catheter.  He did well with the
procedure.  He had good flow of his cerebrospinal fluid.
Post procedure, his neurologic examination was unchanged.

He continued to do well.  His gait improved.  The lumbar
drain was discontinued, and discharge planning was started.

On [**2-15**], he suddenly became short of breath.  He
complained of new onset back pain.  He was noted to be
tachypneic, and his oxygen saturations had dropped down to
88.  He was taken for a computed tomography scan to rule out
a pulmonary embolism.  The computed tomography scan revealed
multiple large bilateral pulmonary emboli.  Lower extremity
Doppler
ultrasounds were obtained which were negative.

He was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for
closer monitoring due to his respiratory difficulties.
Anticoagulation therapy was started at this time.

On [**2119-2-17**], he became confused and agitated.  A
repeat scan of the head was done which showed no acute
intracranial hemorrhage.  It did note stable moderate
enlargement of the ventricles.  He also had a transesophageal
echocardiogram done at this time which showed normal left
ventricular systolic function of 50%.

On [**2-18**], he was neurologically stable and transferred
to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] Five.  He continued to have periods of somnolence,
confusion, and difficulty speaking.  He had been
intermittently febrile with his white blood cell counts at
22.

On [**2-19**], he was started on levofloxacin 500 mg by
mouth.  His white blood cell counts continued to trend down
from 22 to 14.

On [**2-23**], his anticoagulation was reversed in order to
perform a lumbar puncture to rule out meningitis as per
Neurology recommendations. A lumbar puncture was done. The
results were consistent with meningitis.  Infectious Disease
was consulted and recommended vancomycin and meropenem
intravenously to be started with continuation of his
levofloxacin.  They also recommended a magnetic resonance
imaging scan which showed a spinalepidural/ subdural hematoma.

On [**2-26**], the patient became weak, and he was taken
emergently to the operating room for a lumbar decompression
and evacuation of his subdural hematoma.  Prior to his
procedure, an inferior vena cava filter was placed in angio.

Post surgery, he was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] Nine (which is an
Intensive Care Unit setting) for closer monitoring.  He
arrived at the Intensive Care Unit awake and alert but not
oriented.  He was moving all extremities well.  His
respiratory rate was regular and in no acute distress.

His mental status slowly continued to improve.  Physical
Therapy and Occupational Therapy were involved with his care.
He remained stable and was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] Five.  On [**Hospital Ward Name 121**]
Five he continued to do well.  His mental status continued to
slowly improve.His final CSF cultures were consistent with
aseptic meningitis. The MRI of Lumbar spine was also suspicious
for L5-S1 discitis.

On [**2119-3-2**], a peripherally inserted central catheter
line was placed for long-term antibiotics for his
osteomyelitis (six to eight weeks).  He continued to do well
with Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy and was ready
for [**Hospital 3058**] rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION/ASSESSMENT:  Neurologically stable and
ready for [**Hospital 3058**] rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Probabl aseptic meningitis stable on intravenous antibiotics

intravenous antibiotics for six to eight weeks).
3.  Normal pressure [**Hospital 94942**]; stable.
