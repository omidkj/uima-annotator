Date of Birth:   [**2091-3-22**]     Sex:  F

Service:  [**Location (un) 259**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75-year-old female status
post fall down two flights of stairs with loss of consciousness
confirmed.  She suffered a C1 fracture during the fall which is
evident on CT scan of the cervical spine. She is also noted to
have a 4 cm thoracic aorta aneurysm on CT scan of the chest.
There is no evidence of dissection on the CT scan of chest.  The
patient complains of chest pain today, but that pain has
resolved.  She denies any nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or
shortness of breath.  She is transferred from the outside
hospital [**Hospital3 **] complaining of back, chest, and right elbow
pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with home O2 on 2
liters nasal cannula.
2. Peptic ulcer disease.
3. Hypertension.
4. Status post cholecystectomy.
5. Status post aortobifemoral graft bypass in [**2163**].
6. Status post CEA.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1. Lopressor 50 mg po bid.
2. Atrovent and albuterol nebulizers.
3. Centrum.
4. Prilosec 20 mg po q day.
5. Calcium.
6. Vitamin D.

ALLERGIES:  None.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with son and daughter. She
smoked two packs a day for the past 60 years, but quit a few
years ago.  She rarely drinks alcohol.  She denies any IV drug
use.  She is a DNR/DNI for her code status.

EXAMINATION UPON ADMISSION:  Temperature of 98.8, pulse of
101, blood pressure 95/58, respiratory rate 28, and 93% on 2
liters.  HEENT:  Right eye ecchymosis.  Cardiovascular:
Tachycardic, regular rhythm, normal S1, S2.  Chest was clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.  Back is tender
to palpation in the lower back.  Extremities:  Right elbow
skin abrasion.  Neurologically:  She is alert and oriented
times three, moving all four extremities.

LABORATORIES UPON ADMISSION:  White count of 12 with 88%
neutrophils, hematocrit 35.3.  Sodium 126, potassium 4.7,
chloride 87, bicarb 26, BUN 26, creatinine 0.8, 156 glucose,
CK 128, MB 6, troponin less than 0.3.  INR is 1.  PTT is
25.3, PT is 12.4.

The patient is transferred to the Medical floor on [**2166-5-29**]
given her numerous medical problems.  Upon transfer,
patient's laboratories were white count 9, hematocrit 31.3,
platelets 419, potassium 4, sodium 136, chloride 95, bicarb
33, BUN 22, creatinine 0.7, glucose 151, calcium 9.3,
phosphate 3.5, magnesium 1.7, INR 1, PTT 27.6, PT 12.6.
Urinalysis shows trace blood, 100 protein, 1 urobilinogen,
0-2 red cells, [**3-12**] white cells, no bacteria, [**6-17**] squamous
epithelial cells.

Arterial blood gas done on [**5-28**] showed pH of 7.31, pCO2 34,
and pO2 of 64, on 2 liters nasal cannula sating 89% with a
lactate of 0.7.  Free calcium 1.31.

A [**5-28**] chest x-ray showed signs of congestive heart failure
and bibasilar atelectasis with left sided pleural effusion.
A [**5-28**] video swallow showed that she can do puree and nectar
liquid foods and aspirates with thin liquids.

Electrocardiogram upon transfer is normal sinus rhythm at 112
beats per minute.  There is a S in lead I, a Q wave, inverted
T wave in lead III, there is normal axis and interval.  There
is T-wave inversion in V1 and V3.

1. Tachycardia:  Patient's tachycardia was of unknown etiology.
Given her electrocardiogram findings of a right heart strain, it
would suspect that she may have a pulmonary embolism, congestive
heart failure, or bronchospasms.  She was sent for a CTA of the
chest which showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism.  She
continued to be tachycardic, so she was given Lasix to help
diurese her.  She was also sent for echocardiogram which showed
ejection fraction of 80% with left ventricular hypertrophy.  She
did suffer a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (by
troponin, with negative CK's) during her tachycardia, so she was
put on aspirin, beta blocker, and IV Heparin.  Also her
bronchospasm can be contributing to her tachycardia especially
with the albuterol treatments, so all beta
agonists were discontinued on this patient.

2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:  Patient was continued
on her Flovent and Atrovent MDIs with Atrovent nebulizers prn.
Her oxygen saturation was maintained between 90-92% with 2-4
liters of oxygen.  Again her hypoxia is most likely secondary to
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease given that the CTA was
negative for any pulmonary embolism.

3. C1 fracture:  Given that she did have a C1 fracture, her
hematocrit was monitored closely while she was on the Heparin.
Also a CT scan of the head was obtained which showed no bleed
from the fall.

Three days prior to the patient's demise, she did have an episode
where she became hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in
the 80's and a desaturation to the 70's on 4 liters.  CCU was
given, given that she had some ST depressions and elevation on
the electrocardiogram, that it was felt that she can be medically
managed with the current regimen of aspirin, beta blocker, and
Heparin.  She then began to also desaturate, so she was put on a
nonrebreather, and her oxygenation did improve.  She was also
given 500 cc normal saline bolus and her blood pressure came up
to 120/80.

Unfortunately, her heart rate continued to be in the 110's to
120's, and so she was given beta blocker which only worsened her
breathing.  She was then tried with some pain control with
Morphine and that helped to decrease her tachycardia and
shortness of breath.  A venous gas was obtained during this time
showing a pH of 7.4, pCO2 64, and pAO2 of 30.

The MICU was called, but she did not require transfer given that
she was saturating well on the nonrebreather.  The MICU was made
aware that she may possibly need BiPAP for her breathing
difficulties.  She remained tachycardic, so she was transferred
to the Cardiac floor, where a central line was placed, and the
patient was started on IV diltiazem.  Her heart rate was
controlled in the 80's, and her blood pressure did maintain about
the systolic of 100's.

However, on [**2166-6-1**], she went into asystole.  So she was
DNR/DNI. No CPR was done per the patient's wishes.  She died on
the morning of [**2166-6-1**].

THE DIAGNOSIS OF HER LAST HOSPITAL STAY OF HER LIFE:
1. Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.
2. Hypertension.
3. Congestive heart failure.
4. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
5. C1 fracture.

DATE OF DEMISE:  [**2166-6-1**].
