Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4654**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever/SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 62 y/o Cambodian female with PMH of chronic HBV,
HTN, asthma, DM and nephrotic syndrome who presents from home
with fevers and SOB. History is largely obtained from patient's
daughter who is able to interpret. Per the patient's daughter
her mom was in her USOH until last evening around midnight. At
that time the patient was noted to be calling out for her from
the bathroom, screaming. The patient reported that she was
unable to urinate and felt chilled and requested the heat be
turned up. She was shivering uncontrollably. She complained of
SOB and she was given 2 nebs with minimal relief. Temp. at that
time was 103 and she was given 2 tylenol. She went to bed and
this morning was found by her sun to have continued chills and
was very lethargic. EMS was called and Temp. was 105 tympanic.
The patient reports that she has had dysuria, inc. unrinary
frequency and urgency for the last 2-3 days. Over the last day
she has had decreased urine which has looked very concentrated.
Per the daughter she has been eating and drinking normally. She
has also had a mild cough for the last day. She denies sick
contacts. She denies diarrhea or vomiting. He last BM was today
and was normal.
.
In ED the patient's VS were T 104.2 BP 164/60 HR 126 RR 32 93%
RA, 99% 3L. CT abd/pelvis was done and showed ? fluid around
gallbladder. RUQ US then performed that was negative for
cholecystitis. UA was grossly positive. Blood and urine cultures
sent. She was given vanc/zosyn, Tylenol 1gm, duonebs x2 and a
total of 3L IVF. Spiked a temp to 102.9 and was given an
additional 1gm tylenol. Labs were notable for lactate 3.2 which
normalized after IVF. She became acutely SOB and tachypneic to
30s. She had audible wheezing on exam. Repeat CXR was done and
was negative for flash pulm edema. She was then given solumedrol
125mg IV, duonebs x 2, magnesium 2gm IV, and SL nitro x1. Her RR
decreased the the patient's SOB improved. Sats remained 96-100%
on 4L. She was admitted ot the ICU given her worsening resp.
status in the ED.
.
On arrival to the ICU the patient is accompanied by her daughter
who is able to translate. The patient reports that her SOB is
significantly improved, however she still has some mild chest
tightness and SOB. She denies nausea, abdominal pain. She
endorses some "warmth" in her lower abdomen as well and dysuria.

.
ROS is positive as per HPI. She denies nausea, vomiting. Her
appetite and PO intake have been normal. She denies LE swelling,
orthopnea or PND. Denies melena or hematochezia.

Pertinent Results:
[**2116-4-5**] CXR
SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST: Evaluation is degraded by
motion. Lungs are
well expanded and clear without consolidation, pleural effusion
or
pneumothorax. The heart is moderately enlarged, as previously.
There is no
hilar or mediastinal enlargement. Pulmonary vascularity is not
overtly engorged. Soft tissue and bony structures are
unremarkable.

IMPRESSIONS: Cardiomegaly. Motion artifact

[**2116-4-5**] CT abdomen
1. Small amount of fluid surrounding the gallbladder, which is
mildly
distended. If symptoms correlate to the right upper quadrant,
ultrasound is
recommended to evaluate for acute cholecystitis.

2. Endometrium prominent for given age and further evaluation
may be obtained
with pelvic ultrasound on a non-urgent basis.

[**2116-4-6**] Echo
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a fat pad.

[**2116-4-8**] KUB:
.
FINDINGS: The bowel gas pattern is unremarkable, without
evidence of
obstruction or ileus. No pneumoperitoneum. Soft tissues are
unremarkable.
Lung bases are clear. Of note, there is moderate cardiomegaly.
Visualized
osseous structures are unremarkable.
.
IMPRESSION: Non-obstructive bowel gas pattern.
<br>

CXR [**2116-4-8**]:
.
INDICATION: Cough, mild left lower quadrant pain. The lung
volumes are
relatively low, both hemidiaphragms are slightly elevated.
Minimal
hypoventilation at the bases of the left lung. Otherwise, the
lung parenchyma is normal. No pneumonia, no overhydration. On
the lateral radiograph, minimal dorsal pleural effusions are
seen. Normal appearance of the hilar and of the mediastinum.

Brief Hospital Course:
62 y/o F with DM, diabetic glomerulosclerosis, nephrotic
syndrome, chronic hepatitis B, HTN, and asthma was in ICU for
Urosepsis and Resp Distress from flash pulm edema following
fluid resusitation initially in [**Name (NI) **] - pt stabalized in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] -
cont IV abx for E. Coli UTI and bacteremia/sepsis, called out to
medical floor on [**4-7**] for continued care. Pt with slow recovery,
changed to po cipro on [**2116-4-9**] -cont to be afebrile, [**4-6**] and
[**4-7**] Blood Cx NGTD at time of d/c - plan to d/c to home with
home services with details of course as below:
<br>

# Urosepsis (E. Coli UTI, and E. Coli Bacteremia/Sepsis): urine
grew E.coli (pansensitive)
- was on IV Ceftriaxone (day 1=[**4-5**]) -> [**4-6**] blood cultures
without growth
- switched to po Cipro [**4-9**] (pan-sensitive E. Coli) cont to do
well for 24h
<br>

# Respiratory Distress with CHF as below/Chronic Asthma: was
initially though to be in setting of sepsis and likley from
worsening of Asthma. No evidence of PNA or overt pulm edema -
did have mild congestion. Has severe diastolic HF. Received
solumedrol (in ICU
