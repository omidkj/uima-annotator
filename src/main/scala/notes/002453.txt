EKG: sinus @86. LAE. no Q waves. trace ST depressions laterally.

CXR: The lungs are clear, without pulmonary airspace
consolidation, effusion or evidence of pulmonary edema. Cardiac
silhouette remains enlarged. Hila are within normal limits.
Osseous structures are unremarkable.

CT A/P ([**11-4**]): LUNG BASES: There is small right pleural effusion
and minimal bibasilar dependent atelectases. The lung bases are
otherwise clear. CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:
Ascites and free fluid within the pelvis are not significantly
changed. The liver, pancreas, and adrenals are unremarkable.
There is small amount of pericholecystic fluid, likely related
to ascites. The spleen is mildly enlarged, measuring 13.6 cm.
The kidneys are small bilaterally, without focal abnormality
identified. The aorta is normal in caliber. Prominent nodular
soft tissue attenuation adjacent to the IVC may relate to
dilated lymphatics and is unchanged. There are no pathologically
enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes. The small bowel and colon are
normal in caliber, without evidence of wall thickening. CT OF
THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Free fluid within the
pelvis is unchanged. The rectum, sigmoid colon, prostate, and
seminal vesicles are unremarkable. There is no pelvic or
inguinal lymphadenopathy.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or blastic osseous lesion is
identified.
IMPRESSION: 1. Stable ascites. 2. Small right pleural effusion,
decreased in comparison to [**2123-4-16**]. No evidence of acute
intra-abdominal process.
3. Splenomegaly.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is 44 yo man with history of Type 1 Diabetes and ESRD
who presented with flank pain and hypertensive urgency in the
setting of prolonged N/V/D.

#. Hypertensive urgency - Patient presented with hypertensive
urgency while at [**Month/Day/Year 2286**].  In the ED, his BP was 181/76.  He
was transferred to the MICU, where a central line was placed,
and he was started on a Labetalol drip.  He was weaned off the
Labetalol during his first night in the MICU, after which he was
able to tolerate his PO medications.  It appears that this
hypertensive episode was secondary to medication non-compliance
amd fluid overload in the setting of N/V/D.  The patient was
dialyzed twice while in the hospital, and his BP returned to his
baseline when PO medications were restarted.  He was discharged
with close outpatient follow-up.
.
# Flank pain:  The patient has left-sided flank pain, which has
been present since [**2119**].  Despite previous workup of CT, MRI,
and U/S, no clear etiology has been found.  It is thought that
this may be secondary to thoracic neuropathy.  Despite multiple
pain regimens and pain service consultation, his pain has flared
in this manner several times over the last 6 months requiring
hospitalization for IV narcotics and BP control.  The patient
was ruled out for a MI, and he was restarted on his home doses
of Tylenol, Lidocaine patch, Duloxetine, and Neurontin.  He was
also given Morphine prn for pain.  Patient tolerated these
medications well and stated that his pain was somewhat improved
on discharge.

#. Stage 5 CKD:  Patient has a history of stage 5 CKD.  He
received [**Year (4 digits) 2286**] twice during this hospital stay.  He was
continued on his home regimen of B Complex-Vitamin C-Folic Acid
1 mg daily and PhosLo 667 TID, as soon as he was able to take
oral medications.  He did not have any acute events during this
hospital stay.
.
#. Diabetes:  Patient has a history of Type 1 Diabetes.  He was
continued on his home regimen of 70/30 home regimen of 15 units
in the morning and 20 units with dinner.  He tolerated this well
and did not have any acute events during this hospital stay.
