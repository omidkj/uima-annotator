HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 66 year old female
with a past medical history of lung cancer status post left
upper lobe resection in [**2190**], hypothyroidism status post
thyroidectomy for follicular thyroid cancer, and
hypocalcemia, who initially presented to an outside hospital
with chest pain radiating to her back while she was shopping
on the [**1-3**].  She did not have any associated
symptoms.  She ruled in on the [**1-5**] for non-ST
elevation myocardial infarction with a peak troponin of 3 and
a peak CK of 175.  Her electrocardiogram at the outside
hospital showed normal sinus rhythm with T-wave inversions in
leads V2, V3, and had a Q-wave in lead 3.  She was
transferred from the outside hospital on [**3-7**] after a
diagnostic catheterization showed a left main 50% lesion, a
90% left anterior descending lesion, severe tricuspid
regurgitation, and apical hypokinesis with an ejection
fraction of 55%.  At the outside hospital, she was also noted
to have hypotension after she was started on a Nitroglycerin
drip.  However, her pressures quickly responded to
Neo-Synephrine and intravenous fluids.  In addition, she had
a CTA of the chest that was negative for pulmonary embolism
or aortic dissection.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] on [**3-7**] to the cardiothoracic
surgical service.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Non-small cell lung cancer, status post left upper lobe
resection in [**2190**].
2.  Follicular thyroid cancer, status post thyroidectomy.
3.  Hypothyroidism.
4.  Hypocalcemia.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1.  Aspirin.
2.  Plavix.
3.  Protonix.
4.  Levoxyl 125 micrograms.
5.  Tylenol.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She had a 10 pack year smoking history, but
quit smoking 30 years ago.  She drinks two alcoholic
beverages a week.  Lives with her husband.

FAMILY HISTORY:  No history of coronary artery disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Afebrile, heart rate 75; blood
pressure 113/53; respiratory rate 20; oxygen saturation rate
97% on room air.  General:  Awake, alert and oriented, no
acute distress, pleasant.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:
 Extraocular movements intact, pupils are equal, round, and
reactive to light, anicteric sclera, moist mucous membranes,
no cervical lymphadenopathy.  Cardiovascular examination:
Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 S2, systolic ejection
murmur at the left lower sternal border.  Lungs:  Dry
crackles at the left lateral lower lung field, otherwise
clear to auscultation.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender,
nondistended, normal active bowel sounds.  Extremities:  No
cyanosis, clubbing or edema, no femoral bruits.  Neurological
examination:  Alert and oriented, cranial nerves [**12-29**]
intact bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White blood count 4.3;
hematocrit 32.7; platelets 206; sodium 140; potassium 3.2;
BUN 7; creatinine 0.5; ALT 44; AST 41; chest x-ray showed
evidence of prior left upper thoracic surgery, no acute
cardiopulmonary abnormality; echocardiogram showed ejection
fraction 70%, normal left ventricular wall thickness, size,
and systolic function, no left ventricular masses or thrombi,
no ventricular septal defect, the right ventricular free wall
is hypertrophied, the right ventricular cavity is dilated,
there is depressed right ventricular systolic function, there
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted to the
cardiothoracic surgical service and was transferred to the
cardiology service on [**3-8**] for a cardiac
catheterization.  She underwent a cardiac catheterization
which showed one vessel coronary artery disease.  The left
main had a distal taper into the left anterior descending
which had a 70% ostial stenosis.  The left circumflex and
right coronary arteries were normal.  The ostial left
anterior descending lesion was successfully stented with a
drug alluding stent and the left circumflex was successfully
rescued and only had a mild residual stenosis.  Following the
procedure, the patient became hypotensive requiring the use
of Dopamine for blood pressure support.  She was transferred
to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit where an echocardiogram
showed a small pericardial effusion, no evidence of tamponade
physiology, and no evidence of cardiogenic shock.  She was
given aggressive intravenous hydration and calcium repletion
as she was hypocalcemic.  The Dopamine was subsequently
changed to Neo-Synephrine which was weaned off on [**3-10**].

The patient underwent a repeat cardiac catheterization on
[**2197-3-9**] for recurrent chest pain and ischemic
electrocardiogram changes.  This cardiac catheterization
revealed the left anterior descending stent to be widely
patent and the mid left anterior descending had diffuse
disease.  The left circumflex ostial lesion had a discreet
50% narrowing.  Upon further examination during the
catheterization, a small focal linear dissection was believed
to be seen near the ostium of the left circumflex artery.
Therefore, the proximal left circumflex stenosis was treated
with stenting using a drug alluding stent and post-dilated
proximally using balloon angioplasty.  The patient tolerated
this catheterization well and returned to the Cardiac
Intensive Care Unit.  Further work-up of the patient's
hypotension included an abdominal and pelvic CAT scan which
did not reveal any evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.

The patient was transferred back to the cardiology service on
[**3-11**] where she was observed overnight.  The following
morning she remained symptom free with low normal blood
pressures in the high 80s to low 100s systolic.  She will be
discharged on a medical regimen for her coronary artery
disease including Aspirin 325 mg once daily, Plavix 75 mg
once daily, Toprol XL 25 mg once daily, Lipitor 10 mg once
daily, and she was instructed to follow-up with her
cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 32255**], at [**Hospital **] Hospital for
initiation of ace inhibitor therapy.  In addition, the
patient was continued on her calcium carbonate and Vitamin D
supplementation, along with her Levoxyl for her
hypothyroidism.  It is suspected that the patient has
hypoparathyroidism, secondary to her thyroidectomy.  She was
instructed to follow-up with her primary care physician and
may need further endocrine work-up as an outpatient.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with follow-up.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Please take all your medications as
prescribed.  Please follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 32255**] and Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 4223**] within 2 to 3 weeks.  Please have Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4223**] check
your calcium level and have Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4223**] consider having you
follow-up with an endocrinologist for your hypocalcemia.

1.  Coronary artery disease status post left anterior
descending and left circumflex stenting.
2.  Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.
3.  Hypothyroidism.
4.  Hypocalcemia.
5.  Hypotension requiring a Cardiac Care Unit admission.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
