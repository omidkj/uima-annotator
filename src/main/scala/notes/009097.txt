Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This is a 70 year-old female with a history of diastolic heart
failure, CKD, and DM2 who presents with shortness of breath,
hypoxia and acute on chronic renal failure. She was placed on a
NRB in the ambulance, satting 92, and was transitioned to BiPAP
in the ED, started on nitro gtt, and received a dose of
furosemide 40mg IV. Of note, the patient was recently admitted
with acute on chronic renal failure and her furosemide was held
on discharge. She put out 600cc urine to the 40 of lasix IV, and
per ED report, the patient felt symptomatically improved after
the dose. ABG on arrival was 7.36/36/47 after being initiated on
bipap.

IMAGING:
=======
[**2171-7-12**] CHEST (PA & LAT) - COMPARISON: [**2171-7-10**].
FINDINGS: There is marked improvement in degree of pulmonary
edema, with only mild pulmonary vascular congestion remaining.
Bilateral small effusions remain present, but significantly
decreased. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. There is
no focal consolidation or pneumothorax. IMPRESSION: Significant
improvement in degree of now only mild interstitial edema with
residual small bilateral effusions.
.
[**2171-7-10**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) - IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to
[**7-8**] & 12. Severe bilateral consolidation worsened
appreciably. Perihilar distribution suggests this is edema,
although mild cardiomegaly has not worsened. Moderate right
pleural effusion has increased.
.
[**2171-7-8**] RENAL U.S. - IMPRESSION: 1. Normal right kidney; 2.
Atrophic hyperechoic left kidney with abnormal Doppler
waveforms. If clinically indicated, cross- sectional imaging
could be performed for further characterization.
.
[**2171-7-6**] CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST - IMPRESSION: 1. Multifocal
perihilar areas of consolidation and ground-glass opacity
associated with smooth septal thickening, bilateral pleural
effusion, most prominent on the right, interstitial fluid,
bronchial wall thickening and mild cardiomegaly as well as small
pericardial effusion suggesting pulmonary edema; 2.
ongravitational asymmetric ill-defined peribronchial vascular,
partly nodular and partly ground-glass, opacity with air
bronchogram suggesting multifocal pneumonia, most prominent on
the right; 3. Subpleural right upper lobe nodule. In the absence
of risk factor, no further followup is warranted. If risk factor
is present for lung cancer, chest CT is recommended in 12
months; 4. Coronary artery calcifications, aortic and aortic
annulus calcifications are scattered; 5. Calcified gallstone.
Right renal artery stent. Left renal atrophy. Diverticulosis.
.
[**2171-7-5**] BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT - IMPRESSION: No evidence of
lower extremity DVT of either leg.
.
[**2171-7-8**] Cardiac Echo (TTE) - LA is markedly increased
(>32ml/m2). The left atrium is dilated. The interatrial septum
is aneurysmal, no ASD. Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity
size. LV systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg), no VSD. RV chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. No As or AR. Mild (1+) MR. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no
echoca
