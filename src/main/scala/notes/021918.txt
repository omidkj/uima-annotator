INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thicknesses and cavity size.
Hyperdynamic LVEF.
No resting LVOT gradient. No LV mass/thrombus. No VSD.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV wall thickness. Normal RV chamber
size. Normal RV
systolic function.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Focal calcifications in
aortic root.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Moderate mitral
annular calcification. Moderate thickening of mitral valve
chordae. Calcified
tips of papillary muscles. No MS. Mild (1+) MR. [Due to acoustic
shadowing,
the severity of MR may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
Prolonged (>250ms)
transmitral E-wave decel time. LV inflow pattern c/w impaired
relaxation.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Normal tricuspid
valve supporting structures. Moderate [2+] TR. Moderate PA
systolic
hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR. Normal main PA. No Doppler evidence for PDA

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF
70-80%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. Right
ventricular systolic function is normal (bordering on
hyperdynamic). The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate
thickening of
the mitral valve chordae. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly
UNDERestimated.] The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests
impaired
relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.



Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] under code sepsis, was continued on broad
spectrum antibiotics since no clear source. And per protocol,
was initiated on dobutamine for low Sv02. Pt continued to be in
respiratory distress, and eventually required intubation.  DFA
returned positive for Influenza A.  Her blood pressure continued
to drop, and per discussions with the family, all pressors were
withdrawn and she was placed on a MSO4 drip.  She passed on
[**2181-12-15**] at 4:20PM.  The family declined autopsy.
