Brief Hospital Course:
42 year old male with a history of HIV (CD4 in 66 [**9-24**], on
HAART and dapsone), polysubstance abuse, SI/attempts,
depression, HCV/cirrhosis, seizure disorder and DM2 who presents
with h/o being combative at his residence, and was initially
obtunded with pinpoint pupils found to have Utox positive for
benzos, cocaine, methadone and opiates, admitted to MICU.
Initial w/u for infectious source unrevealing and only recieved
1-2doses of vanc/cefepime/acyclovir. BP improved after IVF.  LP
defered [**12-19**] low plts. MS improved on own and likely [**12-19**]
polysubstance abuse/intoxication.  Stabilized, then transfered
to Gen Med. Did well, woke up, no infectious issues, chronic
issues all stable as outlined below. Medically stable. Psych
following and reccommended inpatient psych, medically stable for
transfer. follow up arranged with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**12-14**]. Many of his
psych meds (except suboxone and celexa) as well as his clonidine
were held, will defer to psych on restarting. BP was decent and
no withdrawal symptoms, given h/o bradycardia with clonidine and
DM, would prefer to start ACE if neccessary for elevated BP.
.
See note below for details.
.
Mental status change: Likely [**12-19**] acute intoxication
(polysubstance). Abx stopped as no infectious source
(blood/urine/cxr neg). CT head neg. Improving on its own.

well as clonipine (on 2mg tid at home)

.
.
Bradycardia:  sinus brady (on clonidine), now improved . Also
has a prolongd QTc on prior EKGs, likely [**12-19**] multiple
medications (esp antipsychotics)
-HR stable in 70s. would start ACE if needed for BP instead of
clonidine as can cause bradycardia
.
.
Pancytopenia: Pancytopenia previously documented as far back as
[**2130**]. Hem/Onc consult [**11-24**] suggested may be [**12-19**] to drug, hcv,
hiv. Will continue to monitor, has been stable
-monitor on heparin, consider d/c (add SCDs) if pt is ambulating
.
.
HIV: Most recent CD4 count in [**2140-9-17**] was 66
- Continue dapsone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].

.
HTN: Holding clonidine as BP has been running low and
bradycardia. Pt should follow up with PCP regarding switching
[**Name9 (PRE) 26998**] given dual use of suboxone and clonidine.
Should consider starting an ACE-I given diabetes.

diet as outpt, try to encourage, sugars decent here.
