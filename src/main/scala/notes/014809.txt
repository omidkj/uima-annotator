hypertension, coronary artery disease and congestive heart
failure who presented with abdominal distention and shortness
of breath.  Patient was in his usual state of health until
approximately four days prior to admission when he began
experiencing abdominal discomfort, bloating and inability to
pass gas.  Patient also reported urinary burning but no chest
pain, shortness of breath, melena, bright red blood per

99.7 and had an electrocardiogram with question of ischemic
changes.  He got Lasix 80 mg intravenous times one,
ceftriaxone, Azithromycin, albuterol and Atrovent and had
blood cultures drawn.  Patient had an episode of transient
hypertension with systolic blood pressure of 80.  During
questioning the patient complained of abdominal distention,
no abdominal pain, fevers, chills, nausea but an accompanying
cough with whitish sputum.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Is significant for chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, hypertension, congestive heart failure,
coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass
graft in [**2155**], paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and pacemaker
secondary to complete heart block, peptic ulcer disease,
alcohol use and anxiety.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  Lasix 80 mg p.o. q.d., spironolactone 25 mg
p.o. q.d., BuSpar 10 mg p.o. t.i.d., aspirin 81 mg q.d.,
Toprol XL 50 mg p.o. q.d., Terazosin 20 mg p.o. q.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his wife at home.  He
denies any alcohol or drug use and quit smoking previously.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission vital signs:99.1, 106/92,
76, 26, 99% on nonrebreather.  General appearance: a pleasant
male in no apparent distress.  Skin:  positive skin tenting.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat: anicteric, oropharynx
clear.  Neck: Jugular venous pressure at approximately 6 cm,
no lymphadenopathy.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and
rhythm, S1 and S2.  Pulmonary: diffuse rhonchi bilaterally.
Abdomen:  positive distention, no abdominal tenderness,
positive bowel sounds.  Extremities: no edema, no calf
tenderness.  Neurologic: alert and oriented times three.
Rectal: brown stool, trace guaiac positive.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 18.1, hematocrit 41.5 and
platelets 127.  Electrolytes: 135, 5.0, 90, .7, 69, 3.5 an
193.  Coagulation studies:  13.6, 31.5 and 1.2.  CK was 63,
troponin 0.4.  Urinalysis was negative for leukocyte
esterase, had large blood, negative nitrites, negative
glucose but 750 RBCs, 11 to 20 white blood cells and moderate
bacteria.  Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 76
beats per minute with primary AV conduction and block and a
PR interval of approximately 240.  Abdominal x-ray showed air
filled loops of small bowel with colonic distention, fecal
material in the cecum and colonic distention as well.  Chest
x-ray showed heart size within normal limits, a pacemaker in
place and no infiltrates, no pneumothorax, question of
atelectasis in the right middle lobe.  Arterial blood gases:
7.30/73/96 with a lactate of 1.7.

The patient was admitted to Medical Intensive
Care Unit.  He was treated for presumed
pneumonia with likely component of congestive heart failure.
However, his respiratory status continued to worsen with large
amounts of secretions and increasing abdominal distention
possibly, secondary to ileus, and the patient was intubated.  He
was treated with an aggressive bowel regimen with improvement in
his ileus and decrease the distension.  Despite continued
aggressive care, the patient remained ventilator dependent and
was unable to be liberated from mechanical ventilation.
He subsequently had a congestive heart failure exacerbation.
Given the patient's previously expressed wished, his family felt
he would not want continued intubation and would want to be
extubated.  They understood that this would likely result in his
passing away but felt strongly this was most consistent with his
wishes.  Therefore, the endotracheal tube was withdrawn on [**4-1**]
and the patient was treated aggressively with Lasix for
his congestive heart failure and antibiotics for presumed
pneumonia along with aggressive suctioning of his secretions.
Unfortunately, he passed away on the
evening of [**2162-4-1**] from respiratory failure despite
the aforementioned measures.  He was kept comfortable throughout.
