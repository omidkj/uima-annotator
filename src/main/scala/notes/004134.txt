Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2474**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Re-intubation

History of Present Illness:
65 YO M with severe COPD, schizophrenia, pulmonary hypertension
who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with worsening cough, dyspnea, and
hypoxia over the last 3 days. VNA found pt to be hypoxic and
with sats in 70's. EMS was called and noted him to be cyanotic.
His O2 improved to 80's with oxygen.
.
Upon presentation the the ED, his VS were: 97.6 72 131/79 18 98%
on NRB. He was taken off the NRB and placed on 4L NC due to some
agitation/discomfort. While on 4L NC, he became somnolent and
was placed on BiPap at which time an ABG was 7.23/93/113. He was
therefore intubated with succ and etomidate with a 7.5 ETT tube,
25 at the lip. He was sedated with propofol and given
solumedrol, nebs, and levofloxacin 750mg IV. An EKG showed TWI
in V3-V5 with first troponin of 0.01. CXR showed a possible RML
PNA. He is being admitted to the MICU for further treatment of
his hypercarbic respiratory failure. Just prior to transfer his
BP was noted to be 93/64 despite 2L NS bolus. Given his
hypotension, his propofol was changed to versed and fentanyl.
.
Of note, he has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for COPD
exacerbations over the past year. During his most recent
hospitalization, a CXR showed right basilar infiltrate and
possible retro-cardiac infiltrate.
.
Upon arrival to the floor, he is intubated and sedated. He is
unable to provide any additional history or ROS.

  IMAGING
============

CTA CHEST ([**2161-7-15**] 4:15 PM)
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute pulmonary embolism or thoracic aortic pathology
detected.
2. Unchanged severe emphysema.
3. Linear subpleural consolidation in the right upper lobe and
linear opacity in the left upper lobe, likely represent
atelectasis. However, superimposed infection cannot be ruled
out.
4. Multiple mediastinal lymph nodes, with cystic right hilar
lymph nodes,
have not enlarged since prior study.
5. Multiple pulmonary nodules in both lungs. The left lower lobe
pulmonary
nodules are slightly more conspicuous since the prior study of
[**2160-11-6**].  A followup chest CT in three months is
recommended for further evaluation of the same.
6. Right heart strain, likely secondary to the lung disease.

CHEST X-RAY [**7-27**]
FINDINGS: Hyperinflated lung, in keeping with known history of
COPD. There
is interval removal of feeding tube, and endotracheal tube.
Interval
improvement in aeration at the lung bases, with minimal
atelectasis at the
right lung base. Hilar, mediastinal, and cardiac silhouette
stable.
IMPRESSION:
1. No focal lung consolidation.
2. COPD.
3. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

RENAL ULTRASOUND [**7-28**]
FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 10.0 cm and the left kidney
measures 10.5 cm. A tiny simple cyst is seen in the interpolar
region of the right kidney measuring 1.0 x 0.7 x 0.9 cm. A
simple cyst is seen at the medial portion of the lower pole of
the left kidney measuring 5.2 x 4.5 x 4.0 cm. There is no
hydronephrosis and no stone or solid mass is seen in either
kidney. The pre-void bladder is moderately distended and
unremarkable. The prostate is enlarged with a volume of 72 cc.
IMPRESSION:
1. No hydronephrosis.
2. Simple bilateral renal cysts.
3. Enlarged prostate.


Brief Hospital Course:
65 year old man with h/o COPD, pulm HTN, schizophrenia admitted
with COPD exacerbation and respiratory failure, in improved
condition.
.
# COPD Exacerbation: Pt presented to the ED after his VNA noted
he was hypoxic to the 70s on his baseline O2 requirement of 2L
NC at nightime. Work-up showed no PE but did show RUL
conslidation. Patient was intubated on admission and had a
prolonged and very complicated course, with difficulty in
weaning off ventilator. Pt underwent a bronchoscopy given his
difficulty weaning with cultures showing stenotrophomonas. After
thorough discussions, patient was extubated and bridged with
BIPAP as needed, however required re-intubation for hypercarbia
and hypoxia. He was treated for HAP with Vanc/Cipro/Zosyn 8 day
course. After multiple attempts at weaning sedation and poor
progonsis, decision made to extubate on [**7-23**] and not to pursue
re-intubation. Patient was able to maintain adequate ventilation
and was transitioned to the medical floor. Patient was initially
treated with high dose steroids, transitioned to oral prednisone
with plan for slow taper by PCP upon outpatient [**Name9 (PRE) **]. Patient
placed on his home regimen of scheduled nebulizer treatments and
pulmonary toilet. At time of discharge, O2 sats > 92% on 2L NC.
.
# Acute kidney injury: After diarrheal episode, Creatinine
increased to 1.5 on [**7-27**], from 1.1 on [**7-26**] and baseline 0.7-0.8.
After fluid resuscitation, creatinine improved to 1.1 on
[**2161-7-28**]. Renal ultrasound [**2161-7-28**] shows simple cysts but no
hydronephrosis. At time of discharge, renal function was at
baseline.
.
# Tachycardia: Multifactorial in setting of critial illness,
frequent b-agonists, volume depletion and alternating periods of
sinus tachycardia and multifocal tachycardia. At time of
discharge, patient with HR in 90's and in sinus rhythm.
.
# Positive blood culture: Pt has positive cultures from [**7-19**]
which showed coag neg staph. Blood cultures have subsequently
been negative suggesting contaminated sample. Although patient
remained on linezolid, this was chosen for treatment of urinary
infection and not bacteremia.
.
# VRE Urine: In setting of hypotension and positive urinalysis,
found to have Vancomycin Resistant Enterococcus in urine culture
from [**7-19**]. Pt completed 7 day course of Linezolid and is
asymptomatic at time of discharge.
.
# GOALS OF CARE: Family meetings held throughout critical
illness,
