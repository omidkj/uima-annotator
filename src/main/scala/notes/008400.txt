Pertinent Results:
[**2148-12-5**] Intra-op TEE
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-50 %). The right ventricular cavity
is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. There
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.
POST CPB
1. Marginally improved biventricular systolci funjction with
background inotropic support (Epinephrine)
2. No change in valve structure and function
3. Intact aorta

Brief Hospital Course:
Catheterization revealed triple vessel disease and she was
referred for surrgery.  A CT scan of a pulmonary nodule was
obtained and the recommendation was for a 6month follow up.

Following a period of Plavix washout, the patient underwent
coronary artery bypass grafting x3 (Left internal mammary artery
graft to the left anterior descending, reverse saphenous vein
graft to the marginal branch and the posterior descending
artery) on [**12-5**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].See operative note fro details.

Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable and had weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support. She was transfused two units of blood for
post-operative anemia.  Plavix was given due to poor targets.
Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed
toward her preoperative weight.

The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further
recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued
without complication.  She did have a brief burst of rapid
atrial fibrillation which responded to IV Lopressor. She had
recurrent atrial fibrillatin and was started on amiodarone and
maintained sinus rhythm susequently

The patient was evaluated by the Physical Therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge
on POD 7 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was
healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The
patient was discharged home with VNA in good condition with
appropriate follow up instructions.
