[**2162-3-15**] CXR
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in
the aortic arch. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly
dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. There is mitral
leaflet flail of the P2 and P3 segments. An eccentric,
anteriorly directed jet of Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is
seen.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including phenyleprhine and was
in an intrinsic sinus rhythm. A well-seated mitral annuloplasty
ring is seen with normal leaflet motion and gradients (mean
gradient = 4 mmHg). There is no valvular systolic anterior
motion ([**Male First Name (un) **]). Trivial (normal for prosthesis) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Regional and global left ventricular
systolic function are normal. Right ventricular systolic
function is normal. Aortic contours are intact
post-decannulation.

[**2162-3-17**] CXR
Small bilateral pleural effusion is present new or newly
apparent since [**3-16**], but no pneumothorax following removal
of left pleural drain. Cardiomediastinal silhouette has a normal
post-operative appearance comparable to the size of the heart
pre-operatively. Thickening of the left upper posterior costal
pleural surface is probably related to prior chest trauma given
adjacent healed rib fractures.


[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4125**]ospital Course:
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 4143**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2162-3-10**] for further
management of his mitral valve regurgitation. He was worked-up
by the cardiac surgical service in the usual preoperative
manner. A dental consult was obtained for oral clearance for
surgery. An infected molar was identified and the recommendation
was to extract the tooth prior to his surgery. This was
performed on [**2162-3-13**] without complication and was subsequently
cleared for valve surgery. A urine culture showed leukocytes for
which ciprofloxacin was started. On [**2162-3-15**] Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 4143**] was
taken to the operating room where he underwent a mitral valve
repair using a 36mm annuloplasty band. Please see operative note
for details. Postoperatively he was taken to the cardiac
surgical intensive care unit for monitoring. Within 24 hours, he
awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. Beta blockade,
aspirin and a statin were resumed. On postoperative day one, he
was transferred to the step down unit for monitoring. Mr.
[**Name13 (STitle) 4143**] was gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight.
The physical therapy service was consulted for assistance with
his postoperative strength and mobility. He continued to make
steady progress and was discharged to home on POD #5.  He will
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] as an outpatient.
