service for hypotension. Outside records indicate that prior to
that the most recent hospitalization was at the [**Hospital3 13347**] for one and a half months from [**Month (only) 404**] to [**Month (only) 958**] of this

Physical Exam:
Physical exam on admission:
VS: 97.7  77  155/92  97%RA
CV: RRR
Pulm: decreased BS on L, otherwise clear
Abd: Soft, non-tender
Ext: WArm, well-perfused.

Pertinent Results:
MRSA positive on [**2103-10-31**]

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt had very long, complicated hospital course. Admitted on
[**2103-9-20**] for left upper lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node
dissection. Tolerated procedure well. Admitted to SICU post-op
for close respiratory monitoring, and close follow of
electrolytes secondary to chronic renal insufficiency from
lithium toxicity.

Neuro: Sedated and ventilated for much of SICU course. As pt was
extubated and gradually weaned off sedation, his psych
comorbidities emerged as a greater problem, and he eventually
needed a 1:1 sitter for behavioral safety. With the assistance
of the psychiatry service, pt was eventually returned to his
home regimen of psychiatric medications with appropriate
behavior and responses.

Resp: Tracheostomy placed [**9-24**] in anticipation of long-term
ventilation, with eventual decannulation as longer-term plan. Pt
frequently had thick, heavy secretions requiring bronchoscopic
cleanout several times. Eventually pt was better able to handle
his own secretions and could maintain near-normal saturations
with only intermittent suctioning by nursing staff.

FEN/GI: Nutritionally maintained through dobhoff feeds with
Promote feed. Eventually a PEG tube was placed as it was
anticipated pt would have poor swallow status, and would need
nutrition to recover appropriately from surgery. Due to his CRI,
his creatinine was closely monitored, and near the end of his
hospital stay he was changed to Nepro formula (from Promote) as
his K and Cr continued to rise. Pt at goal calories. Pt failed 2
video swallow evals, although on the second he showed
considerable improvement. It is likely that, as his mental
status continues to improve, his ability to coordinate swallow
instructions from therapists will further improve his swallow.

ID: Pt found to be MRSA positive by swab culture on [**10-31**], and
maintained on appropriate precautions. Treated with Zosyn on
course suggested by ID.
