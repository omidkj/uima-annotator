History of Present Illness:
79yo RH F h/o HTN who was in USOH this morning eating
breakfast when she experienced the acute onset of a severe,
left-sided headache. It then waxed and waned and was not a/w N/V
or neck stiffness. She noticed that she could not fully find all
of the words that she was looking for to describe what had
happened. She then noticed that, while looking at the newspaper,
she could not see the right side of it; nor could she make out
the words that she could see. She noticed no difficulty
understanding speech.

She went to an OSH and said that she "had a stroke". Head CT
found an ICH, she was loaded with dilantin 1g IV and transferred
here.

She denies weakness, numbness, diplopia, dysphagia, gait
disturbance or incoordination. No history of head trauma.

[**2155-9-28**] Non-Contrast Head CT:
FINDINGS:  There is a large predominantly intraparenchymal
hemorrhage in the left parietal, and bordering the left
occipital lobe as well.  It measures approximately 5.3 x 2.9 cm
in axial dimensions, but shows extension into the occipital
lobe.  There is a subarachnoid component and an associated
subdural tracking along the tentorium with extension into the
left lateral ventricle. There is mild-to-moderate surrounding
vasogenic edema, including effacement of sulci, but no minimal
shift of the midline structures. There is probably also a tiny
associated subdural along the left frontal convexity. The
osseous structures are unremarkable. Visualized paranasal
sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
IMPRESSION:  Large intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left
parietal and
occipital lobes, with intraventricular extension, and probable
small
subarchnoid and subdural components.

[**2155-9-28**] Chest PA, Lateral:
PA and lateral chest x-ray dated [**2155-9-28**] has no prior films for
comparison.  The heart is not enlarged.  The cardiomediastinal
silhouette is normal.  There is no pulmonary vascular
congestion.  The lung fields are hyperinflated and there is
flattening of the diaphragms.  There is no evidence of focal air
space opacification to suggest consolidation.  There is minimal
blunting of the bilateral costodiaphragmatic angles which may be
secondary to scarring.  There is no pneumothorax.
Calcifications are seen throughout the visualized aorta.
Surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence for infiltrate.
2.  Hyperinflated lungs with flattened diaphragms suggests COPD.


[**2155-9-28**] Non-Contrast Head CT:
Little change is seen compared to prior study.  Again noted is a

large predominantly intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left
parietal and
occipital regions.  Increase in surrounding hypodensity
consistent with edema is noted.  The subarachnoid components and
associated subdural tract along the tentorium, as well as small
amount of hyperdense material noted within the left lateral
ventricle are again seen.  Mass effect with sulcal effacement
and mass effect on the left lateral ventricle appear relatively
stable. Ventricular size appears unchanged.  Basal cisterns
remain patent. No additional shift of midline structures
identified.
IMPRESSION:  No significant change in large left
parietooccipital
intraparenchymal hemorrhage, with unchanged subarachnoid and
ventricular
components.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital and admitted
to the Neurological Intensive Care Unit. She was found to be
awake and alert and to have good motor strength, however, she
did have difficulties with word finding and a Rt visual field
cut. Non-contrast head CT on the day of admission revealed ICH
in the L occipital and parietal regions. There was also
subarachnoid and subdural blood. She was begun on Metoprolol for
BP control and begun on Dilantin for sz ppx.

On the second hospital day, the pt was febrile to 100.3 degrees
F. Repeat CT confirmed show no interval changes from the day
before. She was transferred to the Neurological [**Hospital1 **] from the
ICU. Upon transfer, the pt continued to have Rt visual field cut
and word finding difficulties. Otherwise, the pt was alert,
oriented, and able to understand what was said to her.

On [**2155-9-30**], the third hospital day, the pt's exam was
effectively unchanged. She was febrile to 100.6 deg F at 4AM.
The pt's UA was c/w UTI. She was begun on empiric Bactrim SS [**Hospital1 **]
x 3 days. Her Dilantin was discontinued and she was begun on
Keppra 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for sz ppx. She was afebrile during the day,
but again was febrile to 101.6 at 10 PM. She defervesced after
midnight.

On [**2155-10-1**], the pt's morning exam found her to be afebrile. She
continued to have naming difficulty. For example, she was unable
to name a pen, but was able to describe it as used for writing.
Her exam was otherwise unchanged. No symptoms of dysuria,
frequency, cough or fever/chills.
