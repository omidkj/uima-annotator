Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1899**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal Pain and Chest Pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Percutaneous cholecystostomy drainage

History of Present Illness:
64 year old woman with PMH CAD, DMII, HTN who two night ago had
some stomach pain and chest pain. She says that this pain was
sharp, in the center of her chest, with radiation into her right
arm. She says this pain is similar to the pain she experienced
when she has had heart attacks in the past. She endorsed nausea,
vomiting, as well as diaphoresis. Movement worsened the pain,
while staying still kept it stable. She vomited that night, in
addition to having diarrhea.
.
She was seen in LGH emergency hospital at 4/20 at 11:30 PM,
where she was found to have BP 99/72 HR 126, 18 98.9, and 100%
on 2 L. Her labs at that time were notable for TropI 5.5, CPK
[**2018**], WBC count of 13.5, HCT 35.8, and BUN/Cr of 26/1.33, with a
digoxin level of less than 0.02. EKG on admission at LGH showed
tachycardia, TWI in III, and LFB and poor R wave progression.
She was subsequently admitted to CCU at LGH with heparin gtt,
lopressor, ASA, Plavix, kept NPO for cath. They held liniopril
and lasix. The patient was given morphine and nitrates prn for
pain, and an abd u/s and echo were performed.

The ECHO per reprot showed EF 20% with mdoerate MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 88857**], it showed dilated LV LVEF estimated to be 20%.
Anteroapical and septal hypokinesis, severe. Inferior
hypokinesis, severe. moderately severe global RV hypokinesis.
Structually normal MV. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation
is present. Mild tricuspin reguritation. Mild PH, systolic 46
mmHg. Left atrium mildly dilated.
.
Cath report showed LAD 100%, Diagnoal OPen, LCx small 60-70%,
Open 2nd OM, RCA 70%.

Per discharge summary, the patient had a U/A and CXR which did
not explain any infectious process.
.
On admission to CCU, the patient was noted to be tahcycardic to
121, with BP 110/69.
.
On review of systems, she endorses a history of stroke, but
denies deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at
the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains. She endorse a cough
with dark brown sputum, with streaks of blood. She denies
hemoptysis, or bloody stools, but does say that her stools have
been black. She endorses recent fevers and chills. Patient
denies dysuria. BM x 2. She denies exertional buttock or calf
pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for the presence of
abdominal pain, the lack of dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,  but positive for ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope and presyncope.

IMAGING:
RUQ Ultrasound:
IMPRESSION:
1. Partially distended gallbladder, with circumferential wall
thickening that could be reactive. Please correlate with liver
function tests. If there is continued concern for acute
cholecystitis, HIDA scan could be ordered.
2. Prominent-appearing pancreatic duct, of uncertain etiology.
Please
correlate with prior imaging, or CT/MRCP if necessary.

CT abdomen/pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of intraabdominal or intrapelvic abscess, as
questioned.
2. Small amount of pericholecystic fluid identified, compatible
with findings seen on prior ultrasound exams.
3. Probable patency of the cystic duct, as suggested by the
normal caliber of the gallbladder on the CT scan in relation to
the collapsed size of the
gallbladder status post percutaneous aspiration performed on the
same day.
4. Small bilateral pleural effusions with evidence of
interstitial volume
overload.

EKG:
Sinus tachycardia. Consider inferior myocardial infarction. Low
limb lead
voltage. Late R wave progression with reversal in leads V2-V4.
Consider
anterior myocardial infarction. Since the previous tracing of
[**2111-4-10**] the
rate is faster. Ventricular premature beat is not seen.
Othewise, no change.



Brief Hospital Course:
64 year old female with PMH CAD s/p LAD and RCA stents, MI x 3,
DMII, HTN, PAD presenting with CP x2 nights, seen at OSH and
treated as NSTEMI and depressed EF (30-35% to 15-20%) with
unchanged coronary disease and significant abdominal pain,
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
# Decompensated CHF and coronary artery disease: The patient has
known sCHF, but noted to have a depressed EF to 15-20% from
30-35% per previous report from a year ago.  Even though her
cardiac enzymes were elevated, it seems unlikely to be an acute
ischemic cardiomyopathy, given that her most recent
catheterization findings were unchanged from those of previous
catheterizations.  She was diuresed effectively with
