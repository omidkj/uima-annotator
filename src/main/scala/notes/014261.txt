Admission Date:  [**2123-4-19**]       Discharge Date:  [**2123-4-20**]

Date of Birth:   [**2068-11-10**]       Sex:  F

Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]

REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Shortness of breath and wheezing.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 54-year-old woman with
a history of multiple medical problems and multiple
admissions, most significant of which is asthma with three
prior intubations and multiple hospital admissions, who now
presents with three days of cough and shortness of breath.
Until three days ago, the patient was doing fairly well and
was in her usual state of health.  Then, three days ago, she
initially developed a tender neck lymphadenopathy, right
greater than left, without a sore throat.  This then
progressed to a dry cough and then to a productive cough with
yellow sputum over the last 24 hours prior to admission.
This was accompanied by shortness of breath and increasing
wheezing requiring more frequent nebulizer use at home.  It
got to the point where she was requiring continuous nebs at
home.  She did not check peak flows at home.  She denies any
recent travel.  She does report [**Hospital Unit Name **] contacts regarding the
children with whom she works.  She does report positive
chills, but did not check any temps at home.  She has some
question of a history of aspiration, but denies any recent
aspiration events or aspiration precautions.  When her
wheezing and shortness of breath persisted, she came into the
ED.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Asthma with multiple admissions,
last admission [**2122-11-15**], three prior intubations.
Asthma is reportedly unresponsive to steroids in the past.
Last PFTs were in [**2115**] and showed a more restrictive lung
pattern.  2) Neurodegenerative demyelinating syndrome of
unclear etiology.  3) History of severe leg muscle spasms.
4) Labile hypotension, on Florinef, has reported history of
adrenal insufficiency.  5) Depression/anxiety.  6) History of
right IJ thrombus in [**2112**], status post anticoagulation x 6
months.  7) Recent history of IGG deficiency, had been on
high dose IGG until [**3-/2114**].  8) Status post appendectomy.  9)
Status post cholecystectomy.  10) Anemia consistent with
anemia of chronic disease.  She has a history of colonic
hyperplastic polyp in [**2111**].  11) Esophagitis.  12)
Dysphagia/aspiration, status post G-tube placement in [**2115**]
secondary to poor PO intake and aspiration.  She reportedly
had a swallowing eval in [**2122-10-16**] which showed a
moderate to severe dysphagia, but no frank aspiration.  13)
Hyperlipidemia.  14) Left breast papilloma in [**2118**], status
post excision and reconstructive surgery.  15) Osteoporosis.
16) Hypothyroidism.  17) Atypical chest pain.

ALLERGIES:  1) Azmacort which causes facial rash and
bronchospasm, 2) clindamycin, 3) fentanyl, 4) versed.

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM:  Vitals - temp 97, heart rate 91, BP
106/51, respiratory rate 16, O2 sat 100% on 5 liters nasal
cannula.  General - appears pale, thin, frail, with baseline
slow speech.  HEENT shows EOMI, anicteric sclerae, dry mucous
membranes, clear oropharynx.  Neck supple, with shotty
lymphadenopathy, right greater than left, in the anterior
cervical chain.  Heart is regular, no murmurs, rubs, or
gallops.  Lungs reveal diffuse wheezing bilaterally with
prolonged expiratory phase.  No accessory muscle use.  Fair
to restricted air movement.  Extremities without edema.  Dry
skin.  Pulses - 2+ distal bilaterally.

ADMISSION LABS:  WBC 17, hematocrit 39.5, platelets 446.
Chem-7 - sodium 135, K 3.0, chloride 100, bicarb 26, BUN 16,
creatinine 0.7, glucose 142.  UA with negative nitrite,
negative leukocyte esterase, 0 red blood cells, 0 white blood
cells, 0 bacteria.  Urine cultures and blood cultures were
drawn and pending.  EKG shows normal sinus, 78 beats per
minute, normal axis and intervals, normal R wave progression.
T wave inversion in III and AVL, but otherwise no acute ST
changes compared with prior survey from [**11-16**].  Arterial
blood gas 7.26/65/97.  Chest x-ray - no acute cardiopulmonary
process.

HOSPITAL COURSE - 1) ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS:  The patient
was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] where she continued
on continuous nebs initially. She received a single dose of
prednisolone in the ED, but she received no further doses of
such.  She improved from a respiratory standpoint with
nebulizer treatments, chest PT, and some mild to moderate
suctioning.  She was back at respiratory baseline by
[**2123-4-20**].  She did have a chest CT performed to search for
bronchiectasis given her history of aspiration in the past,
her history of neuromuscular disorder, and her old PFTs that
showed more of a restrictive rather than obstructive pattern.


2) RIGHT LOWER QUADRANT PAIN:  It was infrequent, and was not
accompanied by significant abdominal tenderness, fevers,
chills, nausea, diarrhea, melena or bright red blood per
rectum.  Her white count continued to improve since
admission.  She had undergone appendectomy and
cholecystectomy in the past.  Her LFTs, amylase and lipase
were all within normal limits.  It was felt that her symptoms
were most likely consistent with constipation, and she was
watched without further episodes of abdominal pain.

3) NEURODEGENERATIVE DEMYELINATING SYNDROME:  She was
continued on her baclofen and [**Year/Month/Day 102130**].

4) BLOOD PRESSURE:  The patient's blood pressure was low at
times with an episode of hypotension to the systolic blood
pressure of 70s.  This did come up with intravenous saline
boluses x 2.  She was continued on her Florinef during her
course here.  She does carry a diagnosis of adrenal
insufficiency from the past.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  DC to home.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Fair.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Acute respiratory distress secondary to
asthma.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSES:  1) Degenerative demyelinating syndrome.
2) Right lower quadrant abdominal pain.  3) Hypotension
related to adrenal insufficiency.  4) Anemia of chronic
disease.

DISCHARGE MEDS:  Same as meds on admission with the addition
of azithromycin 500 mg x 3-day course.

FOLLOW-UP:  Appointment with PCP, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD, on [**2123-4-22**].
