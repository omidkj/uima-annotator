Imaging:

CXR [**2-7**]: Cardiomegaly with left lower lobe airspace disease
likely
representing atelectasis and vascular crowding. However,
pneumonia cannot entirely be excluded.

Renal US [**2-7**]: Bilateral moderate hydronephrosis unchanged from
prior study.

Head CT ([**2-9**]): 1. Study limited by motion artifact. Within this
limitation, no acute hemorrhage, large vascular territory
infarction, or large mass seen.
2. Right Sylvian fissure hypodensity which may be volume
averaging; however, MRI is more sensitive for the detection of
small metastases or acute ischemia.
3. Probable chronic sinus disease.

Lower extrem US ([**2-9**]): Left peroneal, deep venous thrombosis,
likely acute.

CT abd/pelvis ([**2-9**]): 1. Progressive retroperitoneal
lymphadenopathy with vaguely defined soft tissue densities and
surrounding fat stranding, accounting for obstruction of each
ureter. The appearance is most suggestive of retroperitoneal
fibrosis associated with malignant lymphadenopathy and
infiltration.
2. Mostly stable appearance of bony metastatic disease noting
interval compression fractures apparently treated before with
vertebroplasty.
3. New pleural effusions with a small amount of ascites and
anasarca, a state of diffuse edema.

CTA ([**2-15**]):
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Findings consistent with congestive heart failure including
cardiomegaly, moderate dependent bilateral pleural effusions and
peribronchovascular and peripheral septal interstitial
thickening.
3. 5-mm left upper lobe p
