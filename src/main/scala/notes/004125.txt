Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopaedic surgery service.
Preoperatively the hip was aspirated to r/o infection. This was
negative for growth. Pre operative CXR was notable for
consolidation versus neoplasm.  Neoplasm was ruled out with a CT
scan. The patient   was taken to the operating room for above
described procedure. Please see separately dictated operative
report for details. The surgery was uncomplicated and the
patient tolerated the procedure well. Patient received
perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:

1. MICU Course:
-Patient was brought to ICU and extubated. Will need to continue
CPAP (patient uses at home) throughout hospitalization. The
patient's code status was discussed with family again and
patient made DNR/DNI 24 hours after surgery. Patient was
restarted on metoprolol and has been hemodynamically stable. PM
Hct 27.8.

2. Post-anemia due to blood loss
- POD Hct 23.1, asymptomatic. Transfused 2 units PRBCs due to
comorbidities.  At discharge, HCT was 27.1. INR 2.2. Goal is
less than 2.5 but greater than 1.5.

3. Pneumonia - Patient was noted to be somewhat fluid overloaded
and low O2 sats, Seen by medicine and started on IV ceftriaxone.
This is switched to cefpodoxime 400 mg [**Hospital1 **] x 5 more days upon
discharge. O2 sats were in 90's on RA upon discharge. Oxygen
discontinued. Internal medicine team felt patient was stable for
dischage on oral antibiotics.

Otherwise, pain was initially controlled with a PCA followed by
a transition to oral pain medications on POD#1.  The patient
received lovenox for bridging DVT prophylaxis starting on the
morning of POD#1 which was continued until the patient was
therapeutic on coumadin which he was taking at baseline.  The
foley was removed on POD#2 and the patient was voiding
independently thereafter. The surgical dressing was changed on
POD#2 and the surgical incision was found to be clean and intact
without erythema or abnormal drainage. The patient was seen
daily by physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout the
hospital course and repleted accordingly. At the time of
discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling
well.  The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The
patient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately
controlled on an oral regimen. The operative extremity was
neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign.

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as
tolerated on the operative extremity with posterior and
trochanter-off precautions (no active abduction). Walker at all
times for 6 weeks.
