History of Present Illness:
This is 42 year old female with history migraines recent dull
headache since [**2189-2-13**] that she states is at the bridge of her
nose.  The patient reports she was treated for a a sinus

patient proceeded to call 911 and was taken by EMS to [**Hospital 39437**] Hospital in [**Location (un) 5028**] where she had a CTA which was
consistent with cerebral aneurysm.  The patient was transferred
as a direct
admit to the TSICU for further management of her aneurysm by
Neurosurgery. Last night the patient states that she experienced
pain in her left eye that was worse when she attempted to open
it. Today, she is unable to open her left eye and has double

Final Report
HISTORY: Preoperative.

FINDINGS: No previous images. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged,
but there is
no evidence of vascular congestion. There is increased
opacification at the left base, consistent with atelectasis and
possible effusion. In the
appropriate clinical situation, the possibility of supervening
pneumonia
cannot be excluded.

coils.


Final Report
HISTORY: 42-year-old woman status post angio. Evaluate for
interval change.

COMPARISON: Images from angiography performed one day prior
([**2189-3-1**]). The patient underwent embolization/coiling the left
posterior
communicating artery.

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT was obtained.

FINDINGS: Streak artifact from the coils of the left posterior
communicating
artery limit evaluation at this level. Within this limitation,
there is no
intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of midline
structures or edema. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation is
normally preserved. The ventricles are normal in size and
configuration. Basal cisterns are symmetric.

There is left maxillary mucosal thickening. Visualized paranasal
sinuses are otherwise normally aerated. The mastoid air cells
are pneumatized
bilaterally.

IMPRESSION: Status post left posterior communicating artery
coiling,
resulting in streak artifact. No intracranial hemorrhage.






Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to neurosurgery and went to INR where she
underwent angiogram with coiling of left PComm aneurysm.  She
was then transferred to ICU and monitored closely.  Post op she
continued to be alert and oriented with left cranial nerve
palsies of III and IV. She was seen in consultation by
Hepatology as patient is on the transplant list at [**Hospital3 2358**].
Opthalmology was consulted for her left cranial nerve IV palsy
and believes it is not a true palsy and shoudl regain function.
PT cleared her safe for home but will be d/c with home safety
eval. She did have episodes of bigeminy and electrolytes were
repleated and will monitor.

Her exam remained sta
