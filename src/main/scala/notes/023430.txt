Surgeon:  [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], [**MD Number(1) 4158**]

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Left proximal humerus fracture.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Left proximal humerus fracture.

PROCEDURE:  Left proximal humerus hemiarthroplasty.

INDICATIONS:  Mrs. [**Known firstname 4159**] [**Known lastname 4160**] is a 69-year-old female patient
with a complex medical history including end-stage renal
disease on dialysis, diabetes. She fell approximately 4 to 6
weeks ago, sustaining a two-part proximal humerus fracture
that has not healed. Over the last 2 weeks of her medical
admission to manage respiratory issues, it was noted that the
flow from her arterial venous fistula which is on the injured
side of her extremity was deficient.  An angiogram was
obtained which demonstrated the presence of the humerus
fracture. It is unclear when this fracture occurred,
presumably it could have occurred during transportation given
that the patient has no history of falling. The fracture was
significantly displaced, and
significantly angulated. The patient received alternative
hemodialysis access and the left upper extremity fistula was
left at this point unused in preparation for possible surgery
to address the humerus fracture. the patient has so far not
 develop any healing
or callus on films. I think this is not unusual given her
medical
history and
believe a repair of this 2-part humerus fracture would
probably result in a non [**Hospital1 **] and I therefore believe that the
approach to address her fracture instability surgically is to
perform a hemiarthroplasty. The family agrees and she now
presents for procedure.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought to the
operating room and after the successful induction of general
anesthesia was placed in the beach-chair position. The left
upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile
manner. Via the deltopectoral approach, the fracture was
exposed. There was significant soft tissue  scarring but no
callous and there was good lateral
perfusion on the soft tissues which bleed considerably. This
is secondary to the presence of the fistula nearby.
Hemostasis was achieved with [**Last Name (un) 4161**] electrocautery. The
deltopectoral interval was found and the fracture was
exposed. The humeral head, lesser tuberosity and greater
tuberosity were osteotomized and preserved and the remaining
head was removed. The canal was exposed and reamed and
broached to accept a 12 mm Osteonics humeral prosthesis. A 21
mm humeral head was then selected and was found to give
appropriate fit and range of motion. At this point, the canal
was irrigated. The final components were then brought to the
field and cemented with one bag of PMMA cement. The final
components were assembled and the lesser tuberosity and
greater tuberosity were repaired over the prosthesis using
the threaded holes in the prosthesis.  The wound was
copiously irrigated and closed in layers with 0 PDS and 2-0
nylon over a drain. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1005**] was present for the entire
procedure. All counts of sponges and instruments were
correct. C arm imaging was used at the end of the procedure to
establish the appropriate height and anatomy was restored.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to
recovery room without incident. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1005**] was present for
the entire procedure.

CT head ([**11-2**]):

FINDINGS: There is no acute intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage or
shift of normally midline structures. The ventricles, cisterns
and sulci are somewhat prominent, likely due to atrophic
changes. Again identified are scattered hypodensities within the
subcortical white matter consistent with small vessel ischemic
disease. A small area of decreased attenuation is identified
within the right basal ganglia consistent with prior lacunar
infarction, unchanged from prior studies. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation appears preserved. There has been interval
opacification of the mastoid air cells bilaterally. There is
minimal thickening of the right maxillary sinus. The visualized
soft tissues appear unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: No acute hemorrhage. Evidence of chronic small
vessel ischemic disease as well as prior lacunar infarcts,
unchanged.

[**11-8**] CT abd/pelvis
69 year old woman with diffuse, persistent abdominal pain, s/p
PEA arrest, elevated lactate
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please evaluate for mesenteric ischemia - angiogram protocol
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Diffuse persistent abdominal pain status post PEA
arrest with elevated lactate. Concern for mesenteric ischemia.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Tiny (2 mm)
nodule seen within the left lower lobe, not clearly visualized
at the time of the previous CT examinations. The visualized
portions of the heart and pericardium appear unremarkable. The
liver, spleen, and adrenal glands appear unremarkable.
Gallbladder contains a calcified stone in layering calcium
consistent with milk of calcium. There is stranding about the
inferior aspect of the pancreas within the mesenteric root. The
aorta is normal in caliber with mural calcifications consistent
with atheromatous disease. The kidneys appear atrophic
bilaterally. The large and small bowel loops are normal in
caliber. There is mucosal thickening within a short segment of
cecum. No other areas of abnormal bowel wall thickening are
identified. There is no free intraperitoneal air and no free
fluid within the abdomen. There is no pathologic appearing
mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The bladder,
distal ureters, rectum and sigmoid colon appear unremarkable.
There are uterine calcifications. The uterus and adnexa appear
otherwise unremarkable. There is no pathologic appearing pelvic
or inguinal lymphadenopathy. There is diffuse stranding within
the subcutaneous tissues of the left buttock and right buttock
to a slightly less prominent degree. Multiple calcifications are
seen within the soft tissues of t
