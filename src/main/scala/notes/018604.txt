Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
NSTEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
left femoral to posterior tibial artery bypass
left below knee amputation

History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 83 y.o male with h.o CAD, s/p CABG [**2103**], HTN, PVD,
COPD, CHF, who presented to [**Hospital3 **] with difficulty ambulating
d/t PVD. There, he developed rapid aflutter and was noted to
have NSTEMI with elevated biomarkers. Stress test showed
reversible ischemia (anterior and inferior walls). Cards there
did not feel comfortable cathing the pt with PVD. Pt noted to
have NSVT-short runs. He was noted to have ABI 0.54 on R and
0.56 on Left. B/L foot "ischemia noted" L>R.
.
Pt reports chronic "angina" L.chest/neck/back/L.arm pain ~[**6-10**]
days that is not accompanied by SOB/LH/palp/diaphoresis or
nausea. He states that he takes a nitro this relieves his pain.
HE denies any increase in severity of symptoms prior to [**Hospital3 **]
admit. In addition, he denies any CP while hospitalized.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for current absence of
chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
CXR (portable AP) [**2117-1-15**]: No evidence of pneumonia.
.
CT head w/o contrast [**2117-1-15**]: Limited CT due to patient motion;
however, no acute pathology identified. If clinical concern for
ischemia persists, an MRI with DWI is more sensitive.
.
ECHO [**2117-1-27**] - Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is mild to moderate global left
ventricular hypokinesis with relative preservation of apical
function (LVEF = 35 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2115-1-14**],
biventricular systolic function is more depressed and the
severity of mitral regurgitation (previously minimal on review)
is increased. Right ventricular free wall hypokinesis is also
now apparent.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 83 y.o male with h.o CAD s/p CABG, HTN, PVD, DM, COPD,
CKD, CHF, chronic thrombocytopenia who presented to OSH with
weakness, was found to have afib Vs. flutter, NSTEMI, reversible
defect on PMIBI and transferred for possible cath.
.
# Coronary Artery Disease: Per last catherization, the patient
has severe native 3-veseel disease, patent LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM, 90%
[**Year (4 digits) **] ostial lesion, diffusely diseased RCA with 85% lesion and
patent SVG-RPDA. stenting of SVG-RCA [**2115-1-14**]. Pt had cardiac
enzyme elevations at OSH, likely [**3-9**] demand ischemia in the
setting of rapid Aflutter. PMIBI showed anterior/inferior
reversible perfusion defects. The interventional cardiology team
felt that there was no indication for PCI. Enzymes continued to
trend down. Continued aspirin, Plavix, beta blocker, statin,
Imdur.  However, on [**1-27**] the patient had an second NSTEMI 3
days post-op with resulting Hypotension.  He was transferred to
the CCU for further management.  PCI again was not thought to be
an option for this patient based on his previous cath results.
He was managed medically on a heparin drip.  He remained
hypotensive requiring pressors.  Discussions with the patient's
family were held on on [**1-28**] and they decided to change his code
status to DNR/DNI based on his wishes.  Later in the day on
[**1-18**], he became acutely bradycardic to the 30s, requiring
atropine, and had profound hypotension not reponding to maximum
dose of 3 pressors.  The patient's EKG showed ST elevations in
V1-V2 with an new LBBB; the patient cath images and EKGs were
again reviewed and cath was not felt to be an option.  The
patient was made comfortable and he passed away with his family
by his side at 5:30pm.
.
# PVD/gangrene: Patient with bilateral peripheral vascular
disease who was admitted with with dry gangrene of left 2nd and
3rd toes. ABI's ~.50 bilaterally. Vascular surgery was
consulted, and the patient was transferred to the vascular
surgery service.  Angiography indicated a femoral to posterior
tibial bypass was a resonable option.  Patient was taken to the
OR on [**2117-1-21**] and he underwent left common femoral to posterior
tibial artery bypass with PTFE. Patient tolerated the procedure
well, recovered in the PACU then transferred back to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 5
VICU. On [**2117-1-24**] patient was going through lower extremity
bypass pathway, was found to have lost pulse signals on the
operative side, since this was a PTFE bypass and without bypass
option, option of LBKA was discussed with patient and family
which they agreed. Patient underwent a left BKA on [**2117-1-25**] and
tolerated the procedure well without complication.
