CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2123-10-31**] 3:39 PM
PA and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate interval
removal of the left-sided chest tube seen on [**2123-10-28**]. The
remaining support lines have been removed as well. There are
small bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax. The patient
is status post median sternotomy. Trachea is midline. There is
bibasilar atelectasis.
IMPRESSION:
Bibasilar effusions and atelectasis. No pneumothorax

TEE
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast is
seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No
thrombus/mass
is seen in the body of the left atrium. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen
in the body of the right atrium. A left-to-right shunt across
the interatrial
septum is seen at rest. A small secundum atrial septal defect is
present. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is
top normal/borderline dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is
moderately depressed. . Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion
are normal. There are simple atheroma in the aortic root. There
are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three
aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is mild
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate thickening
of the mitral
valve chordae. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen with a
vena
contracta width of .56 cm. . The mitral regurgitation jet is
eccentric. There
is no pericardial effusion.
Mitral annulus was measured to be 2.7 cm in the transcommissural
view and > 3
cm. in the anteroposterior axis. The C-[**Month (only) **]. distance was 2.6 cm
and [**Doctor Last Name **]/PL
ratio > 1.5 in the ME window at 135 degrees.

POST CPB:

Improved global left ventricular systolic function with
inotropic support
(Epinephrine) and the ejection fraction is approximately 40-50%


There is an annuloplasty ring in the mitral position. Well
seated and
mechanically stable. Trace valvular regurgitation. Mean gradient
across the
mitral vlave is 5.5 mm hg and the mitral valve area by PHT
method was
calculated to be 2.92 cm2. Aortic valve area was calculated by
planimetry to
be 1.4 cm2. By planimetry.
There was no left ventricular outflow tract gradient.
No other change.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 30929**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2123-10-28**] for surgical
management of her coronary artery and mitral valve disease. She
was taken directly to the operating room where she underwent
coronary artery bypass grafting to three vessels and a mitral
valve repair using a 26mm annuloplasty band. Please see
operative note for details. Postoperatively she was taken to the
intensive care unit for monitoring. By postoperative day one,
Ms. [**Known lastname 30929**] was awake, extubated and neurologically intact. Beta
blockade, a statin and aspirin were resumed. She was then
transferred to the step down unit for further recovery. She was
gently diuresed towards her preoperative weight. The physical
therapy service was consulted for assistance with her strength
and mobility. As her diet improved, her oral diabetic agents
were resumed. She had atrial fibrillation which was treated with
beta blockade and repletion of her electrolytes. She was
anticoagulated with coumadin for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Ms. [**Known lastname 30929**] continued to make steady progress and was discharged
home on postoperative day 6. She will follow-up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], her cardiologist and her primary care physician as an
outpatient. Plan for INR to be checked [**11-5**] with results to Dr
[**Last Name (STitle) 3321**] for continued management with a goal INR 2-2.5.
