Chief Complaint:
Cellulitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2129-7-29**]: Removal of distal phalanx tuft third digit and
debridement of ulcerations sub-second and third digits


History of Present Illness:
62 yo F w/ poorly controlled DM II on insulin (last Hga1c~ 9.4
in [**2127**], baseline BG ~300s), HTN, obesity who p/w bilateral foot
wounds, R>L, which have been getting worse X 2-3 weeks. Pt
reports that the problem began without any particular incident
as has failed to improve with conservative treatment (resting,
soaks) at home. She presented to the ED today because the
situation simply wasn't improving. She reports she's never had
foot problems before and believes that the sensation in her feet
is fully intact. The pt endoresis mild chills, but has noted noo
fever. She denies nausea, malaise, CP or SOB.
.
In the ED, her VS were Tc: 99.3 HR: 98 BP: 146/80 RR:18 P02: 93%
on RA. Her labs were notable for a glucose of >770 and no anion
gap. A foot ap/lat XRay was performed that showed right third
distal phalynx bone changes c/w early osteomyelitis. She was
administered empiric Unasyn and Vancomycin for broad and MRSA
coverage, and was started on an insulin gtt. Bedside I&D was
performed. The pt was admitted to the MICU for glycemic control
with a plan for surgical intervention by podiatry in the AM.
.
At home, the pt reports she checks her sugar regularly and takes
her insulin as directed. She routinely measures sugars ranging
from the 50s to the >500. When her sugar is very high she does
not some mild visual field "spots" though she is not having this
symptom now.
.
ROS: The pt reports a 15lb unintentional weight loss over the
last several months. She has also noted urinary frequency but no
urgency or dysuria. Otherwise no nausea, vomiting, abdominal
pain, diarrhea, constipation, melena, hematochezia, chest pain,
shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND, DOE, lower extremity
oedema, lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness, focal weakness,
vision changes, headache, rash or skin changes.

   WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2129-8-1**]):
      Due to mixed bacterial types (>=3) an abbreviated workup
is
      performed; P.aeruginosa, S.aureus and beta strep. are
reported if
      present. Susceptibility will be performed on P.aeruginosa
and
      S.aureus if sparse growth or greater..
      STAPH AUREUS COAG +.    MODERATE GROWTH.
         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.

Brief Hospital Course:
 61 yo female with severe hyperglycemia and diabetic foot
infection.
.
# Foot infection: Patient presented with an infection in her
right foot.  Patient was placed on Vancomycin and Zosyn for the
infection, given oxycodone for her pain, and podiatry was
consulted.  On [**7-29**], Podiatry debrided the wound and
removed the distal portion of her third toe.  Her wound was
closed two days later. The patient had a leukocytosis to 22
following the procedure, this resolved to 13.6 on the day of her
discharge.  A culture of the wound and tissue were sent and
revealed Enterococcus, Staph. Aureus, and no anaerobes.  Patient
was placed on Bactrim and Augmen
