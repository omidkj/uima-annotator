Brief Hospital Course:
Hypotension: This was most likely [**3-9**] extreme hypovolemia in the
setting of an alcohol binge cominbed with taking his home BP
meds.  He improved after 8 liters of IVF and an overnight stay
in the MICU.  There was concern for underlying infection in the
MICU given that his Lactate was initially elevated however it
trended down and he never manifested infection.  Given his
history of MI cardiac etiology was ruled out by his fluid
responsiveness, EKG without ischemic changes, and negative CEs.
His tachycardia abruptly improved on [**2190-1-7**] and his pressures
stabilized in the low 110's.  He eventually tolerated the
readition of his home carvedilol.  The rest of his home BP meds
were held pending follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 74485**].  We would
recomend maximizing his beta-blocker and ace inhibitor over
smaller doses of ACE, Beta and Spi, but we leave this up to Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 74485**].

?increased work of breathing - On [**1-7**] Mr [**Known lastname **] complained of
increased work of breathing and was noted to be diaphoretic. PE
was ruled out given his low-probability (INR 1.8 and receiving
sq heparin.), and his D-Dimer returned at <150. PNA was another
concern though his very thorough PA/Lateral [**Location (un) 1131**] shows no
signs of PNA. Flash pulmonary edema was also of concern though
his exam and cxr were not concerning for this.  His original MI
presented partly as SOB however his cardiac enzymes remain flat
and his EKG is unchanged.  At this point anxiety was the most
likely source for his symptomology and it had resolved by [**1-8**]
.
ETOH: He received a banana bag in the ED and apparently cleared
mentally while there.  He never required a single dose of ativan
on his CIWA.  He was initially resistant to seeing a social
worker though did agree and is currently very motivated to stop
drinking.
.
HCT DROP: A 6 point HCT drop was noted from admission and
remained stable throughout the stay.  This was likely dilutional
given large volume fluid repletion.  We also assessed his
folate, B12, Iron and retics to expedite his outpatient work-up
.
CAD/CHF: He has had an MI diagnosed at [**Hospital1 3278**] [**7-14**] with reduced
EF, and without revascularization. ACEI and spironolactone were
held for hypotension.  We did reintroduce his carvedilol and
continued his home Simvastatin 40 and ASA.  We continued his
home warfarin for his history of ?LV thrombus.  He will
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 74485**] shortly to restart these meds.
.
6. DMII: Finger sticks were in the 200s here. We kept him on
insulin sliding scale in house, and eventually restarted his
glyburide.  He can restart his metformin at home.
