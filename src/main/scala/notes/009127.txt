Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 57-year-old male with
a history of seizure disorder and coronary artery disease,
who was brought into the [**Hospital1 69**]
Emergency Room on [**2189-4-1**] secondary to confusion.
Patient was reportedly found on the street in a confused and
disoriented state by emergency medical technicians and
subsequently brought to [**Hospital1 69**]
for further evaluation and management.  In the Emergency
Department, the patient was noted to be disoriented and
confused with a CPK of 5712 and a [**Hospital1 **] of 20.

Patient's electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia at
112, inferior lead Q waves, and mild ST depression in lead
V5.  In addition, the patient was noted to have an [**Hospital1 **]
white blood cell count of 17.4, but was noted to be afebrile
and hemodynamically stable.  The patient continued to have
waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status in the Emergency Department,
after which point he received head CT scan which was negative
and a lumbar puncture which demonstrated 560 red blood cells
and 1 white blood cell.  Due to the patient's [**Doctor Last Name **] CK and
[**Doctor Last Name **], Cardiology consult was obtained in the Emergency
Department.

A bedside echocardiogram was performed, which demonstrated
hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of approximately 30%
and 2+ mitral regurgitation.  Initial Cardiology
recommendations advised conservative management with a beta
blocker, but no Heparinization given the patient's lumbar
puncture results.

While in the Emergency Department, the patient's mental
status was noted to improve gradually.  Although the patient
reported having no memory of the days events, he did report
being under a fair amount of increased stress over the past
several days secondary to his car being stolen and him
running out of his standard home medications.  The patient
was subsequently admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
team for further evaluation and management.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives alone.  Works as a postal worker.
Reports a remote history of alcohol abuse, but states the
last drink was in [**2170**].  Denies any other history of drug
abuse.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit team under the direction of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Name (STitle) **] on [**2189-4-2**].  Given the patient's
presenting symptoms and his lumbar puncture results, a
neurosurgical consult was obtained and the patient was
referred for head MRI/MRA which subsequently demonstrated no
gross structural abnormalities and no evidence of infarction
or intracranial enhancement.

Over the course of the hospital day #1, the patient's mental
status was noted to improve tremendously, and the patient was
noted to be fully oriented to person, place, and time.  The
patient subsequently stated that he would like to be
discharged immediately; however, following discussions with
case management and primary team, the patient was convinced
to remain in-house for the duration of his medical workup.

Given the patient's negative head scan and markedly improved
mental status with little intervention, the leading diagnosis
for his acute mental status change was believed to be a
postictal state.  The patient was subsequently restarted on
his outpatient seizure and Parkinson's medications to good
effect.  In addition, a Psychiatry consultation was obtained
who deemed the patient mentally competent, but described him
as exhibiting impaired judgement from his recently altered
mental status.  The patient was subsequently advised to
remain on an one-to-one sitter for risk of elopement, and
Ativan standing dosage was recommended given the potential
for the patient to go into benzodiazepine withdrawal.

The patient continued to progress well clinically through
hospital day #2, at which point he was cleared for transfer
to the regular medical floor, and was admitted to the [**Hospital **]
Medical Service.  While on the floor, the patient
demonstrated several episodes of acute shortness of breath
and tachypnea subsequently ascribed to transient panic
attacks that the patient stated were consistent with his
normal baseline.

On [**2189-4-3**], the patient underwent a repeat
echocardiogram, which demonstrated severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis with an estimated ejection fraction
of 25% and 4% mitral regurgitation.  The patient subsequently
recommended for a cardiac catheterization, which he underwent
on [**2189-4-6**], which subsequently demonstrated three vessel
coronary artery disease with 70% proximal irregular stenosis
of the left anterior descending artery, total occlusion of
the circumflex, and total occlusion of the proximal right
coronary artery.  In addition, the patient's cardiac
catheterization demonstrated moderate right ventricular
diastolic dysfunction, severe left ventricular diastolic
dysfunction, moderate primary pulmonary hypertension, and a
depressed cardiac index of 1.8.

Given these findings, a Cardiac Surgery consultation was
obtained.  Following a discussion of the relative risks and
benefits of surgical intervention, the patient subsequently
consented to undergo a coronary artery bypass graft and
mitral valve repair to take place on [**2189-4-8**].  On [**2189-4-8**], the patient therefore underwent a coronary artery
bypass graft using anastomosis from the LIMA to the LAD, and
a mitral annuloplasty using a 28 mm [**Doctor Last Name 405**] ring.  In
addition, an intra-aortic balloon pump was inserted via the
patient's right femoral artery.  The patient tolerated the
procedure well with a bypass time of 122 minutes and a
cross-clamp time of 79 minutes.

Patient's pericardium was left open; lines placed included an
arterial line, Swan-Ganz catheter, CVP catheter, and IAVP;
both ventricular and atrial wires were placed; mediastinal
and right and left pleural tubes were placed
intraoperatively.  The patient was subsequently transferred
to the CSRU, intubated, further evaluation and management.
On transfer, the patient's mean arterial pressure was 80, his
CVP was 19, his ......... was 15 and his [**Doctor First Name 1052**] was 25.  The
patient was A-V paced at a rate of 100 beats per minute.
Drips on transfer included milrinone, epi, and propofol.

In the CSRU, the patient's IAVP remained in place through
postoperative day #2, at which point it was removed without
complication.  The patient demonstrated a gradual respiratory
wean, and was finally successfully extubated on postoperative
day #3 without complication.  Patient was subsequently
advanced to regular oral intake, which he tolerated well
through the duration of his stay.

On postoperative day #4, the patient's PA catheter, pacer
wires, and chest tube were removed without complication, and
on postoperative day #5, the patient was cleared for transfer
to the floor.  The patient was subsequently admitted to the
Cardiothoracic Service in the direction of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**].

On the floor, the patient progressed well clinically through
the time of his discharge.  Physical Therapy consultation was
obtained, and the patient was cleared for discharge to home
following resolution of his acute medical issues.  The
patient demonstrated several additional episodes of anxiety
attacks through the course of his time on the regular patient
floor, all of which responded well to Ativan administration.
Patient's Foley catheter was subsequently removed without
complication.  He was noted to ............... productive of
urine for the duration of his stay.

On postoperative day #6, a routine chest radiograph
demonstrated evidence of a left basilar infiltrate versus
atelectasis; the patien
