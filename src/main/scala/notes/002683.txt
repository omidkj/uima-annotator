Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
65 yo F with h/o AF, diastolic HF, pulm HTN, chronic pain on
narcotics and other medical issues admitted through the ED
because of altered mental status and respiratory distress.
.
Per patient, she awoke this AM with urgency to have bowel
movement. Tried to stand and fell because she was weak. She
lying on her knees for some time (unclear total time). Pt hit
head on ground however did no LOC. Remembered whole event.
Called EMS who brought pt to [**Hospital1 **]-N. Was given 2mg of narcan for
unresponsiveness. Head/Neck CT was apparently completed and was
reported negative. She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation. Utox was negative
.
Of note, patient was reported had a similar event a few weeks
ago which was thought to be been caused by an accidental
overdose of oxycodone.
.
In [**Hospital1 18**] [**Name (NI) **], pt was evaluated however given AMS, pt was admitted
to ICU for further work-up. Prior to transfer, pt was given
ceftriaxone. In ICU, patient appeared lethargic but answered
questions appropriately.

CT head
FINDINGS: No hemorrhage, large territorial infarction, edema,
mass, or shift of normally midline structures is present. There
is evidence of mild sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic
disease in bihemispheric subcortical and periventricular white
matter. The ventricles and sulci are appropriate size and
configuration for age. The basal cisterns are widely patent. The
visualized paranasal sinuses are well aerated. No fractures or
soft tissue hematomas.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
.
EKG:  [**2184-9-12**] Atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular
response. Q-T interval prolongtion. ST-T wave abnormalities.
Since the previous tracing of [**2184-8-23**] the rate is slower and
aberrantly conducted beats are no longer seen.
.
[**2184-9-14**] CXR:
Pulmonary vascular congestion and dilated mediastinal veins are
unchanged since [**9-12**], but severe cardiomegaly has improved
and mild pulmonary edema persists. The heterogeneity of
opacification in the lungs could obscure discrete pulmonary
nodules. It is strongly recommended that conventional
radiographs be obtained to make sure that what appear to be
discrete opacities are instead asymmetric edema rather than
nodules.
.
[**2184-9-16**] CXR:
Vascular congestion has almost completely resolved. Cardiomegaly
is stable.  There are no large lung nodules. Opacity in the left
mid lung is consistent with fluid in the fissure. There are
moderate degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.

Of note, the interpretation of this radiograph is limited due to
technique and apical lordotic view in the frontal radiograph.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of atrial
fibrillation, diastolic dysfunction, found down at home and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with hyponatremia and altered, both of
which quickly resolved in the MICU. The patient has been
transferred to Medicine for likely placement in rehabilitation
given her failure after just a few hours at home.
.
# Altered mental status: The patient's mental status appears to
have cleared by the time of her transfer to Medicine from the
MICU. The original differential diagnosis included
medication-related v. head trauma v. hyponatremia (and
dehydration with diarrhea) v. infection. Head trauma ruled out
by CT. No sign of infection on imaging and labs. Hyponatremia
cleared fairly quickly with normal saline. The patient may also
have used too much of her dual nodal agents, which led to
bradycardia and poor perfusion. The patient's clonazepam was
also stopped. Medication and low sodium, possibly together, the
lead suspects for her altered mental status. The patient's
mental status has been appropriate during her entire Medicine
stay.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: The patient originally had bradycardia,
which may have been related to incorrect medication use of her
dual nodal agents. The bradycardia resolved in the MICU. On the
medicine floor, she instead became tachycardic. The patient had
an episodes of poor rate control, for which she received IV
metoprolol and diltiazem. The patient also had two episodes of
symptomatic atrial fibrillation (shortness of breath), during
which she had adequate blood pressure to uptitrate her nodal
blockers. Control of her rate finally occurred with metoprolol
50mg TID and diltiazem 90mg QID. The patient was kept on
dabigatran for stroke prevention.
.
# Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count jumped to
11.6. She was not febrile, but she did sound more rhonchorous on
physical exam on [**2184-9-14**]. The patient's white count resolved on
Wednesday, [**9-15**]. No more rhonchi by [**2184-9-16**]. Urine
culture not suggestive of infection. X-ray not suggestive of
consolidation. By discharge, leukocytosis had resolved.
.
# Possible lung nodules: The radiologist [**Location (un) 1131**] the patient's
chest X-ray, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], was concerned for possible lung nodules.
Given her vascular congestion, however, possible nodules cannot
be seen. Diuresis with furosemide was continued. The patient
should have follow up X-ray to examine for nodules, although a
final X-ray did not show any nodules.
