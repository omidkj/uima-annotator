Chief Complaint:
Transferred for subdural hematoma

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
88 y/o man who lives alone, on warfarin for afib, fell 2 weeks
ago and then 4 days ago (3 d pta) at home, hit head, presented
to OSH c/o HA, N, V found to have Rt. SDH without midline shift.
Of note, pt. had self - d/c'd his warfarin 6 days pta d/t
hemoptysis. He also related that he had a "head cold" for the
week pta. Transferred here for further evaluation. On arrival
here, CT head revealed acute on chronic SDH (multiple densities
of blood) 7 mm in greatest dimension, no midline shift. He was
given Vitamin K in the ED for INR 1.3. He was evaluated by NSx.
and admitted to the SICU for q 1 hour neuro exams. His repeat CT
head 12 h later demonstrated stability of the SDH. Repeat head
CT x 2 also did not show any interval change. Incidentally, he
had a CXR which showed a large Rt ML vs. RLL mass. CT of the
chest showed this to be a large RLL mass with necrotic
components, mediastianal LAD, pleural thickening with plaques
(asbestosis), and ? other hepatic and renal cysts and ? adrenal
nodule. He had CT torso with and without contrast (pre hydration
and mucomyst ordered by NS) for staging. He also spiked a fever
to 101 at 11 pm on the evening of admission, and urine and blood
cultures were obtained (UA neg).  Due to fever, change in mental
status suggestive of delirium, and the lack of ongoing
neurosurgical issues, he was transferred to the medicine service
for further management.

Notable imaging:

CT head [**11-6**]:
1. 7-cm right lower lobe mass, highly suspicious for malignancy
(possibly Large Cell Carcinoma) with adjacent pleural thickening
but no evidence of chest wall invasion. Enlarged right hilar and
mediastinal lymph nodeas suggest involvement. PET/CT is
recommended for staging. Indeterminate adrenal lesions can also
be assessed at that time.

2. Interlobular and bronchovascular thickening with ground glass
change may represent CHF or chronic diffuse interstitial
disease, but lymphangitic spread of tumor is not excluded.

3. Asbestos related pleural plaques.

4. Low attenuation lesion near the base of the liver and in the
right kidney are not completely characterized on this study but
may represent simple cysts.

head CT [**11-6**] : Stable appearance of the head compared to the
exam of 12 hours prior.

[**11-7**] head ct: Stable interval appearance of this head CT scan.

CXR: 9- x 8.5- x 8.1-cm mass-like density within the right lower
lobe. A chest CT is recommended for further evaluation.

CT torso:
IMPRESSION: CT of the torso demonstrating:

1. Large necrotic right lower lobe mass. This is combined with
bilateral adrenal lesions strongly suggestive of primary lung
carcinoma in particular squamous cell carcinoma. There is
associated mediastinal adenopathy as described above.

2. Other incidental findings such as hepatic and renal simple
cysts bladder wall thickening.


Brief Hospital Course:
#. SDH - Patient experience fall while on coumadin and presented
to OSH with headache, nausea and vomiting. Transferred here to
SICU for management of SDH. Since admission, patient has had two
stable head CTs with no midline shift or interval changes. When
transferred to floor, pt was very somnolent and lethargic, but
today he is alert and awake. Still not oriented to place and
date. Patient started on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis and
will need to be on this medication until his neurosurgery
follow-up which will have to be coordinated when he leaves [**Hospital **]. We held all coumadin and aspirin given bleed and
have been giving vitamin k to bring down his INR. Goal SBP
should be below 150. He was on IV antihypertensives because he
was too lethargic to take po, but was switched to oral
metoprolol and hydralazine today since he is awake and taking
food by mouth. He passed speech and swallow eval, but needs
supervision while eating.
.
#. RLL mass - CT torso for staging done and there is large
necrotic mass in RLL along with b/l adrenal lesions suggesting
primary lung CA. Also see assoc mediastinal adenopathy and
hepatic and renal simple cysts. Patient had pulmonary consult
and they reccommended CT guided biopsy which he should get for
tissue dx. This will be done at [**Hospital6 2752**]. We
didn't consult heme-onc since we didn't have tissue dx.
.
#. Fever - unclear etiology, but likely pneumonia ? bacterial v.
aspiration. Patient empirically started on vancomycin, levaquin
and flagyl on [**2153-11-6**]. He has defervesced and his white count
has gone down. Pt could potentially have post obstructive PNA.
No evidence of diarrhea for c. dif. UA negative. No wound
infections. ? atalectasis. No evidence of DVT. Urine cx negative
and all bld cx ngtd.
.
#.Afib - currently in afib. Risk of anticoagulation is
unacceptable. Hold all anticoagulation given ICH. Rate control
with metoprolol.
.
#.HTN- we did not have outpt BP med dosages, PCP was [**Name (NI) 653**],
but did not hear back at time of discharge. We converted IV to
po metoprolol and hydralazine today. Keep sbp < 150.
.
#. HDL- can restart statin.
.
#. FEN - passed swallow study, thin liquids, full solids, with
supervision. Replete lytes prn. Cardiac diet.
.
#. Access - PIV, Foley (d/c a
