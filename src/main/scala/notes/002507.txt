Pertinent Results:
[**2151-7-18**]
Chest CT: intrathoracic stomach, colonic diverticulosis without
evidence of diverticulitis.

[**2151-7-19**]
UGI series: Normal peristaltic esophageal contractions with an
intrathoracic stomach, configuration consistent with gastric
volvulus. Lack of passage of contrast from the gastric lumen
into the duodenum indicating hypomotility or a component of
obstruction due to the known volvulus.

[**2151-7-23**]
stomach pathology specimen: Fundic segment with focally
prominent submucosal edema, vascular dilation and congestion,
consistent with clinical history of gastric volvulus. Overlying
mucosa with focal and mild chronic, inactive inflammation; no
intrinsic mucosal abnormalities otherwise recognized.

[**2151-7-27**]
ECHO: Low normal left ventricular systolic function. Mild to
moderate aortic regurgitation. Atrial fibrillation. Mild
pulmonary hypertension.

[**2151-7-26**]
BEDSIDE SWALLOWING EVALUATION
Pt presents without s/sx of prandial aspiration during today's
evaluation.  These results do not rule out post-prandial issues
such as aspiration of reflux.  Given documentation of
mild-moderately ineffective esophageal motility, pt was educated
on aspiration precautions including sitting fully upright while
eating and remaining upright after meals.  She appears safe from
an oropharyngeal standpoint to return to a PO diet of regular
solids and thin liquids with meds whole with thin liquids.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] as a direct admit for a
question of gastric volvulus after she presented to [**Hospital 8641**]
Hospital late [**2151-7-17**] with severe chest and abdominal pain, with
approximately 1.5 liters of coffee ground vomiting and
hematemsis. At [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital, she underwent a CT of the chest,
which showed a large portion of the stomach in the left chest,
and then underwent an EGD, which showed incarceration of the
stomach without evidence of necrosis. On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], she
had green bilious non-bloody fluid draining from her NGT, and
was non-tender on exam with positive bowel sounds in all 4
quadrants. Her vital signs on admission were 99.2, 62, 138/58,
17, 96% Oxygen saturation on 2L. Given her stable status on
admission, she was initially treated with nasogastric
decompression and fluid resuscitation. She underwent an upper GI
series on [**2151-7-19**], revealing a configuration consistent with
gastric volvulus with lack of passage of contrast from the
gastric lumen into the duodenum, indicating hypomotility. She
underwent esophageal manometry on [**2151-7-21**], revealing mild to
moderate ineffective esophageal motility. She then underwent
Laparoscopic repair of paraesophageal hernia with graft
reinforcement, [**Last Name (un) **] gastroplasty, Nissen fundoplication, and
flexible gastroscopy on [**2151-7-24**]. Post-operatively, she passed a
swallowing evaluation on [**2151-7-26**] for regular solids and thin
liquids and her diet was advanced. An ECHO performed on [**2151-7-27**]
showed low normal left ventricular systolic function, mild to
moderate aortic regurgitation, and atrial fibrillation. She was
seen by Cardiology on [**2151-7-28**], who recommended an outpatient
follow up with her cardiologist to manage her AF and
anticoagulation.
Upon discharge, the patient is tolerating a regular soft diet
and has had several bowel movements.
