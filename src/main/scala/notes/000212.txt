History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 29250**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with a history of CHF who
presents in CHF exacerbation as a transfer from [**Location (un) 745**]-[**Location (un) 3678**].
 He reports feeling extremely short of breath this morning at
approximately 9 PM yesterday.  This was preceeded by a day of
increasing dyspnea, but no symptoms otherwise including no
shortness of breath or syncope.  Of note he has had mild
presyncope for a few weeks.  He reports that while he is very
compliant with his low salt diet he did eat a lot more food
during the [**Holiday **] holiday. Especially the day prior to
admission, he ate foods that he knew were high in salt and not
ideal for his congestive heart failure.  While at the OSH he was
found to have a blood pressure of 220s and was started on a
nitro gtt as well as a heparin gtt and aspirin.  He was given
large doses of diuretics (unclear amounts) and was reportedly
incontinent of large volumes of urine. He was transferred to the
[**Hospital1 18**] ER. At the OSH, he was started on heparin gtt,  but this
was stopped at [**Hospital1 18**] ED.  Additionally the patient reports a
sharp left shoulder pain that was not associated with any other
symptoms and did not radiate that was treated with morphine.  It
promptly resolved after the morphine and has not recurred.

In the ED initial vitals were 98.2 60 130/84 24 97% 10LNRB. The
patient received lasix and diuril with 200mL out.  However, per
report he desatted and became tachypnec after decreasing the
oxygen.

Of note he was last seen by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] on [**12-21**] where he was
noted to be in good control of his CHF and his hydralazine was
increased to 75 mg TID.

Currently he feels much improved. While he does have persistent
shortness of breath, he is much improved.  He is currently chest
pain free.

On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He
denies exertional buttock or calf pain.  He has had no nausea,
vomiting, or diarrhea.  He has chronic constipation. He has
noAll of the other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for positive presyncope x
several weeks and persistent lower extremity edema.  There is
the absence of chest pain,  paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
orthopnea, palpitations, syncope.

[**2113-1-2**]: ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg.There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal severe hypokinesis
of the basal inferior wall. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 50 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No aortic valve stenosis is present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**2-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2112-9-15**], the
severity of mitral regurgitation is slightly increased. :Left
ventricular systolic function is similar.
.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2112**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.
.
[**2113-1-3**]  CXR:
Comparison is made to prior study performed a day earlier.
Cardiac size is normal.  Small bilateral pleural effusions
greater in the left side are unchanged.  There is persistent
left lower lobe retrocardiac
atelectasis, moderate pulmonary edema is unchanged
.
EKG: Sinus rhythm. Incomplete left bundle-branch block.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Prolonged QTc interval. Compared
to tracing of [**2113-1-2**] no
significant change. QTc 483
.
MRI BRAIN: There are no areas of abnormal restricted diffusion.
There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or
shift of normally midline structures. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter
differentiation is preserved. There is mild diffuse global
atrophy. Periventricular white matter FLAIR hyperintensity along
with a few focal areas within the deep and subcortical white
matter bilaterally are consistent with chronic microvascular
infarctions. Old small infarctions are noted within the
cerebellum bilaterally. The left maxillary sinus is opacified.
The mastoid air cells and surrounding osseous and soft tissue
structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of infarction.
.
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
[**Age over 90 **] year old man walking w/ PT. Hurt ankle while walking.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Looking for fractures
INDICATION: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man hurt ankle while walking.
COMPARISON: None.
THREE VIEWS OF THE LEFT ANKLE
There is no evidence of acute fracture or dislocation. The talar
dome is intact and the mortise is grossly congruent. Vascular
calcifications noted.
IMPRESSION: Unremarkable views of the left ankle.
.
[**1-3**] CXR: REASON FOR EXAM: Cardiac failure exacerbation.
Comparison is made to prior study performed a day earlier.
Cardiac size is normal. Small bilateral pleural effusions
greater in the left side are unchanged. There is persistent left
lower lobe retrocardiac atelectasis, moderate pulmonary edema is
unchanged.
