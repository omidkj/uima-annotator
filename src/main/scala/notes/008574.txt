[**2194-7-29**] Minimal Invasive Mitral Valve Replacement


History of Present Illness:
63 year old male with history of valvular heart disease and
pulmonary embolus and DVT in [**2189**]. He describes slowly worsening
symptoms of dyspnea on exertion that was first noted one year
ago. He underwent an echocardiogram on [**2194-3-25**] which revealed
severe mitral regurgitation, left atrial enlargement and
pulmonary hypertension. Mitral regurgitation has progressed from
[**11-16**]+ in [**2189**] to [**1-16**]+ on this most recent echo. He also underwent
TEE which also revealed severe MR with significant P2 prolapse
with flail leaflet tip. He is referred for surgical evaluation.

Pertinent Results:
[**2194-7-29**] Echo: PREBYPASS: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium or left atrial appendage. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size is normal
with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There
is prolapse of the P2 mitral leaflet. The mitral valve leaflets
do not fully coapt. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet
(directed anteriorly), its severity may be significantly
underestimated (Coanda effect). There is no pericardial
effusion. POSTBYPASS: The patient is on infusions of
norepinephrine and milrinone and transiently epinephrine. There
is a new bioprosthetic mitral valve. It is well seated without
evidence of paravalvular leak. Gradients across the valve are
peak/mean of 17/7 mmHg. Right ventricular function, initially
moderately depressed immediately postbypass, has now improved to
normal. Left ventricular systolic function continues to be
normal. Normal thoracic aorta.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname 1169**] [**Known lastname **] was admitted the day before surgery for a heparin
bridge.  On [**7-29**] he underwent a minimally invasive MVR
(porcine).  This procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], please
see the operative note for details.  He tolerated this procedure
well and was tranfered in critical but stable condition to the
surgical intensive care unit.  He quickly extubated.  His chest
tubes were removed and he was tranferred to the surgical step
down floor. He was seen by the physical therapy service.  By
post-operative day #3 he was ready for discharge to home with
VNA. All follow-up appointments were advised. First blood
draw/INR check Monday [**8-4**] with results to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 69526**].
Target INR 2.0-2.5.
