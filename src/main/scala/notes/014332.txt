Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4891**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Sinus debridment


History of Present Illness:
69 yo M w/ CLL, h/o Parkinson's Disease, recurrent pulmonary
infections and chronic sinusitis who is s/p endoscopic sinus
surgery (sinusectomy) on [**9-21**] to prevent recurrence of MRSA
pneumonia.  On [**9-27**] he started to develop fevers, was seen by
ENT on [**9-29**] and given inhaled vancomycin and betamethason as OR
cultures were positive for MRSA.  He was then admitted from
[**Date range (1) 83646**] and started on vancomycin with goal trough of 10.
During that admission his ANC dropped to 0 and was started on
neuopgen by his oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**].

On [**10-8**] he underwent debridment by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 83647**] with minumal
purulent discharge.  On [**10-9**] he began to develop fevers to 103
with rigors and fatigue.  He was admitted on [**10-11**].

In the ED, labs were notable for WBC 51.9 HCT 25 plts 104,
sodium 132 (was 27 on [**2106-10-7**]). CXR without infiltrate.  His
floor course was c/b several runs of afib with RVR to the 150s
with systolic blood pressures as low as the 80s.  He was started
on Cefepime to [**Last Name (un) **] converage grown on nasal swab for
Pseudomonas on [**10-12**].  Since then his fever curve has declined.

Today at 7AM he was in afib wtih RVR to 150 blood prssure
briefly at 70/52.  He was given 3L NS followed by 0.25mg of
digoxin.  EKG was similar to above.  Pt remained asympomatic
throughout without chest pain, palpitations, shortness of
breath, or light headedness.  Shortly after digoxin, HR reduced
to 80s-100, BP improved to 90s.  He was transferred to the MICU
for monitoring and for increased nursing requirements.
