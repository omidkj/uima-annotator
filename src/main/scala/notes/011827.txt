2.  Hypertension.
3.  Hyperlipidemia.

7.  Nephropathy.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery bypass graft in [**Month (only) 116**] of this year with a
left internal mammary coronary artery to the left anterior
descending coronary artery and saphenous vein graft to obtuse
marginal and diagonal branch.
2.  Status post ICD placement secondary to high grade AV
block with left bundle branch block.
3.  Right toe amputation secondary to osteomyelitis.
4.  Right knee surgery secondary to infection.

ALLERGIES:  All opiates.  Benadryl causes disorientation.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Metoprolol 25 mg b.i.d.
2.  Lasix 80 mg q.d.
3.  Plavix 75 mg q.d.
4.  Protonix 40 mg q.d.
5.  Lisinopril 5 mg q.d.
6.  Metformin 850 mg b.i.d.
7.  K-Dur 20 milliequivalents q.d.
8.  Lorazepam .25 mg at h.s.
9.  NPH insulin 20 units b.i.d.
10.  Regular insulin sliding scale.

PREOPERATIVE LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count 13.3,
hematocrit 39.4, platelets 258.  BUN 38, creatinine 1.4, K
4.3.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs 96.5, 88, 20, 120/70.
Lungs are clear to auscultation, but diminished at bases.
Heart is irregular rhythm with a systolic murmur.  Abdominal
examination is unremarkable.  There are no bruits.  Pulse
examination shows femoral pulses are palpable bilaterally
without bruits.  Dorsalis pedis pulses are palpable
bilaterally 1+ and the posterior tibial pulses are 1+
bilaterally.  Lower extremities are without edema with a left
fifth toe nonhealing ulceration.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent an arteriogram of the
abdomen and bilateral extremity run off, which demonstrated
mild disease of the aorta.  The renal arteries were single
without stenosis bilaterally.  The right lower extremity run
offs show common iliac and common femoral are normal.  The
superficial femoral artery has mild disease.  The popliteal
has mild disease.  AT is occluded proximally.  Posterior
tibial pulse is occluded proximally.  The peroneal is
dominant vessel to the foot.  Reconstitutes the AP and PT at
the level of the foot.  The lower extremity shows the common
iliac and common femoral are normal.  There is mild
superficial femoral artery disease.  The popliteals are
occluded in its distal segment.  AT occludes proximally.  The
vertebral peroneal trunk revealed and is severely diseased.
The posterior tibial pulse is the principal run off vessel,
but occludes at the level of the mid calf.  There are large
collaterals to the posterior tibial and this vessel then
fills the posterior foot and arches.  The patient tolerated
his angiogram.  He was hydrated overnight.  He remained in
the hospital for anticipated revascularization.  The patient
underwent on [**2135-11-29**] a left AK [**Doctor Last Name **] to PT with right greater
saphenous vein.  He tolerated the procedure well.  He was
transferred to the PACU in stable condition with a palpable
graft pulse at the end of the procedure.  Immediately
postoperatively he remained paced.  He was hemodynamically
stable.  He was transferred to the VICU for continued
monitoring and care.  Postoperative day one there were no
overnight events.  He was continued on perioperative Kefzol.
His postoperative BUN was 24, creatinine 1.1, hematocrit
30.6.

His examination was unremarkable.  He was converted to oral
pain medications and beta blockers were initiated.  His diet
was advanced as tolerated.  His insulin NPH was reinstituted.
 Intravenous fluids were heplocked.  He remained on bed rest
in the VICU for continued monitoring.  Postoperative day two
the patient had elevated glucoses.  He continued on his rule
out.  CK total peaked at 114.  There were no MB fractions.
Troponin levels were .02, .02, .03.  The patient required
intravenous Lopresor for systolic hypertension.  He required
an increase in his beta blockade.  He was gently diuresed
with 80 of Lasix on postoperative day two and he remained in
the VICU.  Postoperative day three he required 1 unit of
packed red blood cells overnight for a hematocrit of 25.
Post transfusion hematocrit was 29.1.  He did have a
temperature max of 38.8 defervesced to 37.3.  He was pan
cultured.  Chest x-ray was unremarkable.  levaquin and Flagyl
were continued.  [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted.  The patient remained
in the VICU.  Postoperative day four the patient continued to
run a low grade temperature.  He continued to require
diuresis.  His hematocrit was 28, BUN 21, creatinine 1.1.  He
was delined and transferred to the regular nursing floor.
Postoperative day five his hematocrit remained stable.  He
was afebrile.  He was evaluated by physical therapy and they
felt he would require rehab prior to being discharged to
home.  The remaining hospital course was unremarkable.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg po q.d.
2.  Plavix 75 mg q.d.
3.  Metoprolol 25 mg b.i.d.
4.  Lasix 80 mg q.d.
5.  Protonix 40 mg q.d.
6.  Lisinopril 5 mg q.d.
7.  Metformin 850 mg b.i.d.
8.  NPH insulin 20 units q.a.m. and q.p.m.
9.  Regular insulin sliding scale before meals 2 to 10 units
per sliding scale.
10.  K-Dur 20 milliequivalents q.d.
11.  Lorazepam 0.5 mg at h.s. prn.

The patient should have BUN and creatinine monitored on an
outpatient basis.  These results should be called to Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 46970**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5315**].
