PT 13, PTT 30.8.  INR 1.1.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Heart rate 78 and sinus rhythm; blood
pressure 122/77; respiratory rate 14; 02 saturation 98% on
room air.  Neurologically, alert and oriented times three,
moves all extremities.  Pupils are equal, round and reactive
to light.  Cardiovascular is regular rate and rhythm; S1 and
S2 without murmur.  Respiratory:  Scattered rhonchi, left
greater than the right.  GI:  Soft, nontender, nondistended,

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was accepted for coronary
artery bypass grafting and on [**2-18**], he was brought to the
Operating Room.  Please see the OR report for full details
and summary.  The patient had a coronary artery bypass graft
times three with the left internal mammary artery to the
diagonal; saphenous vein graft to the left DL; saphenous vein
graft to the obtuse marginal 2; his bypass time was 84
minutes with a cross clamp time of 46 minutes.  He tolerated
the operation well and was transferred to the Cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit.

At the time of transfer, he had a mean arterial pressure of
72 and central venous pressure of 10; heart rate of 78 in
sinus rhythm.  He had Propofol at 10 micrograms per kilogram
per minute and Neo-Synephrine at 0.3 micrograms per kilogram
per minute.  The patient did well in the immediate
postoperative period.  His anesthesia was reversed.  He was
weaned from the ventilator and successfully extubated on the
morning of postoperative day one.

The patient remained hemodynamically stable, requiring a
Nitroglycerin drip for blood pressure control.  On
postoperative day one he was started on beta blockade as well
as diuretics.  His chest tubes remained in as he was
draining a fair amount of serosanguinous fluid.  The patient
remained hemodynamically stable.

On postoperative day two, his Nitroglycerin was weaned to
off.  His beta blockade was increased.  He was transferred to
the floor for continuing postoperative care and cardiac
rehabilitation.  On the floor, on postoperative day three,
the patient remained hemodynamically stable.  His beta
blockade was again increased.  His chest tubes were removed
as were his temporary pacing wires and his Foley catheter and
additionally his central venous access.  His activity level
was increased with the assistance of the nursing staff and
Physical Therapy.

Over the next two days, he had an uneventful hospitalization
and on postoperative day four, it was decided that the
patient would be stable and ready to be discharged the
following morning to home with visiting nurses.

At the time of discharge, the patient's physical examination
is as follows:  Temperature 99.0 F.; heart rate 90 and sinus
rhythm; blood pressure 104/67; respiratory rate 20; 02
saturation 100% on room air.  Weight preoperatively was 65
kilograms and at discharge is 64.8 kilograms.  Laboratory
data is white blood cell count of 8.9, hematocrit 27.5,
platelets 234.  Sodium 138, potassium 4.0, chloride 103,

commands.  Respiratory:  Breath sounds are clear to

with S1, S2 with no murmurs.  Sternum is stable.  Incision
with Steri-Strips, open to air, clean and dry.  Abdomen is
soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities are warm and well perfused with no edema.  Right
saphenous vein graft site with Steri-Strips, open to air,

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg q. day.
2.  Lopressor 75 twice a day.
3.  Lasix 20 q. day times one week.
4.  Potassium chloride 20 q. day times one week.
5.  Lipitor 10 mg q. day.
6.  Actos 45 mg q. day.
7.  Glucophage 850 twice a day.
8.  Insulin, NPH 20 q. a.m. and 25 q. p.m.
9.  Regular insulin sliding scale.
10. Percocet 5/325, one to two tablets q. four hours for
pain.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:   Good.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass grafting times three with a left internal mammary
artery to the diagonal; saphenous vein graft to the LDL and
saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal.
2.  Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Hypercholesterolemia.
5.  Tobacco use.

DISPOSITION:   The patient is to be discharged to home with
Visiting Nurses Association.
