History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 57980**] is a 74 year old female with a past medical history
of Diabetes Melitis type 2, now insulin dependent, hyperlipid,
[**Last Name (un) 32665**]-[**Doctor Last Name 122**] disease, and  dementia who presented to an out
side hospital with uncontrolled finger stick glucoses (500s
despite sliding scale insulin at home), lethargy, mental status
changes, and nausea and emesis (1 day prior). She was found to
be in diabetic ketoacidosis, with a urinalysis positive for
infection, ECG with diffuse t wave inversions, CK 700, MB 129,

[**Hospital1 18**] for further management & consideration of cardiac
catheterization.

Social History:
Prior to admission the patient was living at home with her
daughter. The patient was bedridden and very dependent on family

Pertinent Results:
Head CT ([**2137-9-12**]):
Limited study secondary to motion artifact with severely limited
examination/ of the infratentorial structures and the middle
cranial fossa. Within the limits of this study, there was no
evidence of major vascular territorial infarction or acute
intracranial hemorrhage.
*
EEG ([**2137-9-13**]):
Markedly abnormal EEG due to the low voltage slow
background with occasional surpressive bursts and with runs of
uniformly
distributed alpha frequencies throughout. Overall, the tracing
indicates a widespread and moderately severe encephalopathy.
This can
come from anoxia or severe metabolic derangements, but the
widespread
alpha frequency suggests medication effect. There were no
epileptiform
features.

Brief Hospital Course:
Overall it was hypothesized that the patient developed an
infection (i.e., urinary tract infection) leading to DKA & had a
non ST elevation myocardial infarction in this setting of acute
infection & metabolic abnormalities.
1. Cardiovascular:
A. CAD: NSTEMI - ECG changes and + cardiac enzymes; CK peaked at
1450 and then trended down. CK did rise again later after pt was
intubated, but MB and troponin continued to trend down. Because
the patient was not felt to be a good candidate for
catheterization, she was managed medically. She was started on
ASA, Plavix, and her statin was increased to 20 per day. She was
initially started on Metoprolol to control heart rate and blood
pressure, and when her blood pressure allowed she was given
captopril. She was given Lovenox for 48 hours but no integrillin
since she was not going to catheterization. The aspirin and
plavix were held during periods when concerns for intracranial
bleeding were present, but then restarted when this was felt to
be less likely.

Later, Ms. [**Known lastname 57980**] pulled out her NG tube repeatedly and it was
not possible to maintain her on plavix since it cannot be
administered otherwise. Her aspirin was continued rectally and
other medications were administered intravenously until her PEG
tube was placed. Of note, she had sufficient bleeding around her
tracheostomy site that her surgeon had to return to stitch it
down. It was thought that hemostasis was difficult to achieve
since she was on aspirin and plavix. Once her PEG was placed, it
was decided not to continue her plavix in the interest of
preserving hemodynamic stability.

B. Pump: EF 30-35%; Pt initially received aggressive intravenous
fluids for diabetic ketoacidosis, and then was diuresed since
oxygen saturations dropped and the patient was having more
labored breathing. The patient's blood pressures were initially
high and would go even higher with agitation. She was maintained
on a labetolol gtt for a short time to control these BP's. Her
labored breathing eventually led to intubation, followed by
extubation during a period where her hemodynamics had
stablilized, and then re-intubation since pt's breathing was
extremely labored on the shovel mask. For the second intubation
the patient was given propofol for sedation and her BP dropped
acutely. She required 3 pressors (Dopamine, Neo, Levophed) with
MAPs in 70s, SBP in 110s. Bedside Echo showed no changes after
these events. Her hemodynamics were gradually stablized and BP
eventually became high again. Throughout her hospitalization the
pt had extremely labile BP's that seemed to be affected by her
position and level of agitation. These changes were of unclear
etiology and thought to be possibly related to her underlying
[**Doctor Last Name 11042**] disease vs. pain. Her blood pressure medications were
titrated aggressively since she developed flash pulmonary edema
nearly each time she became hypertensive, tachycardic, and
tachypneic. Upon discharge, she was stable and normotensive.

C. Rhythm: Pt was in NSR for most of her hospitalizaton. During
the time she was maintained on Dopamine, however, EKG's showed a
junctional rhythm which resolved when the Dopa was weaned. She
remained in sinus throughout the remainder of her intensive care
unit stay.

2. Pulmonary: As discussed above, the pt was intubated on [**9-12**]
for primary respiratory acidosis with hypercarbic failure.
Extubated to face mask later on the same day but persistently
tachypneic to 30s. Tried BIPAP to no avail. Off BIPAP  patient
continued to breathe at 30 and breathing looked extremely
labored. It was felt that it would be unlikely that the patient
would be able to leave the hospital without some kind of
respiratory support and so it was collectively decided with the
family that a temporary tracheostomy might help her improve
