Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization and placement of an intra-aortic balloon
pump

History of Present Illness:
55 yoM w/ a h/o hypercholesterolemia transferred from [**Hospital 487**]
Hospital for STEMI. Patient had the onset of chest pain while
having an argument with his wife. Wife noted that he appeared
diaphoretic. The pain started after 10 pm.  Just prior to the
event, patient had hit his head against the wall a number of
times in frustration.  His wife called the ambulance and he was
brought to [**Hospital3 **]. In the ambulance he received SL NTG
x 3 with improvement in his pain. At [**Hospital3 **], he
complained of [**1-29**], substernal, nonradiating chest pain as if he
"pulled a muscle". ECG showed anterolateral ST elevation.  He
received an additional SL NTG but became hypotensive by report.
He also received aspirin 325 mg, plavix 600mg, heparin and
integrillin bolus and drip and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
cardiac catheterization. He arrived at [**Hospital1 18**] at ~ 1am.
.
In the cath lab, cardiac catheterization revealed a proximal LAD
occlusion.  IABP was placed prior to intervention and he was
started on dopamine for SBPs in the 70s. He received a BMS to
the LAD.  Following intervention, he became hypoxic requiring
intubation.  Following intubation, large amounts of pink frothy
sputum suctioned from ETT.  Patient received 10 mg of vecuronium
and midazolam boluses to complete the case.  A pulmonary
catheter was placed revealing a PCWP of ~25. ABG significant for
respiratory acidosis.  He received 40 mg and then 80 mg of IV
lasix.  Bedside ECHO performed revealed symmetric LVH and an
akinetic septum, anterior wall, and apex with hyperdynamic
inferoposterior walls.
.
ROS is unobtainable as the patient is intubated.  Wife reveals
that patient is typically healthy.  BPs are usually low with
systolics in the 100s.  His only medical problem has been
elevated cholesterol for which he has not been treated.  He has
otherwise never been in the hospital.


Past Medical History:
Hyperlipidemia

Social History:
Married.  Lives in [**Location 7658**] with his wife. [**Name (NI) **] 2 children, one
living at home. Originally from [**Country 3992**]. Moved to US in [**2160**].
Works in real estate. Nonsmoker. Occasional EtOH. No drugs.

Family History:
Family history is significant for a CVA in his mother in her
70s.  His father died at a young age but his wife is unsure of
the cause.

ECG [**2197-12-28**] pre-intervention:
NSR @ 70. Nl axis and intervals. 4-[**Street Address(2) 35782**] elevation in
I,aVL, V3-[**Street Address(2) 78165**] depressions in III,aVF. QWs in

ECG [**2197-12-29**] post-intervention: NSR and atrial tachycardia. Nl
axis and intervals. QWs in I, aVL, V1-2. TWI in V1-4.

[**2197-12-29**] TTE:
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. There is moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the anterior wall, septum,
distal inferior wall and apex (LAD distribution). The remaining
segments are somewhat hyperdynamic (LVEF = 35%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w CAD.

[**2197-12-29**] Cardiac Catheterization (see report for further details):
1.  Initial angiography revealed two vessel CAD. The LMCA
and LCX were angiographically normal.  The RCA had 60% mid
disease.  The
LAD was proximally occluded by thrombus.
2.  Placement of IABP for cardiogenic shock.
3.  Successful stenting of mid LAD with 3.5x18 BMS.
4.  Intubation for hypoxic and ventilatory failure in setting of
flash
pulmonary edema.  Patient was difficult to ventilate due to
heavy frothy
secretions and high airway plateau pressures.
5.  Echo in cath lab did not reveal any mechanical complication
but with
large anterior WMA consistent with his anterior infarct.

[**2197-12-30**] CT Abd/Pelvis:
1. Effusion/atelectasis at bilateral lung bases non-optimally
evaluated given lack of IV contrast administration. Superimposed
infection may be present.
2.  No retroperitoneal hematoma.
3.  Nonspecific stranding surrounding the pancreas and small
amount of simple- appearing fluid within the pelvis. Mild
gallbladder wall edema.
4.  No complications detected involving lines and tubes. IABP,
with balloon along thoracoabdominal aorta.



Brief Hospital Course:
(1) Myocardial Infarction
On [**2197-12-29**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was found to have 100% occlusion of the
proximal LAD on cardiac catheterization; a bare metal stent was
placed.  His course was complicated by cardiogenic shock,
requiring placement of intra-aortic balloon pump and intubation.
 TTE on [**2197-12-29**] showed symmetric LVH with akinetic septum,
anterior wall, and apex; EF was 35%.  His blood pressure was
supported with dopamine and vasopressin from [**12-29**] - [**1-2**].  He was
also on milrinone overnight from [**12-29**] to [**12-30**], but he became
hypotensive refractory to IVF and pressors, and the milrinone
was discontinued.  He was started on aspirin, plavix, and
heparin, and received a course of integrilin immediately
following the cath.  The IABP was pulled on [**2198-1-1**] without
complication.  Cardiac index remained ~2.0, which he was running
on the balloon pump.  He was extubated on [**2198-1-2**].

Repeat echocardiogram on [**2198-1-4**] showed an improved EF of 40 -
50% and less wall motion abnormality than prior echo.  Coumadin
was discontinued as it was felt that he was no longer at risk
for an RV thrombus.

(2) GI Bleed
On [**2197-12-29**], he was noted to have bloody secretions and NG lavage
revealed coffeee ground emesis.  Hct on admission was 52 and
dropped to 40 overnight both from the bleed and from
hemodilution (he was given 4+ L of NS for hypotension
overnight).  The GI service was consulted and deferred scoping
at the time because they felt the
