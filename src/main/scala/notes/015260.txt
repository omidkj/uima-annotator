History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 26211**] is a 42-year-old man with a history of MS who
presents with worsening lower extremity weakness over 7 days. He
is wheelchair-bound at baseline due to his MS, but in the last
5-7 days he has noted progressive worsening of his weakness:
whereas he is normally able to pull his knees up to his chest,
he
now is unable to move his LEs at all. This occurred in the
setting of some respiratory symptoms (cough, sputum production,
nasal congestion); his wife had bronchitis 2 weeks ago. Notably,
he has felt some chest tightness over the last 1-2 days, and has
felt he's had a weak voice and been mildly SOB over the last
day.
Although he acknowledges that his MS has been getting slowly
worse over the last few months (and he has been bed-bound since
a
hip injury 3 months ago), he is certain that this is different,
and a much faster loss of function. He denies any urinary or
bowel symptoms and has no saddle anesthesia.

On neuro ROS, he denies headache, loss of vision, blurred
vision,
diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo,
tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denies difficulties producing or
comprehending speech.  No bowel or bladder incontinence or
retention.

On general review of systems, he denies recent fever or chills.
No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denies chest pain
or tightness, palpitations.  Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation or abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or
bladder habits.  No dysuria. Denies arthralgias or myalgias.
Denies rash.


Past Medical History:
Renal tumor s/p nephrectomy
Multiple Sclerosis, presented [**2130**] with paraparesis, now most
likely secondary progressive, unable to tolerate beta-seron due
to flu-like symptoms.
h/o UTI
B12 deficiency - monthly injections
Left eye uveitis
Chronic constipation


Social History:
lives with wife and 2 sons, wife also uses wheelchair for
mobility. smokes 1/2PPD, no ETOH or drug use


Family History:
Father had MS and died of stroke in his 60's. Mother with
emphysema, CAD.

CXR- no infiltrate

MRI OF THE CERVICAL AND THORACIC SPINE, W &W/O CONTRAST,
[**2140-2-29**]-
FINDINGS: There is mild straightening of the cervical lordosis.
Stable multilevel degenerative changes consistent with minimal
posterior disc bulge at C2-C3 and C6-C7, at this level producing
mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing, left greater than
right, which also is associated with left uncovertebral
hypertrophy.

In the spinal cord, again, there are subtle hyperintense foci
detected on T2, there is no evidence of new lesions or abnormal
enhancement. In the thoracic spine, also the previously
described lesions at T8 and T11 are poorly visualized and
demonstrates no evidence of enhancement. The configuration and
signal intensity in the vertebral bodies of the thoracic spine
as well as the neural foramen at different levels appear normal.

The paravertebral structures demonstrate resection of the
previously described sebaceous cyst on the left paravertebral
area.

IMPRESSION: No significant change in the interim. There is no
evidence of new lesions or abnormal enhancement. The previously
described sebaceous cyst on the left parasagittal region on the
soft tissues has been removed.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 26211**] is a 42-year-old man with a history of secondary
progressive MS who presents with 5-7 days of progressive
bilateral LE weakness in the setting of a recent URI. His neuro
exam was [**Known lastname 28051**] for a spastic paraparesis, decreased
proprioception, preserved reflexes.  Development of significant
respiratory muscle weakness and respiratory failure as course
progressed.
.
# Respiratory failure:  Respiratory failure therefore thought to
be related to overall generalized weakness. He became unable to
clear his secretions and generate sufficient cough.  He had
mucous plugging to such a degree that he was unable to ventilate
large portions of his lung. He was intubated for bronchoscopy
[**3-9**], secretions suctioned. Bronch [**Month/Day (4) 28051**] only for some thick
secretions without other lesions.  Given continued poor
ventilatory mechanics, he remained intubated and eventually
required trach for continued pulmonary toilet on [**3-17**].  He
tolerated this procedure well. He continues to require the
ventilator but will further be weaned at rehab.
.
# MS exacerbation: Secondary progressive. Intially admitted to
the neuro ICU for monitoring of respiratory capacity given
initial differential included GBS. Prior MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 28051**] for
significant cervical and thoracic disease demyelinating disease.
MR C and T spine +/- gado was repeated this admission without
evidence of active MS lesions. He was treated with high dose
steroids followed by taper and has currently completed the
course.  His weakness did not improve as rapidly as desired,
necessitating trach and rehab placement as above. A later MRI
brain even following steroids showed a new demyelinating lesion
in the medulla.
.
# Hospital acquired pneumonia:  He had consolidations on CXR
also in the setting of mucous plugging.  His sputum from [**3-10**]
grew Acinetobact
