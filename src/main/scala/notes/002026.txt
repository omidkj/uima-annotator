dyspnea and cough

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 66 y/o male with a history of CAD (VF arrest post
CABG with ICD/PPM inserted), systolic CHF (EF 20%), PVD s/p
bilat fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypasses, AF s/p DC cardioversion [**2120**], DM2 on
insulin and gout post recent admission with gout flare and
prednisone course in [**2121-10-15**] presents with one week of
shortness of breath with associated cough. He notes subjective
fevers and chills with associated night sweats. Over the past
day he has developed confusion and difficulty with concentration
which was noticed by his daughter. [**Name (NI) **] has been having associated
headaches and chest pain. The chest pain was described as
squeezing in nature and without radiation. He also notes some
increased lower exteremity swelling which has been increasing
over the past week.
.
Of note, recently saw his rheumatologist who started him on
methylprednisone as well as increased his allopurinol due to an
elevated uric acid. He was also admitted in [**Month (only) 1096**] for about a
week for a significant gout flare.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 102.9 P 100 BP 131/69 R 20 O2 sat
100% RA. Labs were noteable for a WBC of 26.8 and a glucose of
45. Patient was given an amp of D50, levofloxacin, ceftriaxone
and vancomycin. Vitals upon transfer were Temp 100.3, HR 100,
100% 2L.
.
On the floor, he appeared comfortable but in no acute distress.
He was oriented to self, place and time however he appeared to
have difficulty answering questions. He was complaining of left
sided chest pain which his wife noted had been occurring over
the past 2 weeks. The pain was nonradiating and was relieved
with nitro tab x1.

STUDIES:
[**2122-1-8**] CXR: Study is limited due to patient's respiratory
motion and the superior aspect of the lung apices excluded from
the field of view. The patient is status post median sternotomy
and CABG. Right-sided AICD/pacemaker device is noted with lead
terminating in the right ventricle. Abandoned pacer leads are
also noted within the left chest wall, with the tip from one of
these abandoned leads terminating in the region of the right
ventricle. The cardiac silhouette remains moderately enlarged.
There are low inspiratory lung volumes. This likely causes
accentuation and crowding of the pulmonary vascular markings,
but mild pulmonary vascular congestion is likely present. No
focal consolidation is seen. There are no large pleural
effusions. Assessment for pneumothorax is limited. Abdominal
clips are seen in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. There
are no acute osseous findings.

[**2122-1-8**] ECHO:
Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] A left ventricular
mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. Diastolic function could not
be assessed. Right ventricular chamber size is normal with
borderline normal free wall function. [Intrinsic right
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] There are three aortic
valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. [In the
setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation,
the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be
undere
