Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Codeine / Quinidine/Quinine / Norvasc / Pravachol

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**]
Chief Complaint:
Lightheadedness, dizziness, palpitations.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardioversion

History of Present Illness:
Briefly, Mrs. [**Known lastname 107414**] is a very pleasant [**Age over 90 **] yo woman with  CAD,
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation s/p failed cardioversion (most
recent on [**2140-5-5**]), CKD (Stage III) who initially presented [**5-17**]
with 4 weeks of lightheadedness and vertigo and 3 days of SOB.
.
She was seen by her primary cardiologist [**5-16**], at which time her
flecainide was d/c'ed and her metoprolol and diltiazem were
increased for rate control. Apparently she had not been taking
the prescribed doses of BB/CCB and presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED
with chest pressure and atrial fibrillation with RVR. Initially
she was admitted to [**Hospital1 1516**] where she was noted to be in volume
overload and diuresed with furosemide, 40 mg IV. She was also
given metoprolol (at increased dose from 12.5 to 25 then 50 [**Hospital1 **]
over the course of two days) and verapramil (180 mg qd) for rate
control. This morning she complained of chest pain, was noted to
be bradycardic (60s) and hypotensive (SBP in mid 70s). She was
given 1.5 lt of IVF bolus and started on dopamine (uptitrated to
20 mcg). After these interventions her pressure improved to the
100s but then decreased again to the 90s. Her urine output
remained low. She had cardiac enzymes drawn, the first set being
negative, an ECG without ST changes, and a TTE, which showed
global hypokinesis with EF of 25%. Reportedly her EF from a TEE
done in early [**Month (only) **] was near normal (reported as mild depressed
LVEF. Last ECHO before that was in 90s with normal EF. Also has
had a cath in the 90s with normal coronaries, per report.
Notably her INR is also elevated to 3.7, presumably secondary to
warfarin.
.
Several days prior to presentation her VNA found her to be
tachycardic to 120s, and was referred Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] saw her [**5-16**] and
d/ced her fleicanide and increased her metoprolol, which the
patient did not take as she did not pick up prescirption. She
also reports having chest pain/pressure o/n 4d PTA,
non-radiating, no n/v/diaphoresis resolved w/ burping. Patient
was recently admitted with Afib w/ RVR, was cardioverted on [**5-5**]
and discharged home on flecainide, verapamil, metroprolol. She
has had no palpitations, no syncope, no PND or orthopnea. Pt.
also reports persistent RLE edema, since her rehab discharge,
this is unchaged, pt. takes lasix prn for this.
.
In the CCU, the patient admits to feeling cold. She denies,
chest pain, palpitations, fevers, chills, cough, abdominal pain,
or bleeding. There is no difficulty w/ speech. No dysuria, no
abdominal pain, constipation/diarrhea.

TTE: The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-25 %). The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global
free wall hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,

leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid

regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Severe global LV systolic dysfunction with somewhat
better function of the basal inferior and inferolateral segments
and the apical segments. There is akinesis of the ant
