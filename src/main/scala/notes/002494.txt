None


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 15676**] is a 80 year old Russian-speaking female with 45
admissions since [**2131**] and with a history of diastolic CHF, COPD
(5L home oxygen), HTN, pulmonary hypertension, A. Fib,
obstructive sleep apnea, renal insufficiency, bilateral lower
extremity discomfort, and an atrial septal defect. She is a poor
historian and information was obtained in part from her medical
record. Ms. [**Known lastname 15676**] was admitted on [**2140-12-22**] for hypoxia and
reported recent orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturia dyspnea, but
[**Date Range 15797**] fever/chills, N/V/D, chest pain or cough.
.
In the ED, Ms. [**Known lastname 15798**] initial vitals were: T: 98, P: 60,
BP: 145/60, R: 20, O2 Sat: 100% on NRB. A [**2140-12-22**] CXR indicated
unchanged cardiomegaly and low lung volumes as well as mild
pulmonary edema. Lasix (80 mg IV) was given which led to some
improvement in her symptoms. Ms. [**Known lastname 15676**] received IV Vanco,
but refused Bipap.
.
In the MICU, Ms. [**Known lastname 15676**] was given additional Lasix (80 mg
IVx2) which led to a diuresis of a 3.2 L. A [**2140-12-22**] ECG revealed
left axis deviation, non-specific intraventricular conduction
delay and non-specific ST-T wave changes -- findings considered
to be similiar to her [**2140-11-20**] ECG. A [**2140-12-23**] CXR indicated mild
edema, mostly in her right lung as well as a possible small
right pleural effusion. She received 6L of O2 as well as
morphine sulfate (2-4 mg) for her left lower extremity pain. She
weighed 103.7 kg (228.1 lbs) when she was transfered to [**Doctor Last Name **].

.
When she was transfered to [**Doctor Last Name **] on [**2140-12-23**], Ms. [**Known lastname 15798**]
vitals were: T96.9  BP 110/56 HR 65  RR 28 O2 86-88% on 6L. Her
heart rate was paced and her oxygen was weaned down to 5L, her
pre-admission level. Her [**2140-12-24**] CXR revealed findings consistent
with worsening CHF as well as an increased density at the right
base suggestive of pneumonia or pulmonary edema. While on
[**Doctor Last Name **], Ms. [**Known lastname 15676**] [**Last Name (Titles) 15797**] SOB, chest pain/tightness, and
mentated appropriately.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) Hypoxia: CHF exacerbation, likely a combination of medication
and fluid restriction non-compliance. The patient was afebrile
on admission making infection an unlikely etiology. Her CXR was
consistent with fluid overload. Also it may be the case that her
underlying pulmonary HTN/cor pulmonale is worse (she has not
been followed in pulmonary clinic as an outpatient for some
time). She also has COPD, however given absence of wheezing,
cough, or sputum production COPD exacerbation was not thought to
be the cause of her hypoxemia. In the ICU, IV lasix was started
and the patient diuresed 3.2L. She required oxygen via nasal
cannula, up to 6L to maintain O2 Sat between 84-91%. Once stable
she was transferred to the medical service. Combivent nebulizer
treatments, tiotropium were continued for her COPD. Her
metoprolol was increased and lasix was started on 80po daily and
IV as needed for further diuresis. She was maintained on O2
nasal cannula between 5-6L and did not use cpap at night. She
did well for 3 days on the medical service but began to be more
somnolent and again was hypoxic on exam and ABG. Pain medication
was held (percocet, fentanyl patch) but this did not improve her
mental status. She was transferred back to the ICU and further
diuresed 2L on lasix drip, acetazolamide (for metabolic
alkalosis) and bumex, and maintained on bipap (the patient
intermittently refused). She was also started on digoxin at
0.125mg qd for her RV disfunction. Her respiratory status
improved significantly. Once transferred back to the floor it
became clear that, once off bipap or cpap for an extended amount
of time she becomes sleepy. Bipap was ordered for use overnight.
The patient refused several times however once she would become
more tired and less alert she was amenable to using the mask.
This immediately improved her respiratory status, and in the
morning she would be able to tolerate nasal cannula with
improved saturation. During rehabilitation she would benefit
from cpap (or bipap if available) at night and nasal cannula
during the day.

.
2) Lower Extremity Erythema & Pain: Chronic [**Doctor First Name 15799**] statis issues
for several months. There were no open wounds concerning for
active infection. The patient remained afebrile. Her edema
improved with diuresis and compression stockings, topical
ointment and leg elevation. Her pain was treated with morphine
and percocet as needed, however given her somnolence from
hypoxia/hypercarbia this was switched to a fentanyl patch. A
wound care consult was called to ensure proper treatment of her
skin. Her pain improved and the fentanyl patch was discontinued,
also given her altering mental status at
