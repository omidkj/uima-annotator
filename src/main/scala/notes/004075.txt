Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4659**]
Chief Complaint:
sepsis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
R IJ central venous line placement

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 75-year-old female who complains of
progressively worsening rectal and buttock pain over the past 2
weeks. Upon presenting to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED today, she initially had
a
HR of 77 with a BP of 105/69, but quickly became hypotensive to
56/40 with a heart rate of 98. Sepsis protocol was initiated. A
central line was placed with great difficulty due to
near-complete IVC collapse. She was placed on a norepinephrine
drip and underwent a CT scan when she was somewhat stable. The
scan shows a large pre-sarcal abscess with rim enhancement, and
air and fat stranding tracking to a R hip prosthesis.

On [**2116-12-20**], she underwent a diverting loop colostomy by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] for a large rectovaginal fistula. Intra-operatively, she
was noted to have stool in the rectum, vaginal and presacral
space, and the posterior/presacral space was cleaned out. She
was
discharged on POD#6. It is noteworthy that prior to her
operation, she did manifest fever and hypotension to SBP of 75.
An echocardiogram was reassuring, with an EF of 65% with trace
valvular disease.

She was evaluated in clinic about two weeks ago by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
who was  not reassured by her progress at that time.  She
appeared to be slowly declining with a pelvic choleca situation
which was not amenable to repair due to the prior radiation
damage and poor vascular supply.

Imaging:
CT [**Last Name (un) 103**]/pelvis with IV contrast:
* 65 x 34 mm collection posterior to the rectum highly
suggestive
of an abscess
* Pockets of air in the fascial planes of the right thigh and
around the right hip joint suggestive of either a fistula or a
developing abscess
* Stable severe compression of L1
* distal limbs of aortobifemoral graft not in continuity with
iliac/femoral vessels


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted to SICU.  Started on antibiotics, resuscitated
with fluids, intubated, and placed on pressors.  She quickly
deteriorated and had worsening acidosis with a ph as low as 6.9
and lactate greater than 20.  She was requiring multiple
pressors and her due to her age and prognosis, it was decided to
speak with the family regarding comfort measures, as there was
no effective long term treatment for the pelvic source of
sepsis.  The family agreed.  It took about 24 hours to get all
the family members to the hospital to say their goodbyes.  Once
they arrived the ETT was removed, pressors and IVFs were
stopped.  The patient continued to breath spontaneous and
maintain a blood pressure in the low 80s.  After many hours it
appeared that the dying process may take a while longer.
Therefore she was transferred to the floor and treated with an
infusion of morphine for pain control. On [**2117-2-10**] at 0405 am the
patient expired, immedicate cause of death being cardiopulmonary
failure secondary to sepsis. The family was present at the time
of death, and declined an autopsy. The attending physician of
record, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] was [**Name (NI) 653**], as well as the chief
surgical resident of the service, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 429**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
