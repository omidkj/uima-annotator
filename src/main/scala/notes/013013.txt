Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
Right intracerebral hemorrhage

Intubation and mechanical ventilation
Central line placement

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 51 year-old right-handed man with a history of
untreated HTN, hep A/B w/?cirrhosis, EtOH use who presented to
OSH with large R frontal bleed.
Per medical records, pt w/HA for several weeks, taking ASA. On
[**2167-7-25**], awoke at 5am with severe HA not relieved by ASA and was
brought to [**Hospital3 17162**] ED. There, he had left facial droop,
slurred speech and altered mental status, and he was intubated
for airway protection. SBP 150-170.  Emergent head CT showed a
large right frontal/basal ganglia bleed with extension into
ventricles, and 3-5 mm of midline shift (per report) and he was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.  Started on
dilantin and mannitol during med flight.
On arrival in our ED, BP 176/66, peaked at 224/118, with low of
87/60. Neuro exam with sluggish pupils, 3.5mm on left, 2.5 mm on
right, swollen left optic disc, left facial droop, right corneal
reflex, moving right arm and leg spontaneously, extensor
posturing to pain except localizes on right upper extremity.
Labs with platelets of 88k and INR 1.6. [**Hospital1 **] pressure was
controlled with nipride drip, given additional mannitol,
sedated. Also given FFP and vitamin K for elevated INR,
platelets for goal >100k. Had witnessed seizure activity in ED,
and given additional dilantin, and then admitted to the neuro
ICU.

4. Alcoholism

Head CT: 4.5 x 6 x 6 cm right basal ganglia bleed with extension
into right ventricle, 3rd, and 4th ventricle. there is some
increasing size of lateral ventricle compared to outside
hospital CT which had showed 4x5x6 cm bleed
CTA: No definite intracranial aneurysm noted. Tiny aneurysms
cannot be excluded.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Intracranial hemorrhage: Neuro exam was initially stable, or
slightly improved, with some spontaneous movements on right
side, withdrawal to pain RUE, RLE, LLE and extensor LUE. After
48 hours, mannitol was discontinued, but later that day patient
became less reponsive. Repeat head CT had worsening edema and
mannitol was restarted. Despite elevated osmolarity, remained
with significant edema on CT, and remained comatose with minimal
responsiveness. [**Last Name (un) **] pressure was maintained with systolic
pressures less than 160 to minimize any further bleeding.
Dilantin was used for seizure prophylaxis.
Initially, attempts were made to maintain INR<1.4,
platelets>100k, but this had to be stopped secondary to
respiratory failure (see below).

2. Respiratory failure: Given large bleed and elevated
INR/decreased platelets, pt was aggressively transfused over his
first 2-3 days in the ICU. On [**7-28**], he developed worsening
hypoxemic respiratory failure and chest x- ray showed severe
bilateral pulmonary edema, consistent with TRALI vs ARDS.
Therefore, transfusions were held. Pulmonary status slowly
improved, and pt was satting well on 40% O2. though he continued
to have problems managing his secretions.

3. Fever/ID: Since admission, pt was spiking fevers. Urine
cultures were positive for E coli and Klebsiella, both sensitive
to levofloxacin. Depsite adequate treatment, pt has continued to
spike fevers of unclear etiology. Flagyl was added [**7-31**] for ETT
secretions that looked like tube feeds. Other contributors to
fever imclude sinusitis and pancreatitis

4. Pancreatitis: Amylase and lipase were checked on [**8-4**] to see
if pancreatic encephalopathy could be contributing to patient's
coma. Lipase was elevated to 300, etiology unclear as
triglycerides were ~150. Tube feeds were held and intravenous
fluids increased. He did not respond to pressing on his
epigastric area with signs of pain.

5. Presumed cirrhosis: Patient with long alcohol history, with
coagulopathy on admission, presumed secondary to cirrhosis.
However, LFTs unremarkable except for elevated bilirubin.
Abdominal ultrasound showed liver with normal echotexture, no
ascites, splenomegaly with questionable portal hypertension.

6. CV: TTE shows EF>55%, minimal RV free wall HK, 1+ MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **]
pressure was controlled with IV agents to keep MAP<130.

Despite continued care, patient remained comatose. After
multiple long discussions with the family, they decided to make
patient comfort measures only. He was extubated and made
comfortable. He died from cardiac arrest at 7am on [**2167-8-10**].
