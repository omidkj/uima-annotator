Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1283**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain with exertion and after eating.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization [**2149-2-7**]

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 75 year-old man with a history of mild coronary
artery disease, aortic stenosis and peripheral vascular disease
who presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] on [**2-5**] with acute onset of right
sided shoulder pain after eating dinner.  He was at rest at
onset.  The pain was dull, [**4-2**] pain and did not radiate.  He
had no accompanying shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, or
diaphoresis. The patient has had similar pain in the past that
was associated with exertion and after eating a heavy meal.
Pain did not resolve on its own but was relieved in the
emergency room after 3 sublingual nitroglycerin. EKG was done
and showed sinus tachycardia at 108, left axis, and [**Street Address(2) 4793**]
depressions V4, V5. Enzymes were cycled and the second set of
enzymes was positive with a troponin of .066.  A heparin drip
was started. Enzymes trended up to peak TnT of 0.135. An
echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 15 to 20% which
was markedly depressed from his previous echocardiogram in [**2146**]
which showed an ejection fraction of approximately 50%.  There
was global left ventricular hypokinesis and mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy.  The right ventricular function was
normal. He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 **] for
cardiac catheterization.

He also notes a recent cough productive of clear sputum and
wheezing but has no shortness.  On [**2-4**] he was started on a
prednisone taper and Azithromycin and he was continued on this
at the outside hospital.  He has a history of smoke inhalation
injury and has "bronchitis" with reactive airways, especially in
cold weather.  He has not had pulmonary function tests.  He
denies being on prednisone before but states when his wheezing
flares, his primary care physician gives him [**Name Initial (PRE) **] Z-pak which
helps.
Currently he denies CP, SOB, N/V, abdominal pain, dizziness.
Denies groin pain/leg pain.

[**2149-2-7**] RIGHT GROIN ULTRASOUND: Artery and vein are well
visualized, and there is no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV
fistula. Normal waveforms are elicited in both vein and artery.
[**2149-2-7**] CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION: Coronary arteries are normal.
Severe aortic stenosis. Moderate systolic and diastolic
ventricular dysfunction.
[**2149-2-11**] ECHOCARDIOGRAM Prebypass: There is severe aortic valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The aortic
regurgitation jet is eccentric, directed toward the anterior
mitral leaflet. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a
small pericardial effusion.  Postbypass: Normal RV systolic
function. Overall LVEF 30-40% (on epinephrine) with no
focalities. A bioprosthetic valve is seen in the native aortic
position, functioning well and stable in position with a peak
residual gradient of 12mm of hg. Ascending aorta looks normal
with no evidence of dissection.

[**2149-2-15**] ECHOCARDIOGRAM: Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed wityh global hypokinesis (most
prominent in basal to mid septum). No masses or thrombi are seen
in the left ventricle. There is severe global right ventricular
free wall hypokinesis. There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
[**2149-2-15**] ECHOCARDIOGRAM: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
with global hypokinesis and akinesis of the inferior wall.
Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). A
bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic
prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion
and transvalvular gradients. The left ventricular
inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with
elevated left atrial pressure. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 6692**] was evaluated by the cardiac surgical service and
underwent preoperative testing in preparation for aortic valve
repair.  Courses of steroids and Azithromycin were completed
pre-operatively for presumed bronchitis.  A right groin
ultrasound s/p catheterization was negative for pseudoaneurysm
or arteriovenous fistula.  On [**2149-2-11**] he underwent aortic valve
replacement with [**Last Name (un) **] [**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial valve.
Postoperatively, he was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive
care unit.  There sedation was weaned, and he was extubated.
His ICU course was uncomplicated, and he was transferred to the
cardiac surgical step down unit on postoperative day 1.
Physical therapy was consulted for assistance with strength and
mobility.  On post-operative day 2 he developed atrial
fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate.  He was treated with
intravenous beta blockade and intravenous amiodarone.  He
converted to sinus rhythm, but again developed atrial
fibrillation/atrial flutter.  Intravenous heparin was started.
He was transferred to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit
for reintubation and cardioversion.  He was cardioverted to
sinus bradycardia with 100 Joules and was extubated the next
day.  Intravenous amiodarone was transitioned to oral amiodarone
and follow-up echocardiogram showed no evidence of tamponade.
He was gently diuresed toward his preoperative weight and Beta
blockade was advanced as tolerated.  ACE inhibitor was started
for optimum blood pressure control and low ejection fraction.
He was transferred to the cardiac surgical step down unit in
stable condition after a few days. He developed a mild left
forearm cellulitic phlebitis which was treated with
Levofloxacin . He worked with physical therapy and was found
safe for home discharge. He was discharged to home on [**2149-2-24**]
with planned follow-up with cardiac surgery. All questions were
answered to his satisfaction upon discharge.
