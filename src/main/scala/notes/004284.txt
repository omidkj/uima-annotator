Imaging: [**12-10**] Abdominal US: No significant abdominal ascites
and no tapable fluid collection. Cirrhotic liver with portal HTN
including splenomegaly. Probable SBO, incompletely visualized on
examination.
[**12-10**] CT A/P: SBO with transition point in RLQ. No bowel wall
thickening or pneumatosis. Also c/w cirrhosis and portal HTN.
TIPS shunt occluded.
[**12-25**] CT A/P: same transition pt in RLQ pelvis with fecalization
of SB proximal to this pt, ? anther transition pt at proximal SB
but contrast passes thru; no pneumatosis
[**12-28**] EGD: 3 nonbleeding grade 2 varices in distal esophagus;
portal hypertension gastritis w small blood clot in stomach; no
active bleeding.
[**1-1**] KUB: persistent small-bowel obstruction or postop ileus
[**1-5**] CT Abd: Persistent dilation of multiple loops of small
bowel with wall thickening and mesenteric edema without a
definitive transition point. Although there is a relative
[**Name (NI) 29563**] point in the terminal ileum, these findings suggest
the possibility of mixed mechanical and functional obstruction;
Cirrhotic liver with TIPS and portal hypertension, such as
splenomegaly; Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.

[**1-13**] Abd U/S and duplex: scant ascites, patent vasculature, no
biliary dilatation
[**1-15**] CT abd:
There is increased ascites compared to prior study. There is no
focal fluid collection to suggest abscess formation. There is
diffuse anasarca and mesenteric edema. Small bowel is mildly
dilated with mild bowel wall
thickening, decreased since prior study. There is no pneumatosis
or free air.
