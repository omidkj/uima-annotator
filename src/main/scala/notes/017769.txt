Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
acute on chronic systolic heart failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
78M with a medical history of CAD s/p CABG ([**2139**] LIMA->diag,
SVG->OM1, SVG->LAD), s/p stent to LAD, [**Year (4 digits) **] to RCA ([**2146**]),
systolic heart failure secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF
20-30% [**2141**]), history of NSVT s/p ICD implantation ([**2141**])
transferred from [**Hospital6 17032**] for further
management of acute on chronic systolic heart failure,
hypotension in setting of diuresis, and worsening acute on
chronic renal insufficiency.
.
The patient has a history of multiple admissions to [**Hospital **] for CHF and COPD exacerbation and was recently
discharged to [**Hospital 25576**] Rehabilitation Center on [**2147-5-30**]
after hospitalization for one such episode.  At the rehab
facility he was noted to have progressively worsening dyspnea,
lower extremity edema, and orthopnea/paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea. He was able to ambulate 10 steps but w/ dyspnea. Denies
chest pain. He was transferred to [**Location (un) **] for further evaluation
on [**2147-6-6**].
.
On admission, vitals 110/60, 86, 20 100%RA. The initial exam was
notable for bibasilar crackles and severe bilateral LE edema
with BNP of 2620 (unclear baseline), felt to be c/w CHF
exacerbation, for which he was given IV lasix boluses. With
diuresis he developed asymptomatic hypotension (SBP 50s to 90s)
and was transferred to the ICU. The diuretics were held (has not
gotten lasix in >48 hours) and he was given IV fluid boluses
(volume unclear). His renal function deteriorated over the
course of his hospitalization from admission creatinine of 2.5
(baseline 1.5-1.8) to 4.2 today. Urine output reported to be
800cc in the past 24 hours. He developed hyperkalemia, with a
peak of 6.6 for which he was given kayexcelate, and this AM was
5.5. He had evidence of a UTI on admission UA so was started on
ceftriaxone. Chest X-ray reported possible right base infiltrate
with effusion so this was broadened to levaquin and ceftriaxone.
Liver function tests have worsened from AST/ALT of 179/64 on
admission to 2600/1853 today.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Right sided structures are normal in size and function
w/borderline right atrail enlargement. Pacing wires on RV. LA is
dialted. MV exhibits tethering to both anterior and posterior
leaflets with calcification of posterior mitral annulus noted.
LV is dilated and globally hypokinetic with severe hypokinesis
involving septum and inferobase. Overall LV fx is severely
impaired and estimated 20-25%. Aortic valve is tricuspid,
sclerotic and adequate excursions. Aortic root is normal. Severe

CARDIAC CATH:  6/ [**2146**]
Cardiac cath ([**5-13**]): 1. Coronary angiography of this right
dominant system revealed native three vessel coronary artery
disease. The LMCA had a distal 50% stenosis. The LAD was
occluded in the mid-vessel. The major diagonal branch had an
ostial 60% stenosis. The LCx had a long 60% lesion in OM1. The
RCA had a 90% stenosis just beyond the origin of the PDA. 2.
Arterial conduit angiography demonstrated patent LIMA-D1 and
SVG-OM grafts. The SVG-OM was occluded proximally. 3. Resting
hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling
pressures (RVEDP 16 mm Hg, PCWP mean 28 mm Hg). There was
moderate to severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (PASP 61 mm
Hg). The systemic arterial blood pressure was normal (SBP 122 mm

Hg). The cardiac index was normal at 2.7 l/min/m2. The systemic
vascular resistance was normal (911 dynes-sec/cm5). The
pulmonary vascular resistance was normal (PVR 135
dynes-sec/cm5). 4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the distal
RCA jailing the right PDA with a Xience (3x18mm) drug eluting
stent postdilated with a 3.25mm balloon.  Final angiography
demonstrated no angiographically apparent dissection, no
residual stenosis and TIMI III flow throughout the vessel (See
PTCA comments). 5. Successful closure of the right femoral
arteriotomy site with a Mynx closure device.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Native three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Patent LIMA-D1 and SVG-LAD grafts.
3. Occluded SVG-OM graft.
4. Moderate biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
5. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
6. Successful PTCA and stenting of the distal RCA with a Xience
drug eluting stent.
7. Successful closure of the right femoral arteriotomy site with

a Mynx closure device.
