Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old
gentleman presenting to the Emergency Department for right
hip pain with difficulty ambulating times a week.  Denied
chest pain, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, or trauma.
In the Emergency Department, patient became tachypnea
requiring more O2 requirement and was nasotracheally
intubated secondary to pending respiratory distress.  The
patient then experienced an episode of hypotension down to
75/48, fluid responsive.  Blood pressure normalized.  Chest
x-ray showed pulmonary edema.  Patient also had a fever of up
to 101.8 degrees and was empirically started on ceftriaxone 2
grams IV.  Blood cultures were obtained.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease.
2. Noninsulin-dependent diabetes.
3. Hypertension.
4. Increased cholesterol.
5. Hyperlipidemia.
6. Arthritis.
7. Benign prostatic hypertrophy.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1. Atenolol 100 mg q day.
2. Flomax 0.4 mg q day.
3. Glyburide 5 mg [**Hospital1 **].
4. Lipitor 10 mg q day.
5. Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual prn.
6. Vioxx 25 mg q day.
7. Zestril 5 mg q day.

ALLERGIES:  No known allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in a house with son.  Is
retired and no recent travel or sick contacts, nonsmoker and
no alcohol.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  By review of systems, the patient came in
with a fever of unclear etiology, but blood cultures grew out
Gram positive Staphylococcus aureus, coag positive, and
suspected to have an infected endocarditis.  On transthoracic
echocardiogram was not shown to have any vegetations.  On
transesophageal echocardiogram, 5 mm vegetation was found on
the aortic valve on both sides of the leaflet without any
abscess in the aortic root.  However, we also considered
other possible sources of infection to be considered
meningitis, and he was empirically started on ceftriaxone,
consider chest x-ray which did not reveal any acute
consolidations.

CT scan of the abdomen was negative.  On genitourinary
examination, he had a right inguinal hernia that was examined
by surgery and felt to be reducible and nonincarcerated.
Another source of possible infection is right hip possible
osteomyelitis given the initial hip pain as well as urine.
Urinalysis was normal.

Once the blood cultures grew out Staphylococcus aureus,
sensitivities came back, he was switched to oxacillin and
gentamicin.  Gentamicin for five days, oxacillin throughout
the duration of his course, and for a total of six weeks,
surveillance cultures were taken for three days, and they all
have since been negative.

In terms of his infective endocarditis, he was also started
on Xigris given multiorgan dysfunction.  He was on Xigris for
96 hours.  In addition, a cortisol level was checked, and
given that it was low, he was started on hydrocortisone 50
mcg q6h.

In the middle of his MICU course, he did have some low grade
spiking temperatures.  One source that we did not rule out is
CNS.  A lumbar puncture was performed and did not reveal an
infection in that system, no meningitis.

His second issue is his issue of hypotension.  There is
debate whether there was some component of cardiogenic.
Given the positive blood cultures, it was confident that it
was sepsis, however, he had a depressed ejection fraction on
echocardiogram again likely secondary to sepsis.  He was
given plenty of fluid boluses.  Chest x-ray showed pulmonary
edema.  He had a fever all suggesting to septic shock.  He
was treated with Xigris and antibiotics with underlying source.
He was started on  Neo-Synephrine that gradually was weaned off.

Next issue is pulmonary:  He was nasotracheally intubated in
the Emergency Department.  After several days, he was
switched to orotracheal intubation, endotracheal tube to minimize
possible sinusitis.  Throughout the course, he was slowly weaned
to pressure support and was extubated without any complications.

In terms of cardiac issues, in the initial presentation, he
had ST depressions that resolved on repeat electrocardiogram.
He had an elevated troponin over 50.  It was thought that this
was secondary to demand ischemia from his hypotension and sepsis
picture.  A repeat transthoracic echocardiogram after clinical
improvement showed his ejection fraction improving to over 45%,
closer to his baseline.  It was felt by ID and cardiology that
repeat transesophageal echocardiogram was not necessary unless he
had persistent fevers or blood cultures.  After being extubated
for 1-2 days, he had another episode of tachycardia with rate-
related hypotension and ST chagnes.  He went to urgent cardiac
cath which revealed 3VD and had two vessels PTCA'd.

Hip:  He had a MRI that showed bony destruction of his right
hip likely osteomyelitis.  Orthopedic Service was following,
and felt that he was too unstable during the MICU to consider
a surgical washout or any procedure at the time.  They will
continue to follow and will give their recommendations once
patient is stable.

In terms of his inguinal hernia is reducible.  It has been
stable and per Surgery is not acute, will continue to monitor
and follow.

In terms of his renal function, his renal function was very
stable throughout the hospital course.  Creatinine was very
stable around 0.9.  During his hospital course he was
diuresed aggressively given that he was net positive 10 of
liters of fluid.  In terms of benign prostatic hypertrophy,
we will continue his Flomax.

He had a Foley in, and one issue with in terms of renal, he
had episodes of hematuria with clots that formed blocking the
Foley catheter.  Urology was consulted.  They placed a 24
French catheter, irrigated, and had a significant amount of
clots, replaced with a three-way Foley with continuous
bladder irrigation.  He is continuing to have hematuria, but
the clots were minimized and hematocrit was stable.

In terms of hematocrit, his hematocrit was low in the
beginning we thought secondary to phlebotomy and boluses of
fluid.  It did stabilize and was not an issue.

In terms of endocrine, he was on an insulin for his
non-insulin dependent-diabetes.  Blood sugar remained stable.

GI:  He was on Pepcid, and prophylaxis, and tube feeds at a
maximum goal.

In terms of Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition:
Electrolytes were repleted as necessary and large fluid
boluses were given.  Patient was called out to the floor in
stable condition and rest of his hospital course will be
dictated the Medicine [**Hospital1 **] Service.
