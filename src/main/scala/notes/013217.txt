History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 82 y.o. woman w/ pmh of HTN, Afib, presenting
with lightheadedness in setting of likely beta blocker or
calcium blocker overdose. On admission, she was taking
Metoprolol Tartrate 150mg PO twice daily, in addition to
Diltiazem Ext. Release 240mg PO daily, and Nifedipine Sust.
Release 30mg PO daily. She lives at home alone, and is
self-reliant in terms of administration of her medications. She
reportedly was feeling dizzy and tired at home and called EMS.
Upon arrival, EMS found her HR was 20-30, SBP in 70's. EKG
showed afib at a rate of [**Street Address(2) 108033**] or T wave
changes. She was given atropine 0.5mg and fluids. On
presentation to the ED initial vitals were SBP 80's, HR 40's.
She was given atropine 1mg X2, HR increased to 60's. Given Ca
Gluconate 2g, Glucagon 9mg, Regular Insulin 70 units IV X1
followed by insulin drip at 70 units/hr. HR increased but
remained hypotensive. Bolused 1.5L of NS, started on dopamine
drip. SBP increased to 110, however became hypoxic with oxygen
saturation of 84% on 4L and was intubated and transferred to the
ICU.
.
Of Note, the patient has a history of two recent
hospitalizations. The first, [**Date range (1) 108031**] was secondary to
community acquired pneumonia and COPD exacerbation. She was
treated with Levaquin. She was also noted diagnosed with atrial
fibrillation during this admission, and started on coumadin,
diltiazem, and had her atenolol switched to metoprolol.
.
Her second admission occurred [**Date range (1) 90782**]. She presented with
bradycardia, diaphoresis, nausea, and reported taking a double
dose of her diltiazem. She was also in ARF w/ Cr. 2.1, lactic
acidosis with Lactate 10.0, presented with leukocytosis 16->32,
and Corynebacterium diphtheriae bacteremia, 4/4 bottles. She
completed a 14 day course of vancomycin ending [**1-13**]. Echo during
this admission was negative for vegetations.
.
Patient was intubated and unable to provide review of symptoms.
Per family and report form ED, patient was following commands
and able to communicate.

EKG ([**2134-2-14**]): rate 103, atrial fibrillation w/ rapid
ventricular response.  poor R wave progression, probably a
normal variant.  Compared to tracing #1, atrial fibrillation has
replaced sinus rhythm.
.
2D-Echocardiogram ([**2134-1-5**]): "The left atrium is moderately
dilated.  The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5mmHg.  There
is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.  The left
ventricular cavity size is normal.  Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF > 55%).  Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal.  The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.  There is no aortic valve
stenosis.  Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.  The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened.  Mild to moderate ([**2-12**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.  [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.  There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  There is no
pericardial effusion.  No vegetation seen (cannot definitively
exclude)."
.
RADIOLOGY:
CXR AP ([**2-7**])
IMPRESSION:
1. Endotracheal tube in place, 2.5 cm above the carina.
2. Mild pulmonary edema, with small bilateral pleural effusions.

3. Right infrahilar opacity, most probably represents
atelectasis, but is
incompletely assessed. Recommend further evaluation with repeat
radiography following appropriate treatment.

Brief Hospital Course:
82F w/ pmh HTN, afib, p/w bradycardia and hypotension in setting
of likely beta blocker or calcium channel blocker overdose,
complicated by PNA, UTI and C.difficile infections.
.
# Hypotension and Bradycardia: Likely BB or CCB toxicity.
Patient has history of similar presentation after overdose of
diltiazem. On admission, EKG showed afib with slow rhythm, no
heart block, no signs of ischemia. HR improved with atropine.
The patient was treated for BB or CCB overdose with calcium
gluconate, glucagon, and Insulin IV. HR continued to improve but
still remained hypotensive. Blood pressure eventually improved
with dopamine. Transitioned to levophed, then weaned.
.
# Hypoxia: Likely secondary to acute pulmonary edema. Possibly
from fluid overload in setting of diminished contractility from
BB toxicity, or may be from acute diastolic dysfunction from
myocardial ischemia given ST depressions in lateral leads.
Intubated in CCU. Hypoxia improved with diuresis, once
hypotension resolved. Pt extubated on [**2-12**]. Post extubation, pt
became agitated. Haldol, ativan and zyprexa have been tried.
Redirection, zyprexa have been used successfully.  Since
arriving on medical floor, sat 98% on 2L O2 initially and, after
one day, with desats to low 90s% on room air.  Patient continued
to be monitored for decompensation from existing COPD and
asthma, and rece
