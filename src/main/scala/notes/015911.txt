Service:  [**Doctor Last Name **]

NOTE:  This is a STAT addendum Discharge Summary covering the
period from  [**2149-11-30**] to [**2150-1-2**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  PULMONARY:  From a pulmonary standpoint, the patient had
no further complications of pulmonary edema after discharge
from the Medical Intensive Care Unit to the floor.  The
patient completed a course of vancomycin for
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:   From a cardiovascular standpoint, the
patient had no recurrence of pulmonary edema.  He did
experience episodic Wenckebach heart rhythm with a rate in
the 50s with very rare sinus pauses.  This was thought to be
secondary to the amiodarone that the patient was on.

His amiodarone dose was titrated down to 200 mg q.d.
Electrophysiology was re-contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding this.  They did
not feel that there was need for pacemaker for bradycardia at
this time, but rather suggested that the patient's amiodarone
be decreased to 200 mg q.d. as mentioned above.  Otherwise,
the patient was continued on his cardiac regimen.

He had several follow-up electrocardiograms that continued to
show sinus rhythm with left axis deviation, intraventricular
conduction delay, left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage,
and ST depressions in V2 and V3 that were unchanged when
compared to previous electrocardiograms.  The patient had no
symptomatic complaints of shortness of breath or chest pain
for the rest of his hospitalization.

3.  RENAL:  From a renal standpoint, the patient was
continued on hemodialysis through a tunnel Perm-A-Cath.
Nephrology followed the patient while in the hospital, and
the decision was made that the patient would be discharged on
hemodialysis through his tunnel catheter and would have both
Renal followup and followup in Transplant Surgery Clinic for
a possible arteriovenous fistula placement.

4.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  From an infectious disease
standpoint, the patient completed a course of vancomycin for
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.  The
patient had episodes of diarrhea while in the Intensive Care
Unit.  Clostridium difficile toxin and fecal leukocytes were
negative both in the Intensive Care Unit and on the floor.

5.  ENDOCRINE:  From and endocrine standpoint, the patient
had a negative workup for adrenal insufficiency in the
Intensive Care Unit.  On the floor he was continued on a
regular insulin sliding-scale and NPH regimen with very good
glycemic control.

6.  HEMATOLOGY:  From a hematologic standpoint, the patient
had received a total of 5 units of packed red blood cells and
had been started on Epogen with a very stable hematocrit
throughout his hospitalization.

7.  PSYCHOSOCIAL:  From a psychosocial standpoint, the
patient continued to evidence a reluctance to participate in
his recovery; refusing to wear BiPAP for his sleep apnea and
refusing to work with Occupational Therapy and Physical
Therapy.  The patient had already been started on Paxil for
depression, and it was felt that his attitude was most likely
secondary to his medical condition.  He was strongly
encouraged to participate in activities that would help
improve his conditioning.  Toward the end of the
hospitalization the patient became more participatory in his
recovery.

8.  FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION:  From a fluids,
electrolytes, and nutrition standpoint the patient was
continued on tube feeds and began to take food orally during
the last few days of admission.  He began to show increasing
interest in oral nutrition.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.
