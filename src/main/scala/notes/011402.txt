Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation and extubation

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo male w a history of [**Last Name (un) 3562**] disease, COPD, afib on
coumadin, prostate ca s/p XRT, and high grade transitional cell
bladder CA s/p multiple TURBT, most recent cauterization in
[**2138-7-20**] who was brought in by ambulance after being found
down at his [**Hospital3 **] facility.
.
Per report, the patient was found on the floor when an aide went
to check on him. He had uncontrollable arm movements and
twitching. His oxygen level was reportedly low. His friend who
went to visit him the night before thought he was a little
groggy secondary to medications he has been getting for anxiety.
EMS was called. Blood sugars were in the 120s.
.
In the ED, initial VS: Tm 103 rectally, HR 101 BP 95/46 RR 27
100% on vent settings. Exam was notable for incomprehensable
speech, bilateral rhonchi and guarding on abdominal exam.
Patient was following commands, with equal grips, but had
myoclonic jerks every few seconds. Patient was intubated. CXR
was concerning RLL infiltrate, so he was given IV Vancomycin and
Zosyn.

Labs were notable for a K of 6.0, Cr of 3.1, WBC 9.8, HCT 25.2,
INR of 2.3, BNP of 3682, and a positive UA. Patient was given 3L
IV fluids, Benadryl 50mg IV, Rocuronium, Midazolam and Fentanyl
for intubation. He was also given 60mL po Kayexelate, and 650mg
PR tylenol. The patient was started on Levophed peripherally. CT
head was negative. CT Abdomen/Pelvis was concerning for
pneumoperitoneum and likely anterior pelvic abscess abutting
bladder dome. Cystogram was performed but results were pending
on transfer. Surgery and urology were consulted. Vitals signs
prior to transfer were HR 60 BP 95/37 18 100%.

On admission to the MICU, patient is intubated and sedated.

Studies:
.
CXR [**2138-9-12**]: Bibasilar (right greater than left) opacities might
represent
multifocal pneumonia, aspiration, or atelectasis.
.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis [**2138-9-12**]: 1. Moderate amount of free air in the
abdomen (pneumoperitoneum).  2. Focal gas collection in the
anterior pelvis (suspect at least partially extraperitoneal)
abutting the bladder dome and likely related to bladder
pathology and rupture. There are adjacent to colon loops with
diverticulosis. However, there is no direct contact with bowel
loops and there is no evidence of diverticulitis or
appendicitis. There is no definite evidence of fluid collection
or abscess formation. Conventional or CT cystogram may be
pursued to confirm. 3. Fluid collection around the spleen has
low attenuation likely represents simple fluid, much less likely
hemorrhage. 4. No evidence of intra-abdominal hematoma.  5.
Foley catheter with balloon in the prostate urethra. [**Last Name (un) **]
repositioning.
.
CT Head [**2138-9-12**]: No acute intracranial process. Mucosal
thickening or fluid accumulation in the ethmoid air cells and
nasal cavity. Ethmoid air cell hemorrhage cannot be completely
excluded, although findings are likely secondary to intubation.
No fracture seen.
.
CT Cystogram [**2138-9-12**]: Small contained fistulous connection
between the bladder dome into the region of the intraperitoneal
air collection.
.
CXR [**2138-9-13**]: Frontal view of the chest is compared to the prior
study from [**2138-9-12**] and additional previous studies. Left-sided
pacer is unchanged. Endotracheal tube terminates in the thoracic
inlet. Nasogastric tube courses below the stomach, although the
tip is not seen. Since the prior study, there has been interval
development of small bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar
atelectasis as well as moderate congestive failure.
.
LUE ultrasound [**2138-9-15**]: No evidence of DVT.
.
ECG [**2138-9-16**]: Atrial fibrillation. Wide complex beats may be
paced. If so, there may be a problem with the pacemaker.
Conducted complexes show RSR' pattern in lead V1 and early R
wave progression. Since the previous tracing of [**2138-9-12**] the
atrial fibrillation is new. Clinical correlation is suggested.
.
CT head [**2138-9-19**]: No evidence of acute intracranial process.
.
CXR [**9-24**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this
date, there is little change. The cardiomediastinal silhouette
is stable. Opacification behind the heart is consistent with
pleural effusion and atelectasis. In the appropriate clinical
setting, the possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to
be considered. Minimal atelectasis is seen at the right base.
Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is again consistent
with mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Central
catheter and pacemaker device are essentially unchanged.
