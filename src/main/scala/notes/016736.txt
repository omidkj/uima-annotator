History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 61yo morbidly obese F with h.o recurrent UTIs, DMII,
hemolytic anemia, h/o PE ([**2130**]) who presented to the ER on [**9-23**]
with Temp. 102 x 1 day. She denied localizing sxs or CP/SOB. She
noted erythema on her lower abdominal pannus x several days. Of
note, patient recently ([**7-22**]) noted to have large lower
abdominal hematoma (40 x17cm) in setting of supratherapeutic INR
that was being managed conservatively during admission with
dressing changes and stopping anticoagulation(warfarin d/c'd in
[**7-22**] but restarted [**8-22**] by PCP).
.
On [**9-24**], an abdominal u/s of the area and abdominal CT showed a
large 40x3 cm fluid collection 2 cm underneath the skin surface,
with intraluminal gas and a thickened wall suggestive of
cellulitis. Surgical removal was scheduled for [**9-25**]. An aspirate

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 61 yo morbidly obese female with multiple medical
problems including OSA, diabetes, recurrent UTI, h/o PR, PAF,
HTN and pannus hematoma presenting with fever with abdominal U/S
on [**9-24**] revealing evidence of pannus hematoma. Abdominal CT
showed a large 40x3 cm fluid collection 2 cm underneath the skin
surface, with intraluminal gas and a thickened wall suggestive
of cellulitis. Surgical removal was scheduled for [**9-25**]. An
aspirate of the wound Gm stain revealed 2+PMN, 2+GNR, 1+GPC. The
patient was broadly covered with Vancomycin, aztreonam, and
Clindamycin per ID's recommendation. She was planned to got to
the OR on [**9-25**] but went into Afib became hypotensive but was
asymptomatic. She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], bolused with 5 L
IVF and had I&D of her pannus wound at the bedside with 1.5 L
drainage of purulent and bloody fluid.  While in the ICU she
received a total of 10 L NS, started on corticosteroids for
concern of adrenal insufficiency and remained asymptomatic,
converting back to NSR soon after her arrival back to the ICU.
[**Last Name (un) **] Stimulation was equivocal test and steroids were d/c'd
after 36hrs due to stable BP and low suspicion for adrenal
insufficiency. She was transferred to the floor for further
monitoring with plans for surgery.
.
1. Infected pannus hematoma: Coumadin and aspirin continued to
be held. Patient was hemodynamically stable and taken to the OR
for incision and drainage. The procedure was uncomplicated and
she was transferred back to the floor. Wet to dry dressing
changes TID were performed with significant decrease in
drainage. Her hematocrit slowly trended down and she was
transfused 2 units pRBCs. Her hematocrit remained stable in the
low 30's for the rest of admission. She will follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] for monitoring of her wound and to discuss possible
plastic surgery referral for pannectomy.
    An infectious disease consult was obtained as above.
Cultures grew pan sensitive Enterobacter cloacae, s. viridans
and enterococcus. She was continued on vancomycin and aztreonam
and switched from clindamycin to Flagyl. Her vancomycin troughs
were kept between 15-20. A full 14 day course of antibiotics
will be administered from the time of incision and drainage. A
PICC line was placed for antibiotic administration. She will
have weekly labs including vancomycin trough checked and results
will be faxed to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2505**] in the [**Hospital **] clinic. She will follow up
with him in [**Hospital **] clinic with CT abdomen and pelvis prior to her
appointment.
   Wet to dry dressing TID will be continued. Given that her HCT
remained stable and that she has documented atrial fibrillation
(noted several times to go in/out during this hospitalization),
she was restarted on anticoagulation.  This decision was made
after discussion with the surgery service, who agreed it was
safe to anticoagulate now that her hematoma had been drained and
her wound was to heal by secondary intention.  Any sign of
re-bleeding would be immediately noticeable.  She should have
her INR checked every third day given recent restarting of
Coumadin will goal INR from 2-2.5.
.
2. Respiratory: On admission to the ICU there was concern for
possible PE given that the patient was hypotensive in atrial
fibrillation given her history and multiple risk factors. CTA of
the chest was obtained that was difficult to interpret, but had
questionable new filling defect. Given her risk for bleeding at
that time, poor study quality, negative lower extremity
Dopplers, lack of symptoms and the fact that she was maintaining
good O2 sats she was not anticoagulated. Her O2 sats remained
stable. However, POD 4 after I&D she had increased O2
requirement and increasing cough productive of sputum. CXR was a
poor study but did not reveal any cons
