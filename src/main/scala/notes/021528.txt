HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 70-year-old man with
a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart
failure, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes mellitus,
chronic renal insufficiency, and was previously admitted with
a right groin bleed approximately six weeks after his
catheterization on [**2133-3-2**], with a mid left anterior
descending artery lesion of 70%, PTCA plus stent, and 100%
right coronary artery.  He also had some congestive heart
failure and was diuresed and was incidentally sent home with
[**Year (4 digits) 269**] on [**2133-3-3**].

He reports that he had been doing well until one week ago
when he had no shortness of breath, no chest pain, no groin
pain, but he noticed a little expansion in his right groin.
He called and discussed this with his primary cardiologist,
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], two days ago and a small hematoma was evident as
per his [**Last Name (STitle) 269**].  He was asked to come in today for an
ultrasound, and during the ultrasound the hematoma was noted
to be rapidly expanding during the study anterior to the
right femoral artery.  At the time, there was no
pseudoaneurysm noticed.  He was transferred and admitted
directly to the floor as per Radiology but then initially
transferred to Coronary Care Unit for further management.
Currently, he has no complaints other than a moderate right
groin discomfort.  No chest pain.  No shortness of breath.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease.
2.  Congestive heart failure, ejection fraction with mild
left ventricular dysfunction.
3.  Left ventricular hypertrophy with 2+ mitral
regurgitation.
4.  Atrial fibrillation.
5.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
6.  Hypertension.
7.  Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine
between 2 and 3.
8.  Status post DDD pacer.
9.  Polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **].
10.  Spinal stenosis.
11.  Obstructive sleep apnea; he uses CPAP at night.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Coumadin 2.5 mg alternating
with 1.25 mg, Lasix 80 mg and 40 mg, NPH 30 and 30, regular
insulin sliding-scale, Aldactone 12.5 mg p.o. q.d.,
aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., allopurinol 100 mg p.o. q.d.,
Prilosec 20 mg p.o. q.d., Prazosin 1 mg p.o. q.d., Neurontin
100 mg and 300 mg, Isordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d., amiodarone 200
mg p.o. b.i.d., hydralazine 40 mg p.o. t.i.d., folate 2 mg
p.o. q.d.

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives at home with his wife and [**Name (NI) 269**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He had a temperature of 98.9, with an
a V-paced rhythm, blood pressure 147/85, satting 93% on room
air.  Generally, mildly uncomfortable man, talkative, in no
acute distress.  Head and neck examination revealed pupils
were equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
Sclerae were anicteric.  Mucous membranes were moist.
Jugular venous pressure was 8 cm.  Respiratory, he had rales
only at the bases which were mild.  He was in a regular rate
and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2, a 2/6 systolic murmur
radiating to the axilla, and a [**12-6**] crescendo-decrescendo
murmur at the right sternal border.  Abdomen, right lower
quadrant showed prominence of expanding hematoma, clearly
demarcated borders, firm, nonpulsatile, with a mild bruit.
Extremities revealed right lower extremity was cool.  Distal
pulses were not palpable, but upper was okay.  He currently
has two C-clamps placed over his groin which were placed by
Interventional Radiology at the site.

LABORATORY FINDINGS:  He had a hematocrit of 31.9, a white
count of 9.9, a platelet count of 238.  INR of 2.7, with a
BUN and creatinine of 41 and 2.9.

Ultrasound at the time just showed a groin hematoma of
approximately 6 cm to 8 cm during the study.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  A 70-year-old white male with a history
of catheterization six weeks ago with a recently expanding
hematoma in the right groin in the setting of an INR of 2.7.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted to the
Coronary Care Unit where the bleeding was controlled.  The
hematoma did not increase in size.  It was very well
demarcated.  It did not exceed beyond the boundaries of the
demarcation, and we continued to slowly release the tension
of the C-clamp.  He was noted on that day to have a
hematocrit of approximately 27.  He was transfused with
2 units of packed red blood cells, in addition with 2 units
of fresh frozen plasma.  He was also given 2 mg IV of
vitamin K, as well as 10 mg subcutaneous of vitamin K, and
his INR initially decreased from 2.7 to approximately 1.4.

He continued to do well.  He did not show any signs of
increased bleeding.  The following day he was given another
2 mg IV of vitamin K.  Approximately six hours after the last
unit was transfused, his hematocrit was measured at 32 and
remained stable for greater than 24 hours.  He was discharged
the following day after being seen by Vascular Surgery, who
had apparently explained to us that the patient will need no
further bed rest.

He will be sent home on aspirin only.  He will not be a
candidate for anticoagulation at least for six weeks to two
months, which can be re-evaluated in the future, but
currently his only anticoagulation will be aspirin 325 mg
p.o. q.d. for his atrial fibrillation.

FOLLOWUP:  He was told to follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 122**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in approximately four to six weeks.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  He was stable upon discharge without
any complaints.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Right groin hematoma, which remained
stable for greater than 24 hours with a stable hematocrit of
approximately 33 for greater than 24 hours.  No evidence of
current bleeding.  The patient was told to only take aspirin
and to discontinue taking his Coumadin.
