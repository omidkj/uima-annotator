HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted.  He had a
question of a small subdural hematoma on CT scan.  His blood
pressure was kept under 140.  He was given neuro checks in
the ICU.  The crit remained stable.  A repeat CAT scan showed
some blood in the third and fourth ventricles, worrisome for
hydrocephalus.  Neurosurgery followed along with us.  He was
having a rapid respiratory rate requiring increasing CPAP and
was intubated on [**2179-11-21**].

He remained easily arousable.  It was thought that he
suffered nosocomial pneumonia and he was given nutritional
support through a PICC line.  His temperature went to 102.4
and he did exhibit some rhonchi.  He was seen on [**2179-11-27**]
with a new ischemic stroke.  He was unable to communicate.

An MRI on [**2179-11-26**] showed an intracranial area with M2
occlusion, MCA with poor filling.  He had a cerebral
angiogram on [**2179-11-27**].  On [**2179-11-29**] he was essentially
unchanged.

On [**2179-12-1**], the patient expired at 12:30 with family at
bedside.  Because it was felt that there was a little chance
at independent living, care was directed towards comfort.
