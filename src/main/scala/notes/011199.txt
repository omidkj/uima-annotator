Pertinent Results:
[**7-31**] Cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this right
dominant system demonstrated 3 vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA had 60-70% distal stenosis. The LAD had 80% mid and
diffuse distal disease. The ostia of the LCx had 80% stenosis.
The RCA had mild disease. 2. Resting hemodynamic measurement
demonstrated an elevated systemic arterial pressure of 176/67
mmHg. The left sided filling pressure was mildly elevated with
an LVEDP of 23 mmHG. Simultaneous measurement of the systemic
arterial pressure and the LVESP revealed a 16 mmHg pressure
gradient across the aortic valve.
[**7-31**] Carotid U/S: There is a 1-39% right ICA stenosis and a
1-39% left ICA stenosis with antegrade flow in both vertebral
arteries
[**8-4**] Echo: Pre bypass: A small secundum atrial septal defect is
present. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %).
There is mild global right ventricular free all hypokinesis. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis
(area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild to moderate ([**1-11**]+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Post bypass: Patient
is being AV paced and receiving an infusion of epinephrine and
phenylephrine. Biventricular systolic function is improved- EF
45%. Bioprosthetic valve seen in the aortic position. The
leaflets move well and the valve appears well seated. There is
no aortic insufficiency and the peak gradient across the valve
is 99 mm Hg. Mild mitral regurgitation present. Aorta intact
post decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 12638**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2152-7-28**] for further
management of his myocardial infarction. He continued on
heparin, plavix, apirin, beta blockade and nitroglycerin which
kept him free of chest pain. He underwent a cardiac
catheterization on [**2152-7-31**] which revealed left main and severe
two vessel disease. Given the severity of his disease, the
cardiac surgical service was consulted for surgical management.
Mr. [**Known lastname 12638**] was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner
including a carotid duplex ultrasound which showed a 1-39%
bilateral internal carotid artery stenosis. The hepatology
service was consulted for risk assessment given his current
hepatitis C cirrhosis and his surgical risk was deemed low. A
dental consult was obtained for oral clearance for surgery. The
renal service was consulted given his renal failure.
Hemodialysis was continued. After completing an exam and
obtaining a panorex film, Mr. [**Known lastname 12638**] was cleared from an oral
standpoint for surgery. Heparin and plavix were discontinued in
preparation for surgery however on [**2152-8-2**], Mr. [**Known lastname 12638**] developed
chest pain with with EKG changes. He was returned to the
catheterization lab for the possibility of placement of an IABP.
As his discomfort resolved and his pressures were stable, a
ballon pump was not utilized. Heparin and nitroglycerin were
resumed. The podiatry service was consulted given his left foot
exostectomy with ulcer excision and bone stimulator removal.
Unasyn was recommended after dialysis to complete three weeks.
On [**2152-8-4**], Mr. [**Known lastname 12638**] was taken to the operating room where he
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to four vessels and an
aortic valve replacement using a 23mm [**Doctor Last Name **]-Magna
bioprosthetic valve. Postoperatively he was taken to the cardiac
surgical intensive care unit for monitoring. Hemodialysis was
resumed by the renal service as it was preoperatively, however
was unable to remove fluid secondary to hypotension. He was
transfused 2 units. He was extubated on POD #2. His hemodynamics
improved, his vasoactive drips were weaned and HD was
continued.He was transferred to the floor on POD #3. He
progressed well and was ready for discharge to rehab on POD #5.
