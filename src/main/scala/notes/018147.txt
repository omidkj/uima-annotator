Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
HPI:asked to eval this 64 year old white male with extensive PMH
on coumadin for SDH. Pt states he hit his head on a low ceiling
2
days ago.  Denies LOC at that time or since.  Denies N/V,
seizure, visula changes.  Today he noted that his speech was
slurred so he drove himself to his PCP's office. Was brought in
by ambulance from PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3726**]. CT scan shows right sided SDH with
interhemispheric component.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2111-5-14**] 10:22 PM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST; -76 BY SAME PHYSICIAN

Reason: S/P 2 SEIZURES, KNOWN SDH. ? EXPANSION.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
64 year old man with SDH, now s/p 2 seizures
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for expansion
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

STUDY: CT head without contrast.

INDICATION: 64-year-old male with subdural hematoma status post
two seizures, evaluate for expansion.

COMPARISON: [**5-14**], two hours prior.

TECHNIQUE: CT head without IV contrast.

FINDINGS: Again noted is a hyperattenuating collection along the
right cerebral convexity and layering adjacent to the right side
of the falx cerebri and tentorium cerebelli, consistent with an
acute subdural hematoma. There has been no appreciable increase
in mass effect from this collection. The major intracranial
cisterns are preserved and there is no evidence of
transtentorial or uncal herniation. There is no hydrocephalus or
evidence of intraventricular extension of blood products. Again
noted is opacification of the right maxillary sinus. There is
some hyperdensity of the central components in this sinus-
inspissated secretions or hemorrhage could both be considered.

IMPRESSION: No significant increase in acute subdural hematoma
or mass effect.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2111-5-19**] 10:14 AM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: change in mental status, decreased L sided movement

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
64 year old man with
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
change in mental status, decreased L sided movement
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

HISTORY: 64-year-old man with change in mental status and
decreased left-sided movement.

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT scan.

COMPARISON STUDY: Numerous prior head CT scans, the last having
been obtained on [**5-17**].

FINDINGS: There is continued demonstration of the longitudinally
extensive acute subdural hemorrhage covering the right cerebral
convexity surface, with a subtentorial component as well as a
parafalcine component. Overall, there seems little progression
in extent of the subdural hemorrhage. There is minor compression
of the right lateral ventricular body, not overtly changed
compared to the prior examination. There is no definite
subfalcine or uncal herniation noted at this time. There is
continued near complete opacification of the right maxillary
sinus. No other new extracranial abnormality discerned.

CONCLUSION: Stable but very extensive right cerebral hemispheric
acute subdural hemorrhage as noted above.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: s/p change of ETT. confirm placement

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
64 year old man with SDH, intubated for decreased mental status.
NGT replaced
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
s/p change of ETT. confirm placement
INDICATION: Endotracheal tube placement for decreased mental
status.

CHEST, ONE VIEW: Comparison with [**2111-5-16**], among multiple
previous other studies. Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube,
triple-lead biventricular defibrillator, and nasogastric tube
are unchanged in position. Heart shadow is enlarged but
unchanged. Midline sternotomy wires, clips, and stent along the
left heart border are unchanged. Bilateral perihilar fullness,
bilateral small pleural effusions, and left lower lobe
atelectasis are similar to the last examination. Osseous
structures are also unchanged.

IMPRESSION: Similar appearance of mild pulmonary edema,
bilateral small pleural effusions, and left lower lobe
atelectasis.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
