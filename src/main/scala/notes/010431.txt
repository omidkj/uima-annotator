Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever and mental status changes

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
hemodialysis

History of Present Illness:
65 year old man with a past medical history significant for CAD,
CHF, ESRD on dialysis, COPD, and hypothyroidism who presents
with fever and mental status changes. Patient is a poor
historian and was unable to relay much of story and patient's
wife was not available, so history gleaned from ED records. On
the day of admission, patient was noted by family to have
altered mental status and was unable to answer questions
appropriately. On review, patient states that he has had a
productive cough over the past several days and that "[he]
didn't feel right". After driving down the sidewalk today,
patient was brought to the ED by family.
In the ED, patient was febrile to 104, HR 80, BP 130/60, RR 20,
and oxygen saturation was 96% on room air. White count was 16.1.
Venous blood gas revealed 7.37/53/66. He received levofloxacin,
vancomycin, and flagyl. CT head was negative for intracranial
hemorrhage. CT abdomen and pelvis pending. Lumbar puncture
negative for infection.

TTE
The left and right atrium are moderately dilated. The estimated
right atrial pressure is >20 mmHg. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with severe global hypokinesis. No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The right ventricular
cavity is markedly dilated with severe global free wall
hypokinesis. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid
regurgitation.] The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. No discrete vegetation is seen (cannot exclude).
Moderate or greater aortic stenosis is not suggested (minimal
aortic stenosis may be present). Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**2-4**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The tricuspid valve
leaflets fail to fully coapt. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2166-4-2**],
the left ventricular cavity is slightly larger and the estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is higher. Valvular
morphology and the severity of regurgitation are similar.

TEE: Conclusions:
The left atrium is dilated. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is
seen in the body of the left atrium. No mass/thrombus is seen in
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. The right atrium is
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
LV systolic function appears depressed. Right ventricular
systolic function appears depressed. There are simple atheroma
in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. No vegetation/mass is seen on the
pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.  IMPRESSION:
No echo evidence of endocarditis.

LIMITED ULTRASOUND EXAMINATION OF THE RIGHT FOREARM IN THE
REGION OF THE AV FISTULA: Arteriovenous fistula is identified
with appropriate aliasing on color flow images and appropriate
Doppler flow. No fluid collections were identified abutting or
in the region around the fistula. There is no soft tissue edema.
IMPRESSION: Appropriate flow within the AV fistula with no
evidence of fluid collection or abscess.

CT ABD and Pelvis
1. Left inguinal hernia containing normal-appearing loops of
small bowel. The exam is somewhat limited without the
administration of oral contrast.

2. Multiple bilateral renal cysts appear unchanged, with single
exophytic left renal lower pole lesion, possibly representing a
prior RF ablation site.

3. Stable cardiomegaly and diffuse atherosclerotic involvement
of the abdominal aorta and its branches.

4. Cholelithiasis with gallbladder wall thickening, unchanged.

5. Anasarca with mild increase in intra-abdominal free fluid.
.
CT HEAD
No intracranial hemorrhage or edema.
