Heart failure exacerbation

History of Present Illness:
72 yo Aremian speaking male w/ post-infarction cardiomyopathy
(EF 20%) s/p BiV ICD, CAD, DM, PVD, AF who was admitted to CCU
after elective RHC showed depressed cardiac index of 1.4.
History is obtained with the help of his niece who acts as an
interpreter. He was seen by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in [**Hospital 3782**] clinic on
[**2105-2-3**] w/ complaints of LE claudication. It was felt that he
had critical limb ischemia but there was also concern for volume
overload and decompensated CHF. At that visit, his Bumex dose
was increased and he was brought to cath lab for RHC this am. In
the cath lab, he was found to have elevated filling pressures
and a CI of 1.4. A PA catheter was placed and he was admitted to
the CCU for further management.
.
Of note, patient notes worsening in his baseline SOB over the
last 2 months. Prior to 2 months ago, he was able to do very
little w/o SOB, but over the last 2 months has been SOB with
minimal exertion including going to bathroom and getting up from
a seated position. His niece notes he complains of SOB w/
walking 20 ft and cannot do stairs. Also notes orthopnea but no
PND. Over the last 2 months, patient also notes lightheadedness
and vision changes with change in position from sitting/laying
to standing. He has fallen due to these symptoms recently but
denies any LOC. ROS is also notable for > 1 year of LE pain and
sensation of cold LEs. He notes burning as well as pain at rest
and with exertion w/o significant difference. He also developed
a small ulcer on his R medial malleolus ~ 1 month ago for which
he recently completed a course of antibiotics given by his PCP.

Pertinent Results:
[**2-9**] PAC placement

The tip of a new right transjugular pulmonary artery catheter
projects over the right portion of the central mediastinum
probably in a large intrapericardial right pulmonary artery.
Transvenous right atrial and left ventricular transvenous pacer
leads and the right ventricular pacer defibrillator lead are in
standard placements. Some of the central hazy opacification on
both sides of the chest at the level of the hila could be due to
overlying soft tissue, but I suspect there is mild pulmonary
edema. Large heart is stable and there is no pleural effusion or
pneumothorax. Widening of the superior mediastinum is
longstanding feature probably a combination of mediastinal fat
and large head and neck vessels. No pneumothorax.

If there is any concern about malpositionning of the pulmonary
artery catheter standard views, including a lateral should be
obtained
-------------
[**2-9**] cardiac cath

COMMENTS:
1.  Hemodynamic assessment revealed elevated right-sided filling

pressures with RVEDP 27 mmHg.  There was significant pulmonary
arterial
systolic hypertension with PASP 80 mmHg.  The PCWP was elevated
with
mean PCWP 21 mmHg.  Cardiac output was significantly depressed,
with CI
1.4 L/min/m2.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Depressed cardiac output with elevated PCWP and elevated
RVEDP.
2.  Pulmonary arterial hypertension.

[**2-11**] cxr

FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**2-9**], the patient has
taken a much better inspiration. The cardiac silhouette is
essentially within normal limits, and there is no evidence of
vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute pneumonia.
Pacemaker device remains in place.
CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST ([**2105-2-15**], done for headache s/p eye
surgery):  There is no evidence hemorrhage, shift of normally
midline structures, or infarction. Encephalomalacia extending
from the left temporal subcortical white matter to the centrum
semiovale is likely a consequence of old infaction.
Atherosclerotic calcification of the cavernous carotids and
vertebral arteries are noted bilaterally. Surrounding osseous
structures are unremarkable.  A large mucus retention cyst is
identified within the right maxillary sinus. The mastoid air
cells are well aerated. The orbits appear unremarkable
bilaterally.
IMPRESSION:  No intracranial hemorrhage or edema.
Renal U/S ([**2105-2-15**]): 1.  Normal renal size, without evidence of
hydronephrosis. 2.  Slightly irregular renal contours,
particularly on the left, although much less apparent than on
prior CT.  This could relate to scarring from prior infection or
infarction.  3.  New trace ascites around the liver, and in the
Morison's pouch.


Brief Hospital Course:
72 y/o Armenian male with post infarction ischemic CM, EF 20%
s/p biventricular ICD, h/o atrial fibrillation, DM, PVD non
healing LE ulcers admitted with volume overload secondary to
florid heart failure on right heart cath, cardiac index 1.4
admitted for optimization of heart failure therapy prior to
vascular intervention

# Heart failure exacerbation

Post-infarction cardiomyopathy with EF 20%n s/p BiV ICD.
Elevated filling pressures CI in cath lab 1.4. PA catheter left
in place. No obvious events in recent past leading to current
decompensation. No significant change in wall motion on recent
ECHO. ? chronic progression of severe CMPY. Started lasix gtt
after 80mg IV bolus. Lasix gtt at 7mg/hr. On second hospital day
increased Coreg to 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] and increased to 10mg lisinopril
[**Hospital1 **]. By HD#3 patient had diuresed 5 liters with creatinine
holding steady, cardiac index rose to 2.08 and CVP decreased, CO
4. Patient developed renal failure likely secondary to contrast,
diuresis, and increase in lisinopril. Renal function improved,
did not require HD. Gradually patient became volume overloaded
and was placed back on lasix gtt with transition to oral
budesonide 4mg [**Hospital1 **]. At discharge he was at his baseline weight
and was given strict instructions on taking medications, low
sodium diet, daily weights. Patient to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**]
in [**Hospital 1902**] clinic on [**3-2**].
