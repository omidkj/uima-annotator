Chief Complaint:
chest pain and shortness of breath

AVR/MAZE


History of Present Illness:
63 yo M with CAD, known AS (EF 40%, Peak gradient 88, mean
gradient 54, [**Location (un) 109**] 0.7), Atrial Fibrillation s/p cardioversion on
[**2133-12-24**] who presents from [**Hospital3 **] ED with flash
pulmonary edema.

Of note, further history per him: he states he started to have
chest pain and shortness of breath this past Thursday and was
told by the RN to double his lasix from 20 po qd to 20 po bid.
He states, on Thursday through Saturday, he felt okay with this
medication change, however on Sunday night, he stayed awake all
night burping and had to sit up straight in his bed to breath.
He also complained of PND/orthopnea. This went away and then
again this PM, his wife and him went out to dinner and he ate
salty foods including baked potato and lamb chops and went home
to lay down in bed and awoke with chest pressure and feeling as
though he had to gasp for air. He was also diaphoretic, but
denied any N/V/LH.

He called 911 with approximately 1 hr of SOB/CP and via
paramedics, he was found to be in acute pulmonary edema en route
to the ED. He of note called Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with these complaints
and told to go to the ED stat. He was noted to be pale and
diaphoretic and initial VSS were BP 180/110, HR 120's, and 100%
on NRB. He was immediately given Lasix 100mg IV x 1, Nitrospray
x 3 en route and taken to [**Hospital3 **]. At [**Hospital3 **],
CXR was consistent with pulmonary edema and he was given nitro
tabs as well as he was started on a nitro gtt with BP falling
into 80-100's with HR 70's. He was also given Morphine 1mg IV x
1, phenergan, and albuterol. His nitro was stopped once his MAPs
decreased. His UOP with the Lasix 80IV x 1 was ~750cc. He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] directly to the floor for further
management.

He currently denies any chest pain or shortness of breath and
feels comfortable now. He states at baseline, he cannot walk up
steps without SOB and sleeps on 2 pillows which has been stable.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 63 you M with PMHX of critical AS (EF 40%, Peak Gradient
88, Mean Gradient 54, [**Location (un) 109**] 0.7), nonobstructive CAD, Afib on
amiodarone s/p DC cardioversion [**2133-12-24**], HTN who presents with
flash pulmonary edema to OSH and transferred here for further
management.
1. COR- non-obstructive CAD history.
- ?cause for chest pain likely from critical AS instead of
obstructive coronary disease.
- will continue to ROMI
- continue ASA for now, pt states has not been held yet
pre-operatively. Will need to discuss with surgeons in AM if
want to continue ASA.
- continue lipitor but increase dose to 80 qd (as too late now
but can help progression of AS disease)
- hold carvedilol temporarily as BP now 90's likely secondary to
overdiuresis and multiple NTG tablets. And pt is pre-load
dependent with his critical AS and thus should not bring down BP
too much.

2. PUMP- Critical AS with EF 40%, Peak Gradient 88, Mean
Gradient 54, [**Location (un) 109**] 0.7
- Possibly, pt in CHF secondary to high salt intake at dinner
today. However, pt has also been having chest pain for the past
few days and may have coronary cause for CHF.
- Pt diuresed will with over 750 cc out.
- Pt appears euvolemic to hypovolemic now and since pre-load
dependent, will not diurese further.
- Continue lipitor for critical AS
- AVOID nitrates in critical AS patients, will be cautious with
carvedilol and holding parameters for SBP<100.
- [**Month (only) 116**] be able to proceed with surgery as clinically not in CHF
anymore. Contact CT surgery in AM.
- ?cath in AM to further assess for critical AS pre-operatively.
Will keep NPO for now.

3. Rhythm- LBBB with LAD. Currently in NSR. Hx of Afib s/p
cardioversion [**12-24**].
- continue amiodarone.
- If afib recurs, consider repeat cardioversion.
- Coumadin was held per CT surgeons in anticipation for cath on
[**1-13**]. Will continue to hold for now. Can rediscuss with attg in
AM of ?starting heparin gtt.

4. HTN - pt now relatively hypotensive given overdiuresis, lots
of nitro.
- hold cozaar/carvedilol (with BP parameters) until SBP>100.

5. Hx of TIA- continue ASA, lipitor.

6. PPX- SC heparin tid, PPI
