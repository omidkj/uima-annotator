Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**]
Chief Complaint:
bile duct injury

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP with stent removal and placement of stent
Endovascular placement of inferior vena cava filter


History of Present Illness:
87y female with recent admission to an outside hospital for
cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, and choledocholithiasis.  She was
treated with antibiotics and discharged with the plan for future
removal of the common bile duct stone.  On the day of admission,
she had gone to [**Hospital3 3583**] for ERCP (with the intent of
having the CBD stone removed).  During the procedure, there
appeared to be a perforation of the common bile duct by the
stent, as dye was visualized extraluminally.  The stent was left
in place and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 61977**] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**4-27**] and admitted to
the hepatobiliary surgery service.  A GI consult was obtained
immediately for ERCP and she was taken for this procedure.  They
removed the stent that had been placed at the outside hospital,
and placed a stent across the common bile duct.  The stone was
left in place.  After the procedure, subcutaneous air was noted
in her back, tracking up to her neck.  She complained of
abdominal pain, which was in contrast to her pain free
presentation at the time of admission.  She was tranferred to
the ICU and a CT scan was done.  The CT scan showed a large
amount of air in the retroperitoneum extending into the
mediastinum and subcutaneous tissues. There was no definite
evidence of intraperitoneal air. Multiple pulmonary emboli were
noted in the right lower lobe, as was a small right-sided
pneumothorax.  She was started on Unasyn and watched closely in
the ICU.  She was kept NPO.  Her abdominal pain resolved.  She
was started on subcutaneous heparin, but she was not fully
anticoagulated for the finding of pulmonary emboli because she
had active GI bleeding (bleeding noted at the time of ERCP and
guaiac postive stools).  On [**4-29**], she was stable, and therefore
transferred to the floor.
On [**4-30**], a picc line was placed and she was started on TPN.  A
plan was formulated to keep her on TPN with bowel rest for two
weeks to allow her duodenum/bile ducts to heal.  Repeat CT scan
demonstrated improvement in the pneumothorax as well as the
retroperitoneal air.  On [**5-1**], she was transfused with two units
of blood for blood loss anemia.  On [**5-2**], an ECHO was done which
showed that overall, left ventricular systolic function was
normal (LVEF>55%). There were no clots or vegetations.
On [**5-5**], lower extremity doppler ultrasound was performed to
look for evidence of deep vein thrombosis, since she had known
pulmonary emboli.  DVT of the left femoral and popliteal veins
was seen.  She was started on a low dose heparin drip.  A
pulmonary consult was obtained to determine the risks versus
benefits of long term anticoagulation. They recommended 6 months
of anticoagulation, but given the fact that she still had active
loss of blood from her GI tract and because she was at increased
risk for falls based on her age and health status, they agreed
that IVC filter placement would be adequate treatment/prevention
for the time being.  A vascular consult was obtained and an IVC
filter was placed on [**5-7**].  After this, her heparin drip was
stopped.
On [**5-9**], she spiked a temperature of 102.1.  She was
pan-cultured.  A CT scan was done which showed improving
pneumomediastinum and retroperitoneal air.  No source was
identified on the CT scan for the patient's fever.
On [**5-10**], her TPN was tapered, and she was started on sips.  Her
picc line was removed.  On [**5-11**] the patient was restarted on her
home medications, her diet was advanced to clears, she was
started on IV vancomycin for a positive blood culture that grew
gram + cocci.  A GI consult was obtained to further investigate
her guaiac positive stools.  Her stool tested positive for c
difficle, and she was started on flagyl.  On [**5-12**], her blood
cultures grew vancomycin resistant enterococcus, and so she was
switched from vancomycin to linezolid.
On [**5-16**], she underwent a colonoscopy which was unremarkable - no
evidence of cancer, bleeding or collitis, diverticulosis, but no
diverticulitis
