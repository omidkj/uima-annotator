LABORATORY DATA:  White count 6.1, hematocrit 36, platelets
121, PT 13.6, PTT 30.8, INR 1.3, sodium 142, potassium 3.8,
chloride 100, CO2 20, BUN 46, creatinine 2.3, troponin 0.56.
ALT 14, AST 21, alkaline phosphatase 77, total bilirubin 1.2,
albumin 4, amylase 55. The patient had a catheterization done
and it showed saphenous vein graft to the PDA with 95% distal
stenosis, LIMA to the LAD was patent and vein graft to the OM
as 100% occluded. Circumflex was 100% occluded. LAD 100%
occluded and RCA 100% occluded with 95% left main.

Echocardiogram showed 3+ MI with an EF of 30% to 35%,
inferior and posterior basilar akinesis and inferior and
posterolateral hypokinesis.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Heart rate 62, blood pressure 136/71,
respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturations 94% on room air.
Neuro grossly intact, nonfocal examination. Cardiac regular
rate and rhythm S1 and S2 with 2 to 3 out of 6 systolic
ejection murmur. Respiratory clear to auscultation
bilaterally with a well-healed sternotomy incision. Abdomen
soft, nontender, nondistended with normal active bowel
sounds. No CVA tenderness. Extremities, right lower extremity
saphenous site from the ankle to the lower thigh is well
healed. No clubbing, cyanosis or edema. Both extremities are
warm and well perfused. Pulses - radial 2+ bilaterally.
Posterior tibial 2+ bilaterally, dorsalis pedis 1+
bilaterally. Femoral 2+ on the left. The right is covered
with a dressing.

Following much discussion it was decided that the patient
should undergo stenting of his occluded saphenous vein grafts
and then a minimally invasive mitral repair via right
thoracotomy. On [**1-7**], the patient was admitted
directly to the operating room at which time he underwent a
mitral valve repair of the right thoracotomy with No. 28 CE
annuloplasty band. Please see the OR report for full details.

In summary he had minimally invasive right thoracotomy. His
bypass time was 64 minutes with no cross clamp time. He
tolerated the operation and was transferred from the
operating room to the cardiothoracic intensive care unit.

At the time of transfer he had Neo-Synephrine 0.4 mcg per kg
per minute, epinephrine at 0.02 mcg per kg per minute,
milrinone is 0.4 mcg per kg per minute and insulin at 2 units
per hour, and propofol at 20 mcg per kg per minute. The
patient did well in the immediate postoperative period. His
anesthesia was revered and he was weaned from the ventilator
and successfully extubated. During he course of postoperative
day 1, he was weaned from his epinephrine drip, his milrinone
drip initial wean was begun and he was also slowly weaned
from his Neo-Synephrine. Additionally the patient's diuresis
was initiated.

On postoperative day 2, the patient continued to be
hemodynamically stable. His milrinone was weaned off and he
was begun on beta blockade as well as an after load reducing
[**Doctor Last Name 360**] to maintain blood pressure control. During the evening
of postoperative day 2, the patient was noted to have some
atrial fibrillation and he was begun on amiodarone infusion.
He remained hemodynamically stable on postoperative day 3,
however continued to have bursts of atrial fibrillation and
he was begun on anticoagulation at that time. The patient was
additionally seen by the electrophysiology service.

On postoperative day 6, the patient was noted to have
additional arrhythmias with several episodes of ventricular
tachycardia versus aberrantly conducted atrial fibrillation.
This was further evaluated by the electrophysiology service
and it was decided that the patient should undergo AICD
placement prior to discharge from the hospital.

During one of these episodes the patient was cardioverted to
a normal sinus rhythm. On postoperative day 7, the patient
continued to do well and he was transferred from the ICU to
floor 2 for continuing postoperative care. Over the next
several days his activity level was advanced. On
postoperative day 9 an AICD was implanted by the EP service,
dual chamber, [**Company 1543**]. On postoperative day 9 it was
decided that the patient would be stable and ready for
discharge to home on Sunday following the final dose of
vancomycin given to cover his AICD implantation.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  At the time of this dictation, the
patient's physical examination is as follows: Temperature 98,
heart rate 67, sinus rhythm, blood pressure 129/70,
respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturations 95% on room air.
Weight is 78 kg.  Neuro, alert and oriented. Moves all
extremities and follows commands. Nonfocal examination.
Pulmonary clear to auscultation with somewhat diminished
breath sounds in the right breast. Cardiac regular rate and
rhythm. Left upper shoulder incision is clean and dry. Dry
thoracotomy incision without erythema or drainage. Abdomen
soft, nontender, nondistended with normal active bowel
sounds. Extremities warm and well perfused with no edema. The
patient's condition at the time of discharge is good.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 8.6, hematocrit 29.4, platelet
count 242, sodium 136, potassium 4.6, chloride 106, CO2 18,
BUN 45, creatinine 1.8, glucose 174.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Status post mitral valve repair with
#28 annuloplasty band. Status post AICD placement.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  CABG x 3, ischemic cardiomyopathy,
congestive heart failure, multiple percutaneous
interventions, diabetes mellitus, renal artery stenosis,
chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline of 1.6, right
bundle branch block, glaucoma, hypertension, carotid disease,
hypercholesterolemia, hernia repair, peripheral vascular
disease with bilateral popliteal stents.
