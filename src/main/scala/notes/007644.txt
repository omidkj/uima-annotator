History of Present Illness:
87F with dementia, dm2, CRI, recent GI bleed who resides at
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and was found to be minially responsive. Of note,
she was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**6-5**] - [**6-13**] for duodenal
ulcer requiring 5U pRBCs now s/p EGD with epi and cautery. The
patient was at [**Hospital3 1186**] and was noted to become SOB at
around 11:30am. She worsened to the point that she became
unresponsive and hypotensive with BP 60/20, bradycardiac with
pulse 36. EMS was called and intubated the patient on arrival.
She was given atropine with effect, then paced to 70s
transcutaneously. Central line was placed in ED, patient was
started on dopamine, levophed, and neosynephrine. Initial labs
revealed a K= 6.08 (though hemolyzed), lactate 6.8. There was
also concern for BB toxicity as a cause of the bradycardia. Pt
was given calcium, glucagon, vanc, cefepime for empiric abx
coverage. She was transcutaneously paced in the ED for a time,
then her native rate increased to 50s in SR. Code discussions
were held with the patient's daughter and the decision was made
for full code status. The patient was admitted to MICU for
further management. She received 1L of IVF in ED.

Imaging:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2124-6-28**] 10:39 AM
The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but unchanged. There is a
persistent left retrocardiac opacity and bilateral pleural
effusions, left side worse than right. There is minimal
pulmonary vascular congestion. Calcifications of the thoracic
aorta are seen. There is a left-sided PICC line with distal tip
in the mid SVC. Left IJ catheter has been removed. The
nasogastric tube has also been removed.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2124-6-26**] 8:26 PM
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass
effect, shift of normally midline structures, hydrocephalus, or
acute major vascular territorial infarct. Atherosclerotic
disease overall does not appear significantly changed as does
small vessel ischemicc changes. Additionally, previously
identified chronic appearing right-sided subdural collection
does not appear as prominent on today's examination. Paranasal
sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated. Soft tissues are
unremarkable. No acute fractures.
IMPRESSION:
No acute intracranial pathology. If concern for acute ischemia,
MRI would be more sensitive evaluation.
.
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2124-6-26**] 8:27 PM
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The lung bases
demonstrate bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar airspace
consolidation. Limited evaluation of the solid organs due to
lack of IV contrast. The liver and spleen demonstrate punctate
calcifications. Gastrostomy tube is noted. The pancreas and
adrenal glands appear normal. Bilateral renal cysts. There is no
evidence of intra- abdominal bleeding. Severe calcification of
the aorta and its branches.
Limited evaluation of the loops of bowel due to lack of oral
contrast, however, no gross abnormality is detected.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The bladder, distal
ureters, rectum, and sigmoid appear unremarkable. Rectal tube is
noted.
BONE WINDOWS: Severe degenerative changes of the lumbar spine.
No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
IMPRESSION: Very limited study due to lack of contrast and
artifact from patient's arms. No evidence of retroperitoneal
bleed.
.
ECHO Study Date of [**2124-6-21**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No thrombus/mass is seen in
the body of the left atrium. The interatrial septum is
aneurysmal. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is 11-15mmHg. There
is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with distal septal, inferior
and apical akinesis. EF 45-50%. No masses or thrombi are seen in
the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There are
filamentous strands on the aortic leaflets consistent with
Lambl's excresences (probably a normal variant). There is mild
aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild functional mitral stenosis due to
mitral annular calcification. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
a small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic
signs of
tamponade.  Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2124-6-18**], no definite change. If clinically indicated, a TEE
may better exclude a cardiac source of embolism.

MR L SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2124-6-21**] 12:51 AM
MR L SPINE W/O CONTRAST; MR THORACIC SPINE W/O CONTRAST
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with question of cauda equina
syndrome, for further evaluation.
THORACIC SPINE:
TECHNIQUE: T1, T2 and inversion recovery sagittal and T2 axial
images of the thoracic spine were obtained.
FINDINGS: There are mild multilevel degenerative changes seen in
the thoracic spine without spinal stenosis or extrinsic spinal
cord compression. The spinal cord demonstrates increased signal
from mid thoracic region to the conus level with slight
expansion of the cord. The axial images, which are slightly
limited by motion, demonstrate central increased signal within
the cord. The findings are suspicious for ischemia within the
cord.
IMPRESSION: Increased signal within the spinal cord from mid
thoracic region T6 level to the conus, predom
