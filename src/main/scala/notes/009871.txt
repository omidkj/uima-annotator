Penicillin G Potassium / Ciprofloxacin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5790**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath
Cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2164-10-4**] Right thoracotomy and Right upper lobectomy for lung
abcess.


History of Present Illness:
52 yo M with h/o RUL abscess (E.coli in [**6-/2164**]), T2DM, chronic
pancreatitis, and other medical issues present today for
persistent worsening cough and the loss of his RUL drain on
Monday as he took his clothes off for a bath.  He reports that
he did not even feel the drain coming out.  It has not been
draining for 7-8 weeks.  He said that he continues to cough
despite being on oral antibiotics.  He coughs up green-white
sputum that is thick.  Reports increasing SOB, feeling tired,
poor appetite, unintentional weight loss (maybe ~20 lbs per
patient), and soaking sweats at times.

Of note, patient had a recent hospitalization for nausea and
vomiting while on cipro and flagyl.  As they switched off cipro
to cefepime, his symptoms improved.  Because he was considered a
poor candidate for PICC line and VNA does not cover IV cefepime,
he was switched to po moxifloxacin for the treatment of this
abscess.

In the ED upon arrival, VS: 97.6, 123/92, 117, 18, 99%.  He
received 2g IV cefepime and 500 mg po flagyl.  CXR showed RUL
abscess/pneumonia.  Pending blood cx.  The plan is to have him
evaluated for right upper lobectomy which was considered in his
prior admissions.  He might need pre-op evaluation tests
(?stress test, PFT, MRI, etc) per report.

On the floor, he appears comfortable in no acute distress.  He
complained of pain associated with cough.  There is also some
rhinorrhea, congestion, and occasional HA.  Also reports feeling
nausea but no vomiting.

[**2164-8-3**]: BAL : 3+: gram + cocci; E coli pan sensitive

Images & Procedures:
[**2164-10-11**]: ET tube tip is 7 cm above the carina. Right apical
chest tube remains in place. Right subclavian catheter tip is in
the lower SVC. Right lower lobe consolidation has worsened.
large left lung consolidation is unchanged.  Elevation of the
right hemidiaphragm is stable. Apparent loculated right
pneumothorax is unchanged. peripheral opacification in the right
apex is stable. Right middle lobe collapse is persistent.
[**2164-9-27**]
- CXR: Redemonstrated is a right upper lobe abscess with an
air-fluid level, which appears smaller in size compared to the
prior study, measuring approximately 4.5 x 6.9 cm on the lateral
radiograph compared to 8.5 x 5.9 cm on the lateral radiograph
from [**2164-9-6**]. The pigtail catheter has been removed in
the interval. The patchy airspace opacity within the right lower
lobe has also slightly improved, but remains concerning for
infectious process. The left lung remains clear. The cardiac,
mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. The pulmonary
vascularity is not engorged. The left PICC has been also
removed. Degenerative changes of the right acromioclavicular
joint is seen. Unchanged remote right-sided rib fractures are
again noted.
IMPRESSION:
1. Persistent right upper lobe pulmonary abscess, which has
decreased in size when compared to the prior chest radiograph.
The pigtail catheter has been removed.
2. Continued right lower lobe ill-defined airspace opacity,
which appears
slightly improved from prior, which is concerning for pneumonia.


[**2164-9-28**]
- Exercise Stress Test: The patient exercised for 7 minutes of a
[**Doctor Last Name 4001**] protocol and stopped for fatigue. The estimated peak MET
capacity wa 4 METS which represents a limited functional
capacity for his age. No arm, neck, back or chest discomfort was
reported by the patient throughout the study. There were no
significant ST segment changes during exercise or in recovery.
The rhythm was sinus with no ectopy. Blunted HR and BP response
to exercise in the setting of beta blocker therapy.
IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or ischemic EKG changes.
Nuclear
report sent separately.

- Cardiac Nuclear Perfusion:
SUMMARY OF DATA FROM THE EXERCISE LAB:
There is diffuse uptake in the gastric wall. Recommend clinical
correlation and/or endoscopy if indicated. Left ventricular
cavity size is 56 ml. Resting and stress perfusion images reveal
uniform tracer uptake throughout the left ventricular
myocardium. Gated images reveal normal wall motion. The
calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 59 %.
IMPRESSION:
1. Normal cardiac perfusion study.
2. Increased uptake in the gastric wall. Recommend clinical
correlation and/or endoscopy if indicated.

Chest CT: [**2164-10-8**]: Chest CT: New diffuse ground glass
opacification sparing the periphery involving the left lung ?
edema, hemorrhage, or ARDS. Increased right lower lobe
consolidative opacification since [**2164-9-8**]. Right middle lobe
collapse. Right upper lobectomy changes with residual right
upper lobe hydropneumothorax. Right-sided subcutaneous emphysema
and pneumomediastinum. Right-sided chest tube in place. New
right sided- small to moderate partially loculated pleural
collection containing air through which the chest tube
traverses. No central pulmonary embolism, though extremely
limited evaluation of the segmental and subsegmental levels
secondary to respiratory motion and artifact. Extensive
mediastinal lymphadenopathy, likely reactive. Stable
subcutaneous nodule.




Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 52 yo M admitted on [**2164-9-27**] for RUL abscess requiring
IV antibiotic and thoracic surgery evaluation for RUL lobectomy.
 Thoracic surgery evaluated patient and decided to go forth with
a thoracotomy and RULobetomy on [**2164-10-4**].  He was extubated in
the operating room, monitored in the PACU prior transfer to the
floor in stable condition.

Respiratory: his respiratory status was stable initially but
on[**2164-10-6**] he had an episode of desaturation in the 80's, cxr
