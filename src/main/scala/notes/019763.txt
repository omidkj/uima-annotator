History of Present Illness:
66 yo F with Castleman's disease s/p splenectomy, h/o anaplastic
thyroid CA, esophageal web/dysmotility s/p esophageal
dilatation, and recurrent aspiration PNAs s/p PEG presents with
hypoxic respiratory distress.  She was brought in by her
Caretaker who reports she ate candy this am despite being
strictly NPO.  She also reports fever and coarse breath sounds.


In the ED; Initial O2 sat was 70% on RA which improved to 95% on
a 50% Venti Mask.  Chest CT revealed no central or segmental PE,
new RLL > LLL consolidation with small right pleural effusion

received Levofloxacin 500mg, Metronidazole 500mg, Vancomycin 1g,
Albuterol and Ipratropium Nebs.  Blood cultures sent prior to
ABX.  Pt is refusing intubation but according to her HCP she is
a full code.  She is A&Ox3.  Currently she [**First Name3 (LF) **] SOB, CP,
cough, belly pain, nausea, and vomiting.  She reports low back
and bilateral hip pain at baseline.

PNA. Phlegmons vs. masses at bilateral sternoclavicular joints
are stable since [**2190-4-21**].


Brief Hospital Course:
66 yo F with Castleman's disease s/p splenectomy, h/o anaplastic
thyroid CA, esophageal web/dysmotility s/p esophageal
dilatation, recurrent aspiration PNAs s/p PEG presents with
hypoxic respiratory distress secondary to aspiration.
.
Hypoxic Respiratory Failure likely secondary to aspiration PNA;
likely chronic aspiration of oral secretions.  CTA revealed RLL
consolidation with effusion, no evidence of PE.  No evidence of
sepsis.  The patient was continued on non-invasive positive
pressure ventilation and did not require intubation.  She was
given vancomycin and meropenem (recent h/o pan-resistent
klebsiella except to meropenem).  She also recently grew
stenotrophomonas from her sputum - also started on DS bactrim
once a day in the ICU.  Her sputum grew MRSA only, and her
antibiotic regimen was adjusted to vancomycin only with good
response.  She remained afebrile although her white count
remained elevated.  As WBC started to rise again and the pt had
a new episode of hypoxia with a new LLL infiltrate on CXR,
Meropenem was restarted. A 14 day course should be completed. A
CT of her chest did not show any evidence of loculation of the
infection or empyema.
.
Leukocytosis: Pt was started on Meropenem and Vanco as above.
MRI of joints negative for septic joint and osteomyelitis. CXR
with new LLL infiltrate. Cdiff negative 3x. UA repeatedly
negative. TTE without evidence of vegetation. ESR/CRP markedly
elevated. CT torso without source of infection other than lung,
no evidence of loculation/empyema. Possible chronic
pancreatitis, but would not explain acute findings and had been
present in the past. All blood cultures were negative. ID was
consulted and followed the pt's course. WBC remained elevated,
associated with thrombocytosis, but as the pt was afebrile and
clinically stable, no further imaging such as a white blood cell
scan was obtained. Also, the pt would not be a surgical
candidate and therefore an occult abscess would not be pursued
at this point. A 14 day course should be completed ([**5-3**] day
1).
.
Conjunctivitis of left eye - The patient refused to have her
contact lens removed from her left eye even after being informed
that the eye was infected.  It was eventually removed the day
after admission.  She was started on vanco and erythromycin eye
drops; ophthalmology recommended continuing on current
treatment. Conjunctivitis resolved and treatment was
discontinued.
.
L elbow pain/L shoulder pain: pt with erythema, and painful ROM.
MRI negative for osteomyelitis  and septic joint in both elbow
and shoulder. Pt refused steroid injections in shoulder offered
by rheumatology. SPEP was repeated and was pending. A [**Month (only) 500**] scan
should be considered as an outpatient.
.
Acute renal failure - Pt's Cr was 1.3 initially; baseline 1.0.
Likely secondary to prerenal azotemia from infection and
resolved with IVF.
.
Hyperkalemia: Initially resolved after receiving kayexalate and
aggressive bowel regimen. Then controlled on standing
Kayexylate. No evidence of adrenal insufficiency. Possible
increased catabolism with overwhole wasting. No evidence of
acidosis/RTA. Changed tube feeds to low K boost plus.
.
Hypercalcemia.  PTH 49, probably supressed in the context of
hypercalcemia - possible high steady-state with parathyroid
hyperplasia/ primary HPTH.  No adrenal insufficiency. Changed
tube feeds to low Calcium boost plus. Peristently elevated.
As pt no surgical candidate at this point and surgery would be
extremely difficult given past neck dissection, will defer
Sestamibi scan and possible surgical evaluation for after
discussion about code and further management with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 2987**]/Pulmonary/Lawyers which is going to take place by the end
of [**Month (only) 116**]. A [**Month (only) 500**] scan should be considered as an outpatient. SPEP
was send and was pending.
.
HTN - Held BB initially given current infection. Then BP started
to trend up. CBB could be considered if persistently high.  BB
would not be a good choice as it can increase calcium as well.
.
Questionable Sz disorder -  Continued her home dose of Lamictal.
Pt at increased risk for seizure while on Meropenem.
.
Chronic pain -  Continued Gabapentin, Fentanyl patch, lidocaine
patch; pt required additional doses of oxycodone for elbow pain.

.
Hypothyroidism - Continued Synthroid.
.
Code:  Full. Discussion about code and further management with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2987**]/Pulmonary/Lawyers which is going to take place by the
end of [**Month (only) 116**].
