History of Present Illness:
57 woman with h/o CABG (emergent in [**2139**] w/ VG's to OM and LAD),
stenting of SVG to LAD in [**2141**] who initially presented to [**Hospital1 18**]
[**1-13**] w/ acute STEMI ([**Doctor First Name **] was SVG - LAD that was stented)
complicated by severe cardiogenic shock requiring IABP and
triple pressors, LCx with 90% stenosis unable to be intervened
on, 3+MR, apical akinesis with mural thrombus, recently d/c'd
from [**Hospital1 18**] ([**Date range (1) 24213**]) for hypotension and NSVT now s/p ICD
placement. She was discharged to rehab at [**Hospital1 **] but has been
feeling unwell for ~1 week with vomiting, watery diarrhea,
decreased po intake, and progressive weakness. She collapsed
today at rehab after using the bathroom and was sent to the ED.
She has not had chest pain, worsening shortness of breath,
fevers, abdominal pain or cough since d/c.
.
In the ED, she has a low-grade temp of 100.1. SBP initially in
the mid 50's. Right IJ placed under sterile conditions. She was
bolused ~ 1 liter total over a couple hours and started on Neo.
CVP ranged from [**6-26**] after fluids. UO minimal. She became
tachypnic and placed on CPAP 5/5 with good effect. Neo was
weaned off prior to transfer to the CCU.
.
She was noted to have a new transaminitis (ALT 933, TB 1.0),
acute renal failure (creat elevated at 2.4 from 0.8 on [**2-27**]),
leukocytosis (WBC 20.1), and lactate of 6.8. Her RUQ was
minimally tender; RUQ U/S revealed normal hepatic flow c/w
congestion. Guaiac negative on exam. [**Doctor First Name **] consult felt
transaminitis likely secondary to low flow state and unlikely
ischemic bowel given soft belly.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 57 F with CAD s/p CABG ('[**39**]), massive STEMI [**12-23**] c/b
cardiogenic shock s/p AICD p/w vomiting, diarrhea, poor po
intake, leukocytosis, acute renal failure, transaminitis and
coagulopathy. Status-post code/intubation for
hypotension/hypoxia, on 3 pressors, in multisystem organ failure
with a.fib with RVR.
.
## Cardiogenic Shock: She has class IV HF, EF 10-15%. CVP, PAD,
PCWP elevated, end organ damage. Now stabilized on dopamine,
after discussion with family and patient will not escalate care,
DNR/DNI. Will not withdraw current pressor support but will not
add. She has elected to go home with hospice services to be
comfortable and be with her family. She will go with levophed at
its current dose until she is out of the ambulance at which
point the levophed will be turned off.
.
# Atrial fibrilations with RVR: occured [**3-11**] with no decrease of
BP, broke with metoprolol, attempted cardioversion with her
pacer and externally with no success, will turn her pacer off
with EP as she is now DNR/DNI.
.
# Acute renal failure: Initially likely pre-renal azotemia in
setting of poor renal perfusion secondary to cardiogenic shock
but then developed dense ATN, likely secondary to shock. Small
improvement with lasix gtt and metolazone. Given goals of care
no CVVH.
.
# Mural thrombus on previous TTE and severe apical AK. Initially
coagulopathic due to hypotensive liver injury, now improved INR
but given goals of care no further anticoagulation.
.
# Ischemia:
CAD: Pt w/ CABG (VG's to LAD and OM in [**2139**]), PCI of OM-LAD '[**41**]
and PCI of acute MI (VG to LAD) [**12-23**]. She still has very tight
consecutive 90% lesions in prox and mid LCx w/ occluded VG-OM.
D/c Plavix since BMS was placed >1 month ago; aspirin 81mg daily
stopped given goals of care
.
## Valves: known 4+ MR.
.
## ID: Presented from rehab with diarrheal illness, rising WBCs;
reportedly a Norovirus outbreak at rehab, stool now + for
c.diff, on precautions, started flagyl for 14 day course but
stopped this on discharge given goals of care.
.
# Pulmonary: successfully extubated, maintaining sat with
minimal oxygen, maintain O2 sat >90, prn morphine for air
hunger.
