Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5608**]
Chief Complaint:
abnormal CXR, anemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation
central line placement
bronchoscopy
arterial line placement

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 84M with prostate CA, CAD, HTN who presents
with 2 weeks dry cough. He saw his hematologist who ordered a
CXR for the cough, and it showed extensive heterogenous
opacification in the right lung. Because of these abnormal
findings, his PCP told him to come to the ED for evaluation.

He has had the intermittent dry cough for about two weeks but
has not had fevers, chills, weight loss, change in appetite,
shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. He has noticed
some fatigue, as he used to walk two miles a day until the cough
started, but notes he is limited by fatigue, not DOE. No other
symptoms. In the ED he was noted to have a dropping Hct (25.4,
down from 29.6 the previous day). He has not noted blood in his
stool or had any lightheadedness. He was guaiac negative. He was
being worked up for anemia and was not found to have evidence of
iron, folate or B12 deficiency in [**2-4**]. SPEP was also normal.
After discussion with his PCP by the [**Name9 (PRE) **], he is being admitted
for expedited workup of CXR findings and anemia. Pulmonology was
consulted in the ED.

[**3-10**] PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
Multiple midline sternotomy wires are unchanged in position.
Small surgical clips are seen along the left cardiac border,
compatible with prior CABG. The two-chamber pacemaker with ICD
is seen with leads in the right ventricle and right atrium,
unchanged. There is mild cardiomegaly. The mediastinal and hilar
contours are unchanged. Pulmonary vasculature is unremarkable.
There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.

New, extensive, heterogeneous opacification is seen
predominately in the right lung, with peripheral consolidation
and lesser degree of central opacification. Right- sided volume
loss suggests a chronic process. Left basilar opacities are
compatible with atelectasis, and the left lung is otherwise
clear.

IMPRESSION:
Compared to [**2124**] study, new extensive heterogeneous
opacification in the right lung with peripheral consolidation
and lesser degree of central opacification. Loss of right lung
volume suggests a subacute process. Differential is broad,
including pneumonia, postinfectious and cryptogenic organizing
pneumonia, multifocal bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma, chronic
eosinophilic pneumonia, Churg- [**Doctor Last Name 3532**] vasculitis, amiodarone
toxicity.

[**3-11**] CXR:
No interval change over one day in appearance of diffuse
airspace opacity involving the right hemithorax. Additional
opacity seen in the left base, also unchanged. Original
differential diagnosis stands and multifocal pneumonia cannot be
excluded.

CT CHEST: FINDINGS
The patient is intubated. Pooling of secretions are above the
cuff of the
endotracheal tube. Small layering bilateral non-hemorrhagic
pleural effusions
are increased on the right and new on the left. Diffuse
extensive areas of
ground-glass opacity, peribronchial consolidation, and
bronchiectasis have
worsened in the left lung, minimally improved in the right upper
lobe. Right
central catheter tip is in the mid SVC. Transvenous pacemaker
lead terminates
in a standard position. NG tube tip is out of view below the
diaphragm. Dense
calcifications are in the native coronary arteries. There is
mild-to-moderate
cardiomegaly. The cardiac [**Doctor Last Name 1754**] are hypodense. This suggests
anemia.
Calcification in the aortic valve is of unknown hemodynamic
significance. AP
window and prevascular lymph nodes have increased in size; for
instance,
to 8 mm from 5 mm and to 5 mm from 3 mm respectively.

This examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic
evaluation, and the
upper abdomen is unremarkable.

There are no bone findings of malignancy.

In the abdomen, previously described renal lesion is not
included in this
examination.
IMPRESSION: Worsening of pre-existing opacity in the left lung
and slight
improvement of the abnormalities in the right upper lobe

The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cav
