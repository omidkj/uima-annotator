History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 61 yo F with PmHx significant for ESRD
on peritoneal dialysis, DMII, CAD, HTN, COPD, asthma, PVD s/p
bilateral AKA, s/p MVR, h/o PE, h/o MRSA bacteremia, h/o
endocarditis, breast ca s/p mastectomy, recently hospitalized
[**9-8**] - [**9-12**] with hypotension thought secondary to diarrhea and
poor PO intake, who presents to the ED with lethargy and
abdominal pain.  The patient is unable to provide history at the
time of ED presentation, but per her son who later arrived and
who lives with her, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] had been complaining of
abdominal pain for the past week.   Of note, she had been
administered 2g of vancomycin intraperitoneally [**9-13**] at [**Location (un) 4265**]
where she receives peritoneal dialysis (no gram stain or culture
data is available, and it is unclear from disucssions with the
renal fellow why antiobiotics were administered).  She
apparently only received one dose of IP antibiotics at [**Location (un) 4265**].
Per her son, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was evaluated for abdominal pain and
fatigue at [**Hospital6 **] ED several days prior to this
presentation for abdominal pain and lethargy, was given fluids,
though was not admitted.  Mrs.[**Name (NI) 14386**] son also noted drainage
and irration around the PD exit site and was told to apply
antibiotic ointment to the area, which he did.  However, the
patient continued per report to experience abdominal pain.  The
morning of admission was noted to be increasingly lethargic,
with worsening abdominal pain, and was brought to the ED for
further evaluation.

On ED admission, she was noted to be hypothermic (T=33.7 C),
hypotensive. (BP 92/50), tachycardic (HR 130s), and hypoxic,
tachypnic (RR in the 30s), with initial O2 sat 63% in the ED
(noted to be hypoxic in the field, started on NRB prior to ED
presentation).  Initial blood glucoses were in the 70s.
Unsuccessful attempts were made at placemet of femoral CVL, and
and left EJ IV was placed.  The patient was intubated for
respiratory failure.  She was given saline boluses for a total
of 4L of NS, with minimal increase in blood pressure.  Initial
serum lactate was 8.9.  The source of the sepsis was unknown,
though felt possibly to be a secondary to a peritoneal
infection, given her localizing symptom of abdominal pain:
pritoneal fluid was drained, revealing purulent fluid that on
analysis demonstrated 17,000 WBC, though negative gram stain.
The patient was given levofloxacin 500 mg IV, flagyl 500mg IV,
and vancomycin 1g IV (ceftriaxone was not given, as the patient
has a history of cephalosporin and PCN allergy). The renal team
was consulted, and the patient was also given intraperitoneally
2 grams of vancomycin and 30mg of gentamycin.  A surgerical
consult was obtained, with plans for removal of the PD catheter
when patient stable enough for the procedure.

As the patient remained hypotensive despite fluid challagnes,
she was started on Levophed.  A L subclavian central line was
placed. The patient was started on empiric dexamethasone as per
the sepsis protocol, and was also started on an insulin drip for
tight glycemic control.  Though an anion gap acidosis was
present, she was acetone negative.

As above, the decision was made by the ED staff to intubate the
patient for respiratory failure.  As initial attempts at
contacting family were unsuccessful, the patient was intubated
in the ED, and begun on CMV ventillation.  However, when contact
with family were acheived, the family (including HCP) stated
that patient had voiced a definite DNR/DNI advanced directive.
A family meeting was held between the ED staff and the family,
and at the wishes of the patient's family, the patient was
extubated.  Her post-extubation ABG was: pH
7.19/PaCo2=33/PaO2=66 (intubated ABG pH 7.20/
PaCO2=27/PaO2=470). The family (including HCP) again explained
that the patient was to be DNR/DNI, though they desired
otherwise aggressive medical therapy, including vasopressor
usage as necessary.

Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was also noted in the ED to have an irregular
atrial tachycardic rhythm that appeared to be new-onset atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (with rates up to
the 140-150s), with inferiolateral ischemic changes.   She ruled
in for myocardial infarction with a peak troponin I of 1.45,
peak CK of 704, peak CK-MB of 53, peak MB index of 8.7.
Attempts were made to wean off the Levophed as tolerated, given
its beta-agonistic effects, and she appeared to reconvert to NSR
with rates in the 90s-100s.  The patient was given further fluid
boluses (carefully, given the DNI status and ESRD), and
vasopressin was initiated to maintain adequate blood pressure.
As she has an aspirin allergy, no aspirin was administered (she
does however take Plavix).  Given her hypotension/sepsis, no
beta-blockers were initiated.
