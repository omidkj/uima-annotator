Pertinent Results:
[**3-30**] CT HEAD:
IMPRESSION:
1. Multifocal, multicompartmental intracranial hemorrhage, as
above,
including subdural, epidural, intraparenchymal, and subarachnoid
hemorrhage as
desribed above with rightward subfalcine herniation.
2. Comminuted, minimally displaced fractures of the squamous
portion of the right temporal bone, right greater sphenoid [**Doctor First Name 362**],
orbital process of the right zygomatic bone (lateral right
orbital wall), right nasal bone. Minimally displaced fracture of
the nasal spine of the maxilla.
3. Question of retained foreign body in right temporal epidural
hematoma.
4. Right supraorbital, extraconal hemtaoma with subsequent right
globe
proptosis.
.
CT CSPINE: no fractures
.
CT TORSO
IMPRESSION:
1. Right lower lobe consolidation could represent atelectasis,
aspiration,
pneumonia, and/or pulmonary contusion.
2. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. While discrete
discontinuity of the diaphragm is not seen and findings could be
due to volume loss in the right lower lobe, a diaphragmatic
injury is not excluded. This finding was
discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. [**Doctor Last Name 2319**] on [**2196-3-30**] at 3:15 PM.
3. T12 compression fracture, as above.
4. No evidence of acute visceral injury in the abdomen or
pelvis.
.
CT FACE:
IMPRESSION:
1. Comminuted, minimally displaced fractures of the squamous
portion of the right temporal bone, right greater sphenoid [**Doctor First Name 362**],
right orbital process of the zygomatic bone (lateral right
orbital wall), and right nasal bone. Minimally displaced
fracture of the nasal spine of the maxilla.
2. Right supra-orbital, extraconal hemorrhage with subsequent
right globe
proptosis.
3. Hemosinus and retained secretions post intubation.

Ct T-spine [**2196-3-31**]
Mild acute compression deformity of T12. No other thoracic
vertebral fracture identified

CT head [**2196-4-3**]
Status post left craniotomy/partial temporal lobectomy and right

craniotomy. Slight decrease in the amount of pneumocephalus and
mass effect on the left cerebral hemisphere. Persistent
low-density bifrontal extra-axial collections. No new
intracranial hemorrhage or shift of midline structures.

CXR [**2196-4-7**]
1. Improving basilar predominant opacities which may be due to
atelectasis or improving infectious pneumonia.
2. New linear focus of atelectasis in the right perihilar
region.

Bilateral LENIS [**2196-4-7**]:
No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg

CT Abdomen/pelvis [**2196-4-7**]:
1. Small bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar
consolidations.
2. No CT findings of acute cholecystitis.
3. Appendix appears normal distally and again measures 8 mm.
However,
minimal stranding along its portion of the appendix is noted;
early
appendicitis not excluded. Serial abdominal exam is recommended.

4. Tiny bubble of gas in the urinary bladder is decreased from
before, with interval removal of Foley catheter.
5. Unchanged T12 superior endplate compression fracture. Also
unchanged
elevation of right hemidiaphragm, without discrete
discontinuity.

Chest X-ray [**2196-4-10**]:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the band like
right
atelectasis is unchanged. On the left, the pre-existing areas of
parenchymal opacities show a further decrease in extent. On the
lateral radiograph, however, remnant opacities reflecting
healing pneumonia are still visible.
No newly appeared parenchymal opacities. No pleural effusions.
No pulmonary
edema. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. Mild tortuosity of
the
thoracic aorta.

LENIS [**2196-4-11**]:
No evidence of bilateral lower extremity DVT.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was intubated in the ER. After initial primary
assessment he was taken to the CT scanner and found to have
extensive intracranial bleeding.  STAT neurosurgery consult
obtained and he was quickly taken to the OR for decompressive
craniectomy.  Prior going to the OR he had an epistat device
placed intranasally to control moderate to severe epistaxis.  A
lateral canthotomy was also performed urgently in the ED.  He
then underwent right craniotomy, left craniectomy, and partial
left temporal lobectomy.  He was transferred to the TSICU.  Over
the next 24 hours his hemodynamics stabilized and he was taken
off of pressors.  He spiked a fever the following day and workup
revealed a likely aspiration PNA, BAL grew out GNRs and GPC
initially.  He was started empirically on Vancomycin and CTX.
He was then weaned to extubation and tolerated that well.  After
extubation he was AAOx3, moving all extremities, and able to eat
and drink. His Hct did drop from 30 to 20 over 24 hrs, however
he had no new source of bleeding, was HD stable, and was
presumed to be secondary to fluid mobilization and equilibration
from prior blood loss.  His Hct was followed, and he was not
initially transfused.  He was then transferred to the
Neurosurgery team for continued management on the step down
unit.

His other issues included:
1.) T12 fracture: a dedicated Thoracic spine CT was obtained
which demonstrated only a mild compression fracture of T12.
This was followed by Ortho spine who recommended he did not need
a brace and could come off of logroll precautions.
2.) C-spine: cleared by trauma team as his CT c-spine was
negative
3.) Facial fractures: deemed non-operative by plastic surgery
4.) Epistaxis: balloon epistat was removed prior to extubation,
there was no further bleeding

On [**4-5**] his antibiotic regimen was tailored to Ceftriaxone 1g
Q24 hrs. C.Diff was negative. ID was actively following the
patient and made recommendations for PO antibiotics. This change
was made on [**4-7**]. He continued to get prn Ativan for
intermittent agitation which seems
