Admission Date:  [**2193-5-22**]       Discharge Date:  [**2193-6-1**]

Date of Birth:   [**2126-7-31**]       Sex:  F

Service:  Cardiac Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 66-year-old
female who presents with a history of angina and
hypertension.  She underwent an angioplasty in the past and
stent placed recently.  An angiogram after the stent showed
an aortic valve disease.  Six months ago she was hospitalized
with congestive heart failure and treated with Lasix.
Currently she is unable to lie flat in bed or at least since
that episode.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Type 2 diabetes time five years
treated with oral medicines, hypertension, high cholesterol,
coronary artery disease.  In [**2162**]'s she had empyema, in [**2164**]
she had a Cesarean section.  Cardiac catheterization showed
severe aortic disease with less than .57 cm sq valve area and
coronary arteries without significant lesions and severe
diastolic ventricular dysfunction.  Her echo showed an EF of
25%, mild LVH, moderate LVH, aortic valve leaflets thickened
with stenosis, no regurg, 3+ mitral regurgitation with a
thickened valve.

MEDICATIONS:  Preoperative meds are Aspirin, Atenolol, Lasix,
Zestril, Premarin and Provera, Glyburide, Glucophage,
Lipitor, Paxil, Multivitamin and Motrin.  She has a rash
allergy to Sulfa drugs.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  So on [**2193-5-22**] the patient was taken to the
operating room where she had an aortic valve replacement
surgery with Porcine valve.  The indications for surgery were
an aortic stenosis with valve area less than .5 and CHF and
symptomatic severe aortic stenosis with shortness of breath
at rest, edema and occasionally cough.  She tolerated the
procedure well.  The day after surgery, when she awoke, she
was initially alert and oriented times three.  However, by
mid morning she was confused and agitated with some paranoid
features.  Her vital signs were stable with a heart rate of
between 80's and 90's and sinus rhythm with occasional APC's
and she had an episode of supraventricular tachycardia to
the 130's which resolved.  She also had a thick yellow sputum
cough and she was started on Captopril on postoperative day
#1, 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] for her ejection fraction.  Her postoperative
cardiac index was around 2.5, hematocrit 29 and she was alert
with some confusion but hemodynamically she was stable and
she was transferred to the floor.  On the floor she had an
episode of being found with sudden onset of unresponsiveness
with eyes deviated to the left side.  She had no verbal
output and was not moving her right arm and leg.  She was
transferred to the CTIC and was intubated.  She then
underwent a stat head CT which was negative for an acute
bleed.  She was awakened the next morning and she had gradual
resolution of the symptoms on the right side of her body.
Aspirin was given to her as well and she was kept with
systolic blood pressure around 140/80.
Anesthesia was called for the emergent intubation.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was made aware of this event.  The following day
she was extubated and continued to have improvement in her
exam.  She was not aware what had happened to her the day
prior.  She was found to have a right pleural effusion and
she had a chest tube placed which drained about 400 cc of
serosanguineous fluid.  She had gradual increase in her WBC
count from 13 to 24 and she was started on Ciprofloxacin.
She was being treated for E. coli in her UTI and sputum H flu
and found to have enterococcus and we added Ampicillin to her
antibiotic regimen.  The patient on the floor was kept on
Ampicillin and Ciprofloxacin and she had slow progression.
She was seen by physical therapy.  Her mental status changes
gradually improved and on postoperative day #9 she was
thought to be pretty much back to her baseline.  She was
afebrile.  Her WBC count was coming down and she will be
followed up at the skilled nursing facility, similar to where
she came from.
