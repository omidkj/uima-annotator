Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 943**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal bruising

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
45 YO F with alcoholic hepatitis and ETOH cirrhosis c/b ascites
and ESRD (T/T/Sa) thought [**2-14**] ATN with multiple hospitalizations
over the past several months for complications of alcoholic
hepatitis now coming in for expanding abdominal hematoma and
fatigue. The patient was last admitted from [**Date range (1) 29429**] for vomiting
blood. She underwent a diagnostic para with a LLQ puncture site
by IR on [**6-16**] to r/o SBP. She was discharged on [**6-17**] but returned
to the ED on [**6-19**] for persistent bloody leakage from the para
site and a small hematoma around it. Derma bond was placed on
the site and the bleeding reportedly stopped so the patient was
sent home. While at home, the patient had increasing fatigue and
noted a spreading hematoma involving the right side of her
abdomen and legs. Given worsening hematoma and fatigue such that
she was not able to go to HD as scheduled, the patient presented
to the ED.
.
Upon admission to the ED, her initial VS were: 98.4 123 126/54
26 100% RA. Exam was notable for a "well-appearing" female in
NAD with a hematoma spreading along her anterior abdominal wall
down to her lower extremities. She received 2u pRBCs and 2u FFP
and 500ccs NS. She was not given platelets. BPs dropped to 70s
systolic on one occasion with improvement by increasing her pRBC
infusion rate. Two 18g IVs were placed for access. Transplant
surgery was called and recommended transfusing and correcting
coagulopathy. Surgery felt there was no indication for CT A/P so
no imaging was done. The patient was admitted to medicine with
surgery following with consideration of surgical procedure
depending on ongoing clinical evaluation. Renal was also
consulted to arrange scheduled HD. VS prior to transfer: 98.4
106 103/53 18 97% RA. Although not documented, the patient
reports she had a rectal exam in the ED and was guiac negative.

.
Upon arrival to the floor, she reports feeling ok. She endorses
recent orthostasis and fatigue along with some shortness of
breath. She has some pain around her hematoma site.
.

CT a/p:
IMPRESSION:
1. New left anterior pelvic wall hematoma. Cannot assess for
active
extravasation without intravenous contrast.
2. Increased abdominal ascites.
3. Enlarging left pleural effusion. Bibasilar atelectasis or
consolidation.

Chest Xray:
.
.
[**2147-7-1**]:
-- FINDINGS: Bilateral asymmetrical airspace opacities involving
the right lung to a greater degree than the left have worsened,
and are concerning for multifocal pneumonia in the appropriate
clinical setting. Asymmetrical
pulmonary edema is less likely. Otherwise, unchanged appearance
of the chest.
.
.
[**2147-6-30**]:
-- FINDINGS: Cardiac size is top normal. Right central catheter
tip is in the right atrium. There is no pneumothorax. Diffuse
right lung opacities and opacities in the left lower lung are
new from [**6-16**] and partially visualized in the prior CT abdomen
from [**6-28**] consistent with infectious process.

Cardiac Echo:
-- Normal left ventricular systolic and diastolic function.
Mildly dilated right ventricle with normal systolic function.
Mild to moderate detected pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a very complex 45 YO F w alcoholic hepatitis and
decompensated cirrhosis w ascites as well as ESRD on HD. She
presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2147-6-22**] with fatigue, expanding hematoma
and approx 10 pt HCT drop following paracentesis. She eventually
developed respiratory failure necessitating intubation and
severe altered mental status.
.
.
# Acute on Chronic Anemia. Chronic anemia likely [**2-14**]
splenomegaly, ESRD, and possible bone marrow suppression. Acute
anemia [**2-14**] acute blood loss from hematoma. The patient required
multiple transfusions to resolve her acute anemia and correct
her coagulopathy but remained HD stable and demonstrated return
to baseline. The patient received approximately 20 u pRBCs, 18u
FFP, 2 u cryo, and 12 u platelets along with one dose of DDAVP
over the course of her hospitalization. Surgery was consulted
and recommended serial exams and correction of coagulopathy. The
patient did undergo CT abd/pelvis which revealed ascites but no
evidence of hemoperitoneum or retroperitoneal hematoma. She did
require narcotic pain control for pain related to the hematoma.
Following transfer from floor to unit, abdominal hematoma
expanded in size.  Patient received additional packed red blood
cells, fresh frozen plasma, platelets, and desmopressin to
maintain Hct > 21, INR 1.5 to 2, and platelets > 50,000.  Pt
also responded well to albumin infusions.  IR and surgery were
consulted. Albumin and PRBCs were given in the ICU to maintain
Hb>8 on t
