CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Nausea which is this patient's anginal
equivalent.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76 year old
woman with a history of CAD known to have mid-LAD stenosis
and diffuse disease of the left circumflex as well as the RCA
with subtotally occluded PDA lesion from a cath done in
[**2166-2-28**] at which time there was unsuccessful PTCA of
OM1.  Patient presented to the emergency room at [**Hospital3 6265**] where she complained of chest pain and shortness of
breath as well as nausea.  She was found to have a non-Q wave
MI and referred for cardiac catheterization.  Patient was
directly admitted to the cath lab.  Please see cath report
for full details.  In summary, cath showed left main with no
significant disease, LAD with proximal calcification and a
60% distal lesion.  Left circumflex was a codominant vessel
with moderate calcification, 90% angulated lesion at OM1.
OM2 had a 70% tubular lesion.  RCA also codominant with 80%
mid-segment lesion.  Patient continued to have angina during
the procedure and following catheterization.  An intra-aortic
balloon pump was placed.  Following balloon pump placement,
patient's angina resolved.  Cardiothoracic surgery was
consulted at that time.  She was accepted for coronary artery
bypass grafting.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery
disease, GERD, Billroth II secondary to peptic ulcer disease,
hypertension, hysterectomy, appendectomy, anemia,
hyperlipidemia, ischemic cardiomyopathy.

MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:  Included Lipitor 10 mg q.d.,
pantoprozale 40 mg q.d., Creon tablets one t.i.d., metoprolol
25 mg t.i.d., folic acid, nitroglycerin drip, Isordil 40 mg
t.i.d., hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q.d., Nexium 40 mg q.d.,
Altace 5 mg q.d., Coreg 12.5 mg q.d., Plavix 75 mg q.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Well appearing, well nourished woman
in no acute distress.  HEENT: pupils equally round and
reactive to light.  Moist mucous membranes.  Neck: no JVD, no
carotid bruits.  Cardiac: regular rate and rhythm with a left
sternal systolic murmur.  Pulmonary: occasional crackles
anteriorly.  Abdomen: positive bowel sounds, soft,
nondistended, nontender.  Extremities had no cyanosis,
clubbing or edema.  No hematoma or bruit at the cath site.
Skin was intact and warm.  Neuro: pleasant, alert and
oriented, nonfocal exam.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 7.3, hematocrit 24.8, platelets
260.  Sodium 130, potassium 3.7, chloride 97, CO2 24, BUN 22,
creatinine 1.2, glucose 78.  EKG left bundle branch block
with ST depressions 2 mm asymmetric in 2, 3 and aVF.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**11-29**] patient was brought to the
operating room at which time she underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting times three.  Please see the O.R. report for
full details.  In summary, patient had CABG times three with
saphenous vein graft to OM and jump graft to OM2, saphenous
vein graft to RPL.  Patient tolerated the operation well and
was transferred from the operating room to the cardiothoracic
intensive care unit.  She did well in the immediate
postoperative period.  She remained hemodynamically stable
throughout the day of her surgery and overnight.  On the
morning of postoperative day one patient remained
hemodynamically stable.  She was weaned from the intra-aortic
balloon pump and it was discontinued.  She was weaned from
the ventilator and successfully extubated also on
postoperative day one.

On postoperative day two patient continued to do well.  Her
chest tubes and Swan-Ganz catheter were removed at that time.
On postoperative day three patient continued to show slow
progress and she was transferred from the cardiothoracic
intensive care unit to the floor for continued postoperative
care and cardiac rehabilitation.  Over the next two days
patient continued to show slow progress on the floor.  She
was seen daily by physical therapy and with the assistance of
the nursing staff, increased her activity level throughout
that period.  It was noted prior to transfer to the floor
that patient had some left facial swelling and tenderness of
the parotid gland.  The ENT service was consulted.  They
recommended antibiotics and warm packs to the area and over
the following two to three days, the parotitis resolved.

On postoperative day six it was decided that patient was
stable and ready for transfer to a rehabilitation facility.
At the time of transfer patient's physical exam is as
follows.  Vital signs: temperature of 99.4, heart rate 70
sinus rhythm, blood pressure 140/60, respiratory rate 18, O2
sat 97% on 2 liters nasal prong.  Weight preoperatively 61
kg, at discharge 67.3 kg.  Lab data at discharge included
white count 9.8, hematocrit 33.1, platelets 140.  Potassium
3.9, BUN 30, creatinine 0.9.  Vanco level was 15.2.  Alert
and oriented times three, moving all extremities, follows
commands.  Respiratory clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Heart sounds S1, S2 which are distant.  Sternum is stable.
Incision with Steri-Strips open to air, clean and dry.
Abdomen soft, nondistended, nontender, normoactive bowel
sounds.  Extremities are warm and well perfused with 1 to 2+
edema.  Right saphenous vein graft site with Steri-Strips
open to air, clean and dry.  Left facial swelling is
resolved.  Patient still complains of minimal tenderness with
palpation of the parotid gland.
