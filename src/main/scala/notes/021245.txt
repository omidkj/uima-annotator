Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on the [**2149-4-16**] for a left groin
infection and concern for a graft infection. A CTA demonstrated
fluid surrounding the right graft and multi-loculated fluid
collections within the  psoas muscle.  No evidence of a
pseudoaneurysm was seen.  She was started on empiric broad
spectrum antibiotics.  Given Ms. [**Known lastname 59838**] overall health and
her history of heart disease it was felt that she wouldn't be a
surgical candidate for a graft removal. ID was consulted to
advise for empiric antibiotic treatment while cultures were
pending.  Aspiration of deep abscess material was obtained via
an IR procedure but cultures were negative. Superficial wound
swab cultures eventually  demonstrated different strains of
coag. neg. Staph. While in hospital she continued to be afebrile
and stable. She was put on an oral regimen of doxycycline.

Uro:
Her CTA on her admission day revealed an incidental finding of
bilateral hydronephrosis.  Following urology consult, a Foley
catheter was placed, IV fluid hydration initiated and creatinine
closely monitored; creatinine remained stable over the course of
her hospital stay and she didn't exhibit any flank or abdominal
pain. The patient is instructed to carefully monitor herself for
any new onset of belly or flank pain, that my warrant the
placement of a Nephrostomy in the presence of her graft
infection.

Neuro:
The patient exhibited signs of altered mental status, raising
concern that abscess fluid collections might cause  obstruction
of her VP shunt. Neurosurgical carefully reviewed her scan and
it was felt that her VP shunt is not affected retroperitoneal
fluid collection .

Heart:
On [**4-17**], the patient experienced a brief episode of sinus
bradycardia with a heart rate of 24 bpm. She was subsequently
transferred to the ICU for close monitoring. Cardiology was
consulted. Based on their recommendation, we temporary
discontinued all  AV node  blocking agents. Repeat cardiac
enzymes turned out to be  negative. The patients heart rate
returned subsequently to normal and she was transferred to the
floor where she remained stable.
Metoprolol was restarted on the [**2149-4-23**] which was well
tolerated by the patient.
The rest of Ms. [**Known lastname 59869**] hospital course was unremarkable and
she is being discharged to her extended care facility on
[**2149-4-24**] in stable condition. She will continue on e lifelong
course of antibiotics. ( currently on doxycycline  100 mg po
