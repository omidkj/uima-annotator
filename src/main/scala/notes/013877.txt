History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with COPD presents from senior housing s/p
fall.  A care taker who was visiting her knocked on her door and
soon afterward heard a thump.  The care taker opened the door
and found the patient on the floor alert and oriented.  The
patient reports that she tripped and fell, without hitting her
head or loosing consciousness.
.
At the ED, her initial vitals were 97.4, 85, 170/64, 23, 90%
4LNC.  A CT Head was negative.  Hip/femur/knee xray showed a
mildly displaced intertrochanteric proximal right femur
fracture.  Ortho plans to do a ORIF tomorrow [**9-11**].  In the ED,
her pain was controlled with IV morphine.  She got a total of
9mg.  Then she destaurated to 68-72% on a non-rebreather.  ABG
was 7.39, 50, 63.  It was unclear whether she was somnelent or
alert, but her respiratory rate was recorded to be 18-20 on the
flow sheets.  Eventually her O2 sat improved and was 89% on
venti-mask.  She was transferred to the MICU for closer
observation until she gets surgery tomorrow.

Pertinent Results:
.# CXR [**2116-9-10**]:
An S-shaped scoliosis of thoracolumbar spine is again identified
with degenerative changes.  The lungs are clear aside from
linear atelectasis/scarring within the right mid lung.  No
pleural effusions are seen.  The aorta is unfolded with wall
calcifications.  Slight opacification of the right-sided
superior mediastinum is stable, likely indicating tortuous
vessels.
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary disease.
.
# R HIP AND KNEE [**2116-9-10**]:
Mildly displaced intertrochanteric proximal right femur fracture
EKG: sinus 74 BPM, NA, borderline long QTc, large P in inferior
lead, no previous EKG to compare; no ST elevations or
depressions, no TWI
.
R hip [**9-13**] (POD#2)
IMPRESSION: Three views of the right hip show an ORIF device
traversing an intratrochanteric fracture of the proximal right
femur. The middle of three screws traversing the distal fragment
is obliquely oriented with respect to the other two. The
fracture maintains up to 5 mm of separation.
.
STUDIES:
# CT HEAD [**2116-9-10**]:
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.

Brief Hospital Course:
# RIGHT FEMUR FRACTURE: The patient is s/p ORIF R femur, with
pain well controlled with standing tylenol, and PRN oxycodone.
Orthopedics followed patient and recommended prophylactic
lovenox for 4 weeks, weight bearing and range of motion as
tolerated, and follow up in two weeks with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
# RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: She chronically lives with O2 sat at
around 88%.  She has O2 at home as needed  but rarely puts it
on.  Her ABG is consistent with her history of COPD since she is
hypercarbic with chronic compensatory met alkolosis.  CXR was
without signs of pulm edema or PNA.  Her oxygenation was
maintained initially with face mask and was then weaned to nasal
canula.  On discharge her O2 sat was 98% on 3L NC.  She is on
standing atrovent nebulizers with PRN albuterol.
.
# Acute blood loss anemia
10pt HCT drop (35-25) pre-op to post-op.  Stable for one day but
then dropped to 23 with increase in RLE echymosis, swelling and
pain.  Transfused with one unit PRBCs with rise in HCT to 28 on
day of discharge.
HCT should be followed up in 2 days.

# HTN: She was on procardia according to recent clinic notes but
her senior home records indicates that she has not been on it.
Currently normotensive without BP meds.
.
# HYPERCHOLESTEROL: continued outpatient pravachol
.
# DEMENTIA: continued outpatient exelon
.
# OSTEOPORISIS: continued outpatient calcium and vitamin d and
fosamax.
