CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Lower gastrointestinal bleed.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old
gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease status
post myocardial infarction times two in [**2134**], aortic
the past who was transferred from an outside hospital on
[**2137-12-5**] with hematochezia.  On the day of admission to the
outside hospital the patient awoke with sudden onset of
hematochezia.  He denies concurrent abdominal pain, nausea,
vomiting or shortness of breath.  After three episodes of
bright red blood per rectum.  The patient called EMS and
presented to [**Hospital3 **] with a hematocrit of 32.  In the
episode of hypotension, bradycardia requiring intravenous
fluids and Atropine.  He was sent to the Intensive Care Unit
where he was transfused 3 units of packed red blood cells to
maintain a hematocrit of 30.  The patient was ruled out at
[**Hospital3 **].  A tagged red cell scan was done at [**Hospital3 9683**], which was negative for bleed, but the tagged red
cell scan was repeated the next day and showed bleeding
throughout the mid transverse colon.  At [**Hospital1 **] he was
evaluated by both the GI Service as well as Surgery, however,
the patient elected not to pursue surgical interventions.  He
was electively transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2137-12-5**] at the
family's request.

breaths per minute.  98% saturation on room air.  In general,
the patient was awake and alert, pleasant.  HEENT examination

Neurological examination the patient was alert and oriented
times three.  Cranial nerves II through XII intact.  Upper
and lower extremity 5 out of 5 strength equal bilaterally.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  The patient's white blood cell
count was 9.0.  The patient's hematocrit 29.1, platelet count
94, sodium 138, potassium 3.1, chloride 106, bicarbonate 22,
BUN 22, creatinine .8, glucose 99.  Coags from the previous
day at [**Hospital3 **], PT 13.8, INR 1.2, PTT 26.6.  The
patient's iron studies, iron 75, ferritin 71, MCV 88, TIBC
424, TRF 326, folate 17, B-12 654, TSH was drawn at 2.6.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.  The patient was placed on intravenous
Protonix b.i.d.  The patient was transfused to keep his
hematocrit greater then 30.  Both the GI Service and the
Surgical Service were consulted.  The patient's hematocrit
was checked q 6 hours initially.  The Interventional
Radiology Service was consulted and due to the fact that the
patient was not actively bleeding initially at [**Hospital1 **] the
decision was made that angiography should not be done at that
time and that a tagged red blood cell scan would be
appropriate.  In the evening on hospital day one ([**2137-12-5**]),
the patient had one episode of 300 cc of bright red blood per
rectum.  The patient was started on Golytely prep and the
patient's hematocrit was stable at 31.  On hospital day two
the patient's hematocrit was 27.5.  The patient was
transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells.  The tagged red
blood cell scan done at [**Hospital3 **] was negative.

The patient was seen by surgery and again expressed his
wishes not to have surgical intervention.  The GI Service had
indicated that a colonoscopy would be performed.  On [**2137-12-7**]
(hospital day three), the patient was transferred from the
MICU to the floor.  His hematocrit had been stable at 34 over
the last two draws.  Upon transfer to the floor the patient
had one large maroon stool.  His p.m. hematocrit was down to
31.0 from 34.6 the previous day.  The patient was feeling
well and asymptomatic.  A.m. laboratories on [**12-8**] revealed a
hematocrit down to 29.8 from the previous value of 31.0.  The
patient was transfused one unit of blood over four hours.  In
the evening on [**2137-12-8**] during his bowel prep, the patient
again passed a large dark red bowel movement, which was
thought to be a rebleed.  The patient underwent a fourth
tagged red cell scan, which was negative.  The patient was
transfused a second unit of blood overnight.

On hospital day five ([**2137-12-9**]) the patient underwent a
colonoscopy by the GI Service.  The findings revealed
nonbleeding grade two internal hemorrhoids and multiple
nonbleeding diverticuli with large openings were seen in the
sigmoid, descending transverse and ascending colon.  The
impression was that the previous bleeding episode was likely
due to a diverticular bleed.  However, there was no active
bleed at the time.  The patient was again offered the
possibility of surgical intervention, however, declined.  On
[**12-9**] the patient's hematocrit was stable at 37.0.  The
patient remained asymptomatic without further GI bleed on
[**12-9**] through [**12-10**].  On [**2137-12-10**] hospital day six a small bowel
follow through was performed to examine for the possibility
of small bowel bleed.  The results of the small bowel follow
through are pending at this time.

The patient's care at this time was assumed by the Geriatric
Service attending Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  The patient's hematocrit
on [**2137-12-10**] was stable at 35.2.  On [**2137-12-10**] the patient was
restarted on his Lasix and his Enalapril was resumed at his
previous dose of 10 mg po b.i.d.  Rehab screening was
beginning for an anticipated discharge on [**2137-12-11**].  The
patient had an uneventful night on the [**12-10**].  The patient was
seen by the Physical Therapy Service who determined that the
patient would benefit from a short course of rehab.  The
patient is discharged on [**2137-12-11**] to rehab in the [**Hospital1 1501**] unit at
[**Location (un) 5481**] in good condition prior to returning to his [**Last Name (un) **].
