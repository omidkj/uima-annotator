History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname 24039**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old spanish speaking nursing home male with
PMHx significant for CAD with prior MI s/p stent to LAD in early
[**2183**], pacemaker [**2186**] for sick sinus, MR, COPD, PUD, asthma,
gout, diverticultitis, a fib, CHF EF 35%, and a recent
hospitalization at the OSH from [**Date range (1) 112121**] for PNA requiring
intubation and mechanical ventilation who presents as a transfer
from an OSH with Monomorphic VT. He initially presented to the
OSH from his nursing home on [**7-27**] with SOB x48 hours and feeling
weak, also complained of sharp pains in his stomach. In the ED
he was hypotensive with SBP in the 70s and he was started on
levophed and broad spectrum Abx. The patient remained a-febrile
and ID recomended stoping Abx as his CXR was unchanged from his
past hospitalization. He was weaned off levophed in the ED with
stable BPs in the 110s. He had a V/Q scan that showed
intermediate prob of PE, U/S negative for DVT. He was placed on
heparin drip. He was sent to the floor. At 3pm on [**7-28**] he
developed VT to 200-250s. He was mentating well at this time but
he was DC cardioverted and given amiodarone. He converted to his
baseline EKG and per report there were no EKG changes.  30 min
later he again went into VT, and cardioverted again without
conversion. 2grams Mg and 150mg Amio. 50mcg lidocaine and
started on lidocaine drip. Converted back to a-fib. No change in
his BP during these events. Transfered to the CCU where he
became hypotensive to SBPs 60s. He was started on lidocaine,
amio, dopa and devolped wide complex tachy with rates 150
sometime after 7pm. They increased his lidocaine to 2mg and he
converted to a fib with rates in 60s, 50% pacer dependent. He
was changed to neo drip, off dopamine, still on amio and lido at
time of trasfer. Also of note per report, pacer working
properly. He also had an episode of vomiting, followed by BP
decreased requiring the above start of dopamine and then
switched to neo. Per the family, vomitus was dark red,
concerning for blood.

At the OSH his labs were notable for troponin of 1.2 that
trended to 0.6, a positive d-dimer.

Vitals on transfer were not given. Per report the patients SBP
was in the 90s.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient was minimally responsive. He
was very cool to the touch and it was difficult to obtain an
accurate BP, O2 sat or temperature. His urine output since 7pm
was noted to be only 31 cc.
