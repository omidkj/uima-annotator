Admission Date:  [**2179-1-9**]     Discharge Date:  [**2179-1-18**]

Date of Birth:   [**2114-11-15**]     Sex:  F

Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 64-year-old woman with usual
state of health until two days prior to admission who began
to experience right-sided abdominal pain radiating into the
right shoulder without the symptoms of fevers, chills,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or any urinary
difficulties.  The patient presented initially to [**Hospital 16843**]
Hospital, where a CT of the abdomen demonstrated a right
kidney soft tissue mass approximately 10 cm in diameter with
an adjacent fluid collection.  She initially became
hypotensive and was started on vasopressors at which point
she was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**]
by Life Flight.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Asthma.
2. History of urinary tract infections.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Unknown.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Lisinopril.
2. Vioxx.
3. Advair.
4. Lasix.
5. Pulmicort.
6. Tylenol prn.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On presentation, temperature 96.4,
heart rate 119, blood pressure 86/54, respiratory rate 22,
and saturating 98% on nonrebreather mask.  In general:
Ill-appearing obese female.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate
and rhythm without murmur.  Respiratory:  Clear to
auscultation bilaterally without wheezes.  Abdomen is obese,
soft, and nontender.  Extremities without edema.

INITIAL DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:  Laboratories from the outside
facility revealed a white count of 18.8 with 71% neutrophils,
hematocrit 31.7, platelets 616.  Chemistries:  Sodium 135,
potassium 5.6, chloride 98, bicarbonate 22, BUN 46,
creatinine 2.5, glucose 172.  Liver function tests
significant for alkaline phosphatase of 274, lipase within
normal limits.  Urinalysis:  With too numerous to count white
and red cells per high power field, 4+ bacteria.

CT of the abdomen dated [**2179-1-9**]:  Right hydronephrosis, 4
cm right anterior perirenal fluid collection concerning for
abscess.  Small right pleural effusion.  Small amount of
ascites adjacent to the liver.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM LIST:
1. Urosepsis with right perinephric collection:  The patient
was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit, and was aggressively
resuscitated.  During the resuscitation, it was felt that
orotracheal intubation was necessary given the patient's
unstable status and metabolic acidosis.  The patient was
placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics and was maintained on
Levophed as a vasopressor.  She was also given hydrocortisone
and fludrocortisone given her apparent septic shock.

Interventional Radiology was asked to drain the perinephric
collection using CT-guided catheter placement.  This
procedure was performed on [**2179-1-9**], and the specimen
was sent for Gram stain and culture.  Both Surgery and
Urology were asked to see the patient in consultation on
hospital day one.  Given the patient's unstable status, it
was felt that there was no acute need for operative
intervention until she was adequately resuscitated and
stabilized.

The Urology service requested a MRI to better visualize the
nature of the perinephric collection.  However, secondary to
the patient's body habitus, we were unable to utilize the
inpatient MRI scanner at [**Hospital1 188**].  Repeat CT of the pelvis without contrast was
obtained on hospital day three, that showed a slight interval
decrease in the collection.  The fluid cultures were obtained
from the CT-guided drainage.  Grew out pansensitive E. coli.
The patient was maintained on ampicillin, ceftriaxone, and
Flagyl.  Patient remained on and off vasopressors over the
remaining hospital days, and per Urology's request on [**2179-1-13**], the patient went for further Interventional
Radiology studies during which time samples of the right
perinephric collection were obtained, and a second drainage
catheter was placed.

Despite appropriate antimicrobial therapy and a second
attempt at drainage, the patient failed to regain hemodynamic
stability and was requiring increasing use of vasopressors
with a rise in white count.  On hospital day 10, the surgical
service was in consultation, who felt that she remained too
unstable for operative intervention.  Unstable her declining
clinical course despite maximum medical management and
inability to obtain stability necessary for operative
intervention was discussed at length with the family with a
decision to withdraw care was made during a discussion with
the Intensive Care Unit fellow and the patient's extended
family.

Soon after comfort measures were initiated, the patient was
pronounced dead at 19:20 on [**2179-1-18**].

2. Acute renal failure:  The patient was found to be in acute
renal failure on presentation.  Had a slightly decreasing
creatinine throughout her hospital course, although her
creatinine remained elevated throughout management during her
Intensive Care Unit stay.  The etiology was thought to be
prerenal versus obstructive, and was maximally medically
managed following creatinine, urine output and intake and
output balances.

3. Atrial fibrillation:  Patient developed atrial
fibrillation on hospital day two, and was intermittently
managed with calcium-channel blockers, carefully balanced
with a need for vasopressors.  The patient was initially
placed on Heparin drip for her paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation.  However, this therapy was subsequently
discontinued and reinitiated several times over ICU course
given her repeated need for procedure intervention.

4. Respiratory failure:  Patient was initially intubated
given her unstable clinical picture and metabolic acidosis.
Given the patient's overall clinical picture, the patient was
maintained on mechanical ventilation throughout her Intensive
Care Unit course until the decision was made to withdraw
care.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Deceased.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  As above.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Urosepsis.
2. Respiratory failure.
3. Perinephric abscess.
4. Acute renal failure.
5. Atrial fibrillation.
6. Anemia.
