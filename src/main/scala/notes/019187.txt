[**2121-8-22**] 15:27 ECHO

The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. The right atrial pressure is indeterminate.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at
the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is mild aortic
valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

[**2121-8-22**] CXR
In comparison with the study of [**2121-8-21**], there is again
enlargement
of the cardiac silhouette with evidence of some pulmonary
vascular congestion. Areas of increased opacification are seen
at both bases with apparent silhouetting the hemidiaphragm. This
most likely represents combination of atelectasis and effusion,
though superimposed pneumonia be definitely excluded.

Brief Hospital Course:
71F with PMH of CHF, depression, AAA, GERD presenting with
altered mental status and hypotension, found to have sepsis
likely due to a multi-lobar pneumonia admitted to the ICU for
two days and transferred to medical floor on [**2121-8-22**]. She did
not require tracheal intubation in the ICU.

1. Pneumonia: Urine legionella negative, blood cultures (NGTD
from [**8-20**], viral culture negative. Patient improved on
Vanc/Zosyn with steady improvement in her oxygen saturation to
normal on RA at the time of discharge. She received an 8day
course of antibiotics, then they were discontinued.  Oxygen was
given and eventually weaned off.  Asnoted above, she did not
require tracheal intubation in the ICU.

2. Dyspnea: Likely multifactorial due to pneumonia, and a
component of diastolic congestive heart failure with volume
resuscitation in the ER. Initial BNP elevated, and blood
tests/EKG did not reveal suggestive myocardial injury. Patient
responded well to intermittent doses of Lasix 10mg IV.

3. Hypertension: Pt had episodes of hypotension at presentation;
on the general medicine floor she remained intermitently
hypertensive to SBP=180 despite Labetalol 200mg [**Hospital1 **], which is
her home regiment. Elevated values tended to be right before
next dose of medicine is given; otherwise relatively
well-controlled.  on discharge =150s/70s

4. Chronic diastolic CHF: TTE obtained this hospitalization
showed EF>55%, no echocardiographic evidence of diastolic
dysfunction, only mild LVH on TTE. She was continued on
Labetalol as above for BP and rate control.

5. Anemia: Hct improved slowly to 31 at the time of discharge,
MCV=89, baseline unknown. Given MCV, likely due to anemia of
chronic disease, eval studies were consistent with this.

6. Lumbar disc disease - s/p lumbar surgery.  Back pain was
slightly worse in hospital and so her Oxycontin to increased to
40mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**8-27**] with good effect.  Not requireing breakthrough
pain.  Valium was decreased to 2mg [**Hospital1 **], and she's being
discharged on 2mg once daily prn anxiety. She has not displayed
high levels of anxiety, though the valium had been given to her
prior to hospitalization more to help any spasm component of her
back pain.
