HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female who
has a history of hypertension, congestive heart failure, and
aortic stenosis.  She was admitted in [**2179-4-2**], to
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 620**] with congestive heart failure and was
readmitted with left lower lobe pneumonia and congestive
heart failure from [**2180-5-4**], to [**2180-5-8**].  She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
cardiac catheterization and underwent catheterization on
[**2180-5-9**], which revealed left ventricular ejection fraction
of 60%, ascending aorta 0.47 centimeters squared, coronaries
without disease.  Echocardiogram at the outside hospital
revealed affect gradient of 62 mmHg and an ejection fraction
of 25%.  She was also noted to have moderate mitral
regurgitation and mild tricuspid regurgitation  She is now
being evaluated for aortic valve repair.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfonamides.

ALLERGIES:  The patient lives in an [**Hospital3 **] facility
in [**Location (un) 620**]. She is a nonsmoker and does not drink alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is 98.6, heart rate 110,
blood pressure 122/68, oxygen saturation 96% on two liters.
In general, the patient is a pleasant, thin, elderly woman in
no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat -
Conjunctiva erythematous.  The pupils are 2.0 millimeters.
Neck - delayed upstroke, carotids bilaterally.  The heart is
regular rate and rhythm, III/VI soft systolic ejection
murmur.  The abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended.
Extremities - 1+ bilaterally pitting edema.  Symmetrical 2+
dorsalis pedis pulses.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted on
[**2180-5-9**], and treated by the medicine team and also seen by
cardiology who recommended cardiothoracic surgery
consultation.  Cardiothoracic surgery saw the patient on
[**2180-5-10**], and also recommended an aortic valve replacement.

The patient was taken to the operating room on [**2180-5-11**], and
underwent aortic valve replacement with a 21 millimeter C/A
pericardial valve by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**]. The operation was
complicated by a partial aortic dissection which was
repaired.

Postoperatively, the patient required a Dobutamine and
Propofol drip.  Also, postoperatively, the patient was
started on Neo-Synephrine drip and Dobutamine drip.  The
patient was sent to the operating room with mediastinal chest
tubes and pacing wires.  She also received perioperative
antibiotic.  Postoperatively, the patient had an episode of
arrhythmia requiring an Amiodarone drip.

The patient at appropriate times had her chest tubes and
pacing wires removed.  Her Vancomycin perioperatively and
antimicrobial prophylaxis was stopped after four doses.  The
patient was started on beta blocker and Lasix.  When the
patient was stable, the patient was transferred to the
regular cardiothoracic floor.  Her pacing wires were
discontinued.  The atrial wires required cutting because they
were tied into the atrial muscle.  The ventricular wires were
removed.

On postoperative day six, the patient had an episode in which
her white blood cell count increased to 20.5.  House officer
was called to the scene while the patient had decreased
oxygen saturation, labile blood pressure and excessive low
pelvic pain.  The Foley catheter was manipulated and
immediately 350cc of urine flowed.  The patient's pain
quickly improved although after some time the pelvic pain
returned and the patient continued to have fluctuating blood
pressure and she was sent back to the Intensive Care Unit
where her condition spontaneously improved as her urine
output was maintained with a patent Foley catheter.  The
patient was therefore seen by urology who indicated they
would like to follow-up on the patient's condition although
not in the acute setting.  They requested that the Foley
catheter be left until the patient was able to use the rest
room on her own and the patient be started on empiric
Levofloxacin therapy.  This was done, however, the Foley
catheter was removed and she will be electively straight
catheterized because there is a great concern of seating her
aortic valve due to urinary tract infection.  The patient
when straight catheterized was noted to have a quite
prominent yeast infection and the patient was given
Miconazole cream, Miconazole suppositories and one dose of
Diflucan 150 mg.  The patient did well with the straight
catheterization and has been free of any cardiac episodes or
respiratory episodes.

It is now [**2180-5-20**], and the patient is being discharged to
rehabilitation center.  She is to avoid strenuous activity.
She is to avoid baths but may shower.  She may not drive
while on pain medication.  She should be straight
catheterized every six hours and p.r.n.

FOLLOW-UP:  She is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 261**] of the
urology department in approximately two weeks.  She is to
follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**] in four weeks.  She is to
follow-up with her primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5293**], in one to two weeks.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Miconazole vaginal suppositories, one application
vaginally for seven days.
2.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. twice a day for seven days and need for
Lasix to be reassessed.
3.  Nystatin Ointment topically applied four times a day
p.r.n.
4.  Levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. once daily until her urological
issue is sorted out.
5.  Lopressor 25 mg p.o. twice a day.
6.  Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day.
7.  Atorvastatin 10 mg p.o. once daily.
8.  Cholestyramine 4 grams p.o. three times a day.
9.  Albuterol Ipratropium two puffs inhaled q6hours.
10. Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o. once daily.
11. Percocet one tablet p.o. q6hours p.r.n. pain.
12. Enteric Coated Aspirin 325 mg p.o. once daily.
13. Potassium Chloride 20 meq p.o. q12hours for seven days to
have need reassessed thereafter.
