Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8747**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH with ICH.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of a PEG tube.


History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 74 year-old woman of undetermined handedness who
presented with altered mental status.

The pt was unable to offer a history at the time of admission
due to profound encephalopathy.  Therefore, the initial history
was per the primary team and the available medical record.

Per the record, she was found down minimally responsive in her
home on the day of admission by a neighbor three days after she
was last seen well by her family.  Initially taken to OSH where
notes mention garbled speech and lack of withdrawal of BLE to
pain. CT head revealed a large intraparenchymal bleed in the
left parietal lobe.  She was given 1g of dilantin and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.  At transfer, a repeat CT
scan was performed, neurosurgery was consulted, pt was admitted
to trauma ICU.  The pt offered no complaints.  She denied
headache or any other complaint that was asked of her. She did
not know why she was hospitalized.

Past Medical History:
(per notes)
-osteoporosis
-depression


Social History:
Lives at home alone. Status of tobacco, alcohol, illicit drug
history unknown at present

Family History:
Unknown

Physical Exam:
Vitals: T: 99.9F P: 97 R: 16 BP: 137/45 SaO2: 94% 3L NC
General: Lying in bed with eyes closed.
HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMdry, no lesions noted
in oropharynx
Neck: C-collar in place
Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally without R/R/W
Cardiac: tachycardic, RR, nl. S1S2, no M/R/G noted
Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or
organomegaly noted.
Extremities: No C/C/E bilaterally, 2+ radial, DP and PT pulses
bilaterally.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.

Neurologic:
-mental status: Lies in bed asleep and sluggishly opens her eyes
when her name is called.  Oriented to self only (place: St.
[**Hospital 6783**] Hospital, date: [**Month (only) 1096**]). Language was non-fluent in
that she answered in mostly [**12-18**] word sentences.  Attempted to
answer examiner's questions, but had no spontaneous speech.
Perseverated.  Speech was not dysarthric.

-cranial nerves:  Right pupil 3 to 2mm and brisk, Left pupil 4
to 2mm and sluggish. Funduscopic exam revealed no papilledema,
exudates, or hemorrhages. EOMI appeared intact, could not
perform oculocephalic maneuver due to cervical collar.  Corneal
reflex and nasal tickle present bilaterally. No overt facial
asymmetry (but hard to tell with cervical collar in place). Gag
reflex
intact.

-motor: Normal bulk throughout. Tone was increased on the left
side with cogwheeling in the left wrist and ankle. Withdraws to
noxious stimuli on the left, grimaces but does not withdraw on
the right. Pt would hold her left arm against gravity on
command, but would not move other extremities to command. She
had a moderate amplitude, low frequency tremor of the left arm
which was present at rest and on holding the arm against
gravity.

-sensory: Grimaces to noxious stimuli in all four extremities.

-DTRs:

Plantar response was extensor bilaterally.

Gait and coordination exams deferred due to lack of pt
cooperation.

Radiologic Data:
CT HEAD W/ & W/O CONTRAST; CT 100CC NON IONIC CONTRAST ([**2148-5-5**]
9:52 PM)
IMPRESSION: Large, 6 x 3.7 cm parenchymal hemorrhage in the
posterior left frontoparietal subcortical white matter with
transependymal "dissection" into the left, and layering in the
right lateral ventricular occipital horns. No definite enhancing
abnormal vessel or mass lesion identified. Minimal, 3 mm shift
of normally midline structures to the right. There is no
secondary sign of traumatic injury and, the absence of
anticoagulation or HTN history, amyloid angiopathy is a primer
consideration; MRI (w/GRE sequence) may be helpful for further
evaluation.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST ([**2148-5-6**] 3:30 PM)
FINDINGS: There has been no significant change in the size or
appearance of the left parietal hemorrhage. Again seen is a
C-shaped structure that may represent dissected transependymal
blood, or blood within the choroid plexus. Associated brain
edema is unchanged, and there is no progression of minimal
rightward subfalcine herniation. There is a moderate quantity of
blood layering in the dependent right atrium-occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**]. The
lateral ventricles remain moderately dilated.
IMPRESSION: No interval change in large left parietal lobe and
intraventircular hemorrhage.
.
MR CERVICAL SPINE  ([**2148-5-6**] 3:14 AM)
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal exam due to motion artifact. Central disc
herniation at C5-C6 level is noted with moderate encroachment
and flattening the ventral aspect of the cord. There is moderate
stenosis of the foramina at the same level due to superimposed
uncovertebral and facet hypertrophy. No compression fractures
were seen.
.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST; MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST ([**2148-5-6**] 1:58
AM)
IMPRESSION:
1. Large 6 x 4 cm left parietal subcortical parenchymal
hemorrhage with transependymal dissection, without evidence for
additional hemorrhage.
2. Focal dilatation of both anterior cerebral artery A2 segment
origins that may besecondary to loop, branching, or less likely
aneurysm. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding these findings via
telephone on [**2148-5-6**] at 4pm.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  ([**2148-5-7**] 9:04 AM)
FINDINGS: The left parietal parenchymal hemorrhage is
essentially unchanged from the previous examination. The
interventricular high density material most likely representing
a dissection of blood into the ventricular system is likewise
unchanged. Ventricular dimension is unchanged. There are no
definite new findings. There is a very slight (2 3) mm left to
right subfalcial herniation measured at the level of the foramen
of [**Last Name (un) 2044**].
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance when compared to prior study

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Intracranial Hemorrhage: As above, the pt was noted to have a
large left parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Her BP was
closely monitored with goal SBP<140mmHg. She was started on
metoprolol for HR and BP control.  She was loaded with dilantin
and her dose adjusted to maintain adequate serum levels.
However, eventually she developed a rash to dilantin.  As she
had no seizure
