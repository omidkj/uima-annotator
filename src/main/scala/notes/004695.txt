STUDIES:
[**5-14**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia. Left axis deviation. Possible left
ventricular hypertrophy. ST-T wave abnormalities. No previous
tracing available for comparison.
.
[**5-14**] CXR: Interval progression of interstitial lung disease.
Limited
evaluation for superimposed pneumonia.
.
[**5-17**] CTA:
1. Baseline pulmonary fibrosis with likely superimposed
infectious process.  Differential diagnosis includes viral,
mycoplasma, or H. influenza bacterial pneumonia.
2. Increased hilar, axillary, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy
compared to
[**2135-5-11**].
3. No pulmonary embolism.
4. Large hiatal hernia is stable since [**2135-4-20**].
.
[**5-18**] CXR: Left PICC terminates within the body of the right
atrium.
Widespread diffuse lung abnormalities are not appreciably
changed since the recent study.
.
[**5-20**] CXR: No significant change.
.
[**5-21**] CXR: Severe UIP-related changes make exclusion of
superimposed
infection difficult. Clinical correlation is advised.
.
[**5-22**] Sputum cytology: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
.
[**5-23**] CXR: Stable severe UIP related changes. No evidence of
supervening
pneumonia.
.
[**5-24**] CXR: There are low lung volumes. There has been no interval
change in
diffuse reticular opacities of the lower lungs. The
cardiomediastinal
silhouette and hilar contours are normal. The distal tip of left
PICC
projects at the cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax or new
opacity is noted.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
77 yo woman with hx of ILD by CT scan in [**4-/2132**] p/w hypoxia,
cough, radiologic evidence of pulmonary infection. Respiratory
status worsening with increasing oxygen requirement and frequent
desaturations
.
# Hypoxia/Pneumonia: Imaging on admission was limited for
evaluation of acute processes on background of chronic
interstitial disease. She was started empirically on
levofloxacin for CAP coverage. She continued to spike fevers and
vancomycin/cefepime were added, out of concern for HCAP, given
participation in adult day care center, where fellow attendees
were reportedly sick. Her O2 saturation worsened during her time
on the floor. One day prior to transfer to the MICU, she was
desatting regularly, with minimal exertion or intervention. Even
with coughing, her O2 sats were < 80%. She was seen by the
pulmonary team, who recommended holding further invasive
evaluation (e.g. bronch/BAL) until goals of care were further
clarified with the family. Steroids were also held, given
ongoing fevers. On the morning of transfer, she triggered for
hypoxia to an O2 sat of 48% while sitting in bed. Her O2 sats
initially improved with non-rebreather, but she continued to
desaturate to the 70s with minimal movement, and was
subsequently transferred to the MICU.  In the MICU, pt initialy
had a high O2 requirement but never required intubation or
non-invasive assisted ventilation.  Fluid status was monitored
closely and roughly 1-2 L of fluid was diured with prn lasix
over several days.  O2 was weaned to 4L shovel mask on transfer
back to the floor.  The patient's oxygenation and overall
respiratory status was stable for the remainder of her
hospitalization.
.
# Weakness: Believed to be multifactorial, with dyspnea and
malnutrition as contributing factors. She was to be discharged
to a rehabilitation facility for further physical therapy.
.
# Tachycardia: Early in the patient's stay on the floor, she had
multiple episodes of narrow complex tachycardia, likely SVT. She
responded well to 10 mg IV diltiazem each time. She was
monitored on telemetry. She was started on standing diltiazem,
and her heart rate/rhythm were subsequently well controlled,
despite her frequent hypoxic events.  HR remained well
controlled in high 90s to low 100s in the ICU. The night prior
to discharge, she also had a brief run of tachycardia that
self-resolved and did not recur after her usual dose of
dilatiazem. She was discharged on sustained-release diltiazem,
for ease of administration.
.
# Microcytic Anemia: The patient had an iron study profile
consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation, but may have had
an iron deficiency component as well. She had reportedly refused
colonoscopy as an outpatient in the past. Her hematocrit was
stable throughout the hospitalization. She did not require blood
transfusion.
.
# Type 2 DM: The patient reportedly takes metformin as an
outpatient, but her fingersticks were generally under excellent
control on the floor. She was treated with an
