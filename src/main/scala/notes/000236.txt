Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Amiodarone

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB and nasal congestion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Multiple cardiac catheterizations (both right and left-sided)

History of Present Illness:
This history was taken with the help of a Portuguese
interpreter. Patient is a 32 yo male with a history Dilated
Cardiomyopathy (TTE [**8-2**]: EF 20%), CHF, h/o ventricular
tachycardia, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, h/o L PCA CVA, and
hyperthyroidism secondary to Amiodarone who presents with a
history of SOB and nasal congestion. He reports that over the
past few days, he has felt increasingly short of breath at rest,
and has noticed nasal congestion. He denies cough, fever, or
sick contacts, but he does reports a history of chills. On the
morning of admission, he felt a very brief pinching feeling in
his chest. He reports decreased exercise tolerance and increased
fatigue. He can currently walk 10 minutes without getting short
of breath (but he says he can usually walk longer than that). He
reports medication-compliance, but has eaten more salty food
than usual over the past few days. He denies orthopnea and PND,
but has had increased ankle edema. He has occasional
palpitations. Denies dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope, or the
feeling of shocks from his ICD. He was at a routine outpatient
visit with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**], who admitted him for a Lasix gtt.
.
On admission, the patient was slightly SOB, but denies chest
pain or lightheadedness. His initial blood pressure was 85/49 ->
93/47 -> 80/50. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] was notified, and the decision was
made to send him to the CCU for Dobutamine IV and Swan in the
AM.
.
On admission to the CCU the patient reports mild SOB, otherwise
ROS as above.

EKG demonstrated afib at 64, diffuse low voltage with no
significant change compared with prior.

[**2121-12-18**] Head CT
FINDINGS: There is a chronic infarct in the left occipital and
temporal regions. There is adjacent ex vacuo dilation of the
temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle. There has been
resolution of the previously noted right- sided subdural
hematoma. Encephalomalacia from the prior right frontal
contusion is noted as well as white matter hypodensities in the
subcortical region of the high right frontal lobe suggestive of
prior diffuse axonal injury ([**Doctor First Name **]) in this region. These findings
are unchanged from the most recent study. The visualized
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. The soft
tissues appear unremarkable.  IMPRESSION:  1. Resolution of the
previously noted right-sided subdural hematoma.  2. Sequela of
prior infarct, contusion, and probable [**Doctor First Name **], as above.

[**2121-12-23**] Head CT
No change compared to the prior study.  Stable encephalomalacic
changes in the right frontal and left parieto-occipital regions.
 No evidence for subdural hematoma or mass effect.

[**2121-12-26**] TTE
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15-20%). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a
restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial
pressure. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION:
Moderately dilated left ventricle with severe global systolic
dysfunction. Elevated filling pressures. Mild pulmonary
hypertension. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2121-8-8**], the findings are similar.

[**2122-1-1**] Cardiac Catheterization
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system
revealed
no angiographically apparent coronary artery disease.  The LMCA,
LAD,
LCX and RCA had no angiographically apparent flow-limiting
stenoses.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right and left
sided
filling pressures with RVEDP of 12 mm Hg and PCWP mean of 19 mm
Hg at
baseline.  There was moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension of
45/21
mm Hg.  Systemic arterial blood pressure was normal at 103/65 mm
Hg.
Cardiac index was depressed at a baseline value of 1.7 l/min/m2.

After milrinone bolus of 0.5 mcg/kg IV over 10 minutes, left
sided
filling pressure were unchanged with a PCWP mean of 19 mm Hg.
Pulmonary
arterial pressure decreased to 40/18 mm Hg.  Pulmonary vascular
resistance also decreased.  Cardiac index improved to 2.2
l/min/m2.
There was no change in systemic arterial blood pressure.
3.  Left ventriculography was not performed.


Brief Hospital Course:
(1) DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY AND CHF
Mr. [**Known lastname **] has a dilated cardiomyopathy that was diagnosed after
presenting with Class III CHF symptoms in [**9-27**]; it is thought
to be of viral etiology.  TTE from [**8-2**] showed an EF of 20%.  He
is s/p AICD placement in [**2117**] after VT was diagnosed on Holter
monitor. During this admission, he had evidence of worsening
heart failure on CXR ultimately requiri
