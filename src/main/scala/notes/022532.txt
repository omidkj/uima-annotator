History of Present Illness:
79 yo white male with end-stage renal disease on HD with recent
STEMI on plavix and aspirin with EF 25%, atrial fibrillation on
coumadin admitted with HCT 18.8 and INR 9.9. He had blood drawn
at HD today that showed an INR of 16.2 and PTT 56.8. EMS picked
patient up to bring to the ED. Vitals at that time were p110, bp
110/64, r20, 90%ra. He has been at [**Doctor First Name 391**] [**Hospital **] Rehab since his
discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] following his STEMI on [**9-19**]. He denies
headache, dizziness, nausea, abdominal pain, hematesis, melana,
chest pain, shortness of breath. He had mild burning abdominal
pain yesterday as per wife. As per daughter-in-law he had some
blood on his stool yesterday. Additionally, he has been
sundowning for the past few weeks. He had a colonoscopy last
month that showed hemorrhoids and 4 colonic polyps. He was
discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on levofloxacin, presumably for a UTI.
Also, he finished a 3day course of ciprofloxacin on [**9-22**],
presumably for a UTI. He makes very little urine at baseline.
His INR at dischare was 3.2, but had been as high as 7.5 while
in the hospital. His HCT was 28.5-32.5 during his last
admission.
.
ROS: occassional diarrhea, occasional orthopnea, dysuria for one
month, poor appetite at baseline,
.
In the ED, he was given 5mg SC vitamin K, DDAVP, 2 bags of FFP,
and one unit of pRBCs. He did not tolerate an attempt for
central access by internal jugular due to agitation and a right
femoral line was placed.

Pertinent Results:
[**2131-9-29**] CXR:  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation
with equivocal very small left effusion. No CHF or right
effusion. No supine film evidence of pneumothorax is identified.

.
[**2131-9-29**] CT HEAD:  No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
.
[**2131-9-29**] ECG:  Sinus tachycardia. Marked left axis deviation.
Right bundle-branch block with left anterior fascicular block.
Anteroseptal myocardial infarction of indeterminate age.  Rate
105, PR 174, QRS 150, QT/QTc 384/445, P 62, T47.
.
[**2131-9-30**] CXR: new extensive bilateral alveolar opacities
throughout both lungs, probably with bilateral pleural
effusions. There is left lower lobe collapse and/or
consolidation. Findings are compatible with severe pulmonary
edema.
.
[**2131-10-1**] CXR:  The diffuse alveolar edema present on the prior
chest x-ray has improved. Interstitial [**Doctor Last Name 5926**] remains in the
right upper lung and the left lower lung, and an associated left
pleural effusion is present

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 79 yo male with ESRD [**1-3**] hypertensive nephrosclerosis on
HD, pAfib on coumadin, low EF, and recent STEMI with stent
placement on plavix and aspirin who is admitted with elevated
INR in the setting of recnt antibiotics and poor nutrition, low
HCT, and altered mental status.
.
GI BLEED: Recent colonscopy showed hemmorhoids and 4 polyps as
per daughter.  A small amount of blood was visualized on NG
lavage consistent with an upper GI bleed in setting of
supratherapeutic INR, aspirin, plavix and uremic platelets.
Initially treated with Protonix IV bid, DDAVP and FFP in ED.
Hct remained stable at 33-35 for the rest of his hospitalization
after 6 units of PRBCs.  INR dropped to roughly 2 after FFP
treatment.  A slight bump in INR from 1.8 to 2.2 was seen on the
day of discharge likely secondary to reinstitution of a normal
diet including vitamin K.  More FFP was not administered given
recent coronary stent placement.  An EGD was deferred, and will
be performed as an outpatient.
.
DELIRIUM: Pt was agitated and confused since the last admission.
New meds that were started on the last admission: lipitor,
albuterol, atrovent, ASA, plavix, calcium acetate, seroquel,
zydis, metoprolol, lisinopril, amiodarone. Meds stopped:
trazadone, norvasc, clonidine, hydrazalne, and nicotine patch.
Pts delirium cleared with discontinuation of standing
seroquel/zydis and reinstitution of trazadone and nicotine.  He
had very occasional sundowning with his discharge medication
regimen.
.
HYPERNATREMIA: Likely from hypovolemic hypernatremia.
Normalized with fluid resuscitation.
.
CAD: ASA and Plavix were continued given recent placement of
coronary stent.  BB and ACEi were also reinstituted after being
held for one day.
.
PULMONARY EDEMA:  Pt manifested flash pulmonary edema on the
second day of hospitalization secondary to EF=20% and fluid
resuscitation.  Pt received immediate HD and then daily HD for
fluid overload with marked improvement in O2 requirement, CXR
and clinical exam.
.
ESRD: Pt received HD every day while hospitalized or fluid
overload.
.
HTN: antihypertensives were reinstituted with the stabilization
of Hct
.
COPD: atrovent and albuterol were continued.
.
AFIB:  Pt exhibited atrial fibrillation after [**Last Name (un) **] pulmonary
edema requiring increased doses of metoprolol and amiodarone.
He was continued on amiodarone at 200 mg QD and his home dose of
metoprolol.  He converted back to sinus ryhthm with his
discharge dosing of amiodarone and metoprolol.
.
PPX: No heparin was given due to h/o HIT ab. Pneumoboots. PPI.
ISS. Bowel regimen prn. Acetaminophen prn.
.
FEN: NPO
.
Line: right femoral line was placed for access and removed one
day prior to discharge, peripheral access was obtained.
.
Code: Full code. Clarified with wife who is health care proxy.
.
Communication: Wife, son, and daughter in law.
