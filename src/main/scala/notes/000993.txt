Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1267**]
Chief Complaint:
ACS, cardiogenic shock

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
central line
cardiac catheterization
MVR
possible CABG

History of Present Illness:
77 year old female w/ a h/o [**First Name3 (LF) **], hypercholesterolemia, DM, PMR
on steroids who is transferred from [**Hospital 2079**] hospital w/ ACS
in cardiogenic shock. She initially presented to [**Hospital 2079**]
hospital w/ 2 days of CP and SOB. Family describes "chest
congestion" starting at ~7 pm on the night of presentation to
Southshore ([**2151-3-28**]) which was significantly worse than recently
(had been complaing of chest congestion x 2 wks) now associate
with SOB. Husband called 911 and she was brought to [**Hospital 2079**]
hospital. In the Southshore ED, patient found to have ST
depressions in V2-V6 and isolated STE in V1. She was also found
to have pulmonary edema and was managed w/ BiPAP and diuresis.
This am, patient was evaluated by Cardiology and was found to be
hypotensive in cardiogenic shock. Cr rising w/ poor UOP despite
diuresis. Cardiac enzymes were found to be elevated: CK
198->431->951-> 5403, MB 37->86->192->915, Trop
0.37->0.95->1.46->17.16. She was started on heparin gtt,
integrillin, Plavix 300mg x1. She underwent cardiac cath showing
TO LAD, 90% circ, tortuous RCA with L->L collaterals as well as
R->L collaterals to septum. IABP placed and patient was
intubated, Patient was briefly in asystole by report but
converted with CPR and was placed on Levophed via a peripheral
IV. 2 PIV's in place. Stat bedside ECHO showed moderate to
severe MR and MR w/ apical and lateral HK.
.
Upon arrival to the CCU, patient is intubated and sedated but
moving all extremities. She continues to have a high levophed
requirement to maintain her pressures. She was taken emergently
to the cardiac cath lab where her LAD TO was confirmed as well
as her 90% circ w/ L->L collaterals and RCA w/ aneurysm vs.
dissection and R->L collaterals. She received 2 BMS->Circ. The
LAD was crossed but given likely chronicity of her TO, it was
not opened.
.
Recent events discussed with patient's family. Family notes that
since THR in [**10/2150**], patient has complained of increased
fatigue. Has also had slow, slurred speech since that time.
Family notes DOE w/ [**2-4**] of a mile over the last year. She must
stop after a few steps on the stairs to rest. Patient also
complained of "chest congestion" over the last few weeks which
had recently improved. She also complained of "indigestion".
Associated w/ recent chest congestion, patient also had
orthopnea symptoms which improved w/ pillows.

Pertinent Results:
COMMENTS:
1. Successful stenting of the LCX with two bare metal stents 3.0
X 18 mm
and 2.5 X 12 mm Vision stents in a non-overlapping fashion with
no
residual stenosis (see PTCA comments for detail).
2. Engagement of the proximal cap of the chronic total LAD
occlusion
with Shinobi wire.
3. RCA angiography showing two proximal and mid vessel 60%
lesion an a
distal pseudoaneurysm with possible dissection.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Cardiogenic shock requiring IABP support.
4. Successful stenting of the LCA with two bare metal stents
-------
TTE [**3-30**]

The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
inferolateral akinesis, as well as inferior and lateral
hypokinesis (LCx distribution). The remaining segments exhibit
compensatory hyperkinesis (LVEF = 35-40%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. There is a partial
rupture of the posterolateral papillary muscle with associated
eccentric, anteriorly-directed jet of severe (4+) mitral
regurgitation. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w CAD. Partial papillary muscle rupture with
severe mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension
----------------
TTE [**3-31**] after surgery

Prebypass: moderate global LV hypokinesis (30-35%), severe
mitral regurgitation with eccentric jet, partial rupture of
posteromedial papillary muscle and chordae tendinae, moderate 2+
tricuspid regurgitation. Right ventricular free wall appears
normal. There is evidence mildly calcified aortic leaflets but
no evidence of aortic stenosis. Descending and ascending aorta
within NL limits.

Postbypass: overall LV function globally depressed (30-35%).
Minimal improvement compared to prebypass. Prosthetic mitral
valve leaflets well positioned and adequate movement of the
leaflets. . No appreciable mitral regurgitation. Moderate
tricuspid regurgitation as seen in the prebypass period.. RV
free wall unchanged and normal. Descending and ascending aorta
within normal limits and without evidence of dissection.
