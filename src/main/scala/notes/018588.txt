[**2-22**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia (119). Diffuse ST-T wave abnormality.
Cannot rule out myocardial ischemia. Low QRS voltage in the limb
leads. No previous tracing available for comparison.

[**2-23**] TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. No left atrial
mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal
echocardiography). The estimated right atrial pressure is
0-10mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. There is severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with basal to mid septal and anterior
hypokinesis/akinesis and mid inferior akinesis. No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-30 %). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction consistent with multivessel coronary artery disease.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation. Moderate to severe [3+]
tricuspid regurgitation with moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.

[**2-23**] CT abd/pelvis: 1. Findings poorly evaluated without
intravenous contrast but potentially suspicious for peritoneal
carcinomatosis, including ascites and probable peritoneal and
serosal thickening. If there is an outside hospital CT with
intravenous contrast, then this can be scanned into the system
for comparison. 2. Partial small-bowel obstruction, with
transition point in the distal ileum. Contrast does pass into
the colon. 3. Moderate ascites. 4. Moderate bilateral pleural
effusions and adjacent atelectasis. 5. Small hiatal hernia. 6.
Tiny non-obstructing left nephrolithiasis. 7. Anasarca.

[**2-23**] CT Head: FINDINGS: There is a moderate-sized area of
hypodensity in the watershed territory between the right MCA and
PCA territory, consistent with reported history of subacute
infarction. There is no sign of hemorrhagic transformation
within this area. There is no other intracranial hemorrhage.
There is no mass, mass effect, or evidence of other area of
infarction.

There is moderate sulcal prominence in the bilateral frontal
lobes, most
consistent with atrophy, slightly out of proportion to
ventricular size. Basal cisterns are normal. There is mild
mucosal thickening in the ethmoid air cells, and nasal passages.
Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are
otherwise normally aerated.

IMPRESSION: Evolving area of infarction in the watershed
territory between
the right MCA and PCA distributions. No sign of intracranial
hemorrhage, or hemorrhagic transformation of this infarct.

[**3-1**] cytology: Pleural fluid: ATYPICAL. Atypical epithelioid
cells present: Rare clusters of atypical epithelioid cells are
present, but degeneration precludes definitive classification.

[**3-5**] TTE: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function are normal (LV
