HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 8840**] is a 79 year old
woman with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation,
COPD who was admitted to the Cardiothoracic Surgery Service
after transfer from an outside hospital. She presented to the
outside hospital with substernal chest pain with radiated to
her left arm and left leg. This was associated with dyspnea.
On admission, she denied nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis,
abdominal pain, hemoptysis or any pain on inspiration. She
was given nitroglycerin sublingual tablets at an outside ER
after which her symptoms resolved. An EKG done at this time
reportedly showed atrial fibrillation without any ischemic
changes. She was subsequently worked up at an outside
hospital with an echocardiogram that showed an ejection
fraction of 55 percent, moderately severe mitral
regurgitation, aortic insufficiency and severe tricuspid
regurgitation. Given these findings, she was transferred to
the Cardiac Service at [**Hospital1 69**]
for further workup.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Atrial fibrillation.

Hypertension.

Tobacco use.

Motor vehicle accident eight years ago.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Coumadin 4 mg po qhs, lisinopril
40 mg po qd, atenolol 50 mg po bid, Norvasc 5 mg po qam,
Lasix 20 mg po qd.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She was a former smoker quitting eight years
ago, denies alcohol, denies drugs and lives at home with
husband and moderately physically active at baseline.

FAMILY HISTORY:  There was no family history of premature
coronary events or sudden death.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive for heartburn and intermittent
symptoms of reflux and otherwise negative.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, the temperature was
98.8, pulse 80, blood pressure 130/64, respirations 20, O2
sat 95 percent on 4 liters nasal cannula. HEENT examination
shows extraocular muscles were intact and pupils were equal,
reactive to light and accommodation. Neck exam - supple,
nontender, no JVD. Chest exam was clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Cardiac examination - regular rate and rhythm
with S1 and S2. Abdominal exam - soft, nontender,
nondistended. Extremities - no clubbing or edema. Neurologic
exam - alert and oriented times three.

PERTINENT LABORATORY AND OTHER TESTS:  Echocardiogram in [**2134-8-5**] shows moderately dilated left atrium with a small
secundum atrial septal defect, left ventricular systolic
function of 55 percent, moderately dilated ascending aorta
with a mobile density in the ascending aorta consistent with
an intimal flap/aortic dissection extending up to the aortic
arch, moderate to severe aortic regurgitation, mild mitral
regurgitation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and a large pleural
effusion.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Ms. [**Known lastname 8840**] was transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**] after she presented to
an outside hospital complaining of chest pain radiating to
her left arm. On arrival to the [**Hospital1 188**] on the Cardiac Surgery Service, she received a
consultation from the Cardiology Service. Her initial
evaluation included an echocardiogram which showed the
results noted above. Given her dissection and mitral aortic
and tricuspid valve disease, her condition was felt to be
grave and options for surgery were discussed with her and the
family. When the risks for surgery were discussed with the
patient, she initially did not want the procedure. However,
she changed her mind while she was in the Coronary Care Unit.
She received a cardiac catheterization at this time which
showed one vessel coronary artery disease, severe aortic
regurgitation and severe mitral regurgitation. She had a type
I aortic dissection. After her catheterization, she was sent
back to the Coronary Care Unit for further medical
management. Extensive discussions were held with the patient
and the family given the severity of her situation. She was
quoted a mortality rate of 20-30 percent for repair of her
ascending aortic dissection and her valves. After much
thought, the patient agreed to the surgery and she was
prepared for surgery on the [**2134-8-24**]. On the morning
of [**2134-8-25**], she was taken to the Operating Room and
received repair of her ascending aorta with a 30 cm Gelweave
graft and aortic valve replacement with a 23 mm CE-Magna
pericardial valve and a mitral valve replacement with a 29 mm
Mosaic porcine valve. In the Operating Room, she had a
cardiopulmonary bypass time of 262 minutes, cross clamp time
of 215 minutes and circulatory arrest time of 29 minutes. She
was admitted to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit for her
postoperative care. Her postoperative care initially was
consistent with a slow recovery. She was kept intubated until
postoperative day 2 and slowly weaned off her ventilator.
Initially, she required support by milrinone for her
hemodynamics. This pressor was weaned off slowly by
postoperative day 3. After extubation, she was neurologically
intact and was started on Lasix for diuresis and heparin for
anticoagulation. Her platelet count was noted to decrease to
the level of 87 and her heparin was stopped and she was
started on Coumadin. An HRT panel was sent which was
negative. Her chest tubes were removed on postoperative day 4
and her physical activity was increased from bed to chair as
she continued to stay in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit for
adequate blood pressure control. She developed atrial
fibrillation around day 3 for which she received beta
blockers and weight control.

On the night of postoperative day 6 and morning of
postoperative day 7, Ms. [**Known lastname 8840**] was in the Cardiac Intensive
Care Unit in her usual condition, maintaining her usual
hemodynamics. At this time, she was found to have an acute
episode of bradycardia for a few seconds followed by lack of
consciousness and blood pressure. An ACLS protocol was
initiated and all efforts including epinephrine, Atropine,
CPR, attempt at pacing were tried. Despite more than 30
minutes of active resuscitation, Ms. [**Known lastname 8840**] failed to show
any signs of perfusion. At this time, she was pronounced dead
at 2:16 a.m. on [**2134-9-1**]. The family was made aware of
her demise and a consent was obtained for a postmortem
examination per family's request.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Death on [**2134-9-1**].

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Death.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Cardiopulmonary arrest resulting in
death.

Coronary artery disease.

Cardiac valvular disease.

Hypertension.

COPD.

Ascending aortic dissection.

Ascending aortic dissection repair, aortic valve replacement
and mitral valve replacement.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient's family has been notified of
patient's demise with senior cardiac service team present at
bedside.
