Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
Helicopter transfer for right thalamic hemorrhage


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tracheal intubation and extubation


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]yo right handed woman with history significant for
hypertension, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, GERD, presented
from OSH with RIGHT thalamic hemorrhage, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED
via helicopter. She was in her normal state of health at an
[**Hospital3 **] facility when she was noted to be slumped, with
LEFT facial droop, left hemiparesis. [**Hospital3 **] personnel
were notified and she was taken to an OSH where head CT showed a
2.5cm acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the RIGHT basal
ganglia with surrounding edema, no midline shift. VS were:
afebrile, HR 80 BP 180/90 97% on RA. On exam, she was
dysarthric, following commands, disoriented, with LEFT facial
and hemiparesis. INR was 2.35, so she was given 4 units FFP, Vit
K 10mg, [**Last Name (un) **] 7 90mEq/kg = 54000mcg IV. GCS changed from 14 at
presentation to 12 just prior to CareFlight.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ER, VS 98.7 74 NSR 185/70s 16 98% on RA. She became
more unresponsive and somolent. She was intubated with Propofol.
VS were: afebrile, HR 74 BP 268/92 RR 16 SaO2 100% directly
after intubation. She was started on a
Propofol drip and her BP slowly decreased to 149/58 with HR 55s.
She was given 4 units FFP. Neurosurgery was consulted. Repeat
Head CT was obtained. Neurosurgery reviewed this and deemed no
benefit from surgery at this time.

Past Medical History:

Head CT:
1. 2.5 cm intraparenchymal hemorrhage centered in the right
thalamus with mild mass effect on the third ventricle and
extension into the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral
ventricle.
2. Chronic ischemic microvascular disease.
3. Ethmoid sinus disease.

MRI Brain:
The MRA is severely limited by motion artifact. No vascular
abnormalities are detected on this limited study. Specifically,
there is no evidence of an aneurysm.
CONCLUSION: Right thalamic hematoma without evidence of new
hemorrhage since [**2175-4-24**]. No findings to suggest amyloid
angiopathy.

CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**4-27**]:
Mild pulmonary edema and mall bilateral pleural effusions have
increased.
Upper lungs are clear. Lung bases are partially obscured by the
cardiac
silhouette and could [**Hospital1 **] pneumonia, though opacification at
the lung bases is more likely atelectasis. Nasogastric tube ends
in the stomach. Heart size top normal. No pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1511**] had a right thalamic hemorrhage thought secondary to
hypertension. She was transferred from an OSH with a worsening
mental status. She received 4 units FFP, Vit K 10mg, [**Last Name (un) **] 7
5400mcg to reverse her INR of 2.3. In the [**Hospital1 18**] ER, pt received
2 units FPP and was intubated secondary decreased mental status.
She was admitted to the ICU, but extubated on hospital day 1 and
transitioned to face mask. Hospital course was notable for:
1. Right thalamic hemorrhage status post reversal - her
neurologic examination remained stable, with decreased
interaction, somnolence, and severe left hemiparesis.
2. Infection: She had a UTI treated with bactrim, then a
pneumonia treated with vancomycin and levofloxacin.
3. Respiratory distress: She had pulmonary edema, treated with
lasix, and pneumonia, treated as above.
4. Renal failure: Creatinine worsened after lasix treatment, but
improved with hydration.
5. Tachycardia: Treated with metoprolol.
6. Hypertension: Treated with metoprolol and hydralazine, as
high as 220s systolic.
7. Nutrition: She required an NG tube for nutrition and
medications.
***8. Goals of care: Given her poor progress and functional
limitations, her family decided to make her goals of care
comfort. She was treated with morphine, scopolamine, and ativan
as needed. She needs frequent assessments for adjustments of
these medications to minimize discomfort and distress.
