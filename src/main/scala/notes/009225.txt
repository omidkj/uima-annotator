History of Present Illness:
80 yo m w/hz ischemic cardiomyopathy (ef 25-30%), CAD (history
of MI, 2 stents in fall/04), s/p AICD permanent pacemaker, CRI,
DM, who presented to OSH on thursday after 2 AICD shocks.  He
reports episodes of dizziness, AICD shocks, and melenotic
stools.  He denies hematemesis, chest pain, shortness of breath,
hematuria.  He states that he may have taken a few ibuprofen a
few days prior to admission, and he may have had some spicy food
as well.  At the OSH, his K was noted to be 6.9, and Hct was 25;
he had several episodes of tarry, black stools as well at the
OSH.  His Hct further dropped to 22, and he received 3 U PRBC
without bump. EGD was performed which showed ?Dieulafoy's lesion
in 2nd-3rd part of duodenum; this was clipped.  He was
transferred here at that time for further management.  On
presentation here, he denied any cp/sob/abdominal pain; he
stated his stools had been tarry since starting iron
supplementation.  He was transfused 2 more U PRBC here (hct
26.6->31.2), and his hct has remained stable.  On interrogation
of his AICD, it was found that he had been in V-tach (no events
on tele since admission).  Currently, he is doing well, with no
complaints, still with some melanotic stools.

Brief Hospital Course:
1.  GI bleed: EGD at OSH showed oozing Dieulafoy lesion that was
cauterized.  He required 6 U at the OSH and an additional 2 U in
the ICU.  He required 1 additional unit while on the floor to
keep his hematocrit over 30 (given his CAD).  On day before
discharge, he had a repeat EGD in the endoscopy suite which
showed no source of bleeding.  His hematocrit had been stable
for 72 hours at time of discharge.  H. pylori antibody was sent
prior to discharge (?gastritis seen on EGD).  He was continued
on a twice daily proton pump inhibitor and instructed not to
take ibuprofen or eat spicy food.  He will get his hematocrit
checked weekly to ensure stability and will follow up 1 week
after discharge with his PCP.

2.  Cardiac:
CAD: with elevated tnt's, likely in setting of demand.  As per
cardiology, the elevated troponins were likely secondary to the
AICD having fired and his chronic renal insufficiency.  He had
no anginal symptoms while in-house.  He was discharged on his
ASA, Plavix (given stents), Coreg, Valsartan, Digoxin, and
Pravachol.  He will follow up with his cardiologist and PCP.
[**Name Initial (NameIs) **]: with AICD, s/p shocks for V-tach, likely in setting of
hyperkalemia.  He had some episodes of non-sustained v-tach on
tele (asymptomatic).  His electrolytes were strictly monitored
and repleted as necessary.  The hyperkalemia was likely in the
setting of digoxin/diovan.  He was instructed not to take
potassium supplementation on discharge, and he will have his
electrolytes checked regularly upon discharge.
Pump: EF=25%.  He was restarted on his Diovan and Lasix when
hemodynamically stable and remained clinically euvolemic.

3.  DM - He was covered with SSI while in-house with good
glycemic control and was discharged on his outpatient dose of
Amaryl.

4.  Dispo: He was discharged to follow up with his PCP 1 week
after discharge.  He will get weekly hematocrits, electrolytes,
and creatinine checked initially to ensure these are stable.
