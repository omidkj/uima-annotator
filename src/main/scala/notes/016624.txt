HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 55 year old gentleman,
patient of Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 53721**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who was referred for a cardiac
catheterization due to progressive dyspnea on exertion and
chest discomfort.  He states that the dyspnea varies on a day
to day basis.  At times he feels quite limited though he can
not be active all day.  He sleeps in a chair which relieves
his breathing.  He does admit to paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea.  He also complains of intermittent chest pain, more
over the last six months.  He describes he has tenderness in
his shoulders and chest with bilateral hand numbness.  This
is evident on exertion but can also occur at rest.  He became
so short of breath on the day prior to admission that he
could not speak.  He has undergone pulmonary function tests
in the past and was told he has asthma.  On [**2192-12-7**],
he underwent an echocardiogram which revealed normal left
ventricular function with concentric left ventricular
hypertrophy, mild left atrial enlargement, 1+ aortic
insufficiency.  On [**2192-12-7**], a Myoview was 56% of
maximum heart rate and was stopped for leg discomfort and
dyspnea as well as chest pain.  Electrocardiogram showed [**Street Address(2) 7093**] depressions inferiorly in leads V3 through V6.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia and former history of heavy smoking for
approximately 50 years, to three packs per day range and
stopped seven years ago.  His other history is significant
for gout and kidney stones.  He has no surgical history
reported as well as no history of transient ischemic attacks,
CVLs or lower gastrointestinal bleed.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, Atenolol 50 q.d., Accupril
20 q.d., Allopurinol 300 b.i.d., Crestor 5 mg q.d., Flomax .4
q.d., Magnesium oxide 400 q.d., Ranitidine 300 b.i.d.,
Combivent prn, and Pulmicort 2 puffs b.i.d.

LABORATORY DATA:  His admitting laboratory data were
significant for a white count of 8.2, hematocrit of 55, and
chem-7 of 140/4.1, 103/32, 22/1.5 and INR of .9.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married.  He works in
...................  He is illiterate.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization
Laboratory on [**2192-12-10**] with findings of left main
disease and three vessel coronary artery disease.  He was
consulted to the Cardiac Service for a coronary artery bypass
grafting, admitted to the hospital specifically with a 90%
occlusion of the left anterior descending at S1; diffuse mid
70%; sequential 80% mid distal lesion LMCA; diffuse 70%, 80%
distally left circumflex; 80% proximal large obtuse marginal
1; 70% mid; subtotal distal occlusion with right coronary
artery collaterals; right coronary artery; diffuse proximal
to mid diseased, 70%; 80% proximal posterior descending
artery.  The patient was preopped by the Cardiology Surgery
Service on [**2192-12-10**] and was seen by the attending
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] at that time.  He was taken to the
Operating Room on [**2192-12-12**] and underwent a coronary
artery bypass graft times three.  Coronary artery bypass
graft was times three with a left internal mammary artery to
the left anterior descending coronary artery and reverse
saphenous vein graft from the aorta to the right posterior
descending coronary artery and reverse saphenous vein graft
from the aorta to the obtuse marginal coronary artery.  He
tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the Recovery
Room in stable condition.

On postoperative day #1 he was on no drips and he had a heart
rate of 84 and was atrially paced at that time.  His blood
pressure was 112/51, central venous pressure of 14 on 4
liters of nasal cannula.  His hematocrit at the time was 34.9
with a potassium of 4.5.  He was transferred to the floor and
postoperative day #2, [**2192-12-14**], he was doing well.
He was complaining of incisional pain and feeling bloated.
His pulmonary toilet was encouraged.  He was started on
Reglan.  His diuresis was continued.  He continued to do
well.  He was cleared by physical therapy and was discharged
home on [**2192-12-16**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Coronary artery disease
2.  Hypertension
3.  Gout
4.  Kidney stones
5.  Hyperlipidemia

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lopressor 75 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. times two weeks
3.  [**Doctor First Name 233**]-Ciel 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. times two weeks
4.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5.  Aspirin 325 mg, enteric coated p.o. q.d.
6.  Percocet 5/325 mg one to two tablets p.o. q. 4-6 hours
prn
7.  Crestor 5 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  Keflex 500 mg p.o. q. 6 hours times ten days for some
erythema around the distal portion of the sternal wound.

Of note he was discharged with home services for this small
amount of erythema, approximately 3 by 3 cm at the distal
aspect of his sternal wounds.  There was no discharge from
the wound at the time and it was examined by the attending
physician and deemed to be not a preventative factor from
being discharged.  He will be followed with services at that
time.
