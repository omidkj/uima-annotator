Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7223**]
Chief Complaint:
Ventricular tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Ventricular tachycardia ablation procedure and dual chamber
ICD(defibrillator) implantation.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 63 year old Pakistani male with hx type  IDDM, HTN,
remote 70 pack year smoking history, CAD s/p MI and 4v CABG in
99, s/p cath and stent in [**2163**] anatomy unknown, who presented to
an OSH with palpitations.  Pt reports that approximately 1 month
ago, while in [**State 108**], he noted palpitations.  He went to see a
PCP at that point, who told him that his HR was "slow."  He
decreased his lopressor dose at that time, and his palpitations
temporarily resolved.
.
He then reports that 1 week ago, he began to have worsening
shortness of breath, orthopnea, and LE edema.  His dyspnea was
mostly on exertion, and he reports becoming windy after "several
step."  This is far from his baseline exercise tolerance, which
is "several blocks of walking."  He went to see his PCP at this
time 1 week ago and his lasix dose was increased with
improvement of his symptoms.
.
1 day prior to admission, at around 2 pm, he began to have
palpitations.  He reports that these palpitations are similar to
the palpitations that he had previously 1 month ago.  He also
notes that he began to have shortness of breath and also reports
feeling weak, tired, lightheaded and felt as though a "curtain
was going down in his field of vision."  He denies LOC, chest
pain, fever, chills, cough.
.
At the OSH, he was found to have EKG c/w ventricular tachycardia
and was started on an amiodarone drip 150 mg bolus amio over 20
mins followed by 1 mg/min gtt. He was then given lidocaine bolus
with 2 mg/min which reportedly resulted in breaking his VT for 2
minutes, he was then given Magnesium sulfate x 3 boluses
followed by a 20mg/min gtt which resulted in sinus rhythm with
runs of VT.  His palpitations resolved at 8pm yesterday.
.
EVENTS / HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

MEDICAL DECISION MAKING

Pertinent Results:
EKG demonstrated paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia, RAD
.
TELEMETRY demonstrated: paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia at HR
100s
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed in [**2167**] demonstrated:
40-45% mild LV enlargement and area of focal akinesis in
inferior wall and LV apex

Brief Hospital Course:
63 yo male with CAD s/p 4v CABG in [**2161**] and sytolic HF, EF now
25-30% who presents with a paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia.
.
1. Ventricular Tachycardia:  He has a ventricular arrhythmia
with underlying structural heart disease, CAD with EF 25-30%.
focused VT was ablated and on EP testing, he was also found to
have inducible VT. There were no events on tele between the
ablation and the ICD placement. On [**11-6**] he had a ECHO which
showed LVEF 30% and increased wedge pressure. He had an ICD
placed on [**11-6**]. It was interrogated by EP. He remained
hemodynamically stable, and without evidence of end organ
ischemia. patient had lidocaine gtt and amiodarone gtt.  pt
continued on home beta blocker. TSH is normal. home Lasix was
held, to re-evaluate with PCP

2. Acute systolic heart failure: Appeared mildly fluid
overloaded admission, resolved with PRN lasix. , likely
compounded by his tachycardia.  On echo here, he was found to
have sytolic dysfunction with EF 25-30%, which is reduced from
his previous EF of 40-45% in [**2167**]. CHF at this time may be due
to ischemia or secondary to arrythmia. Took of standing home
lasix dose, because pt euvolemic after several PRN doses.
Cardiac markers negative for MI, but trace positive, probably
due to demand ischemia.
.
3. CAD: Cont ASA, statin, BB.
.
4. CKD: Acute on chronic renal failure on admission. Cr 2.8 on
admission, 2.3 at baseline.  CKD likely secondary to DMII and
HTN. acute KD likely pre-renal secondary to poor renal perfusion
in the setting of frequent VTs. Normalized to baseline by
discharge.
.
5. Leukocytosis: No localizing symptoms.  He is without cough,
dysuria, fever.
urinalysis, cx-ray, blood cxs all negative.
.
6. DM: Glargine 40, ISS, FSG QID. PRN glargine.
