Imaging:
[**2185-9-6**] CXR: Right basilar airspace opacification, for which
differential
includes infection or aspiration

[**2185-9-6**] Abd/Pelvis CT w/o Contrast:
1. Right lower lobe airspace consolidation most compatible with
infection.
2. No evidence of colitis or biliary dilatation.
3. Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.

[**2185-9-7**] CXR:
The examination is compared to [**2185-9-6**]. The right
internal jugular vein catheter has been replaced by a
right-sided PICC line.  The line shows a normal course, the tip
projects over the mid SVC. There is no evidence of complication,
notably no pneumothorax.
The described right medial cardiophrenic parenchymal opacity is
visually less evident than on the previous radiograph, likely to
reflect ongoing resolution of the parenchymal process.
Newly occurred changes in the lung parenchyma. Unchanged
borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without pulmonary
edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname 87557**] [**Known lastname **] is a 52 yo female with h/o COPD, SLE in remission,
chronic back pain r/t DJD and 2 recent admissions for cellulitis
who presented to OSH with fevers and RUQ pain found to have RLL
PNA and hypotension.
.
Septic Shock - Patient with hypotension to 70s in ED.  In the
setting of radiologic/serologic evidence of an infection, it was
believed that this was [**1-25**] to septic physiology.  Other
etiologies considered included cardigenic shock and PE.  She
received 5L of IVF and levofed infusion was initiated.  Her SBP
improved into the low 100s. She remained with good UOP and
mental status.  Her infection was treated as discussed below.
Soon after her arrival in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she tolerated weaning from
levofed with SBPs in the high 90s and low 100s (her reported
basline).  At time of discharge, patient had been
hemodynamically stable >24h.
.
Pneumonia, pleuritic RUQ pain/CP - Patient was admitted with
leukocytosis and fever in setting of RUQ pain.  On admission,
consolidations c/w PNA observed on abdominal CT.  Given multiple
recent admissions to OSH for cellulitis (most recently 1 month
ago), most likely [**Hospital Unit Name 10540**].  Given LFTs, amylase/lipase wnl, and no
abdominal abnormalities noted on CT, less likely cholangitis,
cholecystitis.  PE less likely given radiologic findings and
lack of t
