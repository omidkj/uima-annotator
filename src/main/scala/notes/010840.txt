Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was seen in the ER of the [**Hospital1 18**] with a Temp of 98.9 F
PO, HR 68, BP 108/64 (orthostasis not reported), RR 16, SaO2 98%
on RA on [**2111-7-10**]. He was complaining of severe abdominal pain
in the right flank. Patient's BP was stable during the ER stay
and patient did not vomit blood. 2 large-bore IVs were put in
place (R forearm and L AC), patient received a total of 12 mg of
morphine IV. SBP prophylaxis was started with 1g of ceftriaxone
IV x1. Patient was admitted to the [**Location (un) 2452**] MICU.

In the MICU patient had an EGD done the same day of admission,
which showed no esophageal varices, food in the stomach as well
as thick veins with classic changes associated with protal
hypertension. Patient was started on ocreotide gtt, IV PPIs and
nadolol. A diagnostic parasentesis was done in the right side,
which showed less than 250 WBC and no organisms seen on gram
stain. An abdominal CT showed no evidence of choelltihiasis, but
no colecystitis. LFTs were normal, except for TB 1.5. Patient
had bowel movements. Patient was contninued most of his home
medications.

Patient has a guardian, who is his brother. The contact
information we received were [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname 15670**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 79322**] and
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1258**] [**Known lastname 15670**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 79323**].

The following day patient was transferred to the kidney-liver
floor in [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 10. He was switched from CTX to ciprofloxacin PO.
Patient HCT was stable, did not have hematemesis for 24 hours
and was able to tolerat [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] ocreaotide drip was stopped.

Patient kept improving in the floor. Was tolerating PO, denied
nausea and vomit. Patient only complained of pain and requested
stronger pain medications. However, on physical exam patient
only had mild pain on deep palpation in the upper R quadrant.
Pain changed with every exam. Patient received only morphine PO
2-3 times per day.

The abdomen became tense on HD4, so a therapeutic parasentesis
was done, which drained 6.2 L. Fluid was sent for analysis and
had 220 WBC, 1.4g/L of albumin and 2.5 g/L of protein. Patient
was given 50g of albumin afterwards and his VS were monitored.
He was stable overnight. His only complain was mild right lower
quadrant pain.

His creatinine on discharge was 0.6, with a stable hematocrit of
28.5, WBC 6.7 and plt of 175. His vital signs are stable, he has
no orthostasis and is able to deambulate. He is tolerating PO.

Time was spent explaining the importance of quitting alcohol
ASAP and how it will benefit him. Time was spent discussing how
lactulose will help him get back to normal his day-night cycle
and how the diuretics with a low salt diet can prevent the fluid
from re-accumulating. Patient was given warning signs and
symptoms to come back to the hopsital.
