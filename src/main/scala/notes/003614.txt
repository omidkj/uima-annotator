HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 49 year old male with
a past medical history of Hepatitis C and alcoholic hepatitis
and cirrhosis which is complicated by three to four months of
ascites and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.  He had
extensive ascites and a history of a gastrointestinal bleed.
No history of encephalopathy; no history of hypertension;
diabetes mellitus; asthma or epilepsy.

He was admitted for an elective TIPSS procedure for the
indication of his refractory ascites which was requiring
paracentesis every five days.  Prior to the procedure a
routine EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with decreased
voltage.  A chest x-ray showed question of interstitial lung
disease with reticular shadowing.  An echocardiogram showed
mild pulmonary artery hypertension but normal systolic
function with an ejection fraction greater than 55%.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis C and alcohol.
2.  Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
3.  History of upper gastrointestinal bleed.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

ALLERGIES:   Codeine.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aldactone 50 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Lasix 120 mg twice a day.
3.  Inderal 10 mg twice a day.
4.  Imdur 30 mg q. day.
5.  Lactulose.
6.  Protonix.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   The patient lives with his mother.  [**Name (NI) **] has
a history of tobacco and extensive alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Temperature 98.5 F.; blood pressure
94/66; respiratory rate 20; pulse 86; oxygen saturation 91%
on room air.  The patient in general is in no acute distress.
He is alert and oriented times three.  His Head, Eyes, Ears,
Nose and Throat are remarkable for the absence of icterus.
His neck is supple without bruits.  His chest is clear
bilaterally without crackles or wheezes.  His heart has a
regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
His abdomen is soft and nontender, with extensive ascites to
percussion.  His extremities have no edema.  Neurologically,
he has no flap.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 10.9; hematocrit 47.3,
platelets 116.  Sodium 129, potassium 4.2, chloride 97;
bicarbonate 28, BUN 19, creatinine 1.1, glucose 96.  ALT 37,
AST 66, alkaline phosphatase 120, total bilirubin 1.0, direct
bilirubin 0.4, albumin 2.3.  Alpha fetoprotein 1.7.  HIV
serology is negative.

EKG as noted above.  Echocardiogram as noted above.  Chest
x-ray as noted above.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted for elective
TIPSS procedure for his refractory ascites.  Prior to
admission he was noted to have a question of interstitial
lung disease on routine chest x-ray.  An echocardiogram
showed mild pulmonary hypertension and normal systolic
function.  He underwent the procedure on [**2107-1-11**].
The procedure was complicated by desaturation of his oxygen
levels to 89% and drop in his blood pressure to the 80s.  His
heart rate was also in the 150s.  He became agitated and his
oxygen saturation dropped further.  He was given Adenosine
without effect.  His endotracheal tube was suctioned with
copious white clear secretions and improved compliance.  He
was then given Esmolol which, as his heart rate was elevated,
with a decrease in his heart rate to 116 and the blood
pressure in the 120s.

Extubation was then attempted, however, the patient did not
tolerate extubation and he was quickly re-intubated.  His
blood pressure again dropped to 80 systolic and a STAT chest
x-ray showed that he was in congestive heart failure.  He was
given Lasix, Midazolam, and transferred to the Post
Anesthesia Care Unit where he became unstable.  He was
started on Levophed which initially had good effect with
elevation in his blood pressure to 130s and heart rate to
100.

His oxygen saturation remained in the 90s.  At that point,
the Medical Intensive Care Unit Service was consulted.  An
emergent echocardiogram revealed extensive left ventricular
dysfunction and an ejection fraction of less than 20% with
global hypokinesis, right ventricular dilatation and
dysfunction.  The patient was continued on Levophed.  A
Swan-Ganz catheter was passed which revealed a pulmonary
wedge pressure of 30 and a systemic vascular resistance of
1,016 and a cardiac output of 4.8 with an index of 2.58.

The patient was started empirically on broad-spectrum
antibiotics.  His ascitic fluid which had been removed prior
to the TIPSS procedure was not indicative of SBP.  Cardiac
enzymes indicated that the patient did not have a myocardial
infarction.

The patient was started on Dobutamine in addition to Levophed
for inotropic support.  During his hospital course, the
patient remained hypoxic and hypotensive.  The source for his
heart failure remained unclear.  It was felt that most likely
he had an underlying cardiomyopathy that was exacerbated
and/or revealed by the hemodynamic changes from the TIPSS
procedure.  Repeated blood cultures and ascites cultures were
negative.  The patient was continued on pressors and
broad-spectrum antibiotics and remained intubated.

He did develop low-grade DIC as indicated by his hematology
labs.  Repeated attempts to wean off his pressor support were
unsuccessful.  Ultimately, given the patient's extensive
underlying disease and poor overall prognosis, after
extensive discussion between the Medical Team and the
patient's family, the family elected to withdraw care.

Care was withdrawn on [**2107-1-26**], after meeting with
the family and answering all their questions.  The patient
expired on [**2107-1-26**], of cardiac failure and hepatic
failure following TIPSS for refractory ascites from alcoholic
and viral hepatitis.

DIAGNOSES AT DEATH:
1.  Congestive heart failure.
2.  Hepatic failure.
3.  Status post TIPSS.
4.  DIC.
