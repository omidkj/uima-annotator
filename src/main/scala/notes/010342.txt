Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Thoracic Surgery Service at
[**Hospital1 18**] on [**2146-9-17**] under Dr.[**Name (NI) 1816**] care.  Patient was
sedated/intubated upon arrival and on clindamycin-he was
switched to vancomycin and meropenem upon admission.  A chest CT
scan again demonstrated residual areas, particularly in the left
lower paravertebral sulcus, along the edge of the diaphragm.  A
second chest tube was then placed on the left and drained a
significant amount of fluid.  Over the next few days, attempts
to wean from the ventilator had failed.  Because of continuing
low grade temperatures, elevated white blood cell counts and
failure to wean from the ventilator, it was decided to return to
the operating room.  On [**2146-9-21**], the patient underwent a video
assisted thoracoscopy, decortication/clean-out and empyema
drainage.  A flexible bronchoscopy was also done to rule-out a
bronchopleural fistula.  For details of the procedures, see
operative note.

Patient's post-operative course was significant for continued
fevers (for which multiple cooling modalities were tried),
elevated blood sugar levels (on insulin gtt while in unit, SQ
NPH insulin while on floor), pulmonary edema following
extubation on [**2146-9-23**] (treated with lasix and face mask
oxygen), intermittent states of confusion/ICU psychosis (which
completely resolved by [**2146-10-1**]), and a sacro-coccygeal
decubitus ulcer.

Patient finally defervesced on [**9-23**] and has remained afebrile
throughout the remainder of his hospital course.  Blood and
urine, C. difficile and pleural fluid cultures have been
negative to date.  A sputum culture sent on [**9-22**] grew
methicilin resistant Staph. aureus.  He was finally transferred
to the floor on [**2146-9-26**].

On [**2146-9-26**], a Speech and Swallow study had been performed for
inability to clear secretions, concerns of aspiration and
aphonia following extubation.  This was followed by a video
swallow study on [**2146-9-27**].  Both reports showed overt
aspiration; patient was maintained NPO.  ENT evaluated the
patient on [**2146-9-28**] and felt that his aphonia was due to
pulmonary deconditioning and that it would slowly resolve.  He
is asked to follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in ENT in [**12-10**] weeks.  On
follow-up video swallow ([**2146-10-3**]) patient was phonating much
better and clearing secretions spontaneously.  His diet was
advanced to a regular diet following teaching strategies for
eating and medications were allowed to be given whole with
pureed foods.

On [**2146-9-29**], the patient had fallen out of bed despite
restraints.  Follow-up films were negative for any traumatic
injury.  The remainder of his hospital course was benign; he
continued with physical therapy and conditioning.

On [**2146-10-4**], Vascular surgery had kindly seen the patient
regarding complaints of the patient's left 5th toe being dusky
black/purple.  He was deemed as having a small blister that was
resolving and in no immediate threat of limb loss, etc.  He is
asked to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] in Vascular Surgery in [**12-10**]
weeks for further care and evaluation especially given his
history of diabetes and slight peripheral neuropathy.

Furthermore, he was deemed able to go to rehab by the surgical
team and was discharged on [**2146-10-4**], POD#14-ambulating with
assistance, tolerating a regular diabetic diet and voiding
spontaneously.  He is also to continue on linezloid for another
14 days and his current regimen of 18 units of NPH insulin [**Hospital1 **].
He is asked to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] in [**12-10**] weeks.
