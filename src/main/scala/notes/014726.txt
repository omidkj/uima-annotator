HISTORY:  Mr. [**Known lastname 13621**] is a 58-year-old Spanish-speaking male
from the [**Country 13622**] Republic with the history of myocardial
infarction as per his report with chest pains over the course
of 1?????? months prior to admission that were initially
associated with exertion.  The chest pains were located
centrally in the chest and were associated with sweating,
shortness of breath, and inability to move when the patient
had "angina."  The patient's symptoms resolved in seconds
with one sublingual Nitroglycerin; however, the day before
admission he had to take two sublingual Nitroglycerin to
relieve his symptoms.  He denied any chest pain at rest.  The
patient reported that this primarily occurs only when he
demonstrated extreme exertion.  He denied any chest pain,
ankle edema, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  He
denied fever, cough, dizziness, blood in the stool, melena,
peripheral vascular disease, night sweats, or chills.  The
patient had been in the [**Country 13622**] Republic for the past 1??????
years until he came back to the United States.  Within a few
days he saw his primary care physician who recommended he be
admitted for coronary catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The past medical history includes
coronary artery disease with history of myocardial infarction
in [**2123**] in the [**Country 13622**] Republic and myocardial infarction
in [**2128**] also in the [**Country 13622**] Republic.  The patient may
possibly have had a stress test done in [**2128**] in the [**Country 13622**]
Republic; however he declined catheterization in the past.
The past medical history also includes diabetes mellitus
occasionally with low fingersticks, hypertension, amoebic
dysentery five years ago, and anemia.

MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, Glucotrol 10 mg p.o. q.d., Atenolol 25
mg p.o. q.d., and Diltiazem 60 mg p.o. q. day with or without
Amlodipine 10 mg p.o. q.d.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a tobacco smoking history of
approximately one pack per day for four years.  He had
reportedly quit the use of alcohol for a year, however,
according to his wife he is an occasional binge drinker.  He
is married and has one 21 year old son and one 7 year old
son.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The review of systems is as above.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature was 98.1, heart rate 100,
blood pressure 126/82, O2 saturation 96% on room air.  In
general, the patient was alert and oriented.  HEENT
examination demonstrated clear oropharynx.  Sclerae were
anicteric.  The neck was supple.  There was JVP of
approximately 8 cm.  The chest demonstrated crackles
bilaterally at the bases approximately one-quarter of the way
up the chest.  On cardiovascular examination, the patient had
a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2, positive S3,
and positive S4.  There were no murmurs and there were no
rubs.  Abdominal examination revealed a soft, nontender, and
nondistended abdomen with positive bowel sounds.  The
extremities revealed no edema.  Rectal examination was
declined by the patient, reportedly occult blood negative on
[**2131-4-4**] as per the primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) 13623**]
examination was intact for cranial nerves II-XII.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory work from [**2131-4-4**] revealed white
blood cell count 6.6, hematocrit 30.4, platelets 144,000,
sodium 138, potassium 4.5, chloride 106, bicarbonate 23, BUN
14, creatinine 1.1, glucose 99.  Hemoglobin A1C was 6.3.  AST
was 80, iron 30, B12 275, folate 9.3, ferritin 58, LDL 48,
HDL 14.  Electrocardiogram demonstrated a rate of 95 with a
normal axis.  PR interval was 250.  No ST or T wave changes
were noted as compared to [**2128-4-4**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Therefore the patient was admitted with the
diagnosis of increasing angina although he was pain free at
the time of admission.  He was taken to the Coronary
Catheterization Laboratory where he was found to have
significant three vessel disease with a mildly decreased
ejection fraction.  On hospital day #4, the patient was taken
to the Operating Room under the care of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 13624**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10102**]
where he underwent coronary artery bypass graft times five
vessels with LIMA to the left anterior descending artery,
saphenous vein graft to the RPDA, saphenous vein graft to the
diagonal, saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal, and
saphenous vein graft to a ramus of the posterior descending
artery.  He also had a mitral valve replacement with a 31 mm
mechanical valve.  He also underwent endarterectomy of the
right posterior descending artery.  The patient tolerated the
procedure well and was transferred to the Cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit while being AV paced on Levophed,
Milrinone, and Propofol.  The patient was doing well and was
extubated by postoperative day #1 with his major complaint
being pain.  As he was stable, he was seen by physical
therapy who recommended mostly patient education and
ambulation.  The patient was transferred to the floor and on
postoperative day #2, he was found to have continuous large
chest tube output which had been only gradually improving
since the time of surgery.  The patient became slightly
dehydrated from the amount of fluid that drained from his
bilateral chest tubes.  His urine output was low and the
patient was resuscitated with crystalloid.  This did not
completely resolve his physical findings therefore the
patient was transfused with a unit of packed red blood cells
and given Lasix to help prevent fluid overload.  The patient
was at this point considered to be in mild left ventricular
failure due to the increased workload of the replaced mitral
valve.  The mediastinal tubes were removed at that point and
the patient was treated with long-acting pain medications as
well as short-acting pain medications for breakthrough pain.
He was at that point also noted to be in a junctional rhythm
rather than in a sinus rhythm.  The patient recovered from
the junctional rhythm when his blood pressure recovered and
diuresis was commenced the following day.  The patient
tolerated this well and on postoperative day #4 after the
chest tubes had been discontinued and the patient was feeling
as though there was better control of the pain, he was still
requiring a fair amount of oxygen, approximating an O2
saturation of 100% on 65 liters of oxygen per nasal cannula.
The patient was sent for a chest x-ray which demonstrated a
loculated pleural fluid collection; however there was no
evidence of failure.  The patient was maintaining a sinus
rhythm at 80 and his wires were capped.  Diuresis was
continued and the patient was still having a difficult time
cooperating in physical therapy.  On postoperative day #6, it
was noted that the patient had blisters/bullae along his
incision at the areas were the Steri-Strips were contacting
the skin.  The patient was therefore placed on Levofloxacin
on postoperative day #6 in the event that these
bullae/blisters could become superinfected and in this
diabetic patient complicate his saphenectomy.  The patient
was noted to be somewhat confused on the morning of
postoperative day #7.  This had been elucidated to occur as
previously in the mornings at approximately 5:00 in the
morning.  This would resolve after a couple of hours when
daylight came and the patient was participating in normal
daily activities.  The patient was ambulating on his own
independent of any oxygen supply at this point and discharge
plans were made.  The patient had demonstrated a run of what
appeared to be a wide complex tachycard
