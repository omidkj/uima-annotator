Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
Chset pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with BMS x2 to LAD
Tandem heart
ECMO
arterial line
indwelling port

History of Present Illness:
A 53 yo F with h/o of CAD s/p IMI ([**2183**], no PCI), CVA, HIV (on
HAART, CD4 47, VL ND [**5-/2191**]), HCV, HLD, HTN, who is transferred
to the CCU after cardiac cath complicated by biventricular
failure hypotension and PEA arrest.
.
She was initially admitted to the [**Hospital1 1516**] service [**7-21**] with
substernal chest pain radiating to her back, made worse with
inspiration which awoke her from sleep. The pain did not improve
and she presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 98.8 111 117/86 16 100%3L NC. EKG
showed sinus at 115, diffuse low voltage, old Q waves in
inferior leads, RBBB, unchanged. Labs were remarkalbe for
Troponin 1.05, CKMB 16.3. CXR showed no acute process and LENI
of LLE revealed no DVT. ECHO shows trace effusion with no
tamponade. Patient given ASA, morphine, with relief of chest
pain and started on heparin gtt.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 1516**] service she was lethargic which was
attributed to morphine. She was initially chest pain free
however she developed 5/10 chest pain simliar to presentation
and hypoxia to 80's on room air, and hypotension to 80's, she
was placed on 6LNC with sats 100%. She was taken for emergent
cath which showed a thrombus in the LAD thrombectomy was
performed and a BMS placed. Right heart cath showed mean right
atrial pressure of 32 and capillary wedge pressure 25mmhg
consistent with biventricular failure. A baloon pump was placed
and she underwent rapid sequence intubation with 10mg etomidate
and 80mg rocuronium. She developed bradycarida, hypotension and
PEA arrest at approximately 5:30PM CPR was initiated, she
received epinephrine, atropine, vasopression and was
cardioverted x1. Chest compressions were interrupted by
placement of tandem heart. After 30 minutes return of
circulation was achieved. Repeat cardiac cath showed instent
rethrombosis at the LAD and a second BMS was placed.
.
Tandem heart catheter was initially placed in the left artrium
and she developed hypotension, ECHO showed severely dialated RV.
The catheter was pulled into the right atrium and she was placed
on ECMO. She was started on dopamine, norepinephrine and
epinephrine drips.
.
On arrival to the ICU she was intubated on assist control tidal
volume 460, rr 22, 100%FiO2, Peep of 5, initial vitals were
bp:106/93 p87 on norephinephrine, epinephrine and dopamine.
Propofol had been held for >30 minutes and patient was
unresponsive and unable to contirubte further to history.

ECHO ([**2191-7-22**]): There is severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with basal and mid anteroseptal,anterior
and anterolateral akinesis with basal and mid inferoseptal,
inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis. Due to poor image
quality further analysis of regional wall motion abnormality
cannot be performed. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is severely depressed (LVEF<20 %). The only left ventricular
segment displaying relatively preserved contractile function is
the basal posterolateral wall. The right ventricular cavity is
markedly dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
Aortic regurgitation is seen (not quantitated). Severe tricuspid
regurgitation is present.

Compared with the findings of the initial report on [**2191-7-21**], the
left ventricular function has improved, but remains severely
depressed. Right ventricular pressure and volume overload
(causing septal wall flattening) is no longer appreciated.
Aortic excursion has also improved

.
CXR ([**2191-7-22**]): The presumed TandemHeart catheter extends from the
upper abdomen where it passes out of view to the SVC at the
level of the azygos insertion.  Cardiomegaly has improved
substantially, but moderately severe pulmonary edema has
worsened over the past 4/1/2 hours. ET tube is in standard
placement.  Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of
view. Esophageal probe ends above the level of the left atrium.
Right subclavian infusion port ends in the upper SVC. No
pneumothorax. Pleural effusions are small, if any.


Brief Hospital Course:
A 53 yo F with h/o of CAD s/p IMI ([**2183**], no PCI), CVA, HIV (on
HAART, CD4 47, VL ND [**5-/2191**]), HCV, HLD, HTN, who is transferred
to the CCU after cardiac cath complicated by biventricular
failure hypotension and PEA arrest.  Family eventually made
decision to withdraw care.
.
# Hypotension: Pt was hypotensive when received at the ICU, and
was initially maintained on norepinephrine, epinephrine, and
doapmine.  Right heart catheterization showed elevated right
atrial pressure and elevated capillary wedge pressure consistent
with
