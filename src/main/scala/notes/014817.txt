LSpineXR:
1. Wedging of lower thoracic vertebra, worrisome for fracture.

structurally normal c/ trivial mitral regurg. Mod. pulm artery
systolic HTN. No pericardial effusion.

LENIs:  Acute occlusive thrombus within the left greater
saphenous vein, extending to the sapheno-femoral junction.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 61 year old man admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] after a traumatic
fall that resulted in numerous facial fractures; on admission he
was intoxicated but hemodynamically stable.  He was admitted to
the T-SICU for frequent neurologic checks and monitoring for
alcohol withdrawal; neurosurgery, plastic surgery, opthalmology
and hematology consults were obtained.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] was evaluated by plastic surgery who determined that
the facial fractures are non-operable.  Opthalmology recommended
opthalmologic ointment applied to his prosthetic eye.
Neurosurgery re-evaluted the head CT and felt that the subdural
hemorrhage noted on the admission CT may actually be the result
of volume-averaging.

A CTA was preformed as the CXR demonstrated mediastinal
widening.  The CTA showed a small segmental PE.  LENIs were
performed that showed a supericial thrombosis in the left
greater saphenous vein.  Due to the presence of VTEs and the
relative contraindication to anticoagulation in the setting of
an acute SDH, an IVC filter was placed.  Hematology was
consulted to consider appropriate work-up and provide advice
regarding anticoagulation. Given the risk of a significant bleed
should Mr. [**Known lastname **] have another traumatic injury, the Hematology
team recommended that the decision regarding starting
anticoagulation be delayed to the outpatient setting and be made
in conjunction with his PCP with whom he has had a longstanding
relationship.  Mr. [**Known lastname **] will need to follow up with his PCP to
ensure continued, appropriate cancer surveillance (including
colorectal and prostate screening).  Mr. [**Known lastname **] and his PCP will
discuss further Hematology evaluation and whether to start
anticoagulation - Mr. [**Known lastname 69795**] risk for fall should be a factor
in this decision.

While in the TSICU, Mr. [**Known lastname **] developed atrial fibrillation but
converted to NSR without intervention.

Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) **] was discharged on HD#3 with follow-up appointments
with his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] eye clinic, plastic surgery, and Hematology.

Discharge Instructions:
You were seen in the Emergency Department following a fall down
stairs.  You landed directly on your face.  As a result of this
fall, you have numerous facial fractures, however they are small
and do not require surgery.  As a result of the fall, you also
had a small bleed in your brain (subdural hemorrhage).  You also
have a compression fracture in your lower spine, but it is not
clear if this is new or old.

You were also found also have a small clot in your lung and a
clot in a vein in your leg.  To help prevent the leg clot from
traveling from traveling to other parts of your lung, a filter
was placed in your inferior vena cava (IVC).  You will need to
follow-up with a Hematologist to discuss whether to start
anticoagulation (medications to prevent future clots, but
increase your risk of bleeding if you fall or hurt yourself).

During your stay in the hospital, your heart went into an
abnormal rhythm called "atrial fibrillation" but this resolved
on its own.

Due to the facial fractures, you need to protect your nose and
sinuses.  You should not blow your nose, you should not use
straws, you should not use nasal sprays and you should not put
anything up in your nose.  Additionally, you should sleep with
your head elevated (i.e. on at least two pillows).

You should gently wash the abrasions (scrapes) on your face with
soap and water an
