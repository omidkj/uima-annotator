History of Present Illness:
This is an 83-year-old gentleman who
had had an MI [**77**] years ago and has hypertension, congestive
heart failure and hypercholesterolemia.  The patient had an
abnormal stress test, following which he had a cardiac
catheterization which revealed severe triple vessel disease.
The cardiac catheterization revealed disease in the LAD,
diagonal and right pulmonary artery.  The patient was,
therefore, referred for us for elective coronary artery
bypass grafting.  His preoperative echocardiogram showed an
ejection fraction between 30-35%.

Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.

regurgitation is seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
operating room on [**2158-1-5**] where he underwent cabgx3 with Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **].
 Please see op report for further details.  Overall the patient
tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred in stable condition to the CVICU for further
observation and invasive monitoring.  POD 1 found the patient
extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.  He was

neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no
vasoactive support.  He was found suitable for
transfer to telemetry on POD 2. Beta
blockade and diuresis were initiated. Chest tubes and pacing
wires were
discontinued without complication.  The patient went into a rate
controlled atrial fibrillation.  Beta blocker was titrated
accordingly.  He will not be anti-coagulated due to his fall
risk and co-morbidities which include Crohn's disease.
Physical therapy was
consulted for assistance with post-operative strength and
mobility.  The patient progressed as planned through the cardiac

surgery pathway.  By POD 4  the wound
was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  He
was discharged to rehab on POD 5.
