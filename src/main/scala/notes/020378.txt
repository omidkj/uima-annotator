ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:

1.  Recurrent diverticulitis with abscess
2.  Hypovolemia

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Recurrent diverticulitis/status post sigmoid colectomy
with primary colorectal anastomosis and diverting ileostomy.
2.  Pelvic abscess with VRE
3.  Acute Lung Injury from Sepsis
4.  Congestive heart failure.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 46-year-old
female with a history of diverticulitis with the first
episode in [**2110-2-23**] which had essentially resolved by
mid [**Month (only) 956**] who returned to the Emergency Department at the
[**Hospital6 256**] on [**4-6**] with
complaints of fairly acute onset of lower abdominal and
pelvic pain which was greater on the left than on the right.

She noted that she had some fever and chills and had been
taking some antibiotics as an outpatient.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  When she initially
presented, her temperature was 102.2??????, with a pulse of 95,
blood pressure 121/69, respirations 18, 96% on room air.
General:  She otherwise did not appear to be in any distress.
HEENT:  She had no adenopathy.  Heart: Heart was regular.
Lungs: Exam was noted to be clear.  Abdomen:  Exam showed
tenderness most in the left lower quadrant with some mild
tenderness in the right lower quadrant.  She otherwise had
some rebound and actually some rigidity of the left lower
quadrant as per the records.  Rectal:  Her rectal exam was
heme positive, but there was no mass, and there were no areas
of tenderness.  Extremities:  Warm and well perfused.

LABORATORY DATA:  On arrival her white count was 8.2,
hematocrit 40.4, 93% neutrophils; admission urinalysis was
unremarkable; admission BUN and creatinine were 17 and 0.8
respectively.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent a CT scan while in
the Emergency Department to confirm what was felt to be
likely a second episode of diverticulitis.  CT showed
complicated inflammatory changes in the sigmoid and rectum
with two abscesses in the pelvis.  These abscesses were
determined to be too small to be drained percutaneously.

Given her diagnosis, she was admitted and made NPO and placed
on aggressive fluids for resuscitation.  Broad-spectrum
antibiotics (Levofloxacin and Flagyl) were begun.

The initial portion of her hospital stay was aimed at
conservative management of this episode of diverticulitis as
noted with bowel rest and with antibiotic therapy and serial
abdominal exams.

She continued on this course for several days, and by
hospital day #3, was actually felt to possibly be improving.
However, subsequently over the hospital days #4 and #5, it
was noted that her abdominal exam continue to worsen, and she
continued to run a low-grate temperature.

By hospital day #6, the patient had failed a trial a clears
and had worsening abdominal pain, and therefore, she again
was made NPO.  It was decided that she would undergo
operative intervention.

There was a thought to be repeat the CT scan to check for
enlargement of pelvic abscesses.  It was felt that she would
need surgery, and so the CT scan was not performed.

On hospital day #8, after receiving a bowel prep, the patient
was taken to the Operating Room and underwent a sigmoid
colectomy with a diverting loop ileostomy and also rigid
sigmoidoscopy.

Intraoperatively we found multiple diverticula with abscesses
in the left pelvis.  The patient tolerated the procedure well
and was taken to the PACU.

She remained in the PACU over night for monitoring of her
oxygen status.  It was felt that she may have had a transient
episode of bacteremia after her procedure, but by
postoperative day #1, she was taken to the floor, where she
was closely monitored for some low urine output, which was
just felt to be secondary to volume deficit.

However, on the night of postoperative day #1, the patient
actually had  worsening oxygen saturations, which upon
work-up were thought to be possibly consistent with volume
overload.  Given her procedure, ..................., and she
was therefore transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.

Here she required aggressive treatment with chest
physiotherapy and initially a nonrebreather but was
subsequently weaned down to oxygen via face mask and finally
to oxygen via nasal cannula.  The patient never required
intubation.

While in the Intensive Care Unit, the patient otherwise
remained stable.  She was somewhat tachycardiac, but again
this was felt to be secondary to a combination of the stress
response she was under, and possibly pain.

She was, as noted, significantly positive in terms of her
fluid balance, up to 10 L.
