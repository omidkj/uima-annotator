History of Present Illness:
MR. [**Known lastname 10794**] is a 52 year-old man with NICM ([**10/2195**]-LVEF 20% and
1+ MR), and type 1 diabetes mellitus who presented to ED with
SOB. Patient reports running out of lasix 4 days PTA. He further
described cough, SOB, orthopnea and slightly worse LE edema 2
days PTA. And presented to the ED on [**12-7**] with worsened SOB at
rest.

In the ED, initial vitals 130/91 139 36 99% CPAP. His exam
notable for 2 sentence dyspnea, crackles to BL mid-lung fields.
Labs notable for WBC count of 11.3 w/ 85% PMNs, HCT 32.1, BNP
2361, creatinine 0.9, trop 0.02. ABG: 7.43 pCO2 34 pO2 324 on
BiPap. CXR with diffuse bilateral airspace opacities initally
though to be asymetric pulmonary edema. The patient was started
on nitro gtt and given lasix 80IV. He was then admitted to the
CCU.

In the CCU, he was continued on lasix IV in the CCU and achieved
1L liter length of stay fluid balance without significant
improvement in respirtory status. A CTA Chest was performed that
identified bilateral parenchymal opacities consistent with
multifocal PNA and inconsistent with pulmonary edema. The
patient was started on Cefepime, Azithromycin, Vancomycin and
Bactrim. The patient was febrile to 101.2 on [**12-9**] and the
decision was then made to transfer the patient to the MIUC.
Vitals on transfer were 100.0 103 82/51 96% 6L NC.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 10794**] is a 52y/o gentleman with nonischemic cardiomyopathy
who presented from home with progressively worsening shortness
of breath for two days and was found to be in hypoxic
respiratory distress due to multifocal PNA.  He was intubated,
stabilized in the MICU with antibiotics, and was transitioned to
the medical floor where he was weaned to room air and was
discharged home.

ACTIVE ISSUES

#. Acute respiratory failure: due to multifocal PNA.
He was intubated and at first his presentation was concerning
for CHF exacerbation.  Was initially admitted to the Cardiac ICU
and was diuresed, but when he spiked a fever and became
tachycardic in the setting of leukocytosis as well, a CTA was
performed which ruled out PE but showed multifocal PNA so
diuresis was stopped and he was started on antibiotics and
transferred to the MICU for further management (see below).

#. Multifocal pneumonia: Clinically resolved by discharge.
He has a history
