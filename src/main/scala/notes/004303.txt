Service:  [**Doctor Last Name 1181**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 87-year-old
Vietnamese woman with numerous medical problems (noted
below), who was residing at [**Hospital3 2558**] when she fell on
[**2131-12-29**].  Reportedly, the patient did not sustain
any injuries at that time, and her vital signs were stable.
The patient fell again at approximately 1 A.M. on [**2131-12-30**].  At 4:45 P.M. that same day, she was found
unresponsive, lethargic, and hypotensive (blood pressure
90/60), with room air saturations of 54% (she subsequently
had saturations of 75% on 4 liters of oxygen).  EMS was
called, and the patient was brought to the [**Hospital1 346**] Emergency Department, where her
blood pressure was 96/41, and her finger stick was 384.  The
patient was also noted at that time to be in wide complex
tachycardia.  She was given calcium chloride, which for a
time converted her QRS to a narrow complex, however, it
subsequently reverted back to wide complex.  The patient was
intubated at approximately 5:30 P.M. on [**2131-12-30**], for
hypoventilation and respiratory failure.  The patient's
admission laboratories were notable for hyperkalemia to 9.3.
This specimen was felt to be hemolyzed, and a subsequent
potassium was found to be 7.5.  The patient was also found to
be in acute renal failure, and hyperglycemic to 402, with a
sodium of 117.

As noted, the patient has numerous medical issues.  Also she
has had hyperkalemia on three prior hospitalizations over the
past year.  The exact etiology of this (and her
hyponatremia), with acute renal failure, is unknown.  Past
ACTH stim test was normal on a recent admission.

The patient was admitted initially to the Intensive Care
Unit.  There, her course went fairly smoothly, and she showed
marked improvement.  The patient was extubated on [**2132-1-1**].  She subsequently had an episode of post-extubation
stridor, which resolved after the administration of steroids,
nebulizers, and racemic epinephrine.

The patient continued to do well and, on [**2132-1-2**],
she was transferred to the Medicine floor, [**Doctor Last Name **] firm.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Diabetes mellitus Type 2
2.  Coronary artery disease status post rest Thallium with
anterior and apical defects, which were fixed
3.  Congestive heart failure, ejection fraction of 20%, focal
hypokinesis of the right ventricle, severe regional left
ventricular dysfunction, 1 to 2+ aortic insufficiency, 2+
mitral regurgitation, 2+ tricuspid regurgitation, moderate
pulmonary hypertension
4.  Complete heart block/? sick sinus syndrome, status post
DDD pacemaker placement
5.  Chronic renal insufficiency, creatinine running between
1.2 and 1.6, status post hemodialysis for acute renal failure
in [**2131-7-28**]
6.  Dementia
7.  Depression
8.  Hyponatremia, episode in [**2131-3-27**] felt secondary to
serum-inappropriate antidiuretic hormone
9.  ? upper gastrointestinal bleed in [**2131-7-28**],
nasogastric lavage negative

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:
1.  Bactrim double strength one by mouth twice a day
2.  Trazodone 25 mg as needed
3.  Glipizide 2.5 mg once daily
4.  Niferex
5.  Isordil 5 mg three times a day
6.  Hydralazine 10 mg four times a day
7.  Aricept 5 mg once daily
8.  Protonix 40 mg once daily
9.  Enteric-coated aspirin
10. Insulin sliding scale

SOCIAL HISTORY:   The patient is Vietnamese.  She has no
tobacco or alcohol history.  She has been a resident of
[**Hospital3 2558**] Nursing Home.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On presentation, per Medical
Intensive Care Unit house staff, vital signs:  Blood pressure
195/75, heart rate 70, respirations 90, oxygen saturation
100% while intubated.  General:  Sedated, intubated.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils pinpoint bilaterally,
right greater than left (1.5 mm).  Neck:  Without jugular
venous distention.  Chest:  Examination revealed right-sided
rhonchi and left side clear to auscultation.  Cardiovascular:
Regular rate, positive systolic ejection murmur heard
maximally at the apex.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender,
nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  Without
edema, toes dry. Neurologic:  Corneal reflexes sluggish
bilaterally, patient winces with very deep painful stimuli,
moves all extremities and does so symmetrically; deep tendon
reflexes 1+ throughout.

LABORATORY DATA:   On presentation, CBC revealed a white
count of 11, hematocrit 36.5.  Chem 7 revealed a sodium of
117, potassium initially 9.3 (subsequently 7.5), chloride 88,
bicarbonate 17, BUN 35, creatinine 2.4, glucose 402.  CK was
137, with an MB fraction of 5, troponin less than .1.  Coag
studies revealed an INR of 1.2, PT 13.0, PTT 32.6.  Calcium
was 9.4, magnesium 2.3, phos 7.2.  Arterial blood gas
revealed a pH of 7.22, PCO2 47, PO2 458.  Urinalysis was
negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   As noted above, the patient was intubated
and subsequently admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.  She
did well in the Intensive Care Unit and, on [**2132-1-1**],
was extubated.  She experienced a brief episode of
post-extubation stridor, which resolved following the
administration of steroids, nebulizers, and racemic
epinephrine.  The patient continued to improve and, on
[**2132-1-2**], she was transferred to the Medicine floor,
[**Doctor Last Name **] firm.

It should be noted, as mentioned above, that the patient
during at least three prior hospitalizations over the past
year, has had hyperkalemia (she has also had hyponatremia).
The exact etiology for these electrolyte disturbances remains
unclear.  A past ACTH stim test was normal on a recent
admission.  It should be noted that, at the time of this
discharge, the patient has renin levels and aldosterone
levels which are pending.  This has been discussed with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 5762**], who will follow up on the results following the
patient's discharge.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:   Vital signs stable, afebrile.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Acute renal failure/chronic renal insufficiency
2.  Hyperkalemia
3.  Dementia
4.  Coronary artery disease
5.  Diabetes mellitus Type 2
6.  Congestive heart failure
7.  Status post DDD pacemaker placement

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Colace 100 mg by mouth twice a day
2.  Zantac 150 mg by mouth twice a day
3.  Regular insulin sliding scale
4.  Albuterol nebulizer every four hours as needed
5.  Atrovent nebulizer every four hours as needed
6.  Tylenol 650 mg by mouth every six hours as needed

FOLLOW UP:  The patient is to be discharged back to [**Hospital3 7511**], where she will continue to be followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
