RADIOLOGY:
[**3-14**]: CT Abdomen/Pelvis
1. Ahaustral colon filled with fluid; findings are nonspecific
but can be seen in C. difficile colitis. Please correlate
clinically.
2. Multiple peripancreatic fluid collections more coalescent
since the last examination.
3. Evidence of aortofemoral bypass, without leak.
4. Similar appearance of renal lesions.
5. Similar appearance of bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.

[**3-14**]: U/S liver/gallbladder
Small amount of fatty sparing around the gallbladder.

[**3-14**]: CXR
Linear atelectasis/scarring in the left lung base. PA and
lateral is recommended for better characterization.

[**3-16**]: Echocardiogram
LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
systolic  function (LVEF>55%). Suboptimal technical quality, a
focal LV wall motion  abnormality cannot be fully excluded. No
resting LVOT gradient.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Borderline normal RV systolic function.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Mildly dilated
ascending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
Minimally increased gradient c/w minimal AS. Trace AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Mild (1+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild
to moderate [[**2-4**]+] TR. Mild PA systolic hypertension.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: No PS.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right
ventricular systolic function is borderline normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient
consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

[**3-16**]: CXR
Swan-Ganz catheter remains in place, but distal tip is difficult
to visualize due to technical factors of the examination.
Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable. Aorta remains
tortuous. There has been decrease in degree of pulmonary
vascular engorgement and perihilar haziness, consistent with
resolving interstitial edema. Patchy and linear opacity in the
left lower lung region has similar appearance to earlier
radiograph dating back to [**2172-2-3**] and favors an area of
atelectasis over an infectious consolidation

[**3-17**]: CXR
Lateral aspect of the left lower chest is excluded from the
examination as the patient is turned to the right. Interstitial
edema has worsened. Severe left mid lung atelectasis is more
pronounced. Moderate enlargement of the heart and distension of
mediastinal vessels is exaggerated by patient positioning.
Tip of the right jugular sheath is at the junction of the
brachiocephalic veins transmitting a catheter that can be traced
as far as the right atrium, but is obscured more distally. No
pneumothorax.

[**3-20**]: CXR
Right PICC line tip is seen in the cavoatrial junction. Discoid
atelectasis in the left lower lobe are unchanged. There is no
pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiac size top
normal.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] after experiencing fevers at
home, 25 days after undergoing an aorto-bifemoral graft repair
of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  A course of Vancomycin, Zosyn,
and Flagyl was instituted.  He was initally admitted to the
vascular surgery floor, but was transferred to the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit after a CT scan demonstrated a
peripancreatic fluid collection that was thought to be the
etiology of these fevers and he demostrated blood pressure
instability.  While in the ICU initially, he required pressor
support to maintain a systolic blood pressure over 100 mmHg.  On
HD3, to more accurately assess his volume and cardiac status, a
Swan-Ganz catheter was placed.  His Dopamine drip was weaned
off.
  His abdominal wound was packed with damp gauze.  On HD4, he
also had the peri-pancreatic fluid collection drained.  On HD5,
he was transferred out of the SICU, and back to the [**Hospital1 **].  On
HD6, input from Infectious disease was requested, and Mr.
[**Known lastname **] antibiotic course was determined to be 4 weeks or
Vancomycin and Zosyn.  A PICC line was placed and his central
line was removed.  Diuresis was continued, and he remained
stable.  Due to elevated blood glucose and the peri-pancreatic
fluid collection, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consult was requested to evaluate
whenther Mr. [**Known lastname **] might need home insulin.  Discharge
planned for home with VNA for VAC care, PICC care, IV
antibiotics and physical therapy. He will continue on Vanco and
Zosyn for an additional 18 days for a total of 4 weeks. Labs
weekly will be obtained and faxed to [**Hospital **] clinic. He will follow
up with both ID and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
