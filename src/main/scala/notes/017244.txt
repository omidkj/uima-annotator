Pertinent Results:
[**2194-9-26**] Echocardiogram

There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis by 2D (doppler interrogation of the aortic
valve was not obtained due to poor image quality). The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

[**2194-9-26**] CT Head
1.  Bifrontal hematomas overlying both orbits.  No retrobulbar
hematoma or
evidence of traumatic globe injury.
2.  No acute intracranial process.
3.  Mucosal thickening of the ethmoid air cells, likely related
to intubation, though no air-fluid levels within the sinuses to
suggest occult fracture.

[**2194-9-26**] CT C-spine

-Non-displaced fracture of the left pedicle of C7
-Possible non-displaced fracture of the anterior tubercle of the
left
transverse process of C7.
-Vertebral artery on the left at the C7 level (seen on CTA
chest) appears
normal without signs of traumatic injury - though more cephalad
vertebral
artery not imaged.

[**2194-9-26**] CT Torso

1.  Endotracheal tube tip at carina, proximal repositioning is
recommended.
2.  Extensive bilateral atelectasis, but no contusion or
hemothorax.
3.  Severe mediastinal lipomatosis, though no mediastinal
hematoma.  No
evidence of traumatic injury to the thoracic aorta.
4.  Fracture of the pedicle of C7 on the left with possible
fracture of the anterior tubercle of the transverse process on
the left, better characterized on cervical spine CT.
Contrast-enhanced vertebral artery at the C7 level appears
normal without evidence of traumatic injury.
5.  Numerous bilateral rib fractures as detailed above.  No
pneumothorax.
6.  Nondisplaced fractures of the left transverse process of the
L1 through L3 vertebral bodies.
7.  Fatty liver

[**2194-9-30**] Left hand film

Three views of the left hand have no comparisons.  There is a
transverse
intra-articular fracture at the base of the distal phalanx of
the ring finger. The fracture line extends to both the volar and
distal aspects of the phalanx with fracture fragments present
along the volar aspect of the joint.  No other fractures,
however, the hand and wrist are subopitmally viewed.  Mild soft
tissue swelling.

[**2194-9-30**] CT Torso

1.  Moderate-sized left pneumothorax without evidence of
tension.  Two left pleural tubes terminate in the posterior left
pleural space.
2.  Subtotal atelectasis of bilateral lower lobes is slightly
increased since prior.  Ground-glass opacities in the upper
lobes, left greater than right, are nonspecific, but compatible
with aspiration or infection in the correct clinical setting.
3.  Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.

4.  New small perihepatic ascites and pelvic fluid.
5.  Numerous osseous injuries, similar to prior, including
slightly displaced fracture of the inferior angle of the left
scapula, bilateral rib fractures with segmental fractures of the
left third through fifth ribs, L1-L3 left transverse process
fractures.

[**2194-9-30**] CT LUE

1.  Comminuted, intra-articular fracture of the base of the
distal phalanx of the left ring finger.  0.4 cm ossific fragment
is present dorsal to the distal head of the intact middle
phalanx of this digit.
2.  Subcentimeter ossific fragments are also present along the
volar aspect of the distal head of the middle phalanx of left
ring finger.  Joint is mild hyperextended.
3.  Ovoid 0.6 cm corticated ossific body adjacent to the ulnar /
distal aspect of the capitate of indeterminant chronicity.  No
evidence for acute fracture of the capitate.
4.  Widening of the scapholunate interval suggestive for
scapholunate ligament injury / disruption.  MR examination of
the left wrist would provide further imaging evaluation if
clinically warranted.

[**2194-10-2**] Echocardiogram

The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF 70%). The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
depressed free wall contractility (the apical half of the RV
free wall appears severely hypokinetic. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Impression: RV dysfunction (? RV contusion)

Compared to prior of [**2194-9-26**], the RV is still hypokinetic
(infundibular/RVOT free wall was severely hypokinetic in prior
study).

[**2194-10-6**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) 2853**]
1. C5-6 interspinous ligamentous edema, consistent with acute
injury;
however, no evidence of ALL or PLL complex or spinal cord
injury.
2. Left C7 pedicle and articular pillar fracture, extending into
superior
articulating facet, without evidence of joint capsular
disruption or alignment abnormality.
3. Moderate C3-4 right neural foraminal narrowing.

[**2194-10-10**] CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY
Though there has been interval resolution of a left pneumothorax
from
[**9-30**], there is little change in segmental atelectasis at
the bilateral lower lobes. There is no pulmonary embolus.
