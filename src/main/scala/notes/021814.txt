70s of cancer (unknown type and site) and 2 brothers that died
stroke and brain cancer. She has 7 children who are healthy. Her
family history is significant for coronary artery disease,
cancer, and diabetes.

Brief Hospital Course:
# SOB: Acute on chronic, likely due to acute pulmonary edema
from volume overload and diastolic CHF in the setting of
hypertensive urgency and tachycardia with function mitral
stenosis.  BNP [**Numeric Identifier 109109**].  IN the MICU pt was weaned off of BiPAP
and nitro gtt, restarted on home BP meds.  On [**1-23**] had 1.7L taken
off at HD and was neg 4L before going to floor.  Pt with
adequate O2 sats on room air after HD on the floor and was
discharged with O2 sats around 99% on RA. She will continue on
inhalers for symptoms control at home. In order to control the
tachycardia that may have been playing a role in worsening her
diastolic CHF and symptoms she was switched to 80mg of verapamil
Q6H. To prevent hypotension her toprol was also decreased to 100
from 150mg. She was also set up to get HD an extra hour on the
weekend to prevent fluid overload on the weekends. In addition
she will take isosorbide mononitrate on Sundays to help with her
symptom control.

# Positive U/A: h/o Klebsiella UTI sensitive to CTX so was
started on CTX, received 2 doses, and then was discharged on
cefpodoxime PO. Her PCP will attempt to obtain another urine
sample to insure clearance after her 7 day course of abx.

# ESRD: Emergent HD on [**1-23**] with 1.7L fluid taken off improved
SOB. She was then continued on M/W/F HD and will have an extra
hour of HD on the weekend as above.

# PAF: Had brief episode of atrial flutter at HD with transient
hypotension to 80s, quickly returned to 120s and returned to
sinus after HD. Coumadin, beta-blocker, and amiodarone were
continued.

# DM2: Home insulin 4 NPH [**Hospital1 **] with Humalog sliding scale.

# Sub-therapeutic INR: She was restarted on coumadin at home
dosing and will be followed up by [**Hospital 191**] [**Hospital 2786**] clinic to
ensure she gets back to goal INR [**1-24**] for her afib. It was felt
that she was low enough risk to not need a heparin bridge. Given
that she will be taking antibiotics it was felt that she should
not have a bolus of coumadin and instead was continued on just
her normal dose of coumadin.
