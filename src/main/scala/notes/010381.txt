Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4052**]
Chief Complaint:
cough and malaise

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. None


History of Present Illness:
87M with recent admission for PNA here with increasing
productive cough. Pt was admitted [**Date range (1) 50681**] with a RML
pneumonia. Pt was treated with 7-day course of levofloxacin. Pt
reported that he felt better when he went home, but 2-3 days
later, felt increasing fatigue and increasing cough productive
of yellow and then green-yellow sputum. Pt states he is sore
from coughing but denies CP. Denies frank SOB. Denies n/v/abd
pain, no fevers/chills at home. Does not use O2 at baseline. Pt
denies any blood in sputum. Denies any difficulty eating or
swallowing at home.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was noted to be tachypneic but satting well on
3-4L NC. As pt was subtherapuetic on coumadin, he was sent for
CT angio to r/o PE. When he returned from CT scanner, was
tachypneic to 40s, hypoxic to 90s on NRB, BP in 240s. Was
transiently placed on a NTG gtt, and BP dropped into 170s. Chest
CT showed multifocal PNA. Initial ABG 7.29/57/173 on NRB,
lactate 1.5. In the [**Name (NI) **], pt rec'd NS x2L, ceftazidime 2g IVx1,
vancomycin 1g IVx1, albuterol nebs x2, robitussin with codeine,
tylenol 1g, NTG gtt.
.
In the MICU, he was treated with vancomycin, azithromycin, and
zosyn for pneumonia refractory to levofloxacin. His O2
requirement was weaned down. However, on hospital day 2, he
developed hypertension with acute shortness of breath; this was
treated with a NTG gtt. Isosorbide DN was added to his BP
regimen replace the NTG.
.
Because of his dyspnea and tight, wheezy lung exam, he was
started on steroids for COPD exacerbation, although he does not
carry a history of COPD. A short course followed by short taper
was planned to treat the COPD. He was then able to wean down
from a face mask to nasal cannula.

Past Medical History:

.
CXR [**2185-2-10**]: Multifocal pulmonary opacities in the right mid and
both lower lung regions show interval improvement with residual
confluent opacity most prominent in the right middle lobe.
Vascular engorgement and perihilar haziness have also improved.
IMPRESSION: Improving multifocal pneumonia and likely resolving
superimposed
interstitial edema.
.
TTE [**2185-2-10**]: Normal EF, No valvular disease
.
CXR [**2185-2-9**]: 1.Improving right middle lobe airspace opacity
likely representing resolving pneumonia. 2. 7-mm right lower
lobe nodular opacity seen on a single view. Further
characterization of this finding with repeat PA and lateral
chest radiographs is recommended following resolution of the
right middle lobe consolidation.
.
CT angio [**2185-2-9**]: Multifocal PNA, cannot see PE but limited exam
(patient movement)

Negative for Influenza A and B


Brief Hospital Course:
87M with recent PNA on levofloxacin, now with worsening
multifocal pneumonia. had episode of respiratory difficulty
overnight requiring numerous interventions including lasix
(although CXR afterwards showed no signs of CHF), albuterol
nebs, nitro for afterload reduction, and finally BiPAP
.
# Respiratory distress/Multifocal pneumonia - Patient readmitted
for multifocal PNA that did not respond to levofloxacin as an
outpatient. It was thought that the patient either did not
receive long enough treatment with Levofloxacin or possibly that
the patient's pneumonia was resistant to Levofloxacin.
Alternatively, it was considered that the patient could have a
secondary infection superimposed on his prior pneumonia.  The
patient was started on Zosyn/Vanco to cover broadly given
progression of symptoms and radiographic appearance of PNA as
well as Azithromycin to cover atypicals.  He was admitted to the
MICU given his oxygen requirement and respiratory distress.  In
the MICU, the patient had two episodes of tachypnea to the 40s.
The first episode of sudden tachypnea and increased O2
requirement was thought to be [**2-25**] mucous plugging.  The patient
had a second episode of respiratory distress with RR 40s and was
given bipap with improvement of rr 20-30.  The patient did not
require intubation in the MICU.  The patient was started on IV
solumedrol for wheezing thought to be consistent with
COPD/reactive airways disease.  A TTE perfomed showed no
evidence of valvular disease with EF > 55%.  His CTA showed
multifocal pneumonia but no evidence of PE (although it was
somewhat limited study due to patient motion).  He did not
require endotracheal intubation.  His pneumonia and respiratory
status began to improve on the Vanc/Zosyn.  Additionally, the
patient was found to have significant wheezing on exam thought
to be consistent with a component of COPD/reactive airways
disease.  Although the patient does not have known COPD, he was
started on IV steroids for presumed reactive airways disease
contributing to his severe respiratory distress.  He was started
on Solumedrol IV and then subsequently switched to Prednisone.
He also received nebulizer treatments and his wheezing has
improved during his hospital course.  He will complete IV
antibiotics and a Prednisone taper after discharge at the [**Hospital 100**]
rehab MACU.  Upon discharge, he was requiring 2-3L Nasal cannula
to maintain saturation of 96%.  On room air, the patient's
oxygen saturation was 90%.
.
# Hypertension - Patient's hypertension to SBPs 240s in the ED
were thought to be likely from catecholamine surge in the
setting of possible early sepsis.  He was transiently put on a
nitro gtt which improved his SBPs to 160s-170s and was
transitioned to isosorbide DN and metoprolol after it was clear
that he was no longer septic.   His antihypertensive regimen can
be further uptitrated as necessary in the outpatient setting.
.
# Anemia: Patient found to have new anemia with Hct 30-32.
Stool guiacs x 2 were negative.  Hemolysis labs were sent with
no evidence of hemolysis.
.
# Bladder Ca - Patient was found to have recurrent bladder
cancer on a recent cystoscopy.  He is s/p transurethral
resection [**12-29**].  There are no acute issues at this time.  His
UA was noted to have many RBCs which is not seen in prior UAs
but pt has known bladder Ca.  The patient will need further
followup as an outpatient with his urologic oncologist.
Currently no acute issues at this time. UA was noted to have
many RBCs which is not seen in prior UAs but
.
# CKD - No acute issues. Renally dose meds.  The patient's
baseline Cr ranges between 1.3-1.6.
.
# h/o DVT - The patient's coumadin was stopped in the ICU in the
event a procedure was necessary and he was bridged with a
heparin gtt.  Upon discharge, his INR was 2.2 and heparin gtt
was no longer needed.  Goal INR 2.0-3.0
.
# FEN/GI - heart healthy diet

# PPx - tolerating po
