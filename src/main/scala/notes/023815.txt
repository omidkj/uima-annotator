Allergies:

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1936**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension, respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
71 year old male with MMP including severe OSA, recent [**First Name3 (LF) **]
[**Date range (1) 79292**] for large R MCA stroke with residual weakness, L
hemineglect, bulbar dysfunction (dysphagia s/p PEG, slurred
speech), bilateral PEs on coumadin, was readmitted from [**Hospital1 15454**] Hosp rehab to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital on [**7-1**] with
lethargy, depressed MS, fevers. Was febrile and hypotensive and
intubated for lethargy/airway protection. subsequently
transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU.  He was found to have septic shock [**1-4**]
either central line (had old R subclavian central line since
[**6-17**]) vs PNA. Got IVF reccussitation, short term pressor
support. He has been on Vanc, cefepime, and flagyl, and has
shown clinical improvement. Also as part of AMS w/u on
[**Month/Year (2) **], he got CT head, which showed small area of
hemmorhagic conversion. Given concern for expansion, his
coumadin was stopped (INR reversed) and he underwent IVC filter
since LE dopplers showed RLE DVT. The question now is whether
the coumadin is safe to be resumed, and it is for this question
that the patient transfered to medicine [**7-5**].

Neurology evaluated the patient and felt right MCA bleed does
not explain decline in mental status, which is likely [**1-4**]
infection/sepsis.

IMPRESSION:
Persistent bibasilar atelectasis. Pneumonia is not excluded.
.
CXR [**7-6**] In comparison with study of [**7-4**], the right hemidiaphragm
is now sharply seen. However, the left hemidiaphragm is
indistinct, suggesting underlying effusion, atelectasis, or even
pneumonia. Streak of atelectasis is seen in the lingular region.
Upper lobes are clear and the left subclavian catheter extends
to the mid portion of the SVC.

CT HEAD [**2116-7-1**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Large right middle cerebral artery territory infarct, with
hemorrhagic transformation. There is no herniation or shift of
normally midline structures or herniation.
2. Fluid within the right mastoid sinus and posterior
nasopharynx, likely related to intubation.
3. Bony defect and irregular ossific density within the right
frontal sinus. This may relate to prior surgery, or may be an
osteoma. Please correlate with patient's surgical history.
.
CT head [**7-2**]:
IMPRESSION: Evolution of the infarct in the right frontotemporal
region, with
increased hyperdensity in the gyriform pattern, and new small
area of
hemorrhage within the infract.

Brief Hospital Course:
71y/o male with severe OSA, recent large R MCA CVA with residual
deficits, s/p PEG, prolonged hospital course [**1-4**] aspiration
pneumonitis requiring intubation, VAP s/p zosyn, bilateral PEs
on coumadin, discharged [**6-26**], now admitted to [**7-1**] with
depressed MS, fevers, septic shock, unclear source (line sepsis
or PNA). Also noted to have newly noted hemorrhagic 1.1cm focus
in prior CVA territory (right temporal lobe), now off coumadin.
Found to have RLE DVT, s/p IVC filter [**7-2**]. Transfered to Gen
Med [**7-5**] for further management. Did very well on Gen med. Resp
status improved greatly with resuming BiPaP. See below for
details of Gen Med events.

Anemia, normocytic. hgb was 14 [**6-6**], then [**8-12**] on discharge [**6-26**],
this [**Month/Year (2) **] has been [**6-9**]. Got 1U prbc on [**7-4**], now hgb stable
around 9. Unable to perform endoscopy given high risk procedure
in this patient per anesthisiology.
-plan to monitor hgb qweek while on ASA and heparin SC. IF HGB
is trending down on this, then he will need reevaluation for
endoscopy under general anesthesia.
-cont PPI PO bid indefinately while on ASA/heparin SC
- cont Fe supp. B12/folate wnl.

.
Septic shock, resolved with fluids/pressors/abx: Unclear source
(?line sepsis vs aspiration pneumonitis/PNA (RLL on CXR). All
blood/urine cultures, including RIJ tip NTD. CXR with poss RLL
infiltrate (vs Atx), which has now resolved. Regardless, has
been afebrile, MS much improved, resp status much improved.
-cont on Vanc, cefepime, and flagyl for broad coverage, day [**7-12**]
today. Has RUE PICC, which needs to be removed after on [**7-13**].
-tylenol for fevers, CIS
.
.
Respiratory failure: Multifactorial [**1-4**] possible aspiration
pneumonitis, severe OSA, depressed MS, bilateral PEs. Intubated
on [**7-1**], extubated [**7-2**]. His pulm symptoms have greatly
improved, less secretions. Able to wean down to 2L nc.
-cont Abx as above
-cont O2 to keep sats around 93%, frequent suctioning by NS when
unable to swallow/clear secretions, chest PT
-also cont albuterol/mucomyst nebs for cough/thick sputum.
-cont BiPAP for severe OSA
-NO oral intake when depressed MS, aspiration precautions,
continue speech therapy
