RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2165-11-21**] 12:11 PM

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST

Reason: S/P MVC
Field of view: 36 Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
29 year old woman s/p mvc
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
trauma
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Motor vehicle trauma with abdominal pain.

COMPARISON: None.

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images through the chest, abdomen
and pelvis were obtained following the administration of
intravenous contrast. Multiplanar reformatted images were
obtained. Additionally, 25 minute delayed images of the abdomen
and pelvis were obtained.

CHEST WITH CONTRAST: There is no axillary, hilar, or mediastinal
lymphadenopathy. There is no evidence of mediastinal hematoma to
suggest injury to the great vessels. There is no pleural or
pericardial effusion. Small patches of atelectasis and/or
contusion are noted within the right middle and lower lobes on
the right.

ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: Numerable linear fracture lines are
present within the liver, but there is no CT evidence of active
extravasation within the liver. The spleen, pancreas, adrenal
glands and right kidney are within normal limits. The left
kidney is atrophic, with what appears to be long standing
proximal hydronephrosis, perhaps from a chronic UPJ obstruction.
There is a moderate amount of hematoma in the region of the
porta hepatis, as well as inferior to the spleen and also
lateral to the stomach. There is fluid at the root of the
mesentery. No free air is evident. The bowel is not well
assessed without oral contrast material.

PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: There is a Foley catheter within the
bladder. There is a moderate amount of fluid within the pelvis,
and a curvilinear focus of extravascular contrast material is
noted on the left. The appearance is concerning for active
extravasation of intravenous contrast. For this reason, delayed
images were subsequently obtained, and these images demonstrated
slight increase in the size of the abnormality as well as
diffusion of the high density material, which would be
consistent with vascular injury. There is no inguinal or deep
pelvic lymphadenopathy.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions are
seen. There is no sign of fracture.

Multiplanar reformatted images redemonstrate the above findings.

IMPRESSION:
1. Findings concerning for active extravasation in the left
pelvis originating from the left ovarian artery/vein.
2. Multiple liver fractures. At this time, there is no sign of
active hepatic bleeding.
3. Small lung contusions/atelectasis.
4. Fluid at the root of the mesentery. Although this could be
related to the free fluid elsewhere, a bowel injury is also
possible.
5. Chronic proximal left hydronephrosis with cortical thinning.

WRIST(3 + VIEWS) BILAT  [**2165-11-21**] 12:56 PM

SHOULDER (AP, NEUTRAL & AXILLA; WRIST(3 + VIEWS) BILAT

Reason: trauma

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
29 year old woman s/p trauma
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
trauma
CLINICAL HISTORY: Motor vehicle [**Last Name (un) 8886**].

TECHNIQUE: Right shoulder, two views; right and left wrist, two
views each.

RIGHT SHOULDER: There is no evidence of fracture, dislocation,
or bone destruction. Soft tissues are unremarkable.

BILATERAL WRISTS: There is an oblique fracture of the distal
ulna with slight dorsal angulation of the fracture fragment. No
other fractures are identified.

IMPRESSION:
Oblique distal left ulnar fracture. A dedicated radiograph of
the proximal radius is recommended to exclude an associated
injury.


Brief Hospital Course:
