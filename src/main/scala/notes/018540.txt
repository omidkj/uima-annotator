Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2143-10-30**] Mr. [**Known lastname 28331**] was taken emergently to the operating
room, where he underwent bilateral lower extremity fasciotomies
and axillo-bifemoral bypass.  He was observed for a short while
to see how he would do with revascularization; however, the
appearance of the right leg did not improve, so he was taken
back to the operating room and an above-knee amputation of the
right lower extremity was performed to remove all infarcted
tissue.  See operative reports dictated [**2143-10-30**] for further
details of the procedures.

Postoperatively Mr. [**Known lastname 28331**] was kept intubated and transferred
to the ICU.  He was started on Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin, and
Flagyl.  He had several repeated episodes of vtach accompanied
by hypotension requiring electrical cardioversion and lidocaine
drip.  An echocardiogram was done and showed an EF of only 10%
with significant LV dysfunction.  The lidocaine drip was
gradually weaned off, and he was transitioned to PO amiodarone.
Tube feeds were started on POD 4.

On [**2143-11-5**] Mr. [**Known lastname 28331**] was taken back to the OR for closure of
his above knee amputation.  He went back to the ICU, and was
successfully extubated on POD [**7-14**].  Psychiatry consult was
called to evaluate the patient for his history of anxiety and
depression.

On POD [**10-17**] he was transferred to the VICU.  Upon arriving there
he experienced some episodes of hematuria.  Urology consult was
called and instituted constant bladder irrigation, after which
his urine cleared.  Antibiotics were D/C'd and physical therapy
was initiated.  His left lower extremity faciotomy wounds
required several interrupted horizontal mattress sutures to
reclose them, but otherwise his wounds continued to heal well.
By [**2143-11-27**], he was strong enough to transfer independently from
bed to chair, so was discharged back to his halfway house in New
[**Location (un) **].
