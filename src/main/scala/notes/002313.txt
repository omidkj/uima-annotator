History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 81 year old male with a history of CAD status
post CABG times x4 and ICD, atrial fibrillation on coumadin,
hypertension, diabetes type I, and CHF who presented to [**Hospital **]
Hospital on [**6-19**] as the patient noticed that his ICD had fired x
2 in the past 24 hours. At the OSH, the patient was noted to
have a Hct of 30 with BUN/Cr of 100/2.2. His baseline Hct is 38.
He then reported that he had noticed 3 days of black, tarry
loose stool. He has never had gastrointestinal bleeding nor has
he had a prior colonoscopy. He denied any bright red blood per
rectum, hematemesis, nausea or vomiting.

He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] as he receives cardiac care
here. In the ED, he was found to have a Hct of 32.4 with a
positive NG lavage that did not clear (by report) and an INR of
2.2. His Cr was 2.1 (baseline 1.1-1.5), WBC of 13 with 78% PMNs.
His HR was 116, SBP 134/57 after 250 cc IVF at the OSH. He was
reported as being 88/51 en route to [**Hospital1 18**].

In the ED, the patient received 4 units FFP, 2 units PRBC with
40 IV lasix between units, 10 mg SC Vitamin K and 40 mg IV
protonix. GI and EP evaluated the patient in the ED. EP
increased his set rate for his ICD to 150-160 bpm and felt his
ICD was otherwise working well but was set off from his rapid
afib with widened QRS. GI planned for EGD when INR reversed.

Past Medical History:
1. DMI, for 30 years c/b neuropathy
2. CAD: s/p Cath ([**2128**]) with clean coronary arteries, ETT
Persantine study ([**12-21**]) with fixed, and Cath ([**2-22**]) with distal

80%, proximal circ 80%,
OM1 70% and wedge of 17 s/p 4v-CABG ([**2-22**]) with LIMA to LAD,
vein graft to PDA, vein graft to OM1 and radial artery to diag
3. CHF, EF 30% s/p ICD for primary prevention of sudden cardiac
death (did not place [**Hospital1 **]-v ICD because QRS duration was under 120
msec)
4. Chronic AF, asymptomatic, ICD interrogated by [**Doctor Last Name **] [**3-25**]
and showed an isolated episode of atrial fibrillation with a
rapid ventricular response in his ventricular tachycardia zone
5. Right ICA stenosis > 70%, asymptomatic
6. HTN
7. s/p removal of malignant bladder tumor
8. Gout
9. Varicose veins
10. CABG complicated by mediastinitis treated with antibiotics.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 81 year old male with a history of CAD s/p
CABG, ICD with afib on coumadin, and DMII who presented with
melenotic stools and a 8 point Hct drop from baseline with rapid
afib.

1. UGIB; received a total of 3 Units of PRBC's. Hct now stable.
- The patient underwent an EGD on [**6-19**] that showed a gastric
ulcer in the proximal body of the stomach that proved to be the
source of his UGIB. In addition, there was a visible clot in the
distal esophagus. There were ulcers in the stomach but not the
duodenum. The crater in the proximal stomach was injected with
epinephrine and cauterized. GI suggests that if Hct remains
stable, he return for another EGD in [**6-28**] weeks to re-evaluate
healing of the current gastric ulcers and question the utility
of a biopsy to assess for possible malignancy.
- He was found to have H. pylori and started on a 2 week course
of therapy with protonix, clarithromycin, and azithromycin.
- He was initially kept NPO, however his diet was advanced as
tolerated once hct was stable.

2. Afib s/p ICD
- The patient was taking coumadin 5 mg as an outpatient with a
goal INR [**2-23**]. On admission he was given Vitamin K 10 mg SQ x 1
and FFP for reversal of an initial INR of 2.2.  His coumadin was
held during his stay however was restarted at discharge.
- He was discharged on Toprol XL 150 mg for rate control
- His digoxin was continued
- The patient had a St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] ICD placed for primary prevention
of sudden cardiac death given his ischemic cardiomyopathy. His
ICD has been evaluated by EP on [**6-19**] and felt to be working
effectively. It was most likely triggered by the rapid
ventricular rate in the setting of afib with a baseline LBBB.

3. DMI. His oral meds were initially held while he was NPO. He
was covered with a SSI while he is hospitalized  His glyburide 6
mg and Metformin 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] were restared prior to discharge.

4. HTN
- The patient takes Toprol XL 150 mg and Zestril 40 mg at home.
His BP remained stable throughout his stay and his oupatient
anti-HTN medications were restarted.

5. CHF, EF 30%
- He was given maintenance fluids while kept NPO with lasix
between blood transufions.  He was discharged home on Lasix 40
mg [**Hospital1 **].

6. Acute on chronic renal failure (baseline Cr 1.3-1.5). Cr
improved to 1.5 from 2.1 with IV hydration.
- Most likely pre-renal in nature in the setting of loose stools
with melena in the past few days.

7. CAD
- Discharged home on Bblocker and ACE. His ASA was held given GI
bleed.
- lipid profile WNL, pt does not need statin (LDL 45).

8. CODE: DNR but agrees to resuscitation including CPR and
defibrillation (he has an ICD in place). We discussed how this
is difficult to respect as protecting one's airway and
protecting their heart in an emergency are both necessary for
complete CPR but he reiterated his desire not to be intubated
but agrees to resuscitation.
