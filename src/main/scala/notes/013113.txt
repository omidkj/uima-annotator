Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2817**]
Chief Complaint:
Diarrhea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Colonoscopy w/ biopsy

History of Present Illness:
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 916**] is a 62-year-old woman with a history of
myelodysplasia, DVT, cellulitis, GVHD (diarrhea)presents with
worsening diarrhea.  She was admitted on [**2131-1-11**] for allogenic
stem cell transplant per protocol DF05-279 and her conditioning
regimen consisted of photophoresis, pentostatin, and TBI.  She
is now day 215 after transplant.  [**Doctor First Name **] did very well in her
early posttransplant period; however, just after day 100, was
admitted with grade 3 GVHD of her GI tract.  She had large
amounts of diarrhea.  She has had two admissions for management
of this, C.diff negative.
  Per the pt, she has [**3-4**] semi-formed, soft bowel movements per
day, non-bloody, no mucus, with mild cramping prior but
otherwise no abd pain. Pt denies any change or worsening of
diarrhea in the past several weeks. However, the pt's Hem/Onc
attending was concerned about worsening diarrhea as she had [**3-4**]
bowel movements in one hour at clinic. They report 10+ bowel
movements daily.

Past Medical History:
Hematologic Hx:
Severe MDS diagnosed in [**2130**].
Cytogenetics-->Initial bone marrow showed deletion 7 associated
with a poor prognosis. However, repeat cytogenetics performed on
[**2130-12-28**] at [**Hospital1 18**] show no such deletion.
Flow--> CD34-positive blasts are estimated at 5-6%
Biopsy/Aspirate-->From [**2130-12-28**]: The blast count on the aspirate
is 6%, and by CD34-immunostains is 6-10%, consistent with a
diagnosis of refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB-1) by
WHO criteria. While the cellularity was difficult to estimate
due to the aspiration artifact, the overall cellularity appears
decreased, which may be consistent with an hypoplastic
myelodysplastic syndrome.
.
Had sibling reduced-intensity Allogeneic Transplant [**2131-1-17**]
that she tolerated well with minimal transfusion requirements.
Bone marrow on [**4-27**] showed it was mildly hypocellular. There
were minimal dysplastic changes but of uncertain significance.
The patient's chimerism showed 99% donor.
.
Patient recently admitted to hospital (discharged on [**2131-6-10**])
with severe diarrhea from GVHD.  Colonoscopy consistent with
GVHD.  Diarrhea improved with increased immunosuppresents

cancer, and another maternal aunt with uterine cancer. She has
two children who are alive and well.

8/340 ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF
70-80%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are myxomatous. The mitral
valve leaflets are elongated. There is moderate/severe mitral
valve prolapse. An  eccentric, posterolaterally directed jet of
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation  is seen. The timing of the
mitral regurgitation is late systolic. The  estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no  pericardial
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
62 year old female w/ allo SCT +>200 days, hx recent CMV
infection and GVHD diarrhea admitted for worsening diarrhea.
.
Cellulitis: Patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for worsening
left thigh cellulitis.  Concern for cellulitis vs. necrotising
fascitis.  The patient had a prior history of pseudomonal
cellulitis on her left leg.  On hospital day 6 she was developed
fevers to 101.8, rigors and became hypotensive to 70/40 which
did not respond to fluid boluses.  Her left leg was noted to
look markedly cellulitis with erythema and tendernss.  She was
placed on cefepime, flagyl and tobramycin given previous
pseudomonal sensitivities. She was transferred to the intensive
care unit where she was placed on pressors.  The patient was
seen by sugery and the ID consult service.  There was concern
that her leg infection might represent necrotising fasciitis.
CT scan of the left leg revealed extensive muscle edema but no
clear evidence of necrotising fasciitis but it was uncle
