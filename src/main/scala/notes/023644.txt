History of Present Illness:
65 year old gentleman with HIV on HARRT (CD4 392 and neg VR in
[**2126-6-9**]), hep C, CHF (EF50%) DM and ESRD on HD brought in from
[**Hospital3 105**] with actinobacter growing in his blood. He has
a history of line infections from his left groin HD line and was
recently discharged on [**2127-1-8**] after a course of vanc. At
[**Hospital3 105**], it is unclear why the blood culture was drawn
in the first place and there is no paperwork accompanying the
patient. The call-in to the ED reports that the actinobacter was
sensitive to bactrim and unasyn. One dose of Unasyn was given
and he was then transferred to the ED.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were: 97.1, 67, 114/60, 17, 100%RA. He
remained afebrile and he blood pressure and heart rate remained
about the same durin ghis ED course. Unasyn was given. Initial
lactate was 3.4 and it came down to 1.4 with 1L NS. His abd was
noted to be distended and he admitted to some intermittent
abdominal pain. CT abd was done that showed dilated small bowels
suggestive of SBO. Surgery was called and felt like there is no
need for surgery this point. NGT was offered but the patient
adamantly refused. Pt reportedly was passing gas. He was then
admitted to medicine for further care.
.
On arrival to the floor, he denied fevers, chills, chest pain,
shortness of breath, abd pain, n/v/d. He reported that he has
been passing gas. He refused an NGT. On routine vitals, he was
noted to be unresponsive to sternal rub. No blood pressure was
able to be obtained so a code blue was called. He was given an
amp of epi for PEA and CPR was started but he pushed people off
of him. He was started on levophed and a L arterial line was
placed. He was transferred to the ICU for further management.
.
On arrival to the ICU he was still somnolent and not following
commands and not able to answer questions. He was intubated for
airway protection. His R tunnelled HD cath was accessed as he
only had a L PICC. He was listed as DNR/DNI on prior d/c summary
but his HCP wishes him to be full code at this point.

Physical Exam:
65 year old man with HIV on HARRT (CD4 392 and neg VR in [**Month (only) **]
[**2126**]), hep C, CHF (EF50%) DM and ESRD on HD brought in from
[**Hospital3 105**] with positive blood cultures of actinobacter
.
# Septic Shock:  The patient was initially admitted to the
floor, however became acutely hypotensive overnight the night of
admission.  He was then transferred to the MICU.  He was started
on pressors, ultimately requiring triple pressor therapy to
maintain adequate MAPs.  The etiology of the hypotension, was
likely septic shock from Actinobacter bacteremia for which he
was sent from [**Hospital1 **].  The patient did not have subsequent
positive blood cultures.  The patient was started on unasyn and
tobramycin to cover acinetobacter and added vancomycin to cover
recent MRSA as recent staph sensitive to vancomycin (previous
cultures were VISA).
- based on sensitivities, will change antibiotics to unasyn and
tobramycin to cover acinetobacter and add Vanc to cover MRSA
(recent staph cx sensitive to Vanc)
-- surveillance blood cultures
-- Contact IR to replace fem dialysis line and to place an
additional triple lumen cath (difficult access)
- will check MVO2 as no JVP assessment to guide recussitation
.
# Respiratory failure: His O2 sats were difficult to obtain on
the floor. He had very altered mental status so was intubated
for airway protection. No obvious infiltrates on CXR.
-- hold pscyhotropic drugs: gabapentin and narcotics. Continued
celexa to avoid rebound.
.
# Cdiff: During last hospitalization, he was found to have +
cdiff stool culture on [**1-6**] and was discharged on Flagyl. Given
clinical picture of infection with high leukocytosis, will
continue Flagyl for now even though he has no stool.
-- continue Flagyl given broad-spectrum antibiotics
-- surveillance Cdiff cultures
.
# ?SBO: Surgery following. He was passing flatus prior to the
code.
-- surgery following
-- OGT/NPO
-- monitor for flatus and BM
.
# History of graft thrombosis: Multiple clots in grafts and IVC

in past. INR 3.1. Goal INR [**2-11**]. [**Month (only) 116**] need FFP for line change.
- T&S
- heparin ggt if INR < 2
.
# HIV: Last VL was undetectable in [**6-16**]. Continue outpatient
HAART regimen.
- Stavudine 20 mg PO Q24H, RiTONAvir 100 mg PO BID, Indinavir
Sulfate 800 mg PO BID, LaMIVudine 150 mg PO Q TUES AND THURS
.
# HCV: no recent VL but last VL in 07 was 4,290 IU/mL. Unclear
synthetic fx of liver although recent albumin in [**Month (only) **] was 2.5.
INR 3.1 which is presumably from anticoagulation. MRI of abdomen
showed hemosiderosis of liver.
.
# Chronic systolic heart failure: EF 35-40% which is global and
likely from either etoh or cocaine. Currently hypotensive but
this is likely from septic shock but not CHF. PO2 low even on
1.0 FIO2 so will not give additional fluids.
.
# Anemia: Macrocytic so possibly from liver disease vs HAART.
Appeared to iron-deficient in [**Month (only) 1096**]. Also ESRD on HD so
likley this is a contributor. HCT higher than on discharge on
[**1-8**].
- trend for now
- check b12/folate
- guaic stools
.
# DM: sliding scale insulin
.
# HTN: nifedipine and metoprolol
.
# ESRD: on HD
-- appreciate renal following, will need a new HD line for CVVH

.
# L3 compression deformity: chronic
.
# FEN: NPO
# PPX: PPI and anticoagulated
# CODE: confirmed full w/ HCP fiance-[**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 95042**] but his
brothers-[**Telephone/Fax (1) 95043**] and fiance will talk today about overall
goals of care given that he had recently requested DNR/DNI
status at last admission.
# DISPO: ICU for now


Pertinent Results:
CT Abd/Pelvis:  IMPRESSION:
1. Markedly dilated loops of small bowel, with the greatest
degree of
distention seen proximally, and within the stomach. Patient
would likely
benefit from nasogastric tube decompression. However, overall
