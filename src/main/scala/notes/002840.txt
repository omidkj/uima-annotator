C.CATH [**11-28**]:
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Aortic arch angiography showed type 2 arch with moderate
calcification.
2. No significant disease in the right and left common carotids
or
subclavian arteries.
3. Right carotid angiography showed 90% ulcerated and eccentric
stenosis
in the proximal right internal carotid artery sparing the
ostium. Kink
in the vessel distal to the stenosis. Rest of the [**Country **] is widely
patent
supplying both ACA and MCA.
4. Left CCA and ICA are widely patent.
5. The aforementioned 90% [**Country **] stenosis was successfully treated
with
PTA and stenting with a 8.0 x 30 mm Xact stent. The procedure
was
performed using distal protection ([**Doctor Last Name 4726**] embolic protection
device).
.
Complete Carotid Series [**11-28**]:
IMPRESSION: There is no evidence of significant carotid artery
stenosis
bilaterally.

Brief Hospital Course:
76yo PMHx CAD, HTN, HLD, recently found to have critical [**Country **]
stenosis now s/p [**Country **] today without complication, admitted for
post-procedure monitoring.
.
ACTIVE DIAGNOSES:
.
#Right Internal Carotid Artery Stent Placement: Mr. [**Known lastname 66096**]
presented with 80-90% stenosis of [**Country **], and underwent
catheterization with stenting without known complications. There
was, however, question of kinking of distal end of stent which
led the team to obtain a carotid duplex study which was normal.
He was started on a nitro drip to maintain his systolic
pressures in the 100-130 mmHg range but never actually required
the medication. He was found to be completely neurologically
intact with baseline poor vision related to his glaucoma and was
discharge on his home aspirin and plavix with follow-up
appointments arranged.
.
# Coronary Artery Disease: His home atenolol and isosorbide were
held given concerns for his blood pressure in the post-stent
period with follow-up established with his outpatient
cardiologist for re-initiation of those medications. He was
continued on his home ASA, Plavix, and ezetimibe-simvastatin. He
had CK-MB negative x 2 during this admission.
.
CHRONIC DIAGNOSES:
.
# COPD: Stable. He was continued on his albuterol nebs and home
advair.
.
# Glaucoma: Stable with very poor baseline vision. He was
continued on his home eye drops.
.
# Osteoporosis: Stable. Continued on his home calcitonin,
calcium, and vitamin D3.
.
# Chronic Pain: Stable. Continued on his home percocet.
.
# BPH: Stable. We attempted to hold his tamsulosin given concern
for hypotension but he had significant symptoms and robust blood
pressures so this medications was continued.
.
