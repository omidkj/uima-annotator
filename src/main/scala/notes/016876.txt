Chief Complaint:
Shortess of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
68 year-old female with a past medical history of NSCLC, p/w
malaise, SOB, fever, and cough for 7d to [**Hospital6 33**].
She was staying with her daughter who brought her to the [**Name (NI) **] at
[**Hospital3 **]. She reports coughing up greenish sputum for past
few days. No hemoptysis. Also reports some slight orthopnea, but
no weight gain or LE edema. She was recently treated for an
incidentally found UTI on [**2181-2-27**] with 3 days of cipro. She also
complains or worsened R hip pain. She walks with a walker but
this has been difficult due to her pain. She denies
numbness/weakness/incontinence/diarrhea/hematuria/abd
pain/nausea/vomiting/chest pain/rash.
.
At [**Hospital3 **] her HR was 150s in sinus tach, BP 110/70, RA sat
80s, her BNP was found to be 4,000 and her D-dimer was elevated
so there was concern for PE vs. CHF vs. PNA. She was given
ceftriaxone/azithro/20 mg IV lasix and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.

.
At [**Hospital1 **] ED her vitals were HR 120s, BP 120/70, sat mid 80s RA,
95% on NRB, CXR showed LLL infiltrate, CTA done which showed no
PE but revealed a probable LLL postobx PNA, lactate was 4.5. She
was given 2L IVF, ceftaz and vanco after additional BCx were
drawn, and a L subclavian CVL was placed. Her lactate
subsequently improved to 1.9.

Past Medical History:
1. NSCLC: s/p RM lobectomy [**9-/2172**], recently started
carboplatin/taxol, has been diagnosed with 3 lung cancers of
different histologic type, a BAC in the right middle lobe in
[**9-/2172**] that was T2; a T1N0 large cell carcinoma of the upper
lobe in [**4-/2177**], in [**4-/2178**] wedge resection of a poorly
differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with focal glandular
features, a T1Nx as this was by wedge resection and no nodes
were sampled.
2. Right hip surgery
3. appendectomy

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the report of the prior study (images
not
available) of [**2179-6-9**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thicknesses and cavity size.
Mildly depressed
LVEF. Trabeculated LV apex.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV not well seen. Abnormal septal
motion/position.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Normal ascending aorta
diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+) MR. LV
inflow pattern
c/w impaired relaxation.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.
Borderline PA
systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor apical views.


Conclusions:
Suboptimal images.The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic
function appears mildly depressed. The apex is not well
visualized, but there
appears to be global hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired
relaxation. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of
[**2179-6-9**], the LVEF is probably less. If clincally indicated, a
repeat study
with echo contrast (Definity) may better characterize
global/regional LV
systolic funciton.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS  [**2181-3-4**] 4:27 PM

CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS; CT 100CC NON IONIC CONTRAST

Reason: r/o PE. Eval for infiltrate - infection vs CHF

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
68 year old woman with metastatic ca, sats 80s RA, cough,
elevated lactate.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o PE. Eval for infiltrate - infection vs CHF
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: History of metastatic lung cancer with decreasing O2
sats, cough and elevated lactate. Evaluate for PE versus
infiltrate versus CHF.

COMPARISONS: Head CT of [**2181-1-25**], CT chest of [**2180-9-14**] and
chest x-ray of the same day.
TECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT imaging through the chest with 80 mL of
nonionic Optiray contrast per CTA PE protocol.

CTA CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The pulmonary arterial system
enhances normally without evidence of pulmonary embolism. The
thoracic aorta enhances normally throughout its visualized
course. The airway is patent to the major segmental level. There
is dense consolidation in the left lower lobe, new from the PET
CT of [**2181-1-25**], demonstrating diffuse air bronchograms, likely
representing postobstructive pneumonia rather thean lobar
atelectasis. Loculated fluid in the left major fissure. 7mm
spiculated nodule in the left upper lobe, seen on series 3,
image 45. There is diffuse interstitial thickening at the right
lung base, with multiple ill-defined, confluent nodular
opacities. There is no pneumothorax. There is no significant
pleural effusion. Again demonstrated are multiple enlarged lymph
nodes in the mediastinum in the subcarinal, pretracheal, and AP
window distribution. Bone windows demonstrate innumerable lytic
lesions throughout the osseous structures diffusely better
evaluated on the prior pet CT. Coronal and sagital reformatted
images confirm the above findings.

IMPRESSION:
1) No pulmonary embolism.
2) Dense left lower lobe consolidation with air bronchograms and
mild expansion and mass effect on the major fissure, likely
relating to post obstructive pneumonia.
3) Confluent ill-defined nodular opacities in the right lower
lobe, with surrounding ground-glass opacity and interstitial
thickening. The differential for these findings includes
pneumonia, progression of pulmonary metastatic disease, and
lymphangetic spread.
4) Diffuse extrapulmonary metastatic disease as described above.
