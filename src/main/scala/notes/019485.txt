[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4125**]ospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2126-9-29**] for elective
surgical management of his mitral valve regurgitation. He was
started on heparin as his INR was allowed to drift down for
surgery. On [**2126-10-1**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating
room where he underwent a mitral valve repair utilizing a 28mm
annuloplasty ring via a right thoracotomy. Postoperatively he
was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit for
monitoring. He underwent a bronchoscopy for secretions. On
postoperative day one, Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**] neurologically intact
and was extubated. Beta blockade and aspirin were started. He
developed rapid atrial fibrillation which converted to normal
sinus rhythm with amiodarone and lopressor. On postoperative day
two, he was transferred to the step down unit for further
recovery. He was gently diuresed towards his preoperative
weight. The physical therapy service was consulted for
assistance with his postoperative strength and mobility. He had
a mild bump in his creatinine which stabilized with holding his
lasix. The endocrinology service was consulted for assistance
with his diabetes medication management and acute hypoglycemia.
As his oral intake increased to normal, he had no further
episodes of hypoglycemia on glyburide. As Mr. [**Known lastname **] continued
to have paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, coumadin was started for
anticoagulation. Mr. [**Known lastname **] continued to make steady progress
and was discharged home on postoperative day seven. He will
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], his cardiologist and his primary
care physician as an outpatient.
