Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM

<br>Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Patient presented with
hypercarbic respiratory failure likely in the setting of not
using bipap for several days (home Bipap broken). He has hx of
obesity hypoventilation, pickwikian syndrome, COPD which may all
have contributed. COPD or CHF exacerbation or possible viral
illness could also have contributed to acute worsening of
chronic hypercarbia.  Overall goal was to prevent the need to
intubate him, as he had a difficult airway and would need
fiber-optic intubation.  Patient was put on BiPAP with AC and
encouraged to use this as much as possible.  His home BiPAP
settings were confirmed with his PCP ([**Company 33467**] 21/16).  His
oxygen goal was kept at 85-88% overall to prevent the [**Last Name (un) 12794**]
effect.  A-line was placed to monitor ABGs (patient was
chronically hypercarbic and hypoxic) and he was given nebulizers
PRN wheezing.  Possiblity of steroids was considered if
patient's wheezing worsened, but these were not started because
wheezing did not seem to change dramatically.  CXR was difficult
to read but was not suggestive of any infectious process and he
was not put on antibiotics. His ABGs normalized to his baseline
status w/ pCO2 less than 100 prior to discharge.

<br>HTN: Patient had a history of hypertension treated with
isosorbite mononitrate. This was d/c-ed at admission (to prevent
pulmonary vascular dilation and shunting) and his home
lisinopril (30mg QD) was increased to 30mg PO BID.  He was
diuresed with lasix 80mg IV BID as well as diamox because of his
persistently elevated bicarb level.  When he began to show signs
of dryness (bumping Cr from 1.0 to 1.5 and dry on physical
exam), lasix, diamox and lisinopril were temporarily held.  He
was restarted on lasix at his home dose (80mg PO BID) as well as
his lisinopril (30mg PO QD) on [**7-31**] after Creatinine came down
to 1.3, but lasix/lisinopril/diamox were again held on [**8-1**] when
his creatinine came back up to 1.5.  Creatinine was back at 1.1
on [**8-2**] and he was given Lasix 80mg PO X1 dose; his second dose
of lasix and his lisinopril were held again with plans to
restart on [**8-3**] if his creatinine had stabilized at 1.1 or
lower.
.
Acute Renal Failure: Patient's Cr bumped from 1.0 on [**7-29**] to 1.5
on [**7-30**] likely in the setting of aggressive diuresis.  He was
clinically dry at this point as well.  Lasix/diamox/lisinopril
were temporarily held on [**7-30**].  Repeat creatinine on [**7-31**] was
down to 1.3, and he was restarted on lasix and lisinopril.
However creatinine on [**8-1**] was back up to 1.5 and his
lasix/lisinopril were again held.  Creatinine was 1.1 on [**8-2**]
and he was given one lasix dose of 80mg PO; lisinopril was held.
 Discharge instrucitons are to continue lisinopril at 30mg PO
daily and lasix 80mg PO daily. Please continue to monitor renal
function.
