Service:  CARDIOTHOR

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75-year-old male
patient with a known heart murmur for many years with recent
increase in shortness of breath and fatigue over the past
twelve months.  Echocardiogram by the primary care physician
showed normal LV function  with aortic stenosis.  He had been
treated medically over the past year, but due to his recent
increase in symptoms, he was referred for surgery.  Cardiac
catheterization revealed left ventricular ejection fraction
of 60% LAD lesion and aortic valve area of 0.6 and a mean
aortic valve gradient of 56.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Known aortic stenosis as previously described.
2.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Diverticulosis.
5.  Status post colectomy.
6.  Status post cholecystectomy.
7.  Status post hernia repair.
8.  Status post craniotomy.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o.q.d.
2.  Atenolol 25 mg p.o.q.d.
3.  K-Dur 8 mEq p.o.q.d.

ALLERGIES:  The patient states no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination, preoperatively, is
unremarkable.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on the day of
surgery and taken to the operating room on [**2109-4-22**],
where he underwent an aortic valve replacement with a 21-mm
pericardial prosthetic valve by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].
Postoperatively, the patient was transported from the
operating room to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit later in
the day of surgery.  He was weaned from mechanical
ventilation and extubated successfully without any sequela
from that.  He was on nitroglycerin IV drip, as well as an
insulin IV drip, which were both weaned off by the following
morning.

On postoperative day #1, the patient remained hemodynamically
stable.  Chest tubes were removed, and he was transferred to
the Telemetry Floor.

On postoperative day #2, the patient began ambulation,
physical therapy and progressed to a level 3 to 4 cardiac
rehabilitation status on postoperative day #2.  He had
remained hemodynamically stable throughout his postoperative
course.  On postoperative day #2, the patient's epicardial
pacing wires were removed.  The patient had a questionable
episode of a scant amount of sternal drainage on
postoperative day #2, however, it was seen to be an isolated
event and he has had no further sternal drainage.  He was
placed on Vancomycin for this for approximately twenty-four
hours.

On postoperative day #3, [**2109-4-25**], the patient
remains hemodynamically stable and he is anxious to go home.
He has progressed to physical therapy level 5 ambulation and
he will be discharged home this evening on postoperative day
#3.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Temperature:  99.3; heart rate
90 normal sinus rhythm; blood pressure 122/66; oxygen
saturation 95% on two liters nasal cannula.  Coronary
examination revealed regular rate and rhythm.  Breath sounds
are clear and equal bilateral.  His wound is without any
drainage or erythema on the sternal incision.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lopressor 50 mg p.o.b.i.d.
2.  Captopril 6.25 mg p.o.t.i.d.
3.  Lasix 20 mg p.o.b.i.d. times 7 days.
4.  Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o.b.i.d. times 7 days.
5.  Colace 100 mg p.o.b.i.d.
6.  Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o.q.d.
7.  Percocet 5/325, one to two tablets p.o.q.4h. to 6h.
P.r.n.pain.
8.  Ibuprofen 400 mg p.o.q6h.p.r.n. pain.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Aortic stenosis status post aortic
valve replacement with a 21-mm pericardial valve.

FO[**Last Name (STitle) **]P CARE:  The patient is to followup with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) 411**] in approximately four weeks, as well as to followup
with his primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 22980**] in three to four
