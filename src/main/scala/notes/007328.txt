Admission Date:  [**2166-9-8**]       Discharge Date:  [**2166-10-2**]


Service:  MEDICAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 79-year-old, Greek
speaking only female who presented from home with weakness
for one week.  With her son as her interpreter, she reported
that she was seen by her primary care physician three days
prior to admission and was thought to be in congestive heart
improvement.  She was sent home on home oxygen.

Since that time, the patient continued to complain of
weakness to the point where she was even too weak to get up
to go to the bathroom.  Weakness was greater in the lower
extremities.  The patient denied any shortness of breath,
chest pain, palpitations, diaphoresis, abdominal pain, bright
complained of nonproductive cough and headaches.

When the symptoms persisted, EMTs were called.  In the field
vitals signs revealed a pulse of 68, blood pressure 140/88,
respirations 20 and labored, oxygen saturation 28%.  In the
Emergency Department, chest x-ray did not show evidence of
failure.  Further evaluation by chest CT showed right lower
lobe consolidation, left lower lobe atelectasis.  Initial ABG
on 100% non-rebreather mask was pH 7.14, pCO2 143, pO2 176.
She was started on noninvasive ventilation with clinical
improvement in her mentation.  She was transferred to the
MICU for noninvasive ventilation and further evaluation.

ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with her son.  There is no history
of alcohol or tobacco.  She has a history of secondary smoke
from her husband.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 98.9??????, heart
rate 80, blood pressure 111/60, respirations 18, oxygen

lymphadenopathy.  Heart:  Regular, rate and rhythm.  Normal
S1 and S2.  There was a 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur.
Lungs:  Crackles at both bases with decreased breath sounds
on the right.  Abdomen:  Soft and nontender.  Normoactive
bowel sounds.  Extremities:  Extensive varicose veins in the
lower extremities.  There was 1+ pedal edema bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 7.3, hematocrit 43, platelet
count 128,000, MCV 101; sodium 138, potassium 4.3, chloride
87, bicarbonate 39, BUN 36, creatinine 1.0, glucose 104,
troponin 0.6, CK 32, digoxin 1.0; PT 12.7, INR 1.1, PTT 26.5;
urinalysis showed 25 red blood cells, 122 white blood cells,
many bacteria, 2 epithelial cells; arterial blood gases in
the Emergency Department on 100% nonrebreather mask with a pH
of 7.14, pCO2 143, pO2 176.

Chest x-ray showed bibasilar atelectasis, tortuous aorta, no
evidence of congestive heart failure.  CT of the chest showed
consolidation of the right lower lobe, posterior atelectasis
of the left lung base, no pleural effusions, cardiomegaly,
status post aortic valve replacement.  There was a low
attenuation lesion in the thyroid, probably representing
cyst.

CT of the head showed no acute intracranial process.

Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm, left bundle
branch block with ST elevations in V1, V3, and in lead [**Last Name (LF) 1105**],
[**First Name3 (LF) **] depressions in leads I and AVL.  There was no prior study
available for comparison.  The patient also had an
echocardiogram on [**9-29**] which showed 55% left ejection
fraction, anterior septal hypokinesis, as well as severe 3+
tricuspid regurgitation, and 2+ pulmonary hypertension.
There was no pericardial effusion.  Right ventricular
systolic function was normal.  The ascending aorta was
moderately dilated, and a bioprosthetic aortic valve
prosthesis was present.

Her respiratory culture from the date of admission showed no
predominance of any respiratory pathogens. Her blood cultures
from the day of admission were negative.  Her urine culture from
the day of
admission grew out E. coli, over 100,000 colonies.  The E.
coli was pansensitive.

The patient had an EMG study done on [**9-22**] which was a
normal study with electrophysiologic findings most consistent
with a chronic, moderately severe, sensory motor neuropathy.  The
findings were not suggestive of a disorder of
neuromuscular transmission (as in myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**]) or a
generalized myopathy.

The patient also had a swallow study on [**9-29**] which
showed mild aspiration of liquids during the study.  The
patient has had multiple chest x-rays during her hospital
course which showed no evidence of congestive heart failure.
It also showed a fairly enlarged heart and large right
atrium.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 79-year-old woman admitted from
home on [**9-8**] with a history of recent progressive
weakness.  She was intubated in the Emergency Department for
respiratory failure.  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit and received a two-week course of
Levaquin to treat her right lower lobe pneumonia which has
resolved based on her clinical status, white count, and
absence of fevers.  Serial chest x-rays showed resolution of
the right lower lobe opacity and showed also some evidence of
congestive heart failure.

The patient was therefore diuresed for a fluid goal of -1
L/day during the portion of her stay in the MICU.  Despite
the treatment for pneumonia and congestive heart failure, the
patient demonstrated persistent failure to wean from
mechanical ventilation with decreased tidal volumes and
increase in respiratory rate with a decrease in pressure
support settings.  In addition, she was significantly
hypercapnic with a pACO2 in the 50s to 60s.  There was
sufficient concern that there might be an underlying
neuromuscular disorder explaining the patient's failure to
wean.  Therefore she had a Neurology consult.

At bedside, an EMG was performed which showed a chronic
nondemyelinating sensory motor neuropathy, although the
clinical correlation of these findings were not clear.

The patient's failure to wean has been attributed to muscular
deconditioning.  After repeated discussions, the family has
agreed to tracheostomy which was performed at bedside.

Of note, the patient has reported persistent abdominal pain
for about a week.  Physical exam detected a small reducible
ventral incisional hernia.  The family reported this has been
a chronic problem.  A Surgical consult was obtained here with
their recommendation that no intervention be performed at
this time unless there were signs and symptoms of
obstruction.

During her hospital stay, her infectious disease resolved.
Her hematocrit remained stable.  Her hernia issue remained
stable, and there were no issues with her renal function.
The patient has received tube feeds, and at the end of he
hospital stay, a PEG tube was placed by Interventional
Radiology secondary to the fact that the patient had an
unsatisfactory swallow study which demonstrated aspiration.

As per communication with the patient's son and daughters, SHE IS
FULL CODE.  The patient will be discharged on [**10-2**] to the
rehabilitation facility.  The patient is now in stable
condition.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Failure to wean.
