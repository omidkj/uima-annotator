Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal.  Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Transmitral Doppler and tissue
velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic
dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are  mildly thickened. Physiologic
mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There
is a small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic
signs of tamponade.  Also noted is a left pleural effusion.
.
* KUB: Note is made of nasogastric tube coursing down below the
left hemidiaphragm terminating in the left mid quadrant probably
in the stomach. The gastric gas is somewhat distended. There are
two loops of dilated small bowel measuring up to 4 cm in the
left lower quadrant. However, colon and rectal gas is
identified.
.
* Abd CT [**2103-1-21**]:
1. Dilated loops of small bowel with a transition point seen in
the right abdomen, with decompressed small bowel seen distal to
the transition point to the teminal ileum. Stool and gas seen
throughout the colon. Findings suggest early small bowel
obstruction.
2. Small left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis and
consolidation, concerning for left lower lobe pneumonia.
3. Low attenuation left adrenal nodule, incompletely
characterized on this non-contrast study.
4. Diverticulosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 87yoW with h/o DM and [**Hospital **] transferred from OSH with
Afib/RVR, UTI, Pneumonia, SBO and GI bleed.
.
#  Afib/RVR:  Per PCP patient had Afib on arrival to the OSH 5
days ago and has a h/o "arrhythmia." with no known CAD. Afib
likely occured in setting of acute infection and SBO with
dehydration.  Converted to NSR since transfer to MICU and
currently hemodynamically stable.  The patient was started on IV
metoprolol and then converted to po metoprolol after the NG tube
was removed.  Pt was initially started on aspirin but had to be
discontinued due to her GI bleed.
.
#  Pneumonia:  A Retrocardiac/LLL opacity on CXR. She received a
7 day course of levaquin.  The patient's oxygen saturation was
stable and the patient had no respiratory distress while in
house.

.
#  UTI: The patient had a postive UA. She was initially treated
with levaquin however cultures gew out E coli that was not
sensitive to that antibiotic.  The coverage was changed to
ceftriaxone and her elevated WBC count resolved.
.
#  SBO:  No prior abdominal surgeries.  By CT SBO appears in
distal ileum, ?Meckel's vs volvulus since the patient had not
had any previous abdominal surgeries making adhesions a
less-likely cause.  Surgery was consulted and involved in the
patients care.  An NG tube was placed in the emergency
department and copious amounts of brown fluid was removed.  The
NG tube was in place for 8 days.  Bowel sounds returned and the
pt began to pass flatus and have small bowel movements. The NG
tube was removed and the patient
