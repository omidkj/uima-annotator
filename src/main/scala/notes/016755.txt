CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Mesenteric ischemia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 74-year-old female who
presented to [**Hospital6 3105**] on [**2145-9-23**]
with complaints of weakness, weight loss, cough, fever,
chills, dyspnea and low back pain. She had an extensive
workup which is most pertinent for SMA and celiac stenosis
with a coral reef plaque, aortic stenosis with right renal
occlusion by MRI. Diagnostic studies during that
hospitalization included a VQ scan on [**9-24**] which was
negative but the d-dimer was positive. A transthoracic
echocardiogram on [**9-24**] showed an ejection fraction of
55% with mild diastolic dysfunction, no valvular disease, no
PFO. A TEE was done on [**9-29**] which showed normal left
and right ventricular function, no valvular disease, trace of
pericardial effusion, negative bubble study. A right pleural
effusion which was tapped on [**9-29**] was sterile
transudate. A temporal artery biopsy on [**10-4**] was
negative. A right renal cyst aspiration on [**10-6**].

On admission to our institution, the patient states she has
been having abdominal pain but this has subsided after she
got Visicol suppository and Lactulose. She states that until
today she has not had a bowel movement for one week. She
denies any nausea, emesis, bright red rectal bleeding,
melena. She denies fever, chills, dyspnea, chest pain at
present. She does acknowledge periprandial pain and weight
loss of 15 pounds over months.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Denies tobacco, wine with dinner every
night. She is retired for two years from working as a health
care administrative assistant.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs 98.6, 70, 20, O2 sat 95%
on room air. Blood pressure 118/52. General appearance: Thin
female sitting in bed in no acute distress. HEENT exam is
unremarkable. Trachea is midline. Neck is soft without
lymphadenopathy. Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm without
murmur, gallop or rub. Lungs are clear to auscultation
bilaterally. Abdominal exam is unremarkable except for some
mild voluntary guarding in the right lower quadrant. No
hernias, abdominal bruits noted. Peripheral vascular: She has
bilateral pedal edema, left greater than right. Feet are warm
without ulceration. Pulses are palpable femorals, popliteals,
DP and PT's bilaterally. Neurologic exam is appropriate,
nonfocal.

LABORATORY DATA:  Admitting labs were lactate 1.9, BUN 14,
creatinine 1.7, K 3.5, ALT, AST are normal. Amylase was 83,
lipase 45, LDH 280, total bili 0.9, albumin 3.3. White count
14.5, hematocrit 39.9, platelets 138,000. Diff 90
neutrophils, lymphocytes 6.4, monos 3.1, eos 0, basos 0.1.
Coags were normal.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the vascular
service. Renal was consulted for any hemodialysis needs. At
the time, they felt that the patient was stable from a renal
standpoint and they would continue to monitor her renal
function and electrolytes to determine whether further
dialysis was required. The patient received surgery on
[**10-26**]. She underwent an open aortic visceral
endarterectomy with primary closure. She was transferred to
the PACU, become hypotensive, returned to the surgical suite.
She was reopened and explored. There was no source of
bleeding or source for the hypotension. The patient remained
intubated, was transferred from the PACU to the ICU. The
patient remained in the ICU and was extubated on [**10-28**]
and was transferred to VICU for continued monitoring and
care. The patient's chest tube was placed to water fill on
[**10-29**] and this was removed on [**2145-10-31**]. The
patient experienced episodes of MAT, requiring amiodarone and
labetalol for rate suppression. She also required IV
nitroglycerin and beta blockers for her hypertension. Her CVL
was placed.  Iatrogenic pneumothorax, requiring a chest tube.
The patient's diet was advanced on [**10-30**] and she was
delined at that time. A steroid wean was begun on [**10-31**].
Oncology was consulted for initial findings of an
angiosarcoma by pathology. The chest tube was removed 24
hours after water fill. The post chest tube x-ray was without
pneumothorax. It was oncology's recommendation that no
further is recommended at this time. No radiation or
chemotherapy at this time unless the patient has recurrence.

On [**11-2**], C. dif for stool was sent. The results on
[**11-3**] were positive. Flagyl was begun. The patient was
converted to p.o. vancomycin on [**11-4**]. The patient
experienced an episode of hypotension secondary to
hypovolemia secondary to diarrhea. The patient was fluid
resuscitated and transferred to the VICU for continued
monitoring and care. Because of need for further pressor
support for her hypotension, the patient underwent a CT scan
which showed a large left psoas muscle hematoma. It was
determined no intervention at this time. Her C. dif was
treated with antibiotics, vanco and Flagyl. Platinum service
was consulted and felt that she did not have an acute abdomen
at this time and that they would not do anything unless
clinically indicated, then consider colonoscopy. The
patient's symptoms improved over the next 48 hours. She
continued to be followed by the renal service. She was
continued on TPN. The patient continued with the sero exams,
TPN and NPO. The patient finally passed flatus on [**2145-11-9**] and without diarrhea. KUB did not show any
obstruction and resolving ileus. The patient was begun on
sips on [**2145-11-10**].

Abdominal exams continued to improve. There was no tenderness
noted. Clears were started on [**2145-11-11**]. The patient
tolerated that. Her abdominal exam remained stable. She
continued to be followed by physical therapy who recommended
continue current management and she would require rehab at
the time of discharge. Her line was changed on [**2145-11-12**] resulting in a pneumothorax requiring chest tube
placement. Right IJ tunnel catheter was removed on [**2145-11-12**]. Chest tube went to water seal on [**2145-11-13**].
Chest tube was removed on [**2145-11-16**]. On [**2145-11-14**], the patient passed flatus and stool. KUB showed
resolution of ileus. Diet was advanced which the patient
tolerated. TNP
was discontinued on [**11-16**] and the patient was
transferred to regular floor status. Rehab screening was
instituted and physical therapy continued to work with the
patient. On [**2145-11-17**], it was anticipated that the
patient would be discharged to rehab but her AM labs showed a
potassium of 2.3. The potassium was repleted. Repeat
potassium this morning on [**11-18**] was 3.5. She was
repleted again. PM potassium and hematocrit will be checked.
If those are stable, the patient will be discharged to rehab
for continued care.

The remaining discharge summary will be dictated at the time
of discharge.
