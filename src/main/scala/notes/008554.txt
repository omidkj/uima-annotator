Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**]
Chief Complaint:
 hypoxic respiratory distress


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2112-4-11**]: fluoroscopy-guided replacement of old right arm
venous catheter (38.5 cm) with a new 4 French 38 cm single-lumen
PICC, and with its tip in the lower SVC confirmed on CXR.


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 69887**] is a 53 year old woman with MR, tracheomalacia (s/p
tracheostomy [**2107**]), PVD, multiple aspiration PNAs, and DM who
presents from her nursing facility with increased tracheal
secretions, fever and hypoxemia. The patient is able to answer
yes or no questions, but not able to provide a detailed history.
Therefore much of the history was compiled based upon records
sent over from the nursing facility. According to their report,
she had been in her usual state of health until last night when
she developed temp of 100 and O2 sat decreased to 79% on 35%
FiO2. This morning her temp rose to 101, RR 30, Pulse 120 BP
120/76. O2 sat decreased to 77% on 40% FiO2. She was then sent
to the ED for further evaluation.

In the ED, initial VS were: 97.2 124 144/62 24 98% 10L Trach
mask. She underwent CXR showing ? RLL opacification and labs
notable for WBC of 12.5K w/ left shift, Na 123, K 4.8, Cl 89,
CO2 29, Cr 0.9, lactate of 2.2, UA notable for pyuria,
bacteriuria trace leucocytes. She received Vanco 1g, Cefepime
2g, Flagyl 500mg IV. She was then admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
further management. VS prior to transfer were 154/57 98 22 92%
on 10L TM.

On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], patient's VS  97.3 105 134/67 23 98% on
50% FiO2. The patient denies feeling short of breath, chest
pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation.

Of note, the patient was seen in the ED ~6 weeks ago after
desaturating to 70s, which resolved with suctioning. She was
diagnosed as having a mucus plug but treated with a course of
levaquin to be safe.

CXR [**2112-4-13**]
Consolidation in the right mid lung is more pronounced today,
most likely
pneumonia. Vascular congestion of both hilar pulmonary arteries
and
mediastinal veins suggest cardiac decompensation, although
moderate
cardiomegaly is chronic. Tracheostomy tube has a relatively
short
intratracheal excursion, but projects over the tracheal lumen.
Right PIC line ends 5.5 cm below the carina, 2 cm below the
superior cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax.
.
CT CHEST [**2112-4-13**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Findings suggesting tracheomalacia.
2. Multifocal consolidations and areas of mucus plugging,
particularly
extensive in the right lung, worrisome for pneumonia.
3. Trace pleural effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 69887**] is a 53 year old woman with MR, tracheomalacia (s/p
tracheostomy [**2107**]), PVD, multiple aspiration PNAs, and DM who
presented with fever, tachypnea, and increased O2 requirement.

#) Hypoxemia, Psedomonal HCAP:
Fever, leukocytosis, increase in sputum production and evolution
of infiltrates on lung imaging were consistent with purulent
tracheobronchitis and pneumonia. The patient was initially
started on Cefepime and Vancomycin for HCAP coverage given
residence in nursing home. Patient's sputum culture grew
pseudomonas sensitive to cefepime. The patient was continued on
Cefepime with plan for total of 14 day course of antibiotics.
The patient should have repeat imaging in about six weeks to
evaluate for resolution of multifocal consolidations.
Patient was hypoxic on admission with increased oxygen
requirement secondary to pneumonia and mucous plugging. The
patient initially required aggressive pulmonary toilet with
