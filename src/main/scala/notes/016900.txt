Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] was admitted on [**2107-4-14**] with increased shortness of
breath with increased lymphagetic spread and collopse of left
lung. A chest CT was negative for pulmonary embolism with
increased disease process.  On [**2107-4-15**] he had a flexible
bronchoscopy.  He developed a right pneumothorax with
respiratory comprise.  A right pigtail was placed with
re-expansion of lung. He was transferred to the SICU, the
pigtail was to suction with a persistent air leak.  His oxygen
saturations were > 88-90% on 4L NC.  On [**2107-4-17**] was taken for
rigid and flexible bronchoscopy with tumor debridment, tumor
ablation with APC, and balloon dilation.  On [**2107-4-18**] he had PDT
infection.  The pigtail remained with to suction with minimal
leak but water seal trial attempted. Palliative care following
patient. Taken for PDT activation and transferred to general
surgical floor on [**2107-4-20**]. Medical oncology following and plan
to start sutent [**2107-4-21**]. Patient remained stable on 4L oxygen.

After PDT activation, apparent there was reaccumulation of right
pnuemothorax. CT placed back on suction. Plan to take patient to
OR on [**2107-4-22**] for tumor debridement to LMB. Chest tube kept at
wall suction. On [**2107-4-24**], triggered for tachycardia with fever.
Started on levaquin for 5 days. Chest to waterseal for trial.
Right pneumothorax spontaneously resolved. Patient tolerated
waterseal trial without respiratory distress. Clamp trial for
chest tube, which continued throughout night. Patient requiring
6L of oxygen. Taken to vascular lab for lower extremity
ultrasound which was negative for any clot. He was taken to OR
on [**2107-4-26**] for chest tube removal. CT scan of chest also showing
marked interval deteroration of left lung with consolidation and
prominent adenopathy. Plan to discharge patient after
chemotherapy on [**2107-4-27**].
