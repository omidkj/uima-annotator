History of Present Illness:
Briefly, 85 yo woman w/ transfusion dependant myelofiborisis,
diastolic CHF, small bowel AVM's, chronic venous insufficiency
who was transferred from rehab for anemia on [**11-16**] (HCT 21).  In
ED CXR showed early RLL infiltrate w/ pulm edema and she was
admitted to Medicine w/ dx of symptomatic anemia, aspiration
PNA, and CHF.  She was treated w/ IVF's, PRBCs, and 40mg lasix
IV, and was placed initially on levoflox and flagyl for presumed
aspiration PNA.  On HD #2 patient found to be hypotensive,
tachycardic, febrile, increasing O2 requirement after receiving
40 mg IV lasix, and was treated with IVF's, dopamine, ceftaz and
levo and transferred to the MICU.  Concern was for sepsis
(fever, low WBC, tachycardia thought to be sedondary to PNA) vs
hypotension, but the patient responded well to IVF boluses and
PRBC's, and pressors were weaned off by HD #3.

The pt denies dyspnea, chest pain. She does report recent
increase in LE edema and orthopnea. She denies any recent fever,
chills, weight loss, chest pain, palps, cough, abd pain,
dysuria, melena, and hematochezia.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 85 yo woman w/ transfusion dependant
myelofiborisis and diastolic CHF was sent from rehab to ED for
treatment of HCT 21. On arrival in the ED, T 96.3, BP 104/54, HR
95, O2 sat 92% RA-->98% 2L/m. A CXR showed an early RLL
infiltrate and pulmonary edema. She was admitted to Medicine
with a diagnosis of symptomatic anemia, aspiration PNA, and CHF.
She was treated w/ 3L NS, 2units PRBCs, and 40mg lasix IV. The
day after admission, she had temp of 100.0 and was treated with
levoflox 250mg IV and flagyl 500mg IV. UOP was 1600cc overnight.


At 3:45pm the next day, the patient was given lasix 40mg IV. 35
minutes later she was found to have BP 75/39, HR 120, RR 24, and
O2 sat 96% on 2L--> 100% NRB. Temp at that time was 101.8
rectal. She was treated w/ 1L NS, dopamine by PIV, and ceftaz
2gm, and levaquin 500mg. Within the hour, BP increased to 92/34,
HR 110. The MICU team was then consulted for evaluation.  The
patient was transferred to the MICU for treatment of possible
sepsis thought most likely secondary to PNA.  She was treated
with vanocmycin and ceftaz.

The patient was transferred out the floor.  Her antibiotics were
switched to vancoycin and ceftriaxone with a plan to treat for a
10 day course.  She was gently diuresed with lasix 10mg IV QD.
We continued to transfuse for hct<21 and platelets<15.

The patient continued to have increasing amounts of rectal
bleeding thought secondary to internal hemorroids in the setting
of platelets <20.  A GI consult was called.  The patient refused
an exam, but the GI team advised continuing to give platelets
and PRBC.  On [**2131-11-20**], the patient chose to change her code
status from full code to DNR/DNI.  Later that day, the patient
began to have hematuria and [**Date Range **] tingled sputum.  Her breathing
became more labored.  She improved with lasix and morphine, but
continued to become intermittently hypotensive and was again
spiking fevers.  A family meeting with the patient and her son
lead to a decision to make the patient CMO.  All treatments
other than lasix/morphine/and ativan were stopped.  The patient
was started on a morphine drip on [**2131-11-22**] and passed away on
[**2131-11-23**].  The family was notified and refused autopsy.
