Echo [**2165-1-23**]
Pre-bypass:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately
dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. There appears to be a mass in the aortic sinus distal
to the left coronary cusp. There is a raphe extending from the
right coronary cusp to the wall of the aorta. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
aortic regurgitation jet is eccentric, directed toward the
anterior mitral leaflet. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Post-bypass:
The patient is receiving no inotropic support post-CPB. There is
a bioprosthetic valve well-seated in the aortic position with
good leaflet excursion. There is no paravalvular or
transvalvular regurgitation. The mean gradient across the
prosthetic valve is 8 mm Hg at a cardiac output of 7.8 L/min.
Biventricular systolic function is preserved and similar to
prebypass function. All other findings are consistent with
pre-bypass findings. The aorta is intact post-decannulation. All
findings were discussed with the surgeon.

Conclusions
The left and right atrium are moderately dilated. There is
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is top normal with abnormal septal
motion (?post op vs. IVCD). Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic arch is
mildly dilated. A well seated aortic bioprosthesis is seen with
thin/mobile leaflets. The transaortic gradient is slightly
increased (?anemia). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate symmetic left ventricular hypertrophy with
mildly reduced global systolic function. Well seated aortic
valve bioprosthesis with slightly increased gradient. Mild
mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Final Report
INDICATION: 52-year-old man, status post dual chamber ICD,
assess lead
placement.
COMPARISON: Chest radiograph from [**2165-1-26**].
PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:
An ICD generator overlies the left pectoralis. The leads are
seen in
appropriate position within the right atrium and right
ventricle. There is no pneumothorax. The sternal wires are
intact. The lung parenchyma shows no focal or diffuse disease.
There is unchanged small left-sided pleural
effusion. The osseous structures are intact.
IMPRESSION: Appropriate ICD lead placement.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Underwent cardiac catheterization and was admitted post
procedure for preoperative testing.  The next day he was brought
to the operating room and underwent aortic valve replacement and
mass removal.  See operative report for further details.  He
received vancomycin for perioperative antibiotics. In summary he
had: Aortic valve replacement with 29-mm St. [**Hospital 923**] Medical Biocor
Epic tissue valve, his bypass time was 87 minutes with a bypass
time of 65 minutes. He tolerated the operation well and was
transferred from the operating room to the cardiac surgery ICU
in stable condition.  In the first twenty four hours he was
weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact, and was
extubated without complications.  He remained in the intensive
care unit to monitor his renal function and heart rhythm due to
atrial fibrillation.  He was treated with beta blockers and
amiodarone for atrial fibrillation which continued, so he was
started on coumadin for anticoagulation. He remained
hemodynamically stable and was transferred from the ICU to the
stepdown unit on POD2. Early morning of POD3 [**2165-1-27**] (1:45am)
the patient suffered a ventricular tachycardic cardiac arrest.
He was successfully cardioverted  transferred back to cardiac
surgery ICU for further recovery and started on an amiodarone
drip.  All electrolytes were repleted per protocol  The
following evening he had a 30 bea
