CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Dyspnea.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 86-year-old woman
with a past medical history of congestive heart failure with
diastolic dysfunction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
history of lung cancer, status post right upper lobe
resection in [**2122**], who presented to the Emergency Department
after having dyspnea and chest tightness for two days.

She was in her usual state of health until two days prior to
admission.  At baseline the patient is able to walk roughly
100 ft with a cane and uses a motorized wheelchair; however,
the patient began to feel dyspnea on exertion after walking
50 ft and had chest tightness.

The patient stated that she has had increased pieces of
liverwurst and questionable dietary indiscretion.  She denied
history of cough, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.  No
fevers or chills.

The patient's shortness of breath increased, and the patient
used her Lifeline. She denied any paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea but has lower extremity edema at baseline and has
some orthopnea at baseline.

The patient was found to have a blood pressure of 220/140,
pulse between 90s and 140s and breathing at 28-32 by EMS.  At
that time, her oxygen saturation was 96%.  The patient was
found to have atrial fibrillation up to 140.

In the Emergency Department, the patient was given Lasix and
Lopressor for her rapid atrial fibrillation.  Also the
patient was given BIPAP and ABG in the Emergency Department
where pH was 7.33, CO2 5, O2 162.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Congestive heart failure diastolic
dysfunction with echocardiogram in [**2127-8-14**].  This showed
markedly dilated left atrium, mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy, +2 mitral regurgitation, +2 tricuspid
regurgitation.  2.  Hypertension.  3.  Atrial fibrillation.
4.  Lung cancer status post right upper lobe resection in
[**2122**].  No chemotherapy or radiation therapy.  5.  Status post
cerebrovascular accident in [**2123**] with mild residual
right-sided weakness.  6.  Hypercholesterolemia.  7.  Chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease.  PFTs in [**2125-4-14**] showed an
FEV1 of 42% of predicted, FVC of 48% of predicted, ration 87%
of predicted.  8.  Skin graft of the left lower extremity on
[**2127-8-14**] after burn.  9.  Ulnar neuropathy bilaterally.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone.  She is widowed.
She has one son who passed away one year ago.  Her next of
[**Doctor First Name **] is her niece [**Name (NI) **], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 94124**].  The patient is
DNR/DNI.  The patient has home health aide five days a week
to help with bathing.  She has Meals on Wheels five times a
weeks.  VNA comes to her home once a week.  The patient has a
history of smoking, one-quarter pack per day, for 44 years;
she quit initially in [**2093**].  The patient ambulates with a
cane.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 98.3??????, pulse
91, blood pressure 163/69, respirations 20, oxygen saturation
100% 4 L nasal cannula.  General:  The patient was alert and
oriented times three.  She was in no acute distress.  She was
speaking in full sentences, grunting.  Obese.  HEENT:
Extraocular movements intact.  No scleral icterus was noted.
Neck:  Supple.  The patient had ................... jugular
venous distention.  Cardiovascular: Pulses irregularly
irregular.  She had a 3 out of 6 systolic murmur heard
diffusely across the precordium.  Lungs:  She had diffuse
expiratory wheezes.  There were crackles at the bases
bilaterally.  Abdomen:  Obese, nontender.  Positive bowel
sounds.  Extremities:  The patient had +1 pitting edema up to
the knee.  The patient has a small area of ulceration of the
left lower extremity secondary to fall.  Neurological:  No
focal deficits.  Cranial nerves II-XII intact.  Speech was
normal.  Face was symmetric.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission white count 5.8, hematocrit
42.7; creatinine 0.9; troponin 0.01; urinalysis showed
evidence of urinary tract infection, positive nitrites, many
bacteria, 5 white blood cells, no epithelial cells.

Chest x-ray showed enlarged cardiac silhouette with an
opacity in the right upper lobe which has been unchanged from
previous chest x-rays.

Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation, normal axis,
old Q-waves in leads III.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the Intensive Care
Unit.  It was thought that the patient was dyspneic secondary
to congestive heart failure exacerbation.  The most likely
etiology of this was her dietary indiscretion and possible
medication noncompliance.

The patient was aggressively diuresed during her stay at the
Intensive Care Unit.  The patient was ruled out for
myocardial infarction.

After one day of diuresis in the Intensive Care Unit, the
patient was transferred to the [**Company 191**] Medicine Floor.  The
patient was continued on aggressive diuresis including Lasix.
The patient's shortness of breath continued to improve.

Electrocardiogram showed that the patient was in atrial
fibrillation.  Echocardiogram was performed which showed an
ejection fraction greater than 55%, dilated left atrium, 2+
tricuspid regurgitation, 2+ mitral regurgitation, mild
pulmonary artery hypertension, mild aortic valve stenosis.
The patient was also placed on beta-blockers and ACE
inhibitors.  Afterload was reduced, and diastolic filling was
improved with beta-blockers.

The patient had a urinary tract infection.  She was treated
with Levofloxacin for three days with improvement of symptoms
and dysuria.

The patient complained of neck pain during the hospital
course.  The patient has a history of C7 fracture after a
motor vehicle collision.  X-rays of the neck were performed
which showed no evidence of fracture; she had significant
degenerative changes most likely relating to her pain.

The patient also complained of a headache and visual changes.
Headache was localized to the right temporal area, and visual
changes were noted on the right eye.  The patient was thought
to probably have symptoms of temporal arteritis.  The patient
had a head CT performed to evaluate for occipital lobe
abnormalities.  There was evidence of some abnormalities but
unchanged compared to prior CT in the occipital area.

Temporal artery biopsy was performed on the right temporal
artery.  The patient was started on Prednisone 60 mg once a
day.  The patient's headache and visual change symptoms were
resolving a the time of discharge.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.  No longer short of breath.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To [**Hospital3 **].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Congestive heart failure exacerbation secondary to
medications noncompliance and dietary indiscretion.

3.  Urinary tract infection.
4.  Degenerative bone and disk disease of the neck.
