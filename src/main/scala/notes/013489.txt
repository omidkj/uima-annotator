PMV and Swallowing Follow-up

We returned to follow-up with pt re: PMV toleration and
swallowing status. Pt was recommended for small amounts of puree
only with PMV in place on [**7-9**]. [**Name8 (MD) **] RN, pt has been tolerating
trach collar since yesterday (approx. 24 hours). RN reportedly
gave pt thickened soda once, but no puree. Pt awaiting d/c to
rehab this afternoon or tomorrow am. Recommend continued PMV use
as tolerated. Continue tube feeds as primary means of
nutrition/hydration/medication. Recommend instrumental
swallowing
evaluation upon arrival to rehab [**3-6**] silent aspiration noted on
FEES evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course:
At the moment of admission he had :
EKG that showed: Sinus bradycardia. Borderline P-R interval
prolongation. Consider left atrial abnormality. Borderline low
limb lead voltage. Intraventricular conduction delay of right
bundle-branch block type. No previous tracing available for
comparison. Clinical correlation is suggested.

CT head: No acute intracranial abnormality.
CT spine: No fracture or malalignment of the thoracic or lumbar
spine. Mild
degenerative changes in the thoracic and lumbar spine. Bilateral
renal cystic
formations

Spinal fluoro: There is increased disc space at C5-6 and
anterolisthesis of C5 on
C6 with a small amount of angulation. Please see CT and MR from
the same day
for further description of C-spine abnormalities.

MRI: At least 50% of anterolisthesis is demonstrated at C5/C6
level
with bilateral facet dislocation as previously demonstrated by
cervical CT on
[**2136-6-23**].

Ortho spine took him to the operation room. He had:
1. Bilateral C3 laminotomy.
2. Laminectomy C4, C5, C6, C7, T1.
3. Open reduction, manual, of C5-C6 fracture dislocation.
4. Posterior cervical arthrodesis C4-T1.
5. Application of local autograft for fusion augmentation.
6. Application of allograft for fusion augmentation

Also he had: Left hand compartment release, specifically the
thenar compartment, the thumb adductor compartment,  the first
dorsal interosseous compartment, the second dorsal interosseous
compartment and the first palmar interosseous compartment.

After surgery patient was transferred to the Surgical ICU
