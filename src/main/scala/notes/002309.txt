History of Present Illness:
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 87 yo M with chronic kidney disease
s/p AV Graft placement [**8-2**], stroke, hypertension, diabetes, and
peripheral vascular disease presents with chest pain and
shortness of breath. He reports that his chest pain began
approximately one week ago. During the week it has gotten worse.
It is substernal, radiating to left shoulder, especially with
inspiration. It is associated with shortness of breath. He came
to the hospital today because the pain was much worse, [**9-6**]. In
addition, he noted today black stools. He has been taking iron.
He reports lightheadedness. Denies nausea, vomiting,
diaphoresis, arm paresthesias. He has also noticed a cough
recently but has not been able to produce sputum (though he
feels congested).
.
The pt was seen in Geriatric Urgent Care clinic on [**9-11**] for
dyspnea. He noted worsening in the supine position. An CXR at
the time to evaluate possible CHF showed "No evidence of
congestive heart failure or pneumonia. Elevation of the right
hemidiaphragm".
.
In the ED, the patient was given 80mg IV lasix x 2 with UOP of
100-200cc. He received nitropaste, lopressor IV and [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], and
morphine, and was started on a nitro gtt. Heparin was started as
well, and 1 unit PRBCs was transfused. He was given one dose of
protonix, levofloxacin and . BPs were in the 110s-120s/50s-60s,
HR 70s-80s. Renal, GI, and cardiology consults were called. The
patient continued to report [**9-6**] pain, eventually decreased to
[**6-6**] with titration of the nitro gtt. On arrival in the CCU, he
still reported [**6-6**] pain. He was on nitro at 120 mcg/min and
heparin at 850 units/hr.

.

consistent with left ventricular heart failure.
CXR 8pm: read pending
.
[**2134-9-12**] Cath
COMMENTS:
1. Right heart catheterization revealed elevated right and left
sided
pressures. (PCWP = 25 mmhg).
2. Left heart catheterization revealed no evidence of systolic
hypertension.  Calculated cardiac output and index were 5.0/2.8.

3. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
three vessel coronary artery disease.  The left main coronary
artery had
a 40% mid-vessel stenosis.  The left anterior descending artery
had
diffuse proximal disease with serial 70-80% stenosis.  The left
anterior
descending had mild diffuse disease in the mid and distal
segments.  The
large first diagonal had an 80% proximal lesion.  The left
circumflex
coronary artery had mild diffuse disease in the proximal, mid,
and
distal segments.  There was a subtotal occlusion of the OM1.
The right
coronary artery was the dominant vessel.  There was total
occlusion of
the right coronary artery in the proximal segment.  The distal
RCA
filled via collaterals from the LCA septal branches.
4. No left ventriculography was undertaken given elevated Cr.
5. Successful predilation using 2.0 X 12 sprinter balloon and
stenting
using a minivision 2.5 X 23 stent of the proximal OM1 with
lesion
reduction from 99 to 0%
6. Successful predilaton using a 2.0 X 20 Maverick balloon and
stenting
using 3.0 X 30 Driver stent of the proximal LAD with lesion
reduction
from 80% to 0%.
7. Successful predilation using 2.0 X 12 sprinter balloon and
stenting
using a 2.25 X 15 minivision stent of the proximal D1 with
lesion
reduction from 80% to 0%. The final angiogram showed TIMI III
flow in
the vessels intervened with no residual stenoses in any of the
stents.
Thre was no distal embolisation or dissection noted in any
vessel.
8. Successful insertion of IABP via right femoral artery.
( see PTCA comments for the above procdures from 5 through to 8)

9. At the request of the renal consultants, a 12 French Dialysis
central
venous catheter was placed using the Seldinger technique in the
left
common femoral vein.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Elevated right and left sided pressures.
3. Preserved cardiac output/cardiac index.
4. Successful stenting of the OM, LAD and D1.
5. Successful insertion of IABP via right femoral artery.
6. Successful implantation of a central venous dialysis catheter
in the
left femoral vein.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Rhythm: pt had 2 episodes of monomorphic VT accompanied by
fall in BP, LOC, terminated x 1 via precordial thumb.
Electrolytes were repeleted, pt was bolused with Amiodarone x 2,
and started on an Amio gtt. Amiodarone was then changed to po,
with a dosing schedule of 400 mg [**Hospital1 **] for one week, followed by
400 mg daily for one week, then 200 mg per day.  Monomorphic VT
thought to be likely due to a fixed area of scarring from
previous MI.  Placement of an ICD was discussed.  However, given
the pt's poor prognosis for non sudden cardiac death reasons,
and given his increased infectious risk, it was decided to treat
his arrhythmia medically.  Of note, the QT interval was
prolonged (506), likely secondary to amiodarone.  Patient
remained in sinus rhythm on Amiodarone.
2. CAD: Pt with NSTEMI. Cath on [**9-12**] showed 3 vessel disease,
subsequently underwent successful stenting of OM, D1, LAD and
IABP placement. IABP was discontinued after the patient was able
to maintain his own pressure.
Echo completed on [**9-13**], which showed apical akinesis, with
severely depressed systolic function.  Patient was initially
started on heparin and bridged to Coumadin, however, he had
another episode of guaiac positive stool, and given his history
of melena and coffee ground emesis, the risk for GI bleed was
thought to be high and anticoagulation was discontinued.
The patient was continued on an aspirin, Statin, beta blocker,
and was started on an ACE, all of which he will continue as an
outpatient.  His swan and sheath were discontinued without
complications.
3.PUMP: CHF: EF 20% by ECHO
He was initially placed on Imdur/Hydral for afterload reduction
and an ACE was initially avoided in an attempt to salvage his
kidneys.  However, he was eventually started on low-dose
lisinopril to be titrated up if necessary.  Patient also
underwent h
