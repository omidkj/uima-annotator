Service: Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 84 year old female
with a known past medical history of hypertension and
borderline hypercholesterolemia, who presented at [**Hospital **]
Hospital two days prior to admission at [**Hospital6 649**] with one day history of chest pain.  On the
evening of [**Holiday 1451**] she developed some chest pain that
radiated to her back and scapula with some slight
diaphoresis.  She thought it was heartburn but the pain
persisted.  The next day she went to the [**Hospital **] Hospital
Emergency Room.  Electrocardiogram showed ST elevations.  She
received Nitropaste, Oxygen, Lopressor and Aspirin.  Repeat
electrocardiogram showed inferior T wave inversion with ST
segment resolution anteriorly.  She ruled in for myocardial
infarction with peak creatinine kinase of 1182, MB 62, and
index of 52 and troponin of 14.2.  She was started on Heparin
and Integrilin drip but they were discontinued on [**10-15**]
due to a large left antecubital hematoma and a symptomatic
scleral bleed of her right eye.  She was painfree since
admission and was transferred in from [**Hospital **] Hospital [**Hospital6 1760**] today.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Hypertension; 2.  Borderline
hypercholesterolemia.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Status post dilatation and curettage
in her remote history.

ALLERGIES:  She was allergic to Penicillin which causes
hives.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She was not a smoker and used alcohol
rarely.

MEDICATIONS:  Medications at home revealed Lasix and
[**Doctor First Name 233**]-Ciel, although the patient was unable to give us the
doses.  Medications on transfer include Lopressor 25 mg p.o.
q. 6 hours, Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., Lisinopril 5 mg p.o.
q.d., Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.

LABORATORY DATA:  Admission laboratory revealed white count
7.4, hematocrit 32.1, platelets 212,000, sodium 139,
potassium 3.9, chloride 110, bicarbonates 28, BUN 16,
creatinine 0.8.  Her troponin was cycled as follows, 14.2,
11.6, 12.5, and 7.67.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Plan was that she would have cardiac
catheterization done.  She was seen by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of
Cardiothoracic Surgery Service.  On his examination she had
no bruits and no jugulovenous distension.  She was alert and
oriented, neurologically she appeared to be intact.  Her
heart was regular rate and rhythm, her abdomen was benign.
Her lungs were clear and she had weak peripheral pulses with
varicosities in her lower extremities.  Her blood pressure on
the right was 145/84 and blood pressure on the left was
138/76 and she was sating 94% on room air.  A Foley catheter
was in place on transfer.  Cardiac catheterization took place
on [**10-16**], after transfer which showed an ejection
fraction of 50% with no mitral regurgitation.  The 50% left
main lesion, proximal 50% left anterior descending lesion
with an 80% diagonal 1 lesion, 80% circumflex and 100%
thrombotic occlusion of the right coronary artery.  On
[**10-17**], she underwent coronary artery bypass grafting
times three by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with left internal mammary artery
to the left anterior descending, vein graft to the obtuse
marginal 2 and vein graft to the right coronary artery.  She
was transferred to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit in
good condition on Epinephrine drip at 0.01 mcg/min,
Neo-Synephrine drip at 1.5 mcg/kg/min and a Propofol drip
which was titrated.  When she arrived in the unit she
initially had a fairly labile blood pressure.  She required
significant volume.  She received some packed red blood cells
for a hematocrit of 23%.  She was waking up slowly in the
course of the evening.  She was alert and oriented and
following commands but fell asleep very quickly when not
stimulated.  She was switched to CPAP so that she could be
more awake when extubation was attempted.  At approximately
2140 in the evening she was extubated without incident and
was able to clear her secretions and continue with deep
breathing.  She had some hypotension in the 70s to 80s with a
little bit of exertion.  She was given additional fluid and
her hemodynamics improved.  Her heartrate dropped slightly.
She had some transient nausea but the Reglan treated this
successfully.  On postoperative day #1 she had been extubated
over night.  She was a little bit tachycardiac.  She received
some fluid and some beta blockade and started her Aspirin.
Postoperatively her hematocrit was 29.3 and 31.0 with a BUN
of 7, creatinine 0.4.  Her platelet count did drop to 57,000
and her lactate came back at 1.8.  She remained on
Epinephrine drip at 0.01 and a Neo-Synephrine drip at 1.25.
Her Lopressor was started at 25 b.i.d.  She was receiving
fluid boluses prn and continued on her perioperative
antibiotics.  At approximately 9 PM in the evening, she
became distressed and sort of anxious with functioning and
thrashing in bed.  Her heartrate went up to 150s and the
patient went into atrial fibrillation, and she did require
reintubation for hyperventilation.  She also received some
more packed red blood cells to treat her hematocrit.  On
postoperative day #2, she remained on epinephrine at 0.01 and
Neo-Synephrine adhesion been decreased to 0.75 with a good
blood pressure of 115/58.  She remained on CPAP with pressure
support.  Her hematocrit stabilized to 31.2, a BUN 9 and
creatinine 0.6.  The decision was made to do a slower wean
today and decrease her pressure support and to wean off of
the epinephrine.  Functioning was otherwise unremarkable.
She was neurologically intact, and the patient was extubated
on the fifth at noon and was doing well post extubation.  On
postoperative day #3, she converted back into normal sinus
rhythm, was Amiodarone drip at 0.5 and a Neo-Synephrine drip
at .7.  Epinephrine had been turned off.  She had a
reasonable index of 2.49.  Her hematocrit dropped slightly
26.7.  Her examination was otherwise unremarkable.  The
Swan-Ganz catheter was removed with plans to wean her
Neo-Synephrine during the day.  She remained on the
Amiodarone drip to maintain sinus rhythm.  She was seen by
the Clinical Nutrition Team for evaluation for tube feedings.
On postoperative day #4, she continued with Diuresis and
Amiodarone for atrial fibrillation.  Her Metoprolol was
changed to 12.5 b.i.d. and she continued on Aspirin.  She was
also receiving aggressive pulmonary toilet and she was
transferred out to Far 2.  She was evaluated by the physical
therapy team there and also with the venous access team as
she had no reasonable peripheral intravenous site and still
had a left very large antecubital hematoma from her
Integrilin therapy at the outlying hospital prior to
admission.  Her pacing wires were removed on the morning of
#7 and she was transferred out to Far 2.  When she was alert
and oriented on the morning of [**10-21**], she was very
pleasant, jovial and was regaining her strength and was
mentating appropriately.  When she was transferred out to Far
2 on [**10-23**] where she remained on Telemetry monitoring.
She slept periodically and napped throughout the day.
Physical therapy was reconsulted to continue her ambulation,
which she continued to improve at.  On postoperative day #7,
which was the day of transfer she was in sinus rhythm in the
70s, 96% on 3 liters nasal cannula.  Her creatinine was
stable at 0.7 with a hematocrit of 31.4, her white count was
normal.  Her extremities continued to have 2 to 3+ pitting
edema but her incisions were clean, dry and intact.  Her
sternum was stable.  She continued diuresis and physical
therapy and screening for rehabilitation placement.

The addendum to the discharge summary will be dictated
tomorrow morning on [**10-26**], when she is discharged.
