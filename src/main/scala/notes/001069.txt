IMPRESSION & RECOMMENDATIONS:
71M s/p mech fall off ladder with C1 anterior and posterior arch
fractures. Ambulatory at scene and NVI in OSH ED prior to
intubation.
-Recommend CT scan T,L,S spine to assess for additional spine
injury
-Log roll precautions
-[**Location (un) 2848**] J c-collar at all times
-Stable c-spine injury pattern - will treat conservatively with
non-operative management

CT scan TL Spine
1. Acute transverse fracture across a T12 vertebral body
hemangioma and
coursing into the left lamina, with minimal retropulsion. MR
should be
considered for further evaluation to assess for cord injury.
2. Hepatic steatosis.
3. Trace bilateral pleural effusions. Area of left lower lobe
consolidation
may reflect mild aspiration.
4. 21 mm cystic lesion arising from the lower pole of the right
kidney is
indeterminate on this single phase study. Further outpatient
evaluation with
ultrasound could be considered in six months to assess for
stability.
5. Minimally displaced left 12th rib and left L2 and right L3
(2:81)
transverse process fractures.

MRI
1. No evidence of spinal cord edema/contusion. There is no
significant
spinal canal narrowing seen.
2. T12 vertebral body fracture with minimal anterior epidural
swelling as
described above. Also seen is an acute compression fracture of
C7 and T1.
Fractures of C1 and posterior element fractures are better seen
on the recent
CT study.
3. Multilevel degenerative changes without significant canal
stenosis. There
is narrowing of the subarticular recesses bilaterally at L4-L5
contacting the
traversing [**Name (NI) 13032**] nerve roots.
See prior CT Torso.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] Spine Surgery Service. He was
brought intubated from OSH and admitted to ICU. CT scan and MRi
spinI scans of the spine revealed T12 unstable fracture in
addition to C1 fracture (stable). Neurological status was
difficult to assess. He was and taken to the Operating Room for
the above procedure for T12 fracture.  Refer to the dictated
operative note for further details.  The surgery was without
complication and the patient was transferred to the ICU in a
stable condition.  TEDs/pnemoboots were used for postoperative
DVT prophylaxis.  Intravenous antibiotics were continued for
24hrs postop per standard protocol. Initial postop pain was
controlled.

No HVAC drains were used.

Events in the hospital
[**6-6**]: Extubated
[**6-7**]: Difficult to arouse, does not move UE and LE adequately.
Only some movement in fingers and toes. Requested limited scan
of the spine.
[**6-8**]: No evidence of ongoing cord compresison on MRI.
[**6-10**]: Moving better, dressing changed, Incision CDI, okay to
anticoagulate.

Foley was removed on POD#2.

Physical therapy was consulted for mobilization OOB to ambulate.


On the day of discharge the patient was afebrile with stable
vital signs, comfortable on oral pain control and tolerating a
regular diet.
