Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 43 year old gentleman s/p renal transplant for IgA
nephropathy in [**2160**] who presented with fever, nonproductive
cough and dyspnea for 2 days.  He was found to have multilobar
pneumonia and acute on chronic renal failure.  He was started on
levofloxacin and cefepime; however, by HD 2 the patient
exhibited signs of respiratory failure and required intubation.

.
Dyspnea: RUL and LLL lobar PNA evident on cxr. No evidence of
fluid overload on chest imaging.  Initially, component of
dyspnea thought to be secondary to AG acidosis [**2-8**] uremia, but
dyspnea did not improve with HD.  He was initially started on
stress-dose steroids, cefepime/levofloxacin for a
community-acquired PNA, and bactrim treatment doses for PCP PNA,
given his immunocompromised state with little improvement.  On
HD2, he began to desat, with poor oxygenation, so the decision
was made to electively intubate.  Vanc and flagyl were added, as
he had a continued leukocytosis and his CXRs were getting worse.
 He was bronch'd with BAL with PCP studies negative, so bactrim
was d/c'd.  ID was consulted after he did not improve after [**4-11**]
days of antibiotics.  Mycoplasma, and fungal serologies were
sent at this point.  Meanwhile, urine legionella came back
positive, and his BAL legionella cx. grew out G- rods.  He was
then continued on levofloxacin, with other abx. d/c'd.  He
showed steady improvement on the vent and was extubated on HD
#7.  He has continued to have an oxygen requirement post
extubation and was transferred to the floor. After one day on
the floor, he did not require O2. RA sats and ambulatory sats on
d/c were above 90%.  He is to continue levofloxacin for a total
of 21 days-this is renally dosed, so he is only to take after
dialysis.
.
ESRD on HD: Pt's baseline Cr over the past several years has
been in the 3s-4s. However has been rising steadily since [**4-12**].
Cr on admission at 12, which is the highest it has been.  He was
initially started on dialysis through a maturing AV fistula, but
after a few treatments, the fistula began to infiltrate and he
required placement of a tunneled dialysis cath by IR, through
which he is now receiving dialysis.  He has been followed by his
primary nephrologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1366**] and the reanl consult service
throughout his stay here. Cellcept was discontinued, but
prednisone and cyclosporine were continued. Arinesp was replaced
by Epo at HD. The patient also no longer requires NaHCO3, lasix
and metolazone which he came into the hospital taking.
.
s/p renal tx: Pt. was continued on prednisone and cyclosporine.
Cellcept d/c'd.
.
anemia: Pt. with slowly dropping hct on top of basline anemia
during his hospitalization with guaiac + stools.   Fe studies
c/w ACD, hemolysis labs negative.  Pt. got 2U transfusion when
hct at 19, and hct stable since that time.  He will require
outpt. colonoscopy upon d/c.
.
HTN: pt. extremely hypertensive intially, likely baseline with
component of high dose steroids.  Increased home labetalol,
nifedipine doses and has been well controlled since that time.
On the floors, nifedipine was d/c'd and lisinopril 10 mg QD was
started. We also continued labetolol, but changed it to 400 mg
[**Hospital1 **].
.
LE edema: improved with dialysis.  Lasix has not been that
helpful given poor renal function/UO. We d/c'd lasix and
metolazone.
.
hyperlipidemia: continued home statin
.
Hyperglycemia: Pt. with difficult to control sugars. Glucose
high given high dose steroids. After the steroids were tapered,
patients sugars were much better. He did require approx 4 units
of regular insulin per day on sliding scale. He has never used
insulin at home and should be followed up as outpatient to have
HbA1C checked.
