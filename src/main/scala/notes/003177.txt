Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3918**]
Chief Complaint:
cough and fevers x 1 month

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation
bone marrow biopsy

History of Present Illness:
70 yo female with complicated hx of lung disease, thought likely
to be Rheumatoid lung, previously evaluated/treated at [**Hospital1 **] in MN, now presents with symptoms similar to previous
presentations with cough and fevers x 4-5 weeks.
.
Pt notes that her sx previously began approx [**7-9**], with onset of
rhinorrhea with post-nasal drip, development of a cough, and
subsequent persistent fevers.  During the initial episode, she
was treated with levofloxacin and her symptoms appeared to
improve for a few months.  Her symptoms later recurred. She was
evaluated at [**Hospital3 14659**] in MN, where her nephew is a
pulmonary-critical physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] the diagnosis is not
entirely clear, she is presumed to have rheumatoid lung disease
without evidence of articular involvement.  She had a repeat CT
chest at [**Hospital1 **] approx 6 weeks ago; pt not aware of results.  Pt
states that she has had extensive testing, but is unclear about
details.
She notes that she has a hx of hematologic involvement with her
prior episodes, and has required blood transfusion previously.
Her HCT has dropped from 30 to 24.
.
More recently, she was provided a course of Levofloxacin, which
she completed [**9-30**], which did not provide benefit.
.

Past Medical History:
1.  Significant for a diagnosis of rheumatoid lung disease.  She
was hospitalized after complaints of cough and fever at the [**Hospital3 85404**] in 08/[**2112**].  She was found to have interstitial pulmonary
infiltrates, had a hematologic involvement, elevated CCP, and
mild splenomegaly.  Her lung disease was consistent with
organizing pneumonitis and small airways inflammatory process.
She had a lung biopsy, which was not diagnostic, but consistent
with potential rheumatoid lung disease.  Has been treated with
prednisone and azathioprine as well as hydroxychloroquine.
There
was some question of whether there was a component of
hypersensitivity pneumonitis as well given that she lived in a
house in [**State 760**] with significant mold.  She has subsequently
moved from that house.  She has no joint manifestations of
rheumatoid arthritis.  The patient spent much of the winter of
[**2112**], hospitalized in the [**Hospital3 14659**].  She had a prolonged
hospitalization in [**7-/2113**], and then again was readmitted in
12/[**2112**].  See below.  Was subsequently in a rehabilitation
facility until [**2114-3-15**], and recently moved to [**Location (un) 86**].
2.  Proximal lower extremity myopathy.
3.  Distal fibular fracture in [**1-/2114**], after a fall, underwent
nonoperative treatment.
4.  Deep venous thrombophlebitis, diagnosed also in [**10/2113**], had
a repeat ultrasound revealing some residual clot after three
months; therefore, I had an extension of her course to a
six-month total period of treatment, finished this at the end of
06/[**2113**].
5.  Urge incontinence.
6.  Osteoporosis.
7.  Osteoarthritis.  She is soon to undergo a right total hip
replacement at the [**Hospital3 14659**].
8.  C. diff colitis x2.
9.  Recurrent urinary tract infections.  Had an admission for
urosepsis at the [**Hospital3 14659**] from [**2113-11-2**], to [**2113-11-22**].
10.  Anemia of chronic disease.
11.  GERD.
12.  Thyroid nodule with a negative biopsy and evaluation in the
past.
13.  Fibrocystic changes in breast.
14.  Cardiovascular.  The patient had an extensive lower
extremity edema during her hospitalization, had a normal
echocardiogram in [**3-/2114**], revealing an ejection fraction of 60%
with no valvular heart disease.
15.  Diverticulosis.  Had a colonoscopy in [**12/2113**], that was
otherwise unrevealing.
16.  History of hypertension, taken off medications during [**Hospital1 **]
hospitalization.

tonsillectomy, and thumb surgery on the left eight years ago.
