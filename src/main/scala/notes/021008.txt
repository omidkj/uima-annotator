Pertinent Results:
CT:
Multiple filling defects involving both right and left pulmonary

Recommend
correlation with EKG
.
CXR:
IMPRESSION:  No effusion or pneumonia.  Limited study; dedicated
PA/lateral
recommended if continued concern for pneumonia
.
ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Compared with the prior study
(images reviewed) of [**2193-2-25**], the images the findings are
similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pulmonary Emboli: The patient was admitted to the MICU and
placed on a heparin drip. She maintained her blood pressure and
oxygen saturation in the 90's on supplemental 02.  She did not
require intubation or pressors.  She recieved a 10mg loading
dose of Coumadin on [**11-19**], followed by 5mg for the next 2 days.
On [**11-20**] she was transferred to the general medical floor. The
patient did well and the supplemental oxygen was discontinued on
[**11-22**]. On [**11-22**] her coumadin dose was increased to 7.5 mg due to
continued subtherapeutic INR. INR reached 2.4 on [**11-24**]. Heparin
was discontinued on [**11-25**]. She was seen by phyical therapy who
recommended inpatient rehabilitation for the patient's decreased
pulmonary status. She should remain on coumadin for life given
this second occurrence of unprovoked PE.
.
Diabetes:  In the MICU, she had a fasting blood suger over 400
consistently despite sliding scale and so insulin drip was
started in unit. The high blood sugar was thought to be due to
steroids given by EMT and in the ED. After she was transferred
to the floor, She was taken off of her insulin drip and her home
insulin regimen was restarted with reasonable glucose control.
However, blood sugars ranged from AM values of 200 to afternoon
values of 340's. Her standing NPH doses have been increased
accordingly and may need to be further titrated if BG remain
high. We continued her Ace-inhibitor.
.
Hypertension: Was well controlled throughout admission. Patient
was continued on Ace-inhibitor, verapamil. Lasix was held for
one day in the MICU due to the given dye load with CTA. Lasix
was then restarted. on [**11-23**] the patient's creatinine rose to
1.9; Lasix was then discontinued again and can likely be
restarted tomorrow given that Cr is improving now.
.
Diastolic CHF: Chronic, no evidence of current exacerbation.
Continued Lasix and other medications for hypertension control.
Lasix has now been held for a few days due to elevated Cr (see
below) but can be restarted tomorrow.
.
Chronic Renal Failure: secondary to diabetetic nephropathy.
Patient's kidney function during this hospitalization was
stable, although on [**2193-11-23**] had a bump in her creatinine to
1.9.  This improved with gentle fluids and holding of lasix.
Lasix can likely be restarted tomorrow given improvement in Cr.
She was continued on her ace-inhibitor.
.
Asthma: Ms. [**Known lastname **] experienced some asthmatic symptoms, such as
wheezing and shortness of breath that were probably exacerbated
by her pulmonary embolisms. She was continued on advair,
singulair, albuterol nebulizer, and albuterol inhaler. Her
asthma was well-controlled during her hospitalization.
.
Prior hemoptysis: Patient had one episode of hemoptysis which
appeared to be in the setting of acute bronchitis. She was
monitored for hemoptysis and none was noted. If hemoptysis
recurs, outpatient bronchoscopy could be considered.
.
Fibromyalgia:Patient recieved pain control as needed.
.
Prophylaxis: Patient was placed on an H2 blocker,IV
anticoagulation, and a bowel regimen
