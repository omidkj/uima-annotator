Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfered from [**Hospital3 **] due to power failure at that
facility; diagnosis of catheter-related enterococcal bacteremia,
vertebral compression fracture, and abdominal pain NOS.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC placement

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4223**] was transfered from [**Hospital3 **] after a power
shortage there.  She is a 61F with PMH T2DM, O2-dependent COPD,
vertebral compression fracture T9 s/p vertebroplasty, h/o VTE,
anxiety, and chronic back pain who was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] with acute on chronic back pain, abdominal pain, and
shortness of breath.  Evaluation there was notable for
enterococcal bacteremia, presumed arising from an infected
Port-a-Cath which was subsequently removed.  Evaluation for
source of abdominal discomfort, including CT scan, abdominal
ultrasound, HIDA, was reportedly unrevealing other than
demonstration of a probable acute T10 vertebral fracture.  She
was treated with unasyn and gentamycin prior to transfer to our
ICU, where she arrived in stable condition.
Initially underwent a lap-CCY on [**10-28**].  Discharged to home.
Re-admitted with mental status change and back pain.  Went back
to OR with no issues.  Recent vertebral fractures at T9-10
levels.  Already had T9 vertebroplasty done at OSH.
Vertebroplasty was planned at T10 level however patient
developed enteroccal bacteremia and was held.
Enterococcus in blood around [**11-6**].  Started on unasyn/gent.
Also received azithromycin x once there. Further records are
currently unavailable from OSH.
.
Also on chroinc steroids for COPD.
.
Portacath d/c'd.
.
Patient currently has abdominal pain.  Denies chest pain or any
other pain.  Has had 2 BM per day, nonbloody.  Denies SOB.
Asking for food.
.


Past Medical History:
1. Diabetes
2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:  Home O2 (2 liters)
and BiPAP at night (15/5).  Trying to wean off on steroids given
right knee ostonecrosis and vertebral fractures.  Started on
Methotrexate.
3. Recently diagnosed T9 s/p verteroplasty.
4. h/o DVT/PE

CT abd/pelvis w/o contrast [**11-14**]:
1. No CT explanation for abdominal pain.
2. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
3. T9 and T10 compression fracture. Status post T9
vertebroplasty.
4. Non-obstructive right renal calculi.
5. Bibasilar atelectasis.
6. Soft tissue prominence adherent to the wall of the cecum,
likely represents stool. Normal appendix.
.
TTE on [**11-15**]: Technically suboptimal study. The left atrium is
elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF 70%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. No vegetation/mass is
seen on the pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.
If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D
echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Hospital1 18**] PROBLEM-BASED SUMMARY:
.
1. Enterococcal bactermemia: The patient remained afebrile and
hemodynamically stable throughout her admission.  TTE failed to
demonstrate vegetation.  ID consultation was requested, who
advised completion of a 6-week course of IV antibiotic therapy
with ampicillin and gentamycin (goal gent peak [**3-14**], goal trough
<1); 6-week course will be completed as of [**12-26**].  Follow-up in
[**Hospital **] clinic is scheduled for Tuesday [**11-23**] at 2PM;
CBC/CHEM/LFTs/Gent levels should be drawn on Monday [**11-22**], with
results faxed to ID fellow Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1075**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 432**].  The
patient should have surveillance blood cultures drawn two weeks
s/p cessation of antibiotics.
.
3. COPD exacerbation: Steroid taper, theophylline, and
bronchodilator therapy were continued.  Methotrexate was held.
She remained stable from a respiratory standpoint during her
hospital course.
.
4. Abdominal pain of uncertain etiology: Given recent extensive
workup without diagnosis, it was suspected that her abdominal
complaints might represent a referred pain syndrome related to
her acute vertebral compression fracture.  Pain Service
consultation was requested, who advised multi-[**Doctor Last Name 360**] analgesic
regimen with long-acting morphine, percocet, duloxetine,
gabapentin, and lidocaine patch.
.
5. History of venous thromboembolism: She was maintained on
enoxaparin at 1mg/kg [**Hospital1 **] during her hospital stay, without
evidence of complication.
.
6. Vertebral fracutures at T9 and 10 levels: She had vertebral
plasty at T9 level at OSH.  Cont calcitonin nasal spray and
current pain management.  Cont tapering of steroids.
.
7. Sinus tachycardia: The patient had a persistent resting
tachycardia during her inpatient stay, despite appearing roughly
euvolemic.  Persistent pain, beta-agonist effect, and possibly
theophylline may have been contributing factors.  There was no
evidence of significant structural or pericardial disease on
transthoracic echocardiogram.  Further cardiac assessment may be
warranted should her tachycardia persist beyond this current
hospitalization.
.
8. ?Depression/Anxiety: Continued on cymbalta.
.
9. Hypothyroidism: TFTs within normal limtis. Continued on home
levothyroxine.
