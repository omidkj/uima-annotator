Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 13386**]
Chief Complaint:
Fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cervical spine fusion
IR guided PICC placement
PEG tube

History of Present Illness:
History obtained from chart and nursing as pt very demented at
baseline.
Pt is an 81 F admitted from her [**Hospital3 **] facility after
an unwitnessed fall while making her bed. Fall was heard by
co-workers her found her on the floor laying on her right arm
and bleeding from her lip. LOC unclear. At [**Location (un) 620**], her lip
laceration was sutured, a head CT was negative for bleed, CT
neck was abnormal prompting transfer for MRI c-spine and
surgical evaluation. In [**Hospital1 **] [**Name (NI) **], pt was noted to have BL UE distal
weakness, R worse than L. The MRI c-spine showed ? cervical cord
compression. Neurology was consulted and exam was consistent
with this. Pt was initially admitted to trauma surgery service
for further care.

Past Medical History:
Alzheimer's Dementia followed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 26344**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 32878**] ([**Hospital1 **])
DM2 on po meds
Hypothyroidism
HTN
OA on Motrin
Neuropathy, unclear origin
s/p L TKR x2
h/x falls

Single. Former elementary school teacher. No tob. etoh. drugs.
Has 3 sisters, none married. No kids. Pt lives at the Falls
[**Hospital3 400**] Facility [**Telephone/Fax (1) 62257**]. Per family, pt dresses
herself and feeds herself, and walks well. Meals made by home.
She is "disoriented" at baseline.

Family History:
unable to obtain. Per chart, 1 sister with MR/CP since birth,
well-controlled sz d/o

facial muscles symmetric. sensation intact.
Neuro: pt unable to cooperate with full neuro exam. DIfficulty
with sitting upright and also standing - a combination of
difficulty following commands and also weakness

Pertinent Results:
C-spine ([**Location (un) **]): ? subtle c3-c4 endplate fx.
.
CT Head ([**Location (un) **]): no acute, old infarcts, prominent ventricles.

.
MRI c-spine([**9-26**]):
1. Findings are suggestive of severe spinal stenosis with
possible cord compression at the level of C4-5 and C5-6.
2. Ligamentous injury is noted in the posterior soft tissues
along the posterior elements of the mid cervical spine.
3. Extensive prevertebral soft tissue swelling noted.
.
MRI Head [**9-26**]
1. Diffusion-weighted images demonstrate no acute infarct.

2. The ventricles are prominent, and normal pressure
hydrocephalus cannot be excluded. Please correlate clinically.
.
CT Pelvis: [**9-26**]:
There are no fractures or dislocations. Degenerative changes are
seen in both hip joints with slight loss of joint space and bony
sclerosis.
.
[**9-26**]: CXR: No acute injury
.
ECHO: [**10-6**]:
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is normal in size.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity  size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal. Resting regional wall motion
abnormalities include mid anteroseptal hypokinesis.
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**10-7**]; Upper extremity US:
 [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and color Doppler examination of the right
subclavian, axillary, brachial, basilic, and cephalic veins
demonstrates normal color flow and waveforms. The exam was
limited by patient combativity. No intraluminal thrombus is
noted.
.
[**10-11**]: CT Neck
CT OF THE NECK WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:

Visualization of fine soft tissue detail in the cervical spine,
particularly in the region of patient's fusion, is limited by
the metallic hardware producing streak artifact. The patient is
status post placement of anterior fusion plate with screws
extending into the C4, C5, and C6 vertebrae as well as C7. The
patient is status post laminectomy with multiple osseous
fragments visualized posteriorly at C4-6. There is thickening of
the prevertebral soft tissues anterior to the operative site
without evidence of large hematoma tracking within the fascial
planes of the neck. The airway appears patent. A nasopharyngeal
airway is in place. There is no pathologic-appearing
lymphadenopathy within the neck.

The visualized portions of the lung apices appear unremarkable.
There is no evidence of hematoma within the visualized portion
of the upper mediastinum.
The scout view shows an infiltrate at the left lung base.

IMPRESSION:
1. Status post laminectomy, fusion and fixation from C4-7.
Thickening of the prevertebral soft tissues in the postoperative
bed without evidence of substantial hematoma to account for a
decrease in hematocrit.
2. Postoperative changes within the neck.
3. Left lower lobe pneumonia
.
[**2151-10-17**]: RUE Ultrasound: UNILATERAL UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND:
Grayscale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 867**] was performed of the left
upper extremity brachial vein, axillary vein, and basilic vein.
The left cephalic vein was not visualized. A PICC line is seen
within the left basilic vein, with good venous flow around it,
without any evidence of intraluminal thrombus. Compressibility
and flow are demonstrated for all of the visualized veins,
without any intraluminal thrombus identified.
.
[**2151-10-17**]: CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**10-6**] and
27.

Left lower lobe consolidation has largely cleared, probably
atelectasis. Lungs are otherwise clear. Tip of the left PIC
catheter projects over the SVC. Heart size is normal. No pleural
abnormality.
.
[**2151-10-20**]: CXR: COMMENTS: Portable erect AP radiograph of the
chest is reviewed, and compared with previous study of [**10-17**], [**2150**].

The tip of the left-sided PICC line is identified in the
superior vena cava. The lungs are clear. The heart and
mediastinum are within normal limits. No pneumothorax is seen.
The patient is status post fixation of the cervical spine.

IMPRESSION: No active lung disease
