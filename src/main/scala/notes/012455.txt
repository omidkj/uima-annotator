History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 38 year old female with known ETOH cirrhosis, Child
class B to C, complicated by known esophageal varices, portal
gastropathy, portal hypertension with ascites,
splenomegaly/thrombocytopenia who was admitted to the [**Location (un) 47**]
ICU with hematemesis x 5 after report of drinking ETOH on
[**2126-8-3**]. An EGD performed 1 month prior was reported to
demonstrate severe esophagitis with flat varices. The patient
was on presentation normotensive but tachycardic with subsequent
development of hypotension requiring multiple fluid boluses and
RBC transfusions. Admission vitals at OSH were 97/56, 92, 20,
99.2, 99% on RA. The patient was started on an octreotide gtt as
well as a Protonix gtt, received 2U FFP for INR of 1.8 and
transused 2U PRBCs. Patient's Hct on admission was 30.3 and most
recently 29.9 after 10U PRBCs in total thus far. The patient on
[**2126-8-3**] underwent EGD with banding and sclerotherapy after
receiving 2U PRBCs and 1U platelets. The following day, this
a.m. the patient continued to have ongoing hematemsis with
additional observation of frank aspiration for which the patient
was intubated for airway protection. The patient received 1 dose
of Clindamycin for this event as well. The patient has since
undergone a second attempt of EGD with repeat banding and
sclerotherapy with visualization of failed bands from previous
EGD. The patient is now being transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ICU for
ongoing management and possible TIPs with IR. On transfer
patient is being maintained with IV octreotide, protonix, and
received Methylprednisolone 20mg IV x1.

Pertinent Results:
Updated [**2126-8-25**]
==============
Interventions:
==============
TIPS procedure [**2126-8-6**].
IMPRESSION:
1.  Status post successful placement of TIPS with a 10 mm x 68
mm Wallstent lining the transparenchymal tract extending from
the right hepatic vein to the right portal vein.  Post-procedure
portosystemic gradient was 5 mm.
2.  Status post exchange of right internal jugular approach
triple lumen
central venous line.
3.  No post-procedural orders written.
.
EGD:  [**2126-8-23**]
Blood in the lower third of the esophagus and gastroesophageal
junction
Blood in the fundus
Ulcer in the cardia (injection)
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum.
.
Radiology:
==========
Chest X-ray [**2126-8-5**]
CHEST:
The position of the endotracheal tube and IJ line is unchanged.
Since the prior chest x-ray there has been loss of the left
hemidiaphragm suggesting atelectasis and/or consolidation in
this region. The left costophrenic angle is not seen and there
may be also an effusion present.
IMPRESSION: Left` retrocardiac opacifications.
.
Abdominal Ultrasound [**2126-8-5**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Echogenic liver with no definite focal lesions seen.
2. Patent portal vein with hepatopetal flow.
3. Mildly distended gallbladder with gallbladder wall edema and
no gallstones demonstrated. Small pericholecystic fluid is also
seen in the presence of mild-to-moderate generalized ascites.
Gallbladder wall edema may be secondary to liver disease, and is
also demonstrated in the presence of right heart failure or
hypoproteinemic state. Correlation with LFTs and clinical exam
is recommended.
4. Approximately 2 cm focal mild bulge in the contour of the
right kidney at the interpolar region is incompletely
characterized. Correlation with other cross-sectional previous
imaging if available is recommended. If none is available,
further characterization may be performed with additional cross-
sectional imaging.
.
Abdominal Ultrasound [**2126-8-13**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Cirrhotic liver with ascites and TIPS with wall-to-wall color
flow.
2. Splenomegaly.
3. Right pleural effusion.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 38 year old female with ETOH cirrhosis with known
portal [**Hospital **] transferred from OSH MICU s/p banding and
sclerotherapy x 2, now being transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ICU for
ongoing mangement/care and planned TIPS procedure with IR.
.
#. Variceal bleed - Initially had hematemesis, pt was intubated
HD1 for airway protection, Patient had EGD with banding and
sclerotherapy x 2 on HD2;
She was transfused four units of pRBC's, four units of FFP, and
two unit of platelets, as well as being given 10mg of sc vitamin
K over the first night of admission.  On day two, her hct
remained stable throughout much of the day.   However, variceal
bleed continued, it was decided that TIPS was necessary. Pt was
transfused with FFP until INR <1.5 for TIPS. She was taken to
TIPS and transferred from ICU to Hepatorenal service after 24h
stable observation. She was stable from a GIB stand point after
a transfusion of a total of 14 U in the setting of the acute
event, but she continued to be vent dependent and was found to
have a VAP from MRSA. During her MICU course she continued to be
febrile despite negative cultures for other then sputum with
MRSA and defervesced once started on Zosyn. Subsequently she was
weaned of the vent and was successfully extubated on [**8-13**] and
then transfered to the regular floor. There the pt was continued
on Vancomycin and Zosyn for a 14 day course anmd was further
diuresed. She was doing well until the [**8-19**] when she developed
fevers of unknown origin. She had a paracentesis, a CT of the
abdomen which did not reveal any infection. She was thought to
potentially have drug fever. After completion of her antibiotic
course, the low grade fevers discontinued.  Hepatology followed
throughout hospital course.
Throughout hospital course: Hct checked q 2 hours until stable,
