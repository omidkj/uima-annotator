Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
Right ankle pain and fever.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
-Aspiration of knee fluid on [**2199-4-5**].
-Tunneled dialysis catheter placed on [**2199-4-8**].


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 67 year old woman with a past medical history
significant for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery
disease, COPD and end stage renal disease with recent initiation
of dialysis who presents with fever. Patient underwent permcath
placement on [**2199-3-25**] and while at hemodialysis on the day
of admission she was noted to have opening of the site.  The
stitches were removed.  There was erythema, and she was referred
to the [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] emergency department.  When the stitches
were replaced and in the [**Location (un) 620**] ED, she was noted to have a
temperature of 102.4, HR 130's, BP 150/70, and her oxygen
saturation was 95% on room air.  She was  mentating well.
.
In addition, the patient relates left lower extremity pain from
her big toe up through her left calf, which she states is
consistent with her gout pain. She experiences polyarticular
gout approximately once a month and believes her current gout
flare was exacerbated by a "large" shrimp dinner two nights
prior to admission.
.
Chest X-ray in the [**Location (un) 620**] ER was significant for a questionable
left lower lobe pneumonia.  Blood work revealed  bandemia, as a
result blood cultures were sent.  The patient received
vancomycin and tylenol and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER.
.
In the ED at [**Hospital1 18**], she received ceftriaxone and aspirin.  She
continued to have left foot pain.  Her temperature was 100.7.
Heart rate ranged from 111 to the 90's after receiving 500cc of
normal saline.  Her fever resolved and her blood pressure varied
between the 110's to 140's.
.
When initially evaluated on the floor, the patient reported
severe left big toe and calf pain.  Further, she endorsed some
right big toe and calf pain. The patient reports that this is
consistent with her previous gout pain, but more severe in
nature. Of note, she has not been taking colchicine lately, as
it was  discontinued on her most recent discharge from [**Location (un) 620**].
.
The patient stated she had one episode of diarrhea with her
first dialysis a few days ago.  Stool cultures were negative at
that time and she has had no diarrhea since. Otherwise, the
patient denies cough, chills, fever, shortness of breath,
abdominal pain, or dysuria.  She also reports neuropathic pins
and needles feelings in arms and legs, but states that her
neurontin was discontinued for unclear reasons.  No other
localizing complaints.  She is very upset with recent prolonged
hospital stays, need for dialysis and misses her family.

Pertinent Results:
IMAGES:
-EKG ([**2199-4-4**]): Sinus tachycardia to 105, RSRprime noted in II,
no new ST-T changes, intervals OK.
.
-Ultrasound guided catheter placement ([**2199-4-8**]):  Successful
placement of 23 cm tip-to-cuff Angiodynamics double-lumen
14.5-French hemodialysis catheter, via the left internal jugular
vein, terminating in the right atrium.  Ready for use.
.
-Chest Xray ([**2199-4-6**]):  The right central catheter has been
removed, and there is no PTX.  Subsegmental basilar atelectasis
is seen, and the right hemidiaphragm is less elevated.  There is
some blunting at the left costophrenic sulcus consistent with
some fluid.  Pulmonary vascular markings are less distended than
prior, and there are no new focal consolidations.  The heart
size is at the upper limits of normal. IMPRESSION:  Less
distension of the pulmonary vasculature; however, there is
additional left pleural fluid visualized - positioning
differences may contribute.  No new focal consolidations.
.
-Chest Xray ([**2199-4-5**]):  1.  No evidence of DVT bilaterally.  2.
4 cm cystic structure with multiple internal septations in left
popliteal
fossa, likely representing [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4675**] cyst with internal
hemorrhage.
.
-Dopplers of lower extremities ([**2199-4-5**]):  No evidence of acute
cardiopulmonary abnormalities.
