Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital course by problem:

# Dyspnea: Secondary to COPD.  No evidence of pneumonia on chest
x-ray.  Symptoms of lethargy likely the result of CO2 retention
secondary to COPD, multiple sedating psychiatric medications,
and Obstructive sleep apnea.  Patient responded to conservative
treatment for COPD, with intravenous corticosteroids,
azithromcyin for 5-day course, - cont. supplemental O2 for goal
sat 88-92%.  Viral panel was sent to exclude this as possible
aetiology of COPD flare.  Throughout MICU course, patient did
not require intubation, mechanical ventilation, or non-invasive
positive pressure ventilation.  Ipratropium was substituted for
tiotropium while in MICU and was changed back prior to
discharge.  Intravenous solumedrol was changed to prednisone
taper upon transfer to general medical floor.  Patient was
started on nicotine patch and smoking cessation was encouraged.
The patient was stable on HD 2, and likely at her respiratory
baseline on HD 3 and ready for discharge.
