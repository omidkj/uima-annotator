Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus in the LA/LAA or the RA/RAA. All four pulmonary
veins identified and enter the left atrium.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Dynamic
interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Mildly dilated LV cavity.
Moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction. Mildly depressed
LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Simple atheroma in aortic arch. Mildly dilated descending aorta.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Moderately thickened
aortic valve leaflets. No AS. Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE-revascularization:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is moderate to
severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction of the
inferior, septal and anterior walls. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. The descending
thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened with focal calcification of
left coronary cusp causing aorto sclerosis. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. There is no pericardial effusion.

Post revascularization:
Pt on phenylephrine infusion in intrinsic sinus rhythm:
1. Normal Rv function. LVEF 40%
2. No new regional wall motion abnormalites, valves as listed
pre-revascularization.
3. Thoracic aortic contour is intact

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2111-10-2**] 4:28 PM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: r/o ptx

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
61 year old man s/p cabg and ct removal
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o ptx
HISTORY: Status post CABG with chest tube removal; to assess for
pneumothorax.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**9-21**], the endotracheal
tube, Swan-Ganz catheter, and nasogastric tube have all been
removed. Left chest tube has also been removed and there is no
evidence of pneumothorax. There is probably some residual
atelectatic change at the left base as well as in the right
upper zone, both of which are decreasing.


Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to cardiac surgery. He was seen by renal to
continue his HD. He was taken to the operating room on [**10-1**]
where he underwent an OPCABG x 2. He was transferred to the ICU
in critical but stable condition. He was given vancomycin
perioperative prophylaxis as he was in house preoperatively. He
was extubated the morning of POD #1. He continued on HD postop.
He was transferred to the floor on POD #1. He was started on
renagel per renal. He did well postoperatively and was ready for
discharge to rehab on POD #4.
