Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
referred for evaluation of posterior mediastinal mass

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
T3-9 Laminectomies
Bronchial aspirate, CT-guided biopsy.


History of Present Illness:
This is a 55y.o. man with a significant smoking history and COPD
who presented to an OSH with fatigue, 40lb wt loss since [**Month (only) **],
weakness, and back pain; he was found to have a large posterior
mediastinal mass concerning for malignancy, possibly lymphoma.
Patient had failed a CT-guided biopsy in the past.
Transferred to Medicine from Thoracic service after patient
failed attempted EUS with biopsy. Main issues were pain
management and respiratory optimization; in addition, he was
extremely weak and unable to walk.

The patient's symptoms began as back pain in [**2155-5-8**] when
he was diagnosed with compression fractures of his spine after
lifting boxes. Since that time the patient has had diffuse,
vague pains in his chest, back and abdomen. More recently, over
the past 3-5 weeks the patient has developed signficant loss of
appetite and a 40 lb weight loss.

CT chest ([**2155-9-3**]):
Large heterogeneous posterior mediastinal mass, abutting the
carina from its posterior aspect, and involving the aorta and
the spine. The differential diagnosis is broad, in that the
appearance is not entirely typical for any single process. It
may represent a primary lung or esophageal cancer, or perhaps
lymphoma. Infection cannot be excluded, however, although the
bony structures appear intact, arguing again epidural abscess.
Bacterial or tuberculous infection is also possible, the latter
perhaps less likely due to the lack of evidence for it
elsewhere. Severe emphysema. Bibasilar opacities, most
suggestive of atelectasis. Probable involvement of the esophagus
by the mass. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Vague stranding about
the mesentery and pancreatic regions. This appearance is
nonspecific. It does not appear to focus distinctly on the
pancreas, but it may be helpful to correlate with pancreatic
enzymes. Multiple lower thoracic and lumbar compression
fractures.
.
CT head ([**2155-9-3**]): No evidence of acute intracranial process
.
Chest Xray ([**2155-9-3**]): Widened mediastinum, which is consistent
with the history of a mediastinal mass. Probable bibasilar
atelectasis or scarring.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 55 y.o. man with history of smoking, COPD with multiple
constitutional complaints and large posterior mediatinal mass
concerning for malignancy.
.
# mediastinal mass: highly concerning for malignancy. There was
considerable difficulty obtaining tissue for diagnosis. The
patient had a broncial aspirate which grew strep viridans and
oral flora and a CT-guided biopsy that revealed only
inflammatory cells. The patient was started on Unasyn on
[**2155-9-14**] for a planned total of 4 weeks. While awaiting
pathologic diagnosis, the patient developed acute neurologic
symptoms including a mid-thoracic sensory deficit and lower
extremity weakness. He underwent emergent multi-level thoracic
laminectomy for spinal cord decompression. Tissue from this
procedure eventually revealed myeloma. BM biopsy confirmed
multiple myeloma with a posterior mediastinal plasmacytoma. The
patient was initiated on pulse steroid therapy, decadron 40 mg
QD x4 days to be repeated for a total of 3 weeks. He developed
steroid-induced hyperglycemia for which he was covered with a
regular insulin sliding scale. The patient is to follow-up with
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of oncology for further management. Future
treatment options include thalidomide, chemotherapy and
radiation to the plasmacytoma. The patient was not started on
chemo agents due to the above described viridans superinfection.
The patient will likely not be eligible for radiation for [**3-13**]
weeks after his neurosurgical intervention.
.
# Infectious. The strep viridans from the mediastinal mass
initially raised the question as to whether this was an abscess
or a neoplasm with a superinfection. Differential diagnosis
included mediastinal abscess and/or vertebral osteomyelitis. As
noted above, he will complete a 4 week course of Unasyn via a
PICC line.
.
# Spinal cord compression. The patient developed acute
neurologic symptoms secondary to cord compression during the
course of his initial evaluation. He underwent emergent
laminectomy of multiple thoracic levels for cord compression. At
the time of discharge, the patient has persistent bilateral
lower extremity weakness worse in the proximal distribution with
a sensory deficit to the mid thoracic level. All staples have
been removed. The patient requires a wound check and
neurosurgical follow-up as scheduled within 2 weeks. The patient
is to get out of bed with the TLSO spinal brace always in place.
The patient continues to require a foley catheter due to
incontinence.
.
# Pain management. The patient had significant pain secondary to
the myeloma as well as post-operatively. He was followed by the
Chronic Pain Service. The patient had been on a dilaudid PCA
pump but was transitioned to an oral regimen. At one point he
received an intrathecal dilaudid injection with some relief; he
discussed placement of an intrathecal pump with his family but
deferred for now. At the time of discharge, he was managed with
a lidocaine patch, standing MS Contin, standing methadone and
dilaudid PO for breakthrough pain.
.
# Hypercalcemia. This was most consistent with hypercalcemia of
malignancy. This improved with IV NS and pamidronate. He should
be administered 90mg pamidronate IV q 3-4 weeks.
.
# Anemia of chronic disease. The patient received transfusions
with appropriate response and Hct stabilized.
.
# Sacral decubitus skin breakdown. The patient developed sacral
skin breakdown after developing incontinence secondary to cord
compression. He requires continued wound care.
.
# Emphysema. Stable. The patient developed a 2-3L supplemental
oxygen requirement thought secondary to baseline lung disease,
exacerbated by his posterior mediastinal mass as well as the
post-operative state. The patient received albuterol and
ipratropium nebs.
.
# Constipation. Likely secondary to high dose narcotics. The
patient requires an aggressive bowel regimen.
.
# History of compression fractures. Stable. Secondary to
underlying disease. The patient may require future
vertebroplasty for further treatment.
.
# Hypercholesterolemia. Stable. The patient was continued on his
home regimen of Vytorin.
