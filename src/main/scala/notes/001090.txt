History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 53yo female with IDDM, HTN, CAD s/p prior stents
to OM, CKD with baseline creatinine of 1.9, and COPD who
presented to OSH with foot pain, now s/p amputation of the L 4th
toe for gangrene and transferred to the MICU post-op for
hypoxemic respiratory failure.
.
The pt cut herself on the bottom of her foot 2 weeks ago. She
had pain on the dorsum of her foot for three days prior to
admission with redness and bluish discoloration of that region.
She received unasyn and vancomycin at an OSH and transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation. Her SpO2 was noted to be 92% on
RA upon transfer. Podiatry was consulted who performed beside
debridement of left fourth toe gangrene and planned for
amputation in OR on [**2186-6-24**]. Her labs were notable for a WBC of
16.4, glucose of 435 with UA showing no ketones, and creatinine
of 1.4 with sodium of 132. She was given cipro (vanc and unasyn
given at OSH). She was admitted to medicine overnight and kept
NPO and continued on vanc/cipro/flagyl.
.
She was tachypnic prior to intubation this morning with
desaturations to the 80s on RA. She was intubated and throughout
the case had desaturations to the 80s which took 10-15min to
come back up to the 90s. During weaning of sedation, she began
to cough and desaturate, and further weaning was not attempted.
Her ABG was 7.23/62/74 and temp was 38 intraoperatively. She
received a total of 600mL crystalloid during the case and was on
phenylephrine at 0.6 at time of transfer to the PACU. Her SBPs
ranged 80s-200s during the case.  Estimated blood loss was
<30cc. There was less bleeding than expected and the plan was to
consult vascular for possible further interventions. Her
Propofol was kept at 100. She received Vanc and Flagyl intra-op
and is still receiving Cipro as well. FS was in the 300s in the
PACU, and she was given 3 units of Humalog. Her last vent
settings in the PACU were AC 500/100/10/7, with overbreathing of
the vent. Last PACU vitals were 99.1, 118/48, 98, 19, 100%.
.
Of note, per her husband, in [**2185-12-17**], she was treated for
PNA, CHF, and an MI. She was in a medically-induced coma for 2
weeks at [**Hospital6 15083**] in [**Hospital1 1559**], and required HD [**1-18**]
volume overload. She is on nocturnal O2 but per report had a
negative sleep study at some point.
.
In the ICU, she is intubated and sedated.

MICROBIOLOGY:
[**6-24**] Foot wound Cx: Staph aureus coag positive, moderate growth.

IMAGING:
- [**6-24**] foot XR: Soft tissue defect about the base of the fourth
toe, but no
radiographic evidence for osteomyelitis. If clinical concern for

osteomyelitis persists, MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 500**] scan may be considered.
- [**6-24**] BL LE US: No evidence DVT in either lower extremity. Only
one posterior tibial vein seen bilaterally and one peroneal vein
seen on the right, calf vein thrombosis can therefore not be
entirely excluded
-[**6-25**] CXR: CHF with interstitial edema, probably slightly better
compared with [**2186-6-24**]. Bibasilar collapse and/or consolidation,
slightly worse compared with [**2186-6-24**].
