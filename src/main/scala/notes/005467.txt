lymphoma.  He was treated with surgery, chemotherapy and
radiation to the lower mediastinum.
2.  In [**2099-7-12**], the patient underwent an echocardiogram.
Ejection fraction at that time was 55 with plus one mitral
regurgitation.  There was a question of mobile aortic
atheroma.  Subsequent transesophageal echocardiogram revealed
some atherosclerosis in the aorta and a strand in one of the
aortic cusps of unknown significance.  The patient remained

treadmill at home to exercise and did well.

noted decrease in his exercise tolerance when using his
treadmill and he stopped exercising at that time and remained
asymptomatic.  Recently, when he was walking after eating, he
reports classical angina pressure which abated after two
minutes of rest.  He went to his primary care practitioner
[**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 2742**] of this new onset angina and was started on
aspirin and atenolol at that time.  He underwent a stress
test that was strongly positive for multi-vessel disease and
was recommended for cardiac catheterization follow-up.

chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, diabetes
mellitus, GI bleed, hepatitis, hypertension, liver failure,
prior stroke, pancreatitis.  The patient does have a history
of high cholesterol.

biventricular diastolic dysfunction, moderate pulmonary
arterial hypertension.  An intra-aortic balloon pump was
placed and the patient went for emergent coronary artery
revascularization times five with a left internal mammary
artery and a saphenous vein graft.  Please refer to the
operative report for details of surgery.

off.  On [**11-9**], the patient was extubated, beta blockade
initiated and he transferred out to the Floor on
postoperative day two.

On postoperative day three, the patient began increasing his
activity and remained hemodynamically stable.  At that time,
his epicardial wires and Foley catheter were discontinued.
Ambulation and pulmonary toilet was encouraged.  On
postoperative day five, the patient remains hemodynamically
stable.  He is ambulating successfully and able to climb a
flight of stairs and is being evaluated for discharge.

The patient is hemodynamically stable.

DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 99.5 F.; heart
