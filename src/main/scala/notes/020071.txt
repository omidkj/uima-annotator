IMAGING
CXR [**2115-4-27**]
FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to the prior study from [**2115-3-21**].

There are diffuse parenchymal opacities within the right mid and
lower lung fields as well as the left base.  The area of
consolidation in the right mid lung has increased and this can
be consistent with worsening pneumonia.  There are no
pneumothoraces or signs for overt pulmonary edema.  The heart
size is within normal limits and stable.  There is a pigtail
catheter projecting over the left upper abdomen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:  83 yo M with h/o baseline encephalopathy
(AAOx0-1) [**12-20**] basal ganglia hemorrhagic stroke, CAD, HTN,
hypothyroidism, and depression who presented from nursing home
with hypoxia.

1. Hypoxia- patient with respiratory alkalosis on ABG most
likely secondary to aspiration PNA in chronic aspirator and
given RLL involvment. He initially had 02 sats in the 80s on a
non rebreather and subsequently in the low 90s on a shovel mask
at 10L. He was treated with IV vancomycin, zosyn and
ciprofloxacin for HCAP and Aspiration PNA coverage and he
improved and was weaned to nasal cannula. He was sent to the
regular floor however he then developed hypoxia again. A chest
x-ray showed evidence of volume overload and he was diuresed
with IV lasix with improvement of his respiratory status. His
admission chest x-ray also showed a wedge shaped area in the
right middle lobe raising some concern for BOOP vs malignancy in
this chronic aspirator. It is recommended that he has repeat CXR
in 6 weeks after he has completed a course of antibiotics for
his PNA. His antibiotic coverage was narrowed to vancomycin and
zosyn and then to augmentin for a planned 8 day course. Pt also
with CT evidence on last admission of emphysematous changes
likely [**12-20**] undiagnosed COPD. He received nebulizer treatments
during his admission.
.
2. Chronic aspiration: he has had several admissions for
aspiration/PNA. His chronic aspiration is likely [**12-20**] to
neurologic sequela of his stroke. He had a speech and swallow
study confirming his aspiration status. In the future could
consider having G-tube is converted to a J tube by IR for post
pyloric feeding though it is unclear if this would decrease his
risk of aspiration.

3. ? UTI-He had a positive UA but was unabl
