Brief Hospital Course:
76 year old man with Stage IV COPD CAD s/p CABG, CHF, and dense
lower extremity paralysis secondary to epidural abscess recently
discharged from the [**Hospital1 18**] following a 3+ week admission
complicated by episodes of bradycardia and 2 episodes of
respiratory faliure and intubation, now presents from rehab with
agitation and combativeness.

# Altered mental status:/Encephalopathy Likely delerium as it
was waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] throughout admission. He was admitted from
rehab after combative behavior and intermittent confusion.  This
was thought to be related to either not wearing CPAP at night or
from infection.  He has many possible sources of infection. He
is being treated for T9 epidural abscess (below) with IV
ceftriaxone through [**7-7**].  He has a stage 3+ sacral
decubitus ulcer that is not healing well and that was debrided
during this hospitalization (below). He had a urine culture
positive for staph species.  He was also having diarrhea but c.
diff was sent and was negative.  Blood cultures were also
negative. Psych was consulted for delerium and recommended
frequent reorientation, discontinuation of seroquel, and
recommended starting haldol 1 mg IV/IM prn for agitation or
combativeness. He required several doses early in his
hospitalization, but did not requre any doses for several days
prior to discharge to rehab.

# Unstageable decubitus ulcer: Patient was seen by surgery who
took the patient to the OR on [**6-14**] for debridement of the sacral
ulcer and followed throughout the remainder of hospitalization
for regular wound checks and dressing changes.  Wound care
nurses were also involved in caring for ulcer with collagenase
ointment and regular turning given paralysis (below).  Surgery
recommended temporary diverting colostomy given chronic diarrhea
that was possibly contaminating wound.  Patient decided against
this option, but will reconsider if wound fails to heal.

# Pleural effusions in setting likely volume overload in the
setting of Chronic systolic heart failure: From prior
hospitalization. His EF was 35% per report from [**2155-6-1**].  He
was initially on furosemide 80 mg QAM and furosemide 40 mg QPM
and this was titrated down as effusions improved and he began to
develop acute kidney injury (below). He was discharged on
furosemide 40 mg QAM and this should be further titrated down if
renal function worsens.

# Epidural abscess and T9 osteomyelitis s/p debridement and
fusion: From prior hospitalization.  He was continued on
ceftriaxone 2 gm IV Q24H which he will continue through
[**2155-7-10**].  He was also continued on calcitriol, calcium
carbonate, and vitamin D.  He should have follow up scheduled
with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1352**] of orthopedics.

# History of coronary artery disease s/p CABG and [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7792**] on
previous admission. Patient was continued on aspirin,
atorvastatin, and clopidogrel.  He did experience s
