Brief Hospital Course:
69M with history significant for C5-C7 spinal injury bed bound
with trach and chronic foley who presented to OSH with altered
mental status, low urine output, hypotension, and was found to
have right and lower lobe infiltrates on CXR and development of
loculated pleural effusion, on pressure-support ventilation.
.
# Right and Middle lobe PNA: Patient with chronic trach, placed
on pressure support ventilation on admission. CXR showed absence
of right heart border and diaphragmatic border with interstitial
opacity concerning for pneumonia versus collapsed lung.  Given
pt lives at home with no recent hospitalizations he was covered
for CAP however due to history of MRSA PNA, as well ESBL UTI
empirically covered with vancomyci
