Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1990**]
Chief Complaint:
hemoptysis, hypoxic respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 83028**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old male transferred from OSH for
hypoxia and hemoptysis. PMH significant for HTN, prior MI, GERD,
pAF, severe COPD and prior asbestosis exposure with lung damage
and patient is home oxygen dependent at baseline on 1.5L NC
continuously. History limited as patient is sedated on arrival
to ICU and no family present. Per OSH notes, the patient
initially presented yesturday afternoon to OSH ED complaining of
left ankle and tibial pain and bruising after hitting his leg on
the car door. He was then d/c from ED and told to hold his usual
home Coumadin dose last night as INR was 3.7, but per reports
the patient still took usual 2.5mg daily dose. He returned to
OSH ED later in the night with hypoxia, coughing and hemoptysis.
Repeat INR then 2.7 per OSH notes after he received 2 units of
FFP at OSH.
.
He became hypoxic into the 70s on usual 1.5L and again into 70s
on NRB. He was intubated and then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for
additional workup. CK and trops at OSH negative. In ED here,
vitals were temp 98.8F, HR 65, BP 145/64, RR 18, O2 Sat 100%. he
was intubated, on AC mode, VT set 550, RR set 16, PEEP 5, FiO2
100%. He had persistent dark bloody drainage, about 20cc, from
NGT despite lavage.  GI was consulted.  Patient was given
Protonix 40 mg IV and 500mg azithromycin x1 and additional 2L NS
IVFs. CT scan of chest showed large plaques and questionable
aspiration which is what prompted azithromycin coverage.
.
Patient on Sotolol and Coumadin therapy for paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation history. He is sedated currently so PMH
confirmation is limited. Despite concern for GI bleeding vs.
hemoptysis his Hct appears stable with Hct yesturday 42, then
38--> now 36 this morning. This morning INR 2.1, PT 22.2, PTT
31.6.  On arrival to ICU he appeared sedated and in NAD with HR
60s, BP 157/68, MAP 80s, AC vent (Tv550, RR 14, PEEP 5, FiO2
100%).

NC
HTN
GERD
CAD
s/p MI
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
On coumadin for pAF


Social History:
Formerly worked in ship yard in [**Location 27256**] Navy Yard and was

ago. No ETOH or illicit drug use.  He had been living at home

present at time of admission; assumed noncontributory


Physical Exam:
GEN:intubated, sedated, in NAD
HEENT: No head/neck trauma noted, no scleral icteris, pupils
sluggish but equal and reactive ( 2mm) to light bilaterally
CVS: RRR, S1 & S2 reg, no murmurs/rubs/gallops
RESP: Bilateral rales noted at bases bilaterally and rhonchi at
upper anterior lungs
ABD: soft, nondistended, normoactive BS throughout, no whincing
or signs of pain with palpation but exam limited [**3-11**] sedation
Rectal: brown stool, no BRBPR, normal sphincter tone
NEURO: sedated, EOMI, withdraws to basic pain stimulus
SKIN: no rashes, small ecchymosis over LLE tibial region ( 2")
and at heel
EXT: left lower leg with bruising and 1+ edema, 2+ pedal pulses
bilaterally

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST OSH - Extensive bilateral pleural plaques,
and interstitial lung changes most c/w asbestosis. Marked volume
loss and architectural distortion in RUL, with rightward
tracheal deviation. Large hiatal hernia. Small centrilobular
nodules at right lung base may represent aspiration or
infection.
.
EKG: NSR, rate 60s, LAD, RBBB with LAFB, 1st degree AV
prolongation noted, V1 ST depression, no ST elevations
.
CXR: ETT properly placed, small bilateral effusions (
left>right),pleural thickening and RML fissure territory with
increased markings and questionable scarring. Overall decreased
volumes bilaterally.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Course: [**Age over 90 **] year-old male with PMH significant for HTN,
severe COPD, CAD ( s/p prior MI) who presented to OSH with
hypoxic episode with likely aspiration event in setting of
hemoptysis.  The patient was intubated at OSH and transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further workup.  After arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the pt was
noted to have increased peak pressures on the vent--suctioning
produced a large clot that was partially occluding the
endotracheal tube.  INR was noted at 2.1, coumadin held.
Subsequent bronchoscopy identified a possible bleeding source in
the posterior segment of the RUL, culture grew MSSA.  Antibiotic
coverage with Vancomycin, Azithromycin and Ceftriaxone was
selected for broad coverage of CAP, although pt was afebrile
with no leukocytosis.  Additionally, a steroid taper was started
to treat a likely COPD exacerbation.  Eight day antibiotic
course was completed.
.
Initially, the patient was bradycardic and hypotensive while
venitilated. He was given fluid boluses with minimal response.
His hypotension and bradycardia improved with decreasing
sedation and discontinuation of fentanyl.  The patient's blood
pressure then became highly labile and labetolol gtt was started
while sedation with propofol was titrated.  During this time,
the patient's respiratory failure improved and he was weaned
from the vent and extubated on [**8-10**].  Post extubation, the
patient had 1 x complaint of chest pain on [**8-11**]--CK and troponins
were negative, no changes on EKG, ASA held due to concern for
bleeding.  Additionally, he had 1 x bloody return on suction
that prompted team to revers his INR with FFP and vitamin K.
Prior to transfer to the floor, labetolol gtt was discontinued
and PO captopril and labetolol were started.  While in the unit,
The patient recieved total 1 unit PRBCs and 4 FFP.  Hematocrit
was monitored and stable post transfusion through to end of [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
stay.  On transfer to floor, pt was stable, saturating 88-95% on
4L O2NC.  This was considered baseline for patient secondary to
severe underlying pulmonary status.
.

The above represents the ICU course, and was written by the ICU
physicians.  The following represents the medical [**Hospital1 **] course
and was written by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]:

Pt. stable on arrival to floor.  Foley removed, voided clean
yellow urine, no hematuria seen.  Pt. had slight pink
discoloration of sputum on one occasion, but no overt
hemoptysis.  Pt. was discharged to rehab hospital with the
instructions below.
