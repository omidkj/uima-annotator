CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIAL W/O CONTRAST Study Date of
[**2149-10-2**] 5:07 AM
Fractured right mandibular ramus with adjacent bullet and bone
fragments as above. Also notable is a comminuted fracture of the
right aspect
of the anterior tubercle of C1.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Trauma Service from NH after an
apparent self inflicted GSW. Upon admission he didn't show any
neurologic deficits.  A CT of his head showed a minimally
displaced fracture of C1. Ortopedics were consulted and patient
was placed into a cervical-spine collar.  The patient was
evaluated by the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery service, who
found that his  mandible injury doesn't require any surgical
intervention. Due to an increased swelling to his neck and
better breathing assistance, the patient was trached on
[**2149-10-6**]. His pain was controlled well by PCA. Speech and
swallow testing was performed and the patients diet was advanced
from thick liquids to a soft diet.
Upon discharge the patient is tolerating a  pureed diet and thin
liquids well.
He is instructed to keep his follow up appointments with Trauma
Service, Orthopedics and ENT in the next weeks.
