CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT Study Date of [**2123-2-23**] 12:20 PM
The ET tube tip is 5 cm above the carina. The right internal
jugular line tip is most likely at the junction of the right
internal jugular vein and
subclavian vein. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
Interval
development of mild vascular engorgement as well as new right
lower lobe
consolidation accompanied by right pleural effusion are noted
that might
represent aspiration or atelectasis and pleural effusion.
Infectious process cannot be excluded. The NG tube tip is in the
stomach. The orthopedic hardware in cervical spine is unchanged.


CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2123-2-24**] 6:30 PM
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring
and support devices are in unchanged positions. The
intrathoracic volumes have slightly decreased, as a consequence
the size of the cardiac silhouette has increased.  The extent of
the right-sided pleural effusion is unchanged. There is
unchanged hypoventilation at the right lung base. The lung
parenchyma shows no evidence of newly appeared focal parenchymal
opacity suggestive of pneumonia.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.


CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT Study Date of [**2123-3-2**] 9:31 AM
New right PICC terminates in the lower SVC in good
position. No pneumothorax. Left subclavian central venous
catheter is
unchanged with tip in the SVC. There has been improvement in
airspace opacity of the right lung base seen on [**2123-2-26**]. No appreciable pleural fluid.
