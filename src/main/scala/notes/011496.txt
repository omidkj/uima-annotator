ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:  Status post Ivor-[**Doctor Last Name **]
esophagogastrectomy complicated by anastomotic leak.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Anastomotic leak.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60-year-old
male who underwent Ivor-[**Doctor Last Name **] esophagogastrectomy at
[**Hospital3 **] on [**2155-6-20**] for a Barrett's esophagus
transformed into adenocarcinoma.  He underwent an
uncomplicated procedure and was noted to have a cirrhotic
liver in the OR.  He was transferred to the floor and
continued to do well.  He had a normal barium swallow on
postoperative day #5 and was begun on po.  On postoperative
day #6 he developed a fever to 101.4 and subsequent
respiratory distress requiring intubation.  At this point he
was started on Vancomycin/Cipro/Flagyl.  Chest CT with
Methylene Blue via chest tube showed a mediastinal leak.  On
postoperative day #7 he was hypotensive, a right PA catheter
was placed and he was ruled out for MI.  He had a sputum
positive for MRSA.  On postoperative day #10 repeat CT scan
showed gross extravasation of contrast with apparent
anastomotic collection and a large right pleural effusion.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for further care.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes mellitus, Barrett's
esophagus, esophageal adenocarcinoma, villous pemphigoid,
history of GI bleed, iron deficiency anemia, history of
urinary incontinence.

ALLERGIES:  None known.

MEDICATIONS:  On admission Heparin subcu, Protonix 40 mg q d,
Combivent MDI, Morphine 2-4 mg q 6 hours prn, Ativan .5 mg q
6 hours prn, Lisinopril 20 mg q d, Ciprofloxacin 200 mg q 12
hours, Vancomycin 1 gm q 18 hours, Flagyl 500 mg q 8 hours,
Regular insulin sliding scale.  The patient was transferred
intubated and sedated.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white cell count 10.9,
hematocrit 25.8, platelet count 230,000, sodium 144,
potassium 4.6, chloride 109, CO2 25, BUN 44, creatinine 1.7.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] intubated and sedated for further
management of this complication.  He underwent a CT of the
chest and a CT fluoroscopy guided NG tube placement.  On CT
chest the findings were a right lower lobe collapse, two
small anastomotic leaks decompressed by chest tube.  At this
point Fluconazole was added to his antibiotic coverage.  He
also underwent a bronchoscopy which showed mucus plugs and
was otherwise normal.  He was noted to have elevated LFTs on
the initial lab work with a total bilirubin of 11.9 and also
raised BUN and creatinine.  He continued to be ventilated.
On [**7-2**] he was weaned from assist control ventilation to
C-PAP.  His sedation was slowly weaned off.  Tube feeding was
started.  He also underwent a right upper quadrant ultrasound
which showed minimal edema in the gallbladder wall and a
small amount of fluid around the gallbladder consistent with
ascites.  There was no evidence of gallstones, biliary
dilation or hepatic parenchymal abnormality.  He continued to
be stable over the next couple of days.  On [**7-3**] he was noted
to have increased respiratory secretions requiring Ambu
bagging, lavage and suctioning.  He was tachypneic and
hypotensive.  On [**7-4**] it was noted that he spiked a fever to
101.6.  He was pancultured.  At this point he was switched
back to pressure support ventilation and his antibiotics were
changed to Vancomycin, Piperacillin and Fluconazole.  His
central line was changed.  He underwent another chest CT at
this time which showed a small amount of fluid at the area of
the previously seen anastomotic leak.  There was no abscess
noted.  The CT also showed persistent ground glass opacities
scattered throughout both lungs.  The right lower lobe
remained opacified.  Underlying pneumonia could not be
excluded.  His bilateral effusions had improved somewhat on
the CT.  Over the course of [**7-4**] and [**7-5**] he was weaned
slowly to C-PAP, his low grade temperature continued.  His
total bilirubin had gone down to 10 and the creatinine was
1.4 and urea 27.  He continued to improve over the day.  On
[**7-6**] he was extubated.  Post extubation he was noted to be
tachypneic with a respiratory rate between 28 and 45.  He had
a weak cough and he was wheezing which improved with
treatment.  He was also noted to have diarrhea.  On [**7-7**] his
right chest tube was accidentally pulled and it was replaced
under sterile condition.  He tolerated it well.  He continued
to have diarrhea and his fluid was sent for C. diff.  Flagyl
was started at this point and he continued to progressively
improve over the course of the next few days.  He required
intensive respiratory care with chest PT and suctioning.  On
[**7-10**] due to persistent tachypnea and difficulty handling
secretions, a pulmonary consult was obtained.  It was noted
by them that he had many reasons for tachypnea, mainly his
pain, stomach and right chest, thoracotomy, right lower lobe
consolidation.  He was clinically improving though, and the
advice from the pulmonary team was to continue antibiotics
and adequate hydration.  He was deemed ready to transfer to
the regular floor on [**7-10**].  On the early morning of [**7-11**] he
had an episode of tachypnea and he was agitated.  He was
treated with nebulizers and he improved slightly.  He
continued to be stable during the day but had high nursing
requirements with frequent respiratory care requirements.  On
early morning of [**7-12**] he was noted to be again tachycardic
and hypotensive.  At this point he received Ativan, Haldol,
Morphine.  On the morning of [**7-12**] it was noted that he was
somnolent and his chest exam showed he was wheezing.  At this
point he was transferred to the SICU for more intensive
nursing management.  He also underwent a CT angiogram to rule
out PE and contrast was given to evaluate for a leak.  There
was no evidence of PE, there was no evidence of leak from the
esophagus.  The CT also showed small bilateral pleural
effusions with a loculated component at the right upper lobe
posteriorly.  There was no evidence of pneumothorax.  There
was a probable post inflammatory nodule at the left apex and
there was a right lower lobe collapse.  After the CT, his NG
tube was discontinued.  He continued to be stable though he
had episodes of respiratory distress which improved with
treatment.  On [**7-14**] an ENT consult was obtained for
possibility of tracheomalacia or upper airway obstruction.  A
laryngoscopy at this time revealed no evidence of upper
airway obstruction.  His chest tube was placed on water seal.
On [**7-15**] the right chest tube was removed.  As he continued to
be clinically stable he was transferred to the floor.  On the
floor his requirements have been mainly chest PT.  He has
been ambulating.  His Foley was discontinued on [**7-17**] and he
had no difficulty voiding urine.  Rehabilitation services
have been solicited and he is awaiting transfer to a rehab
unit.
