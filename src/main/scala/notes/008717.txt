Allergies:
Formaldehyde

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1943**]
Chief Complaint:
Nausea, vomiting, fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
J-tube advancement under IR

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 54 year-old man with a history of SCC of the
tongue, s/p chemo, undergoing XRT, recent admission for
difficulty handling secretions, who p/w fever, N/V, and L rib
pain.  His wife called his oncologist today with complaints of
n/v and inability to tolerate POs and GTube feeds.  The VNA
reportedly felt he was dehydrated, so he was brought to the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED.  He reports that his n/v is directly related to his
innability to handle the volume of his tube feeds.  There is a
plan in place to advance his Gtube into his jejunum in 4 days.
There has been no change in his n/v, but notes that he is not
receiving much of his tube feeds.

The main reason he presented was for the acute onset of left
sided pleuritic chest pain yesterday.  He is unsure if it is
exertional, but he denies radiation and reports it is unlike
cardiac chest pain he has had in the past.  He denies SOB,
palpitations.   He reports about a week of fevers/chills.  No
temperature has been taken since his discharge.  He has chronic
copious secretions related to his SCC and XRT and over 1 month
of dysuria, but he denies diarrhea or focal skin infections.

In the emergency department
136/75  20  97.8 initially.  CXR showed possible pna, so he was
given cefepime 2g IV and levofloxacin 750mg IV, dilaudid, and
zofran as well as 3L IVF.  Negative KUB for obstruction.  He was
about to be admitted to the OMED, but he developed tachypnea,
tachycardia, and fever to 101.  CTA showed multiple
subsegemental PE and large LLL PE and an opacity in the RLL and
LLL possibly infarct vs pna.  Heparin drip was started.  Guaiac
negative.  Head CT upon arrival.

Latest VSS prior to transfer: P 113, BP 122/72  RR 16  O2 94% on
4L.

Past Medical History:
Past Oncologic History:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented with difficulty swallowing pills for
alopecia in late [**Month (only) 216**], then developed throat irritation, which
was felt like "sticks" in his throat. He was evaluated by his
primary care doctor who noted that his left tonsil was inflamed
and he was treated with amoxicillin, then Cipro, and then
acyclovir with gradual improvement. Although the inflammation of
his tonsil had resolved, he still noted a similar throat
discomfort. This prompted a CT scan of his neck, which was
performed on [**9-13**] and this showed a 2.4 x 2.4 x 1.6 cm right
base of tongue enhancing mass as well as a 4.5 x 3.3 x 2.5 cm
left thyroid mass. He then underwent an FNA of his thyroid with
cytology being nondiagnostic and this was again repeated under
ultrasound guidance on [**10-2**] and the results from cytology were
suboptimal cellularity, but features suggestive of a
microfollicular lesion. He also underwent an endoscopy under
anesthesia performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1837**] on [**9-22**] at which time
a biopsy of the right base of tongue mass showed squamous cell
carcinoma with foci highly suspicious for invasion. The PET scan
was performed on [**10-3**] and shows roughly 1.7 x 1.2 cm mass in
the right base of tongue with increased FDG avidity with an SUV
max of 11. There was also a cyst asymmetrically increased FDG
avidity involving the left greater than right of palatine
tonsil. There were several left-sided station to lymph nodes
that were subcentimeter in size. None of these demonstrated FDG
avidity above baseline pool. The large left-sided thyroid
nodule, which is measured at 2.8 x 2.3 mm, did not demonstrate
any increased FDG avidity. He commenced concomitant radiation
therapy with weekly paclitaxel (30 mg/m2) and carboplatin (1.5
AUC) on [**10-22**].

Other Past Medical History:
1. Squamous cell carcinoma as noted above.
2. Coronary artery disease status post an MI with two stents
placed several years ago. He had an episode of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation, but has essentially maintained a regular rhythm
and is not on any anticoagulation.
3. Hypercholesterolemia.
4. "Vasculitis" which was diagnosed apparently on a biopsy at an
outside institution.
5. Guillain-[**Location (un) **] syndrome.

Past Surgical History:
1. s/p ORIF R leg fracture
2. s/p L knee menisal repair
3. s/p L partial testical resection for benign tumor
4. s/p L4-L5 disc operation x 2

Social History:
Social History (confirmed with patient): The patient is married
and lives with his wife. [**Name (NI) **] formally worked in the electronics
industry. He is a former smoker, but quit over 25 years ago and
had a lifetime pack year history of less than 10. He has had an
inhalation exposure to PVC and glue in the early 80s, which led
to acute irritation of his upper airway esophagus and stomach.
He does not drink alcohol

Family History:
Family History (per recent OMR note): His mother died at age 88.
His father died at age 66 from complications of coronary artery
disease. He is an only child. He has three children aged 28, 27,
and 22, whom he is estranged from and does not regularly see.

IMAGING:
CXR: Low lung volumes with hazy retrocardiac opacity.
Atelectasis favored,
however, pneumonia cannot be excluded. A lateral view of the
chest may be
helpful for further characterization.

CTA: 1. Multiple segmental and subsegmental PEs, as described
above. There is also a larger lobar pulmonary embolus in the
left lower lobar pulmonary
artery.
2. Scattered ground-glass nodular consolidations throughout the
basilar part of the left lower lobe, most likely associated with
abnormal perfusion given the presence of a large essentially
occlusive pulmonary embolism serving this area. Less likely
considerations are an additional inflammatory or infectious
process. Chest CT surveillance is suggest in three months to
show resolution, particularly given the history of malignancy.
However, these nodules are not suggestive of metastases.
3. Small hypodense renal lesions, probably cysts, but not
entirely
characterized. Confirmation with ultrasound is recommended.

KUB: There is a G-tube balloon projecting over the left upper
abdomen.
The bowel gas pattern is nonspecific with air and stool seen
throughout colon. No dilated loops of small bowel is identified.
There are some degenerative changes of the lumbar spine.

CT HEAD: No acute intracranial process identified.

TTE:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>5
