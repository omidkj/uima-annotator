History of Present Illness:
71 year old female with a history of PVD s/p multiple
interventions, multiple recent hospitalizations (see summary
below) most recently with a liver abscesss presents with
hypotension. She had been discharged [**2-10**] feeling mildly
fatigued but able to ambulate around her home. Over the next
several days, she became progressively more fatigued with nausea
and vomiting. On the morning of admission, she was unable to get
up off her chair -> [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) **] and subsequently transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**].

In the ED, her vitals were T 99.3, P 123, BP 86/p. 97 3L. She
was started on levophed. Left CVL placed under sterile
conditions. She underwent a RUQ US and CT abdomen and received
vancomycin and levofloxacin. She was then admitted to the
medical ICU for further management. At time of admission, she
noted mild shortness of breath. She denied CP, HA, nausea,
abdominal pain, or urinary symptoms.

Of note, the patient has had several recent hospitalizations,
which are sumarized below:
[**1-11**] - [**1-19**]: Admission at NEBH for pneumonia with pleuritis and
severe pleurodynia. She had an abdominal US at that time which
showed a normal liver.
[**2-3**] - [**2-10**]: Admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] after [**Doctor First Name **] outpatient CT scan
obtained to evaluate new RUQ pain revealeda 6.3 cm subcapsular
liver abscess. IR performed a CT-guided drainage (sterile
culture). Urine culture grew VRE (not treated). She was
discharged on levofloxacin and metronidazole.
[**2-10**]: CT abdmoen showed decrease of the abscess and pigtail was
removed (no longer draining).

Radiology
Cxr on admission [**2147-2-13**]:
The newly inserted right subclavian CV line has its tip within
the right
atrium.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  Mild pulmonary vascular
prominence is noted.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are
unchanged.  No evidence of pneumothorax or consolidation is
noted.  Dense opacification at the right lung base most likely
represents a reactive subpulmonic effusion secondary to hepatic
fluid collection.

CT Abd/Pelvis [**2147-2-14**]:
Interval removal of pigtail catheter with only small residual
rim of fluid
noted in the perihepatic space under the diaphragm by the dome
of the liver. Findings highly consistent with infarction of the
right kidney.  The edematous kidney with adjacent perinephric
stranding are highly suggestive of relatively acute onset.
Diagnostic considerations include arterial dissection/thrombosis
versus renal vein thrombosis.  No bowel pathology with no free
intraperitoneal fluid or air noted.

Echo [**2147-2-14**]:
The left ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline
dilated. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis
(ejection fraction 20 percent). No masses or thrombi are seen in
the left ventricle. Right ventricular systolic function appears
depressed.  Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Echo [**2147-2-16**]:
Compared with the prior study of [**2147-2-14**], estimated pulmonary
artery sysotlic pressure is now higher and mitral regurgitation
is now more prominent. Left ventricular systolic function
appears similar.

Renal U/S [**2147-2-16**]:
The right kidney measures 10.1 cm. Several attempts at Doppler
evaluation of the right kidney demonstrate only venous flow.  No
arterial waveforms could be obtained. The left kidney measures
11.4 cm.  Doppler evaluation of the left kidney was extremely
limited as well, due to the patient's inability to hold her
breath and difficulty with positioning.  Venous flow is noted on
the left.

Cxr [**2147-2-20**]:
Mild pulmonary edema continues to improve and bilateral pleural
effusion,
moderate on the right and small on the left are also slightly
smaller.  New nasogastric feeding tube with a wire stylet in
place is looped in the stomach. Tip of the right subclavian line
projects over the superior cavoatrial junction.  Mild
cardiomegaly, decreased since [**2-17**].

Brief Hospital Course:
71 year old female with recent UTI and liver abscess presents
with hypotension.

The patient was admitted to the medical ICU on broad-spectrum
antibiotics/pressors with a concern for septic shock, given
multiple recent infections. The source of infection was unclear
([**Name2 (NI) **] cultures negative, urine culture with only 10-100k yeast,
chest X-ray without clear infiltrate, nearly completely resolved
liver abscess) On [**2147-2-14**], she developed respiratory distress
requiring intubation (attributed to flash pulmonary edema) and
SVT requiring cardioversion X 2 (unsuccessful).  An
echocardiogram was obtained, which revealed EF 20% with global
hypokinesis, suggesting that cardiogenic shock may have been
contributing to her presenting hypotension, possibly related to
known severe acidosis. Given negative CKMB fraction (TnT peak
0.39), ACS was felt to be unlikely. The patient subsequently
developed acute renal failure (creatinine rising to 6.4), which
was felt to be secondary to ischemic ATN (muddy brown casts on
urinary sediment). The renal consult team was consulted, but,
given the patient's multiple comorbidities, poor prognosis for
renal recovery, and her desire to avoid long-term life support,
dialysis was not pursued. The patient's mental status gradually
worsened and she became progressively coagulopathic (INR
1.7-1.9), possibly related to shock liver. With diuresis, the
patient's pulmonary status improved and she was extubated in the
ICU. A family meeting was held, attended by the critical care
and renal consult teams.  Given the poor prognosis regarding
recovery of renal function as outlined by the renal team, the
pt's wishes not to be on long term dialysis, her multiple
comorbidities, and her rapidly declining clinical status, the
patient's husband and daughter decided to pursue
comfort-oriented care. She was transferred to the general
medical floor on a morphine drip and passed away on [**2147-2-
