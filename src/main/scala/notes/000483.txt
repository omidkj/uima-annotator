Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**]
Chief Complaint:
cardiac arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ICD placement
cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
58yo M s/p AVR ([**2165**]) on Coumadin, DM2, hyperlipidemia,
presented to OSH s/p cardiac arrest at home. At OSH, found to be
in CHB and is s/p temporary pacing wire placement. According to
wife, patient has had progressive DOE over the past few weeks.
He has also had increased LE edema recently. No known complaints
of chest pain. He returned home after coaching a baseball game
today and collapsed. He was found to be pulseless. A neighbor
who is an [**Name (NI) 9168**] was called, and began administering CPR. EMS
arrived ~15min later and found pt to be in VF. One shock was
administered and he returned to sinus rhythm. He was nasally
intubated in the field. En route, he was found to be
progressively bradycardic, and his rhythm was c/w CHB. He was
taken to [**Hospital 487**] Hospital and a temporary pacing wire was
placed through the R IJ (apparently done under unsterile
conditions). He was changed to oral intubation. He received IV
metoprolol, NTG gtt, atropine, and Versed. Bedside TTE showed EF
30-35% with anterio AK, 2+ TR, 2+ MR. CK was 337 with negative
troponin T. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

.
On presentation to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, he was intubated and sedated,
with the temporary pacer appropriately capturing. He was
minimally responsive, on sedation, on admission. he was given
gentamicin, metronidazole, and cefazolin for his unsterile pacer
wire. Head CT was done to r/o bleed [**1-14**] fall and
anticoagulation. He was admitted to the CCU for further
monitoring.

.
OSH ECG: AV dissociation, RBBB, left axis deviation
ECG s/p temp pacer: paced at 60bpm, native p waves not
conducting, LBBB appearance to QRS
.
CXR: The tip of the right jugular temporary pacer is not clearly

identified. There is mild congestive heart failure with
cardiomegaly. Note is made of opacity in the left lower lobe
indicating aspiration. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
.
CT head: no ICH, ethmoid sinusitis, no fracture
.
TTE ([**1-17**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly
dilated. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. A
bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
transaortic gradient is normal for this prosthesis. The aortic
prosthesis leaflets are not well seen. Mild to moderate valvular
([**12-14**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. No paravalvular leak is

Brief Hospital Course:
.
# Cardiac arrest: On admission, it was reported that he had a VF
arrest by EMS, and converted with 1 shock in the field.  EP,
however, felt his cardiac arrest was more likely secondary to
polymorphic VT as a result of his prolonged QT and complete
heart block.  He had no CAD on cath so it was likely not
ischemic in etiology.  Despite the suspicion for polymorphic VT,
EP felt primary VF could not be ruled out, so an ICD was placed
on [**3-12**].
.
# Complete heart block:  He had a temporary pacing wire placed
at the outside hospital, and was V-paced at 60bpm.  His native
heart rate was less than 30.  The etiology of his complete heart
block was thought to be secondary to degenerative conduction
disease, as he seems to have had progressive conduction
abnormalities per past EKGs.  Viral myocarditis was also
considered a possibility as his family gave a history of
flu-like symptoms a few days before his cardiac arrest.  His TSH
was normal and his cath was clean.  A dual chamber ICD was
placed on [**3-12**].  He was maintained on a beta blocker for rate
control as his rate was in the 90s after his dual chamber ICD
was placed.  He developed a hematoma from his ICD site,
involving his left shoulder and inner arm.  His heparin drip was
discontinued, and his hematoma resolved into an ecchymosis that
has been stable.  He has an appointment in device clinic for
interrogation of his ICD the day after discharge.  He will
follow up this and his other cardiac issues with his
cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 120**].
.
# AVR: He is on Coumadin as an inpatient for his mechanical
aortic valve.  He received vitamin K 5mg po on [**3-9**] to reverse
his INR in preparation for his ICD placement.  IV heparin was
restarted s/p ICD placement.  His mechanical aortic valve was
found to be functioning well on TTE.  He was restarted on
Coumadin, and his INR was therapeutic for a few days before
admission.  He was discharged on Coumadin 5mg po daily with the
plan to get her INR checked 4 days after discharge.  He will
resume management of his anticoagulation with his PCP.
.
# Anoxic encephalopathy:  According to the family, there was an
approximate 5-minute lapse between his collapse at home and
initiation of CPR.  He was initially minimally responsive when
intubated, even with lightening of sedation.  His CT head showed
no intracranial hemorrhage.  Fortunately, he began to recover
some cortical function within 48 hours of his cardiac arrest,
and began to follow commands.  Upon extubation and
discontinuation of his sedation, he was disoriented and became
agitated, responding well to olanzapine.  He was maintained on
olanzapine for a couple of days, and his agitation resolved.  He
also seemed to have some motor difficulty with impaired hand-eye
coordination, as well as some short-term memory deficit.  His
cognitive and motor deficits are likely due to anoxic
encephalopathy.  He has experienced rapid improvement while in
the hospital.  He was evaluated by Occupational Therapy and
Physical Therapy, and felt to be safe to be discharged home.  He
will follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of Behavioral
Neurology in 6 weeks for reassessment.
.
# Respiratory status:  He was initially intubated for airway
protection during cardiac arrest.  He had mild pulmonary edema
on chest x-ray, for which he received IV Lasix for diuresis.  He
was weaned from the ventilator over the next couple of days, and
was e
