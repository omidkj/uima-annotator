Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Dysphagia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD

History of Present Illness:
70yoF with h/o CKD stage III, HTN, COPD no home O2, and recent
complicated CCU admission for NSTEMI (see below) who is admitted
to MICU with dysphagia and inability to get food/drinks PO.

After that admission, she was sent to rehab and was discharged
from there [**7-20**]. She saw [**Name8 (MD) **] NP[**Company 2316**] on [**7-21**] and reported
weakness that she related to being in a rehab for a long time,
but no other worrisome symptoms. However EKG done in the office
was apparently concerning for hyperkalemia or ischemic process,
so she was sent to the ED where she ended up getting 2 sets of
negative cardiac enzymes. Cards was consulted and did not feel
the changes represented ischemia. Of note, neither the office
EKG nor any of the EKG's done in the ED are in OMR or in the
scanned inpatient records for comparison to our MICU admission
EKG, which has grossly peaked T waves. However, a single line in
the ED attending note mentions "possible hyperacute T's." K's
were 4.3 and 4.9 in the ED.

Regardless, in the ED she ate some chicken and reports it
"didn't go through" and everything she has eaten or drank since
then doesn't go through either; she denies odynophagia, only
endorses dysphagia. She has even had difficulty getting melted
ice cream down. She has been spitting up everything she's tried
to eat, but denies gross nausea or vomiting. She went back to
the ED for these symptoms.

In the ED: 99  99  138/75  18  100%. No SOB/CP, no resp
distress. She was seen to be spitting oral secretions into a
cup. She was given Glucagon 1mg IV x2 and 4mg IV Zofran x2. She
is admitted to MICU for EGD.

Vitals before admission: 97.8  99  150/77  18  97%RA.

Of note, pt was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**7-2**] to [**7-10**] for n/v and
found to have NSTEMI with hypoxia and tachycardia. She was
admitted to CCU with STD in V3-5 concerning for anteroseptal MI,
with Trop peak 2.27. With resolution of these changes, she then
had PR depressions in inferior leads concerning for RV infarct.
Medically managed: Plavix loaded, given ASA, Heparin gtt,
Metoprolol, Simva changed to Atorva 80, Lisinopril held due to
some hypoTN and poor renal function; no cath due to respiratory
distress thought to be HF +/- PNA and persistent tachycardia
felt to be a stress test equivalent. She was also hypoxic and
with pulmonary edema thought to be NSTEMI vs COPD vs PNA (?
aspiration) - given nebs, initially given Prednisone but
stopped, diuresed with Lasix, completed course of
Vanc/Cefepime/Azithro. She had episodes of AFib that responded
to Ibutilide and Metoprolol; was not anticoagulated given Hct
drop and guaic positive stools, but was on ASA/Plavix. UCx
showed >100k vanc sensitive enterococcus, was already on Vanc
for PNA. Some hypoTN during admission, so home Nifedipine and
Clonidine were held; Metoprolol was continued, Lisinopril was
recommended but not started until f/u if Cr <1.5.

Before that, pt was admitted [**6-27**] to [**6-29**] for ARF in the setting
of infectious colitis treated with Flagyl and Moxifloxacin with
improvement of Cr with IVF's. Presently, she says all the
symptoms present during these 2 admissions are resolved

Review of systems:
Per HPI, otherwise negative for f/c/ns, pain, SOB, CP,
palpitations, nausea, abdominal pain, BM changes, dysuria or
urinary problems, vision changes, [**Name (NI) 4459**] problems, skin changes.
She endorses occasinal GERD when she eats spicy food, which is
worse with laying down, occurs a couple times per week. She's
also had a cough for the past month that started after a cough
and productive of thin phlegm; she denies any known history of
aspiration or postnasal gtt.
ROS otherwise negative

CXR FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
There is no definite radiopaque foreign body seen within the
chest. A radiodense structure in the soft tissues of the left
neck could represent the patient's earring and was seen on the
prior exam dated [**2119-7-7**]. The lungs are well expanded bilaterally
without signs of aspiration or pneumonia. No pleural effusion or
pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal.
Overlying EKG leads are noted, somewhat limiting the evaluation.
The lungs are hyperinflated with flattened diaphragms suggestive
of underlying COPD. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Bony
structures are intact. Clips are noted in the right upper
quadrant.
IMPRESSION: COPD, no signs of foreign body.

EKG:  NSR normal axis, 85 bpm, early RWP in V2, possible Q in
III, with very prominent T waves diffusely, and J point
elevation V2-6. Last OMR EKG of comparision [**7-7**] has T wave
peaking but not as prominently, and there is no J point
elevation. However, OMR ED notes indicate that pt was having J
point elevation and TW peaking in the ED yesterday.


Brief Hospital Course:
70yoF with h/o CKD stage III, HTN, COPD no home O2, and recent
complicated CCU admission for NSTEMI (see below) who is admitted
to MICU with dysphagia and inability to get food/drinks PO and
found on EGD to have large hiatal hernia and chicken impaction
in her esophagus requiring ICU admission for removal of food
particle.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Chicken impaction: GI performed EGD on patient and were able
to remove some of the obstruction and push the remaining portion
into stomach. Per GI, likely precipitating factor was large
hiatal hernia and tortuous esophagus. Patient able to s Pt was
counseled appropriately and will follow up GI in 1 month. On
EGD, patient was also noted to have gastritis and was
subsequently placed on protonix [**Hospital1 **]. Patient was advised to
remain this medication until she is seen by GI in 1 month.

# Peaked T waves: These were reportedly also seen in the office
and ED on day prior to admission. Subsequent 2 sets of cardiac
enzymes which were negative. Additionally patient was not
hyperkalemic. Cards saw patient and did not think this to be
ischemic, and she was discharged from ED. Patient on this
admission also had hyperacute T waves with normal cardiac
enzyme. Repeat EKG was normal. No further intervention was
necessary. Patient to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in near future.

INACTIVE ISSUES: No changes in medications or interventions were
necessary.
- CAD
- COPD
- Osteoporosis
- Depression

Medications on Admission:
1. alendronate 70 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a week.

2. amitriptyline 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.

3. metoprolol
