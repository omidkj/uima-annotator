Chief Complaint:
Pneumonia

None

History of Present Illness:
73 yo M with ILD, OSA, presents from Siani with question of
repeat PNA in the setting of rapidly progressing interstitial
lung disease.  Patient was discharged from the [**Hospital Ward Name **]
[**2168-5-28**] to [**Location (un) 511**] Siani following a long hospital course.
Briefly, patient was admitted to the VA [**2168-4-18**] for respiratory
distress, intubated [**2168-4-20**] and brought to the [**Hospital1 **] for a second
opinion on [**2168-5-9**].  He was found to have rapidly progressing
interstitial lung disease and underwent tracheostomy placement
[**2168-5-13**].  Course was complicated by bacterimia and he was
treated for a MDR klebsiella VAP with cefepime until [**6-2**] and
vancomycin until [**2168-5-30**].  While at rehab, patient was treated
for cdiff colitis.

Per report, patient has been declining since weekend with
increased secretions and increased respiratory rate.  [**6-13**]
patient was found to have saturations in the 80s on vent,
breathing 30-40/min.  Per EMS he improved slightly after being
taken off the vent and bagged while en route.

In the ED initial vitals at 16:10 98.2 114 113/65 36 99%.
Respiratory rate remained in the 40s, pulling large tidal
volumes, currently denies any pain or shortness of breath.
Lowest reported blood pressure in the ED was 90/45, which
recovered with 1L NS.  Patient's highest temperature was 99.9.
CXR prelminary demonstrated new left-sided consolidation and
baseline interstitial lung disease.  Patient was given 2g IV
cefepime, 1g vancomycin and 750mg levofloxacin.  He was also
given 1g acetaminophen.

On arrival to the MICU, patient is still tachypnic with tidal
volumes in the 25L/min range.  He denies any chest pain and is
in no acute distress.  He states that at baseline he coughs
frequently, although denies any aspiration events.  Patient is
extremely hard of hearing at baseline and is unable to
communicate well unless by lipreading.

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or
weakness. Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation,
abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits. Denies dysuria,

ECG
Baseline artifact. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
rate and
multifocal ventricular premature contractions. Left axis
deviation with left anterior fascicular block. Generally poor R
wave progression suggests prior anterior myocardial infarction.
Diffuse repolarization abnormalities in the limb leads. Compared
to the previous tracing of [**2168-5-19**] the rate is much faster and
now tachycardic. Ventricular ectopy is new. Depolarization and
repolarization abnormalities are similar.

CXR: [**2168-6-13**]
FINDINGS:  The patient is status post tracheostomy, which
appears unchanged.
A PICC line terminates in the superior vena cava, as before,
inserted via
right-sided approach.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
contours appear
unchanged including widening of the vascular pedicle, perihilar
fullness, and cardiomegaly.  A moderate-to-severe interstitial
abnormality suggests known interstitial lung disease without
significant change.  This appearance includes confluent
opacification at the lung bases.  Because of severe background
lung abnormality, it is difficult to exclude a superimposed
edema or pneumonia.

IMPRESSION: Similar severe widespread predominantly interstitial

opacification, most confluent at the lung bases; although there
is no definite change, subtle superimposed process could be
readily obscured by a severe background abnormality.

CXR: [**2168-6-14**]
FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change.  Low lung volumes with massive bilateral diffusely
distributed
reticular or reticulonodular opacities.  The presence of small
pleural
effusions cannot be excluded.  Tracheostomy tube is unchanged.
Moderate
cardiomegaly.  No pneumothorax.
