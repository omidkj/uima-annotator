1. Low lung volumes likely account for perihilar haziness, but
followup radiograph with improved inspiratory level may be
helpful to exclude early CHF.
2. Patchy bibasilar opacities, which may relate to atelectasis
or aspiration. Attention to these areas on followup chest x-ray
would be helpful as well.

[**2142-3-7**] EKG
Sinus tachycardia. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2142-3-6**]
heart rate is now increased. Otherwise, multiple abnormalities
persist without major change.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7635**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2142-3-5**] for further
management of his chest pain. He was started on heparin and
nitroglycerin with relief of his chest discomfort. The cardiac
surgery service was consulted as surgical revascularization was
indicated. Mr. [**Known lastname 7635**] was worked-up in the usual preoperative
manner. The psychiatry service was consulted as Mr. [**Known lastname 7635**]
became aggressive and loud. He quickly calmed down and ativan
was added for anxiety related to his surgery. The
electrophysiology service was consulted given his internal
cardiac defibrillator and an interrogation was performed.
Arrythmia therapies were disabled for his upcoming surgery. On
[**2142-3-7**], Mr. [**Known lastname 7635**] was taken to the operating room where he
underwent coronary artery  bypass grafting to three vessels.
Postoperatively he was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive
care unit for monitoring. On postoperative day one, Mr. [**Known lastname 7635**] [**Last Name (Titles) 26228**] neurologically intact and was extubated. Aspirin, plavix
and beta blockade were resumed. Given his preoperative use of
OxyContin, it was resumed for management of his pain. Xanax was
resumed for anxiety. On postoperative day three, he was
transferred to the cardiac surgical step down unit for further
recovery. The physical therapy service was consulted for
assistance with his postoperative strength and mobility. Mr.
[**Known lastname 7635**] was gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight.
Flovent and Combivent were started for wheezing and atelectasis.
Mr. [**Known lastname 7635**] was pan cultured for a fever and intravenous
vancomycin was continued. Atelectasis was assumed to be the
culprit for his fevers and incentive spirometry, inhaler therapy
and chest physiotherapy was continued. Mr. [**Known lastname 7635**] continued to
make steady progress and was discharged home on postoperative
day six. His chest x-ray on discharge showed bibasilar
atelectasis. He was in normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 90-110
for which his beta blockade was increased. His room air oxygen
saturations were 95%. He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his
cardiologist, the electrophysiology service and his primary care
physician as an outpatient.
