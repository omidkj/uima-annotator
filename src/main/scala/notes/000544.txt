cardiac catheterization s/p RCA cypher stent


History of Present Illness:
56yo M with GERD, smoker and pos alcohol p/w chest pain at 1:30
AM. This woke him up from sleep. He describes [**8-1**] sharp SSCP
that did not radiate. He c/o diaphoresis and dizziness, no
palpitation/nausea/SOB. He had no prior occurence. EMS called
1/2 hour later and was brought to cath lab at 3AM. VS on the
field BP 180/90 P117.
.
VS in ED BP 138/74 P80 R16 100%on NRB. EKG show IMI pattern. He
was started on lopressor, integrillin and heparin in ED. He
received benedryl, solumedrol and pepcid for dye allergy. Cypher
stent was placed in RCA. During procedure, patient was
bradycardic to 50s with long pausese and also hypotensive to
70s. He received atropine and started on dopamine drip with good
response. HD from PA cath show PCWP 24 for which he was given
20mg lasix. PA 47/25/33, CI 3.51, RA 20

Pertinent Results:
Hgb A1c 6.1
CK peak 2633
Na 139, K 3.9, Cl 104, bicarb 24, BUN 16, Cr 1.0
.
[**1-13**] EKG: Sinus rhythm. Inferolateral ST segment elevation with
reciprocal depressions in leads I and aVL, consider acute
inferolateral myocardial infarction.
.
[**1-13**] Cath report (prelim):
Successful thrombectomy, PTCA, and stenting of the proximal and
mid RCA was performed with a 3.0x33 mm Cypher stent which was
postdilated with a 3.5mm NC balloon.  Final angiography revealed
0% residual stenosis, no dissection, and TIMI 3 flow.  (see PTCA
comments)
.
[**2127-1-14**] Echo:
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 45% to 50% (nl >=55%)
Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of the
basal to mid inferior and inferolateral walls. The remaining
segments contract normally. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional systolic dysfunction consistent with
coronary artery disease. Mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. No structural valve disease.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 2013**] is a 56 yo M who presented w/ CP and ECG w/ ST
elevations inferior leads and V4R consistent with RCA thrombus
and RV infarct.  He was taken emergently to the cardiac
catheterization lab where thrombectomy was performed and a
Cypher stent was placed to RCA. His cath revealed disease-free
LMCA, LAD, L Cx, dominant RCA with L-R collagerals.  He was
bradycardia in the lab requiring temp wire and hypotense
requiring dopamine.  Hemodynamics were indicative of RV
involvement.  This is a summary of hospital course by problem
list.
.
# CAD: Inferior MI s/p RCA cypher stent and thrombectomy [**1-13**].
He was admitted to the CCU on dopamine which was weaned off
within a day and he was started on metoprolol, lisinopril and
lipitor. He should continue aspirin for life, plavix x 12
months.
.
# Pump: [**Hospital1 **]-V failure by cath HD(high RV and LVEDP, high PCWP),
CXR show mild CHF but asymptomatic and on RA. Echo w/o RV
failure, mild-symmetric LVH with EF 45-55% (see results).
.
# rhythm: NSR
.
# Fever: Resolved. Asymptomatic; no infiltrate on CXR.
.
# alcohol abuse: Counselled on quiting, covered with CIWA scale.
.
# nicotine: Counselled about quiting.  Would recommend that PCP
continue to encourage and provide assistance with nictoine
replacement and/or wellbutrin.

Discharge Disposition:
Home

Discharge Diagnosis:
STEMI


Discharge Condition:
good; AFVSS; chest-pain free


Discharge Instructions:
Please continue to take all medications as prescribed.  You had
a heart attack and had a medicated stent placed in your right
coronary artery; it is crucial that you take plavix for one year
and aspirin for life to prevent occlusion of this stent.  You
also need to quit smoking, this is crucial to prevent further
heart damage.  You will need to follow up with cardiology here
at the appointment listed below.
.
If you have any recurrence of chest pain, shortness of breath,
jaw or arm pain you should go to the emergency department
immediately.  If you are lightheaded or have dizziness, please
contact your PCP or cardiologist.  If you have leg swelling
please seek medical attention.
