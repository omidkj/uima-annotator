Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Aspartame

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization with bare metal stent placement [**2184-6-19**]
intra-aortic balloon placement [**2184-6-19**]
EP ablation of atrial flutter [**2184-6-24**]
- noted to have both typical and atypical / bidirectional
flutter
- typical atrial flutter ablated


History of Present Illness:
This is a 71 yo F h/o mitral valve repair with annuloplasty band
in [**2180**],pre-op c.cath in [**2180**] showing 30% mid-LAD stenosis,
hypertension and hyperlipidemia who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED with
chest pain. Patient notes that she first experienced a
substernal burning pain around 0130 on [**6-19**] that awoke her from
sleep. The pain at that time radiated down to her hands. This
pain resolved over the course of about one hour and she was able
to fall back asleep. She awoke later that morning and was
feeling in her usual state of health other than a cough which
she believes may have been productive of blood tinged sputum on
one occasion. At around [**2174**] the same day she had just finished
dinner when she began to feel intense substernal burning that
again radiated down both arms and this time also radiated to her
back and up both sides of her neck. She thought it was reflux
and that vomiting might improve the pain so she induced vomiting
x 1 but the pain continued. She began to feel diaphoretic so she
took a cold shower. After nearly an hour of chest pain that
escalated to a [**10-9**] she decided to drive herself to the ED.
.
In the ED, her vitals were T97.3 HR 100 BP 159/113 RR 21 Sat 95%
RA. She was noted to have an ECG with ST elevations in V2-V6 and
recipricol depressions in II, III, aVF. STEMI protocol was
initiated and patient received ASA 325mg, Clopidogrel 600 mg x1,
Heparin bolus and integrillin bolus and then taken to the
cardiac cath lab.
.
Her cardiac cath demonstrated total occlusion of the LAD just
after the first diagonal. There were some luminal irregularities
in LCx and RCA. She got one BMS to the LAD with good effect.
During the procedure diminised motion was noted in the anterior
wall, as well as wedge pressures in the 30's. An IABP was thus
placed to be left in overnight. She was also given 10mg IV
lasix. In addition, patient's systolic blood pressures elevated
to 190's so nitro gtt started resulting in pressure coming down
to 140's.
.
On arrival to the CCU, patient was hemodynamically stable and
chest pain free. She describes mainly feeling very tired but
otherwise had no complaints.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough. She denies recent
fevers, chills or rigors. All of the other review of systems
were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

===========

IMAGING:

ECG [**2184-6-19**]:
Sinus tachycardia. There are ST segment elevations in leads I,
aVL and V1-V6 with slight ST segment depressions in leads II,
III and aVF. Left atrial
abnormality. The anterolateral ST-T wave changes are consistent
with active
ischemic process. Rule out myocardial infarction. Followup and
clinical
correlation are suggested. These findings are new compared to
the previous
tracing of [**2180-10-31**].

CARDIAC CATH [**2184-6-19**]:
CARDIAC CATH:
LMCA: no apparent CAD
LAD: total occlusion proximal/mid just after diagonal 1
LCx: Mild luminal irregularities
RCA: Mild luminal irregularities

CXR [**2184-6-20**]:
Intra-aortic balloon pump is present with radiodense tip
terminating approximately 3.8 cm below the superior aspect of
the aortic knob.Heart is mild-to-moderately enlarged, and
pulmonary vascularity is engorged. Bilateral upper lobe airspace
pattern is present, accompanied by a peripheraland diffuse
interstitial opacities, likely reflecting an
asymmetricdistribution of pulmonary edema, although other
superimposed process at theapices such as aspiration or
eosinophilic pneumonia are also possible in the appropriate
clinical setting.

TTE [**2184-6-21**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
severe hypokinesis of the distal 2/3rds of the anterior septum
and mild hypokinesis of the anterior wall and apex. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 35-40 %). The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present. The
mitral annular ring appears well seated with normal gradient.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dyfunction c/w
CAD (mid-LAD distribution). Mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Non-obstructive MV ring without signficant mitral
regurgitation.

CXR-PA/lateral [**2184-6-22**]: Mild cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the
aortic contour is unchanged. The lungs are moderately well
inflated. Indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature indicates
interstitial thickening, which is most notable in the upper
lungs bilaterally. Hyperinflation of the lungs suggests
underlying COPD. No new pneumothorax
