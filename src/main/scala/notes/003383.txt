CXR:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of aspiration or pneumonia.
2. Probable healing right rib fractures.

TTE:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or  color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly to
moderately depressed  (40-50%) with basal inferior, lateral and
apical hypokinesis. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened.
Tricuspid regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.

EGD:
Esophagus:
 Mucosa: Diffuse continuous erythema and ulcerations of the
mucosa with no bleeding were noted in the lower third of the
esophagus and middle third of the esophagus. These findings are
compatible with esophagitis. Localized erythema and erosions of
the mucosa with no bleeding were noted in the gastroesophageal
junction. These findings are compatible with NGT trauma.
Stomach:
 Contents: Food was found in the stomach body.
 Mucosa: Localized erythema and erosion with multiple
ulcerations of the mucosa with no bleeding were noted in the
pylorus.  Normal mucosa was noted in the antrum. Cold forceps
biopsies were performed for histology at the stomach antrum.
Duodenum: Normal duodenum.
Other
findings: The anatomy of the pylorus was distorted secondary to
hypertrophic gastric folds and multiple ulcerations.
Impression: Erythema and ulcerations in the lower third of the
esophagus and middle third of the esophagus compatible with
esophagitis
Food in the stomach body
Erythema and erosion and multiple ulcerations in the pylorus
The anatomy of the pylorus was distorted secondary to
hypertrophic gastric folds and multiple ulcerations.
Normal mucosa in the antrum (biopsy)
Erythema and erosions in the gastroesophageal junction
compatible with NGT trauma
