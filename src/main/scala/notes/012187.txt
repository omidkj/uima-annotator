Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**]
Chief Complaint:
ataxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 86 year-old right-handed man with a history of
CHF, COPD, dementia and 2 prior strokes resulting in residual R
sided weakness and vision loss who presents with a new
cerebellar
hemorrhage.  His family reports that he has been slightly more
congested over the past few days, for which they gave him an
extra dose of Lasix this weekend, but he was still able to walk
with only slight assistance.  However, this morning when they
sat
him up he consistently kept falling over to the left, both with
sitting and with walking.  Because of this he was taken to
[**Hospital **] Hospital, where he was given Lasix, Solumedrol and
Levaquin for presumed bronchitis vs. COPD exacerbation, and had
a
NCHCT which showed an 8mm L cerebellar hemorrhage, for which he
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.  BPs on arrival
at [**Hospital1 **] were 199/87, for which he was given 10mg of
labetalol,
and nitropaste.

On ROS he reports feeling slightly more congested over the last
few days, and that he has worsening gait instability.  He
complains of feeling dizzy for days, though family reports he
always says he is dizzy, so they did not necessarily consider
this new.


Past Medical History:
- CHF
- COPD
- 2 prior strokes - in [**2104**] presented with R sided weakness, and
in [**2106**] presented with right sided vision loss (large L sided
PCA
infarct on CT scan)
- HTN - per daughter they have been having difficulties with
orthostasis when working with PT, so decreased his BP meds
recently - systolics at home run 150-170s when lying down, but
apparently drop further when standing.


Social History:
Lives in [**Location 1456**] with his daughter who takes care of
most of his ADLs.  Previously lived in [**State 108**] and is a retired
printer.  Prior smoker, but quit in the 80s.  No EtOH or
illicits.

-Sensory: No deficits to light touch, pinprick, cold sensation,
vibratory sense. Poor cooperation with proprioception, stating
'I'm moving it up and down' while volitionally moving his own
toes.

Plantar response was extensor bilaterally.

-Coordination: Unable to complete FNF as he has difficulty
seeing
the target, and can not understand commands for other tasks of
[**Doctor First Name **].

-Gait: Requires 2 person assist just to sit up, at which point
he
tilts slightly to the left.  Deferred further gait testing due
to
significant instability just while sitting.

Imaging:
[**2109-5-7**]   CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: 1. Multiple calcifications
along the cerebellar folia and tentorium. No evidence of acute
intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Large chronic infarction in the left posterior cerebral
artery territory.  Numerous small chronic infarctions in the
cerebellar hemispheres, left pons, left putamen, and bilateral
supratentorial white matter.
3. Fluid in the right middle and posterior ethmoid air cells.

[**2109-5-7**]   CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE: Although velocities indicate
a less than 40% carotid stenosis bilaterally, there is
significant calcification, which can underestimate the actual
degree. Clinical correlation and potentially CTA followup is
warranted. There is evidence of distal right vertebral artery
disease.

[**2109-5-7**]   ECHO: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There is a
minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Grossly preserved biventricular systolic function.
Minimal aortic stenosis. Very limited study.
[**2109-5-6**]   CHEST (PA & LAT): Mild cardiomegaly and atelectasis.

[**2109-5-6**]   ECG: Ventricular pacing. Atrial rhythm uncertain may
be atrial paced. No previous tracing available for comparison.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 86 year-old right-handed man with a history of
COPD, chronic dCHF (LVEF > 55%), dementia, and multiple prior
strokes presenting after tilting to the left this morning, found
to have evidence for a new left cerebellar lesion (8mm) as well
as multiple old infarcts.  While pt had elevated blood pressure
on arrival to the OSH (199/87) and reports of poor blood
pressure control at home, the lesion does not appear to
hemorrhagic upon review
