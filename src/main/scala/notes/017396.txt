HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 74-year-old
male with ischemic cardiomyopathy status post CABG in [**2137**],
catheterization [**2160**] with occluded graft to obtuse marginal
and right coronary artery, no significant left anterior
descending or left circumflex disease, status post AICD,
ejection fraction of 20-25%, chronic renal insufficiency,
diabetes mellitus, who is admitted [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service for Dr.[**Name (NI) 22966**] Clinic for congestive heart failure exacerbation.

Patient was first seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**2164-3-26**], was felt
to be in Class II to III heart failure, and felt to be fluid
overloaded, so Lasix was increased from 40 [**Hospital1 **] to 80 [**Hospital1 **], and
he was started on hydralazine 10 mg po tid for hypertension,
given elevated creatinine at 2.0 and previous worsening renal
failure with ACE inhibitor.  He was again seen on [**2164-3-30**]
for worsening shortness of breath and weight gain 10 pounds
since previous visit.  The patient elected to remain
outpatient, where Lasix was increased to 120 mg [**Hospital1 **].

He was then hospitalized [**4-2**] to [**4-5**] at [**Hospital 620**] [**Hospital 4068**]
Hospital, where exacerbation was felt secondary to
hydralazine.  Hydralazine was discontinued.  He was diuresed.
He apparently lost 4 pounds inpatient, and he was discharged
on [**4-5**] on Bumex 1 mg po q day.  He was then seen in Dr.[**Name (NI) 22966**] Clinic again on [**4-11**] and Bumex was increased to 2
mg po bid and aldactone 12.5 mg q day was added.  He was
apparently seen again in clinic today when the decision was
made to admit him under Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for diuresis, nisseratide
drip.

He complains of severe shortness of breath, orthopnea.  No
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, no chest pain.  He denies
palpitations.  He says it takes him one hour and 45 minutes
to dress in the morning and it has been this bad for about
one month with the exception of his hospitalization.  He
complains of increased peripheral edema and increased
abdominal girth.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction
in [**2137**].  CABG in [**2135**] with a saphenous vein graft to the
OM-1 and OM-2, and right coronary artery.  Catheterization
[**6-/2161**], P.A. pressure at 31/14, wedge 12, ejection fraction
of 30%, proximal right coronary artery 100%, OM-1 diffuse
disease to right coronary artery, both saphenous vein graft
occluded.  Anterolateral hypokinesis, apical akinesis, and no
intervention was performed.
2. Congestive heart failure.  Class II-III admitted [**2163-3-21**], given nisseratide.  Echocardiogram in [**2163-5-21**]
revealed an ejection fraction of 20-25%, moderate [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) 13385**], RV dilatation, 1+ AR, 1+ MR, [**12-22**]+ TR.
3. AAI pacemaker in [**2139**], now with ICD in 01/[**2162**].
4. Hypertension.
5. Diabetes mellitus.
6. Chronic renal insufficiency.
7. Diverticulosis.
8. Chronic bronchitis.
9. Recurrent urinary tract infection.
10. Status post TURP one month ago at [**Location (un) 620**] [**Last Name (un) 4068**].

ALLERGIES:  Iodine, he is pretreated for catheterization with
Benadryl and Solu-Medrol.  Shellfish, plus or minus codeine,
aldactone causes hyperkalemia, ACE inhibitor causes worsening
renal failure.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is married and lives with his son,
grandchildren, and wife, retired [**Name2 (NI) 29798**] and heat contractor.
Tobacco none x20 years, 40 pack year alcohol, none currently
and lives in [**Location 620**].

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  No fever or chills.  Positive seasonal
allergies.  No nausea or vomiting.  Positive constipation.
No bright red blood per rectum recently.  He did have it
years ago with his diverticulosis.  No melena, no urinary
problems since TURP one month ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 95.6, blood pressure
96/50, heart rate 72, respiratory rate 24, and 96% on room
air.  Moderate tachypnea, but not unstable.  Is able to speak
in full sentences.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to
light and accommodation.  Oropharynx is clear.  Mucous
membranes moist.  Jugular venous distention 18 cm, no
lymphadenopathy.  Minimal basilar crackles scattered and few
poor air movement, occasional expiratory wheezes.  Regular,
rate, and rhythm, distant heart sounds, no murmurs, rubs, or
gallops appreciated.  Soft and distended abdomen, nontender,
and normoactive bowel sounds.  3+ left lower extremity edema
with 2+ right lower extremity edema, 2+ radial pulses
bilaterally, 2+ carotids bilaterally, 2+ dorsalis pedis
pulses bilaterally.  Alert and oriented times three.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cells 6.1, hematocrit
30.3, platelets 211, MCV 89, sodium 137, potassium 3.7,
chloride 102, bicarb 22, BUN 64, creatinine 2.3, glucose 67.
Calcium 8.2, magnesium 2.0, phosphorus 4.9, digoxin 0.6.  ALT
18, AST 26, alkaline phosphatase 146.  Total bilirubin 0.6.

CHEST X-RAY:  Small right pleural effusion, no definite
congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  V paced at 70 beats per minute.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular system:
A:  Systolic congestive heart failure exacerbation:  The
patient was started on a nisseratide drip, continued on
Bumex, his spironolactone was held secondary to low blood
pressures and his beta blocker was held secondary to low
blood pressures.  Patient's systolic blood pressure remained
in the 80s and 90s, so he was started on a dopamine drip on
the floor to 2.5, however, he still did not diurese, and so
on [**2164-4-20**], he is admitted to the CCU for Swan placement,
and Swan-guided therapy.

Swan was placed and revealed pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure around 25, central venous pressure around 20, P.A.
80/60s with cardiac output 6.0, cardiac index 2.82.  Poor
diuresis was felt secondary to poor renal perfusion from
hypotension, so dopamine drip was increased from 2.5 to 7.5.
The patient diuresed well with 1500 cc net output over 24
hours.  Bumex was increased to 3 mg IV bid.  The patient was
called out to floor for continued diuresis on [**2164-4-21**].

He was continued on nisseratide at 0.01, Bumex 3 IV bid, and
dopamine 7.5 until [**2164-4-26**] when his Natrecor was
discontinued, his dopamine discontinued, and the Bumex was
changed to 3 mg po bid.  His weight at that time was 84.3 kg.
The patient remained stable.  Had increased weight on
[**2164-4-28**], so Bumex was increased to 4 mg po bid x2 doses,
then decreased to 3 mg po bid with good net diuresis.
Patient's breathing remained stable on room air.  His edema
was markedly decreased.  He was initiated on Coreg 6.25 mg po
bid.

2. Genitourinary:  On admission, the patient was noted to
have hematuria given his recent TURP.  Urology was consulted.
They left a note on [**2164-4-19**] stating that hematuria is most
likely secondary to TURP.  Patient had continuous small
amount of hematuria until [**2164-4-24**] when Foley was
reinserted due to the patient's discomfort and severe amount
of bleeding occurred.  Urology was reconsulted.  Catheter
balloon was inflated in the prostatic fossa.  They are unable
to place at bedside with bright red blood per meatus.
Cystoscopy was pursued showing false passage of bulbar
urethra open, prostatic fossa, but contracted bladder neck.
Unable to pass the scope into the bladder.  Guide-wire was
passed into the bladder, and bladder neck was dilated with 16
French Foley catheter inserted.  The patient remains with
hematuria and multiple clots.  Bladder ultrasound revealed
multiple clots.

Patient was ultimately taken to the operating room on
05/[**0-0-**] for redo TURP.  He was started on ciprofloxacin
for a five day course.  His Foley catheter was discontinued
and he passed the voiding trial on [**2164-4-29**].

3. Diabetes mellitus type 2:  [**Last Name (un) **] consult was obtained due
to the patient's high blood sugars at home and they
recommended increasing Glyburide to 10 mg po q am, 7.5 mg po
q pm.  Patient's sugars remained stab
