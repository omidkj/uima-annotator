Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2186**]
Chief Complaint:
Presumed lung cancer, transfer for palliative stenting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Rigid bronchoscopy with stent placement [**2150-11-13**]


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4318**] is a 60 y/o f with schizophrenia, htn, chf, copd,
and a 50+ pack year smoking history who presented to
[**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**] on [**2150-11-4**] from [**Location (un) 1036**] NH with sob and
hypoxia, was given a presumptive dx of lung cancer, and is
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for palliative stenting.

She began to complain of shortness of breath and was found to be
hypoxic (94% on 2Lnc) at [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] was sent to [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**] ED.
During the admission, she was noted to have a left peri-hilar
mass on CXR as well as a left pleural effusion, and a chest CT
revealed a 3.5x5cm left suprahilar mass with impingment on the
LUL bronchus and subsequent LUL collapse. She underwent
bronchoscopy showing a large lesion involving the left mainstem
bronchus and completely obstructing the LUL take-off. On the
following day, a chest x-ray showed total white-out of the left
lung. Her course was also complicated by the onset of new atrial
fibrillation, for which she was treated with diltiazem and sent
over on an IV amiodarone load. She also was hyponatremic and was
fluid restricted for presumed SIADH, and started on sodium tabs.

On admission, she had no complaints. Occasional complaint of
chest tightness that she's been having off and on for days, not
severe, no sob, no f/c. She has a mild productive cough,
unchanged over the past few days.

Past Medical History:
1.)Chronic schizophrenia
2.)Bipolar disorder
3.)Seizure disorder
4.)Etoh abuse
5.)Diastolic CHF
6.)Hypertension
7.)COPD
8.)50+ pack year tobacco abuse history

Social History:
Lives at [**Location **]. She has 50+ pack year smoking history and
a history of etoh abuse.  Brother [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 12021**] is her hcp.

CXR [**11-8**]: IMPRESSION: Collapse left lung

CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis [**11-9**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. 3.4 x 2.9 cm peripherally enhancing lobulated mass causing
obstruction of the left upper lobe bronchus and resulting in
complete collapse/consolidation of the left upper lobe. The left
lower lobe bronchus remains patent, and the left lower lobe
remains aerated.
2. Moderate left pleural effusion, with minimal compressive
atelectasis on aerated left lower lobe.
3. Tiny 3 to 4 mm nodular densities within the right lung base.
Attention to this area should be paid on subsequent followup
exams.
4. Low-density lesion adjacent to falciform ligament most likely
represents focal fatty infiltration. Attention to this area
should be paid on followup exams.
5. Bilateral adrenal adenomas.
6. Tiny low-density lesions within both kidneys, which are too
small to adequately characterize.

[**2150-11-10**] CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2150-11-8**]:
Left upper lobe has reexpanded. Left lower lobe still collapsed
around the left hilar mass accompanied by small left pleural
effusion. Mediastinum midline. Heart normal size. Right lung
clear.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4318**] is a 60 year-old female with long-standing smoking
history with newly diagnosed lung mass obstructing LUL with
consequent collapse, transferred initially to MICU, then floor
for further work-up and care.

1) Lung mass: Her presentation with long-standing smoking, lung
mass, and presumptive SIADH was highly concerning for
malignancy, and an appropriate work-up was continued. A CT chest
performed on [**11-10**] revealed a 3.4 x 2.9 cm peripherally
enhancing lobulated mass causing obstruction of the left upper
lobe bronchus and resulting in complete collapse/consolidation
of the left upper lobe, with patent LLL bronchus. A moderate
left pleural effusion was also seen. Pleural fluid cytology from
the OSH thoracentesis returned negative for malignancy, although
only a small amount of fluid was obtained at that time. BAL
brushings from the OSH returned highly suspicious for squamous
cell cancer, which was felt diagnostic. She underwent a rigid
bronchoscopy on [**11-12**], with findings significant for tumor
infiltration of the submucosa in left mainstem bronchus, with
LUL/lingula completely obstructed. Stenting of the distal left
main stem bronchus (2mm uncovered stent) was performed.
LUL/lingula completely obstructed and unable to open. She
tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.
CXR PA/lat post-procedure without complications.

Work-up otherwise remarkable for negative head CT, abdominal CT
without liver mets, bilateral adrenal adenomas. She does have a
pleural effusion, likely malignant, and is awaiting an
out-patient PET scan to complete her metastatic work-up and
assess disease burden. Hematology-Oncology was consulted in
house, with impression of unresectability. She may benefit from
XRT, which will be addressed as an out-patient. Ms. [**Known lastname 4318**] has
a poor understanding of her disease, and as such complicates
matters in trying to obtain consent.

She will follow-up with Hematology/Oncology with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
or [**Doctor Last Name 3274**] as an out-patient.

2) Dyspnea: Felt secondary to above. She also has a history of
COPD, and was initially placed on a higher dose of Prednisone 40
mg PO QD for possible COPD exacerbation upon admission to the
MICU. COPD was ultimately not felt to be an important
contributor, and quick Prednisone taper was initiated. She is
now down to her usual dose of 10 mg PO QD. We contact[**Name (NI) **] the
patient's PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] indicated that she is on chronic low dose
Prednisone 10 mg PO QD. Continue supportive care with nebulizers
prn, MDIs. NO LASIX.

4) Atrial fibrillation: She was loaded on amiodarone IV at the
OSH, completed at [**Hospital1 18**]. She was subsequently placed on
Amiodarone 200 mg PO TID. she was also on a Diltiazem drip at
the OSH, converted to Verapamil upon transfer. She reverted to
NSR while in the ICU on [**11-10**], then back in afib on [**11-11**] with
RVR with HR in 140s, and borderline low BP. She was given
Diltiazem push IV X 3 doses, then Verapamil was changed to
Diltiazem 60 mg PO QID for easier titration. Amiodarone was also
increased to 400 mg PO TID. She converted back to NSR on [**11-11**],
and has remained in NSR since. She is back on 200 mg PO TID, and
should continue this dose X 1 week ([**11-20**]), then decrease to 200
mg PO BID X 1 week, then daily thereafter. She is back on
Verapamil 120 mg PO Q 12 hours. Decision was made not to
anticoagulate given her lung mass and concern over
friability/bleeding. However, no such evidence on bronch. She
currently remains in NSR, and per discussion with attending, no
anticoagu
