Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation
Right internal jugular central venous line

History of Present Illness:
55 year-old male with COPD on home oxygen, CAD s/p CABG admitted
with dyspnea.  He was discharged on [**2153-1-21**] after 2[**Hospital **]
hospital course for hypercarbic respiratory failure due to COPD
exacerbation requiring intubation.  He felt "so-so" on discharge
and this morning subsequently became more short of breath.  He
did not experience chest pain, palpitations, or fever.  History
otherwise limited as patient required urgent intubation on
arrival to MICU.
.
In [**11-10**] he was intubated for MRSA pneumonia.
.
During [**Date range (1) 104476**]/11 hospitalization he was intubated for
hypercarbic respiratory failure.  He received IV pulse steroids
with PO taper, broad-spectrum antibiotics narrowed to
levofloxacin for total 7-day course and completed prior to
discharge, and nebulizers with reinitiation of Advair prior to
discharge.  Hospital course was complicated by DVT in left
brachial vein for which coumadin was initiated.  Discharging
team attempted to admit patient to pulmonary rehabilitation
program - claim was declined by insurance.
.
In the ED, 97.1 103 149/57 38 98% 4L NC.  Triggered for
tachypnea.
Physical examination notable difficulty breathing.  Laboratory
data significant for leukocytosis (17.1) with left-shift, HCO3
35, lactate 1.5, INR 1.8.  Initial ABG 7.31/77/254 on unknown
settings (?after BiPap initiated).  EKG with sinus tachycardia
108, NA/NI ST depressions II,III, aVF, V5-6 suspected to be rate
related.  CXR 1V without acute abnormality.  Received solumedrol
125mg IV x1, lorazepam 2mg IV x1, azithromycin 500mg IV x1,
Combivent neb x1.  Initiated on BIPAP with improved .  On
transfer to MICU, 97.1, 101, 143/59, 21, 95% BIPAP.  Has 18G,
20G on right.
.
On arrival to MICU, patient was in respiratory distress and
required urgent intubation.
.

CXR 1V ([**2153-1-22**]):
In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has
been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip
approximately 5 cm above the carina. Orogastric tube to at least
the upper stomach, where it crosses the lower margin of the
image.
Little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs with no
evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease. Intact midline
sternal wires relate to previous CABG procedure.


Brief Hospital Course:
55 year-old male with CAD, COPD s/p recent hospitalization for
hypercarbic respiratory failure, admitted one-day post-discharge
with recurrent dyspnea.  [**Hospital 104477**] hospital course was as follows.
.
#.  Acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure.  In the
ED, 7.31/77/254; most recent ABG 7.39/70/86 on face mask.  He
has chronic respiratoy acidosis based on HCO3- 35 with likely
baseline PCO2 around 70.  Patient intubated for apneic episodes,
fatigue shortly after arrival to MICU.  Based on patient history
and recent medical course, etiology likely COPD exacerbation.
Trigger unclear - he has long history of medication/home oxygen
noncompliance, and on arrival to MICU he smelled of cigarette
smoke.  Patient was given methylprednisolone 125mg IV Q8 hours
for first day and then weaned down to prednisone 40mg PO daily
with plan for prolonged taper.  He was kept on standing
Ipratropium/albuterol nebs every 4 hours.  He was initially
started on azithromycin but was later discontinued as patient
was afebrile, WBC returned to [**Location 213**] and his chest xray did not
reveal any infiltrate.  On [**1-23**], (day after admission) patient
was successfully extubated and placed on his home O2 requirement
of 2L.  On [**2153-1-25**], his sputum grew out Pseudomonas, new to
patient's respiratory flora per our prior microbiology;
ciprofloxacin should continue for 3-4 weeks until his follow up
appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Also placed on prednisone taper
which should continue until his appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his
pulmonologist.
     Of note, patient also had some improvement in symptoms with
diuresis.  He was given Lasix 20mg IV x1 on [**2153-1-24**] with good
response.  He should continue to be weighed regularly and Lasix
dose adjusted as necessary.  He has known mild systolic
dysfunction, and is on an ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker, and Lasix
as outpatient.
.
#.  Hypotension:  Patient became mildly hypotensive in setting
of intubation.  His pressures responded to IVF boluses; however
based on poor access, a central line was placed.  Patient never
required pressors an
