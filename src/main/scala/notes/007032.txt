Admission Date:  [**2143-3-16**]       Discharge Date:  [**2143-5-3**]


Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83-year-old
female with a history of HOCM, EF 75% with a recent prolonged
admission to the CCU and MICU complicated by hypercapnic
respiratory acidosis and contraction alkalosis, and large
bilateral pleural effusions.  She was discharged to
rehabilitation on [**2143-3-13**].

On the morning of presentation, on [**2143-3-16**], the patient
had an episode of shortness of breath and hypoxia.  Her sat
was found to be 80% and she was tachypneic to 36.  An EKG was
done which showed new ST elevations in V2 and V3.  The
patient was transferred from rehabilitation to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management.

In the Emergency Department, the patient was chest pain-free.
Repeat EKG showed resolution of these changes and her initial
set of enzymes were CK of 40, MB 7, troponin 1.7.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  HOCM.
2.  Coronary artery disease.
3.  Bilateral pleural effusion.
4.  Status post thoracentesis.
5.  Non ST segment elevation MI in [**2143-1-9**].
6.  Congestive heart failure.
7.  Hypertension.
8.  Status post pacer.
9.  Status post cholecystectomy.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to colchicine.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Verapamil 80 mg three times a day.
2.  Aspirin 325 mg once a day.
3.  Lipitor 40 mg once a day.
4.  Os-Cal 1,250 mg three times a day.
5.  Prevacid 30 mg once a day.
6.  Lopressor 25 mg twice a day.
7.  Multivitamin.
8.  Senna.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient came from a nursing home.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unknown.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
97.6, blood pressure 120/52, heart rate 73, respirations 20,
95% on 2 liters nasal cannula.  HEENT: The oropharynx was
clear.  The mucous membranes were dry.  Pupils were equally
round.  Minimally reactive.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate
and rhythm with S1, S2, with III/VI systolic ejection murmur
heard across the precordium.  Pulmonary: There were decreased
breath sounds on the left to two-thirds and crackles at the
right base.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.  No
hepatosplenomegaly.  She was Guaiac negative.  Extremities:
Warm, dry, and without edema.  Cranial nerves II through XII
were intact.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White count 9.0, crit 30.5,
platelets 250,000.  Chemistries:  Sodium 137, potassium 4.7,
chloride 100, bicarbonate 29, BUN 18, creatinine 0.6, glucose
118.

Chest x-ray showed bilateral pleural effusions, left greater
than right which had reaccumulated since her previous chest
x-ray on [**2143-3-12**].

EKG showed normal sinus at 75, 1.[**Street Address(2) 1755**] elevations in V2 and
V3, and T wave inversions in V3 through V6.  These ST
elevations were new from previous EKGs.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 196**] Service where she ruled in by enzymes with a small
troponin leak.  She was diuresed for CHF and on [**2143-3-22**], she developed atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular rate, status post DC cardioversion and was
started on Amiodarone and heparin.

For her pleural effusion, the patient received a diagnostic
tap revealing hemothorax requiring a chest tube which was
placed on the 11th and discontinued on the 13th.  Several
days later on [**2143-3-24**], the patient developed
hypotension and was transferred to the CCU, was intubated on
pressors and transfused for a GI bleed.  An EGD done at this
time showed an ulcer in the cardia of the stomach and
gastritis.

The patient was transferred to the Medical ICU on [**2143-4-1**] for difficulty weaning off the vent and further
management.

For her respiratory failure, the patient remained intubated
and was a difficult wean secondary to bilateral pleural
effusions.  Chest tubes were placed for these pleural
effusions with pleurodesis times two on each side.  The
patient was weaned off the vent and remained off the vent for
approximately one week; however, she then developed further
respiratory distress, was reintubated and the decision was
made to have a trach which was performed on [**2143-4-25**].

The patient developed multiple episodes of
ventilator-associated pneumonia treated with levofloxacin.
The patient then developed a Pseudomonas
ventilator-associated pneumonia and was started on Ceftaz and
[**Female First Name (un) **] nebs.  At the time of discharge to rehabilitation, the
patient was tolerating trach mask trials intermittently along
with CPAP with pressor support.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Cardiology was initially consulted
regarding a possible ethanol ablation for her HOCM, however,
given the minimal gradient seen on cath and the likelihood
for minimal benefit, this was not pursued.  The patient
remained on her Amiodarone and Lopressor for her rate control
and was given Lasix p.r.n.

3.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient is with a history of GI
bleed.  The patient was maintained on PPI for prophylaxis.
No further episodes of bleed.

4.  FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  Initially, the
patient was maintained on tube feeds via an OG tube.  This
was then changed to a PEG on [**2143-4-19**].  The patient's
electrolytes were repleted p.r.n. and her tube feeds were
advanced to goal.

5.  ENDOCRINE:  The patient was maintained on a regular
insulin sliding scale.

6.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  As mentioned previously, the patient
developed multiple episodes of ventilator-associated
pneumonia.  She received courses of vancomycin, levofloxacin,
and most recently ceftazidime and [**Female First Name (un) **] nebs for Pseudomonas.

7.  PROPHYLAXIS:  The patient received PPI and pneumoboots.
The patient did not receive subcutaneous heparin.

8.  CODE STATUS:  The patient was initially full code;
however, as per discussions with the family and the health
care proxy, her son, the decision was made to make the
patient a DNR on [**2143-5-2**].

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is discharged to
rehabilitation to [**Hospital1 **].

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.
2.  Bilateral pleural effusions.
3.  Status post pleurodesis times two.
4.  Bilateral hemothorax.
5.  Congestive heart failure.
6.  Respiratory failure, status post tracheostomy.
7.  PEG placement.
8.  Ventilator-associated pneumonia including
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella, and
Pseudomonas.
9.  Gastrointestinal bleed.

MEDICATIONS AT DISCHARGE:
1.  Albuterol inhaler.
2.  Colace.
3.  Senna.

5.  Regular insulin sliding scale.
6.  Lansoprazole 30 mg once a day.
7.  Lopressor 50 mg once a day.
8.  Amiodarone 200 mg once a day.
9.  Ceftazidime 2 grams IV b.i.d. for 13 more days.
10. [**Female First Name (un) **] nebulizers twice a day.
11. Lasix 20 mg once a day.
