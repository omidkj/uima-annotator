Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
occasional palpitation


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Mitral Valve Repair (#28mm CE Physio Ring) [**2165-6-14**]


History of Present Illness:
46 year old man with a history of
HTN, Hepatitis C (Child A), ESRD on hemodialysis (s/p failed
kidney transplant) and prior large pericardial effusion without
tamponade s/p pericardiocentesis in [**2160**]. For the past years he
has developed mitral regurgitation as well as aortic
regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation thought to be
secondary
to a high-output state from a prior AV fistula.
He is recently s/p EPS in [**2164-12-30**] for palpitations where
typical tricuspid isthmus dependent atrial flutter as well as
left atrial tachycardia was induced. The atrial flutter was
successfully ablated. Since that time the patient has undergone
stress testing which revealed a fixed defect in the RCA
territory
(unchanged from last year). In addition, he underwent repeat
transthoracic echo. This revealed 2+ AI, 4+ MR, 2+ TR and severe
pulmonary hypertension. His valve disease was noticeably worse
as
compared to last years echocardiogram. He subsequently underwent
a TEE which also showed severe MR, moderate AI with low normal
systolic function, dilated LV and mild global hypokinesis with
worse involvement of the inferior wall. In terms of symptoms, he
used to have severe palpitations prior to his ablation, but now
completely resolved. In addition, he has had some exertional
upper abdominal pressure without radiation that would resolve
within a few minutes with rest, but has not had that recently.
He
denies chest discomfort, shortness of breath, PND or orthopnea
currently. Given the severity of his disease, he was been
referred for surgical management. He underwent a cardiac
catheterization in [**Month (only) 116**] which showed clean coronaries.

Pertinent Results:
Intra-op TEE [**2165-6-14**]:
Conclusions
PREBYPASS
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.Mild to moderate ([**12-31**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. After induction of general anesthesia..
With steep Trendelenberg, phenylephrine infusion to increase
systolic BP to 150 mm Hg the MR increased to 3+. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened.

POSTBYPASS Biventricular systolic function remains normal. There
is a ring prosthesis in the mitral position. No MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 20755**]d. The remaining study is unchanged from prebypass.

CXR [**2165-6-19**]: PA & Lateral
Right lung is clear.  Left lower lobe atelectasis is improving.
Small
bilateral pleural effusions are stable.  Cardiomediastinal
silhouette has a normal post-operative appearance.  Air in the
pericardium and mediastinum seen on the lateral view at level of
the xiphoid is not an uncommon post-operative finding this
early.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2165-6-14**] where
the patient underwent Mitral Valve Repair with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  POD 1 found the
patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.
 The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically
stable, weaned from inotropic and vasopressor support.  Beta
blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward
the preoperative weight.  Renal followed and Hemodialysis was
resumed.  He had a brief episode of AFib.  He is followed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], who recommended titrating Lopressor.  The patient was
transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest
tubes and pacing wires were removed without complication.
Lisinopril was restarted for hypertension.
Renal followed the patient throughout his course and
hemodialysis was continued. The patient was evaluated by the
physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility. They deemed him safe for home. By the time of
discharge on POD6 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound
was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The
patient was discharged on [**2165-6-20**] to home with [**Hospital 119**]
Homecare in good condition.  He will follow-up as an outpatient.
