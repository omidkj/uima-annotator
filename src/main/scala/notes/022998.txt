Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Plaquenil / Glyburide

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
Fatigue, SOB, chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with drug eluting stent to the distal
left main artery with right femoral artery angioseal


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 90256**] is a [**Age over 90 **] y/o female with h/o HTN, and a previous
STEMI on [**2110-7-10**] which was treated with a BMS of the LMCA into
LAD origin and complicated by a hemopericardium during that
admission. She presented on [**10-10**] with 2 day history of heavy
breathing, chest pain with associated DOE and fatigue for
several days.  She describes the pain as a mild mid sternal
burning sensation that radiated to her throat and down her left
arm.  She reports the pain is in the same area as her previous
MI, but not as severe. On [**10-10**] she felt that her breathing was
heavy and she activated EMS.

In the the [**Hospital1 18**] ED and she was found to have ECG demonstrating
small ST elevations in V1-3 with T-wave inversions laterally.

Urgent coronary angiography on [**2110-10-10**] demonstrated severe
restenosis (80%) of the previous BMS from the distal LMCA into
the LAD. She was given ASA 325 mg and Clopidogrel 300 mg and a
DES was placed inside the previous stent.  Post PCI, no
remaining stenosis of LAD, prx LMCA lesion (40%), prx LCx lesion
(60%) Unchanged from [**7-8**].  The RCA was not injected (normal in
[**7-8**]).

Given her history of hemoparicardium s/p stemi she was
transferred to the CCU for monitoring.

On arrival to the unit She was in no distress and
hemodynamically stable.

Past Medical History:
- Hypertension
- Rhematoid arthritis
- Gallstones
- s/p hysterectomy
- s/p appendectomy

Social History:
Lives with her sister (also in her 90s) in [**Location (un) 1468**], MA.
Formerly worked in a school nursery, post office, and Navy ship
yards.  She is still completely independent at home with all
ADLs, cooks her own food and cleans the home herself.

2-D ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2110-10-10**]:
The right atrium is moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is profoundly depressed (LVEF = 20%) with
severe hypokinesis of all segments, with relative preservation
of basal posterior and lateral wall contractility. The estimated
cardiac index is profoundly depressed (1.1 L/min/m2). The right
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular
cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The
number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Significant aortic
stenosis is present (not quantified - low flow/low gradient
physiology). The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is severe mitral
annular calcification. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] Severe [4+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at least
moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to
a very high right atrial pressure.] There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior report (images reviewed)
of [**2110-9-8**], there has been marked intercurrent worsening
of all of the following: left ventricular contractile function
(due to marked intercurrent worsening of anterior, septal, and
apical contractile function), right ventricular function,
pulmonary hypertension, and tricuspid regurgitation. The
echocardiographic estimate of cardiac index is profoundly
reduced.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o female with h/o HTN, and a previous STEMI on [**2110-7-10**]
which was treated with a BMS of the LMCA into LAD origin and
complicated by a hemopericardium during that admission, presents
with 1 day history of chest pain with associated SOB and fatigue
for several days, found to have LAD instent-restenosis.

# CORONARIES:  Patient found to have in-stent thrombosis of LMCA
in to LAD s/p DES to previous stent.  She was placed on ASA
81mg, Plavix, and metoprolol.  She was not started on a statin
during this hospitalization due to elevated liver function
tests.  Her liver function should be monitored as an outpatient
and a statin started when LFTs normalize or at least a low dose
statin should be considered.  She was diuresed with Lasix IV to
which she responded very well.  She was in the CCU overnight and
was called out to the regular cardiology floor for continued
monitored.  She had a uncomplicated hospital stay, was evaluated
by PT who recommended that she be discharged home.
Additionally, an ACEI/[**Last Name (un) **] was not started due to low blood
pressures during her hospital stay.  Her BPs should be monitored
as an outpatient and an ACE or [**Last Name (un) **] should be initiated when
appropriate.

# PUMP: Status post PCI with h/o hemopericardium and ICM s/p
STEMI in [**Month (only) **].  Last EF was 35% in 8/[**2110**].  Repeat TTE on this
admission showed worsening of all of the following: left
ventricular contractile function (due to marked intercurrent
worsening (severe hypokinesis) of anterior, septal, and apical
contractile function; EF 20%), right ventricular function,
pulmonary hypertension, and tricuspid regurgitation (4+). 2+ MR.

We suspect that the deterioration in the right ventricle is
likely due to acute on chronic diastolic HF with consequent RV
dysfunction. The right coronary artery was not examined during
catheterization as the LAD was felt to be the culprit vessel.
There was no clinical evidence of pulmonary embolism. Follow up
echo to assess RV status as an outpatient will be done.  She was
treated with medical management as outlined above.  An ACEI/[**Last Name (un) **]
was not started due to low blood pressures during her hospital
stay.  Her BPs should be monitored as an outpatient and an ACE
or [**Last Name (un) **] should be initiated when appropriate.
