blood and urinary cultures were negative for growth

EKG: [**10-15**]: Sinus tachycardia at 120 with normal axis and
nonpathologic Qs in V3-V6. Poor R wave progression in leads
VI-V3. Prolonged
Q-T interval. Diphasic T waves in leads V4-V6 and low amplitude
T waves
in leads II, III and aVF which are non-specifically abnormal.
Tall R waves
fulfilling voltage criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy in
lead V5.

CXR [**2141-10-15**]: The heart is of normal size. The mediastinal and
hilar contours are within normal limits. There are no pleural
effusions seen. There is a nodular density seen in the lateral
view anteriorly. The other pulmonary opacity seen in the right
middle lobe in the CT in the same day cannot be identified in
the radiograph. The aorta is tortuous. There is no evidence of
pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: Nodular density seen in the lateral view anteriorly.
Another density seen in the CT in the same day cannot be
identified in the radiograph. Please review report of the CT
performed in the same day for differential diagnosis.

CTA [**2141-10-16**]: There are 2 large nodules in the right middle lobe.
They are low attenuation and do not enhance. Considering the
patients symptoms and the hypothesis that the patient is
immunocompetent, this most likely represents bacterial
pneumonia. However, follow up until resolution is necessary to
exclude malignancy. small right pleural effusion.

CXR: [**2141-10-18**] Pulmonary edema is resolved. Persistent
consolidation at the base of the right lung is probably
pneumonia. Hyperinflation suggests COPD. Heart size is normal.
There is no pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:

[**2141-10-19**] with antibiotics. The patinet also received pneumovax
