Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
L sided weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 71 year old R handed male with HTN and cardiomyopathy of
unclear origin who presents from [**Hospital6 **] with
L sided weakness and dysarthria. He was well until today around
10:30 am [**2-16**] when he suddenly felt nauseous and dizzy. He says
he slumped over to the ground and need to go to the bathroom but
could not get up to do so. He lost continence on the ground. He
says he noticed then that his L arm and leg were weak. No LOC.
His landlord found his confused, on the floor of his house, 1
hour later and called EMS. Pt was taken to [**Hospital3 4298**]
hosptial where a head CT showed R MCA infarct. He then was sent
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. He arrived in our ED at 5:30
pm, 7 hours after onset of symptoms.

ROS: negative for recent illness, head or neck trauma, travel,
change in mental status, headache, focal neuro deficits. Of
note, pt had laparascopic polypectomy last tuesday for benign
polyps, and since then has had diarrhea.


Past Medical History:
HTN
cardiomyopathy, per pt recent ECHO and EKG were "stable"
s/p L nephrectomy for renal tumor, pt did not know it's identity

Pertinent Results:
[**2-22**] CT of Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis
RESULTS PENDING

[**2-16**] CT and CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS; CT NECK W/CONTRAST
IMPRESSION
1. Large right MCA infarct involving almost the entire territory
supplied by this artery.
2. Almost total thrombosis of the origin of the right M2 segment
with reconstitution of the distal branches. A filling defect is
noted in the right M2 segment.

[**2-17**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2143-2-17**] 7:49 AM
IMPRESSION
1. Evolving large right MCA distribution infarct.
2. No acute intracranial hemorrhage identified.
3. These results were called to Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] of Neurology at the
time of interpretation (10:30 a.m.).

[**2-21**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION: Again seen is a right MCA infarct, without evidence
of new infarction or hemorrhage.

CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE  [**2143-2-18**]
IMPRESSION:
No evidence of stenosis in either carotid artery.

[**2-18**] TTE
IMPRESSION: Moderate inducible mid-ventricular cavity gradient.
Mild aortic
regurgitation with normal valve morphology. Mild mitral
regurgitation. No
definite cardiac source of embolism identified. Based on [**2134**]
AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings
indicate a moderate risk (prophylaxis recommended). Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

[**2-22**] TEE
Conclusions:
The left atrium is dilated. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is
seen in the body of the left atrium. No mass/thrombus is seen in
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage. The right atrium
is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in
the body of the right atrium or the right atrial appendage. No
atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D,
color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. There is
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). No masses or thrombi are seen in
the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
probably systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: No cardiac source of embolism identified.

[**2-17**] CXR
IMPRESSION:
Left subclavian central venous catheter with its tip in the
superior vena cava. No pneumothorax. Cardiomegaly without
evidence of congestive failure.

Brief Hospital Course:
71 y.o. male presented w L hemiplegia and neglect of injury
admitted for R MCA stroke.

A summary of his pertinent hospital course by system follows:

NEURO
Pt presented from [**Hospital6 **] w L hemiplegia,
dysarthria and neglect of injury.  Inital CT/CTA on [**2-16**] showed
a large right MCA infarct involving almost the entire territory
supplied by this artery as well as almost total thrombosis of
the origin of the right M2 segment with reconstitution of the
distal branches. The patient was not a candidate for tPA because
of time elapsed since onset of symptoms.
Follow-up head CT on [**2-17**] showed evolving large right MCA
distribution infarct, but no acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Because of a persistent headache, pt was reimaged on [**2-21**] and
the head CT showed no eviden
