Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
79 year old female with recent flash pulmonary edema [**1-16**] HTN
urgency, with hx of DM2, HTN, AS s/p AVR with bioprothetic AS,
and pacemaker placed for complete heart block, who presetend to
the ED for acute dyspnea and elevated blood pressure.

Per the patient, she was at day care and had not taken her
medications at their scheduled time the day prior to admission.
She took her scheduled doses two hours apart that day.  On the
following morning the visiting nurse came to her house and found
her blood pressure in her L arm to be 220/165.  Per the patient,
her breathing had become more heavy, but she did not feel like
she could get enough air.  She had felt fatigued for the last
week, and had slept more, but denied any other new symptoms.
She reports some left shoulder and jaw pain, but this has been
present and unchanged for the last week.  She denies any chest
pain, discomfort, N/V, diaphoresis, palpitations,
lightheadedness, dizziness, or cough, claudication.  She has PND
at night, but no orthopnea.  She was able to lay supine the
night prior to her presentation.  She has been hospitalized for
CHF exacerbations twice this year (including this admission).
At baseline, she has been able to walk 500 meters without any
sypmptoms (self reported).
.
Of note, during her last admission for hypoglycemia, she had
flash pulmonary edema and respiratory distress after her L arm
blood pressure was found to be elevated to 218/118.
.
ROS: (+) urinary frequency, loose stools.  DVT ten years prior,
(-) for fevers, chills, night sweats, melena, BRBPR (recent),

.
In the ED, initial vitals were afebrile, 148/84, 90s, RR 40s,
97% NRB. She was given 100IV lasix and put out 500cc, given ASA
325, SL nitro, nitro gtt, put on BiPAP with symptomatic
improvement. Current vitals 153/48  V-paced 60s, RR19 100%
BiPAP. No ABG done.
.
Upon arrival to the floor, she was chest pain free without any
acute respiratory distress.  VS: 97.5 60 152/42 10 96 on 4L.
She was started on her home medications.

TTE [**9-27**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. A bioprosthetic
aortic valve prosthesis is present. The prosthetic aortic valve
leaflets are thickened. The transaortic gradient is higher than
expected for this type of prosthesis. There is severe
bioprosthetic aortic valve stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**12-16**]+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is
severe mitral annular calcification. An eccentric, anteriorly
directed jet of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due
to acoustic shadowing from both the mitral and aortic annuli,
the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images
unavailable for review) of [**2124-1-24**], the mitral
regurgitation is probably worse (and almost certainly
underestimated in both studies), and the pulmonary hypertension
is also worse.

Brief Hospital Course:
79 y/o female with significant risk factors for CAD, s/p CABG,
AVR, s/p atrial thrombus on anticoagulation, PM for complete
heart block who presented with acute dsypnea, and hypertension
urgency.

# Dyspnea: Presumed diagnosis was flash pulmonary edema in the
setting of chronic hypertension, restenosed bio-prosthetic
valve, and non-adherence to medication regimen. Dyspnea
symptomatically improved with diuresis, afterload reduction, and
rate control with diltiazem. Cardiac enzymes were flat.
Respiratory status returned to baseline.  Echo prior to
discharge showed severe bioprosthetic aortic valve stenosis and
worse mitral regurgitation compared to previous studies. The
patient was discharged home in stable condition with addition of
long-acting diltiazem, increase in BB was, and ACEi was
downtitrated. She was extensively counseled in the presence of
the husband and with a [**Name (NI) 595**] interpreter about the importance
of strict compliance with medication regimen (has VNA most days
of the week) and sodium restriction. It is uncle
