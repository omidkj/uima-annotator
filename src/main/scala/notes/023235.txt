History of Present Illness:
This is a 83 year old man with COPD, CHF, OSA and Afib admitted
to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) 104670**] including MICU stay for hypoxia felt most
likely [**3-9**] PNA w/contributions from COPD and CHF.  On last
admission, his chief complaints were increasing DOE and fatigue.
 His PNA was Rx w/ctx and azithro and he xferred to MICU for
desaturation while on BIPAP, felt [**3-9**] disconnection of O2 bleed.
 It was concluded that the patient's mask was not fitting well
and that was contributing to his
hypoxia; he left with an outpatient appointment for adjustment.
.
For the past two days, he has been increasingly SOB.  In the
field, he was diaphoretic and received lasix and nitroglycerin.
In the ED, his temp was 101, his BP 140/80 and his pulse 105 in
afib.  His JVD was elevated and he was making poor respiratory
effort.  He was given solumedrol, levofloxacin and was
intubated. Pt also rec'd combivent neb, asa 325mg PR, Etomidate
20mg IV, succs 125mg IV, versed 2mg IVx3.


Past Medical History:
1. Congestive heart failure with an EF of 50-55% on last
echocardiogram ([**3-13**]).  Also with tricuspid regurgitation and
pulmonary hypertension.
2. COPD on 2L nasal cannula supplemental oxygen.
3. Atrial Fibrillation on coumadin
4. Gastroperesis
5. Benign prostatis hypertrophy.
6. Osteoporosis
7. Cataracts
8. Pneumovax [**2183**], tetanus [**2178**], flu [**11/2185**]

[**5-31**] Urine, blood cx x2 PND

Imaging:
CXR pre-intubation: Poor quality portable film demonstrates RLL
opacity and pulmonary edema.
.
Post: ETT is midline and perhaps high. Pulmonary edema
unchanged. R lung fields clipped.
1.  Increased right lower lobe consolidation, consistent with
atelectasis versus pneumonia.
2.  Increased right lower lobe effusion.
.
EKG: irregular irregular rate 100, QRS wnl, no acute ST changes


Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly, 83M with COPD, CHF, OSA and Afib admitted for hypoxia
[**3-9**] PNA w/contributions from COPD and CHF.
.
# respiratory failure - On presentation, poor oxygenation and
tachypnea subsequently intubated in ED. DDx included RLL
pneumonia, COPD exacerbation, CHF and PE. Had h/o recent CAP RLL
tx'd with course ceftriaxone and azithromycin. CE with no CK
bump, trop peak of 0.04. Supratherapeutic on coumadin on
admission so low likelihood for PE. Extubated [**6-2**] with good
oxygenation/ventilation. Nebs and inhalers PRN. Daily fluid goal
even to negative. Rate control atrial fibrillation with
diltiazem and metoprolol. Started on vancomycin and zosyn this
admission and will go home on levofloxacin to finish 7 day
course. Given solumedrol which was switched to prednisone and
will go home on prednisone taper.
.
# Supratherapeutic INR - likely [**3-9**] anticoagulation with
coumadin in setting of abx. Held coumadin given d/c with
hospice, risk of bleed while on abx. Will readdress
anti-coagulation with primary care physician.
.
# Right pleural effusion - Unclear whether this is infected. US
showed with small effusion, not tapped given small volume and
also not in line with patient wishes to return home with hospice
.
# A fib - h/o afib since [**2186-8-28**] per our records. On coumadin as
outpt. Rate control with metoprolol and diltiazem as above,
resuming home meds. Followed on telemetry, EKGs unchanged.
.
# Gastroparesis - continued metoclopramide.
.
# BPH - stable
.
# Osteoporsosis - continued calcium and vitamin D.
.
# anemia - Transfuse for 3 pt drop or Hct<28.
.
# proph - Continued pneumoboots, PPI, bowel regimen, HOB>30
degrees, OOB. Encouraged ambulation with rolling walker and
consider SC heparin if functional status declines.
.
# FEN - Regular diet with supervision. No insulin sliding scale
given going home with hospice.
.
# access - PIVs
.
# code status - now DNR/DNI per discussions with patient and
daughter yesterday. Hospice representatives to meet with patient
& daughter this morning to arrange plans for d/c home.
.
# communication - daughter [**Name (NI) 553**] [**Name (NI) 2716**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 104671**]
.
# dispo - home with hospice.
