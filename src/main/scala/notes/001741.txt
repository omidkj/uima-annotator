History of Present Illness:
32 M with PMH HTN, obesity presents with chest pressure and SOB.
Patient has had chronic baseline SOB since Xmas, but SOB became

pressure in L chest started at 2 pm yesterday, [**2165-3-14**], radiated

Brief Hospital Course:
32 M with PMH obesity, HTN presents with hypertensive emergency
and NSTEMI.
.
# NSTEMI:
1. Ischemia: Patient had clean coronary arteries on cardiac
catheterization. Cardiac enzymes were initially elevated up to
Troponin 0.56, but then trended down.  Troponin elevation was
most likely from stress from HTN.  Patient was kept on ACE for
afterload reduction. Patient was on dobutamine for CI 1.8 on
admission.  Patient was encouraged to maintain lifestyle/diet
modifications, and to stop EtOH and cocaine.
.
2. Pump: EF 30%, Class IV Heart Failure
Etiology of heart failure and depressed EF is likely combination
of dilated cardiomyopathy from alcohol and hypertensive
cardiomyopathy.  Differential included multiple etiologies, such
as EtOH, HTN, cocaine, pheo, pulm HTN from OSA, viral.  The
patient was fluid overloaded on admission, was diuresed
successfully with lasix 20 IV (patient is lasix naive).
Hydralazine was started for afterload reduction.  Morphine [**1-12**]
mg was given prn.  Urine output was wnl during admission.
.
3. Rhythm: PVCs on tele. 45 beat NSVT on admission
During the patient's 45 beat NSVT run on admission, the patient
was asymptomatic, no dizziness, no CP, no SOB, and was
hemodynamically stable the entire time.  Patient was monitored
on tele, which showed occasional PVCs.
.
# HTN urgency:
Patient's SBP was around 200, and ACE was uptitrated for goal
SBP < 140.  Given the patient's extensive family history of HTN,
as well as young age of onset of HTN at around 20 yo, etiologies
such as hyperaldosteronism and renovascular HTN were considered.
 HTN was most likely etiology of patient's chronic headaches.
Headaches were at baseline, and resolved once patient's BP was
under better control.  Patient will follow with endocrine for
workup.
.
# Shortness of breath:
Etiology of patient's SOB is likely a combination of dilated
cardiomyopathy, hypertensive cardiomyopathy, or OSA.  Patient's
PCWP was 27.  Patient will follow with sleep study as
outpatient.
.
# EtOH history:
Patient required only very minimal amounts of Ativan on CIWA
scale.
