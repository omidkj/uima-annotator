Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
Tachypnea/OSH transfer for cathterization

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with placement of an intra-aortic
balloon pump
midline catheter placed.

PICC line placement in left arm.


History of Present Illness:
34 year old F with Angelman's syndrome and baseline mental
retardation developed tachypnea at group home on day of
admission.  911 was called and she was taken to an OSH ED at
4PM.  Per her caretakers, she had spiked a fever to 104 F on the
day PTA and seemed lethargic.  On the day of admission, she
remained in bed until 2PM and then was noted to be tachypnic.
Upon arrival to the ER, she had sinus tach to 160s.  EKG
revealed ST elevation in V2-V5.  She was given Lopressor 5 mg IV
x3, heparin bolus and gtt, plavix 600 mg, aspirin 325 mg.  Her
BP then fell to 68/43 with HR 120s, satting 92% 4L NC.  She was
given IVF bolus and started on dobutamine before being
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for catheterization and treatment.
.
In the cath lab, she was found to have 100% occlusion of the
proximal LAD.  No intervention was performed as the infarction
was likely several days old with the myocardium no long viable.
She was in cardiogenic shock with cardiac index of 1.7 and PCWP
27. A Balloon pump placed.  BP was labile and decreased with
versed; she was started on levophed.  She was satting 100% on
NRB.
.
Due to her MR, we were unable to obtain ROS directly from the
patient.  However, per her caretakers, she had increased
lethargy over the last few weeks with decreased PO intake.  She
had a UTI few weeks ago and was treated with a course of Bactrim
and then cirpofloxacin for ten days.  Her psychiatrist recently
started [**Hospital1 74959**] for mood stabilization.

[**2147-3-7**] CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system
revealed
single vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had no
angiographically
significant coronary artery disease.  The LAD had a total
proximal
occlusion, with distal vessel injection revealing an atretic
vessel with
contrast pooling in the myocardium.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left and right sided
filling
pressures with RVEDP of 16 mm Hg and PCWP mean of 25 mm Hg.
There was
mild pulmonary arterial hypertension of 39/29 mm Hg.  There was
evidence
of cardiogenic shock with a cardiac index of 1.8 l/min/m2.
There was
systemic arterial hypotension of 96/76 mm Hg.
3.  Left ventriculogrpahy was deferred.
4. Distal injection past the occusion in LAD consistent with
myocardial
infarction of greater than 48 hours duration with non-viable
myocardium.
5. Placement of IABP for cardiogenic shock
6. Difficult initial access requiring use of smart needle to
access LFA.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Single vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Cardiogenic shock.
3. Systemic hypotension.
4. Placement of IABP

[**2147-3-8**] TTE: EF 25%
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
septal, anterior and apical akinesis. The basal to mid inferior
and lateral walls are hyperdynamic. No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal
defect. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
[**2147-3-16**] TTE: EF 30%
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately-to-severely depressed (LVEF= 30 %)
secondary to akinesis of the interventricular septum and
anterior free wall, and dyskinesis of the apex. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a
restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial
pressure. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion. Compare
