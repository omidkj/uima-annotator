Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 79 yo M DNR/DNI in hospice with end-stage CHF and cardiac
ascites admitted with pneumonia, transferred to the MICU for
hypotension and then to the floor after hypotension improved.
.
#Pneumonia-He was admitted with fever and cough and was found to
have a right lower lobe pneumonia.  He was satting well, and
started on ceftriaxone and vancomycin as he is chronically
hospitalized.  His cough improved throughout his
hospitalization.  His blood cultures, urine cultures and sputum
cultures had no growth.  A urine legionella angtigen was
negative.  After several days on ceftriaxone and vancomycin his
antibiotic treatment was changed to levofloxacin.  On the
medical floor he was satting in the high nineties on room air
and reported that his cough had improved significantly.
.
# Hypotension-He has baseline low bp secondary to severely
impaired cardiac function. BP appeared below baseline in the
MICU possibly secondary to sepsis physiology (with some signs of
underperfusion including waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status).
Source of infection pulmonary, though SBP could not be excluded.
After 24 hours of antibiotics his mental status improved as did
his hypotension.  He also received IVF prn.   Once transferred
to the floor he was not hypotensive below his baseline (systolic
in the 70's).  His mental status was stably alert and oriented
times three.
.
# Hyponatremia-He is hyponatremic at baseline, likely secondary
to liver disease from heart failure.  His hyponatremia was
stable and was not treated with fluids management as he is fluid
overloaded but hypotensive and was not symptomatic.
.
# End-stage CHF complicated by cardiac [**Hospital 68806**] hospital day 3
he became uncomfortable with the amount of fluid in his abdomen.
His abdominal port was accessed and 6 liters were removed.  His
abdomen was less tense and his breathing improved afterwards.
His poor prognosis was discussed further with son and reason for
hospice.  A conversation occurred with his son, himself, his
wife about his code status and they wished to have his code
status changed from DNR/DNI to full code.

.
# Renal insufficiency. His creatinine was at baseline and
stable.  Medications were renally dosed.
.
# Anemia. His anemia was at baseline and stable
.
# FEN: full diet.
.
# Prophylaxis: Hep subq, PPI.
.
# Access: Peripheral IV.
.
# Comm. Health care proxy is son [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 68807**] or
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 68808**]
.
# Code: full code (spoke with son [**2195-11-1**]), also spoke with Mr.
[**Known lastname 68791**] himself and he expressed that he is interested in pursuing
medical treatments that his medical team would feel would be
helpful.  He stated that he has discussed this multiple times
with his family and they know what he would like.
.
Please note that his change in code status back to full code
appears to have been  influenced by his acute presentation,
though he did not require pressors or any intubation this
admission.  On further conversation with the pt after he was
clinically improved, he stated that "I've had many discussions
with my doctors about this in the past; I want to receive
treatments that the doctors think [**Name5 (PTitle) **] help me but do not want
the ones that would not benefit me."  He did seem to understand
that intubation and resuscitation with his underlying conditions
likely would not result in improved quality of life and
successful recovery to his prior status; i.e. he likely would
not recover and leave the ICU setting.

Nonetheless, his code status remains full at this time and we
have communicated with his hospice nurse (who knows him well)
that this should continue to be addressed with the patient and
family.
