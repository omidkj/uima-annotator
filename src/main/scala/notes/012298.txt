Admission Date:  [**2163-7-7**]       Discharge Date:  [**2163-7-15**]


Service:  Cardiothoracic

REASON FOR ADMISSION:  The patient was referred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for cardiac catheterization
after an outpatient abnormal echocardiogram and patient
complaint of recent lightheadedness.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 83-year-old patient was
admitted to [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 **] several weeks prior to his
admission to [**Hospital6 256**] with a
complaint of lightheadedness and vertigo while walking to his
kitchen table.  He states that he never lost consciousness,
but he did fall to the floor due to his legs giving out.  An
echocardiogram was done on [**2163-6-10**] that showed the left
atrium mildly dilated, mild concentric left ventricular
hypertrophy with an ejection fraction of [**9-12**]% and akinesis
of the anterior septum and apex, right ventricle mildly
dilated with right ventricular free wall hypokinesis, aortic
valve mildly thickened and sclerotic.  The patient denies any
recent endotracheal tube, any chest pain, or shortness of
breath recently, and he has had no further episodes of
lightheadedness since his discharge from the hospital.  He
also denies claudication, orthopnea, edema, and paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  His past medical history is
significant for benign prostatic hypertrophy, mild dementia
and memory loss, bilateral hernia repairs, and remote
gastrointestinal surgery for a twisted intestine.

ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:  Aspirin 325 once daily;
Univasc 7.5 b.i.d.; digoxin .125 once daily; Cardura 4 once
daily; bisoprolol 12.5 once daily; and Aricept 10 mg once
daily.

LABORATORY DATA:  His laboratory studies from [**6-29**] show a
white count of 6.8, hematocrit 49.3, platelet count 236, INR
0.8, sodium 141, potassium 4.1, chloride 103, CO2 28, BUN 16,
creatinine 1.0, glucose 83.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married and lives at [**Location (un) **] Retirement Home in [**Location (un) 620**] with his wife.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Cardiology
Service and a cardiac catheterization was done.  Please see
the catheterization report for full details.  In summary, the
catheterization showed left main with 80% lesion, left
anterior descending coronary artery with 95% lesion, right
coronary artery with 70-80% lesion, with an ejection fraction
of 15-20%; global hypokinesis, apical akinesis, and no mitral
regurgitation.  At that time, Cardiothoracic Surgery was
consulted.

The patient was seen by Cardiothoracic Surgery and accepted
for coronary artery bypass grafting.  On [**2163-7-8**] he was
brought to the operating room where he underwent coronary
artery bypass grafting x 3 with a left internal mammary
artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery,
saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal, and saphenous vein
graft to the posterior descending coronary artery.  He
tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the
operating room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.

The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period,
however after arrival into the intensive care unit the
patient began to experience some respiratory distress.
Anesthesia was called, and the patient's endotracheal tube
was replaced with relief of the respiratory distress.  The
patient remained ventilated on pressor support ventilation
throughout the rest of his postoperative day zero.

On the morning of postoperative day one he was weaned from
the ventilator and extubated without event.  He remained in
the intensive care unit throughout postoperative day one in
order to monitor his respiratory status.  During that time he
was hemodynamically stable.

On postoperative day two his chest tubes and central venous
access lines were discontinued and he was transferred from
the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit to five/six for
continued postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.  His
activity level gradually increased over the next several
days.

On postoperative day two he was also noted to have several
episodes of atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular
response between 140 and 170.  These episodes were treated
initially with Lopressor and after a second episode he was
started on amiodarone, given a 150 mg loading dose, and then
an intravenous infusion x 24 hours.  The patient converted to
sinus rhythm after his amiodarone loading infusion was
completed.  It was noted, however, that after being loaded
with amiodarone, when the patient was given Lopressor, he
suffered from heart block with a ventricular response between
30 and 40 beats per minute.

On postoperative day three the patient was again noted to
have an episode of atrial fibrillation with a ventricular
response of 140 beats/minute.  He was given 2.5 mg of
Lopressor intravenous, after which he blocked down to a rate
between 50 and 60.  The patient was tried on a p.o. dose of
Lopressor, 12.5 mg, however with that dose, he again blocked
down to a heart rate between 50 and 60 and experienced an
episode of complete heart block lasting approximately six
seconds.  At that time, Electrophysiology was called to
consult on the patient, and they recommended
electrophysiology testing, which both the patient and his
family agreed to.  Family agreement was necessary as the
patient was experiencing some postoperative confusion with a
nonfocal neurological examination.

On postoperative day five the patient was brought to the
Electrophysiology Laboratory where the underwent
electrophysiologic testing.  Please see the EP consultation
for full details.  In summary, the patient underwent EP
testing and implantation of an implantable
cardioverter-defibrillator pacemaker device.  He tolerated
this procedure well and was returned to five/six post
procedure to continue cardiac rehabilitation and
postoperative care.  Also on postoperative day five it was
noted that the patient had an episode of urinary retention
after his Foley catheter was discontinued.  He had 1,200 cc
in his bladder as postvoid residual.  This urine was sent for
urinalysis with culture and sensitivity.  It came back with
Pseudomonas, for which the patient was started on Zosyn upon
the recommendation of the Infectious Disease Service.

Over the next two days the patient remained on five/six.  His
activity level was gradually increased.  He remained
hemodynamically stable.  His urinary tract infection was
treated with intravenous antibiotics, and on postoperative
day seven he was deemed stable and ready for transfer to his
assisted-living facility for continuing postoperative
rehabilitation.

At the time of transfer the patient's physical examination is
as follows:  Vital signs - temperature 97.6, heart rate 68
and sinus rhythm, blood pressure 130/70, respiratory rate 20,
O2 saturation 97% on room air.  His weight preoperatively was
38; at discharge it was 34.6.

His discharge laboratory data shows a white count of 9,
hematocrit 30, posterolateral 104, sodium 136, potassium 4.3,
chloride 100, CO2 26, BUN 18, creatinine 0.9, glucose 119.

He was alert and oriented x 3.  He moved all extremities.  He
followed commands.  His breath sounds were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Heart sounds were regular rate and
rhythm, S1 and S2 with no murmur.  Sternum was stable.
Incision with staples was open to air, clean and dry.  His
left shoulder incision from automatic implantable cardiac
defibrillator was clean and dry with dry sterile dressing.
His abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended, normal active
bowel sounds.  Extremities were warm and well perfused with
no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  His leg incision had
Steri-Strips and was open to air, clean and dry.
