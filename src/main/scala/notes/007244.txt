Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus in the LA/LAA or the RA/RAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. No ASD by 2D or
color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch
diameter. Focal calcifications in aortic arch. Normal descending
aorta diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Resting bradycardia (HR<60bpm). Results
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the results on [**Known firstname 1439**]
before CPB

Post_bypass:
Preserved biventricular systolic function.
LVEF 55%.
Intact thoracic aorta.
Minimal MR and no AI.


Brief Hospital Course:
Transferred in from outside hospital after ruling in for non st
elevation myocardial infarction and cardiac catheterization.
Underwent preoperative evaluation including endocrine consult
due to hypertension and elevated hgba1c, and infectious disease
consult due to fevers.  Operation delayed due to community
acquired viral pneumonia, and medications adjusted for blood
pressure and blood glucose management.  On [**2137-12-16**] she was taking
to the operating room and underwent coronary artery bypass graft
surgery.  See operative report for further details.  She
received vancomycin for perioperative antibiotics.  She was
transferred to the intensive care unit for hemodynamic
management.  Her sedation was weaned off, she awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated without complications.
On post operative day one she was started on betablocker, lasix
for diuresis, and ace inhibitor for blood pressure management.
She continued to progress and was transferred to the floor.
Physical therapy worked with her on strength and mobility. By
post-operative day four he was cleared for discharge by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 914**] to a rehab facility.
