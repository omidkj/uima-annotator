Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CPAP

History of Present Illness:
56F with adult onset asthma ([**2151**], status post 3 prior
intubations with prolonged wean) and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD, 2L home O2, no home steroids),
obstructive sleep apnea, admitted to ICU [**2161-1-16**] for COPD
exacerbation. This is her second hospitalization this year for
respiratory distress and she requires home oxygen (2L per nasal
cannula) but not daily steroid therapy.  The patient complained
of shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion for one week with
acute deterioration on date of admission. She also had cough
productive of sputum. At her baseline, she has occasional
shortness of breath walking around the house and waking up short
of breath "is a routine thing."  She uses her albuterol inhaler
or nebulizer therapy daily and denies medical non-compliance. No
ill contacts, recent URI, or allergic trigger. She has seasonal
allergies and eczema. Denied pets at home.  She denied fever or
chills. She had no increased lower extremity edema, orthopnea,
or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnia, and no DVT risk factors. In the
ED, the patient was treated with combivent nebs, solumedrol 125
mg IV x 1, heliox  and eventually placed on non-invasive
positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). Arterial blood gas in the
ED was 7.34/56/64. The same  therapy was continued in the ICU.
Over the day prior to transfer to the medicine floor on [**1-21**], the
patient tolerated weaning from NIPPV/heliox to NC, spaced out
nebs every 6hrs, changed from IV to oral steroid therapy, and
tolerated an oral diet. ABG day of transfer 7.35/80/50.  In the
ICU, CXR was clear without evidence of pneumonia, edema, or
effusion. Sputum gram stain and culture was negative.

CXR:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2161-1-17**] 12:08 PM The cardiac size is

infiltrates. No significant change since prior film.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2161-1-16**] 2:38 AM The cardiac and
mediastinal silhouettes appear stable. There are no focal
pulmonary opacities, pleural effusions, or evidence of
pneumothorax. Slight prominence of the right cardiphrenic angle
probably represents a combination of lung markings and a
prominent fat pad. The osseous structures are unremarkable. No
evidence of pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
56 year old female with adult onset asthma and COPD on chronic
home O2 admitted to ICU COPD exacerbation and treated for 5 days
with mask ventilation, steroids, antibiotics, and
bronchodilators. Her respiratory status improved and she was
transferred [**2161-1-21**] to the medicine floor for further management.
.
Presentation with respiratory distress- The patient has long
history of prior tobacco abuse and developed a COPD flare while
on home oxygen with an unknown trigger. She likely has a
component of carbon dioxide retention considering her increased
carbon dioxide on arterial blood gases. Her respiratory status
improved during her ICU course which included solumedrol 125
tid. She was transferred to the medicine floor for continued
monitoring and therapy. Medications included [**Month/Day/Year 8895**], flovent,
albuterol INH, atrovent INH, atrovent nebs q6H, and albuterol
nebs. She has been afebrile without leukocytosis, recent
illness, or significant sputum production.  Chest x ray showed
no evidence of pneumonia or CHF and sputum culture was negative.
 Her clinical exam was significant for scattered expiratory
wheezing and prolonged expiratory phase. At discharge, her
pulmonary exam improved significantly and she lacked wheezing.
Ambulatory and resting oxygen saturations were appropriate at
approximately 95-98% at her home regimen of 2L nasal cannula
oxygen supplementation. She will finish a 2 week taper course of
oral steroids and 2 week course of oral levoquin that will end
[**2161-1-30**].
.
Obstructive sleep apnea: She refused nightly CPAP several
nights.  Her home regimen is 14mm per home regimen.
.
Diastolic CHF: The patient's CXR was without significant
effusions and did not improve after lasix 20mg IV given in the
ED. It's unlikely a component of her presenting respiratory
distress this admission. Her home regimen including lisinopril
40mg daily and aspirin was continued.
.
Diabetes - Her diabetes was well controlled on RISS and NPH
70/30 twice daily.
.
GERD - Protonix was continued.
.
The patient was discharged in good condition eating a
diabetic/cardiac health
