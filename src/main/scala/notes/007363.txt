Hospital last month with dyspnea on exertion and chest tightness
with walking. Denies peripheral edema, PND or orthopnea. There,
she ruled in for acute on chronic systolic congestive heart
failure and NSTEMI, with peak troponin of 5.3. Transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**], underwent cardiac cath revealing 2v disease (OM2 95%, RCA
100% likely chronic). She underwent successful PCI to the 90%
lesion in the proximal segment of the OM2 with 2.5x12mm
Integrity
bare metal stent on [**2116-2-3**]. She was evaluated by cardiac
surgery and was deemed to be of high risk for conventional
surgical AVR. After informed consent, she was screened for the
High Risk arm of the Corevalve/TAVI trial and was randomized to
Corevalve/TAVI.

TTE [**2116-3-11**]:Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
inferior akinesis and inferoseptal hypokinesis. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free
wall function. An aortic CoreValve prosthesis is present. The
transaortic gradient is normal for this prosthesis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Focal LV systolic dysfunction consistent with prior
inferior infarction. Normally functioning CoreValve prosthesis.
Mildly dilated right ventricle with borderline systolic
function.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2116-3-10**], a
CoreValve prosthesis is present. The function of the lateral
wall has improved. The right ventricle was probably mildly
hypokinetic/dilated on the prior study also.

[**2116-3-10**] Intra-op TEE preliminary report:
Conclusions
Pre implant

No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage. A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum
is seen at rest. A small secundum atrial septal defect is
present. There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with hypokinesia of the apex, apical and
mid portions of the anterior wall and the mid inferior wall..
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed
(LVEF= 40 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**1-13**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the results on
[**2116-3-10**] at 900 am

Post implant

Corevalve seen in the aortic position. It appears well seated.
There is trivial aortic insufficiency. There is mild mitral
regurgitation.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted on [**3-9**] for preadmission testing. Workup was uneventful
and she was cleared for [**Doctor First Name **]. Underwent a TAVI AVR [**Company 1543**]
Corevalve via mini sternotomy [**3-10**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**], and
transferred to the CVICU. She was extubated POD # 2. She had
sinus bradycardia and intermittent AFib.  No malignant
arrhythmias noted on telemetry thus far, and her baseline ECG is
unchanged from her pre-op LBBB.  Titrated her Coreg as tolerated
by her BP and HR. Transferred to the floor on POD #2 and she
continued to progress well. Pacing wires and CT were
discontinued without incident. Gently diuresed toward her preop
weight. Coumadin restarted for A Fib. Target INR 2.0-2.5.
Cleared for discharge to [**Male First Name (un) 4542**] [**Hospital 6252**] rehab on POD #6. All
questions and concerns addressed. Follow up appts made.
