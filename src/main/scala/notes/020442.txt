History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 39 y.o. man with history of ESRD on HD due to
FSGS, RCC with known brain, pulmonary, and hepatic metastases
s/p chemo and XRT, who presented to the MICU for hypotension.

Notably, he was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] yesterday to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5279**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
 On his last admission, he was sent to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypotension
which he developed during an MRI. There was concern that it was
a contrast reaction, although this was considered unlikely. He
also was found to have new ascites and progression of his
metastatic disease. His ascites was tapped, and given the 1600
neutrophils he was treated for SBP w/ ceftriaxone.

This morning, he was brought for dialysis. When he sat up for
dialysis, he became dizzy and hypotensive to the 80s. He was
unable to receive dialysis in this setting. He mother notes that
he may not have received all of his medications yesterday given
the gap between discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] and admission to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5279**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

He noted a new raspy voice since this morning, diaphoresis, and
a non-productive cough. He also reports that he hasn't had a
bowel movement in a week and a half and has had intermittent
abdominal pain. He also has had intermittent groin, leg, feet,
back, and collarbone pain. He denied fevers/chills, chest pain,
SOB, nausea/vomiting, and abdominal pain.

Due to his hypotension, he was brought to [**Hospital 47**] Hospital,
where they performed a CXR showing an infiltrate. He was started
on levaquin and vancomycin, given 1L NS, and he had a R IJ
placed. He became hypotensive to the 80s and hypoxic. However,
he was 100% on a non-rebreather mask. He was started on a
phenylephrine drip (2.5 mcg). He was then transferred to the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, VS: T 97.1, HR 96, BP 96/54, RR 26, O2sat 97%
2L NC.
Labs in the ED were remarkable for K 4.6, BUN 25, Cre 5.4, WBC
7.1, and Hct 28.7. CXR was concerning for a pneumonia.  He was
continued on phenylephrine and received 2g cefepime. Renal was
made aware and will see in the morning.

On arrival to the MICU, VS: T 97.7, HR 91, BP 120/84, RR 18,
100% on 4LNC. He had b/l crackles on pulmonary exam, and he had
a markedly distended abdomen and absent bowel sounds.

CXR [**8-26**]
The multifocal airspace opacities have overall slightly improved
in
the background of metastatic disease and mild pulmonary edema;
however, the right upper lobe opacity remains.  There is also
unchanged mild pulmonary edema.  The right IJ line ends in the
right cavoatrial junction.  No pneumothorax.
.
KUB [**8-27**]
NGS:  Three supine images of the abdomen show some stacking of
the small bowel.  This could represent ileus, but would also be
consistent with patient's history of ascites.  The loops of
bowel do not appear to be distended and there is no obvious
evidence of obstruction.  Given the supine nature of these
films, we are unable to assess for fluid levels or free air in
the abdomen.  Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable,
though these images are limited somewhat because of
underpenetration.
IMPRESSION:  Slight stacking of the small bowel which likely
represents ileus but may also be secondary to ascites.

Brief Hospital Course:
39 y.o. man w/ a history of ESRD on HD due to FSGS, RCC with
known brain, pulmonary, and hepatic metastases s/p chemo and
XRT, admitted to the MICU for hypotension which was likely a
manifestation of his chronic hypotension from loss of tone from
his metastatic disease burden, hypothyroidism, and hypovolemia.
The patient's condition deteriorated in the MICU, and after
discussion with the patient's family, we transitioned care to
comfort measures only.

Hypotension:
He had several potential etiologies for his hypotension. He does
have known baseline hypotension which may have worsened in the
setting of not receiving all of his doses of midodrine the day
prior to admission. He may also have been volume depleted in the
setting of not having air conditioning and becoming diaphoretic,
increasing his insensible losses. Hypothyroidism is a
possibility given TSH of 15.  Obstructive shock due to
metastatic disease/ascites is another possibility. Much less
likely was the development of septic shock from his possible
pneumonia found on CXR. Given his known pulmonary metastases, he
is at high risk for a post-obstructive pneumonia. Arguing
against sepsis was his lack of elevated WBC, lack of fever, and
lack of elevated RR. Also, CXR is generally improved since last
performed 1 week prior.  A cardiac cause was considered unlikely
given the lack of history and unremarkable EKG, but still
possible, especially given long history of dialysis and BNP of
4374. His ECHO revealed pulmonary HTN and biatrial enlargement.
Adrenal insufficiency was essentially ruled out w/ a cortisol of
22.6 [**2106-8-22**]. Overall, his presentation seemed to be most
consistent with rapid progression of his underlying metastatic
renal cell cancer with progres
