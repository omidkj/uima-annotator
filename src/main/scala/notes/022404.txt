membranes without lesions.  Lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Cardiac examination revealed heart was beating

IMPRESSION:  The patient was a 70-year-old male who was
referred for cardiac catheterization on [**2190-8-27**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:   Cardiac catheterization demonstrated
pulmonary artery saturation of 67.4%, cardiac output was 4.8,
with a cardiac index of 2.63, pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure was mean of 13, pulmonary artery diastolic was 12.
Left main coronary artery had a distal 10% occasional.  The
left anterior descending artery was okay.  The left
circumflex was 30% at the origin, the proximal was ulcerated
and 90% occluded.  A stent was placed in the left circumflex
artery with TIMI-III flow.  No complications.  He was
continued on Integrilin times 18 hours.

The patient was transferred back to floor; when, several
hours after catheterization, he developed an erythematous
rash and shortness of breath with oxygen saturations dropping
to the 80s with audible wheezes.

The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit for observation and airway protection.  Benadryl 25 mg
intravenously was given and Solu-Medrol 80 mg intravenously
was administered.  The rash continued to progress through the
thighs and upper arms.  Audible expiratory wheezes were
noted.  There was no stridor.  Albumin nebulizers were
administered with no change in wheezing.  Epinephrine 1:1000
0.2 mg subcutaneously was given with additional albuterol
nebulizers.  Arterial blood gas was 7.36/44/89 on 1 liter to
2 liters nasal cannula.  The patient remained tachypneic.
Racemic epinephrine 0.5 cc times two was administered by
nebulizer with improvement in the upper airway and expiratory
wheezing.

It was unclear what the etiology of the rash was.  Ticlid was
substituted for Plavix.  The patient remainder
hemodynamically stable throughout the episode.  He was
observed in the Medical Intensive Care Unit overnight with
good improvement in his tachypnea and rash.  Solu-Medrol,
Benadryl, and Zantac were discontinued.  He was continued on
Atrovent, on aspirin, and Ticlid, and he was transferred out
to the floor the next day.

The patient had no further episodes of wheezing.  He was seen
by Physical Therapy and walked without having a decrease in
oxygen saturations.  A chest x-ray was checked.  The patient
was discharged the following day to home.
