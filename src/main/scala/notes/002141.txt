History of Present Illness:
86 year old male with history of alcohol abuse, colon cancer
status post resection, and recent MI just discharged from
[**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on [**11-9**], who presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital
early this morning with shaking and confusion.  History is
mostly from the record as the patient is intubated and the wife
is a poor historian.  Per the wife, she says he was doing well
just after discharge, and was walking around as much as he
could.  She says he has not drank alcohol since he got home.
His only complaint has been profuse watery diarrhea, numerous
times a day, both in the hospital, and since discharge.
Otherwise he did not complain of chest pain, shortness of
breath, abdominal pain, fevers, or chills, prior to the day of
admission.

As mentioned above, he was recently admitted to [**Hospital 1474**]
Hospital from [**11-3**] to [**11-9**] after presenting with shaking.  He
was found to have a cardiac enzymes leak, and underwent p-MIBI
on [**11-8**] that demonstrated transient ischemic dilatation of the
LV with a small to moderate sized region of ischemia involving
the lateral wall, as well as a small to moderate fixed inferior
defect with hypokinesis suggestive prior infarction.  EF 50%.
No intervention was performed since he was in alcohol
withdrawal, and asymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint, however
plans were made for catheterization at [**Hospital1 18**] in the future.  He
was discharged home on a prednisone taper for unclear reasons.

On arrival at [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on the morning of admission,
vitals were T 104.3, HR 109, BP 116/59, 89% on 3L NC. His
hypoxia progressed and he was intubated.  His blood pressure
declined to the 70s systolic and he was started on
norepinephrine via a left femoral line placed in their ED.
Given concern for meningitis an LP was performed, demonstrating
140 rbcs that cleared by tube 4, 2 WBC in tube 1, and 1 in tube
4, total protein of 80, glucose of 100 (interpreted as
negative).  Gram stain was without bacteria or WBCs.  Labs were
notable for a leukopenia of 2.5, with 12% bands.  A UA had large
leukocyte esterase, positive nitrite, [**5-9**] WBC, and moderate
bacteria.  He received a dose of ceftriaxone 2 grams (prior to
negative LP), vancomycin 1 gram, and flagyl 500 mg IV x 1 given
concern for clostridium difficile (bandemia).  EKG demonstrated
ST depressions in V4-V6. BNP 53, troponin I < 0.1 and CK 35.  He
was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER because of lack of beds in the
ICU at [**Hospital1 1474**].

Vitals in our ED were T 104.8, HR 101, BP 75/47, RR 32, 99% on
ventilator (AC 550 x 20, 60%, PEEP 5).  He was continued on
norepinephrine, given 2.5 L IVF, and sent to the MICU.

Past Medical History:
1) CAD; ?MI, ?3VD:  Patient presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital in
early [**11-5**] with shaking and was noted to have a cardiac enzyme
leak.  A p-MIBI revealed transient ischemic dilatation.  He was
in alcohol withdrawal at the time, therefore he was started on
ASA, Plavix, Statin, and sent home with plans for
catheterization at [**Hospital1 18**] when able.
2) Type 2 diabetes
3) BPH
4) Alcohol abuse:  Drinks [**1-1**] gallon of Whiskey a week, per
wife.
5) Colon cancer status post resection, details unclear.


Social History:
Quit smoking 10 years ago, smoked heavily previously - wife says
he does have 1 cigarette a week.  Drinks [**1-1**] gallon of whiskey
per week.  Lives with his wife of 59 years.

Brief Hospital Course:
86 year old male with history of alcohol abuse, and recent MI
just discharged from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on Plavix on [**11-9**] with
steroid taper, who presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital early this
morning with shaking, confusion, and profuse diarrhea, found to
have significant bandemia, sepsis requiring norepinephrine, as
well as perihilar infiltrates and hypoxic respiratory failure
requiring intubation.

1) Sepsis:  Most likely sources were initially thought to be C.
Difficile and pneumonia, both nosocomially acquired.  He was
treated initially with vancomycin and zosyn (to cover nosocomial
pneumonia), and flagyl empirically for C. Difficile.
Subsequently, however, a blood culture from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital
returned with E. Coli, and his urine culture from [**Hospital1 18**] also
grew out E. Coli.  He was therefore ultimately felt to have
urosepsis.  Vancomycin and flagyl were discontinued, while zosyn
was continued.  He was weaned off of norepinephrine within 24
hours.  He had been started on stress dose steroids on admission
given that he had been on steroids for at least the last few
days prior to admission (prednisone 30), however these were
quickly tapered off.

2) Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Most likely secondary to an
early acute lung injury, which is compatible with his bilateral
perihilar infiltrates.  His ventilator settings were rapidly
weaned, and he was extubated 48 hours after arrival without
difficulty.  Unfortunately the patient had to be reintubated due
to aggitation and was on the ventilation for 5 more days.  He
was then weaned off the vent and extubated.  At this point his
family made the patient DNR/DNI.  The patient tolerated
face-mask oxygen delivery for 3 days and then again developed
respiratory distress and passed due to respiratory fail
