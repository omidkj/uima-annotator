Service:  Medicine

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83 year old
female with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, recently discharged
from the hospital earlier this month, who was brought to the
Emergency Room from rehabilitation with abdominal pain,
fevers and hypoxia.

The patient was recently transferred to rehabilitation, where
she had a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placed.
After the PEG tube was placed, there was note of abdominal
discomfort.  The abdominal discomfort occurred for more than
48 hours after the PEG tube was placed.  She also noted some
diarrhea as well.

The patient had previously been at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
[**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], treated for pneumonia amongst multiple
medical issues.  Upon arrival to the Emergency Room, the
patient was found to have free air under the diaphragm on an
x-ray, but this was thought to be secondary to the PEG tube
placement, no surgical process was noted on CT scan.

The patient was noted to be hypoxic with a 90% oxygen
saturation on a nonrebreather, and was taken to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit and treated for a multi-focal pneumonia.
She was treated with levofloxacin, vancomycin and Flagyl.
The patient was not intubated in the Intensive Care Unit.
She was also treated with Solu-Medrol for a pulmonary
process.  It was thought either to be infectious pneumonia
versus chronic lymphocytic leukemia infiltrate versus
congestive heart failure.  The patient's oxygen requirement
decreased and she was transferred to the medical floor.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Chronic lymphocytic leukemia with
a baseline greater than 200,000.  2.  Autoimmune hemolytic
anemia.  3.  Coronary artery disease, status post coronary
artery bypass grafting.  4.  Congestive heart failure with a
left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 65% with some
left ventricular hypertrophy and pulmonary hypertension.  5.
Diabetes mellitus.  6.  Hypertension.  7.  Hypothyroidism.
8.  History of lower extremity cellulitis.  9.  Spinal
stenosis.  10.  Pulmonary hypertension.  11.  Status post
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Lactulose 30 cc p.r.n., Lasix 40
mg p.o.q.d., cefuroxime 250 mg b.i.d., Tylenol #3, digoxin
0.125 mg q.d., folate 1 mg q.d., potassium chloride 10 mEq
q.d., Glucophage 500 mg q.d., Synthroid 100 mcg q.d.,
metoprolol 25 mg q.d., Zoloft 50 mg q.d., and Compazine 10
mg.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient was living at [**Hospital **]
Rehabilitation.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination on admission
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient had a
temperature of 102, heart rate 101, blood pressure 97/45,
respiratory rate 20 and oxygen saturation 91% on
nonrebreather and nasal cannula.  General:  Pleasant alert
female in mild distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:
Normocephalic, atraumatic, pupils equal, round, and reactive
to light and accommodation, extraocular movements intact,
oropharynx dry.  Pulmonary:  Rales throughout all lung
fields.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, II/VI
systolic ejection murmur at right sternal border, no rubs or
gallops.  Abdomen:  Positive bowel sounds, diffuse
tenderness, no rebound, guarding noted, PEG in place.
Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema, 2+ pulses.
Neurologic examination:  Alert and oriented times three,
cranial nerves II through XII intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  Admission white blood cell count was 263.4
with 100% lymphocytes, hematocrit 37.2, platelet count
47,000, prothrombin time 13.4, partial thromboplastin time
26.7, INR 1.2, sodium 129, potassium 5, chloride 93,
bicarbonate 26, BUN 35, creatinine 0.7, glucose 134, calcium
7.8, phosphorous 4, magnesium 1.8, lactate 2.3, amylase 139
and lipase 17.  Urinalysis was negative.  Arterial blood
gases:  pH 7.46, pCO2 38 and pAO2 46.  Chest x-ray showed
worsening multi-focal pneumonia and free air under the
diaphragm.  Abdominal x-ray was a poor quality film, free air
not visualized.  CT of abdomen and pelvis showed bilateral
consolidations, lymphadenopathy, cystic kidney, no fluid,
unobstructed.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit and then was transferred to the
floor on [**2153-3-6**].

1.  Pulmonary:  The patient was treated for multi-focal
pneumonia with levofloxacin, Flagyl and vancomycin.
Solu-Medrol was added for possible chronic lymphocytic
leukemia infiltrate.  The patient had previous bronchoscopy
on last admission with broncho-alveolar lavage positive for
[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 564**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**].  This was not treated as per the infectious
disease team recommendation.

The patient was initially on a nonrebreather and eventually
titrated down to six liters of nasal cannula, with her last
oxygen saturation being about 85%.  The patient was made
comfort measures only on [**2153-3-7**] and antibiotics were
discontinued.  Oxygen was continued as needed for comfort.
The patient was made "Do Not Resuscitate"/"Do Not Intubate"
earlier in her Medical Intensive Care Unit stay.

2.  Infectious disease:  The patient had a multi-focal
pneumonia, initially treated with levofloxacin, Flagyl and
vancomycin, which were then discontinued when she was made
comfort measures only.  She also had one out of four positive
blood cultures for yeast and received one dose of
amphotericin on the evening of [**2153-3-6**].  This was
discontinued and, at the time of dictation, there is no
identification of the yeast from the positive blood culture.

3.  Cardiovascular:  The patient was initially hypotensive in
the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  She was supported with
intravenous fluids and had a central line in place.  She did
not require any pressors or resuscitation.

4.  Endocrine:  The patient was continued her Synthroid and
was continued on a regular insulin sliding scale until she
was made comfort measures only.  She was hyponatremic, which
was beginning to resolve prior to her change in code status.

5.  Hematology/oncology:  The patient has a history of
chronic lymphocytic leukemia and autoimmune hemolytic anemia.
She was transfused some platelets in the Intensive Care Unit.
She did not require any other transfusions.

6.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient is status post a
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement, with
abdominal pain currently.  The PEG tube has not been used and
the patient has been allowed to eat and drink as tolerated.

7.  Code status:  The patient was initially placed in the
Medical Intensive Care Unit and was not intubated.  Her code
status was determined to be "Do Not Resuscitate"/ "Do Not
Intubate".  On [**2153-3-7**], she was made comfort measures
only and antibiotics and other therapy was withdrawn.  The
patient was kept comfortable.
