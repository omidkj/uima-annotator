History of Present Illness:
44 year old female with morbid obesity, asthma, OSA on CPAP,
chronic lympedema for the last 10 years on clindamycin
suppresive therapy, admission for hypoxia ([**Date range (1) 58794**]) thought to
be [**12-30**] OSA/obesity hypoventilation and most recently admitted
with cellulitis and Group G strep bacteremia last week
(discharged on four week course of IV [**Month/Day (2) 26204**]) who presents with
wheezing.  History was difficult to ascess as pt was
intermittently altered on arrival, but it appears that the
wheezing began earlier last night and gradually worsened.  She
says that it was similar to her previous reaction to nafcillin
and asthma exacerbations.  She denies any fever, chills, no HA
,change in vision, neck pain, no cough or CP, abd pain, dysuria
and no change in edema or redness of her legs.
.
In the ED her intial oxygen saturation was 85% with a RR of 28
and lung exam with diffuse wheezing. In the ED she was given
combivent, albuterol, benadryl, famotidine, Vancomycin and lasix
40 mg IV.

9. hiatal hernia
10. Ventral hernia repair [**2177**]
11. Exploratory laparotomy and salpingo-oophorectomy for ectopic

Brief Hospital Course:
44 year old female with morbid obesity, asthma, obstructive
sleep apnea, obesity hypoventilation on night time BIPAP,
chronic lymphedema [**12-30**] to presumed cellulitis for the last 10
years on clindamycin suppresive therapy admitted with hypoxemic
and hypercarbic respiratory failure.

#Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure with hypoxemia/Obesity
Hypoventilation/Obstructive Sleep Apnea/Acute on Chronic
Diastolic Heart Failure:
Before pt became altered she was able to communicate that she
developed wheezing earlier in the day. She then became more
somnolent and was admitted to the MICU. Her ABG showed Co2
retention and an A-a oxygen garadient. She was put on BiPAP,
nebulizers and diuresed with IV lasix. Her respiratory and
mental status rapidly improved and she was transferred to the
floor. The etiology of her respiratory failure was felt to be
acute on chronic diastolic heart failure on top of her substrate
of chronic lung disease due to asthma, obesity hypoventilation,
and OSA. Sh was diuresed 4L during admission without change in
renal function or electrolytes and she was discharged to rehab
off oxygen. Given her recurrent admissions for respiratory
failure and it may be worthwhile to be more aggressive with her
outpatient heart failure diuretic regimen as there are few other
options for preventing recurrent episodes of respiratory failure
once adherence to night time BIPAP is maintained. Patient was
counseled on the importance of wearing her BIPAP every night
during admission as well. Patient was not felt to have pneumonia
and was not treated with antibiotics.

#Chronic lower extremity edema/Lymphedema:
She has a history of chronic lower extremity edema and recurrent
cellulitis although as above it is unclear if all this edema is
due to lymphedema vs. volume overload from heart failure. She
did have erythema in her lower extremities, particularly over
the right shin which raised some concern for cellulitis. She was
started on vancomycin to cover her previously diagnosed strep
bacteremia as well as potential new cellulitis as she reported
difficulties with [**Month/Day (2) 26204**].
.
#Group B strep bacteremia: She had GBS bacteremia diagnosed on
her prior admission for which she was treated with penicillin.
However patient reported problems with [**Name2 (NI) **] in the past so this
was switched to vancomycin per ID recommendations. Her course
will last for at least two more
