Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Dilantin Kapseal

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1943**]
Chief Complaint:
Missed dialysis/Respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IV Fistulagram
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
63 y/o F w/ ESRD [**2-21**] IgA nephropathy s/[**Name Initial (MD) **] failed CRT [**2173**] on HD
(MWF) through LUE AVF since [**2193**], p/t ED w/ n/v/diarrhea and at
least one episode of bloody stools and ILI Sx w/ worsening SOB x
2-3d. Because she was not feeling well, she missed HD today. She
was unable to provide further hx in ED.

Initial ED VS: T 97.8 HR 80 170/78 18 94 % 2L

Exam was notable for tachypenic ill-appearing F w/ nonfocal abd
tenderness L basilar crackles and an irregularly irregular
tachycardic heart rate to 145. CXR was consistent with B/L
patchy infiltrates concerning for PNA vs. volume overload. Labs
showed K of 6.5, Cr 8.6. Telemetry showed several runs of NSVTs
and pt was symptomatic w/ nausea. She then began to have
sustained runs of VTs; EKG showed hyperacute T waves in V3-V5,
wide complex tachycardia, and LBBB w/ poor R-wave progression.
She received a total of 5g IV calcium gluconate, 10u regular SC
insulin, kayexalate and 1 amp IV glucose. Cardiology was
consulted and felt arrhythmia was [**2-21**] hyperkalemia and renal was
consulted for stat hemodialysis given hyperkalemia and VT. She
did not become pulseless, but as she had increasing tachycardia
and tachypnea, rapid sequence intubation with rocuronium
(instead of succinylcholine given hyperkalemia) and etomidate
was performed in the ED. As EJ blew during intubation, R-
femoral CVL was placed for access. Pt was initially placed on
lidocaine gtt for tachycardia which was changed to esmolol gtt.
Pt also received CTX for presumed PNA on CXR.

VS: afebrile, 145, 145/66 100% on AC 350 x 20,PEEP 5 FiO2 50%

In the MICU, emergent HD was initiated.

Past Medical History:
1. Atrial fibrillation/flutter: first diagnosed in [**Month (only) **]
[**2195**].
2. End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis secondary to IgA
nephropathy s/p cadaveric kidney transplant in [**2173**] which has
eventually failed, and started on hemodialysis in [**2193**].
3. History of upper GI bleeding on [**2195-2-20**] with evidence
of
esophagitis, gastric ulcer, and bleeding duodenal vessel s/p
clipping, cauterization and PPI.
4. Diastolic heart failure supported by an echocardiography from

[**2195-12-21**]. Clinically asx.
5. History of malignant hypertension, which was complicated by
seizure on [**2193-5-20**]. Not on antiepileptic meds. Denies h/o CVA.

6. Depression.

No family history of early MI, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies, or
sudden cardiac death; otherwise non-contributory. Her father
died at the age of 80. Her mother died at the age of 64 from

[**2198-3-6**] Blood culture- NGTD

STUDIES:
[**2198-3-5**] EKG: Baseline artifact. Possible atrial flutter with
variable block,  predominantly 3:1. Leftward axis. Left
bundle-branch block. Prominent precordial T waves. Since the
previous tracing of [**2196-12-17**] the atrial tachyarrhythmia is new.
The QRS complex is wider. Left bundle-branch block pattern is
new. Clinical correlation is suggested.

[**2198-3-5**] CXR: Portable upright AP chest radiograph is obtained.
There is central pulmonary vascular congestion and mild
pulmonary edema. Small right pleural effusion is noted. No
pneumothorax is seen.

IMPRESSION: Findings compatible with congestive heart
failure/fluid overload.

[**2198-3-6**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF 65%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests
an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2195-12-22**], the findings are similar. The acoustic
texture of the left ventricular myocardium suggests an
amyloid-type infiltration, as does the stiffness of the
myocardium. Findings consistent with restrictive cardiomyopathy.


[**2198-3-7**] R Neck Ultrasound: No focal fluid collection or abscess.
Expansion and increased echogenicity of the right
sternocleidomastoid muscle relative to the left, which may
reflect myositis, of indeterminate etiology. Adjacent prominent
cervical nodes may be reactive. However, followup imaging
following resolution of symptoms is suggested to ensure
resolution of findings.

[**2198-3-9**] CXR: Small bilateral pleural effusions have both
decreased. Substantial residual consolidation is present at the
left lung base, and altho
