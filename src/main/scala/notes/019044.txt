Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1990**]
Chief Complaint:
Fall, pelvic and hip fractures

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Intramedullary nailing, hip fracture with TFN nail.
2. Close treatment lateral compression pelvic fracture.


History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 86 yo F who was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 **] after
admission for diarrhea and dehydration, presumed to be IBD,
complicated by DVT/PE s/p IVC filter on heparin with transition
to coumadin, to [**Hospital1 100**] MACU yesterday.  She returns after a fall
with increasing O2 requirement.
.
Around 5am this morning, pt's bed alarm went off.  She was found
on the floor halfway in sitting position, back against the wall.
 Her right leg crossed over left, and right leg was shorter and
externally rotated.  Pt did not have LOC.  She denied any head
trauma.  Pt was complaining of a lot of hip pain.  VS:  150/78,
60, 22, 91% on RA, 97% on 2L NC.  Patient cannot remember
events.
.
In the ED, initial VS were:  98 95 142/100 29 94.  Pt was noted
to have an increasing O2 requirement.  Pt was 91% on RA at
[**Hospital1 100**], 88% on 2L, 93% on 5L, 98% on NRB here.  Other vital
signs were stable.  EKG showed new downsloping T waves and TWI
in V2.  Cardiac enzymes were CK 17, trop 0.09 (stable from
previous admission).  CT head showed no IC hemorrhage but new
left mastoid air cell opacification (infection v. trauma).  CT
C-spine showed no fracture or dislocation.  Hip x-rays felt to
show R-sided hip fracture and L-sided superior and inferior
pubic rami fractures.  Pt is ordered for CT pelvis.  She
received 2mg IV morphine for pain.

Imaging:
CT head:
1. No intracranial hemorrhage.
2. New opacification of the left mastoid air cells, correlate
clinically
since infection or trauma can be etiologies. In the appropriate
clinical
context could consider a temporal bone CT for further
evaluation.
.
CT C-spine:
IMPRESSION: No fracture or dislocation of the cervical spine.
.
FEMUR:
1. Acute displaced right hip intertrochanteric fracture with
varus
angulation.
2. Fractures of the left superior and inferior pubic rami
fractures with
surrounding callous formation previously described [**2132-2-8**].
.
CT PELVIS:
Multiple osseous fractures as described. Given the paucity of
callus
formation about the right femoral intratrochanteric fracture and
the presence of associated edema in the overlying soft tissues,
this fracture is felt to be acute. The left parasymphyseal and
pubic rami fractures, and the multiple sacral fractures listed
above, all demonstrate extensive callus formation and do not
have adjacent soft tissue edema. Constellation of findings
represents acute on chronic injuries.
Interval resolution of bowel wall thickening previously seen to
involve the hepatic flexure.
Atherosclerotic disease involving the visualized large vessels.
Saccular
aneurysm of the distal aorta remains unchanged.
.
CXR:
There is interval worsening of pulmonary edema with bilateral
pleural
effusions that appears to be unchanged. The cardiomediastinal
silhouette is stable, but there is interval worsening of left
retrocardiac consolidation that is most likely due to worsening
atelectasis. There is no evidence of Pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION:
Interval progression of currently moderate pulmonary edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 86 yo F with HTN, osteoporosis, recent DVT/PE (diagnosed
last week), admitted with multiple fractures following fall at
rehab with increased oxygen requirement. Now post-op and WBAT
bilaterally. Also had NSTEMI [**3-17**] demand pre-op, and small
amounts of melanotic stool with subsequently stable Hct.
Coumadin restarted and INR>2.
.
# Recent DVT/PE: first diagnosed during previous hospitalization
one week prior to this one.  Pt s/p IVC filter placed during
recent admission. Therapeutic INR at the time of discharge. INR
should be checked daily and coumadin dose adjusted accordingly
for the first week.  On the day of discharge, she resumed her
previous dose of 5mg QD. INR at d/c is 2.1; goal is [**3-18**].
.
# Hypoxia:  Patient has known recent acute PE, discharged on 2 L
NC from last hospitalization. Hypoxia was felt to be related to
worsening pulmonary clot burden (thrombotic or fat embolus)
though patient has IVC filter in place and therapeutic on
heparin) or hypoventilation from pain/narcotics.  There was no
evidence of pneumonia or on CXR; but some pulmonary edema and
atelectasis noted. After transfer ftom the MICU to the floor,
her oxygen saturation improved from 93% to 97% on 2 liters. Pt
advised to use incentive spirometry, but needs to be frequently
reminded to use it [**3-17**] baseline dementia.
.
# R femoral intratrochanteric fracture, left superior and
inferior pubic rami fractures, right sacral fractures.  Pt
underwent intramedullary nailing by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1005**] on [**2132-5-26**].
She was started on low dose beta-blocker for perioperative
optimization which
