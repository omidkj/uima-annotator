Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1493**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension (referred from liver clinic)
hyperglycemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Persantine MIBI [**2176-12-10**]
L Subclavian Central Line Insertion [**2176-12-19**]


History of Present Illness:
HPI:  53-yo-man w/ end stage cirrhosis was referred from clinic
for hypotension.  He was feeling well until 3 days ago, when he
began to feel lethargic.  His fatigue continued until today,
when he presented to Liver Clinic for evaluation and had SBP
67/30, prompting referral to the ED.  He denies any recent
fever, chills, chest pain, palps, dyspnea, abd pain, dysuria,
polyuria, polydipsia, melena, and hematochezia.  He does c/o
non-productive cough since this AM.
.
In [**Name (NI) **], pt appeared clinically dehydrated w/ temp 97.4, BP 83/45,
HR 62, O2 sat 97% RA.  CXR demonstrated RML/RLL infiltrates
concerning for PNA.  He was treated w/ levaquin 500mg IV, flagyl
500mg IV, hydrocortisone 100mg IV, and 5L IV NS.  BP remained in
the 80s/40s, w/ nadir 66/45 despite IV fluids.  He was started
on dopamine gtt through peripheral IV to maintain MAP>60, and
MICU was called for eval.
.
On Transfer to the floor:
While in the MICU, pt was on Dopamine gtt until [**12-22**] and
hydrocortisone 100 mg IV q 8hr from [**2181-12-18**]. Echo revealed nl
EF, r/o cardiac cause of hypotension. FeNa was 0.07%, thus it
was felt pt likely had dehydration. The pt had glucose of 500s
on admission (no prior h/o DM) and was started on insulin gtt,
later titrated to glargine and SSI with [**Last Name (un) **] input. The pts Na
of 119 on admission corrected after fluids.
.
Today pt denies SOB, CP, n/v. States he has had 2 BM today. No
BRBPR. No f/c/s. No cough. Denies dizziness upon standing.

multifocal pneumonia/aspiration. 2. Findings concerning for
fluid overload.

appearance of pancreatic cystic lesion. 3. Cirrhosis and small
amount of ascites in the left pericolic gutter. Findings
consistent with known cirrhosis.

MIBI ([**2176-12-10**]): Normal myocardial perfusion with normal wall
motion and ejection fraction at lower limit of normal at 44%. Of
note, the visual inspection of the gated images demonstrate a
normal ejection fraction.

Echo [**2176-12-21**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function
are normal (LVEF 60-70%). The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no

Brief Hospital Course:
Brieflyl, this is a 53 yo M w/ h/o EtOH cirrhosis on the
transplant list, chronic pancreatitis with DM, anemia, admitted
w/ hypotension refractory to fluids, hyperglycemia,
hyponatremia, and thrombocytopenia.
.
#Hypotension:  Likely due to hypovolemia and infection.
Initially it was felt that the most likely etiology of the pts
hypotension was his cirrhosis, but possible other etiologies of
acute change included distributive (septic), cardiogenic and
hypovolemic. There was initial suggestion of infection with CXR
findings and lactate of 2.9, but the pt was afebrile with only
mild nonproductive cough and good UOP.  The pt had no signs of
SBP, and per hepatology services the pt did not meet criteria to
require paracentesis.  The pt was started on levofloxacin and
flagyl on [**12-18**] in the case of pneumonia (given new CXR
infiltrates). Again, in the workup of his hypotension, TTE on
[**12-21**] revealed good EF. A component of hypovolemia/dehydration
was also suspected, supported by clinical exam and FeNa of
0.07%. The pt received a dose of steroids in the ED.  While in
the MICU, pt was on Dopamine gtt until [**12-22**] and hydrocortisone
100 mg IV q 8hr from [**2181-12-18**]. The pts dopamine gtt was
discontinued prior to transfer to the floor.   The pts diuretics
and nadolol were held throughout his stay.
.
# PNA:  Given the pts new cough, elevated WBC, and CXR
infiltrates, the pt was started on levofloxacin and flagyl IV on
[**12-18**].  The pt was discharged with levofloxacin and flagyl po to
complete a 14 day course in the case of a postobstructive
etiology (given the pts RLL lung mass).
.
#RLL lung mass: Followed as outpt.  Identified on CT initially
in [**12-12**].  PET scan pending as outpt on [**12-30**].
.
#. Cirrhosis/ascites: The pt has end-stage cirrhosis [**3-13**] EtOH,
on transplant list but deferred pending w/u of lung mass.
Hepatology services followed the pt throughout his stay.  The
pts bilirubin was elevated throughout this admission (21 on
admission, baseline 3)w/ no evidence of obstruction; but RUQ US
did not have good view of CBD. The pt is extremely jaundiced.
Alk phos, ALT/AST  were wnl.  The pt has chronic ascites [**3-13**]
cirrhosis.  UNa was less than 10 with U osm 577 c/w low
intravascular volume. The pt was continued on rifaxamin 400 mg
tid and lactulose 30 cc TID. He did not show signs of
encephalopathy during his stay on the floor.
