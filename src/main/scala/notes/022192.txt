Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation on [**6-13**]

History of Present Illness:
74 year old female with CAD, dCHF, and CKD presented to an OSH
today after calling EMS complaining of severe shortness of
breath.  On arrival to the ED the patient was found to be
tachycardic to 148, BP 140/58, 81% with EKG concerning for
possible VTach.  Patient does have known LBBB at baselie.  The
patient was emergently intubated for respiratory failure and was
given a 150J shock x1 for possible Vtach though rhythm strips
from the OSH were unavailable on transfer.  In addition, the
patient was bolused with Amiodarone and started on an amiodarone
drip.  A CXR showed diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates so
the patient was also given a dose of ceftriaxone/azithromycin as
well as IV lasix for posisble fluid overload.  A bedside TTE was
performed which, per report, showed a reduced EF of
approximately 30-35% at the OSH as well.  Initial cardiac
enzymes were negative.   An ABG shortly after intubation was
7.15/45/66/16/86% and she remained difficult to ventilate
requiring 100% FiO2 and PEEP 20.  Given her continued acidosis
on the vent, the patient was given 1 Amp of sodium bicarb while
in the ED.  Given the patient's complicated presentation, newly
reduced EF, and possible cardiogenic shock, the patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for further management and possible
intervention.

In the MICU, repeat TTE showed global LV systolic dysfunction w/
EF of 30%. Cardiac enzymes were trended and continued to rise,
last trop of 0.52, CK of 7559, MBI 1.6. She was initially
started on a heparin gtt due to concern for ACS, though this was
later thought to be more consistent with a metabolic
process/sepsis, and the heparin gtt was discontinued. Also, on
review, rhythm was most likely consistent with SVT w/ abberancy,
not VT. Amiodarone was discontinued.
.
Of note, patient had worsening of her chronic kidney disease
from a baseline creatinine of 1.5 up to 2.7 thought to be
secondary to hypoperfusion. She had a borderline UA at the OSH
showing protein and blood without ketones or glucose. Abdominal
US was performed to look at kidneys which were unremarkable.
.
She was also initiated on an insulin gtt due to persistently
elevated BS in the 400s and significant AG acidosis on
admission, now well controlled with a closed gap. No ketones or
glucosuria.
.
The patient was extubated on day 6 of hospitalization, and
developed flash pulmonary edema thereafter.  Was placed on home
bipap regimen. Serial chest x-rays showed resolution of
infiltrates, although congestion present.  Diuresis was started
with diuresis goals of 1 to 1.5 L.  Hydralazine and isosorbide
were started.  Echo was repeated on [**6-18**] and EF had improved to
55%.  For CAD the patient was continued on aspirin, statin, and
metoprolol 75 mg tid.  The white count improved, trending down
from 17.7 to 13. She completed a 7 day course of vanco and zosyn
for hospital acquired pneumonia.  All cultured obtained at [**Hospital1 18**]
were negative, urine culture from OSH grew out E coli and
Klebsiella sensitive to cipro. Patient was afebrile. Following
antibiotic course, patient was re-cultured after antibiotics
were discontinued.  Stool was sent for c-difficile.
The patient had several episodes of afib with RVR.  Beta
blockers were titrated up to lopressor 75 mg TID for rate
control and amiodarone IV drip was restarted for further nodal
block.  Was then switched to PO amiodarone 200 [**Hospital1 **] and was in
sinus rhythm.  Acute renal failure also continued to resolve
with Cr near baseline (was 1.5).  Was transfered to the floor
cardiology service for further management.

On review of systems was unattainable due to patient being
intubated.
