54 year old male with a
history of aortic stenosis and aortic arch aneurysm, who was
admitted for fevers, myalgia and positive blood cultures.  Pt
has
had symptoms since [**Holiday 1451**] which PCP felt was viral. Had
worsening of symptoms and wasd started on Tamiflu and blood
cultures drawan.  Sent to ED from PCP for positive blood
culutres. ECHO revealed vegetation on aortic valve. Now
consulted
for surgical intervention of AS/AI and endocarditis

PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is markedly dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage. No thrombus is
seen in the left atrial appendage.
2. A patent foramen ovale is present. A left-to-right shunt
across the interatrial septum is seen at rest.
3. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
4. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
5. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic root. The
ascending aorta is moderately dilated. There are simple atheroma
in the ascending aorta. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly
dilated.
6. The aortic valve is bicuspid. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is moderate aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 1.4 cm2). Moderate to severe (3+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. A probable root abscess is seen close to
the aorto-mitral junction.
7. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including phenylephrine and is
being AV paced

1. A well-seated bioprosthetic valve is seen in the aortic
position with normal leaflet motion and gradients (mean gradient
= 8 mmHg).Trace washing jets are seen.
2. Bi ventricular function is unchanged.
3. Arch and descending aorta appear intact post decannulation.
4. Other findings are unchanged.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the results


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
operating room on [**2166-2-13**] where he underwent aortic valve
replacement, ascending aorta replacement, patch closure of
aortic root abscess, maze procedure, and left atrial appendage
resection with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**].  Please see op note for further
details.  Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU on propofol and
phenylephrine in stable condition for recovery and invasive
monitoring.  POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and
oriented and breathing comfortably.  He was neurologically
intact and hemodynamically stable, weaned from vasoactive
support.  Beta blockade and diuresis were initiated and the
patient was transferred to the telemetry floor.  Chest tubes and
pacing wires were discontinued without complication.  Physical
therapy worked with the patient on post-op mobility and
strength.  Anti-coagulation was started with coumadin/heparin
bridge for mechanical valve.  Post-op course was uneventful and
the patient was discharged home on POD 6 with INR 2.2.
