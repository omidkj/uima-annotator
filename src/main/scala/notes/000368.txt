Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 16983**]
Chief Complaint:
recurrent pneumonia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC, left arm


History of Present Illness:
Briefly, this is a 65 year-old F with COPD who has been admitted
to an OSH 3 times in the past 2 months for a RLL pneumonia/
consolidation. She initially presented 2 months ago with RLL
PNA, and returned one month ago with RLL and lingular PNA. She
underwent bronchoscopy on [**7-2**] at which time BAL cultures were
negative and cytology from the washings was negative. A CT of
the chest was reportedly without malignancy. She most recently
returned to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital 8 days after discharge ([**7-12**]) with
increasing cough, sputum production, and left sided rib pain
which started two days
prior to presentation. A CT again showed mass-like consolidation
in the lingula with interval increase in size since the previous
film, RLL atelectasis and dense consolidation which is
unchanged, stable
mediastinal adenopathy, and an acute left 7th rib fracture. A
PPD placed at [**Hospital3 **] was negative according to their records.
She was started on zosyn on [**7-12**]; after sputum cx grew out MRSA
she was started on vancomycin on [**7-15**]. She was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] on [**7-18**] for further work-up and management of her
recurrent pneumonias. She had a repeat bronchoscopy on [**7-22**],
cytology from which revealed BAC.
While her current exacerbation was considered to be due to
infection, the pt was felt to have poor underlying lung function
from involvement of her tumor and therefore was started on
tarceva.
.
In the MICU the patient had waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] respiratory status
and required a NRB. SHe was never intubated. Currently she is on
70% face mask. She continued to be treated for hospital acquired
pna with vanc/levo/flagyl. While the bronchoal lavage cx was
negative but a sputum cx grew MRSA. The pt was also found to
have new ARF with a creatinine of 1.5, which was thought to be
prerenal and resolved with IVF. Her chest pain was felt to be
due to a rib fracture and was treated with dilaudid.
.
The pt is now transfered for further management of her BAC. She
is currently on 6L NC with intermittent episodes of SOB and a
dry cough and denies CP, nausea, vomiting

Bronchial lavage:[**7-23**]

  Suspicious for non-small cell carcinoma.

  Scattered single cells and loose clusters of cells with high
  nuclear cytoplasmic and nuclear membrane irregularity,
  nucleoli and chromatin clearing.

  These findings are suspiciuos for non-small cell carcinoma,
  possibly bronchioloalveolar type
.
Chest CT w/ contrast [**8-6**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Improving right lower lobe consolidation and lymphadenopathy.

2. Improving left basilar atelectasis.

3. Stable suspicious mass in the lingula. A nearby area of
well-marginated ground-glass opacity may be inflammatory or also
raises suspicion for malignancy. The opacities are unchanged.

4. New mixed patchy ground glass and consolidative opacity in
the superior segment of the left lower lobe, which could be
infectious, inflammatory or due to aspiration.

5. No evidence of bony metastases, but several rib fractures,
which are unchanged in retrospect.

6. Pneumobilia, which could be seen in prior sphincterotomy.

7. Suspicious renal lesion not imaged.
.
Brain MRI:IMPRESSION: Mild-to-moderate brain atrophy. No
evidence of acute infarct or abnormal enhancement. No evidence
of mass effect or hydrocephalus.
.
Bone Scan: IMPRESSION: 1. Two adjacent areas of focal increased
tracer uptake in the left
lateral 7th and 8th ribs consistent with fractures. 2.
Nonspecific increased
tracer uptake within the right 6th posterior and 7th lateral
ribs. Given the
findings in the contralateral ribs, this tracer uptake may also
be due to a
trauma; however, correlation with cross-sectional imaging (CT
scan) could be
used for further evaluation if clinically indicated.
.
CT Abdomen/pelvis: [**7-26**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Complete consolidation of the right lower lobe, which may be
filled with fluid (perhaps related to recent lavage),
hemorrhage, or tumor. This appearance is rather extensive for
BAC, however, it is possible. No focal masses are identified
within the consolidated lobe.
2. Spiculated mass within the lingula with associated left hilar
lymphadenopathy is highly concerning for malignancy.
3. Vague airspace opacities at the left posterior lung base and
medial aspect of the right middle lobe may represent infection
or less likely tumor.
4. 1.3 cm soft tissue lesion within the right kidney which may
represent a hemorrhagic cyst, or renal cell carcinoma. Recommend
further evaluation with MRI.
5. Three hypoattenuating lesions within the liver are likely
cysts, however, attention should be paid to these on future
exams to ensure stability.
6. Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
7. Moderate centrilobular emphysema.
.
TBBX:

Atypical mucinous glands, highly suspicious for
bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma, mucinous type.


Brief Hospital Course:
63F with recurrent pneumonias, htn was transfered on [**7-17**] from
an OSH after 3 hospitalizations for RLL pneumonia in the last 2
months. The next hospitalization found RLL and Lingular PNA. A
BAL on [**7-2**] was negative for bacteria or atypical/malignant
cytology. On the most recent admission, Ms. [**Known lastname 56012**] was found
to have sputum positive for MRSA. The patient was at home for 8
days with 2.5 L continous oxygen requirement with dyspnea on
excertion. On [**7-12**] the patient returned to the hospital with
excruciating laft sided rib pain that developed over 3 days that
was though to be secondary to severe coughing. Admission CT was
postive for RLL a persistent RLL consildation, left lingular
process, and 7th rib fracture. Ms. [**Known lastname 56012**] was treated with
Zosyn starting [**7-12**] and vancomycin on [**7-15**] following a sputum
positive for MRSA on [**7-1
