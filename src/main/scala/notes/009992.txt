THIS IS A DISCHARGE SUMMARY ADDENDUM FROM THE DATES OF [**2147-5-14**] UP UNTIL DATE OF DISCHARGE, [**2147-5-23**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  Fluid and electrolytes:  The patient was initially found
to be severely hyponatremic of unclear etiology.  She was
free water restricted and her sodium slowly increased.  She
later became hypernatremic and was recorrected with free
water.  Throughout the rest of her hospital course, her
sodium remained stable within a normal range.  She had some
mild evidence of heart failure during her stay and received
very small doses of Lasix, which she responds vigorously too.
She then auto-diuresed during the later part of her hospital
stay.

2.  Pulmonary function:  She had a pneumothorax thought to be
related to left subclavian line placement.  She had an
initial chest tube placed, which was pulled after
pneumothorax had resolved on chest x-ray and there was
minimal chest tube output.  During follow-up chest x-ray's
there was no evidence of pneumothorax.  She was initially
intubated for respiratory support, and then extubated.
Because of questions of her neurological status, she was
reintubated to facilitate brain imaging and was later
extubated.  She did well post extubation, but did have
occasional episodes of desaturations into the low 90s.  Her
desaturations were thought to be likely due to mucous
plugging as she has significant secretions.  During her
desaturation, she was ruled out for pulmonary embolism and
has been on deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.  She was
aggressively suctioned and continued on albuterol and
ipratropium plus Mucomyst nebulizers and continued with chest
Physical Therapy. She likely has chronic emphysematous
changes due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and will
continue with nebulizers and chest Physical Therapy at
rehabilitation.

3.  Infectious Disease:  She was initially treated with a ten
day course of levofloxacin and Flagyl for a suspected
pneumonia.  She also received several days of vancomycin for
a [**2-10**] positive blood culture bottles with enterococcus sensitive
to  vancomycin from her arterial line.  Her arterial line
was later discontinued and she no longer had growth in
follow-up blood cultures bottles and her vancomycin was then
discontinued.

4.  Mental status/neurological:  As she was initially found
down, there was concern for a CVA, but her initial CAT scan
of the brain was negative.  Later in the hospital course, she
was noted to have anisocoria, and there was concern that she may
have a CVA or other brain stem injury and/or brain metastases.
Neurology was consulted and a MRI was done showing no significant
abnormalities.  There was a question of possible seizure
activity, which may possibly affect her occasional respiratory
desaturations. She was placed on Dilantin and an
electroencephalogram was done showing findings consistent with
metabolic etiology, however, she was continued on Dilantin and
will follow-up with Neurology as an outpatient for outpatient
electroencephalogram and reassessment of her Dilantin therapy.

5.  Lung nodule:  She has a history of a right middle lobe
lung nodule prior to admission, as well as some associated
weight loss.  Bronchoscopy was performed which was negative
for malignant cells.  She will follow-up with her primary
care physician for further evaluation of this lung nodule.

6.  Cardiac function:  Patient was found to have an
intermittent left bundle branch block during her admission
which was initially confused for non-sustained ventricular
tachycardia on telemetry and electrocardiogram.  Her
outpatient cardiologist was [**Month/Day (2) 653**] and prior
electrocardiograms did not show these changes.  She was noted
to have an initial elevated troponin during her admission,
but this was felt to be in the setting rhabdomyolysis after
she was found down and not thought to be related to
myocardial ischemia.  During her hospital stay, she had
several repeat enzymes drawn showing no evidence of
myocardial infarction.  Cardiology was consulted.  It was
thought that patient's left bundle branch block was likely
rate related.  She did have evidence of some T wave
inversions in the inferior and lateral leads.  There was
questions of angina or ongoing ischemia.  She had a
transthoracic echocardiogram, as well as a stress dobutamine
echocardiogram that did not show evidence of wall motion
abnormalities or reversible defects.  Her ejection fraction
echocardiogram was 50% and on her dobutamine echocardiogram
was 45%.  It was thought that she did not have evidence of
significant ischemia on cardiac imaging and she should
continue with medical management with an aspirin,
beta-blocker and statin.  She will follow-up with her
cardiologist as an outpatient.

7.  Chest pain:  Patient complained of constant chest pain
during her hospital course, which is sharp and substernal.
This pain is reproducible on deep palpation of her sternum
and thought to be related to her history of arthritis.  It is
likely chronic costochondritis.  It was not thought to be
related to cardiac ischemia.  She will continue treatment
with Tylenol and NSAIDs for this chronic chest pain.

8.  Depression:  Patient was evaluated by Psychiatry who
agreed that patient likely had elements of depression.  She
was continued on her SSRI.  It is thought that her
medications may be changed to Remeron if her depression does
not improve as an outpatient.

9.  Code status:  The physician covering for patient's
primary care physician was [**Name (NI) 653**], who established that
patient had prior wishes of "Do Not Resuscitate" and "Do Not
Intubate" prior to her hospital admission.  These wishes were
not known at the time of admission.  After the patient was
extubated and her mental status returned to baseline, she
then stated her wishes of "Do Not Resuscitate" and "Do Not
Intubate."  Psychiatry was consulted who felt that patient's
depression was not effecting her judgement and she was stated
to be "Do Not Resuscitate/ "Do Not Intubate."

10.  Access:  A left arm PICC was placed on [**2147-5-23**]
which is followed into the SVC.

11. Nutrition:  Patient was initially placed on tube feeds
while intubated and they were slowly advancing her diet.  She
had been followed by Nutrition throughout her hospital
course.

12. Glaucoma:  Patient was placed on her previous eye drops
after her outpatient ophthalmologist was [**Year (4 digits) 653**].  She will
have her blood pressure and heart rate monitored, as well as
systemic blood pressure medications have beta-blocking
activity.

13. Prophylaxis:  The patient was placed on a proton pump
inhibitor, given Maalox prn, placed on a bowel regimen, as
well as subcutaneous heparin for deep vein thrombosis
prophylaxis.  She will continue on subcutaneous heparin until
fully ambulatory.

14.  Severe deconditioning:  Patient had a prolonged hospital
course with severe weakness and deconditioning. She will need
several weeks to months of Physical Therapy to return to a
functional status with even minor activity, she notes
worsened complaints of costochondritis chest pain and
worsening shortness of breath thought to be related to this
sever deconditioning.
