HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Baby Girl [**Known lastname 174**] is the 38 and
[**2-12**] week gestational infant, admitted with respiratory
distress.

MATERNAL HISTORY:  Mother is a 31 year-old, Gravida II, para
I to II woman.  Past medical history is notable for
adenocarcinoma (in-situ).  Prenatal screens were as follows:
A positive, antibody negative, Hepatitis B surface antigen
negative.  RPR nonreactive.  Rubella immune.  GBS unknown.

ANTENATAL HISTORY:  Estimated date of delivery was [**2190-5-26**]
for an estimated gestational age of 38 and 1/7 weeks.
Pregnancy was uncomplicated.  It was a repeat Cesarean
section under general anesthesia.  Rupture of membranes was
at the time of delivery which yielded clear amniotic fluid.
There was no intrapartum fever or other clinical evidence of
chorioamnionitis.

NEONATAL COURSE:  Neonatal Intensive Care Unit team was not
initially in attendance at delivery.  Infant was bulb
suctioned and [**Last Name (un) **] suctioned.  Neonatal Intensive Care Unit
was called for grunting respirations.  Apgars were 8 at one
minute and 9 at five minutes.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  Physical examination on admission revealed a
birth weight of 4060 grams.  Head circumference 37 cm. Length
53.3 cm.  Infant was on CPAP with saturations of 95% in 30%
FI02.  Heart rate of 124.  Respiratory rate of 60's to 80's.
Temperature 96.8.  Blood pressure 56/36 with a mean blood
pressure of 52.  Anterior fontanel was open and soft.  Infant
was non dysmorphic appearing.  Palate was intact with a
normal neck and mouth.  Normocephalic.  CPAP in place.
Chest with mild intercostal retractions, good breath sounds
bilaterally and scattered, coarse crackles.  Cardiac
examination revealed a well perfused infant with normal S1
and S2, no murmur.  Normal femoral pulses.  Abdominal
examination:  Soft, nontender with the liver felt 1.5 cm
below the right costal margin.  No splenomegaly.  No masses.
Active bowel sounds with a patent anus.  Genitourinary
examination revealed normal female genitalia.  Neurologic
examination revealed an alert, active infant, responsive to
stimulation with normal tone.  Moving all extremities
symmetrically.  A normal suck, root and gag.  Symmetrical
grasp reflexes.  Skin examination was normal as well as
normal spine, limbs, hips and clavicles.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Respiratory:  Chest x-ray was obtained on admission which
   demonstrated bilateral interstitial opacities. Infant was
   initially placed on CPAP.  Follow up chest x-ray on day
   of life number two revealed continued bilateral opacities,
   more consistent with neonatal pneumonia.  Infant continued
   on CPAP until day of life number four when she was
   transitioned to nasal cannula.  She slowly weaned on her
   nasal cannula until day of life number seven when she was
   successfully weaned to room air and maintained saturations
   greater than 95%.

2. Cardiovascular:  The patient was without a murmur.  She
   was hemodynamically stable throughout her admission.

3. FEN:  The patient was initially started on intravenous
   fluids secondary to tachypnea and respiratory distress, at
   60 cc per kg per day.  On day of life number three, she
   was allowed to begin feeding either formula or breast milk
   and she is currently feeding Similac 20 calories per ounce
   in an ad lib fashion. Weight at the time of discharge is
   3820 grams.

4. Gastrointestinal:  Patient had a bilirubin on day of life
   number 5 of 17.  At this point, double phototherapy was
   started.  Bilirubin on day of life six was 11.8.
   Phototherapy was discontinued on day of life seven and
   rebound bilirubin [**Location (un) 1131**] was 6.6.

5. Infectious disease:  The patient was initially started on
   Ampicillin and Gentamycin, given respiratory distress.
   CBC was obtained which was benign and blood cultures were
   obtained which remained negative.  Due to continued
   presence of bilateral interstitial infiltrates as well as
   continued respiratory distress, the patient was treated
   with Ampicillin and Gentamycin for seven days for
   presumed pneumonia.  A lumbar puncture was obtained on day
   of life number five which was reassuring.

6. Sensory:  A hearing screen was performed prior to discharge
   and was passed.
