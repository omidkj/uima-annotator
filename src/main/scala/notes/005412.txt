History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 43 yo M with Hx of EtOH Cirrhosis, discharged from
[**Hospital1 18**] on [**8-6**] after a long hospital course.  The patient
suffered a tib/fib fx that was complicated by compartment
syndrome.  He underwent multiple surgeries including fixation,
fasciotomies, wound debridement and skin grafts.  The final
surgery occurred on [**8-1**] and included a washout with placement
of a wound vac and skin graft.  While in the hospital, he did
withdraw and required transfer to the ICU for close monitoring.
Additionally, he was treated with an extended course of
cefazolin while his wounds were open (from [**7-24**] on), which was
changed to vancomycin for several days when blood cx 1/2 bottles
were positive for coag negative staph on [**7-30**].  No further blood
cultures were positive, and antibiotics were stopped on the day
of discharge when the patient's wound vac was removed by
orthopedic surgery.  The patient had a complicated discharge -
was initially going to be d/c'd to rehab, but ended up going
home to his girlfriend's house.

Per the patient's family, he was at home but was not properly
dressing his wounds.  Yesterday, was seen by his mother but
seemed "loopy."  Today, his sister came to see him in the
morning and found him febrile and altered.  He also reportedly
smelled of EtOH.  She called 911 and he was taken to [**Hospital1 **].  At OSH, initial vitals were T 102.8, BP 111/58, HR
120, RR 20, 96% on RA. Labs were notable for WBC 12.9, 89% PMNs
and no bands, Hct 25.8, Plt 161, Lactate 5.8.  He was given
Tylenol, MVI, Vanco 1000 mg IV.  Reportedly also given CTX and
3L IVF, but no documentation of this found.  He was then sent to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS were:  T97.7, HR 100, BP 121/80, RR
24, 97% on 4L. Labs were notable for a lactate 1.9, Hct 25.5.
Urine tox positive for benzos.  CXR showed a RLL infiltrate.
Ortho was called and did not think his RLE wounds looked
particularly infected.  He was given Zosyn and an unclear amount
of NS and admitted to the MICU for further management.

On arrival to the MICU, the patient was somnolent, but aroused
to loud verbal stimuli.  Not answering specific questions.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 43 yo M with history of alcoholic cirrhosis and
current alcohol abuse, as well as recent hospitalization for
tib/fib fx complicated by compartment syndrome requiring
multiple skin grafts and surgeries who presents with fever and
altered mental status.

Active Diagnoses
# AMS: The patient presented to the ICU somnolent, likely in the
setting of pain medication/alcohol intoxication and Pneumonia
causing hepatic encephalopathy (given his background of
cirrhosis). He was treated with thiamine, folate. Treatment for
the infection outline below. He returned to baseline mental
status overnight before transfer to the floor, where he remained
stable without any neurological findings or deficits.

# Pneumonia: The patient presented febrile with likely pneumonia
given his B/L lower lobe infiltrates.  Given his recent long
term hospital stay for his tibia/fibula fractures and associated
events, he was coverd broadly for HCAP with vancomycin and
zosyn.  Considerations were also made for aspiration pneumonia
given his history of altered mental status and the appearance of
the chest x-ray. He will complete his IV antibiotic course on
[**2194-8-17**].  Per ortho, it was unlikely his fever was related to his
right lower extremity surgical wounds (described in detail
below).

# Surgical site wounds: The patient has a recent surgical wound
of right lower extremity after a recent tibia/fibula fracture
that was complicated by compartment syndrome and subsequent
surgeries including fixation, fasciotomies, wound debridement
and skin grafts. Orthopedic surgery evaluated and felt the
incisions were not infected although there was swelling and
serous drainage from graft site. He already covered with broad
spectrum vancomycin/zosyn as above and continued on lovenox. The
patient was touch down weight bearing on right extremity as
recommended by orthopedic surgery.

Chronic diagnoses
#Alcoholic Cirrhosis: The patient's liver enzymes were elevated
during time of admission but decreased to levels consistent with
his previous hospital stay.  Patient plans to followup with
outpatient Liver specialist to discuss treatment options.  He
did not require lactulose or othe
