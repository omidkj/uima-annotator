 [**Name (NI) **], there was a tendency for patient to go into an
idiopathic arryhtmia after 4-6 hours on trach mask.  Although
she remained hemodynamically stable throughout these events,
they were uncomfortable for the patient and neccesitated
abortion of vent wean.  Cardioloy was consulted and they
recommended Amiodorone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] for 1 week (starting [**6-20**]),
then Amio 400mg QD x1 wk, and finally amio 200mg QD. Vent wean
was also delayed by a large amount of agitation/anxiety during
wean.  Patient was on benzodiazepines pre-op for anxiety,
supplementing these during wean appeared to help wean attempts.
