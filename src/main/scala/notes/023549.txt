Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2880**]
Chief Complaint:
Wide complex tachyacardia, V-Fib arrest s/p fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardioversion

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4640**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo M CAD s/p MI, CHF, A-FIB, CVA and recent
history notable for V-tach with hypotension who presented to OSH
with syncopal fall and hip fracture. Per report, pt was found to
be in wide complex tachycardia (irregularly irregular to 180s),
was given digoxin that put him into pulseless VT arrest at the
outside ED.  He was shocked then given amiodarone and
resucitated with no neurological sequalae.  After this he was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for hip surgery with support of cardiac
anesthesia.
.
Pt was hospitalized earlier this month for V-tach with
hypotension and was shocked twice. EP was consulted for
possibility of device insertion, however patient refused. Pt was
taking Digoxin at the time, which was discontinued due to
concerns regarding its pro-arrhythmic side effects. Patient was
also noted to be intermittently in a fib/flutter, but was not
anticoagulated due to history of GI bleed and questionable
sensitivity to aspirin.
.
On the evening of [**8-22**], he went into sustained mom[**Name (NI) **] wide
complex tachycardia, felt to be consistent with VT vs. 2:1
block. He received Metoprolol 5 mg IV, amiodarone 150 mg IV x 2,
then Lidocaine 50 mg IV, and Lidocaine 100 mg IV, all without
response. Electrolytes were checked at the time, with K 4.1 and
Mg 1.9; he received 2 grams of IV magnesium sulfate. He then
received a third bolus of 150 mg IV amiodarone and was
transferred to the CCU. He has been hemodyanically stable
throughout with SBP's in mid-80's to 90's.
.
Cardiac review of systems was notable for absence of chest pain,
shortness of breath, palpitations, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
orthopnea, ankle edema, or lightheadedness.

<b><u>OTHER STUDIES<u><b>
ECG on Presentation [**2161-8-22**]: Regular wide complex tachycardia -
suggests ventricular tachycardia Since previous tracing of the
same date, regular wide complex tachycardia with different QRS
morphology now present
.
ECG on [**2161-8-26**] (day of surgery): Baseline artifact.
Supraventricular bradycardia. Intraventricular conduction delay
of left bundle-branch block type. Low limb lead voltage. Since
the previous tracing of [**2161-8-25**] probably no significant chnge.
.
ECG on [**2161-8-31**] (day prior to discharge) revealed wide complex
sinus rhythm with left axis deviation and aberrant conduction.
Rate was 62.  Stable lateral ST depressions.
.
<b><u>RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES<u><b>
CXR shortly after presentations ([**2161-8-23**]):
IMPRESSION: Stable examination. Persistent nodular density
projected in
lower right lung. Widening of the superior mediastinum
consistent with known goiter.

Intraoperative fluoro images during ORIF of L hip [**2161-8-26**]
revealed placement of a short intramedullary rod into the left
femur with a screw
entering the femoral head.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4640**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male with a h/o ischemic cardiomyopathy,
atrial fibrillation, recurrent VT, and CVA who presents with
left hip fracture, now transferred to CCU in sustained VT
.
1) Rhythm: Patient presented s/p syncope likely due to cardiac
arrhythmia. He arrived to OSH in irreg, irreg rhythm with HR
180's, followed by pulsess VT after administration of IV
digoxin. He was shocked x 1, which resulted in NSR. On arrival
to [**Hospital1 18**], he was in NSR, then in slow atrial fibrillation.  The
patient had a history of recurrent VT arrests probably mediated
by scar from old MI.  On day of arrival he went into sustained
VT that was refractory to Metoprolol 5 mg IV, amiodarone 150 mg
IV x 2, then Lidocaine 50 mg IV, and Lidocaine 100 mg IV.
Eventually, patient was converted with electrical cardioversion
and started on a procainamide drip.  He was continued on this
drip and remained in sinus rhythm.  On the day after his ORIF
([**2161-8-27**]) he was converted to dofetilide in the hope of
establishing him on an oral [**Doctor Last Name 360**] that he could take at home.
His QT interval remained stable on this medication, but he did
begin to periodically go into A fib with RVR that was responsive
to IV beta blocker and increases in his oral dose of nodal
agents.  Unfortunately, the patient went into a wide complex
tachycardia on [**2161-8-30**] that was initially thought to be afib with
RVR and eventually read as VT.  He became hypotensive at this
time so he once again had electrical cardioversion.  His
Dofetilide was stopped and he was once again loaded with
amiodarone.  He remained stable on this regimen until the day of
discharge with only two periods of NSVT of three to four beats
on the night prior to discharge.  Plan is to continue amiodarone
load for total of seven days and then go to a daily dose.
Patient will be discharged on a cardiac monitor to assess for
further VT events.  Should the patient continue to have VT
events would proceed to ablation and PPM placement if patient
continued to be willing to do this.  Patient had been on
clopidogrel and ASA for CVA prophylaxis given paroxysmal afib,
but clopidogrel was held due to hematuria in the hospital in
setting of multiple anticoagulants (see below).
.
2) CAD: The patient had a history of MI in [**2129**] which was
medically managed.  His aspirin and clopidogrel were held for
surgery and restarted afterward.  Clopidogrel eventually had to
be held again due to hematuria.  Beta blocker was stopped on
presentation due to procainamide and hypotension but was
restarted after surgery.  Mr. [**Known lastname **] blood pressure would not
tolerate carvedilol while on additional anti-arrythmics so he
was switched from this to metoprolol during this
hospitalization.  Cardiac enzymes were checked at presentation
given arrythmia, but these were completely flat leading the
treating team to be confiden that this arrythmia was not
mediated by an ACS.
.
3) Pump: Patient has chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy with
systolic heart failure. ECHO earlier this month demonstrated EF
30%. Patient appeared euvolemic throughout his hospitalization.
Daily weights were stable.  He was maintained on low sodium
diet.  His beta blocker and ACEi were initially held due
