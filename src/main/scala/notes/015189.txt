EKG ([**2149-6-3**]):
Atrial fibrillation. Low voltage in the limb leads. Left
bundle-branch block. Occasional ventricular premature beat.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2149-9-13**] left bundle-branch
block has appeared.

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**2149-5-27**]):
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is 16-20
mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed with
inferior/inferolateral akinesis and septal hypokinesis. The
right
ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function appears depressed. There is abnormal septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

ETT ([**2144-8-14**]):
This is a 57 year old man here for the evaluation of dyspnea.
The
patient received .142mg/kg/min IV Persantine over 4 minutes.
There was no chest, arm, neck or back pain. There were no ECG
changes. The Persantine was reversed with 125mg Aminophylline
IV.
The rhythm was atrial fibrillation. The blood pressure and heart
rate responses were appropriate for the infusion.
No Persantine-induced perfusion abnormalities.  Global
hypokinesis suggestive of cardiomyopathy, with EF of 23%.  A
follow up rest study may be useful to assess for subtle
myocardial perfusion changes.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Hypotension:
Likely cardiogenic versus septic. Patient presented with a
history of CHF with low EF; CVPs were elevated with low to
normal SV02 which points more to the former. If this was septic
shock, the most likely source is the heel ulcler, although the
WBC was normal and the patient remained afebrile. In the setting
of diarrhea and recent antibiotics, c.diff colitis was possible,
but, again, the lack of WBC elevations made this less likely
(also did not appear to be having loose stools during
hospitalization time).  Aggresively volume resuccitated.

Initially on dopamine alone with dobutamine and levophed added
at 2100 on [**6-4**]. Both dopamine and dobutamine were off two hours
later (2300) with levophed continuing. On [**6-5**] was transitioned
to neosynephrine and vasopressin and the levophed was turned off
(1700). When pressures fell to the 60s systolic, dopamine and
dobutamine were added back (2100). The dobutamine was again on
for just a short time (~3 hours) as his pressures seem to fall
with this inotrope. Neosynpephrine and vasopressin were also
both weaned and the patient remained on dopamine alone until he
was transferred to the CCU.  There it was aggressive diuresis
and the patient improved from a cardiovascular and renal
standpoint.  Additionally the dopamine was weaned.  The patient
remained on pressors as he was hypotensive in their absence.
After discussion with the family, it was determined that all
cardiosupportive medications be withdrawn

For the possible septic shock, vancomycin and zosyn were used.
Culture data were unrevealing, although a call to the OSH showed
that the patient had been given antibiotics without any cultures
having been drawn. The patient remained on empiric antibiotics
throughout the CCU course until it was determined that all
supportive and therapeutic measures be withdrawn.

2. Lactic acidosis:
During the admission, the patient's lactate rose dramatically
(1.5 on admission to 10). A resulting large anion gap acidosis
resulted (pH as low as 7.16 with AG
