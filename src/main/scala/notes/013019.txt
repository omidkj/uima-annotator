Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Forty-nine year old man with
small cell lung cancer diagnosed in [**Month (only) 404**] of this year
status post chemotherapy and external beam radiation as well
as brain metastasis recently excised, who presented to the
Emergency Department with worsening hypoxia.  No new
complaint of cough, chest pain, lightheadedness, nausea,
vomiting.  He had no diarrhea and no abdominal pain.  Patient
has baseline change in mental status, but no acute change in
mental status.

In general, the patient has denied complaints of shortness of
breath, but it seems from the history that he had significant
compromise in respiratory function.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. History of small cell lung cancer diagnosed in [**2198-11-28**] complicated by small cell carcinoma syndrome status post
chemotherapy, four cycles of cisplatin, etoposide.
2. Status post excision of a brain metastasis.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Thirty-five pack years tobacco smoking, quit
one year ago, occasional alcohol, and no IV drug use.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. OxyContin 40 p.o. b.i.d.
2. Decadron 2 mg p.o. t.i.d.

ALLERGIES:  Amoxicillin.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was originally admitted to
the medical floor and found to have a pneumonia.  Was started
on appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis, but continued to
develop worsening hypoxia requiring use of BiPAP.  This
necessitated transfer to the Intensive Care Unit, where he
was continued on alternating face mask and BiPAP with
generally good sats.

However, during his first day in the Intensive Care Unit,
patient suddenly suffered a cardiac arrest.  Initially, he
became hypoxic and appeared to be seizing, and was found to
be unresponsive with no pulse.  Initial rhythm was
ventricular fibrillation.  The patient had a very prolonged
resuscitation period, rhythm oscillating between ventricular
fibrillation, PEA, asystole, torsades and ventricular
tachycardia.

Patient remained in ventricular tachycardia and torsades for
about 30 minutes receiving multiple shocks at least 10.
Eventually able to maintain a supraventricular rhythm.
Patient intubated during arrest, paralyzed and cooled off to
decrease the effects of V-fib arrest.

On the following day, sedation was weaned off and palliatives
were stopped.  Patient had minimal to no movement on his own.
 He had occasional agonal breaths and was nonresponsive to
commands.  The patient had no corneal reflexes.  Discussion
with his family was initiated, and it was felt that the
patient had stated that he does not want to live if he does
not go back to his normal status.  Patient's family felt that
he clearly expressed he does not want to be a vegetable or
does not want to live with any artificial support.  Given his
poor prognosis suffering a prolonged over 30 minute cardiac
arrest, and the slim chances of any recovery combined with
the natural course of his illness, the family decided it was
best to withdraw care in accordance with the patient's
wishes.  This was done on [**8-23**], and patient expired
peacefully in the company of his family.
