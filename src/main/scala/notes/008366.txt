[**2147-12-12**] CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast
IMPRESSION:
1.  Increased size of pleural effusions, ascites and diffuse
anasarca.

2.  New dilation of the distal pancreatic duct  in the tail (new
since [**2146**]), with stable atrophy involving the distal pancreas.
Small amount of fluid adjacent to the body of the pancreas,
which was seen in [**2147-11-6**]. Findings may be related to acute
on chronic pancreatitis, however exclusion of an underlying
neoplasm is recommended. An EUS can be performed for further
characterization as at this time MRCP seems impractical.

3.  Enhancing nodular area within the head of the pancreas
measuring 8 mm is unchanged from [**2146-9-5**], could be a
neuroendocrine tumor. This can be assessed at the time of EUS.

4.  Slightly thickened and edematous duodenum and jejunum may be
from
duodenitis/jejunitis versus third spacing.

5.  Gallstones.

6.  Heterogeneous enhancement of the kidneys suggest underlying
medical renal disease.

[**2147-12-12**] EGD
Ulcers with overlying eschar in the first, second, and third
part of the duodenum Normal mucosa in the antrum (biopsy)
Erythema in the gastroesophageal junction and lower third of the
esophagus compatible with esophagitis
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

[**2147-12-13**] Video/barium swallow
1.  Unchanged mild narrowing of the distal esophagus.
Otherwise, normal
caliber esophagus.

2.  Ineffective primary peristaltic contraction followed by
tertiary
contractions.

[**2147-12-14**] CXR (portable)
FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the bilateral
pleural
effusion have substantially increased in extent and severity.
Effusions are now more extensive on the left than on the right.
Mild pulmonary edema is present.  Areas of atelectasis are seen
at both lung bases.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.
Unchanged appearance of the right PICC line



Brief Hospital Course:
64 yo male with hx of ETOH, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tears and fatty liver
p/w weakness at home with associated poor PO intake initially
admitted to the MICU with hypotension requiring pressor support.
He improved and was transferred to the floor for sometime before
decompensating again immediately post-thoracentesis. He returned
to the MICU and was reintubated. He was dependent on three
pressors and persistently hypoxemic and acidemic despite
ventilatory support, showing signs of multi-organ system
failure. Care was withdrawn per the family's wishes and patient
expired on [**12-16**].

# Hypotension/Shock- Patient noted to have hypotension of
unclear etiology which has failed to improve with the
administration of IVF and initially requiring pressor support on
admission. There is clearly a component of volume depletion as
the patient is visibly dry on exam.  No clear infectious source
to suggest a septic picture (normal WBC, nml CXR, nml UA,
effusion on exam but exam not c/w a septic joint). The patient
does have a history of hypothyroidism but reports compliance
with levothyroxine therapy.  No hx of bleeding and HCT is stable
from previously
