Chief Complaint:
motor cycle collision/polytrauma

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
41yo man with unknown medical history s/p motorcycle crash. Per
EMS report the patient was not helmeted, was thrown vs. fell
15-20 feet from vehicle. On the scene GCS was 3, attempted
intubation was unsuccessful. He was taken to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
Hospital where again per report the patient's GCS was 14 however
he was combative with changing mental status and was thus
intubated. He received 2L NS and 1gm Ancef at the OSH. He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for management given concern for worsening
mental status and potential intracranial injury.

On arrival to the ED patient was moving all extremities and
agitated. On exam, a head laceration was noted as well as L
shoulder and hand abrasion; also a small amount of blood at the
left external auditory canal was noted. On imaging,
non-displaced posterior rib fractures, small L frontoparietal
subgaleal hematoma and soft tissue swelling were noted. Labs
were significant for acidemia (pH 7.28), lactate 2.4. Per
patient's family, alcohol abuse has been a long-standing issue,
as well as opiate abuse. He was on suboxone for detox but was
unable to afford the medication and abruptly stopped. He
attempted to supplement with alcohol to avoid withdrawal,
drinking a bottle of vodka and several beers daily. His last
drink was the morning prior to the accident.

[**2152-8-3**]:  cheat x-ray:

FINDINGS: Underlying trauma board partially obscures the view.
Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained.
Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 2.8 cm
above the carina. Nasogastric tube side port is at the level of
the proximal gastric fundus/GE junction, distal aspect not
included on the image, suggest advancing so that the side port
is well within the stomach. The left costophrenic angle is not
included on the images.
Given this, known bilateral dependent opacities likely
representing
aspiration, better evaluated on CT. No definite focal
consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is
seen. No displaced fracture

[**2152-8-3**]:  head cat scan:

 IMPRESSION:

Left frontoparietal soft tissue swelling with no evidence of
acute
intracranial process

[**2152-8-3**]:  cat scan of sinus and mandible:

 IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute facial fracture.
2. Mucosal thickening in the ethmoidal air cells is likely
related to
intubation. Mucus retention cysts are visualized in bilateral
maxillary
sinuses

[**2152-8-3**]:  cat scan of the c-spine:


FINDINGS: There is no evidence of prevertebral soft tissue
swelling or acute cervical spine fracturs. Multiple small
well-corticated osseous fragments are visualized
anterior/adjacent to C5, C6, and C7 vertebral bodies and are
likely not from acute trauma (602B:36). Normal cervical lordosis
is maintained.
Visualized soft tissue structures are within normal limits.
Proximal aspect of endotracheal and nasogastric tube seen. The
included lung apices are clear

[**2152-8-3**]:  cat scan of abdomen and pelvis:

IMPRESSION:
1. Small amount of fluid of possible intermediate density in the
right
superior mediastinum which is of nonspecific etiology but may be
secondary to venous injury. Aorta and other great vessels are
normal in caliber and
contour. Followup is recommended. No acute abdominal or pelvic
injury.
2. Nondisplaced posterior left fourth and fifth rib fractures.
Nondisplaced left scapula fracture.
3. Bibasilar opacities, likely related to aspiration, underlying
contusion
can not be entirely excluded.
4. NG tube terminates at the gastroesophageal junction/proximal
fundus.
Further advancement is recommended so that it is well within the
stomach.
Additionally, there is fluid in the distal esophagus which
raises risk for
aspiration.
5. Bladder wall appears diffusely thickened, which is
nonspecific in the
setting of underdistension. Correlate with urinalysis to exclude
infection.
Trauma is unlikely. No pelvic free fluid or pelvic fracture
seen.
6. Fatty liver.

[**2152-8-3**]:  x-ray of left humerus:

IMPRESSION: Fracture of the infraglenoid ridge of the left
scapula.

[**2152-8-20**]:  chest x-ray:

IMPRESSION: Multifocal atelectasis, but coexisting pneumonia in
the lower
lobes is possible.
