Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1267**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion, angina

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2132-1-28**] Cardiac catheterization
[**2132-1-31**] Four Vessel CABG(LIMA to LAD with vein grafts to OM,
DIAG, and PDA). RF MAZE Procedure. Ligation of Left Atrial
Appendage.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 61 year old gentleman with a history of
hyperlipidemia,  smoking (quit 2 months ago), and a family
history of CAD.  He reports that he has had jaw pain associated
with dyspnea for the past few weeks.  He was seen by PCP and
sent for a stress MIBI on [**2132-1-25**], the resting portion was
completed and he was noted to be in atrial fibrillation, the
stress test was terminated and he was seen by his PCP who
started him on Warfarin and Atenolol and sent cardiac enzymes.
Troponin T returned elevated at 0.16 and he was sent to the ED.

On further questioning, the patient has had this jaw pain for
about a year.  It occurred only with exertion and never with
rest.  Only in the last few weeks was it associated with dyspnea
and this was what prompted him to seek medical attention. In the
ED , VS were T 97.9 P 97 BP 116/63 RR 16 O2 96 RA his isolated
troponin was 0.16 (CK 124 MB 4), no significant ekg changes, TSH
was wnl, he was started on Heparin, Aspirin, beta blockade
administered.  He was subsequently admitted for further
evaluation and treatment.

Past Medical History:
Hypercholesterolemia, Atrial Fibrillation, s/p Disc/Back Surgery

Social History:

ETOH. He is married and is a semi-retired carpenter.

Pertinent Results:
[**2132-1-26**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. LV systolic function appears mildly to
moderately depressed (ejection fraction ?40-45%?). There is
inferior hypokinesis. Views are technically suboptimal for
assessment of regional wall motion. Right ventricular chamber
size is normal. Right ventricular systolic function is
borderline normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
[**2132-1-28**] Cath: Coronary angiography in this right dominant system

demonstrated an LMCA with 40% ostial and 30% distal stenoses.
The LAD
was moderately calcified with a 70% ostial lesion and a 60%
mid-vessel
stenosis. The LCX was mildly calcified with a 30% stenosis at
its origin; the proximal-mid portion of the LCX had a complex,
ulcerated 80-90% stenosis just before the origins of the OM1 and
the major OM2. The RCA was proximally occluded just after the
conus branch; there was minimal filling of the acute marginals
via vasa collaterals. LVEDP was mildly elevated at 16 mmHg
consistent with mild diastolic dysfunction. Left
ventriculography showed mild global hypokinesis with calculated
ejection fraction of 50%.
[**2-5**] CXR: The patient is status post median sternotomy with
sternal wires and clips. There has been interval removal of a
right internal jugular central venous catheter. The cardiac
silhouette remains stably enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar
contours are within normal limits. The pulmonary vasculature is
normal and there is no pneumothorax. A small right pleural
effusion appears slightly larger than on prior exam. There has
been interval decrease in size of a small left pleural effusion.
Linear atelectasis at the left lung base has decreased. There
are no new consolidations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted under cardiology service with an NSTEMI
and new onset atrial fibrillation. He remained pain free on
intravenous Heparin and was loaded with Plavix prior to cardiac
catheterization. Cardiac enzymes continued to trend downward.
Echocardiogram showed mild mitral regurgitation and a mildly to
moderately depressed ejection fraction, around 40-45%. Cardiac
catheterization revealed severe three vessel disease(please see
result section for specific details). Based upon multivessel
disease, cardiac surgery was consulted and further evaluation
was performed. In anticipation for surgery, Plavix was
discontinued. He continued to remain pain free on medical
therapy and was eventually cleared for surgery. On [**1-31**],
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed coronary artery bypass grafting surgery
along with MAZE procedure and ligation of left atrial appendage.
For surgical details, please see separate dictated operative
note. Following the operation, he was brought to the CSRU for
invasive monitoring. Given atrial fibrillation and MAZE
procedure, Amiodarone therapy was initiated. Within 24 hours, he
awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without incident.
He weaned from pressor support and maintained stable
hemodynamics. While in the CSRU, he remained mostly in a normal
sinus rhythm and transferred to the SDU on postoperative day
one. Despite medical therapy, he continued to experience
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Beta blockade was advanced as
tolerated and Warfarin was dosed for a goal INR around 2.0. Over
several days, he continued to make clinical improvements with
diuresis and made steady progress with physical therapy. He was
noted to have a postop leukocytosis, white count as high as 32K.
Also noted was sternal drainage and he was started and
discharged on antibiotics. By discharge, his white count
dramatically improved. He was eventually cleared for discharge
to home on postoperative day six. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was contact[**Name (NI) **] to
manage his Warfarin as an outpatient.
