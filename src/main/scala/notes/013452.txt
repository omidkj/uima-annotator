Brief Hospital Course:
41 y/o female with no significant PMH who was transferred from
OSH for severe HA and hypotension.

1. Viral / Asceptic Meningitis: Patient described having worst
headache of her life, CT head negative for ICH. There was
concern for a CNS infection given new HA, neck pain and
photophobia, additionally had WBCs in CSF.  Her CSF was most
consistent with an aseptic meningitis.  She was treated broadly
with IV CTX/VANC and Acyclovir.  There were no organisms seen on
gram stain of her CSF. Antibiotics were continued until CSF
cultures were negative at 72 hours. HSV PCR was negative as well
and acyclovir was stopped.  Multiple viral serologies and pcr
were sent and pending at time of discharge, including
enterovirus, west [**Doctor First Name **], and EEE.  She clinically improved,
headache improved and gradually felt well enough for return
home.  Since csf cultures were negative for 72hrs and
antibiotics discontinued, it was felt she was stable for
discharge home to follow up with her regular doctor.

2. Community Acquired Pneumonia: patient had a Left lower lobe
infiltrate on portable cxr on initial presentation, thought to
be pneumonia vs. atelectasis.  The infiltrate persisted on
follow-up pa and lateral views and in light of her recent
symptoms and illness, she was treated for CAP, to complete a 7
day course of fluroquinolone.
She had no significant respiratory symptoms at time of
discharge.
