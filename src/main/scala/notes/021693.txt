Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 78**]
Chief Complaint:
pulmonary embolism, ICA aneurysm

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**8-22**]: Angiogram with coiling of Left ICA aneurysm


History of Present Illness:
68 year old woman with HTN, COPD, s/p inital step in multistage
stent-assisted coiling for L ICA aneurysm and recent ankle
fracture with immobilization who presented to [**Hospital3 417**]
Hospital with one day history of shortness of breath, pleuritic
chest pain, cough, fever, and leukocytosis. Initially diagnosed
and treated with Levofloxacin for RLL infiltrate presumed to be
PNA; blood cultures done [**2147-8-17**] are negative to date. Was
evaluated for PE and noted to have normal D- dimer, negative leg
ultrasound for clot, low prob V/Q scan. Given clinical suspicion
patient underwent CTA of chest after premedication for iodine
allergy which showed a PE. She was started on a heparin drip and
underwent placement of an IVC filter [**2147-6-17**]. Most recent PTT at
OSH was therapeutic at 71 on Heparin weight based protocol at
900u/hr.
.
She is follwed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 18**] for her large left
internal carotid artery aneurysm (measures 1.5 x 1.2 x 1.5 cm)
and she is scheduled to have additional coiling on [**8-28**]. She is
being transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further medical management of her
PE and neurosurgical consultation. Per report at time of
transfer she remains on full dose aspirin, but is off plavix for
the recent cerebral stenting.
.
On the floor, the patient reports feeling well without focal
complaints.  She had a BM at admission.  Denies SOB, h/a, abd
pain, NVD, F/C.  States she has had some R sided pleuritic CP
for the past few hours, c/w her known PE.
.

STUDIES:
MRI/MRA [**2147-8-20**]
1. No evidence of interval subarachnoid or other intracranial
hemorrhage
since the pre-procedure examinations of [**2147-6-26**].
2. Status post initial coiling of the large, lobulated left
carotid terminus and possible carotico-ophthalmic aneurysm;
however, the current examination suggests that there is still
patency and flow within both the superior- anterior portion of
the aneurysm which may, in fact, be carotico-ophthalmic, as well
as a small amount of flow into the more posterior mid-portion of
the aneurysm.
3. No evidence of vasospasm or ischemia.

CT Abdomen/Pelvis [**8-23**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No retroperitoneal hematoma.
2. Right pleural effusion with adjacent compressive atelectasis.

3. Diverticulosis without evidence of active inflammation.
4. Retained contrast within the renal collecting systems, as
well as
vicarious excretion of contrast from the gallbladder, presumably
from
patient's recent angiogram.

CTA Head [**8-24**]:
FINDINGS: Patient is status post coiling of a large left ICA
aneurysm.
Extensive streak artifact somewhat limits evaluation. Within
this limitation, the bilateral, ACA, MCA and proximal internal
carotid arteries appear patent. There is no evidence of acute
intracranial hemorrhage or shift of normally midline structures.
There is no evidence of acute infarction identified. Mild
mucosal thickening of the bilateral frontal, ethmoidal and
sphenoid sinuses is noted. The mastoid air cells are clear.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute hemorrhage.
2. Limited evaluation due to streak artifact from coils. Within
this
limitation, the ACA, MCA and proximal internal carotid arteries
appear patent.

MRA Brain [**8-25**]:
BRAIN MRI: There are areas of hyperintensity on the diffusion
and T2-weighted and FLAIR images in the left frontal and
parietal regions with several tiny foci in the subcortical
region indicative of infarcts. These infarcts are not visualized
on ADC map indicating their infarcts to be of subacute nature.
Following gadolinium, no abnormal enhancement is seen.
There is a large coil pack identified in the left supraclinoid
region where coiling was performed for aneurysm. Mild
enhancement is seen in the
surrounding region, but no intrinsic enhancement to the coil PEG
is
identified.
IMPRESSION: Probable subacute infarcts in the left side of
cerebral
hemisphere involving the cortex in the posterior frontal and
anterior parietal region with several small subcortical
infarcts. Coil pack in the left supraclinoid region.
MRA HEAD:
The pre and post-contrast MRA of the head demonstrate subtle
enhancement
within the coil pack indicating the thrombus. No definite flow
signal is
identified within the coil pack or adjacent to it to indicate
residue
aneurysm. No vascular occlusion or stenosis seen. The evaluation
of the left supraclinoid internal carotid on projection images
is somewhat limited secondary to artifacts from the adjacent
coil pack.
IMPRESSION: Coil pack is visualized from embolization of the
left
supraclinoid internal carotid artery aneurysm. No definite
residual flow
signal identified within the aneurysm. Some intrinsic foci of
thrombus are
seen within the coil pack. No vascular occlusion in the arteries
of anterior or posterior circulation.
