History of Present Illness:
This is a 59 year old male with 5th episode of pancreatitis of
unclear etiology, necrotizing, admitted to OSH [**2123-1-15**]. He
presented to the OSH with pain, WBC to 16,000. A CT scan from
the OSH revelaed necrotising pancreatitis, ileus, mechanical
obstruction of descending colon. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
after blood cultures from [**2123-1-20**] showed Gram negative rods,
fever 104, and SMV partial thrombosis.

Pertinent Results:
MRCP (MR ABD W&W/OC)  [**2123-1-24**] 12:10 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Acute pancreatitis with necrosis of the head/body and
proximal portion of the pancreatic tail with surrounding
peripancreatic enhancing fluid collections. Superinfection of
these collections cannot be excluded.
2. Non-occlusive SMV thrombosis.
3. Marked dilatation of the small bowel with collapse of the
transverse and distal colon. Evolving small bowel obstruction
cannot be excluded although these findings are most likely
related to ileus in the setting of acute pancretitis.
4. No obstructing stone visualized within the intra- or
extra-hepatic biliary tree. The distal portion of the CBD is not
visualized and a mass in this region cannot be excluded.
5. The pancreatic duct is visualized along its entire course
entering the duodenum, without obstruction in the pancreatic
head.
.
CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS  [**2123-1-26**] 12:34 AM
IMPRESSION:

1. Acute pancreatitis with necrosis and replacement of the head
and body with fluid, superinfection of this fluid collection
cannot be excluded.

2. Small non-occlusive SMV thrombus and attenuation of the
splenic vein at portal confluence.

3. No pseudoaneurysm is noted.

4. Marked dilation of a small bowel with collapse of the distal
transverse colon and descending colon. This most likely
represents functional collapse of distal transverse colon in the
setting of acute pancreatitis.

5. Status post common bile duct stent placement.

6. Dilated pancreatic duct that is visualized along its course
entering the duodenum.
.
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2123-1-30**] 4:11 PM
IMPRESSION:

1. Acute pancreatitis with necrosis and replacement of the head
and most of the body of the pancreas with unchanged
multiloculated collection in the pancreatic bed. Again,
superinfection of this collection cannot be excluded.

2. Nonvisualization of the previously seen SMV partially
occlusive thrombus. Patent, however attenuated splenic vein at
the portosplenic confluence. No evidence of pseudoaneurysm.

3. Unchanged marked dilatation of small bowel and right colon
and transverse colon, this most likely represents ileus as
contrast is seen within the colon.

4. Interval development of pneumobilia which can be seen in the
presence of a common bile duct stent.

5. Right upper lobe air space disease suspicious for infection.
.
[**Last Name (un) **]-INTESTINAL TUBE PLACEMENT (W/FLUORO)  [**2123-2-2**] 2:50 PM
IMPRESSION: Successful placement of post-pyloric feeding tube
with termination in the third portion of the duodenum.

.
ERCP [**2123-1-25**]
1.The duodenum was distorted and oedomatous in keeping with
acute pancreatitis.
2.The major papilla was located in the second part of the
duodenum and was surrounded by oedomatous mucosa.
3.It was cannulated to access the CBD.
4.There distal CBD was v. narrowed due to extrinsic compression
from surrounding pancreatitis.
5.The proximal CBD was of normal calibre.
6.There were no stones or other filling defects noted in the
CBD.
7.The proximal PD visualised appeared normal.
8.A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position
using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
9.A 7cm by 10Fr biliary stent was placed successfully in the in
the CBD across the narrowed segment
.

PORTABLE ABDOMEN  [**2123-1-31**] 12:28 AM
FINDINGS: Comparison is made to the previous radiograph from
[**2123-1-24**] and the CT scan from [**2123-1-30**].

There is again seen markedly distended loops of small bowel as
well as loops of colon throughout the abdomen. Small bowel
distension appears to have decreased slightly since the prior
radiograph. Biliary stent and a nasogastric tube are seen. The
hemidiaphragms are not included on the study nor is the right
upper quadrant, which limits assessment for free air. However,
no large amount of free air is seen.

.

CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS  [**2123-2-4**] 9:07 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval appearance of nonocclusive extrahepatic portal vein
thrombosis and narrowing of the proximal splenic vein.
2. Similar appearance of large enhancing necrotic pancreatic
fluid collection, with intra-abdominal ascites. No evidence of
splenic artery aneurysm.
3. Biliary catheter and Dobhoff tube in place.
4. Dense oral contrast in the colon, to the rectum. No evidence
of obstruction.
5. Bilateral moderate-to-large pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis.

.
CTA PANCREAS W/ CTCP  [**2123-2-13**] 10:36 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Complications of acute pancreatitis, with a large pseudocyst
and necrosis of the pancreatic body and head. Gas bubbles are
seen, and infection cannot be excluded.
2. Nonocclusive portal vein thrombosis and obliteration of the
splenic vein. The superior mesenteric vein is patent. Small
pseudoaneurysm of a branch of the splenic artery. Nonocclusive
thrombus is seen within the splenic artery as well.
3. Ascites.
4. Pneumobilia.

LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) PORT  [**2123-2-20**] 11:24 AM
IMPRESSION: Decreased ascites. No intra- or extrahepatic ductal
dilatation. Limited evaluation for the pancreas. Previously
noted clot in the portal vein was not demonstrated on this
study.
.

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2123-3-10**] 12:49 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Status post debridement of infected pancreatic pseudocyst and
pancreatic necrosis with residual air- and fluid-containing
collections identified in the pancreatic bed which contain
surgical drains. Probable small communicating perforation
between smaller air-fluid collection in region of pancreatic
tail and adjacent fourth portion of duodenum.
2. Improvement to intra-abdominal/pelvic ascites and fluid
tracking along the paracolic gutters. New simple fluid
collection noted posterior to the surgical staple line.
3. Reidentification of the splenic vein thrombosis with
nonvisualization of previously noted nonocclusive portal vein
thrombosis and pseudoaneurysm of portion of splenic artery due
to the phase of contrast during current study image acquisition.
4. Multiple fluid-filled slightly dilated loops of bowel, imply
underlying ileus. No evidence of bowel obstruction.

Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted on [**2123-1-21**] to the ICU.

Neuro: He was A+O x 3 mostly, and he had periods of confusion,
but was easily re-oriented and able to follow commands.

GI/ABD: He was NPO with an NGT and IVF resuscitation. The NGT
was putting out moderate amounts of bilious drainage. The NGt
was removed on HD 3. A new NGT was placed on [**2123-1-25**] due to
continued abdominal distention.

CV: He was tachycardic and was being treated with Lopressor. He
received 1 unit PRBC on [**2123-1-30**] for anemia.

Hypertension: The patient was triggered on [**2-3**] for BP 186/90,
HR 122, RR 36 and temp 102.4. Blood cultures were sent and CXR
was negative. He received Hydralazine and Lopressor to control
HR and BP. Cardiac en
