SOCIAL HISTORY:  Remote tobacco use, occasional alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  At the time of admission, temperature
98.1, heart rate 66, blood pressure 108/88, respiratory rate
24, oxygen saturation 95 percent in room air.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose and throat - Jugular venous distention to ten
centimeters.  Respiratory - Bibasilar crackles, right greater
than left.  Cardiovascular - II/VI systolic murmur heard best
at the apex.  The abdomen is soft, no costovertebral angle
tenderness.  Extremities are warm, no lower extremity edema.
Neurologically, alert and oriented times four, speaking in
full sentences.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the medical
service.  He was worked up for congestive heart failure,
probable left lower lobe pneumonia, anemia, and chronic renal
insufficiency.  Initial workup included echocardiogram as
well as heart failure consult.  Over the next several weeks,
the patient was followed closely by the medicine service as
well as the heart failure service.  Additionally, pulmonary
medicine and cardiology consulted on the patient's case.
Ultimately the patient went for cardiac magnetic resonance
imaging that showed moderate to severe mitral regurgitation
with preserved left ventricular function and increased left
ventricular size.  Echocardiogram done shortly after
admission showed an ejection fraction of 55 percent with a
left atrium that is mildly dilated, right ventricle that was
markedly dilated with severe global right ventricular free
wall hypokinesis, two plus mitral regurgitation and four plus
tricuspid regurgitation and severe pulmonary artery
hypertension.  Ultimately the patient's condition
deteriorated.

He was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit and, on
[**2145-7-27**], he underwent cardiac catheterization that showed
severe pulmonary arterial hypertension unresponsive to
nitrate and clean coronaries following which cardiothoracic
surgery was consulted.  The patient was felt to be have
multiple medical problems and continued to be followed by the
medical and cardiology service while optimizing his medical
condition.  Ultimately on [**2145-8-16**], the patient was brought
to the operating room at which time he underwent a redo
sternotomy, tricuspid valve annuloplasty with a thirty
millimeter [**Doctor First Name 7624**] ring and a mitral valve replacement with
a number twenty-seven [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial valve.
Please see the operating room report for full details.

In summary, the patient's bypass time was 112 minutes with a
cross clamp time of 80 minutes.  He tolerated the operation
and was transferred from the operating room to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  At the time of transfer,
the patient had Levophed at 0.1 mcg/kg/minute, Milrinone at
0.25 mcg/kg/minute and Propofol at 50 mcg/kg/minute.  He had
a mean arterial pressure of 53 and he was V paced at a rate
of 80 with a PAD of 21.  Additionally, the patient had
Epinephrine infusion of 0.3 mcg/kg/minute.  The patient did
well in the immediate postoperative period.  His intravenous
medications were weaned as tolerated.  His ventilatory status
was adequate, and on postoperative day one, he was weaned
from the ventilator and successfully extubated.  On
postoperative day three, the patient returned to the Cardiac
Catheterization Laboratory at which time a permanent
pacemaker was implanted due to the patient's bradycardic
episodes during his preoperative course.

By postoperative day seven, the patient was complaining of
dyspnea.  His chest x-ray showed worsening congestive heart
failure.  Additionally, the patient began to complain that he
felt like he had a kidney stone with lower abdominal pain.
He became increasingly acidotic and his white blood cell
count went to 27.4.  He was seen by general surgery as well
as by the infectious disease service.  Abdominal ultrasound
showed dilated gallbladder and the patient was brought to the
operating room for an open cholecystectomy.  The patient's
recovery from this open cholecystectomy was slow but, by
postoperative day four from his cholecystectomy, he had been
weaned back to ventilator settings of continuous positive
airway pressure five and five.  On postoperative day six from
his cholecystectomy, he was extubated.  Extubation was short
lived and within several hours the patient needed to be
reintubated.  From that point forward, the patient's recovery
from ventilatory status was extremely slow.  On postoperative
day twenty-one from his MVR/TVR, the patient was scheduled
for tracheostomy.  A percutaneous tracheostomy was done at
the bedside following which the patient was noted to be in
respiratory distress.  A bronchoscopy done after the
tracheostomy showed bright red blood within the trachea and
the patient was brought to the operating room where they
found bleeding from the thyroid isthmus.  Open tracheostomy
was performed.  The bleeding was controlled and the patient
returned to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit following
the exploration.

Over the next week, attempts were made to wean the patient
from his full ventilation with limited success and screening
process was begun to place the patient in a pulmonary
rehabilitation center.  On postoperative day twenty-nine, the
patient was noted to have some rectal bleeding.  At that
time, the patient was receiving both Coumadin and Heparin.
Gastroenterology service was consulted and they felt that he
had radiation proctitis.  His Heparin was held.  The bleeding
resolved and on the following day the patient was restarted
on Heparin and Coumadin.  At that time, the patient was also
accepted to rehabilitation at [**Hospital1 **] in [**Hospital1 1559**].

The patient's physical examination is as follows:
Temperature 100, heart rate 70, V paced, blood pressure
120/50, respiratory rate 29, oxygen saturation 95 percent on
assist control, tidal volume of 550, respiratory rate of 24,
