She was found to have severe bradycardia, hypotension and acute

kayexalate and atropine intially. However, upon arrival to the
MICU goals of care were further discussed. After multiple family

and have the goals directed at comfort measures only. She was
changed to morphine prn and zofran. Additionally she was given
NTG prn for back pain with relief.

Brief Hospital Course:
74 yo with CAD, afib, hypertension, bilateral carotid stenosis,
hypercholesterolemia, lacunar stroke, who presented to the ED
with hyperkalemia, acute on chronic renal failure and with
bradycardia.

Bradycardia. Found in the ED to be severely bradycardic and was
given atropine. On review of the ECG it appears to be slow
atrial fib or junctional escape rhythm.
Currently she is in normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 54 (only
slightly bradycardic). It is difficult to tell if the
bradycardia preceeded/caused renal failure.  She was evaluated
by PE and thought not to be a candidate for a pacer currently.
If she again goes into atrial fib or has persistent bradycardia,
may need to consider pacer at that time.

Acute on chronic renal failure: initally had rapidly worsening
renal function.  Potassium continued to increase and patient
refused dialysis.  She was treated with kayexelate but continued
to have poor renal function.  Was briefly CMO but had
improvement in renal function.
Cause thought to be secondary to prerenal causes.  Renal
function continued to improve without any clear cause.

CHF. EF 55% with 3+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1192**] TR. WAs volume overloaded
and had oxygen requirement. Held on diuresis until renal
function improved and then was given 1 dose of 20 mg lasix to
which she had large volume diuresis and at time of discharge did
not have an oxygen requirement.

CAD. Per history has non-intervenable 3 vessel disease that is
managed medically. Per previous records has refused
catherization. Will follow for now. [**Month (only) 116**] need stress test per
cardiology as outpatient.
- Continued on ASA, Plavix
- Held beta-blockers, lisinopril, imdur for now and will restart
with symptoms and increased BP.

Hypothyroidism. Continued Synthroid. TSH normal.

Anemia. Baseline Hct low 30's and stable but without signs of
iron deficiency (chronic disease).

PAF. No nodal agents. No amiodarone.

Extended Care

Facility:
Roscommon

Discharge Diagnosis:
Renal failure
Bradycardia
Congestive heart failure

Secondary: Hypertension, coronary artery disease,
hypercholesterolemia, history of atrial fibrillation, history of
strokes, carotid stenosis, renal insufficiency


Discharge Condition:
improved renal function


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with renal failure and low heart rate.   You
were treated with IV fluids and holding your heart rate
medications

Please return to the ED or call your doctor if you have any
shortness of breath, pain, passing out or any other concerning
sytmptoms.

Patient recently had renal failure leading to hyperkalemia.
Will need close monitoring of her renal function and
electrolytes.

Also patient with volume overload.  Will need monitoring of
fluid status.  Responds well to lasix.

She has been taken off all of her cardiac medicines including
imdur, norvasc, lisinopril, zetia, inderal, and amiodarone due
to bradycardia.  She has a history of atrial fibrillation and
hypertension.  If patient becomes tachycardic or hypertensive
will need to restart.

Followup Instructions:
Please follow up with your PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **],[**Name9 (PRE) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 250**] in
