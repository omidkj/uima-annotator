.
Imaging:
- [**3-28**] CXR ([**Last Name (un) 1724**]): The chest is normal except for healed rib
fractures on the right.  There is no interval change
- [**4-3**] Intra-Op Cholangiogram ([**Last Name (un) 1724**]): Opacification of the
intrahepatic biliary ductal system, probably both right and left
intrahepatic ducts, as well as dilation of a tubular structure
more inferiorly that was initially read as the common bile duct.

Further review indicates that in addition to the common bile
duct, this also could be a dilated left intrahepatic duct
projecting inferiorly due to obliquity
- [**4-4**] MRCP ([**Last Name (un) 1724**]): Common hepatic duct and proximal CBD not seen
and there is dilatation of the left greater than right
intrahepatic biliary ductal system, with postsurgical
inflammatory changes within the operative bed as well as
perihepatic fluid.
- [**4-5**] EKG:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response,
Nonspecific ST abnormality, ST less depressed in Anterior leads
- [**4-6**] ERCP ([**Last Name (un) 1724**]): The ampulla was identified and had evidence
of
previous sphincterotomy. The bile duct was selectively
cannulated
with a balloon catheter and .025 guidewires. The distal CBD has
an estimated diameter of 6mm-7mm. There is abrubt cut-off of the
proximal CBD consistent with bile duct injury. An occulsion
cholangiogram did not result in passage of contrast beyond the
cut-off. Attempts at bridging the cut-off with a quidewire were
not successful.


Brief Hospital Course:
75M with a recent hx of cholecystitis and cholangitis ([**1-/2152**]),
managed medically due to concurrent NSTEMI w/trop >84 underwent
an interval laparoscopic converted to open cholecystectomy on
[**4-3**], which was complicated by an iatrogenic CBD transection and
cardiac enzyme elevation. The patient was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further cardiac evaluation and management of his bile duct
injury. Cardiology assessment recommended an alternative Toprol
dose but otherwise recommended no further cardiac opitimization
for surgery. The patient underwent a A PTC drain had been placed
on [**4-6**] after occlusion was noted on ERCP at an OSH.

The patient was initially admitted to the intensive care unit
for monitoring on [**4-6**]. There the patient was started on
Vanc/Pip-Tazo, omeprazole for GI prophylaxis, Dilaudid PCA for
pain control and was made NPO. Cardiac enzymes were cycled which
revealed no rising troponin levels. On [**4-7**] the Pip-Tazo were
d/c'ed and Ampicilin Sulbactam was started. The patient was then
transferred to the floor.

On [**4-8**] the patient was started on PO lopressor and dilaudid
with IV versions of both being disconitnued. The patient's PTBD
drain was found to be out by the nurse in the afternoon for
which an interventional radiology team was called for the PTBD
drain to be replaced. After the replacement of the drain the
patient returned to the floor in stable condition. At this time
the patient was continued on the Vanc and the Amp-Sulbactam.

On [**4-9**] the patient underwent preoperative evaluation.

On [**4-10**], the patient underwent a hepaticojejunostomy
successfully. The patient returned to the floor with an NGT, a
PTBD, and a bulb drain to suction. After a brief, uneventful
stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor NPO, on IV
fluids and antibiotics, with a foley catheter, and a dilaudid
PCA for pain control. The patient was hemodynamically stable.

Neuro: The patient received a dilaudid PCA with good effect and
adequate pain control. When tolerating oral intake, the patient
was transitioned to oral pain medications.

CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.

Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were
encouraged throughout hospitalization.

GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV
fluids. Diet was advanced when appropriate, which was well
tolerated. Patient's intake and output were closely monitored,
and IV fluid was adjusted when necessary. Electrolytes were
routinely followed, and repleted when necessary. The patient was
started on all home prostate medications prior to removal of
foley. The folwy was removed and pateint voided prior to
discharge.

ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were
closely watched for signs of infection. The patient's wound was
monitored for possible signs of infection.

Endocrine: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout
his stay; insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly.

Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined
routinely.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and
venodyne boots were used during this stay. He was encouraged to
get up and ambulate as early as possible.

On [**2152-4-14**] a repeat tube cholangiogram was obtained which
demonstrated patent anastamosis.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing
