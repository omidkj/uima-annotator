History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 78419**] is a 67yo female with PMH significant for LLE DVT and
depression who is being transferred from OSH for management of
saddle pulmonary embolism. She states that she went to [**State 108**]
on [**3-25**]. She flew back on [**4-5**]. Since her return she has
been experiencing a cramping pain in her right calf. Last Sunday
she started feeling short of breath, mostly on exertion. She
also admits to being very tired. This was unusual for her since
she is very active at baseline. Her symptoms persisted and on
Tuesday went to see her PCP for an urgent care visit. She had
bloodwork done but since she did not mention her RLE cramping no
further work-up was done. She was thought to have a
gastrointestinal bug. Today she started having pain on the left
side of her chest with some mild pleuritic pain. She went
grocery shopping but when she came home she was [**Last Name (un) **] tired. She
also noticed that her right leg was also more swollen. She went
to see her PCP today and had a RLE U/S which revealed a clot in
the popliteal vein. [**Doctor Last Name **] was then sent to the ED at [**Hospital3 62353**]. Her initial vitals there were T 97.3 BP 138/60 AR 83
RR 36 O2 sat 98% on 2L NC. She had a CT chest which showed a
saddle pulmonary embolus. She was immediately started on Heparin
IV and then sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
Review of systems is negative for fevers, chills,
syncope,hemoptysis, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or any
other concerning symptoms.
.
In the ED, her initial vitals were T 98.8 BP 124/92 AR 70 RR 17
O2 sat 96% on 2L NC. She was given Morphine 2mg IV and continued
on heparin gtt. She is being transferred to the MICU for closer
observation.

Outside hospital eval:
1)CT chest with contrast ([**4-14**]): Multiple filling defects are
seen, starting with large linear defects involving the main
pulmonary artery which extends into the main left and right
pulmonary arteries. Filling defects are seen involving second
order branches to both the upper and lower lobes bilaterally,
and findings are consistent with extensive pulmonary embolism.
Small left pleural effusion is seen, with atelectatic changes
noted at the lung bases. View of the upper abdomen show a 1.8cm
low density mass within the liver.
.
2)RLE U/S ([**4-14**]): Deep venous thrombosis involving the popliteal
vein.
.
[**2152-4-17**]: IVC filter placement - IVC-gram demonstrating a single
patent IVC with no thrombosis.
.
-------------
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2152-4-15**] 4:08 AM
Cardiac size is top normal. The aorta is elongated. There are
bibasilar atelectasis. If any, there is a small left pleural
effusion. There are low lung volumes and no pneumothorax.
----
TTE: [**2152-4-15**] at 10:55:01 AM
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No mass or thrombus is seen
in the right atrium or right atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The right atrial pressure
is indeterminate. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size
and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%)
There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
size is normal. with borderline normal free wall function (no
definite RV dysfunction). The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The main
pulmonary artery is dilated with a mobile echodensity seen at
the PA bifurcation (likely representing thrombus). There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: PA bifurcation thrombus c/w known pulmonary
embolism. At least mild pulmonary hypertension. No definite echo
signs of RV strain.
---------------
BLE USD: [**2152-4-16**] 3:03 PM
IMPRESSION:
Non-occlusive thrombus involving the right popliteal vein
extending into the mid-superficial femoral vein, with no
evidence of more central clot.
--------------
INTERUP IVC  [**2152-4-17**] 10:39 AM
IMPRESSION: IVC-gram demonstrating a single patent IVC with no
thrombosis.
Successful deployment of a G2 IVC filter, below the renal veins.
This filter may be retrieved in the future, if clinically
indicated.
.
-----------
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2152-4-16**] 7:39 AM
Compared to the prior study there is increased opacification of
the left lower lobe with increased amount of left pleural
effusion, findings which might be consistent with developing
pneumonia. There is no appreciable right pleural effusion and
the rest of the lungs are unremarkable. The cardiomediastinal
silhouette including the marked cardiomegaly is unchanged.
----------
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2152-4-17**] 10:11 AM
As compared to the prior study, there is no change in the left
pleural effusion and left retrocardiac atelectasis, although
worsening of the right lung base opacity most likely due to
atelectasis is demonstrated accompanied by small amount of right
pleural effusion. The upper lungs are unremarkable and there is
no evidence of failure. The cardiomediastinal silhouette,
including the cardiomegaly is unchanged.
----------
ECG Study Date of [**2152-4-15**]  12:57:48 AM
ECG: Sinus rhythm. Prior inferior myocardial infarction.
Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2152-4-15**] no diagnostic interim change.
----------
ECG Study Date of [**2152-4-15**]  12:14:56 AM
Sinus rhythm. Consider inferior myocardial infarction. T wave
abnormalities.
No previous tracing available for comparison.

Brief Hospital Course:
In brief, the patient is a 67 year old woman with history of
prior DVT, hypertension, and depression who presented with
fatigue, shortness of breath and chest pain who was found to
have a large saddle pulmonary embolism and right lower extremity
DVT.

1) Saddle Pulmonary Embolism and deep venous thrombosis: Patient
found to have extensive pulmonary emboli on CT chest from OSH.
RLE DVT likely initial event. She most recently traveled by
plane from [**State 108**] which is a risk factor for the development of
DVT/PE. No history of immbolization or surgery. Also question
the possibility of an underlying hypercoagulable state given
prior history of DVT. As a result, she will likely need to be on
lifelong Coumadin. She will also need hypercoagulable work-up
but checking these labs during an acute event is usually not
indicated.  IVC filter placed in-house given residual clot
burden in RLE and substantial embolus already visualized.
