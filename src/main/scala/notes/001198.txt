History of Present Illness:
This is a 50 year old female with PMH of asthma, questionable
TIA vs. complex migraine 2 months ago, poorly controlled DM1
with last A1C of 13 and HTN c/b ESRD s/p living related donor
renal transplant in [**2092**] presenting with 4 days of dysuria and 2
days of nausea and non-bloody, non-bilious emesis. She was seen
today at her PCP's office and referred to the ED after being
found to be orthostatic with a BP of 118/62 lying, 82/36
sitting, and 70/40 standing. She has had no urinary frequency or
hematuria and was noted to be extremely anxious about potential
renal failure. Of note, she was also seen last week for fever to
102, cough, and diarrhea and prescribed azithromycin with
resolution of her symptoms. She currently denies any F, abd
pain, diarrhea, constipation, or cough. She has been having some
chest burning likely related to esophageal irritation from
frequent vomiting. She has also been having some right shoulder
pain which she attributes to an injury she had from grabbing the
toilet in an episode of violent vomiting. She has also noted
dyspnea on exertion and chills as of late.
.
In ED, vitals were 98.2 82 129/58 16 97% RA. Per her PCP's exam,
she was noted to have some difficulty standing for orthostatics
and mild epigastric tenderness. She was also noted to have right
shoulder pain worse with movement, coughing, and lifting. On ED
exam her graft was not TTP. Per the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] EKG did not show any
changes from prior. A CXR was also performed and did not show
any acute cardiopulmonary abnormality per the ED. A renal
transplant ultrasound was performed but not reviewed in the ED.
Labs were significant for a WBC count of 25.4, thrombocytosis to
980, floridly positive UA, hyponatremia to 127, creatinine of
2.5, and an anion gap of 15. She was given
Maalox/simethicone/lidocaine which did not help her chest
burning and she reported vomiting it up, morphine 4mg IV for
right shoulder pain, cipro 400mg IV, and 2L of NS. Blood
cultures were performed, but urine culture was not sent. She was
admitted for UTI and acute renal failure. Most recent vitals:
97.8 108 124/56 18 100RA.
.
Review of sytems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denied cough, shortness of breath. Denied chest tightness,
palpitations. Denied diarrhea, constipation.

Past Medical History:
-Hypertension
-Type 1 diabetes since [**2063**], poorly controlled with last A1C of
13
-Asthma
-ESRD s/p living-related renal transplant in [**2092**]
-TIA vs. complex migraine in [**5-2**], started on Plavix thereafter



Social History:
She lives with her mother at home and is her mother's primary
caretaker. [**Name (NI) **] brother has flown in from [**Name (NI) 4565**] to care for
her while she is hospitalized. She does not have any children
but reports good social support from friends and [**Name2 (NI) **]-workers. She
works for the Massport website full-time. She does not smoke or
drink EtOH.

Family History:
Father had ALS but otherwise not significant.

PATHOLOGY:

PeriNephric Mass Biopsy [**7-20**] Fragments of fibrovascular tissue
and chronic inflammation.  See note.
Note: The biopsy is mostly comprised of fibrous tissue and
lymphocytes with some crush artifact.  A separate discrete
aggregate of plasma cells are identified.  These plasma cells
are small with eosinophilic cytoplasm and eccentrically located
nuclei.  No atypical forms are seen.  By immunohistochemistry
the plasma cells are positive for CD138 and Bcl
