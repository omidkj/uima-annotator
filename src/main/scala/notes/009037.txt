Cardiac Cath:

1.  Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
severe
single vessel coronary artery disease.  No true left main
coronary
artery was noted.  The LAD demonstrated no angiographically
apparent
flow limiting stenoses.  No true LCX was identified but a high
diagonal
or ramus branch was noted.  The RCA was a large caliber vessel
with a
total occlusion noted in the mid vessel.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed moderately elevated right
sided
filling pressures (mean RA pressure was 12 mm Hg and RVEDP was
13 mm
Hg).  Pulmonary artery pressures were high normal (PA pressure
was 30/20
mm Hg).  Left sided filling pressures were moderately elevated
(mean PCW
pressure was 20 mm Hg and LVEDP was 24 mm Hg).  Central
hypotension was
noted (aortic pressure was 83/47 mm Hg, before dopamine was
administered).  There was no significant gradient noted across
the
aortic valve upon pullback of the catheter from the left
ventricle to
the ascending aorta.
3.  Left ventriculography was not performed.
4.  Successful PCI of the RCA was performed with a 3.0 x 8 mm
Hepacoat,
terminating an infero-posterior infarct.
5.  Angioseal of the right groin was performed.


Brief Hospital Course:
69 year old female with STE IMI given TNK then salvage PCI.

1.  CAD:  Culprit lesion likely prox RCA, and recanalized with
lytics.  Resolution of EKG changes.  Continued asa, BB, statin,
hep, plavix and integrillin (which was stopped [**2-5**] persistent
bleeding, see below).  Pt denied further chest pain, post PCI.
Also started ACE for remodeling.

2.  Pump:  Pt with preserved EF, but some diastolic dsyfunctoin
given stunned myocardium.  Required few doses IV lasix to
maintain euvolemia.  Continued ACE and beta-blocker.

3.  Rhythm:  Had persisten sinus tach.  Continued beta-blocker.
Also gave multiple blood transfusions

4.  Diarrhea:  Developed antibiotics-associated diarrhea.
Negative for C.diff.  Resolved spontaneously.  Guiac negative.

5.  Headache:  Pt with persistent migraines.  Resolved with
fiorocet.

Discharge Instructions:
You have been treated for a myocardial infarction with a cardiac
catheterization and stent placement.  It is extremely important
that you take all of your new medications to minimize the chance
that you will suffer another heart attack in the future.

Follow the guidelines for diet and activity outlined in the
booklets you received in the hospital, including no heavy
lifting more than 10 pounds and walking as tolerated with
assistance. Please make arrangements to live on the [**Location (un) 448**]
of your house until physical therapy can make sure you're safe
on your stairs.

Please call your doctor if you develop chest pain, shortness of
breath, rectal bleeding, fevers, chills, black tarry stools,
increasing blood in your stool or other problems.

If you diarrhea does not improve in 2 days, call you doctor
immediately. He may want to perform tests on your stool at that
time. Drink fluids to stay hydrated -- gatorade works well to
replace the electrolytes lost with diarrhea. You can also take
over the counter immodium for unformed stools, 2 mg at a time,
up to 3 pills per day.

Followup Instructions:
F/U with your PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 724**] at [**Hospital1 336**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 56813**], in 1
week for your diarrhea symptoms or sooner if symptoms worsen.

You need to arrange follow up with a Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 284**] in 4
weeks by calling:
