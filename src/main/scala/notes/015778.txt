CT Head: No acute intracranial process with small left subgaleal
hematoma.

CT Cspine:
1.  Comminuted fracture of the left facet of the C6 vertebral
body with
extension into the lamina, pedicle and posterosuperior
left-sided aspect of the C6 vertebral body.
2.  Right-sided C6 pedicular fracture extending into the facet
and right
lateral C6 vertebral body.
3.  Assessment of fracture extension into the transverse
foramina is limited and as a result cannot fully be excluded.
Thus, need for CTA to assess vertebral arteries is unclear.
These findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] by phone at 01:40.
Initial findings were also discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 54156**] and [**Doctor Last Name 2819**]
at 23:45 on [**2198-5-30**].

CT Sinus: Limited study due to motion without evidence of
fracture.

CT Torso:
1.  Subcapsular hepatic hematoma with 1 or 2 segment VI, 4-5 cm
lacerations, though others may be masked due to fatty liver and
bolus timing
2.  3.2 cm right adrenal hematoma and stranding about the left
adrenal gland.
3.  Stranding and free fluid in the mesentery as well as
dependently in the pelvis suspicious for mesenteric and/or bowel
injury, though no additional CT signs of bowel injury are
identified.
4.  Non-specific stranding about the aorta and IVC without
evidence of frank extravasation.
5.  Right sixth and seventh lateral rib fractures, right fifth
rib anterior chondral fracture, left fifth through eighth
anterolateral costochondral fracture-dislocations, and
transverse process fractures at T6 and T12 through L5 as
described above.
6.  No evidence pulmonary contusion with atelectasis felt more
likely.
7.  Right axillary soft tissue contusion.

MRI Cspine:
1. Mild STIR hyperintensity in bilateral C6 pedicles and facets.
There is
mal-alignment of bilateral C5-C6 facet joints, left more than
right which is likely secondary to rotatory subluxation. The
fractures of C6 facets are better seen on the CT cervical spine.
No evidence of ligamentous injury. Increased mobility at this
level can be assessed by flexion/extension views when patient is
stable if clinically indicated.
2. A T1 and T2 hypointense soft tissue in the anterior epidural
space
extending from C6-C7 disc posterior to C7 body. This likely
represents an
extruded disc with inferior migration. This causes deformity of
the ventral surface of the spinal cord.
3. No focal signal abnormality in the spinal cord.
4. Degenerative changes in the cervical spine with multilevel
neural foraminal stenosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 9450**] was admitted to the trauma ICU on [**2198-5-31**] with the
following injuries:
Bilateral pulmonary contusions
Right rib fractures [**6-21**]
Left rib fractures [**5-22**]
Fracture of C-spine at C6
Transverse process fracture T12-L5
Subcapsular liver hematoma
Segment 6 liver laceration (4cm)
Ileal mesenteric tear with small bowel ischemia
Blunt cardiac injury
Adrenal hematoma

In brief, he was taken to the operating room on admission from
the ED.  There was a large mesenteric tear and associated small
bowel ischemia.  This was resected; he had a ileo cecectomy with
primary anastomosis.  He also was noted to have a liver
laceration with associated liver ischemia, this was debrided.
Post-op he was monitored in the ICU and was noted to be
persistently tachycardic with an increasing pressor requirement.
His lactate was elevated and rising and he was taken back to the
OR for a 2nd look laparotomy, also on [**2198-5-31**].  Approximately 1
liter of blood was found and an internal hernia. He was
hemostatic at the end of the case and he was returned to the
ICU.  The rest of his hospital course by systems below, but in
brief was characterized by a prolonged wean from the ventilator,
finally extubated on [**2198-6-14**] and liver necrosis and eventual
fluid collection which was drained by IR. His course is
described below by system:

Neuro:  He was initially sedated while intubated with a
combination of propofol, fentanyl and versed but this was weaned
as appropriate and after extubation he was treated with Dilaudid
for pain. Orthopedic Spine evaluation was requested for the
cervical spine fracture- this was treated non operatively with a
cervical collar. He will follow up in approx 4 weeks with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 363**] where he will have repeat spine films done. He was alert
and oriented x 3 and neurologically intact with some bilateral
upper extremity weakness that had improved during his admission.

Cardiac: Patient was hypotensive during the initial days postop
and required pressors. He was weaned off Levophed on POD#3. Echo
was performed to evaluate for blunt cardiac injury and the heart
appeared hyperdynamic with no wall motion abnormalities. Patient
was resuscitated with PRBC and albumin.  He remained
hemodynamically stable throughout the rest of his hospital
course.

Resp:  He was intubated initially on scene then remained
intubated post-operatively through two trips to the OR.
Initially requiring high PEEPs this was eventually weaned though
he continued to struggle with poor oxygenation and inability to
wean from the vent, likely due to a combination of [**Last Name (STitle) 1064**]
(noted on CXR, BAL after bronch on [**2198-6-6**] grew MSSA) and fluid
overload.  He was placed on a Lasix drip to remove excess fluid
and treated with levofloxacin (started on [**6-7**]) for the
[**Month/Year (2) 1064**]; he was eventually weaned to extubation on [**2198-6-14**]. He
remained on 40mg PO Lasix daily while on the floor and continued
to diurese well. He was changed to diamox on [**6-21**] to avoid
hypercarbia. His supplemental oxygen was weaned and his oxygen
saturation remained stable on room air. Continued pulmonary
toileting and incentive spirometry were encouraged.  On [**6-24**] he
underwent diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis for 1.5L and
he symptomatically improved with saturations remaining in the
mid to high 90's. Follow up CXR showed interval decrease in
right pleural effusion with no evidence of pneumothorax after
thoracentesis.

GI: Patient was taken for emergent laparotomy on the night of
admission. Postop, patient had persistent lactic acidosis and
hypotension. Patient was taken back to OR for re-exploration,
also on [**5-31**], as noted above.  H
