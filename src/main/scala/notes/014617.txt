abd pain and melena

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 64151**] is a 55F with h/o CHF on home O2, atrial fibrillation
on warfarin, DM, and h/o antral gastric ulcer who presented with
abdominal pain and black stools.
.
One day prior to admission she noticed decreased energy and
malise. In the evening, she developed abdominal discomfort and
headache. Her abdomen was tender on the right side, with a
constant achy pain [**6-19**] in intensity. There was no associated
dyspnea or lightheadedness, but that evening she did experience
some nausea and vomiting, without hematemesis or coffee. The day
of admission, she noticed some black stool when wiping herself.
She had no hematochezia. She denies any other bleeding problems
or changes in her warfarin dosing. She does not use NSAIDS or
drink alcohol. +Mildly lightheaded at home, no falls. Had EGD
[**12-16**] that showed 3-4mm antral ulcer with path c/w "chemical
gastropathy," H. pylori negative. Prior colonoscopy [**2-12**] showed
diverticulosis only.
.
Review of systems is negative for chest discomfort, increased
dyspnea, dysuria, diarrhea, or constipation. She did feel a
little sweaty when having the abdominal pain and vomiting and
did experience palpitations.
.
In the ED, vitals were T 99.2 P 60 Bp 136/45 RR 24 O2 99% on 3L.
She was normotensive. Labs were notable for K of 7.2 with Cr of
3 (baseline ~1 [**9-/2176**]), Hct of 20.6 (down from 26 [**2177-1-19**]), and
INR of 3.9, platelets 183. She was given kayexalate, zofran,
calcium gluconate, insulin/D50, and albuterol as well as empiric
unasyn 3 grams. RUQ ultrasound showed no acute findings. She was
guiac positive per records. He vitals in the ED were notable for
pulses in 40's but normotensive. A central line was placed, and
she was admitted to the MICU. She was transfused 3 units PRBCs
and given 2.5mg vitamin K. Hct nadir 19.5 reached [**2-26**] in AM.
She was seen by the GI consult service who plan to perform EGD
when INR ~1.5 as she has clinically stabilized.

pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or focal consolidation is

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 55 year-old female with complex medical history
notable for CHF, atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation, gastric
ulcer, and DM admitted with abdominal pain and melena
.
1. GI Bleed: The patient initially presented with evidence of
melena with suspected upper GI source, especially given history
of prior gastric ulcer. The patient was transfused with 3u PRBC
with stabilization of hct and hemodynamics. She was also given
vitamin K to decrease INR (supratherapeutic at 3.9 on
admission). The GI service was consulted on admission, and
performed an EGD on [**3-3**]. EGD showed a small antral erosion but
no site of active or recent bleeding. The GI service recommended
outpatient capsule endoscopy to further evaluate the small
bowel. If negative, they suggest further workup with colonoscopy
(previous normal colonoscopy in [**2173**]). The patient was continued
on a PPI throughout admission and upon discharge. Aspirin and
coumadin were held on discharge pending further workup of GI
bleed. She will f/u in GI suite for capsule endoscopy on [**4-1**].
.
2. Acute renal failure on CRF: The patient developed ARF with
maximum creatinine of 3.2 on day of admission. This was felt to
be of pre-renal etiology given hypovolemia with blood loss. Cr
improved post transfusions to baseline ~ 1.6. ACEI and lasix
were initially held and were started back upon discharge.
.
3. Bradycardia: The patient has a history of sinus bradycardia
both with and without BB therapy. Admission EKG was without
significant change compared to [**10-17**], at which time she had also
been bradycardic in 40's. The patient's BB was held [**1-11**]
bradycardia with increase of HR to the 50's. Beta-blocker was
held on discharge, and should be restarted per the patient's
outpatient cardiologist.
.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient had hyperkalemia to value of 6.2,
which was thought to be [**1-11**] ARF. This resolved with
volume-resuscitation, as above. The patient was restarted on
lasix prior to discharge.
.
5. CHF and nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: The
patient is maintained on a BB for her outpatient regimen. This
was held, as above, and may be restarted per her outpatient
cardiologist.
.
6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient remained in sinus rhythm
during admission. She was continued on amiodarone, and BB was
held as above. The patient was given vitamin K per
supratherapeutic INR in setting of active bleeding. Coumadin was
held upon discharge until further workup of GI bleed could be
performed.
.
7. DM: The patient was continued on home ISS while inhouse with
no acute issues.
.
The patient was discharged to home on [**2177-3-3**] in good condition,
HD stable with stable hct. Follow-up was arranged with GI and
her PCP's office.
