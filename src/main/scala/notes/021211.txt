BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 78-year-
old male with a history of CML who was recently discharged
from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1495**] [**Hospital **] Medical Center on [**2177-12-8**] following
surgery for small bowel obstruction secondary to an
incarcerated hernia.  He was in his usual state of health at
home when over the course of 2 days, he experienced confusion
and disability.  On [**2177-12-20**], in an attempt to get out of bed
he experienced an episode of syncope and hit his head.  He
was brought to [**Hospital1 18**], where he experienced respiratory arrest
and subsequent asystole in the ER.  He was resuscitated,
intubated, and admitted to the Medical ICU.  Initial chest x-
ray was significant for pulmonary edema.  Head CT was
negative for intracranial bleed, but a CT of the face
revealed a right orbital fracture with hematoma formation.
The patient's ICU course was complicated by respiratory
failure, hypotension, presumed sepsis, acute renal failure,
DIC, anemia, persistent encephalopathy, and pancreatitis.  A
trial of extubation was attempted on [**2177-12-30**], subsequent to
which the patient was coughing up large amounts of clotted
blood necessitating re-intubation.  On [**2177-12-31**], the patient
had an episode of right-sided profuse epistaxis following a
nasal trumpet placement for suctioning.  The course of
bleeding was believed to be in the nasal cavity or of
nasopharyngeal origin.  The patient had bronchoscopy on
[**2178-1-1**], which revealed no active bleeding but copious
amounts of old clotted blood.  After extensive ongoing
discussion with the patient's family, the decision was made
to change his status to DNR/DNI.  He was made comfort
measures only and extubated on [**2178-1-2**] and expired at 8:55
p.m. on [**2178-1-2**].

Permission was granted for a limited autopsy, specifically
for breast tissue to rule out breast cancer, as patient was
noted to have a family history of male breast cancer.
Microscopic examination of the breast tissue revealed no
evidence of carcinoma.
