Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
75F PMHx polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **], Afib on coumadin s/p cardioversion
in [**10-4**], chronic CHF (EF 45%), CAD s/p CABG  s/p multiple PCIs,
COPD, hx of thoracic aortic aneurysm, Barrett's esophagus,severe
PVD s/p femoral stenting b/l renal artery stenosis s/p right
stent placed [**11-28**], and LLL wedge resection for stage 1A squamous
cell CA presenting from BIDN with AFib with RVR and unstable
angina.  Patient initially presented to BIDN on [**9-21**] with
several days worth of worsening SOB, CXR showed lower lobe
consolidation, and she was started on levofloxacin as well as
steroids and nebulizers for COPD.
.
She then started to have continued runs of AFib with RVr into
the 120s, with subseuqent jaw pain (her anginal equivalent), and
anterior ST depressions.  The jaw pain would resolve with SL
Nitro, then return intermittently and she was thus started on a
nitro gtt, as well as a dilt gtt for rate control.  Also of
note, her Hct had decreased from 28 to 22 with no obvious
bleeding source, INR 3.5.  She was given 10 mg VitK, 2 units
PRBCs prior to transfer.  She is being transferred for possible
cath, on a nitro gtt, dilt gtt.
.
The patient has a history of CAD s/p MI, PTCA and CABG in '[**17**].
Pt's anginal equivalent is jaw pain; pMIBI in [**2139**] showed
reversible moderate in severity ischemic defect in the distal
anterior wall and apex. Hypokinesis of the distal anterior wall
and apex.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

IMAGING:
FINDINGS: Bilateral lungs are hyperexpanded, suggestive of COPD.
Since
[**2142-9-22**], bilateral lower lung opacities have worsened
concerning for an aspiration. Minimal left pleural effusion is
unchanged. Both upper lungs are clear. Top normal size heart,
mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Left PICC line ends
at mid SVC. Patient is status post median sternotomy and sternal
sutures are intact. Atherosclerotic calcifications seen at the
aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta.
.
IMPRESSION: Since [**2142-9-22**], new bilateral lower lung
opacities are
concerning for aspiration and mild left pleural effusion is
unchanged.


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
75F PMHx Afib on coumadin chronic CHF (EF >55%), CAD s/p CABG,
severe COPD on 3L home O2, stage 1A squamous cell lung ca who
presented with aFib with RVR in the setting of a pnuemonia and
COPD exacerbation, now rate controlled and treated, being
discharged to rehab.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
#Atrial Fibrillation:  Transfered from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with Afib with
RVR and jaw pain thought to be from rate related ischemia. She
was rate controlled with IV agents, with resolution of her jaw
pain.  Patient transitioned to PO diltiazemn 360 daily and
metoprolol 100 daily.  Her warfarin was briefly held on
admission, then restarted at her home dose of 2.5mg daily (at
discharge INR was 1.2, not bridging).
.
#Pneumonia: Patient w bilateral lower lung opacities in setting
of increased O2 requirement and leukocytosis.  She was started
on broad spectrum abx [**2142-9-21**], though on [**2142-9-27**], sputum
cultures grew strenotrophomonas, necessitating switching patient
to Bactrim DS 2 tabs TID for 14 days (first day [**2142-9-27**]).
.
# COPD Exacerbation:  O2 requirment up to 4L on admission from
baseline 3L; she was given IV steroids, ipratropium nebulizers
and treatment of PNA as above; later switched to PO prednisone
with the plan for slow taper given severe underlying lung
disease; at discharge, plan to receive one more day of 40mg po
prednisone followed by 5 days of 20 mg po prednisone then stop.
She should continue tiotropium and advair. A
