Brief Hospital Course:
75 y/o male who was initially admitted to medicine service for
treatment of pneumonia. He was treated with Levaquin with good
response and then was transferred to the surgical service.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] in preparation for
resection with Dr [**First Name (STitle) **]. This patient is well known to the
surgical service following recent hospitalization for workup of
his renal cell cancer following a GI bleed. Last year he was
evaluated and the tumor was abutting but not invading the
duodenum and the hepatic flexure and at that time he did not
proceed with surgery. Now following extensive workup it was
presumed that the GI bleed was due to tumor erosion into the
duodenum. At this time, the patient has elected to proceed with
the surgery.
He was taken to the OR on [**2145-3-2**] with Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for
Exploratory laparoscopy, right hemicolectomy, duodenal
resection, cholecystectomy and primary duodenal repair. Please
see the operative note for surgical detail.
He was transferred oto the SICU following the procedure still
intubated in serious but stable condition.
He was extubated on POD 2.
He was afebrile throughout his post-op course. NGT was d/c'd on
POD 7, prior to the tube being discontinued he had an upper GI
study showing:
-Approximately 100 cc of Conray was first injected through the
NG tube which passed freely into the loops of jejunum with no
extravasation. This was followed by administration of
approximately 120 cc of barium which did not demonstrate any
leak. The barium passed freely into the loops of jejunum.
IMPRESSION: Status post resection of the extrinsic duodenal mass
with no evidence of leakage or obstruction.
Following NG removal his diet was slowly advanced. His bowel
function was slow to return.
An abdominal CT was obtained on [**3-13**] due to continued slow
return of bowel function, although bowel movements had been
reported. The CT showed post-surgical changes and normal caliber
loops of bowel. No free fluid or air seen in the pelvis. He was
continued on a bowel regimen. He had intermittent c/o nausea
with occasional vomiting reported.
He was ambulating, tolerating regular diet. All JP drains had
been removed by the time of discharge. Clips to be removed at
clinic visit on [**3-18**].
