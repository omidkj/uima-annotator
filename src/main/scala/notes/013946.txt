Pertinent Results:
(On admission)
.
Pelvic U/S with Doppler ([**2120-1-30**]): 1. Large complex cystic mass
with thick septations and irregular wall in the right adnexa.
The lesion is concerning for an ovarian neoplasm such as
cystadenocarcinoma and surgical resection has to be considered.
2. Both ovaries not identified; cannot exclude torsion.
.
Echocardiogram ([**2120-1-31**]): Normal biventricular cavity sizes with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
.
[**2120-2-4**]: Current study demonstrates new left lower lobe
opacity accompanied by pleural effusions that may potentially
represent interval development of infectious process or
aspiration. No evidence of pneumothorax or evidence of pulmonary
edema.

[**2120-2-4**]: The ET tube tip is 4 cm above the carina. The NG tube
tip is in the stomach.  There is still presence of complete
consolidation of the left lower lung, but some aeration of the
left upper lung is noted with decrease in the mediastinal shift.
The right lower lobe consolidation continues to increase and is
worrisome for developing infectious process

[**2120-2-4**]: Right PICC line tip is at the level of cavoatrial
junction/proximal right atrium and should be pulled back for
approximately 1.5 cm. There is significant improvement of the
left lung aeration. In contrary there is growing right lower
lobe consolidation highly worrisome for pneumonia or aspiration
pneumonia. The rest of the findings are unchanged.

[**2120-2-5**]: Previous left lung collapse has cleared in the left
upper lobe and some of the lower, progressive improvement since
[**2-4**]. Consolidation in the mid region of the right lung has
increased apparently, while consolidation at the base has either
improved or is now obscured by posteriorly collected right
pleural effusion. Overall, findings point to compromised airway,
presumably due to secretions. Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly and
pulmonary vascular congestion with mediastinal venous
engorgement also indicate some cardiac decompensation, but I do
not see edema. Small pleural effusion may be present
on the left as well. ET tube is in standard placement,
nasogastric tube
passes below the diaphragm and out of view. Right PIC catheter
can be traced to the mid SVC.

[**2120-2-7**]: There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly. The lungs are
hyperinflated. Small bilateral pleural effusions are larger on
the left side. Bibasilar atelectasis are improved. Mild
pulmonary congestion has improved. Previously described right
apical opacity has improved. There are no new lung
abnormalities. Right PICC remains in place.
.
Bilateral LENIS [**2120-2-4**]: IMPRESSION: No DVT in both lower
extremities.

Brief Hospital Course:
63 year old female with HTN, asthma, CAD s/p MI in [**2112**], and
DM2, who was admitted to the hospital with worsening abdominal
pain, nausea and vomiting with right sided pelvic mass. She
underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy with BSO for torsed
ovarian cyst.

*) Pulmonary: Ms. [**Known lastname **] post-operative course was complicated
by an extended oxygen requirement necessitating admission to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on POD#0 and again on POD# 2. She was ultimately intubated
in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and started on IV antibiotics for presumed
aspiration and hospital acquired pneumonia. She was ultimately
extubated on [**2120-2-5**] and her oxygen requirement decreased. On
transfer to the floor, she was only requiring nasal canula
during the day and CPAP at night. Her pulmonary status continued
to improve and she was completely weaned off O2. Medicine was
asked to consult to help optimize her COPD. She was started and
mainatined on Advair, Spiriva and Albuterol.

*) Infectious Disease: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was diagnosed with a hospital
acquired pneumonia and aspiration. She was initially placed on
unasyn in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], but transitioned to Cipro/Vanc/Zosyn. Her
leukocytosis initially improved, but on [**2120-2-7**] her WBC again
trended up. ID was asked to consult and the recommendation was
made to transition to Vancomycin and Meropenem. Her WBC improved
and she remained afebrile. She completed a 12 day course
