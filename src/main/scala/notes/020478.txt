History of Present Illness:
This is a 82 year-old female with a history of MDS, PE on
Lovenox, CAD, Crohn's who presents with increased O2
requirement.  At baseline, she uses approximately 2.5L of O2 at
home.  Her daughter noted that yesterday, she was satting in the
mid 80s, and increased her O2 to 3-4L.  The patient seemed more
somnolent and confused over the last day.  She brought her to
the ED for this. Of note, daughter states that patient has not
been eating much lately, and continues to have diarrhea.
.
In the ED, her initial VS were 96.7, 119/95,65,23, 95% 4L.  She
was noted to have bilateral crackles on exam.  CXR was
consistent with volume overload, left pleural effusion +/-
consolidation.  She was then noted to be hypotensive with BP
69/12.  She was given a 250 cc bolus with improvement to SBP
110.  She then was noted again to be hypotensive vitals  80/22,
62, 92% 4L.  She was to be given another 500 cc bolus when they
realized she had pulled out her IV.  They discussed with the
patients daughter, the HCP, about a [**Name (NI) 14938**], but the daughter
refused.  They placed another 18G and gave her another 500 cc
bolus.  She is on chronic prednisone (18 mg daily), so she was
given 10 mg decadron.  Also, she was given levofloxacin and
vancomycin in the ED as well as a combivent.  No ABG was done.
There was another lengthy discussion in the ED regarding goals
of care, which has been an issue in the past, and currently her
daughter reports that she is DNI, but not DNR.  Her last lovenox
dose was yesterday.
.
ROS: patient did not give ROS; per daughter, no fevers, nausea,
vomiting, chest pains.  She does report decreased UOP with
decreased PO intake and diarrhea recently.

IMPRESSION:
1. Slightly increased right pleural effusion which is now
moderate, and
unchanged small left pleural effusion. Minimal residual opacity
in the
posterior left upper lobe from previously seen consolidation.
2. Thickening of the mid to distal esophagus with fatty
infiltration in the
distal esophageal wall, suggesting esophagitis, which may relate
to the
patient's moderate-sized axial hiatal hernia.
3. Unchanged hypoattenuating left thyroid lesion, for which
ultrasound is
recommended.

IMPRESSION: Unchanged appearance of mild pulmonary edema and
bilateral
pleural effusions.


Brief Hospital Course:
82 year-old female with a history of PE, MDS, CKD, anemia, CAD
who presents with hypoxia and hypotension.

# Hypoxic/hypercapnic respiratory failure:  Patient presented
with acute on chronic hypoxia, as she has an oxygen requirement
at home of 2.5L.  A CXR on admission demonstrated pneumonia and
a chest CT confirmed the presence of an infiltrate and also
demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than
left.  Patient's hypoxia was thought to be secondary to
pneumonia, pleural effusions, and diastolic heart failure, and
her hypercapnia was thought to be secondary to muscular weakness
and possibly obstructive sleep apnea (does not carry this
diagnosis).  She was continued on levofloxacin (day 1=[**3-14**]) and
vancomycin (day 1=[**3-15**]).  She will likely require BiPAP qhs
chronically. Vancomycin was d/c'd prior to transfer out of the
ICU [**3-17**]. Patient remained stable following transfer to floor.
She was continued on a 10day course of levofloxacin.  She did
not tolerate increased doses of lasix. However, she was
continued on 10mg daily (up from home dose qod) and she had
marked improvement of her anasarca.  Given the severity of
right-sided heart failure/diastolic heart failure, and expected
recurrent exacerbations the CHF service was consulted and
recommend continued diuresis with lasix qod/prn, with dosing
until blood pressure decreases or Cr increases. She was also
continued on metoprolol 12.5. Her weight at time of discharge
was 126.5lbs. She electively did not use BiPAP on the floor.

# Pneumonia:  Patient was continued on levofloxacin. Vancomycin
d/c'd after 2 days on [**3-17**].

# Hypotension:  Patient was hypotensive at presentation with a
SBP in the 80s and was thought to be relatively volume deplete
in the setting of diarrhea and poor po intake.  Her SBP improved
to the 100s after IVF administration in the ED and arrival to
the ICU. Her blood pressure remained stable during this
hospitalization.

# Altered mental status:  There was some concern initially that
patient's mental status was altered and a head CT was negative
for an acute process. Her mental status was at baseline per her
daughter and this remained stable.

# DVT and PE: Patient has a history of DVT/PE and is on lovenox
at home, with LMW heparin levels checked regularly (last checked
on [**2194-3-4**], LMW hep = 1.04).  She was continued on her lovenox
dose of 70 mg daily.

# CRI:  Patient's creatinine was at it's baseline (1.8-2.3) and
medications were renally dosed. Her Cr did increase slightly to
2.5 wi
