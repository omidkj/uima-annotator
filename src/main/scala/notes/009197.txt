Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2160-9-22**], patient underwent cadaveric renal transplant in
right iliac fossa with end-to-side neoureterocystostomy over a
6-French double-J stent. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 406**] drain was placed in the
retroperitoneum. Surgeon was Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. Please refer to
operative note for details. Postop, he remained in the PACU for
management of low bp and urine output. Neo was required for low
sbp. He was transferred to the SICU for continued management.

U/S on [**9-23**] showed mild hydro, mildly increased RIs, mildly
delayed aterial upstrokes. Urine output was 5-10cc/hr. CVVH was
started for hyperkalemia after femoral CVL was exchanged for a
temporary line.
On [**9-24**] he was febrile to 101.6 likely from ATG. However, he was
pan-cultured. The L femoral line was removed. He was transiently
hypoxic, likely from atelectasis. CXR showed bilateral
infiltrates, poor respiratory status likely [**1-23**] fluid overload.
He was given 1 unit of PRBC for hct of 25.1 from 31.

On [**9-25**]  Hemodialysis was done with 2 units of PRBCs given for
hct of 25.2. He was weaned to O2 via nasal cannula.

Urine output was less than 500cc/day. Creatinine remained
elevated, dropping after HD as expected. JP drainage decreased
and JP was removed on [**9-26**]. Incision was intact with staples and
remained without redness/drainage.

Diet was advanced and tolerated. Immunosuppression consisted of
ATG x 4 doses (125mg each dose), Cellcept 1 gram [**Hospital1 **], steroids
were tapered to off and prograf was started on postop day 1.
Doses were adjusted per trough levels.

He was assisted to ambulate. PT recommended return to his home
skilled nursing facilty.

The patient was also followed by Transplant Nephrology, who
monitored his need for hemodialysis. On HD 11 the patient was
noted to have increased urine output to 1040 mls. And creatinine
did not rise as quickly interdialytically. He was given PO lasix
and the nephrologists plan is to follow labs and volume status
to determine need for future hemodialysis. On [**10-2**], the
creatinine was noted to have fallen to 3.7, which was the first
drop in this value without dialysis intervention. He is also
continuing to make  greater than a liter of urine daily.
