History of Present Illness:
This is a 82 year old male with Hx CAD, CHF (systolic and
diastolic with EF 45%), bronchiectasis who presents with SOB and
cough. He reports feeling well yesterday. Then he awoke this
morning with severe coughing, rhinorrhea and SOB. He reports
coughing up a small amount of blood tinged sputum x4 today. He
states the he has a chronic cough productive of light yellow
sputum and that this has been unchanged except for the blood
tinge this am. His wife states that he was also cold and chilled
- shaking, ? rigors- but denies fevers.  He vomited x 1 enroute
to the hospital in the ambulance.

In the ED: On arrival the patient had a temp of 101.6. He
vomited x1. He was found to have a new left upper and [**Last Name (un) 8490**] lobe
infiltrates on CXR and was given CTX, Vanc and Azithromycin. UA
neg. BNP 529. Lactate 3.0. Trop <0.01 and EKG w/o any new
ischemic changes. Initially, the patient's vitals were BP 155/70
RR 20 92% RA. he then dropped his BP to 80/40; inc SBP to 90's
with one liter but did not respond further to the second liter.
Rt IJ placed. On transfer to the floor the patient's vitals
were, HR 60 BP 95/42 RR 20 100% 4L, mid 94% on 2L.

Pertinent Results:
[**2137-12-9**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT:
CONCLUSIONS:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the
inferior and inferolateral walls and mild global hypokinesis of
the remaining segments (LVEF = 30-35%). Right ventricular
chamber size is normal with borderline normal free wall
function. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area
<0.8cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion. A 4cm hyperechoic
"mass" is seen in the liver parenchyma.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2137-10-29**], the
severity of aortic stenosis has progressed and regional LV
dysfunction is now suggested. The liver echogenic "mass" was
also present on the prior study (and [**2137-4-11**] and [**2135-10-18**]).
If clinically [**Month/Day/Year 9304**], an abdominal CT or ultrasound may be
useful to characterize the liver abnormality.

[**2137-12-8**] PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
There are new multifocal patchy opacities in the left lung, with
blunting of the left lateral sulcus likely representing small
pleural effusion. The right lung remains grossly clear. Allowing
for lordotic positioning and decreased lung volumes, the
cardiomediastinal contours are likely unchanged, with mural
calcifications noted along the aortic arch, and with coronary
artery stents in place. Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is
not more than before. Degenerative changes are again noted along
the thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION: New multifocal patchy opacities in the left lung
could represent multifocal pneumonia. Small left pleural
effusion. Allowing for decreased lung volumes, cardiomediastinal
contours likely unchanged.

[**2137-12-12**] CHEST AP PORTABLE, SINGLE VIEW:
INDICATION: A right-sided PICC line is now identified, seen to
terminate in the lower SVC close to the expected entrance into
the right atrium. To assure safe position, withdrawal by 4 cm is
recommended. A previously existing ([**12-8**]) right internal
jugular central venous line has been removed. No pneumothorax is
identified. The previously described, mostly left mid and lower
lung field densities remain. No new abnormalities are
identified.
IMPRESSION: Successful placement of PICC line, recommend
withdrawal by 4 cm.

Brief Hospital Course:
# PNA and chronic bronchiectasis:
Patient with pneumonia by clinical history and portable chest
xray showing LLL infiltrate upon admission. Originally triaged
to medical intensive care unit due to concerns for hypotension
and evolving sepsis; however, patient's blood pressures
stabilized with fluids and he never required vasoactive agents.
