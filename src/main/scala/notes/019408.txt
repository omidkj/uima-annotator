History of Present Illness:
This was a 54-year-old woman with
a several month history of intermittent hematochezia. A
preoperative colonoscopy demonstrated an ulcerated mass in
the mid transverse [**Month/Year (2) 499**]. Biopsies demonstrated
adenocarcinoma of uncertain depth. The patient had a
substantial history of alcohol ingestion with an enlarged
liver on physical examination. Her preoperative liver
function tests were significant only for mild elevation of
her transaminases. Her CEA was 4.5. A preoperative CT scan of
the torso demonstrated no evidence of metastasis. She did not
have any findings suggestive of portal hypertension. She had
no ascites or carcinomatosis. Resection of her tumor was
advised and accepted.

.
[**3-5**] Torso CT scan: no PE, moderate bilateral pleural effusions,
s/p transverse colectomy, with apparently intact anastomotic
site and no large fluid collection around anastomotic site,
increasing pneumoperitoneum, no evidence of obstruction or
breakdown at the anastomotic site.
[**3-15**] CT Abd/Pelvis: Rectal contrast was fills long Hartmann
pouch, suboptimally filling the apical region. NO extravasation
of contrast, though extraluminal air adjacent to the suture at
the apex of the pouch has increased since [**3-14**], raising
concern for a leak at the apex of the pouch. unchanged bilateral
pleural effusions, There has been a very mild increase in fluid
in the lesser sac. Fluid anterior to the left lobe of liver is
decreased since [**3-14**]
.
[**3-19**] CT Thorax: Moderate size simple bliateral effusions with
associated compressive atelectasis, slightly decreased from
prior. No evidence for loculations.
.
[**3-21**] CT Abd: Contrast filling the Hartmann's pouch, without
definite evidence of extraluminal contrast, however, persistent
air and stranding, unchanged from prior study is still noted.
.
[**3-27**] B/L LENI: No DVT
.
[**4-9**] CXR: Moderate bilateral pleural effusions larger on the
left side and associated with atelectasis are unchanged. There
is no pulmonary edema.
Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. There is no
pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2158-3-2**] a transverse colectomy was performed without
complication. On POD#1 noted to have hct drop from 25 to 20,
requiring 4uPRBCs on POD#1 to POD#2. On POD#2, Pt became SOB,
which was worse lying completely flat, and kept her from taking
deep breaths. Patient had increasing O2 requirement, cxr showed
edema, no diuresis was done. Pt also admits cough w/ occasional
sputum -clear, and fevers/chills. On POD#3 (day of transfer to
ICU), respiratory distress worsened with increasing O2
requirements to nc and face mask to keep sats >95%. A CT of
torso performed, (-) for PE, (+) pneumoperitoneum without
limitated extravasation of contrast, thought likely small
performation that had sealed off. Patient given 20mg IV lasix
for diuresis, initiated transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. Vital signs prior to
transfer: t99 (was 101.1 1hr prior to transfer), 105, 120s/70,
rr24, 98% 8L, access 2pIVs.
.
54yoF pod #3 from transverse colectomy, hx pad, emphysema,
ethanol abuse, transferred for hypoxemic respiratory failure.
 .
In the ICU:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure- started POD#2, with hypoxia on
NC. DDx includes PE, but CTA is negative and pt is on SQH. Pt
may have become fluid overloaded s/p 4u PRBC. Pt shows moderate
pleural effusions that were not present on the CT scan on [**2-22**].
TRALI syndrome also a possiblity, which has been known to occur
upto 6 hours after blood transfusion. Infection unlikely w/o wbc
and infiltrate on CT. Pt also shows atalectasis that may be
contributing.
- O2 on NC/facemask
- check serial ABGs
- BNP and Echo
.
2. [**Name (NI) 27812**] pt??????s HR 130s, in sinus tach on EKG. Also pt??????s BP
dropped to 80/60.
-  bolus with imporvement
.
# Leukopenia- may show early sepsis. Pt beginning to become
hypotensive,
.
# Pneumoperitoneum- [**1-30**] surgery.
- vanco/zosyn
- serial lactates
- serial abd exams
.
# Etoh withdrawl
-  valium 5 q4, CIWA >10
.
# COPD- none at home
- alb/ipratrop nebs

anastomotic bleed then leak >> [**2158-3-6**] returned to OR for ex lap,
R colectomy, end ileostomy, Hartmann's procedure
[**3-8**]
- pt given colloid- Albumin 25g after UOP near 30-40cc, w/o
signifcant change
- restarted vasopresin, then later levophed
- f/u hct 25.6 stable
______________________________________
[**3-9**]
- U/o excellent with lasix 10 IV
- Off pressors
- Goal u/o per [**Doctor First Name **] is 100cc/h, redose lasix when u/o drops
below 100cc/h
- NGT in right place
_________________________________________
[**3-10**]
- diuresed
- tachypneic - checked abg

[**3-11**]
- Pt was not on pressure support of 12, stayed on 15, when
turned down to 12 (around MN)pt's RR incr 40s. Pt also became
agitated and given sedative, and needed to be on Assist, now
back on pressure support at 15.
- lasix 10mg IV x1 tapered off around 10pm, given lasix 20mg IV
x1 around 10pm. At 6am pt was -1.2L and given another 10 IV
lasix at 6am
- swab from fluid- speciation back: growing E.coli, Klebsiella -
pan-sensitive
- tbili coming down
________________________________________
[**3-12**]
- Started lasix gtt because the pt was hypotensive this am in
the setting of sedation and bolused lasix
- Got 50ml albumin for hypotension
- Started fentanyl gtt in order to get the pt off benzos as
there is some concern for worsening MS in the setting of Versed
