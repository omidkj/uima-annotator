Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 45**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer from osh for cath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Coronary catheterization with balloon angioplasty of right PDA.
Intra-Aortic Balloon Pump placement


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 75 yof with pmh of dm2, htn, hypothyroid who experienced
acute sob while cooking dinner.  Went to [**Hospital 11047**] hospital where
she was noted to have mild htn (sbp 140) and evidence
desaturation (spO2 90%) ECG with STD in inferior pattern.
.
Exam consistent with acute L heart failure (rales, but no
peripheral edema), patient required intubation secondary to
hypotension and desaturation.  Once intubated stabilized given
dobutamine for hypotension and bradycardia.  Transferred to
[**Hospital1 **] for urgent cath.
.
At cath with spb 96/66, pa 35/15 stat echo in lab without
evidence of tamponade or severe valve disease (1+mr) rpda to,
crossed and ballon dilated with good improvement in flow and
hemodynamics.  Iabp placed for hemodynamic support and
transferred to ccu.  Of note cath lab produced >2L urine.

ECHO (EF 25%): Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. There is severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed. Tissue velocity imaging
E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Resting regional wall motion
abnormalities include severe hypokinesis to akinesis of the
distal [**12-29**] of the left ventricle. No definite left ventricular
thrombus seen but cannot exclude. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are
no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the
presence of elevated right sided pressures. There is a
restrictive left ventricular filling pattern consistent with
severe diastolic dysfunction.
.
CT chest: IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral multifocal pulmonary opacities, more consistent
with pneumonia or aspiration than with pulmonary edema.
2. Large bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Three-vessel coronary artery disease as stated in the
provided history. Extensive atherosclerotic disease in other
visualized vessels.


Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF OVERVIEW: The patient is an 86 yo female with a history of
diabetes who presented with acute shortness of breath to an OSH
where she was intubated and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent
catheterization.  Catheterization revealed diffuse disease
including an obstructed PCA (RCA) that was ballooned open.
Because the cath was considered high risk and she was thought to
be a potential CABG candidate, no stenting was performed.  It
appeared that hemodynamics improved s/p ballooning, though the
patient had been in what appeared to be cardiogenic shock.  As a
result, IABP was placed.  The patient did well and was diuresed
aggressively.  She was extubated the following day after having
the balloon pump removed.  She required a short course of BiPAP
just after extubation and improved consistently from there.  She
was seen by PT/OT and recommended for a short stay at a rehab
facility.  UTI and possible pneumonia (found on CT chest 2 days
after extubation - pt afebrile without leukocytosis) were
treated with a 10 day course of abx.
.
## CAD -
#Ischemia: The patient was noted to have 3 vd on cath.  PDA was
totally occluded and was thought to be the culprit vessel.  It
was ballooned open with some improvement in hemodynamics, but
with residual 30% stenosis post-balloon.  The patient was
started on ASA, Plavix and lipitor 80.  BB and ACEI were
initially held as a balloon pump was placed to assist with
afterload reduction.  The patient was started on ACEI, nitro,
and BB over the next 24 hours.  She did well and the balloon
pump was removed within 24 hours after her cath.  Following
balloon pump removal, the pt was extubated.  She did well
initially but shortly thereafter her O2 saturations decreased
and she was started on BiPAP, which she tolerated well.  The
BiPAP was weaned off after some hours and she did well on NRB
face mask.  Over the next 24 hours she moved from mask to NC.
During this time she did not appear to have any specific ST
changes.  For this reason, it was not clear that the patient had
a new ischemic event leading to the pulmonary edema or ongoing.
She was evaluated by the CT surgeons for CABG and thought not to
be an appropriate candidate.  Some consideration of LAD stenting
was given, but the patient improved dramatically over time and
it was not clear that the decompensation was due to an acute
event.  It was felt that the risks of revascularization
outweighed the benefits at this hospitalization.  She should be
continued on a full medical management with
ASA/Plavix/Statin/BB/ACEI.
.
#Pump:  Echo was done in the cath lab without obvious segmental
wma.  EF 25%, severe hypokinesis of distal [**12-29**] LV. PCWP>18. mild
pulm htn, severe diastolic dysfunction with restrictive filling
pattern E/A 1.29.  ?new secondary to ischema given 3VD vs
exacerbation heart failure.  Throughout the first days of her
hospitalization the pt was on propofol while intubated and her
HR and BP remained low and she was on dobutamine.  When her
sedation was lightened, her vitals returned and she was weaned
from pressors and she was started on BB and ACEI for
cardioprotection.
.
#Rhythm: The patient remained in sinus rhythm throughout her
stay.
.
## respiratory - The patient presented from the OSH intubated
for flash pulmonary edema.  She was sedated and remained
intubated for the first two days of her hospitalization.  At the
time of her catheterization, her right sided pressures were
normal.  Thereafter, the right sided pressures were low
following rapid diuresis. She received a small amount of fluids
and her PAP returned to [**Location 213**].  At that point she was
overbreathing the vent, and the settings were pressure support
with minimal PEEP.  She was extubated and initially did well.
However, after 1-2 hours she became increasingly SOB.  A CXR
showed some pulmonary edema, and ABG showed some decreased
oxygenation.  She was put on BiPAP for support and weaned to O2
facemask over some hours.  The following day she was put on
nasal cannula and continued to breathe well.  A chest CT showed
large effusions bilaterally and infiltrates more c/w PNA than
with fluid overload.  The patient did not have a leukocytosis
nor was she febrile, but in light of these imaging findings, she
was started on levofloxacin for 10d course.
