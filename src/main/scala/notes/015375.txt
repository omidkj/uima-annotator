HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72 year-old gentleman
with known peripheral vascular disease who has had multiple
lower extremity bypasses and he has recently underwent a left
lower arteriogram which revealed focal stenosis of the distal
superficial femoral artery and he had single vessel runoff
via the peroneal with an occluded dorsalis pedis graft. The
patient was admitted the night before for IV hydration and
antibiotics for elective left femoral popliteal re-do bypass
graft.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

C daily, aspirin daily. Insulin is NPH insulin 32 units q
A.M. and 38 units q P.M. with 4 of regular insulin at lunch.

ILLNESSES:  Include a history of atrial fibrillation,
anticoagulated, history of coronary artery disease, status
post myocardial infarction. History of congestive heart
failure, compensated. History of aortic stenosis. History of
hypertension. History of type 2 diabetes. History of
ankylosing spondylitis. History of left heel osteomyelitis.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Includes left below knee popliteal
with dorsalis pedis with PTFE and multiple foot debridements.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs: 98.3, 98, 18, [**Year (4 digits) **]
pressure 158/70, oxygen saturation 99%. Glucose 217. General
appearance: An alert male in no acute distress. Heart is
regular rate and rhythm. Lungs are clear to auscultation
bilaterally. Pulse examination shows palpable femorals
bilaterally 2+, popliteals are 1+ bilaterally. The dorsalis
pedis are absent bilaterally and the posterior tibials are
monophasic Dopplerable signals only bilaterally.

ADMITTING LABORATORIES:  Included white count of 10.1,
hematocrit 35.4, BUN 25, creatinine 0.8, INR 1.2. Chest x-ray
was unremarkable. Electrocardiogram was without acute changes
and in normal sinus rhythm with left anterior hemiblock. Vein
mappings were done the previous admission.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was prepared for surgery and
underwent a left popliteal posterior tibial bypass with non-
reverse lesser saphenous vein angioscopy and valve lysis on
[**2183-10-29**]. He tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred to the post anesthesia care unit in stable
condition. The patient was transferred intubated. He had a
triphasic graft pulse. Dressing was stained, saturated with
[**Year (4 digits) **]. Patient remained in the post anesthesia care unit
overnight. Plastic surgery was consulted regarding the
patient's left heel and anticipated debridement and flap
closure. Patient was extubated overnight and on postoperative
day 1 remained afebrile. His graft was Dopplerable with a
warm foot. Hematocrit was 30.3. His fluids were Hep-locked
and diet was advanced as tolerated. He was placed on
subcutaneous heparin for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis.
He was continued on Vancomycin, ciprofloxacin and Flagyl and
transferred to the Vascular Intensive Care Unit for continued
monitoring and care. Patient remained on bed rest. Patient on
postoperative day 2 with  low urinary output, was begun on
Dopamine with improvement in his urinary output.
Postoperative day 3 Dopamine was weaned. His T-max was 100 to
97.8. [**Year (4 digits) **] pressure 113/44. O2 saturations 97% on 3 liters.
Physical examination was unremarkable. Patient's diet was
advanced. He was ambulated and assessed by physical therapy
who felt he would require rehabilitation. Patient's home
medications were begun and anticoagulation was held in
anticipation of plastic surgery.

The patient underwent a left foot plantar ulcer debridement
and left plantar flap closure of the wound on [**2183-11-3**]. Patient tolerated the procedure well an was transferred
to the post anesthesia care unit in stable condition. He did
have an episode in the post anesthesia care unit of
supraventricular tachycardia by monitor. Electrocardiogram
was without acute changes. Electrolytes were unremarkable.
Patient continued to well and was transferred to the regular
nursing floor for continued care.

Patient's Vancomycin, levofloxacin and Flagyl were
discontinued on [**2183-11-5**] and Augmentin 500 mg t.i.d.
was begun. Initial dressing was removed on postoperative day
#  The remaining hospital course was unremarkable. Patient
will be transferred to rehabilitation when bed is available.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Left heel wound secondary to failed
graft.
Status post left popliteal to posterior tibial bypass with
nonreverse saphenous vein, angioscopy and valve lysis.
Status post left foot plantar ulcer debridement with plantar
flap and wound closure on [**2183-11-3**].
Postoperative [**Year (4 digits) **] loss anemia transfused, corrected.
Postoperative intravascular volume depletion with low urinary
output, resolved, requiring Dopamine, resolved.
History of peripheral vascular disease, status post left
below knee popliteal to dorsalis pedis bypass, failed.
History of hypertension, controlled.
History of ischemic heart disease with a history of
myocardial infarction, stable.
History of congestive heart failure, compensated.
History of aortic stenosis.
History of ankylosis spondylitis with severe kyphosis.
Type 2 diabetes, insulin dependent, controlled.
History of tobacco use.
