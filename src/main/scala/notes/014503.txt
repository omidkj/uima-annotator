Physical Exam:
PE: 96.7 HR 73-110 BP 121-166/79-90 94% 4L n/c
Gen: NAD, A&O X3
Heent: EOMI, PERRL
Neck: No LAD + JVD to Jaw
Heart: Irregular, No mrg.
Lungs: crackles [**12-5**]-way up
Abd: +BS, S/NT/ND
Ext: No edema

Pertinent Results:
ECG [**3-18**]: AF at 111 bpm, borderline LAD, no ST-T deviation,
unchanged from admission
.
CXR [**3-18**]: Development of increased interstitial markings
consistent with edema. Interval improvement in left basilar
infiltrate.
CXR [**3-17**]: Left lower lobe consolidation.
.
CT head: Neg
.
[**12-19**] CXR: B pleural effusions; flash pulm edema.  No discrete
consolidation seen
.
ECHO [**3-20**]:
The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The aortic
root is moderately dilated athe sinus level. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is
seen. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is
increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with
the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2186-12-19**], findings are
similar. Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now
slightly lower.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 57139**] is a 81 yo F with A fib who presented with URI
symptoms, CXR evidence of a small LLL pneumonia, rapid a fib and
HTN.  She was admitted to the floor and during the day on [**3-18**]
she received intermittent doses of metoprolol 5mg IV for HR in
120s as well as IVF totaling ~1.5L. ~4:20pm, she was suddenly
noted to have an O2 sat of 84% on 3L and subsequently was 91% on
NRB. Her lung exam was noted to be more rhoncorous. She was also
hypertensive to the 180s-190s. CXR showed flash pulmonary edema.
ABG was 7.39/33/51 on NRB. She received 20mg IV lasix with good
UOP (although she was incontinent of urine so exact amount not
recorded). A Foley was placed. She was ordered for Vanc and CTX
IV and nitro paste was applied. Repeat ABG was 7.4/34/81.  She
was then transferred to the ICU
.
In the ICU her ABX cvg was narrowed to levoquin and Ms.
[**Known lastname 56855**] remained afebrile w/o leukocytosis.  Her CXR
subsuquently looked more like CHF.  She diuresed 1.7L since ICU
admission with improvement in hypoxia; also her metoprolol and
diltiazem were increased with improvement in HTN and heart rate.
 She also ruled out for MI with negative cardiac enzymes x 3.
At this point she was trasnferred back to the floor where her
care was continued. with diltiazem 45 qid and metoprolol 75 tid
for her HTN and rapid a fib; she was furhter diuresed about 1 L
with improvement in her oxygen requirement although she did have
a waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] oxygen requirement .  With regards to her
pneumonia, she remained afebrile without leukocytosis.  She
completed a 5day course of antibiotics in-house but was still
bothered by a cough.

 Ms [**Known lastname 56855**] has also had some confusion, vivid dreams, and
hallucinations since admission.  She was not agitated at all and
was award of her hallucinations.  She states that she sometimes
has the same symptoms at home, although according to her
daughter they were worse in-house.  Sedating medications were
withheld and her levaquin was changed to cefpodoxime because of
the frequent neurologic side effects of this medication.  She
also had significant reversal of day and night cycle and some
delerium although she remained oriented at all times.

Physical therapy worked with the patient and cleared her for
home with PT and walker, but because of the patient's lingering
oxygen requirement the decision was made to send her to rehab.
