Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 66-year-old
gentleman with a known history of CAD and end-stage renal
disease, although not on hemodialysis, developed shortness of
breath and PND on [**2119-5-21**] prior to admission.  He
presented to [**Hospital3 4527**] Hospital in respiratory
distress and was intubated.  He usually takes Lasix,
Zaroxolyn, and cyclosporin for his renal disease and he
discontinued all of these approximately four days prior to
coming into the [**Hospital1 **].  He ruled in for a myocardial
infarction with a peak CK of 823 and 10% MB with a troponin
of 2.8.  Echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 50%.
His baseline creatinine was 5 which increased to 8.1 with a
BUN of 84 at [**Hospital3 4527**].

He had a Perma-Cath placed for potential dialysis and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  He was extubated prior to his
transfer.  He was admitted here to the CCU on IV
nitroglycerin, was diuresed.  Cardiac catheterization on [**2119-5-23**] showed tight ostial LAD lesion, 100% occlusion of
his OM1 and severe diffuse disease of his RCA.  No LV gram
was done given his chronic renal insufficiency.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He smokes approximately one-half a pack of
cigarettes per day with a 50 year smoking history.  He stated
that he had not had any alcohol abuse in more than four
years.  He lives at home with his wife.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  HEENT:  The EOMs were
intact.  The pupils were equally round and reactive to light
and accommodation.  His oropharynx had no obvious
restriction.  His neck was supple.  He had no lymphadenopathy
or thyromegaly.  Carotids were 2+ bilaterally with bilateral
bruits.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart:
He had normal S1 and S2 sounds with no murmurs, rubs, or
gallops.  Abdomen:  Benign with no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities:  He had no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  He had
2+ pulses throughout peripherally in his legs and a nonfocal
neurologic examination.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   He was referred to Dr.[**Name (NI) 18056**] Cardiac
Surgery.  Carotid studies from the outside hospital showed
the possibility of a proximal stenosis and subclavian steal.
It was questioned whether or not he needed an MRI to
determine the extent of this disease.  He had severe calcium
plaque in both common and internal carotid arteries with a
moderate stenosis at 60-80% on the right internal.  He was
admitted to the CCU.  He was seen by the Renal Team who
discontinued his Procrit and changed his dose of Neurontin.

He was seen by Case Management and managed in the ICU.  He
was started on hemodialysis in which he received his first
dialysis on [**2119-5-24**] via the Perma-Cath that had been
placed.  The plan was that he would complete a couple of
hemodialysis runs to help tune him up in preparation for his
coronary artery bypass grafting by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**].

He was also seen by the Transplant Service for eventual
access for his permanent hemodialysis.  He was also seen by
Clinical Nutrition and completed his second run of
hemodialysis on [**2119-5-25**].  Laboratories before the
operation revealed a sodium of 138, K 3.5, BUN 66, creatinine
7.7, blood sugar 85.  White count 8.2, hematocrit 31.1,
platelet count 234,000.  PTT of 54.7, INR 1.1.

On [**2119-5-26**], he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting
times four with a LIMA to LAD, vein graft to the PDA, and a
vein graft sequentially to OM1 and diagonal by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**].  He
was transferred to the Cardiothoracic ICU in stable condition
A paced on a propofol drip.

On postoperative day number one, his pressor support was
increased for climbing PC02.  He was A paced with a blood
pressure of 91/41.  He was on CPAP with a blood gas of
7.30/46/120/24/-3.  His white count was 11.4 with a
hematocrit of 30.5, platelet count 214,000.  He remained in
the ICU for monitoring on a Neo-Synephrine drip at 1.0
micrograms per kilogram per minute.  His nitroglycerin had
been weaned off.  He started his aspirin and continued on
perioperative antibiotics.  He was receiving Toradol for
pain.

On [**2119-5-27**], he had another run of hemodialysis on
postoperative day number two.  He had been extubated, was
saturating 95% on 3 liters and was neurologically responsive
and alert.  He was in sinus rhythm with a blood pressure of
143/48, BUN 32, creatinine 5.1, K 4.6.  He was seen daily by
the Renal fellow.  He was evaluated by Physical Therapy on
postoperative day number three.  He remained in the ICU for
management of his volume status.  His white count was 10.4
with a hematocrit of 29.7, BUN 46, creatinine 6.4 with a K of
4.1.  His blood pressure remained in the 150s/approximately
50-60.

He continued to improve and on [**2119-5-29**] was transferred
out to the floor with his right IJ Quinton in place.  His
breathing continued to improve.  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of
Transplant Surgery was consulted to give him a tunnel
catheter as well as an AV fistula creation for long-term
hemodialysis.  Nephrocaps were added to his medical dosing.

On postoperative day number four, his incisions were clean,
dry, and intact.  His heart was regular in rate and rhythm.
His lungs were clear bilaterally.  His creatinine held at
5.1.  His hematocrit dropped again from 29.7 to 26.4 with a
white count of 7.6.  His Captopril was increased for better
blood pressure control to 100 mg p.o. t.i.d.  His Foley was
pulled.  He was also seen by Case Management who was working
with Physical Therapy every day.  He had another run of
dialysis on [**2119-5-31**] which he tolerated well with a plan
to go to the OR after dialysis for his Perma-Cath placement
and/or creation of his AV fistula.

On [**2119-5-31**], he had a right IJ Perma-Cath placed under
fluoroscopy by the Transplant Service.  He was also seen by
Social Work on [**2119-6-1**] as he was expressing signs of
depression and wanted a consult from the social worker.
Follow-up hemodialysis was arranged for [**Hospital 4265**] Health Care
Services in [**University/College **] with his next scheduled hemodialysis
for [**2119-6-6**] as he was due to have it here at [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2119-6-2**] prior to discharge.

On postoperative day number six, he had decreased breath
sounds at the bases, saturating 95% on 3 liters nasal
cannula.  His heart was regular rate and rhythm with clean,
dry, and intact incisions.  He was requiring some 02 with his
ambulation and we were awaiting physical therapy evaluation
to see what he would do without oxygen while he was
ambulating with a plan to discharge him after more definitive
PT evaluation.

He was seen again by Renal on [**2119-6-2**] as part of his
dialysis.  His blood pressure was 130/60.  He was continuing
to sat 95% on 2 liters on postoperative day number seven with
some mild pedal edema with a T maximum of 98.3, sinus rhythm
in the 50s.  He was transfused 2 units of packed red blood
cells for his low hematocrit and was seen again by Renal on
the morni
