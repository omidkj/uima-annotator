History of Present Illness:
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  70M, discharged from here [**6-14**], was
discovered to be hypotensive by his visiting nurse. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**]
a left popliteal artery aneurysm repair with superficial femoral
artery to distal above knee bypass complicated by respiratory
failure on [**6-1**].  He was treated for
pneumonia with Levaquin 750 mg daily, a course which he
completed
today.  According to family, his blood pressure has been
dropping
in the last two to three days. His family has noticed he has
been
more confused today than in the past and since yesterday he has
been increasingly more short of breath to the point where his O2
saturation dropped into the 70s requiring an increase in his
home
oxygen to 2 liters by nasal cannula.  The patient denies any
chest pain or palpitations.  He does admit to feeling
lightheaded
when he stands up.  He is voiding normal except for decreased
volume.  He has had poor p.o. intake since his discharge and he
has noticed his left leg continues to remain swollen.


Past Medical History:
-CAD s/p CABG
-abdominal aortic aneurysm
-iliac artery aneurysm
-ischemic cardiomyopathy
-restrictive lung disease, no evidence of obstruction, present
for quite some time and likely due to his elevated hemidiaphragm
from his initial cardiac surgery
-TTE: LVEF 35-40%, inferolateral LV HK with moderate AR
-hyperlipidemia
-peptic ulcer disease

Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use, but prior significant use. Widower. There is no history of
alcohol abuse.


Family History:
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death.

GENERAL:  NAD
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 97.3, blood pressure 100/60, pulse 83,
respiratory rate of 20, O2 sat 93% on 2 liters.
HEENT:  Oropharynx moist mucous membranes.
LUNGS:  CTA
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm, distant S1 and S2, no murmurs.
ABDOMEN:  Benign.
EXTREMITIES:  LLE [**12-4**]+ edema, staples removed,

Brief Hospital Course:
[**6-18**] Evaluated as outpt by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED
with Symptomatic hypotension, Congestive heart failure.

Vascular Ed/Admission Assessment: 70M presents with hypotension,
ARF, and hypercarbic
respiratory failure.
Volume status:  although he has a CVP of 12 he usually needs
higher filling pressures.  We will bolus to see how he responds
and monitor his oxygenation status.
ARF likely pre-renal although his Fena would indicate an element
of ATN.
His hypercarbic failure is secondary to poor baseline status and
fatigue.  He may have an underlying infectious process driving
his pathologies.

PLAN:  admit to icu
optimize fluid status and wean pressor
f/u LLE u/s to r/o dvt
bipap to support his ventilation
pan culture - start empiric antibiotics for a Wc of 13.
