Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**]
Chief Complaint:
CODE STROKE

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Endoscopic placement of a PEG tube


History of Present Illness:
The pt. is a 71 year-old right-handed woman who presented with
acute onset left-sided weakness and slurred speech.
.
The history is mostly obtained per EMS who transported the pt,
who took from husband. Pt herself supplemented history. Pt was
in USOH yesterday.  Awoke needing to use the bathroom with
headache at 245am.  Pt got up and went to use the bathroom
without difficulty. Minutes later, the husband heard a loud
noise from the bathroom and found the pt on the floor, unable to
move her left side.  Apparently, he repeatedly attempted to lift
the pt back to bed until calling EMS roughly 60 to 90 minutes
later.  She was brought to the ED for further evaluation.
.
She offered no complaints at the time of my encounter.
.
This examiner was paged for Code Stroke at 0414, I was at
bedside by 0416. Pt arrived via EMS also at 0416. NIHSS was
completed by 0425. CT scan was performed and reviewed by me at
0440.  There was no ICH. Discussion with stroke fellow occurred
at 0445. As NIHSS was 19, CT negative for ICH, and husband
denied all contraindications, decision was made to proceed with
tPA. tPA bolus was started at 0456 based on estimated 60kg body
weight.

Past Medical History:
-hypertension
-CAD with h/o MIs, s/p CABG and valve replacement 3 years ago

Radiologic Data
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2143-5-3**] 12:21 PM
IMPRESSION:
Cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. Left lower lobe effusion and
atelectasis.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2143-5-3**] 12:21 PM
FINDINGS: There is no effacement of the cerebral sulci with loss
of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation at the supply territory of
the right middle cerebral artery, compatible with an evolving
subacute infarct (series 2, image 16). However, no hyperdense
foci, or fluid collections can be identified to suggest
hemorrhagic transformation, or intracranial hematoma. Again,
there is no hydrocephalus, displacement of the normally midline
structures, or effacement of the basal cisterns. Review of bone
windows demonstrates CT features of prior bilateral
mastoidectomy. The remainder of the paranasal sinuses is
normally aerated.
CONCLUSION: CT features of an evolving subacute infarct
involving the right middle cerebral artery supply territory,
with no evidence of hemorrhagic transformation at present.
.
MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2143-5-3**] 10:39 AM
FINDINGS: This is a limited study, with only diffusion-weighted
images and sagittal T1 images performed. The sagittal T1 series
is severely limited by motion artifact, of limited diagnostic
value. Diffusion-weighted images demonstrate a wedge-shaped area
of slow diffusion confined within the supply territory of the
right middle cerebral artery, distal to the lenticular striate
arteries.
CONCLUSION: Limited study, with only DWI and T1 images
performed. MR features of acute infarct confined to the right
middle cerebral artery supply territory.
.
CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE PORT  [**2143-5-3**] 3:57 PM
FINDINGS: Duplex evaluation was performed of both carotid
arteries, somewhat difficult study due to patient. This is a
portable study in emergency room with the patient agitated and
unstable. On the right, peak systolic velocities are 77, 58, 77
in the ICA, CCA, and ECA respectively. The ICA to CCA ratio is
1.3. This is consistent with less than 40% stenosis. On the
left, peak systolic velocities are 100, 31, 147 in the ICA, CCA,
and ECA respectively. The ICA to CCA ratio is 3. This is
consistent with less than 40% stenosis. There is antegrade flow
in both vertebral arteries.
IMPRESSION: Somewhat difficult to perform study due to details
listed above. There does not appear to be any significant
carotid stenosis. Based on velocities, there is less than 40%
carotid stenosis bilaterally. If more information is required, a
repeat study under better circumstances or an MRI may be
warranted.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2143-5-3**] 4:23 AM
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, mass effect, shift
of the normally midline structures, or infarction. The
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation appears preserved. Mild
periventricular white matter hypodensities are consistent with
chronic microvascular ischemia. There is no hydrocephalus. The
osseous structures are unremarkable. There is mild mucosal
thickening of the left maxillary sinus.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of hemorrhage or infarction. MRI with
diffusion-weighted images should be performed for further
evaluation.
.
ECG [**2143-5-3**]  4:17:16 AM
Atrial fibrillation with a moderate ventricular response.
Possible anterior and inferior wall myocardial infarction.
Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities. No previous tracing
available for comparison.
.
ECG [**2143-5-3**]  1:36:42 PM
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Premature ventricular contractions or aberrant ventricular
conduction.
Left axis deviation
Intraventricular conduction defect
Old inferior infarct
Lateral ST-T changes may be due to myocardial ischemia
Repolarization changes may be partly due to rhythm
Low QRS voltages in limb leads
Since previous tracing of [**2143-5-3**], Ventricular rate is increased

.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2143-5-4**] 4:03 AM
FINDINGS: There has been interval evolvement of focal sulcal
effacement and edema in a right MCA distribu
