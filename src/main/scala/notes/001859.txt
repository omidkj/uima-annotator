Chief Complaint:
SOB, increasing pedal edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation, with successful extubation.


History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname 94522**] [**Known lastname 94523**] is a 46-year-old gentleman with h/o DMI, ESRD on HD,
HIV (VL <50, CD4 393 [**2-13**]), recently diagnosed PE, and multiple
ED admissions for HTN urgency who presented to the ED with
complaints of SOB and LE that had progressed throughout the
evening. Sicne 11PM night PTA, dyspnea increased and patient
sought eval in ED. In [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] report, patient was 89% RA, and
100% on a 4L NC, appeared comfortable. EKG showed mildly peaked
Ts, and he was treated with calcium, bicarb, and D50/insulin.
Approximately 1/2 hour later, patient became acutely dyspneic
and tachypneic. Repeat EKG showed anterolateral ST segment
elevations. SBP was in 240s at that time. EKG was reviewed with
cardiology attending and cath lab was activated. Patient was
started on Bipap, nitro gtt, nipride gtt, and given lasix 100mg
IV. Breathing status looked poor, he was intubated using
Rocuronium for paralysis given ESRD. He was given heparin and
integrillin boluses for presumed ACS. Repeact CXR showed acute
pulmonary edema. Repeat EKG showed that ST segment elevations
had resolved with BP control. Bedside ECHO was done by
cardiology fellow and no wall motion abnormalities were noted.
Cath was deferred, and patient was admitted to MICU for further
management.

annular
calcification.

Brief Hospital Course:
46M HIV, ESRD on HD p/w shortness of breath, intubated for
respiratory distress.
.
# RESPIRATORY DISTRESS  Initially presented in an event that
appears that most recent event is secondary to acute pulmonary
edema. CXR with new pulmonary edema that developed over 1 hour.
Was emergently intubated and given nitroglycerin gtt.
Siginficantly improved with dialysis but had focal infiltrate on
post-dialysis cxr thought due to pneumonia (as well as fever).
Thus was initially started on vanc/meropenem that was changed to
just vancomycin qhd once sputum culture showed GPCs.  Was
extubated without event on [**2109-7-19**] and continued to saturate
well, ultimately sating 97% on RA.  Was continued on vancomycin
for presumed CAP, was discharge on day 5 of 7 with continued
dosing per HD.  Volume status was continually monitored by I/Os
and daily weights.  He had HD on the day of discharge and
tolerated it well.  He will continue with his MWF HD where they
will monitor both his fluid status and vancomycin dosing.
.
# Benign Hypertension No history of CAD, ruled out for ACS upon
admit.  Transitory EKG changes with admit hypertension, resolved
with BP control. On multiple meds [**Date Range 3782**] with recurrent admits
for HTN urgency.  Simplified medications while inpatient.  Upon
discharge his morning antiHTN meds included Nifedipine CR 30mg,
lisinpril 30mg, metoprolol XL 12.5mg.  These differed
significantly from his admit medications.  During his stay, his
atenolol and valsartan were discontinued.  Nifedipine was
changed from 90 mg to CR 30 mg and Lisinopril was increased from
20 mg to 30 mg. Metoprolol 12.5 mg daily was added for
additional cardio-protection. We also changed his clonidine to a
patch instead of taking po clonidine.  He was instructed to
follow-up with both his PCP and renal physicians to adjust these
medications as needed.
.
# ESRD on HD.  Appreciate renal input.  Urgent HD x 3 last week,
with total volume decrease of 9kg.  This aided greatly in the
resolution of his pulmonary edema.  He will resume his normal
MWF HD this week.  His [**Date Range 766**] dialysis was peformed while
inpatient without incident.  Discharged on Cinacalcet and
Lanthanum per Renal recommendations.
.
# HIV/AIDS (VL <50, CD4 393 [**2-13**])  Was maintained on his [**Month/Year (2) 3782**]
HAART medication without interuptions while inpatient.  Was
discharged without altering these medications.
.
# H/O Pulmonary Embolus  Diagnosed [**6-24**] and with a newly
discovered clot on [**7-7**]. Supratherapeutic in ICU, for which
coumadin was briefly held.  Upon admission to the floor, was
restarted on warfarin 4mg po daily.  INR was monitored and was
therapeutic on discharge.  Will be followed in HD for continued
monitoring and adjustments as need.
.
# DM Type II Controlled - Last HbA1c [**2109-2-12**] 5.7.  Checked
with QAC and QHS finger sticks while inpatient. The patient
actually did not receive any insulin for 5 days, and did not get
any signs or sx of DKA. He reports at home that his AM FS is
80-90 and then post-prandial goes up to 100-115, after which he
then takes his NPH.  States he takes both long-acting insulin
and short-acting with meals. Given this, we strongly believe his
initial diagnosis of Type 1 DM was incorrect and in fact was a
very poorly controlled type 2. Upon discharge it was recommended
that he not take insulin unless his finger sticks were elevated
>200. At that point, if his FS >200, he was instructed to call
his primary care doctor to seek advice for continued insulin
management. Given this change, we established follow-up for Mr.
[**Known lastname 94523**] with the [**Hospital **] Clinic for [**7-26**] at 3 pm where this
will be addressed. At the recommendation of the [**Name8 (MD) **] NP, we
also drew C-PEPTIDE and INSULIN ANTIBODIES which were pending at
time of discharge and will be followed up at [**Last Name (un) **].
