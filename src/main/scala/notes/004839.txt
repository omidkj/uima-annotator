History of Present Illness:
86F s/p unwitnessed, reportedly mechanical fall down 4 steps on
[**5-28**]. Pt walking down steps, planting foot, and then remembers
waking up on the floor at the bottom of the steps, face down.
She was BIBA to an OSH boarded and collared where CT of the

MICROBIOLOGY:
No positive culture data.  Staph (coag neg) from one bottle [**5-31**]
likely contaminant.

IMAGING:
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 2853**] ([**5-28**]): Type 2 odontoid fracture with mild anterior
displacement of the C2 vertebral body in relation with the
odontoid process and malalignment at the fracture site. The
fracture demonstrates increased signal through the cleft
indicating acute nature of the fracture. There is also increased
signal in the posterior ligaments between occiput and C2 and
prevertebral soft tissue swelling. Mild increased signal
visualized within the spinal cord at C1 level indicating cord
edema/contusion. No evidence of extrinsic cord compression
identified. Multilevel degenerative changes are seen. Fluid
level noted within the sphenoid sinus.

CTA Neck ([**5-29**]): 1. Fractures through the anterior and posterior
arches of C1 as well as a type 2 dens fracture with posterior
angulation of the fracture fragment and mild canal narrowing.
There is no significant cord impingement; however, prominence of
soft tissues posterior to these fractures may represent a small
hematoma versus chronic degenerative changes. Continued imaging
for evaluation of this region is recommended. 2. Complete
collapse of the left lung due to intubation of the right
mainstem bronchus. 3. No vertebral artery injury or evidence of
vascular abnormalities.

CT Sinus [**5-28**]: 1. Rightward deviated bilateral nasal bone
fractures.
2. Non-displaced hairline fracture of the external table of the
left frontal sinus, without extension into the orbit. 3.
Fractures of the dens
and C1 with retrolisthesis of C1 on C2 as described above.

TTE [**5-29**]:  poor technical quality. Left ventricular function is
probably normal, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. The right ventricle is not well seen. No pathologic
valvular abnormality seen. At least moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.

PATHOLOGY: None


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the acute care surgery service on
[**2182-5-28**] for management of traumatic injuries sustained s/p fall
in the setting of possible syncope.  Patient arrived as trauma
to ED and was evaluated by ACS team as well as ortho spine, and
plastic surgery.  Imaging was obtained in emergency department
showing cervical spine fractures.  Patient admitted for
supportive care and observation.

Neuro: Patient with Parkinson's at baseline and presented report
of LOC s/p fall.  CT Head from OSH was negative for intracranial
bleed.  Plastics evaluated facial fractures and deemed these to
be non-operative.  Ortho spine consulted for cervical fractures
and recommended c-collar which was implemented.  Custom collar
obtained [**6-5**] and this was further customized to accommodate
patient's tracheostomy.

Patient experienced bradycardic/respiratory event [**5-29**] as per
below and required intubation.  A CT Head was obtained at this
time to assess for intracranial process and was again negative.
She was sedated appropriately for intervals during her
intubation.  When awakened patient was found not to be following
commands likely secondary to delirium.  Patient's mental status
improved and she was following commands by time of discharge.
Her neuro exam was non-focal throughout admission.  Pain control
was primarily via IV narcotics per ICU protocol.

CV: She has known hypertension.  Experienced a bradycardic event
(Code Blue) on [**5-29**] perhaps secondary to respiratory
etiology/mucus plugging.  She was emergently intubated during
the code. After the bradycardic event, she was stable from a
cardiovascular standpoint. Metoprolol dosing was titrated up
while in the ICU with no further events of bradycardia or
hypotension. ICU day 4 she was found to be anemic with no clear
bleeding source, but she was transfused to a hematocrit of 30 to
optimize oxygen delivery.

Pulmonary: She was intubated as above. She showed promise in
weaning off the vent early, but exhibited persistent
neck/face/tongue swelling such that extubation was not feasible.
A tracheostomy was performed [**6-6**]. Her trach showed minor
sanguinous secretions until discharge, easily managed with
intermittent suction. She was weaned off mechanical ventilation
and was oxygenating well on 40% trach mask.

GI/GU: She was found to be intravascularly depleted on arrival
to the ICU so was given several boluses of crystalloid followed
by albumin. On ICU day 3 we began diuresis with IV furosemide,
moving to a Lasix drip for ICU days [**2-27**]. She continued to be
Lasix dependent. She was started on erythromycin and reglan ICU
day 4. Her tube feeds were advanced when appropriate, which was
tolerated well. She was on Isosource 1.5 at a low rate to meet
caloric goals but was switched to Replete prior to discharge to
increase her free water intake. We feel volume depletion and
traumatic injury explain her gentle rise in creatinine the past
few days. The additional free water from the Replete tube feeds
should be helpful in reversing that trend. She was started on a
bowel regimen to encourage bowel movement. Foley was left in
place. Intake and output were closely monitored.

ID: Given concern for pneumonia on CT chest, she was started on
Vanc/Cefepime ICU day 3. After BAL and cultures were all
negative, her antibiotics were DC'd on day 6. A PICC was placed
[**2182-6-2**].

Prophylaxis: She received subcutaneous heparin during this stay.
