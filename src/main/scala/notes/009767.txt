ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with daughter and wife.
[**Name (NI) **] a good social support network.  He is employed and
completes all his activities of daily living and IADLs on his
own.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  97.5, 84, 111/83, 15,
and 97% on 2 liters.  The patient is an elderly man who is
very pleasant and conversational.  He appears to be in no
acute distress.  He has a regular, rate, and rhythm, lungs
are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen is soft and
nontender, and mildly distended.  Patient has a right
inguinal hernia that is likely recurrence of prior surgery.
Extremities are without edema.  His rectal was guaiac
negative with good tone.  Patient has multiple scars on his
abdomen from prior surgeries including bilateral inguinal
hernia repairs and prostatectomy.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White count 8.7, differential 85
neutrophils, 7 lymphocytes, hematocrit 41.7, platelets 377.
Sodium 144, potassium 3.9, chloride 104, bicarb 28, BUN 30,
creatinine 1.7, glucose 141, calcium is 9.8, magnesium 2.2,
phosphate 5.3, PT 15.8, PTT 25, INR 1.6.

STUDIES ON ADMISSION:  CT scan of the abdomen revealed
multiple dilated loops of small bowel with no definite
transition point identified.  There is a segment of
decompressed ileum in the colon is decompressed.  This is
suggestive of transition within the distal ileum.

CHEST X-RAY ON ADMISSION:  Small left pneumothorax.  Right
pleural effusion following left
central line placement.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Significant for right bundle branch block
(longstanding).

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given patient's significant history of
congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of less than
15%, the patient was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care
Unit for central line placement, hydration, and fresh-frozen
plasma to correct INR preoperatively.  Patient was seen by
Heart Failure Team, and felt to be without contraindication
from cardiac standpoint.  Swan-Ganz catheter was recommended
by the service and was placed in Surgical Intensive Care Unit
prior to operation.

On hospital day #2, the patient was taken to the operating
room for exploratory laparotomy.  Findings intraoperatively
revealed multiple adhesions that were likely causing small
bowel obstruction.  The patient underwent lysis of adhesions
without complication.  Blood loss was minimal.  For specifics
of surgery, please see operative note.

The patient returned to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit
following his surgery for postoperative management.

Management was as follows:
1. Neurologic:  The patient was treated with Dilaudid PCA.
Patient was transferred to floor and tolerating po.  He was
switched to Percocet which controlled his pain adequately.

2. Cardiovascular system:  In the immediate postoperative
period, the patient required dobutamine to maintain adequate
blood pressures.  This was discontinued on postoperative day
#3.  Patient's blood pressures were maintained in the
120s/70s range.  The patient was also treated with Vasotec
and Lasix drip during the first four days postoperatively.
The patient was transitioned to outpatient medication during
the course of his SICU management.

Patient with a history of atrial fibrillation and
significantly depressed ejection fraction was maintained on
amiodarone drip during the course of his SICU admission.  On
postoperative day #8, patient was transitioned to po
amiodarone without any changes on Telemetry.

3. Respiratory:  The patient was intubated in the immediate
postoperative period.  He was extubated on postoperative day
#1.  By the time of discharge, the patient was breathing
normally on room air without shortness of breath.

4. Gastrointestinal:  Patient's initial symptoms of
significant nausea and vomiting resolved following surgery.
He began to have flatus and bowel movements on postoperative
day #6 and was advanced slowly to a regular diet by the time
of discharge.  Patient was treated with prophylactic Protonix
during the course of his admission.

5. Infectious Disease:  The patient received perioperatively,
Levaquin and metronidazole for prophylaxis.

6. Anticoagulation:  Patient was initially anticoagulated
with Heparin drip postoperatively.  Once he was tolerating
po, he was started on Coumadin on postoperative day #7.  His
INR was therapeutic at 2.4 at the time of discharge.  He will
follow up with his primary care physician for further
management of therapeutic Coumadin levels.

7. Functional ability:  The patient was followed by physical
therapy during admission.  After multiple visits,
recommendation was for discharge to home.  Patient was felt
to be at a high functional level especially considering his
significant cardiac disease.

FOLLOWUP:  The patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**12-11**]
weeks.  Patient will follow up with primary care physician
for management of Coumadin.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Glyburide 2.5 mg q day.

10. Imdur continue to hold.
11. Percocet prn.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Small bowel obstruction status post exploratory laparotomy
and lysis of adhesions.
2. Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of less
than 15%.
3. Atrial fibrillation status post ablation controlled on
amiodarone.
4. Diabetes mellitus type 2 well controlled with Glyburide.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.  The patient will be
discharged to home with followup as described above.
