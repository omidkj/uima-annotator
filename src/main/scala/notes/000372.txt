RENAL U.S.  [**2147-4-20**] 4:08 PM
RENAL ULTRASOUND: Study is limited due to patient cooperativity.
No gross abnormality seen in the right renal bed. The left
kidney measures 9.7 cm. There is no hydronephrosis. There is a
small cyst in the mid-to-lower pole measuring up to 14 mm. There
is no overt solid mass. Probable extrarenal pelvis. No
hydronephrosis.
.
CHEST PORTABLE [**2147-4-17**] 2:02 AM
FINDINGS: Placement of right internal jugular venous catheter is
identified in the expected region of the mid SVC. No pleural
effusion or pneumothorax identified. Again noted is airspace
opacity within the right lower lobe.

IMPRESSION:
1. Normal placement of right internal jugular venous catheter
without pneumothorax identified.
2. Right lower lobe pneumonia as described previously.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old man with history of dementia, cad,
diabetes mellitus, chronic renal insufficiency who presented
with mental status change, work up remarkable for HONK,
hypernatremia, pneumonia, UTI.

1)Mental Status change:
Multifactorial in secondary to hyperglycemia, hypernatremia,
pneumonia, metabolic derangements. The patient's mental status
returned to baseline once metabolic derangements and infections
were treated.

2)Endocrine:
The patient has an unclear history of DM, but not presently on
medications. Hyperosmolar state (HONK) likely precipitated by
pneumonia/UTI. He was given aggressive fluids with NS initially,
then changed to D5W since hypernatremia was not improving.
Briefly required an Insulin drip, added D5 when sugar <200,
converted to long-acting insulin on [**4-17**]. He was tapered to
standing NPH insulin, then later became hypoglycemic with
treatment of his infection. He was discharged on Humalog sliding
scale. Treatment with an oral antidiabetic [**Doctor Last Name 360**] should be
considered as an outpatient as Pt's Hgb A1C was 7.5 on
admission.

4)Acute on Chronic Renal Failure:
Pt is s/p L nephrectomy. Likely secondary to ATN in setting of
hypotension, hypovolemia. Pt's baseline Creatinine is 1.9
according to PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] improved from 3.8 to 3.0 with IV
fluids, but was in plateau phase for several days. Renal service
was consulted, renal ultrasound did not reveal hydroureter.
Gentle intravenous fluids continued to improved pt's Cr
clearance leading up until discharge. His medications were
renally dosed.

5) Heme:
Anemia consistent with AKD in combination with chronic kidney
disease. Guaiac negative. Renal recommended starting EPO q
M,W,F. Hematocrit was stable on serial checks.

6) Infectious Disease:
a) Pneumonia: required ICU admission
--vancomycin, ceftriaxone, levoquin initially - was changed to
vanc/zosyn on [**4-17**] for a health care associated pneumonia. He
should complete a full 14 day course of Vancomycin as his sputum
grew MRSA.
b) UTI--grew cipro and bactrim resistant E. Coli- 14 day course
of ceftriaxone for complicated UTI
c) [**Name (NI) 1069**] Pt developed copius diarrhea on HD #4, was started
on empiric Flagyl PO, C. diff x 2 negative. His stools
normalized following initiation of treatment. He should complete
a 14 day course following the last day of Vancomycin and
Ceftriaxone.

7) Suprapubic Catheter:
Pt was noted to have copious urine drainage from around his
suprapubic catheter, without evidence for skin infection.
Urology was consulted and recommended Tolteridine 1mg [**Hospital1 **] for
potential bladder spasm. He has a 24 Fr foley. There is no
further role for intervention except for continued monitoring to
assure his catheter flushed, dressed properly for good position
within the bladder.

8) Speech and Swallowing evaluation:
Recommended PO diet of soft solids with thin liquids, pills
crushed as allowable.
Aspiration precautions with 1:1 assist at meals.

Code Status: DNR/DNI per discussion with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 284**]
