History of Present Illness:
60 year old female with a history of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation first diagnosed 15 years ago. She was started on
inderal and digitalis and has been well for several years. Her
atrial fibrillation returned in [**2194**] and has been paroxysmal
since this time despite medical therapy. She is quite
symptomatic
with her atrial fibrillation and experiences bothersome
paplitations and lightheadedness. She also claims she feels
fatigued all the time possibly related to all the medications
she
takes however it is difficult to distinguish whether this is
caused by her antiarrythmics or her neuropsychiatric
medications.
Given that she is quite symptomatic of her atrial fibrillation,
she has been referred for mini MAZE.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   60 year old woman with removal of left chest tube
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   eval for PTX



Wet Read: YGd SUN [**2196-8-7**] 12:27 AM
Also note anterior chest wall subcutaneous emphysema, likely
postoperative
change. [**Doctor Last Name **] x pg [**Numeric Identifier 27921**]
Wet Read Audit # 1 YGd SUN [**2196-8-7**] 12:14 AM
Status post L chest tube removal without ptx. R IJ central
venous catheter
tip in distla SVC. Bilateral peripheral reticular opacities over
mid lungs
could represent evolving infection. Alternatively interstitial
edema is a
consideration. Small effusions may be present. cardiomediastinal
silhouette
is within normal limits. old rib fracture on the right. [**Doctor Last Name **] x pg
[**Numeric Identifier 27921**]


Final Report
PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST

REASON FOR EXAM: Chest tube removal. Assess for pneumothorax.

Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.

There is no pneumothorax. Right IJ catheter tip is in the mid to
distal SVC.
Cardiac size is top normal. Small bilateral pleural effusions
are associated
with bibasilar atelectasis enlarging from prior study.
Interstitial
abnormality and haziness of the vessels due to mild new
interstitial edema.
There is an old right rib fracture. There is subcutaneous
emphysema better
seen in the lateral view in the anterior chest wall.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**8-3**] for IV heparin and pre-op workup. Underwent
surgery with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] on [**8-4**] for a bilateral
mini-thorocotomy/MAZE/Left Atrial Appendage resection/and flx
bronchoscopy. Please refer to Dr[**Last Name (STitle) 5305**] operative report for
further details.  Transferred to the CVICU in stable condition.
She awoke neurologically intact but was kept intubated due to
airway edema and  difficult airway placement. POD#1 she was
extubated without incident, weaned off all drips and her
preoperative psych and antiarrhythmics were resumed.
Aspirin/Beta-blocker/diuresis and Statin was initiated. She
remained on the preopertive antibiotics initiated for urinary
tract infection.POD#2 she was transferred to the step down unit
for further monitoring. Chest tubes remained in until drainage
criteria was met. Indomethicin and Colchicine were initiated per
Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 914**] x 1 month. No anticoagulation per Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 914**].
Physical Therapy was consulted for strength and mobility
evaluation. POD#4 Pulmonary performed a bronchoscopy that
revealed no tracheal stenosis; however, she does have left vocal
cord paralysis and some subglottic granulation tissue. She was
referred for discharge to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab in [**Location (un) 2312**] for <30 day
recovery anticipated. POD#5 Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 914**] cleared her for
discharge. All follow up appointments were advised.
