Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2972**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain & shortness of breath


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with Drug eluting stents x2 to ostial
and mid RCA.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 70 year old man with a complicated history
including CAD s/p CABG in [**2130**], PVD, systolic CHF (EF 45-50% in
[**11-15**]) w/ diastolic dysfunction, severe COPD, severe AS (0.8cm2)
& AI who presents as a transfer from [**Hospital6 **] for
respiratory failure. Mr. [**Known lastname **] has been hospitalized multiple
times in the last several months for respiratory failure and has
been intubated 3 times over the past 3 months most recently in
early [**Month (only) 404**] at [**Hospital1 34**]. Following his most recent discharge, he
was seen by his PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) 216**] on [**2141-12-13**] for persistent upper
respiratory symptoms and placed on a Z-pack. His symptoms
improved, but the patient's wife called the patient's PCP 3 days
prior to this admission stating that the patient had developed
worsening cough productive of thick yellow-green sputum and
worsening shortness of breath on his home 2L O2, as well as
chest tightness that resolved after SL NTG x 2. At that time,
his wife reported that he had no chest pain, nausea, sweating,
[**Date Range **], chills, vomiting or dizziness and he was directed to
[**Hospital6 33**] for further evaluation.
.
For unclear reasons, he did not seek care until the day prior to
admission when his breathing and chest pain symptoms worsened.
He was taken to [**Hospital6 33**] by ambulance and found to
be non-verbal in the ED. CXR was negative and pBNP was 3969. He
was initially treated for presumed systolic CHF exacerbation and
COPD with CPAP, IV Solumedrol, nebulizers, Lasix, and Nitrates.
He was also given a dose of IV Levaquin out of concern for
infection but his respiratory rate declined and his ABG's
demonstrated severe respiratory acidosis so he was intubated in
the [**Hospital3 **] ED. In the ICU, EKG's demonstrated sinus
tachycardia with left anterior fascicular block and ST
depressions in II, V3, V4. CE's rose with CK's peaking at 229
and Troponin levels peaking at 0.45. He was placed on a Heparin
gtt, ASA, beta-blocker, and a statin. The following morning, his
respiratory status improved and he was extubated and placed on
BIPAP before being transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] at family request.
.
On arrival to the CCU, the patient was noted to be on BIPAP, but
not in respiratory distress. He was able to speak with the
health care team, but demonstrated a visible left hand tremor
and was relative immobile.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2141-11-27**]: OSH, EF 45-50%, with aortic valve
area of 0.8cm2 and [**1-10**]+ aortic insufficiency.
.
[**10/2141**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
45-50%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 0.8cm2). An eccentric jet of mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets and
supporting structures are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Severe aortic valve stenosis. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with mild global hypokinesis. Mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild aortic
regurgitation.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2136-5-18**], the severity of aortic stenosis has
progressed, mild aortic regurgitation is now seen, left
ventricular systolic function is less vigorous, and the
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is higher.

CT Abd/pelvis Noncon [**12-31**]
CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Lung bases are clear without
consolidation or pleural effusion. The heart size is normal
without pericardial effusion.  Dense calcification of the
coronary arteries is noted.

In the abdomen, assessment of solid organs is limited in the
absence of IV
contrast. However, the liver is grossly unremarkable. A focal
hypodensity
anteriorly is unchanged and likely represents focal fatty
infiltration. A
small gallstone is present in a decompressed gallbladder. The
pancreas,
spleen, adrenal glands and kidneys are grossly unremarkable
