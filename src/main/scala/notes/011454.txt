History of Present Illness:
This 75 year old lady with remarkable past medical history with
stage III lung cancer, treated about 7 years ago with
chemo/radio therapy, managed to survive without recurrence of
the cancer on recent extensive investigations when she presented
with aortic stenosis.  Her investigation included angiogram and
echo
which basically showed severe aortic stenosis with calcified
tricuspid aortic valve and significant disease in the right
coronary artery and also a patent foramen ovale and mild mitral
regurgitation.

Her past medical history as mentioned above includes the lung
cancer, stage III, with also subsequent right sided pleural
effusion as well as pericardial effusion for which she had
pericardiocentesis in the past.  She thoroughly investigated
with PET scan, etc to rule out possibility of any secondaries
which were all negative.  After full discussion, she wanted to
go ahead with the surgery.  She was electively admitted for
aortic valve replacement, coronary artery bypass graft, and
patent foramen ovale closure.

CXR [**2117-8-16**]
1. Findings consistent with cardiomegaly and interstitial
pulmonary edema.

2. Nodular densities within the right upper lobe and volume loss
in the right upper lobe. Although these findings could be due to
prior granulomatous disease, further evaluation is necessary.
Recommend comparison with prior studies. If no prior studies are
available, non-contrast CT of the chest is recommended.

3. Two compression fractures of the thoracic vertebral bodies.
The acuity of these fractures cannot be determined. Clinical
correlation recommended.

[**2117-8-31**] CXR
Comparison with [**2117-8-30**]. In the interval, the Dobhoff tube
has been removed. There is a large amount of air underneath the
diaphragms; a PEG tube appears to be in place in the left upper
quadrant. The appearance of the lungs is not significantly
changed. A right-sided dual lead pacemaker, midline sternotomy
wires, staples overlying the heart, a tracheostomy tube, a right
internal jugular catheter, are all in place. Surrounding osseous
structures are unchanged. Findings were discussed with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Doctor Last Name **] at approximately 7:30 p.m., [**2117-8-31**]

1. Small areas of hypodensity within the left frontal lobe and
right frontoparietal region, as well as within the subcortical
white matter and corona radiata bilaterally. These findings are
of uncertain significance. No evidence of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
differentiation to suggest a large minor or major vascular
territorial infarct is identified, although MR is a more
sensitive evaluation for evaluation for acute infarct. The
abnormalities described may be further evaluated with MR.
2. Mild fluid opacification of the mastoid air cells and mucosal
thickening within the sinuses.

[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4125**]ospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2117-8-17**] and taken
directly to the operating room where she underwent an aortic
valve replacement and an atrial septal defect closure.
Postoperatively she was taken to the surgical intensive care
unit for monitoring. She was noted to have severe facial and
neck edema for which diuresis was initiated. Her permenant
pacemaker was interoggated by the electrophysiology service and
reprogrammed. An underlying atrial fibrillation was noted. A
heparin induced thrombocytopenia was sent for thrombocytopenia
which was negative. On [**2117-8-22**], Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was extubated however
promptly developed respiratory distress requiring reintubation.
The neurology service was consulted for anisocoria. A head CT
scan was obtained which showed small areas of hypodensity within
the left frontal lobe and right frontoparietal region, as well
as within the subcortical white matter and corona radiata
bilaterally. Her anisocoria subsequently resolved. Given her
decreased level of consciouseness, the stroke service felt that
she liklely experienced a cerebrovascular accident and coumadin
should be started when it was safe. The thoracic surgery service
was consulted for a tracheostomy. It was decided that she was
indeed a candidate for a tracheostomy however given her history
of radiation, an open procedure may be best. While changing a
central line, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] became hypotensive which responded to
resuscitation. The electrophysiology service was asked to
evaluate her pacemaker which was found to be functioning within
normal limits. Slight changes were made to her sensing. Rate
control of her atrial fibrillation was recommended. The physical
therapy worked with Mrs. [**Known lastname **] daily. On [**2117-8-25**], the thoracic
surgery service performed a tracheostomy without complication. A
bronchoscopy was later performed which did not reveal
significant secretions. The ventilator was slowly weaned to
CPAP. The speech and swallow service was consulted. As she had
not tolerated a passe muir valve, a bedside swallowing
evaluation was defferred and a PEG feeding tube was recommended.
A PEG was placed on [**2117-8-31**] for long term nutrition needs. Mrs.
[**Known lastname **] continued to experience episodes of hypotension which
responded to pressors. Most of her episodes seemed to be related
to atrial fibrillation which was aggressively controlled with
amiodarone. As she was subtherapeutic on coumadin, heparin was
started as a bridge. Her neurologic status improved and she was
able to move all extremities to commmand. She began to tolerate
her tube feeds and continued to improve over the next several
days
