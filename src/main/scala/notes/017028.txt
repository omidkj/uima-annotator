Brief Hospital Course:
After being seen by the surgery team, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to
Dr.[**Name (NI) 3377**] surgical service.  Given his heart history,
Cardiology was consulted for pre-operative clearance.  He was
marked as minimal-moderate risk and was started on his home dose
of beta-blocker and ACEI.  His EKG appeared NSR at 80 with poor
r-wave progression. Reviewing his colonoscopy, it appeared that
the mass was circumferential at the hepatic flexure, however was
not completely obstructing.  This was evident by the fact that
the patient continued to tolerate PO and was still passing
gas/bowel movements.

On [**11-4**], the patient underwent a lap right colectomy.
Intubation proved difficult for this patient and anethesia had
to intubate with a scope.  Operatively the case was
uncomplicated.  EBL was minimal.  Vital signs were stable
throughout the case.  However after the operation was complete,
the patient was extubated and soon began to drop his oxygen
saturations.  He was then immediately reintubated, again with
difficulty.  A gas and CXR obtained suggested acidosis and
pulmonary edema.  Cardiac enzymes was negative X 3.  EKG had no
changes as compared to his pre-op EKG.  Cardiology was consulted
and suggested that the patient went into flash pulmonary edema
secondary to valsalva given the difficult intubations.  He was
admitted to the ICU, sedated with propofol and intubated.  His
fluids were KVO and Lasix IV was given to diuresis him back to
his preop weight.  The patient appeared to respond to this
treatment and had his vent settings changed to pressure support
[**4-11**] with his saturations high 90's/100's.  However, overnight
the patient became hypotensive to the 70's.  His UOP was still
excellent and repeat CXR suggested that although he still had
fluid in his lungs, this was significantly improved from his
prior CXR before lasix.  His Hct was stable.  He was given a 500
cc LR bolus which resulted in his BP normalizing.  He was then
started on LR at 80 cc/hr.  He was put on CPAP to rest him
overnight.

On [**11-5**], the patient's RISBI was 30-40 and his CXR showed
improvement.  He was extubated successfully and maintained his
saturations high 90's on face mask, which was then weaned to
nasal canula.  He was deemed hemodynamically stable and was
transferred from the ICU to the floor.

On the floor, the patient did well post-operatively.  His Foley
was D/Ced and he voided without difficulties.  He passed gas on
POD 3 and his diet was advanced from sips to fulls.  He did not
complain of n/v.  He was started on his home meds.  His pain was
controlled on PO meds.  His [**Doctor Last Name **] pump was D/Ced on POD3.  His
IVF were stopped as he was tolerating adequate PO.  PT saw him
on POD3 and suggested his dispo be to a [**Hospital1 1501**].

On the day of discharge, the patient is Afebrile and his vital
signs are stable.  He is tolerating a regular diet.  He is
passing gas.  He is urinating.  His pain is controlled on PO
pain meds. He continues with a bowel regimen: colace & senna
until normal bowel movement function resumes.
