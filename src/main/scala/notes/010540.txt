Service:  CARD [**Doctor First Name 147**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 26909**] is a 51 year old
male with a history of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and end-stage renal
disease who, during work-up for renal transplant, was found
to have evidence of possible coronary artery disease after
which he subsequently underwent cardiac catheterization which
confirmed the presence of three vessel disease, including
total proximal occlusion of the left anterior descending with
no stump.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] agreed to perform complete
revascularization with the left internal mammary artery to
left anterior descending as the preferred method.

LABORATORY:  The patient's initial labs showed a hematocrit
of 31.8 with platelet count of 266.  His BUN and creatinine
were 126 and 9.6 respectively.

At the time of discharge, the patient's hematocrit was 30
with a platelet count of 225 and his BUN and creatinine were
66 and 7.1 at time of discharge.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was dialyzed for a few days
preoperatively in order to optimize his preoperative
condition.  Subsequent to his hemodialysis he underwent a
three vessel coronary artery bypass graft on [**2104-7-17**],
with left internal mammary artery to left anterior
descending, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal;
saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery, under general
endotracheal anesthesia.  The pericardium was partially
reapproximated.  He did have radial arterial lines placed and
a left IJ Swan-Ganz and two ventricular and atrial pacer
wires were used.  He was on coronary bypass for 64 minutes
and crossclamp time was 51 minutes.  Subsequent to the
procedure, he did have two mediastinal and one pleural tube.

On transfer to the Recovery Room, his mean arterial pressure
was 65 with a CVP of 11, a PAD of 12 and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1052**] of 15, and
with an arterial based rhythm of 88 and the only drips he was
on were Neo-Synephrine and Propofol which we planned to
titrate down.

He did well postoperatively and on postoperative day one, he
was started on Lopressor and Lasix.  He was weaned to
extubation and started on a heart diet.  Otherwise, there
were no issues other than the continued hemodialysis.

On postoperative day two, he was weaned off pressors.  He was
transferred to the floor on postoperative day five, at which
time, he underwent Physical Therapy and was able to
accomplish his goals of reaching Level 5 quickly.
Hemodialysis Service was arranged for him at his home near
[**Hospital3 **] and Discharge Planning was initiated.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:   He was discharged in good
condition, able to ambulate with minimal incisional pain and
otherwise no respiratory distress.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass grafting.
2.  End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
3.  Congestive heart failure.
4.  Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
5.  History of restless leg syndrome.
6.  Hypertension.

1.  Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day.
2.  Ranitidine 150 mg p.o. twice a day.
3.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day.
4.  Percocet 5/325 mg, take one to two tablets p.o. q. four
to six hours as needed.
5.  Ibuprofen 400 mg; take one tablet every six hours as
needed.
6.  Lopressor, take 12.5 mg p.o. twice a day.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
