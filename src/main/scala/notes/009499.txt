Allergies:
Codeine / OxyContin

Attending:[**Last Name (un) 7835**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
pericardiocentesis [**2112-4-3**]

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 77320**] is a 71 year old  transferred from OSH w/pericardial
effusion found on CT which was associated with early tamponade
physiology and pleural effusions. She presented to [**Hospital 1562**]
hospital this afternoon for increasing dyspnea and nausea x 1
week. Additionally, she noted ankle edema, and continued chest
pain. Ms. [**Known lastname 77320**] had presented for chest pain to [**Hospital1 1562**]
approximately 1 week ago where she ruled out for an MI and was
discharged home with GERD treatment. Upon presentation to the
OSH today, she was found on CT to have a large pericardial
effusion with pleural effusion as well as axillary
lymphadenopathy. Cardiology saw her at the OSH and recommened
transfer for possible pericardial window.
    Seen by cards at OSH and sent for poss pericardial window.
h/o breast CA s/p bilat mastectomy, per report adenopathy on CT
scan.

Diagnosis: pericardial effusion

ED Course (labs, imaging, interventions, consults): Upon arrival
in the ED from [**Hospital 1562**] hospital, initially pt was tachy to 150,
RR 23, BP 132/56, 97% on 4L NC (92% on 2L on admission) with a
pulsus of 20mmHg. EKG was obtained which demonstrated sinus
tachycardia. Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery were consulted.
Cardiac surgery recommended window in the morning. Bedside echo
demonstrated RA and RV collapse. Cardiology took Ms. [**Known lastname 77320**] for
an urgent pericardiocentesis.
.
In pericardiocentesis, the RV was initially sampled and
following this Ms. [**Known lastname 77320**] was hypotensive to SBPs in the 50s.
Levophed was initiated, the pericardial effusion was drained for
500cc of a bloody effusion.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers or rigors but
espouses chills. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All
of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope.

Past Medical History:
1. CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: Diabetes - , Dyslipidemia - ,
Hypertension -
2. OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Bilateral stage I lobular carcinoma (see below)
goiter, which is being followed
Basal cell cancer ten years ago
.
PSH:
Tonsillectomy at age 14 and a cholecystectomy at age 25, rotator
cuff surgery at 64 and knee surgery at age 55.
.
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
1.  [**5-/2108**]:  Multiple suspicious areas on breast MRI.
Bilateral
breast biopsy demonstrated invasive lobular carcinoma.
2.  [**6-/2108**]:  Underwent bilateral mastectomy for what appeared
to
be multifocal disease in both breasts and had negative sentinel
lymph node biopsy.  The right breast had a lesion staged as T1b
and was grade II, ER positive, PR negative, HER-2 negative,
grade
II.  The left breast lesion was T1C M0, ER/PR positive,
HER-2/neu
negative without lymphovascular invasion and grade II. BRCA [**2-15**]
testing negative.
3.  [**7-/2108**]:  Oncotype DX assay revealed a recurrence score of
21, which was in the intermediate risk group.  The patient
declined enrollment in the TAILORx trial because she did not
want
chemotherapy.  Started on Arimidex.  The last bone mineral
density scan in [**7-/2108**] revealed osteopenia at the left femoral
neck

pack year smoking history.

metastatic disease at age 60.  She has a sister who was
diagnosed
with breast cancer at age 49 and died at age 51 from metastatic
disease. She has another sister recently diagnosed with breast
cancer in [**2109**]. Genetic testing for BRCA 1 or 2 mutations was
performed and was negative.

REPORTS

CT TORSO [**2112-4-7**] 11:29 AM
1. Extensive mediastinal, supraclavicular and hilar
lymphadenopathy with mass effect on to the adjacent veins, but
without occlusion.
2. Interval decrease of pericardial effusion, in keeping with
the recent
pericardial drainage.
3. Interval increase of loculated pleural effusions, left
greater than right. New subtotal collapse of the left lower
lobe. Reticulonodular opacities in the lower lobes raise concern
for lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
4. Heterogeneously enhancing right thyroid nodule, concerning
for metastasis.
5. No definite evidence of intra-abdominal or intra-pelvic
metastatic
disease. Likely geographic hepatosteatosis.

PERICARDIAL FLUID Procedure Date of [**2112-4-4**]

  POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS,
  consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma (see note).

  Note: The current specimen shows similar findings to the
  prior pericardial fluid specimen (C12-5973S, [**2112-4-3**]), which
  was reviewed for comparison.


[**2112-4-4**]       Tissue: pericardium.   [**2112-4-5**] [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] C.

Pericardial fluid, cell block:

Positive for Malignant Cells.

Consistent with metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma.

Note: The tumor cells are immunoreactive for CK7, B72.3, [**Last Name (un) **]-31,
and focally positive for mammoglobin.  They are negative for
CK20, CEA, Leu-M1 (background staining of neutrophils and
macrophages), GCDFP, ER, PR, Calretinin, and WT-1.  Mucicarmine
staining is negative.  These findings support metastasis from
breast origin.  See cytology (C12-5973).

CXR AP [**2112-4-11**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Placement of a right Pleurx catheter with interval decrease
in size of a large right pleural effusion. Tiny right basilar
pneumothorax.
2. Unchanged appearance of left retrocardiac opacity, which may
represent
severe atelectasis or consolidation.
3. Unchanged small left pleural effusion

ECHO [**2112-4-4**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are nor
