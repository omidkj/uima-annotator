Mr [**Known lastname 69602**] is a 52 year old man with pulmonary hypertension
detected approximately six months ago by echo, afib, PAD, COPD
(2L of home O2), chronic edema and anasarca and DM2 who
presented to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] after a fall. He reports that he had
difficulty getting up after his fall. During his admission at
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] his weight was found to be over 400 pounds. He was
found to be volume overloaded and they began diuresis. He was
noted to be dropping his O2 sats to the mid 70??????s with exertion
on oxygen. He is usually on 3L home oxygen.

On review of systems, he denies history deep venous thrombosis,
pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias,
joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He
denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

Other Studies:
#) CXR ([**2162-6-1**]):
IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
radiographs:
Lower aspect of the chest is excluded from the examination.
Cardiac
enlargement is severe and pulmonary vasculature both
peripherally and in the hila is engorged. Opacification
blanketing the right lower chest is probably effusion.
Borderline pulmonary edema is present. Consolidation
particularly in the lower chest and right apex medially is
suspected.
.
#) CXR ([**2162-6-24**]):
IMPRESSION: Left-sided PICC line terminating in similar position
as before. Marked regression of pulmonary vascular distention
related to successful dehydration. No new infiltrates or
pneumothorax.
.
#) Abd U/S ([**2162-6-20**]):
Limited ultrasound of the abdomen demonstrates a moderate amount
of ascites, predominantly within the lower quadrants. A right
pleural effusion is seen.
.
#) CT Neck/Lungs with and without Contrast ([**2162-6-27**])
FINDINGS:
There is a tunneled left-sided central venous line with the tip
terminating at the proximal SVC.

The arch vessel origin is normal. There are no abnormally
enlarged superior mediastinal nodes.

A tiny wall calcification is in the aortic arch and both
cervical carotid
bifurcations and cavernous carotid segments.

HEAD:
There is no significant cervical or intracranial stenosis,
aneurysm, or
occlusion.

NECK:
There is no significant cervical or intracranial stenosis,
aneurysm, or
occlusion.

Note is made of a left maxillary sinus mucous retention cyst.
There are no
abnormally enlarged cervical nodes. The left aryepiglottic fold
is mildly
thickened compared to the right and the left piriform fossa is
partially
effaced. There is enlargement of the left laryngeal ventricle,
and mild
thickening of the left aryepiglotic fold, consistent with left
vocal cord
paralysis.

IMPRESSION:
Partially effaced left piriform sinus and mild asymmetric
thickening of left aryepiglottic fold. No compressive lesion of
the recurrent laryngeal nerve is demonstrated on the current
study.

Conclusions
The left atrium is markedly dilated. A color Doppler jet of
left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at
rest c/w a small secundum atrial septal defect. Premature
appearance of echo contrast is seen in the left atrium
post-cough and Valsalva release. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. An eccentric,
inferolaterally directed jet of mild to moderate ([**12-5**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid regurgitation jet is
eccentric and may be underestimated. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a atrivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and
regional biventricular systolic function. Small secundum atrial
septal defect. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.

#) Cardiac Cath ([**2162-6-30**]) - Preliminary Report:

COMMENTS:
1. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left heart
filling
pressures with RVEDP 15 mmHg and PCWP 19 mmHg. There was
moderate
pulmonary arterial hypertension with PASP 55 mmHg. The cardiac
index was
preserved at 3.1 L/min/m2. The pulmonary vascular resistance was

elevated at 200 dyn-sec/cm5.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Mildly elevated biventricular filling pressures.
2. Moderate pulmonary a
