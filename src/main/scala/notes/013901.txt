Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
Positional occipital headache and dizziness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 84y/o F with PMH of atrial fibrillation on
coumadin, polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **], diastolic heart failure presenting
to ED with worsening positional occipital headache and dizziness
since last evening.

The patient reports intermittent headache since her discharge
from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**7-15**] from CHF exacerbation. Since discharge she
reports daily occipital headaches exacerbated with changes in
position. Reports pain as [**4-17**] and non-radiating. Last pm her
pain worsened in severity prompting her to call EMS. Pain not
relieved with tylenol. Associated symptoms includes dizziness
decribing a "spinning sensation in her head". No other
associated symptoms including N/V, vision changes, hearing
changes, photophobia, neck pain or LOC. Denies presyncopal
symptoms. In ED she also reported "veering to the left" with
ambulation.
.
Recently hospitalized in [**7-15**] with exacerbation of CHF due to
medication noncompliance. Pt. on amiodarone with slow HR and
first degree AV block. In outpatient cardiology appoint. pt.
reported occassional lightheadedness and dizziness that does not
appear to be positional. Physical activity minimal due to fear
to leave her home since her hospitalization. Pt. losing 1lb/day
since discharge. Wt. in clinic 163lb. Continued on lasix 40mg
daily, valsartan and amiodarone.
.
In ED orthostatics negative. FS 115. Vitals T97, HR 59, BP
160/82, RR 15, O2 Sat 97% RA. CT Head performed negative. Pt.
seen by neurology, exam notable for positional vertigo and
intention tremor L>R. Head CT negative for obvious mass. Given
positional nature of patient's symptoms and daily episodes since
[**Month (only) 216**], unlikely TIA or stroke.
.
On floor, Pt. complains that her head is "unclear". She reports
feeling tired and weak since her discharge from [**Hospital 100**] rehab.
She states she feels that she "veers" to the left due to
"breakage and pain" in her L foot. She denies palpitations,
shortness of breath and increased edema at home. No recent
medication changes.

Reports:
CXR [**9-17**] - Bedside AP and lateral views labeled "upright" with
lordotic positioning, are compared with most recent studies
dated [**7-27**] and [**2132-5-8**]. Allowing for technical differences, the
overall appearance is not much changed. There is moderate
cardiomegaly with left ventricular configuration, but no
pulmonary vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or other
evidence of CHF. There is linear scarring involving the left mid
lung, and minor atelectasis involving that lung base, but no
focal consolidation is seen. There are atherosclerotic changes
involving the thoracic aorta, without focal aneurysmal
dilatation. There is diffuse osteopenia with anterior wedging of
mid thoracic vertebrae and resultant kyphosis, unchanged, with
no acute thoracic compression seen.
IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly without CHF or focal consolidation
.
CT HEAD - There is no intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass
effect, or shift of normally midline structures. There is no
hydrocephalus. Density values of brain parenchyma are within
normal limits. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is
preserved.
Surrounding soft tissues and osseous structures are
unremarkable.
Mastoid air cells and the imaged paranasal sinuses are well
aerated.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or
edema. No change from [**2132-7-27**]
