Brief Hospital Course:
52 year-old male admitted on [**2150-7-4**] from trauma bay after he
was ejected from his boat.  He had been in a high-speed boating
accident.  He had been transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital, where
a chest tube was placed on his left side.  Patient was
hemodynamically stable, however imaging at [**Hospital1 18**] revealed that
he had left-sided displaced rib fractures and a T3 transverse
procese fracture.  He was alert and oriented and admitted to the
trauma service in the Trauma-ICU.

Upon admission to the T-SICU, the patient had an epidural placed
for pain management, and the chest tube output was observed on a
daily basis.  The patient started to shows signs of ETOH
withdrawl on [**7-6**].  On [**7-8**], the chest tube was placed to
waterseal, but the patient displayed a much-increased work of
breathing.  The chest tube output considerably dropped on this
day, while the patient's CXRs continued to worsen.  The patient
had another chestt ube placed on the left side on [**7-8**] because a
CT scan indicated worsening pleural effusion and left lung
collapse.  The old chest tube was removed because it had been
clogged.  The patient was then intubated later that same
evening.  A bronchoscopy and BAL was performed that same night.
Vanco/Zosyn were started for empiric therapy.  Cultures from the
BAL on [**7-8**] revealed the patient had developed a H flu pneumonia.
 The vanc/zosyn was d/c'd and the patient was started on
ceftriaxone and naficillin for the pneumonia and for pleural
fluid cultures growing MSSA.

The patient remained on antibiotics throughout the remainder of
his time on [**Hospital1 18**].  Despite the presence of a new chest tube,
the patient had persistent consolidation on CXR.  On [**7-13**], the
patient had a repeat CT of the chest, which showed a large
empyema of the left chest.  The patient underwent a VATS
converted to open posterolateral thoracotomy and decortication
by Thoracic Surgery on [**7-14**].  On [**7-15**], the patient underwent
placement of a PEG and tracheostomy.  A rib specimen was sent to
pathology and found to have a myeloid predominance.  Heme/onc
was consulted and felt as though this was likely a reactive
response to MSSA. If his leukocytosis does not normalize with
resolution of his infection, they recommend that the patient be
seen in the outpatient hematology clinic for further evaluation.
At that time, they would consider performing a bone marrow
biopsy for pathologic review, flow cytometry, and cytogenetic
analysis.

From [**7-15**] to [**7-20**], the patient's chest tubes were managed in the
T-SICU.  The posterior chest tube was removed on [**7-18**], and on
[**7-20**], the anterior chest tube was converted to an empyema tube.
The patient's tube feeds were at goal rate on [**7-20**], and the
patient's vent settings were at a PEEP of 5 and pressure support
of 10. The patient worked with physical therpy and occupational
therapy during his time in teh T-SICU. He was moveing all
extremities and communicating with the T-SICU staff on the day
of discharge. The plan for the antibiotics was to complete a
6-week coarse for the empyema.
