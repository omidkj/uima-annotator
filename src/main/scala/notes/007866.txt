Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]

flu like symptoms

none


History of Present Illness:
 Mr. [**Known lastname 33559**] is a 70 yo M w/ h/o BPPV, HTN who p/w 18 days of
flu-like symptoms which got better then worse over 5 days + dry
cough, intermittend abd pain, night sweats, low volume dark
urine, poor PO intake, malaise, headache, myalgias. Pt also
endorses low-grade fevers ?100.4 intermittently. CXR was ordered
on [**6-23**] by pt's PCP which showed [**Name Initial (PRE) **] retrocardiac opacity.
Apparently, the pt checked this online and self-referred to the
ED.
.
On arrival to the ED, his vitals were T 98.0 HR 146 BP 91/63 R
12 O2 sat 97% on RA. By the time he was placed in a room, his
temp had risen to 101.7. EKG initially showed SVT and he was
given 6mg adenosine and HR fell to 110s and BPs to 110/70. Then,
he reverted back to SVT. But the ED team did not feel further
dosage of adenosine was needed. He got 9L IVF in ED with minimal
UOP. A foley was then placed and his UOP was 100cc prior to
transfer. The ED team thought the pt likely to be very
dehydrated with fever and underlying PNA. CVL was placed for
better access and levophed started which is running at 0.06 at
time of transfer.
.
Prior to transfer from the ED, the pt is alert, oriented and
conversational. His vitals are notable for HR 110s-130s, BP
96/74, 28, 99% on 2L NC. D-dimer was elevated in the ED and CTA
chest was considered but not done due to concern over low UOP.
Thus, CT abd was done on route to the ICU. Of note, pt also
recieved levofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and tylenol in the ED.
.
On arrival to the ICU, pt c/o diaphoresis and mild abd pain but
otherwise states he is feeling much better


Past Medical History:
Hypertension
BPPV- symptoms at present are different.


Social History:

(followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 18**]), pt owns his own law firm

Family History:
Father- died of COPD, ETOH abuse
Mother- alive in good health at age [**Age over 90 **]
Sister- d. suicide. had schizophrenia
Sister- alive and well

Pertinent Results:
CXR PA/LAT: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2150-9-18**],
there is continued atelectasis or scarring at the left base with
low lung volumes. On the lateral view, there is some suggestion
of increased opacification just behind the cardiac silhouette.
This is not confirmed on the frontal projection. However, in
view of the clinical symptoms, this could represent a focus of
pneumonia. No vascular congestion or pleural effusion. Remainder
of the lungs is clear.
.
EKG: multiple EKGs came with pt from ED all taked btwn 8p and 9p
at rates 130-150s and all with what looks like accelerated
junctional rhythm. left axis deviation, nl QRS. J point
elecation in V3,4. TWI in V1. No ST changes. Poor R wave
progression.
Baseline EKG from 1 yr ago NSR.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pneumonia: Admitted with left lower lobe consolidation, CAP,
treated with CTX and azithromycin.  Cultures negative to date at
time of discharge, legionella urine antigen negative.
Discharged with 7 day course of azithromycin.

Hypotension: Profound hypovolemia in setting of CAP, initially
requiring pressors following ~10 L fluid resucitation.  Cultures
negative, biomarkers negative.  Tolerating POs, blood pressure
stable at time of discharge.  In ED, with run of SVT, resolved
on arrival to floor with IVF.  As noted, biomarkers negative.
Inpatient cardiology evaluation deferred given restoration and
maintenance of sinus rhythm.  [**Month (only) 116**] benefit from outpt
holter/cardiology evaluation +/ beta blockade if tachyarrhythmia
is a recurrent issue.

Pancreatic mass: Question of pancreatic headmass on CT.  LFTs
within normal limits, pancreatic enzymes also wnl.  MRCP
performed, official read pending at time of discharge.  Pt will
follow up with his PCP to discuss results.  He may need an outpt
ERCP if findings suggest malignancy.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with a pneumonia.  Your low blood pressures
were likely from dehydration related to your pneumonia.  You
were treated with antibiotics and you improved.  As you know, an
abnormality was noted in your pancreas on your CT scan and you
had an imaging study called an MRCP, the radiology read for
which is currently pending at the time of your discharge.  As we
discussed, you will follow up with your PCP next week to discuss
these results.

Please take the antibiotic, azithromycin as directed.

Followup Instructions:
Please follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 58**] next week to follow up on
the remainder of your culture results and your MRCP results.
