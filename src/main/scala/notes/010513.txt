History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 95725**] is a 76 yo F with h/o asthma and CLL (not
currently undergoing treatment), type 1 DM (insulin pump) with
recent admission for PNA in late [**Month (only) 547**] treated with
levofloxacin, who presents to [**Hospital1 18**] with shaking chills. Today
pt notes being very cold and having shaking chills. Denies
fevers, nausea, vomiting, CP, SOB, abd pain, dysuria. States
that this feels similar to when she had her prior pneumonia.

Initial VS in the ED: 102.8 83 106/45 20 100% RA. Labs notable
for WBC 14.3 (N42.8, L55.1, no bands), platelets 102 (baseline),
lactate 1.7, creatinine 0.7. Blood cultures were obtained. CXR
showed probable mild bibasilar atelectasis. Pt was given
vancomycin 1g and levoflox 750mg and tylenol 500mg. While pt was
febrile, she had a narrow complex tachycardia (likely AFib with
RVR, rates 150s). She received 2L IVF with improvement in rates
to 100-110s. She was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for AFib with RVR in
the setting of infection with borderline blood pressures. Vitals
on transfer: 93/49, 73, 22, 100% RA 3L IVF just voided 800cc

.
In the MICU, vitals are: .
sinus 84, NA/NI, no STE

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denied cough, shortness of breath. Denied chest pain
or tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation or abdominal pain. No recent change in bowel or
bladder habits. No dysuria. Denied arthralgias or myalgias.


Past Medical History:
1. CLL/lymphoma of the eyes: diagnosed in [**2157**], self treated
cadmium and semicarbazide, with excellent baseline PS
2. Asthma
3. Hypercholesterolemia
5. Diabetes
6. Left shoulder fracture (traumatic)
7. Osteoporosis
8. right vocal fold hypomobility, resolving left vocal fold
hemorrhage, and laryngeal hyperfunction

CLL history: CLL diagnosed in [**2157**], followed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2036**] in the
past, self treated with cadmium and semicarbazide (a Russian
patented formulation studies in the 60s for multiple cancers)
for
many years at least intermittently since [**2169**] or [**2170**], last seen
by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2036**] in 1/[**2176**]. She then transferred her care to the [**Hospital1 2025**].
Previously there had been discussion of treatment of her CLL
given her diffuse LAD, but she refused.  Whether or not treated
at [**Hospital1 2025**] is unknown.  Not all of the information is available from
Dr[**Name (NI) 13339**] original assessment, which apparently stretches back
to early [**2157**], but as early as [**2162**] she had WBC 27 with marked
lymphocytic predominance.  WBC peaked at 40, and it was sometime
around [**2167**] that she began her Russian self treatment program,
which remarkably has decreased her WBC to normal with no toxic
side effects per the documentation from Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2036**].  PLT have
largely been in the range of 100-150.


Social History:
Patient is bilingual. Was a Neurologist in [**Country 532**]. Worked with a
lot of TB patients. Since she has been here she has been
retired. Married. Has 2 daughters who are both here in the US.
One is a pediatrician and one is a nurse.


Family History:
Parents are both deceased. Father (30, killed);
Mother (75, heart problems, diabetes). She has 1 brother (80 -
CABG in his 60's). She has two daugthers ages 38 and 48 (well).

IMAGING
CXR
UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac
silhouette size is top normal.  The mediastinal and hilar
contours are relatively unchanged with mild unfolding of the
thoracic aorta.  Pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  There
is crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  No overt
pulmonary edema is present.  There is minimal streaky
atelectasis at the lung bases.  No focal consolidation, pleural
effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Mild loss of height of
a mid thoracic vertebral body appears unchanged.

IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with probable mild bibasilar
atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
76 yo F history of CLL, DM1, recent pneumonia 2 months ago
(treated with ceftriaxone/azithro then switched to levo), who
presents with chills, fever, leukocytosis.

# FEVER: There was initial concern for PNA and she was started
on broad spectrum antiobiotics.  CXR was not felt to be
consistent with PNA and therefore antibiotics were discontinued
once cultures were negative x 48 hrs.  Other sources of
infection were considered including urinary source (U/A normal),
GI source (patient denied diarrhea).  Her CLL was also
considered as a possible source of fever however her smear was
not consistent with active disease.  Lyme titer was requested by
family and sent, and this was pending upon discharge to be
followed up by PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] have been viral syndrome.

#TACHYCARDIA: EKG looks like A flutter with variable conduction,
although the other 2 EKGs in NSR. Tachcyardia likely stimulated
by fever/inflammatory state.   Pt also complained of chest
pressure during this event.  Could have been experiencing some
demand ischemia through troponin was negative x 1.  TSH was
normal.

# Hypotension - likely secondary to hypovolemia.  She responded
well to bolus IV fluids.  As above it was felt that she was
unlikely to have an infection.  Blood cx showed no growth at the
time of transfer.

# THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Patient's baseline platelet count is
100-150. Differential: ITP (can be seen in CLL), viral
infection, DIC (PTT INR fine, less likely), B12/folate
deficiency, HIV. Was noticed on prior admission, plt then 65,
now 100. Smear on prior admission showed platelet clumping.
-acute thrombocytopenia likely effect of underlying inflammatory
state or viral syndrome, had returned to baseline at discharge.

# DM type I: Has insulin pump. She was continued on her home
settings.

# HTN: her home moexepril with held in the setting of
hypotension, it will be restarted upon discharge.

# Asthma: stable, continued on montelukast,
fluticasone-salmeterol, albuterol nebs
