CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 57-year-old
male with a history of cardiac arrhythmia and four previous
episodes of "severe chest pain", transferred from [**Hospital6 3426**].  The patient reports the onset of [**9-8**] substernal
chest pain around 8:00 p.m.  The pain is associated with
diaphoresis.  The patient recalls "fainting" in the bathroom
while experiencing this discomfort.  He denied loss of
consciousness, head trauma, or seizure activity.  His wife
called 9-1-1.  When EMS arrived, an ECG was done and he was
found to have a heart rate of 30 beats per minute.  The
patient was noted to be "diaphoretic and ashen".

At [**Hospital6 33**] ED, the patient had a blood pressure
of 90/60 and a heart rate in the 60s.  EKG disclosed ST
segment elevations in II, III, aVF, and ST segment elevation
in V4R of 1 mm.  The patient was administered IV TNK and
Integrelin as well as 4 liters normal saline.  This resulted
in improvement in the patient's pain and ECG.

The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

Of note, the patient states that he had four episodes of
chest pain in the past.  He states that he usually has not
sought medical attention but tonight he decided to due to his
fainting episode.  The patient states that he underwent a
cardiac catheterization a few years ago at the [**Hospital1 756**].

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Denied dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea,
PND, fatigue, cough, fever, chills.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Arrhythmia:  The patient is not sure of the name of the
arrhythmia, he thinks it might be atrial fibrillation but
unclear.
2.  CAD:  The patient reports previous catheterization at the
[**Name (NI) 756**], unclear about details of catheterization.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  Hypertension.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Amiodarone.
2.  Captopril.
3.  Coumadin 5 mg one day, 4 mg the next day, alternating.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient drinks two drinks of alcohol a
night.  He smokes one pack every other day for the past 40
years.  Denied use of drugs.  He is employed as a manager at
[**Company 3004**].  He is married.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for breast cancer in his mother,
significant for CAD in his father.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  General: The patient was
a pleasant male in no apparent distress.  Vital signs:
Temperature 96, blood pressure 140/70, heart rate 80,
respiratory rate 22, 02 saturation 99% on 2 liters.  HEENT:
Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils equally round and reactive
to light.  Extraocular movements intact.  Mucous membranes
moist.  Oropharynx clear.  Heart:  Distant heart sounds,
regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2.  Lungs:  Clear to
auscultation anteriorly.  Abdomen: Soft, nontender, obese,
positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis
or edema.  Neurologic:  Alert and oriented times three.
Cranial nerves II through XII grossly intact.  Examination
otherwise nonfocal.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 21.8, hematocrit 42.5,
platelets 301,000.  Chemistries:  Sodium 142, potassium 3.8,
chloride 110, bicarbonate 17, BUN 14, creatinine 1, glucose
145.  PT 25.2, PTT 150, INR 4.2.  CK on admission 117,
troponin less than 0.3, MB 4, CK at 5:00 a.m. 186, ALT 49,
AST 61, alkaline phosphatase 81, total bilirubin 0.8.

ECG:  Normal sinus rhythm, 60 beats per minute, normal
intervals, vertical axis, ST segment elevation 2 mm in II,
III, aVF, T wave inversion in V2, V3, and V4, right-sided
leads showed 1 mm ST segment elevation in V4R, LVH.

IMPRESSION:  This is a 57-year-old male with inferior [**Hospital **]
transferred from [**Hospital6 33**] status post lytic
therapy.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the CCU for
management.  He was administered IV fluids due to his preload
dependence.  He was chest pain-free on arrival.  He was
maintained on heparin and aspirin.  He was started on a beta
blocker when his blood pressure improved.  His INR was
elevated so he was administered vitamin K in anticipation of
catheterization.

During his hospital stay, his CKs peaked at 186, MB 14, MB
index 7.5.  A lipid panel was measured.  Total cholesterol
was 237, triglycerides 181, LDL 152, HDL 49.

The patient was instructed about the importance of smoking
cessation and he was maintained on a nicotine patch.  An
echocardiogram was done on [**2180-2-25**].  The ejection
fraction was 15-20%.  The left atrium was moderately dilated.
The left ventricular cavity was moderately dilated.  There
was an apical left ventricular aneurysm.  There was severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis with slight preservation
of basal posterior wall motion.  Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed.  No masses or
thrombi were seen in the left ventricle.  The aortic valve
leaflets were mildly thickened.  The mitral valve leaflets
were mildly thickened.  There was 1+ MR.

The patient went to cardiac catheterization on [**2180-2-25**].  Coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed two vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA was
unobstructed.  The LAD had a 60% stenosis at its midsegment.
The left circumflex artery had mild diffuse disease only.
The RCA had a mid vessel diffusely diseased hazy segment with
up to 70% stenosis.

Resting hemodynamics revealed unremarkable right-sided and
elevated left-sided filling pressures (LVEDP 28) with normal
systemic arterial pressures and preserved cardiac output and
index (4.9 liters per minute and 2.6 liters per minute
respectively).  There was no significant systolic pressure
gradient across the aortic valve.

Left ventriculography revealed severely hypokinetic to
akinetic anterolateral and apical wall segments and a
distinctly hypokinetic inferior wall with a reduced overall
ejection fraction of 25%.  There was no significant MR.

Successful PTCA/stenting of the mid RCA was performed.  There
was 10% residual stenosis, normal flow, and no apparent
dissection.

Due to the patient's LV aneurysm found on echo, the patient
will require Coumadin.  Importance of medication compliance
and smoking cessation were emphasized to the patient.

DISCHARGE CONDITION: Good.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  The patient is to follow-up with his PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 49968**],
on Monday, [**2180-2-28**] so that his INR may be checked.
2.  The patient is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 49968**] in the next
two weeks for an appointment.  The patient states that he may
transfer his care to the [**Hospital **] Hospital.  The patient was given
the appropriate paperwork for such transfer.  If the patient
decides to transfer to the [**Hospital **] Hospital he will follow-up with
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and will be referred to a VA
cardiologist.
3.  The patient was instructed to call Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 284**]
at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 285**] to obtain an appointment in the Cardiac
Electrophysiology Clinic.  The patient needs ICD risk
stratification.
4.  Since the patient takes Amiodarone, it is important that
he have his LFTs, TFTs, and pulmonary function tests
followed.
