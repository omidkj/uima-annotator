History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 174**] is a 42 year old female with a history of alcoholic
cirrhosis, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and orthostatic
hypotension who presents with confusion, fevers and cough from
home.  The history is taken from the patient's fiance who lives
with the patient. The patient was last in her usual state of
health three weeks ago when she developed a cough and
laryngitis. Her fiance endorses that she has been drinking and
not taking her medications. Over the past few weeks she has had
a few bright red bowel movements.  She has not complained of
abdominal pain.  She has had intermittent fevers and cough.  She
has not had hemoptysis.  She has had nausea and vomiting
approximately once per day but this is non-bloody.  She has had
icteric sclera for two weeks and dark colored urine.  He cannot
give any further history.
.
In the ER her initial vitals were T 98.2F, BP 102/83, HR 112, RR
24, O2 sat 98% RA. Her exam was notable for icteric sclera and a
distended abdomen. She was also confused and had asterixis. Her
laboratories were notable for a lactate of 8.1, total bilirubin
of 30, albumin of 3.2, WBC count of 8.6 (baseline 3.4),
hematocrit of 25.6 and platelets of 98. INR was elevated at 1.9
(previously preserved).  Magnesium was 1.1, potassium 2.1. She
had a RUQ ultrasound which showed patent portal vasculature but
was a poor quality study.  No ascites noted.  She had a CXR
which showed no significant infiltrates.  She was tachycardic to
the 110s and tachypneic in the high 20s but her blood pressure
was stable.  She received ceftriaxone 1 gram x 1 and oral
potassium supplementation.  She is admitted to the MICU for
management of hepatic failure and electrolyte abnormalities.
.
On arrival to the ICU she is awake but has difficulty responding
to questions. Patient had notable agitation and seemed very
inattentive. Skin warm and jaundice noted with scleral icterus.
History obtained mainly from her PCP who came by ICU and her
sister.

Past Medical History:
- Chronic alcoholism with presumed alcoholic cirrhosis:  No
known history of varices.  Previously preserved synthetic
function per laboratories.  Hepatitis C and HIV negative.
Hepatitis B surface
antibody positive but core antibody negative.  Hepatitis A IgG
positive and IgM negative.
- Alcohol abuse: History of withdrawal but no seizures or DTS.
- Orthostatic hypotension
- Macrocytic anemia, likely ethanol related.  B12 and folate
previously normal.
- Peripheral neuropathy, likely related to alcoholic
polyneuropathy.
- Hypokalemia/Hypomagnesemia atributed to alcoholism and poor
nutrition as well as likely alcohol induced renal electrolyte
wasting

Social History:
She continues to smoke one pack a day, history of alcoholism
currently drinking, no history of illicit drug use.  Not
currently interested in quitting alcohol. She lives with her
boyfriend in an apartment. Per sister, her boyfriend uses
cocaine and patient may be using. Fiance in previous admission
was not allowed to see [**Known firstname **].  PCP states he is always
intoxicated and aggressive.  Concern that [**Known firstname **] is considered
developmentally disabled and he does not provide her with
appropriate care.  Also concern for abuse history in prior
notes. During hospital stay, patient had privacy alert against
boyfriend who was not allowed to visit or find out information
about patient.

Brother has diabetes.
Mother has congestive heart failure
