comfortable, with a mid-high 90s O2 sat.  On physical exam she
was noted to have crackles and tachypnea.  A CXR showed
bilateral pulmonary congestion.  A UA was negative for signs of
a UTI.  Her HCT was at baseline 35.  EKG demonstrated afib with
around 80.  Pt denied CP, but did report some occassional "heart

[**2168-12-3**]
EKG: Atrial fibrillation. Non-specific ST-T wave changes are
diffuse. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2168-11-1**] the ST-T
wave changes are similar.

[**2168-12-3**]
CXR: Prominent bronchovascular markings, with bilateral small
pleural
effusions and bibasilar atelectases, concerning for congestive
failure and
pulmonary edema.

[**2168-12-5**]
CXR: Increase in bilateral moderate-sized pleural effusions with

associated pulmonary vascular congestion and mild-to-moderate
pulmonary edema. On this background assessment for pneumonia is
limited and if concern exists, repeat examination should be
performed after diuresis.

11.13 CXR:
FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
stable. Pulmonary
vasculature indistinctness is improving consistent with
resolving pulmonary
edema. There are small bilateral pleural effusions as well as
retrocardiac
and bibasilar atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]yo [**Age over 90 595**]-speaking female admitted to general medicine
service for likely CHF exacerbation in the setting of poor
medication compliance transferred to the CCU secondary to
persistent tachypnea.
.
# Tachpnea/CHF: Pt was admitted for CHF exacerbation likely
secondary to med non-compliance and poor rate control of A. fib.
CXR revealed pulm edema. Initially cared for on the medical
floor, where she was diuresed to 64kg (previous d/c weight was
62kg) with IV Lasix [**Hospital1 **] 120mg. She was trasferred to the CCU for
close monitoring after an episode of tachypnea and desaturation.
 While in the ICU, challenging to balance her blood pressure and
fluid status. Pt was given gentle Lasix for diuresis and then
transitionted to torsemide PO 100mg [**Hospital1 **]. Went home with
torsemide 100mg [**Hospital1 **] and potassium supplementation. Discharge
weight was 61.5 kg. Pt with stage IV heart failure. Prognosis
discussed with family. Family and patient decided to be DNR/DNI.
Strongly encouraged pt to go to rehab but family and pt declined
and preferred to go home. Pt has 24 hour support at home.
.
#Afib: hx afib, CHADS score 3, and only on ASA, since fall risk.
Rate controlled with metoprolol 75mg once a day (decreased home
dose of 100mg [**Hospital1 **]) and diltiazem was added on this admission.
Metoprolol dose was decreased since pt became more hypotensive
with  higher dose of metoprolol. Pt went home on Diltiazem 240mg
daily and metoprolol 75 mg daily.
.
#Chronic Falls: Continued Phenytoin
.
#Gallstones: Continued home Ursodiol
