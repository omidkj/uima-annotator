[**2135-2-18**]


History of Present Illness:
This is a 77 y.o. male with CAD s/p MI in [**2125**], DM, HTN, and
hyperlipidemia who awoke on the morning of [**2135-2-18**] at 3:00 am
with chest pain.  He describes the onset of feeling somewhat
unwell after dinner, and then at 3:00 am he was woken up by left
sided crushing chest pain that started quite mild but then
progressively increased in intensity.  He denies any radiation
to his neck or arm.  He reports this is similar to his previous
ischemic symptoms.  He denies any shortness of breath or
diaphoresis.  He may have felts slightly light-headed but has
difficulty fully clarifying this.  This pain did awaken him from
sleep and did not change on exertion.  He called EMS and was
brought into the hospital.

On arrival to the ED, VS T98, HR 56, BP 137/73, RR 20, O2 100%
on RA. EKG w/ inferior borderline (barely 1 mm) STE w/ possible
reciprocal changes. Therefore, code STEMI was called and he
received aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin, and was started on
epifibatide and nitroglycerin before going for cardiac
catheterization. This revealed 3V disease including a likely
culprit lesion in an OM. Unfortunately, intervention was not
feasible given anatomy and extent of disease. Epifibatide was
stopped prior to leaving the cath lab due to a developing
hematoma at the site of his arterial puncture.  At the time of
arrival to the CCU he denied any chest pain or other complaints.


Cardiac review of systems is notable for chest pain and chronic
lower extremity edema. It is notably negative for dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations,
syncope or presyncope.

OTHER STUDIES
==============
Admission EKG: Sinus rhythm. Left axis deviation. There is a
non-specific intraventricular conduction delay. There are Q
waves in the inferior leads with ST segment elevation and
terminal T wave inversions consistent with acute or evolving
myocardial infarction. Additional non-specific ST-T wave
changes. Clinical correlation is suggested. Compared to the
previous tracing ST segment elevation in the inferior leads is
new.

Cardiac Cath [**2135-2-18**]
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right-dominant system
demonstrated three-vessel disease. The LMCA was long and without
angiographically apparent disease. The LAD had a long 40%
stenosis in
its proximal portion, followed by serial 70% and 90% stenoses in
the mid
and distal segments, respectively. The LCx had a 90% mid-vessel
stenosis, the first obtuse marginal had a 50% stenosis and the
second
obtuse marginal had a 60% stenosis in its proximal portion and a
99%
stenosis in its middle portion. The RCA had a long 50% stenosis
proximally, an 80% distal stenosis and a 90% distal stenosis
involving
the bifurcation.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated
systolic blood
pressure with an SBP of 147 mm Hg and a DBP of 85 mm Hg.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Inferior STEMI.

TTE [**2135-2-18**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior
hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared to the prior report dated [**2130-10-4**], minimal AS is now
present.

CXR [**2135-2-18**]:
SINGLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: The heart is normal in size. The
aorta is mildly tortuous. The lungs are clear without
consolidation or edema. There is no pleural effusion or
pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.


Brief Hospital Course:
77 y.o. male with known CAD and previous IMI as well as DM, HTN,
and PVD presenting with chest pain and found to have likely
STEMI by EKG. Cardiac catheterization showing non-intervenable
disease, and he admitted to the CCU for medical management of
MI.

1)STEMI/CAD: Patient's EKG showed evidence of inferior STEMI.
Patient was taken the cath lab emergently,  and was found to
have diffuse 3 vessel disease.  No intervention was attempted
because of the diffuse nature of the disease.  Patient was then
admitted
