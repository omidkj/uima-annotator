Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted via ED where a foley was placed. A renal duplex u/s
demonstrated the transplanted kidney in the left lower quadrant
measuring 11.7 cm. There were no stones, masses, or
hydronephrosis. Resistive indices ranged from 0.68-0.87. Normal
venous flow was demonstrated. He was started on Levaquin for a
urinalysis that revealed >50 wbc, and >rbc without bacteria.
Creatinine was 6.4.

Nephrology was consulted and followed the patient throughout
this hospital course. A renal biopsy was deferred initally to
allow for relief of bladder retention by replacement of foley
and treatment of UTI. Lasix was started for fluid overload.
Midodrine was also started  in an attempt to increase his BP. BP
ran low (80/50). Tamsulosin and lopressor were stopped. BP
continued to be low. Midodrine was increased without
improvement.

The creatinine improved to 5.6 with the foley in place. Hct was
27.1. Epogen was started. Iron was 35, tibc 156, and ferritin
845. He was transused with a unit of PRBC.

On HD 3, he started to complain of severe penile burning/pain
and low back pain. A small amount of urine drained from his
foley. Pyridium was started without improvement of penile pain.
Lasix was given [**Hospital1 **]. A repeat u/a demonstrated wbc, 21-50* rbc
[**11-4**]* bacteria FEW yeast NONE and epi 0-2. Urology was
consulted. Paraphymosis (reddened)and edema was noted. DRE
revealed exquisitely tender swollen gland. Prostatis was
suspected. Recommendations included continuation of Levaquin for
2 weeks. Morphine was administered with decreased pain. Triple
antibiotic at the meatus and elevation were recommended as well
as hemodialysis to decrease swelling. Dialysis was deferred.

Impaired arterial flow to the renal transplant [**1-17**] low bp was
felt to compound the delayed graft function.  Cardiology was
consulted assist in management of CHF and low BP. A TTE
demonstrated an EF of 40-45%. The left atrium was moderately
dilated.  There was moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size was normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function
[**Last Name (un) **] mildly depressed. Inferior akinesis was present. The aortic
valve leaflets were moderately thickened. The mitral valve
leaflets were moderately thickened. Severe (4+) mitral
regurgitation was seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation
was seen. There was moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Compared with the findings of the prior study of
[**2142-9-11**], there had been no  significant change.  Cardiology
recommended stopping the midodrine and digoxin, resuming low
dose lopressor po and lasix IV 80mg tid. At this point, given
his severe penile pain, volume overload and hypotension, he was
transferred to the SICU for intubation for respiratory distress,
 management of hypotension and pain control. IV Dobutamine,
levaophed and pitressin were initiated to keep sbp >100. CVVHD
was done. PRBC were transfused for hct of 27. Urine output
improved to 1.5 liters per day. Pitressin, levophed and
dobutamine were weaned. He was extubated and transfered back to
the  medical surgical unit.

Lopressor 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] was started to lower heart rate to allow
for increased filling time to improve cardiac output. BPs
averaged 80s/49-119/68 with a heart rate in 80-90s. Lasix was
started with small response. The creatinine remained in the
range of 2.7-2.9. Urine output averaged 600cc/day. Due to some
GI complaints and elevated creatinine, cellcept was decreased.
Rapamune was started in an attempt to wean off prograf which can
be nephrotoxic. This plan was reversed when a renal transplant
biopsy on [**10-3**] revealed rejection demonstrated by
endotheleitis. Three solumedrol pulses of 500mg qd x3 days were
given with a decrease in creatinine to 2.6.  Rapamune was
stopped and prograf was uptitrated given the diagnosis of
rejection. Target prograf levels are [**9-26**]. Cellcept should
continue at 1gram [**Hospital1 **]. Cardiology was reconsulted. Low dose
nesereitide was recommended.

On [**10-4**], asymetrical swelling in RUE was noted. An u/s revealed
a thrombus in the right subclavian extending to the axillary
vein. He was started on IV heparin and coumadin. Heparin was
stopped on [**10-8**] when the INR increased to 3.5 on coumadin 5mg
qd. Coumadin will be held [**10-8**] and resumed at 2.5mg on
[**2142-10-9**]. Left subclavian line was removed prior to discharge. A
Tessio catheter was left in place for future lab drawing and
possible hemodialysis if graft failure.

Physical therapy followed and recommended rehab for
deconditioning, impaired balance, decreased ADL independence and
decreased strength. Nutrition was consulted for poor po intake.
Boost supplements were started. [**Last Name (un) **] followed and adjusted his
glargine and humalog. Hyperglycemia improved off solumedrol
pulse doses.

Given prolonged bedrest and decreased mobility he developed
decubitus. A wound care nurse consult was obtained with the
following recommendations.  Stage 1 sacral decubitus required
duoderm gel followed by Allevyn changed
