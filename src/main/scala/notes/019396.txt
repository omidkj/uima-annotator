History of Present Illness:
NF admit seen and appreciated.  Briefly this is a [**Age over 90 **] yo f w/ h/o
lung ca w/ metastasis to brain on XRT, s/p fall at NH on Sun
eve. No LOC.  [**1-9**] lethargy, n/v,L arm weakness, sent to [**Hospital1 **]
[**Location (un) 620**] where she was noted to havv 3x3cm R posterior parietal
bleed.  Tx to NSICU, started on dilantin (load) and decadron.

MRI:On diffusion-weighted images there is a small area of
restricted diffusion along the falx within the left
occipitotemporal lobe. It is also bright on FLAIR-weighted
images and may represent a subacute infarct. Clinical
correlation is recommended. On gradient echo images there is a
large area of intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the right
parietal lobe and left thalamus which following administration
of gadolinium reveals ring-enhancing lesions. These are
suspicious for hemorrhagic metastases given the patient's
history. Additional ring-enhancing lesions throughout the supra-
and infratentorial compartments are visualized. There is a
moderate amount of peritumoral edema involving the right
parietal lobe lesion in addition to a second right parietal
lesion along the falx high in the vertex. The other areas of
metastases reveal a minimal amount of peritumoral edema.
.
cxr: Cardiomegaly and mild CHF. Nasogastric tube as described
above. Rounded opacity overlying the left hilum, which probably
representing aspiration pneumonia; however, left hilar mass
cannot be totally excluded. Please confirm resolution by
repeated chest x-ray after treatment, and if the lesion
persists, please evaluate by CT scan.
.
ct: Stable appearance of right parietal lobe and left thalamic
hemorrhages, which are concerning for hemorrhagic metastasis in
this patient with known metastatic lung carcinoma to the brain.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo f s/p INH in R parietal region, evidence of [**Hospital 58799**]
transferred to medicine, w/ pupillary assymmetry but no evidence
of neglect, responding to commands.
.
1) altered MS- likely bleed into metastatic lesion, although
unclear based on location of known lesions, vs component of
fall.  as per NS, not a surgical candidate.  seems unlikely that
pt will have dramatic cliical improvement given significant
edema, mass lesions, and no NS intervention.
-palliative XRT? family mtg tonite to discuss utility.
-cont dilantin px, particularly since pt has ? of witnessed sz
event.
-cont high dose decadron, q6h w/ fs.
-will clarify
.
2) GIB- drop in hct during admission and + NGL.  GI input
appreciated felt likely [**1-9**] stress ulceration.  Enteral
nutrition and PPI (usually oral) have been shown to reduce the
risk of ongoing bleeding.
-start TF's 10cc/h until nutrition recs
-IV protonix (given recent h/o GIB)
.
3) CAD/CHF- previously some CHF on CXR.  oxygenating well.
euvolemic on exam despite significant anasarca of hands/feet-
minimal swelling of tibial surfaces so partially related to
restraints.
-cont lopresser
-d/c lipitor, rx for hepatic dz.

On [**2104-1-4**] a family meeting was held with Oncology, Social Work,
Palliative Care Consult and primary medical team. At that time
the family decided to place comfort as the main goal of her
medical care. Her status was changed to "CMO".
