Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
exertional angina

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with stent placement to stenosis of
right internal carotid artery


History of Present Illness:
73 y/o with a history of COPD, CAD, s/p mid RCA and OM PTCA
[**2133**], tobacco abuse, HTN was referred for cardiac cath done for
exertional angina done on [**9-18**]. Cath showed LCX 70%, complete
RCA occlusion with collaterals, right axillary 95%, right
carotid 90%. She was admitted to NP service and on [**2153-9-19**]->
s/p axillary PTA, RRA appoach. She was placed on ASA/Plavix. On
[**9-21**] she returned to OR for right carotid stent.
.
The patient was noted to have an RCA that fills well via
collaterals in [**8-11**]. Stress testing on [**2152-10-25**] showed a small
reversible inferior defect in the AC non-corrected images.  In
[**7-12**], she was referred for aortoiliac ultrasound, carotid study
that showed severe stenosis of the R internal carotid artery and
moderate stenosis of the L internal carotid artery. She
developed exertional pain in her arms and chest and back
recently, and so she was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] here at [**Hospital1 18**].
Neurology was consulted pre-procedurally prior to the carotid
intervention. Neuro and patient note a baseline left facial
flattness/mouth edge droop.
.
She states that she was refered for cardiac catheterization
because she has had anginal sxs of chest pain to her left arm,
particularly after an hour of working/sanding her deck this
summer. She states that she can ride her exercise bike for 10
minutes but has to stop because of hip pain. She is able to
climb her stairs at home and do oher activitiy without
difficulty. The sxs she reported this summer were relieved with
15 minutes of rest and did not go away with nitro.
.
She notes that she has a dry cough from her COPD at baseline but
is not on home oxygen.  Reports no recent CP or dyspnea.  No BM
since Monday. She does occassionally have zigzags in her vision,
more in her right eye than her left, due to cataracts.  Upon
arrival to the floor she noted neck pain, which quickly
improved. Further, upon being on the floor she twice stated that
upon awakening from sleep she had feelings of being dissoriented
with the "bed vertical, feeling higher in the air, the clock and
the calendar sideways." She denies having this before but states
that this feeling/vision was in both eyes and resolved in less
than 1 minute. She denies feeling/seeing it upon evaluation.  On
review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of pulmonary
embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint
pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. S/he
denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. S/he denies exertional
buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were
negative.

indicating
severe stenosis.
2. Successful PTA alone of right axillary stenosis with 4.0x20mm
NC
balloon and then 5.0x15mm NC balloon with 10% residual stenosis
and
virtual elimination of gradient.
3. Successful hemostasis of right radial arteriotomy with TR
band.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe right axillary stenosis.
2. Successful PTA alone of right axillary artery with 5.0mm NC

Cardiac cath [**9-21**]:
Angiography and PTA COMMENTS:
After clearing the guide, first
the right brachiocephalic artery was engaged and then the right
common
carotid artery. Cerebral angiography showed patent RMCA and
RACA.
Angiography of the right carotid confirmed a severe stenosis in
the
right internal carotid artery just after the bifurcation. A
