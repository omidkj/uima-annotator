Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  Severe mitral valve prolapse

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 916**] was in his usual state
of health until the beginning of [**2130-12-31**], when his
primary care physician on physical examination heard a loud
systolic murmur on a routine clinic visit.  The patient
reported at the time that he had been noticing increasing
dyspnea on exertion in the months prior to admission to the
hospital, which he had attributed to his chronic anemia and
persistent diarrhea which also had been worse over some time.
During the week prior to admission, he had also noticed some
worsening edema in his ankles.  The patient at the time had
been having frequent dental work, and mentioned that he often
forgot to take prophylactic antibiotics secondary to his
mitral valve regurgitation.  He denied any history of
intravenous drug use.  He also denied any lightheadedness or
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, but he did have orthopnea with
three to four pillows.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Psoriasis; 2.  IgA deficiency for
which the patient receives monthly transfusions of
intravenous Immunoglobulin; 3.  Bronchiectasis; 4.  Crohn's
disease for which the patient is on chronic Prednisone; 5.
Severe osteoporosis; 6.  History of malignant polyp; 7.
Esophageal stricture, status post dilatation in [**2125**], status
post small bowel resection in [**2123**]; 8.  Mitral valve
prolapse; 9.  Hypothyroidism; 10. Chronic anemia; 11.
Duodenitis; 12.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease; 13.
Emphysema; 14.  Prostate cancer in situ; 15.  Tobacco and
alcohol abuse.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Prednisone 10 mg q. day;
Levothyroxine 50 mcg q. day; Combivent 2 puffs twice per day;
Ativan 0.5 mg prn; Lisinopril 2.5 mg q. day

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone in [**Location 4288**] and has
a strong history of alcohol and tobacco use, stating that he
had smoked two packs per day for 28 years.  He works as a
certified public accountant.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On initial physical examination the
patient's height was 5 feet 6 inches, weight 135 lb,
heartrate 82 in sinus rhythm, and the blood pressure was
120/64 with a room air oxygen saturation of 96%.  The patient
was a pleasant, elderly male in no acute distress.  His neck
was supple with no lymphadenopathy, no jugulovenous
distension and no carotid bruits.  His cardiac examination
showed a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2, and a
loud holosystolic murmur.  His lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  His abdomen was soft, nontender,
nondistended with no hepatosplenomegaly or other palpable
masses.  His extremities were warm and dry with peripheral
edema, especially around the ankles.  He had 2+ palpable
dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Operating
Room on [**2131-2-20**] where he underwent a minimally
invasive mitral valve repair with quadrangular resection of
the posterior leaflet and 28 mm [**Doctor Last Name 405**] ring.  Please refer
the dictated operative note for full details of this
procedure.  The patient was subsequently transferred to the
Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit in good condition, and
weaning from the ventilator was begun.  The patient was
subsequently extubated later that evening after having shown
a good arterial blood gas.  He tolerated the extubation well
with no difficulty.  He was at this time requiring a
Neosynephrine drip in order to maintain adequate blood
pressure.  An insulin drip was also started at this time to
help control his blood sugar.  On postoperative day #1 he
continued to be on insulin and Neosynephrine drips, with
sinus rhythm at 77 beats/minute.  He was tolerating
extubation well, and was in no acute distress.  On
postoperative day #2 he was weaned off of the Neosynephrine
and insulin drips but did demonstrate a decrease in urine
output for which he was given Lasix with good response.  The
patient was able to maintain his blood pressure without
pressors, and by postoperative day #2, it was deemed that the
patient was stable and doing well enough fro transfer to the
floor.  His chest tube had been left in place on transfer
from the Intensive Care Unit, and the patient had an air leak
from his chest tube as well as some subcutaneous emphysema on
the right side.  The chest tubes were subsequently removed on
postoperative day #3 without incidents once the air leak was
gone.  The patient also was set up for and received his
intravenous immunoglobulin infusion on postoperative day #3
which he tolerated well.  He did well with incentive
spirometry and pulmonary toilet and was ambulating without
much difficulty at that time.  Later on postoperative day #3,
he was seen by physical therapy and evaluated, and later
deemed safe to be discharged home.  The patient continued to
do quite well, and on postoperative day #4 he was deemed
stable and ready for discharge home.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient's temperature
was 97.8 degrees F.  His heartrate was 80 in sinus rhythm and
a blood pressure of 90s/50s and a room air oxygen saturation
of 91 to 93%.  He was showing a good urine output and having
a good diuresis.  He was in no acute distress.  His cardiac
examination showed regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His abdomen
was soft, nontender and nondistended with no
hepatosplenomegaly or other palpable masses.  His
subcutaneous emphysema had decreased to the point of being
nearly negligible.  His incisions were healing nicely with no
erythema or drainage.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Enteric coated Aspirin 325 mg q. day
2.  Lopressor 12.5 mg b.i.d.
3.  Prednisone 10 mg q. day
4.  Zantac 150 mg b.i.d.
5.  Levothyroxine 50 mcg p.o. q. day
6.  Percocet 1 to 2 tablets every 4-6 hours as needed for
