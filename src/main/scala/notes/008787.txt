Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2745**]
Chief Complaint:
lethargy and hypertension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
TEE [**2120-11-29**]


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 51 year old woman with history of asthma,
hypertension, chronic knee/back pain on chronic narcotics who
was admitted to an OSH 6 days ago with lethargy. She was found
by her son as minimally arousable on [**2120-11-19**]. The son called
EMS the following day after being asked to do so by her husband
who lives in [**Name (NI) 3844**]. The patient was admitted to the OSH
for evaluation of the lethargy that was presumably due to the
narcotics. Urine tox + for benzos and barbituates. Her mental
status improved with administration of Narcan both by EMS and by
the ED physicians. Subsequent to that she was notably
hypertensive that was attributed to clonidine withdrawal. A head
CT was done to further evaluated her mental status which showed
old infarct as well as subacute infarcts. The patient had been
hypokalemic at the OSH with low of 2.6. A psychiatry consult
evaluated her and placed her on a Section 12 given the concern
for an intentional overdose. It was the opinion of the
consulting psychiatrist that she would likely benefit from an
inpatient psychiatry stay once medically stabilized. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. Prior to transfer
her blood pressure was 140/82 after receiving oral and topical
medications.
.
The patient states that she took too many of her pills because
she "just felt like it." She denies wanting to hurt herself or
kill herself. She denies worsening feelings of depression.
.
ROS: no headache. no chest pain. no shortness of breath. cough
produtive of green or white sputum. no blood in sputum. no
nausea or vomiting. no pain with urinating.

MRA Brain & Neck w/o contrast [**2120-11-26**]
1. Slow diffusion involving the [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter of the right insula
and the adjacent right temporal lobe. This finding likely
represents acute or subacute infarcts. However, if there is
concern for an infectious process, this may represent
cerebritis.
2. Old infarcts of the right parietal and occipital lobes which
are new
 compared to [**2120-2-12**].
3. Abrupt cutoff of the M1 segment of the right middle cerebral
artery. The acuity of this finding is uncertain.
4. Diffusely decreased T1 signal of the bone marrow which may
represent marrow reconversion but an infiltrative process cannot
be excluded.

Echocardiogram [**2120-11-29**]
Complex and calcified atheroma in the aortic arch. No thrombus
identified in the left atrium or ventricle. No evidence of PFO
or ASD.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSEMENT/PLAN: 51 year old woman with chronic pain, COPD,
depression, cluster B disorders p/w lethargy in setting of
methadone overdose, complicated by hypertension, found to have
subacute CVA.
.
# CVA: Pt noted to have subacute stroke on imaging involving the
right insula and adjacent R temporal lobe with clinical evidence
of L facial droop, L pronator driift and distal UE weakness. She
was followed closely by the neurology service, concern for an
embolic stroke. TTE & carotid ultrasound were unremarkable. TEE
showed complex atheroma in aortic arch and pt was continued on
aspirin 325mg daily, which she had not been in the past -
neurology held off on coumadin due to high risk for bleeding.
She has also been started on Lipitor. CTA was not performed due
to her dye allergy with anaphylaxis. PT& OT eval for
rehabilitation. Speech improved and per swallow examination
increased pt to ground solid food & thin liquids. She should be
re-evaluated and her diet advanced. Pt is scheduled to follow up
with Dr.[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2530**] [**Name (STitle) **] in neurology for followup.
.
# Hypertension: Pt with labile HTN during hospitalization, was
only on single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] Nifedipine at home. She was started on
Labetolol, captopril & clonidine to control SBP <140, clonidine
was stopped. BP currently well controlled on 3 agents,
labetalol, nifedipine and lisinopril with SBP ranging 120-140's.
.
# SI/depression: On admission, pt was actively suicidal in the
ICU and psychiatry was consulted. s/p overdose with narcotics,
benzos. Althought Section 12 on admission, requiring 1:1 sitter,
prior to discharge reevaluation revealed no SI. She was
restarted on celexa 20mg qhs. Psych felt that she did not
warrant inpatient therapy and recommended outpatient psych
followup with Dr.[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1681**].
.
# Diabetes: Newly diagnosed during admission based on FSG during
hospitalization. FSG were well controlled on glyburide 2.5mg po
daily.
.
# Chronic pain: Although pt was chronically on methadone and
benzo's for multiple pains including back and knees, she has not
been on any narcotic regimen during admission. She was provided
tylenol, ultram for occasional pains, fiorcet for headache
control.
.
# UTI: per urine culture. Completed 7 day course of
ciprofloxacin.
.
# R submandibular lymph node: Present; Per pt, recurrent &
painful but currently without any pain; has been evaluated in
the past. Would recommend outpatient f/u, no acute issue.
.
# Asthma: Continued pt on Advair. Albuterol & atrovent PRN
.
Pt has reached maximal hospital benefit and is being discharged
home with 24hr supervision as well as multiple home services
including PT, social work and nursing. She is to follow up with
PCP as well as Dr.[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2530**] [**Name (STitle) **] in Neurology.
