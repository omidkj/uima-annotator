Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2234**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
80 y/o M hx of metastatic non-sclc who presents with SOB, fever,
chills, and malaise. He had been in his baseline state of health
(chronic diarrhea, nausea and fatigue from chemotherapy) until
the day of admission when he suddenly developed worsening
fatigue, subjective fevers, followed by worsening SOB and
labored breathing. He also reports 1 episode of emesis. He
denies any increase in his chronic diarrhea (2 episodes/day),
denies any melena, BRBPR, hemoptysis, hematemesis, chest pain,
pleuritic pain. Recent sick contacts include his wife who had sx
c/w viral URI. Per family, he also frequently aspirates his
food.
.
In ED, T initially 99.3, but then spiked to 103.3. BP 200/110,
HR 130, RR 45, 89% 3LNC. He was started on bipap as family
refused intubation at that time. He was also started on nitro
gtt and nitropaste at the same time. BP dropped to 80, but
returned to 120's after 500 cc bolus. CTA negative for PE, but
showed multifocal pneumonia and a large amount of airway
secretions. Head CT negative for bleed. He received levaquin 750
mg IV X1, CTX 1 gm X 1, ASA 325, net intake 2500cc/net output
1700cc foley.
.
Upon arrival to ICU, he states that he is feeling much better.
He is still more SOB than baseline, but much improved. He denies
chills, rigors, CP, N/V, abd pain, body aches. ROS otherwise
unremarkable.

CT HEAD [**2-24**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Hypoattenuating periventricular and subcortical right and
left frontal lesions display no evidence of enhancement
(contrast still within the intracranial circulation from prior
contrast-enhanced CT) which is highly suggestive of chronic
small vessel ischemic disease. If there is continued high
clinical suspicion, MRI may be ordered for more sensitive
evaluation.
2. Probable left maxillary sinusitis.
CTA CHEST [**2-24**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Limited evaluation due to marked amount of respiratory
artifact. No evidence of aortic dissection or central/segmental
pulmonary emboli.
2. Multifocal right and left lower lobe pneumonia with large
amount of secretions noted within the airways, suggesting
aspiration as etiology. Soft tissue thickening along the left
lower lobe bronchovascular bundle, may be reactive in etiology,
however, underlying neoplastic involvement cannot be excluded.
3. Multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules in this patient who is
status post right upper lobectomy consistent with metastatic
lung cancer.
4. Hypoattenuating right thyroid lesion likely benign. If
alteration clinical management will occur, can consider further
evaluation with dedicated ultrasound.
5. Dilated main pulmonary artery suggestive of underlying
pulmonary hypertension in this patient with backgroun emphysema.

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: ? pulm edema evidence heart failure

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
80 year old man with aspiration pneumonia, copd, non small lung
cancer s/p fluid rescucitation with crackles, oxygen requirement

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
? pulm edema evidence heart failure
HISTORY: Aspiration pneumonia with the previous malignancy
status post fluid resuscitation with crackles, to evaluate for
overhydration.

FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**2-25**], there is little
change in the appearance of the heart and lungs. Specifically,
no evidence of pulmonary congestion. There is blunting of the
right costophrenic angle that could be a manifestation of
pleural effusion, though differences in patient position could
account for this.

Cardiac Echo:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The right atrial pressure is
indeterminate. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Transmitral Doppler and tissue
velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic
dysfunction. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free
wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan
80 y/o M with stage IV lung cancer p/w multifocal pneumonia &
troponin leak in setting of SIRS.
.
1. Respiratory distress/PNA: multifocal pneumonia on CT s/p
witnessed aspiration events. Influenza negative.   Started on
levofloxacin, ceftriaxone, flagyl initially.  Admitted to [**Hospital Ward Name 332**]
ICU.  Non re-breather on admit, weaned to 2 liters in ICU.
Urinary legionella antigen, blood cultures ultimately retunred
negative.  To floor on [**2-25**].  Ceftriaxone discontinued and
vancomycin course initiated given GPC in pairs and clusters on
gram stain of sputum culture.  Sputum culture ultimately grew
mixed flora.  Given aspiration event, covered for staph with
vancomycin.
Completed 8 day course levo/flagyl on [**3-3**].  Completed 8 day
course of vancomycin on [**3-4**].  Afebrile for entire time on
medicine floor.  Speech and swallow evaluation with some
aspiration but recommended regular diet, crushed pills.   No
further aspiration in house.  Weaned off supplemental oxygen
including with ambulation
