Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1436**]
Chief Complaint:
Right hand numbness, dysarthria, chest pressure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 87 y/o woman with PMH notable for hypertension,
prior TIA, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (on coumadin) who
presents following several hours of right hand numbness and one
episode of aphasia earlier today. Patient notes first episodes
of right hand numbness last Thursday. Lasted several hours and
resolved on its own. This morning, woke up with right hand
numbness which eventually resolved over several hours. Then,
when the patient went to get iced coffee with her daughter, she
could not speak her intended words. At that time, her daughter
took her to [**Hospital3 **]. There, she had a head CT which
demonstrated acute on chronic SDH with mass effect. Though we do
not have records from [**Hospital1 5075**] ED, she was treated with
decadron and then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] due to patient family
preference.

In our ED, the patient's initial vitals were T 96.7, BP 185/76,
HR 68, RR 16, 97% on RA. NSG was contact[**Name (NI) **]. She was given 1 U
FFP (infusing when brought up to floor). She was ordered for
hydralazine to be given as needed for SBP > 180 but this was not
given. At about 1430, she complained of [**6-13**] chest pressure
which did not radiate. This lasted about 2 minutes. EKG was
obtained, and she was given nitroglycerin and the pain resolved.
1st set of cardiac enzymes was negative.

On arrival to the MICU, the patient is without complaint. She
denies any numbness of the right arm or hand. She denies any
chest pain, difficulty breathing, or nausea. She denies any
current difficulty with speech or headache though does endorse
frontal bilateral headache for the past 5 days, intermittent in
nature, which is not typical for her. Denies any head trauma or
headache.

She is not particularly active at baseline; she walks at her
house and then around in the backyard. She is able to do this
without any shortness of breath or chest pain. She has had
several episodes of chest pain in the past few weeks, similar in
character, lasting minutes which resolve without intervention.
She does not report any dyspnea, diaphoresis, or nausea with
these episodes. She reports that the pain has come on at rest
and not with exertion per se.


Past Medical History:
* Hypertension
* s/p pacemaker ("passing out" spells, not sure indication)
* TIA in [**11-10**]
* Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (on Coumadin)

Social History:
Patient lives with daughter. Previously worked as homemaker & in
her family's sub [**Location (un) 6002**] shop. No h/o smoking. Drinks one
alcoholic beverage per week. No illicit drug use.

Mother and brother with "heart problems," thinks CHF. Son died
in 30s from brain tumor

Pertinent Results:
<b>[**2111-10-11**] HEAD CT</b>
IMPRESSION: Predominantly chronic left subdural hematoma
measuring up to 1.8 cm from the inner table with mild associated
mass effect and midline shift. There is no evidence of
herniation.
<br>
<b>[**2111-10-12**] HEAD CT</b>
IMPRESSION: No significant change in chronic left subdural
hematoma. No
evidence for new hemorrhage or worsening of associated mass
effect.
<br>
<b>[**2111-10-13**] HEAD CT</b>
IMPRESSIONS: No change in extent of chronic left subdural
hematoma. However, foci of increased attenuation along its
inferior extent may represent a small amount of acute on chronic
bleeding. No change in mass effect on the left frontal cortex.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: The slight apparent increase in
density within the inferior portion of the left subdural
hematoma may be due to changes in head position within the
scanner, rather than real appearance of new hemorrhage.
<br>
<b>[**2111-10-14**] HEAD CT</b>
IMPRESSION: No significant change in the extent or appearance of
the left
subdural hematoma. No increase in mass effect, midline shift, or
associated edema.

<b>EKGs</b>
[**2111-10-11**] 1400: A-V paced, no acute ST changes
[**2111-10-11**] 1635: sinus rhythm at 70, LAD, LVH, diffuse symmetric T
wave inversions in V3-6, biphasic T wave in V2, inverted T waves
in II, III, aVF
[**2111-10-11**] 2200: sinus rhythm at 80, LAD, symmetric inverted T
waves in V3-6, biphasic T wave in V2, inverted T waves in II,
III, aVF0

<b>[**2111-10-12**] TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY</b>
CONCLUSIONS:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the
distal half of the left ventricle. Basal segments contract well
(LVEF 30%). The apex is aneurysmal, but no masses or thrombi are
seen(but images quality is suboptimal). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No aortic stenosis is seen. Mild to moderate ([**2-4**]+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**2-4**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Extensive regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD. Mild-moderate mitral
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild-moderate aortic regurgitation.

Brief Hospital Course:
87 y/o woman with presenting complaint of right hand clumsiness
and dysarthria initially admitted to the MICU with an acute on
chronic subdural hematoma whit sequelae of TIA vs. seizure. Also
suffered an NSTEMI and a short period of pulmonary edema in
setting of systolic heart failure.
<br>
<i>## Acute on chronic subdural hemorrhage:</i>
Imaging at admission revealed small area of acute on chronic
subdural hemorrhage. Consulted neurology who felt that the
transient right hand clumsiness and dysarthria may have been the
result of a left pontine lacunar infarct/TIA, due to the SDH
directly or because of simple partial seizure caused by the SDH.
Neurosurgery was also consulted and initially felt that a Burr
hole would be indicated. While in the ED, she developed chest
pressure later found to be the sentinel symptom for NSTEMI.
Given the intervening NSTEMI, neurosurgery felt that although
she needed surgical drainage of her SDH, her cardiac issues
should be dealt with
