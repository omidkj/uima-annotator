Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 10493**]
Chief Complaint:
R. arm twitching, sent to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for respiratory monitoring

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 19426**] is an 85 yo F with hx of severe COPD (FEV1 of
0.63), HTN, diastolic CHF with preserved EF, recently admitted
[**Date range (1) 19429**] with a COPD exacerbation and RLL PNA started on
levofloxacin and prednisone taper who presents from rehab today
because of concern for seizure activity. Per nursing and neuro
notes, she was doing well in the AM and ate breakfast and then
began having twitching in her arms and legs around noon with
increasing confusion. She at this time was still talking but her
speech supposedly was not normal. She was given 100 mg of
dilantin and 25 mg of trazodone and transferred her for further
evaluation. She also was noted to have a temp of 99.2 this AM
with diarrhea and emesis. Patient's baseline is apparently
AAOx3, pleasant, and normal language.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, neurology evaluated her and found her dilantin
level to be subtherapeutic at 1.9. She was loaded with 1g IV
dilantin in the ED and she had an EEG showing severe
encephalopathy but no convulsive status. She had a head CT which
showed no evidence of ICH/mass but showed ?air fluid levels in
the sinus. Additionally, during her EEG, she was placed on high
levels of oxygen during her transportation and EEG stay and her
O2 sats were in the mid 90's. When she returned from her test,
she was noted to be more lethargic and her ABG showed 7.09/91/71
-> she was placed on BiPAP and her oxygen was decreased to
maintain her oxygenation in the high 80's and her next ABG was
7.16/72/66. She awoke up more and she tore off her BiPAP.
Additionally, neurology recommended that an LP should be done
and MRI with stroke protocol, however she was just started on
vanco/ceftriaxone/ampicillin and transferred here without an
LP/MRI. She was given 3 liters of fluid in the ER prior to
transfer.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the patient was able to relate only part
of her story, stating that she had had diarrhea for the last few
days in her nursing home but was told to see if it would resolve
on its own.  She notes feeling thirsty and dry and says all she
has had to eat in the last few days was one banana and a little
bit of ice water. She denies neck pain or stiffness, denies
photophobia, says she had a headache at the nursing home that
has resolved. At baseline she uses 3L O2 by NC at all times.
She denies any awareness of twitching but says she had been
feeling weak and dropped her whole tray of food this morning.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 19426**] is an 85 yo F with hx of severe COPD with recent
COPD exacerbation, LLL PNA who presented with a questionable
seizure episode from rehab and had acute respiratory acidosis in
the setting of being on 100% FiO2. She was noted to have an
abnormal EEG in the setting of being on 100% FiO2. She was noted
to have increasing confusion and this was attributed to CO2
retention.
.
In the ICU, the pt was found to be maintaining her O2 sats at
88-92 on 1-3LNC.  She refused bipap adamantly for CO2 retention,
and reconfirmed her desire not to be intubated.  The ICU team
was unable to increase her ventilation artificially.  The pt was
continued on her usual outpatient inhalers and nebulizers, and
given her solumedrol.  She was found to have a metabolic
acidosis (baseline bicarb 35 and on presentation it was 25) so
her diamox was stopped, which she has been on as an outpatient
and was recently increased in [**Month (only) 404**].  It is unclear why she
also had a respiratory acidosis beyond her usual retention.  It
has been postulated by her outpatient pulmonologist that she may
additionally have a central process decreasing her respiratory
drive and perhaps this may be playing a role.  Given that she
was DNI and also refusing bipap, with stable vital signs
throughout her stay in the unit she was called out to the floor.
On the floor, she remained stable with oxygen saturation at goal
of 89-93% on 2L. She was encouraged to use the incentive
spirometer and was able to maintain her goal O2 sats.
.
The patient's mental status was not at baseline on admission-
with inattention, some word finding difficulties and increased
confusion, although she was oriented x 3.  The ICU team did not
believe that this was secondary to meningitis, as she was
afebrile, had no nuchal rigidity, no headache or photophobia.
The patient refused LP and the ICU team did not give her
prophylactic antibiotics for meningitis.  EEG by neuro in the ER
showed diffuse encephalopathy, which may be consistent with
other metabolic abnormalities or infection.  An MRI/MRA (limited
study) done to rule out acute stroke and head CT were negative.
The pt was continued on her outpatient dilantin and her mental
status gradually trended toward baseline. She was not having
inattention or confusion at the time of discharge.
.
She came in appearing quite dehydrated in the setting of several
days of diarrhea. It was thought that this was likely a viral
gastroenteritis that had been noted at her rehab facility.  The
pt was hydrated. While on the floor she was kept NPO to prevent
aspiration. Her mental status gradually improved and she was
able to tolerate a PO diet at the time of discharge.
.
The pt completed her course of levofloxacin (which she was on as
an outpatient) for recently diagnosed RLL pneumonia.  She
presented with acute renal failure and was hydrated with IVF
with resolution of acute renal failure.
.
The pt was noted to have difficulty swallowing and there was
concern for aspiration so she was made NPO and given IV
medications. She underwent a PICC placement on [**2122-3-18**]. As her
mental status was significantly improved, she underwent a repeat
speech and swallow evaluation and was able to pass the test. She
was able to tolerate a PO diet at the time of discharge.
.
She reported a single episode of fleeting chest pain during this
hospitalization, during which she had no EKG changes and no
elevation of cardiac enzymes.
