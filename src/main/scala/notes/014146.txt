Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Codeine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
OSH MICU transfer

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Bronchoscopy
PICC line placement
Enteroscopy with biopsy


History of Present Illness:
59 F transfer from [**Hospital3 3583**] with partial SBO and
hypotension.
.
On [**4-21**], she presented to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 46**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with nausea, vomiting, and
diarrhea x 2 days. That evening, she acutely became hypoxic.
While undergoing a CT-PA to r/o PE, went into respiratory
distress necessitating intubation and mechanical ventilation.
She was fluid rescusitated and started on vasopressin and
dopamine. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
Laboratory data at [**Hospital1 46**] were significant for hyponatremia with
Na 120, renal insufficiency with cr 2.2, Trop-I 0.28[nl 0-0.04,
pos > 0.40], and CK 339. Of note, she did not have leukocytosis
(WBC 6.9 with 81% polys). A CT scan (details below) was
consistent with a partial SBO.
.
Of note, the patient had previously been hospitalized at [**Hospital1 3325**] in [**2140-12-9**] with cholecystitis. She had an NSTEMI
during that admission and was transferred to [**Hospital 15629**] for
catheterization which showed 3 vessel disease. She was initially
planned to undergo CABG, but intubation was complicated by
airway perforation, left pneumothorax, and cardiopulmonary
arrest (hypoxia and bradycardia). CABG was cancelled. She
subsequently came to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2141-1-9**] for flexible bronchoscopy
with debridement of necrotic tissue. A TTE at that time showed
an overall normal EF with no wall motion abnormalities. Decision
was made to pursue CABG as elective procedure at a later date.

Radiographic Studies:
CXR ([**Hospital1 46**] [**2141-4-22**] 08:31):
Tip of the endotracheal tube is at the level of the sternal
notch. Central catheter tip is at the junction of the superior
vena cava and right atrium. No active cardiopulmonary disease.
Slightly elevated right diaphragm. No change has occurred since
[**2141-4-21**] at 2113 hours.
.
Head CT w/o contrast ([**Hospital1 46**] [**2140-4-21**] 18:06):
No intracranial abnormality. Left scalp hematoma.
.
CT Abd/Pelvis w/o contrast ([**Hospital1 46**] [**2141-4-21**]):
1) Small bowel dilatation consistent with partial small bowel
obstruction. Limited study secondary to patient obesity.
2) Cholelithiasis.
3) Coronary artery calcification.
4) Subcarinal adenopathy or mass appreciated in the lower
thoracic images.
5) Vague patchy density seen at both lung bases of questionable
significance and this may be acute or chronic.
.
ECG ([**2141-4-22**] 20:33):
Sinus tach @ 109, nl axis & intervals; no voltage; flat Ts in
limb leads, overall unchanged from OSH ECG @07:43
.
[**4-23**] CT ABD: 1. Dilated loops of small bowel within the mid
abdomen, with associated multifocal bowel wall thickening and
mesenteric fluid. These findings are most consistent with
mesenteric ischemia. Although small bowel obstruction is a
possible consideration, it is less likely given the presence of
normal appearing colon.
2. Mildly dilated gallbladder with dependent hyperdense material
likely representing sludge. There is no secondary evidence to
suggest cholecystitis.
3. Small amount of perihepatic fluid.
.
Abd US [**4-24**]: The gallbladder was not visualized due to patient's
body habitus and inability to cooperate with the study.
Appropriate hepatopedal flow is demonstrated in the main portal
vein. There
is no hydronephrosis in the right kidney.
.
[**4-25**] HIDA SCAN- Imaging findings most suggestive of chronic
cholecystitis, and hepatocellular dysfunction
.

[**5-3**] MRI/A Abdomen
FINDINGS: The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber. The origins
of the celiac artery and SMA appear widely patent. There are two
right renal arteries, and at least one left renal artery, which
are also widely patent. There may be an accessory artery
supplying the lower pole of the left kidney. The [**Female First Name (un) 899**] is patent.
There may be an equivocal area of narrowing just distal to the
origin of the inferior mesenteric artery with potential
post-stenotic dilatation. No filling defects are seen within
main vessels and proximal branches. Assessment of extremely
distal vessels is limited due to small size.
There are innumerable gallstones within the gallbladder. There
is no free fluid in the abdomen. There is no overt bowel
obstruction, hydronephrosis or abnormality in either adrenal
gland. The liver and spleen are incompletely imaged.
Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformatted images were essential in
evaluating the mesenteric vasculature.
IMPRESSION:
1. Patent celiac artery, SMA, and [**Female First Name (un) 899**]. Equivocal mild narrowing
of the proximal inferior mesenteric artery.   2. Cholelithiasis
without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
.
[**5-2**]: Small Bowel Follow Through
SMALL BOWEL FOLLOW-THROUGH: Barium passes freely through the
small bowel, entering the colon within one hour. The mid small
bowel demonstrates multisegment areas of submucosal and mucosal
thickening with one segment of slight luminal narrowing and fold
effacement. No ulceration or nodularity.The terminal ileum is
unremarkable. No fixed strictures, obstruction or fistulae.
FINDINGS: Multisegment areas of submucosal and mucosal
thickening with a segment of apparent fold effacement.
Appearances are not typical for Crohns disease.
Ischemia/vasculitis would be included in the differential
diagnosis.  Correlate clinically.
