Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2009**]
Chief Complaint:
hemoptysis


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 75 yo F with h/o CAD s/p CABG, COPD, GERD, IBS,
DM who is transferred from [**Hospital3 2737**] with endobronchial
mass and hemoptysis for possibility of lymph node biopsy by IP.
She initially presnted this past Juanuary with dyspnea. This did
not improve to two courses of antibiotics. A CXR ordered by her
PCP showed [**Name Initial (PRE) **] cavitary lesion confirmed on CT. She also developed
hemoptysis. She went for bronch today which showed: airway
erythema of the left main bronchus, evidence of tumor in the
left upper and left lower lobe bronchi. The tumor was friable
and bled readily. Brushings and endobronchial biopsies were
obtained. Hemostasis was achieved with epi. She was maintianted
intubated on the vent and transferred here for further
evaluation and possible transbronchial lymph node biopsy.

3. Imaging/diagnostics:
- CXR ([**2121-4-25**]): The heart size is enlarged. The patient is after
median sternotomy, most likely due to CABG. In the left lung,
there is a cavitary lesion approximately 5.5 cm in diameter.
There is significant central lucency and relatively thin walls
up to 9 mm in diameter, representing aknown neoplasm as per
outside CT report (discusssed with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 63576**]) . The cavity
appears at the level of the left hilus. It is unclear if
connected or not connected to the left hilus. There is faint
opacity in the right lower lung that might represent developing
infectious process. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.
.
- CXR ([**2121-4-27**]): Bibasilar opacities consistent with a
combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion left greater
than right have worsened. Cardiomegaly is stable.  Patient has
been extubated. Cavitary lesion in the left lung with
significant central lucency and thin walls representing neoplasm
as per outside CT report is unchanged. The mass measures up to
5.4 cm and the peripheral rim is also unchanged at 9 mm.
Mediastinal wires are aligned. There is mild vascular
congestion.
.
- Bronchoscopy ([**2121-4-26**]):
Left main carina very abnormal friable mucosa, elecrocautary
used to acheive hemostasis and EBUS used to FNA station 7 4R and
left hilar mass, as well as BAL of LUL sent for micro. Otherwise
normal to tracheobronchial tree.
.
Pending results on discharge (to be followed by inpatient
provider and outpatient pulmonologist)
- Sputum culture ([**2121-4-26**])
- Bronchoalveolar lavage ([**2121-4-26**])
- Blood culture ([**2121-4-26**])
- Endobronchial mass biopsy ([**2032-4-25**])


Brief Hospital Course:
75 yo F with endobronchial mass and hemoptysis, intubated for
airway protection and transferred for further evaluation,
possible LN biopsy.

# Hemoptysis/Endobronchial Mass - Hemoptysi most likely
secondary to endobronchial mass in proximate left upper and left
lower lobe bronchi.  She arrived intubated for airway protection
given friability of masses on bronch at OSH.  On hospital day 2,
she underwent bronchoscopy that showed left main carina very
abnormal friable mucosa, elecrocautary used to acheive
hemostasis and EBUS used to FNA station 7 4R and left hilar
mass, as well as BAL of LUL sent for micro, otherwise normal to
tracheobronchial tree.  She was extubated and admitted to the
MICU for observation.  She had no further hemoptysis, dyspnea or
hypoxia.  Possible diagnosis of cancer was discussed with
patient. She will follow-up in thoracic oncology clinic, to be
arranged by interventional pulmonologyt fellow.
.
# Hypotension - Patient was noted to be hypotensive with SBP
80's on night after bronchoscopy.  She recieved IVF as well as 2
units PRBCs for drop in HCT (appropriate increase in HCT on
check after transfusion).  Blood pressure improved/  Initial
concern for possible sepsis given UA that showed evidence of UTI
and she was started on antibiotics.  Additionally started
vancomycin due to bronch the day prior.  She remained
hemodynamically stable, HCT stable. Vancomycin was stopped prior
to discharge.
.
# Hyponatremia: Na 130 on admission. Etiology likely hypovolemic
hyponatremia, resolved with IVF and was 135 on discharge.
.
# Urinary Tract Infection - UA positive for UTI, initially
started on Cefepime for concern of sepsis.  Due to fact that
hyoptension normalized with minimal intervention and patient
clinically looked well, tapered antibiotic to PO Cipro.
.
#.  CAD, s/p CABG [**2099**] - Held aspirin, metoprolol, statin,
valsartan, imdur, and lasix given hemoptysis on admission.
Restarted on metoprolol prior to discharge.
.
# GERD: placed on PPI while NPO.
.
# Hypothyroid - continued levothyroxine
.
# Diabetes - While inpatient, held oral hypoglycemics,  placed
on humalog insulin sliding scale.
.
# COPD - Continued ipratropium MDI.
.
Pending results on discharge (to be followed by inpatient
provider and outpatient pulmonologist)
- Sputum culture ([**2121-4-26**])
- Bronchoalveolar lavage ([**2121-4-26**])
- Blood culture ([**2121-4-26**])
- Endobronchial mass biopsy ([**2032-4-25**])
