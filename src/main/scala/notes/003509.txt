AD[**Last Name (STitle) **]N HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 57 year old
gentleman with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and
asbestosis who was diagnosed with an acute myocardial
infarction at [**Hospital3 **] Hospital on [**2131-3-29**]. He was
diagnosed after initially having about a one week history of
intermittent fatigue and malaise, with one episode of chest
pain and dyspnea. When he arrived to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] hospital,
he was found to have elevated cardiac enzymes and EKG changes
consistent with an inferior wall myocardial infarction. He
was taken urgently to the cardiac catheterization laboratory,
where he was found to have a thrombotic lesion of
approximately 99 percent of the right coronary artery.
Stenting was attempted, with placement of several stents,
but, again, there was not good restoration of blood flow or
return of good cardiac function. It was therefore felt that
the patient would need a ventricular assist device for any
chance at survival, and he was therefore emergently life-
flighted to the [**Hospital1 69**] after a
consultation with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] of Cardiac
Surgery. He arrived to the [**Hospital1 188**] on [**2131-3-31**] at approximately 2 p.m. and was
taken directly from the helipad to the operating room.

On arrival to the operating room, the patient was extremely
pale and cool. He was noted on his telemetry strip to be in
cardiac arrest and had in fact possibly had some episodes of
possible cardiac arrest en route. He had been on large doses
of epinephrine, bicarbonate, isoproterenol and dobutamine,
with an aortic balloon pump in place. As noted, his cardiac
rhythm was irregular. His lungs were coarse. His abdomen was
distended, and his right lower extremity was quite cool and
pale. Upon arrival to the operating room, the patient was
placed on cardiopulmonary bypass within four minutes, and
operation was undertaken.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Due to the patient's cardiogenic shock, he
underwent placement of right and left ventricular assist
devices, along with closure of a patent foramen ovale. His
femoral arteries were actually repaired bilaterally by the
vascular surgery service (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **]) secondary to
bilateral lower extremity ischemia which was evident on
initial examination. The cardiopulmonary bypass time was 180
minutes. There was no cross clamp time. The patient was
transferred to the intensive care unit on Levophed,
vasopressin and insulin. Upon arrival in the CSRU, as noted,
the patient was quite hypoxic, and he was placed on ECMO
oxygenation circuit. During placement of the cannulas, it was
noted that the patient may have had some increased degree of
vascular insufficiency in his leg, as cannula placement was
quite difficult. The vascular surgery service was again
consulted, and they emergently re-explored the right groin
and repaired his femoral artery, which was bleeding. Even
after placement on the ECMO circuit, we had significant
difficulty oxygenating the patient secondary to massive
amounts of pulmonary edema, which manifested as copious
frothy liquid emanating from the endotracheal tube. We
evacuated approximately 3 to 4 liters of liquid from the
endotracheal tube. In an effort to reduce the patient's
volume overload, we placed him on continuous [**Last Name (un) **]-[**Last Name (un) **]
hemodialysis after consultation with the nephrology service.
None of these efforts allowed us to improve his oxygenation
status. His ventricular assist device continued to maintain
an adequate cardiac output, but there was growing concern of
cerebral hypoxia in the setting of his diminished oxygen
saturation. We continued our efforts, along with massive
blood product transfusion, up until 0300 on [**2131-4-1**].
Notably, we attempted using IV steroids to improve his
pulmonary status, but this did not improve this situation at
all. As there was no improvement in his clinical status at
this time, after discussion with the family and the attending
surgeon, it was felt that resuscitative efforts should be
withdrawn. He was pronounced dead on [**2131-4-1**] at 0300.
The family was present. The patient's daughters were present
at the time of expiration. The patient's primary care
physician was [**Name (NI) 653**], and a message was left with the
answering service. The patient's spouse was [**Name (NI) 653**]
directly.

RELEVANT LAB VALUES:  The patient was quite acidotic
throughout the course of his hospitalization, with pH's which
has dropped to as low as 6.85, with a maximum of no more than
7.20. This was a combination of a respiratory and a metabolic
acidosis, which we attempted to correct with manipulation of
his ventilator and the ECMO circuit, along with the
administration of bicarbonate, with little success. His
hematocrit ranged between the 20-30's, and he had required
massive amounts of blood transfusion. He was quite
coagulopathic, with INR above 2, requiring multiple
transfusions of fresh frozen plasma.
