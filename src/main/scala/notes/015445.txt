Allergies:
Morphine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6114**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p Fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p right hip ORIF
s/p intubation

History of Present Illness:
   75yo F with CAD s/p MI x4 (s/p LAD stent '[**96**] and RCA stentx2
in '[**98**] and '[**02**]), CHF with EF 55%, PAF, Inducible Vtach s/p AICD
placement, sick sinus syndrome s/p pacer and COPD with
restrictive lung disease.  Per daughter, pt was in her USOH
until two days prior to admission when she was noted to have a
superficial ulcerations on her foot with erythema.  Pt was taken
to [**Location (un) 511**] [**Hospital 11461**] Hospital and started on unasyn IV.  Pt
awoke later that night and felt unsteady on her feet and
sustained a mechanical fall.  Per daughter, pt did not note
chest pain, tachycardia, had a good PO intake and no noted
seizure activity.  Pt was in severe "back pain" as per daughter
which was treated with dilaudid.  CT of the neck revealed a
possible C1 fracture and the X-ray at the OSH revealed
intratrochanteric fracture of the right femur.  Pt was
subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for orthopaedic evaluation.
   In ED at [**Hospital1 18**], pt was seen by the Trauma service where a CT
of the neck revealed no fracture (however, the c-collar was
maintained secondary to pain).  The orthopaedic service
recommended emergent repair of the intratrochanteric fracture
secondary to instability.  The ED stay was complicated by runs
of afib to 133 requiring IV lopressor.
.
ROS: Pt is very SOB at baseline, not on home ox, no CP at rest,
no LE edema, no PND, stable orthopnea (2 pillows).  Pt ambulates
10 feet with significant fatigue as per daughter.  (?[**Month (only) **] in
exercise tolerance).  Med change include discontinuation of
coumadin secondary to inc risk of upper GI bleed.  Digoxin,
Norvasc and Imdur was also discontinued.
.

HPI:  75 yoF with CAD s/p stenting, VT, SSS s/p pacer, COPD,
presented to OSH [**2104-2-18**] with foot ulceration.  Started on
unasyn, in hospital suffered mech. fall with hip fx.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2-19**].  Medically eval not high risk
surgery, preop beta blocker given.
.
ORIF with repair of neck fracture [**2104-2-20**].  Expected prolonged
extubation course given COPD history, as with colon CA resection
surgery.  In PM extubated, transferred to floor [**2104-2-20**].
.
Late [**2-20**] found with afib and RVR, given beta blocker with min.
response, started dilt. drip.  Received 2 mg dilaudid for pain
o/n.
.
This AM with respiratory failure, continued tachycardia on dilt.
gtt.  Transferred to unit and urgently intubated (labs below.)
.
Of note, a NGT by Xray was not in correct position ?lungs ->
possibly used for medication administration this AM.

fracture of C1 is identified to correlate with the history of
questioned C1 fracture from outside hospital.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 75yo F s/p MIx4, numerous cath, PAF, Inducible VTach s/p
AICD and pacer with severe COPD/restrictive lung disease s/p
fall with intertrochanteric fracture.  As per ortho, pt requires
emergent repair of intertrochanteric fracture to preserve
neurovascular function.  Pt is a moderate risk for a needed
emergent non-cardiac procedure.  Pt is medically cleared for
procedure , likely has some mile rate related ischemia.
.
1.  Cards:
---Pre-op B-blocker with goal HR <70
---No real utility in MIBI/cath prior to procedure gien previous
caths with no significant lesions to be intervened on.
---V-Tach: pt has AICD in place, however b-blocker should
contorl Vtach for now.
---B-blocker IV, Dilt PRN for PAF
---Hold coumadin for afib given hx of upper GIB and surgery in
AM
---Continue ASA, plavix
---ROMI, check AM ECG
.
2.  COPD/Restrictive lung disease:
---Nebs/MDI PRN
---no need for steroids now
---expect prolonged wean given previous history of prolonged
wean s/p colonic resection
---incentive spirometry for atelectasis
.
3.  Hip fracture:
---pain control with diluadid, tylenol
---lovenox tonight x1, hold AM dose per ortho
---Pt to OR in early AM
.
4.  Anemia:
---iron studies
---TSH
---no need fortransfusion currently, keep Hct >30
.
5.  Hypokalemia:
---60IV K now
---continue PO K
---check lytes in PM
.
6.  Cellulitis:
---continue unasyn
---hold off on X-rays for now
.
7.  DM:
---RISS - tight glucose control pre-op
.
8.  [**Month/Day/Year 5**]:
---Protonix, Lovenox, R boot as per ortho
.
9.  Diet: NPO
.
10.  Code: Full --> DNR/DNI
.
MICU course:

ORIF with repair of neck fracture [**2104-2-20**]. Had expected
prolonged post-op extubation in PACU given COPD history, as with
colon CA resection surgery. In PM extubated, transferred to
floor [**2104-2-20**].
.
Late [**2-20**] found with afib and RVR, given beta blocker with min.
response, started dilt. drip. Received 2 mg dilaudid for pain
o/n.
.
On [**2-21**] AM p/w with respiratory failure, continued tachycardia
on dilt. gtt. Transferred to unit and urgently intubated.
.
Of note, there was a question of misplaced NGT. When NGT tube
was pulled out, it was noted to have respiratory-like
secretions. Concern for aspiration of mediations to lungs.
