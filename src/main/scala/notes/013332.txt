Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain and shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 84 year old woman
with CAD status post CABG, admitted recently to an outside
hospital with what appeared to be worsening dyspnea on
exertion.  She was admitted with unstable angina, complaining
of chest pain at rest, dyspnea on exertion, nausea, vomiting.
All these symptoms lasted about 24 hours.  She had a mild
troponin leak at about 0.5 at the outside hospital.  Symptoms
improved with sublingual nitroglycerin.

She had an echo at the outside hospital which showed
depressed LV function with EF of about 30% and new T wave and
apex abnormalities.  She was started on a nesiritide drip, IV
nitroglycerin and IV heparin.  Several days later she had a
new syncopal episode and was found to be in junctional rhythm
with ventricular response of about 70.  At the same time she
had guaiac positive stools.  Therefore, IV heparin was
discontinued and she was started on dobutamine.  She was also
apparently transfused.  At that time her creatinine went up
to 3.3 from a baseline of about 2.5.  She received Mucomyst
and was transferred here for cardiac cath.

Cardiac cath revealed left main coronary artery which
appeared okay.  LAD had subtotal occlusion.  OM1 had 80% to
90% stenosis and was stented times two.  RCA was patent.
LIMA to LAD was patent.  SVG graft was occluded.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient is status post CABG in
[**2130-10-27**].  She had LIMA to LAD, SVG to left circumflex,
SVG to PDA, SVG to PLB.  She also has a history of left
bundle branch block, hypertension, atrial fibrillation and
right sided CEA in [**2129**].  Hypercholesterolemia.
Hypothyroidism.  Chronic renal failure with baseline
creatinine between 2.2 and 2.8.  Anemia.  GERD.  Status post
TAH.  Status post cholecystectomy.

MEDICATIONS:  Prevacid 30 p.o. q.d., Pletal 100 p.o. b.i.d.,
multivitamin, Colace, Lopressor 25 p.o. t.i.d., aspirin 325
p.o. q.d., Plavix started recently, calcium carbonate 100
q.d., Tricor 160 q.d., Epogen 4000 q.weekly.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother with hypertension.  Sister with some
arrhythmia.  Brother with [**Name (NI) 5895**].

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Widowed for many years.  She has three
children.  She has never smoked.  Does not currently use
alcohol.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.8, pulse 50, blood
pressure 170/70, sating 96 on 4 liters.  Comfortable, in no
acute distress.  Pupils equal and reactive to light.  Mucous
membranes moist.  JVP is around 7 cm.  No carotid bruits.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular
S1, S2, with a [**3-4**] very soft ejection murmur in the left
upper sternal border.  Abdomen soft, nondistended, nontender
with normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities showed 2+ pulses
and no edema.  Groin wound had no hematoma or bruit.

LABORATORY DATA:  Initial labs were significant for
creatinine of 2.9, BUN 41.  The rest of the chem-7 and CBC
were normal.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiovascular.  During cardiac catheterization initial
increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressures were found.
Therefore, patient was transferred to the CCU for close
monitoring.  She received two doses of IV Lasix from which
she had good urine output and her pulmonary wedge decreased.
Patient also carries a somewhat ambiguous diagnosis of renal
artery stenosis.  She has never had a previous study to
document that, but there has been a question whether she
might have the condition.  Therefore, we tried to monitor her
blood pressure very closely with a goal between 130 to 140.

She remained completely asymptomatic from the coronary
standpoint with no episodes of chest pain, no further EKG
changes whatsoever.  She had no evidence of congestive heart
failure after initial diuresis and she remained completely
asymptomatic from that standpoint.  She was transferred to
the floor after about 24 hours in the coronary care unit.
She was started on aspirin, Plavix, beta blocker.

She was not a candidate for ACE given her renal function.
Her blood pressure was usually well controlled, requiring
occasional doses of nitrates and hydralazine.  Her blood
pressure goal was about 130 to 140 given her renal artery
stenosis.

She had a repeat echo which showed severe global left
ventricular hypertrophy with severely depressed EF.  There
was mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.  The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggested impaired relaxation.

2.  Renal.  The patient has baseline chronic renal failure of
unclear etiology.  About 48 hours after the initiation of
contrast, patient developed acute renal failure with
creatinine peaking at about 4.4.  A consultation with the
renal service was obtained and the opinion was that this was
probably contrast induced nephrotoxicity.  Her FEna was
greater than 2.0 and there is no suggestion that this is
pre-renal in etiology.  After close monitoring her creatinine
started trending down from a high of 4.4 down to 3.6.  Given
that creatinine was now decreasing, we felt comfortable that
patient could be discharged and followed up closely.

3.  ID.  The patient came in with apparent Enterococcus
infection at the outside hospital.  She received amoxicillin
p.o. t.i.d. here for that condition.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to home.

FOLLOWUP:  The patient will follow up with PCP who will set
her up with a nephrologist in her area, given that she lives
more than an hour away from [**Location (un) 86**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post cardiac cath with two stents.
2.  Acute on chronic renal failure.
3.  Enterococcus UTI.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 p.o. q.d. indefinitely.
2.  Plavix p.o. q.d. indefinitely.
3.  Lopressor 25 t.i.d.
4.  Prevacid 30 mg q.d.
5.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Calcium carbonate 1000 mg p.o. q.d.
