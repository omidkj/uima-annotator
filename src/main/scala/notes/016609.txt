Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with drug eluting stent to the left
circumflex coronary artery


History of Present Illness:
Patient states that yesterday he was mowing his lawn when he
developed sharp substernal chest pain and pressure. He stopped
working sat down and had resolution of his pain within 15
minutes. He then completed the mowing without any further pain.
Later that evening he went to a bar and had [**1-30**] drinks without
any more pain. Around 1 am the patient was awoken with
significant substernal chest pain radiant to his right arm and
felt like "someone was sitting on his chest". He took several
tums without any improvement and had an episode of vomitting
while at home. He finally called an ambulance and was taken to
the ED at 530 am.
.
In the ER, Initial VS were HR: 52 BP: 120/48 Resp: 12 O(2)Sat:
100. EKG showed: ST elevations in II, II avF, V3-V6, and ST
depressions in V1-V2. He received asa, heparin, a plavix load,
and was sent emergently for cardiac catheterization. Cardiac
cath showed two lesions: 100% prox LCx before obtuse marginal,
90% distal RCA. He had an export thrombectomy from LCx and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) **] was placed. He was also hypotensive periprocedurally to
80s systolic and transiently bradycardic. Paitent recived a
fluid bolus and atropine and was started on a dopamine gtt. He
also had R heart cath which showed PCWP 25. L venous sheath is
still in place.
.
Upon arrival to the CCU patient was stable and alert with a BP
126/84 MAP 93 on 10 of dopamine, P 79, 95% on 4L. Patient
complained of nausea and had several episodes of vomitting. He
endorsed slight [**1-8**] retrosternal chest pain, greatly improved
from presentation. Denied any SOB, HA, abdominal pain.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Cardiac cath [**8-14**]:
COMMENTS:
1) Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system
demonstrated two-vessel coronary disease.  The LAD had no
significant
disease.  The LCx had 100% proximal stenosis and 70% mid-vessel
stenosis, both of which had thrombus.  The RCA had 50%
mid-vessel
stenosis and 90% distal stenosis in a small dominant vessel.
3) Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderately-elevated
left-sided
pressures, with a mean PCWP of 26 mmHg; V waves were high at 44
mmHg,
suggesting the possibility of mitral regurgitation.  The PA
pressures
were moderately-elevated at 51/19 mmHg, with a mean PA pressure
of 34
mmHg.  The right atrial pressure was normal at 8 mmHg.
4) The patient developed hypotension (sBPs low 80s)
periprocedurally;
this may have been due to a vasovagal effect compounded by
hypovolemia
in the setting of an inferolateral MI.  Dopamine at 10mcg/kg/min
was
begun with good effect on the blood pressures.  He also received
one
0.6mg dose of atropine for transient bradycardia into the low
40s.
5) Angiomax was used and angioseal for arteriotomy closure.
6) Successful export thrombectomy and PCI of thrombotically
occluded
proximal LCx with 2.5x28mm Promus [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 7930**] to 3.0mm (see
PTCA
comments).
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease, status post export
thrombectomy
followed by drug-eluting stenting of the proximal and mid-LCx.
The RCA
was not well suited for PCI because of its small caliber.
2. Acute inferior myocardial infarction, managed by acute PTCA
of
vessel.
3. Moderate left-sided filling pressures.
4. Bradycardia controlled with dopamine.
5. Successful export thrombectomy and PCI of LCx.

ECHO [**8-14**]:
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe
hypokinesis of the distal half of the inferior wall and apex.
The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 50-55 %). The
estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional
systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Mild mitral regurgitation. Dilated
thoracic aorta.

ECG [**8-15**]:
Sinus rhythm. Slight ST segment elevation in leads II and V4-V6
with biphasic T waves in leads V5-V6 and Q waves in the inferior
leads and V6 suggesting an evolution of an inferolateral
