Chief Complaint:
CHF Exacerbation, hip dislocation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
R hip revision [**2163-5-6**]


History of Present Illness:
83yo F w/ severe MS, diastolic CHF (EF 65-70%), history of AF
(not on coumadin), who was admitted to [**Hospital3 417**] on [**2163-4-14**]
with CHF exacerbation. While in-house she dislocated her right
hip; this has been a recurrent problem since her hip replacement
in [**2138**]. First in 94, then in [**Month (only) 216**], [**12-4**] and and most
recently in [**3-7**], which occurs when she is bendind down to
reach for something. During the recent admission she was in bed
shifting upward and felt the hip [**Doctor Last Name **] out. The hip was reduced
and a hip brace/binder was applied; [**Doctor Last Name **] was consulted and
recommended surgery to repair the hip to prevent recurrent
dislocation but felt that given her high cardiac risk the
operation should be performed at a tertiary care center. Per
referring physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] team at [**Hospital3 **] discussed with [**Hospital3 **]
at [**Hospital1 18**] who agreed to do case here after her cardiac status has
been optimized. She is currently improving on IV Lasix (80mg
daily) and is hemodynamically stable. Creatinine stable at
1.4-1.5. Has chronic pleural effusions, thoracics at [**Hospital3 **]
tapped today and per patient removed about 1L.
.
Currently she does not have any SOB. Occasionally she uses 2L at
home when she becomes severly SOB did not need it in the last
few days. She has some aching from the site of the thoracentesis
[**2164-2-29**], and is constipated - minor bowel movement today though.
Also does not have a good appetite and lost 50lbs over the last
year. She thinks her mood is good though

Brief Hospital Course:
83yo F w/ severe MS, diastolic CHF (EF 65-70%), history of AF
(not on coumadin), who was admitted to [**Hospital3 417**] on [**2163-4-14**]
with CHF exacerbation and now transferred for R hip revision
after total hip replacement. Discharged on POD#8

# Right hip revision, s/p THR '[**38**]- Pt was transferred here from
Good Samaritin. Prior to considering the procedure pt's dCHF and
afib were medically optimized. A R hip aspirate was done to r/o
infection prior to surgery which showed no microorganisms.
Cardiology cleared the patient as did Anesthesia, but Anesthesia
did note that she would be high risk for surgery. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5322**]
agreed to surgery and occured on [**2163-5-6**]. Operatively the
surgery went well. [**Name (NI) **] pt was in the SICU from [**Date range (1) 15356**].
She was hypotensive and was on pressors for 2 days. There she
also received 2units PRBC. After returning to the floor pt
continues to improve with PT, has been normotensive for days,
and did not need any further blood transfusion as her Hct has
been stable 26 and our transfusion criteria was < 25 per [**Date range (1) **].
Pt is [**Name (NI) **] full weight bearing, and RLE partial weight bearing
and must wear brace when OOB. PT cleared pt for rehab today.


# Diastolic CHF- w/ EF>55%, severe mitral regirg - Pt was nearly
euvolemic when she arrived and remained that way throughout
admission. Cardiology was consulted and recommended to titrate
her heart rate to 60, and she will be close to it on her home
dose on metop XL 50. Post-operatively while on the floor she had
some increased pleural effusions and her lasix was increased to
60mg [**Hospital1 **] for 3 days. Now she is being discharged on her home
dose of 40mg [**Hospital1 **].

# [**Name (NI) 80072**] Afib - Pt remained rate controlled throughout
admission. When cardiology was consulted the recommended to stop
the sotalol that was started at the OSH and restart her
amiodiorone as they did not believe pt was having toxicity from
the amiodrione. They also recommended to restart warfarin for
long-term management. [**Name (NI) **] pt has been on lovenox,
and will continue this for 1mo or until Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5322**] [**Name (STitle) 80073**].
Afterward Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], her cardiologist should readdress this issue
when she follows up since she will still be on lovenox. Asprin
81mg was also started per cardiology recomendations

# Severe mitral stenois- eval by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in past, and not
canidate for surgery due to significant calcification.


# Severe pulmonary HTN- not on PDE inhibitor, give 02, and avoid
overdiuresis as pt needs preload to overcome pulm HTN


# Hyperthyroidism- stable, asymptomatic on home synthroid


# Anemia- Hct remained stable. Patient has received 2 units of
PRBCs as above.
