Chief Complaint:
Found down

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

Tracheostomy ([**2154-5-13**])
PEG Tube ([**2154-5-13**])

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo female with CAD s/p MI, pulmonary HTN, HTN, who found down
in her house after a few weeks of fatigue and weakness 9 days
ago. Per neuro note in talking with the son, over the last month
the patient had weakness, fatigue, and was too weak to go up
stairs.

She went to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] where she was found to be hyponatremic
(128), have a CK of 2500, MB 99 (MBI 3.9) and troponin T of .12.
BNP was >6000. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] ED. EKG showed LVH
with lat/inf ST depressions as well as evidence of left main
disease. And ABG was 7.19/79/191 on NRB. She was intubated at
that time and required levophed which was weaned off. A cortisol
stimulation test did not bump appropriately and she was started
on hydrocortisone/ fludrocortisone. Troponin peaked at 1.61. Pt
was extubated on [**2154-4-28**] and was on BIPAP intermittently. She
was reintubated on [**2154-4-30**] for hypercarbia in setting of mental
status changes, and hypoventilation. Neurology was then
consulted for question of central etiology for respiratory
failure. Patient is being transferred to the MICU team for
further work up of respiratory status.

EKG demonstrated a normal sinus rhythm with normal axis and
intervals. Possible LAE. Scooped ST depressions noted in I, II,
F, V4-V6 with elevations in R and V1.

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**2154-4-24**])
The estimated right atrial pressure is >20 mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is
an echo-lucency (3mm) seen in tha basal infero-septum and
inferior wall that is suggestive of a small diverticulum (there
is no color flow to suggest a small VSD or intra-myocardial
coronary bridge but thesse cannot be excluded). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. 1+ MR.

CXR ([**2154-4-23**]):
Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right. Left
retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis, underlying
infiltrate cannot be entirely excluded.

CT CHEST/ABD/PELVIS ([**2154-4-23**]):
There is a 4.9 x 3.3 cm heterogeneous mass in the right lobe of
the thyroid gland causing some displacement of the esophagus and
the trachea across the midline. Small right pleural effusion
noted. No evidence of pulmonary emboli. No evidence for
dissection of the aorta. Atherosclerotic changes are noted
throughout the aorta. Lung windows show some patchy scattered
nodular infiltrates which may represent infectious process or
atelectasis. Band like atelectasis is also noted in the right
middle lobe.

There is a 1.7 x 1.5 cm nodule in the left adrenal gland. No
focal lesions are seen in the liver, spleen, or the pancreas.
Normal gallbladder. No gallstones. Tiny cyst at the upper pole
of the right kidney. Kidneys are otherwise normal, no
hydronephrosis.

Oral contrast was not used for this study limiting evaluation of
bowel loops but no gross abnormalities are seen. A 4 cm densely
calcified fibroid noted in relation to the uterus. Foley
catheter is lying in an empty urinary bladder, its tip projects
laterally but likely lies within the bladder ..... extension.
Clinically I'm told, clear urine has been obtained. No ascites
is seen.

CT HEAD ([**2154-4-23**]):
There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect,
hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures, or major
vascular territorial infarction. A lacunar infarct is observed
in the left frontal white matter. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white differentiation is
preserved. There is mild ethmoid sinus mucosal thickening. The
right mastoid air cells are slightly underdeveloped.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with CAD found down and now with
neuromuscular weakness and respiratory failure s/p trach.

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure- Pt was reintubated on [**2154-4-30**]
for hypercarbia and tiring out. Post etomidate and intubation
she had flaccid paralysis. She was treated for a possible
aspiration pneumonia for seven days at that time. She does have
underlying pulmonary disease by [**2150**] PFTs however, this was
thought to be secondary to the neurological cause. As her
muscular weakness (see below) was treated, her ability to
initiate breaths and diaphragmatic musculature got better,
initially being on AC without any spontaneous respirations. Pt
was trached and peged on HD 19. She was diuresed with IV and PO
lasix through her stay as she was edematous and anasacic. NIF
were followed and on HD 23 -17, HD 27 -40. She was able to
tolerate trach mask for hours at a time prior to discharge from
hospital.

2. Weakness-  neurology consulted with the team closely. Initial
differential included a neuromuscular problem (junctional)
including myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], [**Location (un) **]-[**Location (un) **], other myopathies,
spinal cord issues. Post intubation (she received etomidate) she
was  very flaccid but tracking. B12, folate were normal. MRI and
MRA of the head showed nothing acute to account for this and MRI
of the c-spine only showed some stenosis. A lumbar puncture was
done under fluroscopy which did not show any cytoalbuminogenic
dissociation, so [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) **] was thought less likely.
EMG on HD 10 showed decreased CMAPs but was sural nerve sparing,
though on the whole non-diagnostic. Repeat EMG on HD 17 was also
non-diagnostic. IVIG was given on HD [**10-14**]. Tensilon test on HD
14 after starting pyridostigmine showed only slight improvement
(could m
