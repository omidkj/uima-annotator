Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 1001**] was admitted to the ICU for full evaluation prior to
undergoing elective tracheostomy and PEG tube placement. She was
taken to the Operating Room on [**2146-2-14**] for the above mentioned
procedures and tolerated it well.  She returned to the ICU
sedated on Propofol and on full mechanical ventilation.

Her vent settings and mode was adjusted on multiple occasions
due to hypercarbia and she alternated between MMV and A/C. Her
most recent ABG revealed a Ph of 7.33 PO2 59
PCO2 90 and HCO3 16.  Her chest Xray this morning was more
opacified on the right side and an bronchoscopy was done which
showed but there was no significant plugging.  A post bronch
cehst xray showed better aeration with the same right effusion.

The Nutrition service recommended replete w/ fiber at a goal of
45 cc/hr w/ 42 Gm beneprotein daily.  These feeding can be
started after she arrives at rehab.

Currently she is on no sedation and is responding to voice and
commands.  She received a dose of Lasix 20 mg this AM for
possible fluid overload in light of her xray and diamox was also
started.

From a surgical standpoint she is doing well.  Her trach flange
sutures can be removed on [**2146-2-24**].  If there are any questions
or concerns regarding the trach or PEG please call Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] at 6[**Telephone/Fax (1) 21905**].
