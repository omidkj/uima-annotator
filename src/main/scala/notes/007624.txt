History of Present Illness:
84 yo [**Location 7979**] speaking male with duodenal adenocarcinoma,
diagnosed in [**5-7**], s/p gastroenterostomy and a diversion around
the duodenal mass with recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] from
[**Date range (3) 31547**] with a PE on lovenox who BIBA to ED for
decreased PO intake and lethargy.  Per family, patient has been
lethargic since 2pm this afternoon.  Patient is not mobile, has
not been out of been in months.  He typically is conversant and
has not been interacting, just making eye contact.  His family
notes that he seems to be getting worse at home since most

ED, he was arousable to loud voice and painful stimuli.  He was
noted to be tachypneic to the 30s and spiked a fever to 103.
CXR was concerning for PNA/effusion.  CT Head was negative for
an acute process.  CTA of the Torso was negative for PE, but did
show large effusion, ? LLL PNA vs collapse, worsening acute
pancreatitis.  Lipase 209 which is stable from previous levels.

Past Medical History:
Oncologic
# duodenal adenocarcinoma:
- [**2164-4-28**]: developed crampy abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,
and jaundice. ERCP revealed a malignant appearing stricture and
also a duodenal mass. He had a plastic stent placed followed by
a
metal stent to relieve the jaundice. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] had discussed
the potential for a Whipple procedure; however, given Mr.
[**Known lastname 12330**]' comorbidities and underlying medical problems and
delirium, he was not deemed a good candidate for Whipple's and
was deemed to be a better candidate for a less invasive
procedure. On [**2164-6-8**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed
gastroenterostomy and a diversion around the duodenal mass,
which
was left in place.
- [**2164-6-27**]: saw Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 11309**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Given his
poor performance status, chemotherapy was not recommended.

[**2164-8-31**] CXR: Large left pleural effusion with retrocardiac left
lung base atelectasis. Superimposed infection cannot be
excluded.
.
[**2164-8-31**] CT Head without contrast: No acute intracranial
hemorrhage detected. Right maxillary sinus disease.

[**2164-8-31**] CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis with contrast:
1. No acute pulmonary embolism or thoracic aortic pathology
detected. Stable mild enlargement of the ascending thoracic
aorta measuring up to 3.9 cm.
2. Moderate-to-large left pleural effusion and associated
compressive
atelectasis of the left lower lobe, new since the prior study.
3. Interval worsening of the patient's known acute pancreatitis
with increase in size of the previously seen peripancreatic
fluid collections. Splenic subscapular simple fluid collection
is new since the prior study.
4. Hypoattenuating lesions within the head of the pancreas may
represent
dilated ducts or small fluid collections.
5. Unchanged thickened appearance of the first and second
portion of the
duodenum in this patient with known duodenal mass. Multiple
omental and
peritoneal nodules remain concerning for carcinomatosis.
6. Stable prostatomegaly.
7. Renal cysts and sigmoid diverticulosis.
.
[**2164-9-1**] ECG: Atrial flutter with ventricular premature beats.
Early precordial QRS transition. Probable left ventricular
hypertrophy. ST-T wave abnormalities. Findings are non-specific.
Since previous tracing of [**2164-8-31**] atrial wave forms now appear
more suggestive of flutter than fibrillation but there may be no
significant change.
.
[**2164-9-2**] CXR: Large left effusion with adjacent atelectasis has
markedly increased.  Cardiomediastinum is midline. Moderate
cardiomegaly is stable. Right lower atelectasis is unchanged.
The cardiomediastinal silhouette is partially obscured by the
left pleural effusion.
