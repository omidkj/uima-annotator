pneumonitis as well as in the ED she responded to minimal
interventions including a small fluid boluses, IV dex and
antibiotics.  However, pt had a single cortisol
result(29.4)within normal levels.  No evidence sepsis: lactate
3.4 but trended down to 1.8 w/HD, Abx were held; ruled out MI-
three sets of cardiac enzymes:(0.12,0.11,0.11); TTE [**2-17**]:
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2111-2-6**],
findings are similar except that the effusion is now smaller. In
MICU, periperal dopa was successfully weaned during dialysis and
pt maintained BP's of 110-140.
steroids for two reasons: seemed to improve her condition
dramatically in ED, assume partial adrenal insufficiency;
asthma/ CPOD exacerbation that is helped with steroids.
