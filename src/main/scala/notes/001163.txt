[**11-16**] CXR:  Small bilateral pleural effusions, with increased
opacity in the right lung base, may reflect atelectasis.
However, developing consolidation cannot be excluded.

[**11-17**] TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with focal hypokinesis of the mid to distal septum, distal
anterior wall and apex. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %). The remaining left
ventricular segments contract normally. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic
valve stenosis (area 0.5 cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean
gradient 4 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe aortic stenosis. Moderate aortic
regurgitation. Mild functional mitral stenosis from annular
calcification. Mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction consistent with mid LAD disease. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension.



Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with h/o dementia, aortic stenosis,
iron def anemia presented with acute hypoxia, found to have
RLL/RML pneumonia.
.
1. Healthcare associated pneumonia:  Likely cause of the
hypoxia. Pt was initially covered with zosyn and vanco.  Pt was
initially given gentle IVF hydration.  Urine legionella was
negative.  Urine culture was negative.  Blood cultures were

nurse. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 103468**] negative for blood. Hct was 23.9 at admission
and dipped down to 19 after IVF.  Patient was transfused 2 units
PRBCs in the ICU.  For the rest of the patients hospitalization
her Hct remained stable in the mid 20s.  Pt does carry a history
of Fe deficieny anemia.  Iron supplements were continued.  B12
and folate were within normal limits.  The patient is DNR/DNI
and the family does not [**Last Name (un) 21405**] to pursue aggresive interventions
such as EGD/colonoscopy at this time.
.
3. Dementia: Continued memantine, seroquel, exelon and
paroxetine.
.
4. Code:  DNR/DNI
.
5. Dispo:  The patient will be transferred back to [**Hospital 100**] rehab
in stable condition for further care.
