History of Present Illness:
55 yo F with h/o cirrhosis from sarcoidosis p/w to ED
hematemesis x 3 this AM.
.
The patient is a  55 year-old woman with a history of cirrhosis
[**3-15**] sarcoid.  She woke at 11pm the night prior to admission with
nausea, dry heaving and occasional vomiting of a phlegm-like

immediately had her husband drive her to the hospital.  She has
never had bloody emesis, though she has had bloody stool and
black stool in the past.  Currently she has [**7-22**] abdominal pain
that is located in her RLQ.  Her abdomen is more tympanic than
usual, but improved from teh weekend when she noted it was even
more distended. Otherwise confirms chills and then feeling
'warm' but without fever.  On ROS denies any change in stools
pattern ([**11-23**] dailiy [**3-15**] lactulose), dysuria, rash, SOB, CP or
rash).  She's had no sick contacts.

On arrival in ED and HD stable. Initial VS 98.9, 124, 123/74,
16, 98/RA.  Hct 34.7  She reported pain being [**5-22**], primarily in
abdomen.  She was given 2L NS, 1U PRBC and CVL placed.   GI was
consulted in ED, and she was transferred to the ICU for EGD.
Upon transfer, VS afebrile, SBP 130, 90s, RR 12.  She was
additionally given ceftriaxone 1g, PPI and placed on an

CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT Study Date of [**2110-12-9**] 11:48 AM
1. Appropriate positioning of a right internal jugular central
venous
catheter.
2. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
3. Dilated loops of small bowel, and focal gas projecting over
the liver likely in duodenum. CT of abdomen if clinical concern
warrants.
.
ECG: Sinus tachycarida, [**Street Address(2) 29562**] changes
.
EGD [**2110-12-10**]:
Varices at the lower third of the esophagus (ligation). Old
blood was seen in the lumen of the stomach. Varices at the
cardia. Normal mucosa in the duodenum. Old blood was seen.
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum


Brief Hospital Course:
HEMATEMSIS:
The patient was hemodynamically stable without hypotension and
HR in the 90s on presentation.  She was transfused 2 units of
PRBCs.  Diuretics were held.  EGD was done which showed grade II
varices in the lower third of the esophagus with past bleeding
signs which were banded.  She remained hemodynamically stable
and HCT was stable with a nadir of 30.6 which then improved to
33.7.  Octreotide was continued for 12 hours post-procedure as
per recommendations by the liver service.  She was kept on
Ceftriaxone for SBP prophylaxis, and an IV PPI [**Hospital1 **].  She was
given Rifaxamin and Carafate as per liver recommendations.  The
patient had no active bleeding while in the MICU and was
transferred to the floor on hospital day #2.  There she
completed a 3 day course of ceftriaxone, transitioned to PO PPI,
and restarted her home diuretic regimen.  Follow-up endoscopy in
3 weeks was arranged prior to discharge.
.
ABDOMINAL PAIN:
On Hospital day #2, the patient complained of abdominal pain on
the right side.  This was a constant sharp, non-radiating pain,
[**8-21**].  There was no associated nausea or vomitting.  She did
report a decrease in her usual number of bowel movements (none
for 12 hours).   She had an ultrasound and a CT scan of the
abdomen with PO contrast to assess for small bowel obstruction
or ascites.  There was no ascites, but  a likely early or
partial SBO was demonstrated. There was no evidence of ischemia
or pneumatosis.  She was hemodynamically stable.  Given that she
could not have an NG tube place because of her recent endoscopic
procedure, conservative management including NPO, lactulose
enemas, and serial abdominal exams was undertaken.  The surgery
team evaluated her and agreed with this plan.  On the morning of
hospital day #3, the patient again began having bowel movements,
and her pain resolved.  Clear liquids were begun and slowly
advanced to a regular diet, which she tolerated well.
.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:
Creatinine was elevated from baseline of 1.0 to 1.3.  She was
given 2L NS IVF for possible prerenal etiology. Diuretics were
held initially.  Creatinine returned to baseline.  Outpatient
diuretic regiment was restarted.
.
HEPATIC SARCOIDOSIS:
She was noted to be s/p TIPS x 2 with spontaneous clotting of
the TIPS.  She was continued on ursodiol and Prednisone and was
given Benadryl for itching. LFTs were stable, with  baseline
elevated Alkaline phosphatase.  Lactulose was continued and
titrated to 3 BMs/day. No consideration was given to recanalize
the TIPS [**3-15**] prior severe episodes of HE.
.
COUGH:
The patient complained of a cough, runny nose, and sore throat
on hospital day #3.  CXR was negative for pneumonia. A viral
syndrome was considered most likely.
.
HYPOTHYROIDISM
Home dose of levothyroxine was continued
