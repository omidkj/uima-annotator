Data:
.
Echo [**10-3**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the basal half of the
inferior and inferolateral walls, distal septum and apex. The
remaining walls are mildly hypokinetic. No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle (does not exclude due to suboptimal
apical image quality). The aortic root is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-1**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion. No definite cardiac source of embolism
identified.Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of
[**2101-5-31**], septal motion is less vigorous and the distal septum
and apical dysfunction are now apparent c/w interim ischemia.
Based on [**2093**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate a moderate risk (prophylaxis
recommended). Clinical decisions regarding the need for
prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic
data.
