Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 17865**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory failure s/p aspiration

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation at outside facility
Right PICC, s/p removal
Left IJ temporary dialysis line, s/p removal

History of Present Illness:
59M with h/o anemia and H. pylori gastritis, remote pancreatitis
s/p partial pancreatectomy, admitted to OSH with aspiration
after EGD under propofol sedation s/p intubation x 2 with
continued respiratory acidosis and difficulty ventilating sent
here directly to MICU for continued management.
.
The patient went to outside facility today for elective EGD for
f/u biopsies for H. pylori gastritis diagnosed during admission
[**2-/2140**] for UGIB. Last PO intake was at 10pm the night prior. He
was sedated wtih propofol for the procedure and at the end of
procedure had episode of desaturation to 80%, vomiting of
bilious gastric contents and aspiration. Was intubated, and had
bronch which was showing thick white secretions and food
particles in right main stem s/p suctioning. Sent to ICU where
patient was quickly extubated, but found later to be sweaty,
with stridor, and unresponsive on BIPAP so was given solumedrol,
and reintubated with #7 ETT. Had difficulty ventilating patient,
with PIPs 67, plateau pressure of 38, so vent settings adjusted
to pressure control settings and s/p paralysis with vecuronium
and rebronch. CXR found to have bilateral patchy infiltrate. ABG
was 7.0/106/119 with O2 sat of 82-86%.  Initially hypertensive,
then hypotensive. Patient initially on vasopressin, being given
bicarb gtt, on versed gtt at 6mg/hr. Bedside TTE was normal EF.
Also given levofloxacin, flagyl, and IV solumedrol. For access,
patient with RIJ and aline. Most recent ABG was 7.06/87/67. Last
dose of vecuronium was at 6:30pm.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient was intubated, sedated, off any
pressors or bicarb gtt. Initial vent settings PEEP 16, FiO2 100.
TV around 350, MV 8. ABG showed 6.91/127/187. Lactate 2.6, Hct
44.9, Cr 1.7, WBC 1.5 with 37 bands.


Past Medical History:

[**Month (only) 547**] to assess for H. pylori (normal colonoscopy [**2138**])
- severe iron deficiency anemia
- remote pancreatitis s/p partial pancreatectomy (in 20s,

Physical Exam:
Vitals: T:96.7  BP:106/76  P:117  R:20  18  O2:95%
Initial vent settings PEEP 16, FiO2 100. TV around 350, MV 8
General: Intubated, sedated
HEENT: PERRL
Neck: supple, RIJ in place
Lungs: Fair air movement bilaterally and at apices, with
expiratory wheezes
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs,
gallops
Abdomen:  old midline scar, soft, non-tender, non-distended,
bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no
organomegaly
Ext: cool, nonedematous, good DP pulses, L a-line in place

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2140-6-2**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**6-1**], there
is little interval change.  Monitoring and support devices
remain in place. Continued bilateral pulmonary opacification,
most coalescent at the left base, consistent with pneumonia
superimposed and vascular congestion.
.
CXR [**2140-5-29**]: A tracheostomy tube is present. A right subclavian
central line is present, tip overlying proximal SVC. An enteric
tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm off film. The
lungs are hyperinflated. The heart is slightly enlarged. There
are extensive irregular patchy opacities in both lungs, most
pronounced at left greater than right bases. The appearance is
similar to [**2140-7-25**], although probably slightly worse at the left
base. The appearance is compatible with an acute process
superimposed on chronic changes and includes ARDS. The
possibility of a small component of superimposed CHF cannot be
excluded.
.
EKG: Sinus tachycardia without ST/T wave changes
.
[**2140-5-19**] CT Chest/Abd/Pelv: IMPRESSION:
1. Diffuse bilateral pulmonary consolidation, likely reflective
of ARDS in
combination with infection/aspiration, slightly worsened from
the prior study.
2. Moderate right pleural effusion, increased in size.
3. Right internal jugular vein thrombus.
4. Anasarca, with perihepatic and pelvic free fluid.
.
[**2140-6-2**] 04:12AM BLOOD WBC-7.0 RBC-2.64* Hgb-8.1* Hct-23.1*
MCV-88 MCH-30.9 MCHC-35.3* RDW-16.3* Plt Ct-320
.
[**2140-5-26**] EKG: Sinus rhythm. Consider right atrial abnormality.
Non-diagnostic Q waves in leads I and aVL. Since the previous
tracing of [**2140-5-15**] P wave amplitudes are more prominent.
.
[**2140-5-17**]: FINDINGS: Note is made that this is a limited
examination performed at the patient's bedside. Limited views of
the liver demonstrate no focal abnormality. There is no biliary
dilatation and the common duct measures 0.4 cm. The portal vein
is patent with hepatopetal flow. No gallstones are identified.
No ascites is seen in the right upper quadrant.
IMPRESSION: No biliary dilatation identified.
.
[**2140-5-13**] ECHO: The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %). There may be focal
inferior hypokinesis but cannot adequately assess regional wall
motion. The right ventricular cavity is dilated and free wall
motion may be impaired but not well visualized. The aortic valve
is not well seen. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are not well seen. No mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion.



Brief Hospital Course:
59M with h/o anemia, recent H.pylori gastritis transferred for
severe hypercapneic respiratory failure on ventilator at OSH
after aspiration episode during elective EGD procedure found to
be in septic shock, DIC, and difficulty with mechanical
ventilation.
.
# Hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure: Severe
respiratory acidosis with difficulty ventilating at OSH with
evidence of aspiration during EGD. Admit CXR showing bilateral
patchy infiltrates and breathing most likely [**2-23**] aspiration
pneumonitis with severe bronchospasm. Bronchospasm and
obstruction made him very difficult to ventilate and pCO2 on
arrival was >120.  Upon arrival to our hospital, he had very
elevated pulmonary pressures and was found to have a right
pneumothorax, which required chest tube placement.  Multiple
ventilator modes were attempted, heliox, high-dose steroids and
frequent nebs without significant improvement. Bronchoscopy
showed very friable mucosa, no bleeding or mucus.  BAL was
positive for pan sensitive Kleb Pneumo and Ecoli for which he
was treated with Meropenem for 8 day course. He was ultimately
paralyzed for 4 days to help with ventilation and oxygenation.
CVVH was started to help manage the acidosis and pt was slowly
weaned from high ventilator support. Unfortunately, given
prolongued intubation he has a steroid/ICU myopathy and required
perc. tracheostomy placed in the OR by interventional
pulmonology.  He has remained intermittently febrile and CXR on
[**5-29**] showed a new LLL infiltrate in setting of the setting of
resolving bilateral infiltrates.  Sputum was positive for
K.pneumo that is pan sensitive.  He has been treated with 4 days
of Levofloxacin for [**Month/Day (4) 16630**] and will need another 10 days to
complete the course.  He has been able to tolerate up to 2-3hrs
of trach collar at a time but will likely need trach downsize in
the near future.  Otherwise, he has been rested on AC or
pressure support overnight.
