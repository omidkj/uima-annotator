History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 6051**] is a 69 year-old man with a history of a lung mass who
presents with cough and shortness of breath. He was recently
admitted ([**Date range (1) 76571**]) with hempotysis. At that time, bronchoscopy
showed no evidence of active bleeding, though it did show
epiglottic mass with ~50 % obstruction.

Since discharge, he has generally been doing well. He has a
chronic cough which is occasionally blood- and mucous-tinged.
Over the last 24 hours, the cough has been more persistent,
though the amount of blood has decreased. He also has been
experiencing shortness of breath, which has been a bit worse. He
also had chronic chest pains for which he uses morphine. These
are pleuritic in nature and have actually improved somewhat over
the last few days.

On the day of admission, the patient was feeling slightly more
short of breath and tired. His temperature was checked and noted
to be 99.9. His heart rate was elevated (150) with a blood
pressure in the 80s. The family called his oncologist who
recommended ED referral.

In the ED, temperature was 96.0, HR 77, BP 81/56. BP fell as low
as 72/58 while HR increased to 150s. CXR showed a RML/RUL
infiltrate and the patient was given Levaquin and ceftriaxone.
For atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular response, adenosine
was attempted x 2 without success. Cardioversion (100 J) was
performed with conversion to NSR. After cardioversion, blood
pressure once again fell to 77/49 and norepinephrine was
started. A right IJ line was placed. Five liters of NS were
administered.

By the time he arrived in the MICU, he had received 6 liters of
IV fluids and had transiently been on norepinephrine. His blood
pressure had risen to systolic in mid-90s. Norepinephrine was
discontinued soon after arrival to MICU, and blood pressure has
remained stable in the 90s-120s systolic range throughout the
MICU course. His rhythm in the ICU varied from atrial
fibrillation, to atrial flutter, to sinus rhythm. It was sinus
rhythm prior to transfer to the cardiology floor. He denies any
complaints other than cough.

Past Medical History:
1. Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, T3, N2
2. ? Head and neck cancer
3. COPD/Emphysema

Social History:
He moved from [**Country 651**] in [**2160-10-6**], previously worked as an
electrical engineer. He has lived with his son since moving
here. He had no exposure to asbestos. He has a 60-pack-year
smoking history, quit in [**2153**]. He has no history of alcohol use.

Family History:
Brother died of lung cancer.

Supraventricular tachycardia at 152 bpm. Atrial flutter is
suggested. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2161-3-26**] the
rhythm has changed.

PLEURAL FLUID Procedure Date of [**2161-4-14**]
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS. Reactive mesothelial cells,
inflammtory cells and proteinaceous debris.

MICROBIOLOGY
While inpatient, patient had numerous blood cultures, urine
cultures and a pleural fluid culture, all of which were negative
or no growth to date upon discharge.

CXR [**2161-4-4**]
1. Right upper lobe and right lower lobe patchy opacification
with air bronchograms consistent with multi-focal pneumonia.
2. Stable right middle lobe collapse secondary to central
obstructing mass.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2161-4-6**] 5:47 AM
1. Interval increase in the right hilar mass with increased
attenuation of the right main bronchus, right pulmonary artery
and right pulmonary veins.
2. Large right basal effusion with increased interstitial
markings in the right lung and new pulmonary nodules in both
lungs consistent with disease progression.
3. No central or segmental pulmonary emboli; however,
subsegmental pulmonary emboli in the right lower lobe cannot be
excluded.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2161-4-11**] 10:02 AM
Increasing right-sided pleural effusion with possible
superimposed airspace disease in the right lower lobe. Patchy
opacity in the right suprahilar area. Increased interstitial
markings. No pneumothorax.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2161-4-14**] 10:39 AM
In comparison with study of [**4-13**], there has been the removal of
substantial fluid from the right hemithorax. Specifically, no
evidence of pneumothorax. The left lung remains clear.

Brief Hospital Course:
69 year-old man with a recent diagnosis of squamous cell lung
cancer, presenting with shortness of breath and weakness in the
setting of recently diagnosed malignancy and atrial flutter with
a rapid ventricular rate.

# Atrial flutter / atrial fibrillation with RVR: He required
cardioversion in the ED and had subsequent episodes of low BP
with atrial flutter. Diltiazem worked well, however, significant
hypotension occurred with SBP down to the 70s, prompting
discontinuation of the IV diltiazem. One possible etiology for
atrial arrythmias was his malignancy irritating his heart. He
also seemed to have a pneumonia. TSH had been normal [**2-13**]. While
in the ICU, he reportedly had significant pauses on a
combination of digoxin, calcium channel blocker as well as
beta-blocker for rate control. Per EP consults, nodal-blocking
agents should be avoided given propensity for pauses (had a 30
second pause). Following arrival on [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 3, he had one episode
of sustained atrial flutter at 150 bpm on [**2161-4-9**] AM after
ambulating; this spontaneously resolved to sinus rhythm in the
80s. A trigger was called [**4-9**] for sustained heart rate in the
170s and SBP 80s; this resolved with 1 L NS, 10 mEq KCl and 2 gm
IV Mg. He initially declined a pacemaker, but ultimately agreed,
and one was placed [**2161-4-10**] without complication. He was given
Flecainide on [**4-10**] and then started on amiodarone [**4-11**] with
appropriate effect. From that point onwards, he was
predominantly in sinus rhythm with intermittent atrial pacing
with two episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR on [**4-12**] which
resolved with fluid and Mg. The patient was encouraged to take
in more by mouth, but he persistently felt
