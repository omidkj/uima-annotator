Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4679**]
Chief Complaint:
Lung cancer, LEFT upper lobe


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2153-3-28**]: Left thoracotomy with left upper lobectomy and
mediastinal lymph node sampling (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **])


History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 70 y.o. male with a lingular mass found
incidentally on a chest xray done prior to an ENT procedure. He
underwent EBUS and pathology from EBUS demonstrated poorly
differentiated carcinoma with negative nodes. Pathology showed
that the tumor displayed a small component of non-small-cell
lung
cancer as well as dominant component of neuroendocrine carcinoma
with some features suggestive of small cell carcinoma. Per
imaging, there is no distal disease. He underwent pulmonary
function testing which demosntated that he is a favorable
candidate for a lobectomy. He therefore presented for a LEFT
upper lobectomy.

Past Medical History:
- hydradenitis suppurativa, on Humira since [**2152**]
- thymoma s/p resection (median sternotomy [**2137**]) & XRT
- emphysema/COPD
- GERD
- Barrett's esophagus, EGD q 5 years without changes
- middle ear nerve damage with bilateral hearing aids
- thrush
- HTN
- s/p L hemithyroidectomy
- s/p orif L ankle
- s/p L ulnar transposition


Social History:
Social History:

Occupation: business owner/leather covering production sales
Tobacco: quit [**2-/2152**], <1ppd x 15 yrs, 1ppd prior to that since
teens (55 years)
Alcohol: distant heavy use, abstinent since [**2148**].


Family History:
Family History: no cancers or immunodeficiencies


Pertinent Results:
Postop CT scan of chest ([**2153-3-30**]):
1. Status post left upper lobectomy with post-surgical
pneumothorax and trace fluid in the dependent surgical cavity.
2. Left posterior sixth rib surgical thoracotomy and
postoperative
subcutaneous emphysema along the posterior left chest wall.
3. Subcentimeter liver hypodensity within segment VIII, too
small to fully
characterize.
4. 1.7 cm right renal lesion measuring over 40 Hounsfield units,
which could represent a hyperdense cyst, but indeterminate and
could be further assessed by ultrasound on a non-emergent basis.



Brief Hospital Course:
Pt underwent a LEFT upper lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node
sampling through a thoracotomy incision. He tolerated the
procedure well and was extubated without difficulty.
Postoperative pain control was initially accomplished with an
epidural catheter but this was capped due to hypotension
requiring Neo in PACU. He was rapidly transitioned to oral pain
medication wtih IV narcotics for breakthrough pain. Chest tubes
placed during surgery were transitioned from suction to water
seal and then removed POD#2. Chest x-ray demonstrated no
significant pneumothroax but was indeterminate concerning an
effusion or consolidation. A chest CT was therefore obtained and
this demonstrated trace dependent fluid in the surgical cavity
and no evidence of pulmonary consolidation. By POD#3 the
patient's pain was well-controlled on oral pain medications, no
longer requiring supplemental oxygen, ambulating without
difficulty or need for assistance and tolerating a regular diet.
After evaluation by the thoracic surgery team, including
attending surgeon Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7343**], he was able to be discharged home
with his wife.

Discharge Instructions:
* You were admitted to the hospital for surgical removal of the
left upper lobe of your lung (lobectomy). You progressed very
well through your postoperative course and you are now ready for
discharge.

* Continue to use your incentive spirometer 10 times an hour
while awake.
* Check your incisions daily and report any increased redness or
drainage. Cover the area with a gauze pad if it is draining.
* Your chest tube dressing may be removed in 48 hours. If it
starts to drain, cover it with a clean dry dressing and change
it as needed to keep site clean and dry.
* You will continue to need pain medication once you are home
but you can wean it over a few weeks as the discomfort resolves.
Make sure that you have regular bowel movements while on
narcotic pain medications as they are constipating which can
cause more problems. Use a stool softener or gentle laxative to
stay regular.
* No driving while taking narcotic pain medication.
* Take Tylenol 650 mg every 6 hours in between your narcotic. If
your doctor allows you may also take Ibuprofen to help relieve
