Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4980**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
86 W, CAD s/p CABG, CHF with EF of <20%, who presents to the ED
with dyspnea. Of note, patient was recently hospitalized from
[**Date range (1) 23456**] for atypical chest pain.
.
Per NH report, patient was having difficulty breathing with
audible wheezes and rales on exam. Her oxygen saturation was
96-97% on 12L via simple mask. RR was 32 and patient was
described as diaphoretic. Denied CP. She was then sent to the ED
for evaluation. During transport she was switched to NRB on 10
LPM with sat of 100% and she received 80 mg IV lasix and 1 SL
NTG.
.
In the ED, a foley catheter was placed and patient was treated
with albuterol nebs, nitro gtt, and got 1 dose of levofloxacin.
She was started on BiPAP ventilation. She was on the biPap for <
1 hour when she pulled the mask off herself. When the MICU HO
arrived to assess the patient, she was already being prepared
for transport and was noted to be satting 96% on 2 L by NC, in
no apparent distress.
.
This history was almost entirely obtained via records as patient
is deaf and legally blind.
.
Patient transferred to medicine on [**10-2**] after remaining
hemodynamically stable in ICU. No increase in oxygen
requirements and BP stable. Difficult to obtain information from
patient due to her hearing/visual impairment. However, patient
repeatedly saying she wanted to 'get out of here' and go back
apparently to her nursing facility.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2190-10-1**] 8:30 AM
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**9-12**] through 12:
Extensive pleural thickening or small effusion adjacent to
multiple rib fractures in the left mid and lower chest is
unchanged. Chest CT on [**9-19**] showed that the majority of
these fractures are not acute. There is no pneumothorax. Mild
pulmonary edema has recurred. Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly
and large pulmonary arteries are longstanding.

Brief Hospital Course:
86 W, CAD s/p CABG, CHF with EF of <20%, admitted for dyspnea
and transferred to ICU, now hemodynamically stable and called
out to medicine service.
.
#SOB/CHF:
Per patient's last echo in [**2185**], EF is < 20 %. It is likely even
lower than that she has had a positive stress test and has
medically-managed CAD. Obviously she is at very high risk for
dyspnea from fluid shifts. Per last d/c summary there was some
concern for PNA on CT, but patient was never dx'd or treated for
PNA. No evidence of PNA on current CXR.
- cont lasix, monitor UOP for goal of even
- oxygen support, no increase in O2 requirement
- CXR revealed mild pulmonary edema and unchanged pleural
effusion
.
#HTN:
Patient was stable upon transfer to the medicine service but
became hypotensive into SBP 80s the following morning on [**10-3**].
She had received her diuretics the night prior and may have been
volume-depleted in combination with fluid restriction and
decreased PO intake while inpatient. She was gently rehydrated
and BP, which is normally low at baseline, trended up and her
mentation remained intact. Patient was also complaining of chest
pain and EKG was unchanged from prior. Cardiac enzymes were sent
and pending. Patient has a tenuous fluid balance status due to
CHF and must be careful not to over diurese. Lasix will be
decreased to 20 PO daily as she does not have signs of volume
overload and lungs are clear on exam.
- Cont meds to optimize BP control
- on metoprolol, isorbide mononitrate and lisinopril; hold for
low BP
- lasix 20mg PO daily
.
# CAD
No complaints of CP. Elevated cardiac enzymes due to
stress/demand ischemia. No need for further followup given
patient's co-morbidities and code status. No ST changes on EKG.
- hold ASA in setting of low Hct and concern for bleeding
- cont statin
.
#Anemia:
Patient had intial drop in Hct on admission with serial Hct
remaining unchanged. Patient guiaic negative and no GI
intervention necessary. Iron studies normal.
.
# F/E/N:
NPO, aggressively replete lytes
.
# PPx:
PPI, pneumoboots
.
#Access:

# Dispo:
