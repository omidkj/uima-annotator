Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:
Ms. [**Known lastname **]. [**Known lastname **] is a 77 yo female with severe baseline lung
disease (COPD and IPF) requiring home O2, presenting with
respiratory distress and pneumonia.
.
# COPD/IPF exacerbation: She has a history of COPD, IPF,
pulmonary hypertension, PFO. She has baseline DOE on 5L oxygen
at home ([**Hospital3 **]). Because of hypoxemia to 80%, she was
admitted to MICU.  She was placed on bipap and was never
intubated.  She eventually required CPAP only at night with 5-7
L by NC during the day.  She received steroids (IV to PO) and
nebulizer treatments.  The patient stated her wishes to be
DNR/DNI.  She will be discharged on a prednisone taper.  A bipap
machine for home was also arranged for the patient where she
will use at setting of [**4-10**].  Nasal saline also helped the
patient with dryness and bleeding from her nose due to oxygen
flow.  She will continue her regular medications and inhalers at
home.  She was also prescribed low dose fentanyl lozenges for
use as outpatient when preparing for exertion to decrease pain
and exertion.  She will followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 217**]
regarding the effectiveness of these.
.
# Community acquired pneumonia: She was initially placed on
vancomycin and levofloxacin.  Only levofloxacin was continued
for a total course of 10 days.  This was renally dosed (750 mg
every other day).
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Creatinine 1.8 on admission;
this decreased to baseline of 1.3 by discharge.  Acute component
was most likely prerenal/dehydration.  Medications were renally
dosed.
.
# Blood cultures: 1/4 bottles positive for GPCs in clusters
which were later identified as coag negative staph.  Due to only
having 1/4 bottles and that it was SCN, it was treated as a
contaminant, and vancomycin was discontinued.
.
# Hypertension: She remained on Coreg, diltiazem, imdur. Lasix
initally held with ARF but then restarted.
.
# Back and chest wall pain: reproducible at site of previous rib
fractures. It seemed unlikely to be cardiac in origin and
enzymes were negative; ECG did not show ischemic changes.  A
lidoderm patch was used in house and will be prescribed for the
patient as an outpatient, as it provided significant relief.
.
# CAD: ASA, Imdur, Vytorin, Coreg were continued.  Acute MI was
ruled out.
