Mr. [**Known lastname 7011**] is a very pleasant 61-year-old gentleman with a prior
history of stage IIIB carcinoma of the left upper lobe diagnosed
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 20042**] in the
remote past and treated with chemoradiotherapy. He was recently
also diagnosed with CLL and then was found to have a second lung

primary in [**2117**], treated with video-assisted local resection.
This was found to be an adenocarcinoma. A followup shows
increasing infiltrative appearance of the right lower lobe,
prompting a bronchoscopy done earlier this month, which
unfortunately confirms recurrent adenocarcinoma. The patient
notes somewhat worsening dyspnea on exertion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was taken to the OR on [**2120-7-24**] for bronchoscopy,
mediastinoscopy, and thoracotomy for RLL lobectomy.  Frozen
section of mediastinal LN were negative for lung CA but CLL
involvement could not be ruled out.  In the PACU, Neo was
required to maintain blood pressure and the patient was admitted
to the SICU post-op.  Urine output was good, but blood pressure
did not improve despite several fluid boluses. Epidural d/c'd in
PACU as it was not working. Pain controlled with Dilaudid PCA.

trending down, and again 1U PRBC on POD4. Mitodine started POD5
and Neo gtt could be stopped.  Patient was transfered to floor
on POD 5. Episode of rapid AFib late POD 4, controlled with
metoprolol. CT #2 also d/c'd on POD5. CT #1 d/c'd POD6,
post-pull CXR showed substantial PTX.  New CT placed POD 6 with
poor placement (along diaphragm). CT replaced on POD 7.  Late
POD 7, patient again in rapid AFib, did not convert with
lopressor, Amiodorone started. CT water sealed POD 8 able to d/c
O2. CT d/c'd on POD 9, post-pull CXR showed very small R apical
