History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 19017**] is a 66yo M w/ a PMH of COPD, CAD, and hyperglycemia
who presents with SOB. He was just discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2105-9-20**] after being hospitalized for 3 days with similar
symptoms. He was treated for a COPD flare with PO prednisone and
levofloxacin. He states he was feeling well upon discharge and
was stable for several hours at home. He went to bed, but was
woken up by SOB. He took several nebulizer treatments without
any improvment in his symptoms. He had not yet gotten any of his
prescriptions filled, so he did not take any additional
antibiotics or steroids. His wife then woke up and saw that he
was in respiratory distress and called EMS. He was brought to
the ER for further evaluation. He notes that he did not have any
chest pain, palpitations, LH, or dizziness, but did have a
"sticking" sensation in his chest yesterday which is his anginal
equivalent.

In the ER, VS on admission were T 98.1, BP 92/53, HR 106, RR 25,
sats 93% on 4L. Given IVF bolus, nebs, and abx. SBP remained in
the 80s, sats varied from 100% on 2L to 93% on 4L. In total, he
received ~1700cc of IVF and made 470cc of UOP. SBP remained in
the 80s so pt was transferred to the ICU for further monitoring.
He was also given a dose of solumedrol for COPD flare. EKG was
w/o any acute changes.

rSR' in V1, V2, III (unchanged from prior), flattened T waves in
precordial leads, no ST changes
.
CXR [**2105-9-21**]: Lungs again noted to be hyperinflated. Mild
bibasilar
atelectasis is identified. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes
are stable. There is no evidence of pneumothorax, infiltrate or
effusion.

.
ECHO [**2103-8-20**]: The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function
are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with good systolic
function. The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal
with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild right ventricular cavity enlargement with
preserved global biventricular systolic function.


Brief Hospital Course:
COPD: Hospitalized multiple times in the past month with COPD
exacerbations.  He is being discharged today with follow up
planned with pulmonologist on Friday [**10-2**].  He is currently on
Prednisone 40 mg po qd, standing nebs, advair, and is using his
BiPap at night.  He has rarely been on less that 40 mg of
Prednisone over the past month.  For that reason, rather than
prescribing a taper, he was d/c'd with plan to continue
Prednisone 40 mg until he sees his pulmonologist (contact[**Name (NI) **] by
email) in 2 days for instructions as to whether he is ready to
taper.  Additionally, he was originally in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on this
admission pulmonary team there suggested treatment for
pseudomonas given that this was isolated in his sputum.  He
completed a 10 day course of Cefepime [**9-30**].

CAD: Stable.  Continued ASA, statin.
Verapamil restarted, lisinopril held for low-normal BP.

HYPOTENSION on admission: Unclear etiology. Given elevated cell
counts and BUN/Cr, likely dehydration. Responded well to IVF.

HYPERLIPIDEMIA: Cont on home dose atorvastatin.
.
UNSAFE AT HOME/ ELDER AT RISK:  Pt felt unsafe at home, afraid
of his step son whom he believed to be dealing drugs.  According
to VNA, bullets holes seen in pt's home window.  Elderly
protective services were contact[**Name (NI) **] and they contact[**Name (NI) **] police.
Restraining order was generated by [**Location (un) 86**] Municiple Court (I
reviewed the actual document) and step son's belongings were
removed from patient's home.  Pts wife agreed with this. Elder
risk services deemed pt safe to return home, pt felt safe.
