Pertinent Results:
CATH [**2167-3-25**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated two vessel coronary disease. The LMCA had a 20%
lesion. The
LAD had a proximal 90% hazy lesion. The LCx was patent. The RCA
was
totally occluded and filled by collaterals from the LAD.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left sided
filling
pressures with LVEDP of 30 mmHg prior to nitroglycerin and lasix

treatment.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Heart failure necessitating nitroglycerin and IV lasix.
3. CABG recommended.

TTE [**2167-3-26**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior, septal and
apical hypokinesis (muiltivessel CAD). The remaining segments
contract normally (LVEF = 40%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPrESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
c/w multivessel CAD. Mild aortic regurgitation. Moderate
ischemic mitral regurgitation.

TEE [**2167-3-31**]
PRE-BYPASS: Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body
of the left atrium. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
severe hypokinesis of the mid to distal septum, inferior wall,
and apex. The remainder of the segments are hypokinetic. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF=
25-30 %). The right ventricular cavity size is normal with mild
global free wall hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma in the
aortic arch. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results at time of
surgery.
POST-BYPASS: The patient is AV paced. The patient is on
epinephrine and nitroglycerin infusions. Global left ventricular
function appears improved (LVEF 30-35%). Segmental wall motion
abnormalities are unchanged. Right ventricular function is
improved. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Aortic
regurgitation is unchanged. The aorta is intact
post-decannulation.

Final Report
As compared to the previous image, there is no relevant change.

Moderate cardiomegaly, status post CABG. No pulmonary edema. No
pneumonia.  Small bilateral pleural effusions, better visible on
the lateral than on the frontal image. Unchanged right internal
jugular vein catheter.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 48910**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2167-3-25**] for further
work-up of his dyspnea and chest pain. He underwent a cardiac
catheterization which revealed severe two vessel coronary artery
disease. As he was in heart failure, lasix was given. Due to
shortness of breath, a non re-breather was used to make him
comfortable. Intravenous nitroglycerin was started with good
effect for hypertension and he was admitted to the intensive
care unit. Given the severity of his disease, the cardiac
surgical service was consulted for surgical evaluation. He was
worked-up in the usual preoperative manner including a carotid
ultrasound shich showed a 40-59% right internal carotid artery
stenosis and no significant left disease. As he had mitral valve
regurgitation by surface echo, a dental consult was obtained for
oral clearance for surgery. After obtaining a panorex film, he
was cleared for surgery from a dental standpoint. Plavix was
held and allowed to washout prior to surgery. On [**2167-3-31**], Mr.
[**Known lastname 48910**] was taken to the operating room where he underwent
coronary artery bypass grafting to three vessels. Please see
operative note for details. Amiodarone was started
intraoperatively due to ventricular ectopy with weaning from
bypass. Postoperatively he was admitted to the intensive care
unit for monitoring. Over the next 24 hours, he awoke
nuerologically intact and was extubated. Later on postoperative
day one, he was transferred to the step down unit for further
recovery. He was gently diuresed towards his preoperative
weight. The physical therapy service was consulted for
