Chief Complaint:
Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure

Rigid bronchoscopy
Intubation
Central line placement

History of Present Illness:
58 y/o woman w/ SCLC, metastatic, s/p XRT, CHEMO with recent
non-response to chemotherapy admitted to [**Location (un) **] with
dyspnea. She was found to have a right upper lobe collapse, and
a pleural effusion. A pleurex catheter was placed. She was
transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for IP evaluation and possible tracheal
stenting.  Bronchoscopy however, demonstrated extensive
involvement of the right mainstem, right upper lobe, right
middle lobe, and right lower lobe with tumor.  She is not a
candidate for a stent given distal airway disease. After the
procedue she developed hypercarbic respiratory failure. They
attempted Non-invasive ventilation but she failed this with
continued hypercapnea. She was intubated with initial vent
settings of pressure support 22/5 PEEP, 50% fi02. Her RR was
30-40. She was tachycardic and an attempt was made to obtain a
CTA of her chest. She was hypotensive to the 50s sytolic during
the study and was returned to the TSCIU. She was then transfered
to the MICU.
.
When in the MICU, she was transitioned to volume control
ventilation with Tv 350/RR 20/100% Fi02 and 10 peep. Her ABGs
improved on these settings. Given her underlyign COPD, her
minute ventilation was approx [**6-30**] with a prolonged expiratory
time and ap[prox 6mmH20 auto-peep.
.
A CTA was performed of chest/brain to eval for PE and brain
metastasis. No PE was seen, but several large brain lesions were
seen including a cerebellar mass with tonsilar herniation.  The
patient's husband was [**Name (NI) 653**] about the findings which was new
to him. She was last seen by her oncologist in [**Month (only) **]. He
expressed that she would not want aggresive measures taken and
that surgery was not in line with her goals of care.
.
Neurosurgery was [**Month (only) 653**] prior to speaking with his husband
who [**Name2 (NI) 77048**] IV decadron. Manitol coudl not be used
secondary to pressor dependance and hyperventialtion also coudl
not be performed due to her unerlying lung disease.

.
CXR [**2-13**] Line Placement: In comparison with earlier study of
this date, the right subclavian catheter extends to the mid
portion of the SVC. There is even further diffuse opacification
involving the right hemithorax with congestion in the left lung.
The possibility of a left lower lung pneumonia can certainly not
be excluded.
.
CXR [**2-13**]: No previous images. There is extensive opacification
of the right hemithorax consistent with some combination of
pleural effusion, atelectasis, and pneumonia. The mediastinal
structures appear to be within the midline. The left lung is
clear.
.
CT Head [**2-13**]: Enhancing mass lesions centered within the left
thalamus, right pons and left cerebellar hemisphere, concerning
for metastatic disease. There is mass effect with downward
displacement of the left cerebellar tonsil and compression of
the third and fourth ventricles with asymmetric dilatation of
the posterior left ventricular [**Doctor Last Name 534**]. If clinically indicated,
further characterization could be performed with
contrast-enhanced MRI to assess for small lesions not seen on
CT.
.
CXR [**2-14**]: Little overall change except for placement of
nasogastric tube.
.
CTA Chest [**2-14**]: 1. No evidence of pulmonary embolus. 2. Known
mass replacing the majority of the right lung and significantly
compressing both the pulmonary arterial and bronchial trees.
There is extensive associated thoracic adenopathy. 3. Patchy
left lung opacity has an appearance more suggestive of an
infectious or inflammatory process.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 8049**] is a 58 y/o female with SCLC admitted with hypercarbic
respiratory failure, found to have several large brain
metastases with tonsillar herniation on head CT.
.
#) Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure. Unclear etiology/inciting
event. She did receive sedation, but she had a bronchoscopy the
day prior with sedation and no subsequent respiratory failure.
Brain lesions may be contributing, but no acute herniation event
(pupils still reactive). No PE seen on CTA. Mechanical
ventilation continued. Nebulizers, steroids, and empiric
levofloxacin/metronidazole were started. After a discussion with
the family, a mutual goal of weaning the ventilatory was
established so that the patient could communicate and interact
with her family.  She was discharged to [**Hospital 16843**] Hospital on
AC 330x30, 80%, 10.
.
# Brain Metastasis. Found on head CT, large and multiple. Had
received previous whole brain prophylactic radiation 2 years
ago. Neurosurgery was consulted and recommended steroids IV as
well as mannitol. Given the size of the masses, they could be
removed prior to any pallitive radiation, but in her current
decompensated respiratory state, is unlikely to offer benefit,
even short term. If we are able to get her off the ventilator,
woudl be reasonable to discuss possible intervention. However,
the family believes that she would not want surgery, so the
goals of care shifted more towards palliation, with goals to
wean the ventilator.
.
# Post-Obstructive Pneumonia. Seen on bronchoscopy, with
elevated WBC and fevers to 102. Empiric treatment with
levofloxacin/metronidazole.
.
# Hypotension: Concerning for both hypovolemia and sepsis. Other
etiologies could be sedation related. Central compression also
possible.  Blood, urine, and sputum cultures sent. Pressors
given as needed (phenylephrine).
.
# SCLC: As above, metastatic. Further treatment discussions
largely dependent on if it is possible to wean her from
ventilator.
.
# CAD: continue statin, hold aspirin/metoprolol given brain
metastases and hypotension, respectively.
.
# Depression: continued citalopram.
