Attending:[**Doctor First Name 16571**]
Chief Complaint:
Seizure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This is a 60 year old man with known metastatic brain disease
discovered [**2121-6-3**] from non small cell lung cancer diagnosed
in
[**2118**] now admitted to the because of a fall and then a witnessed
seizure by EMS.

His cancer history consists of an upper lobe lobectomy in [**9-3**],
carboplatin and taxol, and unfortunately thoracic recurrence of
his disease seen in [**3-6**] with subsequent treatment with
gemcitabine. He started having headaches in [**2121-6-3**] at which
time he was diagnosed with multiple (~7) brain metastases for
which he received [**Year (4 digits) 108337**] and whole brain radiation over 10
successive treatments. His wife notes that he has had some
chronic leg weakness but she thinks this may have become worse
since completing the radiation. Because his doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) 2985**] that
[**Name5 (PTitle) 108337**] was contributing to a steroid-induced myopathy, they
stopped the [**Name5 (PTitle) 108337**] at least a month ago according to her. He
was scheduled for a bone scan and by OMR notes it is clear that
he does have a history of thoracic and lumbar spine metastases.
His lower extremity strength did not improve after the
discontinuation of steroids.

He did not report increasing headaches over the last few days.
His appetite has been poor in general. His family states that he

spends most of his days watching tv and does not really get up
to
walk much because of his low back pain and hip pain which is
chronic. He has been known to confuse the time of day and that
day of the week lately but they seem to say that is the extent
of
his confusion. They deny ever having seen any seizure activity.

This morning at around 5 or 6am, his wife heard a huge thud in
the bathroom and he appeared to be stuck between the toilet and
the door. EMS came and had to break down the door and he was
found to be confused, but not foaming at the mouth. There was no

evidence of tongue biting or urinary incontinence apparently.
They did note his right side was "flaccid." Upon getting him to
the ambulance they noted to some left sided extremity shaking
with his eyes deviated to the left. It is not clear how long
this
lasted but 2mg ativan was given and it resolved. He was brought
here an intubated at approximately 7am. 100mg hydrocortisone, 1g

dilantin, propofol drip and KCl have been given.


Past Medical History:
1. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
2. Hypertension.
3. Emphysema.
4. Alcohol-induced cardiomyopathy.
5. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
6. Colonic polyps
7. Lung cancer history as above
8. Blind from childhood.


Social History:
lives with family
Habits: not known

Family History:
family history of colon cancer


Physical Exam:
Examination: T 99.9 BP 120/83 HR 93 RR 20 100% vented
General appearance: well appearing, moving around, but intubated

Heart: regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs or gallops
Lungs: coarse upper airway sounds bilaterally
Abdomen: soft, nontender
Extremities: no clubbing, cyanosis or edema

Mental Status: The patient is on moving around, intermittently
opening his eyes spontaneously but obviously nonverbal. He is on

propofol drip.

Cranial Nerves: The visual fields are full. The optic discs are
atrophied bilaterally with no evidence of hemorrhage or
papilledema.Dolls' eye maneuver results in horizontal eye
movements. The pupils are nonreactive to light. There is no
obvious facial droop. There is a cough.

Sensory/Motor System: He localizes to pain in all 4 extremities
purposefully. The tone in the lower extremities is increased and

are externally rotated bilaterally.

Reflexes: The tendon reflexes are present, symmetric and normal
in all joints including the Achilles. The plantar reflexes are
mute bilaterally.


Pertinent Results:
Imaging: CT head:
There is extensive edema throughout the right temporal lobe and
right frontal lobe without evidence of hematoma. There is
midline
shift of the frontal lobe, subfalcine herniation that is not
much
changed from the MRI in [**6-6**]. The ventricles appear to be about
the same size as before as well. There is no impending tonsillar

herniation.

EKG: sinus tachy 155bpm, left axis deviation, St depressions in
V4-6, St elevation III, aVF

Repeat EKG: NSR 92bpm, ST elevation in III, AVF resolved; St
depression in C4-6 resolved.

CXR: large gastric bubble, right hilar mass. No obvious
infiltrate or consolidation

Brief Hospital Course:
1.  Seizures - 60 year old man with brain metastases from
advanced lung cancer, now with at least one witnessed seizure. A
CT scan was obtained which showed extensive edema which might
have been worse from the time his brain was scanned in [**Month (only) **]
[**2121**]. This in and of itself, in addition to the right frontal
lobe lesion, may be the explanation for his seizure(s) at
admission. There were no other obvious abnormalities in his labs
to have lowered the seizure threshold. He was admitted to the
neuro ICU for high dose steroids, seizure prophylaxis, and q1hr
neuro checks. In the Neuro ICU [**Year (4 digits) **] 10mg x1 was given
followed by 6mg iv q6h. Dilantin was given.  EEG was done.  MRI
was done which showed: "Interval increase in size of the
multiple brain metastases.  Stable mass effect. No evidence of
brain herniation at this time."  Spine MRI showed:"Drop
metastasis at the T12-L1 level on the left.  Diffuse metastatic
disease involving the vertebral bodies and the right iliac
bone."  Most likely he needs to be on chronic steroids and
seizure prophylaxis.
  He was transferred to the oncology floor for further
management.  A family discussion was held on [**2121-9-30**]. At which
time it was decided to make the patient CMO.  Palliative care
was contact[**Name (NI) **] and all medications were discontinued except for
[**Name (NI) **], Morphine, Ativan, and Dilantin.  He was continued on
these medications while appropriate placement was found for him.
 At hospice he should be continued on seizure prophylaxis with
[**Name (NI) **] and Dilantin.

2.  Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. -Initially he was
continued on insulin sliding scale for diabetes and steroids.
This treatment was stopped when he was made comfort measures
only.

3. Hypertension. - Anti-hypertension medications were initially
continued but were all stopped when he was made comfort measures
only.

4. FEN - Initially he was NPO as he had not passed a speach and
swallow evaluation.  He was re-evaluated on [**2121-10-6**] at which
time his swallowing ability had recovered sufficiently that it
was felt he would be able to have nectar thick pureed liquids.
He was continued on this diet.  He was also given his
medications by mouth after this evaluation.

5. Code status - His code status was changed on this admission
to DNR/DNI/CMO based upon the poor prognosis of his metastatic
lung cancer combined with mental status changes from his brain
metastasis.

6.  Pain control - He was continued on Ativan and Morphine for
pain control.
