Pertinent Results:
Conclusions
Pre-CPB:
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).

Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic [**Name (NI) 5236**].
The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Moderate
(2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Post-CPB:
The patient is on low dose [**Male First Name (un) **] and AV paced for slow SR.
Preserved biventricularsystolic fxn.
The prosthetic aortic valve is well-seated with no leak and no
AI. Residual mean gradient = 13.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted and underwent
AVR(tissue)/CABGx1(SVG->PLB) on [**10-21**].  He tolerated the
procedure well and was transferred to the CVICU on Neo and
Propofol.  He was difficult to oxygenate on his postoperative
night and had a bronchoscopy for copious secretions.  The
patient did not tolerate Propofol weaning and would become
extremely agitated.  He remained intubated and was started on
Valium and tube feedings on POD#2.  His chest tubes were
discontinued and he was hemodynamically stable.  Precedex was
attempted as well, but the patient spiked temps to 103 with this
medication.  He received aggressive respiratory therapy and
diuresis for the next few days and slowly improved.  It was felt
that the patient was suffering from DTs and Percocet withdrawal.
 He was extubated on POD#6 and remained extremely agitated.
He was stated on Clonidine and Methadone and eventually became
more oriented.  H. Flu grew from his sputum and he was treated
with Ampicillin.  He was transferred to the floor on POD# 9 and
his Valium and Methadone were weaned.  He was discharged to home
in stable condition on POD#10.
