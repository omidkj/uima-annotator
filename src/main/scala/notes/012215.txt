CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECO Study Date of [**2129-8-15**] 12:13 AM
IMPRESSION:
1.  There is a large amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage seen
within the sylvian fissures, suprasellar cistern,
perimesencephalic cistern, and fourth ventricle.  There is
minimal layering of this hemorrhage within the lateral
ventricles bilaterally.
2.  On CTA images, there are two aneurysms of the left posterior
communicating artery, with the largest aneurysm measuring
approximately 7 mm x 4 mm.  There is also a 3 mm aneurysm of the
right posterior communicating artery and a 4 mm aneurysm at the
right MCA bifurcation.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2129-8-15**] 10:22 PM
IMPRESSION:
1.  Status post left frontal craniotomy and clipping of known
left PCA
aneurysms.  Continued diffuse subarachnoid and intraventricular
hemorrhage.

VERT/CAROTID A-GR Study Date of [**2129-8-15**] 8:25 AM
IMPRESSION:  There are a total of four aneurysms.  The largest
aneurysm
measures 7.5 mm x 4.5 mm with a 4 mm neck in the left posterior
communicating artery.  Smaller 3 mm x 3 mm aneurysm at the
origin of the left posterior communicating artery.  There is a 4
mm aneurysm at the right middle cerebral artery bifurcation and
a 3.4 mm aneurysm at the right posterior communicating artery.

CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECO Study Date of [**2129-8-19**] 12:22 PM
IMPRESSION:
1.  Since prior study, a hypodense lesion involving the left
internal capsule and external capsule is more apparent, and
likely represents an evolving infarct.
2.  There continues to be diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage as
well as
hemorrhage layering within the lateral ventricles bilaterally.
3.  There is mild-to-moderate non-occlusive vasospasm involving
the ACA and MCA bilaterally, as well as the vertebrobasilar
system.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2129-8-21**] 12:32 PM
IMPRESSION:
1.  Unchanged quantity and distribution of diffuse subarachnoid
hemorrhage, although there is slightly increased amount of
layering blood products in the bilateral occipital horns of the
lateral ventricles.
2.  Slightly increased prominence of hypodensity in the left
basal ganglia, suggestive of evolving infarct.

CAROT/CEREB [**Hospital1 **] Study Date of [**2129-8-24**] 8:51 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged mild spasm of the right A1 and M2 segments.
2. Mild improvement with persistent mild spasm of the right A2
segment.
3. Moderate spasm of the left A1 and A2 segment and is
unchanged.
4. Worsened spasm of the left M2 segment and left distal
vertebral artery,
basilar artery and bilateral PCAs as described above.
5. Unchanged aneurysms of the right MCA and PICA.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2129-8-25**] 12:13 PM
IMPRESSION:
1.  Compared to prior study from [**2129-8-22**], there has been
interval
development of low attenuation of the left anterior temporal
lobe.  This is concerning for a new evolving infarct.
2.  The diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage as well as hemorrhage
with layering within the lateral ventricles bilaterally is
redemonstrated.

MOD SEDATION, EAC Study Date of [**2129-8-26**] 7:28 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged persistent mild spasm of the A1 segment of the
right ACA, A2
segment of the left ACA and M2 segment of the left MCA
2. Unchanged mild spasm of the left supraclinoid ICA.
3. Unchanged severe spasm of the basilar artery and bilateral
PCA.
4. The left internal carotid artery was catheterized by
Berenstein 1 catheter.
5. Verapamil infusion through the bilateral internal carotid
arteries.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2129-8-29**] 9:35 AM
CONCLUSION:  Slight interval increase in size of lateral
ventricles and likely the third ventricle as well, following
clamping of the ventriculostomy drainage catheter.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2129-8-30**] 9:34 AM
IMPRESSIONS:
1.  There has been interval removal of the right ventriculostomy
catheter.
There is now a hypodense track seen where the catheter had
traversed.
2.  There has been minimal thickening of the extraaxial fluid
collection
underlying the left frontal craniotomy possibly secondary to
postsurgical
changes. Otherwise there is no significant interval changes.

VERT/CAROTID A-GR Study Date of [**2129-8-30**] 4:07 PM
IMPRESSION:  Significantly improved spasm of the basilar artery
and both
posterior cerebral arteries with only minimal residual left P1
segment spasm.
Minimal spasm of the left A1 segment of the anterior cerebral
artery.
Minimal spasm of the right A1 segment of the ACA, which is
improved since
prior study.
Infusion therapy performed with Verapamil via the bilateral
internal carotid arteries.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2129-8-31**] 10:13 AM
IMPRESSION:  There has been no significant interval change since
the prior
exam.

CT HEAD W/ & W/O CONTRA Study Date of [**2129-9-3**] 9:37 AM
IMPRESSION:
1.  Stable size of ventricles with no new intraparenchymal
hemorrhage.
2.  Unchanged size of small left frontal extra-axial fluid
collection,
however, there is enhancement of the meninges and left sylvian
regions which may represent reactive change secondary to
hemorrhage or post- operative change. Clinical correlation
recommended.

IMPRESSION:  No DVT.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt presented on [**8-15**] as a transfer from an OSH a diagnosois of a
subarachnoid hemorrhage. Angiography on [**8-15**] showed multiple
aneurysms and the pt underwent a posterior communicating
aneurysm clipping on [**8-15**]. Tmax on [**8-15**] was 101.6. On increased
