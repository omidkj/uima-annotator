Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**11-29**] after cardiac catheterization
performed at [**Hospital1 **] MC. He had received Plavix before and at
catheterization. At the time of transfer he was pain free on
both Heparin and nitroglycerin infusions. He was evaluated for
surgical candidacy. During this workup he experienced ongoing
chest pain and was brought emergently to the operating room on
[**11-30**]. Please see OR report for details.  In summary he had
coronary artery bypass grafting and mitral valve replacement
with Left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending
artery and saphenous vein grafts to obtuse marginal, ramus and
the posterior descending arteries. Endoscopic harvesting of the
long saphenous vein. Mitral valve repair with a size 30
[**Company 1543**] Profile 3-D ring. His bypass time was 124 minutes with
a crossclamp of 112 minutes. He tolerated the operation well and
was transferred from the operating room to the cardiac surgery
ICU in stable condition. He did well in the immediate post-op
period, woke neurologically intact and was extubated.

He remained hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the
stepdown floor on POD1.
All tubes, lines and drains were removed according to cardiac
surgery protocol.  Beta blockade was resumed and he was diuresed
towards his preoperative weight.  he had some dysrhythmia and an
EPS consult was obtained on [**12-5**].

Physical therapy worked with him for mobiltiy and strengthening.
 Over the next several days his activity level was gradually
advanced, his medications were titrated to effect and on
POD****** he was discharged home with visiting nurses.
Additionally, he was seen for dental evaluation prior to
surgery, the recommendation was for extraction, patient refused
to have extractions while in the hospital, despite multiple
discussions about the need to remove infected teeth given his
prosthetic heart ring.   He was discharged on Clindamycin,
ongoing.

He developed urinary retention requiring foley insertion on
[**12-4**].  Given his history of retention and cancer, he was sent
home on Flomax (on chronically) and will follow up with his
urologist.
