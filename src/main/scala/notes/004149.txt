Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1561**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath w/ exertion- new x2 weeks

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Flexible bronchoscopy, diagnostic.
2. Cervical mediastinoscopy with biopsy.
3. Right thoracotomy with wedge excision and right upper
   lobectomy.
4. Mediastinal lymphadenectomy.
5. Attempted right thoracoscopy.


History of Present Illness:
delightful 83-
year-old gentleman with COPD and pulmonary fibrosis with a
long history of smoking. In recent years, he has been
developing dyspnea, in the Spring, during the pollen season.
Most recently, he developed an episode that required a visit
to the Emergency Room and a three day pulmonary
rehabilitation to date. The CT scan during this visit
demonstrated a new 15 mm spiculated right upper lobe nodule.
He denied any significant dyspnea other than these acute
episodes that he has in the Spring; however, his wife reports
that his wife is winded with minimal exertion, including
climbing a flight of stairs.  He does play golf on a daily
basis but does so with a cart. He reports being reasonably
active and not being particularly limited by shortness of
breath.  However, his wife disagrees with this.  Pulmonary
function tests demonstrated a FEV-1 of 2.04 which is 68% of
predicted and a DLCO of 59% predicted but he has restrictive
lung disease.  A preoperative PET scan demonstrated activity
within the lesion but not elsewhere within the body.  I had a
long discussion with the family preoperatively and I
indicated to them that there is a high likelihood of an open
resection given the extent of scarring seen on CT scan from
the asbestosis. Additionally, I discussed the likelihood of
performing a wedge excision for diagnosis and therapy given
his extensive pulmonary disease and baseline dyspnea.
Therefore, we proceeded forward with the following operation.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2194-6-2**] 11:31 AM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: ? PTX

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
83 year old man with chest tube removal
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
? PTX
INDICATION: Status post chest tube removal, evaluate for
pneumothorax.

COMPARISON: [**2194-6-1**].

TECHNIQUE: PA and lateral chest.

FINDINGS: There has been interval removal of two right-sided
chest tubes. No definite pneumothorax is identified. There is
pleural effusion layering along the lateral aspect of the right
lung and stable parenchymal opacities within the right lung and
at the left base. Left pleural effusion is unchanged. The
osseous structures appear unchanged. Stable subcutaneous
emphysema within the right chest wall.

IMPRESSION:
1. No definite evidence of pneumothorax following chest tube
removal. Stable subcutaneous emphysema.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
3. Stable patchy opacities within the right lung and left base.

ANESTHESIA:  General endotracheal supplemented by multiple
intercostal nerve blocks. The patient will receive an
epidural at the end of the case.

INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION:  The patient is a delightful 83-
year-old gentleman with COPD and pulmonary fibrosis with a
long history of smoking. In recent years, he has been
developing dyspnea, in the Spring, during the pollen season.
Most recently, he developed an episode that required a visit

Therefore, we proceeded forward with the following operation.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  The patient was taken to the
operating room and placed under general endotracheal
anesthesia with a single lumen endotracheal tube.  We
performed a flexible bronchoscopy and examined the entire
tracheobronchial tree. We found no endobronchial lesions and
found no anatomical abnormalities. We positioned the patient
supine but we were unable to extend his neck due to
degenerative joint disease.  We prepped and draped his neck
and chest in the usual sterile fashion.  We made a 1 cm
transverse incision 2 cm cephalad to the sternal notch and
dissected down to the pretracheal plane. We bluntly developed
the pretracheal plane with the mediastinoscope down the
trachea and down bilateral mainstem bronchi.  There was an
extensive amount of fatty tissue within the mediastinum and
vicinity of the lymph nodes. We found small lymph nodes in
the 4-R posit
