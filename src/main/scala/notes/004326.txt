History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 39533**] is a 83 y/o female with multiple admissions to
outside hospitals in recent months for CHF. She was discharged
from [**Location (un) 1110**]/[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3075**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3549**] hospital [**12-9**] for Pneumonia (+MRSA)
and then readmitted on [**2118-12-16**] to [**Hospital 47**] [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital for
increased shortness of breath. She also had hypotension
requiring pressors in the ICU and received RBC transfussion and
improved hemodynamically. Subsequent Echo revealed severe mitral
stenosis with mitral regurgitation and normal EF. Cardiac cath
revealed 60-70% RCA lesion and severe, calcific rheumatic MS &
MR. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for surgical management
(CABG/MVR).

Family History:

Physical Exam:
Neuro: Grossly intact
HEENT: EOMI, PERRLA, NC/AT, edentulous
Pulm: Lungs with rare exp. wheeze, course bilat.
Cor: RRR, +S1S2
Abd: Soft NT/ND, +BS
Ext: Warm, -edema

Pertinent Results:
Echo [**12-26**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is moderate mitral stenosis. Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Suspect that the mitral stenosis
is a consequence of severe mitral annular calcification and not
rheumatic disease. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.

Carotid U/S [**12-26**]: Mild bilateral stenosis of the internal
carotid arteries of less than 40%.

CXR [**1-3**]: A right internal jugular vein approach central venous
line is
present seen to terminate in the upper third of the right
atrium. There is no evidence of pneumothorax on either side.
Comparison with the previous examination shows a local pleural
density in the right mid lung field compatible with some pleural
effusion accumulating in the minor fissure. The lateral pleural
sinuses are free including the diaphragmatic contours and no
acute parenchymal infiltrates can be identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, pt was admitted for surgical management
of her CAD and MS/MR. In addition of the appropriate pre-op
work-up, she underwent a Carotid U/S and Echo (please see
pertinent results). Her PFT's from MWMC were obtained. She
eventually consented to surgery and on [**2118-12-27**] she was brought
to the operating room where she underwent a Coronary Artery
Bypass Graft x 1 and Mitral Valve Replacement (tissue). Please
see op note for surgical details. Pt. tolerated the procedure
well and was transferred to the CSRU in stable condition
receiving Neo-Synephrine and Propofol. Pt remained intubated
overnight and was then weaned from Propofol on post-op day #1
and awoke neurologically intact. She was then weaned from
mechanical ventilation and extubated. Post-op day one pt went
into Atrial Fibrillation and was started on Amiodarone and
Coumadin (already started on Lopressor). Also on this day she
was transfused 1 unit of RBCs. She was stable and slowly
improving and was transferred to the cardiac step down unit on
post op day two. Overnight she had a decrease in both her blood
pressure and urine output and was transferred back to the CSRU.
Again transfused 1 unit pRBCs on this day. Epicardial pacing
wires were removed on post op day 4. She had hemodynamic
improvements but required aggressive pulmonary toilet. She was
gently diuresed to her pre-op weight. On post-op day five she
was then transferred back to the cardiac step down unit. During
entire post op course her cardiac rhythm went in and out if
AFib. At time of discharge she was in sinus rhythm. She was
given Coumadin during her post-op course, but has been held for
last 2 days (INR 3.5). Her goal INR is 1.8. Electrolytes were
repleted and physical therapy followed pt during entire post op
course and treated her accordingly. She was transferred to rehab
facility in stable/good condition on post op day #8. Her INR
should be checked and Coumadin adjusted for goal INR.
