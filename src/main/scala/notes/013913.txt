Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 59-year-old
male with no prior cardiac history noted who presented with
burning chest pain while playing golf approximately three
weeks prior.  The patient denied any symptoms of radiation,
diaphoresis, shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting, but did
note that this burning chest pressure lasted approximately 15
minutes and was relieved with rest.  Evaluation at an outside
hospital with exercise treadmill test showed positive
findings with reversible anterior defect and ejection
fraction of 47%.  The patient thereafter was transferred to
the [**Hospital6 256**] for cardiac
catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypercholesterolemia.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Asthma.
4.  Prostate cancer.
5.  Hernia repair.

ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Lipitor 20 p.o. q.h.s.
3.  Lopressor 50 mg p.o. t.i.d.
4.  Celexa 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5.  Multivitamins.
6.  Albuterol two puffs four times daily.
7.  Singulair 10 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  Advair one puff b.i.d.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  As of [**2167-5-15**], sodium 140,
potassium 4.1, chloride 104, bicarbonate 29, BUN 13,
creatinine 1.0, glucose 94.  White blood cell count 7.3,
platelets 210,000, hematocrit 25.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
97.8, pulse 74, sinus rhythm, blood pressure 111/80,
respirations 12, saturation 97% on room air.  General:  The
patient is a well-developed, well-nourished male in no
apparent distress.  HEENT:  Sclerae was anicteric.  No
evidence of cervical lymphadenopathy.  Mucous membranes
moist.  No evidence of oral ulcers. Cranial nerves, II
through XII, grossly intact.  Chest:  Clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Sternotomy site revealed no evidence of
erythema, no evidence of serosanguinous drainage.  Palpation
of the sternum revealed no evidence of click.  Cardiac:
Regular rate and rhythm.  No evidence of murmur.  No evidence
of rub or click.  Abdomen:  Soft, nondistended, nontender
with positive bowel sounds.  No hepatosplenomegaly, no
inguinal lymphadenopathy.  Extremities:  Mild edema,
symmetric, no evidence of rash noted.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 59-year-old male with no
prior history of coronary artery disease who presented with
positive exercise treadmill test and positive cardiac
catheterization results revealing LMCA distal 50% occlusion
at bifurcation, LAD 90% occlusion at D1, LCX less than 50%
ostial involvement but occluded OM1, RCA severe proximal-mid
disease with midtotal occlusion.

Given these findings, the patient was evaluated for CABG
procedure and underwent an uncomplicated CABG times three
(LIMA to LAD, SVG to DIAG, SVG to RAMUS) on [**2167-5-11**].

Postoperatively, the patient was taken to the CSRU for close
observation.  The patient was promptly extubated upon arrival
to CSRU.  The patient maintained sinus rhythm and good
spontaneous breathing with 100% oxygen saturation on nasal
cannula.

By postoperative day number two, the patient's Neo-Synephrine
was weaned off and the patient's clinical status continued to
improve.  By postoperative day number three, the patient's
Neo-Synephrine was off and the patient continued to do well
despite a low hematocrit of 22.  Although the patient
initially refused transfusion, because the patient began to
develop symptoms of lightheadedness and gait instability, 1
unit was transfused with the patient's final approval.  Post
transfusion, symptoms of dizziness and lightheadedness
resolved.

By postoperative day number four, the patient was evaluated
by Physical Therapy Service to determine whether
rehabilitation placement was necessary.  At this time,
cardiac echocardiogram was also obtained which showed that
the ejection fraction was preserved.  Carotid duplex
revealing no evidence of significant leaking.  The patient
was initiated on Lopressor after blood pressure stabilization
and transferred to the floor.  By postoperative day number
five, the patient's clinical status continued to improve as
the patient achieved level 5 criteria for physical therapy,
meeting the proper criteria to be discharged to home.

At this time, the decision was made to discharge the patient
to home with close follow-up by the Cardiology Service.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Status post coronary artery bypass grafting times three
(LIMA to LAD, SVG to DIAG, SVG to RAMUS).

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Metoprolol 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3.  Instructed to continue with prior regimen of asthmatic
medications.
4.  Iron supplements.
5.  Vitamin C supplements.
6.  Percocet one to two tablets p.o. q. four to six hours
p.r.n. pain.
7.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient was instructed to follow-up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 70**] in six weeks and with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 172**] in seven
days.
