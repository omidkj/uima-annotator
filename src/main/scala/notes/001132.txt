HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 39-year-old state
trooper, who was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of
the left neck, which was resected.  She did well for
approximately a year and about nine months started developing
progressive sensory symptoms over the left neck and jaw.
Initially started with some numbness over the left earlobe
above the surgical site followed by burning sensation in the
jaw.  She then noticed when she brushed her hair behind her
ear, it felt raw.  Pain that went down the neck to the chest
and shoulder area.  For the past month, these symptoms have
been relatively stable without progression.

On direct questioning, she and her husband, who is here with
her cooberates some difficulty with short-term memory which
has worsened in the past year or so.  A MRI scan of the head
shows a third ventricle hyperintense lesion in T1 weighted
images, which does not enhance causing mild-to-moderate
increased size in the lateral ventricles.  There is no
significant transependymal fluid noted on T2 weighted images,
and the cerebellar tonsils are a little bit low lying, but
just at the level of the foramen magnum.  The fourth
ventricle was normal in size and the corporis callosum is
thin throughout relatively uniformly.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical exam, she is awake, alert,
and fully oriented.  Speech is normal and fluent.  Cranial
nerves are normal.  Strength is normal throughout.  Gait is
normal.  Sensory examination reveals some decreased touch
sensation over the left neck posterior to the ear and the
occipital areas as well as along the neck to the upper part
of the anterior chest.  Left neck neuropathic symptoms
concerning for a perineural invasion.

On MRI scan of the head, the third ventricles tumor is an
incidental finding.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] felt that this was most likely a
colloid cyst, and the patient was given an option for VP
shunt and watching colloid cyst or drainage.  Patient opted
for resection of the colloid cyst.

Patient underwent transcallosal resection of the third
ventricle colloid cyst without intraoperative complication.
Postoperatively, the patient was monitored in the ICU without
complication.  Postoperatively, she was monitored in the
Surgical ICU.  There were no intraoperative complications.
Postoperatively, patient was alert, awake, oriented,
following commands.  Motor strength is [**5-15**] in all muscle
groups.  Face is symmetric.  Pupils are equal, round, and
reactive to light.  EOMs were full.  Tongue was midline, good
language skills.  Patient had ventricular drain in place that
was level 10 meters about the tragus draining 45 cc to 10 cc
over postoperative day #2.  Head CT was performed on
[**2124-10-11**].

CT scan showed no hemorrhages, showed good size of ventricles
with decompression of the ventricles.  The vent drain was
removed on [**2124-10-13**], and the patient after having it
clamped which showed no evidence of hydrocephalus, the
patient was transferred to the regular floor on [**2124-10-13**].
She remained neurologically stable.

The patient was discharged home on [**2124-10-14**] for followup
with staple removal on postoperative day #10 and follow up in
the Brain [**Hospital 341**] Clinic in two weeks.

MEDICATIONS AT TIME OF DISCHARGE:
1. Nicotine patch once a day.
2. Percocet 1-2 tablets p.o. q.4h. prn for pain.
3. Dilantin 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. for seven days and then
discontinue.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable at the time of discharge.
