Chief Complaint:
Chest heaviness; transfer from OSH for cath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**9-6**] PICC placement
[**9-11**] CABGx1 (SVG-RCA)


History of Present Illness:
46yo F with h/o atypical CP, and chest heaviness, COPD and
recent diagnosis of "anomalous coronary artery" transferred from
OSH for further evaluation and management of her chest pain in
the setting of this anomalous vessel.  She reports that over the
past 1-2 months, she has developed progressively worsening chest
pressure (not described as pain, but rather describes as
sensation of "someone sitting on chest" and "suffocating") to
the point that it is constantly present.  She notes worsening of
the pressure intermittently (every few days) at which time she
develops chest pain that radiates to her left arm.  She does not
note that this happens at any particular time and reports it
seems "random" and can occur both at rest or with exertion.  She
does, however, notice it more at night when she is lying flat.
She states that the exacerbations (when heaviness becomes pain)
are freq. associated with shortness of breath, nausea and
diaphoresis.  The chest pain episodes are often self limited,
but she reports that she developed anterior, substernal chest
pressure today with pain in the left shoulder assoc. w/ the
above symptoms today while at rest.  The symptoms did not
resolve on their own and, thus, she presented to [**Hospital3 **] ED.
.
Of note, she was cathed recently at [**Hospital3 **] that did not
show flow-limiting coronary artery disease but did reveal
anomalous takeoff of one of the coronaries (? RCA). A CTA
performed in NH reportedly confirms this). She was supposed to
have been cathed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11255**] on Tuesday, but this did not
happen for unclear reason.
.
In the ED at [**Hospital3 **], initial vitals revealed T 97.6 BP
115/72 P 90 R 18 O2sat 98%RA.  EKG revealed NSR at rate of [**Street Address(2) 12592**] depression in V3-V6 as well as II, III, and aVF
(reportedly during CP).  She received IV morphine 4mg x2, NTP
which improved her CP to her baseline "heaviness", and later
reglan for "indigestion".  CXR was performed which was normal
per OSH report.  BNP was sent which was 33 where normal range is
5-100.  CEs were reportedly negative, but I do not see the
actual results in her tx paperwork.


Past Medical History:
# Atypical chest pain/heaviness

system)
# Migraines
# Low vit. D
# Benign tumor compressing right carotid s/p removal in [**2152**]
# s/p C-spine fusion?
# s/p inguinal hernia repair
# s/p TAH/BSO for abnormal vaginal bleeding
# Thyroid nodule s/p surgical removal not on supplementation


Social History:
 Lives alone at home.  Has 7 children, all live locally.  Recent
"messy" divorce in [**2155-5-30**].  +tobacco 0.5-1ppd x31yrs, had
cut down to 1/2 ppd last month, but has increased smoking w/
increased stress over past month.  No EtOH nor other illicits,
no h/o IVDU.


Family History:
Father died at 77 of lymphoma, did have h/o CAD (unsure when
diagnosed), Mother with h/o "angina" and is still living, "most
family" including both parents and siblings w/ HTN, no DM in
parents nor siblings.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2155-9-15**] 4:06 PM
Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in the postoperative
period but cardiac contour has widened since preoperative CXR.
Bibasilar opacities show interval improvement. Small pleural
effusions, left greater than right, appear unchanged. Left PICC
line remains in standard position.

IMPRESSION:
1. Improving bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis. Persistent
small pleural effusions, left greater than right.
2. Postoperative enlargement of cardiac silhouette, likely due
to pericardial effusion given change in size and contour since
the preoperative radiograph.

Brief Hospital Course:
Per report confirmed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who reviewed her scans,
the patient had clean coronaries on a [**2155-6-29**] catheterization
but was found to have an anomalous right coronary artery that
courses between the aorta and pulmonary artery, which could
contribute to her chest pain syndrome. She had a set of negative
cardiac enzymes here. Imdur was continued. She was started on
low-dose metoprolol, and measures were taken to limit extra
oxygen demand, including controlling her chronic pain and
advising her to limit her physical activity.  Her anomalous RCA
was confirmed by MRI.  CT surgery was consulted.
On the night of [**9-2**] her R antecubital IV was found to be
erythematous and painful, with a palpable cord noted.
Superficial thrombophlebitis was confirmed via ultrasound.
Shortly thereafter she spiked a fever to 104.  In this context
she was mildly delirious.  She was initially given acyclovir,
vanco, and cetriaxone.  However, once her fever resolved her
mentation returned to baseline.  However, her blood cultures
grew [**4-2**] MSSA.  Her vanco was switched to nafcillin.  She
defervesced and remained stable thereafter.  TTE demonstrated
normal wall motion and no vegetations.  A right PICC was placed
on [**9-6**].  Follow up cultures were negative.

She was taken to the operating room on [**9-11**] where she underwent
a CABG x 1 with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. She was transferred to the ICU in
critical but stable condition on propofol and phenylephrine
drips.Extubated that evening and transferred to the floor on POD
#1. Hct decreased to 19 on POD #2 and abd CT negative for bleed.
As she was hypotensive, she was transferred back to the CVICU
for closer monitoring. Transferred back to the floor on POD #4
and chest tubes and pacing wires removed without incident.Social
work and chronic pain services were consulted. Pancultured for
fever on POD #5 and PICC removed on POD #6. Made good progress
and cleared for discharge to home with services on POD #6. Pt.
is to make all followup appts. as per discharge instructions.
