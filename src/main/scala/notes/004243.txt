Brief Hospital Course:
Pt. was a same day admit and was brought directly to the
operating room where he underwent an LV lead placement via left
anterior thoracotomy and ICD generator change. Pt. was brought
to the PACU in stable condition and was extubated without
incident. Later on operative day, patient had oxygen
desaturation along with incisional pain and labored breathing.
Oxygen was given via NRB and anesthesia was called. CXR was
obtained which revealed a small left apical pneumothorax,
collapse of the right upper lobe (raises the possibility of a
centrally obstructing mass, and an 1-cm linear density
projecting over the left glenoid. Pt. was eventually converted
to nasal cannula from NRB after better oxygen saturation. On POD
#1 a bronchoscopy was performed and large amount of secretions
was found and RUL plugs suctioned. On POD #2 repeat CXR revealed
changes consistant with the day before. A chest CT was performed
which showed soft tissue mass obstructing the right upper lobe
bronchus causing complete collapse of the right upper lobe with
mediastinal lymphadenopathy, atelectasis in the left lower lobe
likely secondary to secretions, and a very small left-sided
pneumothorax. Thoracic surgery was consulted and saw pt on POD
#3 (see chart for A/P). Recommended multiple radiology
studies(can be done as outpt) and a repeat bronchoscopy with
biopsies. Blood, urine and sputum cultures were taken secondary
to increased WBC. A repeat bronchoscopy was performed on POD #4.
This revealed patent RUL with no obstruction. A TBNA, washing,
and brushing from RUL was sent to cytology. Repeat CT also done
on this day revealed resolution of right upper lobe atelectasis,
with residual patchy ill-defined opacity, and an interval
increase in size of left-sided pneumothorax compared to the CT
scan of [**2120-10-5**]. After cytology results, Thoracic surgery noted
that RUL collapse was likely due to mucus plug and unlikely to
be a malignancy. On POD #5 chest tube was removed. Final CXR
before discharge revealed a small residual left-sided
pneumothorax and previously noted atelectatic changes in the
left lower lung zone and pleural thickening along the left chest
wall are unchanged. On POD #6 pt was doing well. He was
hemodynamically stable with good vital signs and stable labs. He
was discharged home with appropriate f/u appointments.
