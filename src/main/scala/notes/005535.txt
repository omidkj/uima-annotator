Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2279**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
 Ms. [**Known lastname 4248**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old woman with HTN presenting with two
days of worsening dyspnea on exertion. She described that she
initally did not have symptoms at rest, however this on the
morning of presentation she describes dyspnea to the point of
extreme fatigue even with standing still and intermittent left
sided chest discomfort prompting presentation to BIDN ED.
.
  Initial vitals at BIDN were 98.4 83 132/59 20 89% RA and was
noted to have difficulty breathing while lying down. Patient's
presenting EKG showed ST elevations in the inferior leads and
symptoms are initially concerning for unstable angina/ ACS. Her
troponin was noted to be elevated to 0.13 and cardiology at BIDN
advised transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] as she was a potential candidate for
cardiac catheterization. Subsequent CTA, performed prior to
starting anticoagulation, revealed bilateral PEs with evidence
of RV>LV suggestive of right heart strain. CT head was negative
for mass or bleed and the patient was started on a heparin drip
and transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
  At the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vs were 99 86 139/71 20 97% 4LNC. A
chest X-ray was repeated in the ED and revealed no evidence of
congestive heart failure and right-sided calcified pleural
plaques. Repeat labs revealed troponin 0.13, CKMB 7 and WBC of
12.4 with 80% PMNs. The patient was then admitted to the MICU
given convern for right heart strain in the setting of BL PEs.
Vitals on transfer were 98.6 136/76 81 98% 2LNC.
.
On the floor the patient appears comfortable and is without
chest pain, shortness of breath or additional complaints.
.

UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: No evidence of congestive heart
failure. Right-sided calcified pleural plaques.

ECHO: Mildly dilated right ventricle with normal global and
regional biventricular systolic function. Very mild pulmonary
hypertension.

LE DOPPLER: 1. Deep vein thrombosis seen within the left
popliteal and the left posterior tibial veins.  2. Occlusive
thrombus is also noted within the right greater saphenous vein.


CT A/P: 1. A 2 x 3 cm necrotic mass in the tail of the pancreas
most likely represents a primary pancreatic malignancy.  2.
Multiple rim-enhancing lesions within the liver, consistent with
metastases. 3. Upper and lower pole splenic infarcts. 4.
Enhancing nodules within the breast parenchyma bilaterally could
represent metastases versus primary malignancy. Correlation with
mammography may be obtained if clinically indicated.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year-old woman with a history of HTN and remote history of TB
presents with acute onset dyspnea admitted for bilateral
pulmonary emboli found to have evidence of metastatic pancreatic
cancer on CT.

#. Bilateral pulmonary emboli: Patient had evidence of bilateral
pulmonary emboli involving the RML, RUL, LUL nad LLL. There was
a suggestion of right heart strain with flattening on
interventricular septum on chest CT, however bedside ultrasound
in the ED did not reveal evidence of right heart strain. The
patient was started on heparin in the ED. Echocardiogram showed
mildly dilated RV with normal biventricular function. LE
ultrasound showed bilateral DVTs. She was transitioned to
lovenox SC and coumadin on [**12-14**].  She was transferred to the
general medicine floor when stable where she continued to
require 2-3L oxygen by nasal cannula.  Chest CTA at [**Hospital1 **]-N showed
multiple nodules in liver so CT A/P was pursued to work up
possible malignancy as source of PE.  CT A/P showed necrotic
pancreatic tail mass and "numerous hypodense lesions with
peripheral arterial enhancement most consistent with metastases"
in the liver.  In the setting of malignancy, pt was switched to
lovenox for treatment of PE.  She was discharged to rehab due to
her continued O2 requirement.

# suspected metastatic pancreatic cancer: PE work up for
hypercoagulability showed necrotic pancreatic tail mass and
"numerous hypodense lesions with peripheral arterial enhancement
most consistent with metastases" in the liver as mentioned
above. This most likely represents a primary pancreatic
malignancy that has metastasized (especially considered it is a
very clot-prone malignancy).  There are also some breast
calcifications bilaterally but the significance of this is
unknown.  Explained to patient the likelihood that this is a
cancerous process, but that it is difficult to predict prognosis
or treatment options without biopsy.  Pt very distressed and
declined to make any decisions on biopsy at this time.  Pt
discussed options with social work and palliative care and
decided not to pursue any further work-up or treatment and
prefers not to discuss results any further.  She was made aware
that if she developed symptoms such as pain, she could seek
symptomatic treatment at that time.

#. Elevated Troponin: Patient has an elevated troponin to 0.13
at 10AM at BIDN. Follow up troponin at [**Hospital1 18**] at 1PM was 0.13
with CKMB or 7, which was peak level after which it trended
down. Elevated troponin in unlikely to represent ACS and likely
represented right heart strain [**1-31**] PE.

#. HTN: Patient is on Atenolol, Lisinopril and felodipine as an
outpatient. Blood pressure normotensive on admission so
antihypertensives were initially held.  BP trended up so
lisinopril and felodipine were added back
