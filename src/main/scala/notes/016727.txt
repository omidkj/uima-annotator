History of Present Illness:
Per Cardiology Service:
78 yo woman with a PMH of CAD, s/p CABG and PCI, CHF (systolic),
s/p BiV-ICD, AF, DM, HTN, HC, hypothyroidism, CKD, and breast
cancer s/p mastectomy in the 80's presents with chest pain.
This morning she noticed that her vision was slightly blurry
when she was [**Location (un) 1131**] directions on her cereal and her newspaper.
 She was dyspnic walking to her bathroom at home, an activity
that does not typically cause dyspnea.  Later in the morning she
was at [**Hospital **] clinic for a regular appointment when she noted
sudden onset [**8-7**] dull chest pain that radiated to her left arm
and back. This was associated with mild SOB and lightheadedness
when pain was at its worst, but no nausea, vomiting, change in
vision or diaphoresis.  She affirms that this pain and
lightheadedness is very similar to her prior presentations,
including this [**Month (only) 956**].
.
Of note, per her Cardiologist, the patient has chronic chest
discomfort, which awakens her at night and is always present.
There is no exacerbation with her minimal physical activity and
it can last for up to hours at a time.  She does not note any
exacerbation with food intake and differentiates this from her
typical "heartburn," which is more of a burning sensation in the
mid chest.  She also notes that there is sometimes a sensation
of food getting stuck when she is trying to swallow.
.
She was hospitalized in late [**Month (only) 956**] with left-sided chest pain
and black stool.  Troponins were negative, no EKG changes.
During that admission EGD revealed no bleeding but did show
candidal esophageal infection.  She was seen in the ED on [**3-10**]
for chest pain, again cardiac enzymes negative.  Pharmacologic
stress test showed no change and she was d/c without admission.
She last saw her cardiologist on [**3-19**] for a post-discharge visit
at which time she was noted to be volume overloaded.  She also
complained of chronic chest pain at that time, and anti-fungal
treatment with fluconazole was recommended.  The patient states
that she used "some antibiotic" that completed its course "a
while ago", but does not recall the name or timing.  On [**3-20**] she
was switched from warfarin to dabigatran for anti-coagulation,
although the patient believes that dabigatran was later stopped.
 Per clinic notes, she reported chest pain in late [**Month (only) 958**] ([**3-25**],
[**3-26**]) and requested additional NTG tablets.  By her report she
uses these tablets perhaps once a week, 2-3 tablets per chest
pain episode.  She does not believe that the pace of her chest
pain worsened over [**Month (only) 958**].  On [**3-26**] she complained of weakness
and her VNA noted she was pale; she also notes that about this
time she started to have increased dyspnea on exertion, such
that walking shorter distances caused her to be short of breath.
 Prior to this time she could walk from her apartment to her car
without dyspnea, but in the last week she could no longer do
this.  On [**3-31**] her VNA reported volume overload and her Lasix was
restarted at 40mg daily.
.
Today she was given ASA, NTG x2 at [**Last Name (un) **] prior to presentation.
In the ED, initial vitals were 97.8 81 135/55 16 100% RA.  EKG
showed ST depressions in V1 and V2, troponin < 0.01.  Started on
heparin gtt, nitro gtt, Plavix loaded with 600mg, ASA 325,
morphine 5mg IV.
.
Per report, her catheterization showed that 2 of her 3 CABG
grafts are occluded.  The SVT to OM graft remains patent.  No
intervention was performed.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient complains of a sensation of
urinary urgency, but denies chest pain or dyspnea.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
Positive for orthopnea (wedge and pillow, unchanged), feeling
cold, lightheadedness on standing.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis. She
denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional
buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were
negative.  Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope.
