CHEST SINGLE PORTABLE: Comparison is made to [**2130-12-3**].
Heart size is normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are
unremarkable. The lungs are clear. There are no pleural
effusions or pneumothorax. Visualized osseous structures are
unremarkable.
.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 18741**] is a 52 yr old female with type 1 DM, HTN, Asthma,
chronic migraines, RA, HTN admitted with DKA in setting of med
non compliance.

# DKA: Patient reports not taking her meds [**2-22**] depression,
recent illness and simply not wanting to continue taking
medication. No clear source of infection, neg UA, clear CXR. ?
abd source given localized abd pain radiation to back. Other
possible exacerbating factors include CAD, hyperthyroidism.
Cardiac enzymes were negative x 3 however patient with evidence
of lateral ischemia with TWI on EKG associated with tachycardia,
noted in lateral leads I, avL, V5-6. Patient also with vague
complaints of ?angina, chest discomfort with exertion. Patient
likely needs an outpatient stress test in the near future for
further work up. Patient was initially managed in the MICU with
insulin gtt, FS q 1 hr and aggressive IVF hydration with closure
of the anion gap. After one night in the unit, patient was
transfered to the floor with good control. Patient followed by
[**Last Name (un) **] who managed the patient with NPH insulin and Humanlog
sliding scale.  At the time of discharge, she was achieving
decent sugar control on her consistent carbohydrate diet.  She
will follow up with [**Last Name (un) **] as an outpatient.  At the time of
discharge, the patient voiced understanding that she really
needed to maintain good sugar control to prevent another
occurrence of the events leading to this hospitalization.
.
# Chest Pain - Patient with new EKG changes, TWI in lateral
leads I, aVL, V5-6, ?demand ischemia in setting of tachycardia
vs. new ischemic event precipitating DKA. CE negative x 1 on
admission. Patient relays symptoms somewhat suggestive of
angina, chest tightness on exertion with sob, diaphoresis,
radiation to arm. ?difficult to interpret in setting of DM, as
well as the patient's inconsistent reports.  Repeat enzymes
remained flat.  The patient will need to follow up as an
outpatient for stress testing and coronary risk stratification.
.
# Abd Pain: Ongoing complaints x many months, crampy pain,
periumbilical and pelvic, likely fibroids vs. pancreatitis vs.
PUD. Lipase elevated on admission to 245, trending down to
normal likely in setting of DKA, tolerating POs but with
relatively poor intake. Continued on PPI. Her intake improved
somewhat leading up to discharge.  She expressed awareness that
she needed to keep her PO intake consistent to prevent problems
with her glucose management.  She was instructed to follow up
her abdominal pain as an outpatient with EGD/colonoscopy, and
possible pelvic ultrasound.  Patient experienced some
improvement with Reglan during her stay.
.
# Neuropathic pain/Neuropathy - patient c/p
burning/tingling/numbness in legs, also ?gastroparesis given
history of vomiting.  Continued on Tramadol, started Neurontin
[**Hospital1 **].  This medication will likely take time to work, and
effectiveness of this regimen can be evaluated and titrated as
an outpatient.
.
#. Graves' Disease: Patient taking methimazole as outpatient,
although there is concern regarding her medication compliance.
This could account for her elevated free T4 on screening in
house. Will continue current methimazole dose for now, will need
to recheck as outpatient.
.
#. GERD: Will continue P
