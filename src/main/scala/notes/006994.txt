was an acute MI. She continued to have chest pain on admission
and in the cath lab.

Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  30%  >= 55%

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement. No spontaneous echo contrast
is seen in the LAA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection velocity.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Normal
interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size.
Moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction. Depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Reduced RV systolic
function.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Moderate
calcification of aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter.
Moderate calcification in ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch
diameter.  Atheroma in aortic arch. Normal descending aorta
diameter. Severe, complex (mobile) atheroma in the descending
aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. No AS. Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Severe
mitral annular calcification. No MS. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Moderate to severe [3+] TR. Eccentric TR jet.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.
Dilated main PA.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient. See Conclusions for post-bypass data

Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with EF of less than 30%.
3. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Right
ventricular systolic function is depressed.
4. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
severe, complex (mobile) atheroma in the descending aorta. 5.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
severe mitral annular calcification. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
7. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid regurgitation jet is eccentric and may be
underestimated.
8. The main pulmonary artery is dilated.
9. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

1st POST-BYPASS: Pt is being AV paced on an infusion of
phenylephrine and epinephrine
1. RV is mild - moderately hypokinetic, LV inferior wall appears
moderately hypokinetic,
RV function worsened requiring return to CPB
2. TR appears slightly improved, while MR appears slightly worse

2Nd POST - BYPASS: Pt is being AV paced on an infusion of
Norepinephrine, epinephrine, Vasopressin and milrinone
1. RV function appears slightly improved and LV inferior wall is
slightly improved
2. Aorta is Intact post decannulation
3. Other findings are unchanged
I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

?????? [**2183**] CareGroup

Brief Hospital Course:
Cath revealed severe 3VD and a poor ejection fraction (30%) with
anterior and inferior near akinesis and RV dysfunction. Pt.
noted to have a depressed cardiac index (1.8 l/min/m2) and a
mixed venous saturation of 40% and a pH of 7.18, in addition to
RV dysfunction. She had severe peripheral vascular disease with
toruous iliac arteries, a severely disease descending thoracic
and abdomenal aorta and weak pulses, so it was felt by
cardiology that the patient would not tolerate having an IABP
placed due to the seveve vascular disease. Her BP was around 100
mmHg in the OR, but this may be been falsely elevated because of
vasoconstriction and her history of severe hypertension. Cardiac
surgery consulted, and pt. taken emergently from cath lab to OR
for CABG x3. She had significant bleeding due to plavix.
Initially in the OR she did reasonably well after surgery on
inotropic support. However, she then had hypotension and
arrested while still in the OR, mainly due to RV failure. Her
chest was reopened with subsequent additional CABG x1. An IABP
was insertion with difficult because of failure to separate from
CPB. The patient was transferred to the CVICU in serious
condition on vasopressin, milrinone, epinephrine, levophed and
propofol drips.

She remained acidotic despite treatment and was difficult to
pace. Additonal skin lead placed at bedside. Abdomen became firm
and distended and lactate was [**11-23**].
She continued to deteriorate and her chest was opened at the
bedside for continuing hypotension. There was no improvement in
her vital signs and the family and chaplain were called. Family
requested withdrawal of care, her SBP was in the 50's,and a
morphine drip was started. IABP and pacer turned down, and pt.
quickly deteriorated. Expired at 04:49 on [**4-10**] with family
present. They d
