CHIEF COMPLAINT:  This is an 83 year old lady with a history
of congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation on
anticoagulation and recent placement of a biventricular
pacemaker on [**2141-1-19**].  She presented through the Emergency
Room status post two falls at home.  The patient had been
feeling well until the day prior to admission.  At that time,
the patient had a fall while going to the bathroom, during
which she reports she slipped on the tile and fell onto her
back.  On the day of admission, the patient again fell in the
kitchen, saying that she slipped on a piece of food. The
patient denied any loss of consciousness, dizziness,
palpitations or head trauma.  In addition, she denied fevers,
chills, cough, rashes, shortness of breath, and chest pain.

In the Emergency Department, the patient had a chest x-ray
which showed near complete opacification in the left
hemithorax with mild shift of the trachea and mediastinum to
the right. The right lung was clear.  A CT scan was
subsequently performed to correlate these findings.  It
showed a high attenuation of fluid filling the left
hemithorax.  There was minimal linear scarring in the right
posterior medial lung base.  These findings were suggestive
of a large left hemithorax which reaches a slightly higher
attenuation in the apex, suggesting a bleed adjacent to this
location.  However, there was no clear active extravasation
at this site.  There was also a small hematoma visualized
adjacent to the pacemaker insertion site.  At that time, the
patient was admitted to the medical Intensive Care Unit for
further care.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Congestive heart failure.  Echocardiogram performed on
[**2141-1-23**] showed an ejection fraction of 45%.  The left and
right atrium were mildly dilated.  Overall left ventricular
systolic function was mildly depressed.  There was mild to
moderate 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation.  Moderate to severe 3+
tricuspid regurgitation.  A small to moderate sized
pericardial effusion was visualized. There was no evidence of
tamponade.
2.  Atrial fibrillation.  The patient was anticoagulated on
admission.
3.  Status post placement of biventricular pacemaker on
[**2141-1-19**].
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Depression.
6.  Status post cholecystectomy.
7.  Status post appendectomy.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin which causes hives.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Co-Reg 25 mg p.o. twice a day.
2.  Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q. day.
3.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. q. day.
4.  Prilosec 20 mg p.o. q. day.
5.  Wolfram.
6.  Lomoxin.
7.  Spironolactone.
8.  Multi-vitamin tablets.
9.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q. day.
10. Nitroglycerin patch .1 at night.
11. Salicylate 500 mg twice a day.
12. Lexapro 10 mg p.o. q. day.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone downstairs from her
son.  She is widowed.  She is working part time at a
laboratory in [**Hospital3 1810**].   She denies tobacco,
alcohol or illicit drugs.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 96.4; heart rate 80; blood
pressure 94/34; respiratory rate 20; oxygen saturation 97% on
six liters nasal cannula.  General:  Pleasant, elderly lady,
lying in bed, in no acute distress.  HEAD, EYES, EARS, NOSE
AND THROAT: Normal cephalic, atraumatic. Pupils are equal,
round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular
movements intact.  Clear moist oropharynx.  Neck: JVP at 9
cm, supple, without bruits. Cardiac:  Regular rate and
rhythm; soft; 2/6 systolic ejection murmur best heard at the
base.  Pulmonary:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally with
decreased breath sounds at the left base.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, non distended.  Positive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  1+ edema of the ankles bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count of 21.3; hematocrit
of 31.3; platelets 224.  Differential showed 88 neutrophils,
8 lymphocytes and 3 monocytes.  Chemistry revealed a sodium
of 135; potassium of 4.4; chloride of 96; bicarbonate of 24;
BUN 26; creatinine 2.0, elevated from a baseline of .8 and
glucose of 142.  CK 188; CK MB 13; troponin T 0.75.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Hemothorax.  The patient was found to have a large, left
sided hemothorax on CT scan.  On the evening of admission,
she was admitted to the medical Intensive Care Unit for
further treatment.  Her anticoagulation was reversed at that
time.  The case was discussed with both interventional
pulmonary and CT surgery.  On [**2141-1-24**], the patient went for a
VATS procedure and was placed at the left sided chest tube.
There was almost immediate drainage of 2.7 liters of
serosanguinous fluid.  The chest tube continued to drain
slowly over the next two days.  During the VATS procedure, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] was visualized in the subclavian vein, which was thought
to be the source of the patient's hemothorax in the setting
of her anticoagulation.  The chest tube was removed on the
evening of [**2141-1-26**].  The patient tolerated the chest tube
well.  A small, apical, left sided pneumothorax was
visualized on chest x-ray which resolved after the chest tube
was removed.  The patient's anticoagulation was held
throughout the admission, in light of her hemothorax.

2.  Hypotension.  The patient was hypotensive on admission
with systolic blood pressures in the 90's.  This resolved
with intravenous fluids and transfusion obtained of packed
red blood cells.  Following the VATS procedure, the patient
was restarted on her antihypertensive medications.
Subsequently, she once again became hypotensive.  This
resolved with discontinuation of the blood pressure
medication and intravenous fluids.  On [**2141-1-25**], she was
started back on her Co-Reg and her ace inhibitor was
restarted on [**2141-1-26**].  These were slowly titrated up as
tolerated, to control blood pressure throughout the remainder
of the admission.

3.  Congestive heart failure.  This was not an active issue
for the patient during her admission.  She was continued on
her Digoxin.  Her beta blocker and Lasix were re-added as her
blood pressure allowed.

4.  Atrial fibrillation.  The patient is status post
placement of a biventricular pacemaker on [**2141-1-19**].  She had a
regular paced rhythm throughout admission.  Anticoagulation
was reversed and then held in the setting of her hemothorax.

5.  Acute renal failure. The patient had acute renal failure
on admission to the hospital.  This was thought to be
secondary to dehydration.  Her creatinine trended down to
baseline with intravenous fluids.

6.  Diarrhea.  The patient developed diarrhea on the evening
of [**2141-1-26**]. A Clostridium difficile has been sent and is
currently pending.

7.  Status post falls.  Question whether her falls are
mechanical in nature, as the patient describes or secondary
to possible orthostatic hypotension.  Physical therapy and
occupational therapy are currently evaluating the patient for
home services versus rehabilitation.

8.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition.  The patient was on a
cardiac diet throughout the admission.  Her electrolytes were
repleted as needed.

9.  Prophylaxis.  PPI's, bowel regimen, Pneumoboots.
