Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) 64438**] is an 80 yo F with h/o HCV, COPD, and GERD
admitted with BRBPR.

# LGIB: NG lavage negative.  BRBPR possibly from diverticular
bleed. She remained hemodynamically stable and the bleed had
resolved by the time she was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. EGD revealed
antral gastritis and a colonoscopy showed diverticulosis (bowel
prep was not adequate, so a complete study could not be
performed).  She was treated with IV PPI [**Hospital1 **].  The patient was
observed over the weekend and had stable Hct between 28-31.  She
had a repeat colonoscopy on [**5-6**] which showed diverticulosis but
no active bleed was found.  No bleeding lesions were seen.  She
was restarted on a regular diet and tolerated this well prior to
discharge.  She was transitioned to Pantoprazole 40mg daily on
discharge.   She was also instructed to stop naprosyn given her
EGD report with antral gastritis.  She can follow up with her
PMD regarding restarting naprosyn in the future.

She has follow up appointment scheduled with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 26211**] on
[**5-14**] with CBC check at that time as well.  She will also
follow up with GI in [**2193-5-16**].

# HCV: Previously followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Coags normal
indicating good liver synthetic function.

# HTN: Lisinopril intially held for GIB, restarted when BP
stable. This was restarted at her home dose on the floor.

# H/O IVDU: Has been on methadone for 40 years.  She was
continued on her methadone dose of 120mg daily.

# COPD: Advair was continued

# Hypothyroidism: Levothyroxine was continued

# Osteoporosis: Vitamin D and calcium was restarted on discharge

# GERD: As above, the pt was started on IV pantoprazole 40mg
[**Hospital1 **], then transitioned to 40mg daily

# Smoking dependence: Nicotine patch

# Code status:  RESUSCITATE but DO NOT INTUBATE (confirmed with
patient).
The patient was encouraged to either be entirely full code or
DNR/DNI.  She will discuss further with her son at a later time
and reconsider.
