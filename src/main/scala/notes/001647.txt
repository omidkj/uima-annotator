2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2151-3-31**] demonstrated:
Conclusions: EF 30-35%
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed with global hypokinesis. Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. There is
mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is at least mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Admission CXR
IMPRESSION:
1) Right mainstem bronchus intubation; this has been corrected
on the
subsequent chest radiograph.
2) Complete opacification of the left hemithorax with volume
loss from
collapse due to the malpositioned endotracheal tube.
3) Evidence of congestive heart failure/volume overload with a
moderate right pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 64 y/o with CHF, hx CABG (LIMA-LAD, SVG-RCA, jump
SVG-RI-OM occluded), DM, htn, hypercholesterolemia, presented
with hypertensive urgency, pulmonary edema, s/p intubation and
successful extubation, as well as metabolic acidosis, likely DKA
versus lactic acidosis
.
MICU course significant for rapid extubation in < 24 hours with
diuresis. Patient's blood pressure was controlled with ACE-I,
HCTZ and metoprolol.
.
1. Cardiac: Patient with history of CAD including CABG, most
stents occluded, presented with progressive dyspnea, pulmonary
edema and DKA.  Her troponins were slightly elevated on
admission, likely secondary to demand from CHF exacerbation and
pulmonary edema.  She was evaluated by cardiology in the unit
who recommended medical management including optimization of her
blood pressure medications.  She remained chest pain free and
shortness of breath much improved after diuresis.  She was
maintained on ASA, BB, ACE-I, Statin and plavix, and her blood
pressure medications were titrated upwards as tolerated.  LVEF
depressed to 30%, likely in setting of acute pulm edema versus
new onset CHF from acute event. She was started on lasix for
improved diuresis and was weaned off oxygen prior to discahrge.
Repeat CXR showed improvement of pulmonary edema.
.
2. Respiratory failure: Now resolved, likely secondary to
pulmonary edema. Acute episodes of shortness of breath may have
been secondary to elevated BP, DKA, difficult to tell what was
inciting factor. Not likely to be secondary to acute ischemic
event, as above.  Repeat CXR showed improvement of pulmonary
edema.  She was weaned off oxygen.
.
3. DM: [**3-3**], Hb A1C 16.5%. DKA on admission, gap has now closed.
 [**Last Name (un) **] following during hospital course, recs appreciated.
.
4. Dispo: In good condition to home, ambulating without an
oxygen requirement
