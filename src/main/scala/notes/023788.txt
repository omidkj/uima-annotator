LEFT FOOT, TWO VIEWS [**2195-1-13**]
There is a large skin defect overlying the posteroinferior
calcaneus. However, the calcaneus is within normal limits,
without evidence of osteomyelitis. A small inferior calcaneal
spur is noted. Probable diffuse osteopenia, but no focal bone
destruction.

ANKLE (AP, MORTISE & LAT) RIGHT  [**2195-1-13**]
Considerable periosteal new bone formation along the mid and
distal fibula and tibia, with some surrounding soft tissue
edema. Differential diagnosis includes reactive changes,
hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, and osteomyelitis. Osteomyelitis
is considered somewhat less likely given the diffuse nature of
the abnormality, but should be correlated with clinical
findings.

BIOPSY RESULTS
Fascia, left thigh, biopsy [**2195-1-17**]
Fibrous and adipose tissue with perivascular chronic
inflammation
Culture
STENOTROPHOMONAS (XANTHOMONAS) MALTOPHILIA
TRIMETHOPRIM/SULFA----   <=1 S


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the SICU on [**1-12**] after transfer from
OSH for rapidly worsening infection of LLE.  He was started on
broad spectrum triple antibiotic therapy and maintained on the
ventilator.  His vent was able to be weaned and he was extubated
on [**1-13**].  Plastic surgery and podiatric surgery were consulted
for further management of extensive wounds.  His antibiotics
were narrowed on [**1-16**] to clindamycin and oxacillin for outside
hospital culture data showing staph aureus (MSSA). Incision and
wash-out of left lower extremity was performed on [**1-17**].  A
tissue biopsy was sent to pathology and for culture at that
time.  Culture results were positive for stenotrophomonas
maltophilia sensitive to bactrim.  This [**Doctor Last Name 360**] was added to his
antibiotic regimen on [**1-23**].  A vac was placed on [**1-20**] and
continued with changes every 2-3days.

On [**1-26**] plastic surgery performed a split thickness skin graft
from left and right thigh to the LLE.  A vac dressing was in
place for 5 days post-op.  On POD5 the vac was taken down and
the graft noted to have taken well with good granulation.  Twice
daily dressing changes were performed with iodoform covering new
graft, then kerlex wrapping, then an ACE bandage wrapped.  The
donor sites also had iodoform but these sites were left open to
air and the edges have been trimmed as they loosen.  Please do
not remove iodoform from thighs but continue to trim edges as
they curl away from skin.

Patient also has an area of superficial denuded tissue at right
upper gluteal approx 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm with yellow base.  Wound
care followed the patient and recommended turning side to side q
1-2 hours; [**Hospital1 **] & prn bowel movement cleanse pt gluteals with
foam cleanser and pat dry applying double guard ointment then
aloe vesta barrier cream.
