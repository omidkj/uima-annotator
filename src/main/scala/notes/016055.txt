CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: r/o ptx s/p ct's removed

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
78 year old man with
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o ptx s/p ct's removed
AP CHEST, 2:16 P.M. [**12-7**]

HISTORY: Chest tube removal. Rule out pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**12-5**]:

Following tracheal extubation, lung volumes are substantially
lower which may account for increased bibasilar atelectasis and
vascular engorgement of both the lungs and the mediastinum.
Nevertheless, volume overload should be investigated. Small left
pleural effusion has increased. No pneumothorax. Right jugular
line ends centrally.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection
velocity.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Moderate symmetric LVH. Normal LV
cavity size. Severely depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Moderate global RV
free wall hypokinesis.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch
diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. Normal
descending aorta diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AS. Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. Physiologic MR (within normal
limits).

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Physiologic TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient.
Conclusions
Pre Grafting
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated.
2. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
3. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (LVEF= 25-30 %). There is severe dysfunction of the
inferior wall.
4. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is
mild-moderate global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
5. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There
are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
6. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
7. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen.
8. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.

Post-Grafting The patient is receiving dobutamine by infusion.
There are no significant changes from the pre-grafting study.


Brief Hospital Course:
He was taken to the operating room on [**12-5**] where he underwent an
off pump CABG x 4. He was transferred to the ICU in critical but
stable condition on neosynephrine and dopamine infusions. He was
extubated the morning of POD #1.  He was weaned from his
vaosactive drips and transferred to the floor on POD #2. He did
well postoperatively and was ready for discharge on POD #5.
