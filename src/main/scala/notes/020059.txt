Allergies:
Penicillins / Phenergan / Aldactone / Digoxin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 832**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
83 year-old female with COPD not on home O2 and ESRD on dialysis
presents acutely worsening dyspnea in the setting of a 2 day
history of productive cough and chills. The patient was in her
usual state of health until two days prior to admission, when
she was undergoing outpatient dialysis for her ESRD.  At the
completion of her treatment, she suddenly experienced chills.
She attended her birthday party later in the day but began to
experience a worsening cough productive of clear, colorless
sputum.  On the day prior to admission, she felt extremely tired
and spent the day in bed.  By the evening, she had begun to
experience dyspnea, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, night sweats
and had one episode of loose stool.  By the morning, she felt
significantly dyspneic and was driven to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED by her
husband.  [**Name (NI) **] associated chest pain, orthopnea, or PND.
.
Of note, the patient was hospitalized last month with a negative
workup for mesenteric ischemia. She has also had a colonoscopy
last week in addition to her thrice weekly dialysis sessions.
.
In the ED, the patient presented with 97.8 87 164/54 24 83% RA.
The patient triggered on arrival for oxygen saturation 83%RA;
she improved to 94% with nebulizer, oxygen therapy. Physical
examination was notable for poor air movement, rhonchi in the
left upper and lower lung fields, and bibasilar crackles. Her
laboratory data was significant for leukocytosis with left
shift/bands, creatinine 4.6 (known ESRD), troponin 0.04
(baseline), and lactate of 2.2.  Chest XR showed left sided
pulmonary infiltrates.  She was given nebs, solumedrol,
vancoymycin, levofloxacin, and ASA.  VS prior to transfer:
afebrile 102 149/49 14 96% 3L.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI.  Headache associated with her cough that has now
resolved.  Reports one month of rhinorrhea.
(-) No [**Last Name (un) **] congestion.  Denies diarrhea, hematuria, or dysuria.

ECG [**2200-11-16**]:
Sinus tachycardia. Inferolateral lead ST-T wave abnormalities
suggest
myocardial ischemia. Clinical correlation is suggested. Since
the previous
tracing of same date sinus tachycardia and further ST-T wave
changes are both now present.
.
CXR (AP) [**2200-11-16**]:
CHEST, SINGLE VIEW: A right-sided dual-channel central venous
catheter has
tip projecting over the cavoatrial junction. Multiple median
sternotomy wires appear intact. There is prominent alveolar
opacity projecting over the mid- to-lower left lung, with air
bronchograms, suggestive of consolidation. Prominent
interstitial markings in the lung bases appear similar as
compared to [**2198**]. No large effusion is detected. Cardiomegaly is
unchanged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. Aortic
arch calcification is noted.
.
IMPRESSION:
1) Findings concerning for left pulmonary consolidation,
consistent with
pneumonia.
2) Recommend follow-up CXR in [**4-22**] weeks after appropriate
treatment, to
confirm resolution.
.
TTE [**2200-11-17**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the
basal inferior wall. The remaining segments contract normally
(LVEF >55 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**1-18**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
prominent fat pad.
.
IMPRESSION: Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Very mild
regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Compared with the prior
study (images reviewed) of [**2198-4-2**], regional and global left
ventricular systolic function is improved and the estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now lower.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
83-year-old female with hx of CAD s/p 5v CABG, COPD, ESRD on HD,
chronic diastolic CHF (EF 45-50%), DM, and PVD presenting with
dyspnea, productive cough and chills and found to have left
mid/lower PNA. Hospital course complicated by hyperglycemia, CHF
exacerbation, and elevated troponins suggestive of ?NSTEMI vs.
demand ischemia.
.
#. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Respiratory distress likely
multifactorial in nature, most influenced by PNA and acute on
chronic CHF exacerbation. Patient also has history of COPD which
was probably a less important factor in current status.  CXR
showed left mid/lower consolidation as well as rapidly evolving
right sided consolidation.  She was treated for Hospital
Acquired Pneumonia given recent hospital admission and dialysis
sessions with vancomycin and cefepime (day 1 = [**2200-11-16**]);
