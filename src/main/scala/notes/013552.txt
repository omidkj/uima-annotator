Chief Complaint:
cc:[**CC Contact Info **]
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP w/ removal of CBD stent and sphincterotomy
intubation for hypoxia and ICU admission


History of Present Illness:
72 yo male with multiple sclerosis on chronic steroids admitted
for elective CBD stent removal [**2191-2-2**], developed mild bleeding
post-sphincerotomy and now had episode of hypotension (sbp 70s)
in the setting of a 7 point hct drop (although his hct may have
been slightly hemoconcentrated on admission).  Initially
presented [**11-13**] with ascending cholangitis that required abx and
CBD stent placement.  He has been doing well since that
admission.  His hct in [**11-13**] was in low 30s, however, today was
37.2 prior to procedure.  During the ERCP he had an episode of
desaturation to 70s.  His old stent was removed, he underwent a
sphincterotomy and placement of a new stent.  He received
flumazenil and naloxone after he became hypoxic.  His oxygen
sats have been normal since then on 2liters NC.
At 3:30am he developed acute onset sbp in 70s and ST to 140s
that responded to a few hundred cc of IVFs.  He had an og lavage
that showed cherry cola colored fluid that did not clear after
1200cc.  After OGT removed, had 100cc emesis.  Concern was for
upper gi bleed and airway protection so he was transferred to
the ICU for closer monitoring.

prednisone and hypdrocortisone.

on home o2.
# "neurogenic bladder" by records but symptoms seem more
consistent with BPH- dribbling and difficulty initiating
urination
# [**Month/Day (1) **] cancer: s/o resection 10 years ago, no adjunctive
treatment
# osteomyelitis of left hip as child- left with difficulty
walking for life but did not need cane

Brief Hospital Course:
72 yo male with hx of MS, ascending cholangitis, s/p
cholecystectomy, COPD and RUL resection for benign mass who
presented for outpatient elective removal of CBD stent
complicated by hypoxia and bleeding after sphincterotomy.

Hypotension/GI bleed - Hypotension was secondary to significant
GI bleed. Pt received 10 units pRBCs, 3 units FFP, and IVF for a
total of 13L fluid resuscitation.  GI performed EGD which showed
old blood but no active bleeding site.  He had been started on
stress dose steroids on floor given chronic steroid use and
probable baseline adrenal insufficiency. This was continued
initially but once stable, was quickly tapered to home dose.  He
then received IV lasix for diuresis given volume load during
resucitation.  His Hct remained stable, and he did not require
any further transfusions - the source of his GI bleed remained
unclear.

Tachycardia/afib - Pt with episode of atrial fibrillation on
telemetry on [**2-6**]. Initially unclear if it was tachycardia
causing hypotension or vice versa. However, he had 5L UOP for
the day, looked dry on exam, and so he was given IVF first with
immediate improvement of BP to 110s/70s, HR slowed initially to
110s-130s, then converted to sinus rhythm after an addition
500cc bolus. This was most likely caused by hypovolemia. He was
hydrated and lytes were repleted, and he remained in sinus
rhythm.  Continued treatment for underlying infection as below.

Ventilatory support - Pt was intubated given hypotension and
respiratory distress.  He received fluid resuscitation as
described above and once stable, was extubated after SBT and
rsbi of 30.  Unclear cause of hypoxia although hypervolemia due
to fluid resuscitation was on the differential. Pt was breathing
comfortably on RA at time of discharge.

PNA - Pt with likely pneumonia given RUL opacity on exam. Sputum
grew pseudomonas; pt clinically stable.  He was given empiric
treatment with vanco and zosyn for 7 days, with subsequent
decrease in sputum production and resolution of leukocytosis.

Biliary stent - LFT's stabilized. Not thought to have biliary
source for sepsis. Will need repeat ERCP at some point as
outpatient for removal of stent. Tolerating PO at time of
discharge.

COPD - On inhalers while intubated and changed over to nebs
after extubation.  Held albuterol given tachycardia.  He was
also given steroids for MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] adrenal insufficiency.

thrombocytopenia - DIC labs wnl, concern for HIT so avoided all
heparin products. HIT ab was sent which was found to be
negative.

MS - Pt is bedbound given acute illness. He was given a steroid
taper and arranged for outpatient services.

PPx - He was given PPI, bowel regimen, and pneumoboots for
prophylaxis.
