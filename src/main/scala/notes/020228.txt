HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 78-year-old male
with history of coronary artery disease status post CABG in
[**2116**] and [**2126**] with PTCA of his SVG to PL branch on [**2136-1-24**]
here at [**Hospital3 **], history of COPD, history of
obstructive-sleep apnea, hypertension, and
hypercholesterolemia, who presented with unstable angina,
symptoms of increased chest pain and shortness of breath with
exertion at [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital and was transferred here
for catheterization, and was treated with stent to the SVG to
the posterolateral branch on [**1-24**].  Noted to have recurrent
chest pain with walking post catheterization and had a second
episode of recurrent chest pain, which awoke him from sleep
on the morning of the 21st.

Pain is similar to his prior anginal chest pain lasting about
20 minutes and was relieved with two sublingual
nitroglycerins.  Patient had no EKG changes and his cardiac
enzymes are negative.  His pain is left sided associated with
shortness of breath and nausea.  No diaphoresis.  At
baseline, the patient reports no orthopnea or paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, although he does have some chronic lower
extremity edema with prolonged standing.

At the outside hospital, patient was also noted to have
prolonged P-R interval with secondary A-V block with a
Wenckebach block and a left bundle branch block.  EP service
was consulted while he was here and the patient had a
pacemaker ICD placement.

EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.1, T max 98.1, heart rate 70,
blood pressure 110-122/64-70, respirations 16, and saturating
99% on 2 liters.  Generally:  He is in no acute distress,
alert and oriented times three.  HEENT:  Mucous membranes are
moist.  No jugular venous distention.  Cardiovascular:
Regular rate and rhythm with a [**1-13**] holosystolic murmur at the
apex.  Pulmonary:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, and nondistended, normoactive
bowel sounds.  Extremities are without edema.

LABORATORIES:  White count 12.5, hematocrit 27.2, platelets
204.  Sodium 135, potassium 3.6, chloride 98, bicarb 27, BUN
37, creatinine 2.4, glucose 99, calcium 9.0, phosphorus 4.1,
magnesium 2.1.  CK is 191, MB is 4.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Second degree A-V block, Wenckebach block at the outside
hospital, also left bundle branch block, which were new
concerning for ischemia.  The EP service was consulted after
the patient was transferred from [**Hospital3 417**], and the
patient underwent ICD pacer placement, and remained with a
paced rhythm.

2. Coronary artery disease:  Patient presented with shortness
of breath and unstable angina at [**Hospital3 417**], and he was
ruled out for myocardial infarction.  But his EKG revealed a
new Wenckebach, second degree A-V block, and left bundle
branch block with T-wave inversion in aVF, V4 through V6, and
he was transferred here for catheterization on [**1-24**] during
which he had a PTCA on his SVG to PL.  He had an episode of
chest pain post catheterization and a small groin ecchymosis.

He had a second episode of chest pain on the 21st in the
morning similar to his anginal pain, which was relieved with
two sublingual nitroglycerins.  There were no EKG changes and
his cardiac enzymes remained negative, although he continued
to have substernal chest pain at rest on the 22nd while on
both Heparin and nitroglycerin drips.  His CKs began to
increase and his troponin-T at that time was 2.93.  This was
felt likely to be a complication of his catheterization and
likely secondary to distal embolization and an inferior MI.
He was taken back for catheterization on [**1-30**], during which
he had PTCA to his SVG to PDA with sluggish flow.  A bare
metal stent was placed.

The patient had recurrent chest pain on the floor, and his
CKs continued to rise.  He was transferred to the CCU for
close monitoring perimyocardial infarction for two days.  A
left groin bruit was also noted.  An ultrasound showed a left
groin A-V fistula.  His CKs were downtrending on [**3-1**] and he
was off nitroglycerin drip with occasional chest pain at
rest.  His medical therapy was maximized.  His Imdur was also
increased, and he was discharged home on aspirin, Plavix,
beta-blocker, Imdur, ACE inhibitor, and statin to followup
with his outpatient cardiologist.

3. COPD and obstructive-sleep apnea:  Patient was continued
on his MDI while in the hospital with stable respiratory
status.

4. Hypertension remained well controlled in the hospital with
maximal beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor, and Imdur therapy.

5. Groin A-V fistula:  Ultrasound on [**2136-2-1**] noted a left
common femoral artery and common femoral vein A-V fistula
with no pseudoaneurysm.  Vascular Surgery was consulted and
recommended no intervention and followup duplex ultrasound at
four weeks with followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of Vascular
Surgery after the duplex.

6. Hypercholesterolemia:  He was continued on a statin while
in the hospital.

7. Acute renal failure:  The patient had rise in creatinine
after dye loads for his cardiac catheterization, which peaked
at 2.4 and improved to his baseline of 1.2 upon discharge.
He was continued on ACE inhibitor.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged home with home
VNA.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient is ambulating, saturating
well on room air.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  The patient is to followup with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**]
in one week after discharge.  He is also to followup with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**2-9**] weeks.  He was to consider adding niacin or
Lopid for low HDL as an outpatient.  He is also to followup
at Device Clinic on [**2136-2-13**] at 2 p.m.  He is to followup for
his left groin ultrasound in four weeks and to followup with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of Vascular Surgery on [**2136-3-5**] at 10 a.m.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Sublingual nitroglycerin 0.3 mg tablet one sublingual q5
minutes as needed for chest pain, maximum of three
sublinguals.
2. Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Simvastatin 40 mg p.o. q.d.
5. Fluoxetine 20 mg p.o. q.d.
6. Fluticasone one inhalation b.i.d.
7. Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o. q.d.
8. Lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. q.d.
9. Metoprolol succinate 200 mg p.o. q.d.
10. Isosorbide mononitrate 60 mg p.o. q.d.
