Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
56 year old woman with a history of coronary artery disease s/p
drug-eluting stent to the LAD and history of cardiomyopathy
thought secondary to radiation therapy for Hodgkin's Disease.
She has had a day of worsening shortness of breath. She reports
no change in her diet or medication regimen. She denies any
chest pain or fevers.
.
She presented to her PCP's office today and appeared to be in
respiratory distress. She was given 60 mg of IV furosemide, one
sublingual nitroglycerin, and placed on a non-rebreather.
Reportedly room air sats were 74%. On arrival to the ED, she was
tachypneic and appeared uncomfortable. Her vital signs were HR
105 RR 26 100% cpap. She could only speak in one syllable words.
She was placed on Bipap and a nitro gtt. Her chest xray was
consistent with pulmonary edema. The nitro was weaned out of
concern for BP's in the 100's. She was placed on 15 L. She
appeared to become more uncomfortable (after 30-60 minutes), so
Bipap was placed back on per patient request. She was also given
inhalers which did not change her symptoms. She got an
additional 80 mg IV furosemide. She had put out approximately
600 cc of urine in the ED. However, this was partially estimated
due to incontinence. Vital signs on transfer were 78 23 97/59.

[**4-19**] CARDIAC CATH1. Selective coronary angiography of this
co-dominant system
demonstrated non-obstructive coronary artery disease.  The LMCA
had a
proximal 20% lesion.  The LAD had minimal luminal
irregularities.  The
stent in the mid-LAD was noted to be widely patent.  The LCx and
RCA
were noted to be free of any angiographically-apparent coronary
artery
disease.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right- and left-sided
filling
pressures, with a RVEDP 11 mmHg and LVEDP 10 mmHg.  There was
mild
pulmonary arterial hypertension with pulmonary pressures of
40/20, mean
31 mmHg.  The systemic arterial pressures were normal with a
central
aortic pressure of 128/69, mean 93 mmHg. The PCWP was elevated
to 20
mmHg.  There was mitral stenosis with a mean transvalvular
gradient of
10.75 mmHg with a calculated mitral valve area of 1.5 cm2.
3. Selective renal angiography of the left and right renal
arteries
demonstrated no angiograhically-apparent stenoses or lesions.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Mild non-obstructive coronary artery disease.
2. Normal right- and left-sided filling pressures.
3. Mild pulmonary arterial hypertension.
4. Systemic arterial normotension.
5. Moderate mitral valve stenosis.
6. Normal left and right renal arteries.

[**4-18**] ECHO
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with distal and apical LV
hypokinesis (LAD territory). The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 40%). Right ventricular chamber size is normal.
with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
There is moderate functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 13
mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification. There is no
pericardial effusion. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Post-radiation valvular disease with mild mitral
stenosis and mild aortic stenosis. Mild regional biventricular
systolic dysfunction, most c/w CAD, although post-radiation
changes cannot be excluded.

Brief Hospital Course:
56 year old woman with a history of cardiomyopathy thought
secondary to radiation therapy. She presents with a CHF
exacerbation.
.
# Acute on chronic diastolic and systolic CHF:
Her most recent echo showed a normal EF with diastolic
dysfunction. A repeat echo on this admission showed a depressed
LVEF of 40%. Her symptoms were most consistent with a CHF
exacerbation. She was initially started on a lasix drip and this
was transitioned to boluses of IV lasix as her dyspnea and
hypoxia improved. Her antihypertensives were held in the setting
of hypotension. When improved, she was discharged home on 20mg
of PO torsemide.
.
# CAD:
She has a history of CAD with a known stent in the LAD. Her echo
indicated reduced systolic function concerning for recent
ischemic disease. She was brought to cardiac catheterization
where she was found to have non occlusive coronary disease. Her
home regimen of aspirin, plavix and lipitor were all continued.
Lisinopril and metoprolol were held due to hypertension but
restarted on discharge.

# HTN
As above, imdur, metoprolol and lisinopril were h
