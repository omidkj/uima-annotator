History of Present Illness:
This is a 44 year old man who reports one week of headache,
nausea, emesis. He checked himself into a detox program and they
noted that he was hypertensive. The exact [**Location (un) 1131**] is unknown but
he claims that his diastolic BP was >100. they gave him
clonidine
and he felt better. He went home and after one week, the
symptoms
returned. He was seen at an OSH and Decadron and clonidine were
given with good effect. CT head showed hydrocephalus and he was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further treatment. He denies blurred
vision, reports ataxia.

Pertinent Results:
CT from OSH with hydrocephalus, tonsilar herniation and possible
mass.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2117-8-5**] 8:58 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Cerebellar edema with effacement of the fourth ventricle due
to a
cerebellar mass, better evaluated on subsequent MRI Head, likely
a metastasis given the lung mass on concurrent CT torso.
2.  Hydrocephalus is unchanged.

CT chest ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST Study Date of [**2117-8-5**] 8:59
PM
IMPRESSION:
1.  7.6 x 7.3 x 6 cm soft tissue mass in the right lower lobe of
the lung
concerning for lung cancer
2.  7 mm right lower lobe nodule and a 6.5 mm right middle lobe
nodule are
indeterminate, but may represent metastases
3.  Small loculated right pleural effusion adjacent to the large
mass.
4.  Severe emphysematous changes with bullous formation in the
lungs
bilaterally. 5.  5 mm lytic foci in the left ilium which, raise
the possibility of metastatic disease and could be further
evaluated with a bone scan.
6.  Wedge deformity of T12 vertebra of indeterminate age;
however,
degenerative changes in that area indicate that this is likely
chronic due to prior trauma.

MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2117-8-5**] 9:38 PM
IMPRESSION:  Isolated posterior fossa mass with significant
surrounding edema consistent with a metastatic lesion.  Mass
causes compression upon the fourth ventricle and subsequent
acute hydrocephalus of the third and lateral ventricles.

[**8-7**] wound cx: WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2117-8-10**]):
      This culture contains mixed bacterial types (>=3)
clindamycin sensitive

[**8-9**] NCHCT: IMPRESSION:
1.  Status post suboccipital craniectomy and tumor resection
with expected
post operative change.
2.  Continued cerebellar swelling with posterior fossa mass
effect, but
substantially reduced in severity since [**2117-8-5**].
3.  The third and lateral ventricles are now of normal caliber.

[**8-10**] MRI Brain:
1.  Post-surgical findings as above, with small foci of
enhancement along the resection margin that are likely vascular
in etiology
2.  Fluid in the resection cavity, extending into the
suprajacent posterior soft tissues, inseparable from the
posterior fossa and extra-axial CSF spaces; communication cannot
be excluded by imaging.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to neurosurgery ICU on [**2117-8-5**] for further
management.  Brain MRI with and without contrast which was
consistent with Isolated posterior fossa mass with significant
surrounding edema consistent with a metastatic lesion.  Mass
causes compression upon the fourth ventricle and subsequent
acute hydrocephalus of the third and lateral ventricles per the
radiology final impression. A CT of the torso was performed
which was consistent with the following per the radiology final
impression: 1.  7.6 x 7.3 x 6 cm soft tissue mass in the right
lower lobe of the lung concerning for lung cancer2.  7 mm right
lower lobe nodule and a 6.5 mm right middle lobe nodule are
indeterminate, but may represent metastases 3.  Small loculated
right pleural effusion adjacent to the large mass. 4.  Severe
emphysematous changes with bullous formation in the lungs
bilaterally. 5.  5 mm lytic foci in the left ilium which, raise
the possibility of metastatic disease and could be further
evaluated with a bone scan. 6.  Wedge deformity of T12 vertebra
of indeterminate age; however, degenerative changes in that area
indicate that this is likely chronic due to prior trauma.

On [**8-6**], On exam the patient was alert and oriented to person ,
place, and time without focal deficits. The patient continued on
Decadron 6 mg every 6 hours.  The Oncology service was consulted
regarding the patient's lung mass. They recommded LFTs and HIV
testing. This was discussed with the patient on [**8-7**] and he gave
verbal consent. He reported a negative test done last year. An
arm abcess was noted on the right arm. The patient reports a
history of various abcesses developing at site where he inject
heroin improperly. The SICU performed and I/D and he was started
on clindamycin. He was transfered to the floor. His MRSA screen
was positive and he was put on precautions.
On [**8-8**] he remained neurologically stable. He was prepped for
surgery for [**8-9**] and he signed consent. His HIV test resulted as
negative and LFT's were WNL. All cx's remained NGTD.
On [**8-9**] he went to the OR and underwent a sub-occipital
craniotomy and resection of tumor. Surgery was without
complication. He was extubated and transferred to the ICU. Post
op head CT revealed surgical post op changes. He remained stable
overnight. On [**8-10**] he was cleared for transfer to the floor. His
PCA was discontinued and he was started on PO pain meds. He was
encouraged to advance his activity. The wound culture from his
right elbow grew mixed bacteria, but was sensitive to
clindamycin so he was continued on that.
On [**8-11**] he was still complaining of discomfort in his head and
neck. His pain medications were adjusted accordingly. SQH was
restarted. On [**8-12**], patient was stable on examination. His IV
dilaudid was discontinued and patient was able to tolerate
changes in medication. He was ambulating independently and
incision was c/d/i with sutures. He was discharged home in
stable condition.
