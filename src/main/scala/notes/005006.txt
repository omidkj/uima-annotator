Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4111**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal & back pain, nausea and vomiting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
73 year-old female with 1 month h/o RUQ pain presented to
[**Hospital3 24768**] on [**2113-9-21**] with increased RUQ pain, nausea,
vomiting, back pain, and temperature of 101.0 degrees F. She was
being evaluated for ascending cholangitis, when she had an
episode of desaturation to 80s on room air, with observed
circum-oral cyanosis, yet immediate return to the 90s when
placed
on oxygen, 2L via nasal cannula. A D-dimer was sent and returned
high (>1000) and she was empirically placed on heparin gtt for
presumed pulmonary embolus. She was given gentamicin 80mg,
levaquin 500mg and flagyl 500mg x 2. A CT scan abdomen / pelvis
without contrast revealed abnormal hypodensity in right lobe of
liver (2.5cm in diameter), colonic diverticulosis, and mild
thinning of wall of colon in LLQ. No intrahepatic or
extrahepatic
biliary ductal dilatation. Labs were as follows: WBC 21.7,
D-dimer 1050, T.bili 1.6, D.bili 0.8, AP 164, AST 52, ALT 44,
Alb
2.2, Trop I 0.11, BUN 34, Cr 1.8. At this point, a decision was
made to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation. She was
enroute
to [**Hospital1 18**] in the evening on [**2113-9-22**] when she  became hypotensive
(SBP 70s) and reported pleuritic chest pain. She was
subsequently
diverted to [**Hospital **] Hospital. In [**Location (un) 75093**] emergency department,
she was resuscitated with fluid and given demerol with
improvement in blood pressure and pain. Once stabilized, she was
transported to [**Hospital1 18**] and admitted to the SICU for further
evaluation and management.

Radiology Studies
-----------------
[**2113-9-23**] 12:03 AM ~ CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
Reason: eval for acute cardiopulmonary process
IMPRESSION: Chest clear.
.
[**2113-9-23**] 1:04 AM ~ LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGL
Reason: assess CBD
INDICATION: 73-year-old woman with right upper quadrant pain,
hypertension, prior cholecystectomy. Assess CBD.
IMPRESSION:
1. No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
2. 4.5 cm heterogeneous liver lesion with internal flow. This is
concerning for malignancy, further evaluation with CT or MR is
recommended.
.
[**2113-9-23**] 2:43 PM ~CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-; CT ABDOMEN
W/CONTRAST
INDICATION: Possible cholangitis, query liver abscess. History
of respiratory distress and desaturation with elevated D-dimer.
Evaluate for pulmonary embolism.
IMPRESSION:
1. No CT evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Heterogeneous hypodense lesion in segment VIII of the liver
associated with a dilated bile duct proximally, and surrounding
hyperemia. Findings may represent a hepatic abscess with
associated cholangitis; however, the lesion has not been
completely characterized with a multiphasic study. Other
considerations include a hepatic tumor although this is
considered less likely. Further characterization with MRI is
recommended.
3. Bibasilar atelectasis.
4. Sigmoid diverticulosis.
.
[**2113-9-28**] 3:30 PM ~BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS
Reason: right femoral DVT noted on CT scan from [**9-23**].
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
.
[**2113-9-28**] 8:00 AM ~LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGL
Reason: Interval change in abscess size
IMPRESSION: Again seen is a relatively well-defined rounded mass
in the right lobe of the liver which measures 5.1 x 4.7 x 4.8 cm
today. On the prior ultrasound the measurements were 4.4 x 4.5 x
4.5 cm, therefore this represents a minimal increase in size.
Minimally increased size of right lobe liver mass with interval
echogenicity changes that could be consistent with the natural
evolution/resolution of an abscess. However underlying mass
lesion cannot be excluded. Further followup is recommended to
confirm resolution of this lesion. MRI could be performed if
further characterization is clinically indicated.
.
[**2113-10-5**] 9:13 AM ~ LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGL
Reason: Evaluate hepatic abscess.
FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name 75094**] son[**Name (NI) 493**] images of the liver reveal
interval decrease in the size of the patient's known right
hepatic lobe abscess, which is hypoechoic, without demonstrable
internal blood flow. It currently measures 3.7 x 2.8 x 4.1 cm,
compared to 5.1 x 4.7 x 4.8 cm. No additional focal hepatic
abnormalities are identified. There is no evidence of
intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The common duct is
normal at 2.9 mm and the main portal vein is patent, with
hepatopetal flow. The patient is status post cholecystectomy.
IMPRESSION: 1. Interval decrease in the size of a known hepatic
abscess.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the SICU under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**]
for possible cholangitis, pulmonary embolism and liver abscess.
During that time she was alert and oriented person, place and
time,, afebrile with stable vital signs HR 80's, SBP 130-150. A
heparin drip was started upon admission due to elevated D-dimer,
complaints of shortness of breath, a CT Scan evaluated no
pulmonary embolism. She had a white count of 27.9, blood
cultures and urine cultures were obtained, a dose of gentamicin
IV was given and WBC decreased to 20. Patient was transferred to
the floor <24 hours from the time of admission.

Abdominal Pain/Hepatic abscess: Right upper quadrant abdominal
pain was evaluated initially by CT scan of abdomen and pelvis,
patient received IV bicarb pre and post procedure due to
impaired renal function. This demonstrated abnormal hypodensity
in right lobe of liver 2.5 cm, 1.5 cm right adrenal adenoma,
thinning of left colon wall possibility mild diverticulitis. No
duct dilatation seen. A liver ultrasound and chest CTA were then
obtained to evaluate possible cholangitis and query liver
abscess. The liver ultrasound revealed 4.5 cm heterogeneous
liver lesion with internal flow, no biliary ductal dilatation.
The chest CTA revealed Segment VII lesion in liver (abscess
