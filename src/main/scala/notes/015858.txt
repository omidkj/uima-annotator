Echo [**2196-12-14**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is mildly/borderline
depressed. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right
ventricular systolic function appears depressed. There is
abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic root is
moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. A mitral valve
annuloplasty ring is present. Mild to moderate ([**12-20**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity
is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion. There
are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Echocardiographic
signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated
right sided pressures.

CXR [**2196-12-14**]: Patient is status post CABG and median sternotomy
wires are again seen. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
The patient has severe emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis, which
have been described. Accounting for differences in technique,
there is no change in the diffuse opacity which spares the left
upper lung zone most likely representing suerimposed congestive
heart failure. No pneumothorax is identified.

CT [**2196-12-14**]: 1. Acute asymmetric interstitial pneumonitis
superimposed upon a background of severe emphysema and pulmonary
fibrosis. In the setting of recent CABG and mitral valve repair,
diagnostic considerations include drug toxicity, asymmetric
pulmonary edema, unilateral lung injury, and less likely
infection. 2. Moderate pericardial effusion and small right
pleural effusion. 3. Likely reactive mediastinal lymph node
enlargement. 4. Low attenuation lesions within the liver that
are too small to characterize.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI patient was seen as an outpatient and
was a same day admit. He was brought directly to the operating
room where he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x 1 and
mitral valve repair. Please see op note for surgical details.
Patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the
CSRU in stable condition on Neo-Synephrine and Propofol. Later
on op day pt was weaned from mechanical ventilation and sedation
and was extubated. He was neurologically intact. On post op day
one, inotropes were weaned off and he was in stable condition
and was transferred to telemetry floor. Diuretics and b blockers
were started per protocol. Post op day two he had a low HCT
(24.6) and was transfused one unit of blood. Also received 1
unit on post op day seven. At time of discharge HCT was 30.3. On
post operative day three his chest tubes and epicardial pacing
wires were removed. Over the remaining hospital course patient
continued to make a slow recovery secondary to pulmonary issues
(prior lung dz/pulm. effusion). He continued to require oxygen
via nasal cannula and had repeated oxygen desaturation with
ambulation despite IS, Nebs, C&DB, and diuretics (discharge
weight was approxiamtely 3 kg over admit weight). Pulmonary team
was consulted. He also had transient episodes of Atrial
Fibrillation starting on post op day six which were intitally
converted with Lopressor. He was eventually started on Coumadin
with a goal INR 1.5-2. On post op day eight patient had an echo,
CXR, and CT. Please see pertinent results. Despite continued
efforts to improve pulmonary status, the patient's family
requested transfer to [**Hospital6 2752**] for ongoing care.
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5700**] has accepted him for ICU care at [**Hospital 2586**]. Ongoing issues were discussed with him by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 65172**] PA. Will need coumadin dosing today after transfer.
