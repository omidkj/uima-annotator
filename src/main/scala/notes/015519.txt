Brief Hospital Course:
pt admitted from er with labile BP

pre-hydrated for angio

angiogram  - underwent arteriography today for renovascular
hypertension.  A high-grade stenosis was seen at the origin of
the left renal artery.  The distal artery appeared normal.  This
was dilated with a 6-mm balloon expandable stent with a good
technical result.  She has less significant stenosis of the
right
renal artery.  Her celiac and SMA stents appeared to be patent.
