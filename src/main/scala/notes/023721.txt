Service:

The patient is an 83-year-old Russian speaking male.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease, status post
left anterior descending stent in [**2201-2-28**] and a recent
admission from [**2201-8-21**] to [**2201-8-27**] for chest pain and
pulmonary edema which required intubation and a cardiac
catheterization with a stent to the right coronary artery.
The patient's catheterization course at that time was
complicated by hypotension requiring brief Dopamine drip.
The patient was quickly weaned off and discharged on [**8-27**] to
[**Hospital **] Rehabilitation.

On the night prior to admission the patient developed
shortness of breath and chest pain.  He was then transferred
to [**Hospital3 **] where he was treated with intravenous
Lasix and rule out for myocardial infarction was begun.  Of
note, the patient had not received any Lasix after discharge
from [**Hospital1 69**] on [**8-27**] and had a 7
pound weight increase at the time.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure with ischemic
cardiomyopathy, moderate left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, apex akinetic, septum hypokinetic.  Coronary
artery disease, status post left anterior descending stent in
[**2201-2-28**] and status post an right coronary artery stent in
[**2201-8-27**].  Status post a DDD- pacer for bradycardia, increased
cholesterol, hypertension and chronic renal insufficiency,
diastolic dysfunction for vascular disease, status post an
aortobifemoral bypass, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
back pain, history of sundowning, glaucoma, gout, prostate
carcinoma.

daughters, occasional alcohol use.

membranes, jugular venous distention with increase to the
ear, Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular:  Distant heart sounds.  Regular rate and
rhythm with a 2/6 systolic murmur in the left upper sternal
border without radiation.  Abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  Liver is palpable 2 to
3 cm below the costal margin.  Extremities showed 2+ edema
bilaterally.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg once a day.
2.  Lopressor 25 mg twice a day.
3.  Amiodarone 200 mg q day.
4.  Protonix 40 mg once a day.
5.  Lipitor 40 mg once a day.
6.  Captopril 25 mg three times a day.
7.  Plavix 75 mg once a day.
8.  Colace 100 mg twice a day.
10. Bisacodyl 10 mg once a day.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Congestive heart failure.  The patient was felt to be
fluid overload and congestive heart failure exacerbation.
Diuresed with Nitrocor and Lasix and Dopamine transiently.
On [**2201-9-6**] the patient developed hypotension with systolic
blood pressures down to the 40's and 50's and became hypoxic
requiring 100% non-rebreather.  The patient was subsequently
transferred to the CCU for further care.  While in the CCU
the patient's blood pressure was maintained with Dopamine and
Neo-Synephrine initially and then changed to Dobutamine and
Nitroprusside.  A Swann Ganz catheter was placed for
hemodynamic tailored therapy.  The patient initially showed
values of a cardiac output of 2.6 and an index of 1.6.  His
wedge was 10. The patient was felt therefore to be
over-diuresed and intravenous fluids were started with a goal
of 12 to 13, 5 liters of fluids were given.  The patient
subsequently improved while on Dobutamine and Nitroprusside.
Nitroprusside was weaned off secondary to the duration of
treatment.  The Nesiritide was restarted.  On [**2201-9-11**] the
Dopamine was weaned off and the patient was restarted on ACE
inhibitor which was titrated upward to Captopril 75 mg three
times a day.  The patient was then diuresed gently.  On [**9-13**]
the Swann Ganz catheter was discontinued and the patient was
weaned of the Nesiritide.  His final Swann numbers showed a
cardiac output of 2.4 with an index of 1.5.

Following the hypotensive episodes requiring his transfer to
the CCU the patient developed heme positive stools with an
increase lactate and increased amylase and complaints of
abdominal pain.  CT scan done showed thickening of the
ascending colon.  Surgery was consulted regarding possible
ischemic colitis.  They felt that there was no need for
surgery at this time especially based on patient's cardiac
status.  Treatment was bowel rest, TPN nutrition and serial
exams.  The patient was treated with Zosyn and Flagyl.  At
the time the patient was transferred to the floor he was off
antibiotics.  However, abdominal exam still showed distension
with hypoactive bowel sounds.

On transfer to the floor the patient appeared fluid
overloaded once again, the patient was therefore restarted on
Astreotide and Lasix and Captopril was reduced in order to
keep the patient's systolic blood pressure greater than 90
while on Nitrocor therapy.  The patient subsequently had an
episode of pulselessness and possibly hypotension.  It was
felt at this time that treatment was most likely futile.  A
family meeting was called for discussion of code status.

2.  Code Status.  Family meeting was held and the goals of
therapy were discussed.  The patient was unable to contribute
to the discussion of future care secondary to delirium.  The
patient's daughter and son were present at this meeting.
Initially a decision to make the patient DNR/DNI was reached,
subsequent Comfort Care was decided.

3.  Delirium.  From day one of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay
the patient suffered from a delirious state.  He had a
history of sundowning however his delirium seemed to be
constant, it was thought secondary to his medical problems
most likely to his congestive heart failure and very low
cardiac output.  Initially treated with Zyprexa at bedtime
with Haldol p.r.n. however, there is little improvement post
CCU stay and hypotension.  The patient's mental status was
depressed and he remained somnolent for many days prior.
Following a decision of DNR/DNI comfort care only when care
was withdrawn the patient seemed to wake up however, remained
quite delirious.

4.  Gastrointestinal.  Ischemic colitis.  The patient was
treated conservatively with bowel rest, TPN.  Decision was
made to allow food to be given to the patient after he was
Comfort Care Only if he so desired.

Palliative care consult was called to help with management of
end-of-life issues.

The remainder of this hospital course will be dictated in a
subsequent addendum.
