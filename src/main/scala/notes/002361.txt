Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
ventricular tachycardia status-post ablation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2156-12-14**] - Ablation of ventricular tachycardia

History of Present Illness:
86 year-old male with CAD who is s/p CABG x 5 in [**2156**]. He is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7047**] and
underwent a nuclear stress test in [**2155-7-20**]. This revealed a
severe fixed perfusion defect involving the inferior wall with a
mild degree of peri infarction ischemia. There was also a fixed
apical defect consistent with an old apical MI. There was
akinesis of the inferior wall and apex with severe hypokinesis
of the mid to distal anterior wall apex which is consistent with
multi-segmental CAD. The ejection fraction was 27%. He underwent
BiV ICD placement on [**2155-9-9**] for primary prevention of sudden
cardiac death.  His course was complicated by a moderate
pneumothorax, he was asymptomatic, and an x-ray the following
day showed improvement of the pneumothorax and he was
discharged.
.
3-4 months ago he was pulling on a garden hose and he became
dizzy and saw "lights". He leaned against a wall and received a
shock from his ICD. He felt fine within a minute. He went to
[**Hospital3 417**] where he stayed there 3 days. He denies any
further testing or medication changes.
.
Two months ago he was driving and felt poorly and noted his
heart was "fluttering" he was able to drive home but had a near
syncopal episode and he felt his ICD fire. EMS was summoned and
he was found to be in VT at a rate of 140 bpm his ICD did not
fire as it was set for 170 bpm. Patient states he knows his ICD
fired prior getting to the hospital. He was externally
cardioverted. His amiodarone was increased to 400mg daily.
.
He denies any further fluttering or ICD shocks. When he is
resting he feels that he can feel his heart beating but denies
any palpitations. He does report his heart rate has been fast
and he has brief intermittent dizziness. His Amiodarone was
discontinued last week ([**2156-12-1**]) by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 17918**] as it was
thought to be ineffective.
.
He denies chest pain, and reports some dyspnea with exertion
along with mild dizziness if he gets up too quickly. He loses
his balance frequently from his neuropathy. He has not been able
to drive since his last ICD shock. He was referred for VT
ablation today.
.
During VT ablation, EP was able to induced 6 different VT in
lab, ablate along the scar in the inferior septum at the base on
LV. At the end of study, no longer able to induce any VT.
Bedrest for 6 hrs, continue carvedilol no antiarrythmic.  In
procedure, he was 2L positive and got lasix 40 IV.
.
On arrival to CCU, he appears to be comfortable.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

standard position within the right Preliminary Reportatrium,
right ventricle and through the coronary sinus. There is no
pleural Preliminary Reporteffusion or pneumothorax. Bilateral
lungs are expanded and clear. Ill-defined
Preliminary Reportopacity with lucency in the right lower
paracardiac region is likely a Preliminary Reportherniated bowel
loop. Mildly enlarged heart size, mediastinal and hilar

IMPRESSION
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal or intra-abdominal bleed.
2. Heterogeneous high-density material within the bladder which
is
nondependent and appears adherent to the bladder wall. Recommend
further
evaluation with contrast-enhanced CT/MRI or ultrasound.
3. Benign-appearing bony lesion in the right ilium is most
consistent with a bone island. Given no history of prostate
cancer, attention on followup
studies is indicated.
4. Large midline abdominal wall herni
