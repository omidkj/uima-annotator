CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath and mental status

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 59-year-old
male with a history of congestive obstructive pulmonary
disease requiring home O2, schizo-affective disorder and
assaultive behavior.  Is sent from the [**Hospital3 **] Home
after the patient became combative, refuses alcohol, and was
noted to be hypoxic.  On presentation to the Emergency
Department, the patient was somnolent and intermittently
arousable, thus unable to provide a significant history or
review of systems, but reports that the patient was noted to
be slightly "off" cognitively on [**2-18**].  On [**2-19**],
he had increasing congestion and was started on levofloxacin.

On [**2-20**] and [**2-21**], he became increasingly
combative with decreased O2 saturations 67-70% with O2
noncompliance.  Also he is found to be bleeding from his nose
and mouth, although there was no known trauma.  There is a
history of physical assault from his roommate.  With
worsening sats, he is transferred to the [**Hospital1 346**] Emergency Department for further
evaluation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit where he received intravenous Solu-Medrol

levofloxacin for suspected pneumonia in the lower lobes.  He
quickly improved, so that he was able to be transferred out
of the MICU to the [**Company 191**] Medicine service after about six
hours.

On the Medicine service, he was transferred to oral steroids,
and continued on his nebulizers and antibiotics.  He
continued to improve, so that he is now back to his baseline
oxygen saturation on his 4 liters of home oxygen and his
mental status has now returned back to baseline.  He is no
longer combative, and agrees to wear his home oxygen as he
understands that he needs it.
