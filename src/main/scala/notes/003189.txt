Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4232**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
55 yo female with history of HIV (last CD4
>1000 with VL undetectable), HCV, HBV, former IVDU, CHF,
recurrent UTI with VRE/ESBL, and recurrent DVT on warfarin who
presented with fever and low back pain. The patient was recently
hospitalized from [**Date range (1) 23527**], again for fever and lower back
pain. During this previous hospitalization, she was found to
have an elevated INR to 13 of unknown etiology, and her INR
decreased without intervention. She was treated for HCAP with a
7-day course of linezolid and cefepime given her history of VRE
and diuresed for pulmonary edema given dCHF. She was continued
on her home dose of methadone, dilaudid and gabapentin for her
chronic pain disorder (including back, leg, neck, head). After
discharge she says she was feeling okay at home but two days ago
developed fevers, dysuria, increased urinary frequency, and
nausea/vomiting with blood in her emesis. She denied any new
weakness, no numbness or tingling, no radiation to legs or
urinary retention. She stated that her back pain was of the same
quality as usual but more intense.
On arrival to the ED, VS were 101.7, 112, 151/112, 100% on O2.
Labs were notable for UA with few bacteria/large leukocytes/51
WBCs, INR 11.1, normal WBC of 9.7 (80% PMNs). She was started on
empiric IV cefepime and linezolid for infection and given 5 mg
PO vitamin K for elevated INR. Blood cultures were sent. She was
also given sumatriptan for headache and zofran for nausea. CXR
showed mild pulmonary vascular congestion (unchanged from prior
CXR) and bibasilar airspace opacities. She was noted to be
guaiac positive. Several hours after arrival to the ED, the
patient became more lethargic and was started on IVF. CT head
was obtained given elevated INR and headache but did not reveal
acute process. She received 2L of IV normal saline because
pressures dropped to 83/40 and improved to 90s/50s with fluid.
She was also was noted to have a cellulitic looking patch of
skin on her RLE. Her tox screen is positive for methadone. She
was transferred to the MICU for further management of her
hypotension, where she did not require pressors and was
continued on her home medications and started on meropenem. The
patient covertly took some of her home methadone in the ICU, but
she remained afebrile and stable for several hours and was
transferred to medicine for further care.
Her vital signs on transfer were T99 BP 140/83 HR 83 RR 13 94%
4L.
