Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5790**]
Chief Complaint:
Left upper lobe lung cancer.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2109-11-13**] Left intrapericardial pneumonectomy and
intercostal muscle flap buttress to the pneumonectomy [**Last Name (LF) **],
[**First Name3 (LF) **] lymphadenectomy, bronchoscopy with aspiration.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 62-year-old gentleman with a biopsy-proven left
upper lobe lung cancer. His mediastinoscopy and mediastinal
lymph node staging by VATS AP window dissection was negative for
nodal spread.

The patient had marginal pulmonary function tests and we did try
to clarify this further with both VQ testing which revealed
passable reserves following a left upper lobectomy with an
expected predicted postoperative FEV1 of 48% and DLCO of 41%. He
had a predicted postoperative FEV1 of closer to 39% and 34%
following pneumonectomy. He was admitted for resection with
possible pneumonectomy.

Past Medical History:
Prostate cancer, status post radical prostatectomy and XRT
Status post appendectomy
Status post cholecystectomy
Skin cancer

CXR:
[**2109-11-19**]: There is no change in the appearance of the chest,
compared to the prior study, including status post left
pneumonectomy with surgical clips at the left hilus, near
opacification of the left hemithorax, with small amount of air
remaining in the pneumonectomy cavity and elevation of the left
hemidiaphragm. Mild rightward mediastinal shift has stabilized.
The right lung remains relatively clear. Thoracotomy changes are
seen on the left.  Left chest wall emphysema has decreased.
[**2109-11-18**]: A small amount of air is still present in the left
hemithorax. The left post- pneumonectomy cavity is mainly
occupied by fluid. There is stable shifting of the
cardiomediastinal silhouette towards the right. The right lung
is grossly clear. Left subcutaneous emphysema has minimally
decreased.
[**2109-11-17**]: interval increased opacification of the left
hemithorax. Right
lung is relatively clear. There is subcutaneous emphysema in the
left chest wall extending into the neck. Small foci of air
remain in the left upper thorax. Surgical clips are present at
the left hilum.
[**2109-11-15**]: Post-surgical changes including resolution of the left
pleural air cavity and increasing fluid. Persistent subcutaneous
air as described.
[**2109-11-13**]:  Status post pneumonectomy with two round areas of
opacity in the left hemithorax, which may represent loculated
fluid collections and/or postoperative hematoma.




PICC: [**2109-11-18**] Right PICC tip is in the lower SVC.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**2109-11-13**] and had successful left
pneumonectomy.  He was extubated in the operating room,
transferred to the TSICU for further management.

Respiratory: He required aggressive pulmonary toilet, nebs and
chest PT to Right lung to maintain oxygen saturations in the
high 90's.  He eventually weaned off oxygen with saturations 97%
on Room air.

Chest-tube was removed on POD 1.  Serial chest films showed
opacification of the left hemithorax, right clear lung.

Cardiac: He required a small amount of pressures for
hypotension.  On POD4 he had an episode or rapid afibrillation
and hypotension after lopressor & diltiazem IV.  He was
transferred back to the TSICU converted to sinus rhythm with
amiodarone and beta-blocker.  Electrolytes were repleted as
needed. Cardiac enzymes were negative x 3. He remained in sinus
rhythm with heart rate in the 50-60's.  His amiodarone was
titrated to maintance dose and beta-blocker changed to toprol
daily.

GI: PPI's were given for prophylaxis.  Normal bowel funtion
returned.

Renal: Immediately postoperative the Creatinine level peaked to
2.2 with low urine output.  His potassium level was also
elevated to 6.6 and was normalized with insulin, and Kayexalate.
With gental hydration his creatinine level improved to his base
of 1.0 and good urine output.  The foley was removed

Incision: Left thoracotomy site clean

Pain: Epidural managed by the acute pain service.  On POD1 the
epidural was replaced. The epidural was removed on POD5.  He
converted to PO Dilaudid and tylenol with good pain control.

IV access: [**2109-11-18**] A right PICC line was placed in the Right
Basilic vein and terminated in the distal SVC.

Neuro: non-focal
