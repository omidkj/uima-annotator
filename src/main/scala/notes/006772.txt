Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 21991**] is a 77 year old male with past medical history of
COPD on 3L nasal cannula at home, OSA, thyroid cancer, chronic
renal insufficiency, and large-cell lung cancer who presents
with an episode of shortness of breath overnight. He reported to
his PCP and sleep physicians that he awoke in the middle of the
night "gasping" for air. He feels he nearly died. The dyspnea
lasted about 3 minutes in total. He did not have any other
asssociated symptoms such as chest pain, fevers, chills, or
productive cough. No wheezing. Given the complexity of his
medical problems, he was referred in for further evaluation.

.

In the ED, his initial vital signs were:  99.1 73 143/81 22 97%
3L

He was given 325 mg of aspirin. A chest x-ray was completed and
unchanged from prior. An EKG was also unchanged atrial paced
rhythm. from prior. His initial cardiac enzymes revealed an
elevated troponin of 0.02, with a CK of 59. He is being admitted
for further evaluation and to complete a rule out for myocardial
ischemia.  He is being admitted to ICU for new dx of OSA and
initiation of Bipap.  Sleep sent him in. Looked well. No SOB
here felt fine. Satting 97% on 3L. Asymmetric swelling in left
left, negative LENI. 97.5 71 165/77 18 93%L upon departure from
ED.

.

On the floor, patient endorsed cough productive of sputum that
usually happens at night but has never woken him up from sleep.
For the past 2 months he has had increased shortness of breath
with exertion, unable to ambulate >10-15ft without shortness of
breath and a cough productive of clear mucous.  He denies fever,
chills, dysuria, chest pain, palpatitions or shortness of breath
at rest. Also reports orthopnea and sleeps sitting propped up on
wedge pillow. Denies recent sick contacts. In past notes, med
compliance has been questioned but patient endorses that his
wife has been giving him recent nebs.

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU Course:  The patient was admitted to the medical intensive
care unit for initiation and titration of BIPAP support. In
parallel, he was treated for a COPD exacerbation with oral
steroids and azithromycin, and continued on spiriva. He did not
tolerate the BIPAP through the evening, and the plan was to
discontinue this (notably, he did not tolerate bipap in sleep
lab either). Further workup of his pulmonary status was pursued
with CT scanning of neck and chest to look for progressive local
invasion of medullary thyroid CA. Plan was also put in place for
ENT evaluation of his vocal cords to look for vocal cord
dysfunction potentially related to tumor involvement.  There was
no further apneic events in the MICU and the patient continued
to do well on room air and was transferred to the floor for
further management.

On the floor, Mr [**Known lastname 21991**] was managed for the following issues:

# SOB: Patient has history of COPD with FEV1 68% on 3L at
baseline.  Was not hypoxic on the floor but was continued on a 3
day steroid course for possibility of COPD exacerbation as well
as azithromycin for five days.  Given the possibility of spread
of his cancer, a CT scan was obtained which did show a new
nodule.  He was also treated with his home nebulizers and
guiafensin to mobilize sputum.  On ambulation, he was stable on
his home O2 requirement.  He was set up for pulmonary follow-up
for his new lung nodule.

2. Leukocytosis: Patient was afebrile. Has history of aspiration
pneumonia and vocal cord paralysis. CXR clear but increased
sputum production. No other localizing signs of infection.
Leukocytosis was thought to be secondary to prednisone course
and the PCP was notified to follow up on his WBC count post
discharge.

3.  Dysphagia - The patient did complain of difficulty
swallowing foods, not liquids.  Complained of sensation of "food
getting stuck" and pointed to proximal throat. CT scan revealed
impingement of the esophagus at the level of the thyroid, likely
secondary to thyroid enlargement from hx of thyroid malignancy.
Speech and swallow was consulted; they recommended a soft solids
diet.  His oncologists were contact[**Name (NI) **] who felt that he could
benefit from a radiation therapy consult as an outpatient; he
was set up with a radiation oncology appointment for this.
.
# HTN: The patient was hypertensive on admission; on home
regimen he stabilized but pressures were still mildly elevated
likely secondary to his prednisone course.
.
#CRI: Cr at 1.9 was at his baseline.  Medications were renally
dosed.  Ct was done without contrast.

# BPH: Cont home meds.

# FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet
