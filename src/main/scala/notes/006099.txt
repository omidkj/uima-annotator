[**2171-10-17**] CT abdomen/pelvis from outside hospital showed:
Free intra-abdominal air in upper abdomen.  Sigmoid
diverticulitis.

[**2171-10-18**] TTE : Mildly dilated right ventricle with normal global
and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral
regurgitation

[**2171-10-23**] CT Abd/pelvis : 1. Bibasilar consolidation containing
air bronchograms concerning for infection.
2. Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Esophageal distention and gastric distention likely due to
positioning of the tip of the NG tube within the jejunal limb of
the gastrojejunostomy. NG tube could be withdrawn by
approximately 6 cm to achieve gastric positioning.
4. Status post sigmoidectomy with left end colostomy and
Hartmann's pouch.  Free fluid within the peritoneal cavity, but
no fluid collections or findings concerning for abscess.

[**2171-10-26**] CT Chest/abd/pelvis : 1. Possible partial or complete
obstruction of the gastrojejunostomy with oral contrast within
the stomach and going up to the thoracic inlet within the
esophagus. Suctioning of the NG tube is recommended to prevent
aspiration of the oral contrast.
2. Bilateral ground-glass opacities likely represent sequelae of
aspiration, although pneumonia cannot be excluded.
3. Air within the bladder is likely secondary to Foley catheter.


[**2171-11-5**] UGI : Free passage of contrast from the distal esophagus
into the
proximal small bowel. No stenosis, obstruction or leak.

[**2171-1-8**] KUB : Normal bowel gas pattern. No contrast in stomach.
Contrast seen in ascending colon.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2171-10-17**], the patient was started on
piperacillin-tazobactam and metronidazole and transferred
emergently to the operating theatre for perforated viscus, given
peritoneal signs and significant free intra-abdominal air.
Intra-operatively, the patient sustained two brief episodes of
asystole so the stomach and colon were left in discontinuity and
the abdomen remained open for a staged operation.
Post-operatively, he was admitted to the SICU on acute care
surgery and resuscitated.  Cardiology was consulted, and his
episodes of asystole were assessed as severe bradycardia
secondary to vagal stimulation during manipulation of the
viscera.  Troponins were normal, showing no signs of myocardial
ischemia.  ECG showed sinus bradycardia without acute changes.
On [**2171-10-20**], the patient remained stable and returned to the
operating theatre for completion antrectomy, gastrojejunostomy,
end colostomy, and abdominal closure, thus restoring alimentary
tract continuity.  He was extubated, and on [**2171-10-21**], he was
started on tube feeds through an NGT placed distal to the
gastrojejunal anastomosis.  He remained stable in the SICU so on
[**2171-10-22**] he was transferred to the floor.

Unfortunately he went back to the ICU on [**2171-10-26**] as he had a
series of problems which culminated with rigors and a
temperature of 101.1, desaturation to 77% on 5LNC and a chest CT
consistent with aspiration.  Issues leading up to it were rapid
afib, a distended abdomen, intolerant of tube feedings and some
brief Vtach. He recovered nicely and the only positive culture
was a urine culture with enterococcus.  His atrial fibrillation
was short lived and he then continued on Lopressor.

Following transfer to the Surgical floor he continued to make
slow, steady progress. From a cardiovascular standpoint he had
no other problems during his recovery. His betablocker was
resumed initially IV then orally and his blood pressure was in
the 100-125/70 range with a heart rate in the 60's.

His bowel function was very slow to return presumed secondary to
edema around the anastomosis.  In the interim he received both
enteral feedings and eventually hyperalimentation when his post
pyloric feeding tube came out. Bowel rest continued for about 2
weeks. His surgical woun
