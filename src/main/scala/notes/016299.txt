Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5552**]
Chief Complaint:
Cough, respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with ultrasound
Gastrostomy tube placement


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 66F with complicated oncologic history, [**Last Name (un) 35473**]
lymphoma s/p mantle radiation, breast ca s/p L mastectomy and
recent diagnosis of squamous cell esophageal cancer.  She was
admitted [**Date range (1) 35474**] to the OMED service with worsening dysphagia,
she was temporarily admitted to the MICU for elective intubation
for endoscopy with subsequent food bolus removal with
improvement in her symptoms.  She was discharged to follow up
with GI for repeat EUS/endoscopy and possible repeat esophageal
dilatation.  Other PMHx includes CAD s/p CABG and recent stent,
pericarditis on chronic steroids, and recurrent L pleural
effusion s/p  talc pleurodesis. She has been holding her
antiplatelet agents for several days prior to this procedure,
and has not taken any of her medications prior to her procedure
today.  Post-procedurally the ICU team was called to evaluate
the patient for hypotension and respiratory distress.  During
the procedure she received pressors transiently for SBP in 60s.
Post procedurally her BP had been 60-120s, mostly in 60-80s, pt
asymptomatic. She was also tachypneic to 30s and tachycardic to
low 100s.  She was mostly complaining of insessant cough with
secretions.  She otherwise was without complaint. No chest pain,
minimal dyspnea, no pain elsewhere.
.
In the PACU she was given 1 albuterol neb for her cough and
wheezes on exam and she improved markedly, her initial NC 02 was
able to be weaned to 1L from 6L, she was sating 97-100% on this,
desatting to 88% on RA.  She received 500cc NS in addition to
1000cc she received during the procedure, she was also given 1
albuterol neb with marked improvement in symptoms. She was
admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further monitoring of her hypotension.

.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient reported some improvement in her
symptoms, no further coughing or respiratory distress, no
dyspnea, now complaining of substernal pain/pressure, worse with
swallowing, "I feel like I need to belch." Just started
post-procedurally. Never happened before.  Also with some
anxiety, not knew.  Denies HA, vision change, sore throat,
nausea/vomiting, abd pain, diarrhea, constipation, melena or
hematochezia.  Has had b/l LE swelling since last
hospitalization.  At home was able to swallow soft solids, could
not tolerate pills or solids. Otherwise ROS negative.

Imaging:
TTE [**5-7**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is small.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve is bicuspid.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
mild aortic valve stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**1-9**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate
thickening of the mitral valve chordae, as well as extensive
fibrocalcific thickening of the mitral annulus and the
contiguous annular portion of the leaflets (however, no frank
mitral stenosis). Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting structures of the
tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. The main pulmonary artery is dilated. The
branch pulmonary arteries are dilated. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Compared with the findings
of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-4-3**], multiple
abnormalities as previously noted persist without major change.

CXR [**5-7**]:
1. Slight interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions.
2. Findings compatible with volume overload. Recommend repeat
radiograph
following diuresis.
3. Remainder of exam is otherwise unchanged.

EGD/EUS [**5-7**]:
Stricture of the upper third of the esophagus. Food in the upper
third of the esophagus (foreign body removal). EUS was performed
using a mini echoendoscope and therefore images were limited. T
stage: The lesion involved the mucosa, submucosa and the
muscularis. At one segment of the esophagus there was suspicion
of invasion beyond the muscularis layer. Based on these findings
this was staged as T2 / T 3 by EUS criteria. N stage: There were
no evidence of enlarged peri-esophageal lymph nodes. This was
staged N0.

LUE U/S [**5-9**]:
No deep venous thrombosis in the left upper extremity.

Hip/femur x-rays [**5-9**]:
No fracture.

CXR [**5-10**]:
Overall similar to [**2122-5-8**], but with relative increased opacity
in both right and left mid zones compared with [**2122-5-7**]. The
etiology is somewhat uncertain, bu
