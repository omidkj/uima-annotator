History of Present Illness:
This is a 57 year-old male with a history of metastatic
esophageal cancer who presents with anemia. He was recently
admitted [**2-22**] to [**2135-2-23**] after presenting with jaundice and
tbili of 31. He underwent ERCP with stent placement for a lower
CBD extrinsic compression with dilated upper CBD and
intrahepatic ducts. After the procedure he was briefly
hypotensive and was d/ced on Levo and flagyl for 8 days. He also
had a LUL cavitary lesion felt to be a necrotic met vs. abcess
for which the abx were also intended. He was seen by pallative
care last admission.
.
After discharge, his strength continued to worsen and he was
unable to stand intermittently. He also has fallen without a
head strike. He cut his elbow a few days ago and has also been
intermittently bleeding from the site large quantities. Last
evening he started to have "old blood" poor from his mouth. He
feels as it is coming from his stomach "at the site of the old
stent". he described the blood loss via mouth as 1 oz. He has
chronic abd discomfort which is not signficantly worse. He has
constipation but was incontinent of loose brown stool last
evening. Denies F/C/S, dizziness.
.
He presented to [**Hospital6 28728**] Center. There he was
hypotensive to 70s but not tachycardic. His HCT was 19.8 down
from 24.5 on discharge [**2135-2-23**]. WBC was 50. He was given 500 CC
IVF and protonix. 2 PIV were placed and he was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**].
.
In the ED,  inital VS 97.7, HR 75, BP 74/50, 26, 99% RA. He
remained with HR in the 70s, but BP droped to 61/38. HCT on
arrival was 14. He was given fluids, 1 unit RBC (2nd started on
the way up). He was given octreotide gtt, protonix gtt,
vancomycin and zosyn. He got 20mEQ in the ED and 10mEQ on route
from [**Hospital1 3597**]. VS prior to transfer 76/48, 74, 19, 100% 4L
.
On the floor, he is fatigued but without pain.
.
ROS: + LE edema. The patient denies any fevers, chills,
diarrhea,  chest pain, shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND,
cough, urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria, lightheadedness,
focal weakness, vision changes, headache, rash or skin changes.

IMAGING:
CT chest/abd/pelvis w/o contrast (wet read):
chest:
1. small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
right has
slightly increased in size since [**2135-2-23**].
2. again, multifocal consolidation and developing abscesses with
enlarging
left upper lobe pneumatocele. however, consolidations appear
slightly smaller in size than before. no new areas.
3. esophageal stent remains unchanged in position. significant
amount of
fluid/debris within stent; measures low density and unlikely
acute hemorrhage.
.
Abd/pelvis:
1. gastric stent has migrated even further distally and now
within body and antrum of stomach. punctate foci of high density
material at the GE junction and fundus of stomach are likely
broken off pieces of the stent stuck within the wall of the
stomach.
2. diffuse hepatic metastases appear to have worsened since the
recent chest CT.
3. metallic CBD stent appears unchanged in position and
appearance.
4. large amount of ascites measuring simple fluid density.
5. no evidence of hematoma or areas of high density fluid to
suggest bleeding on this noncontrast study.
6. high density material within the bowel could reflect acute
bleeding within the colon and distal small bowel. alternatively,
could reflect ingested material/medication. please correlate
clinically.
7. tiny nonobstructing right renal stones.
.
CXR:
IMPRESSION:
Interval decrease in size and extent of right middle and lower
lobe nodules, and decreased surrounding opacity about a left
upper lobe probable pneumatocele. Findings suggest improvement
of a multifocal infectious process.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 57 year-old male with a history of metastatic
esophogeal adenocarcinoma who presents with severe anemia, GI
bleed, and increased lethargy.
.
# Adenocarcinoma of esophagus with metastases of liver and lungs
with multi-organ failure:  While he was still pursing pallative
chemo with his oncologist at [**Hospital3 3765**], it became clear
during this hospitalization that he was too sick undergo any
further chemotherapy.  Due to his end-stage and deteriorating
condition, the family decided, in accordance with the patient
wishes, to withdraw all care (including antibiotics, blood
transfusion, and laboratory data/vital signs monitoring) and
transition him to CMO.  His pain was controlled with ativan,
fentanyl gtt, and a morphine gtt.  With his family by his side,
he became progressively bradycardic and passed away quickly
thereafter in the early evening on [**2135-3-5**].

The following issues were addressed during his brief
hospitalization:

# Acute anemia:  Possible etiologies of blood loss included GI
bleeding from the tumor at the esophageal stent or hemobilia
with recent stent placement are both highly possible, especially
in the setting of his coagulopathy and recent lovenox
administration. The initial description of bleed seemed more
consistent with epistaxis and ENT was consulted for an exam but
did not find any suspicious source of bleeding.  GI and ERCP
were consulted and wanted to hold off on evaluating the biliary
stent and possible biliary tree investigation due to continued
coagulopathy and risk of bleeding.  He was given a total of 4
units pRBCs during this hospitalization with Hct resolving to
26.  He was given vitamin K and FFP for elevated INR and DIC
labs were checked.  His labs did show evidence of hemolysis with
e
