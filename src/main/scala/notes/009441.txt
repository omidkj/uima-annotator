Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **]yo F with a h/o PAF, myeloproliferative disease, and
diastolic dysfunction, who was admitted to Surgery on [**2120-1-24**]
with RLQ abdominal pain and a CT showing fat stranding and
inflammation in the RLQ, thought likely to be diverticulitis
(history of appendectomy?).  She was started on levo/Flagyl and
observed, with marked improvement in her pain.
.
On [**1-25**], she converted to AF with RVR.    Had been strict NPO and
not getting her BB and ACE-i since admission.  Also had
increased O2 requirement.  She was transferred to the SICU where
she was started on a diltiazem gtt, but then dropped her
pressure.  She was then loaded on amiodarone and started on an
amiodarone gtt, after which she converted to sinus.
.
She currently feels well, with improved abdominal pain.  She
denies SOB, CP, palpitations, N/V.

.
CT abd ([**1-24**]):
1.  Fat stranding and inflammatory change in the right lower
quadrant in the region of the cecum without evidence of free
intraperitoneal air or abscess. The appendix and terminal ileum
are not visualized on this study. Differential diagnosis for
this finding includes acute appendicitis, diverticulitis and
less likely colitis.  Clinical correlation recommended.
2.  Distended gallbladder containing sludge without evidence of
wall
thickening to suggest acute cholecystitis.
3.  Small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.

4.  Prominent pancreatic duct without evidence of pancreatic
mass or calculi.
.
CXR ([**1-26**]):
1.  Mild CHF with cardiomegaly.
2.  Increase in left retrocardiac opacity which may represent
effusion and atelectasis; an underlying pneumonia cannot be
excluded.
3.  Slight increase in pulmonary edema at right lung base.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: [**Age over 90 **]yo F with h/o PAF, hypothyroidism, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **],
myeloproliferative disease, and diastolic dysfunction, who was
admitted to Surgery for abdominal pain thought [**12-28**]
diverticulitis vs. colitis, now being transferred to Medicine
for management of AF/RVR, CHF, and possible pneumonia.
.
# Abdominal pain:  She was admitted with a diagnosis of
diverticulitis vs. colitis.  She was put on bowel rest, given
IVF, and started on IV levofloxacin and metronidazole.  Her
abdominal pain improved gradually and she had only some residual
tenderness on the day of transfer to the MICU.  She was
tolerating pills and clear liquids.
.
# AF/RVR:  She was transferred to the SICU on [**1-26**] with RVR,
where she was started on an amiodarone gtt.  She converted to
sinus.  The amiodarone drip was discontinued on [**1-28**], and she was
started on an oral loading dose of amiodarone, and was also kept
on her beta blocker.  She remained in NSR until early AM on [**1-29**].
 She converted to atrial fibrillation and had rates to 140s, but
was maintaining her blood pressure and O2 saturation.  She was
given IV verapamil, which effectively controlled her rate, but
her SBP dropped to the 70s.  She was given 2 250mL boluses of
IVF, after which her BP normalized, but her oxygenation
worsened.  She converted to NSR and was stable for the next few
hours.  She again went into AF with RVR, but was having
hypotension and poor oxygenation this time.  She was started on
peripheral dopamine to support her blood pressure and was
transferred to the MICU.
.
# CHF: Diastolic dysfunction, EF>55%.  Volume overloaded on
exam, increased O2 requirement, likely secondary to IVF
administration during treatment for diverticulitis.  Started
gentle diuresis on [**1-28**] with IV Lasix.  Had to be put on NRB in
setting of fluids for hypotension when she went into RVR on [**1-29**].
 Could be [**12-28**] acute pulmonary edema as a result of her diastolic
dysfunction in the setting of atrial fibrillation.  She was
maintained on her beta blocker.
.
# Myeloproliferative disease: Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] and Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].  Unclear how to interpret the increased leukocytosis.
- continue hydroxyurea at outpatient dose for now
.
# Hypothyroidism:
- continue levothyroxine at outpatient dose
MICU Course:  Patient was admitted to the floor given
hypotension, hypoxia and afib with RVR on the floor.  On
transfer patient's Blood pressure was low and HR was ~140-160s.
Electrical cardioversion was attempted with 50J which slowed the
rate down briefly, she was again given amiodarone IV.  Initially
her HR came down to 70s.  However over the next several days she
continued to have episodes of RVR with HR upto 120s.  She also
had high O2 requirement.  Bipap was attempted but patient
refused this.  She was clear that shed did not want any further
aggressive measures.  She did not want to be intubated and did
not want any surgeries.  After discussion with family and
palliative care team goals of cares were changed to comfort
measures. She expired on [**2120-2-2**].
