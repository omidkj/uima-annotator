Chief Complaint:
right sided body numbness

History of Present Illness:
This is a 58 year old gentleman with history that includes
transient ischemic stroke 3 years ago who presented to an
outside hospital today after experiencing right foot numbness at
0820 this am.  The numbness progressed quickly up the right leg
to the right trunk, down the right hand to the level of the
wrist, and further up the body to the right neck, face, and
head.

The patient stated that it is difficult to move his left arm and
leg due to the numbness and that he felt uncoordinated. He
reported that he had leg and arm weakness on the right, leg
worse than the
arm.  He had a headache a level of [**12-25**] on a [**12-1**] pain scale.

CT head was done showing a left lesion with hemorrhage.

Pertinent Results:
[**2105-7-3**] CT head
2.5-cm hyperdense extra-axial mass extending from the inner
table
of the left posterior frontal/anterior parietal bone with small
surrounding subarachnoid hemorrhage and possible internal
hemorrhage. At the level of this mass, there is left parietal 4
x 3.1 x 2.4 cm intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding
edema. This may represent, though uncommon, a convexity
meningioma presenting with intracerebral peritumoral hemorrhage.
Recommend MRI to further evaluate. Other lesion not excluded.

[**2105-7-4**] MRA brain
2.5 x 2.2 cm extra-axial mass with surrounding meningeal
enhancement and associated intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the
left parietal lobe with edema as described above. The
extra-axial location and involvement of the adjacent bone is
suggestive of a meningioma but other forms of more aggressive
extra-axial masses should be considered in the differential
diagnosis given the presence of extensive hemorrhage which is
somewhat unusual for a meningioma.

[**2105-7-4**] CT abdomen pelvis
1. Nonspecific subcentimeter scattered hypodense hepatic
lesions. If
clinically indicated, a hepatic MRI could be obtained for
further evaluation as small cystic foci are difficult to
differentiate from small solid lesions on CT exam.

2. Mild wall thickening of the distal terminal ileum which may
represent an infectious or inflammatory process. Adjacent
prominent mesenteric lymph nodes are also noted. While this
finding does not appear malignant, given the patient's history
and if clinically indicated, the terminal ileum might be
amenable to visualization by colonoscopy.
3. Nonspecific enlarged left retrocrural lymph node measuring
1.6 cm.
4. Two indeterminant left adrenal nodules, statistically most
commonly
adenomas. If hepatic MRI is performed, attempt can be made to
characterize
these as well.

MRI abdomen [**2105-7-5**]
1. 14mm left retrocrural lymph node. The significance of this is
unknown, but raises concern.
2. Multiple lesions within the liver, which were indeterminate
on CT, most
likely represent multiple biliary hamartomas or cyst. No
concerning liver
lesion.
3. Two left adrenal nodules likely represent benign adrenal
adenomas, but this is not definite as this was not a dedicated
adrenal MRI.

MRI Brain [**2105-7-9**]
Left parietal mass with invasion of the adjacent dural
enhancement indicating meningeal mass, likely a meningioma.
However,
hemorrhage would be unusual with a simple meningioma and an
aggressive
meningioma should be suspected. Although flow is visualized in
the adjacent superior sagittal sinus, thrombosis of an adjacent
vein could not be excluded as a cause of hemorrhage.

MRI Head [**2105-7-10**]
1. Status post left parietal craniotomy and resection. Normal
postoperative changes.
2. No acute infarction. No hydrocephalus.
3. No large area of hemorrhage. Small postoperative subdural
hematoma.
4. Fatty replacement of the left parotid, unchanged from prior
study








Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) **] was admitted to the neuromedicine service on
[**2105-7-3**] for full work up of brain mass. CT and MRI imaging
demonstrated an extra-axial mass with surrounding meningeal
enhancement and associated intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Appearance is suggestive of a meningioma, but given the
associated hemorrhage other more aggressive lesions could not be
ruled out. CT abdomen/pelvis and follow up MRI showed no
significant abnormalities to suggest malignancy. Tumor markers
were negative. He was on Keppra 1500mg [**Hospital1 **] and Gabapentin 300mg
Q8hrs for dysesthesias. He remained stable and was transfered to
the OR for craniotomy on [**7-9**]. He was transfered after
extubation to the ICU.  On POD#1 he was seen and his R leg
strength improved. He was transferred to the floor in stable
condition. He was able to void on his own and he was tolerating
a PO diet. He was seen by the physical therapy team and it was
recommended he be discharged to rehab for further care. He will
be DC'd to rehab in stable condition.
