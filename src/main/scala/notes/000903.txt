History of Present Illness:
Briefly, Mrs. [**Known lastname 9037**] is a 62 year old female with a past
medical history significant for ESRD on MWF HD, DM 2, HTN, COPD,
carotid stenosis s/p PCI and PVD admitted for fever and found to
have MSSA bacteremia from an infected AV graft s/p AVG revision.

course has been complicated by a new O2 requirement felt to be
atelectasis versus volume overload.

IMAGING:
[**2163-9-25**] CT Torso:
IMPRESSION: 1. Mild perinephric fat stranding bilaterally,
without hydronephrosis or
nephrolithiasis. Recommend correlation with urinalysis. 2. Small
right upper lobe pulmonary nodules. These may represent the
residual of consolidation which was previously present in that
location. Nevertheless, followup to exclude pulmonary nodules is
recommended with a dedicated CT scan of the chest in
approximately 6-12 months. 3. Unchanged partially calcified
nodularity of the right adrenal gland. 4. Uterine fibroids. 5.
Atherosclerotic disease.
.
[**2163-9-27**] TRANSTHORACIC ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic
(EF>75%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.
No vegetation seen (cannot definitively exclude).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2163-4-22**],
findings are similar.
.
[**2163-9-29**] TRANSESOPHAGEAL ECHO:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of endocarditis. Hyperdynamic left
ventricle with symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
.
[**10-1**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) 6452**]/THORACIC SPINE W/O CONT:
Non-enhanced examination, with: 1. No finding to suggest
thoracolumbar vertebral osteomyelitis, discitis or paraspinal,
or epidural fluid collection or abscess. 2. Transitional anatomy
at the lumbosacral junction, with numbering convention, as
described above.
3. Diffusely and uniformly hypointense vertebral bone marrow
signal, likely related to the ESRD on hemodialysis. 4. T8-9 and
T9-10 left paracentral and foraminal protrusions, respectively,
without spinal cord or exiting neural impingement. 5. Normal
thoracic spinal cord caliber and intrinsic signal intensity. 6.
L4-5: Disc degeneration with moderate bulging and bilateral
subarticular zone stenosis without definite neural impingement.

Brief Hospital Course:
# MSSA Bacteremia/AVG infection: Ms. [**Known lastname 9037**] was transferred to
the MICU shortly after admission for hypotension, fever and
altered mental status concerning for sepsis.  Initially, she was
covered empirically with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.
 Antibiotics were changed to nafcillin 2 g IV Q4 hours once
blood cultures returned MSSA.  The source was felt to be an
infected AV graft in her left arm.  On [**2163-9-26**] she was taken to
the OR and had placement of a jump graft in the left arm by the
transplant surgery service.  On Tuesday [**2163-9-27**], she had a
hemodialysis session through a temporary HD line in the right
IJ.  During this HD session, she felt unwell with abdominal pain
and developed a fever shortly thereafter.  Blood cultures were
sent, as there was concern for a transient bacteremia.  TTE from
[**2163-9-27**] and TEE from [**2163-9-29**] showed no evidence of endocarditis.
She intermittently complained of back and neck pain similar to
her previous arthritis pain, but an MRI of the thoracic and
lumbar spine showed no evidence of thoracolumbar vertebral
osteomyelitis, discitis, or paraspinal or epidural fluid
collection or abscess. The day prior to discharge the patient
was switched to cefazolin which will be dosed on dialysis days
for a total 6 week course.

# Bleeding/Anemia: Patient had ongoing oozing/bleeding from AVG
site. Hematocrit trended down but ultimately stabilized. She
likely has uremic platelets and requires aspirin and plavix for
[**Doctor First Name 3098**] disease s/p PCI. Received three total doses of DDAVP as
well as erythropoietin with hemodialysis.

# ESRD: Patient initially had a right internal jugular temporary
line but had repeated problems with clotting of the line. The AV
graft was accessed for dialysis occasionally. She had a RIJ HD
tunnelled line placed on [**10-3**]. She received nephrocaps and her
calcium acetate dose was increased to 1334mg TID with meals per
renal recommendations.

# HTN: Home antihypertensives were held during most of the
admission, but the patient began to have SBPs in the low 200s.
Her outpatient regimen was restarted prior to discharge.

# Hypoxia
