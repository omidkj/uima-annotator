CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Stage 4 decubitus ulcer; surgical wound
dehiscence.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83-year-old female
with a history of inferior wall myocardial infarction,
obesity, and chronic renal insufficiency who presented to
[**Hospital 1474**] Hospital Emergency Room on [**2160-1-20**] with
abdominal pain.

An abdominal computed tomography at that time revealed free
air, and the patient was taken emergently to the operating
room.  An exploratory laparotomy revealed a perforated
duodenal ulcer and cholecystitis.  An open cholecystectomy,
lysis of adhesions, and oversewing the duodenal ulcer was
performed.  A jejunostomy tube was placed at that time.  A
right lower extremity ulcer was evaluated by Surgery but not
intervened upon.  The patient was transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit, and on [**1-27**] had a tracheostomy
placed due to difficulty weaning secondary to numerous
episodes of mucus plugging.  The sputum was positive for
Pseudomonas, and the surgical wound was positive for
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas
at that time.  The patient was treated with intravenous
ceftazidime and vancomycin for a full course.

Her postoperative course was complicated by anemia requiring
several transfusions and self-terminating runs of
supraventricular tachycardia (treated with as needed beta
blockers), and an echocardiogram revealing an ejection
fraction of 55% and mild left ventricular hypertrophy.  The
patient's renal failure improved when started on a ACE
inhibitor.  Tube feeds were started for malnutrition.  Epogen
iron for treatment of anemia of chronic disease, and the
patient was discharged to rehabilitation for further care.

Today, the patient was transferred from rehabilitation when
it was discovered that she had feculent material in her stage
4 decubitus ulcer.  The patient was taken to the Emergency
Department where a white blood cell count was noted to be 24
at [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital.  The patient was monitored on telemetry
and was hemodynamically stable.  The Emergency Department
attending discussed the case with the surgical attending who
felt that the patient would need debridement of skin graft by
Vascular Surgery.  Tube feeds were stopped this a.m. since
there was a question of jejunostomy tube dysfunction.  The
patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] Medical Intensive Care Unit for further medical
management and surgical evaluation.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories
upon admission revealed white blood cell count was 24.2,
hematocrit was 29.6, and platelets were 379.  Differential
with 93.1 neutrophils, 3.6 lymphocytes, and 2.4 monocytes).
Electrolytes revealed sodium was 138, potassium was 4.4,
chloride was 96, bicarbonate was 37, blood urea nitrogen was
69, creatinine was 1.2, and blood glucose was 100.  Calcium
was 8.9.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed temperature was 98.8, heart rate was 109 (atrial
fibrillation), blood pressure was 137/69, respiratory rate
was 17, and synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation
was 600 X 11, FIO2 was 0.5%, positive end-expiratory pressure
was 10, positive end-airway pressure was 36, flat 17, 98%.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed
mucous membranes were dry.  Cardiovascular examination
revealed normal first heart sounds and second heart sounds.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  The lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  The abdomen revealed large wound
dehiscence in the ventral region.  Extremity examination
revealed a large necrotic stage 4 decubitus ulcer foul odor.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit Service and was followed very closely by
Plastic Surgery, General Surgery, and Vascular Surgery.

1.  DECUBITUS ULCER ISSUES:  The patient had her stage 4
decubitus ulcer debrided times three by the vascular
surgeons.  The patient had Decon solution applied to the area
times four times, and these dressings were changed over to
wet-to-dry dressings t.i.d.   The patient was started on
empiric antibiotics, since it was thought that she also had
osteomyelitis.  Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was notably
very high.  A sacral x-ray was unrevealing, because it was a
poor study due to her body habitus.  The patient was started
on vancomycin for presumed osteomyelitis which was to be
continued for eight weeks; according to the plastic surgeons.

The patient would need aggressive wound care to this region;
including an air mattress, frequent turnings, and evaluation
by the Plastic Service in eight weeks to insure that this
decubitus ulcer was improving.  She also required morphine
prior to her dressing changes.

2.  VENTRAL HERNIA ISSUES:  As far as the patient's ventral
hernia defect, the jejunostomy tube was evaluated by
Radiology, and it was noted that the jejunostomy tube was
functional, and there was no extravasation of dye around the
jejunostomy tube insertion site.  The patient tolerated the
procedure well, and feeding tubes were started once again.

3.  VENOUS STASIS ULCER ISSUES:  As far as the patient's
right lower extremity venous stasis ulcer, this was evaluated
by Vascular Surgery who felt that dressing changes were
appropriate at this time and that she should follow up with
Vascular Surgery at [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital for an eventual
split-thickness skin graft, but that no intervention at this
time was necessary.

The ventral surgical wound dehiscence was also evaluated by
General Surgery who cleaned the wound by debriding it and
continued wet-to-dry dressing changes, and it was thought
that there would be no need to correct the defect any other
way, and that this wound should heal by secondary intention.

Blood cultures were taken at the time of admission, and they
rapidly grew out 4/4 bottles of gram-negative organisms which
were later identified as Klebsiella.  The patient was started
on Zosyn for this, and subsequent blood cultures times three
were negative.  The patient's temperature and white blood
cell count came down from an initial of 24.2 to 13 at the
time of discharge.

The sensitivities on the blood cultures revealed
pan-sensitive organisms, and it was thought that a 2-week
treatment with Zosyn should be sufficient to clear the
Klebsiella bacteremia; which most probably came fr
