Allergies:
Heparin Agents / Ceftriaxone

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p Fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left hip Dynamic hip screw (open reduction and
internal fixation).

History of Present Illness:
Although the pt was responding to questions, a complete history
was difficult to obtain.  The following HPI was obtained from
chart biopsy and son.
.
81 yo chronically ill female with MMP, resident at [**Hospital 582**]
Nursing Home who presented to [**Location (un) 745**] [**Hospital 3678**] Hospital after
falling out of bed.  The pt normally requires assist from two
people for repositioning.  On [**2173-11-28**], the pt was trying to
get up unassisted and fell out of bed onto her left side.  The
pt was BIBA to [**Location (un) 745**] [**Location (un) 3678**] and was found to have a left
proximal humerous, left proximal femur, left supracondylar knee
fracture, and left rib fracture.  The pt was given dilaudid IV
and fentanyl for pain control with good success as [**Name8 (MD) **] RN
report.  The ECG at NW was NSR at 70, LAD, nml interval, RSR'
in v1, TWI in III and F.
.
Currently patient reports some back pain but is unable provide
any history about the fall or her medical history. Per son, pt
cannot give much history when in pain for sick. She has very
littel functional capcity only to and from wheelchair with
assistance. He denies any hx of MI or chest pain, but she does
have pain all over all the time from her RA.


Past Medical History:
1) Felty's Syndrome (RA, Splenomegally, Granulocytopenia),
Anticardiolopin Ab, multiple DVTs, PEs s/p IVC filter many years
ago (currently not anticoagulated due to fall risk).
2) Cryptogenic cirrhoisis with portal htn and esophageal varices
(no etoh hx) and hx of large GI bleed
3) Osteoporisis [**2-10**] long term prednisone use, and resultant
multiple fractures
4) COPD on 2L home O2 but only for the past year since at
[**Location (un) 582**]
5) s/p CVA with residual aphasia
6) "dementia (though daughter denies this)
7) hypothyroidism,
8) H pylori
9) s/p TKR

assistance, only minimal activity, no shortness of breath,

.
LLE plain film [**2173-11-28**]: Comminuted fracture of the
intertrochanteric region of the left proximal femur.
.
Pelvis CT [**2173-11-28**]:
1. Comminuted oblique intertrochanteric fracture of the left
proximal femur with slight varus angulation and an associated
hematoma tracking along the left hamstring musculature. Both hip
joints are otherwise preserved.
2. Multiple chronic fracture within the left subcapital femur,
left symphysis pubis, right inferior pubic ramus, and the
intertrochanteric right femur (with placement of a dynamic
compression screw).
3. Healing stress fracture of the right sacral ala.
.
.
CXR [**2173-11-30**]:
A focal opacity in the mid left lung is better defined on
today's exam. In addition, there is likely a developing opacity
in the right lower lobe. Multiple healing right posterolateral
rib fractures are identified. The heart is normal size and the
mediastinal is remarkable for a calcified and tortuous aorta. No
pulmonary edema or pleural effusions identified. Calcified
gallstones and previous spine surgery again identified.
IMPRESSION: Likely developing multifocal pneumonia.
.
CTA CHEST [**2173-11-30**]
1) No acute pulmonary embolus
2) Atelectasis of much of the left lower lobe with extensive
mucous debris vs. aspirated content within the right and left
lower bronchi and their segmental branches.This should be
addressed with respiratory therapy.
3) Moderate centrilobular emphysema. Mild subpleural
honeycombing in the mid to lower zone due to background of
interstitial lung disease.This distribution may be due to
connective tissue disease if there is a history of this (Felty's
is mentioned in the request details).Other possibilities would
included interstitial pulmonary fibrosis or drug reaction
depending on the clinical history.
4) Cholelithiasis
.
LEFT HUMERUS FILM [**2173-12-10**]:
Impacted humeral head fracture. Of note, this appears to have
been present on chest x-ray dating back to [**2173-11-30**].

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 6323**] is an 81 yo woman with hx of Felty's syndrome,
osteoperosis, dementia who presented after falling out of bed at
her nursing home with resultant left sided fractures.
.
She was found to have a comminuted oblique intertrochanteric
fracture of the left proximal femur.  The ortho team evaluated
her initially and recommended ORIF of the hip fracture.  While
undergoing pre-op by ortho for surgery, the patient developed
hypoxia secondary to aspiration pneumonia.  Initially, she was
placed on levofloxacin, flagyl, and vancomycin.  Later, she
became progressively more hypoxic and hypotensive.  She was
bolused and given stress dose steroids for hypotension.  The
medical team at that time had a discussion with patient's
family, and because her prognosis was poor, the decision was
made to change her status to Comfort Measures Only.  The family
wanted to discontinue all medications except for the antibiotics
and pain control/comfort meds.
.
About 48 hours later, the medical team noted marked clinical
improvement.  The patient was more alert, blood pressure was
