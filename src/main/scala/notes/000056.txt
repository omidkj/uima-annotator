Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Heparin Agents

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 943**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension with elevated lactate, code sepsis.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right internal jugular venous catheter placement.


History of Present Illness:
44 yoM PMH ESRD secondary to Brights disease on HD s/p two
failed renal transplants, HCV, CHF with EF 20%, AF on coumadin
who presented to the ED with a two week history of diffuse
abdominal pain with one day of nausea and vomiting [**2114-12-24**]. Two
weeks prior to admission the patient began to experience diffuse
dull abdominal pain without nausea or vomiting and loose stools
2-3 times per day. The patient believed this was secondary to
fluid overload. One week prior to presentation the patient
complained of subjective fevers, cough productive of yellow
sputum. His nephrologist gave him a five-day course of
azithromycin. The patient had persistent symptoms and was
started on levofloxacin by his PCP two days prior to admission.
The patient had a history of tylenol use 3g/day for 5 days prior
to admission for fever, body aches. The day prior to admission
the patient began to experience worsened abdominal pain
associated with nausea, a few episodes of vomiting,
nonbilious/nonbloody, and diarrhea 4-5 times per day, watery,
nonbloody.
.
In the ED the patient was found to be hypotensive with lactate
of 5.6 and a code sepsis was called. He was given Vanco, Flagyl
and Zosyn for presumed infection. He was given Decadron for
presumed adrenal insufficiency. He was also given Calcium
gluconate, sodium bicarbonate, Insulin and D50 for hyperkalemia.
A CVL was placed and he received 3L of NS with normalization of
pressures. He was transferred to the MICU.
.
In the MICU the patient's LFTs were significantly elevated and
peaked at ALT 3016, AST 2956, LDH [**2064**], INR 4.3 on [**12-25**]. This
was thought to be secondary to shock liver in the setting of
hypotension/sepsis versus tylenol toxicity despite negative
serum tylenol. LFTs subsequently trending down.
.
Upon transfer to the floor, the patient continues to complain of
cough productive of yellow sputum. Denies chest pain, shortness
of breath. The patient denied any fevers/chills, abdominal pain,
nausea, vomiting. Diarrhea improving. Denies dysuria/hematuria;
minimal urine output while on HD. Denies lightheadedness. Denies
myalgias/arthralgias. Review of systems otherwise negative in
detail.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2114-12-24**]
IMPRESSION:
Clear lungs, mild pulmonary congestion and cardiomegaly,
unchanged.
.
CT ABD W&W/O C  [**2114-12-25**]
IMPRESSION:
1) Cardiomegaly and hepatomegaly with abnormal liver perfusion
likely secondary to passive congestion (nutmeg liver). No focal
hepatic abscess or adjacent hematoma.
2) Cholelithiasis and sludge/vicarious excretion of IV contrast.
Small amount of pericholecystic fluid is present. The fluid
could be due to patient's liver dysfunction/third spacing from
CHF. If cholecystitis is of clinical concern, HIDA scan can be
performed provided the total bilirubin is not elevated.
3) Hyperdense renal cortex in left lower quadrant transplanted
kidney. Findings are most likely due to chronic rejection or
prior ATN. There is apparent thickening of the arterial wall
supplying the transplant. No hydronephrosis or perinephric
collection.
4) Minor anatomic variant involving liver vasculature as
described above. Hepatic veins and portal venous system appear
widely patent.
5) 6 mm lesion in head of pancreas. Continued follow up of this
area is recommended on future studies.
6) Areas of ground glass opacity and intralobular septal
thickening in the lung bases, most likely due to fluid
overload/CHF. Nodular areas of opacity are also present which
could be due to infection. Continued followup is reccomended.
7) Small lymph nodes and vague retroperitoneal stranding.
Findings could be due to CHF.

ECG Study Date of [**2114-12-25**]  2:41:34 AM
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
Intraventricular conduction delay - possible atypical left
bundle branch block
Anterior myocardial infarct, age indeterminate - may be old
Nonspecific ST-T wave changes
Since previous tracing of [**2114-2-7**], ventricular rate faster
.
ECHO Study Date of [**2114-12-28**]
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There is
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed. Left
ventricular dysnchrony is present.
3. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular
systolic
function appears depressed.
4. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The effective
regurgitant orifice is >=0.40cm2
6. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
7. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
8. Compared with the report of the prior study of [**2114-1-8**], LV
function is probably worse.
