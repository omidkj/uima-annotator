Femoral line placed

History of Present Illness:
75 y/o M [**First Name3 (LF) **] speaking only PMH ESRD on HD, CAD, PAF, COPD,
HTN who presensts with altered mental status of 2 days duration.
Initially felt to be secondary to percocet use at rehab, but HD
facility was concerned and sent patient to be evaluated. Per
family patient is AOx3 at baseline but has been more confused
recently. Notes slow decline over several days since being at
the rehab. States he was also given a "sleeping pill" the day
before admission. Family did not notice any increased cough,
SOB, or fever.
.
Patient was recently admitted [**Date range (3) 5527**] for left humeral
fracture, hypoxia and inability to care for himself at home. For
left humeral fracture patient was evaluated by ortho who
recommended sling. Hypoxia was felt to be secondary to mild COPD
exacerbation and was treated with aggressive neb therapy and
oral steroids. At time of discharge his O2 sats were 90% on RA
with occasional desats to the high 80s and discharged on 1L NC
to be weaned as tolerated. Patient was discharged to rehab.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 96.9 86 107/84 22 91. Patient spiked
a temp to 100.2. rectally. CT head demonstrated no
abnormalities. CXR demonstrated right lower lobe infiltrate.
Patient was given levofloxacin and zosyn and 1L NS. A groin CVL
was placed. His LUE was noted to be swollen and echymotic but an
u/s revealed no DVT. Ortho evaluated it in the ED and
recommended continued sling and NWB. He was agitated and
confused, so received 5mg Zyprexa. Vitals on transfer were 98.8
rectal, HR 63, BP 149/52, RR 13, 100% facemask. He would
reportedly desat to upper 80s on 6L NC so he was admitted to the
MICU for further care.
.
On the floor, still mildly agitated and confused. Unable to
obtain further ROS.

change in
cerebral volume loss and chronic microvascular ischemic changes.
Bilateral
maxillary sinus disease.

[**2169-12-31**] Humerus AP/Lat:
LEFT HUMERUS, THREE VIEWS: Evaluation is limited by patient
positioning.
Within this limitation, there is no significant change in the
comminuted left humeral neck fracture with approximately 2 cm of
foreshortening. There is nodislocation. There is no new
fracture. There is subtle soft tissue calcification noted on the
second and third images at the level of the fracture which may
represent early callous formation. No radiopaque foreign body is
identified.

[**2169-12-31**] RUE Ultrasound:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT. Exam is limited due to
patient-related
factors.

[**2170-1-1**] Abdomen upright:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of obstruction; incomplete assessment
for free air -upright or left lateral decubitus views are
recommended to better assess for perforation.

IMPRESSION:
1. Innumerable cysts seen within the liver and right kidney.
