Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1**]
Chief Complaint:
Emergent small bowel obstruction
Bilateral pneumonia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2103-1-17**]: Exploratory laparotomy, extensive lysis of adhesions
and repair of ventral hernia by component separation technique.
[**2103-1-30**]: Flexible bronchoscopy with therapeutic aspiration and
functional study.


History of Present Illness:
This patient was transferred from her rehabilitation facility to
the [**Hospital1 18**] ED as an emergency with a bowel obstruction and
bilateral pneumonia.  She was a very heavy lady and had
previously undergone at least 2 operations for bowel obstruction
related to an incisional hernia. More than this we did not know
owing to the emergent arrival of this patient at this hospital
and her previous surgery had been performed elsewhere.

Pertinent Results:
[**1-15**] Abd CT:
1.  Bibasilar consolidation, which may represent aspiration
pneumonia in the setting of small-bowel obstruction.
2.  Right abdominal hernia containing loops of small bowel with
evidence of small-bowel obstruction.  No bowel wall thickening,
significant stranding or pneumatosis to suggest bowel
infarction.
3.  Enhancing left renal mass and adjacent complex cyst
concerning for renal cell carcinoma.
4.  Sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
5.  Thickened right adrenal gland, which can be better assessed
with CT with adrenal protocol once patient's acute issues
resolve.

[**1-28**] Chest CT:
1.  Severe tracheomalacia.  Bronchial tree is patent, but study
is not
designed for assessment of bronchomalacia.  Nevertheless, both
lower lobes and the posterior segment of the right upper lobe
are collapsed.
2.  Possible mitral valve dysfunction due to heavy annulus
calcification. Left atrial enlargement.

[**1-30**] Flexible bronchoscopy:
Dynamic maneuvers revealed no significant loss of airway patency
in the trachea and less than 50% reduction patency of both
main-stem bronchi on
forced expiration. The bronchoscope was passed into the right
and left airways were a therapeutic aspiration was performed of
mild to moderate secretions, left greater than right. The
airways were patent to the level of the 4th order bronchi.

Brief Hospital Course:
Brief summary: 75-year-old woman admitted [**2103-1-15**] following
emergent exploratory laparotomy for small bowel obstruction.  On
admission patient was septic secondary to bilateral pneumonias.
Her sepsis was successfully treated with 14-day course of IV
antibiotics.  She was endotracheally intubated for the majority
of her stay as she repeatedly refused tracheostomy and was
extubated on [**2103-1-31**].  She was discharged to rehab facility on
[**2103-2-2**] in stable condition requiring O2.

Neuro: Immediately post-op, patient was sedated and pain control
was adequate.  After sedation was discontinued, her pain was
controlled with prn fentanyl. At discharge she had no pain
medication requirements.  After sedation was discontinued,
patient was alert and interactive throughout her stay; no focal
neurologic deficits were seen throughout her stay.

CV: Troponins were elevated on admission but ECG did not
demonstrate acute ischemic changes.  [**1-16**] ECHO: Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%), tivial
mitral regurgitation, mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. On [**1-24**] patient complained of bilateral calf pain;
exam showed positive [**Last Name (un) 5813**] signs; BLE DVT scan was negative
for DVT.  During her stay she was transfused 2units of PRBCs on
[**1-18**] and [**1-31**] for hematocrits of 22 and Hct rose appropriately.
At discharge patient was CV stable.

Pulm: Patient presented with bilateral pneumonias; this was
confirmed on admission CXR.  She was intubated and started on a
14 day course of IV Zosyn, Vancomycin, and Flagyl.  She remained
on endotracheal ventilation from admission on [**1-15**] until
[**2103-1-31**].  Several discussions were held with the patient and her
family regarding the therapeutic benefits of performing a
tracheostomy; however, the patient firmly refused this procedure
throughout her inpatient stay.  Intubational sedation was
stopped on [**2103-1-17**].  She was followed with serial CXR that
showed gradual improvement in her pneumonia.  On [**2103-1-19**] she
developed increasing pressure requirement; CXR demonstrated a
large right sided pneumothorax.  A chest tube was placed with
improved ventilation and follow-up CXR showed no pneumothorax.
This chest tube was removed on [**2103-1-25**] and serial follow-up CXR
demonstrated no reaccumulation of pneumothorax.  The patient
failed CPAP trials until [**2103-1-23**], following which her CPAP was
graduall
