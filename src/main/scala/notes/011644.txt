77 M with end-stage Parkinson's Disease, resident of [**Location 1036**]

tachycardia and tachypnea, febrile to 101.1, resp rate in the
30's, and HR 110-130s. Initially received 3L NS, levofloxacin
for presumed UTI with positive UA, though cultures from the
outside hospital were not performed. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
into the MICU.  In MICU, the patient was normotensive, continued
on Levofloxacin, diuresed for increasing crackles on exam and
being 5 liters positive.  He was then called out to the floor
without fever, stable hemodynamics, and with a decreasing white
count.

Brief Hospital Course:
77M with dementia, end-stage Parkinson's Disease, CAD, and CHF
who was admitted to the MICU for UTI with sepsis.

1.)UTI with sepsis -- Initially quite ill appearing, with
fevers, tachycardia, hypotension, and tachypnea, Mr. [**Known lastname 99933**] [**Last Name (Titles) 99934**]d well to fluids, was transiently on pressors, and
levofloxacin.  Within a day, the patient was off pressors,
required no more fluid support, and demonstrated a dramatic
decline in his WBC.  From there, he was moved to the floor,
where he continued to do well without any additional need for
blood pressure support.  His WBC remained low, and he remained
afebrile.  He was felt ready for discharge on an oral course of
levofloxacin.  Unfortunately, the patient did not have any
cultures grow out despite grossly positive urinalyses, yet the
brisk clinical response certainly points to a sensitive
organism.

2.)CHF -- The patient has a known EF of 45% and became volume
overloaded in the setting of aggressive volume resuscitation, a
necessary component of the treatment for sepsis.  He then was
diuresed while in the MICU, and by the time he was called out to
the floor, had an improved chest x-ray and was satting well,
with a lung exam that, though limited by poor inspiratory
effort, demonstrated decreasing rales.  He was restarted on his
metoprolol and lisinopril, without requirement for daily
diuretics.

3.)Coronary artery disease -- The patient's disease remained
quiescent throughout his hospital stay, with no evidence of
ischemia.  He remained on atorvastatin, clopidogrel, metoprolol,
and lisinopril.

4.)Sinus tachycardia -- On the floor, the patient again became
tachycardic, without fever, hypotension, or hypoxia.  His Hct
was unchanged, and the tachycardia did not respond to diuresis.
At this point, the most likely etiology was felt to be
beta-blocker withdrawal, as he was significantly off of his
outpatient dose; slowly titrated back up to this level, he was
subsequently found to be in the 70's.

5.)Anemia -- Although low, his hematocrit was at its baseline of
28-30. Guaiac positive early in the admission, he was
subsequently negative and remained as such.  Previous iron
studies demonstrated an anemia of chronic disease, with a normal
B12.

6.)Parkinsonism -- The patient was continued on his
carbidopa/levodopa with no change in symptoms.
