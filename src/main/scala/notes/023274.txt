INITIAL STUDIES:

- CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2152-7-3**] 11:01 PM
IMPRESSION:  Patient is status post right subclavian central
venous line placement with catheter tip overlying the cavoatrial
junction. Again noted are diffuse bilateral hazy opacities
predominantly perihilar and fissural fluid consistent with
congestive heart failure.

- PERC PLCMT ENTROCLYSIS TUBE  [**2152-7-5**] 2:15 PM
IMPRESSION:
1) Son[**Name (NI) **] of the percutaneous gastric tract demonstrating no
evidence of contrast extravasation.
2) Successful placement of 18 French dual lumen
gastrojejunostomy tube. The jejunal port can be used for tube
feeds at any time. The gastric port can be open to gravity
drainage or aspiration if necessary.

- EKG [**2152-7-4**] 03:48 AM
Sinus rhythm. Diffuse low voltage. Early precordial R wave
progression.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2147-12-10**] the Q-T interval
has normalized. The rate has increased and the anterior ST-T
wave abnormalities have improved. Otherwise, no diagnostic
interim change.

- CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2152-7-6**]
Multifocal patchy areas of consolidation present in the lower
lobes, right upper lobe, and left perihilar area are increased.
The cardiomediastinal contour is unremarkable.  Right subclavian
central
venous line and tip unchanged in position over the cavoatrial
junction.
Tracheal tube in adequate position.  There is no pneumothorax.
Small right pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
56 year-old female with Down syndrome, dementia, seizure
disorder transferred from OSH for sepsis.  Treated with IVF and
pressors for hypotension, levqaquin, then vanc/meropenum for
pulmonary infection and was continued on home medications for
other ongoing medical problems.

1. Sepsis/hypotension:  Initially with SBP in the 70s at rehab
(and on dopamine for short period of time).  BP improved to SBP
>100 when she presented; later required epinephrine gtt (morning
of [**7-5**]).  This was continued for approximately 24 hours,
discontinued on the morning of the 27th, then restarted for ~5
hours on the morning of the 28th.  Thereafter, she remained off
pressors with SBPs in the 90s.  The leading etiology for her
fever/sepsis was pulmonary in nature; given positive sputum for
pseudomonas, was treated with meropenum (initially given
levaquin, then [**Last Name (un) 2830**]/vanc, given MRSA history).  Plan is for a 10
day course to end on [**2152-7-14**].  At discharge, she remained
afebrile and normotensive and was switched from Meropenem to
Cefepime to complete treatment of VAP at extended care facility.

2. Respiratory failure:  This was felt to be [**1-13**] pulmonary edema
in the setting of IVF recussitation in the setting of
hypotension/sepsis.  Is on the vent at rehab (SIMV with PS of
[**11-24**] and 5 of PEEP).  Initially on AC, then changed back to
rehab settings.  After initial low UO, did diurese on own.

3. Seizure disorder:  While the patient did have myoclonus while
an inpatient, she did not have any overt seizure activity.  Was
continued on trileptal.

4. Anemia:  Presented with Hct of 25 (baseline in OMR of >30).
Was transfused 2 units of pRBCs given ScvO2 <70.  After initial
transfusion, Hct remained stable and was 32.4 on discharge.

5. Hypothyroid: Was stable during admission.  Continued on home
dose of levothyroxine.

6. FEN
- IVF: Initially recieved IVF for hypotension.  After CXR showed
pulmonary edema, IVF were stopped and she was diuresed.
- Lytes: Repleted PRN.
- Nutrition: Initially NPO, then switched back to her home tube
feeds.

7. PPX:
- Was on aspiration and MRSA precaution
- PPI
- SC heparin

8. Communication: Brother, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 23306**], is her medical
guardian; PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 653**]

9. Code: DNR, not DNI

10. Access:
- Right sc placed in ED on [**7-3**]

11.  Dispo: to be discharged to extending care facility.
