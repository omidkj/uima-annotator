Service:  [**Last Name (un) **]


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80 year old
female with a history of diabetes, hypertension and
hypercholesterolemia and a questionable history of myocardial
infarction who was to undergo laparoscopic placement of
peritoneal dialysis catheter on [**2112-6-3**]. However, the
beginning of the procedure was complicated by bowel
perforation via trocar placement. The procedure was converted
to an open procedure and the perforation was closed. No
peritoneal dialysis catheter was placed. For operative
details, please see operative note. There was a small pinhole
injury at the transverse colon which was repaired. There was
no gross peritoneal contamination identified. The patient was
stable. Postoperatively, the patient did well, was afebrile
and the vitals were stable. However, the postop course was
complicated by bouts of atrial fibrillation and the patient
was seen by Cardiology immediately postoperatively. The
patient had a brief, about 30 minute, bout of atrial
fibrillation postop in the setting of decreased blood
pressure thought to be secondary to sedation and converted
spontaneously and the blood pressure improved. However, over
the course of the next few days, the patient continued to go
back into atrial fibrillation and was ultimately placed on
amiodarone drip.

ALLERGIES:  ACE inhibitor causes increased K.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Lopressor 150 mg [**Hospital1 **], levofloxacin
250 mg qd, Flagyl 500 mg tid, Valsartan 80 qd, Lipitor 20.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General - HEENT - pupils are equal,
round, react to light and accommodation. Extraocular muscles
were intact. Sclera are anicteric. Neck was supple without
lymphadenopathy. Heart is regular rate and rhythm with no
murmurs, rubs or gallops. Abdomen is soft, nontender and
nondistended.

LABORATORY:  PT is 26 and INR of 1.3. Sodium is 143, K is
4.3, chloride 104, bicarb 23, BUN 51, creatinine 2.7, glucose
311.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On postop Day 1, the patient was continued
on Levo/Flagyl and continued to be followed by the Renal
Team. In order to initiate dialysis, the patient had a
Permacath placed by Interventional Radiology on postop Day 4.
The patient was followed for her increasing sugars. The
patient was on insulin drip until postop Day 3. On postop Day
6, she began to tolerate a diet and had frequent dialysis on
Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday schedule. The patient's sugars
were well controlled on an insulin regimen. Physical Therapy
evaluated the patient on [**2112-6-10**] and deemed her suitable
for rehabilitation secondary to generalized weakness. The
patient had been in normal sinus rhythm 48 hours prior to
discharge on stable PO amiodarone regimen. She was changed to
Levo/Flagyl PO on [**2112-6-13**] and discharged to Rehabilitation
on [**6-14**] on postop Day 11, Levo/Flagyl Day 12.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Iatrogenic bowel perforation status
post attempted peritoneal dialysis catheter placement
laparoscopically converted to open procedure, status post
postop atrial fibrillation, acute renal disease with
hemodialysis status post Permacath placement.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient was discharged to
Rehabilitation and instructed to follow up with Transplant
Service at the next available visit. She was to call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 27019**] for an appointment.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  The patient was discharged on
medications of levofloxacin 250 mg po q48h, Coumadin 1 mg po
hs, Flagyl 500 mg po tid, Flagyl and Levo for two weeks,
Lopressor 50 mg po tid, amiodarone 400 mg po qd, insulin
