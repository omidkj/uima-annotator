Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname 10680**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a cardiac cath
which revealed severe three vessel disease. Prior to surgery he
needed extensive work-up which included blood work, urinalysis,
cxr, echo, pulmonary consult with PFT's and right arm ABG's.
During this time and throughout hospital course renal followed
patient along with him receiving hemodialysis. He was eventually
ready for surgery on hospital day seven and following receiving
consent he was brought to the operating room where he [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**]
a coronary artery bypass graft x 4. Please see operative report
for surgical details. He tolerated the procedure well and was
then transferred to the CSRU in stable condition for invasive
monitoring. Later on op day he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. His HIV medications
were restarted. He did require multiple blood transfusions
post-operatively. After several days in the CRSU he appeared
stable and was transferred to the telemetry floor. Chest tubes
and epicardial pacing wires were removed per protocol. Physical
therapy followed patient during entire post-op course for
strength and mobility. Antibiotics were started for a UTI. Beta
blockers were titrated for maximum BP and heart rate control.
Electrolytes were repleted. He continued to make good progress
with minimal complications. He appeared stable and doing well
with normal vs and stable labs. He was eventually discharged
home on POD #10 with VNA services and the appropriate follow-up
appointments.
