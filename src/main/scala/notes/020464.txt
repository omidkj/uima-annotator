Service:  Medical Intensive Care Unit

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Three day history of progressive dyspnea
and lower extremity edema.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69-year-old
male with a history of aortic valve replacement and atrial
fibrillation on Coumadin, recently diagnosed with cryptogenic
cirrhosis, pancytopenia, and splenomegaly, who presents with
a three day history of increasing fatigue, lower extremity
edema, and dyspnea.  The patient is status post a three week
hospitalization at [**Hospital6 1129**] following a
three month history of anorexia, weight loss, weakness, and
increasing abdominal girth.  The patient was found with
pancytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, with increasing liver
function tests.

The patient underwent an extensive workup at [**Hospital6 2121**] including right heart catheterization, bone
marrow aspirate, and biopsy, and transjugular liver biopsy
with the diagnosis of pancytopenia with myelodiplasia,
cryptogenic cirrhosis, splenomegaly, congestive heart
failure, and mitral stenosis.  A course of amiodarone (200 mg
[**Hospital1 **] from [**2177-6-11**] to [**2178-1-11**]) is the suspected
culprit for cirrhosis.  The patient was discharged on
prednisone and Procrit as well as his prior medications
including Lasix, Coumadin, Flomax, and thyroxine.

Since discharge from [**Hospital6 1129**] on [**5-23**], the patient reports progressive shortness of breath
with dyspnea at rest, orthopnea, increased malaise,
increasing abdominal distention, and increasing lower
extremity edema.  The patient reports compliance with his
medications, however, reports minimal oral intake with
confinement to his bed secondary to weakness.  The patient
denies fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, chest
pain, confusion, as well as spontaneous bleeding.

In the Emergency Department, the patient was found afebrile
with a heart rate of 85, atrial fibrillation, blood pressure
108/58, respiratory rate 20, with an oxygen saturation of 95%
on room air.  The patient's chest x-ray revealed a new large
right pleural effusion.  Patient's initial laboratories were
notable for an INR of 8.7.  The patient was admitted to the
Medicine [**Hospital1 **] for a planned thoracentesis with correction of
the INR.  However, on the floor, the patient became hypoxic
with an oxygen saturation of 90% on 2 liters nasal cannula,
tachycardic with a heart rate in the 120s, and acutely short
of breath.  The initial arterial blood gas was 7.45/28/78
with a lactate of 7.3.  A repeat chest x-ray with lateral
decubitus demonstrated progressive increasing pleural
effusion with complete whiteout.  Repeat laboratories
demonstrated a drop in hematocrit from 38.5 to 30.9, and
increased INR to 21.4.  The patient was transferred to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management.

[**2158**].
2. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (diet controlled).
3. Atrial fibrillation complicated by congestive heart

[**2178-5-14**].
10. Splenomegaly.
11. Hypothyroidism secondary to amiodarone toxicity.
12. Congestive heart failure status post right heart
catheterization with restrictive heart physiology on [**2178-5-11**].
13. Status post cholecystectomy ([**2155**]).

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a retired chief of Plastic
Surgery at [**Hospital1 69**].  The patient
is married with three grown children.  The patient reports
occasional alcohol, however, denies tobacco as well as
illicit drug use.

The patient reports progressive weakness and anorexia with
approximate 50 pound weight loss over several months.  The
patient also reports postural instability times several
months with several falls (denies head trauma, syncope, as
well as loss of consciousness).  The patient reports chronic
cough productive of yellow sputum.  Denies hemoptysis.  The
patient reports nocturia x2-3 without incontinence or
hesitancy.  The patient reports bilateral hand tremors.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON TRANSFER TO THE MEDICAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT:
Temperature 97.4, heart rate 92, sinus, blood pressure
114/52, respiratory rate 24, and oxygen saturation of 98% on
15 liters of facemask.  In general, the patient is a tired
appearing, thin male in mild distress.  HEENT examination:
Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils are equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation, no scleral icterus, dry
mucous membranes, clear oropharynx, no oral bleeding.  Neck
supple, with 8-9 cm jugular venous distention, midline
trachea, no lymphadenopathy with 2+ carotid pulses
bilaterally.  Pulmonary examination:  Decreased breath sounds
on the right approximately [**4-14**] of the way up with egophony
with dullness to percussion.  Left lung clear to
auscultation.  Cardiovascular examination:  Regular, rate,
and rhythm with a 3/6 systolic murmur at the left upper
sternal border, no S3, S4 appreciated.  Abdominal examination
is notable for hepatosplenomegaly, nontender, and
nondistended, with normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities:
Warm and well perfused with trace lower extremity edema
bilaterally to the knees, 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior
tibial pulses bilaterally.
