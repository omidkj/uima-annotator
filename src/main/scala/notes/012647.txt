Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation.
Cardiac Catherization with stent placement.
Swan-Ganz hemodynamic monitoring through the right internal
jugular.

History of Present Illness:
   This is an 87 year-old male with history of 3 vessel coronary
disease, congestive heart failure, aortic stenosis, diabetes,
end-stage renal disease not on dialysis who presents with ST
elevation infarction.  He was recently admitted with unstable
angina and was discharged 2 days prior to this presentation.  He
had been having intermittent chest pain with exertion that
resolved with rest for the past month.  The morning of
admission, he had [**8-13**] burning substernal chest pain with
intermittent radiation to the left chest.  He came into the
emergency department and was found to have ST elecations
inferiorly.  It was felt that he had collateral insufficiency
given inferior ST elevations in the setting of a known occluded
right coronary.  Given prior plans for medical management, he
received aspirin, sublinqual nitro x 3, Plavix 600 mg, heparin
srip, lopressor, morphine and ativan.  His chest pain resolved
in the emergency department, and he was transferedd to the CCU.
Upon arrival to the CCU, he complained of persistent burning
substernal chest pain, and he EKG had persistent ST elevations
inferiorly with ST elevations in V4 with right-sided leads.  He
became acutely hypoxic to the 80s on a non-rebreather.  A
bedside echocardiogram showed severely depressed left
ventricular function with preserved right ventricular function.
After discussions with his outpatient nephrologist, covering
cardiologist, and daughters, he was taken emergently to the
catherization lab for a diagnostic and potentially therapeutic
catherization despite the risk of needing dialysis after the [**Month/Year (2) **]
load.  He was emergently intubated.  He was started on pressors
for cardiogenic shock.  Catherization revealed severe stenosis
at the left main trifucation.  A stent was placed to the
proximal LAD.  He was transfered to the CCU for further
management.

Past Medical History:
1. Coronary artery disease status post an MI [**47**] years ago.  A
catherization in [**2115**] showed severe 3 vessel disease.  A
decision was made then not to pursue bypass surgery.
Persantine-MIBI on [**4-18**] showed fixed inferior and inferiolateral
perfusion defect.
2. Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 19% on
persantine-MIBI [**2124-4-18**].
3. Aortic Stenosis with a gradient of 41 mmHg in [**5-8**].
4. Diabetes that is diet controlled.
5. End stage renal disease not on dialysis.
6. Hypertension.
7. Hyperlipidemia.
8. Hypothyroidism.
9. Hiatal hernia with gastroesophageal reflux.
10. Status post ressection of the sigmoid colon and rectum for
colon cancer.
11. Prostate cancer with watchful waiting.

Social History:
He is widowed and lives alone.  He is independent at baseline.
He is a former smoker and he occasionally drinks alcohol.

Family History:
Non-contributory.

Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm, s1, s2, with III/VI harsh
systolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur heard thoughout.
Abdomen: Soft, mildly nondistended with decreased bowel sounds.
Extremities: Warm without edema.  Dopplerable dorsalis pedis on
the right and posterior tibial on the left.  Swan-ganz catheter
in placed at the right groin.  Balloon pump in placed at the
left groin.  Oozing at both groin sites.

EKG [**2124-4-21**]: Normal sinus rhythm with ST elevations in III and
aVF and ST depressions in I, aVL, V2-V4.  Right sided leads had
ST elevations in V4R.
.
.
Echocardiogram (limited views) [**2124-4-21**]: Severely depressed left
ventricular function (EF ~ 15-20%).  Preserved right ventricular
function.

Catherization [**2124-4-21**]: His right coronary was totally occluded.
The left main had an 80% tubular stenosis.  The LAD had a 90%
stenosis at the origin and a 70% stenosis at the mid-portion.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 87 year-old gentleman with known 3 vessel coronary
artery disease, congestive heart failure EF 25%, aortic stenosis
([**Location (un) 109**] 0.9 cm2), diabetes who presented with an inferior
ST-elevation myocardial infarction secondary to collateral
insufficiency.  He was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with
complaints of chest pain and found to have significant CAD based
on a Persantine MIBI test, however a cardiac catheterization
could not be performed given the severe acute on chronic renal
failure.  This particular hospitalizations was complicated by
multiple factors including cardiogenic shock, septic shock,
repeated episodes of aspiration PNA, and flash pulmonary edema.
After his last episode of hypoxic respiratory failure and
intubation/extubation, the pt was made DNR/DNI after long
discussions with the patient and his family.  Soon after he was
medically stabilized and transferred to out of the CCU.  However
he suffered another episode of respiratory distress during which
time he was made [**Hospital1 3225**] after discussion with the patient and the
HCP.  The details of the hospital course are summarized below.
.
.
CODE STATUS: Prior to admission, the pt was living independently
with intact ADL and IADLS.  However, this hospitalization for
STEMI was complicated by episodes of shock and hypoxic
respiratory distress requiring intubation/extubation after which
point the patient was made DNR/DNI.  He was stabilized medically
and called out of the ICU on [**2124-5-8**].  However he experienced
another episode of respiratory distress from pulmonary edema on
the evening of [**2124-5-10**].  The following day, a family meeting was
held with the patient and both the patient and the HCP agreed to
become [**Name (NI) 3225**].  He was subsequently transitioned off medical
therapy and instead started on a morphine drip through a
pre-existing PICC line for comfort measures.  In addition, the
pt was written for PRN nebulizers and promethazine.  If needed,
the pt should also receive a Scopolamine patch.

1. STEMI: His inferior infarction was attributed to collateral
insufficiency.  Initially, there was concern for right
