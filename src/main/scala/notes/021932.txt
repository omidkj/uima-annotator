None


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 82-year-old man with history of large cell
lymphoma treated 6 days ago with R-CHOP (finished five-day burst
of prednisone yesterday), who presented to the emergency room
with increasing weakness and fever. Patient developed symptoms
on the morning of admission, in the ED he was also endorsing
rigors and feeling systemically ill.

In the ED, initial vital signs were T 100.8, HR 85, BP 125/64,
RR 16, satting 97% on room air. Exam was notable for crackles at
right base and 3+ pitting edema (stable per daughter). Labs
notable for white count of 5.8 with 89% neutrophils and 0%
bands, hematocrit of 23.8 (down from recent baseline high 20s),
and platelet count of 40 (down from mid to high 200s at time of
discharge about three weeks ago). Electrolytes were normal, with
creatinine of 1.2 (at baseline) and BUN of 43. INR was 2.3
(patient is on coumadin) and lactate was 1.1. Liver enzymes were
within normal limits. Chest x-ray showed persistent left sided
masses and resolving infiltrate in the right lower lobe.
Urinalysis was negative. Blood and urine cultures were drawn,
and patient was given doses of vancomycin, Zosyn, and
levofloxacin in addition to 1 liter of intravenous saline prior
to admission. He was also given metoprolol 5 mg IV x3 followed
by 25 mg orally for AF with RVR to 150. Vitals at time of
transfer were BP 112/77, HR 102 (jumped to 140 with minimal
exertion), RR 24, satting 93% RA. Patient was admitted to ICU
for AF with RVR.

Of note, patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) **] for
weakness. During that admission, he was found to have a
multifocal legionella pneumonia for which he was treated
empirically with vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin. He was
ultimately treated with a 14-day course of levofloxacin when
cultures returned (finished [**12-14**]). Notably, he was
transiently hypotensive with pressor requirement at the
beginning of the hospital admission. The hospital course was
complicated by AF with RVR, and although patient was started on
amiodorone and digoxin initially, as he clinically improved it
was decided to stop these two medicines in favor of uptitrating
his beta-blocker. He was discharged on 50 mg of metoprolol
succinate, once daily.

Code status during his previous admission was confirmed as
DNR/DNI, and this was again confirmed this admission with the
patient and family.

ROS: Currently, patient endorses cough. He is without chest
pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, lightheadedness or
dizziness. 10-system ROS was otherwise negative.

Chest x-ray ([**2107-12-25**]):

Mass-like consolidation in the left lung, appearing similar to
multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to [**2107-6-18**]
concerning for malignancy/metastatic disease, less likely
pneumonia. Persistent right basilar opacity, slightly improved
though likely represents residual pneumonia versus scarring.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: In summary an 82-year-old man with history of large B-cell
lymphoma s/p 6 cycles of Rituxan, Gemzar, and Oxaliplatinum and
most recently R-CHOP, now presents with fevers and weakness,
admitted to the intensive care unit for AF with RVR and
neutropenia with fever. The source of the infection was later
felt to be a urinary tract infection.

# Atrial fibrillation: During his most recent admission, patient
had been treated transiently with amiodorone and digoxin,
although both of these medications were discontinued at time of
discharge. As his clinical status improved, he responded well to
beta-blockade. He continued to have AFIB with RVR, even on
escalating doses of metoprolol.  Also received acute dosing of
IV metorpolol as well as diltiazem.  Eventually placed on 50mg
metoprolol qid, with digoxin added on for rate control.  The
patient underwent a digoxin load prior to transfer out of the
ICU, and was then transitioned to 0.125 digoxin daily.  This
dose was decreased prior to discharge, given the patient's CKD
and history of digoxin effects. His warfarin was held during the
pancytopenia early in the admission, but was gradually
restarted, and will be followed as an outpatient. His internist
was notified to restart the [**Hospital3 **] following the
patient, and the VNA will draw his labs and send them to the
PCP's office.

# Fevers, weakness: presented with fevers.  Received one dose of
levofloxacin then empricially started on vancomycin and
cefepime.  Vancomycin was discontinued, but the patient was
continued on cefeipime while he was neutropenic.  Urine cultures
were positive for presumed E.Coli, and antibiotics were later
tapered based on the culture data.  No sputum or blood cultures
were positive. The patient was afebrile for 24 hours by time of
discharge.

# Hypoxia and oxygen requirement: Likely multifactorial, given
concern of pneumonia as well as multiple masses in left lung.
Thought there might have been a pulmonary edema componenet, but
the patient auto-diuresed as his rate was better controlled
during his ICU stay. The oxygen requirement and LE edema both
resolved prior to discharge.

# Large B-cell lymphoma: Patient underwent 6th cycle of Rituxan,
Gemzar, and Oxaliplatinum on [**11-10**]. He recently completed R-CHOP
therapy five days prior to admission. Oncology is following.

# Thombocytopenia/ anemia: Likely secondary to recent
chemotherapy. Received several transfusions for HCT<2
