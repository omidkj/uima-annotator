Chief Complaint:
transfer with PE

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
.
1. Intraarterial thrombectomy with thrombolysis
2. IVC filter placement


History of Present Illness:
48 year old F PMH obesity, HTN who developed left calf pain and
swelling for 2 days duration. Patient had foot surgery 3 weeks
prior. Today she began to develop shortness of breath and
pleuritic chest pain. She called her pcp her referred to [**Hospital1 **]. On presentation OSH VS 198/131 RR 22 SaO2 93% RA. Lab
work-up pertinent for Troponin 0.353, positive d-dimer. CTA
demonstrated large saddle pulmonary embolus. She was given 1.5 L
and 2 mog ativan prior to transfer. Consequently patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

On transport patient became hypotensive SBP 50 with symptomatic
dizziness, however she received ativan prior to transfer. On
arrival to our ED BP 70/40 which responded to SBP 130 with NS
(unknown amount). During her ED stay blood pressure ranged from
125-138/60-86, HR 121-135. She required 4 L O2 by NC. EKG
demonstrated right heart strain (S1Q3T3), mildly elevated
troponin 0.04 and BNP 238. Due to episode of hypotension and
evidence of right heart strain IR was consulted for possible
intra-arterial thrombolysis/embolectomy who felt she would
benefit. Vitals on transfer BP 128/60, HR 121, RR 20, O2 sat 98%
4L.

On arrival patient anxious, continues to have shortness of
breath with exertion only with pleuritic chest pain but appears
comfortable.

ECG [**2169-2-19**]  12:44:42 PM Sinus tachycardia. Low precordial lead
QRS voltage. Delayed R wave progression with late precordial QRS
transition. Low right precordial lead T wave amplitude. Findings
are non-specific. Since the previous tracing of [**2169-2-18**] sinus
tachycardia rate is faster.

LINE PLACEMENT - IMPRESSION: 1. Pulmonary angiogram and
successful chemical and mechanical thrombolysis. A total of 15
mg of TPA was injected (5 mg in the left pulmonary artery, 5 mg
in the main pulmonary artery and 5 mg in the right pulmonary
artery). Mechanical thrombectomy was performed with pigtail
catheter, angled glide catheter and a 0.0.35 soft-tip [**Last Name (un) 7648**]
wire. 2. Successful placement of a G2 retrievable IVC filter in
the infra-renal position. The filter can be removed anytime in
the future if clinically indicated once the risk of PE is
abated. 3. Successful placement of a 7 French x 16 cm double
lumen central venous catheter via right common femoral venous
access. The tip of the catheter is terminating in the right
common iliac vein and the line is ready for use.

Brief Hospital Course:
48 year old F PMH HTN, dyslipidemia recent left foot arthrodesis
who presented with acute SOB and chest pain found to have saddle
pulmonary embolism.
.
Pulmonary embolism: The patient presented from OSH with large
saddle PE on CTA with evidence of right heart strain on EKG
(S1Q3T3), supported by elevated troponin/BNP.  Patient had one
episode of hypotension during transportation and on initial
arrival.  Upon arrival in the ICU the patient was tachycardiac
and hypertensive with a 4L oxygen requirement.  LENI
demonstrated left popliteal DVT. Due to large clot burden,
episode of hypotension and evidence of right heart strain
patient underwent IR-guided pulmonary angiography with
mechanical and chemical (tPA) thrombolysis.  A G2 retrivable IVC
filter and temporary dual lumen central venous line were placed
via right femoral access.  The patient was subsequently
transitioned to lovenox and started on coumadin with resolution
of her tachycardia and oxygen requirement.  Her clot was thought
to be most likely provoked by her recent surgery and
immobilization, with her estrogen-based contraceptive (used for
endometriosis) also a risk factor.  She discontinued her
NuvaRing on day prior to discharge; she was counseled on
alternative contraception and indicated that her husband is s/p
vasectomy.  Of note the patient has had a previous partial
hypercoagulability workup for history of cotton-wool spots.  On
discharge the patient was able to ambulate with 2 crutches
without desaturating on RA.
.
The patient was on warfarin 5 mg daily beginning the afternoon
of [**2-18**].
The patient had the following INRs:
[**2-18**] 1.1 (am prior to warfarin initiation)
[**2-19**] 1.0
[**2-20**] 1.0
[**2-21**] 1.2

day following discharge for coagulation monito
