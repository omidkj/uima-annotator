Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
1) Rectal cancer:
- late [**2139**]: 6 months of intermittent rectal bleeding, rectal
pressure and a sensation of incomplete emptying.
- [**2141-1-26**]: colonoscopy revealed a polyp in her sigmoid colon and
a 2.5 cm distal rectal mass arising from the anal verge in the
posterior rectum with a large area of induration.
- [**2141-1-31**]: CT torso revealed an exophytic rectal mass measuring
4.8 x 3.8 cm, bulging posteriorly into the presacral space and
anteriorly towards the uterus. There were enlarged lymph nodes
in the perirectal fat adjacent to the mass, a 9-mm enhancing
lymph node in the left pelvic sidewall, and enhancing lymph
nodes in the right external iliac region. There was also a 7-mm
hypodensity in the caudate lobe of the liver. Rectal ultrasound
on [**2141-1-31**] and rectal MRI on [**2141-2-7**] were compatible with T3
disease. There were at least four abnormal perirectal lymph
nodes seen on MRI, in addition to multiple bilateral enlarged
pelvic sidewall lymph nodes, concerning for extensive disease.
- [**2141-2-20**]: began chemoradiation
- [**2141-3-10**]: 5-FU was discontinued due to mucositis, neutropenia,
and abdominal cramping
- [**2141-3-13**]: 5-FU was restarted at a reduced dose
- [**2141-3-22**]: 5-FU was again stopped due to mucositis, perirectal
skin changes, diarrhea, and electrolyte abnormalities.
- [**Date range (3) 70844**]: Radiation was also held
- [**2141-3-27**]: 5-FU was restarted at a further reduced dose
- [**2141-3-31**]: completed radiation
- [**2141-4-3**]: completed chemotherapy
- [**Date range (3) 70845**]: hospitalized for bowel rest and the
initiation of TPN due to presumed radiation enteritis.
- [**2141-5-31**]: found to be HIV positive and began on HAART
- [**Date range (1) 70846**]: required hospitalization for an SBO, underwent
laparotomy, ileocecectomy, end-ileostomy, and placement of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] tube on [**2141-6-16**]. Pathology from this surgery revealed
severe radiation-induced acute ischemic enteritis. She recovered
from this surgery, but continued to require TPN.
- [**7-/2141**]: Once her CD4 count had recovered, she underwent
laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, ileal resection,
proctosigmoidectomy, colonic jejunal pouch to near-anal
anastomosis with EEA, takedown splenic flexure, resection of
ileostomy and creation of new end-ileostomy. Pathology from the
surgical specimen revealed no residual carcinoma and all 14
lymph nodes sampled were free of disease.
- [**9-/2141**], [**10/2141**]: Subsequent imaging of the abdomen & pelvis
showed no evidence of recurrence.
- [**2142-2-14**]: CT abdomen showed "hyperdense thickening in the lumen
near the anastomatic site, new since the earlier study. Local
recurrence cannot be excluded, although possibly the appearance
is associated with endoluminal debris."

OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY:
2) HIV CD4 count CD4 263 in [**1-26**]
3) Short gut syndrome secondary to bowel surgery for CA.
4) Obstructive renal failure from radiation fibrosis, in the
past necessitating b/l nephrostomy tubes which have required
multiple revisions.
5) Lower extremity neuropathy, likely secondary to radiation
fibrosis, uses a wheelchair since 4/[**2141**].
6) Pancreatic insufficiency.
7) Anemia.
8) Chronic pain.
9) DVT in LE X2: requires lifelong coumadin, most recent [**4-24**].

Social History:
Lives in [**Location 17566**] with her husband and several children. No
tobacco or EtOH use. Used to be account manager, now on
long-term disability. Has [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 269**] [**Location (un) 5871**], with skilled nursing 1h X
3/week + aid 1h X2/week. She is wheelchair bound.

colitis.

CT A/P/Thigh [**2144-7-14**]: 1. Focal fluid collection posterior to the
right ischium is new since the  prior exam measuring 8.6 x 3.7
cm. Additionally there is skin thickening, soft tissue
reticulation involving the right hemipelvis and the right thigh
with no evidence of necrotizing fascitis. 2. Unchanged air-fluid
level within the bladder likely secondary to
nephrostomy tubes, howeverconhowever infection with gas-forming
organisms
cannot be excluded in the correct clinical setting.  3.
Extensive radiation changes within the pelvis including findings
compatible with radiation cystitis, possible radiation colonic
stricture and enteritis. 4. Diffuse dilation of the small bowel,
without a definite transition point, which is chronic, and
essentially unchanged from [**2144-2-16**]. 5. Bilateral
nephrostomy tubes in place without hydronephroureter. 6.
Collapsed gallbladder, containing a small punctate gallstone.
Gas identified within the renal collecting systems bilaterally,
possibly introduced from the patient's nephrostomy tubes
unchanged from the prior exam. Stable left mid-ureter 4 mm
stone. 7. Similar appearance of sacral decubitus ulcer, with
erosive changes at the coccyx concerning for osteomyelitis. 8.
Hepatic steatosis.

CT Thigh [**2144-7-19**]: 1.  No significant change in the appearance of
the previously packed and drained right gluteal abscess.  No new
drainable collections. 2.  New locules of air in the right groin
are of unclear significance and may be due to a prior injection
site or a new region of infection.  There is no organized fluid
collection adjacent to the air to suggest a new abscess. 3.
Stable skin thickening and significant subcutaneous edema in the
thighs, worse on the right than the left. 4.  Stable sacral
decubitus ulcer with probable osteomyelitis of the coccyx.

CTAP [**2144-7-23**]: IMPRESSION: 1.  New moderate-to-large left
perinephric and left renal subcapsular hematoma. Small amount of
complex upper abdominal ascites suggestive of intraperitoneal
extension of hemorrhage. 2.  Bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy
tubes in place.  A small amount of air
in the kidneys relate to the recent tube change. 3.  Moderate
distension of the stomach and proximal small bowel loops, may
relate to ileus or partial small bowel obstruction, evaluation
of which is limited due to lack of oral contrast. 4.  Interval
drainage of a previously seen right gluteal abscess with small
amount of residual air and fat stranding in this region.  A
large coc
