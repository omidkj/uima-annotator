Brief Hospital Course:
In the ED, initial vs were: 98.3 88 132/84 20 100.  His g-tube
replaced and in place by gastrograffin study. On exam, there was
cellulitis around g-tube.   His tmx in the ED was 100.1 and his
HR ranged from 95-101.  His sats were good on 2L NC but he was
tachypenic to the high 30s.  Mildy wheezing on exam with
decreased breath sounds on the left.  The resident tried to do
an ABG, but he had a tremor on the right and contractures on the
left so he was unable to do so.  He was given nebs and his
tachypnea improved to the mid 20s, he was always orientated.
However, when not speaking his RR was 25 and when speaking it
went up to 35.  CXR was done which showed baseline
atelectasis/low lung volume on the left with possible LLL
pneumonia.  He was given Vanco/Levo and Meropenem. This was
later changed to Vancomycin and Meropenem and pt was d/c on a 10
day course (to finish out 14days of treatment) of Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]
through PICC line.
.
# Tachypnea: Patient with low grade fever, increased cough, more
shortness of breath than baseline and possible worsening of CXR
on the left which is consistent with pneumonia.  However,
patient also with other reason to have low grade fever
(cellulitis), and shortness of breath (restrictive lung disease
and improvement with nebs), chronic aspiration.  On physical
exam his wheezing was found to be mostly upper airway so we
treated him for pneumonia (VAP and pseudomonas) with
Vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]/Cipro.  His sputum culture was difficult to obtain
and grew mixed respiratory flora.  He was continued on nebs and
improved back to baseline within several hours.  Cipro was
stopped the next morning as it was felt unlikely that the
patient had pneumonia given his rapid improvement.
.
# Cellulitis at G-tube site:  Patient started on Vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for
cellulitis. The area of erythema improved.  Culture from the
site had multiple organisms on gram stain. G tube was replaced
and permanent tube placed on [**4-6**].
.
# Positive U/A: Patient's urine was positive in the ED.  He
denied urinary symptoms.  He has a chronic foley catheter which
was changed out when he got to the ICU.  His urine culture grew
2 species of pseudomonas.  He was on meropenem for his possible
pneumonia and cellulitis which should cover his pseudomonas.
While awaiting sensitivities a second antibiotics was not
added.Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] will be continued which would cover these
organisms from chronic foley placement.
.
# COPD:
-continued standing nebs with albuterol and ipratropium
.
# Chronic aspiration: Aspiration precautions with G-tube
feeding.
.
# Parkinson's disease: Continued home doses of Sinemet and
hyoscyamine.
.
# AFib: Patient in NSR on telemetry.  He was continued on home
dose of amiodarone.  Of note, patient not on anticoagulation
given h/o GI bleed.

# Hyperlipidemia: Patient continued on statin and ASA .
.
# GERD: Patient started on Lansoprazole while in hospital (don't
have omeprazole liquid on formulary).
.
# H/o DVTs: Patient denies any leg pain, no assymetry on exam.
Was on heparin SQ for PPX while in the hospital
