Service:  INT MED
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient is a 56-year-old man with a
past medical history significant for chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, obesity and type II diabetes mellitus as
well as a 160 pack year history of tobacco use, whose chief
complaint on presentation was shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient presented to the
Emergency Department at [**Hospital1 69**]
on [**2112-4-20**] with shortness of breath and a cough.  He had
been seen in the Emergency Department on [**2112-4-17**] for a cough
and shortness of breath and was treated with levofloxacin for
presumed pneumonia and a prednisone taper for presumed
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare.
In the Emergency Department on [**2112-4-20**], the patient was
given Atrovent nebulizers, oxygen, intravenous Solu-Medrol
and levofloxacin and a chest x-ray was performed.  During his
treatment, he was unable to keep his mask on and he was given
a 100% nonrebreather mask.  During this treatment, he became
somnolent.  He was then put on BiPAP at 50% oxygen but
continued to have labored respirations.  He was intubated and
taken to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.

The patient was weaned off the ventilator within 36 hours
after his admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  He
was treated with intravenous Solu-Medrol, which was later
changed to p.o. prednisone, and with levofloxacin for
pneumonia and a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare
as well as a likely hypercarbic respiratory arrest on his
admission to the Emergency Department.

On [**2112-4-23**], the patient was admitted to the seventh floor
of the [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**] Building to the [**Hospital **] medical team.  He
said that his shortness of breath was much improved and
denied chest pain, palpitations, nausea, vomiting or
abdominal pain.  He did admit to loose bowel movements times
two without bright red blood per rectum or melena.  He was
then eating well and was hungry, but continued to have a
cough productive of yellow sputum.

history, starting at the age of 14.  He had a past history of
heavy alcohol use, including drinking up to five beers a day.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient had a daughter with cystic
fibrosis.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION TO MEDICINE FLOOR:  The
patient had a temperature of 98.4??????F, a heart rate of 94, a
respiratory rate of 26, a blood pressure of 136/80 and an
oxygen saturation of 88% on two liters of oxygen.  He was
sitting in a chair with nasal cannula in place, watching
television and in no apparent distress.  He was speaking in
full sentences.  On head, eyes, ears, nose and throat
examination, the sclerae were injected but without icterus.
There was positive conjunctival injection.  The oropharynx
was dry and without lesions.  The neck was supple without
lymphadenopathy.

The lungs had scattered faint wheezes bilaterally with no
rhonchi and good air movement.  On cardiovascular
examination, S1 and S2 were auscultated; there was a regular
rate and rhythm.  The abdomen had positive bowel sounds.  The
abdomen was soft, obese, nontender and nondistended with no
organomegaly and no masses palpated.  The extremities had
trace edema bilaterally below the knees with no calf
tenderness bilaterally.

LABORATORY ON ADMISSION TO MEDICINE FLOOR ON [**2112-4-23**]:  The
patient had a white blood cell count of 7,500 with a
hematocrit of 52 and platelet count of 119,000.  There was a
sodium of 141, potassium of 4.5, chloride of 99, bicarbonate
of 31, BUN of 25, creatinine of 0.6 and glucose of 244.
Albumin was 3.3.  An arterial blood gases on [**2112-4-23**]
revealed a pH of 7.33, a pCO2 of 56 and a pO2 of 63.  Total
calculated carbon dioxide was 35.

Microbiology revealed the following:  The [**2112-4-20**] sputum
sample had greater than 25 polymorphonuclear neutrophils and
fewer than 10 epithelial cells.  There were gram positive
cocci in cluster and pairs.  The sputum culture showed no
growth.  Blood cultures from [**2112-4-20**] were pending at the
time of admission.

RADIOLOGY:  A chest x-ray from [**2112-4-17**] showed bilateral
lower lobe pneumonia.  A chest x-ray from [**2112-4-20**] showed
left heart failure with some slight improvement in comparison
to a chest x-ray from [**2112-4-17**].  A chest x-ray from [**2112-4-21**]
showed a probably mild congestive heart failure superimposed
on a bibasilar lower lobe pneumonia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In summary, the patient is a 56-year-old
man with a past medical history significant for chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, obesity and noninsulin
dependent diabetes mellitus as well as a long history of
extensive tobacco use, who presented with a chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation and bilateral
lower lobe pneumonia leading to a hypercarbic respiratory
arrest.  He was intubated in the Emergency Department and
sent to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  The patient was
then deemed stable enough for discharge to the Medical
Service on the floor.

1.  PULMONARY:
    A. Pneumonia:  During his hospital stay on the Medicine
floor, the patient continued to receive levofloxacin 500 mg
p.o. q.d. as well as oxygen via nasal cannula to keep his
oxygen saturation greater than 92%.  By the third day on the
floor, [**2112-4-26**], his cough, while present, was no longer
productive of yellow sputum.  His rales had also disappeared
by [**2112-4-26**].
    B. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:  While on the
floor, the patient continued to receive Atrovent nebulizers
every four hours as well as Flonase and Ocean spray p.r.n.
He also continued to receive prednisone 60 mg p.o. q.d.  By
[**2112-4-26**], the patient said that he felt that he was
breathing at his baseline.  He denied extensive shortness of
breath on ambulation.  Although he was engaged in pursed lips
breathing and tripod breathing, he declared that he was in no
respiratory distress at all.
    C. Obstructive sleep apnea:  Although the patient was
prescribed BiPAP for oxygenation during sleep at night, he
did not enjoy the mask and refused to use it while sleeping.
His oxygen saturation at the night frequently dipped to at
least 75%.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Although his risk factors were numerous,
including obesity, diabetes mellitus, a long history of
tobacco use and a question of hypertension, the patient had
no cardiovascular complaints.  He had significant pitting
pedal edema bilaterally.  During his stay on the Medicine floor,
he continued to receive enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
and Norvasc 5 mg p.o. q.d.

3.  ENDOCRINE:  During the patient's stay with the Medical
Service, the patient continued to receive fingersticks q.i.d.
with the application of an insulin sliding scale.  His
diabetes was controlled at home through diet and did not
require insulin or other medications.

4.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient complained of two loose
bowel movements during the first day of his stay on the
Medicine floor.  Orders were sent to check for Clostridium
difficile toxin, however by [**2112-4-26**] his diarrhea had
resolved and he did not report any further gastrointestinal
complaints.  During his stay on the floor, the patient
received Prilos
