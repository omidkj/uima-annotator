Chief Complaint:
erythematous eyes, dysuria

Flexible Sigmoidoscopy


History of Present Illness:
36-year-old man with plasma cell leukemia, d+119 after ablative
(flu/cy/TBI) cord SCT, complicated by skin and gut GVHD, now on
velcade (C1D32) for persistent plasma cell dyscrasia in his bone
marrow, presents with erythematous eyes and dysuria. Three days
ago he started experiencing irritation in his eyes
bilaterally. They felt dry and itchy. No visual changes, blurry
vision or double vision. He reports some clear discharge. Two
days ago he also develop severe dysuria without any hematuria,
with the pain worst at the beginning and end of urination. No
abdominal, back pain, nausea, or vomiting. No fever. No penile
lesion or discharge. scharge.

cyclosporine eye drops and levofloxacin. His urinalysis and
urine culture came back negative. GC still pending. He
re-presented to clinic on [**2161-4-23**] with persistent symptoms and
was admitted.

use. He has 2 children.

Mother and father are both alive and well. Mother's family has
history of DM, HTN, and CAD. He doesn't know much about his

IMAGING:
GI Biopsies: Colonic mucosa with focal prominent apoptosis and
focal cryptitis, crypt regenerative and degenerative changes,
consistent with graft versus host disease (grade [**2-6**]) in the
appropriate clinical setting.  No definite viral inclusion seen.
 HSV and CMV immunostains are negative.

[**4-29**] CT Abdomen/Pelvis: IMPRESSION: Persistent colonic wall
thickening along the ascending and transverse portions, probably
more so than distally, consistent with an inflammatory or
infectious causes of colitis including potentially graft versus
host disease.

[**5-7**] ECHO: The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. There
is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetations seen. Mildly dilated and
hypokinetic left ventricle. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild
pulmonary hypertension.

[**5-4**] CHEST CT:
IMPRESSION: Multifocal bronchopneumonia, most severe in the
right upper lobe. Though this is most likely bacterial in
etiology, the nodular configuration of some of the opacities
also raises the possibility of fungal organisms, especially if
the patient is neutropenic.

[**5-16**] CHEST CT: IMPRESSION: Resolving multifocal pneumonia with
most marked improvement of the right upper lobe consolidation.
However, area of persistent opacification within the right upper
lobe now demonstrates cavitations with no clear fluid
collection. Differential considerations include bacterial or
fungal infection.

[**5-19**] ECHO:The left atrium is normal in size. Color Doppler study
suggests possible small interatrial shunt consistent with
stretched patent foramen ovale or small atrial septal defect.
(last beat of clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]). Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
