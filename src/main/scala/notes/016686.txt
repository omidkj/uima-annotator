Brief Hospital Course:
In brief, the patient is a 38 year old man with DM1 complicated
by autonomic instability, gastroparesis, ESRD on HD, CAD s/p MI,
and multiple line infections pw/ recurrent n/v abd pain and
hypertensive urgency.

# Nausea/Vomiting - related to known gastroparesis. Resolved
with ativan/reglan/compazine/dilaudid.

# Hypertension - likely combination of autonomic instability in
setting of needing dialysis and poor medication tolerance
secondary to nausea.  He had no evidence of acute end-organ
damage.  He was started on a nitro gtt that was weaned off
within 24 hours.  His home clonidine patch, PO clonidine, and
lisinopril were restarted.  his labetolol was held at the time
of discharge because his blood pressures were well controlled.

# ESRD - has access via HD line. At the time of admission he had
mild pulm edema with hypoxia.  He had HD x 2 during this
admission.

# CAD s/p MI - no acute changes on EKG and no clear chest pain.
He was continued on aspirin/statin/[**Month/Year (2) 4532**]

insulin.
