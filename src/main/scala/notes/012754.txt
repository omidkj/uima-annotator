Date of Birth:   [**2059-5-7**]     Sex:  F

Service:  MEDICINE [**Location (un) 259**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 49-year-old
female with a history of multiple myeloma diagnosed in
[**2107-12-9**], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and
asthma, who presents with increasing shortness of breath and
wheezing.  On [**8-26**], the patient reported having upper
respiratory infection symptoms of cough with clear sputum
production and mild shortness of breath.  She completed her
chemotherapy on that day, and was given prednisone 30 mg po
bid for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation
symptoms.  The patient's shortness of breath developed
through the weekend with progressive wheezing despite
increasing use of albuterol nebulizers.  The patient's son
brought her to [**Hospital1 69**] on the
morning of admission for progressing dyspnea.

The patient denied fevers, sore throat, nausea, vomiting.
Patient reported mild diarrhea which is typical with her
chemotherapy.  Denied dysuria.  The patient did have chills
and night sweats, which the patient also has previously
experienced with her chemotherapy.  In the Emergency Room,
the patient received albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers, and
Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Thirty year tobacco history, smoking 1.5
packs per day, quit in [**2107-12-9**], occasional alcohol
use.  Works as a home health aide.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical exam, patient had a
temperature of 98.3, blood pressure 154/96, heart rate 102,
respiratory rate of 40, sating 97% on 2 liters.  In general,
this is an ill appearing female breathing with accessory
muscles on nasal cannula lying upright in bed.  HEENT:
Nonicteric.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light
and accommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Mucous
membranes were moist.  Lungs:  Diffuse expiratory wheezes
bilaterally with bronchial hyperactivity, prolonged
expiratory phase, using accessory muscles.  Cardiac:
Tachycardic, normal sinus rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or
gallops.  Abdomen:  Good bowel sounds, nontender, and
nondistended.  Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Neurologic:  Cranial nerves II through XII intact.  Upper and
lower extremities 5/5 strength.  Sensory intact.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Patient's white cell count was
23.5, hematocrit of 32.2, INR of 2.0.  Sodium 133, potassium
5.2, chloride 102, bicarb 24, BUN 15, creatinine 0.6.

Chest x-ray was negative for any signs of pneumonia or
infiltrate.

An echocardiogram done in [**2108-4-7**] revealed an ejection
fraction greater than 55%, but mild RV dilatation.

CT angiogram on [**2108-7-27**] was negative for pulmonary
embolus.  However, this study did reveal significant
emphysema.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma/acute
reactive airway disease:  By history, this seemed like an
asthmatic exacerbation with a upper respiratory infection
trigger with diffuse wheezing, normal bicarb and the patient
was responsive to a beta-2 agonist.  Patient was admitted to
the MICU requiring albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers q2h.
The patient remained in the MICU overnight with improvement
and was able to space to nebulizers q4h.

On [**2108-8-3**], the patient was transferred to the floor,
where she was maintained on albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers
q4h.  The patient was monitored and had good oxygen
saturations, but required 2 liters nasal cannula at that
time.  With her improving examination on [**2108-7-27**], the
patient was switched to po steroids, prednisone 60 mg po q
day.  The patient was continued on the nebulizers and on the
evening of [**2108-8-6**], she was switched from nebulizer to
inhaled albuterol treatments.  The patient had maintained a
good response to this, and on the day of discharge, her
examination was significantly improved.  Her lungs were clear
to auscultation bilaterally, and her oxygen saturations were
92-98% on room air.

2. History of pulmonary embolus in the setting of decreased
oxygen saturations and shortness of breath in a patient with
a history of pulmonary embolus.  This was considered.  The
patient was kept on subQ Heparin and she was largely immobile
due to frequent nebulizer use at the beginning of her course.
She was given a CT angiogram on [**2108-7-27**].  This was
negative for any pulmonary embolus.

3. Oncology:  Patient with a history of multiple myeloma.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6944**] followed the patient while in-house.  She will
follow up with him as an outpatient.  The patient was covered
for bone pain with oxycodone.  The patient required
infrequent doses of oxycodone for her bone pain management.

4. Hyponatremia:  Patient has documented hyponatremia at many
admissions of unknown etiology.  The patient had a sodium
about 131-133 while in-house, which was normal for this
patient, and this was monitored and stable throughout this
hospital course.

5. Infectious Disease:  The patient had an increased white
blood cell count.  This was secondary to chemotherapy and
G/CSF treatment prior to admission.  Given the setting of
steroid use in this patient, also increasing white blood cell
count, blood cultures were sent for Aspergillus infection,
and these were all negative.  Patient's chest x-ray was
clear.  No evidence of pneumonia.

6. Hypertension:  While in-house, the patient had an elevated
blood pressure which seemed to be at baseline for this
patient.  Blood pressures ranged from 130-168/84-102.
Patient was not started on any new antihypertensive
medications as she is followed closely as an outpatient, and
will seek further care regarding this as an outpatient.

7. Anxiety:  The patient was admitted on Risperdal prn.  The
patient did not require any of this medication while
in-house.

After starting high-dose steroids, the patient experienced
some thrush in the back of her throat.  She had been given
nystatin swish and swallow and also Mycelex Troches.
However, the thrush continued, and the patient complained of
difficulty swallowing and discomfort with food in the back of
her throat.  The patient was started on oral fluconazole with
relief of all of these symptoms.  The patient reports that
this is the third time that she has been treated for presumed
candidal esophagitis with relief by fluconazole.
