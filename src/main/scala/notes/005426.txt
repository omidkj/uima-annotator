History of Present Illness:
(per patient's granddaughter)
83 y.o. demented female, nonverbal at baseline who presents from
home after being noted to acutely "shake" and become "weak".
Patient has had a cough for several weeks and is able to produce
sputum, but unable to expectorate it. She has reportedly had
sick contacts with family members in the house, with what sounds
like URI symptoms. Acutely this AM, patient was noted to have
"shakes" and was "weak", specifically unable to open her eyes
and at baseline, patient is able to open her eyes and respond to
voice. EMS was called where temp was found to be 100.6. Patient
was then taken to the ER for further evaluation. ROS remarkable
for no known fevers or rigors prior to today's presentation and
as can best be determined, no dysuria, hematuria, diarrhea,
abdominal pain, chest pain, SOB.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, vitals were: T - 100.6, HR - 53, BP - 139/76,
RR - 22, O2 - 86% on RA, 92% on 5 L. CXR showed a possible PNA
and lactate was elevated to 3.9. Patient received a total of 5 L
of NS for elevated lactate and transient hypotension. She was
given Ceftriaxone and Levofloxacin and sent to the ICU for
further management.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Pneumococcal pneumonia
The patient was empirically started on ceftriaxone and
levofloxacin in the ED. Her lactate returned at 3.9, and she
received nearly 5L of IV fluids in the emergency room
concordantly. She was transferred to the MICU, but never
required intubation. In the MICU, antibiotics were changed to
levofloxacin and flagyl. She remained hemodynamically stable and
was transferred to the medical floor. On the floor, antibiotics
were narrowed further to levofloxacin. Sputum cultures
ultimately came back with penicillin-sensitive pneumococcus. She
showed a good clinical response with resolution of her fever and
significant decrease in her leukocytosis. She was breathing more
comfortably and maintain oxygen saturations in the high 90's on
room air at discharge. The patient will complete the remainder
of her 10 day course of renally-dosed levofloxacin at home. This
more extended duration of treatment chosen provide coverage for
possible coagulase negative staphylococcus foley
catheter-associated UTI. Blood cultures remained no growth at
discharge but should be followed up by her outpatient
physicians.

2. Anemia
Patient's hematocrit of 40 at admission likely reflected
hemoconcentration. By discharge her hematocrit had returned to
her baseline of mid 30's. Basic anemnia workup showed normal B12
and folate with iron studies suggestive of anemia of chronic
disease. Her hematocrit was stable at discharge.

3. Dementia
The patient's mental status appeared to clear with treatment of
her pneumonia. At discharge she was at her reported baseline of
keeping her eyes open but remaining nonverbal. She was
discharged on her home namenda and razadyne.
