History of Present Illness:
74 yo M with history of BPH, HTN, s/p recent cervical
laminectomy fusion [**2176-8-24**] for cervical stenosis who presented
to the ED from rehabilitation facility when he was noted to be
febrile to 102.2, tachycardic and diaphoretic on routine vital
check.
.
The patient was discharged from orthopedic service to rehab on
[**2176-8-28**]. He was discharged in cervical collar and on
Ciprofloxacin for treatment of UTI. Per family, the patient was
feeling well until 3 days prior to admission, when he complained
of trouble sleeping at night. The next day he started feeling
lightheaded. He has been feeling weak and was complaining of SOB

adequate pain relief despite Percocet standing q6 hrs and prn q
4hrs. Per family, the patient's upper extremity weakness
initially improved following the surgery, but lately he has not
been able to lift his arms off the bed to wave.
.
In the ED, VS T 98.7 (then spiked to 101.6), HR 78, BP 160/96,
97% RA. CXR showed RLL and RML opacities interpreted as PNA vs.
atelectasis. The pateint received Metronidazole 500mg IV,
Levofloxacin 500mg IV, Acetaminophen (Liquid) 650mg, Morphine
2mg IV, Lorazepam 2mg IV, Metoprolol 5mg IV x 2, Vancomycin 1000

morphine and Ativan, he was noted to be lethargic. ABG was
checked and was 7.33/85/100 on 2L NC (previous ABG 7.41/pCO2
39/pO2 49 in [**2176-1-31**]). He was placed on BiPAP 15/5 FiO2 0.5
in the ED for hypercapnea. Narcan was not given.
.
While in the ED, the patient was also evaluated by orthopedics.
The wound was examined and cleared. Orthopedics recommended C
spine films. Currently, he denies any chest pain and is asking
for a sleep medication.


Past Medical History:

3. BPH
4. HTN


Social History:
No tobacco, no ETOH. For approximately a month prior to his
surgery [**2176-8-24**], he was bed bound. Prior to that, he was getting

[**2176-9-3**]: MRI c-spine: Postsurgical changes of C3-C5
decompressive laminectomies without evidence for recurrent
spinal stenosis, abnormal fluid collection or pathological
enhancement. However, assessment of hemorrhage is limited.
.
[**2176-9-16**]: EMG Abnormal study. The electrophysiologic findings
are most consistent with a generalized, severe, chronic and
ongoing disorder of motor neurons or their axons, affecting the
cervical, lumbar, and thoracic regions; however, severe, chronic
and ongoing cervical, thoracic, and lumbosacral
polyradiculopathies could also give rise to these
electrophysiologic findings. There is no evidence for a
generalized polyneuropathy, for a generalized myopathy, or for a
pre- or post-synaptic disorder of neuromuscular transmission.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Hypercapnic respiratory failure: This was felt to be a
combination of neuromuscular failure c-spine disease and ALS. He
completed a course of antibiotics (Vancomycin and Zosyn) for
pneumonia. s/p trach and PEG, stable on ventilatory settings.
Vent settings at discharge: AC Vt 450, 0.4 FiO2, RR 10 PEEP 5.
He was discharged to [**Hospital1 **] Rehab and will further
work on means to regain some of his voice while at rehab.
.
# ALS: recent diagnosis during this admission, He was started on
Rilutek per neuro recs.
.
# Labile BP: The patient's BP was initially very difficult to
manage, ranging from 60s/30s to SBP 200s. He was originally
treated with IVFs and pressors. The patient was able to mentate
with sBP in the 60s and BP improved upon awakening and with
decreased sedation. The patient's BP has been stable on
stimulation and midodrine. On the day of discharge, BP ranged
from 70-150; however, patient asymptomatic.
.
# Pain: Adequate control with lidocaine patch, fentanyl patch,
gabapentin. PRN Morphine and PRN Ibuprofen. Gabapentin dose at
discharge increased to 1200 TID.
.
# S/p cervical laminectomy. Patient with pain and weakness. Was
originally wearing a hard cervical collar at all times, and
changed to [**Location (un) 2848**] J collar which should be worn when out off
bed/changing position. Per recs, may be taken off while lying in
bed. Continue pain medications as needed.
.
# Fever. The patient was originally febrile with CXR showing RML
and RLL infiltrate vs atelectasis. He was originally started on
antibiotics and found to have an eosinophilia which was
attributed to zosyn. All cultures including BAL were negative
(except for yeast from likley colonization). Antibiotics were
eventually discontinued and the patient remained afebrile.
.
# PPX. Heparin SQ and PPI while NPO.
.
# FEN. s/p PEG, continue tube feeds.
# Code. Full.
.
# Access. PIV
.
# Communication. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 22924**] (son/HCP) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 27951**]; [**Name (NI) **]
[**Name (NI) 22924**] (granddaughter) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 27952**]
.
# OUTSTANDING ISSUES at DISCHARGE:
1. Per orthopedics, he will need repeat films of C-spine (AP and
lat) once he is at rehab.
2. As he is transferring care to [**Hospital1 336**], he will need neurology
follow-up for his ALS.
