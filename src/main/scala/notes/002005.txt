Studies:
[**2146-2-9**] CXR - CONCLUSION: Multiple vascular stents, unchanged
since the prior examination. No acute cardiopulmonary process.

[**2146-2-10**] CT abdomen, pelvis - IMPRESSION:
1. Peripancreatic fluid adjacent to the pancreatic tail and in
the
right anterior pararenal space, consistent with tail
pancreatitis. Recommend correlation with amylase.
2. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is similar to [**2142-10-22**]
and suggests chronic right phrenic nerve paralysis.
3. Resolving discitis/osteomyelitis since [**2145-9-23**].
4. No evidence of abdominal abscess or small-bowel obstruction.
5. Lower lobe atelectasis.

[**2146-2-11**] TTE:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. There
is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2145-11-8**],
no change.
IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetations or significant valve disease
seen.



Brief Hospital Course:
47F with Gardners Syndrome, short [**Year (4 digits) **], and tunneled line,
presented with bacteremia and likely line infection.

1. Klebsiella sepsis with hypotension: 7/8 bottles from OSH
positive for Klebsiella and 1/2 blood cultures positive here.
Previously has had Klebsiella bacteremia felt to be line
related.  Patient intially required levophed for blood pressure
support which was weaned off after the tunnelled line was
changed out in the OR under anesthesia on [**2-11**].  Of note, the
patient normally has systolic blood pressures in the 80s.
Initial lactate of 3.5, down to 0.8 with 4+ liters of IVF.  No
evidence for intra-abdominal abscess or other source of
infection on CT scan.  TTE on [**2-11**] neg for vegetations, so less
likely endocarditis.  Patient was initially started on meropenem
and daptomycin (had been on linezolid for coag neg Staph
bacteremia) pending blood culture results and daptomycin was
dropped when cultures were positive for Klebsiella.  She
finished her course of treatment for the Staph bacteremia.
Meropenem was changed to ceftriaxone on [**2-12**] per ID recs.  ID
recommends a 2 week course of ceftriaxone with Day 1 = [**2-11**].
The patient has had a prior history of a questionable lesion on
her SVC ([**11-1**] ECHO).  Cardiology declined TEE at the time of
the line change out feeling that lesion likely not abscess.  ID
recommended a chest CT, however, radiology did not feel that the
scan would be informative and the patient has a history of IV
contrast allergy.  She was discharged home on IV antibiotics to
complete a 2 week course and will follow up with Dr. [**
