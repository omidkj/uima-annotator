Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 65-yo woman with interstitial lung disease on
chronic immunosuppression, and h/o left breast Ca s/p partial
mastectomy + adjuvant chemo-XRT, who presented to the ED with
dyspnea. Pt has been feeling unwell since Thursday of last week,
when she initially developed symptoms of headache, dizziness,
body aches, decreased appetite, and inability to get out of bed.
These symptoms have continued since, and since Sunday she has
had significant dyspnea as well. She has been using her home O2
continuously since Sunday (at baseline she only uses 2L NC as
needed for dyspnea). She denies any associated cough or sputum
production, but endorses mild wheeze, stating it feels like a
bronchitis or pneumonia. Overnight last night she developed
subjective chills and sweats, and this morning she found her
temperature to be 101.7F, so she was brought to the ED for
evaluation.

In the ED, VS - Temp 98.0F, BP 128/57, HR 102, R 34, SaO2 78% on
2L NC. Labs were remarkable for an elevated WBC at 11.6 with 90%
PMNs, and lactate 3.6, and negative UA. Blood Cx sent x2. CXR
showed low lung volumes, increased interstitial markings c/w
chronic fibrotic changes, and interstitial edema; an underlying
atypical pneumonia cannot be ruled out. She was given Solumedrol
125mg IV x1, Levofloxacin 750mg IV x1, Vancomycin 1g IV x1, and
2L NS IVF for SBPs ~100. She seemed to improve and was changed
from NRB to 3L NC, but desaturated to 85% on 3L so was restarted
back on the NRB, with good response. CTA was done to r/o PE,
which showed no PE or acute aortic syndrome; lung fibrotic
changes, increased in left lung at site of radiation tx; and no
underlying pneumonia. She is being admitted to the MICU for
further care.

On the floor, pt feels significantly improved. She has been on
daily steroids and azathioprine for several months, with a
recent decrease in her methylprednisolone dose and corresponding
increase in her azathioprine dose on her last visit with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2128-4-7**]. She also complains of mildly painful "pimples"
on the sides of her tongue, which she relates to the increase in
her azathioprine. She also endorses having stopped her Bactrim
PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 5**], but was unsure as to when this was stopped.

Past Medical History:
- Interstitial lung disease, followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], last
seen [**4-/2128**], with increase in Azathioprine to 150mg daily and
decrease in methylprednisolone to 16mg daily

negative, HER-2/neu negative, s/p partial mastectomy, sentinel
node dissection, adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy

breast cancer at 50. No other cancers in the family.

Studies:

[**2128-5-11**] ECG: Normal sinus rhythm. Axis at 0 degrees. Poor R wave
progression. Non-specific ST-T wave changes in leads V1-V3.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**6-12**]-109 the Q-T interval
prolongation is no longer present. The T wave inversions in
leads V1-V3 persist unchanged. The prior T wave inversions in
leads V4-V5 are no longer present. Otherwise, no diagnostic
interval change. These T wave changes are non-specific.

[**2128-5-11**] CXR: Low lung volumes with increased interstitial
markings consistent with chronic fibrotic changes with some
component of interstitial edema; an underlying atypical
pneumonia cannot be ruled out, so repeat radiograph after
diuresis is recommended.

[**2128-5-11**] CT Chest: 1. No PE or acute aortic syndrome.
2. Chronic interstitial fibrotic changes in the lungs with
increased fibrosis and bronchiectasis of the lingula with
subpleural fat consistent with post-radiation changes.

[**2128-5-13**] TTE: The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Mild to
moderate ([**12-6**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
prominent fat pad. IMPRESSION: Preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function. Mild to moderate aortic
regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
65-yo woman with ILD on chronic immunosuppression and PRN home
O2 for symptoms of dyspnea, also with h/o left breast Ca s/p
partial mastectomy and adjuvant chemo-XRT, admitted to the MICU
with respiratory distress and hypoxia.

#. Hypoxia, respiratory distress: Pt admitted with worsened
hypoxia from baseline, somewhat acute and in setting of recent
systemic symptoms. She was also febrile on admission. CXR and
CTA had a faint suggestion of possible pneumonia, with diffuse
faint ground glass opacities new compared to prior CTA from 1
year ago, making multifocal pneumonia a possibility. She
continued to have O2 sats in the high-90s on 6L NC, but with
desaturations to the 60s-70's even with small movements in bed.
She was initially started on ceftriaxone and levofloxacin to
cover for community acquired pneumonia, and was continued on
levofloxacin for a total 5 day course.  She was also placed on
IV steroids (125mg IV methylprednisolone q6h) for three days and
then given high-dose prednisone.  She was also started on NAC
and continued on her home azathioprine.  Her respiratory stat
