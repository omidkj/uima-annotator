nodular liver, diffuse diverticular disease.

Chest x-ray was not done.  Electrocardiogram was not done.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Cirrhosis
2.  Ascites
3.  Portal hypertension
4.  Sigmoid diverticulosis

pubic rami.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a very pleasant elderly female with
the last name of [**Name (NI) 12926**] who presents with a past medical
history significant for cirrhosis, ascites, portal
hypertension, esophageal varices, hypertension, coronary
artery disease, history of chronic renal failure, gout,
recent pelvic fractures and pancreatic insufficiency who
presents essentially with failure to thrive times four to
five days with reported generalized weakness, decreased
appetite, weight loss and diarrhea.

1.  Failure to thrive - The patient has been living with her
daughter since [**2153-3-24**] following pelvic fracture.  The
daughter reports recent decline in function, decreased
appetite, weakness, fatigue, weight loss and recurrent
diarrhea which is an ongoing problem for this patient.  The
patient has had a loss of appetite with decreased p.o. intake
and will be sent to a nursing care facility on discharge for
closer monitoring.  Treatment for failure to thrive consisted
of adequate hydration, encouraging p.o. intake, complete
blood count which ruled out anemia, stool guaiacs which were
subsequently negative.

2.  Diarrhea - The patient had a history of diarrhea,
longstanding, intermittent now, over the last four to five
days up to three to four times a day.  Stool cultures were
sent.  Clostridium difficile toxins were sent, initially read
as negative.  Given the patient's age and chronicity of
diarrhea and extensive work at muscle form, she does not have
any associated respectives for Clostridium difficile colitis,
however, it was determined that an empiric treatment with
Flagyl for ten days may be beneficial in this patient with
little with regards to side effects.  Consequently the
patient was started on 500 mg b.i.d., Flagyl in the setting
of liver disease.  She was treated with dehydration, all
stats were negative.  Kaopectate was continued and
electrolytes were repeated as necessary.

3.  Hyponatremia - The patient has a sodium of 126 on
admission which was down to 128 on [**2153-9-24**], tracking
back upwards on discharge.  She does have a reported history
of sodium of 138 on [**5-13**].  Her decreased sodium was
probably secondary to her ascites with a component of
syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone.  She was
started on a fluid-restricted diet.  The Demeclocycline was
continued at 150 b.i.d.  Urine electrolytes were not assessed
given the fact that she was on Lasix and Aldactone.

4.  Hypertension - The patient came in with elevated blood
pressures of 160 to 190, however, with the initiation of her
medications in-hospital her blood pressures normalized.  She
was continued on her home regimen of Diltiazem, Clonidine and
appropriate diuretic.

5.  Diverticulosis - The patient had a history of and has
evidence of diverticuli on computerized axial tomography
scan.  She had a temperature reported as high as 99.8 in the
hospital.  She had some mild left lower quadrant tenderness
to palpation, subsequently she was started on Ciprofloxacin
500 mg p.o. q.d.

6.  Rule out myocardial infarction - Given the patient's new
lethargy and history of coronary artery disease, she was
initiated for rule out myocardial infarction in the Emergency
Department.  The patient subsequently ruled out with negative
en
