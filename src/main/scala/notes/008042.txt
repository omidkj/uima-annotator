History of Present Illness:
This is a 60 year old woman with CLL/SLL (chronic lymphocytic
leukemia-small lymphocytic lymphoma), recently progressive (with
lymphadenopathy and anemia), s/p treatment with fludarabine,
Cytoxan and Rituxan (last cycle starting on [**2195-12-9**], completed
[**2196-1-5**]) presenting with fever, diarrhea, and hypotension. She
had two recent admissions for fever, with extensive negative
workup. Following her most recent hospital discharge, her
temperature had been around 99 degrees. On Saturday, she
transiently had a temperature to 101.0, lasting only 15 minutes
before returning to 99.4. On Sunday, she awoke with mild
abdominal cramping and had [**12-20**] loose stools. Later that
afternoon, she developed chills, followed by a temperature spike
as high as 103.6. This prompted her to come in to the ED.
.
Other than the above, she denies URI symptoms, sore throat, N/V,
CP, SOB, cough, dysuria. She had a mild headache today which has
now resolved.
.
Initially in the ED, she was febrile to 102.3 and was
tachycardic to 128, with BP 106/52. CXR showed b/l pleural
effusions, but no definite infiltrate. UA was negative for
infection. Stool was sent for C. diff. She was given vancomycin
1g x 2 doses, flagyl 500mg x 2 doses, levofloxacin 750mg x1
dose. She was also given albuterol and atrovent nebs, tylenol,
and toradol. She was given about 2500 cc IVF initially, and then
became SOB, felt to be flash pulmonary edema. SOB improved with
10mg lasix and placement of CPAP. BP continued to remain tenuous
with SBP in 80s, tachy up to 140s, despite 3 L NS at that point.
She was started on low dose of neo. L IJ CVL placed was placed,
CVP 9-10. Over the course of the day neo was on and off. She was
again given 250 cc/bolus x 1 and continued on 150 cc an hour of
NS. Neo was weaned off around 1pm, with BPs high 90s-100s/50s,
HR 80s, satting 100 % on 3L.
.
She was seen by IP and heme/onc in the ED. They recommended CT
chest/abdomen/pelvis which showed pleural effusions but no
consolidation and no abdominal process. Echocardiogram was
performed which ruled out pericardial effusion. She was
transferred to the MICU for further care.
.
Of note, she has had several recent evaluations for fevers:
- [**2195-12-10**]: T 101.7, eval at [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**], BCx and UCx negative,
sent home without abx.
- [**2195-12-18**]: chest tightness, CXR with b/l pl effusions, treated
with cipro 500mg [**Hospital1 **] given baseline ureteral obstruction and
concern for predisposition to UTI
- [**2195-12-19**]: ongoing fevers, admitted for febrile neutropenia.
Started on cefepime, then changed to vanco/meropenem (stopped
[**12-22**]). BCx, UCx, DFA for flu negative.
- [**2195-12-26**]: returned with fevers. No other sx. B/L pleural
effusions. R Dx [**Female First Name (un) 576**] [**12-28**]: exudative, cx neg. R VATS [**1-1**] with
transudative fluid. Both times cytology showed small mature
lymphocytes and reactive mesothelial cells. No growth from
pleural fluid cx. Cultures and DFA flu negative. Initially on
vanc/[**Last Name (un) 2830**]/azithro. Completed 5d azithro, vanc was d/c'd, [**Last Name (un) 2830**]
changed to augmentin for total 10d course.
.


Past Medical History:
1. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (small lymphocytic lymphoma).
In 10/00, she had removal of a left inguinal lymph node showing
CLL/SLL.  In [**2191**], she had excisional biopsy of a rapidly
enlarging submental mass that showed small lymphocytic lymphoma
without evidence of transformation.  On [**2195-10-1**], she was
evaluated for a skin rash on her thighs.  Biopsies were obtained
showing "palisading granulomatous dermatitis" c/w "granuloma
annulare or annular elastocytic granuloma." She began topical
steriods, with improvement in treated lesions. However,
additional asymptomatic disc-shaped erythematous lesions
appeared in crops on both thighs.  Torso CT scan [**2195-11-26**] showed
extensive thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic lymphadenopathy
consistent with progression of her known lymphoma; left ureteral
obstruction by a retroperitoneal lymphomatous mass with
hydronephrosis of the left kidney; massive retroperitoneal
adenopathy encasing the aorta and part of the IVC; and multiple
pulmonary nodules, the majority of which were unchanged from the
prior study of 10/00, with at least two new pulmonary nodules up
to 7 mm in diameter.  These findings were felt to be consistent
with progressive systemic adenopathy.  In view of this,
alongside development of moderate anemia, systemic chemotherapy
was initiated last month as noted above.
2. reactive airways disease
3. osteoarthritis
4. vitamin B12 deficiency
5. right breast nodular opacity on [**10-23**] mammogram that was not
seen on [**11-24**] ultrasound
6. anxiety

Social History:
She lives at home with her husband and her adult daughter.  She
was born and raised in MA.  She lived in [**Location **] for 18 months and
has traveled to [**Country 6607**] but has never left North America.  She
quit smoking cigarettes 20 years ago.  She does not drink
alcohol or use illicit drugs.


Family History:
Her husband was hospitalized with an MI last month.  Her
granddaughter may have been diagnosed with rubella last month;
the patient has not been in contact with this granddaughter
since this diagnosis, although she was likely in contact with
her soon before the diagnosis.
