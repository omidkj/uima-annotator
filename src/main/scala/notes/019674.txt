MR CERVICAL SPINE

Reason: eval for cord/ligament injury

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
17 year old woman with known C1 & C2 fx
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for cord/ligament injury
INDICATION: 17-year-old unrestrained back seat passenger in a
motor vehicle accident with known C1 and C2 fracture. Assess for
spinal cord/ligamentous injury.

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images of the
cervical spine without IV contrast.

Comparison is made to CT of the cervical spine performed seven
hours earlier.

FINDINGS: The images are slightly limited in quality due to
motion artifact. Again seen is the transverse fracture through
the dens, better appreciated on the prior CT scan.

Increased T2 and STIR signal intensity is seen in the spinal
cord extending from the level of the tip of the dens to the
superior endplate of the C4 vertebral body. There is mild
expansion of the cord at the level of the body of C2. Axial
gradient echo images demonstrate susceptibility artifact
centrally in the cord at the level of C2.

At the C2-3 and C3-4 levels, there is mild left paracentral disc
bulging with mild narrowing of the left neural foramina at these
levels. There is no central canal stenosis. Vertebral body and
intervertebral disc signal elsewhere in the cervical spine is
normal. Mild edema is seen in the prevertebral soft tissues. The
patient is intubated, however. Increased T2 and STIR signal
intensity is also seen in the interspinous area posterior to C2.

IMPRESSION:
1. Signal abnormalities in the spinal cord indicate focal areas
of hemorrhage in the central cord posterior to C2, and cord
edema from C2-C4 as described above. There is also mild
expansion of the cord at the C2 level.

2. Probable ligamentous injury of the interspinous ligaments at
the level of C2-3.

3. Mild left paracentral disc bulges at C2-3 and C3-4 with mild
left neural foraminal narrowing.

Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at the completion
of the examination.

FEMUR (AP & LAT) SOFT TISSUE R

Reason: eval fx

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
17 year old woman with MVC and likely R femur fx
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval fx
HISTORY: Fracture.

Two radiographs of the right femur demonstrate a displaced
fracture through the mid diaphysis of the right femur. Limited
assessment of the knee and hip joints is unremarkable. Ionated
contrast is present within urinary bladder as is a Foley
catheter balloon.

IMPRESSION:

Displaced right femoral diaphyseal fracture.

These findings were reported to the ED dashboard at the time of
image interpretation.

MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST; MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST

Reason: Eval. for vertebral artery dissection
Contrast: MAGNEVIST

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
17 year old woman s/p C2-C4 cord contusion and C1 fx, now
paraplegic with fevers and new onset vertical nystagmus
concerning for new brainstem lesion.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Eval. for vertebral artery dissection
MRI/MRA OF THE BRAIN

HISTORY: 17-year-old female status post C2 through C4 cord
contusion with C1 and C2 fractures, now with fevers.

MRI BRAIN:

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar, multisequence MR images of the brain
with triplanar post-gadolinium images were obtained.

FINDINGS: There are areas of susceptibility artifact of the
posterior upper neck and skull base consistent with artifacts
from surgical fusion. The upper spinal cord and the adjacent
medulla are expanded and have increased T2 signal. There are
also areas of enhancement, both within and at the periphery of
these regions. There are no signal changes indicative of blood
within the spinal cord or medulla. No epidural fluid collections
or abscesses are seen, although evaluation is somewhat limited
by adjacent artifact. The above findings may represent changes
of cord and brainstem contusion vs. infection, with no evidence
of abscess formation.

A type 2 dens fracture is present.

No extra-axial fluid collections are seen. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white matter
differentiation is maintained. There is no shift of the normally
midline structures. The ventricles, sulci, and basal cisterns
are normal.

The orbits and paranasal sinuses are normal. Soft tissue changes
of the mastoid air cells bilaterally are seen.

MRA:

TECHNIQUE: 3D TOF of the intracranial arteries and 2D TOF of the
cervical arteries were obtained with MIP reconstructions.
Post-gadolinium coronal FAME of the cervical and intracranial
vessels were also obtained. Axial T1 fat sat images of the neck
were also obtained.

FINDINGS: The V4 segment of the right vertebral artery is
hypoplastic but patent. No occlusions, dissections, or aneurysms
are seen.

IMPRESSION: No vertebral artery dissections.

Enhancement, expansion, and T2 hyperintensity involving the
upper cervical cord and medulla which likely represents changes
of contusion Vs. infection without abscess formation. Posterior
cervical spinal fusion with a type 2 dens fracture still
visible.
