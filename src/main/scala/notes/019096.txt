Attending:[**Known firstname 943**]
Chief Complaint:
Worsening Liver Disease

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
54 year-old M with DM, CRI, and bipolar disorder who is
transferred from [**Hospital3 3583**] for worsened liver dysfunction.
He was admitted to [**Hospital3 3583**] on [**3-31**] with SOB and weakness.
He was found to have fever and was started on ceftriaxone, with
unknown source. His LFTs began to increase on [**4-2**] (bili
1.6->15.9). MRCP and CT Abdomen did not show intrahepatic or
extrahepatic bile duct dilation. Small liver lesions found were
likely hemangiomas; the spleen was moderately enlarged. Out of
concern for drug-induced transaminitis, ceftriaxone was switched
to levoflox on [**4-6**]. This was stopped on [**4-8**] due to continued
increase in LFTs. His depakote was stopped, with psychiatry
consultation, but then restarted on transfer. After consultation
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**], the patient was transferred for possible liver
biopsy.

During his hospital stay he presented in renal failure and a
tunneled dialysis catheter was placed [**4-2**] for three times
weekly HD. His SOB was attributed to CHF, uremia, and anemia. He
was mildy hypoxic, requiring 2L of NC; ABG 7.33/60/87. This was
thought to be due to a history of sleep apnea, although he had
never been on CPAP in the past. He also had hematuria, seen by
urology, that was attributed to foley trauma.

ROS: He complains of pruritus. He also notes nausea and poor
appetite, without vomiting. No changes in color of stools or
urine. Pt denies recent weight loss or gain. Reports dry cough.
No shortness of breath. Denied chest pain or tightness,
palpitations. Denied diarrhea, constipation, or abdominal pain.
No melena or BRBPR. No dysuria. He was dialyzed 2L today. No
history of blood transfusions, IVDA, liver disease.

Pertinent Results:
[**2122-4-14**] Liver U/S: This is an extremely limited study due to
patient's size and inherent noise with limited acoustic windows.
The liver appears normal in size. There are no grossly evident
focal lesions seen. There is no evidence of ascites, but the
spleen appears mildly enlarged at 13.4 cm. The portal vein and
right and left branches are patent with forward flow. Hepatic
veins are visualized in left middle and right trunks and are
fully patent as is the cava. Hepatic arteries are also patent.
The pancreas cannot be adequately imaged. Limited views of both
kidneys show normal size and no evidence of hydronephrosis. No
gallstones or bile duct dilatation is noted.
CONCLUSION: Technically limited study with no gross liver
lesions or ascites seen. Patent portal and hepatic venous
vasculature. Mild splenomegaly.

[**2122-4-15**] Renal U/S: FINDINGS: The left and right kidneys are
unchanged in size or appearance when compared to the prior
study. No renal mass lesions, stones, or hydronephrosis is
noted. No perirenal fluid collections are noted. Right kidney
measures 12.2 cm in length. The left kidney measures
approximately 13.2 cm in length. Doppler studies are performed
which reveal patent arterial and venous flow to the right kidney
with peak systolic velocity of approximately 30 cm/sec. Patent
arterial and venous flow is also noted in the left kidney with
peak systolic velocities of approximately 25 cm/sec.
IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis in left or right kidneys, patent
arterial flow to both kidneys.

CXR: IMPRESSION:
Low lung volumes. Bibasilar opacities likely represent
atelectasis, but early basilar pneumonia is not excluded and
followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard. If clinical
suspicion for infection persists, followup radiograph with
improved inspiratory level may be helpful to fully exclude early
basilar pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
54 year-old M with DM, CRI, and bipolar disorder who is
transferred from OSH for worsened liver dysfunction for liver
biopsy.  Active issues include:

# Liver dysfunction: Etiology for liver disease remained unclear
but as LFTs improved significantly, it was ultimately attributed
to reaction to ceftriaxone with perhap underlying chronic liver
disease such as NASH/NAFLD (given history of splenomegaly).
Valproic acid may also cause chronic hepatocellular necrosis.
Hepatitis serologies negative, [**Doctor First Name **]/AMA negative. His depakote
was stopped. Liver biopsy was not necessary as LFT's improved
rapidly.
- Patient will f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**]

# Bipolar: Psychiatry was consulted to help manage patient's
psych regimen after depakote was stopped. He was started on 5 mg
Abilify and titrated to 10 mg daily. Depakote was not restarted
given that it may have been chronically causing liver disease
and is also hepatically cleared. Patient had been managed by his
PCP regarding his psych meds, but has a new outpatient
psychiatrist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 29004**] in [**Location (un) 22287**])scheduled (first appointment 3
weeks post discharge). He was also started on Lamictal 25 mg
daily given that it may be less hepatotoxic than depakote. Post
discharge, he will need:
- LFT's checked by PCP within [**Name Initial (PRE) **] week of starting lamictal
- Patient and wife alerted of risk for [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **].
- Lamictal 25 mg X 2 weeks and then if tolerating, can double
the dose.

# Low-grade Fever: Patient intially had low grade temp with mild
leukocytosis. This was felt to be inflammatory from
drug-reaction and less likely to be infectious.  For remainder
of hospital course, he remained afebrile and had no sources for
infection.

# CHF: patient has history of diastolic dysfunction. He
continued lisinopril, B-blocker, and imdur.

# Rash: Upon tranfser, pat
