abd [**4-29**]:
IMPRESSION: Non-obstructive bowel gas pattern. Prominent
degenerative changes along the lower thoracic and lumbar spine
with mild loss of height of L1 and L2, indeterminate in age.

cxr [**4-29**]:
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
.
echo [**4-30**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 5-10 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with apical
akinesis/hypokinesis (no LV thrombus
identified). Overall left ventricular systolic function is
mildly depressed. Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity
imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic
dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] F presents from NH w/ N/V and hypotension, now resolved.
.
# Hypotension- The patient was admitted for hypotension that
resolved with multiple boluses of IV fluids.  Likely hypovolemia
after viral gastroenteritis given history of [**Age over 90 **], vomiting
and diarrhea. Did not appear septic on admission and blood/urine
cultures are negative to date, but final blood cultures are
pending and should be followed at the nursing home. She was
initially on cipro and flagyl for possible GI infection, but as
she was afebrile and her blood pressure improved these were
stopped.  She had normal LFT's.  She likely had an element of
chronotropic incompetence given her toprol use.  She was
restarted on a low dose of metoprolol which should be increased
as tolerated and her lisinopril and lasix were held and may be
restarted when her blood pressure can tolerate this.  She should
have close blood pressure monitoring at rehab.
.
# Acute Renal Failure- Her creatinine was 1.8 on admission, but
normal at discharge.  Her FeUrea was 21% on admission, so her
renal failure was likely prerenal as it resolved with IVF.  As
above she had normal renal function at discharge.
.
# Diastolic CHF - Diastolic dysfunction on ECHO in-house.  Given
the patient's hypotension her ACE inhibitor and lasix were held.
 She appeared euvolemic during her course and with improvement
of her blood pressure she should have her lasix 40 mg daily and
lisinopril 5 mg daily restarted. Now appears relatively
euvolemic.
.
# Ulcers: The patient had ulcers on her heels and coccyx.  For
her heels she should have the tissue dried with guauze and then
apply moisture barrier ointment to the periwound tissue with
each drg change.  Apply a thin layer of DuoDerm Gel (wound gel)
to the open ulcers.  Cover with dry gauze, ABD, Kerlix wrap and
change dressing daily.  For her perineal/coccyx she should have
cleansing with Foam Cleanser, and application of Aloe Vesta
Moisture Barrier ointment to the affected area [**Hospital1 **] and prn.  She
did well with this in the hospital per wound care
recommendations.
.
# Dementia - No issues during the course continued aricept, and
namemda
.
# Hypercholesterolemia- No issues with continuation of lipitor.

.
# CAD - She had elevated troponin with flat CK, so likely demand
from hypotension.  She had no signs of ACS and was continued on
aspirin.  She will continue lipitor, metoprolol and aspirin.
.
# Diabetes - Placed on RISS while inpatient with good control,
and was restarted on glyburide on discharge
.
# Anxiety- Continued on celexa, and zyprexa.  She can be given
zyprexa as needed for agitation.
