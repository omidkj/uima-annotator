Service:  GENERAL SURGERY
INDICATIONS/HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  Ms. [**Known lastname 30113**] is a 56
year-old female with a history of cerebrovascular accident,
labile hypertension who developed abdominal pain this past
Friday and has progressively worsened over this time.  The
patient had also reported positive nausea, vomiting and
but was having some chills.  The patient was not able to
tolerate any po intake at any level.  She has had no sick
contacts.  She has had no history of IVD.  She had no recent
travel.  She tried no new foods.  She does complain of
dysuria and burning on urination, however.  Her history is
noted to be of somewhat questionable reliability secondary to
the fact that she has had multiple cerebrovascular accidents.
she was transferred from on [**2138-10-23**], she does have
positive staph aureus in her urine greater then 50,000
colonies, due to the fact that the patient has labile blood
pressures with systolics in the 180s to 200s she was placed
on a nitro drip and being worked up for her nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea and dysuria and had been placed in an IC setting at
[**Hospital3 4527**] under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  When there was
a question of abdominal pain and question rule out
appendicitis given the fact that she seemed to have some
right lower quadrant tenderness on examination a surgical
consultation had been obtained with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2819**].  At that
time it was felt that the best thing to pursue diagnostically
was CAT scan with po contrast.  She could not get intravenous
contrast due to a suspected to an allergy to intravenous
contrast in the past.  Therefore to facilitate the workup to
rule out appendicitis she was transferred to the [**Hospital1 346**] where she could receive a surgical
consultation, CAT scan as well as further monitoring.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Cerebrovascular accident, gout,
asthma, hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, EF of 66%
with normal wall motion by echocardiogram done on [**2137-2-7**].  Sick sinus syndrome.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for laparoscopic
cholecystectomy.  She had pacer placement for tachybrady
syndrome.

ALLERGIES:  Compazine, Tylenol, Percocet, intravenous
contrast, Nipride, Cipro, Penicillin, Bactrim, amoxicillin,
sulfa.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Advair, Allopurinol 100 q day,
Elavil 50 q.h.s., Probenecid 250 b.i.d., Clonidine .6 mg
topically q week by patch.  Colchicine .6 mg t.i.d.  She is
on a Fentanyl patch 100 micrograms q 72, Klonopin .25 mg
b.i.d., Lopresor 25 mg b.i.d., Norvasc 10 mg q.d., Lasix 40
mg q.d., Oxycodone and Pericolace as well as a nitro drip.
Her home medications not including her transfer medications,
her typical home medications include Advair, Lopressor,
Catapres patch, sublingual nitroglycerin and a Duragesic
patch.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She was noted to have a temperature of
99.3.  Pulse 81 and regular.  Blood pressure 176/89.
Respiratory rate 12.  Sating 99%.  She was alert and awake.
She answers to all questions.  She is noted to have decreased
strength on her left side consistent with her baseline
secondary to cerebrovascular accidents.  Her heart was
regular rate and rhythm with no murmur.  Lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  She had some mild right
costovertebral angle tenderness.  Her abdomen was
nondistended, mildly suprapubic tenderness.  She had some
mild right lower quadrant tenderness.  There was no guarding.
No rebound.  She had normoactive bowel sounds.  There was no
percussion tenderness.  No shake tenderness.  She had no
bruits and no masses palpated.  Her extremities were without
any evidence of clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  There was no
calf tenderness.

ASSESSMENT/PLAN:  Rule out appendicitis versus other
intra-abdominal process and also to treat her for a question
of pyelonephritis versus urosepsis.  She was on broad
spectrum antibiotics with Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone and Flagyl.
Blood cultures and urine cultures were sent.  She was placed
on LR 80 an hour.  An A line was placed for blood pressure
monitoring.  A CAT scan had been obtained with po contrast,
which had contrast all the way through to the colon.  The
appendix was well visualized.  There was no evidence of
periappendocele inflammation.  No phlegmon.  There was no
intra-abdominal abscess.  Gerota's and the perinephric fat
bilaterally showed no evidence of stranding or abscess.
There was no evidence of hydronephrosis.  She did have a
question of some mild cecal wall thickening, however, there
was no pneumatosis, no free air and there was no free fluid.
Given the relatively negative CAT scan of the abdomen the
presumed diagnosis of urosepsis, the patient continued on
broad spectrum antibiotics with Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone and
Flagyl. Her blood cultures and urine cultures were pending at
this time, however, urine cultures from [**Hospital3 4527**] had
revealed that she had grown out staph aureus as well as a
possible gram negative rod elsewhere.

Given the negative workup and the fact that there was no
evidence of surgical intervention required the patient was
transferred back to the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at the [**First Name (Titles) 29718**] [**Last Name (Titles) 15593**] Care Unit where she will continue to be
treated for presumed urosepsis and for her labile blood
pressure management.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  LR 80 cc an hour, nitrodrip prn to
maintain systolic blood pressure of 170/90 knowing that her
systolic blood pressures below this level actually can create
infarction for her.  Lopressor 5 mg intravenous q 6,
Clonidine patch .6 mg q week, Colchicine .5 mg t.i.d.,
Duragesic 100 mg patch topically q 72 hours, Advair as taken
previously, Vancomycin 1 gram intravenous q 12 with peak and
troughs to be checked with third dose.  Ceftriaxone 1 gram
intravenous q 24 hours.  Flagyl 500 mg intravenous q 12.
Protonix 40 mg intravenous q day and Lovenox 40 mg subQ q day
for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis.

TREATMENTS AND FREQUENCIES:  The patient's follow up plan
from a GI and surgical standpoint is that the patient will
need a colonoscopy to evaluate her cecum as an outpatient.
She has an overall improved abdominal examination and has no
evidence of surgical disease at this time.  She will need
continuous blood pressure monitoring and she does have a
radial A line in place.  The remainder of her care and workup
will be pursued by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at the [**First Name (Titles) 4527**] [**Last Name (Titles) 15593**]
Care Unit.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] has been notified and spoken to
directly.  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2819**] did examine the patient on
[**2138-10-24**] after having seen the patient in consultation at
the outside hospital and he agrees the patient should be
transferred accordingly.
