Chief Complaint:
transfer from MWH for cardiac catheterization for CP with trops
elevation to 0.79, likely NSTEMI (non ST elevation myocardial
infarction)

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
84yo male with CAD - CABG x5 in [**2094**] (LIM to LAD, SVG to DA, SVG
to [**Female First Name (un) **], SVG to PDA, SVG to lt ventr branches), MI in [**2070**], s/p
AAA repair, s/p fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass, CRF on HD is transferred from
MWH for cath for ?dx of MI.
Patient initially presented to MWH ED on [**2108-9-24**] with c/o

Cardiac cath:1. Coronary and grft angiography showed a previous
right
dominant system. The LMCA was diffusely disesed with no focal or

critical lesions. The LAD tapered off in the mid segment until a
large
S2 where it is totally occluded. The D1 and D2 are small vessels
and
are diffusely diseased. The D3 which recived a SVG  is not seen
in the
LMCA injection. The Mid and the distal LAD receives the LIMA.
The Cx
vessel it self has no lesions. It gives a lengthy collateral.
The OM1
arises close to the LMCA and is small. The OM2 too arises close
to the
LMCA and is large. This has a proximal lesion of 80%. The OM3
recives the SVG and is not seen on LMCA injection. The
OM4/postero
latateral branch arises distally and is a small vessel. The RCA
is
occluded proximally. The distal RCA including the PDA and the
PLV are
collateralised by the left system. The PDA is poorly filled and
has a
mid 60% lesion. The LIMA , the LIMA-LAD anastomosis and the
distal LAD
are free of disease. The LIMA fills the LAD retrogradely to
supply the
proximal LAD and the D3. The D3 has an ostial 70% lesion with
TIMI III
flow. The SV grafts to the RCA and the PLB are occluded
completely and
are seen as stumps in the aorta. The graft to the Diagonal could
not be
located, but is likely to be occluded given the other
angiogaphic
findings. The SVG to the OM3 shows diffuse disease with a mid
lengthy
lesion of 99 % and the whole vessel showed TIMI II flow. There
were no
collaterals for this OM.
2. Left ventriculography was not performed.
3. Predilation using 1.5 X 15 Maverick balloon, stenting using
3.0 X 28
and 3.0 X 33 OTW Cypher stents and thrombus extraction using
export
catheter with gradual deterioration of flow of the SVG to the
OM3. The
flow deteriorated from TIMI I to TIMI 0.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel native coronary artery disease with functioning
LIMA to
the LAD.
2. Acute occlusion of the SVG to the OM and chronically occluded
SV
grafts to the PDA, PLB and Diagonal.
3. Unable to restore flow in the SVG to the OM despite stenting,

pharmacotherapy and thrombus aspiration. .
Echo: . The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed. Basal inferior
hypokinesis is present.
3. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
There is
moderate aortic valve stenosis.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
5. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
.
ct scan:
1. No evidence of intrahepatic gas as suggested on prior
ultrasound. Repeat ultrasound is suggested given this change in
appearance.
2. Bibasilar dependent atelectatic changes/consolidation with
associated effusions.
3. Gas distended loops of bowel with air-fluid levels but
without transition suggesting ileus. Stool distended rectum.
4. Small infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.




Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted with unstable angina, had total occlusion of all
svg grafts with a patent LIMA to LAD, and received 2 cypher
stents.  His catheterization was compicted by failed thrombus
extractuib abd a TIMI 0.  After catherization he had persistent
CP and evidence of a NSTEMI.  Initially he was not treated with
ASA because of a past GI bleed, but with persistent ischemia, it
was added to the plavix.  He required a significant of morphine
to controll his pain.  Through discussions between the MICU team
and the family pain control was determined to be the only option
for him.  His code status was changed to DNR/DNI/.  Due to
ongoing ischemia, he had persistent hypotension that required
multiple pressors.  His HD was changed to CVVH because of his
low blood presssure.  He also had intermittent NSVT.  He had
been transferred from the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] team to the MICU team due to
hypotension at HD after his cardiac catheterization out of
concern for possible sepsis.  There was a concern that he had an
acute abdomen but he appeared to be impacted with stool.  He was
disimpacted and received an aggresive bowel regimen.  His
distension and pain improved.  He had low grade temperatures and
was initially treated for pneumonia because he was hypoxic.  No
source of infection was identified.  It is more likely that he
was in cardiogenic shock with fluid overload.  A repeat bedside
echo did not reveal worsening ventricular function.  He required
blood transfusions for persistently dropping HCT in the setting
of very frequent blood draws.  He also had a coagulopathy which
did not appear to be from DIC.  He required vitamin K
supplementation.  He expired at 6:45am on [**2108-10-5**] after an
episode of severe chest pain.
