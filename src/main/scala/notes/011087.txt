Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
L frontal ICH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 84 M PMH dementia, NIDDM, HTN, hyperchol and GI ulcers
transferred from OSH ED after being found by wife at 2am in
reclining chair having trouble making words.  Wife checked SBP
and noted >200, called EMS.  OSH Head CT revealed a 5.5cm L
frontal lobe ICH with blood in left frontal, b/l occipital horns
and with 5mm midline shift to the right.

At OSH, VS [**Telephone/Fax (2) 77945**]6-97% 2L NC.  GCS 14.  Not oriented to
place or time and was confused but able to follow commands.
nitro drip started -> BP 187/80.  Rec'd metoprolol and zofran.
EKG RBBB.

Upon arrival to ED, 97.9  52  163/74  16  97% 3L.  Per nrse
note,
pt alert, oriented to person only, slow to react but able to
follow commands and answer most simple questions.

BP elevated to 202/101 started on nitro gtt with subsequent dip
in BP to 88/42.  Pt became pale with decreased resp, nitro
stopped and pt intubated for resp distress with Lido, Vec,
Etomidate and Succinylcholine.  Also, rec'd fentanyl 100mg IV
for
sedation.  Vitals recovered to 138/49 62.  Rec'd atropine 1amp
also given for HR 32, pt placed on pacer pads.

Repeat NCHCT repeated and reviewed with Nsurg attg showing
stable
bleed, no significant change in size.  Nsurg consulted and felt
that no surgical intervention indicated at this time given
amount
of atrophy allowing for minimal mass effect of bleed and
stability of bleed and baseline status of patient which was
discussed with family who agreed.

ROS: At OSH, denied vision changes, HA or recent falls.


Past Medical History:
dementia
hypercholesterolemia
HTN
NIDDM
bleeding ulcers s/p "stomach operation"
s/p appy
Denies prior stroke.

Neurologic examination:
Mental status: Responds to noxious stim only and spontaneously
moving legs bilaterally but not opening eyes or following
commands.  Per nurse when light on propofol, bites on ETT and
moves to pull tube L>R arm.

Cranial Nerves:
Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 2 to 1 mm
bilaterally.  +Corneals and grimaces to nasal tickle
bilaterally.
Unable to elicit EOMs partial alertness or assess facial assym

Motor/Sensory
Increased tone in legs bilaterally, mildly decreased in right
arm.  Extends to noxious stim in legs bilaterally and left arm.
Internally rotates the right arm to noxious stim.  Normal bulk
bilaterally. No observed myoclonus or tremor.

Reflexes:
+2, maybe slightly brisker on the right and absent achilles.
Toes downgoing bilaterally.

Coordination/Gait/Romberg: Unobtainable.

[**4-24**] CT torso without contrast.
COMPARISON:  [**2143-4-13**].
A tracheostomy tube tip projects approximately 6 cm from the
carina.  A left-sided PICC terminates at the SVC/brachiocephalic
junction.  There is CT evidence of anemia.  Coronary artery
calcification and calcific atherosclerotic plaque within the
thoracic aorta is again noted.
There is moderate cardiomegaly.  Large mediastinal lymph nodes
again noted, most prominent measuring 1.5 cm in short axis
(2:22).  Bibasilar
consolidations and small-to-moderate pleural effusions again
noted
bilaterally. There are moderate centrilobular emphysematous
changes within
the lung apices bilaterally.
CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST:  Intra-abdominal and intrapelvic
organs cannot be well evaluated given lack of intravenous
contrast administration.  No gross liver lesion is detected.
The spleen, adrenal glands, right kidney, and large and small
bowel are grossly unremarkable.  There is calcific
atherosclerotic plaque throughout the abdominal aorta and its
branches.  No free fluid or free air is detected within the
abdomen.  There is colonic diverticulosis diffusely. The left
kidney again demonstrates a hypoattenuating lesion in the
interpolar region which cannot be further characterized given
lack of intravenous contrast administration.  A gastrostomy tube
is detected within the stomach.
CT PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST:  Air and urine is detected within
the urinary
bladder.  There is prostatic enlargement with coarse
calcification within the prostate centrally.  A large amount of
stool is present within the rectum.  There is a right inguinal
hernia with a small amount of nonobstructed small bowel and
mesenteric fat within.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  There are numerous healed rib fractures in
the
anterolateral aspects consistent with prior trauma.  There are
multilevel
degenerative changes within the lumbar spine.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Bibasilar consolidations in which an infectious process
cannot be
excluded.  Moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
2.  No intra-abdominal or intrapelvic fluid collections are
detected to
suggest abscess, however, evaluation is limited given lack of
intravenous
contrast administration.
3.  Cardiomegaly, coronary artery calcifications and
pathologically enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.
4.  Right nonobstructive inguinal hernia with small bowel
within.
5.  Moderate centrilobular emphysematous change.
