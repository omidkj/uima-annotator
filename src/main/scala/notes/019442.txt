History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 11386**] is an 82yo M w/ PMH of CAD s/p 2 MIs and CABG in [**2096**]
who presented to OSH today after developing "shakes" at home
while getting dressed. Denies overt chest pain, but states he
had chest discomfort [**6-12**], starting in his chest and radiating
to his shoulders bilaterally. + diaphoresis, but no jaw pain or
SOB. Has not had any prior episodes of angina since his CABG. No
n/v. Called his daughter after onset of sx, then called EMS. Was
taken by EMS to NWH where he had an EKG performed which showed
profound ST elevations in II, III, avF, V3-V6 with reciprocal ST
depressions in aVL, aVR, V1, and V2. He received atropine x1 for
bradycardia and was then started on integrillin, heparin gtt,
plavix and IVF. He was then tx to [**Hospital1 18**] cath lab where he
underwent emergent cardiac cath.

urination. Denies any prior episodes of angina since CABG. Able
to do daily activities. States he was walking 1 mi/day prior to
weather getting colder.

.
ECHO [**2106-2-8**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately to severely
depressed with global hypokinesis and akinesis of the inferior
and infero-lateral walls. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. There
is moderate global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic root is mildly dilated. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired
relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CATH [**2106-2-10**]:
1. Limited selective coronary angiography demonstrated single
vein
graft disease. The SVG-RCA demonstrated no angiographically
apparent,
flow-limiting disease including the native vessel distal to the

touchdown which was involved with the STEMI. The SVG-diagonal
was
without angiographically apparent, flow-limiting disease. The
SVG-LAD
had an ostial 70% lesion.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed central hypertension
with
blood pressure of 182/93 mmHg.
3. Successful placement of 3.0 x 18 mm Cypher drug-eluting stent
in
the ostial SVG-LAD. Final angiography demonstrated no residual
stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and normal
flow (See PTCA Comments).
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Single vein graft stenosis.
2. Central hypertension.
3. Successful placement of drug-eluting stent in SVG-LAD.

Brief Hospital Course:
82yo M w/ STEMI now s/p cath with DES to R RCA/PDA. Plan is to
go back to cath for stent to LAD today.

# ISCHEMIA: Mr. [**Known lastname 11386**] already had elevated cardiac enzymes on
presentation to the CCU, with inferior and lateral ST elevations
on his EKG. On catheterization, it was found that one of his
grafts, the SVG -> distal RCA, had 100% occlusion at distal
anastomosis involving both PDA and PL branch bifurcation. A DES
was placed in the r-PDA and the r-PL had a balloon angioplasty,
with restoration of TIMI 3 flow. He was on intregrillin for 18
hours post-cath. Post-cath, he had residual ST elevations in the
inferior and lateral leads and persistent chest pain, though it
was much improved from the pain he had on admission. His cardiac
enzymes peaked on [**2106-2-7**], with CK of 5712, CKMB >500, MBI 8.5,
and troponins of >25. He was initially on a nitro gtt, but that
was weaned off as his blood pressure was low. He had no change
in his pain off the nitro gtt. His chest pain resolved on its
own on HD #[**Street Address(2) 16957**] elevations still persisted. He was
started on ASA, plavix, bblocker, ACE-i, and a statin. Based on
the results of his first catheterization, it was decided to
repeat a catheterization on [**2106-2-10**] and to stent his LAD graft
(which had a 70% ostial stenosis). He received mucomyst and
bicarb prior to his second catheterization for his chronic renal
insufficiency (Cr was 2.2). He tolerated the second
catheterization well. There were no groin complications from
either cath and he was able to be discharged home, with close
follow-up with his cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 16958**].
.
# PUMP: Mr. [**Known lastname 11386**] had an ECHO on [**2106-2-8**] which showed his EF to be
30%, down from LVEF of >55% in [**4-7**] (on an ECHO from his PCP's
office). The ECHO showed that he has akinetic inferior and
