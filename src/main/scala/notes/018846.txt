CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

HISTORY: Congestive heart failure.

UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Increasing moderate bilateral
pleural effusions, right greater than left are present.
Additionally, bibasilar opacities reflecting atelectasis
persists. Rounded opacity within the medial aspect of the right
base also may represent right middle lobe collapse. The cardiac
contours are obscured by the basilar atelectasis. The
mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, and there is no
evidence of pulmonary vascular engorgement. Calcifications of
the mitral annulus and aortic knob are unchanged. There is no
pneumothorax. Right-sided dual chamber pacemaker with leads
overlying the right atrium and right ventricle, unchanged. Right
internal jugular central venous catheter with tip overlying the
SVC is stable. Severe degenerative changes are present within
both shoulders.

IMPRESSION: Increasing moderate-sized bilateral pleural
effusions, right greater than left. Bibasilar atelectasis
persists. Possible right middle lobe collapse.

aorta with no
atherosclerotic plaque. Normal aortic root diameter. Simple
atheroma in aortic  root. Simple atheroma in ascending aorta.

annular calcification. Moderate thickening of mitral valve
chordae. Mild (1+)  MR.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous echo contrast
is seen in the  body of the left atrium. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of  the left atrium. No
mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s).

No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right
atrium. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric  left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size. The left ventricular  cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is  moderately depressed. No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. R.  Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending,  transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal
in diameter and free of  atherosclerotic plaque. There are
simple atheroma in the aortic root. There  are simple atheroma
in the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. There is  mild aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral  valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is moderate thickening of the  mitral valve
chordae. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.
