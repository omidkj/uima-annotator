Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 695**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal Pain and Vomiting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD [**2-18**]
ERCP [**2-22**], 2/19
[**2118-3-15**]: Extensive lysis of adhesions, gastrojejunostomy.


History of Present Illness:
65 year old male with hx of CBD stricture s/p Common bile duct
excision, cholecystectomy, Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy
transferred from OSH with abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting and
WBC. Patient states he was admitted to OSH last week for
pancreatitis after having some abd pain and lipase checked by
PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 21299**] slowly to full liquid diet and discharged home on
Tuesday, [**2118-2-15**]. Then night of [**2118-2-16**] after a low fat meal, he
developed severe epigastric pain, nausea/vomiting which lasted
for 36 hours and presented again to OSH ED. CT scan from workup
from previous admission ([**2-9**]) to OSH shows pancreatic head mass,
gastritis with possible GOO and evidence of portal venous HTN
w/possible varices. He was given zosyn and then transfered for
further evaluation. On arrival to our ED, his vitals were
stable, he was given zofran, morphine, valium. KUB was done
which showed a nonspecific gas pattern. ERCP was called who
recommended an U/S guided biopsy.
.
On admission to the floor, he was vomiting dark black coffee
ground material and reported melenotic stool x1 days. He reports
vomiting all day. NG lavage was performed. A total of 400 cc of
water was flushed with dark black emesis for return. Emesis
continued to return without flush and a total of 5.5 L of black
(non-red) emesis was drained. NG tube was left on low
intermittent suction. GI was consulted with plan for EGD this
morning. Pt was type/crossed and ordered for 2U prbcs.
.
Patients Hct on arrival to the ED 35 -->32->30->29 this AM.
Patient was given some fluids 150cc/hr. Pts BP initially stable
but trended down to Systolics of 90s and he was bolus'd 1Liter
with improvement 110s. Given he could not obtain blood
transfusion during an EGD down in the endoscopsy suite; he was
transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring.
.
He currently reports he has [**1-16**] abdominal pain. Denies CP;/SOB.
He reports no nausea, + vomiting overnight.

ronchi
CV: Regular rate and rhythm no murmurs
ABDOMEN: soft, Tender to palpation mildly in epigastric/RUQ
region, right lateral abdominal wall hernia; non
tender/reducible
Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or
edema
Skin: No jaundice, no spider angiomata


Pertinent Results:
CT Abdomen
1. Extensively infiltrating mass in the region of the porta
hepatis, with
vascular encasement, may be of pancreatic origin or represent an
extrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma, as previously suggested.
2. Thrombus within the portal vein as well as encasement and
occlusion of the
splenic vein/SMV confluence.
3. Multiple hypodense liver lesions, unchanged.
4. Multiple lymph nodes within the mesentery and along the
portocaval,
celiac, and superior mesenteric regions.
5. Right lateral abdominal wall hernia containing nonobstructed
loops of
bowel.
6. Interval increase in small amount of free fluid within the
paracolic
gutters and the perihepatic space.
7. Interval increase in small bilateral pleural effusions.
8. Extensive varices, unchanged.

Pathology:
[**2-22**] duodenal biopsy:
Duodenum, biopsy:
Duodenal mucosa with chronic and active inflammation.
[**2-22**] porta hepatis mass:
 ATYPICAL.
A few groups of atypical glandular cells, can not exclude
  dysplasia.
[**2-25**]: ascitic fluid, perigastric area
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
  Mesothelial cells, histiocytes, scant lymphocytes, and
  benign-appearing squamous cells.
[**2-25**] celiac node FNA by EUS
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
  Scattered small mature lymphocytes; no definite evidence of
  lymph node sampling.
  A few groups of glandular epithelial cells and
  benign-appearing squamous cells, consistent with
  gastrointestinal contamination.
.
EGD [**2-18**]:
Esophagitis
Blood in the stomach
Duodenal ulcer
Duodenal stenosis
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum
.
EGD/EUS [**2-22**]:
Circumferential non-bleeding mass of malignant appearance was
found at the distal bulb, D1/D2 junction.
The mass caused a partial obstruction.
Appearances suggestive of extrinsic infiltrating malignant
process.
Relatively easy passage of scope raises possibilty of
paraneoplastic Gastroparesis as main cause of nausea as opposed
to mechanical obstruction
EUS examination

Normal diameter pancreatic duct seen in grossly abnormal
pancreatic parenchyma
Hypoechoic septated parenchyma seen from stomach.
Unable to pass obstruction with EUS probe, no clear view of
pancreatic head.
5x5 cm lesion noted from duodenal bulb extending towards porta
hepatis
Heterogenous appearance with areas suggestive of necrosis,
malignant phenotype.
Unable to identify CBD.
Portal vein clearly seen, flow absent.
Flow seen in distal SMV.
Complete replacement of portal confluence by mass noted.
Multiple pathological perigastric nodes noted.
Periduodenal, perigastric ascites noted.
Coeliac axis examined carefully, there was no lymphadenopathy
Cytology samples were obtained
Cold forceps biopsies were taken from involved mucosa at the
level of the infiltrating duodenal mass.

Brief Hospital Course:
65 yo man admitted with UGIB, found to have gastric outlet
obstruction due to portahepatis mass, awaiting EUS for
diagnosis.

# Upper GI bleed, with duodenal ulcer, and acute blood loss
anemia: Patient presented with large volume black emesis now
draining >5L.  He was admitted to the ICU and an EGD on arrival
to ICU: showed ulcer in duodenal bulb, evidence of Gastric
outlet obstruction with concern for mass going into the lumen.
He was transfused 2U prbcs. He subsequently underwent a CT
Abdomen which showed a hypodense mass in the region of the porta
hepatis which remained hypodense suggestive of
cholangiocarcinoma.  He was started on protonix IV and
sucralfate, and had stable Hct after transfusion.
.
# Portahepatis Mass: He was found to have a porta hepatis mass.
ERCP was consulted for evaluation, and he underwent EUS for
diagnostic purposes twice, with no clear diagnosis yet obtained.
 He is now awaiting repeat EUS.  He was also seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
of hepatobiliary surgery, who knows Mr. [**Known lastname 1557**] from his prior
surgery.  His final recommendations are awaiting results of
biopsy, but if the mass is found to be malignant, as expected,
it would be unresectable. CEA and AFP were negative.  CA [**27**]-9
was 343 (high).  Biopsy with atypical cells, too few to
characterize.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] agreed that next step
should be gastrojejunostomy and biopsy.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and his
service took over care and he underwent Extensive lysis of
adhesions, and gastrojejunostomy on [**2118-3-15**]. He tolerated the
procedure and was kept NPO with the NG
