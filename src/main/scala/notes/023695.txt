ADDENDUM:  This is an Addendum to the Discharge Summary
dictated on [**2150-1-5**].

Subjectively, since that time, the patient has remained the
same subjectively.  She continues to be nonresponsive; only
opening eyes spontaneously.  Her issues are as follows:

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

 1.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient is currently
being treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin through [**2150-1-18**] for a positive line tip growing out gram-negative
rods which were not pseudomonal and not fermenting.

Of note, the patient is colonized with yeast in her urine;
although, she does have a negative urinalysis.  She did
receive five days of oral fluconazole with no clearing of the
yeast.  Due to the fact that the patient was afebrile, with
no signs of sepsis, and a stable white blood cell count, she
was not treated.

 2.  NEUROLOGIC ISSUES:  The patient has had no seizure
activity on continuous electroencephalogram monitoring.  She
is on valproic acid, Keppra, and phenobarbital.  These doses
should be staggered and not given all at once because her
blood pressure does fall when they are administered
altogether.

 3.  CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  The patient has a decreased
ejection fraction with a repeat echocardiogram showing an
ejection fraction of 20% to 30%.  She was originally on 75 mg
p.o. captopril t.i.d.; however, her blood pressure has been
falling into the systolic range of 85 to 95 after admission.
She has been tapered down to 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. and may need
to be titrated down to 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.

There is no clear etiology for cardiomyopathy.  It is thought
that it is either chemotherapy versus cardiac/coronary artery
disease in nature.  The patient will need a repeat
echocardiogram in [**2150-4-9**].

 4.  PULMONARY SYSTEM:  This is day eighteen of the
ventilator for the patient.  She is day three of
tracheostomy.

 5.  ENDOCRINE SYSTEM:  The patient is on a regular insulin
sliding-scale for her diabetes.

 6.  HEMATOLOGIC ISSUES:  The patient has a history a
hematocrit that has been going up and down requiring
transfusions approximately every seven to ten days.  The
patient's hemolysis laboratories are normal.  Her stool is
guaiac-negative.  A potential source may be in her lungs, as
we periodically suction blood clots.  [**Month (only) 116**] have been an
irritation of the endotracheal tube.  The most recent drop
may have been the tracheostomy procedure.

 7.  RENAL SYSTEM:  Stable.

 8.  DERMATOLOGIC ISSUES:  The patient with decubitus ulcers
on her feet and calves.  She has been getting wet-to-dry
dressing changes once per day.  She was to receive 14 days of
zinc and continuous vitamin C.

 9.  GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM:  The patient with a
gastrojejunostomy tube in place.  Continued gastrojejunostomy
tube.  Elevated alkaline phosphatase has been stable.  We
have been checking that once per week.  No clear etiology.
Stool output has decreased with a change in tube feeds.

10.  LINES:  The patient with a Port-A-Cath in place.

11.  PROPHYLAXIS:  The patient is on a proton pump inhibitor
and pneumatic boots.

12.  CODE STATUS:  The patient is do not resuscitate, but we
will continue her on the ventilator.

13.  COMMUNICATION ISSUES:  The patient's son [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (NI) **])
is the main contact.  It has been stated that he his health
care proxy; however, this is not a form that was signed by
the patient before her decline.  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known lastname **] is basically
the designated speaker for the family.  He can be difficult
to get hold of.  I did fill out paperwork for him to be able
to be excused from work with the Family With Disability Act.

14.  DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient has been accepted at
[**Hospital **] Rehabilitation Center.  We are waiting for
confirmation from Mr. [**Known lastname **] before her discharge.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  (Discharge medications included)
 1.  Ciprofloxacin 400 intravenously q.12h. (through [**1-18**]).
 2.  Tylenol 325 mg to 650 mg p.o. q.4-6h. as needed.
 3.  Captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. (hold for a systolic blood
pressure of less than 90).
 4.  Zinc sulfate 220 mg p.o. q.d. (through [**2150-1-23**]).
 5.  Valproic acid 1500 mg p.o. q.8h.
 6.  A regular insulin sliding-scale.
 7.  Phenobarbital 30 mg p.o. t.i.d.
 8.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
 9.  Levetiracetam 1000 mg p.o. b.i.d. (Keppra).

DISCHARGE PROGNOSIS:  Poor.
