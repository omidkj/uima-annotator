Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfered from OSH in ARF s/p TIPS

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
61 yo M with HCV cirrhosis complicated by variceal bleeding,
refractory acites and edema who was admitted to OSH on [**2138-6-5**]
for TIPS procedure which was complicated by intraperitoneal
bleeding after hepatic puncture requiring transfusion of 3 units
PRBC.  During the procedure systolic BP reached a low of 90 and
pt recieved iodinated contrast.  Subsequent to the placement of
the TIPS pt's creatinine bumped from a basline of 1.4 to
1.8->2.1->2.7, and the pt was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for management
of acute renal failure.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 70384**] had a prolonged, complicated hospital stay, with
several transfers to the ICU for decompensated hepatic failure
due to HCV (MELD=40), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and
multifactorial renal failure (hepato-renal syndrome). As I only
took care of him during his final ICU stay, I will attempt to
briefly summarize the events that happened earlier in his
course.

He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after TIPS for variceal bleeding at
an outside hospital. His HCV cirrhosis was associated with
coagulopathy, mild ascites, thrombocytopenia, and
encephalopathy. He also had renal failure, likely a combination
of contrast-induced nephropathy and ATN, and a retroperitoneal
hematoma that occured as a complication of TIPS. He suffered
from respiratory distress from volume overload, which responded
to non invasive ventilation. He was additionally noted to have
candiduria. He initially improved somewhat with supportive
management of HCV cirrhosis, hemodialysis as needed, and
expectant management of the hematoma. He received fluconazole
for candiduria.

On [**6-25**], he developed fever, respiratory distress and decreased
sensorium, for which he was transferred to the ICU. He was
treated for SBP with broad spectrum antibiotics and his
respiratory distress again improved with noninvasive ventilation
and ultrafiltration for volume management. His mental status
improved somewhat, although not back to baseline, and he was
transferred to the transplant service [**Hospital1 **], where his overall
status remained tenuous, with marginal blood pressures,
leukocytosis despite antibiotics for SBP, and waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**]
delirium.

On [**7-3**], he became hypotensive and obtunded. He was transferred
to the ICU again. Antibiotics were broadened for presumed
sepsis, possibly from aspiration pneumonia or recurrence of SBP.
Noninvasive ventilation was inadequate to maintain oxygenation
and patient's encephalopathy was so severe that he could not
protect his airway; he was therefore intubated for ventilatory
support. Invasive hemodynamic monitoring, ie, pulmonary catheter
placement was discussed with the family, but since he was septic
from an unclear source, liver transplantation would not be an
option and his family decided to withdraw invasive measures and
focus on comfort measures. He subsequently expired.
