HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 79 year old
male who came from an outside hospital status post three
bloody stools.  He was orthostatic with a hematocrit of 22.8.
During his stay at the outside hospital, he was given a total
of 20 units of packed red blood cells, 16 units of platelets
and 10 mg of vitamin K and four bags of fresh frozen plasma
to correct his INR.  He was also on Coumadin.  Nasogastric
lavage did not have any coffee-grounds in it.  He was scoped
and had small polyps that were not bleeding.  A red tag scan
was negative and a repeat scan after melanotic stool showed
uptake throughout his entire colon.  He was scoped the next
day, which showed a friable cecum without bleeding.  He was
transferred to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for
angiography.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Zantac, NPH, Actose, Coumadin,
Altace, Lasix, folate, pyridoxine, iron sulfate and
multivitamins.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination on transfer to
the medical team from the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the
patient had a temperature of 97.8, pulse 81, blood pressure
135/56 and oxygen saturation 99% in room air.  General:
Pleasant male in no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose
and throat:  Anicteric sclerae, oropharynx clear, moist
mucous membranes.  Neck:  No jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs.  Lungs:
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities: No peripheral
edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  Upon transfer, white blood cell count was
2.1, hemoglobin 11.1, hematocrit 32.4, platelet count 72,000,
sodium 136, potassium 4.2, chloride 111, bicarbonate 16, BUN
20, creatinine 1, platelet count 212,000, prothrombin time
14.6, partial thromboplastin time 35.5 and INR 1.4.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient was
transferred from the outside hospital for possible
angiography.  He was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit for close observation.  There was no evidence of further
bleeding since his arrival here, with a stable hematocrit and
no melena.  Therefore, angiography was not performed.  A
repeat tagged red blood cell scan, to look for a fistula, was
negative.

The patient was transferred to the medicine service and,
again, his hematocrit remained stable.  He was able to
tolerate oral intake and was discharged to follow up for a
repeat colonoscopy in six to eight weeks.  Coumadin,
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and aspirin were
discontinued and he was to await further instructions from
his gastroenterology doctor as an outpatient concerning these
medications.

2.  Cardiovascular:  The patient remained stable.

3.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient was able
to tolerate oral intake and his diet was eventually advanced
to a diabetic diet without difficulty.
