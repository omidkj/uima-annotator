Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1481**]
Chief Complaint:
sepsis, pericardial effusion, esophageal cancer

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2132-2-20**] pericardial window

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 17132**] is a 50M with a history of locally invasive esophageal
cancer (T3, N1) py who was scheduled for an esophagectomy [**2-22**]
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who presented to [**Hospital3 20284**] Center [**2132-2-15**]
with fatigue, cough, and vomiting. He was found to be
hypotensive with a leukocytosis. He was put on sepsis protocol,
resuscitated and started on broad-spectrum antibiotics
(Vanc/Zosyn). During his hospitalization, he developed acute
renal failure, atrial fibrillation, became acidotic and
hemodynamically unstable. He was intubated and started on
pressors. A TTE was performed with the discovery of pericardial
effusion. He was taken to the cath lab semi-urgently for a
pericardiocentesis and right heart cath. Approximately 600cc of
viscous green-yellow fluid was removed. Initial gram stain of
this fluid revealed no organisms but cell count was >20,000 with
98% neutrophils. His hemodynamics improved s/p
pericardiocentesis. He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.


Past Medical History:
PMH: esophageal cancer s/p chemo (cisplatin/5FU), paroxysmal
AFib with CHADS score of 0 treated with ASA only

PSH: portacath & lap Jtube [**11-4**]


Social History:
The patient has a history of drinking alcohol in the past, but
quit two years
ago.  He has smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for many
years.  He works as a handyman and machinist.

Family History:
There is no family history of carcinoma.

Imaging
[**2132-2-19**] TTE: Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2132-2-17**], the effusion is larger. The severity of
tricuspid regurgitation has increased.
.
[**2132-2-18**] CT chest: 1. Sufficient opacification of the esophagus.
No evidence of esophageo-pericardial fistula. 2.Multifocal PNA.
3. Large bilateral pleural effusions. 4. Large ascites. 5. Small
pericardial effusion. 6. Limited assessment without IV contrast
to assess abscess.
.
[**2132-2-18**] Abd US: 1. No hydronephrosis. Diffusely echogenic
kidneys bilaterally, suggestive of medical renal disease. 2.
Small to moderate ascites, largest pocket in the RLQ. 3.
Bilateral pleural effusions and a pericardial effusion. 4.
Rounded echogenic foci in the porta [**Last Name (LF) 84553**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] reflect normal
fat within the porta [**First Name3 (LF) 84553**]. However, as these appear fairly
discrete and rounded, lymphadenopathy cannot be excluded. If
clinically indicated, this can be evaulated by cross-sectional
imaging.
.
[**2132-2-18**] ECHO: Small circumferential pericardial effusion without
evidence for tamponade physiology. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%)

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 50M w/ esophageal cancer, with a purulent pericardial
effusion and pericardial tamponade, sepsis, and acute renal
failure, who transfered from an OSH hospital for additional
management. The patient was admitted to the SICU for aggressive
resuscitation with IV fluids, blood products and pressors.  He
was additionally treated with broad spectrum antibiotics
(vanco/zosyn/micafungin). He had an arterial line and [**Last Name (un) 18821**]
monitoring initiaited to monitor his hemodynamics and a CVL
placed to provide additional access reuscitation.  Repeat TTE
after admission showed small circumferential pericardial
effusion without evidence for tamponade. ID was consulted to
provide antibiotic recommedations. Blood and urine cultures were
sent. Thoracics was consulted to help evaluate whether there was
a communication between the esophagus and pericardium and to
perform either pigtail placement or a pericardial window for
drainage of the pericardium--a pericardial window was
ultimatedly placed. Imaging studies failed to reveal any
abnormal connection between the esophagus and the pericardium,
so the source of the pericardial infection remained unclear
(possibly hematogenous spread from a pneumonia).

Despite aggressive resuscitation as described above and
successful weaning of IV pressor support, the patient's renal
failure failed to improve and urine output dropped of
preciptitously. Renal was consulted to initiate hemodialysis;
however, the patient's family and HCP ultimately decided that
this was not in-keeping with the patient's wishes; he was made
CMO and placed on minimal vent settings and a fentanyl drip. The
final cause of death was from respiratory failure at 1715pm on
[**2132-2-23**]. The family did request a complete autopsy to shed
additional light on his death.
