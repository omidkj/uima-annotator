Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**]
Chief Complaint:
C.diff colitis


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
67-year-old female with history of schizoaffective disorder and
C.diff colitis [**11/2113**]/[**2113**] with recurrent diarrhea and
abdominal distention.  Pt initially presented to [**Hospital **]
[**Hospital 1459**] Hospital on [**2114-6-7**] with diarrhea, abdominal
distention, low grade fever and lethargy.  Labs revealed WBC
40.5K which peaked at 47K and acute renal failure with Cr 3.9
from baseline normal.  C.diff toxin PCR was positive and
noncontrast CT abdomen showed mild inflammatory changes around
descending and sigmoid colon as well as concern for ileus.  She
was started on IV flagyl and both po and pr vancomycin.  She
continued to have worsening abdominal distention and diarrhea
and repeat CT on [**2114-6-10**] showed increased thickening of bowel
wall of descending colon.  Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
surgical consultation for possible colectomy.  Of note, she also
received IVIG x 1 at OSH and TPN at OSH.
.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], she was admitted to trauma ICU where she
was continued on IV flagyl and po/pr vancomycin with improvement
in WBC to 18K and Cr to 1.2.  No repeat imaging was pursued but
as pt did not appear toxic and abdominal exam was benign, she
was not deemed surgical candidate.  She did receive ativan
yesterday for agitation.  She is intermittently alert but
somnolent at other times.  She has bowel movements only with
vancomycin enemas.
.
Review of systems:
Unable to attain due to pt's somnolence and unwillingness to
cooperate.

[**2114-6-21**]  URINE CULTURE (Pending):

Imaging:
Portable abdomen [**2114-6-14**]:
FINDINGS: Air and stool is seen filling the small and large
bowel with mild dilatation of the splenic flexure to 9.3 cm. The
remainder of the transverse colon is not dilated. Limited view
of the lung base is unremarkable. There is a curvilinear density
projecting over the epigastrium which could reflect surgical
drain or external structure. Correlation with examination is
recommended.

IMPRESSION: Mild splenic flexure distention of uncertain
significance.
Interval followup is recommended.

Portable abdomen [**2114-6-15**]:
FINDINGS: There is mild gaseous distention of the small bowel to
a maximum of 3.7 cm. There is air seen in the colon with
resolution of the splenic flexure dilatation and no evidence of
toxic megacolon. Imaged portion of the lung bases is clear,
though somewhat obscured by motion. Dynamic compression screw
with a gamma nail is seen fixating a left femoral neck fracture.


IMPRESSION: Likely ileus without evidence of colonic dilatation.


Portable chest x-ray [**2114-6-16**]:
FINDINGS: The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable. There
is a nasogastric tube whose tip and side were not below the
gastroesophageal junction. No signs for pulmonary edema, focal
consolidation, or pleural effusions.

Chest (PA & LAT) [**2114-6-16**]:
FINDINGS: Comparison is made to the prior study performed five
hours earlier.

The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. On the lateral view, there
is suggestion of small bilateral pleural effusions. There is
mild prominence of pulmonary interstitial markings without overt
pulmonary edema or focal consolidation.  No pneumothoraces are
seen.

Portable abdomen [**2114-6-18**]:
FINDINGS: A nasogastric tube is seen with distal tip projecting
over the antrum of the stomach. Imaged portions of the lungs are
relatively unremarkable. Compared to the prior from [**6-15**], there
appears to be decreased small bowel dilatation with air now seen
filling the colon with slight dilatation of the splenic flexure
and descending colon up to 8.7cm. No free intraperitoneal air is
seen.

IMPRESSION: Decreased small bowel dilatation with air now seen
progressing to the colon which is slightly dilated up to 8.7 cm
at the splenic flexure.

Portable chest [**2114-6-19**]:
FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with
patient in sitting semi-upright position. Analysis is performed
in direct comparison with the next preceding PA and lateral
chest examination of [**2114-4-16**].  Relatively high positioned
diaphragms indicate poor inspirational effort or reduced
compliance of pulmonary tissue. Ther
