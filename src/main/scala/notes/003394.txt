Allergies:
Celebrex

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
Right sided weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Required a G-tube([**6-15**]) and Intubation for respiratory distress
([**6-17**])

History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 8147**] is a 71yo R handed man with hx of severe OSA on CPAP,
OA who
was found down per roommate 10pm [**6-5**] and brought to outside
hospital where he was found to have R MCA stroke.

Per family/roommate, pt has been complaining of fatigue for
several days including the day of admission - pt took an
afternoon nap and was found to be in his usual state at 6pm.
Then around 9pm, pt was noted to have difficulty using his L leg
and getting up but it was assumed to be secondary to his chronic
L knee pain (s/p knee replacement).  At 10pm - about an hour
later, pt was found down on the floor per roommate with no
movements in L leg plus slurred speech and L facial droop.  EMS
was called and pt was trasported to outside hospital where he
was
given ASA 325mg  in the ED but no lytics given that pt arrived
in
ED outside the 3hr window for tPA.  Pt's initial vitals per EMS
was 154/80 for BP and HR 58~60.  Then while in ED, SBP ranged
from 154~189 with DBP 73~86.  Pt remained afebriel.

Pt had CT scans which showed hypodensity in the R
perieto-occipital lobes with no evidence of hemorrhage and R
dense MCA sign.  MRI and MRA were also done which showed large
defects involving both R frontal, temporal, parietal and
parieto-occipital lobes with no evidence of hemorrhagic
transformation.  FLAIR showed mild evidence of mass effect on R
lateral ventricle but all ventricles were patent.  MRA showed
absent beginning of R ICA at the petrous portion and absence of
distal flow of R MCA.

On Neurology service, the patient had a RIGHT hemiplegia.  With
bulbar dysfunction, he underwent PEG [**2116-6-15**].  He continued to
use nightly CPAP at outpatient pressures.

2. Asthma
3. GERD
4. BPH
5. s/p L knee repair and replacement
6. s/p ventral hernia repair

8. s/p L elbow surgery


Social History:

full-time maintenance person at [**Hospital1 11485**] School in [**Location (un) 2624**].  Has
three children and sevral grandchildren.

Neurological Examination:

touch on his face
Motor-R UE and LE [**4-6**] w/ normal tone.  L UE 0/5, L LE [**12-7**] w/ nox
stim only. Sensation difficult to assess on the arms and legs,
but appears to be in tact throughout.
Reflexes-(no change from previous note) L/R bic [**2-2**], tri [**1-4**],
pat

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt admitted from OSH with large R MCA stroke, treated only with
aspirin.  Was monitored on the neurology floor and began
physical therapy.  He continued his nighttime home CPAP regimen
of 18/6.  Was not changed from his home settings while in the
hospital.
.
MRI/MRA showed large defects in R frontal, temporal and parietal
with no evidence of hemorrhagic transformation.  No flow in
dital R MCA.  Had no midline shift and no hydrocephalus.
.
Pt failed a speech and swallow study and had a GJ tube placed.
It was initially hard to thread the tube into the jejunum, so it
had to be revised.  The patient now was a G tube and J tube.
The G tube was clogged while in the SICU, and there was concern
for ileus, but with motility agents, the residual volume
decreased and the patient started having bowel movements.
.
Was being treated on the floor for significant Left hemiplegia
with bulbar dysfunction.  Had PEG placement on [**2116-6-15**], and was
using CPAP as he had been doing at home.  Overnight the
[**Date range (1) 21036**] pt was noted to have O2 sat in 70s with tachypnea.
Sats increased with stimulation.  ABG showed mile hypercarbia
(48).  WBC 15.8 and CXR showed worsening atelectasis.  CE normal
x1.  Intubated that night in the SICU for increased work up
breathing likely secondary to aspiration pneumonitis.
.
The patient was then found to have bilateral PE on CT of chest.
Heparin therapy was initiated and 3 days before discharge,
coumadin therapy with started with 5 mg.  His INR is
subtherapeutic now.  We recommend increasing his coumadin to 7.5
mg (he is likely having interaction with his antibiotics,
especially the erythromycin he was on for motility).  Continue
to monitor INR and when therapeutic over 2.0, can take off
heparin drip.
.
Pt also developed what was thought to be ventilator acquired
pneumonia.  Was treated with one day of vanco and a course of
zosyn.  He was 2 days remaining of his 8 day zosyn course.  He
is clinically improving and maintaining high saturations on
between 2-3 L NC.  His leukocytosis is resolving.
.
Pt was extubated on [**6-23**] in the SICU.  Pt did well overnight.
Can talk in short sentences.  Continues to have L sided neglect
and L hemiplegia.  Follows commands.  Obviously snores loudly
even when just resting.
.
Pt is discharge with a central line still in place for the
heparin drip.  He has difficult access, so we felt central line
was appropriate and the rehab facility could decide if a PIV
would work.  Pt also has working GJ tube in place and has a tube
feed regimen that has been reevaluated by nutrition today.  He
is in stable condition and his ongoing medical issues now just
include completing a course of zosyn for the next two days, and
reaching a therapeutic INR and removing the heparin drip.
.
Physical therapy should be started for his stroke deficits.  He
should have repeat speech and swallow evaluation in one to two
weeks to determine if he can start taking food and medicines PO.
