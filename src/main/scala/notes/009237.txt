Brief Hospital Course:
On admission, an ABD CT was unchanged in appearance of the
heterogeneous hematoma surrounding the superiorly located
pigtail catheter with perinephric fluid and free fluid in deep
pelvis. The fluid collection surrounding the inferiorly located
catheter was unchanged. There was no intraperitoneal hemorrhage
or other finding to account for the profound anemia. A
transplant u/s revealed a perinephric fluid collection as seen
on prior CT scan. Mild hydronephrosis of the transplanted
kidney, increased since [**2188-12-8**].  Vascularity to the
transplanted kidney had appropriate waveforms. A CXR revealed
cardiomegaly, increased edema and L effusion. A cline was
inserted and she received 2 PRBCs. GI was consulted for concern
for GI bleed. PPI was increased. EGD was performed after DDAVP
and plt transfusion. Red and clotted blood was seen in the
stomach. An erosion or ulcer was found in the stomach antrum
partially obscured by edematous folds. Epi and electrocautery
were successful in obtaining hemostasis.
IV Vanco and Zosyn were started. Blood cultures from [**12-23**] were
negative. The JP fluid had 4+ PMN with STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE
NEGATIVE. MODERATE GROWTH.
PROBABLE ENTEROCOCCUS.  MODERATE GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2188-12-28**]):    NO ANAEROBES ISOLATED.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Final [**2189-1-6**]): [**Female First Name (un) **] ALBICANS. SPARSE
GROWTH.
ID was consulted and recommendations included starting flu for
thrush, dap to for re, po vanco for c.diff and discontinuation
of IV vanco. These recs were followed. Stool was negative for
c.diff and other pathogens. She continued to have melena.
Creat was elevated from baseline of 1.7 up to 2.3. Nephrology
was consulted. Elevated creatinine was felt to be due to ATN and
decreased intravascular volume. She received IV Lasix for volume
overload which exacerbated her respiratory status. A Bx was
deferred until [**1-7**]. This showed mild interstitial fibrosis and
tubular atrophy. Mild chronic inflammation accompanied the
scarring. No endothelialitis was noted. C4d stain was negative.
Diagnostic Category: Thrombotic microangiopathy. Urine output
continued to be ~ 700cc/day. Creatinine increased and
hemodialysis was initiated during the week of [**1-18**]. Urology had
been consulted for cytoscopy with stent placement for
hydronephrosis of L kidney. A MR urogram was recommended to
trace transplant ureter to r/o obstruction and help with stent
placement. This showed  diffusely narrow appearance of the
distal 4 cm of the ureter, without focal stricture. No
hydronephrosis. Patent arterial supply and venous drainage of
the renal transplant
     Cardiology was consulted for sob and pulmonary edema. An
echo demonstrated mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
systolic function (LVEF>55%), [**1-6**]+ MR and a small pericardial
effusion. Recs included more aggressive diuresis and decreasing
BB dose. ON [**12-25**], she became very dyspneic requiring NRB O2
transfer to SICU. She was intubate and diuresed . A repeat echo
was done without change.  A chest CT was done to eval
infiltrates. Diffuse ground glass opacities with septal
thickening and bibasilar consolidation were noted. These
findings were most consistent with atypical viral or mycoplasma
infection given the widespread distribution, but a component of
hydrostatic pulmonary edema was also likely, and interstitial
pneumonitis related to lupus, as well as pulmonary hemorrhage
was suggested. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions were noted.
IV Caspo was started on [**12-25**] for expanded coverage for fever.
ID recs included Bronch. Dapto was changed to vanco and levo was
added. A bronchoscopy with lavage was done on [**12-27**]. Cultures
were negative.Dapto was stopped and ampicillin was started.
     She continued to require plt and prbc transfusions for plt
counts in 41-51. Hematology was consulted. A peripheral smear
showed mild-moderate schistos. TTP was not felt to be the cause
of low plt. DIC was also not felt to be a diagnosis as
fibrinogen and coags were ok. An antiplt antibody was done to
r/o ITP.This result was found to be positive as of [**2189-1-9**]. It
was felt that she had ITP, thrombotic microangiopathy and AIHA.
Recommendations included increasing steroids, but this was not
done due to h/o AVN of hips and Gastric ulcer.  She continued to
receive prbc and plt for hcts in 25 range and plts in 30 range.
A repeat HIT was negative. Epogen was started for anemia.
Respiratory status improved with diuresis and empiric
antibiotics.  she was extubated on [**12-29**].
     On [**1-1**] hct decreased to 19.7 and plt 51 for which she was
transfused. She c/o distention and abd pain.  A repeat abd ct
showed slight decrease in size of previously noted hyperdense
peri-transplant fluid collection consistent with hematoma with
larger decrease in size of more inferior medially located simple
fluid collection when compared to [**12-23**]. Bilateral increase in
previously noted pleural effusions with new patchy airspace
consolidation most marked in the left lower lobe, consistent
with underlying pneumonia. Stable appearance to mild fullness of
the transplant kidney collecting system with no frank
hydronephrosis identified.
Myfortic and [**Last Name (un) **] were stopped given septic appearance and [**Last Name (un) 500**]
marrow suppression. Prednisone continued. There was concern for
infiltrates secondary to rapamune.  On [**1-4**], flagyl was added
for fever and persistent diarrhea which was c.diff neg.
     She experienced hemolysis and had a +DAT. There was concern
that rapamune could cause TMS. This was stopped on [**2189-1-9**].
Pheresis with IVIG was started for thrombocytopenia and
hemolysis. Pheresis was done x 6 sessions without much
improvement of plt. LDH decreased somewhat. There was no
evidence of TTP. HUS was considered given bx. On [**2189-1-8**],  a rpt
EGD was done for decreased hct. An ulcer in the pre-pyloric
region was noted. There were multiple oozing areas in the antrum
of the stomach and a site of active oozing of blood in the
duodenal bulb.Cautery was performed. DDAVP was given.  She
required intermittent plt/prbc transfusions.
     She continued to intermittent fevers while on antbx.
Respiratory status slowly improved. On [**1-11**] urine was + for
>100,000 yeast. She continued on IV Caspo. On [**1-12**] a rect
