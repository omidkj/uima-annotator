History of Present Illness:
58 y/o female with h/o ESRD on HD, s/p renal tx in [**2173**] with
acute on chronic rejection in [**2193-1-20**], initially presenting
with a 4-5 days episode of severe frontal headaches, N/V/D and
decreased appetite. Pt reports symptoms started on [**5-18**] after
she had received dialysis that day. She missed her HD 2 days
prior to admission due to severe HA and malaise. Pt denies
having had changes in vision, numbness or weaknesses, syncopes,
SOB, CP, anuria or edema during that time.
During her next HD session on [**5-23**] it was noted that pt had SBP
>200-250 patient was also c/o headache and sent to ED for HTN
management. Pt was admitted to the ED for severe hypertensive
crisis, given captopril, labetolol 20mg, 40mgx2, 80mg then
started on nitro and labetolol gtt. She also received dilaudid
for her HA and she was transferred to the MICU for hypertensive
urgency and fevers (102).
.
MICU	
She had two seizures on [**5-24**] in the early morning hours, most
likely due to hypertensive leucoencephalopathy. The first
tonic-clonic convulsion (at 4AM, lasting for about 3min) was
witnessed, a respiratory code was called but the intubation
failed (esophagus). At 6AM the pt awoke, was disoriented,
agitated and started screaming. Shortly after she suffered from
a second seizure which stopped after Lorazepam 2mg iv, pt was
then successfully intubated and entered brief post-ictal coma
(with intact brain stem reflexes).
Pt was transferred to the floor 48 hours later for
optimalization of her BP.

Past Medical History:
#S/p renal transplant in [**2173**], acute on chronic rejection in
[**1-25**], now ESRD on HD.
.
#IgA nephropathy in [**2169**], 7-8months HD prior to transplant
.
#HTN
.
#Depression
.
#s/p rheumatic fever in childhood

Social History:
Lives alone with cats. No family in the area. Denies
tob/EtOH/IVDU/substances. Works part-time as asst. coffee shop
manager. Unable to obtain health insurance for past year, which
has limited her access to f/u medical care for her transplant.

Many aunts/uncles with Ca.
Sister with breast Ca, survived.
No family hx renal problems.

CT Head [**5-24**]:
IMPRESSION: Unchanged appearance of CT compared with the prior
examination obtained earlier on the same day. No hemorrhage is
seen. Hypodensities are again noted in the white matter
bilaterally. If hypertensive encephalopathy is clinically
suspected, MRI would be helpful for further assessment.
.
EEG [**5-25**]:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the presence
of
intermittent right central parietal and left temporal and
central sharp
transients. This finding appears to be independent and more
frequent
over the right side. Additionally, there are prolonged bursts of

generalized slowing, bifrontally predominant and slow and
disorganized
background rhythm. This abnormality suggests cortical
dysfunction over
the right central parietal region and possible left central and
temporal
region. The bursts of the generalized slowing and the background

slowing suggests a deep, midline subcortical dysfunction and are

consistent with an encephalopathy. There was no seizure activity

recorded.
.
Echo [**5-28**]:
Conclusions:
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a small pericardial
effusion.
.
MRI abdomen:
FINDINGS: Both native kidneys are markedly atrophic. Single
renal arteries are identified
