Chief Complaint:
Dizziness, palpitations, defibrillator firing

Endocardial ablation
Epicardial ablation

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 99580**] is a 73 year old gentleman with a past medical
history significant for rheumatic heart disease c/b
bioprosthetic AVR, CHF with a LVEF 20%, VF with AICD/BiV, PAF on
coumadin, and a recent admission for symptomatic VT complicated
by GAS baceteremia treated with CTX now admitted for VT. The
patietn was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 99583**], during which
he had a negative TEE and ICD pocket ultrasound with plan for 6
weeks of antibiotics ending on [**7-26**]. Between [**Date range (1) 7501**], he was
noted to have several episodes of VT treated either with ATP or
defibrillation, during which he was admitted to an OSH. He has
been followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient, and on [**7-6**] his
ATP was increased. Today, the patient reports that he was at
[**Hospital1 18**] for an ID appointment when he had an episode of
palpitations and lightheadedness with possible syncope for which
he presented to the ED.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS 97.9 72 115/56 18 100%RA. EP was
consulted, and interrogation of the AICD demonstrated 4 episodes
of VT today treated with ATP. The patient was then admitted for
further management.

[**2169-7-14**] CXR: FINDINGS: Single AP upright portable view of the
chest was obtained. The costophrenic angle is not fully included
on the image. Given this, left-sided AICD is again seen, grossly
unchanged in position. Patient is status post median sternotomy.
No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion, or evidence of
pneumothorax is seen. There is no overt pulmonary edema. There
has been interval placement of a right-sided PICC line, distal
aspect not well seen due to overlying pacer leads but appears to
extend at least into the SVC.
.
[**2169-7-15**] CXR:
There is a right-sided PICC line with distal lead tip in the
distal SVC.
There is a left-sided dual-lead pacemaker as well as several old
pacemaker wires. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged. Tortuous
thoracic aorta. There is some increased density at the lung
bases, degenerative change of the lower lumbar spine is also
identified.
.
[**2169-7-15**] Left hip X-ray:
FINDINGS: There are no signs for acute fractures or
dislocations. There are degenerative changes of bilateral hip
joints with spurring of the
superolateral acetabuli. Degenerative changes of the lower
lumbar spine is also identified. No focal lytic or blastic
lesions are present.
.
[**2169-7-17**] CXR:

FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. The pacemaker
and central venous access line is in unchanged position. No
pulmonary edema. No pleural effusions, no pneumonia. Moderate
tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
.
[**2169-7-20**] Echo:
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 25-30 %). A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is
present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with
inferior and inferolateral akinesis. Bioprosthetic AVR. No
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2169-6-15**],
the current study is a limited study assessing possible
pericardial effusion. The findings are similar.
.
[**2169-7-20**] CXR:

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**7-17**], there is
continued
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with some increased
indistinctness of pulmonary vessels suggesting mild elevation of
pulmonary venous pressure. The monitoring and support devices
are unchanged.
.
[**2169-7-21**] Echo:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with moderate cavity dilation.
There is severe regional systolic dysfunction with severe
hyopkinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls and mild
hypokinesis of the anterolateral wall. The remaining segments
contract normally (LVEF = 25-30 %). No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic root is severely dilated at the sinus level. A
bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic
valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet motion
and transvalvular gradients. A paravalvular jet of mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.
