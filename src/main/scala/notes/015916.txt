HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 54-year-old woman with
a history of left circumflex stent for 100% stenosis in
[**2108-2-23**] with an in-stent restenosis in [**2108-4-22**]
with a restent and percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty to ostial circumflex, congestive heart failure,
type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and
medication noncompliance who was admitted on [**9-27**] with
progressive dyspnea, cough, chest pain, and her anginal
equivalent of back pain of one month duration.  She has also
had one week of yellow sputum and increased orthopnea.

Three days prior to admission she went to the Emergency Room
for shortness of breath and was diagnosed with bronchitis and
started on azithromycin and sent home.

On [**9-27**], the patient went to [**Hospital1 190**] Emergency Room secondary to her anginal
equivalent of squeezing back pain and was admitted to the
C-MED Service.  Her electrocardiogram was unchanged on
admission.

On [**9-28**] she underwent cardiac catheterization with a
finding of a totally occluded left circumflex which received
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and treated
with brachytherapy.  Her right heart catheter showed
increased filling pressures, marked pulmonary hypertension,
and systemic hypertension were also found.  She was treated
with Nipride drip which was then weaned off, and she was
started on a nitroglycerin drip, given one dose of
Lasix 40 mg intravenously, and Lopressor 10 mg intravenously
times one.  The patient continued to be hypertensive and was
transferred to the Coronary Care Unit.

restent in [**2108-4-22**], plus percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty to ostial circumflex.  Echocardiogram in
[**2108-2-23**] showed an ejection fraction of 50% to 60%
