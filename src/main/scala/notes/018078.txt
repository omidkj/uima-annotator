Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 25699**] is an 83-year-old
male with a history of congestive heart failure,
hypertension, atrial fibrillation, meningioma,
gastroesophageal reflux disease, and pacemaker placement who
presented with severe hypoxia and hypotension requiring
emergent intubation.

Several days prior to admission, the patient had been placed
on levofloxacin at his nursing home for pneumonia.  On the
day of admission, he was noted by his nursing home staff to
have a peripheral oxygen saturation of 77%, dyspnea, and
increased pedal edema.

On arrival to the Emergency Room, his blood pressure was
64/33.  He was given a 500-cc normal saline bolus with some
improvement in his blood pressure.  A portable chest x-ray
was read as consistent with acute pulmonary edema.  The
patient had worsening hypoxia by peripheral saturations, and
the Emergency Department team was unable to obtain an
arterial blood gas.  The patient was placed on noninvasive
positive pressure ventilation.  His blood pressure dropped at
that time to 56/palpation, and the patient was placed on a
dopamine intravenous drip at 5 mcg/kg per minute.  The
patient's blood pressure improved to 150/63, and the patient
was given Lasix 20 mg intravenously.

However, at 2:30 p.m. on the day of admission, the patient's
PO2 was noted to be 46, and the patient was endotracheally
intubated for hypoxia.

Initial laboratory work was notable for a decreased
hematocrit and an elevated International Normalized Ratio.
Nasogastric lavage was performed and was negative.  A right
internal jugular cordis was placed in the Emergency Room.

After failed attempts at a right radial and right axillary
arterial line, a left femoral arterial line was eventually
placed in the Emergency Room.  During the course of these
procedures, the patient's blood pressure dropped to 50
systolic, and he responded to an increase in dopamine to
10 mcg/kg per minute.

ALLERGIES:  The patient had no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a resident at [**Hospital3 98565**] Home since [**2148-3-29**].  Per his wife [**Name (NI) **], he is
a full code.  His primary care physician is [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 622**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  At the time of
presentation the patient was afebrile, with a blood pressure
of 125/60 (on dopamine 10 mcg/kg per minute), and a heart
rate of 70.  He had an oxygen saturation of 95%, and a
central venous pressure of 15 with U waves.  His skin was
warm and well perfused with good capillary refill.  Head and
neck revealed the patient was intubated.   Pupils were equal,
round, and reactive to light.  The lungs were clear to
auscultation anteriorly.  The heart had a regular rate and
rhythm, with a [**4-3**] holosystolic murmur at the base without
radiation.  The abdomen was slightly firm but nontender with
an anterior ventral hernia and positive bowel sounds, and he
had 3+ symmetrical lower extremity edema.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  At the time of
admission the patient had a white blood cell count of 14.3, a
hematocrit of 29.4, and platelets of 235.  He had a sodium of
141, potassium of 5.4, chloride of 100, bicarbonate of 24,
blood urea nitrogen of 109, creatinine of 3.4, and blood
glucose of 111.  His INR was 5.4, and PTT of 41.  His initial
arterial blood gas prior to intubation was 7.35/50/46 with a
lactate of 1.  His urinalysis showed moderate blood and
50 red blood cells, but only 3 to 5 white blood cells, and no
casts.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  His chest x-ray showed mild cardiomegaly,
a right lower lobe consolidation with effusion, and mild
congestive heart failure.

Electrocardiogram was AV paced, poor anterior R wave
progression, question anterior infarct of undefined age.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient's hypotension was initially
thought secondary to sepsis, and he was started on broad
spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and
Flagyl; and blood cultures were drawn.

Based on the initial suspicion that his septic etiology may
be related to abdominal pathology, a Surgery consultation was
obtained.

The Surgery consultation recommended an I- CT scan of the
abdomen and serial examinations.  The I- CAT scan revealed
free fluid in the right pericolic gutter and a possible
gallstone, but no other notable pathology.

The patient had a persistent pressor requirement of
dopamine 10 mcg/kg per minute throughout the first hospital
day.  A trial of low-dose dobutamine was attempted on the
second hospital day, but the patient's pressure dropped
precipitously and it was discontinued.

A transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained which showed a
left atrium normal in size, right atrium moderately dilated,
and mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesis of the anterior septum and apex.  More notable,
there was severe 4+ mitral regurgitation and severe 4+
tricuspid regurgitation.  There was mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.  Compared with a prior study of [**2146-7-30**], left and right ventricular function was worse, and
tricuspid and mitral regurgitation was worse.

This study was also reviewed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**] who was
covering the Medical Intensive Care Unit Green Service on
[**2148-6-15**].  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] believed that the patient's left
ventricular ejection fraction was closer to 20% than the
initial read of 40%.  In addition, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] was convinced
that at least half of the patient's stroke volume was flowing
backwards as a result of his severe mitral regurgitation.
Thus, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] felt that the patient's likelihood of
meaningful recovery was minimal, and he conducted a family
meeting in which the patient was made do not resuscitate.

The patient was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics,
despite no evidence of infection on blood, urine, or sputum
cultures and on dopamine at 10 mcg/kg per minute.  Digoxin
was started on [**2148-6-17**]; per discussion with the
patient's cardiologist (Dr. [**Known firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]).

Several attempts were made to wean the patient's dopamine
over the next several days, but all were accompanied by
severe drops in the patient's systolic blood pressures to the
40s to 60s.  Another trial of dobutamine was attempted on
[**2148-6-17**] which again failed secondary to hypotension.

Given the patient's severe cardiac dysfunction and valvular
disease on echocardiogram, and the team's inability to
titrate his pressors after several days of broad spectrum
intravenous antibiotics and optimized blood pressures on
dopamine, family meetings were undertaken to discuss the
patient's poor long-term prognosis.

Family meetings were held on [**6-18**], [**6-19**], and [**2148-6-20**].  The family's concern for the patient's comfort were
addressed with increases in sedation; and eventually, on
[**6-19**], the decision was made to make no further increases in
the patient's dopamine dose.
