HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74 year old,
Caucasian male patient with a history of diabetes mellitus
and hypertension, who initially presented to an outside
hospital on [**2188-6-26**], with a several week history of
progressive dyspnea on exertion and fatigue with his usual
activities.  The patient states that in addition to the
several week history of dyspnea on exertion and fatigue, over
one to two days prior to admission he has noted increased
orthopnea, edema and chest pressure.  In the emergency
department at [**Hospital **] Hospital the patient was noted to have
hematocrit of 27 with chest x-ray showing failure.  The
patient became progressively dyspneic with oxygen saturations
ranging 90 to 93 percent in room air.  Due to impending
respiratory failure, the patient was placed on CPAP and given
Lasix with improvement in his symptoms.  While hospitalized,
the patient received three units of packed red blood cells.
He was taken to the cardiac catheterization lab on [**6-30**],
but had an episode of "flash pulmonary edema" and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a retired banker.  He
currently lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] denies a history of
tobacco or alcohol use.  The patient swims 30 laps in the
pool three to four times a week.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Afebrile, blood pressure 110/45, heart
rate 76, respiratory rate 18, 93 percent on 4 liters.  In
general, the patient was an elderly man in no acute distress,
pleasant and cooperative.  HEENT pupils equal, round,
reactive to light.  Extraocular movements intact.  The
patient had dry mucous membranes and oropharynx was clear.
Neck no evidence of jugular venous distention or thyromegaly.
Lungs decreased breath sounds in bilateral bases with rales
in the right lower lobe.  Heart regular rate and rhythm,
normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated.
Abdomen normoactive bowel sounds, mildly distended, soft,
nontender.  Extremities no evidence of cyanosis, clubbing or
edema.  The patient had 2 plus DP and PT pulses bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cells 7.1, hematocrit 31.4,
platelets 309.  INR 1.0.  Sodium 136, potassium 3.9, chloride
101, bicarb 27, BUN 31, creatinine 1.7, glucose 241.  Mag
1.6.  HDL 27, LDL 58.  TSH 0.16.  EKG normal sinus rhythm at
86 beats per minute, normal axis, left bundle branch block.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  CHF.  The patient was transferred from
[**Hospital **] Hospital, having had an echocardiogram there that
revealed an ejection fraction of 20 percent with moderate MR
[**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] as well as global left ventricular hypokinesis.  On
admission the patient had no evidence of volume overload with
no jugular venous distention or rales on lung exam.  The
patient had a chest x-ray on admission that showed bilateral
pleural effusions with potential consolidation in the right
lower lobe, representing either asymmetric pulmonary edema or
pneumonia.  On the morning of hospital day two the patient
had an acute episode of respiratory distress with oxygen
saturation decreasing to 50 percent, respiratory rate in the
40s, hypertensive to 188/90 with heart rate of 125.  The
patient was intubated and taken emergently to the cardiac
catheterization lab.  On arrival to the cardiac
catheterization lab, the patient was noted to be hypotensive,
considered secondary to propofol given during his intubation.
The patient was started on a dopamine drip and an intra-
aortic balloon pump was placed.  The patient's hemodynamics
revealed markedly elevated filling pressures with an RA
pressure of 16, RB pressure 69/12, PA pressure 69/20,
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure initially of 38.  Once the
patient's intra-aortic balloon pump was placed and his heart
rate slowed, his pulmonary capillary wedge pressure improved
to 14.  Cardiac output was noted to be markedly to 18.68 with
a cardiac index of 9.28.  These numbers were difficult to
interpret in the setting of the dopamine drip.  The patient's
cardiac catheterization showed no evidence of significant
coronary artery disease, though did reveal a 50 percent mid-
circumflex lesion that was stented.  The etiology of the
patient's acute pulmonary edema was considered potentially
related to transient ischemia causing mitral valve
regurgitation and resulting in acute pulmonary edema.  For
this reason, the patient received a stent in his left
circumflex artery.  The patient was transferred back to the
CCU where his intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned and
discontinued.  The patient's dopamine was also weaned and
discontinued.  For the remainder of his hospitalization the
patient was given a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor, the doses
of which were titrated up as tolerated by his chest pain and
heart rate.  The patient was evaluated with repeat
echocardiogram on [**2188-7-2**], that was significant for an
ejection fraction of 30 percent and overall moderate to
severely depressed left ventricular systolic function.  The
etiology of the patient's multiple episodes of acute
pulmonary edema was considered likely secondary to
hypertension in the setting of severe diastolic dysfunction.
In addition, the patient was noted to have severe systolic
dysfunction.  However, for the remainder of his
hospitalization and once off the intra-aortic balloon pump
and dopamine drip, the patient was treated with a beta
blocker and ACE inhibitor, the doses of which were titrated
up as tolerated by his blood pressure and heart rate.  The
patient appeared to be well compensated throughout the
remainder of his hospitalization and required no additional
diuresis.

Coronary artery disease.  As noted previously, the patient
was taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab on
hospital day two in the setting of respiratory failure and
emergent intubation.  The patient's cardiac catheterization
was significant for elevated filling pressures.  Coronary
angiography revealed a right dominant system with a 50
percent, mid-vessel, left, circumflex lesion, a distal, 50
percent, LAD lesion.  There was no angiographically apparent
coronary artery disease in the RCA.  The patient is status
post PTCA and Hepacoat stent placement to the left circumflex
lesion.  He was continued on aspirin and Plavix throughout
the remainder of his hospitalization.  As noted previously,
he was started on a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor, the doses
of which were titrated up as tolerated by his blood pressure
and heart rate.

Rhythm.  The patient was noted to have several episodes of
asymptomatic, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.  The
patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout these
episodes.  The electrophysiology consult service was
contact[**Name (NI) **] prior to discharge and recommended outpatient
followup one month after discharge.  The patient will be
evaluated with a Holter monitor and cardiac MRI, the results
of which will be reviewed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 284**], who will
see the patient one month after discharge.  The patient was
noted to have sinus tachycardia for much of his
hospitalization despite large doses of beta blocker.  It is
anticipated that the patient's beta blocker dose will be
titrated up as necessary by his outpatient cardiologist.

Diabetes mellitus.  The patient's finger stick glucose levels
were noted to be somewhat poorly controlled throughout his
hospitalization.  The patient's metformin was held on
admission secondary to concern for lactic a
