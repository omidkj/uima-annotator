Chief Complaint:
CODE STROKE (@[**Hospital1 18**] ED, called for right facial droop, right
hemiparesis and receptive aphasia)

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IV-tPA


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 88 year-old right handed woman with a history
including dementia with delusions, hypertension, and
hyperlipidemia who presented about one hour after the acute
onset
of right facial droop, right hemiparesis and receptive aphasia
for whom a code stroke was called.
.
According to the [**Hospital 228**] nursing home, she was in her usual
state of health until this afternoon. She was in the dining
room,
enjoying dinner.  She was apparently chatty, wishing everyone a
happy new year.  She was last known well at about 4:30 pm.
Between 4:45 and 5 pm, she developed sudden onset right sided
weakness.  She also devloped slurred speech and was making
non-sensical statements.  Concerned she was having a stroke, the
patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**].
.
Upon arrival, a code stroke was called.  Glucose was 122.
Although the examination fluctuated, initial NIH stroke scale
score was 12 for inability to answer month and age (2), failure
to follow commands (2), right facial droop (1), decreased
movement of both lower extremities - likely a function of
comprehension difficulties (2, 2), severe aphasia characterized
by relatively fluent non-sensical speech and poor comprehension
(2), and dysarthria (1).  Within about 20 minutes, she her right
upper extremity was completely paretic.  Although a stat CT scan
was unrevealing, the examination findings were considered
concerning for a left MCA stroke.  After discussions with her
health care proxy about the benefits and risks of the therapy,
t-pa was administered.

ECG on admission:
Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2133-2-8**]  6:54:46 PM
Sinus rhythm and frequent atrial ectopy. Diffuse ST-T wave
changes
as recorded [**2133-1-10**]. The rate has slowed and the ST-T wave
changes are
somewhat less prominent. Frequent atrial ectopy has appeared.
Otherwise, no diagnostic interim change.

CXR on admission:
UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: The heart size remains mildly
enlarged. The
aorta is tortuous and calcified, but the mediastinal contours
are unchanged from prior. Low lung volumes are again noted.
There is mild atelectatic changes noted in the left lung base.
The right lung is grossly clear. Degenerative changes are seen
within the left glenohumeral joint. There are no pneumothoraces
or pleural effusions.
  IMPRESSION: Mild left basilar atelectasis.

NCHCT on admission:
FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage. The
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation is largely preserved. The ventricles and sulci
appear
prominent due to involutional change but not overtly changed
from prior study and likely appropriate given the patient's age.
There is no edema or mass effect. The paranasal sinuses and
mastoid air cells are clear. In the left parotid gland, there is
a hypodense round mass that measures 19 x 17 mm (2;3) which has
increased in size from the prior study.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
If clinical concern for stroke persists, MR is more sensitive in
detecting acute ischemia.
2. Left parotid mass which has increased in size since [**2127**];
nonemergent MR imaging is
