endotracheal intubation


History of Present Illness:
64 yo man with Hx of stage IV lung Ca, CAD s/p MI, COPD, HTN,
p/w increased weakness, now s/p VT arrest and intubation in the
ED.
Pt originally presented to [**Hospital3 **] [**2102-11-27**]
with wheezing, so chest CT was obtained showing right hilar 3 cm
mass encasing bronchus. 1 month ago he c/o complaining of left
lower extremity weakness. A head MR showed multiple
ring-enhancing lesions and he was eventually diagnosed with
metastatic lung Ca. CXR and chest CT showed right upper lobe
mass. Bronch performed [**2103-2-13**] at [**Hospital 17065**] Hospital showed
3cm lesion encasing right hilar bronchus. He was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation (hospitalized [**Date range (3) 59129**]).
He received total brain irradiation, but he found not to be a
candidate for chemotherapy due to extensive disease.

Yesterday, his family brought him to the ED because he was
feeling progressively weakness. Reported non-productive cough. +
HA. + DOE. No F/C/N/V/CP.

In the ED, T 97.5, BP originally 165/47, HR 51. Head Ct showed
bleeing in one of the brain mets. While in the [**Name (NI) **], pt became
hypotensive. Dopamine was started. Pt reported CP, ECG showed
new V2-V6 ST depressions, has VT arrest. Intubated,
defibrillated at 200J, then PEA. Received epiX1, atropineX2,
pulse returned. Transferred to MICU.


Past Medical History:
s/p MI
cath [**Hospital3 **] 60 % circ and 70% RCA with EF 59% [**2099-12-26**]

[**2102-11-27**] had wheezing, so chest CT was obtained showing
mass,
right hilar 3 cm mass encasing bronchus, 4 biopsies were
non-diagnostic
HTN
+PPD, treated


Social History:
He is married, with four children. One child
lives in [**Doctor Last Name **] [**Country **] where he is from, three kids live here. He
would like us to talk to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1787**] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 59130**] [**Known lastname 59125**] who was his

AC 500*18, 100% PEEP 5
Gen: Intubated, sedated
Pulm: CTAB
CV: distant RRR no murmurs

Extr: No [**Location (un) **]

Pertinent Results:
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] [**2103-3-9**]: A total of 6 ring enhancing lesions seen
throughout the cerebral hemipheres and a 7th ring enhancing
lesion either centered within the meninges overlying the right
parietal lobe or within the adjacent bone.

MR C/T/L Spine [**2103-3-9**]:
1) Cervicothoracic imaging reveals no evidence of bony
metastases or cord impingement. No abnormal intraspinal
enhancement is seen.
2) Lumbosacral spine imaging demonstrates normal vertebrae and
no abnormal enhancement to indicate metastatic infiltration.

CXR [**2103-4-4**]
1) Lung nodules are unchanged.
2) Questionable increased right perihilar opacities on the right
side could represent early pneumonia or aspiration.

CT head [**2103-4-4**]
1) Multiple cerebral metastases as seen in the prior MRI from
[**2103-3-8**].
2) There is a hyperdense area in the right parietal region that
suggest a small acute hemorrhage. This appears to be new when
compared to the MRI from [**2103-3-8**].
3) Questionable hyperdense area around the left parietal mass
could represent hemorrhage. However, the patient had a small
amount of hemorrhage around this area on [**2103-3-8**].
4) Increased extra-axial space in the left frontal lobe. This is
unchanged when compared to the prior MRI.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) Shock: Cardiogenic +/- sepsis. Pt was put on pressors for
blood pressure control.  These were then stopped, after
discussion with family, as pt has end stage metastatic lung
cancer.  After pressors were stopped, pt's blood pressure
remained fairly stable and his mentation improved somewhat, as
he was responsive.  Aspirin and heparin were avoided due to
intracranial bleed.  Pt was loaded on amiodarone, as well, which
was eventually discontinued in efforts to make him comfort
measures only.  Pt was also extubated the day prior to discharge
and continued to have good O2 sats.

2) Lung Ca: No treatment for primary nodule. Brain mets s/p XRT.
Pt was initially continued on decadron and dilantin for seizure
prophylaxis; however, these were discontinued as pt [**Name (NI) 3225**].

3) ID: Pt was initially placed on Levoflox/Vanc for possible
PNA, but these were discontinued as pt made [**Name (NI) 3225**].

4) sedation/pain control: pt was placed on a fentanyl drip
during most of the hospitalization.  At the time of discharge to
hospice, he was on fentanyl, and was given a prescription for
Roxinol.

5) Proph: Pt initially placed on PPI, pneumoboots. No sc hep.
Discontinued as [**Name (NI) 3225**].

6) Code status: Pt was made [**Name (NI) 3225**] per discussion with family.  Pt
thereafter extubated, pressors/antibiotics/other unnecessary
meds were stopped.  Labs were not drawn.

7) Dispo: Pt had bed at Hospice House and was discharged there.
Family informed of placement.
