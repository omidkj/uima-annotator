Cymbalta / Ativan

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Stress MIBI

History of Present Illness:
39 M w/ CAD s/p MI, s/p multiple PCI p/w CP. Pt started to have
CP when he was walking in a park w/ his wife. It was his
"familiar" CP. It went away by itself but came back again. He
called 911 and went to OSH when he was still having the CP.
There his EKG was normal and his first set of enzymes showed
trop I 0.00 (nl <0.08) at 1817 on [**4-16**] (no CK available). He was
started on IV heparin and IV nitro. He also received IV
morphine. he was CP free by 8 pm. his second set of enzymes
showed trop I 0.486 (nl <0.034) and CK 184 (nl <170)at 0430 on
[**4-17**]. repeat EKG again   showed NSR and no sig ST-T changes from
previous. He was xferred here for further mgmt.
.
In the CCU he denies CP, SOB. The CP did not recur since last
night.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA,  pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

TTE [**2175-4-18**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with thinned and akinetic (mildly aneurysmal) basal
inferior and inferolateral segments. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2168-4-19**], basal inferior hypokinesis was
reported previously. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is probably similar.

ETT-MIBI:
INTERPRETATION: 39 yo man s/p multiple PCIs was referred to
evaluate
an atypical chest discomfort and elevated troponins. The patient

completed 7 minutes of a modified [**Doctor First Name **] protocol representing a
poor
exercise tolerance; ~ 5 METS. The exercise test was stopped
secondary to
rapidly progressive anginal symptoms. Early in exercise, the
patient
reported an anterior chest burning/heaviness and bilateral arm
discomfort and fatigue. Rapid progressive of these symptoms were
noted
during stage III of exercise and exercise was terminated;
symptoms [**8-7**].
The symptoms resolved quickly following rest and administration
of O2 nc
being absent 2 minutes post-exercise. No significant ST segment
changes
were noted during the procedure. The rhythm was sinus with no
ectopy
noted. The blood pressure response to exercise was appropriate.
In the
presence of beta blockade, and exercise-limiting symptoms, the
peak
exercise heart rate was blunted.

IMPRESSION: Anginal-LIMITING symptoms in the absence of ischemic
ST
segment changes. Nuclear report sent separately.

Cardiac catheterization: report pending.  RCA stenoses treated
with 4 taxus stents.

discharge Cr 2.1, hct stable.

Brief Hospital Course:
#. CAD: Pt had chest pain, similar to the ones he has had in
past and had enzyme elevation although no EKG changes. He ruled
for a NSTEMI with CK peak of 147. He was treated with heparin
gtt, continued on nitro gtt and plavix loaded. The nitro was
quickly weaned off without recurrence of angina. He was
continued ASA, toprol XL, ACEI, and plavix. Statin was increased
given cholesterol not at goal. ETT-MIBI was aborted for angina
after 1 minute of excercise. Therefore he underwent cardiac
catheterization with 4 taxus stents to his RCA.

#. diastolic CHF: Last echo in 02 showed EF of 45-55% and on TTE
here EF same however new apical akinesis. He was continued on
ACEI, statin, beta blocker, and asa.

#. H/o DVT: coumadin was held in preparation for potential cath
and was restarted prior to discharge.

#. S/p renal xplant: Creatinine stable at 2-2.5. Renal was
consulted and confirmed cyclosporine and prenisone doses and
patient was continued on this regimen.  He was given mucomyst
and bicarbonate prior to cardiac catheterization

#. Neuropathy: Patient was continued on oxycodone and methodone
per his home regimen with short-acting oxycodone prn as patient
has ADR with tylenol (a reported interaction between his
coumadin and acetominophen).
