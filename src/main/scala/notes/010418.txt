HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the medical
service and scheduled for a cardiac catheterization.  She
underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**2115-6-3**] which revealed
three vessel disease.  Cardiac surgery was consulted at this
point and decision was made to take her to the Operating
Room.  The patient underwent coronary artery bypass graft x3
on [**2115-6-6**] with left internal mammary artery to LAD, RSVG to
OM to RAPD.  She tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred to the CSR unit in intubated condition.  She was
on pressors at this point.  She was extubated on
postoperative day 1.  Over the next few days it was noted she
had a marginal urine output and she was started on a dopamine
infusion.  On [**2115-6-10**], she was noted to have a left pleural
effusion and a left chest tube was placed.  A renal consult
was obtained on [**2115-6-11**] for the low urine output and rising
creatinine.  They suspected renal hyperperfusion and ATN due
to relative hypertension.  She was slowly weaned off of the
dopamine.  She went into atrial fibrillation/flutter on
[**2115-6-13**].  Renal recommendations were followed.  She continued
to be in flutter on postoperative day 7 and she was started
on a heparin infusion.  She was hemodynamically stable, but
still continued to have marginal urine output and therefore
needed a Neo-Synephrine infusion to keep her blood pressure
up so she could have a urine output.

Electrophysiology was consulted on [**2115-6-14**] for the atrial
fibrillation.  She was cardioverted per EP on postoperative
day 8 and was in sinus rhythm.  She continued to make slow
progress over the next few days.  Her white count increased,
but no focal symptoms occurred.  Per EP recommendations, she
would need to be anticoagulated for about a month.  She was
then started on Coumadin.  She was slowly weaned off of
pressors over the next three days.  Her urine output was
maintained off pressors and diuretics.  Her potassium was
still elevated.  She was transferred to the floor on
postoperative day 13 in stable condition.  She had some wound
drainage at this point and required Betadine dressing
changes.  On postoperative day 14 while on the floor, she
complained of some gassy abdominal pain which was
intermittent.  Subsequently, she had guaiac positive black
melanotic stools.  A lab check at this point revealed a
hematocrit of 23 which was a 7 point drop of prior hematocrit
of 30.  She was started on blood transfusion and her heparin
and Coumadin were discontinued.  A gastrointestinal consult
was obtained at this point and she was transferred back to
the Intensive Care Unit for closer monitoring.  She was
started on Protonix [**Hospital1 **] and transfused packed red cells.

She underwent an endoscopy by gastrointestinal on [**2115-6-21**].
This revealed a normal esophagogastroduodenectomy to the
second part of the duodenum.  These findings do not explain
melena and hematocrit drop.  If the hematocrit continues to
drop and the patient was stable, the gastrointestinal
consultant advised a colonoscopy.  Her hematocrit stayed
stable after this point and she was considered stable for
transfer back to the regular floor on [**2115-6-22**].  She had high
potassium at this point which was treated.  She has continued
subsequently to be stable and is now ready for discharge to a
rehabilitation facility as soon as a bed is available.
