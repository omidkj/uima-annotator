History of Present Illness:
61-
year-old gentleman with multiple medical problems including
severe sleep apnea who developed a severe pneumonia in
[**2164-10-5**] requiring intubation. After 10 days, he
underwent tracheostomy tube placement which remained for 5
months during a prolonged recovery phase. Subsequent to
decannulation, he developed progressive dyspnea and was
diagnosed with subglottic stenosis. He is, therefore, being
taken forward for surgical resection.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2166-3-15**] 11:37 AM
Reason: SOB
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
62 year old man s/p tracheal resection and reconstruction
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
SOB
HISTORY: Shortness of breath.
Single portable chest radiograph demonstrates no change in the
previously demonstrated prominent superior mediastinum when
compared to multiple examinations including the one dated
[**2166-3-10**]. No pneumothorax detected. There has been interval
improvement in the previously seen pulmonary edema. Small
right-sided pleural effusion likely persists. Trachea remains in
the midline. The cardiac silhouette is unchanged.
IMPRESSION:
Persistent, small, right-sided pleural effusion. Prominent
superior mediastinum, unchanged.

DIAGNOSIS:
Trachea:
Fragment of trachea with acute and chronic inflammation and
squamous metaplasia.  There is inflammation and scarring
transmurally.  This is consistent with an old tracheostomy site.
Clinical: Tracheal stenosis.
Gross: The specimen is received fresh in one part labeled
"[**Known lastname 22771**], [**Known firstname 5335**]" with the [**Hospital 228**] medical record number and
"tracheal stenosis" and consists of a 3.5 x 2.9 x 1.6 cm
aggregate of multiple tan-white focally hemorrhagic soft tissue
fragments, some of which have a C-shaped configuration. The
specimen is represented in A.

ANESTHESIA:  General endotracheal.

INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  The patient is a delightful 61-
year-old gentleman with multiple medical problems including
severe sleep apnea who developed a severe pneumonia in
[**2164-10-5**] requiring intubation. After 10 days, he
underwent tracheostomy tube placement which remained for 5
months during a prolonged recovery phase. Subsequent to
decannulation, he developed progressive dyspnea and was
diagnosed with subglottic stenosis. He is, therefore, being
taken forward for surgical resection.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  The patient was taken to the
operating room, positioned supine and placed under
anesthesia. We carefully placed the rigid bronchoscope and
with some difficulty, we were able to find the glottis and
intubate the larynx. It took some time due to the excessive
soft tissue folds in this pharynx. With the rigid scope
sitting just above the stricture, I carefully examined the
lesion in the distal airways. Using the flexible
bronchoscope, we traversed the lesion, examined the lower
airways and found there to be diffuse tracheobronchomalacia
extending down the bilateral mainstem bronchi as well as the
trachea. We took airway measurements and the lesion measured
2 cm in length and commenced 2.5 cm from below the vocal
cords and the distance from the inferior aspect of the
stenosis to the carinal spur was 8.5 cm. The stenosis was a
classic A-shaped stenosis with buckling of the 1st and 2nd
cartilaginous rings of the trachea and scarring of the
anterior aspect of the trachea creating an A-shape. The lumen
was approximately 4-5 mm. There was malacia of the posterior
wall. The anesthesia service then placed a bougie catheter
through the rigid bronchoscope and we used this to guide a #8
endotracheal tube into position. We then positioned the
patient supine with the table carefully positioned in the
manner of a reclining chair. We placed a roll behind the
patient's shoulders and extended his neck, but at no time was
his neck left in the floating position. We tucked his arms at
his sides and prepped and draped his neck and chest in the
usual sterile fashion.

We commenced the operation by making a collar incision,
dissecting down through the scarred areas of the platysma and
elevating a subplatysmal flap superiorly up to the superior
aspect of the thyroid cartilage and inferiorly down to the
sternal insertions of the sternocleidomastoids. We then
placed Weitlaner retractors bilaterally and continued with
our dissection. We separated the strap muscles from the
midline and dissected down to the trachea below the area of
stricture and scarring. In order to facilitate exposure, we
performed a lipectomy of the pretracheal fat that left a
large portion of soft tissue surrounding the innomin
