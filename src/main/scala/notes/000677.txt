Dyspnea

History of Present Illness:
(History is per records and patient's husband, pt is unable to
complete a full sentence [**3-4**] severe dyspnea)
59 yo F, s/p wedge resection [**2180-10-4**] with tracheobronchomalacia
s/p reconstruction. Coming in with 'mild confusion' from rehab
facility but A&O. Also reports pleuritic CP, feels 'not
herself'. She reports being on oxygen and steroid taper since
discharge from the hospital. About one week prior she developed
low grade fever, chills and vomiting. She apparently had several
tests done and a CXR at rehab per her husband, with no clear
etiology. Two days prior to admission, she was taken off her
supplemental O2 and reports feeling worse. She also reported CP,
but this has been somewhat a chronic issue since discharge s/p
thoracotomy. The day of admission, she became acutely SOB while
at rehab, and was transported to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
EKG with sinus tachycardia and concern for Q in III, T-wave
changes laterally concerning for acute change. Given need for
large amounts supplemental O2 and dyspnea, concerned about PE.
CTA (per report of ED resident) revealed massive b/l saddle
emboli with R heart strain on CT. ED resident u/s heart with
signs of strain, dilated ventricle with e/o hypokinesis. A&O x 3
now. Upon transfer VS with SBP 94, HR 115, 24 on 95/6L. Given 1L
NS to increase preload, another to hang on way. Heparin given
with a bolus. Access is 18g x 3.
.
Upon arrival to the ICU, patient with severe dyspnea. Cannot
participate in full ROS, but does nod to having CP, but no
abdominal pain or leg pain.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 59 yo F with tracheobronchomalacia s/p recent thoracic
tracheo- and broncho-plasty with right upper lobe wedge
resection admitted on [**2180-11-22**] with severe dyspnea, found to
have large bilateral PE's and evidence of right heart strain.
.
The patient underwent right thoracotomy with thoracic tracheo-
and broncho-plasty with right upper lobe wedge resection on
[**2180-10-4**]. She was discharged to rehab on [**2180-10-11**]. At rehab the
patient was maintained on supplemental oxygen and a prednisone
taper. One week prior to re-admission she developed some fevers,
shortness of breath and nausea. The patient presented from rehab
on [**2180-11-23**] with acute severe dyspnea and was found to have
bilateral sub-massive PE's with bilateral lower extremity DVT's
and signs of right heart strain on EKG and echo. She received
systemic anticoagulation with marked improvement in her
symptomatic dyspnea and oxygen requirement back to her baseline
home oxygen supplementation by nasal cannula. At the time of
discharge the patient was therapeutic on warfarin with 24 hours
of overlap with therapeutic heparin. The patient will follow-up
with her PCP for further discussion of:
- Ongoing INR monitoring and warfarin dosage adjustment.
- Hypercoaguable work-up and duration of anticoagulation.
- Elective outpatient TTE in the future to evaluate for signs of
resolution of right heart strain.

The patient did have a small amount of hematuria with a single
episode of clot passage in the urine and a nosebleed while on
dual therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin and warfarin. She
was counselled to discuss any ongoing hematuria with her PCP and
to consider outpatient referral to urology if necessary. No
visible blood was seen on urination on the day of discharge.

Of note the patient had some lower extremity edema and a
positive fluid balance while in the hospital and her home lasix
had been held during her hospitalization. The patient was
restarted on her home lasix and will follow-up with her PCP for
ongoing monitoring.

The patient has significant baseline lung diseaes including
COPD. She was continued on an oral prednisone taper consistent
with her admission medications. She was transitione
