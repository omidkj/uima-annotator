Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2167**]
Chief Complaint:
LE swelling/Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
L IJ hemodialysis catheter placement (used for plasmaphoresis
that your recieved), removed


History of Present Illness:
This is a 60 year-old male with distant hx nephrolithiasis who
was transferred from OSH for LE edema/pain, SOB on exertion x
2-3weeks, found to be have acute renal failure, anemia, and
pulmonary hemorrhage on bronchoscopy.

OSH course:
Though sx started 2-3 weeks ago, pt did not seek care until now
due to having no PCP (regular PCP had retired.) He finally
presented for care when he could not put his shoes on in the
a.m. due to pedal edema. Upon presentation to the OSH, pt
complained of bilateral LE pain/edema. Pt reports that LE
symptons started in the feet, progressing to swelling of his
legs to his knees over 3 weeks. He also noted a diffuse macular
rash in the LE of the same distribution.  He also complained of
some SOB on exertion and decreased appetite.

In the OSH ED, VS was tachycardic (126), afebrile (97F), BP
131/70. He was noted as having mild wheezing and productive
cough of white sputum. Mental status was clear. Initial
bloodwork showed K 5.6, BUN 130, Cr 9.6. Tp nml at 0.3. BNP
elevated at 625. Urinary protein elevated at 2410. Hct was 14.1
on admission, up to 23 after transfusion of 5 units. Occult
blood stool negative. U/A significant for protein 400mg/dl,
blood 250mg/dl, bilirubin negative, nitrite/leukocyte negative.
Urine microscopy positive for RBCs, granular casts.

Pt was seen by Renal consult, who thought there might possibly
be a pulmonary-renal syndrome or vasculitis, with ESR>140. He
was given Solumedrol 1g IV x 1. Cyclophosphamide was started
after UOP was confirmed to be adequate.  Work-up by Renal
included C3/C4, [**Doctor First Name **], anti-GBM, anti-DNA, cryglobulins, ANCA,
HepB/C serology.

CXR on admission showed underlying COPD with diffuse bilateral
pulmonary infiltrates. Pt underwent bronchoscopy on [**2199-7-6**], and
was found to have active low grade blood emanating from the RLL
and LLL.

EKG on admission showed atrial flutter at 2:1 block rate 150.

The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.  On
arrival here, pt appeared comfortable. He reported that LE edema
had improved, and that pain had resolved in LE. He complained of
only mild nausea recently without vomiting, and a productive
cough. Otherwise denies sore throat, fevers, chills, abdominal
pain, diarrhea, constipation, melena, hematochezia, chest pain,
urinary frequency/urgency, dysuria, lightheadedness, vision
changes, headache, no epistaxis. Last BM was yesterday, and was
formed.


Past Medical History:
none known prior

Social History:
Pt works full-time as a machine operator. Mostly stationary job.
Divorced, college-age son lives with wife. Lives alone.
Smoked 1-1/2 ppd until [**2194**] when he quit (possibly 50 pack year
hx prior). Drinks ~2 drinks/day, and on social occasions. Denies
other drug use.


Family History:
Mother passed from CVA in 80s. Father passed in 70s from unknown
cause. Twin brother passed from MI, another brother with hx
cardiac artery bypass graft. Denies family hx renal or pulmonary
disease.

Pertinent Results:
[**2199-7-6**] 11:05PM   GLUCOSE-219* UREA N-144* CREAT-9.7*
SODIUM-143 POTASSIUM-6.2* CHLORIDE-107 TOTAL CO2-16* ANION
GAP-26*

CXR: [**2199-7-7**]
 There is mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. Diffuse
bilateral asymmetric alveolar opacifications involving almost
all of both lungs. This would be consistent with diffuse
alveolar hemorrhage as clinically suspected. Fibrocalcific
changes in the apices are consistent with old granulomatous
disease.

Diagnosis:

Renal Biopsy, needle:  Pauci-immune crescentic
glomerulonephritis, see note.
Light Microscopy: The specimen consists of renal cortex and
medulla, containing approximately 23 glomeruli, of which 2 are
globally sclerotic.  The remainder all show either cellular or
fibrocellular crescents.  Many show neutrophilic infiltrate.
The [**Hospital1 **] themselves show no significant endocapillary
proliferation.

There is moderate interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy.
Patchy [**Hospital1 **] inflammation accompanies the scarring. Intact
areas show acute and [**Hospital1 **] inflammation.  Red cell casts are
present.

Arteries show moderate intimal fibroplasia.

Arterioles show moderate mural thickening with some hyaline
change.  No active vasculitis is noted.

Immunofluorescence:  The specimen consists of renal cortex only,
containing approximately 8 glomeruli, of which 1 is globally
sclerotic.  There is patchy mesangial staining for IgG (trace),
and C3 (trace-1+ as well as in vessels).   IgA, IgM, Kappa,
Lambda, and C1q are negative.  Three [**Hospital1 **] show fibrin
positivity in crescents. Albumin is non-contributory.

Electron microscopy:  Findings will be issued in an addendum.

Comment:

The varied "ages" of the crescents, as well as the
tubulo-interstitial scarring, suggest some chronicity to this
process.

Clinical:  No significant PMH.  Presented in ARF; SCr=9.6
Pulmonary hemorrhage on bronchoscopy.  ANCA positive.

Gross:   Received are needle core(s) of light brown tissue.  The
specimen is viewed in the dissecting microscope, identified as
renal by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3535**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], and divided into material for light
(formalin fixation) and electron microscopy and
immunofluorescence studies.

PAS and [**Doctor Last Name **] stains were done to evaluate basement membranes -
Masson's trichrome stains were done to evaluate interstitial
fibrosis.

CT Chest without contrast [**2199-7-22**]:

IMPRESSION:

1. Widespread pulmonary abnormalities including consolidation,
ground glass
in poorly defined lung nodules, slightly worse, but no new areas
involved. As
previously mentioned vasculitis and associated pulmonary
hemorrhage are the
primary diagnosis. Coexisting infection such as bacterial
infection or
aspergillosis cannot be excluded.

2. Spiculated right apical lesion raise concern for possible
primary lung
cancer especially on a patient with underlying emphysema. It is
still
potentially can be related to diffuse lung abnormalities thus
three months
followup chest CT is highly recommended.

3. Extensive intrathoracic lymphadenopathy: related to
vasculitis and/or
reactive to infection.

4. Slightly increased but still small bilateral pleural effusion
in minimal
amount of ascites.
