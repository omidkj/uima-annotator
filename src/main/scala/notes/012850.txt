History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 39190**] is a 47 year old female with history of CVA with
left residual weakness s/p abdominal hysterectomy due to uterine
fibroids on [**2197-12-14**] who presented to [**Hospital6 5016**]
with HCT 17 and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2198-1-24**] with a
diagnosis of hemolytic anemia.
.
She had been in her usual state of good health until several
months ago, when she was noted during routine physicial to have
uterine fibroids.  She underwent abdominal hysterectomy on
[**2197-12-14**] without complication and per patient with minimal blood
loss.  She denied any report of anemia at post-op follow-ups.
She denied any frank vaginal blood loss, melena, back pain, or
hematuria during this time.  She does state, however, she had
upper respiratory illness secondary
to sick contacts in her family household.  She sought medical
attention on [**2198-1-22**] where she was noted to have an
hematocrit of 17, an MCV of 120, platelet count of 467,000.  Her
white blood cell count was 22.  Mycoplasma IgM serology was
positive.  Mono screen was negative.  Iron studies were within
normal limits, however, the patient's LDH was 670 with a
haptoglobin of less
than 15.  The patient was evaluated by both infectious disease
and hematology-oncology services at the outside institution.
Given the concern of hemolytic anemia and potential
myeloproliferative disorder, the patient underwent a bone marrow
biopsy, which upon initial evaluation was concerning for
multiple
myeloma.  The patient was initially transfused 1 unit of packed
red blood cells, however, developed fevers and rigors in that
setting, and therefore it was stopped prematurely.  She was
given Decadron, Benadryl, Tylenol, and started on Solu-Medrol
prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 69**].
.
Upon transfer, she was feeling well, but fatigued. No chest
pain, SOB, fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting. She does note mild
headache. No melena, no hematuria, no vaginal bleeding. ROS
otherwise unremarkable


Past Medical History:
# s/p CVA: unclear what work-up done at the time, but was told
she had a clot that went to her brain. Unclear if any hypercoag
work-up, echo ever done; now she has significant weakness on
left arm and leg
# s/p L3 diskectomy
# HTN?
# Per her friend, ? childhood leukemia, but Pt does not know
this?

Studies:
[**1-24**] CXR: IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process. Lucency in
the left base, as above. Attention to this area can be paid on
follow up studies.
.
[**1-26**] CTA: IMPRESSION: Findings are consistent with
nonobstructive segmental PE involving the right middle lobe
lateral segment artery.
.
[**1-26**] Abd CT IMPRESSION:
1. Findings consistent with intraparenchymal and subcapsular
splenic hematoma with evidence of active extravasation into the
hematoma.
2. 4.3-cm hemorrhagic left adnexal cyst. Further evaluation with
ultrasound is suggested once the patient's acute problems have
resolved.
.
[**1-26**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia. Short P-R interval. No previous
tracing available for comparison.
.
[**1-27**] FINDINGS: Two fluoroscopic spot images show deployment of
an IVC filter, with superior tip seen at the midportion of the
L2 vertebral body and the inferior tips seen towards the
inferior aspect of the L3 vertebral body.
.
[**1-28**] CT IMPRESSION:
1) Stable appearance of the spleen with several segmental
hypoperfusing regions, most consistent with infarctions
(particularly given the lack of trauma history). Some
hetergeneity could be from small superimposed hemorrhage, though
this is uncertain.
2) Arterially hyperenhancing focus in the lateral aspect of the
lower pole of the spleen is unchanged from the prior study,
arguing against active extravasation. This focus is felt more
likely to relate to a hypervascular lesion such as a hemangioma.
3) Persisting thrombosed right ovarian vein.
4) Approximately 4cm left adnexal cyst, which could be evaluated
by pelvic ultrasound on a non-emergent basis.
5) Scattered minimal intrahepatic biliary dilitation of unclear
etiology and significance. Comparison with prior studies if
available or further work-up is recommended.
6) Large left basilar bleb with associated atelectasis.
.
[**1-28**] LE US: IMPRESSION: No DVT.
.
[**1-30**] UE US: IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in
either upper extremity.
.
[**1-30**] Cardiac Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial
septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color
Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
[**2-2**] CT Abd/Pelvis: IMPRESSION:
1. Evaluation of the solid organs is limited without IV
contrast. However, the appearance of the spleen is stable with
several segmental areas of hypoattenuation most likely
consistent with infarction. Areas of heterogeneity may represent
superimposed hemorrhage, however this appearance is not changed.
2. 4.1 cm left adnexal cyst which could be evaluated by pelvic
ultrasound on a nonemergent basis.
