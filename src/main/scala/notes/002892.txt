History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 87yo male with past medical history significant
for
diabetes, severe PVD, ischemic CMY (EF 25%), stage III CKD, CAD,
hypothyroidism, and chronic atrial fibrillation who presents now
complaining of LLE pain which was fairly abrupt in onset over
last 24 hours, erythema and warmth all concerning for cellulitis
vs. additional vascular compromise. He was seen by nurse
practitioner [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 191**] earlier this afternoon and sent to ED for
additional workup. He denies any numbness or tingling in foot.
Denies fevers or chills. Small superficial left tibal area
lesion but no other open wounds over LE.
.
Of significance, he states that he was seen at [**Hospital3 2358**]
about 2 weeks ago for similar LE erythema and treated with oral
antibiotics that he completed last week. He also had a recent
visit with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**10-12**] and severe right sided SFA
stenosis discussed regarding need for future
angioplasty/stenting but he was noted to have less severe left
sided disease per OMR notes.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.5F,P 71, BP 127/53, RR 18 and
O2 saturation 99% RA. Patient was given IV vancomycin and IV
Unasyn antiobiotics follwed by Tramadol and Tylenol for pain
with good relief. Two sets of blood cultures sent off. Labs were
notable for a wbc count of 30 with 91% neutrophils. Urinalysis
negative for infection and CXR with no infiltrates just minimal
bilateral effusions. Fully dopplerable pulses in the ED. CT scan
of LLE showed superficial soft tissue edema noted throughout the
left calf, without focal fluid collection to suggest abscess and
without soft tissue air. No concerning bony lesions to imply
oseomyelitis. Also had LE US which was negative for any overt
DVTs.
.
Orthopedic team and vascular surgery both consulted in ED due to
concern for possible compartment syndrome and patient had
Striker intracompartmental pressure monitor measured with
posterior compartment of leg 10 cm H2O while diastolic BP was
52mmHg which ruled against any compartment syndrome.
.
On arrival to the medical floor he appeared to be in no acute
distress. Vital signs were: T 96.9F, HR 69, BP 104/54, O2 sat
99% on 3L NC. States his LLE pain is minimal and denies feeling
chills or feverish.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, URI sx, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denied cough, shortness of breath. Denied chest pain or
tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation or abdominal pain. No recent change in bowel or
bladder habits. No dysuria. Denied arthralgias or myalgias.

Imaging/procdures:
Catheterization
COMMENTS:
1. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided
filling
pressures with RVEDP of 18 mm Hg and mean PCWP of 22 mm Hg.
There was
moderate pulmonary hypertension with PASP of 63 mm Hg. The
cardiac index
was depressed at 2 l/min/m2. The arterial oxygen saturation was
taken
from finger oximetry.
2. Milrinone infusion and repeat hemodynamic measurements to be
completed in the CCU per the CHF team.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
2. Pulmonary hypertension.
3. Depressed cardiac index.

Lower extremity Dopplers [**11-3**]:
IMPRESSION:
Deep venous thrombosis in the left peroneal vein.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 87yo male with PMH significant for severe PVD
s/p stenting, CAD, CHF/CMY, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, and
chronic kidney disease who presents with leukocytosis, left LE
pain and erythema most consistent with cellulitis.
.
# LLE DVT/cellulitis and E. coli bacteremia: Presented with LLE
pain, swelling, and erythema.  Prior to presentation, had recent
history of LLE cellulitis with outpatient PO antibiotics which
he states he completed about 1.5 weeks ago. He was treated 2
weeks ago with antibiotics at [**Hospital3 2358**] ([**Location (un) 1456**]) for LLE
cellulitis in same distribution of his LLE. Unfortunately, no
culture data or specific antibiotics details were available for
review at time of admission. He presented with a WBC elevation
to 30, with >90% PMNs. Also had local pain, erythema, warmth and
imaging that shows soft tissue edema c/w cellulitis. No
underlying abscesses or early signs of osteomyelitis per
preliminary imaging which is reassuring. Cause may be related to
open stasis wound over left tibia. The patient's Doppler studies
demonstrated a DVT of his left peroneal vein. The patient was
then bridged via heparin to Coumadin to achieve a therapeutic
INR. The patient's blood culture from the Emergency Department
also was positive for E. coli, susceptible to ceftriaxone, which
the patient was started on ([**11-2**]) after two days on cefepime
(started on [**10-31**]). The patient should complete a 14-day course
of antibiotics.
.
# STAGE IV HEART FAILURE:  Patient had been medically managed
with ASA, atorvastatin, digoxin, eplerenone,
hydrochlorothiazide, torsemide, and metoprolol.  However, he
continued to decline, so there was consideration of benefit from
positive inotrope therapy
