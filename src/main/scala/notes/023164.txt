History of Present Illness:
48 yoM w/ a h/o depression and anxiety presents to the ER with
suicidal ideation. The patient recently had a death of his
sibling (sister, 2 months ago) and subsequently has suffered an
emotional decompensation. He has also had both visual (something
out of the corner of his eye, either a light or a mouse / rat)
and auditory hallucinations (woman crying and someone telling
him to kill himself x few weeks). He has been more depressed
lately and has started drinking. Given his depression and
suicidal ideation he called 911 as he was feeling like his
suicidal ideation was worsening, he had planned to shoot himself
but did not have a gun. He has had SI in the past, no prior
plans or attempts. He has been depressed since the age of 10,
with anxiety as well but no manic periods, and a history of
hallucinations in the past as well. He has a previous history of
ETOH abuse but been sober with AA since [**2153**]. He drinks about 2
pints of vodka per day. Has not stopped in the past 2 months but
prior has had DTs and seizures. His last drink was the day prior
to visit but not sure the timing.
.
The patient also states he has a history of "stomach cancer"
based on a blood test and complains of intermittent blood in his
stool and vomitus. Last blood in his BM and hematemesis was [**2-24**]
days ago, no BMs since then. He states the blood is pink. He
also has a history over the past few weeks of black stool.
.
The patient complains of darkening of his urine but no hematuria
or dysuria, no frequency / urgency.
.
He notes diffuse / upper abdominal pain, which has been ongoing
for a few days.
.
He feels thirsty, has had frequent falls including a fall with
loss of consciousness. He has no Fevers but occasional chills,
has had a 50 pound weight loss over the past few months.
.
The patient was initially noted to be tachycardic in the ER
(ranging from 116 to 130, this improved to 90 after IVF). The
patient was not ever hypotensive. He was noted to have a gap
acidosis of unclear cause (possibly ETOH). His ETOH level was
430 at 4 a.m. Psychiatry was also consulted in the ER. He was
given thiamine, folate and a multivitamin. Serum tox negative, U
tox not yet sent.

  RADIOLOGY
==============

ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND:
FINDINGS: The liver is mildly echogenic, suggesting fatty
infiltration. No
focal liver lesion is identified. There is no biliary
dilatation, and the
common duct measures 0.2 cm. The portal vein is patent with
hepatopetal flow. The gallbladder is partially filled with
sludge, but no gallstones are identified. The pancreas is
obscured from view by overlying bowel. The
spleen is unremarkable and measures 7.0 cm. There is no
hydronephrosis. The right kidney measures 10.0 cm, and the left
kidney measures 10.8 cm. The aorta is of normal caliber
throughout. There is no ascites identified in the abdomen.
IMPRESSION:
1. Mildly echogenic liver, which may indicate probable fatty
infiltration.
This can be associated with more significant liver disease such
as
cirrhosis/fibrosis. No focal liver lesion identified.
2. Sludge within the gallbladder, but no stones identified.
3. No splenomegaly and no ascites identified.

CHEST X-RAY:
FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with
patient in
sitting upright position. Comparison is made with the next
preceding PA and lateral chest examination of [**2167-12-19**]. The
heart size remains normal. No typical configurational
abnormality is identified. Thoracic aorta is stable.  No local
contour abnormalities. The pulmonary vasculature is not
congested.  There exists a local thickening of the pleural space
on the right base extending in posterior direction and
containing several local calcifications.
Coinciding with this is an old deformity in the mid right
clavicle, all
suggestive of old trauma, but stable in comparison with previous
examinations, including a chest CT examination of [**2167-1-4**].
Thus, no evidence of new acute parenchymal infiltrates or CHF in
this 48-year-old male patient with signs of hypoxia and cough.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 48 year old male with a history of ETOH abuse
and depression / anxiety presents with ETOH intoxication and
suicidal ideation.
.
# Suicidal Ideation: The patient has a longstanding history of
depression, no attempts but thoughts of suicidal ideation.
Patient was evaluated by psychiatry and felt not to be a [**Doctor Last Name 13205**]
to himself. Patient was restarted on home SSRI and at time of
discharge psychiatry felt that he needed further inpatient
treatment for his depression.
.
# ETOH withdrawal: On admission, showing signs of ETOH
withdrawal with tremor and tachycardia, no evidence of DTs.
Patient was treated at first with IV valiaum until withdrawal
improved, then transitioned to PO Valium per CIWA > 10. Patient
required 150mg of total valium during MICU stay, and was
transferred to the floor. Patient remained stable without any
need for valium as dictated by his CIWA scale, which was
discontinued on [**4-4**] per psychiatry.
.
# AG acidosis: Likely due to ethanol. Gap improved with
hydration and with time, resolved at time of transfer to the
floor.
.
# Abdominal Pain: given history of ETOH use, ddx included ETOH
hepatitis (especially given liver tenderness), no jaundice on
exam. In addition could be pancreatitis. Also, given a history
of hematemesis, melena, and BRPRB could be gastric malignancy,
vs. ulcer, vs. gastritis/duodenitis. RUQ ultrasound with mildly
echogenic liver, however without biliary obstruction. Patients
symptoms at time of discharge were improved with no complaints
of abdominal pain.
.
# GI Bleed: Subjective complaints of GI bleed. The patient has
been adverse to EGD in the past. Possibilities include ulcer,
malignancy
