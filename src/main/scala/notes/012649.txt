Admission Date:  [**2121-11-30**]       Discharge Date:  [**2121-11-28**]

Service:  BLUMEGART MEDICINE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 53-year-old
female with a complicated medical history who presented to
[**Hospital6 256**] Emergency Room after 2-3
days of shortness of breath, productive cough, and recent
syncopal episodes, four in the past month, with outpatient
EEG negative in [**2121-6-15**].

In the Emergency Department, respiratory rate was 20, oxygen
saturation was 85%, ABG on 100% non-rebreather was
significant for a pH of 7.22, pCO2 74, pO2 129.  The patient
received Levaquin and had a CT angiogram which was negative
for PE.  The patient also received Lasix 20 IV complicated by
hypotension to an SBP of 80.  Intravenous fluids was given
with some improvement.  Dopamine was started but was
complicated by chest pain with hard to interpret
electrocardiogram changes.  The Dopamine was then
discontinued.

The patient continued to respond to intravenous fluids.  The
patient was transferred to the MICU where chest PT,
suctioning, and 3 L of normal saline was given.  The
patient's blood pressure remained at approximately an SBP of
80s/ diastolic pressure of 30-40, with adequate urine output.

After aggressive suctioning, the patient's oxygen requirement
decreased to 2 L nasal cannula.  The patient was monitored
overnight in the MICU and was then transferred to the floor
on [**2121-12-1**], with the presumptive diagnosis of
tracheobronchitis.

The patient has a complicated medical history of
obstructive/restrictive lung disease, etiology unknown,
hypogammaglobulinemia, postviral demyelinating disease,
depression, neurogenic bladder.

In the Emergency Department, the patient was given Levaquin
500 mg IV x 1, Albuterol/Atrovent nebs, Lasix 20 mg IV,
Baclofen, Florinef 100 mcg p.o. x 1, Ultram 50 mg p.o. x 1,
................ 4 mg p.o. x 1, Klonopin 1 mg p.o. x 1,
Hydrocortisone 100 mg IV x 1.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Obstructive/restrictive lung
disease, etiology unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] PFTs were in [**2116-1-16**].
FEC was 1.22, 39% of predicted, FEV1/FEC 40, which is 76%
predicted, TLC 2.67, which is 57% of predicted, DLCO was
within normal limits when corrected for lung volume.  2.
Acquired hypogammaglobulinemia, subclass II, diagnosed in
[**2110**].  3.  Presumed demyelinating illness.  Per the patient's
physical therapist [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4051**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 104528**], and the
patient's husband, left hemiparesis developed approximately
10-11 years ago and rapidly progressed around 94-95 to the
point of plegia with concomitant sensory loss in the left
leg.  She has not been able to walk since that time until
about 12-18 months ago when her left hemiparesis and sensory
loss improved.  She is now able to walk with heavy
assistance.  The patient lived at [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation
from [**2114**] to [**2116**].  The patient has had dysphasia for at
least the past 4-5 years and neurogenic bladder with unclear
temporal relationship to hemiparesis.  The patient also
reported history of right-sided weakness that resolved, but
this was not corroborated by physical therapy or husband.
RAPD and arcuate field defect in left eye was noted by Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 2523**] in [**2115**] thought to be ................. demyelinating
disease by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 104529**] in [**2115**].  4.  Depression.  5.
Hypercholesterolemia.  6.  Anemia.  7.  Status post colonic
polypectomy, status post cholecystectomy, status post
appendectomy, status post right mastoidectomy, status post
G-tube placement for dysphagia.  8.  History of intestinal
torsion.  9.  Fibrocystic breast disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at home with physical
therapy services.  She is wheelchair bound.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Heart rate 66, blood
pressure 79/46, oxygen saturation 99% on 2 L nasal cannula.
General:  The patient was awake and in no apparent distress.
She was a thin, frailed woman.  Heart:  Normal S1 and S2.
Question of a 1 out of 6 systolic murmur at the apex.  Lungs:
Positive expiratory wheezes bilaterally.  Decreased breath
sounds at right base.  Abdomen:  Soft and nontender.  G-tube
site clean, nonerythematous, with no discharge noted.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  There were 2+
dorsalis pedis pules bilaterally.  Neurological:  The patient
was alert and oriented.  Left lower extremity [**12-17**] out of 5.
Right lower extremity [**2-16**] out of 5.  Upper extremity 4 out of
5 bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission white blood cell count was
6.5, hematocrit 31.5, platelet count 248, MCV notable at 99;
CHEM7 notable for a sodium of 146, potassium 3.5; CK #1 289,
this sample was hemolyzed, troponin less than 0.3, CK #2 88,
CK #3 71, troponin less than 0.3; calcium 7.5, phosphate 2.8,
magnesium 1.5; urine culture no growth; blood cultures no
growth.

DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:  On [**2121-11-23**], lumbar films of AP
and lateral views of lumbar and cervical spine were normal
without fractures, bone destruction, malalignment,
dysnarrowing, or osteophytic changes.  The hip and SI joints
were normal and symmetric.  No change from similar
examination five months ago.

On [**2121-11-26**], sacrum and coccyx films showed no
radiographic evidence of coccygeal fracture.

Chest x-ray from [**2121-11-25**], which was the latest
chest x-ray during this admission, showed definite left-sided
pleural effusion, slightly increased in size, continued small
right pleural effusion, retrocardiac density and bibasilar
infiltrate that could represent pneumonia in the appropriate
clinical setting.

CT of the head with and without contract on [**2121-11-24**], showed a single focus of hypodensity in the left
periventricular white matter which could represent a focus of
demyelinization.  The attenuation of the remainder of the
brain parenchyma was normal in appearance, and the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
matter differentiation was preserved.  There were no
enhancing lesions or mass affect.

Video oropharyngeal swallow study from [**2121-11-24**],
showed aspiration with both nectar and pudding base barium.

CTA with contrast from [**2121-11-20**], showed no pulmonary
emboli, small right hilar lymph node, 5 mm pretracheal lymph
nodes, paraseptal emphysema, hypodensity of right lobe of the
liver and left lateral lobe.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 53-year-old woman with a history
of obstructive/restrictive lung disease, demyelinating
disease of unclear etiology, who represents with a recent
history of syncope, increasing shortness of breath, and
productive cough.

1.  Cardiovascular:  In [**2119-9-15**], the patient had a
stress echocardiogram which was within normal limits with
mild aortic sclerosis, trace mitral regurgitation, trace
tricuspid regurgitation.  The patient had repeat
echocardiogram during this hospitalization which showed that
the left atrium was normal in size, left ventricular wall
thickness cavity size, and systolic function was within
normal limits with an ejection fraction of greater than 55%.
There was trivial mitral regurgitation and
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

In lieu of the results of this echocardiogram, it was
determined that the patient's hypotension was not cardiogenic
in nature.  The patient's Florinef had b
