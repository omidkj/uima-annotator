Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 75001**] was admitted to the TSICU. On arrival to the floor
he developed Vtach and as the type of DNR had only been
specified as no chest compressions, he was  cardioverted. His
family arrived shortly thereafter and the goals of care were
re-addressed. His prognosis and options for further
interventions were discussed with the family. His extremely poor
neurological outcome and risk for life-threatening complications
such as the previous arrythmia were also addressed. After
discussing the options for different types of resuscitation the
family decided to proceed with CMO care. [**Last Name (un) 4247**] services were
offered and the family accepted. They requested that Mr.
[**Name14 (STitle) 75002**] receive his last rights and then be extubated. He was
treated with Morphine PRN as well as a scopolamine patch and
ativan. He died the following afternoon. The family declined an
autopsy.
