IMPRESSION:  Patient is an 83-year-old male with coronary
artery disease, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, ICD
biventricular pacer, now with left IJ thrombosis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Heme.  The patient has a left IJ thrombosis unclear due
to hypocoagulable state or due to sub-therapeutic Coumadin
and clot may be related to pacer wire.  The patient was
evaluated by EP Department who felt that the clot was due to
the pacer placement and not due to hypercoagulable state and
recommended anti-coagulation.  The patient was continued on
Coumadin and was started on Lovenox and had a hypercoagulable
workup which was unrevealing.  In the setting of Coumadin and
Lovenox with an INR of around 4, the patient evolved a
massive gastrointestinal bleed with hematocrit drop to 15.
The patient was started on peripheral fluids as well as a
left femoral cortise insertion with transfusion of 6 units of
blood, 4 units of FFP.  The patient was transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit for management where he required several
additional units of blood and FFP for reversal of the
Coumadin as well as keeping up with the iron blood loss due
to the gastrointestinal bleed.

The patient underwent Nasogastric lavage which showed maroon
returns and passed several melanotic stools.  After reversal
of the Coumadin and with transfusion of blood, the patient
began to have slowing of his gastrointestinal bleed and it
was decided not to pursue further anti-coagulation as the
Deep vein thrombosis was in the upper extremities and was not
likely to embolize the pulmonary embolus.  Also was not
likely to extend along the pacer wire given its current
position.

At time of discharge the patient is not to be placed on
anti-coagulation and this may be revisited in two to three
weeks time.

2.  Gastrointestinal.  As above.  The patient was evaluated
by esophagogastroduodenoscopy which showed initially clots in
the stomach, was re-evaluate with esophagogastroduodenoscopy
again which showed the patient had a gastric ulcer, this was
evaluated again by H. pylori antibody which was negative so
the patient was placed on Protonix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. and was
not treated for infectious etiology for the ulcer.

Re-evaluation with esophagogastroduodenoscopy was done again
as the patient's crit tended to drop slowly over the course
of his hospital stay requiring transfusions about once a week
and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed findings consistent
with watermelon stomach or GAVE.  Treatment for which was
initiated with Argon coagulation.  This will need to be
repeated in three to four weeks time for re-coagulation.
After the procedure the patient was transfused another unit
of blood and his hematocrit has been stable since then.  For
now he is to continue on a proton pump inhibitor and is not
to be started on any anti-coagulation or steroid.

3.  Gout.  In the setting of diuretic use with multiple
components of FFP transfused the patient had a significant
amount of diuretics administered likely causing exacerbation
of his gout in both knees, his feet as well as right wrist
causing severe pain and it was felt by the Rheumatology
consult that helped to inject his joints with steroids, the
left knee was injected for pain relief however, the patient
declined any further injections of steroids.  Fluid analysis
was consistent with urate crystals in the synovium of the
left knee.  Will not be possible at this time to continue
with steroids for the reasons mentioned above in systemic
dosing.  Allopurinol will be continued at 100 mg p.o. q day
for renal dosing.  However, Colchicine will not likely
provide benefit at the small doses that would be given due to
his renal failure.  Similarly NSAIDs would also be
contraindicated due to the renal failure.

4.  Cardiovascular.  The patient did have congestive heart
failure exacerbation due to the significant amount of volume
transfused and was diuresed with 80 mg intravenous b.i.d.
with Lasix with good effect and on discharge, is now sating
significantly better on room air and not feeling
significantly short of breath.  Will continue Lasix at 80 mg
p.o. b.i.d. for outpatient dosing for congestive heart
failure and Enalapril was discontinued due to renal failu
