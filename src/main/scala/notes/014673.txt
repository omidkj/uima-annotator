History of Present Illness:
This is a 74 yo F with PMH significant for DM2, hypothyroid,
restrictive lung disease, OSA, HTN, HL who presented to [**Hospital 882**]
Hospital on [**1-25**] due to hypoglycemia and increased respiratory
distress. During the few days prior to that admission, the
patient c/o increased fatigue, lethargy, and somnolence. At that
time, VNA nurse noticed her FBS to be in the 50-60s. The patient
also had some watery diarrhea up to 3xs per day. The patient
also had recently uptitrated her home O2 to 3L from 2L due to
desats into the 70s.
.
At [**Hospital1 882**], the patient had a CXR that showed increased density
at both lung bases and a right sided pleural fluid. Large pulm
vessels. A TTE showed normal LV thickness, EF 60%, no regional
wall motion abnormalities, septal flattening c/w RV increased
pressure. Est PA pressure is 40mmHg. During the hospitalization,
the patient was kept on BiPap for CO2 in the 90-100, then
weaned. The patient completed a course of Levaquin for CAP. The
patient was initially diuresed, but developed [**Last Name (un) **] and this was
stopped. The patient also was diagnosed with C diff and started
on Flagyl 500mg TID.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient is wearing BiPap. She denies
difficulty breathing or subjective dyspnea. She looks
comfortable.

CXR: IMPRESSION:
1. Enlarged cardiac silhouette with moderate pulmonary edema and
bilateral
pleural effusions, right greater than left, are suggestive of
congestive heart failure.
2. Bibasilar atelectatic changes. However, findings may be
related to
aspiration.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 74 yo F with morbid obesity and recent hospitalization
for PNA who was transfered here from rehab with somnolence [**2-10**]
hypercarbia and a PCO2 114.
.
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Secondary to obesity,
untreated OSA, and possibly obesity/hypoventilation syndrome.
The patient has had multiple presentations similar to this. She
uses O2 at home, but no positive pressure ventilation. The
patient presented with a PCo2 of 114. She was placed on BiPap
20/7 with improved ventilation. However, the patient remained
lethargic. Repeat gas showed a PCO2 of 97. Her baseline is
80-90. Her saturations remained 90-100% even off non-invasive
ventilation. The patient will need BiPap to wear as an
outpatient during naps and at night. Otherwise, she may benefit
from a trach in the future. In addition, she was started on
methylphenidate to improve drive to breath.  She can continue on
supplemental O2 as needed with goal O2 sat >90%, < 95%.  Without
BiPAP, she will continue to present with this same constellation
of symptoms.
.
2. C diff colitis: The patient had a recent diagnosis of C diff
colitis at [**Hospital 882**] Hospital. She is being treated with PO
Flagyl 500mg Q8hrs. The patient will complete a 14 day course of
treatment. Flexiseal to be used ongoing.
.
3. Recent PNA: On her last hospitalization, the patient had BL
conoslidations and was treated with a 7 day course of levaquin.
The patient had no fever or leukocytosis here, so no antibiotics
were started.
.
4. Pulmonary Artery Hypertension: OSH TTE showed PA pressures >
40. This is likely [**2-10**] obesity/OSA. The patient was gently
diuresed and treated with biPap.
.
5. Psych: On celexa, buspar. She intermittently was shouting
incoherently in the MICU, and responded well to zyprexa 5mg PO
PRN.
.
6. HL: On Tricor as outpatient. Here on gemfibrazole. Discharged
on home medication.
.
7. DM2: SSI here. On Humulin at home.
.
8. Leg pain: chronic issues, likely secondary to chronic
peripheral edema. Her pain was treated with tylenol and she
received gentle diuresis.
.
9. HTN: initially diovan and diltiazem held on admisison to ICU,
discharged on diovan, but diltiazem held for time being as want
to add back 1 at a time. Can be restarted as needed in
outpatient setting.
=============================
Transitional issues
# SHE NEEDS BiPAP WHENEVER SLEEPING, AT NIGHT OR DURING THE DAY
# If agitated, she responds well to zyprexa 5-10mg PO x1
# Restart home diltiazem as needed
