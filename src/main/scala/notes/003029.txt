Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
55 F with complicated medical history who has been transferred
from Rehab/[**Hospital3 417**] for dyspnea, acute on chronic renal
failure, volume overload, and fungemia. In [**Month (only) 116**] of this year,
presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED with abdominal pain. Has significant PMHx
for T1DM, HTN, PVD and was found in the ED to have extensive
calcification of her mesenteric arteries. She was taken to the
OR and found to have infarction of her colon with intact small
bowel. She under went a colectomy with iliostomy at that time.
Post op had respiratory failure requiring prolonged intubation
and eventual tracheostomy. The etiology of her respiratory
failure was unclear at her discharge. She was discharged to [**Location (un) 4368**] [**Hospital 21079**] rehab on [**2158-6-1**] after ~30 day hospitalization on
TPN via CVL with tube feeds started. The plan was to advance
tube feeds and wean TPN.
  On [**2158-6-17**], she was still on TPN at rehab and spiked a
temperature up to 103 and blood cultures were positive for yeast
([**Female First Name (un) **] albicans by telephone report but not documented in
transfer records). She was transferred to [**Hospital3 417**] in
[**Hospital1 1474**] for further management. There she was initially given
voriconazole and her central line replaced. Culture from the
line again reportedly grew [**Female First Name (un) **]. She was then switched to
fluconazole and finally to caspofungin today. She was also
treated with ticarcillin/clavulanate for unclear reasons. During
her hospitalization, she also had a "troponin leak" without EKG
changes thought to be demand ischemia by their cardiology
consultants. An echo done on [**2158-6-18**] showed global hypokinesis
with EF 25-30%, dilated LA, LVH, moderated MR, moderate TR,
although image quality was poor. Her hospitalization was also
complicated by hyponatremia of unclear [**Name2 (NI) 10810**].
  Her hospitalization was also complicated by acute on chronic
renal failure (s/p transplant in [**2143**]). She did have episode of
ATN in setting of her mesenteric ischemia with peak Cr of 4.3
with return to her baseline of 1.4-1.8 at time of discharge.
Upon admission to [**Hospital3 417**] her Cr was 3.7 and remained
elevated. It is unclear what work up was done for this. On the
day of admission, she also developed respiratory distress with
increasing volume retention. Attempts at diuresis with Lasix 400
mg IV were unsuccesful. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
management of her fungemia, renal failure and repiratory
distress. Immediately prior to discharge or in the ambulance she
was started on a nitro dip for again unclear reasons.

Brief Hospital Course:
55 YOF with volume overload, dyspnea, renal failure, elevated
WBC, fungemia, chest pain, and hyponatremia; details below.
.
## Fungemia: Patient was diagnosed with fungemia by blood
culture at [**Hospital1 **] and [**Hospital3 417**], likely due to
TPN. Other sources include possible seeding of chronic thrombus
in UE. TTE on [**2158-6-23**] demonstrated no evidence of vegetations.
Ophthalmology eval demonstrated no opthalmic candidemia. Patient
was initially started on PO fluconazole from 6.30.06-7.13.06.
Patient did however continue to spike fevers while on antibiotic
therapy, concerning for a new or resistant infection in the
context of patient's immunosuppresion. Another possible source
was pulmonary since patient's CT chest from [**2158-7-6**] demonstrated
interval development of bilateral pulmonary nodules. Unclear
etiology for bilateral pulmonary nodules. Nodules may have
represented septic emboli from endocarditis, although no
vegetations were demonstrated by echo on [**2158-6-23**] or [**2158-7-11**].
Patient was converted to IV caspofungin on [**2158-7-6**] until
[**2158-7-12**]. During this time, patient remained afebrile and was
converted back to PO fluconazole prior to discharge.
Blood cultures from [**7-23**] had come back positive for yeast and
per ID was switched to caspofungin.  The evening before transfer
to the floor, the patient's HD cath was removed as a possible
site for infection.  She was given a loading dose of 70mg IV and
then given a daily dose of 50mg IV.  She remained afebrile.
Further workup was done to search for the source of the
fungemia.  A renal ultrasound was done which was normal.
Ophthalmology was consulted to evaluate eye grounds and they did
not feel the eye was a source of infection.  A TTE was done
which showed a small (0.7 x0.7 cm) mass attached to the highly
calcified mitral annulus which may be a vegetation or a mobile
piece of calcification coming off the larger mitral annular
calcification.  A follow up TEE was recommended, however the
patient began to have increased emesis and it was unable to be
performed.  ID further recommended the PICC line to be replaced
which was to be done with HD catheter placement.  Cultures from
[**Date range (1) 21081**] remained negative and a urine culture from this time was
negative as well.

## Klebsiella PNA: retrocardiac, pt received 10d of cefepime.
course completed.
.
## Renal Failure: Patient was admitted to MICU initally  and
received hemodialysis which greatly improved mental status.
Renal u/s [**2158-6-23**] showed stable borderline hydronephrosis in the
transplant kidney with elevated resistive indices and CT
ab/pelvis [**2158-6-23**] showed air within the transplant kidney
collecting systems, new from comparison, likely iatrogenic from
foley placement. Then upon admission to the floor, patient had
intractable fluid overload with associated edema and shortness
of breath.
