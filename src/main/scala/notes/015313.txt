Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2782**]
Chief Complaint:
recurrent cholangitis


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP WITH STENT, SPHINCTEROTOMY


History of Present Illness:
65 yo female with hx of CHD stricture s/p multiple ERCPs with
stents and subsequent retrievals presented to [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital
with fevers and abdominal pain suspicious for recurrent
cholangitis.  She presented early this AM with fever to 104 and
RUQ abdominal pain x1 day.  She was admitted to the ICU where
she developed hypotension requiring levophed and phenylephrine.
Labs were notable for WBC 9, with 30% bands, pH of 7.3, and
lactate of 3.0.  Concerning for recurrent cholangitis given
prior recurrent cholangitis, with last episode in [**2146-10-4**].
ERCP was attempted at [**Location (un) 8641**] but they were unable to place the
wire in the stricture so she was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] where her CHD was
stented.  Stent was removed in [**4-15**].  She was given
vancomycin/zosyn, but plan was to broaden to linezolid given VRE
that I discussed with them.  Course today has been complicated
by AMS, she is awake but not communicating.  She developed
altered mental status and required intubation with a 7.5 ett
prior to transfer. KUB did not reveal any current stents.  CVP
was measured at 19 so fluids were decreased to 75cc/hr.  She
received a total of 5L of IVF.  Currently on propofol 80% Peep 5
450x15.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 11894**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] was updated re: transfer.
 She received an additional 1.5L of IVF in flight and her HR was
noted to decrease.

On arrival to the MICU, she intubated and sedated.

Review of systems:  Unable to complete.

   Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2147-9-6**]):    NO GROWTH.

Imaging:
CXR [**2147-8-31**]:
FINDINGS:  There is an ET tube with the tip approximately 4 cm
from the carina as well as a right IJ catheter with tip in the
region of the cavoatrial junction.  There has been improvement
in the right lung base atelectasis, but there has been mild
increase in the left basilar atelectasis.  There is no
pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable with mild
cardiomegaly.
Right hilus is similar in appearance compared to previous film.

IMPRESSION:  Left basilar atelectasis worsening with right
basilar atelectasis improvement.  Monitoring and support devices
still in good position.

CXR [**2147-8-30**]:
FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient
has undergone intubation.  The tip of the endotracheal tube
projects 2.6 cm above the carina.  The patient has also received
a right-sided internal jugular vein catheter.  The tip of the
catheter projects over the cavoatrial junction.  No other
monitoring and
