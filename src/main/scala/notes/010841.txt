Service:  Medicine

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 79 year old
male with a past medical history significant for coronary
artery disease, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, end-stage
renal disease, on hemodialysis, and subdural hematoma
diagnosed in [**2104-6-24**].  The patient was admitted to an
outside hospital for slurred speech and right sided weakness
noted by a health aide following the patient's hemodialysis.
The patient was transferred to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) **] for workup of confusion and fever with his history of
subdural hematoma.  The CT scan showed minimal change in the
patient's known subdural hematoma.  Chest x-ray, however,
showed bilateral consolidation, with gram positive cocci in
the sputum.  The patient was thus dosed with ceftriaxone,
levofloxacin and vancomycin in addition to receiving a one
liter normal saline bolus.  The patient was dialyzed 2.5
liters for concern of fluid overload.  Following
hemodialysis, the patient became hypotensive to the 70s,
tachypneic and diaphoretic with electrocardiographic changes
showing diffuse ST-T wave changes.  The patient was thus
started on Dopamine and given a 750 cc normal saline bolus.
He further required the addition of Neo-Synephrine to support
his blood pressure.  His heart rate subsequently increased
and his ST-T wave changes worsened, so his Dopamine was
stopped and these changes resolved.  The patient was
subsequently seen by cardiology in the Emergency Room and an
echocardiogram was done, and his ischemia was felt to be
consistent with demand ischemia.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery
bypass grafting times four vessels in [**2101**], percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty in [**2097**].
2.  Congestive heart failure, left ventricular ejection
fraction 20% to 25%.
3.  End-stage renal disease, on hemodialysis.
4.  Status post left carotid endarterectomy in [**2100**].
5.  Status post bilateral femoral bypass.
6.  Status post right below the knee amputation.
7.  Subdural hematoma in [**Month (only) 216**] 200, status post drain.
8.  Hypertension.
9.  Hypercholesterolemia.
10. Peptic ulcer disease.
11. History of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient
had a temperature of 101.8, heart rate 80 to 110s,
respiratory rate 24 to 28 and oxygen saturation 97% on
nonrebreather.  General:  Alert, cooperative, tachypneic.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Extraocular movements
intact, pupils post surgical bilaterally, anicteric sclerae.
Neck:  Supple, no lymphadenopathy, no jugular venous
distention.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, normal
S1 and S2, II/VI holosystolic murmur at left lower sternal
border, positive S3 which resolved over this admission.
Lungs:  Coarse breath sounds throughout.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities:
Right below the knee amputation, 2+ left posterior tibialis
pulse, cool, no mottling.  Neurologic examination:  Alert and
oriented times three, strength 4/5 in upper extremities
bilaterally, moved left lower extremity without difficulty.

LABORATORY DATA:  Admission white blood cell count 9.2,
hematocrit 37.5, platelet count 177,000, INR 1.5, partial
thromboplastin time 33.3, sodium 136, potassium 4.6, chloride
92, bicarbonate 26, BUN 48, creatinine 6.4, glucose 147, most
recent white blood cell count 8.2.  CKs have been trending
down, last CK was 38 on [**2107-7-4**], previous CKs 104,
74, and 72.  Vancomycin level from today was 16.1.  Sputum
from [**2107-6-29**] showed greater than 25 polymorphonuclear
neutrophils and 2+ gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters.
 Blood cultures from [**2107-6-30**] ....... and [**2107-6-29**] show no growth to date.  Chest x-ray from [**2107-6-30**]
showed bibasilar consolidation, no congestive heart failure.
The CT scan from [**2107-6-29**] showed a subacute subdural
hematoma, left lateral, slightly increased since [**2104-11-10**] but no herniation and no acute hemorrhage.
Echocardiogram done in the Emergency Room showed inferior,
inferolateral hypokinesis with a left ventricular ejection
fraction of 20% to 25% with 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation,
systolic pressures of 38.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Sepsis:  The patient was admitted with
sepsis presumed secondary to pneumonia.  He was continued on
intravenous levofloxacin and vancomycin during his hospital
stay.  His white blood cell count has remained stable and he
has remained afebrile.  The plan is to continue antibiotics
for a 12 day course of levofloxacin and vancomycin for a
chest x-ray with bibasilar consolidation and a sputum culture
positive for gram positive cocci in pairs in clusters.

2.  Hypotension:  The patient had an acute blood pressure
drop following hemodialysis in the Emergency Room, requiring
pressor support.  He was initially started on Neo-Synephrine
and Dopamine.  The Dopamine was stopped for demand ischemia.
The patient was subsequently changed from Neo-Synephrine to
Levophed and Vasopressin for suspected sepsis as the cause of
his low blood pressure.  He was maintained on these
medications until successfully weaned off on [**2107-7-4**].
His blood pressure has remained stable over the course of
today in addition to his challenge with hemodialysis today.

3.  Cardiac ischemia:  The patient had a positive troponin
leak on admission.  An echocardiogram done in the Emergency
Room, ischemia thought to be secondary to demand ischemia.
CKs were cycled and were trending down.  The patient was
maintained on aspirin and a statin, all chronotropic pressors
were avoided following his diagnosis.  The patient was
carefully bolused to maintain his blood pressure due to the
fact that he is at extreme risk for congestive heart failure.

4.  Pneumonia:  The patient had bibasilar consolidations on
chest x-ray, with sputum culture positive for 2+ gram
positive cocci in pairs and clusters.  He is being maintained
on a 12 day course of levofloxacin and vancomycin considering
his history of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

5.  End-stage renal disease:  The patient was hemodialyzed on
[**7-2**] and 12, [**2106**].  He is regularly dialyzed at Renex
Dialysis Center.

6.  Change in mental status:  The patient was transferred to
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for a change in mental
status.  A neurology consult was obtained and recommendations
were made for an electroencephalogram, which was unrevealing.
There was minimal further improvement in the patient's mental
status following the improvement of his fever.  It is the
opinion of the neurology staff that likely metabolic insult
may have explained the patient's acute mental status.
Discussions with the patient's family revealed that he is at
his baseline, and no further management of his mental status
is indicated.

7.  Code status:  The patient is "Do Not Resuscitate", "Do
Not Intubate".

8.  Communication:  During the patient's stay in the
Intensive Care Unit, the staff have been communicating with
the patient's son and other family members.
