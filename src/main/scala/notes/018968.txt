Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the MICU with septic shock, presumed
secondary to an aggressive pneumococcal pneumonia.
Unfortunately, she succumbed to her illness and passed away
despite aggressive management.

1. Sepsis: The patient was admitted with sepsis presumed
secondary to a pneumonia. She was febrile and hypotensive
throughout her course. The MUST Protocol was activated on
admission. She was aggresively volume resuscitated with lactated
ringer's early in her course and received 10 liters on her first
hospital day to target CVPs of [**11-16**] given that she was
considered quite preload dependent given her severe MR. She
initially required multiple vasopressors including,
norepinephrine, vasopressin, phenylephrine and dobutamine.
Although she stabilized in the middle of her course, requiring
less vasopressor therapy, she soon required more. An initial
ACTH stimulation test was abnormal and she was continued on
Hydrocortisone and Fludrocortisone. Per MUST protocol, and given
her APACHE II score at 28-30, she was commenced on Xigris for a
four day course. Regarding the causative organism, only gram
negative rods were found on her sputum gram stain. No other
culture data was remarkable. She was continued on Ceftazidime,
Vancomycin, and Levofloxacin for broad coverage of gram negative
pneumonia, along with community-acquired pneumonia.
Unfortunately, the patient had a drop in her hematocrit on her
last day admission, which was secondary to a lower GI bleed and
likely secondary to a septic/DIC-like coagulopathy and Xigris
therapy. She then had ventricular fibrillation degenerating into
pulseless electrical activity and ulitmately her death.

3. Resp Distress: Although pnemonia was the main contributing
factor, she also had underlying severe MR, amio toxicity, COPD,
and asthma. She was continued on Albuterol
