Date of Birth:   [**2104-2-16**]       Sex:  F

Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72-year-old female
patient with a long-standing history of peripheral vascular
disease referred for an outpatient cardiac catheterization to
evaluate cardiomyopathy.  The patient was noted to have an
abnormal EKG during a routine office visit.  Follow-up
echocardiography revealed dilated cardiomyopathy of unknown
etiology with an ejection fraction of 15-20%.  She was also
noted at that time to have an inferobasilar aneurysm and was
started on Coumadin.  The patient subsequently had a positive
dobutamine stress echocardiogram which led to cardiac
catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Hypertension.  2.
Hypercholesterolemia.  3. Former cigarette smoker.  4. The
patient has had a totally occluded left internal carotid
artery and two small intracerebral aneurysms which were
reportedly not amenable to surgery.  5. Peripheral vascular
disease.  6. Prior cerebrovascular accidents with loss of
vision in her left eye.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  1. Status post right carotid
endarterectomy in [**2174-12-17**].  2. Status post laser eye
surgery.  3. Status post cesarean section.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  1. Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d.  2.
Trental 400 mg p.o. t.i.d.  3. Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.d.  4.
Coreg 6.25 mg b.i.d.  5. Maxzide 75/50, ?????? tablet p.o. q.d.
6. Coumadin 4 mg q.d.

LABORATORY DATA:  Her laboratory studies upon admission to
the hospital were unremarkable.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent cardiac
catheterization on [**2176-5-1**] which revealed an 80% mid
distal left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion and
occluded mid left circumflex, subtotally occluded mid right
coronary with collaterals, left renal artery with 80%
stenosis and diffusely diseased aorta with an 80% stenosed
right iliac artery as well.  Cardiac catheterization also
revealed left ventricular ejection fraction of approximately
40%.

The patient was taken to the operating room on [**2176-5-2**]
where she underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x 4 with
a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior
descending coronary artery, saphenous vein to the diagonal,
sequentially to the obtuse marginal and saphenous vein to the
posterior descending coronary artery.  Postoperatively the
patient came out of the operating room on milrinone and
Neo-Synephrine IV drip to the cardiac surgery recovery unit,
where she was atrially paced via her epicardial wires.
Neo-Synephrine was readily weaned off.  The patient remained
on a milrinone drip for the next day or so from which she was
ultimately weaned.  The patient was weaned and extubated from
mechanical ventilation on postoperative day one.

On postoperative day two she was noted to be in atrial
fibrillation for which she received IV Lopressor.  This
caused some bradycardia which required atrial pacing via her
epicardial wires.

On postoperative day three the patient's chest tubes were
removed.  The patient remained in the cardiac surgery
recovery unit over the next few days due to some hypotension
requiring IV Neo-Synephrine drip.  On postoperative day five,
[**5-7**], the patient was transferred to the telemetry floor
in good condition off the Neo-Synephrine drip, in normal
sinus rhythm, no longer requiring pacing.  She was beginning
to be diuresed and tolerating that well.  The patient
subsequently has had more episodes of atrial fibrillation
while on the telemetry floor, which were treated with
increasing doses of IV Lopressor, which she has subsequently
tolerated.

On postoperative day seven the patient was ultimately begun
on IV heparin drip and Coumadin was restarted.  Her atrial
pacing wires were removed as she had still had some episodes
of atrial fibrillation at that time.  The patient remained
hemodynamically stable and had been started on her Carvedilol
p.o. which she was on preoperatively.  Amiodarone was
continued due to the atrial fibrillation postoperatively and
she remained in good condition.  The patient had some
intermittent episodes of hematuria for which the heparin was
discontinued.  She remained on Coumadin.

The patient's condition today, on [**2176-5-13**] remains as
follows:  Temperature 97, pulse 70, in normal sinus rhythm.
She has not had atrial fibrillation for a number of days now.
Respiratory rate is 18, blood pressure 128/72, room air
oxygen saturation 93%. Her weight today is 62.1 kg which is
essentially the same as her preoperative weight.  Her most
recent laboratory values reveal a white blood cell count of
7.5 thousand, hematocrit 36, platelet count 262,000, sodium
134, potassium 4.4, chloride 96, CO2 28, BUN 25, creatinine
1.1, glucose 136.  Her INR today is 1.4.  Her most recent
chest x-ray from [**5-12**] shows resolving small bilateral
effusions and left lower lobe atelectasis.

Physical examination shows neurologically the patient is
grossly intact with no apparent deficits.  Pulmonary status
shows decreased breath sounds in her left base, otherwise her
lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Her coronary
examination is regular rate and rhythm.  Her abdomen is
benign.  Her extremities are with trace pedal edema
bilaterally.

2. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
