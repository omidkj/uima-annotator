Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Phenothiazines / Piperacillin Sodium/Tazobactam

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**]
Chief Complaint:
Vomiting.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
NGT placement
A-line placement
PICC-line placement
Endotracheal intubation ([**5-5**])

History of Present Illness:
A 71 year-old woman with past medical history of COPD and MR,
who presented to the ED on the morning of admission with one day
of intractable vomiting. The patient reports that for the last
12-24 hours she has been nauseated and vomiting yellowish,
non-bloody material. She denies associated symptoms such as
abdominal pain, CP, F/C. She believes she last moved her bowels
this morning.

On arrival, initial vitals were HR 118, 155/109, RA O2 sat 88%.
She was placed on NIPPV briefly and her oxygenation improved.
Labs were remarkable for polycythemia (HCT 63) and lactate of
2.3, later noted to rise to 4.1 (question of spurious sample)
before falling to 3.0 in the setting of 10L NS fluid repletion.
A CT scan of her abdomen was performed and demonstrated a high
grade SBO with a transition point in the region of distal
jejunum/proximal ileum, as well as a question of a pulmonary
infarct. The patient was emperically treated with vancomycin,
Flagyl, levofloxacin, SoluMedrol, ASA and antiemetics. The
surgery service was consulted concerning this and advised NGT
placement, supportive therapy and close clinical observation, as
they feel she is a poor operative candidate. The hematology
service was also consulted concerning the pt's polycytemia and
advised ASA, fluids and therepeutic phlebotomy which was
performed with 340cc of blood removed.

On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient is generally comfortable.
She reports some ongoing nausea but again denies abdominal pain.
She states she feels her breathing is at her baseline.

The patient denies fever, chills, weight change or difficulty
swallowing. No chest, jaw or arm pain. No palpitations. No
cough, wheeze or SOB. No urinary symptoms. No dizziness or
weakness.

Past Medical History:
1. COPD - PFTs in [**12/2133**] with FEV1 0.77 (40% predicted), FVC
0.91 (33%) and FEV1/FVC 118%. Spirometry limited by poor patient
cooperation.
2. Mental retardation
3. Bipolar disorder
4. Gastroesophageal reflux disease

Social History:
Patient reports smoking approximately [**1-6**] ppd and has for many
years. She denies alcohol or illicits. She lives independently
at an apartment in JP with visiting assistance and is followed
by the Department of Mental Retardation.

Family History:
Mother lived to her mid-90s then suffered an MI. Father lived to
his mid-70s before dying of natural causes. No other significant
FH.

Physical Exam:
Gen: Uncomfortable appearing adult woman, ill but not in
extremis. NGT in place.
HEENT: PERRL, EOMI. MMM. Conjunctiva well pigmented.
Neck: Supple, without adenopathy or JVD. No tenderness with
palpation.
Chest: Diffuse wheezes and rhonchi.
Cor: Normal S1, S2. RRR. No murmurs appreciated.
Abdomen: Hyperative bowel sounds. Soft, non-tender and
non-distended. No HSM.
Extremity: Warm, with trace edema. 2+ DP pulses bilat.
Neuro: Alert and oriented. CN 2-12 intact. Motor strength intact
in all extremities. Sensation intact grossly.
====================
At the time of discharge:
BP= 112/49-148/95, HR= 103 (93-120), Tmax= 98.7
Pt is sat'ing 90-93% on 4L nasal cannula. He lung fields are
diffusely ronchorous with somewhat decreased BS at the left
base. She is tachycardic generally in the 100-110 range with
frequent ectopy but otherwise regular rhythm.  She has a
fungal-appearing rash over her buttocks bilaterally.  Otherwise
physical exam is unchanged from admission physical listed above.

Imaging Studies:

CT abdomen and pelvis ([**4-29**]):
1. High-grade small-bowel obstruction with a transition point
noted at the approximate junction of the jejunum and ileum with
collapsed loops of distal ileum identified (in the right lower
quadrant, reference series 300a
image 16). No evidence of bowel ischemia or perforation.
2. Multiple nodular opacities within the visualized lung in
addition to a wedge-shaped area of opacification in the right
lower lobe. These findings may be attributed to an infectious
process. However, given the wedge-shaped appearance of the right
lower lobe opacity, pulmonary infarct cannot be excluded.
Follow-up with cross-sectional imaging is recomended to ensure
clearance.
3. Fibroid uterus.

CT chest angiogram ([**4-30**])
1. Negative examination for pulmonary embolism. Main pulmonary
artery is slightly enlarged, which suggests possible pulmonary
hypertension.
2. Rapidly progressing lower lobe consolidations as well as
additional widespread multifocal opacities are likely due to an
evolving pneumonia, possibly secondary to aspiration.
3. Enlarged hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes that are increased
in size compared to study in [**2132**], are likely reactive to the
infectious process. Follow-up CT in three months is suggested to
assess for resolution.

PICC placement ([**5-1**])
Uncomplicated fluoroscopically guided PICC line exchange for a
new 4 French single-lumen PICC line. Final internal length is 45
cm, with the tip positioned in the SVC. The line is ready to
use.

Pelvic ultrasound ([**5-10**]): Limited examination shows abnormally
thickened endometrium for postmenopausal patient, and probable
uterine fibroid. Malignancy cannot be excluded in the setting of
postmenopausal bleeding.

ECHO [**5-18**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect or
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast with maneuvers. The estimated right atrial pressure is
0-10mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2136-5-14**],
the severity of mitral regurgitation has increased slightly. The
estimated pulmonary artery systoocli pressures are higher. A
bubble study demonstrates no apparent intracardiac shunt.
Resting heart rate is higher.

CTA of chest [**5-18**]:
1. Severely limited study secondary to cardiac and respiratory
motion
artifact. Evaluation of the lobar, segmental and subsegmental
pulmonary
arteries is non- diagnostic. No massive central pulmonary
embolus identified.
2. Improving multifocal pneumonia with persistent collapse of
the left lower lobe and partial opacification of the left lower
lobe bronchus. An
obstructing lesion cannot be excluded, and bronchoscopy is
recommended for
further evaluation.
3. Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, likely reactive.
4. Stable mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural
effusions.
5. Stable sternal fracture.
6. Marked trac
