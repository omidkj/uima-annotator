HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 43-year-old
gentleman in his usual state of health until he presented two
days ago with a worsening headache.  The patient was in his
usual state of health until five days prior to admission when
he had the onset of not feeling well which consisted of
tiredness.  No nasal discharge or cough.

On Friday, he had the onset of nausea and mild headaches
described as frontal and throbbing.  At this point, he and
his wife were under the impression that this was a viral
illness.  His headache, however, became worse over the last
couple of days and became constant and more painful.
According to the patient's wife, on the day of admission at
8:00 a.m., the patient was started to make some paraphrasic
errors.

The patient had a LP in the ER which showed a white count of
235, red cells [**Pager number **], tube four had 215 white cells and [**Pager number **] red
cells with 98% polys.  Protein was 51, glucose 61.  He was
given a dose of ceftriaxone.  A CT scan was done which showed
a 1 by 1.5 cm left intraparenchymal hemorrhage at the left
lateral anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and another of 0.5 by 0.5 cm lesion in
the left cerebellum.

His condition deteriorated with increased aphasia and vital
signs became unstable.  At 2:00 a.m. he was noticed to have
an increased blood pressure to 170s and pulse to 130,
temperature maximum was 102.  The patient was started on a
labetalol drip.  He began having difficulty, making somatic
paraphrasic errors and had increasing word-finding
difficulties.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  On admission, he was
fully alert and oriented, increasing with paraphrasic errors
and word-finding difficulty.  Therefore, his examination was
limited.  He moved all extremities with good strength.  He
had normal hearing, normal oropharyngeal movement and
sensation.  His pupils were equal, round, and reactive to
light.  He had no nystagmus.  His tongue was midline.  His
motor strength was [**6-11**] in all muscle groups.  He had no
drift.  Sensation was intact to light touch.  His reflexes
were 2+ throughout.

LABORATORY DATA/OTHER STUDIES:  His white count was 11.9,
sodium 130, K 3.3, chloride 89, glucose 119.

MRI showed multiple foci restricted diffusion bilaterally and
multiple areas of susceptibility in the right cerebellum,
right deep white matter at the level of the lateral [**Doctor Last Name 534**] on
top of the hemorrhages.  No evidence of mycotic aneurysm on
MRA.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  It was felt that despite the fact that the
patient had no murmur and there was no mycotic aneurysm on
MRA, given the history of fever and radiologic presentation,
septic emboli from endocarditis was suspected.  The patient
was pan cultured at that time.

The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit.  The patient had severe left-sided neglect.  BP was
initially 90/100 systolically but was gradually increased to
150s to 160s.

On [**2169-5-22**], the patient was emergently intubated for
decompensating respiratory status.  He was not opening his
eyes, not following commands.  He had positive doll's eyes,
positive corneal reflexes.  He had no movement to
stimulation.  The pupils were 3 down to 2 mm.  The patient
was thought to be postictal versus new hemorrhage.  The
patient had a repeat head CT which showed evidence of a new
hemorrhage.

The patient was taken emergently to the OR for evacuation of
intracranial hemorrhage.  Postoperatively, the patient was
seen by the Cardiology Service.  CPKs were 38 with a troponin
of 6.7.  The patient was thought to have suffered a septic
emboli from endocarditis.

On [**2169-5-23**], the patient opened his left eye halfway to
