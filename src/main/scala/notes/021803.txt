CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypercarbia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 54 year-old female with a
history of congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease
status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2195**], chronic low
back pain, myoclonus, hyperlipidemia, esophageal reflux
disease, anxiety disorder, depression, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] to
the Intensive Care Unit at the [**Hospital1 188**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure of unknown
etiology.  The patient has a history of having these
hypercarbic respiratory failures of greater then five
episodes this past year.  The patient has not had any
significant workup, which has shown any evidence of etiology.
The patient's arterial blood gas prior to intubation at the
outside hospital was 7.25 with a PCO2 of 72 and a PO2 of 53.
An echocardiogram was obtained at the outside hospital, which
showed an EF of 55% with 1+ MR and 2+ TR.  The course in the
unit is significant for close monitoring and subsequent
extubation the day after admission.  The patient's etiology
of hypercarbia was felt to be secondary to over medication
with narcotics and benzodiazepines and pain medications,
which the patient has been chronically taking for her chronic
pains and chronic low back pain.

Of note, the patient was witnessed to have a decreased
respiratory rate and decreased O2 sats with her reported
amounts of pain medications including her Xanax.

coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass
graft in [**2195**], chronic low back pain who was transferred from
[**Hospital3 **] to the Intensive Care Unit at the [**Hospital1 346**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure
of unknown etiology.  As stated in the history of present
illness it was felt that the hypercarbia was a result of over
sedation with her narcotics and benzodiazepines.  Upon
transfer to the floor the patient became agitated and
insisted on leaving against medical advise.  The patient was
told the risks of letting her go as there has been no change
in her medications.  She has not allowed us to better assess
her pain needs at this time.  The patient is aware of the
risks and this was discussed with her husband as well who is
her health care proxy.  The patient was deemed to be very
appropriate and aware of all risks and understanding of her
medical condition.  It was emphasized strongly that the
patient follow up with her primary care physician [**Name Initial (PRE) **] pain
management physician urgently if she continues to insist on
leaving against medical advice.

Th[**Last Name (STitle) 18931**]s discussed with the attending Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as well as with
the legal staff and it was felt that the patient was
competent and capable in making her own decisions.  Follow up
was offered at the [**Hospital1 69**]

wishes.

The patient left against medical advise on [**2201-1-9**]
despite the efforts to convince her and her husband
otherwise.
