History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 31624**] is a 63 yo man w/hx of esophageal CA, who presents
to the MICU now with hypotension, unresponsive requiring
intubation on the medicine floors and melena. Pt was found to be
slightly confused per nursing, nightfloat was called to the room
and pt shortly thereafter became unresponsive and was found to
have a BP of 60's/palp. He maintained a pulse but was intubated
for airway protection. He was noted to have dark red blood from
his G-tube. He also had melena noted in the bed. He was then
transferred to the MICU for further care and monitoring. He
presented to medicine on [**12-7**] with complaints of SOB and was
found to have PE on CTA Pt is a 63 yo man w/hx of esophageal CA
in the 90's, s/p J-tube on [**2105-10-7**]. Pt presents with 3 days of
shaking chills w/SOB; he denies having a fever but noted that
the shaking chills would come on at various times during the
day. He has chronic abd and back pain but htis had not changed
in character. No CP, cough or syncope. He presented to his PCP
who was worried about a possible PE. A CTA was obtained which
showed segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli in superior
segment of right upper lobe and right middle lobe. He was
started on a heparin gtt, and LENI's from [**12-9**] showed no DVT.
Of note, he had a guaiac positive stool on initial presentation
to the ED, but no s/s bleeding on the medicine floors. He had
noted low-grade fevers to 100.1 on [**12-8**], but no fevers in
previous 24hrs.
ROS as above. Unable to obtain complete ROS given unresponsive.

On the floor, pt was intubated, with initial settings of CMV/A
Vt 600, RR 14, PEEP 5, FiO2 100%. He received one unit of blood
overnight, and the second was transfusing on transfer. There was
gross melena in the bed.

IMAGING:
--------
CT chest w/o [**12-7**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli in superior
segment of right upper lobe and right middle lobe.
2. Right lower lobe consolidation/aspiration, less likely
pulmonary infarct.
3. Stable right upper lobe peripheral tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities and
calcified granulomas as compared to [**2105-8-26**].
4. Stable post-surgical changes of esophagectomy and
neoesophageal
reconstruction.
.
Emergent EGD after large-volume bleed ([**12-10**]): Sp Esophagectomy
with neoesophagus and gastrojejunostomy (Roux-n-Y) Large ulcer
with visible vessel seen at the gastrojejunostomy site. No
active bleeding. Diverticulum in the upper third of the
esophagus Otherwise normal EGD to jejunum.
.
2nd EGD done [**12-11**] (day after bleed):One endoclip was
successfully applied for the purpose of radiographic marker. It
was placed at the distal end of the ulcer bed.
.
Head CT [**12-12**]: Atypical appearing hypodense lesions, largest
involving left periatrial parieto-occipital lobe, and smaller
lesions involving bilateral centrum semiovale and possibly also
right frontal lobe and left cerebellum. These are incompletely
evaluated, but concerning for infection or embolic process in a
patient with fungemia, less likely neoplastic. Recommend further
evaluation by MRI if not contraindicated. Coiling of feeding
tube within the oronasopharynx. Recommend repositioning.
.
Echo [**12-16**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal
defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or
saline contras
