Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 51 year old right handed woman with admission
in early [**Month (only) 116**] for unreponsiveness.  Workup at that time was
suggestive of possible PRES.  She was readmitted on [**7-15**] for
evaluation of complaints of worsening of headache, visual
acuity, tremors and imparied cognition.  MRI was repeated which
showed resolution of the previously seen deficits. She had an
episode of hypoxia and was transferred to the MICU on [**7-17**]. On
arrival to the MICU, the patient was minimally responsive and
able to follow some commands but was largely unable to cooperate
with history and physical. 10-20 minutes after receiving a
second dose of Narcan in the MICU, the patient had an episode of
rhythmic twitching which did not appear to be tonic-clonic
accompanied by tachypnea in the high 30's, arching her back, and
worsening mental status with confusion and minimal
response/cooperation. The episode lasted less than 20 minutes
prior to spontaneous resolution. The patient remained confused
and somnolent for 30 minutes following her episode.  A Narcan
drip was given to reverse effects of methadone which was causing
apnea/hypoventilation/hypoxia.  She was placed on biPAP during
this period and her mental status improved dramatically.  She
has been off of biPAP for 24 hours. She also had an episode of
hypotension to the 80s with fever to 101.3 which improved with a
fluid bolus and was started on vancomycin & cefepime on [**7-17**].

Past Medical History:
- COPD, history of multiple exacerbations and recent
hospitalization with intubation
- Hypothyroidism
- Depression

Social History:
The patient lives in [**Hospital1 **], MA. She lives by herself but her
mother, sister, and brother live in an apartment downstairs from
her. She has two daughters (23 and 17 years old). She quit
tobacco 3 years ago after smoking 2 packs a day for
approximately 35 years (70 pack year history). She denies
alcohol use and drug use, although she does have a distant drug
abuse history (reports that she quit 16 years ago).

Family History:
The patient's mother had an extensive tobacco history and had
lung cancer and lymphoma. The patient reports heart disease on
her father's side. Her older brother died suddenly approximately
3 years ago with no autopsy performed. Her maternal grandmother
suffered from a stroke.

IMAGING:

[**7-17**] CXR (Portable):
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant change. Atelectasis at both lung bases. No overt
pulmonary edema. Moderate cardiomegaly. No newly appeared focal
parenchymal opacities. No pneumothorax.

[**7-20**] CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
Rotated positioning. A right subclavian PICC line is present --
the tip
overlies the distal SVC. There is mild cardiomegaly and minimal
atelectasis at left-greater-than-right bases. There is patchy
increased retrocardiac density, probably unchanged allowing for
technique. No CHF, frank consolidation, or gross effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
51 yo F with history of COPD requiring intubation in the past
and recent admission for PRES who was admitted to the Neurology
service for multiple complaints including headache, vision
changes, confusion, and tremor, then transferred to the MICU for
hypoxia secondary to apnea, likely a central process related to
methadone use as it reversed after administration of Narcan.

# Neurologic Symptoms: Neurology was evaluating her for a
primary neurologic process; MRI head was unrevealing. EEG did
not have evidence of seizure activity. Patient will follow up
with neurology as an outpatient regarding headaches, confusion,
and short term memory impairment.  She continued aspirin 81mg
for stroke prevention.

# Hypoxia: Improved, patient was back to room air at discharge
and back to her baseline supplemental home O2 as needed.
Possibly related to decreased respiratory drive from additive
effects of opiates and benzodiazepenes. Underlying COPD likely
contributes to baseline hypoxia as well. Additionally, there is
concern that patient might have central sleep apnea given
witnessed episodes of apnea; she has been ordered for a sleep
study and will need to set up a sleep consultation appointment.

# RLL PNA: Patient was started on vancomycin & cefepime
empirically on [**7-17**] after having spiking a fever in the MICU.
Had PICC line placed and was discharged with a plan to complete
an 8-day course of vancomycin and cefepime.

# Depression/Anxiety: Stable. Restarted alprazolam at lower dose
(1mg TID with 0.5mg [**Hospital1 **]:PRN). Patient is tolerating this well
although she is still very anxious about her sister. She was
also continued on Prozac.

# Chronic Pain:  Patient is prescribed Methadone by her PCP for
chronic neck and back pain. Restarted it at lower dose (30mg
[**Hospital1 **]), which was discussed with her PCP.

# Hypothyroidism:  Neurology recommended lower levothyroxine
dose on admission due to tremor. TSH was lower limit of normal.
She was discharge on levothyroxine at lower dose of 75 mcg/day
(was previously 88mcg daily).

# Thrombocytopenia: Patient was thrombocytopenic on admission,
but platelet count was stable. Hematocrit was also lower than
baseline. Possibly has an element of marrow suppression in the
context of multiple metabolic insults in the past 2-3 months
(including infection, intubation & PRES). PCP will follow up and
refer to hematology as needed.

# Flushing:  Earlier in the admission and prior to admission,
patient had episodes of flushing, diaphoresis, and hot flashes,
observed recently to be accompanied by significant hypertension
at [**Hospital **] Hospital per her sister. In the setting of history of
frequent headaches, this is concerning pheochromocytoma. Can
consider further workup as an outpatient, however symptoms did
not recur while patient was on the medical floor. Patient's
verapamil was initially held as she had an episode of
hypotension in the MICU, however, her pressures were stable
thereafter and verapamil was restarted.

# DVT Prophylaxis: Patient received heparin products during this
admission.

# Code:  Full code.
