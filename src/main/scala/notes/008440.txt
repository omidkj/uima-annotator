CO-SURGEONS:  Drs. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 914**] and  [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

ASSISTANTS:  Drs. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1005**] and  [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 11805**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29316**].

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
1. Symptomatic descending thoracic aortic penetrating
    ulcer.
2. Hypertension.
3. Chronic renal failure on hemodialysis.
4. Peripheral vascular disease status post an
    aortobifemoral bypass graft by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

PROCEDURES:
1. Repair of descending thoracic aortic penetrating ulcer
    with [**Doctor Last Name 4726**] TAG Endo graft 34 x 100 mm.  The [**Doctor Last Name 4726**] graft
    data is the following; catalog number
    [**Serial Number 32337**], lot number  [**Serial Number 32338**].
2. Thoracic aortography.
3. Repair of aortobifemoral bypass graft.

The patient is a 77-year-old gentleman with history of back
pain and thoracic CT scan showed a penetrating
atherosclerotic ulcer with no associated intramural hematoma.
The patient had continued back pain despite good medical
management of his hypertension.  The patient was referred to
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for consideration of repair.  After evaluating
the patient, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] asked me to consider a combined
approach for an Endo graft repair of the descending thoracic
aortic pathology.  The patient understood the risks, benefits
and possible alternatives including but not limited to
bleeding, infection, myocardial infarction, stroke, death,
renal and  pulmonary insufficiency as well as the
possibility of paraplegia and blood transfusion and future
operations on his aorta and agreed to proceed. All questions
were answered to his satisfaction prior to proceeding with the
surgery.

OPERATIVE FINDINGS:  Thoracic aortography in a cross-table
lateral position showed that there was a fairly large
penetrating ulcer in the mid descending thoracic aorta.
Thoracic aortography performed after deployment of the stent
graft showed that there was initially a type 1 Endo leak, but
after additional balloon profiling a repeat thoracic
aortography showed that there was no type 1 Endo leak and
good positioning of the prosthesis and no filling of the
penetrating ulcer.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  After informed consent
was obtained, the patient brought in the operating room and
placed in supine position.  General endotracheal tube
anesthesia was achieved without difficulty as well as full
hemodynamic monitoring. The patient's abdomen, chest and
groins, and upper legs were prepped and draped in the usual
sterile fashion.  A 9-French left femoral venous sheath was
placed for anesthesia due to the inability to place a line in
the neck.  Once this was done the right femoral dissection
was performed exposing the native circulation (common femoral
artery) as well as the right limb of the aortobifemoral both
proximally and distally.  Proximal and distal control was
obtained of the graft in the right groin. The left femoral
artery was then accessed using a micropuncture technique and
a 5-French sheath was placed in the left limb of the
aortobifemoral and a pigtail catheter advanced over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
wire into the descending thoracic aorta under fluoroscopic
guidance.  An 8-French sheath was then inserted after
heparinizing the patient with 5000 units of heparin into the
right limb of the aortobifemoral. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] wire was then
advanced into the descending thoracic aorta, Kumpe catheter
was exchanged over the [**Location (un) **] wire and a stiff Lunderquist
wire was then placed over the Kumpe catheter into the proximal
descending thoracic aorta.  The Kumpe catheter was withdrawn
and serial dilators were then used to dilate the right limb
of the aortobifemoral up to a 24-French dilator.  Initially
we had planned to use a 37 x 100 mm [**Doctor Last Name 4726**] TAG device, however,
the
24-French sheath that was necessary to deliver this would not
advance into the right limb of the aortobifemoral graft and
therefore, we chose to use a 34 x 100 mm graft and the 22-French
sheath was then advanced over the Lunderquist wire into the
right limb of the aortobifemoral bypass graft. Once this was
done the 34 x 10 [**Doctor Last Name 4726**] TAG device was then advanced over the
Lunderquist wire with some difficulty, but ultimately passed
fairly smoothly.  The [**Doctor Last Name 4726**] TAG  device was positioned in the
descending thoracic aorta and aortography was then performed
in the cross-table lateral orientation to observe the
posteriorly directed penetrating ulcer.  Once the ulcer was
identified the TAG device was then positioned so that the
ulcer was in the middle of the device.  We then deployed the
TAG graft and profile ballooned the device with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 32339**]
balloon.  Once this was done, repeat thoracic aortography was
performed which showed a type 1 Endo leak from the proximal
seal zone, we therefore profile ballooned the proximal
landing zone several times and repeated the thoracic
aortography which revealed that there was no evidence of an
Endo leak at this time.  All catheters and sheaths were then
removed from the right limb of the aortobifemoral graft and
the graft was then closed with a running 5-0 Prolene stitch.
The left-sided femoral sheath was then removed. The patient
was then taken to the cardiothoracic surgical intensive care
unit in stable condition.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] were co-surgeon's on this case
