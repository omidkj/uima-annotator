[**Doctor Last Name 1181**] INTERN TRANSFER NOTE:

24yo F who normally resides in an inpatient psych facility for
history of impulsive behavior was admitted to MICU after eating
two pieces of glass. For full H+P please see MICU admit note.
Briefly on the day of admission patient ate two pieces of glass
in an impulsive gesture. She denied suicidality. She was
admitted to the hospital and underwent an EGD which showed no
glass in stomach. She did have antral erosions without bleeding.
CT scan of the abdomen showed glass in colon, however, as glass
is not always radio-opaque it is unclear if there are other
pieces of glass in the abdomen not seen on imaging so it is
unclear if all pieces of glass have been found. Surgery was
consulted and recommended an aggressive BM regimen and to make
sure glass passes. Although has had several BMs, hasn't passed
glass yet.

In addition, while the patient was in the MICU psych was
consulted given the impulsive behavior. They recommended a few
medication changes and their ultimate plan is to place her in
long-term inpatient psych facility although this plan has not
been discussed with the patient.
 On presentation to the floor patient had no complaints of
abdominal pain. She was hungry.

Imaging:
CT ABD [**7-9**]:
1. Triangular-shaped radiopaque 19-mm foreign body in the mid
ascending
colon, compatible with given history of ingested glass. No
additional
radiopaque foreign bodies are seen along the course of
gastrointestinal tract,
however not all glass is radiopaque, and correlation with
clinical history is
recommended. No free air, no free fluid.
2. Tiny nonobstructing right renal calculus.

KUB [**7-10**]:
No radiopaque foreign body is seen

EGD:
Impression: Careful inspection of the esophagus, stomach, and
duodenum did not reveal any foreign bodies (i.e. glass). There
was some lineaer erosions in the antrum. There was some oozing
of fresh blood noted at the GE junction after pt attempted to
pull scope out; likely minor scope trauma.
Erosion in the antrum
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 24 year old female with past psych history who is
admitted to the MICU for monitoring after ingestion of glass.
.
Glass ingestion.  Patient was found to have ingested glass while
residing at an inpatient psych facility as an impulsive (but not
suicidal act).  A KUB and CXR did not reveal the object, but it
was visualized in the colon on a CT abd/pelvis.  GI was unable
to locate glass on upper endoscopy but did visualize linear
erosions.  Patient was placed on an aggressive bowel regimen.
Surgery was following the patient.  The pt was transfered to the
medical floor where she continued on her bowel regimen, however,
the glass was not visualized in her stool. A repeat CT abdomen
did not reveal any evidecne of retained glass. Pt was started on
pantoprazole 40 mg [**Hospital1 **].  She should continue this medication for
4 weeks.
.
Psychiatric illness.  Patient's glass ingestions was reportedly
an impulsive behavior.  Patient is known to have bipolar,
schizoaffective, asbergers.  Haldol, ativan, and prozac were
continued but the haldo was eventually changed back to her home
dose of flufenozine 2.5 mg.  Psych and social work were
consulted.  Patient was monitored with aa 1:1 sitter to prevent
ingestions of other foreign bodies.  After the pt was medically
cleared the Best team was consulted to aid in Pt transfer back
to [**Location (un) 22870**] inpatient Psychiatric unit.
.
gait instability.
Pt complained of left leg pain after a fall off a tree 1 month
ago.  No deformities of left leg were noted, but leg internally
rotated (Pt has hx of hip dysplasia).  Pt able to ambulate, and
evaluated by physical therapy who recommended use of rolling
walker for unsteady gait if allowed at group home/inpatient
psych.  Pt requested referel to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 46850**] in Fallmouth for her
leg.  She states that her guardian recommended this doctor.  Pt
should be seen by primary care physician for this referral.
.
tachycardia.
EKG showed simus tachycardia.  She also had a non gap acidosis.
It was thought that her tachycardia was from dehydration caused
by the aggressive bowel regimen.  She was rehydrated with IV
fluids, and orthostatics were checked which were negative.  The
pt remained tachycardic so it was then thought that the
tachycardia was from her recently started fluphenozine.  Her
fluphenozine was stopped and she was switched back to haldol 2
mg [**Hospital1 **].  The day of discharge she had a HR of 88.  She should
continue to take haldol until she can follow up with her primary
care Doctor/psychiatrist.
