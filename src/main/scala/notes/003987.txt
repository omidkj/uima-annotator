History of Present Illness:
87 yo female with Alzheimer's dementia, DM, h/o aspiration,
hypothyroid, hyperlipidemia, CHF with recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**]
[**Location (un) 620**] for DKA in setting of UTI ([**12-22**]), who presented to [**Hospital1 18**]
[**2191-1-26**] after being found unresponsive at her NH, with marked
hyperglycemia (FSG>500, given 16U regular + 30U NPH insulin),
and sent to [**Hospital3 **].  On [**Location (un) 620**] ED admission, patient
had VS of  T=99.8, BP 54/28, pulse 130, rr30, and was 94% on a
NRB. Her ABG was 6.91/22/95, with a lactate of 10.4. She
received a further 10U of insulin and was begun on an insulin
drip.  She also started on neosynephrine, given 2 amps of sodium
bicarbonate, tylenol, and empirically begun on levofloxacin.
She was intubated (#7 ETT) and subsequently transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**]. Upon arrival at [**Hospital1 18**]: her vitals were BP 75/40, pulse
110, and was on mechanical ventilation  (AC 500/25/1/5)  with
ABG 7.20/22/386. Labs were notable for a leukocytosis (WBC
16.3), Anion gap of 23, and an elevated Tn T 1.43. Pt was
switched from neo to dopamine and dobutamine. A L IJ central
line was placed and she was transferred to ICU after receiving
3L NS in ED.

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU course was notable for resolution of her DKA on insulin
drip, with reinitiation of NPH insulin [**1-30**].  Her BP was
supported with saline and pressors, and she has a net fluid
balance of +11 liters for her length of stay.  She was
successfully extubated [**1-29**].  Patient noted to have elevated
cardiac enzymes, with Ck max of 4126, Ck-MB of 113, and MB index
of 2.7, and Troponin T, with maximum of 4.48 [**2191-1-27**].  Bedside
echocardiogram demonstrated nl LV systomlic function (EF>60%),
with 1+ AR and mild LVH.  She was noted to have a transaminitis,
with ALT maximum of 200, AST maximum of 361, though alkaline
phosphatase and bilirubin were normal.  A CT of the
Abdomen/Pelvis was notable for diverticulosis without evidence
of diverticulitis, multiple peripheral diffusion perfusion
defects in the spleen, possibly infarcts (age indeterminate) and
pericholecystic fluid with strong enhancement of the gallbladder
wall, raising the possibility of cholecystitis.  However, RUQ
ultrasound revealed cholelithiasis without evidence of
cholecystitis, and a gallbladder (HIDA) scan revealed normal
gallbladder, without evidence of cholecystitis.  CT of the head
was negative for any cute process.  She has been maintained on
empiric antibiotics, including vancomycin, Unasyn, levofloxacin
and flagyl empirically, with decrease in WBC from a maximum of
27.  Patient was transferred from the ICU to the floor [**1-30**].

Remainder of her hospital course:

DM - patients blood sugars remained well controlled on a regimen
of NPH twice daily.  She was however not eating (see below).

Aspiration - Ms [**Known lastname **] was unable to cooperate with a speech and
swallow evaluation, and upon empirically advancing her diet to
pureed solids and nectar thickened liquids, she was witnessed to
aspirate.  She was kept NPO until [**2-4**], when the decision was
made by her Durable Power of Attorney (following court hearing)
to change the goals of her care to Comfort Measures Only.  As
such, we have attempted to reinitiate her diet as tolerated.
The decision was made by her Power of Attorney not to proceed
with PEG or PEJ tubes.

CHF- She was initially aggressively diuresed after leaving the
ICU, given hypoxia secondary to CHF.  However, as her PO intake
was limited by aspiration as above, attempts to continue
diuresis were limited by intravascular depletion from poor PO
intake and hypoalbuminemia.  Oral medications had been held
(including ACE, Beta-blocker), and as she is now CMO,
medications have been discontinued.

Transaminitis - was likely second
