Allergies:

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2597**]
Chief Complaint:
Gangrene of the right fourth toe.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
A jump graft from femoral anterior tibial vein graft to dorsalis
pedis artery with non reversed lesser saphenous vein and right
fourth toe open amputation.


History of Present Illness:
This 48-year-old lady with juvenile diabetes
and long history of peripheral vascular disease has
previously undergone a right femoral anterior tibial bypass
to the proximal anterior tibial artery. She subsequently
developed 2 episodes of recurrent ischemia in her right foot
with a patent graft, and was found to have disease in her
anterior tibial artery [**First Name3 (LF) 22594**] to the vein graft, but proximal
to the dorsalis pedis artery. This area has been
angioplastied twice due to severe ischemia of her foot. The
second time we did it we decided to revise this with a
bypass, since the recurrence rate of stenosis between the 2
episodes was quite short. She has gangrene of her toe and
requires toe amputation at the same time

positive (TnT 0.16 with CPK 94), and cardiology was consulted on
[**1-17**], and pt was taken to cath lab for intervention. Cath showed
diffuse severe disease of LMCA, LAD, LCx, RCA. SVG to RCA was
patent with [**Month/Year (2) 22594**] RCA which had 90% lesions in the PLB
unchanged from previous angiography. LIMA to LAD was patent.

with a Genesis stent and the final residual was 0% with normal
