[**Hospital **] MEDICAL COMPLAINT:  The patient in an MVC.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 51 year-old male who
had an MVC into a building.  The patient was restrained, was
unresponsive except to painful stimuli upon presentation to the
emergency room. He required 2 units of blood transfused while in
the trauma bay. He had emesis. Patient is Portuguese speaking. At
the time of presentation to the emergency department the patient
had unknown allergies, unknown medical history, unknown family
history, unknown medications and unknown past surgical
history.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His vitals on presentation was heart
rate in the 120s, blood pressure 100/palp. Breath sounds at
82. Patient was intubated. Bilateral chest tubes were placed.
He had altered mental status, GCS of 13. He had a scalp
laceration. He was intubated in the emergency room. Lungs
were clear. There were broken ribs on the right noted when
placing the chest tube in. His abdominal examination was
obtained which was negative. He had normal tone upon his
rectal examination, which was guaiac negative.

LABORATORY DATA:  Upon presentation to the emergency
department, white count of 18.0, hematocrit 29.8 with a
platelet count of 220. His chem-10 was normal as well as his
coagulations. His alcohol level was 125 on presentation. Amylase
was 69 and fibrinogen 161. CT of chest was obtained upon
presentation to the emergency department. Trauma film was
obtained which showed widening mediastinum secondary to
rotational differences. An extremely limited pelvis due to the
fact that the patient was moving while the images were taking
place. The CT of cervical spine was also obtained which showed a
fracture of the right transverse process of C7 with questionable
extension to the right lamina. The fracture fragments were only
minimally displaced with mild narrowing of the neuroforamen at
that level. There was no extension of the vertebral artery canal.

Patient also was noted to have small apical right
pneumothorax and emphysematous changes of the lungs
bilaterally. A CT of head was also obtained in the emergency
department which was notable for no evidence of intracranial
hemorrhage. CT of pelvis was then obtained while in the
trauma bay. Patient was noted to have a right small apical
anterior inferior pneumothorax, status post chest tube
placement on the right. Atelectasis versus contusion of the
posterior right lung. Mild emphysematous changes along the
upper lobes bilaterally. An x-ray of the patient's right hand
was conclusively normal without any evidence of fracture.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was then admitted to the trauma
service under Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. He was admitted to the trauma
surgical Intensive Care Unit for evaluation. Follow up chest
x-ray was obtained on the [**2114-11-19**] for interval
changes of his pneumothorax and placement of the endotracheal
tube. There was relative [**Name (NI) 70433**] of the right upper
quadrant of the abdomen and sharp demarcation of the medial
right hemidiaphragm which would correspond to a basilar
pneumothorax on CT of torso. A neurosurgery consult was
obtained while the patient was in the trauma bay for his
cervical fracture. The patient was then placed on a cervical
collar and is to remain so for several weeks (6 to be exact)
in which case he is to follow up in the neurosurgery clinic.
Plastic surgery was also consulted for his right hand
laceration in which there was no evidence of fracture.
Plastic surgery service subsequently signed off. Patient
remained in the trauma and the neurosurgical Intensive Care
Unit for several days from [**11-18**] until [**2114-11-29**]. Patient did relatively well. His bilateral chest tubes
were removed without incident during his time in the trauma
Intensive Care Unit. There were no complications from such.
In addition an additional chest tube was placed in the
patient's anterior wall of the left lung due to the fact that
on placement of the chest tube in the emergency department it
was noted that the patient's lung was highly fibrotic to the
chest wall and we were concerned for noncommunication between
the placement of the original chest tube and the
pneumothorax. The patient tolerated this well without any
evidence of increased pneumothorax. He was placed on suction,
2 chest tubes to the left, 1 chest tube on the right for
several days. On the third day after placement of the third
chest tube all the chest tubes were subsequently removed, 1
each additional day while the patient was in the trauma SICU.
There was, however, noted to be a CT scan of the patient
chest which was accomplished on [**2114-11-28**] which
showed a small loculated pneumothorax, a small pig-tail tube
was placed in the patient's chest along the second
intercostal space on the left. The patient tolerated this
procedure well without any complaints. This pig-tail was then
subsequently placed to suction for a total of 5 days and was
removed. Chest x-ray following removal of this showed no
evidence of a pneumothorax. Patient had minimal output of
blood from the chest tube. The patient was also due to an
incident in the trauma bay in which a resident was lacerated
after removing glass from the patient's scalp. The resident
received a laceration and an HIV work up was obtained. The
patient was noted to be HIV positive with a viral load
greater than 100,000 and a CD4 count of less than 100. An ID
consult was then obtained on the [**11-29**] in which
case the patient was started on [**Doctor Last Name **] therapy for his HIV and
was begun on prophylaxis of PCP pneumonia which included
azithromycin and Bactrim. The patient was also started on
ciprofloxacin. It was noted with talking with the patient at
this time that a history of a pneumococcal empyema requiring
2 surgeries 2 years ago and 2 lymph node biopsies. The
patient was also noted to have a history of asthma,
alcoholism, depression, post herpetic neuralgia, steroid
dependence and questionable thrush and questionable adrenal
insufficiency. After several days in the trauma Intensive
Care Unit the patient was then moved to the floor for further
evaluation which was done on [**2114-11-30**]. The patient
obtained PT/OT evaluation in which it was noted that patient
had unstable gait. Started on [**Doctor Last Name **] therapy and had a pig-tail
to suction which was removed on the [**12-3**] on the
floor. Patient remained afebrile until the [**12-4**]
where it was noted that he had temperatures of 101.9.
Cultures were obtained. A urine culture was noted to have E
coli with greater than 100,000 per colony. Patient was then
started on ceftriaxone 1 gram q 24 for treatment of his
urinary tract infection empirically. On speaking with the
infectious disease consultation it was agreed upon to have
the patient on ceftriaxone for 3 days. On the [**12-6**] the patient passed his PT evaluation and is cleared
to go home.

Additional films of the patient's hands were also obtained in
this time which again showed no fractures of his wrist or his
humerus, his elbow or his shoulder. This was done due to the
fact that patient was complaining of pain on the right side
of his hand. The patient is being discharged home. His white
count is currently 6.7 with a hematocrit of 23.5 and a
platelet count of 538. The patient did not require any
transfusions during his hospitalization in this hospital. CD4
count was noted to be 66 with a  CD8 count of 1465 with a
CD4/CD8 ratio of .1. The patient had no surgical intervention
during his hospital course here.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is afebrile today. Vital signs
stable. Lungs are clear. Heart rate showed regular rate and
rhythm. No murmurs, rubs or gallops. Abdomen is soft,
nontender, nondistended. Right hand is decreased swelling,
good range of motion. Patient is awake, alert and oriented
x3. He is ambulating and doing well.

He is being discharged on Tylenol, Colace, senna, Percocet,
