Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
transferred from [**Hospital1 3278**]; initially presented for urinary
retention and back pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 3443**] is a 75 yo Cantonese-speaking man with h/o AFib, HTN,
COPD and metastatic nasopharyngeal CA with known liver mets, who
presented to [**Hospital1 3278**] for urinary retention and back pain. He is
currently on Day 13 of cycle 2 of cisplatin and gencytabine. MRI
of the spine showed no cord compression but lesions at C7, T10
and T12. He had 1.5L UOP with placement of the foley (per
discharge summary, retention reportedly started in the evening
of [**2-9**]). He did not receive morphine or compazine for pain [**3-4**]
effects of urinary retention. history on the patient is limited
due to language barrier (have not been able to contact
interpreter yet).
.
He was a direct floor transfer. VS on arrival to the floor were
96.5, 112/70, 118 - 140 in Afib, 96% on RA. The patient was on
his feet wlaking to the bathroom to urinate (though had a foley)
when I met him.

CT HEAD [**2166-2-12**] - 1. No intracranial hemorrhage or major
vascular territorial infarction identified. 2. Large soft tissue
mass within the nasopharynx, with associated osseous destruction
as detailed, which is incompletely imaged and characterized
without IV contrast. If there is concern for intracranial
metastases or an acute infarct, an MRI with gadolinium is
recommended.

MR/MRA BRAIN [**2166-2-12**] - 1. Acute/subacute left pontine infarct
associated with high-grade stenosis of the basilar artery. 2.
Large poorly-defined enhancing mass within the nasopharynx with
permeation and destruction of the clivus with associated
cervical adenopathy, better visualized on the recent neck MRI.
3. 3 mm right ophthalmic aneurysm. 4. Markedly irregular right
posterior cerebral artery with high-grade segmental stenosis.

VIDEO SWALLOW STUDY [**2166-2-14**] - Barium passed freely through the
oropharynx and esophagus without evidence of obstruction. There
was gross aspiration with multiple consistencies of barium
including thin, nectar, and pudding. For details, please refer
to the speech and swallow division note in the online medical
record.


Brief Hospital Course:
#. URINARY RETENTION, NEW SPINAL METS: Patient was transferred
for evaluation of urinary retention because all of his care is
at [**Hospital1 18**].  He was transferred with foley in place with good
output and no evidence of acute renal failure.  There is concern
for metastatic disease to spine given MRI findings at OSH prior
to transfer, however there report with no sign of cord
compression.  Urine output was adequate with the foley and no
evidence of renal failure on labwork.  Urinary retention work-up
was deferred pending the development of stroke and Afib with
RVR.  (see below)

# ACUTE/SUBACUTE LEFT PONTINE INFARCT - Mr. [**Known lastname 3443**] developed right
sided weakness and confusion shortly after arrival to [**Hospital1 18**].
CODE STROKE was initiated.  Neurology consult felt that exam was
extremely difficult to interpret in setting of no interpreter
available, however was notable for confusion, disorientation vs.
aphasia and weakness in RUE w/o signs of UMN disease at time of
evaluation. NIHSS score was 8.  CT HEAD was done due to
patient's inability to lie flat for a prolonged period and
showed no intracranial hemorrhage or major vascular territorial
infarct identified.  Patient underwent ROMI thich was negative,
UA was negative for UTI.  Started aspirin.  Patient was
transferred to MICU due Afib with RVR.  Mr. [**Known lastname 3443**] then underwent
MRI/MRA under sedation which showed acute/subacute left pontine
infarct.  He was started on heparin for anticoagulation.  Mr.
[**Known lastname 3443**] continued to be confused/disoriented after transfer from the
Unit to the floor.  Discussion with the family at that time
about goals of care resulted in change of code status to DNR/DNI
due to poor prognosis.  Video swallow on [**2166-2-14**] showed
aspiration with all levels of consistency.  Family refused PEG.
Ultimately, patient clinically deteriorated in setting of no PO
intake, recent stroke with aspiration on video swallow, and afib
with RVR requiring diltiazem infusion.  He was likely aspirating
his secretions.  On [**2166-2-16**] a discussion regarding goals of
care was again initiated and patient was placed on comfort
measures only.  Mr. [**Known lastname 3443**] passed away the evening of [**2166-2-16**].

# Atrial Fibrillation with RVR - Patient was noted to be in
atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response after
arrival from OSH.  He was given IV Diltiazem for rate control
without success.  He was trans
