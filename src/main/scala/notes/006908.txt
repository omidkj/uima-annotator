Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**]
Chief Complaint:
Febrile neutropenia and meropenem desensitization




Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cycle 13 of decitabine


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 59-year-old gentleman with a history of
myelodysplastic syndrome with acceleration to AML s/p
clofarabine induction therapy with prolonged remission then
recurrence, s/p 12 cycles of decitabine, presenting with febrile
neutropenia for meropenem desensitization in the ICU.
.
The patient was recently discharged on [**2119-3-11**] after his 12th
cycle of decitabine, with hospitalization complicated by mild
tumor lysis.  He was supported with pRBC and platelet
transfusions.  Upon his return visits to clinic for the last 2
days, he has required further platelet/RBC transfusions for plt
counts of <10, Hct<30, with appropriate bumps to transfusions
(Plt 6 --> 50 this AM).  He called the BMT fellow on-call to
report a fever to 101.4.  He did not have any symptoms prior to
taking his temperature, and states that he normally measures his
temperature twice a day, per instructions from his oncologist.
His most recent ANC is 84 (on [**2119-3-12**]).  He was instructed to
report to the ED for further work-up.  He also states that he
has been having some nosebleeds recently that result in him
coughing up some blood, which he feels is definitely not from
his lungs.  He has also noticed bruising all over his body.
Prior to transfusions, he has been receiving Benadryl and
Tylenol, which he did receive the morning prior to admission
before getting his platelets.  He did remark that he has
occasional episodes where he feels like his "throat is closing",
which makes him panic and his blood pressures acutely rise.
This all resolves within 8-10 minutes.  He has also been using
his home O2 more around the house within the past 1 month.
.
Of note, the patient has extensive antibiotic allergies and he
is being followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2602**] [**Name (STitle) 2603**] of Allergy/Immunology who
has made a number of recommendations.  He is able to tolerate
Daptomycin and Clindamycin.  However, if broader coverage is
needed (Aztreonam or Meropenem), he must undergo a
desensitization protocol in the ICU.  In [**2119-10-4**], he
underwent a successful meropenem sensitization after developing
a drug-induced hypersensitivity rash while on Cefepime.
Linezolid desensitization has been unsuccessful in the past.
Cefepime and allopurinol should be completely avoided.  He also
strongly recommended standing doses of H1 and H2 blockers
(diphenhydramine 25 mg q6h or hydroxyzine 25mg PO q6h +
famotidine 20 mg q12h) and to continue these agents through the
length of his antibiotics.
.
In the ED, VS: 96.4, 102, 140/68, 18, 2L 94% (home oxygen).  The
patient does not endorse any localizing signs or symptoms.
Blood culture was drawn from his portacath, U/A and urine
culture done, but they were unable to draw peripheral cultures
prior to receiving his 1st dose of Daptomycin 450mg.  Received
Tylenol 650mg and 1L NS.  Labs are notable for WBC 1.6 with 4%
neutrophils and 5% blasts, Hct 25.5, Plt 25, Cr 1.2 (baseline
0.9-1.0), and lactate 0.9.  U/A clear. CXR shows an infiltrate
in the posterior RLL, seen best in the lateral view.
.
In the ICU, he is quite comfortable on 2L O2 without any
complaints.
.
ROS: (+) per HPI, (-) for fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea/constipation, chest pain, SOB (above baseline),
abdominal pain, dysuria, headaches, blurry vision, dizziness,
LOC.


Past Medical History:
Oncologic history:
Patient initially presented in [**2119**] with easy bruising
and dropping cell counts (pancytopenic) as well as some
SOB/fatigue. BMBx was consistent by report with myelodysplastic
syndrome with presence of a 15-20% immature cells consistent
with blasts; Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] felt the pathology was consistent with
MDS with excess blasts in transformation, suggesting
acceleration of the disease towards acute leukemia.
.
Pt underwent induction and reinduction with single [**Doctor Last Name 360**]
clofarabine per protocol 07-013, last treated in 09/[**2116**]. Since
that time, he showed signs of dysplasia was dropping cell lines
and bone marrow biopsy done in [**9-/2118**] showed blasts occurring
in small clusters occupying an estimated 20% of the marrow
cellularity. Cytogenetics showed deletion of the long arm of
chromosome 20 and he was treated on [**2118-9-19**] with his first
cycle of decitabine. He has completed 12 cycles of decitabine,
with the 8th cycle complicated by pneumonitis and deterioration
of lung function, requiring home oxygen use. He has previously
opted not to undergo allogeneic stem cell transplant due to
quality of life desires.
.
