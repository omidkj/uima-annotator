Brief Hospital Course:
HD#1: [**2145-11-7**] The patient was admitted to the trauma surgery
service, received a neurosurgical consult, and was moved to the
trauma SICU. He received methylprednisolone for his spinal cord
injury.  A CT of his cervical spine showed C5-6 anteriolisthesis
with unilateral jumped right facet and contralateral fracture
thru c5 and c6 lateral masses, with c6 fracture extensing
through vertebral canal.  An MRI/MRA of his head and neck showed
cord edema at C5-6.  A CTA showed loss of the left vertebral
artery in proximity to C5/6 fractures with reconstitution at
higher levels.  In addition, and abdominal CT showed left lower
pulmonary lobe with atelectasis versus pneumonia.

HD#2: [**2145-11-8**] The patient had a cervical angiogram which showed
thromboses of his left vertebral artery.  After the angiogram he
went to the OR for:
1. Open reduction of the facet dislocation.
2. Anterior diskectomy at C5-6.
3. Anterior fusion C5-6.
4. Instrumentation C5-6.
5. Structural allograft.
6. Cranial [**Doctor Last Name **] application and removal

POD#1: [**2145-11-9**] pt did well

POD#2: [**2145-11-10**] Hct dropped from 27.7 to 23.9.  He was
transfused 2 units of pRBC and remained hemodynamically stable
and intubated.

POD#3/0: [**2145-11-11**] The patient was stable enough to return to the
OR for:
1. Posterior fusion from C4-C6.
2. Posterior cervical interspinous wiring.
3. Right iliac crest bone graft, bicortical graft.

POD#[**2-25**]: [**2145-11-12**] The patient did well post-operatively.  He was
started on a heparin drip with a PTT goal of 40-50 for the left
vertebral artery thrombosis.  He was weaned from the ventillator
without complications and a chest x-ray showed a worsening right
lower lobe opacity.  The patient was transferred from the trauma
SICU to the neuro step down unit.

POD#[**3-28**]: [**2145-11-13**] The patient's white blood cell count rose from
13.2 to 15.6 and sputum cultures were obtained.  The patient was
started empirically on lovenox.

POD#[**4-29**]: [**2145-11-14**] The patient did well, was afebrile, with
increased mobility of all extremities, but had an increase in
his white blood cell count from 15.6 to 18.4.

POD#[**5-30**]: [**2145-11-15**]   The patient had a swallow study which
recommended a diet consisting of: soft/moist solids and thin or
nectar thick liquids, medications crushed in puree, no mixed
consistencies (like soup with pieces of solids or cold cereal
with milk).

POD#[**7-1**]: [**2145-11-16**] The patient had a repeat angiogram of his
vertebral arteries which was unchanged from the prior study.  He
spiked a fever to 101.3F, and his sputum culture grew gram
negative rods and beta streptococcus. Zosyn was started and the
levoquin was discontinued. His white blood cell cound decreased
from 21.0 to 17.6.  A chest x-ray showed improvement in the
right lower lobe opacity.

POD#[**8-2**]: [**2145-11-17**] The patient again spiked a fever to 101.4F and
his white blood cell count rose slightly to 18.3.

POD#[**9-2**]: [**2145-11-18**] The patient was doing well, afebrile, white
blood cell count 22.4, and he was on zosyn day 3 of 14.  His
coagulation studies were PTT 56.9 and INR 1.2.

The patient was discharged to [**Hospital3 7665**] in [**Hospital1 3597**], NH.  He
was continued on zosyn x 11 days, coumadin, and heparin drip
until his INR reached therapeutic levels.  The rehab was to
continue chest physical therapy, physical therapy, occupational
therapy.  The patient was to remain anticoagulated to 3 months
and then to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] for a repeat angiogram.
