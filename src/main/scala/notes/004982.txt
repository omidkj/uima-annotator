Conclusions
Pre-CPB:
Patient rushed to OR from EW with Type A dissection.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate
global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is markedly dilated A mobile density is seen
in the ascending and descending aorta and arch, consistent with
an intimal flap/aortic dissection.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Post Circ Arrest for hemi-arch and ascending aorta replacement:
The patient is AV paced, on phenylephrine.
Good LV systolic fxn. Improved RV systolic fxn. No MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].

Brief Hospital Course:
Went emergently to the OR for Type A repair with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
Transferred to the CVICU in stable condition on titrated
nitroglycerin and propofol drips. Afib treated with amiodarone.
Extubated on POD #3 and then reintubated for respiratory
distress.
DCCV attempt was unsuccessful on POD #4. Plan for patient to
undergo tracheostomy / PEG placement due to prolonged dependence
on the ventilator on [**11-3**]. However, in the evening of [**2188-11-2**]
the patient sudddenly became bradycardic and eventually
asystolic. A line tracing became a flat line and she had no
palpable pulses or bood pressure. Code was called and
resuscitation efforts began immediately with chest compressions,
fluid, epinephreine (9 amps), atropine (4 amps), bicarbonate (5
amps). Hyperkalemia treated with insulin (10 units IV) and one
amp of D50. Multiple amps of calcium also given, epi and
Levophed drips initiated. Multiple attempts to externally pace
or to pace with the existing epicardial wires failed. Attending
surgeon, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was immediately contact[**Name (NI) **] at the
beginning of these events. Chest opened by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7772**]: no
evidence of bleeding, tamponade or pneumothorax. PEA remained
unresponsive to resuscitation measures and patient expired at
19:11 pm after approximately 55 minutes or resuscitative
efforts.
