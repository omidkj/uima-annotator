History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 2450**] [**Known lastname 6930**] is a 63 year old woman with a past medical
history significant for COPD, dCHF, AF/MAT, OSA on CPAP, DM 2,
CAD admitted for respiratory distress.  The patient initial
presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] Pulmonary Clinic from her ALF today, and
was found to be lethargic with an SaO2 of 84%RA that improved to
95%3L nc.  Per the Pulmonary note and discussion with the
patient's ALF, she had been complaining of increased dyspnea on
exertion that progressed to dyspnea at rest with worsening
orthopnea and associated fatigue. In addition, she reported a
productive cough, worse than baseline.  Per her ALF, she was
described as generally "sleepy" and noncompliant with her CPAP,
but had not been hypoxic recently although has a history of
dropping to as low as the mid-70s.  The patient has reports a 20
lbs weight gain over the past 2-3 weeks with incraesed lower
extremity edema.
.
Of note, the patient was admitted twice to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2191**] ([**Month (only) 116**]
and [**Month (only) **]) for respiratory failure. In [**2192-8-14**], she
was admitted to the MICU for a mixed respiratory failure felt to
be multifactorial including COPD, dCHF, HCAP, and OHS treated
with broad spectrum antibiotics, corticosteroids, and diuresis
ultimately requiring tracheostomy that has since been
decannulated.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS 97.6 69 139/80 32 96%4L.  The
patient had a CXR demonstrated perihilar congestion and
pulmonary edema without consolidation or effusions, CE neg x1,
BNP elevated to 1200.  She received 40 iv lasix x2 with good
[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], levofloxacin, and solumedro 125 mg IV. She was initial
going to be admitted to the medicine floor, but was noted to be
somnolent with an ABG 7.30/74/74 on 2L, and initially refused
NIPPV. She ultimately agreed to NIPPV, but repeatedly was found
to be removing her mask. She was then admitted to the MICU for
further management.

Ca 9.9, Mag 1.8, P3.3

CXR [**2193-11-11**]: FINDINGS: Single AP portable view of the chest
is obtained. Cardiomegaly is noted with central pulmonary hilar
congestion. Low lung volumes limit evaluation. No definite signs
of pneumonia. Mild congestion/interstitial edema is likely
present. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mediastinal
contour is stable. Bony structures appear stable with
degenerative spurring at the left glenohumeral joint.

IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly, mild congestion.

CXR [**2193-11-12**]: The severe cardiomegaly is unchanged as well as
vascular engorgement of the hila. There is no appreciable
pleural effusion. Bibasilar atelectasis is mild, left more than
right. There is no pneumothorax. Overall, no significant change
since the prior study has been demonstrated.

CXR [**2193-11-13**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-12**],
there is little interval change. Severe cardiomegaly and
vascular engorgement persist with bibasilar atelectasis. No
definite effusions, though a lateral view would be helpful in
detecting this if this is a serious clinical concern.

ECHO [**2193-11-13**]: Conclusions
The left atrial volume is severely increased. The right atrium
is dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral
regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is borderline
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Low-normal LV systolic function. No significant
valvular abnormality seen.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2192-4-30**],
velocity across the aortic valve is slightly lower. The degree
of pulmonary artery systolic hypertension has decreased.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 2450**] [**Known lastname 6930**] is a 63 year old woman with a past medical
history significant for COPD, dCHF, AF/MAT, OSA on CPAP, DM 2,
CAD admitted for mixed hypercarbic hypoxic respiratory distress.

.
MICU Course:
Patient presented to the ED with SOB, and just before admission
was noted to be somnolent with an ABG showing a hypercarbic, and
possibly hypoxic resp distress, and was admitted to MICU for
monitoring.  Patient with fluctuating mental status
corresponding to patient's clinical breathing.  She refused ABGs
for further workup of her resp difficulty (attempting to discern
whether there was a hypoxic component), and refused NIPPV as
well.  Patient's mental status waxed and waned dra
