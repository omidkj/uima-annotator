Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Mitral Valve Replacement utilizing a 27 mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **]
pericardial tissue heart valve

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 31763**] has been followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for the last
several years for a history of mitral regurgitation. She has
been asymptomatic until several months prior to admission where
she began to experience progressive SOB and fatigue. She denies
chest pain, orthopnea, PND, and syncope. She occasionally admits
to lightheadedness. An echocardiogram in [**2155-10-9**] was
notable for a mitral valve with rheumatic disease, having
moderate to severe stenosis and moderate to severe
regurgitation. The LA was dilated. Her LVEF was estimated at
55-60%. Subsequent cardiac catheterization in [**2155-11-8**] found
no flow limiting coronary artery disease. There was moderate to
severe mixed mitral stenosis and regurgitation with preserved
cardiac output and indeces. Mean mitral gradient was 20 mmHg
with a valve area of 0.86 cm2. There was moderate pulmonary
hypertension. Based on the above results, she was referred for
cardiac surgical intervention.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 31763**] was admitted and underwent a mitral valve
replacement utilizing a 27 mm
[**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial tissue heart valve. The operation
was complicated by a coagulopathy which improved with multiple
blood products. For full operative details, please see operative
note. Following the operation, she was brought to the CSRU on
inotropic support. She was slow to wake and kept on ventilatory
support for several days. She eventually awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated on POD #3. She gradually weaned from
inotropic support without incident. On POD#5, she experienced
rapid atrial fibrillation for which Amiodarone therapy was
initiated with good rate control. She remained relatively stable
on medical therapy. Given atrial fibrillation and pericardial
mitral valve, Warfarin anticoagulation was eventually started.
She remained somewhat weak and deconditioned. On POD#7, she
transferred to the floor where did well and was able to be
discharger to rehab on POD #10. She has a positive UA for which
she was placed on levofloxacin.
