[**2111-12-16**] CXR
Again seen is an air fluid level in the left hemithorax that
probably represents a small loculated hydropneumothorax. It
appears to have decreased in size compared to the prior
examination. No large pneumothorax is seen. The heart size and
mediastinal contours are unchanged with multiple median
sternotomy wires and mediastinal surgical clips. No evidence of
failure or new pulmonary parenchymal opacity. Small bilateral
pleural effusions are again seen and are unchanged. An aortic
valve prosthesis is identified.

Slight interval decrease in size of small left anterior
hydropneumothorax.

[**2111-12-8**] EKG
Baseline artifact
Sinus rhythm
ST-T wave configuration suggests early repolarization pattern
but baseline
artifact makes assessment difficult and clinical correlation is
suggested
Since previous tracing of [**2111-11-12**], sinus bradycardia absent
otherwise baseline artifact makes comparison difficult


[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4125**]ospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2111-12-7**] for surgical
management of his coronary artery and aortic valve disease. He
was taken directly to the operating room where he underwent
coronary artery bypass grafting to two vessels and an aortic
valve replacement with a 23mm [**Last Name (un) **] [**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial
valve. As he had some bleeding immediately after closure, he was
reopened and placed back on bypass to achieve hemostasis.
Postoperatively he was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive
care unit for monitoring. On postoperative day one, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. His drains and wires
were removed per protocol. Aspirin, a beta blocker and a statin
were resumed. He had some mild confusion which resolved without
intervention. Mr. [**Known lastname **] was noted to have a right pneumothorax
for which a chest tube was reinserted. On postoperative day four
he was transferred to the cardiac surgical step down unit for
further recovery. An air leak was noted in his chest tube thus
great care was taken to prevent another pneumothorax. The
physical therapy service was consulted for assistance with his
postoperative mobility. He was gently diuresed towards his
preoperative weight. Ultimately on postoperative day nine, his
chest tube was removed without further pneumothorax. Mr. [**Known lastname **]
continued to make steady progress and was discharged home on
postoperative day 11. He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **],
his cardiologist and his primary care physician as an
outpatient.
