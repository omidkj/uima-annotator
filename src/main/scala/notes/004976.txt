ERCP

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 18252**] is an 84 year old man with hx of COPD, Afib, PE on
warfarin, s/p remote cholecystectomy, presented to OSH with one
day of worsening sharp epigastric pain and nausea, found to have
transaminitis and stones in CBD by imaging at [**Hospital **] transfered to
[**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP, now also with hypoxia.  Patient recalls
epigastric pain starting at 9am yesterday morning.  He does not
recall the severity or quality of the pain at this time and how
it progressed, but daughter states that he was able to attend a
church function yesterday during day prior to presenting to ED.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 392**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] reports that patient has had this pain before, usually
subsiding with gingerale or simethicone, but no relief on night
of presentation.  He was taken to OSH by ambulance around
midnight.  Abdominal pain localizes to epigastrum, RUQ and LUQ,
radiates to back, was [**10-7**] at its worst.  He endorsed nausea, no
vomiting.  He denies any association with food.  Denies
fevers/chills.  Had one episode of loose brown stool yesterday.

.
At OSH ED, he was given 1mg dilaudid to which he became
difficult to arouse, so he was given narcan.  He was noted to
otherwise be pleasant, alert and oriented.  Rhythm in Afib, rate
90s, stable blood pressures in 110s-120s, remained afebrile and
hemodynamically stable, saturating well on room air.  He did
have several episodes of desaturation secondary to pain,
improved with deep breath and pain relief.  TBili initially
noted to be 1.5, increased on recheck to 3.9 with direct bili
3.5; ast/alt 233/133; wbc 6; INR 5.8.  ABG at OSH reportedly
7.18/79/89/29.5 after somnolent from dilaudid.  CT revealed
pneumobilia and choledocholithiasis, moderate to severe
bilateral intrahepatic duct dilatation; CBD 16 mm; abrupt cutoff
at distal CBD. Decision was made to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP.
At [**Hospital1 392**], he was given D5_1/2NS with 20meq K at 100cc/hr, 10u
subq vitamin K, 4 bags total of FFP.  He was also given 4mg of
IV morphine prior to transfer. OSH ED notes listed antibiotics
in plan, but no record of whether patient received antibiotics.
.
.
On arrival to the ICU, patient appeared comfortable in bed,
wearing 50% venti mask.  Reports pain has subsided somewhat and
is tolerable.  Abdominal pain located in entire epigastrum,
radiates right to left and to the back; it is worsened with deep
breaths.  Reports some mild dyspnea on exertion and shortness of
breath at baseline but nothing increased recently.  Last bowel
movement yesterday.  Reports coughing up sputum today x 1 and
swallowing it afterwards; has chronic morning cough, sometimes
mildly productive, does not appear to be changed from baseline.
Shortness of breath also at baseline, does not feel that it has
increased.

[**2176-5-10**] CXR: FINDINGS: There is marked tortuosity of the
thoracic aorta with an aneurysmal
dilation of the aortic knob measuring 7.3 cm. Cardiac silhouette
is upper
limits of normal. There are increased densities [**Doctor Last Name **] both lungs
suggestive of
chronic fibrotic changes. Comparison to the old films would be
helpful, if
not, baseline CT scan may be helpful to establish underlying
parenchymal lung
changes and to evaluate the thoracic aorta. There are no
pneumothoraces.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.


[**2176-5-16**] CXR:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the bilateral
pleural
effusions have moderately decreased in extent. There is better
ventilation of
the lung bases. All other aspects of the radiograph are
unchanged, excluding
the known significantly enlarged aortic arch. There is mild
fluid overload
but no overt pulmonary edema.

ERCP Report: Impression: Evidence of a previous sphincterotomy
or laceration noted at ampulla. Sludge and pus were draining
from the ampulla.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a
sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.
There was severe diffuse biliary dilation and multiple filling
defect seen, suggestive of stones.
Contrast opacification was intentionally limited due to the
patient's known cholangitis.
A copious amount of stones, sludge, and pus were extracted
successfully using a 15mm balloon.
A 5cm double pigtail biliary stent was placed successfully for
biliary drainage.
Otherwise normal ERCP to 3rd portion of duodenum.


Recommendations: NPO, continued antibiotics.
Repeat ERCP for stent removal, additional stone extraction, and
possible sphincteroplasty when patient is stabilized, with
normal INR.



Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION:
84M with hx of  COPD, Afib, PE on warfarin who was transferred
from OSH for management of cholangitis.  He developed hypoxia
[**2-29**] IVF and has required diuresis. Hospital course also
complicated by afib with RVR requiring increased betablockade.
He is now being transferred to rehab.

# Ascending Cholangitis/E. Coli Sepsis: The patient presented
with fever, jaundice, abdominal pain, and leukocytosis. ERCP was
performed which showed biliary
