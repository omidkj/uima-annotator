History of Present Illness:
78 year-old female with chronic trach presented to ER for
hypoxia, s/p respiratory arrest in ER, admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. At her
vent facility she was found to be blue and hypoxic. Out of
concern for a right-sided PTX, she was sent to the ED. In the ED
BP133/66, HR 82, 98% on Portable CXR was without PTX. Repeat CXR
with concern for PNA, and she was given levofloxacin,
ceftriaxone and ativan 1mg x2. She was about to be discharged to
her nursing home, when she had a respiratory arrest at 9:58 pm.
She underwent chest compressions for 30 seconds, no meds were
given. Upon taking down her trach dressings, it was apparent
that the trach tube was disconnected from respirator. They
reconnected the trach tube with resolution of her hypoxia. She
was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for overnight monitoring.

Past Medical History:
-Ventillator dependence since [**1-5**] s/p trach (perhaps due to
GBS), successfully decanulated in [**10-7**], however readmitted
[**Date range (1) 76415**] for evaluation of small tracheal mass and
desaturated in the setting of bronchoscopy and trach was
replaced.

Brief Hospital Course:
78 year-old female with chronic trach presented to ER for
hypoxia, had respiratory arrest in the setting of trach coming
detached from the ventillator, stable throughout ICU course with
no acute issues.

1)Hypoxia/respiratory arrest - most likely due to trach being
detached from the ventillator. Likely accidental however concern
that patient may possibly detach trach on her own in order to
get the attention of staff. On admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] she is stable
and saturating well on usual vent settings. Initially
transferred to ED out of concern for hypoxia/possible PTX.  She
was started on vanomycin and zoysn on [**2-24**] for planned course of
2 weeks for possibility of ventillator associated pneumonia
given purulent secretions from trach and question of RLL opacity
on CXR.  There was no pneumothorax evident on CXR.  During her
admission she was continued on CMV 50%/550/16/5.

2)Brief cardiac arrest - had brief episode of pulselessness in
the ED after becoming acutely hypoxic following detachment of
trach.  She did have chest compressions however no medications
or shocks administered.  Pulse returned promptly after
re-attaching ventillator.  No changes on EKG.

3)Chronic respiratory failure s/p trach -> possibly [**3-3**] GBS,
also with element of tracheomalacia, continue with outpatient
treatment regimen.  Has had all prior care at [**Hospital1 2177**], would
recommend follow up and continued outpatient managment at [**Hospital1 2177**]
given that patient  is well known to that hospital.  She was
maintained on her usual vent settings, nebs, spiriva and
prednisone, with no changes to dosing or regimen.

4)anxiety/depression - h/o night time anxiety, per medical
records she responds well to seroquel.  Has a 24 hour sitter at
her rehab facility.  She was continued on her regimen of
seroquel standing and prn, wellbutrin and celexa.

5)Tremor -continue primidone

6)HTN: continue outpatient regimen of lisinopril, lopressor

7)DMII - continue with lantus, hss.  She was only given 1/2 dose
of usual insulin however she was hypoglycemic this morning most
likely due to prolonged NPO.  She was resumed on her tube feeds
overnight.

8)Chronic bilateral knee/hip pain -  She was continued on her
outpatient regimen of percocet.

9)PPX: SC Heparin, bowel regimen
