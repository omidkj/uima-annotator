Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Lasix / Bumex

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2605**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, Fatigue

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis on [**7-10**] with 1L of serosanguinous fluid removed.

History of Present Illness:
82 year old oxygen dependent (2L) male with diastolic CHF, CAD
s/p 5v CABG in [**2132**], A. Fib presents with chief complaint of
worsened SOB, LE edema over past 3 days. He notes that he is
normally able to ambulate throughout his one level apartment
with mild SOB, but noted SOB with shorter distances and even
while at rest. He uses 2L O2 at baseline at home which he bumped
up to 3L on his own over the last week, but SOB progressive so
presented. He has chronic LE edema for which he wears TEDS and
notes that over the past 3 days, swelling in his legs has also
worsened. He denies leg pain, redness, warmth. He denies dietary
indiscretions, no CP/palpitations. He has been urinating without
difficulty. He sleeps with 2 pillows and HOB at an angle at
baseline and reports this has not changed--however, he has been
waking up at night short of breath and moves to a recliner in
which he is somewhat more comfortable. No fevers/chills. Reports
infrequent cough which was productive of small amount of clear
sputum last night with blood specks throughout; this am clear
sputum only, no blood.
.
Of note, he was admitted in [**4-/2133**] with chief complaint of
hemoptysis. Imaging suggested pulmonary hemorrhage. He underwent
bronchoscopy at that time without HD compromise, requiring 2U
prbc transfusions throughout his stay. He underwent bronchoscopy
which did not demonstrate any active bleeding or endobronchial
lesions. Washings were sent for cytology and were negative for
malignant cells. Given negative w/u otherwise, his hemoptysis
was thought to be in the setting of decompensated CHF and
pulmonary htn. In the setting of a.fib and elevated CHADS2
score, he was continued on his coumadin upon discharge. He was
discharged home on [**Hospital1 **] 80mg PO torsemide, which has been
increased by his cardiologist to 200mg qam, and 100mg qpm since
d/c.
.
In the ED, intial vitals were T: 97.5 BP: 140/44 HR: 60 RR: 16
O2sat: 95% 3L NC. CXR was performed which showed new Left
pleural effusion and interstitial edema. He received ethacrynic
acid 50 mg IV x1 (pharmacy did not have torsemide). Hct was 23
on presentation, down from 28.5 on [**2133-4-15**] (last in our system).
Records from [**6-23**] from his [**Hospital3 **] indicate a hematocrit
of 20.4 and Cr of 3.9, and [**6-16**] HCT of 23. Physical exam
revealed guaiac positive brown stool. Repeat hct in ED was 21.6.
He reports dark colored stool in the setting of taking iron
which is unchanged and reports rare bright red blood on TP only
when constipated; none recently.  He was transfused 1 u prbc in
the ED, and received a second dose of 50 gm IV ethacrynic acid.
Total recorded UOP in ED was 2 liters.
.
ROS: As above. Additionally, No LH/dizziness. +50lb weight loss
since CABG in 7/[**2132**]. Poor appetite over the past week. No
HA/changes in vision. No numbness/tingling/weakness. No
N/V/abdominal pain. No dysuria/hematuria. No joint pain. No
rashes.  In general, his most bothersome complaint is fatigue.


Past Medical History:
-CAD s/p Coronary Artery Bypass Graft x 5 [**2132-8-8**] (Left internal
mammary artery > Left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft
> diagonal, saphenous vein graft > obtuse marginal 1, saphenous
vein graft > obtuse marginal 2, saphenous vein graft > posterior
descending artery)

-HTN
-Mitral regurg (1+), Aortic regurg (1+), Tricuspid regurg (2+)
-Dyslipidemia
-Hypothyroidism
-Gout
-Bladder CA (12 years ago)
-Pericarditis (remote)
-Stage IV CKD; largely secondary to microvascular disease of the
kidney, but possibly with a component of atheroembolic disease
in light of persistently elevated eosinophil count and mildly
low complement levels.
-Atrial fibrillation
-Hemoptysis ([**4-/2133**])
-s/p right knee replacement

Social History:
 Pt. is a retired CPA, he recently moved into an [**Hospital3 **]
facility. He is able to maintain ADLs, cares for himself. Pt.
smoked but quit 45 years ago; does not drink alcohol currently
and used rarely before his CABG, and has never used recreational
drugs. He is a veteran of WWII.

Family History:
n/c

Physical Exam:
Vitals: 100.0/100.0, 140/50, 56, 18, 96%2L
Weight: 94.1kg
General appearance: Resting in bed, comfotable, pleasant.
Speaking in full sentences
Cardiac: RRR. III/VI systolic murmur heard loudest at left
sternal border. JVP not elevated, ~8cm.
Pulm: Diminshed breast sounds at left base, otherwise clear to
auscultation.
Abd: Soft, + BS, NT, ND.
Ext: Warm and well perfused. Edema not significantly changed.
Skin: No jaundice nor rashes appreciated

Pertinent Results:
CXR ([**6-23**]): 1. New moderate-to-large left pleural effusion with
left basilar opacity concerning for possible underlying
infection. Parapneumonic effusion cannot be excluded. 2.
Vascular congestion with evidence of interstitial edema.
.
CXR ([**6-25**]): Slightly improved interstitial pulmonary edema and
left pleural effusion, but residual right lower lobe airspace
opacity. Followup radiographs after appropriate diuresis
recommended to exclude underlying consolitdation.
.
Renal ultrasound ([**6-26**]): No evidence of hydronephrosis.
.
TEE ([**7-2**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF 60-70%) There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid regurgitation jet is eccentric and may be
underestimated. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2133-3-31**], the findings are similar.
.
CXR ([**7-3**]): 1. Worsening left more than right pleural effusion.
2. Stable cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema.
.
CXR ([**7-6**]): 1. Worsening left more than right pleural effusion.
2. Stable cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema.
.
Chest CT ([**7-9**]): 1. New multifocal ground-glass opacities,
affecting the right lung to a much greater degree than the left.
These findings are concerning for an evolving infection in the
appropriate clinical setting. An asymmetric distribution of
pulmonary edema is less likely. Other causes such as hemorrhage
should also be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
2. Increasing moderate left pleural effusion. 3. New 7-mm right
basilar lung nodule, most likely inflammatory or infectious
considering rapid development in three months. Followup CT in
three months is recommended to document resolution and to
exclude the less likely possibility of malignancy. 4. Improved
mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
.
CXR ([**7-10**]): Interval reduction in the large left pleural
effusions with
persistent small bilateral pleural effusions status post left
thoracentesis without development of pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. SOB/dCHF: CXR with pulmonary edema and new left sided pleural
effusion in conjunction with worsening LE edema, most c/w CHF
exacerbation. Denies CP and EKG without changes concerning for
active ischemia (essentially unchanged from prior). On
admission, his trop was mildly elevated to 0.13, but this is in
the setting of CKD where BL trop runs 0.10-0.15
