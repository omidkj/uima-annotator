Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2009**]
Chief Complaint:
Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
87 year-old gentleman with history of ESRD on HD, CAD, CHF,
presents with 3 day history of epigastric pain, nausea,
vomiting, and diarrhea. He has not had much of an appetite in
the last two days and has been spending a lot of time in the
bathroom. He notes an uncomfortable feeling in his epigastrum,
though is unable to further clarify the character of the pain.
Patient notes that he has additionally had two days of cough,
though denies fevers, sweats headache, dyspnea, sore throat, or
myalgias. He has had some mild chills. He has had no known sick
contacts. [**Name (NI) **] was recently discharged from the hospital on
[**2162-9-20**] after a 3 day stay for new onset dysarthria and
worsening LUE weakness. At that time his neurologic symptoms
were attributed to poor PO intake prior to presentation and
representation of prior CVA symptoms.

Vital signs upon presentation to the ED were T 97.6, HR 80, BP
173/65, O2Sat 100% 2L. Initial labs showed serum potassium of
6.3. Did not have peaked T waves on EKG at presentation, though
had a QRS prolongation to 120 ms [**First Name (Titles) 767**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5348**] of 100 ms.
Additionally had new TWI in leads V1 and V2. Received calcium
gluconate, insulin and dextrose, 1 amp bicarb, and aspirin. Due
to concern for intra-abdominal process, was started on zosyn and
vancomycin. Received a CT abdomen and RUQ U/S that both showed
gallstone at gallbladder neck, though no definitive evidence of
acute cholecystitis per ultrasound. Surgery consulted and felt
that empiric antibiotics were appropriate. Was given an aspirin
due to concern for cardiac process and had a set of cardiac
enzymes sent. Prior to transfer to the floor vitals were: T 97,
HR 81, BP 154/70, RR 20, O2Sat 99% 2L NC.

[**2162-10-16**] Chest Xray: Cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema, and small
effusions suggest mild cardiac failure. Recommend repeat PA and
lateral after diuresis to evaluate for coexistent infection.

[**2162-10-16**] CT Abdomen/Pelvis:
IMPRESSIONS:
Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
Distended gallbladder with multiple gallstones, including one in
the
gallbladder neck. Trace pericholecystic fluid and gallbladder
wall edema,
although without definite gallbladder free wall thickening.
Cholecystitis is a concern. This can be further evaluated via
ultrasound or hepatobiliary scan.  Extensive atherosclerotic
calcifications throughout the aorta and major mesenteric
branches, although mesenteric arteries are without stenosis or
thrombosis evident. Due to suboptimal contrast administration,
venous structures are not opacified. However, there are no
secondary signs of venous thrombus. There is no evidence of
bowel ischemia. Very high grade stenosis of the proximal right
superficial femoral artery. Stable appearance of simple and
hyperdense renal cysts.
Diffusely enlarged prostate gland with prominent median lobe,
with multiple proteinaceous/hemorrhagic nodules. This is
consistent with BPH, although tumor is not definitively
excluded.

[**2162-10-16**] Liver or Gallbladder Ultrasound
1. Enlarged but compressible gallbladder with gallstones; stone
in the
gallbladder neck was not definitely impacted. Asymmetric
perihepatic
gallbladder wall edema. Findings are not typical for acute
cholecystitis, and are likely because of hepatic dysfunction,
possibly from vascular congestion.
2. Patent portal vein. SMV not well visualized due to overlying
bowel gas.


Brief Hospital Course:
87 year-old gentleman with history of ESRD on HD, CAD, CHF, who
presented with 3 day history of epigastric pain, nausea,
vomiting, and diarrhea.

#. Gastroenteritis and cholelithiasis:  He presented with 3 days
of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and loss of appetite.  It was
felt to most likely be a gastroenteritis.  CT did not show
obvious source of infection and no evidence of bowel ischemia.
However, the gall bladder had an atypical appearance.  Follow-up
RUQ ultrasound did not show acute cholecystitis.  Surgery was
consulted as the clinical picture could suggest an
intermittently obstructing stone and biliary colic.  He
underwent bowel rest, serial lactates, and empiric treatment
with Unasyn.  He was also ruled out for MI and his lactate
downtrended. Symptoms resolved and patient tolerated a normal
diet at discharge.

#. Hyperkalemia:  Upon presentation to the ED, his serum
potassium was 6.3 and EKG was noted to have QRS prolongation to
120 with recent [**Month/Day/Year 5348**] QRS of 100 on EKG dated [**2162-9-18**]. He
was given calcium gluconate, bicarb, insulin and D50. Repeat
potassium in ED was 4.6 prior to transfer to the ICU.  He
underwent hemodialysis overnight and his serum potassium
returned to [**Location 213**].

#. CAD:  He was ruled out for MI and was continued on isosorbide
mononitrate, lisinopril, aspirin, metoprolol, and simvastatin.

# Chronic Renal Disease on HD: Pt received HD while ho
