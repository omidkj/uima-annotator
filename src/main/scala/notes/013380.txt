History of Present Illness:
This is an 82 year old man with history of complicated course
after GI bleed with colectomy, respiratory failure, temporary
dialysis, vent/trach, who was admitted from home with confusion.


He was discharged from rehabilitation in mid [**Month (only) **], and had
been overall doing well and steadily improving regarding his
strength and ADL's.  Over the last few days preceding
presentation, however, he had been confused and had intermittent
hallucinations regarding aliens.  He also noted poor sleep and
multiple falls in the days proceeding admission.

His only medication change was recent initiation of escitalopram
treatment for depression.  He was on 5 mg starting on [**1-2**], and
increased to 10 mg on [**1-16**] which he took for one week. His
daughter was concerned that this was making him somnolent, and
decreased him back to 5 mg.  The confusion happened after the
decrease from 10 to 5.  He has had prior episodes of
hallucinations previously when he has had confusion.

episode of indigestion.  Otherwise negative.

Brief Hospital Course:
82 yo man presenting to the hospital with altered mental status
and hallucinations and then transferred to the ICU for worsening
hypoxia and mental status.  Course complicated by hypercarbic
respiratory failure, multiple failed extubation attempts, and
eventual need for trach placement.

#. Hypoxic respiratory failure/Pneumonia: The patient initially
presented to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypoxic respiratory failure in the
context of new infiltrates, most dramatic in the left lower
lobe.  The patient proceeded to bronchoscopy which noted
intermittent collapse of the left lower lobe with thick
secretions and bronchomalacia.  This was cleared and the BAL
grew MRSA.  The patient remained afebrile but given infilitrate
and isolation of an organism (the same organism also grew on
sputum culture) he was treated with fourteen days of vancomycin
for MRSA pneumonia (course extended due to rather severe
presentation).  After his first two nights in the intensive care
unit the patients hypoxia resolved and he never had oxygenation
problems thereafter.

#. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient had progressive
hypercarbic respiratory failure after his bronchoscopy leading
to increased somonolence.  This eventually required intubation.
The patient was rapidly weaned to minimal settings but failed
extubation twice due to progressive hypercarbia.  Unfortunately,
this did not resolve with treatment of pneumonia, pulmonary
edema, and other reversible factors.  A neurology consult was
attained and it was determined that he had a diffuse
polyneuropathy and that neuromuscular weakness was the primary
reason for his failure to extubate.  Because this etiology was
not reversible in the short term, a tracheostomy tube was placed
and he was able to tolerate a trach collar with intermittent
placement on pressure support ventilatory settings.  A
Passy-Muir valve was placed on [**2113-2-21**].

#. Pulmonary edema:  Patient had evidence of pulmonary edema on
presentation and was intermittently diuresed with lasix during
his three week ICU stay.  It was thought to be secondary to
hypoalbuminemia given a normal ECHO in [**2-6**] (normal LV systolic
and diastolic function).  He responded well to lasix 20 mg IV
boluses and may need lasix chronically to optimize his fluid
status.

#. Altered mental status:  Patient exhibited evidence of
delirium, with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] levels of awareness and
intermittent visual hallucinations.  These episodes were thought
to be secondary to infection, respiratory failure, insomnia, and
disorientation from a prolonged hospital stay.  His in
