History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 20608**] is a 74-year-old male who originally presented to an
OSH with on [**2120-8-4**] with cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis
as well as an NSTEMI; he was transferred urgently to [**Hospital1 18**] for
an ERCP. ERCP demonstrated gross pus in the stomach and spilling
from the papilla; a biliary stent was placed. He was treated
with Zosyn x 7 days. (8/12/008-8/19/08). A cholecystostomy tube
was placed percutaneously, and elective cholecystectomy was
deferred by general surgery until the near future. His LFTs
trended down throughout his stay.
.
The patient was discharged on [**2120-8-15**], and the tube fell out on

[**2120-8-16**] at [**Hospital3 **] facility. Per the patient and
his family, he began feeling ill 1-2 weeks prior to
presentation, with malaise and intermittant RUQ pain. He was
seen at [**Hospital3 15054**] [**Hospital1 107**] 5 days ago; per his family and the
surgical note, both an ultrasound and CT scan were unrevealing
for gallbladder disease. He was treated for hypoglycemia and
released.
.
On the day of admission he developed increasing abdominal pain
and erratic behavior per his wife. She did not note fevers at
home. Otherwise, he did not have chest pain, difficulty
breathing, increased lower extremity edema, vomiting, or
diarrhea at home. He did have nausea per his wife.
.
In the ED: initial vitals were: T 99.3, HR 86, BP 126/73, RR 20,
95% on RA. In the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] U/S was concerning for acute
cholecystitis; perforated gallbladder or abscess could not be
excluded. Surgery was consulted; it was felt the patient was not
a surgical candidate, recommended perc drainage and admission to
MICU. Code sepsis was called; he was intubated for airway
protection (with etomidate and rocuronium), a central line was
placed for access. He was given vancomycin and Zosyn. He was
placed on propofol. He is admitted to the MICU for further
management.

Brief Hospital Course:
74M with recent admission for cholecystitis and ascending
cholangitis s/p perc tube placement with
Lactobacillus/Citrobacter sepsis now with resolved sepsis

# Cholecystitis/Septic shock: Signs and symptoms of septic shock
resolved. Has defervesced on Vanco/Meropenem. Cholecystitis is
most likely source of sepsis given improvement on antibiotics.
Blood cultures showing lactobacillus and Citrobacter Freundii
with repeat blood cx NGTD and wound cx from gallbladder grwoing
Citrobacter and Enteroccoccus. Hemodynamically stable.
Percutaneous cholecystostomy tube was not draining anymore so
was replaced for 12 gauge but still not draining. Repeat US on
[**9-26**] again shows increasing distension and no change in debris
collection despite larger drain. IR was unable to offer any
additional therapy. Two surgical attendings have been consulted
regarding surgery and determined that he is too high risk, and
should be managed conservatively although surgery could be
performed if very aggressive care was wanted by family and
patient with understanding he had high intra op mortality risk.
Ultimately patient and family decided he would like to go home
with VNA and bridge towards hospice. This was arranged for him.

# Poor mental status and neurological deficits:  Pt w/ multiple
CNS deficits in brain, and spinal cord, unclear etiology though
Neurology suggests that the spinal lesions are likely infarcts
[**1-27**] hypoperfusion, whereas some of the brain lesions are most
likely embolic. mental status improved during hospitalization
and he had capacity and alertness by time of discharge.


# Chest Pain: Pt had previous complaints of CP similar to CP he
has at home. He has recent h/o NSTEMI. Possibly etiologies
include UA, GI etiologies such as DES, GERD, PTX, PE. He was
given Nitro with good effect, resolution. CP now resolved.
Biomarkers trending down. No PTX on CXR. No further CP.
Continued beta [**Last Name (LF) 7005**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]. Likely recurrent NSTEMI in setting
of demand ischemia.

# Acute r
