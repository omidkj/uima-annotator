History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 74yo M with history of myelofibrosis on
hydroxyurea, history of chronic c diff, and recent admission for
pneumonia discharged on [**3-14**] who presents with nausea, vomiting
and diarrhea.  Today he reported feeling "like he was going to
die" so he came into the ER.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 97 P 80 BP 139/79 R 24 O2 sat
100%. CXR was significant for new R pleural effusion and
consolidation. He had a CT of his abdomen/pelvis which showed
new acute, possibly necrotizing pancreatitis. Patient was given
4L NS, vancomycin, flagyl, levaquin, zofran and morphine.
Surgery was consulted regarding questionable necrotizing
pancreatitis and felt he did not acutely require intervention as
he has had his gallbladder removed.  Vitals on transfer were 70,
113/46, 19, 100% 2L.
.
In the ICU, patient is oriented to hospital and [**Location (un) 86**] but not
[**Hospital1 **].  He knows the month but not date or year.
 Per HCP and patient, he has felt poorly since previous
discharge and never felt better despite PNA treatment.  He has
had decreased PO intake for the past week with decreased, dark
urine output.  He developed nausea and vomiting on Friday with
new abdominal pain yesterday.  Patient has had chronic diarrhea.

CXR [**2180-3-19**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Increased right middle and lower lobe opacities, reflecting
combined
pneumonia and pleural effusion.
2. Worsening congestive heart failure.
.
CTAP [**2180-3-19**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Recurrent acute pancreatitis, with enlargement and
hypoenhancement of
pancreatic head and peripancreatic standing, suspicious for

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 74yo M with history of myelofibrosis and
recent PNA here with acute pancreatitis. Pt was treated
aggressively with IVF's and started on broad-spectrum abx
Vanc/Meropenem/Flagyl while in the MICU. His course was
complicated by  hypercarbic respiratory distress, requiring
intubation. He continued to require IVF's, and required pressor
support. A family meeting was held on
# Acute pancreatitis: As evidenced by abdominal pain, elevated
lipase. CT scan was concerning for necrotizing component in the
pancreatitic head. The underlying cause of his pancreatitis is
unclear as he is s/p cholecystectomy and denies alcohol
ingestion.  He recently had a lipid profile which showed
triglycerides of 84 which makes hypertriglyceridemia unlikely.
Medication effect is also a possibility and this could be due to
the levaquin he was discharged on or hydroxyurea as this is
listed as a possible side effect. Pt was treated with aggressive
IVF's, and started on broad spectrum abx with
Vanc/Meropenem/Flagyl. Surgery was consulted, and recommended no
acute surgical intervention. Patient was followed and treated
for 6 days with gradual deterioration and multisystem organ
failure. A family meeting was held and after careful
consideration he was made CMO. He passed on [**2180-3-25**] with his
family at his side.
