Service:  MEDICINE

CHIEF COMPLAINT:   Fever.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 63 year old primarily
Spanish speaking male with a history of end-stage renal
disease secondary to diabetes mellitus on dialysis.  The
patient also has a history of coronary artery disease,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, recurrent Methicillin
resistant Staphylococcus aureus/VRE dialysis catheter
infection and status post Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus epidural abscess of L2 to 3, status
post incision and drainage in [**2144-7-15**].  The patient is
now here from his outpatient hemodialysis center with a fever
up to 103.3 F., lethargy and back pain.  Per the hemodialysis
center notes the patient had a temperature the previous night
at home, however, he was afebrile at the beginning of his
hemodialysis session.  The patient was given Tylenol for his
back pain which did not help.  The patient also complained of
increased back pain.  His pain was mostly between the
shoulders.  Temperature came down to 101.8 F.  Blood cultures
were drawn times two.  The patient was given one gram of
Kefzol and 80 mg of intravenous Gentamicin and sent to the
[**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Department.

At [**Hospital1 69**], the patient was
given 1 gram of Vancomycin and 2 grams of ceftriaxone.  A
lumbar puncture was performed.  A head CT scan was performed
and was negative.  The patient received about a liter of
intravenous fluids.  Initially, the patient was only
minimally responsive and could only open his eyes, however,
he quickly perked up and after the antibiotics, he was alert
and oriented times three.  He complained of mild headache,
mostly bifrontal and mild neck pain as well as the thoracic
back pain.  The patient denied any chest pain or shortness of
breath.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In short, this is a 63 year old Spanish
speaking male with a history of end-stage renal disease on
hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease
status post left circumflex stent, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, history of recurrent dialysis catheter
infections with Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus
and VRE, and history of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus
aureus epidural abscess, who now presents with fever,
lethargy, back pain and headache.

1.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient did not have any further
high spikes after being admitted.  He had only low spikes for
a couple of days and then was afebrile afterwards.  The
patient had blood cultures drawn in the Emergency Department.
These were negative without any growth.  The patient's fever
was presumed to be secondary to his left sided Quinton
catheter, even though it did not show any obvious signs of
infection.  The patient was kept on a regimen of Vancomycin
and Gentamicin for broad coverage.

Of note, the patient's blood cultures from his dialysis
center were found to be positive, growing four out of four
tubes of Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.  This
was found to be overall pan sensitive, only resistant to
penicillin, Ampicillin and tetracycline.  However, the MIC
was only low for oxacillin at a level of 0.25.  For this
reason, the patient was switched from Vancomycin and
Gentamicin to intravenous Oxacillin at a dose of 1 gram q.
four hours.  His Quinton dialysis line was pulled after
dialysis was started with his left AV fistula.  The Quinton
tip also grew Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.

The patient was unable to have a right sided PICC line placed
because of the extensive network of clots in his right
internal jugular, subclavian and brachiocephalic veins.
However, a midline catheter was successfully placed on [**11-4**].
The patient was continued on intravenous Oxacillin.

Because the patient was also having back pain, and given his
history of an epidural abscess, there was a concern that he
might have seeded his vertebrae, thus causing osteomyelitis.
The patient received an MRI of the spine.  This was negative
for an epidural abscess, but did show increased signal and
paravertebral swelling anterior to C3 through 5, suspicious
for osteomyelitis.  Even though this is not the area where
the patient was having pain, it was decided that the patient
should be treated for presumed osteomyelitis for a total of
six weeks on antibiotics.

Given that the patient was bacteremic with Methicillin
sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, there was also concern that
he may have seeded his heart valves.  The patient had a
transthoracic echocardiogram a couple of days after
admission.  This showed low normal left ventricular ejection
fraction, small ASD, but only mild mitral regurgitation and
no change in his valves.  A transesophageal echocardiogram
was planned for [**11-4**], but during the procedure, the patient
was unable to tolerate the tube and th
