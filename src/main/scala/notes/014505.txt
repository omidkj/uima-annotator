Admission Date:  [**2187-10-1**]       Discharge Date:  [**2187-10-15**]

Date of Birth:   [**2151-11-20**]       Sex:  M

Service:  [**Location (un) 259**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 35 year old male with
myotonic dystrophy presenting from [**Hospital **] Hospital
originally on [**2187-10-1**], with pneumonia and hypoxia.  The
patient noted on the morning of presentation that he had
fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea where the
patient subsequently went to primary care physician's office
and was noted to have decreased oxygen saturation and an
electrocardiogram was significant for a first time episode of
atrial fibrillation.  The patient was given 50 mg of Cardizem
and then 20 mg Cardizem for conversion to sinus tachycardia
but this could not be maintained and the patient relapsed
into atrial fibrillation.  Vital signs taken at the time were
102.7 temperature, blood pressure 109/65, heart rate 133,
respiratory rate 40, oxygen saturation 90% on nonrebreather.
The patient was subsequently seen at [**Hospital **] Hospital and was
given three grams of Ceftriaxone, 100 mg Doxycycline and an
additional 20 mg of Cardizem and transferred directly to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit at [**Hospital1 188**].  At the Medical Intensive Care Unit, he was treated
with a course of Vancomycin and Levofloxacin and diagnosed
with MSSA, right middle lobe, right lower lobe septic
pneumonia.  The patient was subsequently intubated secondary
to failure to maintain adequate oxygen saturation.  By
[**2187-10-9**], the patient was successfully extubated and the
atrial fibrillation had spontaneously converted back into
sinus rhythm after a period of five days.  The patient was
subsequently transferred to the floor on [**2187-10-9**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Myotonic dystrophy.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin and Erythromycin which result in
[**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Location (un) **] syndrome.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Essentially nothing.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Significant for being a mutual fund manager
with a wife and daughter.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On presentation to the floor, the
patient was temperature 98.9, blood pressure 147/79, heart
rate 93, oxygen saturation 95% on six liters.  The patient
was a thin appearing male in no acute distress, alert and
oriented times three.  Head and neck examinations were clear.
Cardiovascular - regular rate and rhythm with S4 sound and I
to II/VI systolic murmur.  The chest examination was
significant for diffuse rhonchi, wet crackles bilaterally,
left lobe greater than right lobe, superiorly greater than
inferiorly, right lower lobe significant for egophony,
dullness to percussion and decreased fremitus.  The abdomen
was soft, nontender, nondistended with mildly decreased bowel
sounds.  Upper extremities had 4/5 strength of the abductor
pollicis and otherwise [**3-25**] throughout.  The lower extremities
were 5/5 strength.  All extremities were warm and well
perfused with 2+ pulses.  The patient was unable to rapidly
uncle[**Name (NI) **] fist.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 11.8, hematocrit
27.0, platelet count 478,000.  Partial thromboplastin time
57.1, prothrombin time 13.4, INR 1.2.  Sodium 143, potassium
4.4, chloride 107, bicarbonate 27, blood urea nitrogen 9,
creatinine 0.7, glucose 105, calcium 8.5, phosphate 3.6,
magnesium 2.1.  Arterial blood gases 7.53, 83 and 39.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was subsequently put on
telemetry on the floor and monitored.  Lovenox was given for
prophylaxis.   Echocardiogram and repeat electrocardiograms
were unremarkable.  Levofloxacin was continued at 500 mg on
the floor to complete a course of fourteen days.  The patient
began complaining of dysphagia on [**2187-10-9**], and this was
worked up with a Speech and Swallow study on [**2187-10-10**], which
demonstrated significant pharyngeal dysmotility.  The patient
was subsequently placed NPO and nasogastric tube was placed.
The patient received tube feeds until the day of discharge,
[**2187-10-15**].  The nasogastric tube was subsequently pulled and
the patient was sent for repeat Speech and Swallow which
showed significant dysmotility but slightly improved
swallowing pattern overall.  Given the patient's much
improved respiratory status and his isolated single episode
of atrial fibrillation which is thought to be secondary to
septic pneumonia, the patient was discharged for follow-up as
an outpatient for dysphagia.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Septic pneumonia.
2.  Myotonic dystrophy.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Omeprazole oral solution 30 mg p.o. once daily for ten
days.
2.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. once daily for thirty days.
3.  Sarna Lotion apply twice a day as needed to itchy areas
of skin for prescription for swallow therapy as an
outpatient.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient was scheduled for a repeat Speech and
Swallow consultation on [**2187-10-24**].  The patient has already
scheduled primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 702**].
The patient will also schedule follow-up chest x-ray in two
weeks.
