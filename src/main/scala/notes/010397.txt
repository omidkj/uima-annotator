Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory Failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis

History of Present Illness:
80 yo female who was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for failure to
thrive, anemia, and pneumonia treated with Levofloxacin;
discharged one week ago on [**10-19**] to rehab.  The patient then
desatted to the mid 80's, improved with supplemental oxygen and
brought to the ED.  In the ED, the pt was diaphoretic, febrile
to 101.2 with oxygen saturation in the 70's in room air.  An
initial ABG revealed respiratory acidosis with pH
7.22/92/151/40.  The patient was subsequently intubated for
hypercarbic respiratory failure, after which her blood pressure
dropped.  A right fem line was placed after a failed IJ and SC
attempts.   She received 3 liters of fluid and Levophed was
started.  She received a dose of Vancomycin and Clindamycin.
.
On arrival to the MICU the pt is intubated and sedated, history
obtained through medical chart.

Imaging
.
[**10-19**] CT Head w/o contrast
Paranasal sinus iflammatory changes. Otherwise normal study.
.
[**10-18**] CT Chest w/ contrast
1.  Persistent bilateral pleural effusions, but somewhat
smaller.
2.  Residual right lower lobe consolidation, but improved
opacities in the
right middle and lower lobes.
3.  New diffuse patchy nodular and ground-glass opacities, most
pronounced at the upper lobes with interlobular septal
thickening. This appearance has markedly progressed, and may
represent a worsening infectious or inflammatory condition.
.
[**10-18**] U/S Bil LE:
No DVTs
.
[**10-20**] CT Abd/Pelvis:
New small amount of ascites, persistent bilateral pleural
effusions, anasarca.  No evidence of retroperitoneal hemorrhage.

.
[**10-21**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) 2853**]
Moderate changes of cervical spondylosis and spinal canal
stenosis at C3-C4, C4-C5 and C5-C6 levels
.
[**10-21**] MR [**First Name (Titles) 430**]
[**Last Name (Titles) **] scattered tiny foci of restricted diffusion involving the
frontal convexity suggestive of a small tiny possibly embolic
subacute infarct.  Chronic periventricular microvascular
ischemic changes are also present.  There is no mass effect or
midline shift.  Further followup is suggested based on clinical
grounds.




Brief Hospital Course:
# Respiratory failure with hypercarbia - The patient did not
have a history of COPD, OSA, or obesity which could contribute
to hypoventilation/ CO2 retention.  Most likely etiology was a
mixed infectious and cardiogenic pulmonary edema, given pt was
recently treated for pneumonia complicated by pleural effusion.
CHF less likely given patient had [**Last Name (Titles) 61935**] EF function on
recent echo.  PE was ruled-out by CT-PA and neg U/S bil LEs.  Pt
was intubated and began broad spectrum abx
(Vanc/Zosyn/Levofloxacin) to cover for nosocomial organisms
given pt at rehab and possible aspiration pneumonia.  Pt's
sputum and BAL results failed to identify a pathogen likely to
cause pt's presentation.  Pt was difficult to wean from [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
large right pleural effusion was drained for both diagnostic and
therapeutic benefit; fluid anaysis revealed transudate w/o
further characterization or micro growth.  Pt was extubated on
[**2194-10-23**], but required significant diuresis and afterload
reduction in the face of hypotension to remain extubated over
the next several days.  Given continued poor performance and
unclear endpoint, family decided to maintain comfort measures
only w/ DNR/DNI; pt died a peaceful death in the company of her
family on [**2194-10-29**] at 00:10 due to respiratory failure due to
pulmonary edema caused by CHF.
.
.
# Hypotension - patient's blood pressure dropped to 70s systolic
after intubation, requiring pressors.  Pt received pressors and
steroids (poor [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim response) and was weaned from pressors
via IV fluid boluses over the next 24 hours.  Hypotension
remained an issue in the setting of pulmonary edema and
diuresis, with pt remaining borderline hypotensive in order to
limit pulmonary edema.
.
# Leukocytosis w/ left shift - pt was treated for pneumonia, but
pan-cultures failed to reveal a pathogen.
.
# ARF - brief prerenal azotemia improved with initial
resuscitation.
.
# Anemia - patient's baseline hct 22-26 from last admission.
Underwent evaluation by heme-onc service, thought to have anemia
of chronic disease and iron deficiency, but no obvious cause of
inflammation.  She had been started on iron replacement therapy
with plans for further work-up if no response.  Pt was
transfused following admission, and HCT remained stable until
pt's death.
.
# Cardiac - cardiac markers negative for acute MI; [**2194-10-9**] echo
revealed [**Month/Day/Year 61935**] EF >55%, mod MR, but BNP >3000 on admission;
likely diastolic dysfunction; afterload reduction and diuresis
to treat pulmonary edema were limited by hypotension.  Pt
ultimately died a peaceful death in the company of her family on
[**2194-10-29**] at 00:10 due to respiratory failure due to pulmonary
edema caused by CHF.
