Admission Date:  [**2192-3-17**]     Discharge Date:  [**2192-3-21**]


Service:  Coronary care unit

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 78-year-old male with
a history of coronary artery disease, back pain, and
hypertension who presents with intermittent chest pain and
nausea since two days prior to admission, who was transferred
from [**Hospital3 **] for further care.  The patient is status
post cardiac catheterization on [**2192-3-5**], for
exertional angina and chest tightness with radiation to his
jaw and arms.  At that time he had a left ventricular
ejection fraction of 45%, a right-dominant system with
3-vessel disease, showing a discrete 90% right left
ventricular lesion, a 20% to 30% proximal left anterior
descending artery, 70% D1, 60% D2, and 90% to 95% ramus
intermedius lesion.  He had no interventions at that time.
He was medically managed with aspirin, nitroglycerin patch,
and atenolol.  He had a previous exercise stress test in
[**2191-11-16**] in an outside system that showed possibly
inferior ischemia.  The patient self-discontinued his
nitro-paste two days prior to admission because of a
headache.  The patient subsequently developed sustained
substernal chest pain all day prior to admission and
presented to [**Hospital3 **].  The patient also had back pain
at the time and states that sometimes his back pain can
trigger the chest pain.  He had some mild nausea and
diaphoresis, some mild lightheadedness, and radiation to the
jaw.  Electrocardiogram there showed a paced rhythm.  The
patient was given aspirin and nitroglycerin.  His blood
pressure dropped to 50/32.  He was given IV fluids with his
blood pressure recovering.  The patient continued to have
chest pain intermittently, initially [**8-24**] to [**9-24**] and
improving to [**2-25**] to [**3-24**] with nitroglycerin.  At one point,
the patient's heart rate was noted to go from 20 down into
the 20s and 30s; although, this was not recorded, and there
was no evidence of pacer activations, so there was a
suspicion of pacer failure/pacer capture.  Again, the patient
was started on a nitroglycerin drip, but his systolic blood
pressure dropped to the 80s, and nitroglycerin was
discontinued.  The patient was started on heparin and
Integrilin with an initial creatine kinase of 247, and a MB
fraction of 30, and a MB index of 12%.  His troponin was less
than 0.3.  The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 346**] for further care.



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  Back pain with lumbosacral spondylosis.
 2.  Chronic right knee arthritis for which he tapes Ultram.
 3.  Hypertension.
 4.  Reactive airway disease.
 5.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy, status post transurethral
resection of prostate.
 6.  Macular surgery.
 7.  Coronary artery disease with chronic bradycardia.  He
had a DDD pacemaker placed for advanced AV block in [**2191-10-16**] when he presented with fatigue and bradycardia.
 8.  He is status post cholecystectomy.
 9.  He has peptic ulcer disease with no history of
gastrointestinal bleeding.
10.  He has B12 deficiency.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Included atenolol, nitroglycerin
patch, Vioxx, Valium p.r.n., Ultram p.r.n., albuterol p.r.n.,
Atrovent p.r.n.

ALLERGIES:  He has an allergy to CODEINE.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Include Integrilin, atenolol,
aspirin, and heparin, Flovent.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a retired electrical engineer.  He is
married with three children.  Lives with a friend by the name
of [**Name (NI) 26196**] [**Name (NI) 5108**] (phone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 29895**]).  He has two
daughters and a son.  His health care proxy is his daughter,
[**Name (NI) 553**] [**Name (NI) **] (phone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 29896**]).  He has no smoking
history.  He is full code but would not want to prolong
course of support.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination he was alert,
awake, and in no acute distress.  He was 6 feet 4 inches and
98 kg.  Temperature of 97.7, heart rate of 60, blood pressure
of 121/67, respiratory rate of 17.  He was
normocephalic/atraumatic.  Pupils were equal, round and
reactive to light.  Cranial nerves were grossly intact.  Neck
was supple.  His carotids were 2+ with no bruits.  He had no
significant jugular venous distention.  Heart had a regular
rate and rhythm with distant heart sounds.  No murmurs, rubs
or gallops were audible.  Lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  His abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended with normal active bowel sounds.  Extremities
showed no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  He had 2+ distal
pulses.  Right groin previous catheterization site had no
bruits or hematoma.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGY:  Electrocardiogram on admission showed
a rate of 60 with atrial ventricular pacing.  There appeared
to be approximately one QRS of slightly different morphology,
suggesting the possibility of failed pacer capture.

Chest x-ray showed no congestive heart failure, no effusions,
and no consolidations.

Troponin was less than 0.3.  Serial creatine kinases were 174
with a MB index of 6%, 111 with a MB of 6, and 129.   He had
a white blood cell count of 6.8, hematocrit of 45, platelets
of 243.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted with what appeared
to be unstable angina.  He did rule in for a myocardial
infarction with small MB leak.  The patient was stabilized
with Integrilin and heparin.  The patient was continued on
beta blocker with Lopressor.  His lipid levels were checked
and were found to be in good range.  His Integrilin was
subsequently discontinued, and the patient remained stable.

On [**3-19**], the patient was brought to the cardiac
catheterization laboratory where lesions were found that were
essentially similar to the previous cardiac catheterization;
however, the ramus intermedius lesion received angioplasty
and was stented.  The patient was started on a short course
of Integrilin and also started on aspirin and Plavix.  His
Lopressor dose was increased, and ACE inhibitor lisinopril
was also started.  The patient recovered well and was up and
walking with no subsequent chest pain or other symptoms.

The electrophysiology service was also consulted to examine
the patient's pacemaker given the possible report of failed
pacer capture, and the patient was found to be in good
condition with good capture and no other problems.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged to follow
up with his primary cardiologist.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
 1.  Imdur 30 mg p.o. q.d.
 2.  Lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. q.d.
 3.  Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
 4.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d. for one month.
 5.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
 6.  Atenolol.
 7.  Nitroglycerin patch.
 8.  Vioxx.









 9.  Valium p.r.n.
10.  Ultram p.r.n.
11.  Albuterol p.r.n.
12.  Atrovent p.r.n.
