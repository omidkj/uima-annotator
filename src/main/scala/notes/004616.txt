[**2188-4-7**]   CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECON  IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of PE.
2. Interlobular septal thickening with small left pleural
effusion,
suggestive of CHF.
3. Mediastinal and hilar adenopathy, may be reactive secondary
to CHF.
However, follow-up CT in 6 months is recommended to assess for
resolution.
4. Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
5. Stool-filled rectal vault, with suggestion of rectal
prolapse. Correlate
clinically.

Sinus tachycardia with PAC(s)
Possible inferior infarct - age undetermined
Lateral ST-T changes suggest myocardial injury/ischemia
Since previous tracing of [**2186-4-7**], ST-T wave abnormalities more
marked

[**2188-4-8**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
Since yesterday, lung volumes are lower. Left lower lobe opacity
increased, could be due to worsening pneumonia. Small left
pleural effusion is likely unchanged. Mild interstitial edema is
new. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
otherwise unchanged. Scoliosis is stable.




Brief Hospital Course:
82 y/o F with a history of COPD who presents with LLL Pneumonia
and anemia.

#. LLL Pneumonia:  Currently stable.  Patient has possible LLL
infiltrate on CXR, not seen on Chest CT the day before and is
unclear if this is related to her high WBC count.  Patient has
been saturating comfortably on 2L NC and transtitioned to room
air.  Patient has not had any recent antibiotic exposures to be
concerned for MRSA or ESBL bacteria.  Vancomycin/Ceftriaxone
were discontinued and the patient remained stable. She was
continued on levofloxacin.

#. Anemia, unclear etiology:  Patient has low retic count,
concern for possible MDS.  Patient was transfused 2 units PRBCs
overnight and HCT responded.  Patient likely has low baseline
HCT, unclear etiology.  Patient??????s NG lavage was negative, no
blood in stool.  Hemolysis markers were unremarkable.
Hematocrit remained stable. Patient's family declined further
work-up. Decision made not to provide additional blood
transfusions.
- continue home iron supplementation/bowel regimen

#. Sacral and left heal Decubitus Ulcers: Present on admission.
Albumin wnl.
- wound care consulted (see discharge paperwork for
recommendations)
- continue with adequate nutritional support
- reposition Q2hours, keep heal off bed

#. Dementia
- continued risperdal and effexor

#. hypothyroidism:  continued levothyroxine

#. Hypercholesterolemia:  continued simvastatin
.
# Leg pain: Patient with several month history of leg pain.
Appeared to have hyperesthesia with diminished sensation. Low
dose neurontin started with apparent good results, though
unclear if complaints of leg pain [**1-21**] cognitive status as was at
times distractible. Although, per daughter leg symptoms have
been an ongoing complaint.

Goals of care: The palliative care service was consulted to
assist with goals of care discussion with the daughter who is
the health care proxy, and the family declined further work-up
or aggressive treatment of medical issues. Plan was made to
continue level of care and will consult hospice service at
nursing home. The
