Attending:[**Attending Info 90680**]
Chief Complaint:
Increased edema and dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
70M with CAD s/p NSTEMI and PCI to the RCA, T2DM, HTN, HLD, and
COPD who presents with dyspnea and worsening edema. The patient
reports that abaout 2 - 3 days ago he began to feel SOB more
than baseline. This AM around 4 AM he awoke feeling "radically"
SOB and felt very air hungry. It did not improve in about an
hour at which time he decided to come to the ED. He reports that
he has also noticed an increased amount of swelling in his lower
extremities bilaterally over the last couple of days. The
patient denies substernal CP, however does report a feeling of a
pulled muscle over his left lower ribs a couple days ago. The
patient also endorses a subjective fever (feeling warm) and some
mild chills over the past 2 days. He denies cough, congestion,
muscle/joint pains, and dysuria. He also denies N/V/D.  The
patient denies orthopnea (but uses 2 pillows for comfort). He
also denies PND other than this AM. He reports medication
compliance and eats a heart healthy low sodium diet.

Of note, BP was well controlled at 126/78 during recent Atrius
outpatient visit on [**2137-10-15**].

He was previously admitted in [**5-/2137**] with edema and dyspnea and
was found to have an NSTEMI.  During that admission, he was
found to have 95% lesions in the RCA and LCx, he received a DES
to the RCA and POBA to the LCx after being declined for [**Year (4 digits) **].
He was also found to have mildly elevated intracardiac pressures
and pulm HTN that admission with mean PAP of 28 and mean PCWP of
16.  Subsequently he was admitted two separate times in [**7-/2137**]
with visual distubances and concern for CVA, it was thought he
had small embolic strokes after PCI but no new CVA was found on
repeat MRI.

In the ED, initial vitals were 88 179/81 28 100% on BiPAP.
Labs and imaging significant for proBNP of 2106 (no prior for
comparison). Initial trop was 0.03, ABG was 7.36/46/70/27 on
BiPAP.
Patient given Lasix 20mg IV, started on a nitro gtt.  He was
subsequently weaned off of BiPAP prior to transfer to the CCU.
Vitals on transfer were 98 72 141/55 18 100% off BiPAP.

On arrival to the floor, patient reports that he feels SOB, but
it is much improved. He denies CP and has no other symptoms.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of TIA, deep
venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of
surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. he denies recent  rigors. he denies exertional
buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were
negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Studies/Images:
EKG [**2137-10-17**]: Sinus rhythm. Minor lateral ST-T wave
abnormalities which are slightly more pronounced compared with
previous tracing of [**2137-7-26**].

CXR [**2137-10-17**]: IMPRESSION:  Moderate interstitial pulmonary edema
and pulmonary vascular engorgement reflecting cardiac
decompensation.

ECHO [**2137-10-18**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and basal
inferolatearl hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 45%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
c/w CAD. Mild mitral regurgitation.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2137-5-14**], the
findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
70M with a h/o CAD s/p NSTEMI and PCI to the RCA, T2DM
(A1c=6.8%), HTN, HLD, and COPD who presents with dyspnea and
worsening edema.
