HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 54-year-old gentlemen
with a past medical history significant for AIDS, most recent
CD4 count 99 and viral load greater than 300,000, congestive
heart failure, diabetes [**Company **] and history of lymphoma who
presents with a one week history of Voluminous diarrhea 10 to
positive abdominal pain which is diffuse, not related to foot
intake or bowel movements.  No nausea or vomiting.  Decreased
appetite and decreased po intakes times seven days.  Patient
does have a recent history of C. difficile toxin positive on
[**2187-9-18**].  He was treated with Flagyl for one week at
that time with good resolution of his diarrhea, but
subsequent recurrence in two to three weeks.  Also reports
to admission and rigors at home one day prior to admission.
He also noted decreased urine output for one to two days with
no urine output for 18 hours prior to admission.  He reports
weakness and fatigue, also, increased sensitivity to light,
flash photophobia for three days with accompanied neck
stiffness/pain which is new for him.  No confusion or mental
status changes.

In the Emergency Room, the patient was afebrile.  Blood
pressure was 62/36.  Respiratory rate was between 25 and 35
and heart rate was 100.  He was noted to have a creatinine of
4.3 with a baseline of 0.8.  An anion gap of 16, white blood
cell count of 9.8 with 18% bands.  Arterial blood gases
showed a pH of 7.36, pCO2 of 30, pO2 of 71.  Also notable is
five days history of Vioxx that he started for lower back
pain.  Also reports subjective shortness of breath for one to
two days.  No relationship to exercise.

In the Emergency Room, he was orthostatic by heart rate.
Urine and blood cultures were sent.  Chest x-ray showed mild
congestive heart failure.  Electrocardiogram was without
change.  Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin and Flagyl were initiated.
He was given four days of normal saline with minimal blood
pressure response.  Foley was placed with small amount of
concentrated urine output.

The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
because of his hypotension and acute renal failure.  He was
hydrated overnight and was transferred to the General
Medicine Floor the following day.

IMPRESSION:  This is a 54-year-old gentlemen with history of

perfuse diarrhea, fevers and chills found to be in acute
renal failure with a creatinine of 4.3 and hypotensive and
admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for one night,
transferred to the floor after receiving aggressive
intravenous hydration and starting antibiotics.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  Infectious Disease:  It was felt that the patient's
diarrhea was the most likely source of his fevers and chills
and had caused severe dehydration leading to hypotension,
acute renal failure with prerenal and intrarenal ATM effect.
Given his history of AIDS, a SMV cryptococcus [**Doctor First Name **] were
checked as were microsporidia, cryptosporidia, Isospora and
cyclosporia when these were negative.  Given his recent
consumption of shellfish, vibrio was also checked and this
was negative.  Given his increased white blood cells, count
with left shift and increased bands, as well as a guaiac
positive nature on the floor, bacterial cultures of stools
including Campylobac
