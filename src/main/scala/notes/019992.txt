Service:  CARD [**Doctor First Name 147**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72 year old gentleman
who has a history of known coronary artery disease status
post myocardial infarction in [**2121**] and [**2129**], who underwent a
PCI stent to the circumflex and right coronary artery in
[**2129**].  The patient underwent an exercise treadmill test in
[**2135-12-12**] which showed an ejection fraction of 27% and
was positive for evidence of ischemia.  The patient presented
to his primary care physician with increasing shortness of
breath and dyspnea on exertion times six months.  The patient
was referred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
cardiac catheterization.

Cardiac catheterization showed an left ventricular end
diastolic pressure of 30, PA pressures of 69/20, 100%
proximal left anterior descending lesion and 100% first
diagonal lesion, 100% mid circumflex lesion, 100% obtuse
marginal one, 100% right PDA and 100% RPL.  The patient had
an echocardiogram done at that time which showed left atrial
enlargement and global left ventricular hypokinesis.  No
aortic insufficiency, two plus mitral regurgitation, one to
two plus tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonary artery
hypertension and an ejection fraction of 20%.  The patient
was evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and scheduled electively for a
coronary artery bypass grafting.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Hypercholesterolemia.
3.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus, diet controlled.
4.  Status post renal cell carcinoma in [**2121**]; status post
nephrectomy with a baseline creatinine of 2.0 to 2.1.
5.  Status post perforated diverticulum in [**2135**], well healed
by colonoscopy.

PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Cozaar 50 mg p.o. twice a day.
2.  Lopressor 50 mg p.o. twice a day.
3.  Crestor 10 mg p.o. q. day.
4.  Imdur 60 mg p.o. q. day.
5.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q. day.
6.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q. day.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a physician in Addiction
[**Name9 (PRE) **].  He lives at home with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] denies
tobacco, occasional ETOH.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Significant for peripheral neuropathy and
mild anemia as well as the previously mentioned diverticular
disease and diabetes mellitus.

LABORATORY:  Preoperatively showed a hematocrit of 34.7 and
creatinine of 2.7.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2136-3-19**].  He was taken to
the Operating Room with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for a coronary artery
bypass graft times three with left internal mammary artery to
the first diagonal, saphenous vein graft to the left anterior
descending and saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 1.
Intraoperative TEE revealed and EF of 15% and 2+ MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]
improved to 30% postoperatively and the MR decreased to 1+.
The patient was transported to the Intensive Care Unit on
Milrinone, epinephrine and Levophed.  Please see operative
note for further details.
On the first postoperative evening, the patient had a large
volume requirement with a progressive acidosis and a
worsening lactate.  On the morning of postoperative day
number one, the patient had liver function tests done which
were significant for an amylase of 1700 which, on repeat, was
found to be 2700.  The patient's lactate at that time was
holding steady at 4.0.

A General Surgery consultation was obtained and a CT scan was
obtained which showed an unremarkable gallbladder, two small
granulomas in the right lobe of the liver, some fatty
infiltration of the pancreas without enlargement or fat
stranding around the pancreas, grossly patent celiac and
superior mesentery artery.  Hyper enhancement of the mucosa
of the large bowel with generalized edema of the entire
colonic wall and a question of pneumatosis in the descending
colon, moderate stranding around the cecum and a small amount
of free intraperitoneal fluid in the upper pelvis.  With
these findings, the General Surgery Team of Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was
significantly concerned for mesenteric ischemia and the
decision was made to take the patient to the Operating Room
for an exploratory laparotomy.

The patient was taken on postoperative day number one and
intraoperatively there were no findings of ischemic bowel.
The bowel wall was moderately thickened but no evidence of
vascular insufficiency was identified.  With these findings,
the patient was returned to the Intensive Care Unit in stable
condition with continued aggressive fluid resuscitation.  The
patient's vasopressors were weaned off.  The patient had good
hemodynamic numbers.  The patient had a low level acidosis
which resolved with administration of bicarbonate.  The
patient's creatinine which had been 1.8 on postoperative day
number one began to rise to 2.3 on postoperative day number
two and continued to rise and peaked at 3.0.

The patient also developed some hyperkalemia on postoperative
day number two.  Renal consultation was obtained and felt
that this was dye induced acute tubular necrosis in spite of
the patient receiving peri-procedure Mucomyst.  On
postoperative day number two, the patient was weaned and
extubated from mechanical ventilation without any difficulty.
The patient's hemodynamics remained good off all drips.

The patient's amylase was trending down.  By postoperative
day number three, the patient's potassium was stable and no
longer remained elevated.  The Renal Team felt that the
patient needed more fluid resuscitation and with which his
urine output increased.  The patient's chest tubes which had
been placed during the initial operation continued to have
significant amount of serous output.  The patient's albumin
had been checked and was found to be 1.7.  It was recommended
that the patient receive 25 grams of albumin as well as
taking chest tubes off suction; the chest tube output
decreased and the chest tubes were removed on postoperative
day number six.

On postoperative day number four, the patient's Pulmonary
catheter was removed.  The femoral arterial line was removed
and the patient got out of bed to sit in a chair.  At that
time, the patient began complaining of symptoms of vertigo
where he felt like the room was spinning.  The patient denied
any previous history of this.  The symptoms worsened over the
course of the day.

A Neurology consultation was obtained.  The Neurology
attending felt that perhaps the patient had some subtle
neurologic findings and recommended obtaining an MRI at a
future date as the patient could not have an MRI at that time
due to the staples on his incisions.

A CT scan obtained showed no acute process and no evidence of
a stroke.  By postoperative day number five, the patient's
creatinine had begun to decrease down to 2.1 with good urine
output.  Nephrology Team felt that the patient would continue
to progress and signed off.

During this time, the patient was noted to have
intermittently cool and ecchymotic toes and fingers with good
pulses.  It was continued intermittently throughout his
hospital stay.  The patient denied having any experience with
the same.  There was no evidence of vascular compromise and
when the cyanosis resolved, the digits became red in color.
It was eventually decided that this was possibly a new
expression of Raynaud's syndrome.  By postoperative day
number five, the patient was started on clear liquids.  The
patient was also noted to have a decrease in platelet count
and heparin antibody was sent which was subsequently
negative.  Chest tubes continued to have a moderate amount of
serous drainage.

The patient began working with Physical Therapy.  By
postoperative day number ten, the patient was transferred
from the Intensive Care Unit to the regular part of the
hospital.  The patient's diet had been advanced.  The
patient's p.o. intake gradually increased.  The patient was
started on Lasix with good diuresis.  The patient's chest
tubes were removed without incident without any evidence of
pneumothorax or pleural effusion.

On postoperative day number eleven, the pat
