Chest x-ray on admission with right base atelectasis and
right hilar prominence.

EKG:  Normal sinus rhythm, ST depressions in II, no peaked T
waves, and no change since last EKG.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Hypoxia:  Patient was admitted to the ICU in order to be
placed on BiPAP.  Given the initial read on the chest x-ray,
there was a concern for aspiration versus community acquired
pneumonia in the setting of immunosuppression.  He was
initially treated with levofloxacin, vancomycin, and Zosyn.
Given the concern congestive heart failure as a possible
contributor for exam, the patient had an echocardiogram,
which showed a moderately depressed left ventricular
function.

Following the institution of antibiotics, patient's oxygen
requirements markedly improved.  Subsequent chest x-rays
showed no evidence of clear pneumonia.  At time of discharge,
the patient was saturating 96% on 2 liters.  He will require
close following of his oxygen saturation with a hope to
gradually wean oxygen as tolerated.

2. Sepsis:  Patient has septic physiology on admission with
hypotension with systolic blood pressures in the 80s and
fever.  The differential diagnosis includes pneumonia, but
there was no evidence on chest x-ray, UTI, bacteremia
(history of MRSA bacteremia as well as Strep bacteremia),
cellulitis (no evidence on physical exam), other seeded sites
in the setting of prior MRSA bacteremia.  As such, the
patient will continue on levofloxacin and vancomycin to cover
for potential pneumonia as well as MRSA.  He will complete a
total 14-day course.

3. Acute renal failure:  Creatinine rose to a maximum of 2.4
from a baseline of 1.2.  The differential diagnosis included
ATN from transient hypotension versus cyclosporin, prerenal,
AIN (no new medications).  Patient had urine electrolytes
performed while he was in the unit with a FENa of 1%.
Sediment of his urine was consistent with tubular necrosis.
The Transplant Renal service was consulted, who felt that the
patient's acute tubular necrosis was likely secondary to his
transient episode of hypertension.

In order to rule out cyclosporin toxicity, a cyclosporin
level was drawn and his cyclosporin was held.  Cyclosporin
level returned at 114 indicating that patient was not toxic
on cyclosporin at admission.  Patient was restarted on home
doses of cyclosporin.  Patient also had a renal ultrasound on
admission of his transplanted kidney, which showed no
abnormalities.  Patient's creatinine gradually improved over
the course of admission with good urine output.  At time of
discharge, creatinine was 1.1.

4. Transaminitis:  Patient had a mild transaminitis with
elevated T bilirubin occurring late in the course.  This is
felt to be secondary to mild hypoperfusion during his
transient hypotensive episodes while in the unit.
Differential diagnosis included hepatic congestion secondary
to right heart failure and Zosyn toxicity.  Zosyn was
discontinued three days into the hospital course.  Hepatitis
panels were negative.

Patient's LFTs gradually trended down.  He will required
additional monitoring of his LFTs until they return to
baseline.

5. Anemia:  Patient's hematocrit gradually drifted down
following admission to 26.  Iron studies from [**2169-1-19**]
were consistent with anemia of chronic disease (iron 27, TIBC
224, ferritin 82).  Patient received 1 unit of packed red
blood cells and hematocrit was stable at time of discharge at
32.  Patient maybe considered for erythropoietin subcutaneous
injections as an outpatient.

6. Coronary artery disease:  Patient was noted to have a
troponin leak to 0.09 in the setting of hypoxia, acute renal
failure, and possible CHF.  There were no significant EKG
changes compared to prior EKGs.  No further workup was
pursued at this time, although an outpatient stress test may
be considered.

7. Coagulopathy:  Despite holding Coumadin on admission, INR
rose to a maximum of 5.4.  Patient received 2.5 mg of vitamin
K and subsequently patient's INR decreased to 1.4.  Coumadin
was restarted.  He will require monitoring of his INR as an
outpatient with a goal level of 2 to 3.

8. Hypertension:  In the unit, the patient was intermittently
hypotensive likely secondary to a sepsis physiology.  For
this reason, his antihypertensive medications were held while
he was seen in the unit.  However, following treatment with
antibiotics, patient returned to baseline hypertension and
his antihypertensives were restarted.  His blood pressure was
monitored closely.  His medications were gradually adjusted
over the course of his hospital stay.
