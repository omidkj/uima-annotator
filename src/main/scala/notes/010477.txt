Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
Status Epilepticus

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
* Arrived Intubated
* Transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells

History of Present Illness:
HPI (per notes, pt's family, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6330**] at [**Hospital 8**]
Hospital):
The pt, "[**Male First Name (un) **]," is an 80 year-old left-handed woman with a
past
medical history including a fib (on coumadin with therapeutic
INR), remote right basal ganglia infarct, and PVD s/p left
femoral-dorsalis pedis bypass on [**2180-11-21**] at [**Hospital 8**] Hospital
who was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] after she was discovered to be
in status epilepticus in the post-operative period.

Per report, the patient was in her usual state of health when
she
presented to the [**Hospital 8**] Hospital [**2180-11-21**] for the elective
vascular procedure designed to address peripheral vascular
disease with non-healing ulcers on the left foot.  Immediately
prior to the procedure, the patient's INR was 2.  Although the
pre-operative plan was to perform an in situ bypass, the veins
were not conducive to the procedure.  Accordingly, a synthetic
graft was placed in the course of an eight- to nine-hour
operation with LMA.  Although the patient was noted to be oozing
intra-operatively, a heparin drip was started per protocol.  To
compensate for a blood loss of approximately one liter, she was
given a total of three (two intra-operatively and one
post-operatively) units of packed red blood cells.  Records
indicate the patient's systolic blood pressure was below 80 for
approximately 30 minutes; neo was transiently administered.
Following the procedure, all sedatives and pressors were
discontinued.

In the two hours immediately following the procedure, the
patient
was thought to be reponsive to commands.  She could reportedly
open eyes to voice and squeeze the examiner's hand upon verbal
request.  Subsequently, she received morphine 2 mg IV x 2
presumably for pain.  Thereafter, she was found to be
"unresponsive."  On clinical examination, she demonstrated what
soulds like decorticate posturing to sternal rub.  She was
transferred to the ICU early [**2180-11-22**] for close monitoring.  A
non-contrast CT of the head was negative for acute hemorrhage
and
large territorial infarction.  Per records, she had intact
brainstem reflexes with flexor responses bilaterally.  On
[**2180-11-23**], an EEG revealed evidence of rhythmic sharp and slow
waves in the left (and sometimes right) hemisphere.
Accordingly,
dilantin 1 mg IV and ativan 2 mg IV was administered.  On
examination she was noted to withdraw all extremities to pain
with an extensor response on the left.  The patient was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and care.

MRI Brain ([**2180-11-24**]):
IMPRESSION: Multiple acute infarcts involving the left ACA, left
PCA and
right cerebellar region. Extensive small vessel disease and
brain atrophy.
.
MRA Head ([**2180-11-24**]):
IMPRESSION: Extensive flow signal irregularity in both middle
cerebral, both
anterior cerebral arteries as well as in the basilar artery
indicative of
atherosclerotic disease with areas of narrowing.
.
CT Head without Contrast ([**2180-11-26**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Multifocal infarcts, including the left ACA, and left PCA
territories, as
well as the right cerebellum, similar in appearance to MRI of
[**2180-11-24**]. No evidence of hemorrhagic transformation.
2. Extensive chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
.
EEG Monitoring:
[**2180-11-24**]:
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
Routine
sampling showed a diffusely slow and disorganized background
consisting
of mixed theta and delta frequencies. This is suggestive of a
moderate
to severe encephalopathy. There were no clearly epileptiform
features
on this study; however, the last file of routine sampling did
show .5 Hz
bursts of slowing occurring in the left hemisphere. It was
unclear if
this was truly left hemispheric or generalized as the right
hemisphere
was obscured by electrode artifact.
.
[**2180-11-25**]:
MPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
Routine
sampling showed a diffusely slow and disorganized background
consisting
of mixed theta and delta frequencies clinically consistent with
a
moderate encephalopathy. There were occasional bursts of L>R
bifrontal
slowing which, at times, were rhythmic. They were, however,
self-limited, brief, and without sharp features. There were no
epileptiform features on this recording.
.
Transthoracic Echocardiogram ([**2180-11-24**]):
Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity s
