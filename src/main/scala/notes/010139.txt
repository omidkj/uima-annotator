History of Present Illness:
This is a 75 year-old Female with PMH significant for CREST

anxiety disorder and Alzheimer dementia who presented with
several days of exertional dyspnea.
.
She was recently seen by her PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] 7-8 days of progressive
dyspnea with exertion, but she denies symptoms while at rest.
She associates this with excessive secretions and a chronic
productive cough which may have worsened over several days. She
also has had a few episode of loose, watery and non-bloody
stools. She is oxygen-dependent on 2L nasal cannula at home and
has noted no increasing oxygen requirements while at home over
the last week. When questioned what brought her to the ED, she
said her husband was worried about her exertional dyspnea. She
also notes some right lower extremity swelling for which she was
referred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED. She denies fevers or chills. No chest
pain. Exertional dyspnea noted. No headaches or vision changes.
Denies nausea, emesis or abdominal pain. Loose stools occurring
without hematochezia or melena. She denies recent antibiotic
use, denies recent travel or sick contacts. [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) **], she was
recently seen by her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2153-2-27**] with a prescription for
Azithromycin (prescribed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1007**] for symptoms noted above.
Last steroid dosing prescribed [**2153-1-21**]; taper
completed.
.
Of note, the patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2153-1-11**]
with weakness and anorexia in the setting of poor PO intake
without focal neurologic deficits, found to have acute renal
insufficiency, mild leukocytosis which responded to IV fluids
and PO intake with concern for failure to thrive. She had no
respiratory issues at that time and was discharged without
pulmonary concerns.
.
In the BIMDC ED, initial VS 98.8 106 140/59 28 without recorded
oxygen saturation. Exam notable for no acute distress and good
air movement without labored breathing. Lung exam noted diffuse
dry crackles with loud P2. 1+ lower extremity edema. Laboratory
studies notable WBC 14.0 (neutrophilia to 90%, no bandemia), HCT
23.9%, pro-BNP 506, Troponin < 0.01, lactate 1.4 and INR 1.0.
Metabolic panel with creatinine of 1.0 and phosphorus of 1.8.
U/A with trace protein and leukocyte esterase. A CXR showed
possible RLL infiltrate worse as compared with prior. She
received albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers, Lasix 20 mg IV x
1 and Levofloxacin 750 mg IV x 1. ABG showed 7.51/33/86/27. She
was admitted to Medicine on the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**].
.
On arrival to the Medicine floor, she was noted to have
increased work of breathing and had a respiratory rate of
greater than 40 bpm with accessory muscle use. Given concern for
impending acute respiratory failure she was transferred to the
ICU on 5L O2 via nasal cannula.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she appeared moderately anxious but was
in no acute distress and was speaking in full sentences. She had
no chest pain and denies dyspnea at rest.
