Chief Complaint:
Melena in stools

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 80 yo F from NH with PMH myelofibrosis
transfusion dependent with last transfusion last week, c.diff on
vanco, pulmonary hypertension in setting of chronic PE on
lovenox and aspirin who comes to ED after having abnormal labs
at NH.  Her son-in-law [**Name (NI) 95705**] she had no other complaints.  He
thinks that she may be a bit more anxious, but she is at her
baseline of dementia and delirium.

In ED 99.6, 110, 162/93, 18, 95%. Pt had reportedly dark
melanotic stool on rectal exam that was guaiac positive.  PT is
also on iron supplementation. In the ED, she had an episode of
epistaxis.  During admission in [**Month (only) **]/[**2122**] for MDR enterobacter
infected hematoma, pt had reported melanotic stool. GI was
consulted, but they deferred EGD given to risk benefits. On this
admission, She received 1L NS, K replacement. Typed/crossed for
two units of blood. Her HCT was decreased to 26.5 from 27.4 and
plts 1608.  INR 2.7 lactate 1.0. Nl lfts. UA pos WBC, leuk est
and nitrite, given IV cipro. Ucx sent CXR showed mild
atelectasis.

CLINICAL/LAB DATA: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 80 year old lady with
myelofibrosis diagnosed in [**2123-3-14**]. She has been receiving
PRBC
transfusions for ongoing anemia. Per our records, the patient
has had
21 non-reactive transfusions of PRBCs since [**2123-3-29**], with the
last two
units transfused on [**2123-5-15**]. Serial antibody screens had been
negative.
The haptoglobin and LDH levels from [**2123-6-24**] are within normal
limits. A
sample of the patient's blood from [**2123-6-22**] for type and screen
is
received.

LABORATORY TESTING:
Patient ABO/Rh: Group O, Rh negative
Antibody screen: positive
Antibody identity: anti-E
Patient antigen phenotype from [**2123-6-22**]: E-antigen negative
Units of blood transfused on [**2123-5-15**]:
Antigen phenotype for 04LJ09610: E-antigen negative
Antigen phenotype for 04FY06726A: E-antigen negative
DAT: negative
Eluate: negative

TRANSFUSION HISTORY:
21 previous non-reactive PRBC transfusions at the [**Hospital1 18**].

DIAGNOSIS, ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Based on the results
of the
antibody screen and panel, the patient has developed a new
anti-E
antibody. On antigen phenotyping, the patient's red blood cells
are
E-antigen negative. The anti-E antibody most likely developed as
a
result of prior antigen exposure, such as through recent
transfusions
either at the [**Hospital1 18**] or other institutions. The patient's last
antibody
screen prior to this from [**2123-5-15**] was negative. The last two pRBC
units
transfused at the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2123-5-15**] was negative for the
E-antigen.
The E-antigen is a member of the Rhesus blood group system. The
anti-E
antibody is clinically significant and can cause hemolytic
reactions in
the setting of E-antigen positive PRBC transfusions. The patient
will
receive E-antigen negative red blood cells for future
transfusions.
Approximately 71% of ABO compatible blood will be E-antigen
negative. A
wallet card and letter stating the above will be sent to the
patient.

Brief Hospital Course:
# SUMMARY: 80 yo F from NH with PMH myelofibrosis transfusion
dependent with last transfusion last week, c.diff on vanco,
pulmonary hypertension in setting of chronic PE on lovenox and
aspirin who presented with anemia.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# GI bleed: The patient presents with numerous risk factors for
a GI bleed: lovenox, asa, and elevated INR. Besides reported
melanotic stools, she did not have other complaints such as
abdominal pain, lightheadedness, or difficulty with bowel
movements. Rectal exam was guiac positive x 2 and thought to be
secondary to iron supplementation. Her Hct dropped from 26.5 to
21.7 during admission. She was made NPO, and was started on IV
fluids, pantoprazole 40 mg IV BID, and Q6H Hct checks. After
transition to the general medical floor, goals of care were
discussed and the decision was made to discontinue lab draws,
blood transfusions. Her HCT remained stable in the low 20s. She
was asymptomatic.
.
# Sepsis: Based on her HR and WBC count, she met SIRS criteria
on admission with the most likely source of her infection being
a UTI given her positive UA.  Other possible source was thought
to be leg hematoma, which was previously infected with MDR
enterobacter during her admission in [**2123-5-14**]. However the
wound on her leg was stable with minimal purulence or erythema.
PNA unlikely given her normal CXR. She was treated with
ciprofloxacin x 5 days. At the time of discharge, her SIRS
resolved, and her WBC was still elevated 18-20. Goals of care
were discussed and the patient was transitioned back to rehab
with the intent of no rehospitalization. She completed a course
of ciprofloxacin with extended coverage of her prior c-diff
infection with oral vancomycin.
