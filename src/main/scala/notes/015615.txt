                            **FINAL REPORT [**2201-2-24**]**

   Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2201-2-24**]):
      NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
           (Reference Range-Negative).
      Performed by Immunochromogenic assay.
      A negative result does not rule out infection due to other
L.
      pneumophila serogroups or other Legionella species.
Furthermore, in
      infected patients the excretion of antigen in urine may
vary.

Imaging:
CXR ([**2-23**]):
IMPRESSION: PRELIM: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY Study Date of [**2201-2-23**]
6:36 PM
FINDINGS: The visualized portion of the thyroid appears
unremarkable. There is no axillary or hilar lymphadenopathy.
Scattered mediastinal lymph nodes are seen, but none meet
pathologic size criteria. The aorta is of normal caliber along
its course without evidence of dissection or intramural
hematoma. The pulmonary arterial trunk is of a normal caliber
and there are no filling defects to the segmental level; less
definitive assessment of subsegmental level is secondary to
suboptimal bolus timing. The heart size is within normal limits
without evidence of right heart strain or pericardial effusion.
There is no pleural effusion and minimal bibasilar atelectasis
is present. The lungs are otherwise clear.

The visualized portion of the upper abdomen shows no gross
abnormality. The visualized portions of the bones shows no
aggressive-appearing lytic or sclerotic lesions.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of pulmonary embolism to the segmental
level.
Suboptimal evaluation of the subsegmental pulmonary arterial
branches due to suboptimal bolus timing.

Brief Hospital Course:
46 yo M with history of DMII, COPD, schizoaffective disorder,
and substance abuse found to be febrile and hypotensive on day
of admission. Went to the ED and received 5L of NS. Now with
continued orthostasis and tachycardia.
.
# Hypotension, Sepsis:
On admission on [**2-23**], met SIRS criteria with fever to 102.5 and
HR >90, also with signs of shock with hypotension to SBP in the
70s and lactate to 2.6. No infectious cause has been found upon
work-up in the ICU, with normal CT chest and pending blood/urine
cultures. No abdominal pain to suggest an abdominal source,
though given the history of atypical constipation, this may be a
concern. Given his cough, a blossoming pneumonia is possible but
CT looks excellent. Viral URI is likely. Flu unlikely. Fever,
hypotension and lactate have now resolved. Still with mild
tachycardia.  Patient never required pressors.  Received a total
of 500cc fluid in ICU and 5L fluid in ED.  Pt has been
hemodynamically stable throughout ICU stay.  Pt received
ceftriaxone and azithromycin in the ED and received no abx in
the ICU. Urine and blood cultures are pending. Urinary
legionella negative. He has had dizziness on standing many times
over the last few years. Most likely etiology is risperidone,
with high doses [**Hospital1 **]. Particularly since his orthostatic was not
particularly fluid responsive, it makes a central autonomic
cause much more likely.  Consider PT consultation on floor. Pt
has been taking frequent trips out of bed without problem.
- Improved on the floor after adequate hydration.  Viral URI
with volume depletion the most likely cause.  Continued
supportive care
.
# Diabetes: 266 --> 194 --> 145. have continued pt on ISS and
NPH qAM/PM
- resumed home regimen on discharge
.
# Schizoaffective: stable. continued risperidone and benztropine
.
# HL: stable. continued statin and aspirin.  HOWEVER, was noted
to be on Simvastatin 80mg daily.  Given new warning about liver
toxicity, decreased dose to 40mg daily, and recommended PCP
follow up
.
# Constipation: stable. continued colace and miralax PRN
