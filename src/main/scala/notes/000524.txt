Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2836**]

Abdominal pain

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 87141**] is a 60 y/o woman no known PMH who is transferred
from an OSH with presumed gallstone pancreatitis, increasing
leukocytosis, and fevers.

On [**9-20**] she presented to [**Hospital3 628**] with a 1-day history
of
epigastric transitioning to RUQ abdominal pain, non-bilious
emesis, and night sweats. Laboratory evaluation was notable for
WBC 13.9, Hct 48.9, lipase 10,000, TBili 1.06, alkaline
phosphatase, 115, ALT 115, AST 94. A RUQ ultrasound was reported
to show gallbladder wall edema with presence of gallstones and
CBD measuring 5mm with no evidence of intraductal dilatation.
She
was admitted to the ICU, given fluid resuscitation, started on
Unasyn.  She remained hemodynamically stable and her
amylase/lipase continued to trend down. She then developed
persistent tachycardia which was treated with metoprolol.  She
spiked a fever to 101.8 and began wheezing on hospital day 3,
and
a chest x-ray showed bilateral pleural effusions. The effusions
were felt to be secondary to significant fluid rehydration. With
aggressive pulmonary toilet, she improved clinically.

An MRI was obtained on [**9-25**] which reported a hemorrhagic
pancreatitis with a component of necrosis, severe inflammatory
changes, significant retroperitoneal fluid/ascites, and a
distended, fluid-filled gallbladder. MRCP showed no stone in the
CBD.  She remained hemodynamically stable but was later found to
have a R subclavian vein thrombus related to her CVL, which was
subsequently replaced.

On [**9-26**] she developed worsening wheezing and became tachypneic
with RR 30-40s. Her WBC count bumped to 21.4, however, her
amylase and lipase continued to decrease (57, 193). A CT abdomen
was performed and reported to show extensive necrosis of the
pancreas with a likely hemorrhagic component, as well as
cholecystitis. There was also reported to be a questionable area
of splenic vein compression due to inflammation. In addition to
her pleural effusions, a LLL opacification was identified,
atelectasis vs. consolidation. Due to concern for fatigue from
her persistent tachypnea, Ms. [**Known lastname 87141**] was intubated [**9-26**] PM.
Due to concern for worsening infection, bilateral pleural
effusions, and an uncertain source of leukocytosis, the patient
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and management.


Past Medical History:
Questionable history of asthma associated with URIs.
Hx of fibroid removal, appendectomy.


Social History:
Denied alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drug use.


Family History:
Significant for mesothelioma in her father.

         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.

RADIOLOGY:
[**2107-9-28**] CHEST PORT:
IMPRESSION:
1. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
2. Bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis, pleural fluid or
infection, if
clinically appropriate.

[**2107-10-3**] CHEST PORT:
FINDINGS:
Bilateral chest tubes are again visualized. No pneumothorax is
identified. The endotracheal tube has been removed. The left IJ
line tip is in the SVC. Feeding tube tip is off the film, at
least in the stomach, volume loss in the right lower lung has
increased slightly and there is persistent plate-like
atelectasis in the left lower lung.

[**2107-10-5**] CHEST PA/LAT:
There are persistent low lung volumes. There is mild-to-moderate
bilateral
pleural effusion, larger on the left side, associated with
adjacent
atelectasis. The upper lungs are clear. There are no new lung
abnormalities.
Left IJ catheter and Dobbhoff tube are in place in standard
position. There is no pneumothorax.

[**2107-10-13**] CHEST PA/LAT:
IMPRESSION: Mild increase in bilateral pleural effusions, left
greater than right. Dobbhoff tube tip now in fundus of stomach.

[**2107-10-13**] CT ABd:
IMPRESSION:
1. Large pancreatic pseudocyst essentially replaces pancreatic
