Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 81-year-old male
with a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, who
presents for elective catheterization in the setting of
worsening shortness of breath.  The patient had an exercise
tolerance test in [**2105-9-17**], which was positive for
inferior and inferolateral reversible defects.  He was
recently admitted from [**11-25**] to [**11-29**] with
congestive heart failure.  Echocardiogram at that time showed
an ejection fraction of 30% with focal left ventricular
hypokinesis and posterolateral akinesis and 1+ MR.  Over the
past several weeks, the patient has had increasing dyspnea on
exertion.  He is unable to walk more than 25 yards without
dyspnea.  He also notes increasing lower extremity edema
bilaterally.  He does not note any chest pain, diaphoresis,
nausea, vomiting, palpitations, lightheadedness.  He was seen
by his primary cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  He now comes in for
elective cardiac catheterization.

History is also notable for chronic renal insufficiency and,
thus, he will require close observation and optimization
prior to catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, as outlined above.
2.  Congestive heart failure, as outlined above.
3.  Atrial fibrillation, status post pacer placement in [**2103**].
4.  Prostate cancer.
5.  Embolic CVA, no residual deficits.
6.  Chronic lymphedema.
7.  Diabetes mellitus type 2.
8.  Hypertension.
9.  Skin cancer.
10. Degenerative joint disease.
11. Chronic renal insufficiency.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to PENICILLIN, SULFA,
DYE, AND SHELLFISH.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Coumadin 5 mg p.o.q.d.(held).
2.  Lasix 80 mg p.o.b.i.d.
3.  NPH 50 units p.o.q.a.m.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the following:
Temperature 97.9, blood pressure 114/58, pulse 70,
respirations 18, oxygen saturation 95% on room air.  HEENT:
Unremarkable.  Neck was supple with jugulovenous pulsation at
10-cm.  There is no thyromegaly.  There are 2+ carotids with
no bruits.  LUNGS:  Crackles at the bases bilaterally.
HEART:  Heart is regular in rate and rhythm, with no rubs,
murmurs, or gallops.  ABDOMEN:  Obese, normal bowel sounds,
soft, nontender, and nondistended.  EXTREMITIES:  Extremities
have 3+ edema to the thighs bilaterally and stasis changes
and skin breakdown in the leg bilaterally.  NEUROLOGICAL:
The patient is alert and oriented times three.  The strength
is [**3-21**] bilaterally.  Sensation and reflexes are normal.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data revealed the following:
Significant for hematocrit of 31.0, platelet count 148,000,
potassium 4.4, BUN 52, creatinine 2.5.  (baseline creatinine
1.8 to 1.9).  The INR is 3.1.

Chest x-ray:  ([**2104-12-10**]):  Increased pleural
effusions bilaterally.

EKG:  HA and V paced.  No acute ST or T changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 81-year-old man with diabetes,
hypertension, congestive heart failure, chronic renal
insufficiency, who presents with progressive dyspnea on
exertion.  He was admitted for elective catheterization.  He
does not have any additional signs or symptoms of coronary
artery disease.

Hospital course by systems is as follows:

#1.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient was ruled out for
myocardial infarction.  He was continued on aspirin and beta
blocker.  He underwent coronary artery catheterization on
[**1-4**], which showed no significant coronary disease.

#2. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  The patient was initially
diuresed as it was felt that he was in significant congestive
heart failure.  He was briefly transferred to the Coronary
Care Unit, where a Swan-Ganz catheter was placed which showed
normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, but elevated right
sided pressures. He was, therefore, transferred back to the
floor to await coronary catheterization.  Diuresis was held
at that point.  The patient was taken off an Ace inhibitor
and placed on Hydralazine for afterload reduction secondary
to his chronic renal insufficiency.  At cardiac
catheterization on [**1-4**], the patient was found to
have elevated left and right side filling pressures, as well
as pulmonary artery hypertension (pulmonary artery pressure
59/21; pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 21).  These
elevated filling pressures explained the patient's left heart
and right heart failure symptoms.  However, the etiology of
his failure is unclear.  The patient will need further
evaluation, especially of pulmonary disease to explain his
right heart failure.  The patient would benefit from a chest
CT as an outpatient and perhaps a VQ scan to evaluate for
pulmonary embolism.  In the meantime, the patient is
continued on Hydralazine and nitrates for afterload
reduction, as well as Lasix 80 mg p.o.b.i.d. for gentle
diuresis.

#3.  PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  The patient's Coumadin
was held while he was hospitalized.  The rhythm was
consistently A-V paced.  He should be started back on his
Coumadin at his usual dose of 5 mg p.o.q.h.s. on discharge.
He also gets 7 mg p.o.q.h.s. on Sunday and Monday.  The INR
should be followed closely until it is therapeutic at 2 to 3.

#4.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient had a Foley catheter
placed for fluid monitoring.  He was found to have a urinary
tract infection and Levofloxacin renally dosed was begun for
a five-day course.  The last dose will be on [**1-6**].

#5.  CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY:  The patient has a baseline
creatinine of 1.7, creatinine is now stable at 2.2 to 2.5.
He was given Mucomyst and hydration before his
catheterization.  Following the catheterization, the patient
was placed on Hydralazine and nitrates for afterload
reduction.  His creatinine should be followed closely for
several days to assure that it is stable and at a new
baseline.

#6.  ENDOCRINE:  The patient has a history of insulin
dependent diabetes mellitus type 2.  He was continued on NPH
and a regular insulin sliding scale.  His blood sugars were
in good control.

#7.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient had a hematocrit drop following
the catheterization and he was transfused three units of
packed red blood cells.  There was no evidence of bleeding.
There was no evidence of hemolysis.  The hematocrit remained
stable following the transfusions.  The patient also had a
drop in his platelet count to a level of 90 while on heparin
in the Intensive Care Unit.  The heparin was discontinued and
the platelets rose back to his baseline of 150,000.  However,
HIT antibodies were negative.

CODE STATUS:  Full.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient is discharged in good
condition to a rehabilitation hospital.  He will require
[**Hospital 3058**] rehabilitation as he was seen by the Department of
Physical Therapy and felt not to be ambulating his baseline
and safe to return home.  He will need close followup with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of the Department of Cardiology, as well as
Dr.  [**Last Name (STitle) **], who is his primary care physician.

The patient's INR, potassium, BUN and creatinine should be
followed closely until stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Congestive heart failure.
2.  Pulmonary artery hypertension.
3.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
4.  Diabetes mellitus type 2.
5.  Status post coronary catheterization.
