Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia and chest pain at dialysis.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Ligation of LUE AV fistula.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1728**] is a 67-year-old woman with multiple medical problems,
including ESRD on HD, CAD s/p stent, CHF EF 45%, COPD, and DM,
who was initially admitted to the transplant surgery service on
[**2199-8-14**] for ligation of LUE AV fistula due to steal symptoms.
Per notes, operative course was unremarkable, and patient was
sent for dialysis per routine on [**2199-8-15**].  While at the terminal
end of her routine dialysis session today, patient reportedly
became hypoxic to 80s. She was placed on a NC with initial sats
83% 4L NC. She became tachypneic and reportedly complained of
chest pressure. EKG was unchanged, and patient was placed on NRB
with gradual improvement in symptoms. O2 sat improved to 100% on
NRB within minutes. She was unable to tolerate nebulizer
treatments. Patient denied any diaphoresis. Chest pressure
lasted approximately ~1-2 minutes, self-resolved. ABG done while
at MICU showed 7.44/48/105. 1.8 L had been removed at dialysis.

.
On arrival to the MICU, patient reported that she was feeling
much better. Denied any chest pain. Reported breathing was
improved but not back to baseline. No diaphoresis. No headache,
fevers, chills, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting.  She was
stabilized in the MICU and was transferred to the Medicine
floor.
.
On arrival to the medicine floor, the patient mentioned that she
has only had a small BM in the past five days; otherwise, no
complaints.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1728**] is a 67-year-old woman with multiple medical problems,
including ESRD on HD, CAD s/p stent, CHF EF 45%, COPD, and DM,
who was initially admitted to the transplant surgery service on
[**2199-8-14**] for ligation of LUE AV fistula due to steal symptoms.
She became hypoxic to the 80's and complained of chest pressure
at the end of her routine dialysis session with initial sats of
83% 4L NC.  She was transferred to the MICU for respiratory
distress, which resolved, and then to the medical team for
further management.
.
# Respiratory Distress: Cause of hypoxia and chest discomfort
were not clearly found.  While in the ICU she was ruled out for
cardiac ischemia with serial enzymes.  Additionally, she was
given neb treatments for dyspnea.  Etiology continued to be
unknown, but respiratory distress resolved. Pt with known DVT in
LUE. Continued nebs for COPD.
.
# Subclavian thrombosis near HD catheter: Her left arm was noted
to have increased swelling and discoloration, and ultrasound was
done to evaluate the graft area.  A subclavian thrombosis was
found near the left subclavian dialysis catheter and heparin was
started. A CTA was also done to assess for PE in order to gauge
duration of anticoagulation. This showed no PE; thus,
anticoagulation is only needed for 1 month. Began coumadin for
anticoagulation and continued heparin drip until therapeutic.
Did not pull port because of theoretical risk of dislodging clot
as well as disrupting access throughout arm and possible emboli.
Towards end of hospitalization, pt became uncooperative with
medical team, refused medications and labs, and demanded
discharge.  Her heparin drip was discontinued, and she continued
on coumadin; however, her INR was too high towards the end of
admission, so it was held.  She was discharged with instructions
to hold her coumadin dose until labs were drawn at her home and
her PCP could advise her on how to achieve the correct
thereupeutic level.
.
# CAD s/p stent: No further c/o chest pain while in MICU and on
medicine floor.  She was ruled out for MI after transfer to the
MICU with no EKG changes observed with acute episode. Continued
outpatient ASA, BB, ACE, Statin, Plavix
