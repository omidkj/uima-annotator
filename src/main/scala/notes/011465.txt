Service:  Trauma

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 33211**] is an 18-year-old
male who was brought to the [**Hospital1 188**] Emergency Room after a stabbing during an altercation
at a party.  He was found to have stab wounds in the left
buttock and axilla.

En route he was found to be unstable and unresponsive.  He
was resuscitated with recovery of mental status.  In the
trauma bay, he had hypotension and tachycardia.  He was
believed to be in shock.  He was intubated and a left-sided
chest tube was placed, and a trauma ultrasound was performed
showing free fluid in Morison pouch.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   He has no known past medical history.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  He has no past surgical history.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  None.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On examination, he was
combative and pale.  Pupils were equal and reactive.  Lungs
were clear bilaterally.  There was a 3-cm laceration in the
left axilla, and he was tachycardic.  His abdomen was mildly
distended without tenderness.  There was a 5-cm laceration on
the left buttock with active bleeding.  Rectal showed normal
tone.  His extremities were cool, modeled, and he had weak
distal pulses.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  His initial
laboratory results in the trauma bay revealed a white blood
cell count of 6.6, hematocrit of 31, platelets of 216, and an
INR of 1.6.  His chemistries were remarkable for a creatinine
of 1.5 and a glucose of 380.  His toxicology screen was
remarkable for an ethanol level of 132.  Initial blood gas
was 7.05/43/439/13 and -18 with a lactate of 11.4.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   He was taken to the operating room
emergently for an exploratory laparotomy.

In the operating room, the patient underwent an exploratory
laparotomy with control of left iliac bleeding, control of
hepatic laceration, packing of the abdominal cavity, and a
segmental resection of the rectosigmoid area of perforation.
The bowel was left stapled as a Hartmann and was a blind end
and was not matured as an ostomy.  There was a question of
nerve injury to the lumbosacral plexus.

The patient left the operating room and was taken to the
Intensive Care Unit for further resuscitation and
stabilization.  It was opted not to close his abdomen or
mature stoma at the time.

Over the course of the next day in the Intensive Care Unit,
the patient remained critical.  He was sedated with morphine
and Ativan drips, and paralyzed with Cisatracurium and placed
on Protonix prophylactically.  He received Ancef and Flagyl
for perioperative coverage.

He returned to the operating room on postoperative day one
for removal of his packs.  There was no further bleeding, and
his fascia started to be closed partially.  Again, the Argon
beam coagulator was used to achieve hemostasis.  He was
returned to the Intensive Care Unit for further management.
Lower extremity noninvasives studies revealed no evidence of
deep venous thrombosis.

He was returned to the operating room again on [**1-25**] for
further closure of his abdominal wound.  He was returned to
the operating room again on [**1-27**] for further abdominal
wall closure, maturation of colostomy, and V.A.C. dressing
placement.  Total parenteral nutrition was initiated for
metabolic support.  Antibiotics were narrowed to Kefzol
alone.  Antibiotics were then switched to vancomycin to cover
gram-positive cocci in his sputum Gram stain.  Levofloxacin
was subsequently added for gram-negative rods in sputum
culture which eventually were identified Escherichia coli.

The patient remained critically ill in the Intensive Care
Unit and on aggressive ventilatory support, nutritional
support, and antibiotics.

On [**1-31**], he was noted to have left upper extremity edema.
A left upper extremity ultrasound revealed left internal
jugular thrombosis.  A previously placed central line had a
positive tip, and it had been removed.  After his abdominal
wall closure, his abdomen was found to be soft but tight with
bladder pressures ranging from 20 to 30.  Urine output was
adequate, and this pressure subsequently resolved over time.

On [**2-1**], he had an abdominal ultrasound that showed
pelvic fluid collections which were not drained at that time.
On [**2-2**], a CT of the abdomen revealed a left lower
quadrant abscess and a pigtail drain was placed.   On
[**2-3**], a pigtail was placed in the right lower quadrant,
and he was found to have an evolving liver hematoma.

On [**2-4**], he returned to the operating room for
exploratory laparotomy for spiking fevers and elevated white
blood cell count.  There was an area of hepatic necrosis that
was cultured but not debrided.  Drains were placed, and the
abdomen was closed with V.A.C. dressing once again.

Throughout this time, the only significant cultures were
Escherichia coli and yeast from the sputum.  Antibiotics
remained vancomycin and levofloxacin.

An Infectious Disease consultation was obtained on [**1-29**].
They encouraged changing from levofloxacin to Zosyn as well
as culturing chest tube drainage.  A workup of his fever and
white blood cell count included a transesophageal
echocardiogram that showed no evidence of an endocarditis and
normal left ventricular function.

The patient was finally taken back to the operating room on
[**2-4**] for exploratory laparotomy for these spiking fevers
and elevated white blood cell counts.  It was noted that the
hepatic necrosis was drained but not debrided.  Fluconazole
was also added for yeast coverage.

Early in the morning on [**2-6**], the patient was found to
have bleeding from the Penrose drain in his left buttock
incision.  There was no active bleeding at the time of
examination.  His hematocrit was found to be down from 24
to 21.  A CT scan obtained at that time showed evidence of
extravasation from the left internal iliac branch.  The
patient subsequently went to angiography for embolization of
a left gluteal pseudoaneurysm.  Embolization was successful
with complete occlusion of the AV fistula and hemodynamic
stability following the procedure.  Tube feeds were also
started on [**2-6**]; however, total parenteral nutrition was
continued to provide adequate nutritional support.  The
patient's ventilatory mode was changed over to CPAP pressure
support, and he weaned well.

A follow-up abdominal CT on [**2-7**] showed a collection in
the left hemipelvis, and a pigtail was placed under CT
guidance.  Vancomycin was added back to the antibiotic
regimen on [**2-9**] from gram-positive isolated just from
blood.

A CT of the abdomen on [**2-11**], for continued fever and
elevated white count, showed no new collections.  A follow-up
CT on [**2-13**] was similar.  A CT venogram done at that time
was negative, and a Duplex of the lower extremities was also
negative.  Cultures from his various drains over the next two
weeks subsequently grew Escherichia coli and Bacteroides
sensitive to levofloxacin and Flagyl.  His antibiotics were
tailored appropriately.

He was extubated on [**2-12**], and he was started on sips, and
the Psychiatry Service consulted for support.  Of note, the
patient had been on subcutaneous heparin, heparin in his
total parenteral nutrition, and then subsequently Lovenox for
deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis.

He was transferred to the floor on [**2-16**] where his diet
was advanced slowly.  He continued to work with Physical and
Occupational Therapy.

On the evening of [**2-19**], the patient was found to be
tachypneic and hypertensive.  A chest x-ray was unremarkable.
However, given his significant history, a CT angiogram was
performed of the chest to rule out pulmonary embolism.  This
was negative, but it was decided that the patient would
return to the Intensive Care Unit for closer monitoring.

A CT of the head was also performed for question change in
mental status, and it was negative.  Another CT of the
abdomen was performed with placement of yet another pigtail
drain in the left pelvis.

He was transferred back to the floor on [**2-23**] where he
continued t
