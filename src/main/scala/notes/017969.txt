Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
STEMI, s/p PCI with RCA perforation at OSH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IABP and Swan ganz catheter placement [**4-22**]
RVAD placement [**4-22**]

History of Present Illness:
64 M with htn and hyperlipidemia admitted to OSH for elective R
knee replacement. Post-operatively, he developed symtpoms of
indigestion and chest pain with STE's in the inferior leads. He
was sent to [**Location (un) 80662**] for catheterization.
Apparently, two days prior to his surgery he reported
intermittent chest pain to his wife that he minimized.
Pre-operatively, there were no EKG changes compared to prior
tracings.
.
At OSH cath, he was found to have a right dominant system and
had subtotally occluded RCA. There was 60% mid LAD and 80-90% D1
disease; no disease in Lcx. Thrombectomy of the RCA lesion was
performed. The procedure was complicated by a perforation and
dissection of his RCA. A 9x20 balloon was deployed at the
perforation and he was started on Neo and Dopamine for
hypotension. He also had a bradycardic arrest and needed
temporary pacing. He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
At catherization here, he was semi-electively intubated. His
pressures dropped and a balloon pump was placed with Neo and
Dopamine running. Two coated stents were placed at RCA along
with one BMS distally. He is then transferred to the CCU.
.
ROS: From his wife, he had been feeling well prior to surgery:
denies SOB, stable 2 pillow orthopnea, stable mild ankle edema,
no PND, no claudications, no stroke, no bleeding disorder, no GI
bleeding, no palpitations, no syncope.

Conclusions
Study performed in the CVICU, under sedation, with care team
present to dynamically assess RVAD weaning. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or
left atrial appendage. The right atrium is dilated. The
interatrial septum is dynamic and bows into the left atrium but
no atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The right ventricular cavity is dilated.
There is severe hypokinesis of the basal and mid right
ventricular free wall with sparing of the right ventricular
apex. Comparted to the study from [**2116-4-22**], the basal and mid
walls appear improved. With weaning of RVAD support, little if
any change in right ventricular size and/or function is
appreciated. No changes are appreciated in the left ventricle
either. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. The
descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Very trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is a small pericardial effusion.
There is a left pleural effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in
person of the results in the ICU at the time of the study.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Small RV cavity. Severe global RV free wall
hypokinesis.

AORTA: Mildly dilated ascending aorta. Simple atheroma in
descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was monitored by a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 9833**]
throughout the procedure. The patient was monitored by a nurse
in [**Last Name (Titles) 9833**] throughout the procedure. The patient was sedated
for the TEE. Medications and dosages are listed above (see Test
Information section). Image quality was suboptimald - poor
esophageal contact. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm.
Compared with the findings of the prior study, the findings are
similar. Echocardiographic results were reviewed by telephone
with the MD caring for the patient.
Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler but marked bowing of the intra-atrial septum leftward
was noted, indicative of elevated right-sided pressure. Overall
