CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 58-year-old gentleman
with multiple medical problems including paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation status post ablation at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2114-3-19**]
followed by a prednisone taper started by the
Electrophysiology Team for PV stenosis who presents status
post ablation with shortness of breath.  Per the patient, he
had an uneventful postablation course until noon of [**2114-3-20**],
when he noted an acute onset of shortness of breath, wheezing
and extreme dyspnea on exertion.  He denied chest pain,
dizziness, diaphoresis, nausea, and vomiting.  The patient's
family took him to [**Hospital **] Hospital for workup where vitals
showed a temperature 101.3 degrees, heart rate 122, blood
pressure 237/137, respiratory rate 48 and oxygen saturation
81 percent on room air.  At this hospital, EKG showed sinus
tachycardia with a rate of [**Street Address(2) 33115**] depression in V5
through V6.  CT scan was reported as negative for PE or
effusion.  However, chest x-ray showed extensive bilateral
infiltrates.  The patient received morphine, Tylenol,
Rocephin and azithromycin.

The patient was then transported to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] Emergency Department, his temperature was 96.8
degrees, blood pressure 123/86, heart rate 83, respiratory
rate 28 and oxygen saturation 97 percent on a nonrebreather.
At that time, he received clindamycin for his bilateral
infiltrates.  EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with a rate of
83 and no ST-T wave changes.  The patient was then
transferred to the [**Last Name (un) 19424**] Intensive Care Unit for further
management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Atrial fibrillation.  The patient has
had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation for 15-20 years and has
been in persistent a-fib for approximately 7 months.  He had
underwent a failed cardioversion.  Therefore, patient
underwent an ablation at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2114-3-19**].

C5-C7 bilateral fracture status post cervical fusion.  The
patient was in a [**Location (un) 2848**] collar at the time of admission.

Hypertriglyceridemia.

Hypertension.

The patient underwent an ETT-MIBI in [**2111**].  He exercised for
9.5 minutes on the [**Doctor First Name **] protocol with an EF of 51 percent.

Gout.

GI bleed in [**2105**].

Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Left inguinal hernia repair.

Bilateral shoulder surgery.

Chronic renal insufficiency.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is from [**State 3908**] where he has
worked as a pipe welder.  He is married.  The patient quit
smoking in [**2087**].  Positive alcohol with 1-2 drinks per [**Known lastname **].

ALLERGIES:  ZANAFLEX.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d.
2. OxyContin 200 mg by p.o. b.i.d.
3. Cartia XL 180 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4. Lopid 600 mg b.i.d.
5. Allopurinol.
6. Valium 10 mg by p.o. t.i.d.
7. Coumadin.
8. Diovan/hydrochlorothiazide 160 mg/25 mg, 1 tablet q.a.m.,
   and [**11-24**] a tablet q.p.m.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 98.5 degrees,
heart rate 80, blood pressure 139/77, respiratory rate 25,
oxygen saturation 93 percent on a nonrebreather.  General:
Nontoxic-appearing patient on a non re-breather.  The patient
is in a stiff neck brace.  HEENT:  Extraocular motions
intact.  Pupils equal round and reactive to light.  Moist
mucous membranes without jaundice.  Neck collar in place.
Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm.  S1, S2.  No murmurs, rubs
or gallops.  Lungs:  Coarse throughout without egophony.
Abdomen:  Distended, decreased bowel sounds.  Soft.
Nontender.  Extremities:  1 to 2 plus pitting edema with
dopplerable distal pulses bilaterally.  Neurologic:  Alert
and oriented x3.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 15.2,
hemoglobin 10.5, hematocrit 30.2, and platelet count 246.  PT
14.4, PTT 39.3 and INR 1.4.  Reticulocyte count 3.  UA
negative for signs of infection.  Chemistries:  Sodium 137,
potassium 4.7, chloride 104, bicarbonate 21, BUN 29,
creatinine 1.3, glucose 176, CK 66, troponin 1.65, vitamin
B12 250, folate 19.5, ferritin 469, TRF 221, and TSH 0.58.

Chest x-ray:  Findings could be consistent with asymmetric
pulmonary edema secondary to CHF superimposed on emphysema.
Alternately, could represent aspiration pneumonia.  There are
bilateral patchy lower lobe opacities, predominantly in the
right lower lobe.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusions.
Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Pulmonary:  On admission,
severe flare of pneumonia in this patient with the elevated
white count, fever and findings on chest x-ray.  This further
could be consistent with a community-acquired pneumonia,
aspiration, or ventilator-associated/nosocomial process.  The
patient was started on vancomycin and Zosyn following the
admission to the Smart Intensive Care Unit.  The
Electrophysiology team was contact[**Name (NI) **] and steroids were
discontinued.  After the initiation of antibiotics and mild
diuresis, patient's oxygen saturation improved dramatically.
Blood, serum, and Legionella antibody cultures were obtained.
Antibiotics were changed to ceftriaxone and azithromycin with
plan for a 10-[**Known lastname **] course.  The patient continued to improve
from a pneumonia/infectious pulmonary status throughout the
admission.  On [**2114-3-28**], a Pulmonary consult was obtained,
and they felt that broad-spectrum antibiotics were not
indicated in this patient.  They felt that he had not had an
infectious etiology, but his pulmonary decompensation was
most likely multifactorial with the main factors including
congestive heart failure and severe underlying COPD.
Cultures have been negative to date and the patient was
afebrile.  Antibiotics were discontinued at this time.
Throughout the admission, the patient was treated for
symptoms of congestive heart failure.  He was carefully
diuresed with Lasix.  In addition, it was felt by Pulmonary
that the patient had much more severe underlying COPD than
previously recognized.  He was treated with inhalers and
nebulizers.  The patient will need outpatient pulmonary
function tests as an outpatient when he is fully recovered.

Atrial fibrillation status post ablation:  The patient
remained in normal sinus rhythm throughout the admission.  He
was continued on amiodarone.  In addition, he was
anticoagulated with Coumadin with a goal INR of [**12-26**].  His
Coumadin was adjusted throughout the admission in light of
alteration and metabolism by the antibiotics to maintain him
within the therapeutic range.

Cardiac:  The patient was ruled out for MI on admission.  He
had negative CK-MB.  His troponins were elevated secondary to
the recent ablation but had been trending down.  On [**2114-3-26**],
an echo was obtained to further evaluate the patient's
cardiac function.  This showed the left and right atrium to
be moderately dilated.  The left ventricular cavity was
mildly dilated but regional ventricular wall motion was
normal.  Overall, LVEF was low normal ranging from 50-55
percent.  Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
was normal.  Aortic root was normal in diameter.  Moderate to
severe mitral regurgitation.  Mild tricuspid regurgitation.
No pericardial effusion.  Late in the admission, the patient
developed chest pain radiating from his sternum to the back.
He described this as extremely severe in nature.  A CTA was
obtained to rule out for PE, which was negative for pulmonary
embolism on [**2114-3-25**].  A Cardiology consult was obtained.
They felt that the patient's symptoms were consistent with
pericarditis, which is often seen following ablation.  The
patient was incredibly reluctant to take nonsteroidals for
his pain as he had an increase in his creatinine while on
these medications in the past.  Therefore, he declined this
medication for several [**Known lastname **].  However, he eventually took the
medication with good relief of his pain.  However, it was
discontin
