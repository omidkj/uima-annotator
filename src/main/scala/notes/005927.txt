Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
39 M smoker, no PMH p/w several days of fever, cough, sore
throat, found to have bilateral pneumonia and hypoxia.
.
Patient had > 1 week cough and sore throat.  Seen in PCPs office
[**1-28**] prescribed robitussin. Seen again [**2-2**] prescribed
azithromycin, but his symptoms worsened.  Presented today to
PCPs office, O2 sat was 91 on 2L with nebs, referred to ED at
[**Hospital1 **].  At [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], he was found to be hypoxic to the 80s.
WBC 19. CXR showed RML PNA. There he was given solumedrol, nebs,
2l ns and levofloxacin.  He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED due
to lack of bed availability.

On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, VS were T 98, HR 98, BP 136/91, RR
20, SpO2 94% Non-Rebreather.  On exam ?scleral icterus,
+pharyngitis
ronchi throughout bilaterally w/apical wheezing R>L.  CXR from
[**Location (un) 620**] showed bilateral pneumonia.  He was given tamiflu, and
transferred to the ICU for hypoxia/pneumonia.  On transfer VS
were 128/87  102  98  97/NRB.

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:
Echocardiogram [**2116-2-7**]: The left atrium is normal in size. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. The main pulmonary artery is
dilated. There is no pericardial effusion.

CXR [**2116-2-7**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. No evidence of pneumonia. No pulmonary edema. No pleural
effusions. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.

CXR [**2116-2-9**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. A small retrocardiac atelectasis is slightly improved.
The
pre-existing right basal atelectasis is unchanged. Both areas of
atelectasis are documented on the CT examination from [**2-7**], [**2115**]. In the interval, there is no evidence of newly
occurred parenchymal opacities that could reflect pneumonia. No
pleural effusions. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. No
pulmonary edema.

Radiology Report
ABDOMEN U.S. (COMPLETE STUDY) Study Date of [**2116-2-10**] IMPRESSION:

1. Heterogeneously increased echogenicity of the liver,
consistent with fatty infiltration. However, other forms of
liver disease including advanced liver disease or cirrhosis are
not excluded in this study.
2. No evidence of biliary obstruction. No focal liver lesions.
