SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient is a current smoker with a 20-pack-
year history and admitted to remote IV cocaine use, remote
alcohol abuse, and he is a resident of a facility for
rehabilitation.

He was admitted to the hospital on [**2190-12-16**] for
evaluation of his fever on double IV antibiotics. Admission
labs were a white count of 11.1, hematocrit 29, platelet
count 438,000. Sodium 140, K 4.5, chloride 104, bicarbonate
27, BUN 14, creatinine 1.2 with a blood sugar of 119. Peak
and trough gentamicin studies were done. Additional blood
cultures were done.

Patient had a long preoperative course. Over the course of
the approximately 8 weeks prior to his surgery, he completed
a 56-day course of ampicillin IV and a 56-day course of
gentamicin IV. He had minor complications from this which
included an episode of acute renal failure with his
creatinine trending up to 2.1 and then back down again before
prior to surgery. His blood cultures did show enterococcus
which was treated with double antibiotic therapy. He also
developed vertebral osteomyelitis during his hospital stay,
which was diagnosed by MRI and evaluated by neurosurgery
which recommended only antibiotic therapy and no need to
biopsy or pursue at this time.

He was followed daily by the infectious disease service as
well as by cardiology service and was maintained for CHF with
originally Lasix and ACE inhibitor. Over the course of his
stay, preoperatively he also developed a right lower
extremity peroneal vein DVT for which he was initially
heparinized and then placed on Coumadin at therapeutic doses
for coverage of the DVT. PICC line was also placed during
that 8 weeks stay. Prior to surgery, ultimately the patient
also had a cardiac catheterization on [**2191-1-28**] which
showed clean coronary arteries, severe mitral regurgitation,
severe tricuspid regurgitation, and severe pulmonary
hypertension.

Over the course of this stay, it was also discovered the
patient required dental extractions. He was seen by the OMFS
service. He was then transitioned from Coumadin to Lovenox
and then ultimately as the INR dropped down to IV Heparin in
preparation for 4 teeth extraction which took place on
[**2-11**]. In addition, during that time period, he did
complete his 8 weeks course of antibiotics. After his
extractions, he went back on Coumadin.

On[**2-10**], 4 days prior to surgery, he had a repeat TEE
which showed severe MR, mild-to-moderate TR, and no abscess
present in his heart. The patient was finally cleared for
surgery. A repeat MRI was done in late [**Month (only) 404**] which showed
essentially no change in the vertebral osteomyelitis. But
with the official radiology [**Location (un) 1131**] that clinical findings
often precede MR findings which lag behind. Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]
accepted evaluation and when the patient had approximately 14
days of negative blood cultures, he agreed to do the mitral
valve prolapse. The patient had been off all antibiotics
approximately 10 days at that time.

Laboratory studies the day prior to operation were as
follows: Sodium 137, K 4.6, chloride 104, bicarbonate 26, BUN
24, creatinine 1.3 with a blood sugar of 110, anion gap 12.
White count 7.4, hematocrit 35.0, platelet count 256,000. PT
12.8, PTT 79.4 on Heparin drip with an INR of 1.0.

[**Last Name (STitle) 2708**]was then officially cleared for surgery, and on
[**2191-2-14**], the patient underwent mitral valve
prolapse with a 29-mm porcine mitral valve by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) 411**]. He was transferred to cardiothoracic ICU in stable
condition.

On postoperative day 1, patient had been extubated, had a
respiratory rate of 19, saturating 96% on nasal cannula.
Postoperatively, white count was 10.8, hematocrit 31,
platelet count 156,000. INR 1.0, creatinine 1.3, K 4.8. His
exam was unremarkable. He began Lopressor beta-blockade and
Lasix diuresis again. Patient was transferred out to the
floor that afternoon. He was seen again by cardiology
postoperatively and case management to help him set up his
living situation postoperatively. He had also been followed
repeatedly by social work services preoperatively about 2
months before surgery.

On postoperative day 2, his creatinine remained stable at
1.3. His white count rose slightly to 13.6. He was sleepy,
but appropriate and with a nonfocal neurological exam. He had
some nausea and vomiting early that morning. He continued on
perioperative vancomycin. His Foley was removed. His pacing
wires were removed. He started Heparin for his DVT after his
pacing wires were removed later that day. ID was again
reconsulted for clarification of postop antibiotics.

White count was rechecked the following morning with a plan
to panculture the patient if patient developed any fever.
However, the patient had a temperature of only 98.9 that
morning. Patient was seen and evaluated by physical therapy
and began to work on ambulation with support from PT and the
nurses.

On postoperative day 3, patient had already ambulated to
level 3. Was on Heparin at 800 units an hour. Received his
first dose of Coumadin 5 mg later that evening. His Lasix was
switched over to p.o. He was encouraged to increase his
activity level with a plan to discharge him to his outside
living situation in approximately the next 1-2 days. Central
venous line was removed. Pacing wires had already been
removed. Heart was regular rate and rhythm with a grade 2/6
systolic ejection murmur. Sternum was stable. Incision was
clean, dry, and intact. He had a nonfocal neurologic exam,
and his lungs were clear bilaterally. His weight was below
his preoperative weight by 1.3 kilograms.

Re[**Last Name (STitle) 60120**]reening was completed on postoperative day 4. The day
of discharge, he did a level 4. His blood pressure was
111/76, in sinus rhythm at 87 with a respiratory rate of 20,
saturating 97% on room air. He continued on his Heparin and
received his Coumadin to get him therapeutic. From his dose
the night prior, he continued with his beta-blockade with
metoprolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. His exam was unremarkable. The
patient did have a bowel movement. He was ready for discharge
home and was progressing very well. He had been receiving
Heparin and Coumadin for his DVT prior to surgery. But the
nurse practitioner spoke with a primary care group, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1270**] who felt the patient did not need to be
anticoagulated. Surveillance blood cultures were drawn and
the patient was given instructions to followup with ID in [**12-26**]
weeks, with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in 4 weeks for his postop
surgical visit and with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1270**] in [**1-27**] weeks
postdischarge.

Labs prior to discharge showed a white count of 8.7,
hematocrit 29.1, platelet count 254,000. Creatinine 1.2.
Coumadin was discontinued.
