Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11040**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of right subclavian HD line


History of Present Illness:
68 yo M with ESRD on HD, COPD, AF w/ PCM, CHF, and h/o R
colectomy, who presents from HD with non-functioning HD catheter
and found to be in bigeminy by emergency physician's report. He
did not recieving HD on day of admission. He recieved midodrine
prior to HD.
.
In the ED, VS 102 rectal, HR 104, 96/55, Rr 16, 100% on vent.
Exam in the ED was unremarkable. Given IV vancomycin and 500 cc
IV in the ED. 2 PIV placed. Lowest BP documented was 72/45 in
triage.
.
On arrival, pt had no complaints. Denied CP, pressure, SOB,
cough, abd pain, nausea/vomiting or any other sxs. He was
mentaing on arrival.
.
Admitted to MICU for hypotension. initally BP on arrival was in
the 60's SBP, IVF hung with good result -- pt's bp increased and
stabilized in 80's-90's which is his baseline.  A left sided
subclavian or supraclavicular was attempted without success, so
interventional radiology was contact[**Name (NI) **] for imaging-guided line
placement.

Microbiology: Blood cx's no growth [**5-14**] (still pending at time of
d/c), c. diff negative.
.
.
Imaging:
[**2127-5-2**]: CXR - There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The lungs
remain clear with prominent hila bilaterally which may suggest
underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension. No evidence of
pulmonary edema or pleural effusions. Cardiomediastinal
silhouette is within normal limits. Positions of right-sided
single-lead pacemaker device and tracheostomy tube are
unchanged.
.
[**2127-5-2**]: TIB/FIB/soft tissue xray - Probable lateral soft tissue
loss or ulcer along lateral mid and distal fibula, with
amorphous calcification or foreign material proximally, and
focal periosteal reaction distally.

Brief Hospital Course:
68 yo M with multiple medical problems, here with hypotension
and fever found in the setting of a non-working HD line.
.
#hypotension: The patient was admitted with hypotension, though
per his nursing home his pressure runs low usually.  The
patient's blood pressure responded to IVF, and he continued to
mentate well.  Given his initial temperature, concern was for
infection.  The patient had a normal cxr making pna unlikely, LE
wounds that were chronic (cellulitis unlikely), and a chronic
line (possible line infection).  Given his history of VRE and
concern for line infection or other sources the patient was
broadly covered with vancomycin (dosed by level), levaquin, and
linezolid while his cultures were pending.  His blood cultures
are negative to date, and as he evinced no signs of infection
(fever, tachycardia, change from baseline bp, or wbc) the
antibiotics were stopped, and the patient remained stable.  He
never required pressors during his stay; the initialy fluid
bolus was sufficient to raise his bp from the 60's up to his
baseline 80's-90's.  His midodrine dose was increased to 10mg
tid (from 10mg AM, 5mg [**Hospital1 **] noon and HS) for help supporting his
bp during HD.
.
#Fevers: The patient had a fever on admission, though remained
afebrile for the majority of his course.  He had a normal white
count, though given his intitial temperature and hypotension the
patient was covered broadly with levaquin, linezolid and
vancomycin, while awaiting the RIJ tip to be cultured and have
negative cultures for 24 hours.  All cultures remained negative
for 96 hours, and he remained hemodynamically stable, without
leukocytosis, so antibiotics were stopped.  At the time of
discharge, he had 96 hours of negative blood cultures and a
negative C. difficile antigen.
.
#ESRD on HD: The patient presented with a non functioning line
that did not respond to TPA.  He had a groin line placed by
surgery and this did not work either, so the patient had his
labs followed closely and did not require urgent dialysis while
waiting for his tunnelled line.  A tunnelled right subclavian
line was placed by IR and he was sucesfully dialyzed through it
before discharge.
.
# Abdominal wound after right colectomy: The patient has a
chronic wound and vac in place.  Surgery did not feel this was a
source of infection, and he was followed by the wound care nurse
for weekly vac changes.  This should be continued and he should
see his surgeon in [**Month (only) **] at the appointment described in the
discharge paperwork.
.
# LE ulcers: The patient has bilateral ulcers that appear
chronic and not actively infected.  Vascular recommended wet to
dry dressings with ace wraps and the patient had this wound care
with no developing signs of cellulitis.
.
# AF:  The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation but
remained well rate control and paced.
.
#Respiratory failure: The patient is chronically vented, but had
difficulty weaning at rehab secondary to high gastric residuals.
The patient was weaned to trach mask at 40% fio2 during his
course and tolerated this well with no episodes of desaturation.
 A Passy-Muir valve was fitted which also worked well.
.
# Nutrition: The patient came in on tube feeds, but he was able
to eat on his own.  He remained on oral feeds and did well.  The
GJ tube was tested in IR and found to be working, so was left in
place should his po's prove insufficient.  A calorie count is
recommended to evaluate adequacy of oral intake.
