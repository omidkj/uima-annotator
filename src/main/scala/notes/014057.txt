Chief Complaint:
Confusion & agitation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation
Central venous line & arterial line placement
EEG

History of Present Illness:
  61yo male with HBV cirrhosis complicated by portal HTN,
gastric varicies, and s/p TIPS who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from
outside facility for confusion & agitation.  He was also noted
to be jaundiced with asterixis.  Pt had also sustained a fall
with facial trauma several weeks ago.
  In the ED, he desaturated to 80% on 6L/NC and was found to
have EKG evidence of an acute anterior MI.  He was intubated for
airway protection & seen by cardiology.  He had an emergent ECHO
which demonstrated an EF of 40-50%.  He was felt to be too high
risk for anticoagulation or catheterization, and was treated
medically with beta-blocker, aspirin, and plavix.  He also
received a chest CTA to evaluate a widened mediastinum & LLL
consolidation prior to transfer to MICU.

[**2149-7-30**] ECHO - The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
(ejection fraction 50%). The distal anterior septum and a
portion of the apex appear hypokinetic. The right ventricular
size and function appear normal.
[**2149-8-1**] ECHO - The left atrium is mildly dilated.  Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function
are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. There is no evidence of endocarditis.  Compared
with the findings of the prior report (tape unavailable for
review) of [**2149-7-30**], there has been no significant change.

[**2149-7-30**] CXR - Left lower lobe collapse/consolidation.

[**2149-7-30**] Chest CT - Left lower lobe consolidation and patchy
opacities seen in the remaining left lung consistent with
infectious process.  No aortic dissection.

[**2149-7-30**] Abd CT - Cirrhotic liver with TIPS stent. Splenomegaly.
 New enhancing nodular foci within the right lobe of the liver
at the dome and surrounding the previous site of RF ablation,
most compatible with local multifocal recurrence.

[**2149-7-30**] Head CT - No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.

[**2149-7-31**] TIPS U/S - Reduced overall rate of flow through the
tips compared with
previous exam, at which time flow was approximately 80-85 cm per
second. Flow
across the TIPS is now uniformly approximately 40-45 cm per
second.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 5715**] was admitted via the ED on [**2149-7-30**] following
presentation with mental status changes & subsequent respiratory
failure.  He was intubated & transferred to MICU upon admission.
 In addition to his end-stage liver failure & hepatic
encephalopathy, he was also found to have a LLL pneumonia & a
new ST-elvation MI.  He was not a candidate for cardiac cath or
anticoagulation, so his MI was treated medically with
beta-blocker/asa & initially plavix, which was later stopped.
He remained intubated & mechanically ventilated while his
pneumonia was treated with antibiotics (cipro/vanco).  Pt
discovered to also have enterococcus/staph UTI sensitive to
current antibiotics.  Neurology consulted on [**8-4**] for question
of seizure like activity with rhythmic eye & arm movements -
clinically diagnosed with status epilepticus, bedside EEG with
delta slowing, low amplitude waves.  Based on his poor progress
and poor prognosis, following a discussion [**2149-8-5**] with the
patient's mother & partner, the focus of care was shifted to
comfort measures only (based on previously expressed wishes),
the patient was eventually extubated, and expired at 17:40 PM on
[**2149-8-5**] by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5716**].
