Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2932**]
Chief Complaint:
right side chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
63 year old male w/ h/o HTN, prostate cancer, and h/o PE (30 yrs
ago in setting of leg fracture) presents with right sided
pleuritic upper abdominal pain. He awoke yesterday with mild
flank/RUQ pain with difficulty breathing due to pain. He denied
nausea, vomiting, dysuria, frequency, urgency. Pain was worse
with deep breathing, but not exacerbated by exertion and no
associated nausea or diaphoresis. It persisted throughout the
day and he had difficulty sleeping. This morning he had
difficulty breathing and severe pain at 5 am and went to the
emergency room. Of note he denied any leg swelling, recent plane
flights or long car rides. He did have a recent left arm muscle
biopsy as part of a work-up for myopathy. In ED, he was given
2mg of Morphine and developed immediate hives on left arm. He
was given Benadryl 50mg IV, then developed bradycardia (30's)
and hypotension (SBP 50's) w/ diaphoresis. He was then given
solumedrol 125mg IV x1, pepcid 20mg IV with resolution of
hypotension. A CT angiogram of the chest revealed a right
mainstem PE and heparin was started with bolus. He was admitted
to MICU given large clot burden and low O2 sat (91% on RA)

[**2-24**] EKG: Ectopic atrial rhythm versus sinus rhythm at 80 beats
per minute. Baseline artifact. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2116-2-5**] findings are similar.

Radiology
[**2-24**] CTA chest: Multiple areas of filling defects are seen
within the right main pulmonary artery and its right upper lobe
and right lower lobe branches. This appearance is consistent
with pulmonary embolism. Multiple hypodense lesions within both
lobes of the liver most likely represent simple cysts. A small
polypoid lesion is seen within the trachea that most likely is
mucus collection, however other pathologies / polyp cannot be
ruled out. Tracheal CT can be done to further evaluate this
finding.

[**2-24**] CXR: Comparison is made with the prior chest x-ray of
[**12-12**]. Both diaphragms are somewhat more elevated
consistent with poor lung expansion. Some atelectasis of the
left base is seen. Some blunting of the left costophrenic angle
is also present. No other evidence of failure is seen. The right
costophrenic angle appears sharp.

[**2-25**] LENI: No evidence of left or right lower extremity deep
vein thrombosis.

[**2-25**] CXR: Aside from mild persistent atelectasis at the right
base, lungs are clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
Any right pleural effusion is small and unchanged since
yesterday. No pneumothorax.

[**2-25**] transthoracic echocardiogram: The left atrium is mildly
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

[**2-26**] tracheal CT: The airways are patent to the level of
segmental bronchi with no evidence of malacia. The previously
suspected endotracheal lesion has not been demonstrated on the
current exam suggesting mucous secretion as a cause. The
expiration series demonstrates mild anterior displacement of the
posterior wall of the trachea but not to the level of
symptomatic malacia. There are no other endobronchial lesions
demonstrated. The upper lungs are clear. Bilateral basal areas
of atelectasis and possible right lower lobe subpleural area of
infarction are noted, improved compared to the previous scan.
The known right upper and right lower lobe filling defects in
pulmonary arteries are grossly unchanged with some decrease in
the bulk of the emboli in right upper lobe pulmonary artery.
There is no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. The heart size
is normal but there is a new small pericardial effusion.The
imaged portion of the upper abdomen again demonstrates multiple
hypodense liver lesions, most likely cysts. The rest of the
abdomen is unremarkable except for bilateral small renal cysts.

Laboratory studies on discharge:
[**2-26**] INR 1.2

Brief Hospital Course:
63 year old male with history of prostate cancer and pulmonary
embolism 30 yrs ago in setting of leg fracture presents with
right mainstem, RUL, and RLL pulmonary emboli.

1) Pulmonary emboli: The patient was initially treated with a
heparin drip; he was subseqently transitioned to coumadin with a
lovenox bridge (goal INR [**2-29**]). He was initially monitored in the
ICU and then transferred to the general medical floor on [**2-25**].
He will continue on 5 mg of warfarin until he has a repeat INR
checked on [**2116-2-28**] at his PCPs office. Based on that INR,
subsequent dosing will be determined by his PCP. [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] [**2-25**] was
without evidence of PFO or right heart strain. Bilateral lower
extremity ultrasounds were without evidence of DVT. At time of
discharge, the patient was stable, 96% RA at rest, 93% RA with
ambulation. The precipitant of this DVT is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] did have
left deltoid muscle biopsy 2 weeks ago, however, this was done
under local anesthesia. He has a history of pulmonary embolism
in the setting of a leg fracture 30 years ago for which he was
treated with coumadin (he does not know the duration of
treatment)  He denies family history of clot. As part of his
work-up for causes of hypercoagulability, a lupus anticoagulant
was checked (negative); further hypercoagulable work-up
(homocysteine, protein C/S) was deferred in the setting of an
acute clot. Factor V Leiden and prothrombin gene mutation
analysis may be considered as an outpatient. In terms of his
risk for malignancy, given a history of prostate cancer, a PSA
was obtained which was <0.1. A chest CT was without evidence of
nodules, and a tracheal CT was without polyp (initial possible
polyp visualized on chest CT was likely sputum). His most recent
colonoscopy was in [**7-/2112**], which showed only grade 2 internal
hemorrhoids and diverticulosis. Fecal occult blood
testing/repeat colonoscopy may be considered at the discretion
of the patient's PCP.

2) HTN: The patient was restarted on moexipril and
hydrochlorothiazide
