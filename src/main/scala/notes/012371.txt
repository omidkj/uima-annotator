Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 896**]
Chief Complaint:
Generalized weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
41 morbidly obese male (BMI~70), HTN, Asthma, mild MR,
schizoaffective d/o with hx of suicide attempts, and chornic
lower extremity edema/cellulitis presenting with generalized
weakness. Pt was unable to get out of bed for past 2 days, was
too weak to stand. Had too episodes of watery diarrhea in the
past 24 hrs. Temp of 101.4.  VNA cleaned the pt, didn't see
stool. thinks R leg more swollen than usual. Denies CP, SOB,
lightheadness, good PO intake.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T97.0 HR72 BP111/54 RR24 96%.  Labs
were signficnat for a white count of 16.8 with 88% PMNs.
Lactate of 1.6.  Microcytic anemia of 33.4, platelets of 149.
INR of 1.3.  UA was significant for 22 WBC's, protein, few
rbc's.  Cardiac torponins were flat x 1. Developed new atrial
fibrillation with RVR.  Patient had a chest xray performed that
was poor to analyze secondary to the patient's body habitus, but
negative for an intrathoracic process.  Given concern for an
infective porcess, patient received 1 gram Vancomycin as well as
4.5 grams of Zosyn.  Received 1000 mg APAP for temperatures of
100.4 and 1 L fluid bolus.
.
While in the ED, patient was tachypnic to the mid 30's and
developed new onset atrial fibrillation with RVR that resolved.
Spoke with ED about concern for DVT or pulmonary embolism as no
imaging studies were performed.  Given patient's body habitus,
would be unable to have a CTA of the chest and V/Q would be
ideterminate.  D-Dimer was added on prior to transfer to the
floors and was found to be elevated.

move all extremities, LEs with more difficulty. Ankle strengths
[**5-30**] bilaterally, other LE joints difficult to test due to body
habitus. BUEs [**5-30**] grossly.

IMAGING:
EKG [**2120-8-30**]: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Non-specific and diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities. Compared to
the previous tracing of [**2120-6-13**] atrial fibrillation is new. Rate
119, QRS 102, QT/QTc 340/443
.
CXR [**2120-8-30**]: No acute cardiopulmonary process. Known right upper
lobe lung
nodule is not well appreciated on this current examination.
Please refer to prior CT from [**2118-8-9**].
.
R LENI [**2120-8-31**]: Markedly limited study due to patient body
habitus. No evidence of DVT within the right common femoral or
proximal superficial femoral veins. More distal DVT not
excluded.
.
L LENI [**2120-9-1**]: Markedly limited study by patient habitus, though
with no
definite evidence of left lower extremity deep venous
thrombosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. SIRS/sepsis (cellulitis): Presented with fever, leukocytosis,
and right leg pain, erythema, warmth (on top of chronic
lyphedema). After starting IV vancomycin he defervesced with
improved in his WBC and right leg pain. He was discharged on
cephalexin and Bactrim for 10 additional days to finish 14 day
course of antibiotics. DVT was considered an alternate etiology
but was deemed less likely after LENI.

2. Tachypnea: Respiratory rates were noted into the 30s with
shallow breaths. Initial concern was for VTE given the patient's
sedentary lifestyle and obesity. D-dimer elevated to over 1200;
CTA could not be obtained due to the patient's body habitus, and
though VQ scan is a possibility, the radiologists did not think
it would be useful if the pretest probability was not high,
given the patient's body habitus. He was empirically started on
a heparin drip for presumed pulmonary embolism for 2 days. Lower
extremity ultrasound showed no obvious proximal DVTs on right or
left. It was felt that this represented the patient's baseline
tachypnea, likely due to the restrictive physiology of his body
wall. At the time of discharge, patient feels at baseline.

3. New atrial fibrillation with m
