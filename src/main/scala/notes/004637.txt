Surgical Pathology [**2170-7-25**]
Small intestine, segmental resection:
1.  Small intestinal segments with diffuse ischemic changes.
2.  Disease extends to all resection margins.


Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**2170-7-25**] with small bowel obstruction and question of
perforation/sepsis, transferred from [**Hospital3 **].
Immediately went to the OR for an exploratory lapartomy and ~12
inch ischemic bowel resection. There was a question of
aspiration of gastric contents in the OR, so he remained
intubated and was SICU on pressors.
His blood pressure was supported on pressors in the SICU and he
remained on the ventilator until [**7-27**], when he was extubated for
the first time.

Also on [**7-27**], he had an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation
with HR in the 140s. Diltiazem drip was started for rate control
per Cardiology consult recommendations. Metroprolol and
amiodarone drips were also started. He then converted to normal
sinus rhythm.

On [**7-29**], he was found to be in respiratory distress with sats in
the 80's and was promptly reintubated. He started on heparin and
plavix for demand ischemia vs STEMI after troponins peaked at
0.81. He continued to be on the ventilator.

On [**7-31**], the amiodarone drip was stopped. He was febrile to
101.8 and was started on ciprofloxacin and flagyl. He underwent
bronchoscopy which showed Gram + cocci. Vancomycin was added to
his regimen after he continued to spike fevers. Flagyl was
discontinued.

On [**8-2**], palliative care was consulted. There was a discussion
of DNR status with the patient but nothing was finalized.
On [**8-3**], bronchoscopy cultures grew pan-sensitive Pseudomonas.
On [**8-4**], PICC line was inserted. On [**8-5**], he was extubated for
the second time.
On [**8-6**], ciprofloxacin was discontinued and Zosyn was started.
On [**8-7**], a code was called for bradycardia to the 30's and
decreased O2 sats. He was reintubated at this time although
family had concerns afterwards about his code status.
On [**8-8**], family discussed status and were leaning towards no
further intubations but he was not made DNR.
On [**8-10**], he was extubated for the third time. He passed flatus.
On [**8-12**], he passed bright red blood per rectum. Heparin was
stopped. Tagged RBC scan was performed which showed GI bleeding
of unidentified source. He received 14 units of PRBCs in total
over the next 3 days. Code status was full code per patient's
wishes. GI was consulted and suspected diverticulosis vs
ischemia as sources of the bleeding.
On [**8-13**], angiography was performed which did not reveal the
source of the bleeding. Vancomycin was discontinued.
On [**8-14**], he continued to have gross blood per rectum. He
underwent a colonoscopy which showed old blood in the colon, no
active bleeding, and diverticulosis throughout.
On [**8-15**], he was reintubated for the fourth time for respiratory
distress with PCOs in the 80's. GI bleeding resolved.
On [**8-17**], his incisional staples were removed.
On [**8-18**], he was extubated again.
On [**8-20**], Zosyn was discontinued. PT was consulted and recommeded
admission to a rehabilitation facility.
On [**8-23**], he met discharge criteria and an appropriate facility
had accepted him for transfer.

Code status at time of discharge was full code.
