Pertinent Results:
[**2141-5-29**] Echo: PRE CPB The left atrium is markedly dilated. The
left atrium is elongated. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen
in the body of the left atrium. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There
is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
moderate to severe hypokinesis of the inferior, inferolateral,
and lateral walls from the lower base to apex in the setting of
mild to moderate global hypokjinesis. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed. The right ventricular
cavity is dilated. There is moderate global right ventricular
free wall hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma in the aortic
arch. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is prolapse of the A2 and
A1 segments of the anterior mitral valve leaflet with some
slight posterior leafley retraction. This results in an
eccentric jet of severe (4+) mitral regurgitation which is
posteriorly directed. POST CPB Patient is receiving milrinone
and norepinephrine by infusion. Right ventricular systolic
function is improved, now normal free wall function. Views of
the left ventricle are limited but left ventricular global
function appears to be improved. The inferior and inferolateral
walls are still severely hypokinetic. The overall ejection
fraction is in the 40-45% range.  There is a bileaflet
mechanical prosthesis in the mitral position. It appears to be
well seated. The leaflets are seen in limited views and appear
to function normally. The maximum gradient across the valve
measures at about 9 mm Hg with a mean of about 7 mm Hg with
cardiac output about 7 l/m. The normal mild valvular mitral
regurgitation is seen. No large perivalvular jets are seen. The
thoracic aorta appears intact.
[**2141-6-5**] CXR: Improvement in the airspace
disease/atelectasis/effusion on the left side compared with the
prior day's radiograph.
[**2141-6-5**] Knee X-ray: No evidence of acute bony injury or
chondrocalcinosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was a same day admit and underwent all pre-operative
work-up as an outpatient. On day of admission he was brought to
the operating room where he underwent a mitral valve
replacement. Please see dictated surgical note for details.
Following surgery he was transferred to the CSRU for invasive
monitoring in stable condition. Mr. [**Known lastname **] remained sedated and
intubated for several days after surgery secondary to potential
SVC syndrome. As well as patient was fluid overloaded and had a
post-op rise in his creatinine. Nephrology was consulted on
post-op day two. Beta blockers were started but diuretics were
held. He was eventually weaned from sedation and extubated on
post-op day two. Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were
removed per protocol. On post-op day four Coumadin was started
with Heparin used a bridge until INR therapeutic. Coumadin was
dosed for a goal INR around 3.0. Later on this day he was
transferred to the telemetry floor for further care. On post-op
day six he required blood transfusion secondary to low HCT. On
post-op day seven ID was consulted for increased WBC/?pneumonia
and rheumatology was consulted secondary to h/o gout and now
experiencing right knee pain. Knee pain improved with Indocin.
Cultures were taken and patient was empirically started on
antibiotics. Given concern for pneumonia, he was asked to
complete a 10 day course of antibiotics. It was also suggested
by rheumatology, that he started Allopurinol in several weeks
and avoid further NSAIDs for now. He otherwise remained afebrile
without evidence of infection. He continued to make clinical
improvements and was discharged on postoperative day nine. Prior
to discharge, arrangements have been mad with his PCP(Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1683**]
for outpatient Coumadin followup.
