History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 31823**] is a 74-year-old
gentleman with a complex medical history that is relevant for
known coronary artery disease. His last coronary angiogram in
[**2145-12-24**] showed a total occlusion of the right coronary
artery, a 50% stenosis of the left circumflex artery with
significant left anterior descending disease. A past attempt in
[**2126**] was made to intervene on the left anterior decending artery
however the intervention was unsuccessful. Of note, he has a
heavily calcified aorta and his last cardiac catheterization was
complicated by embolic disease to his kidneys and lower
extremities. Recently he has been having worsening episodes of
angina which occur daily and require daily nitroglycerin. He is
also dyspneic with minimal activity. His chest pain is always
relieved with 1-2 nitroglycerin however it can occur at rest. He
has not had a recent cardiac cathterization given the risk
associated with the procedure in regards to his aortic
atherosclerotic disease. He presents today to discuss high risk
surgical options versus percutaneous intervention given his
decompensated state and poor quality of life.
