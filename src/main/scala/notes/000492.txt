History of Present Illness:
EVENTS / HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:  Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 81 yo man
with h/o transitional cell CA of the bladder s/p nephrectomy in
[**2198**], type I diabetes, hypertension, CRI (baseline Cr 3.5),
hypertension, hyperlipidemia who began having URI symptoms with
cough productive of thick sputum last friday.  He underwent
radiation to a skin cancer on his cheek and has thereafter had
very dry mouth and thick sputum he has been unable to cough up.
He denies any fevers, chills, night sweats, weight-loss, or sick
contacts but does report paroxysms of shortness of breath and
one episode of dark red hemoptysis this morning.  Sunday evening
he found himself breathing very uncomfortably with significant
orthopnea.  He denies nausea, diaphoresis, or chest pain.  He
presented to [**Hospital **] hospital at 3am on Monday where his initial
vitals were T 98.7, HR 88, RR 18, SaO2 85% RA and 95% on 2L N/C,
BP 151/72 with HR 85. CXR showed Rt-sided infiltrate so he was
started on CTX and azithromycin to treat community-acquired
pneumonia.  EKG initially showed NSR with rate 85 and no
ischaemic changes.  His hypoxia quickly worsened to requiring
100% NRB and was noted on CXR to possible pulmonary edema with
BNP of 1259.  He was treated with lasix without good result.  He
subsuquently ruled in for MI with CK peak of 211 and CK-MB of
8.5.  He later went into rapid atrial fibrillation with heart
rates in the 130's-140's and was subsequently placed on a
diltialzem and heparin drip.  He was also noted to have acute
renal failure with Cr of 3.5 up from his baseline of 2.8.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, joint pains, black stools or red stools. He
denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional
buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were
negative.
.
*** Cardiac review of systems is notable for mild chest pressure
earlier this morning chest pain.  At baseline he has no dyspnea
on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle
edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.

irregular rhythm, tachycardic, normal S1, S2. No S4, no S3.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
moderate respiratory distress, coughing.  loud ronchi heard
throughout with [**Hospital1 **]-basilar crackles and scattered crackles
throughout rt lung.

bruits.

Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Pulses:
Right: Carotid 2+ without bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit; DP
pulses not palpable but feet warm

pulses non-palpable, but feet warm


Pertinent Results:
OSH admission EKG: NSR with rate 86, normal axis, borderline
LAE, possible Q in V1-2.  No ST of T wave changes.
.
EKG on transfer demonstrated coarse atrial fibrillation with
ventricular rate of 120, normal axis, no hypertrophy, normal
intervals.  Non-spesific diffuse ST depression and TWI.
possible q wave in V1 and aVR.
.
.
[**2203-9-6**].  Echo.
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular  filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area
1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2198-10-1**], there has been interval development of
mild aortic stenosis and left ventricular hypertrophy (aortic
valve velocity not evaluated on prior study). Elevated left
ventricular filling pressures are now present. Estimated
pulmonary artery pressures could not be assessed on the current
study. The rhythm is now atrial fibrillation with a rapid
ventricular response.
.
ETT performed at [**Hospital **] hospital (records not available) on
[**2-/2199**] demonstrated:  He exercised for 3 min and 39 sec on a
[**Doctor First Name **] protocol achieved a maximal heart rate of 94% with no
angina or ischemic EKG changes there may have been a subtle
inferior wall defect thought to be artifact. EF 65%.
.
CXR.  [**2203-9-6**].  IMPRESSION: New right upper lobe and right lower
lung pneumonia possibly aspiration pneumonia with likely
involvement of the left lower lung also.
.
EGD [**2203-9-23**].IMPRESION:The previously noted mucosal abnormality
on the incisura was not noted on this exam. Otherwise normal EGD
to duodenal bulb
.
CXR [**2203-10-3**]
Comparison is made to the prior examinations dated [**2203-9-26**] and
[**2203-9-27**]. The right-sided double lumen central venous catheter
is stable in position. The cardiac silhouette is within normal
limits. There is improvement of the vascular engorgement and
asymmetric pulmonary edema noted on the prior examinations. The
left retrocardiac opacity persists, likely reflects a
small-to-moderate effusion and atelectasis, difficult to exclude
pneumonia

Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly, this is a 81yM with medical history including
transitional cell CA s/p nephrectomy, HTN, Type I Diabetes
Mellitus, CRI (baseline Cr approximately 2.8), who was initially
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for NSTEMI in the setting of afib with RVR.
He had presented to an OSH with URI-like symptoms one month ago
and been treated for CAP with a course of Azithromycin.  He
subsequently decompensated into afib with RVR and when he
presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] Tn was elevated over 2 and he had
prominent airspace opacities on CXR.  The patient was admitted
to the CCU for hypoxia assumed to be secondary to pulmonary
edema and MRSA pneumonia requiring intubation. The patient was
transferred to MICU care given hemodynamics consistent with
sepsis, and eventually initiated on HD for worsening volume
status and renal
