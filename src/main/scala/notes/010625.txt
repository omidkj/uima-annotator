Studies:
EKG [**2103-9-13**]: SR at 75 bpm, RBBB, VPB, prolonged PR , old Q-waves
in 2,3,aVF; these were unchanged compared to previous EKG
.
Echo [**2103-9-11**]
Aortic sclerosis with adequate opening, septal knuckle, mild MR,
trace TR, RV wnl, LVH, Reverse E/A ratio c/w non compliant LV,
mitral annular calcification, EF of 30% with inferolateral
hypkinesis c/w infarction. Per Daughter [**4-11**] [**Month/Day (1) 1686**] ago had echo
with EF 40-45%.
.
[**2103-9-15**]
EF 35%. 3+/4+ MR.
.
Carotid Duplex ([**2103-9-12**]): b/l 60-69% stenosis
.
EEG ([**2103-9-14**]): This is an abnormal EEG in the waking and drowsy
states due to the slow background rhythm and bursts of
generalized delta slowing. These abnormalities suggest a
moderate encephalopathy, which may be seen with infections,
medication effect, toxic metabolic abnormalities, or ischemia.
.
MRI/MRA head ([**2103-9-14**]):
No acute stroke. No hemorrhage.Moderate ventriculomegaly.
Diffuse  thickening of the meninges most likely secondary to
right parietal  shunt. Old left cerebellarinfarct. Normal circle
of [**Location (un) 431**] with no  areas of abnormality.
.
CT Head w/out contrast ([**2103-9-14**]):
Allowing for differences in technique from MR,no significant
change. Please note that this examination is very limited by
motion artifact.
.
CXR Pa/lat ([**2103-9-18**]):
Interval development of bilateral basal hazy opacities which may
represent multifocal pneumonia
.
CT Head w/o contrast ([**2103-9-20**]):
1) Severely motion limited study.
2) Allowing for this, no evidence of hemorrhage.
3) Ventricles are just slightly more prominent than the CT of
[**2103-9-14**]; without a baseline study for reference, it is difficult
to assess for shunt malfunction.
.
Neck soft tissues ([**2103-9-21**]):
Suboptimal exam. Normal airway.
.
CT Head w/o contrast ([**2103-9-23**]):
1.  No significant change in size of enlarged ventricles with
shunt present in the right lateral ventricle.
2.  No evidence of hemorrhage.
.
CXR [**9-24**] r/o CHF (final):
1. Small bilateral pleural effusions persist.
2. Slight interval improvement in pulmonary vascular congestion.

.
CTA Chest ([**2103-9-24**]) (final):
1.  No evidence of PE.
2.  Bilateral pleural effusions and atelectases.
3.  Small scattered subcentimeter lymph nodes.
4.  Scattered peripheral nonspecific opacities in the right
upper lobe.
.
[**2103-9-26**] CATH [**Last Name (LF) 60559**],[**First Name3 (LF) **]/C
Successful placement of a 4 French single lumen 42 cm PICC by
way
of the right brachial vein with the tip at the cavoatrial
junction.  The line is ready for use.
.
[**9-27**] EEG
Abnormal EEG due to the disorganized and mildly slow background
and due to the bursts of generalized slowing. These slowings
indicate a widespread encephalopathic condition affecting both
cortical and subcortical structures. Medications, metabolic
disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
There was occasional additional focal slowing in the right
anterior quadrant. No epileptiform features were evident.
.
[**9-28**] CXR
Mild pulmonary edema has improved substantially since [**9-27**] and small bilateral pleural effusions have decreased.  The
heart is normal size.  Left lower lobe atelectasis is stable.
No pneumothorax.  Tip of the right PICC line projects over the
right atrium.
.
[**9-28**] CXR
Left base airspace disease and probable small pleural effusion,
without appreciable interval change allowing for differences in
positioning
.
[**9-28**] CT Left Lower Ext
1.  Hematoma with layering fluid-fluid level expanding the
vastus intermedius, lateralis, and rectus femoris.
2.  No evidence for hardware complication.
3.  Dense atherosclerotic disease of the visualized arteries.
.
[**9-30**] CXR
Bibasilar atelectasis with mild hydrostatic edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt had several issues addressed during this admission:
.
1. Hip Fracture: The patient fractured his L hip in a mechanical
fall. The L hip was repaired with an ORIF on [**2103-9-13**]. DVT
prophylaxis with Lovenox 30 [**Hospital1 **]. Physical therapy worked with
him to improve weight bearing on his L leg.
.
2. Neuro: The patient had a GTC seizure soon after hip surgery.
The patient was evaluated by both neurology and neurosurgery.
Neurology was concerned that his presentation of L sided
weakness on the floor could represent either a new stroke or a
[**Doctor Last Name 555**] paralysis after seizure activity.  MRI/MRA of the brain
was negative for an acute lesion although it did reveal an old L
sided infarct.  Mild ventriculomegaly was noted but, in
consultation with neurosurgery, this was felt to not represent
malfunctioning of his VP shunt and the decision was made to
defer tapping the shunt.  An EEG showed no specific seizure
focus but rather demonstrated a diffuse encephalopathy c/w a
toxic-metabolic derangement.  He was loaded with phenytoin and
tolerated the load well.  His mental status improved in the ICU
until he was near hi
