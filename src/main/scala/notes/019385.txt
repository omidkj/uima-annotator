Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 73 year old female with a PMH significant for
COPD, CAD, Type 2 DM, afib s/p pacer admitted with hypoglycemia
and altered mental status likely secondary to aspiration
pneumonia.

1. Healthcare associated pneumonia:  This was the most likely
cause of the patient's altered mental status and respiratory
failure.  Patient had a leukocytosis, and CXR findings revealed
a vague right upper lung opacity.  Patient was intially
intubated for respiratory failure and treated in the ICU.
Patient is s/p bronchoscopy with BAL and blood cultures NGTD.
Sputum culture from [**11-14**] with sparse coag neg Staph.  Patient is
a NH resident, and was treated empirically for healthcare
associated pneumonia with vancomycin and ceftazidime.  Her Vanco
trough was checked [**2109-11-20**] and was elevated to 24 so Vanco was
held.  Another vanco trough should be checked at the NH the
morning of [**2109-11-22**] and Vanco should be restarted at 750mg iv
q12h if trough is <20.  Patient will need three more days of
antibiotics to finish her course.

2. RUE Swelling: Patient developed RUE swelling and discomfort.
A right upper extremity duplex was obtained and no DVT was
found.  The swelling may have been due to trauma.  The swelling
was subsiding at discharge.  The patient had some discomfort
which was helped by Tylenol #3 (which she was already on at her
nursing home for chronic joint pain.

3. COPD:  The patient was not felt to be having a COPD
exacerbation at admission.  She was continued on her home
regimen of Advair, low dose prednisone, diamox and
albuterol/atrovent prn.

4. Atrial fibrillation:  Patient was monitored on telemetry.
She became tachycardic to 110-130s during admission and her
metoprolol was titrated upward for better rate control.  She
will be discharged on Lopressor 200mg po bid.  The patient was
not anticoagulation at admission and this is reportedly due to
fall risk.

5. CAD:  At admission ECG showed ST depression in II, III, avL,
v3-v4.  Cards was consulted and recommended following CE.
Cardiac biomarkers x4 drawn with rise in troponin to 0.04 with
flat CK likely representing demand ischemia or LV strain.  The
patient was continued on her home regimen of metoprolol, ASA,
Plavix, and Lipitor.

6. Type 2 Diabetes mellitus:  Patient hypoglycemic on
presentation on home basal NPH, which was initially held.  NPH
was reintroduced slowly and was titrated based on ISS
requirement during admission.  She will be discharge on NPH
25units [**Hospital1 **] (Her admission regimen was 40u qam and 25u qpm)
This should continue to be adjusted as necessary at the NH.  The
patient was also covered with a RISS.

7. Anxiety:  The patient was restarted on her home regimen of
Paxil adn prn Klonopin prior to discharge.

8. Chronic joint pain:  The patient complained of joint pain all
over which was controlled once we restarted the Tylenol #3 which
she was on at her NH.  It is unclear if she carries a diagnosis
of osteoarthritis or not.

9. Hypernatremia: The patient had a serum Na of 150 at admission
whioh was treated with free water and self correction with po
intake.  Her Na should be monitored periodically at the NH.

10. Constipation:  Patient was continued on Senns, Colace with
prn Miralax.

11.  F/E/N:  The patient had a speecha dn swallow eval whcih
revealed mild dysphagia.  Her recommended diet is ground solids
and thin liquids with pills whole with thin liquid.  She may
need assistance with meals. If her upper dentures are found, and
if they fit well when placed, it would be safe to upgrade her
diet to soft or regular consistency solids

12. Prophylaxis: Patient treated with heparin SQ for DVT
prophylaxis during admission.
