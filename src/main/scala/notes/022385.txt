Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 108981**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with past medical history
significant for HTN, HPL, atrial fibrillation on chronic
anticoagulation, breast cancer (s/p mastectomy, on chemotherapy
with known metastases to sternum), pulmonary hypertension with
baseline 2.5L requirement, presenting from home after developing
episode of severe RLQ abdominal discomfort that prompted EMS
attention.
.
Patient is accompanied by her daughter, who helps provide most
of the medical history.  The patient is not well oriented at
baseline per patient's daughter.  On day of admission, the
patient had sudden onset of RLQ abdominal discomfort that was
thought to be anginal equivalent.  She has h/o angina has been
treated with nitrates and recently restarted BB on [**1-9**] by her
PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient was noted by EMS to be bradycardic to 30s and
was given 0.5mg atropine.  On presentation to [**Hospital1 18**], she was
noted to be bradycardic to 40s and was also hypotensive to
90/40s.  The patient was given another 1mg Atropine and was
started on peripheral dopamine.  She was also noted to have a
low oxygen saturation [**Location (un) 1131**] with a normal pleth.  She was
started on Bipap, but then vomited.  Unclear whether she
aspirated.  ABG was obtained and revealed PO2 of 116 on BiPAP.
.
Initial labs in the ED revealed K of 7.0, Cr 2.8, and Lactate
6.8.  The patient had blood cultures drawn, CXR that was
unremarkable.  She was noted to be more coherent and reliably
answering questions about her abdominal pain in the ED.  Her EKG
demonstrated regularized wide complex bradycardia @ 43 BPMs,
prolonged QTc to 553, with anterolateral deep T wave inversions.
 The patient was given Insulin and D50 for her hyperkalemia.
.
.
After an extensive discussion with the patient's daughter, the
patient's DNR/DNI status was maintained and declined any
interventional procedures (including CVL, temp wire placement,
etc), but agreed to medical management.
.
On transfer, patient was on Dopamine @ 10 mcg/kg/min with
Ventricular rates in 70s, MAP > 60.  Patient had dry mouth and
was a bit more disoriented and agitated.
.
Unable to obtain thorough cardiac review of systems as patient
is disoriented.  Per daughter, patient walks with walker, has
h/o angina, increasing ankle edema.  Unable to assess whether
patient has had palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old woman with multiple medical problems including long
standing metastatic breast cancer, severe pulmonary
hypertension, emphysema, atrial fibrillation, presenting with
worsened hypoxia and abdominal pain (anginal equivalent), found
to have bradycardia and hypotension.  She was also found to be
septic with a UTI.  Discussion of goals of care with patient's
daughter (HCP) confirmed desire for non-invasive management.
The patient became hypotensive, bradycardic and expired during
the morning of [**2159-1-24**]

# Sinus Node arrest with accelerated ventricular escape:
Patient presented bradycardic and had minimal response to
initial dose of atropine, requiring second dose.  Has a history
of AFib with slow ventricular response.  The patient's HCP
wished for team to be minimally invasive and to medically manage
patient.  She was started on peripheral dopamine to support her
heart rate and blood pressure.

#. Sepsis, related to urinary tract infection:  Patient
presented hypotensive, bradycardic, and hypothermic.  UA
floridly positive, grossly cloudy.  Lactate 6.8-->4.6  The
patient was started on zosyn and vancomycin.

# HYPOXIA: Multifactorial in setting of pulm hypertension.
Patient needed a NRB with PO2 80s.  B/l 2.5L oxygen requirement.
 Patient has no signs on exam to suggest L sided heart failure.
Given history of malignancy, PE should be in DDx.  Patient also
vomited on BiPap in ED which raised the concern for possible
aspiration.

# Chonic diastolic heart failure:  Significant R sided heart
failure.  4+ TR, severe PA HTN.  EF 70% on echo [**11-22**].

# Hyperkalemia, secondary to ARF:  K 7.0 on admission, 6.4 after
10u Regular insulin + D50.

# Acute on Chonic Renal Failure:  Cr 2.8, b/l 1.0-1.2.
