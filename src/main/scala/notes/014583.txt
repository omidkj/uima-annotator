Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
presyncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
pericardiocentesis

History of Present Illness:
78 year old woman with COPD, prior CVA, DM, HTN, recent symptoms
of presycnope, nausea, increasing SOB. Admitted one day PTA to
[**Location (un) 620**] after having fallen out of bed and having one episode of
N/V. She was ruled out for any cardiac event and has been
getting treated with nebs and levofloxacin for possible COPD
exacerbation given that she had productive sputum at that time.
In [**2179-5-2**], she had a CT scan to evaluate for persistent
atelectasis and to look for pulmonary nodules. Found to have
bilateral pleural effusions and large pericardial effusion.
Repeat CTA on [**2179-6-14**] as part of her workup showed increased
size of both effusions. A TTE at [**Location (un) 620**] demonstrated a
moderate-large pericardial effusion with early signs of
tamponade, pulmonary hypertension and a normal LVEF. She was
transferred for further work up.
.
After arrival to the [**Hospital1 **], patient was evaluated on the floor. VS
were stable except for a pulsus of 12. Exam revealed JVP to the
angle of the jaw. Cardiac enzymes were negative. Initial workup
for pericardial and pleural effusion was performed (TSH, ESR,
anti-dsDNA, complement were sent). Given RA collapse on TTE from
[**Location (un) 620**] and positive pulsus, patient was sent for
pericardiocentesis. She went to cath lab overnight. Cath report
from [**6-16**] indicated that a pulsatile arterial-appearing blood
was expressed at first needle pass. Needle was withdrawn and
local pressure applied. 350cc greenish fluid was aspirated.
Patient was HD stable throughout procedure, then transferred to
the CCU for monitoring.
.
At arrival in the CCU, the patient only c/o mild-moderate chest
soreness over the puncture site without any radiation. She
denies any SOB, palpitations, fevers, nightsweats but noted some
weight loss over the last few months (unclear amount).
.
ROS at that time was negative for abdominal pain, bloody stools,
urinary symptoms, but positive for a dry cough.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS (at time of admission):
Denies any prior history of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary
embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint
pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. Denies
recent fevers, chills or rigors. Denies exertional buttock or
calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
EKG demonstrated sinus. 89 bpm. nl axis nl intervals. Deep TWI
in V1-V5 which are new compared to [**2178**]. No ST changes.
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2179-6-15**] demonstrated:
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function
are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests
impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a moderate to large sized pericardial effusion. No
right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen. There is
intermittent, sustained right atrial invagination (varies with
repsiration), consistent with early tamponade.
.
.
CTA chest [**2179-6-14**]- Central pulmonary arteries remain patent. No
filling defect is identified. There is a large pericardial
effusion. Considerable atherosclerotic calcification is present
including coronary artery calcification. Mediastinal structures
are otherwise unremarkable. There are moderate pleural effusions
bilaterally. There is underlying compressive atelectasis as well
as plate-like atelectasis in the middle lobe and lingula.
Degenerative arthritic changes are present in the spine. No
osteolytic or osteoblastic lesion is identified.Compared with
the previous study of [**2179-5-10**], pleural effusions and the
pericardial effusion have increased in size.
.
CT chest [**2179-5-10**] - There is evidence of bilateral pleural
effusions and a large pericardial effusion. There is a small
amount of subsegmental atelectasis in the lingula and within the
right middle lobe. Some of these are likely relaxation changes
because of the large pleural pericardial fat pads adjacent. Mild
dilatation of the ascending aorta is seen. Similarly, mild
dilatation of the pulmonary arteries to about 3 cm is seen. The
examination was not tailored to evaluate the pulmonary arteries
but the visualized arteries appear normal. No masses or nodules
are seen.
.
Cath [**2179-6-16**]:
1. Pericardiocentesis was performed through subxiphoid entry.
2. Pulsatile arterial-appearing blood was expressed at first
needle
pass. Needle was withdrawn and local pressure applied.
3. Upon second pass, initial pericardial pressure of 9 mmHg was
recorded. A total of 350 cc of greenish fluid was removed and
sent to
the pathology laboratory for diagnosti
