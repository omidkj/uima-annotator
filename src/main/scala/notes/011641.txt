History of Present Illness:
 Ms. [**Known lastname 47766**] is a 70 y/o female with a history of HTN
who presents with acute onset headache and decreased
responsiveness. At [**Hospital 4199**] hospital she was found to have
a right intraparenchymal hemorrhage. She was by the report of
her
family in her USOH at 8:35 pm this evening. At 8:40, she
complained of "difficulty with vision" and an acute onset
headache. Shortly thereafter, her family found her minimally
responsive on the floor. EMS was called, and on their arrival
they documented a GCS of 6. An oral airway was placed, and she
reportedly had improvement of function, with no focal deficits.


She was taken to [**Hospital 4199**] hospital, where a head CT revealed a
large intraparenchmyal hemorrhage extending into the right
temporal and parietal lobes with approximately 8 mm midline
shift. Her functional status declined, and she was intubated.
She
was given etomidate and Versed (last given prior to transfer),
as
well as 10 mg of Decadron of 1 gram of Dilantin. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further treatment.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 47766**] was admitted to the ICU her BP was kept strictly
below 140, an A-line was placed. She was started on Nimodipine
and brought to the neuro intervention suite and had a coiling of
a A-Comm aneurysm and placement of a external ventriculostomy
drain. Later that day she had elevation of ICP to 30s it was
decided to bring her to the OR for a right temporal clot
evacuation with hemicraniectomy. Post operatively her ICP was
less than 20. On post operative day one she did not move her
left arm and minimal movement of left leg.

During her ICU course she was watched closely for vasospasm
which was ruled out by CTA and CTP on [**4-30**] and [**5-2**]. She had
difficulty managing her airway secretions after contracting a
pneumonia she was placed on Zosyn/Cipro. She ended up getting
bronched on [**5-10**] with improvement of secretions.  She required a
PEG tube due to lethargy and failure to pass a speech and
swallow evaluation.

She was transferred to the surgical floor on [**5-15**]. EEG was
obtained which showed mild->mod encephalopathy, consistent
w/dysfunction of b/l subcortical or deep midline structures. On
the floor her PICC line was removed and a peripheral line was
placed. She was followed by nutrition for tube feeding
recommendations. She was seen by PT and OT who recommended rehab
and continued to work with her during her stay on the floor.
During her hospital course she was started on Dilantin but then
switched over to Keppra due to fevers and question of increased
confusion. On discharge her exam was noted for left sided plegia
in her bilateral upper and lower extremities. She was
spontaneously moving her right arm and leg. She was oriented to
"hospital" and "[**Known firstname 72029**]" but did not know the year or date. On HD
#33 she was discharged to rehab for ongoing therapy and care.
She was tolerating her tube feeds, voiding without difficulty
and had no complaints of pain.
