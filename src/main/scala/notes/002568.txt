Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**]
Chief Complaint:
Pancreatitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right IJ Central line placement [**2114-8-24**] at [**Hospital1 18**] with removal of
(L) subclavian placed at OSH; intubation at OSH [**8-14**] and [**8-16**];
extubated [**2114-8-29**].

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 82971**] is a 39 year old man with diabetes,
hypertriglyceridemia, and alcoholism who presented to an OSH on
[**8-11**] with abdominal pain in the setting of increased EtOH use
over the last month.
.
There, admission labs were notable for lipase 1687, WBC 11 with
24% bands, Hct 50, AST 125, ALT 99, Na 125, gap of 17.
Cholesterol was approximately 3000. CT scan on admission showed
evidence of pancreatitis, pancreatic edema with free fluid in
the pelvis. He was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and
fluid resuscitation.
.
At the OSH ICU, he became progressively confused despite
treatment with lorazepam per CIWA. He developed respiratory
distress on [**8-14**] and was intubated. He self extubated on [**8-16**] and
did well initially, though had to be reintubated later that day
for respiratory distress and altered mental status. He has
undergone multiple attempts at weaning from the vent apparently
complicated by increased hypercapnia and hypoxia.
.
He remained febrile throughout his hospital course. He was
started on ceftriaxone and vancomycin empirically on [**8-14**]. Flagyl
was added subsequently, and then ceftrixone was changed to
levofloxacin. Oral vancomycin was added on [**8-19**]. His antibiotics
were again modified to doripenem on [**8-20**] with improvement of his
WBC from 25 to 12k by [**8-21**]. A RIJ had been placed on [**8-14**] and was
removed on [**8-21**]. Cultures of blood, urine, and lines have been
negative as have C diff toxin assays.
.
On evaluation in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he is intubated and unable to provide
any history.

OSH Imaging:
[**8-11**] CT abd/pelvis:
severe pancreatitis no necrosis, pseudocyst, or organized fluid
collection. fatty liver.
.
[**8-17**] CT abd/pelvis:
increased ascites and RP effusions, no organized collection
bilateral pleural effusions
.
[**Hospital1 18**] Imaging:
[**8-23**] EKG: Sinus rhythm. Early R wave progression. No previous
tracing available for comparison.
.
[**8-23**] CT head: Normal study.
.
[**8-23**] CT Abd/pelvis:
1. Extensive peripancreatic fluid collections extending from the
greater
curvature of the stomach into the deep pelvis in the presacral
area. Areas of hypoenhancement within the pancreas, particularly
within the body and neck are identified and concerning for
possible necrosis, although artifact from interdigitating fluid
cannot be excluded.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis.
3. Air within the bladder likely due to recent Foley
catheterization.
Clinical correlation is recommended.
4. Diffuse anasarca.
.
[**2114-8-28**] CT Abdomen/pelvis:
1. No CT evidence of pancreatic necrosis.
2. Grossly unchanged appearance of very large peripancreatic
fluid
collections, with largest collection adjacent to the greater
curvature of the stomach slightly more organized and increased
in size than seen previously.
3. Increased bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar
atelectasis
.
[**8-30**] Lower extremity doppler ultrasound:
1. Deep venous thrombosis involving the calf veins, including
both peroneal veins and one of the paired right posterior tibial
veins.
.
[**8-30**] CTA Chest:
1)Left Lower lobe subsegmental pulmonary embolism.
2)Large left pleural effusion with near-complete collapse of the
left lower lobe and right lower lobe atelectasis and small
pleural effusion.
3)Large pseudocyst has slightly decreased in size since the
previous abdominal study and now measures 6.9 x 10 cm.
.
[**9-2**] CXR:
Compared to [**8-30**], the general haziness of the left hemithorax is
substantially less, suggesting improvement in the pleural
effusion. The right central catheter has been removed and the
nasogastric tube remains coiled in the upper stomach.  No
evidence of acute pneumonia or vascular congestion.
.
[**2114-9-5**] Gallbladder U/S:
1. No gallstones identified within the gallbladder.
2. Mild right hydronephrosis possibly related to right ureter
passing through post-pancreatitis phlegmonous change from prior
recent CT scan.
3. Pseudocyst/inflammatory change incompletely evaluated in the
region of the distal pancreatic body and tail as noted on CT
scan from [**2114-8-11**].

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Course [**2114-8-23**] - [**2114-9-2**]:
Mr. [**Known lastname 82971**] is a 39M with h/o DM and alcoholism and pancreatitis
who is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for a higher level of care.
.
* Pancreatitis - Based on admission labs, pt with pancreatitis
on presentation. No evidence of necrosis on OSH imaging and
[**Hospital1 18**] imaging. Most likely precipitated by drinking binge. HCTZ
can also be associated with pancreatitis though less likely.
Triglycerides 259 here but approx 3000 per report at OSH,
suggesting there may also be some component of hyperlipidemia as
cause. Surgery was consulted who recommended supportive care
with fluids and fever management. Pt's increased abdominal
pressure may have contributed to his respiratory failure by
increasing bibasilar atelectasis and
