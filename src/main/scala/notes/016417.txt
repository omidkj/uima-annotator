Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Trauma service. Orthopedics and Plastics
Hand Surgery were consulted because of his injuries. His
injuries were managed non operatively. A short leg cast was
applied to his right leg and he may touch down weight bear on
this extremity. A healing boot was fitted for the left leg
because of the toe fractures. His left small finger metacarpal
fracture was managed with an ulnar gutter splint and he will
follow up in Plastics Hand Clinic in 2 weeks for repeat films.
He is to remain non weight bearing on that hand.

Because of his history of IgA nephropathy and s/p renal
transplant he was followed by Renal during his stay. His renal
function remained at baseline and his current immunosuppression
medications were continued.

A calcified thyroid nodule was found incidentally on CT imaging;
he should follow up with his primary care doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]
from rehab.

He was evaluated by Physical and Occupational therapy and is
being recommended for rehab after his acute hospital stay.
