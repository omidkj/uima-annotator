Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Vancomycin Hcl/D5w

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2534**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB/DOE

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
evacuation of retroperitoneal hematoma
excision of periaortic lymph nodes
ligation of [**Female First Name (un) 899**]
repair of iatrogenic splenic lac

History of Present Illness:
84 yo man w/ h/o AS, COPD, PVD who p/w SOB/dyspnea. Pt is a poor
historian, but per pt, describes decreased functional status
over sub-acute time course, with decrease mobility/increased
sedentary lifestyle over at least past 1 month due to increased
SOB/DOE. Pt states has had "more difficulty" with his breathing
over this past month, describes SOB at rest and with exertion,
to point where he became too uncomfortable so came to ED.
Otherwise denies CP/pressure, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity
edema, f/c, cough.
He presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with these complaints and was found
to have T 99.4, HR 100 (sinus), RR 40-50, BP 165/56, O2 84-86%
on RA, 100% on NRB. Labs notable for trop (trop 0.218). Pt given
80mg IV lasix with good UOP, combivent neb x 1, ASA 325mg x 1,
nitropaste 1 inch, and started on hep gtt and was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 86**] for further care.

On arrival to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 6 [**Hospital1 **], patient was noted to be tachypnic to
40's, visibly using accessory respiratory muscles to breath. He
was given another 80mg IV lasix x 1 with good UOP, but continued
resp distress. ABG was 7.34/67/70 on NRB and therefore was
transferred to CCU. Pt intubated. Has had been kept on
vent--thought to have COPD exacerbation, as well as CHF &
possible PNA. Question of PE also raised as D-Dimer elevated.
LENIs (-), though no CTA given renal dysfunction, nor V/Q given
underlying lung disease. Also, pt has been in and out of afib
(no record of it in past); started on dilt & heparin gtt for
this.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
The heart size is mildly enlarged but grossly unchanged. The
aorta is tortuous and calcified. The lungs are hyperinflated.
This most likely represent unlike emphysema. Perihilar opacities
involving the lower lobes are demonstrated, right slightly worse
than left and might represent pulmonary edema with asymmetric
appearance due to underlying emphysema. Small right pleural
effusion cannot be excluded. The slight asymmetry between the
lungs might represent underlying right lower lobe infectious
process which can be better characterized after resolving of
pulmonary edema.

ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT) PORT
IMPRESSION: No evidence of free air or pneumatosis, however,
plain radiograph is insensitive in the evaluation of bowel
ischemia and if there remains clinical concern, CT is
recommended to further evaluate.

Further pertinent evaluation:
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST [**2192-5-10**] 11:37 AM
1. Findings are consistent with hemorrhagic ascites; no fresh
hemorrhage or definitive source is evident on these images. The
hemorrhagic ascites does extend to the aorta and paraaortic
region, which were evacuated on the patient's recent surgery. A
splenic laceration is felt to be less likely.
A mass within the abdomen or underlying lesion cannot be
distinguished on this examination; a followup CT examination is
recommended. If the patient is stable, MRI may also be helpful.
2. Thickening of small bowel loops may be incident to ischemia,
edema, or hemorrhage.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary findings as
described above.

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2192-5-26**] 1:29 PM
1. Retroperitoneal hematoma extending along the left posterior
pararenal space inferiorly as far as the left groin and has
decreased in size when compared with the previous CT from two
weeks prior.
2. Ascites, which has increased in size when compared to the
previous CT.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis,
pleural calcification.
4. Splenic cysts.
5. Sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
6. Anasarca.

Brief Hospital Course:
This patient had a very protracted and complicated hospital
course. Below is a review of hospital course by system. In
general, Mr. [**Known lastname **] arrived at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with increasing
SOB/DOE, tx for acute exacerbation of CHF, and t/f to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further care. In ICU, con't resp failure, intubated and tx for
COPD, CHF, PNA, afib, glycemic control, HTN and renal issues. On
day 7, Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 1025**] developed ARF, a lactic acidosis, increased
ventilatory needs and worsening hemodynamic status. An abdominal
US was NEG and KUB gave no evidence. He developed increased
abdominal girth, and it was decided to take him for ex-lap for
sepsis, increased abdominal girth, ARF and lactic acidosis for
possible gut ischemia/infarct. Upon exploration, a
retroperitoneal hematoma was discovered and evacuated, a large
adhesed periaortic LN was excised and sent to path (found to be
paraganglioma) along with the the [**Female First Name (un) 899**] ligated and a iatrogenic
slenic lac controlled. Post operatively, the patien
