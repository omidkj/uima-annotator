Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1943**]
Chief Complaint:
Transferred from OSH with multifocal pneumonia,
tracheobronchomalacia, s/p PEA arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
88-year-old woman with moderate dementia and remote history of
breast cancer, who was admitted to [**Hospital3 8834**] on
[**11-30**] with difficulty with ambulation, progressive SOB, and pedal
edema. She was noted to have a low grade temp, a WBC count of
18K with left shift (17% bands), and bilateral perihilar
infiltrates on CXR. She was started on moxifloxacin. Flu swab
was negative. Ceftriaxone was added because of worsening
infiltrates on repeat CXR and a rising WBC count. An ID consult
was obtained, and they recommended treating with vancomycin and
moxifloxacin. A pulmonary consult was obtained to r/o empyema
although the pt was reportedly improving (afebrile, WBC
decreasing, O2 saturation in high 90's on 2L nasal cannula).

On [**12-6**], a right sided thoracentesis was performed and during
the procedure she became acutely SOB with hemoptysis (a few
cupfuls of fresh blood). She became bradycardic to the 10-20s
(sinus junctional rhythm) and a code blue was called. She was
intubated and CPR was performed. Epinephrine and atropine were
given. She regained a pulse after 2-6 minutes of compressions
(unclear). [**Name2 (NI) 6**] urgent bronchoscopy revealed significant TBM
bilaterally and two small blot clots, which were removed. A
right subclavian line was placed under sterile conditions and
CXR revealed a R mainstem intubation (corrected) and no PTX. She
became hypotensive and required neosynephrine and multiple fluid
boluses. Her antibiotics were expanded to vancomycin, zosyn, and
moxifloxacin. She gradually improved and was weaned off
neosynephrine. She was extubated on [**12-10**], maintained on BiPAP
for 24 hours, and was subsequently easily weaned to 2L NC. It
was deemed that she would need a tracheal stent and so transfer
to [**Hospital1 18**] was pursued.

At the time of transfer, she was reported as afebrile,
saturating well on 2L NC. She was tolerating a regular diet. She
had no further episodes of hemoptysis. Her vancomycin was
stopped today ([**12-11**]) with plans to stop moxifloxacin in the
next 1-2 days. At an unclear time, cefepime was started, which
she was to continue for an undetermined duration. She developed
delirium with intermittent agitation as well as sinus
tachycardia when agitated.

Upon arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ICU, she states that she is in no
pain. She denies CP/SOB. No fevers/chills. She thinks she is at
home, not a hospital, and that Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is her daughter [**Name (NI) **].

CXR ([**2174-12-11**]): There are bilateral consolidations, mostly
involving the right upper, left upper lobe as well as the mid
lung zones bilaterally and left retrocardiac area, that might be
consistent with the provided history of multifocal pneumonia.
There is small amount of left pleural effusion. There is no
apparent right pleural effusion demonstrated and the pigtail
catheter that is demonstrated projecting over the right upper
abdomen, most likely related to known inserted catheter for
drainage of right pleural effusion. The right subclavian line
tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction. There is no evidence
of pneumothorax within the limitations of this extremely limited
study where the patient's chin is obscuring the lung apices, in
particular on the left.

Brief Hospital Course:
88-year-old woman with baseline dementia requiring 24-hour care
was originally admitted to OSH on [**2174-11-30**] with multifocal
pneumonia, and her course was complicated by hemoptysis and PEA
arrest after thoracentesis on [**12-6**]. She was found to have
tracheobroncheal malacia during urgent bronchoscopy. She was
weaned off pressors and extubated on [**12-10**]. She was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] ICU on [**12-11**] for consideration of tracheal stent. In
our ICU, her antibiotics were discontinued, and her course was
notable for delirium and persistent tachycardia. Per ICU notes,
CTA on [**12-8**] at OSH showed no PE but had extensive multifocal
infiltrates in both upper lobes with moderate bilateral pleural
effusions (R>L). She also had a TTE on [**12-7**] at OSH which showed
LVEF >60% and mild AS.  She had a right pigtail catheter which
was reportedly clotted and non-functional, and a right
subclavian triple lumen catheter was removed on [**12-12**] prior to
transfer to the medical floor (Hospital Medicine Service).

1. PNA: No pathogen ever identified at OSH. The patient
completed 11 days of fluoroquinolone therapy and at least 10
days of ceftriaxone and vancomycin. Legionella and strep pneumo
Ags negative at OSH. On admission, the patient was afebrile with
resolving WBC count. HAP coverage with vanc/cefepime was
initially continued, but stopped on HD#2 as she has already
completed a full course of Abx.
Blood and urine cultures were negative.  The patient was
initially given supplemental O2 and nebs prn but was saturating
well on room air by the end of the hospital admission.

2. Blood cultures from [**12-11**] grew GPC in clusters, so she was
started empirically on vancomycin on [**12-13**]. This was stopped on
[**12-14**] as cultures were confirmed to be coagulase negative staph,
and catheter tip culture was negative. As her chest tube was
still not draining, IP was consulted and removed the catheter on
the evening of [**2174-12-13**].

3. Tracheobronchomalacia: IP assessment was that the risks of
tracheal stenting in this patient outweigh the potential
benefit. They discussed this with the patient's daughter, Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Known lastname **], who was in agreement.

4. Hemoptysis: Likely due to damage to bronchial artery or veins
during attempted thoracentesis. No evidence of recurrent
bleeding with chest tube (pigtail catheter) in place. No
evdience of PE on CT scan done on [**12-7**].  Chest tube was
maintained to wall suction. IP removed chest tube on [**2174-12-13**].

5. Tachycardia: The patient remained in sinus tachycardia
without ischemic changes. Likely due to resolving pneumonia,
pain,
