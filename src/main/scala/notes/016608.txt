History of Present Illness:
This 27 year old white male has a history of IV drug abuse and

current abuse of IV agents.  He underwent AVR with a mechanical
valve in [**4-1**] for endocarditis.
In [**Month (only) 1096**] he developed swelling of his left leg after a
questionable dog scratch.  He had recurrent low grade fevers and
malaise. Multiple cultures were negative and a CT scan revealed
what appeared to be a large (14x17) abscess of the aortic root,
immediately adjacent to the sternum. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for evaluation and definitive treatment.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2116-1-27**] where he
underwent a redo sternotomy and received a valved conduit
homograft with reimplantation of the coronary arteries for
surgical correction of his prosthetic valve endocarditis.
Intraoperatively a large abscess was seen at the aortic root.
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred to the CVICU in good condition on levo and
phenylephrine for further monitoring.  By POD 1 he was
extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.  He was
hemodynamically stable, off of all drips.  At this time he was
found suitable for transfer to the floor.  Tissue cultures grew
[**Female First Name (un) **] albicans.  The infectious disease service was consulted
for management of antimicrobial therapy.  The patient was
treated with flucytosine and ambisome given his operative room
tissue cultures which grew [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans.  Although he had
positive blood cultures for this same bug preoperatively, his
blood cultures since the operation remainded no growth to date
at the time of discharge.  The patient did develop a left iliac
thrombus and vascular surgery was consulted.  As the artery did
not appear infected, and surgical treatment would be quite
invasive, it was decided to monitor this lesion.  Additionally,
the patient developed a splenic infarct, likely from septic
emboli.  The transplant surgery service was consulted.  He did
develop abdominal pain from this, however, tolerated a diet and
maintained good bowel function.  The patient has a history of
IVDA and is maintained on methadone.  He did have high narcotic
requirements, and a consult was requested of the pain service.
Neurontin was added at their request with good relief.  Chest
tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
PICC line was placed for long term antimicrobial therapy.  Due
to the fungemia, ophthalmology consult was requested and
assessment revealed a normal eye exam with no evidence of fungal
eye infection.  His creatinine began to rise on [**2116-1-30**] and
toradol and lasix were therefore discontinued.  The patient made
good progress post-operatively, showing good strength and
balance with physical therapy.  He was transfered on [**2116-1-31**] to
Bay State Hospital for further management of his medical issues
including monitoring of his renal function on his antibiotics
for his fungemia.
