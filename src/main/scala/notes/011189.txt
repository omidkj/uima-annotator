ECHO
The left ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline
dilated. There is
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Overall
left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed. Resting
regional wall
motion abnormalities include anteroseptal, anterior
hypokinesis/akinesis and
apical akinesis/dyskinesis. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There
is no pericardial effusion. No apical thrombus seen (cannot
exclude).
.
CATH
Initial angiography showed a proximally occluded LAD.
We planned to recanalize the vessel. Eptifibatide was continued.
A 6
French XBLAD3.5 guide provided good support. The lesion was
crossed with
great difficulties using a Choice PT wire, which was then
exchanged for
a Prowater wire. Thrombectomy was performed using an Export
catheter.
The lesion was then pre-dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon at 8 atm.
Next,
two overlapping 3.0x3 mm and 3.0x28 mm Cypher DES were deployed
in the
mid and proximal LAD at 14 atm. Post-dilation was performed with
a
3.25x23 mm Highsail balloon at 16 atm. Angiography showed slow
flow in
D1, which was rescued with a 2.0 mm ACE balloon at 8 atm. Final
angiography showed no residual stenosis in the LAD, some
thrombus in D1
with an 80% resdual stenosis, no dissection and TIMI 3 flow in
both
vessels.  The patient left the lab in stable condition.

* COMMENTS:     1.  Selective coronary angiography in this right
dominant
patient revealed severe single vessel CAD.  The RCA was
angiographically
normal.  The Left Main and LCX were also both angiographically
normal.
The LAD was completely occluded at its origin.  The D1 also had
thrombus and stenosis at its origin
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed mild RA pressure elevation of
10mmHG.
The pulmonary pressures were slightly elevated at 32/17 and the
PCWP was
moderately elevated to 21mmHG consistent with abnormal diastolic

function.  The cardiac index was depressed at 1.83 l/min/m2.
3.  Successful stenting of the LAD with two 3.0 mm Cypher
drug-eluting
stents, which were post-dilated to 3.25 mm.
4.  Successful insertion of a 40 cc IABP with good diastolic
augmentation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 43 year-old male with HTN, smoking history, Family
Hx of CAD who presented with anterolateral ST elevations and
found to have proximal occlusion of LAD in the cath lab. The
following issues were addressed during his hospital stay:

1. Cardiovascular
A. Coronary Artery Disease: Given complete proximal LAD
occlusion in cath lab, 2 DES were placed in the artery with
significant improvement in blood flow. Patient tolerated
procedure well. An intra-aortic balloon pump was also placed in
the cath lab with good diastolic augmentation. Patient received
integrillin drip for 18 hours post-cath.  Also started on
ASA/Plavix/Statin/ACEI. BB was started prior to discharge, and
medications were titrated up as tolerated. Patient was evaluated
by Physical Therapy and cleared for discharge home with
recommendations for cardiac rehabilitation.

B. Pump: At cath, CO 3.24, CI 1.86. An IABP was placed at cath
for afterload reduction and better coronary perfusion.  This was
discontinued the following day. LVEDP was 21 on cath, however
post-cath patient voided 450cc without any lasix. ECHO showed EF
35%, anterospetal, anterior hypokinesis/akinesis, apical
akinesis/dyskinesis, with no overt apical thrombus visualized.
Given apical akinesis, patient was started on Coumadin and
bridged with heparin until therapeutic INR was achieved.

C. Rhythm: Patient in sinus rhythm, with initial tachycardia of
multifactorial etiology: fever, acute coronary syndrome,
dehydration, and poor EF with compensatory tachycardia to
maintain cardiac output. Patient's HR began to decrease
gradually post-MI, with fever resolution and improved cardiac
function.  No significant events were noted on telemetry.
Patient to follow-up with Electrophysiology in 1 month for ICD
placement evaluation.

2. FEVER
Patient developed fever of unclear etiology post-MI; UA, CXR
negative. 1 set blood cultures with gram positive cocci
clusters/pairs, coagulase negative, likley contaminant given
clinical picture. Other work-up was negative, and fever curve
trended down without antibiotic therapy. Impression was fever
secondary to acute myocardial infarction and cytokine release.
Patient was without evidence of leukocytosis, and was afebrile x
48h prior to discharge without Tylenol administration.
.
3. HTN
Patient initially with asymptomatic relative hypotension
initially, which resolved with cardiac revascularization and
gentle fluid boluses. Patient discharged on Toprol XL 50 and
Lisinopril 5, to follow-up in [**Hospital 191**] clinic for further control.
.
4. PSORIASIS
Patient with bilateral psoriatic plaques over arms, back, legs.
No acute issues as inpatient, to be followed as outpatient.
.
5. HEME
Blood bank contact[**Name (NI) **] team as patient with [**Name (NI) 25948**] antibody on
Type and Screen, usually seen in patients with history of
transfusion. Patient denies any history of blood product
transfusion. Labs not consistent with hemolysis; haptoglobin
350s, adjusted retic count WNL (LDH cannot be used as marker
given recent infarction)
Patient reportedly with sickle cell trait, nothing to work-up
further as inpatient.
.
6. Prophylaxis
Patient on heparin gtt while being bridged to Coumadin. Patient
ambulating, had BM while inpatient.
