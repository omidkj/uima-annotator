Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 495**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension, respiratory distress


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Multi Lumen - [**2141-10-21**] 09:09 AM
Arterial Line - [**2141-10-21**] 05:30 PM
Midline placed - [**2141-10-25**]
Trach placement - [**2141-10-21**]


History of Present Illness:
53 yoM w/ a h/o severe COPD s/p prolonged hospitilation for COPD
flare, s/p trach and 1.5 years trach / vent dependent due to PNA
and ARDS / COPD flare now s/p trach removal 3-5 days ago
presents w/ respiratory distress and hypotension.  EMS was
called mainly due to increased secretions and hypoxia however
his hypoxia had resolved when EMS had arrived, on a different O2
sat monitor he was in the 90s on room air rather than in the 60s
as they were initially called for.
.
The patient is unable to converse but is able to answer yes or
no questions.  Upon questioning he is able to say that he has
had a cough for at least months, over the past few weeks it is
worsening, not in frequency but it is more productive.  He has
not felt short of breath but does have some orthopnea.  He has
no functional capacity at baseline.  He denies any pain
anywhere, no chest pain, no abdominal pain.  He denies any
lightheadedness.  He feels generally well and states he feels
fine.
.
Labile blood pressures despite 3.5 liters of fluid now but
intermittently with SBPs in the 80s.
.
Patient initially refused any medical care and seemed to have
capacity.  Patient has schizoaffective disorder, psych was
called and he was more delierious at that time and he was not
answering questions and therefore deemed uncapable.
.
VBG drawn and increased CO2 so a thought was CO2 narcosis, but
w/ supplemental O2 3L NC and mental status improved but not CO2.
.
rec'd levo / vancomycin zosyn, 3.5 liters of fluid as above and
decadron 10mg IV x 1.  afebrile.

CXR Portable ([**2141-10-25**]): The tracheostomy tube tip is
approximately 3 cm above the carina. No significant change in
the right lung consolidation, bilateral pleural effusion, and
perihilar vascular engorgement is demonstrated compared to the
prior study. The right internal jugular line was removed in the
meantime interval.

CXR Portable ([**2141-10-21**]): Interval removal of tracheostomy tube.
There is persistent collapse of the right middle and lower
lobes. Right-sided pleural effusion is seen. There is no
pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette cannot be evaluated due to
opacities from collapsed lung. The trachea is deviated to the
right and unchanged.


Brief Hospital Course:
53M with COPD and history of chronic respiratory failure; s/p
recent trach removal at rehab and here w/ increased secretions;
now s/p replacement of trach and continued labile BP of unclear
etiology.

#. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Trach replaced on admission
- had been removed 5 days prior to admission. Chest radiograph
with white out of right middle and lower lung fields ??????improved
on discharge. Mucus plugging was high on differential. Possible
pneumonia hidden within white out. Sputum culture grew
Pseudomonas and Staph aureus ?????? unclear if this was colonizer or
actual infection. COPD exacerbation also on differential given
considerable wheezing on admission. Initially treated with
vancomycin, ceftaz, and TMP-SMX (given history of
Stenotrophomonas). As no clear indication of active pneumonia
(afebrile, slightly elevated WBC count which may be due to
steroid therapy, and + culture thought to be colonizers), was
started on treatment with short course of ceftaz for bronchitis.
Tobramycin, which was initially added for double coverage of
pseudomonas, and vancomycin were discontinued. Ceftaz day 4 on
[**2141-10-25**]; midline placed for additional 3 days of
administration.
- Steroids initially increased and tapered to home dose on
discharged (hydrocortisone 20mg PO QAM, 5mg PO QPM)
- Needs aggressive sunctioning for continued considerable
secretions
- Staying on vent may be best option given patient??????s level of
discomfort off of vent
- Flovent started [**2141-10-24**] for severe COPD

#. Hypotension: Occasionally pressured dropped to MAPs in 50s.
Thought initially to be related to adrenal insufficiency. No
evidence of autopeep, hypovolemia, sepsis, or autonomic
insufficiency. Has history of adrenal insufficiency, now on high
dose steroids. On discharge decreased steroid dose to home
regimen as above.

# Schizoaffective d/o vs. schizophrenia: Per psych patient did
not have capacity to refuse medical care on admission. Continued
effexor, risperdal and depakote. Valproic acid level within
normal range on [**2141-10-24**].

# Seizures: Tonic-clonic seizures in past, thought to be related
to previous CVA and 'toxic metabolic disturbances' upon previous
admissions. Continued Keppra 250mg po bid. Continued valproic
