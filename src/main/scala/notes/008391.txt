Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 10493**]
Chief Complaint:
Neck pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion C6-C7 [**9-26**]

History of Present Illness:
She has had chronic left neck/upper back pain radiating to her
4th and 5th fingers w/ "pins and needles" sensation in these
fingers who was hospitalized in [**Month (only) 359**] for pain control and
then on [**2152-9-26**] for ACDF of C6-C7.  Her post op course was
uncomplicated and she was discharged home. Pain in the same
distribution has been an ongoing issue and she represented on
[**10-2**] with the same complaints. She was admitted to the
neurosurgery team at that time. MRI on [**10-4**] was performed (under
anesthesia [**12-29**] to pain) which showed the spinal fusion at C6-7
without evidence of discitis or osteomyelitis or paraspinal
abscess. It did show degenerative changes, but no intrinsic
spinal cord signal abnormalities or extrinsic spinal cord
compression. Chronic pain team was consulted at that time and
recommended adding gabapentin and lidoderm patch to her
oxycontin/oxycodone; she is not a candidate for injection given
her recent surgery.
.
On [**10-6**] at 10am, she was noted to be hypoxic to O2 sats in high
80s on RA; mid 90s on 2-4L NC. She was later weaned off
supplemental O2, but again desaturated. She refused nasal
cannula (uncomfortable) so was put on 70% face tent w/ O2 sats
in the low 90s. ABG was obtained at 7:30pm which showed
7.39/50/86/31 (on face tent at that time).  CXR was obtained
which showed atelectasis. CTA chest did not show e/o PE, but did
show e/o multilobar ground glass opacities.  Abx. was broadened
to cipro and vanco.  She was then placed in [**Month/Year (2) 597**] w/ O2 sats in
the high 90s. Repeat gas 7.39/52/80/33.  She continued to have
desats to 60s-70s when transiently off [**Last Name (LF) 597**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] MICU transfer was
requested.
.
Of note, she reports fevers to 101 at home postoperatively.
Today she spiked to Tm of 103. She reports that she awoke and
had "lost her voice" w/ sx of sore throat. She also endorses
nonproductive, but loose cough again beginning this morning. She
has some SOB currently when off mask.
.
Additionally of note, during a [**2142**] admission for back surgery,
she had a multilobar staph pneumonia which was treated w/
levofloxacin and vanco.

BAL: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

MRI C-spine: 1. Status post spinal fusion at C6-7 level without
evidence of discitis or osteomyelitis or paraspinal abscess.
2. Degenerative changes at multiple levels as described above as
seen on the previous MRI examinations. No evidence of intrinsic
spinal cord signal abnormalities or extrinsic spinal cord
compression

CTA Chest: Right hilar lymphadenopathy and multifocal
ground-glass opacities. Favored differential diagnosis includes
infection. Other etiologies such as pulmonary edema are much
less favored given the absence of pleural effusions. Pulmonary
hemorrhage remains a diagnostic possibility and correlation with
recent coagulation parameters is recommended.

PICC placement: RADIOLOGIST: Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 9441**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 4686**]
performed the procedure. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4686**], the Attending
Radiologist, was present and supervised the entire procedure.
TECHNIQUE: Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the
left basilic vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance
using a micropuncture set. Hard copies of ultrasound images were
obtained before and immediately after establishing intravenous
access. A peel-away sheath was then placed over a guidewire and
a double-lumen PICC line measuring 41.0 cm in length was then
placed through the peel-away sheath with its tip positioned in
the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance. Position of the catheter
was confirmed by a fluoroscopic spot film of the chest.
The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then removed. The
catheter was secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile
dressing applied.
The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no
immediate complications.
IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided
double-lumen PICC line placement via the left basilic venous
approach. Final internal length is 41.0 cm, with the tip
positioned in SVC. The line is ready to use.

CXR [**10-13**]: A single portable image of the chest was obtained.
Low lung volumes are again noted. There is minimal improved
aeration of the left base. There is a persistent right basilar
opacity, likely reflects underlying atelectasis and/or
pneumonia. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
limits. Cervical spinal fusion hardware is again seen.
