Brief Hospital Course:
51 year old man transferred from outside hospital to [**Hospital1 18**] with
inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction.

#STEMI - the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] catheter
laboratory with ETA listed as 930am, symptom-to-balloon time of
3 hrs 15 min.  On arrival, patient's BP 112/71, HR 76.  In the
cath lab results notable for LMCA normal, LAD 40-50% stenosis,
RCA 90% stenosis of distal RCA, 60-70% of proximal RCA stenosis.
 Patient's distal RCA was stented w/ a DES and rescued the
subsequently jailed RPL branch with a balloon. Proximal RCA was
also stented w/DES.  The patient's ST elevations improved
markedly prior to discharge, with evolution of inferior Q waves.
 He was discharged on atorvastatin, metoprolol, aspirin and
plavix, with follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3321**].

#NSVT - the patient had multiple runs of NSVT in the 24 hours
post-MI, the longest of which was 20 beats.  This was thought to
be normal re-perfusion arrythmias.  The patient had no further
runs of NSVT after 24 hours.

Discharge Instructions:
You had an heart attack caused by a blockage in your right
coronary artery. These blockages were opened and a drug eluting
stent was placed to keep the artery open. You will need to take
a 325 mg aspirin and Plavix every day for at least one year. Do
not miss [**First Name (Titles) 691**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4319**] or stop taking Plavix or aspirin for one full
year unless your cardiologist tells you to.
other medication changes:
1. Start Metoprolol 25 mg daily to slow your heart rate down and
help your heart recover from the heart attack
2. Start Aspirin and Plavix as noted above to prevent the stent
from clotting off.
3. Start Atorvastatin (Lipitor) to lower your cholesterol and
prevent further blockages
5.
