Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Phenobarbital

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 495**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tracheostomy changed to a #6 [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 67572**] [**Last Name (un) 295**] adjustable phalange
tracheostomy.

NOTE:  THIS PATIENT CANNOT BE INTUBATED FROM ABOVE DUE TO HEAVY
TUMOR BURDEN.


History of Present Illness:
This is a 51-year-old gentleman with a past medical history
significant for laryngeal cancer s/p radiation and chemotherapy,
COPD, hypertension, narcotic dependence, now ventilator
dependent with a tracheostomy tube, transferred from [**Hospital **]
rehab for difficult suctioning and worsening respiratory
distress.  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was first diagnosed with laryngeal cancer
about 2.5 months ago, and has had a complicated medical course
since that time; he was initially treated with Taxotere,
cisplatin, and infusional 5-FU but missed multiple treatments
due to hospitalizations and infections.  Most recently he has
had c.diff and is currently on vancomycin through his G-tube.

During the afternoon on day of admission, patient was having
increasing respiratory distress at [**Hospital **] rehab.  He was
apparently bronched at that facility with report of tumor
invading the trach.  He was transported to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
work-up by IP.  Upon arrival to the MICU, patient was anxious
with increased work-of-breathing.  Vitals were:97.6, 127/94,
127, and 100% tached on 100%FI02.  Upon transfer of patient from
EMS stretcher to MICU bed, patient desatted precipitously.
Respiratory therapy attempted to suction and "bag him," but
initially met a lot of resistance.  Patient was repositioned and
sats climbed up from 80s to 100%.  IP was called urgently and
took patient to OR for trach revision.  T-tube was found to be
flush against the trachea, preventing adequate aeration.  Trach
was changed to #6 [**Last Name (un) 295**] adjustable and sutured in.  Looking
from above, tumor was found to be occluding entire posterior
pharynx down to vocal cords.  Patient had immediate improvement
in symptoms and was transferred back to MICU without incident.

Patient is unable to provide detailed history due anxiety and
subsequent sedation after procedure.  According to his sister
[**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **], he has had a very rough couple of months, in-and-out
of the hospital with multiple infections and complications.

Past Medical History:
--Sqaumous cell carcinoma of the supraglottic larynx
well-moderately differentiated, s/p chemo and radiation
--COPD
--Hypertension
--Chronic low back pain
--Enterobacter + sputum cultures from [**Hospital3 23439**] Hospital in
[**11-29**]

details unable to obtain.

FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the
tracheostomy tube has been changed. The tip of the current tube
projects 4.5 cm above the carina. Unchanged overinflation with
scarring at the right lung. Normal size of the cardiac
silhouette. No pleural effusions.

Marked overinflation. Scarring at the right lung apex. No safe
evidence of
pneumonia, no pleural effusions, no pulmonary edema. Borderline
size of the cardiac silhouette. Tracheostomy tube in situ. Left

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 51-year-old gentleman with a pmhx. of laryngeal cancer
s/p chemo and radiation, now vent dependent, presents from
[**Hospital1 **] for respiratory distress and difficulty suctioning
trach.

# RESPIRATORY DISTRESS:  Most immediate etiology of respiratory
distress is mal-placement of trach tube.  Upon investigation of
trach placement by IP, it was determined that trach tube was
completely flush with anterior trachea, with end occluded. There
was also extensive tumor invasion of the upper airway, superior
to the trach tube. Original trach tube was exchanged for one
with a better fit.  Tube was also sutured in place to prevent
further migration.  After procedure, patient was breathing
comfortably with normal sats, normal respiratory rate. Patient
was transitioned to PSV the following morning without
complication. IP mentioned that close follow up was not
necessary, however, patient could follow with IP as needed.

****Key is that he cannot have this trach changed because his
airway is so tenuous that any trach change would cause imminent
airway collapse. Any trach change would lead to imminent airway
collapse****

# ELEVATED WBC:  Patient presented with leukocytosis and left
shift.  Although there has been concern for pseudomonas and
enterobacter pneumonia in the past, it appears (from previous
notes) that these organisms were thought to be contaminants.
Patient was treated briefly with imipenem, but was not
transferred here on any antibiotics for these organisms.
Patient's leukocytosis may just be in the setting of multiple
tracheal manipulations as well as high tumor burden.  He is
afebrile currently and has no other labs to suggest sepsis
(lactate is 0.6).  Patient was given one dose of zosyn on
arrival to the MICU, but we did not give him any further
antibiotics. He remained stable, afebrile and without any

# C DIFF:  Continued PO vancomycin. No clear course was
documented. Patient to continue his extended course per his
regimen continued at [**Hospital **] Rehab.

# ANXIETY/DEPRESSION:  According to [**Hospital1 **] notes and patient's
sister, Mr. [**Known lastname **] has been anxious as of late.  He seems to
respond well to seroquel. Continued duloxetin, continued
seroquel standing and prn, and continued clonazepam prn. Patient
remained relatively free of acute attacks of anxiety.

# PAIN:  Continued home regimen of fentanyl patch, Morphine PRN,
Oxycodone PRN, plus-Lidocaine patch. Patient's chronic pain
remained at baseline and was well controlled.

# HYPERCALCEMIA:  Likely in setting of malignancy. Gave gentle
fluids and his calcium somewhat improved from 12.6 to 11.5. He
