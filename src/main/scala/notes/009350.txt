Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 13541**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoglycemia, hypoxemia, hypothermia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation
Arterial line placement
Central venous line placement
Peripherally-inserted venous catheter

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 32496**] is a 62 yo wheelchair bound F with IDDM c/b
peripheral neuropathy with CHF 20%, s/p right BKA, daughter
nurse, picked her up at adult day care, noticed somnolence,
checked glu - 25.  Went to local ER.  Gave amp D50 and gave her
zosyn, but there is no documented temperature.  She was noted to
desat to the 70s on RA, but she was asymptomatic.  She was put
on nonrebreather. She was also noted to be bradycardic in 40s.
She was tx here for further management.  Upon arrival, she was
again without complaints.  She was noted to desat to 82 without
NRB.

Vitals in the ED: HR 60s.  T 92-93 rectal.  HR 60, BP 160/63, RR
19, 98%NRB.  No other antibiotics.  1 blood and urine here.  2
bloods at outside ed.  lactate 1.5.  Cr 1.4 there, 1.8 here.  No
CTA done, but she was placed on heparin out of concern for PE.
She was put on a warming blanket.

In the ICU, she endorsed cough x 2 days, atypical chest pain.
She denies abd pain, dysuria or increased frequency, diarrhea,
n/v.  She subsequently developed hypotension with SBP 70s to
80s.  Given her evolving sepsis picture, pulmonary edema,
possible benefit of better monitoring, and possible need for
pressors, an arterial line was placed and she was intubated.

CXR [**10-23**]:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**10-22**], there is
persistence of
diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications. Again, this is
consistent with
ARDS, though vascular congestion or diffuse pneumonia can
certainly not be
excluded radiographically. Various monitoring and support
devices remain in place. The left hemidiaphragm is not sharply
seen on the current study. This could reflect some pleural
fluid, atelectatic change, or even focal
consolidation at the left base.

ABD/PELVIS CT [**10-18**]:
1. Significantly limited CT examination without intravenous
contrast with no source of infection identified. If there
remains a high clinical concern for an occult infection, can
consider correlation with a dedicated tagged white cell scan.
2. Ground glass and interstitial opacities within visualized
lung bases in
conjunction with small bilateral pleural effusions, small
pericardial
effusion, and probable compression atelectasis. These all likely
relate to
fluid overload/CHF with no discrete pneumonia noted.
3. Diffuse anasarca.
4. Unchanged pancreatic parenchymal calcifications again
suggestive of prior episodes of pancreatitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
62 yo female with DM, HTN, CAD, dementia, who presented with
hypothermia, hypoxia, and hypotension.

# Sepsis: The patient's clinical picture was consistent with
sepsis, initially concerning for urosepsis based on her UA in
the ED. Early goal-directed therapy was initiated, with prompt
transfer to the ICU.  However, no bacteria grew from the urine,
and nothing was grown from blood and sputum cultures. She was
covered broadly with vancomycin, zosyn, and levofloxacin and she
improved clinically.  She was ruled out for respiratory viruses.
 Podiatry was consulted and did not feel that her left foot was
infected, only colonized.  Bronchoscopy was also not revealing.
CT abd & pelvis were also unremarkable for source. Given no
clear source and clinical improvement she was given a 10-day
course of empiric antibiotics with the last doses on [**10-25**]. She
remained afebrile during the latter portion of her hospital
course.

# Hypotension/Hypertension: The patient was hypotensive on
admission requiring agressive fluid resuscitation (11L in the
first 24 hours) and pressors.  She became hypertensive after the
second or third day of her ICU stay and was gradually started
back on some of her home medications, metoprolol and amlodipine.
 Hydralazine was started due to hypertension and wanting to hold
enalapril and HCTZ given her acute renal failure.  As kidney
function improved enalapril was started and gradually titrated
upward, while Hydralazine was discontinued. Her
anti-hypertensive regimen will need further adjustment as an
outpatient.

# Respiratory Failure: While in the ICU, she developed
progressive respiratory distress requiring endotracheal
intubation, the etiology of which proved unclear. Serial CXRs
appeared most consistent with ARDS, but lung compliance proved
good on the ventilator.  Fluid overload was also postulated. She
was diuresed with Lasix, and successfully extubated on [**2120-10-23**].
 Her length of stay fluid balance was still +4 L at the time of
discharge but she was autodiuresing well so no diuretics were
initiated.

# Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine was elevated to 1.8 on
admission and peaked at 2.1 but returned to a baseline of 1.2.
The patient likely had ARF [**1-13**] hypoperfusion.

# Question of DIC: Concering because of thrombocytopenia and
coagulopathy.  However, Heme was consulted and did not think her
presentation was consistent with DIC.  She also ruled out for
HIT.  Her platelet count was stable at the time of discharge.

# Chronic diastolic heart failure: Pt. was found to have a
normal EF on ECHO (>55%) and severe diastolic dysfunction.  She
was restarted on an ACEi as described above, a beta blocker, and
aspirin.

# History of seizure: Patient has a history of a recent seizure
of unclear etiology.  It may be related to a past stroke,
however.  She was managed with keppra.

# DM: Patient was managed on an ISS while inpatient.  At the
time of discharge, her daughter reported episodes
