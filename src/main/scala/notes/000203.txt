Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2698**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization

History of Present Illness:
83 yo F with CAD, CHF (EF of 40% in [**4-/2126**]) presenting with
chest pain. Patient has had three episodes of chest pressure
over the past two days. First episode was on Sunday night, where
she experienced substernal chest pressure with radiation to her
left jaw associated with some nausea. She thought it might be
indigestion and ate some food and felt better. She had another
similar episode the next day but does not remember when. Her
most concerning episode was at 10 pm the night of admission
where she experienced sudden onset [**11-17**] substernal chest
pressure at rest that radiated to her left jaw and lasted
slightly longer than her previous episodes. All episodes were
non-exertional in nature and she was sitting in a lounge chair
at those times. This last episode was associated with LH and a
feeling of pre-syncope although she did not pass out. No
palpitations. Also with some SOB. She has no anginal equivalent
and states she had a 'silent MI' in the past. She has had this
chest pain about three years ago and states she was hospitalized
at [**Hospital1 112**] at the time and had a negative stress test. Last cardiac
catherization was in the [**2096**] but she states she is allergic to
the contrast and cannot take aspirin due to an allergy as a
child (which is unknown) Given her symptoms, she presented to
the ED for further evaluation.
.
In ED VS were 98 76 134/85 20 100% on RA. Labs sig for WBC of
3.4, BNP of 1833, and Trop-T of < 0.01. U/A with moderate
leukocytes and +WBCs. CXR shows no focal pneumonia or effusions,
thoracic vertebral compression fracture (likely from fall
suffered in [**7-/2126**] and known to PCP). EKG with ST depressions in
V5 and V6 and TWI in same leads. Pt received Plavix 75 mg PO x1,
Nitro 0.3 mg PO x1, Morphine 2 mg IV x1 (had no reaction to it
although listed as an allergy), and Zofran, and Ciprofloxacin
500 mg PO x1 for positive UTI. Pt wwith 2/10 chest pain so
started on heparin gtt. Guiac negative. VS on transfer: 71
121/57 20 98% on 2 L NC.
.
On the floor, the patient endorses [**2126-2-9**] chest pressure but
states it is much improved compared when she first presented.
She is very tired and would like to sleep.

IMAGES/REPORTS
.......................
CXR [**2127-4-16**]
UPRIGHT PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:
Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. The hilar and mediastinal
contours are within normal limits and stable. Linear left
retrocardiac densities are most compatible with atelectasis.
There is no focal consolidation, pleural
effusion, or pneumothorax. An anterior wedge compression defect
of the lower thoracic vertebral body is new since the [**2126-5-13**] examination.
 .
IMPRESSION:
1. No pneumonia.
2. Anterior wedge compression defect of a lower thoracic
vertebral body, new since [**2126-5-13**].
....................................
Plain film of right hand [**2127-4-18**]
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: New bruising and pain over the right
middle finger.
.
FINDINGS: Unremarkable soft tissues. Osteopenia which limits the
evaluation of subtle fractures. No fracture is identified. No
dislocations. No degenerative or erosive changes.
 .
IMPRESSION: No fracture.
.......................................
ECHO [**2127-4-16**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal
hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferior and inferolateral
walls. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 40-45
%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
