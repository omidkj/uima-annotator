HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  (per Medical Intensive Care Unit
admission note)  The patient is a 75 year old male with
alcoholic cirrhosis, ascites, edema, multiple
gastrointestinal bleeds from Grade I varices, and lower
gastrointestinal bleed from diverticula and hemorrhoids.
Today, he noted explosive diarrhea, dark and melanotic per
patient, about every two hours, and he came to the Emergency
Department.  He was started on Motrin four times a day times
four days for gouty flare.  He complained of lightheadedness
but denied fever or chills, nausea or vomiting, chest pain,
shortness of breath, hematemesis, bright red blood per
rectum.

He had a colonoscopy on [**2135-7-7**], for bleeding, with
polyps.  He had a resection at that time and was also noted
to have diverticula with internal hemorrhoids.  He is
quasi-transfusion dependent for packed red blood cells in two
days.  Nasogastric lavage was negative in the Emergency
Department.

1.  Cirrhosis secondary to alcohol.
2.  Atrial flutter status post cardioversion and
arteriovenous node ablation.
3.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass graft, left internal mammary artery to left anterior
descending, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal stent
[**38**]/[**2132**].
4.  History of multiple gastrointestinal bleeds.
5.  Diverticulosis.
6.  Multiple colonic polypectomies.
7.  Esophageal varices [**4-18**], Grade I.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   Married; quit alcohol.  Thirty pack year
smoking history.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Temperature 97.1 F.; blood pressure
126/44; heart rate 70.  In general, an elderly male in no
apparent distress.  HEENT:  Mucous membranes were moist.
Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular is
regular rate and rhythm, Grade III/VI systolic murmur at left
upper sternal border.  Abdomen soft, obese, nontender,
nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities with no
pedal edema.  Neurological:  Alert, pleasant conversant.

LABORATORY ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 3.8,
hematocrit 25.5, platelets 106, 72% neutrophils, 18%
lymphocytes, 6% monocytes, 2% eosinophils.  Sodium 135,
potassium 4.4, chloride 99, carbon dioxide 26, BUN 40,
creatinine 3.0 from baseline of 1.5 to 1.8.  Glucose 122, INR
1.1.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for gastrointestinal bleed and multiple
bleeding sources.  Gastroenterology was consulted who
recommended beginning Octreotide, taking a right upper
quadrant ultrasound and transfusing as needed.

The patient had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed on
[**2135-7-17**], which revealed Grade I esophageal varices
without evidence of recent bleed.  Small fundic polyp; biopsy
was not performed as he is currently undergoing evaluation
for gastrointestinal bleed and this can be re-evaluated at
the time of next esophagogastroduodenoscopy.

The patient then underwent colonoscopy on [**7-18**], which
revealed diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon.  There were
large nonbleeding rectal veins and varices noted; otherwise
normal colonoscopy to the cecum.  There was no source clearly
obtained from study.

The patient was transfused to maintain hematocrit greater
than 30.  The plan was discussed regarding the possibility of
performing capsule endoscopy, however, given the patient's
reluctance for surgery, the decision was made to not pursue
further work-up and to transfuse only as needed.

The patient remained hemodynamically stable with a normal
hematocrit.

2.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient with a long standing
pancytopenia seen evidenced one year ago.  He also had acute
blood loss anemia as described above.  Reticulocyte count was
performed which revealed an appropriate bone marrow response
to ongoing anemia with a reticulocyte index of only 1.5.  His
platelets remained low but as he had stopped bleeding, he did
not require any platelet transfusions.  He was not on any
heparin products.  Pt really is against invasive aproach and it
was felt that even if aggressive w/u including bone marrow bx,
the likelyhood of finding a reversible cause was very unlikely so
no further w/u will be pursue.

3.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  On [**2135-7-19**], the patient spiked a
fever to 103.3 F.  Urinalysis was positive for trace
leukocytes, 11 to 20 white blood cells, moderate bacteria
with zero to two white blood cell casts, so he was started on
Levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. q. day times seven day course.  He
was not on a Foley catheter.

Chest x-ray, blood cultures and urine cultures were obtained
prior to initiating antibiotics.  Blood cultures ultimately
revealed Staphylococcus aureus.  The patient was initially
started on Vancomycin until the sensitivities returned
showing Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and he
was changed to oxacillin to complete a two week course.

He had a transesophageal echocardiogram which showed no
evidence of endocarditis and the decision was made not to
pursue a transesophageal echocardiogram given that he is
clinically stable.  His urine culture initially came showing
fecal contamination.  A repeat urine culture sent after
initiation of Levofloxacin ultimately showed no growth.

He was given a PICC line and sent to rehabilitation for
intravenous Oxacillin times a two week course.

4.  CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  The patient has a history of
coronary artery disease with coronary artery bypass graft,
diastolic dysfunction.  His aspirin was held given the bleed.
His beta blocker was also held given the bleed, however, it
was restarted on discharge to rehabilitation.

5.  RENAL:  The patient was admitted with a creatinine of
3.0, however, with intravenous fluids, creatinine improved
and ultimately he was discharged with a creatinine of 1.1,
below baseline.
