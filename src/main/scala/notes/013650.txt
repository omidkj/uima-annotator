History of Present Illness:
(Patient intubated, information from OSH records, verbal signout
and family): 33-year-old female with depression, morbid obesity,
history of hypertriglyceridemia (800s) diagnosed 4 years ago,
not treated who presents to OSH ([**Hospital3 **]) on [**2177-5-22**] with
1 day of severe abdominal pain after a fatty meal.

The abdominal pain is of sudden onset, generalized to the entire
abdomen, pain [**10-29**], associated with N/V. In OSH, she was found
to have a leukocytosis to [**Numeric Identifier **], lipase to [**Numeric Identifier 2249**], TG to 4500,
negative pregnancy test. Per report, the OSH abdominal CT with
diffuse inflammation, without necrosis or abscess (no films were
sent with the patient). She had "aggressive" IVF resuscitation,
given pravastatin, gemfibrozil, D10 and insulin gtt. Prior to
transfer, lipase down to 4000, TG 1300.

She was noted to have a metabolic acidosis with a bicarb that
has trended down to 10. Her Cr has trended up from 0.32 to 1.04.
She developed tachypnea with an ABG of 7.36/26/92 and was
intubated. Per report of CT, no clear evidence of lung pathology
other than pleural effusion. Other OSH issues, Ca < 5 on calcium
gluconate drip and albumin 2.1.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS: HR 148, BP 132/77, RR 39,
SvO2 100%. TV 600, RR set 24, FiO2 0.35. She is on versed drip
and is aggitated.

Review of systems: Unable to obtain due to intubation. Please
see OSH records.

STUDIES:
[**2177-5-24**] RUQ U/S:
1. Limited exam.  Normal gallbladder without gallstones.  No
intra- or extra-hepatic or pancreatic duct dilatation evident.

2. Hypoechoic pancreas consistent with pancreatitis.
3. Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration.  Other
forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease including
significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on
this study.

[**2177-5-25**] CT abd/pelvis:
1.  Enlarged pancreas with surrounding inflammatory changes and
surrounding free fluid consistent with acute pancreatitis.
While inhomogeneities are noted at the pancreatic head and
uncinate process, there is no evidence of definite necrosis or
hemorrhage at this time.
2.  Small-to-moderate amount of free fluid consistent with
ascites from
pancreatitis. This fluid is slightly higher in density than
simple fluid
suggestive of proteinaceous contents; however, hemorrhagic fluid
mixed in
cannot be excluded.
3.  Bilateral small pleural effusions.
4.  Atelectasis is noted in the lingula and an early developing
pneumonia
cannot be excluded.

[**2177-5-27**] CT head:
Subtle loss of grey-white matter differentiation, concerning for
early cerebral edema without acute intracranial hemorrhage or
major vascular territorial infarction.  If there is no clinical
improvement, MRI would be recommended for further evaluation.

[**2177-5-28**] MRA/MRV head:
1.  No evidence of cerebral edema, hemorrhage or infarction.
2.  Small lesion with slow diffusion in the splenium of the
corpus callosum is highly abnormal, but non-specific; this
finding has been termed "mild encephalopathy and reversible
splenial lesion syndrome" (MERS), which has been associated with
the clinical setting of seizure, antiepileptic drug
toxicity/withdrawal, encephalitis, metabolic disturbances and
malnutrition.
3.  Mild atherosclerotic disease within the M1 segment of the
left MCA, with otherwise, essentially normal MRI/MRA of the
brain.
4.  No evidence of cerebral v
