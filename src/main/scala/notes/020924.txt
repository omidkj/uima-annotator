Chief Complaint:
68 year old gentleman with DM and Parkinsons, was admitted with
infected L big toe ulcer

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Angiogram done on [**2151-5-11**]

ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:
1. Normal-appearing distal abdominal aorta with mild
    diffuse disease but no discrete stenosis or aneurysm.
2. Bilateral common iliac arteries had mild diffuse disease
    but were patent.
3. Bilateral hypogastric arteries were patent with diffuse
    disease.
4. Bilateral external iliac arteries were widely patent.
5. The left common femoral and profunda femoris artery was
    patent.
6. The left superficial femoral artery had some mild
    diffuse disease but was patent.
7. The above and below-knee popliteal artery was widely
    patent.
8. The anterior tibial artery was occluded and did not
    reconstitute.
9. The peroneal artery was occluded and did not
    reconstitute.
10.The posterior tibial artery was patent into the level of
    the mid calf where it occluded; however, there was a
    large collateral that went all the way down to the ankle
    and reconstituted the posterior tibial artery.


History of Present Illness:
68 year old gentleman with DM and Parkinsons, with ulcers in
both big toes was sent to the ED for infected L big toe. Was

He was transferred briefly to the ICU for an episode of
desaturation which was believed to be a mucus plug. His
troponins post episode was elevated. Troponin peaked at 0.43
ng/mL . He had a NSTEMI. They advised continued diuresis and
aspirin and simvastatin.

Angiogram was done on [**2151-5-11**]
L side: The anterior tibial artery and the peroneal artery was
occluded and did not reconstitute. The PT was occluded at the
level of the mid calf  and reconstituted at the ankle.

Cardiology was reconsulted  for preop clearance for was a
popliteal-posterior tibialis bypass. Cardiac cath was done which
showed two vessel disease.
Cardiac Catheterization:
Date:  [**2151-5-13**]   Place: [**Hospital1 18**]
LM- moderate disease
LAD- TO proximally, collaterals from RCA
LCx- 95% distal
OM1- multiple 70% lesions
RCA- 40%

Cardiac Echocardiogram:
[**2151-5-9**]
EF 30-35%
1+MR, mildly thickened MV leaflets


Cardiac surgery was consulted for coronary bypass prior to LE
bypass.

On [**2151-5-14**] he had multiple issues:
Elevated WBC: 16 Blood and urine cultures were sent
During the course of the day his mental status deteriorated was
becoming more somnolent. Speech and swallow was requested. He
was made NPO.
He went into afib which was being treated with Dilt boluses and
drip.
He acutely desaturated. Lots of secretions. Appeared that he was
not clearing his secretions. He was suctioned and we made
preparations to intubate him, however his sats were better. he
was [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 100322**] and sats were in the high 90s. He was
transferred to the unit for monitoring.

He had another epiode of desat and suctioning of a mucus plug in
the ICU. CXR showed. CXR [**5-14**] showed a L side white out. He as
intubated and bronched. There were thick copious secretions.
