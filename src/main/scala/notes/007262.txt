Attending:[**Last Name (un) 11974**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension post EP atrial tachycardia ablation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EP atrial tachycardia ablation

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 20756**] is a 58 y/o male who was admitted electively to the
PACU earlier today for EP ablation of Atrial Tachycardia and is
transfered post procedure to the CCU for ongoing hypotenension
and pressor dependence.
.
[**Hospital **] medical history is notable for  COPD on intermittent
home O2, non-ischemic CMP s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] procedure([**2178**]) for
congenital bicuspid aortic valve, aortic aneurysm s/p arch
replacement with reimplantation of RCA and closure of PFO
([**2188**]), s/p CRT-D ([**2192**], EF 25 -> 45-53% with CRT), AF s/p PVI
[**2194-3-25**], s/p DCCV [**2194-3-29**] repeated DCCV [**5-/2194**] and currently
NYHA class II-III heart failure in setting of persistent
Atrial-Tachycardias. Patient has had ongoing atrial tachycardias
with worsening exercise tolerance and lightheadesness and
presented today for a planned ablation under general anesthesia.

.
Procedure was prolonged (~10h), bil femoral veins were accessed,
no arteries,  3 foci were identified and ablated (one focus
floor of LA, second under left pulmonary vein, and 3rd which
induced a mitral anular flutter). Patient was subsequently in
sinus rythm. Patient became hypotensive immediately following
anasthesia induction for intubation and remained on neosynephrin
throughout the procedure. His home SBP's are lowish in the
80's-90's. During the procedure patient was sedated with versed
+ fentanyl and required neosynephrin throughout for hypotension.
He recieved 6L of NS and had UOP of 4L.  Intracardiac echo post
procedure no effusion. And post procedure Hct was stable. He
underwent extubation in the PACU and was started on Dopamin
which was uptitrated from 5 to 7.5 and allowed down titration of
neo from 1.3 to 1. He also recieved toradol 30mg for back pain.
He also recieved Ca 2g, Cefazolin 2gX2.  Post procedure Hct was
stable.
.
.
Currently patient feels comfortable, complains of fatigue and
ongoing mild back pain, otherwise no complaints.

Heart is moderately enlarged, lungs are clear and there is no
edema.  Minimal left pleural effusion or pleural thickening is
present.  No pneumothorax or mediastinal widening.  Transvenous
right atrial pacer and right ventricular pacer defibrillator
lead follow their expected courses.  The intended left
ventricular lead cannot be localized on frontal view but appears
to have several sharp turns.  Conventional radiography
recommended when feasible.

Brief Hospital Course:
58 y/o with PMH of COPD, non-ischemic CMP s/p procedures for
cong bicuspid AV([**2178**]), thoracic aortic aneurysm + PFO([**2188**]),
CRT-D ([**2192**], EF 25 -> 45-53% with CRT), AF s/p PVI 312 and
multiple subsequent DCCV's, more recently with worsening
functional level from worsening heart failure attributed to
persistent atrial tachycardia who was admitted electively for EP
ablation of three atrial tachycardia foci and was subsequently
admitted to CCU for persistent hypotension and pressor
requirement.

# s/p atrial tachycardia foci ablation X3: The patient was taken
for elective EP ablation of atrial tachycardia. Three atrial
tachycardic foci were susccessfully ablated. Post-procedure
course complicated but diffucult to extubate [**2-13**] COPD. He was
extubated in PACU sucessfully. He also required pressors
post-procedure. On arrival to CCU he was in sinus rythm.
Pressors were weaned within 24 hrs. His ASA was incresed to
325mg daily for one month. He was monitored on telemetry and
remained in sinus rhythm. Warfarrin dose held on HOD 2 secondary
to supratherapeutic INR. He was restarted on warfarrin at a dose
of 2.5 mg daily on day of discharge and instructed to follow up
in a few days to have INR rechecked.

# Hypotension: patient has baseline low SBP's in the 80's-90's,
became hypotensive after anasthesia induction. No evidence of
tamponade, bleeding, sepsis post procedure. Recieved fluids and
is urinating well. Initially on neo and dopamine and were weaned
off in 24 hours.
.
# Systolic Heart Failure: worsening functional class in the
setting of Afib and Atrial tachycardias. Initially ACE-I,
metoprolol, lasix, and metolazone held in setting of
hypotension.
