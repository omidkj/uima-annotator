Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1781**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from nursing home [**2-9**] hypoglycemia and unresponsiveness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2174-7-6**]- Angioplasty and stent of left external iliac artery.
[**2174-7-14**]- Right femoral to plantar artery bypass graft


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 80 year-old female with a past medical history
remarkable for DM type 2, chronic renal insufficiency (baseline
unknown), hypertension, and chronic anemia, brought to the ED
from  [**Hospital3 **] after being found unresponsive and
hypoglycemic.

Per report, the patient was found unresponsive this AM at 0545
at the nursing home. The blood sugar at that time was reportedly
23, and she was given 3 mg of Glucagon. EMS called, upon arrival
blood sugar 53. A peripheral IV was placed, and she was given 1
amp of D50 with rise in blood sugar to 309. The patient then
became awake and alert, and she was brought to the ED for
further evaluation. Per nursing home notes, she had a similar
episode of hypoglycemia the day prior, which was treated with
Glucagon.

In the ED, T 94.8, BP 240/108, HR 92, Sat 98% on room air. Blood
sugar stable. She was given HCTZ 12.5, Lasix 29, and Coreg 6.25.
On examination, she was noted to have bilateral foot ulcers, and
a right foot X-ray showed probable osteomyelitis, and received
Unasyn 1.5 gm IV. She is being admitted for further management.

Upon further questionning, Ms. [**Known lastname **] reports poor appetite over
the past few days. No URI symptoms, no chest pain, no SOB, no GI
or GU complaints. She notes that she has had the right heel
ulcer since [**Month (only) 958**], and does not recall previous therapy. + Pain,
no fever or chills.

Past Medical History:
1. Diabetes mellitus type 2, on Glipizide, with triopathy. Per
report, multiple prior episodes of hypoglycemia.
2. Hypertension
3. Congestive heart failure, EF unknown
4. Chronic renal insufficiency, baseline creatinine 2.3 in
[**4-/2174**]
5. Chronic anemia, with normocytic indices, Hct 36 in [**3-/2174**]
6. Peripheral neuropathy
7. Diabetic retinopathy and bilateral cataracts. She is legally
blind.

Social History:
She was previously in [**State 108**], and recently moved to [**Location (un) 86**] in
[**Month (only) 958**]. She has been at [**Hospital3 **] since [**Month (only) 958**]. She has 4
children in the area. She is a non-smoker, no EtOH, no illicit
drug use.


Family History:
Non-contributory.

Physical Exam:
Deceased

Pertinent Results:
On admission

EKG: NSR, normal axis, normal intervals, LVH by voltage criteria
with NSSTT changes. P pulmonale. No prior for comparison.

CXR [**2174-6-26**]: Increased thickening of septal lines, with
cardiomegaly, suggestive of chronic CHF. Markedly tortuous
aorta. Degenerative changes of the left shoulder, with previous
avascular
necrosis of the proximal humeral head.

[**2174-6-26**] Right foot X-ray: Bony alignment is satisfactory. No
fractures are identified. There is a soft tissue defect seen in
the lateral aspect of the calcaneus. There is a large amount of
associated soft tissue swelling. Additionally, the cortical
border of the calcaneus demonstrates loss of cortical uniformity
in that region, suggesting osteomyelitis in this region.

[**2174-6-27**] PVR/ABI: Pulse volume recording showed amplitudes of
35, 18, 14 and 7 mm in the right low thigh, calf, ankle and
metatarsal. On the left, these amplitudes were 24, 12, 7 and 15
mm.

Noninvasive measurement showed a systolic pressure of 157 mmHg
in the left brachial artery. The segmental limb pressure indices
dropped from 1.30 in the right distal thigh to 0.75 in the right
calf and _____ in the right ankle. On the left side, the index
was 0.73 in the distal thigh, 0.61 in the calf and 0.52 in the
dorsalis pedis artery.

CONCLUSION: Significant peripheral arterial obstructive disease,
starting at the aortobiiliac level, and likely associated with
superimposed bilateral infrapopliteal disease (left worse than
right).

[**2174-6-28**] RENAL U/S: Slightly echogenic kidneys, consistent with
medical disease. 4 mm nonobstructing stone within the left
kidney. Small simple cyst of the right kidney.

[**2174-6-28**] ECHO: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
moderate global hypokinesis. Mild mitral regurgitation. EF 35%.

[**2174-7-8**]

PMIBI

SUMMARY OF THE PRELIMINARY REPORT FROM THE EXERCISE LAB:

Dipyridamole was infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a dose
of 0.142
milligram/kilogram/min. Two minutes after the cessation of
infusion, Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m
sestamibi was administered IV.

The image quality is adequate. The left arm is suboptimally
positioned.
Left ventricular cavity size is normal.

Resting and stress perfusion images reveal normal tracer uptake
throughout the myocardium.

Gated images reveal mild global hypokinesis.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 48%.

IMPRESSION: Normal myocardial perfusion. Mild global hypokinesis
with LVEF 48%.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
80 year old woman with PVD, sepsis, ARF
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
acute cholecystitis in septic pt in icu. please place perc chole
tube
INDICATION: Septic patient with suspected cholecystitis
clinically and by ultrasound.

RADIOLOGISTS: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the attending
radiologist, was present for the entire procedure.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure, its indications, risk,
benefits and alternatives were discussed at length with the
patient's daughter-in-law, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 108119**]. Verbal consent was
obtained by telephone. A preprocedure timeout was performed. The
patient was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. 1% lidocaine
was used for local anesthesia.

Initial limited ultrasound of the right upper quadrant
demonstrated a distended gallbladder with wall thickening, as
seen in the formal right upper quadrant ultrasound earlier in
the day.

There was no active patient cooperation with the procedure, and
patient motion made the procedure more difficult. Ultrasound
guidance was used to place an 8- French [**Last Name (un) 2823**] catheter into
the gallbladder, yielding bilious fluid by aspiration. After
attempt at deployment of the catheter, there was irregular
return of fluid suggestive of malposition. A second attempt was
used using a TLA needle and guidewire. After successful
aspiration of fluid, there was difficulty deploying the wire
within the gallbladder lumen. A third attempt was made with a
single stick technique using an 8-French [**Last Name (un) 2823**] catheter. While
fluid was aspirated, this third attempt was also unsuccessful in
deployment of the catheter and the catheter coiled in adjacent
ascites.

Some of the bilious fluid was sent to the lab for analysis. The
technical challenges of this procedure including patient motion
and inability to keep the catheter deployed within the
gallbladder lumen were discussed with the surgical services
caring for the patient. At this time, it was decided to await
results of the fluid analysis and then clinically decide whether
additional intervention is needed. There were no immediate
complications to the procedure, although the patient's blood
pressure remained relatively low throughout the procedure.

IMPRESSION: Technically unsuccessful percutaneous
cholecystostomy placement under ultrasound guidance.

LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US

RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: The gallbladder is markedly
distended with wall thickening and edema. The wall gets very
thin at areas raising the possibility of wall necrosis. There is
sludge layering within the gallbladder. There is ascites and
pericholecystic fluid. There is a right- sided pleural effusion.

IMPRESSION:
