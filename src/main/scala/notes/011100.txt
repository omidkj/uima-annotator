History of Present Illness:
This is a 71 y/o male with a PMH of HTN, HL, NIDDM, EtOH abuse,
who sustained a fall on [**11-21**] with a C6/C7 fracture dislocation
with disruption of the anterior and posterior ligaments and cord
compression resulting in central cord syndrome who subsequently
underwent operative repair with posterior C3-T3 fusion and was
discharged to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2170-12-8**]. He was then re-admitted
to the medicine service from [**Date range (1) 71518**] for a wound dehiscence
requiring debridement in the OR. The wound deep tissue cultures
grew MSSA and he was started on Nafcillin on [**2170-12-31**] and
discharged to [**Hospital1 **] on [**1-1**] for a planned [**7-14**] week course
of Nafcillin. He was doing well at [**Hospital1 **] until Tuesday, when
he was noted to develop malaise, dizziness, fevers/chills, as
well as a diffuse erythematous, non-pruritic, papular rash. His
creatinine was also noted to rise from 1.7 to 2.5. His nafcillin
was changed to vancomycin at rehab, as it was presumed that the
rash was drug-related. Yesterday, he was
febrile to 104.6 and hypotensive to 80's/30's at rehab and found
to have worsening renal function with a dirty u/a and
hyponatremia of 119. He was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED on
[**2171-1-9**] for further evaluation. In the ED, code sepsis was
initiated and he was given 8 L NS total with 2 U PRBCs for
anemia. In addition, he was given doses of Vancomycin, flagyl,
levofloxacin, and clindamycin. He was also given decadron 4 mg x
1 last night for concern of cord compression. Neurology, ID, and
renal were all consulted.
.
Currently, pt feels cold, but denies any other current c/o.

Micro:

other micro NGTD
.
[**1-10**] CXR - There is a new left subclavian central venous catheter

terminating in the lower SVC.  Cervical fusion hardware is again
noted.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes appear stable.
There is stable vascular congestion, without frank edema.
.
[**1-10**] MRI - Deformities attributable to the previous fracture
dislocation at C6-C7 and subsequent posterior fusion and
fixation construct extending to T3 are noted. On today's study,
there appears to be less separation from C7 to T1 than there was
on the patient's CT scan of [**2170-12-3**].  There is no definite
evidence of
epidural mass or cord compression.  Again is noted the remote
compression deformity of L1.  There is some increased signal
within the disc space on both T1 and T2 sequences, but not on
the STIR sequence at T10-T11.  Paravertebral material appears to
correspond to calcified material noted on the patient's CT scan
and probably reflect osteophytic spurring plus diffuse
idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis.  There is no definite evidence
of discitis.
.
[**1-10**] Renal u/s - The right kidney measures 12.3 cm.
Visualization of the upper pole of the left kidney is limited.
The left kidney measures approximately 11 cm.  There is no
hydronephrosis.  No renal stones or masses are identified.  The
bladder is not distended.
.
[**1-11**] Echo: The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent
with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. There
is focal fibro-calcific change seen on the left coronary cusp.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION:
No valvular vegetations seen. If clinically indicated, a TEE
would
be better to exclude a small valvular vegetation.
.
[**1-18**]: renal u/s: no hydronephrosis
.
[**1-16**]: CT chest/abd/pelvis: 1. Bilateral simple pleural effusions
(right slightly greater than left) with underlying
atelectasis/collapse of left and right lower lobes.
2. Patchy multifocal opacities within the right upper lobe with
areas of interstitial septal thickening. Differential includes
areas of atelectasis or early multifocal pneumonia. Pulmonary
edema is felt to be less likely given the asymmetry.
3. Diffuse abdominal and pelvic ascites with slightly nodular
liver contour which may suggest underlying cirrhosis.
4. Cholelithiasis, without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
5. Diffuse coronary and vascular calcifications.
6. No evidence of bowel obstruction or wall thickening. Distal
colonic air fluid level may suggest an early enteritis.
