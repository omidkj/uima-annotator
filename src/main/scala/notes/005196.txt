CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2147-1-17**] 3:49 PM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: s/p ct d/c

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
60 year old man with
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
s/p ct d/c
HISTORY: Status post removal of chest tube.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**1-13**], there has been
removal of the endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, mediastinal
drains, and Swan-Ganz catheter. The left chest tube has been
removed and there is no evidence of pneumothorax. Elevation of
the left hemidiaphragm persists as does some atelectatic change
at the left base.

Sternal sutures remain in place and without fracture.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection velocity.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal interatrial septum. No
ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Moderately dilated LV
cavity. Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. Simple
atheroma in aortic arch. Normal descending aorta diameter.
Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Severely
thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets. Severe AS (AoVA
<0.8cm2). Moderate (2+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Trivial
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with physiologic PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient.
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
1. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%) with noted
inferior wall hypokinesis from the mid-papillary level to apex.
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic
valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen.

POST-BYPASS:
I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 60 y.o male who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] on [**1-11**] for cardiac catheterization and an echo that
revealed an EF of 55%, LM: 60-70%, LAD 30%, LCX:50% RCA:30%, [**Location (un) 109**]
0.77 with peak 50. He was then referred for cardiac surgery. On
[**1-13**] he was brought to the operating room and underwent AVR
(25mm Porcine) and CABGX3 (LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM, SVG-PDA). He
received 48 hours of perioperative Vancomycin because he was
inpatient prior to his surgery. He was brought to the intensive
care unit in stable condition for recovery. He did well during
the immediate post-operative period. His anesthesia was reversed
and he remained on precedex for his ventilatory wean until POD1
when he was extubated. On POD 1 he had a self limited epi
