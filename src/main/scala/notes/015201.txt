History of Present Illness:
81 y/o male with PMHx significant for PE (on coumadin), PAF,
dialated cmy (LVEF 55%), valvular heart disease who presents to
the ED with decline in mental status since thoracentesis for
recurrent L pleural effusion 1 month prior ([**2112-4-8**]). Patient has
been lethargic and confused. Per OMR report his wife has noticed
patient has had melena and increased urinary frequency and
incontinence also with sob,
swollen legs, and intermittently confused. In the ED patient was
found to have Hct of 12.5 and INR of 22. He did have melanotic

IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute intracranial pathology,
including no sign of intracranial hemorrhage.
Note added at attending review: There is a region of hypodensity
in the left cerebellar hemisphere suggesting an acute to
subacute superior cerebellar artery distribution infarction. The
region is too well defined and hypodense to represent a
hyperacute infarction, such as a few hours old. At that stage,
infarctions are typically difficult to see at all on CT, and if
visible present faint [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter hypodensity or swelling. There
is no evidence of hemorrhage. This revised finding was discussed
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at 9:15 am on [**2112-5-12**].

IMPRESSION:
1.  Evolving left superior cerebellar artery territory infarct

There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
2.  Unremarkable CTA examinations of the head and neck.
Specifically, the
superior cerebellar arteries are present bilaterally and grossly
unremarkable.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 33344**] is an 81 year old male with PMHx significant for PE
(on coumadin), afib, dialated cardiomyopathy (LVEF 55%),
valvular heart disease who presents to the ED with GIB in the
setting of supratherapeutic INR (22). He had a brief stay in the
MICU until his HCT was stable and then transferred to the
medical floor.  His course was complicated by a cerebellar
stroke. The hospital course is described below by problem.
.
## Anemia - He presented with a HCT of 12.5 and confusion for
some time per his family and melana.  Given the melana, this was
thought to most likely be a upper GI bleed secondary to
supratheraputic INR (22 on admission). His INR was reversed with
vitamin K and 4 units of FFP.  He received a total of 10 units
of PRBC as well.  An EGD was performed which showed only mild
gastritis and no active bleeding.  A colonoscopy showed moderate
diverticulosis but also no signs of active bleeding. A benign
appearing polyp was also removed.  His HCT remained stable over
several days.
.
## Stroke - The night of his colonoscopy, he was found to be
unresponsive and flacid.  His vital signs were stable.  A head
CT was done and a neurology consult was obtained. The CT scan
showed a left superior cerebellar stroke which they felt was
subacute.  The next morning he had a brief episode of slurred
speech and left sided weakness when the neurology consult team
was in the room.  These symptoms resolved by the time the
medical team arrived.  He was sent for a head CT and CTA which
showed a patent cerbellar vasculature, but persistent cerbellar
stroke.  He likely is having embolic events from his a fib and
lack of anticoagulation given his severe GI bleed.  He was put
back on anticoagulation with lovenox and coumadin.  He will need
lovenox until his INR is therapeutic for 2 days (therapeutic for
the first time [**2112-5-20**]).
.
## CHF - He had a LVEF of 55% on last echo in [**2110**].  He was
mildly fluid overloaded during admission. His beta blocker was
held given his hypotension on admission and his GI bleed.  It
was restarted briefly once his HCT was stable, but hel
