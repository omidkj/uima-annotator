History of Present Illness:
38 year old obese female with HTN, sleep apnea, G1P1 s/p
c-section 5 days ago, presented to OSH with acute SOB,
tachypnea, and HTN. Was d/c'd [**11-1**] from [**Hospital1 34**] following Caesarean
birth which was induced at 38 weeks for HTN. Has h/o untreated
HTN prior to pregnancy, unknown baseline BP, but noted to have
SBP to 178/110 in [**3-20**]. Was started on Labetalol for the
duration of her pregnancy with BPs 140-180/90-110. At home on
the night of d/c ([**11-1**]), noted some orthopnea and did not
tolerate her usual CPAP, stating that the positive pressure made
her uncomfortable. Awoke this morning with acute SOB described
as severe dyspnea on minimal exertion, and knew something was
wrong, so presented to [**Hospital3 **] ED.
In [**Hospital1 **] ED, CXR, CT, EKG were done. Initial VS were 82% on NRB
with BP 183/104. She was placed on BiPAP, given 6 g of Mg, 20 mg
IV labetalol, nitro 2 tabs PO then nitro gtt at 80 mcg/min. EKG
was sinus tach. Trop was < 0.01, CK 145, MB 4.5, BNP 1178, ABG
7.46/37/163 on NRB. Initial CT read was no evidence of PE,
diffuse groundglass infiltrates bilaterally representing
cardiogenic or non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, small pleural
effusions. She was given 40 mg IV lasix and transferred by med
flight to [**Hospital1 18**] for hypertensive urgency and concern for flash
pulmonary edema.
At [**Hospital1 18**], initial vitals were: 110 162/94 25 90% on RA. She had
5.3L of urine output and was placed on nasal cannula. Received
levofloxacin 750mg IV. TTE in the ED was normal but showed LVH.
Vitals prior to transfer were: 98.8 78 153/67 26 98% on 2L NC.
On the floor, initial vital signs were 179/88, HR 92 on nitro
drip.
.
Review of systems is otherwise negative, including chest pain,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fevers, chills, myalgias,
rhinorrhea.

CXR ([**2169-11-2**]):
Cardiac size is top normal. Hilar and mediastinal contours
appear
normal. Patchy airspace opacities in the lung bases bilaterally
are similar  to the prior study. Multifocal opacities in the
right upper lobe, bilateral lower lobes and right upper lobe
seen on prior CT are not clearly visualized on the current
study. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The pulmonary
vasculature is not engorged.
IMPRESSION:
Bibasilar lung opacities, likely represent multifocal pneumonia.


TTE ([**2169-11-2**]):
The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and
arch levels are normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets
cannot be determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal global systolic function.
.
EKG ([**2169-11-2**]): normal sinus rhythm.

Brief Hospital Course:
38 year old obese female with HTN, sleep apnea, G1P1 s/p
c-section 5 days prior to admission, presented to OSH with acute
SOB, tachypnea, and HTN and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ICU for
BP management.
.
#. Hypertension: H/O HTN prior to pregnancy on meds, self d/c'd.
Found to be hypertensive to SBP 180s on initial OB visits,
maintained on Labetalol throughout pregnancy with consistently
elevated BPs throughout. Primary HTN is most likely etiology in
this obese patient with a family h/o HTN. Other possibilities
include a component of gestational HTN. Unlikely to be secondary
HTN. Admitted on nitro drip from OSH and [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
Maintained on IV labetalol (total 20 mg IV) and IV hydralazine
(total 30 mg IV) overnight, with SBPs to 150s/70s.  Changed on
[**11-3**] to PO HCTZ 25 mg daily and PO nifedipine 30 mg daily, goal
to titrate to SBP 140-160.  D/c'd labetalol as she seemed to
have minimal response to this med throughout her pregnancy (per
OSH records) and here.  There was concern that HC
