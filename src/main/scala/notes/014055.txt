Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
seizure, vomiting, inability to protect airways, intubation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Mechanical Intubation and Ventilation
Hemodialysis
Exchange of Catheter of [**First Name3 (LF) **] Line


History of Present Illness:
61-year-old man with ESRD on [**First Name3 (LF) 2286**] MWF, liver disease,
seizure disorder presented from [**Hospital3 **] facility with
2-3 days of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting. Norovirus has been
affected his co-residents.
.
In the ED, initial VS: T 98.8, HR 97, BP 218/127, RR 16, 98%RA.
Patient initially "did not communicate much," raising concerns
for hypertensive encephalopathy or active seizure. He then
seized x 30 seconds, became alert again, but then vomited
profusely and was intubated for airway protection. His head CT
was unremarkable. CXR was unremarkable. He then spiked to
100.6F. Had a few more loose stools in ED. Was briefly on
nicardipine gtt, but once on propofol for the intubation, his BP
dropped and nicardipine was d/c'ed. CXR negative. Was given
ceftriaxone 1 gm x 2, vanco 1 gm x 1, acyclovir 800 mg IV x 1.
By the time of transfer to MICU, T 98.0, HR 95, BP 180/91.
.
[**Hospital3 **]: not obtained due to patient being intubated

Dilantin 200 mg [**Hospital1 **].

Social History:
Lives at [**Hospital3 **] facility on Mission [**Doctor Last Name **] called
[**Hospital1 **] at [**Hospital1 1426**]; the facility, per his son does not help
him take medications or provide any other care besides ensuring
that the patient has 3 meals per day and that he is accounted
for on a daily basis. He is on disability, has two sons. Smokes
1ppd x 40 yrs, no Etoh, no drugs.


Family History:
Mother died of breast cancer. Father has coronary artery disease
and congestive heart failure, alive at [**Age over 90 **] yo. Two sons are
healthy.


Physical Exam:
Lungs: CTAB
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs,
gallops
Abdomen: soft, mildly distended, bowel sounds
present
Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, No edema. Right and L sided

fistula with palpable pulses, L subclavian tunnelled line C/D/I



Pertinent Results:
Imaging
Head CT [**2140-4-6**]: No acute intracranial process.
.
CXR [**2140-4-6**]: An endotracheal tube tip terminates 4.5 cm from
the carina. NG tube extends into the stomach. A [**Month/Day/Year 2286**]
catheter tip lies within the proximal right atrium. The lung
volumes are low, with accentuation of the cardiomediastinal and
hilar contours. The heart is normal in size, with a mildly
unfolded aorta. There is a right hilar opacity, which appears
new from the prior study. Known right lower lobe pulmonary
nodule is better appreciated on prior CTs. The lungs are
otherwise clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION:
1. Endotracheal tube tip 4.5 cm above the carina.
2. Right hilar opacity, may reflect adenopathy.
3. Known pulmonary nodules are better assessed on recent CT.
.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] [**2140-4-9**]
FINDINGS:
There is no evidence for acute ischemia. Extensive supra- and
infratentorial volume loss is seen with presumed small vessel
ischemic changes in the subcortical white matter. Appearance is
stable compared to the previous MRI.  Bilateral mastoid
opacification is noted. Intracranial flow voids are maintained.
There is a stable small slit-like encephalomalacia in the left
inferior basal ganglion which likely represents an old small
slit hypertensive hemorrhage.  There are unchanged
susceptibility focii in the left temporal and right occipetal
lobe which may represent remote microhemorrhage or amyloid
angiopathy.
IMPRESSION:
No acute ischemia. Stable supra- and infratentorial volume loss
and presumed small vessel ischemic changes.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 93850**] is a 61-year-old man with ESRD on [**Known lastname 2286**], liver
disease, and seizure disorder who presented from [**Hospital3 **]
facility with 2-3 days of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting.
.
Airway Protection: Following the seizure he had several episodes
of emesis and was unable to protect his airway. He was
intubated. He was extubated the following day.
.
# Seizures: Mr. [**Known lastname 93850**] had a seizure while in the ED. Following
the seizure he had several episodes of emesis and was unable to
protect his airway. He was intubated. In the MICU neurology was
consulted and recommended continuing him on his home dose of
lamotrigine, phenytoin, and levetiracetam. An MRI of the head
was done per neurology which showed no acute ischemia and stable
supra- and infratentorial volume loss.  He remains on the same
dose of keppra and dilantin, and will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**],
his neurologist.
.
# Acute diarrhea, nausea, vomiting: Likely norovirus given an
outbreak at his living facility. His diarrhea stopped during his
MICU stay. He had no more episodes of emesis. He was able to
tolerate a regular diet.
.
# Hypertension: SBP was over 200 in ED. He required a
nicardipine gtt for a period of time. He was continued on a
clonidine patch, lisinopril, and an increased
