History of Present Illness:
70yoF with h/o influenza A infection c/b ARDS s/p trach, afib,
and tracheocutaneous fistula now presents with hypotension and
fever.
Pts initially presented to [**Hospital6 **] in [**4-10**] with
influenza A infection complicated by ARDS and prolonged
ventilator course requiring tracheostomy and was discharged to
[**Hospital1 **] with tracheostomy tube but off ventilatory support. She
returned with hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring
mechanical ventilation through ET tube. She was found to have a
LLL PNA, paroxysmal rapid AFib (hr 180s) and pneumomediastinum,
upper esophageal dilatation, and UTI. She underwent bronchoscopy
which was apparently unremarkable, and was treated empirically
with vancomycin and ceftazidime for pneumonia, and flagyl (for
diarrhea). Her course had been complicated by hypotension
requiring levophed and rapid AFib for which chemical
cardioversion was attempted unsuccessfully with ibutilide.
Cultures revealed MRSA PNA/bacteremia, and pseudomonas UTI, and
treatment was initiated with vancomycin and zosyn.
    She was then admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**5-30**] after short stay at OSH
for workup of pneumomediastinum. Bronch at OSH revealed no
defects in the
tracheal wall, and an esophageal gastrograffin study was
negative as well.  Multiple imaging studies did not reveal any
pneumomediastinum. Repeat EGD/Rigid bronchoscopy did not show
any TE fistula, but the evidence for pneumomediastinum is that
respiratory symptoms (hypercarbic failure) and AF with RVR
became worse when ET tube was in higher position, and resolved
when ET tube was repositioned lower, presumably below the site
of a fistula. Her tracheostomy was revised and she had no
recurrence of afib with RVR. The may many attempts for pressure
support wean unsuccessfully so PEG was placed and she was
discharged to a chronic vent facility. Of noted she was also
found to be Cdiff positive and completed a 14 day course of
flagyl on [**6-20**] as well as a 2 week for ciprfloxacin for
sensitive pseudomonal UTI.
    At rehab, the patient was noted to be hypotensive and
tachycardic aafter blood transfusion last night. Of not she also
recently had increasing thick secretions suctioned from trach.
She was being treated with Linizolid for MRSA line sepsis
changed to vancomycin [**7-24**] and Imipenem for GNR in urine and
possible urosepsis, as well as PO vancomycin for potential
resistent C.diff. She was given 600cc bolus with minimal
improvement and was given another 1L NS en route to hospital. In
ED here she was febrile to 102 and persistently hypotensive
despite wide open fluids so levophed was initiated. She
transiently had HR of 150 and SBP in 200's requiring them to
hold levophed. In total she received 5 L total of NS in ED and
was given a dose of levofloxacin for suspected sepsis.

CXR-IMPRESSION:  Right-sided central line is seen with tip
overlying SVC.  Poorly defined opacity is seen in the left mid
lung, appears more apparent on current study, possibly
representing focal consolidation.
Evidence of increased mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema
superimposed on chronic edema or chronic interstitial lung
abnormalities.

CT chest [**7-26**]:
The previously demonstrated pneumomediastinum has been
completely resolved. The mediastinal lymph nodes are markedly
enlarged measuring 13 mm in the right supracarinal area instead
of 8 mm. The aorta is dilated measuring up to 4.5 cm in the
ascending part unchanged. The density of the blood in the
cardiac [**Doctor Last Name 1754**] is diminished, suggesting anemia. The heart
size is enlarged with no pericardial effusion. Esophagus is
dilated predominantly in its proximal part with air-fluid level
suggesting esophagitis.

Bilateral pleural effusions are slightly increased. The
bilateral widespread consolidations with prominent most probably
infectious bronchiectasis are slightly diminished, especially in
lower lobes and in left upper lobe.

The ET tube tip is 3 cm above the carina. The tip of the right
and left central venous lines are at the level of cavoatrial
junction.

The images of the upper abdomen demonstrate normal liver,
spleen, kidneys and pancreas. Gallbladder with no evidence of
acute cholecystitis is unchanged. The patient has prominent
prominent subcutaneous fat stranding, most probably due to
hypoalbuminemia.

IMPRESSION:

1. Slight improvement of bilateral consolidation representing
ARDS or widespread infection.

2. Mild increase in bilateral pleural effusions.

3. Cardiomegaly.

4. Anemia.

5. Gallbladder with no evidence of cholecystitis.

6. Status post feeding gastrostomy insertion

Echo [**2130-7-27**]:
1. The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed.
3. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
5. No aortic dissection is seen up to 40 cm of probe insertion.
