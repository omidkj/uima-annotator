History of Present Illness:
CC - abdominal pain
.
HPI - This is a 29 y/o male with a complicated onc history -
diagnosed with AML in [**2169**] s/p [**Year (4 digits) 3242**] in [**4-/2170**] with failed
complete remission and subsequent remission in [**2170**]. He was
treated with multiple chemo regimens and had a cell boost in
3/[**2171**]. His clinical course was complicated by GVHD involving
the GI tract and liver, and is on multiple immunosuppresants.
The patient reports that he has had severe, [**9-28**] abdominal pain
beginning earlier today, presenting as a "tight band acoss his
abdomen and constipation pain." His last BM was earlier the
morning of admission and was [**12-22**] diarrhea and [**12-22**] constipation -
normally he has just diarrhea. [**1-23**] nights ago, he had a large
meal his mother cooked and had severe diarrhea following this,
so he took Immodium and increased his narcotics dose.
Denies any fevers, nausea or vomiting. He was seen by his
primary oncologist today who referred him to the ED. CT of the
abd/pelvis in the ED confirmed a large amount of stool in the
colol with fecalization of the small bowel and ?colitis. Was
given Levo and Flagyl in the ED. Seen by surgery, who are
following with serial abd exams and recommend IVF, NPO, and abx.



Past Medical History:
PMH - AML diagnosed in [**12/2169**] with a white blood cell count of
130,000. He was shown by immunophenotyping to have biclonal
leukemia. Cytogenetics revealed multiple abnormalities including
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5622**] chromosome 9:22 translocation. This was initially
treated on an ALL regimen and then received multiple
chemotherapy regimens including ALL and AML-based regimens
finally responding to hyper CVAD regimen. He had achieved
partial remission but never complete remission. At the time of
his transplant in [**4-/2170**], he had still not achieved complete
remission. His former blood type was B positive and he was CMV
positive. His donor transplant course was complicated by grade 1
graft versus host disease of the skin which resolved with
steroids. He had some relapse of his disease in [**7-/2171**] and was
treated with multiple chemo regimens including hyper CVAD and
did respond. He underwent a stem cell boost in [**2-/2172**] with
clinical remission since. He has had continued graft versus host
disease of the liver. He has been on multiple immunosuppressants
including Neoral, CellCept, and prednisone. He had a liver
biopsy in the past, which revealed graft versus host disease of
the liver. He has also had an acidosis in the past relating to
cyclosporine and was on oral sodium bicarbonate in the past. He
has had a perianal fistula/abscess in [**6-/2172**] that responded to
antibiotics. He has had coag-negative staph bacteremia in the
past as well in the setting of a line-associated infection that
was treated with daptomycin on an extended basis. He has had
several blood cultures in early [**Month (only) 216**], which were no growth to
date. His most recent bone marrow biopsy was [**2172-8-31**] , which
did not reveal any evidence of leukemia and showed normal
trilineage hematopoiesis.

Social History:
He is not working.  He is not married.  He has a significant
other.  He has no children.  He does not smoke tobacco or drink

Brief Hospital Course:
He initially presented to this hospital on [**2172-10-30**] with severe,
[**9-28**] abdominal pain beginning that day, presenting as a "tight
band acoss his abdomen and constipation pain." CT of the
abd/pelvis done on the day of admission confirmed a large amount
of stool in the colon with fecalization of the small bowel and
?colitis. The patient given Levo and Flagyl in the ED. He was
seen by surgery, who are following with serial abd exams and
recommended IVF, NPO, and abx. He was started on Zosyn for
possible colitis. He was also noted to be in acute renal failure
with a creatinine of 2.4 up from a baseline of 1.2. This was
thought to be pre-renal and the patient was started on fluids.
He had a transaminitis that was stable but his bilirubin was 24
which is up from 22 and alkaline phosphatase that was also
significantly elevated.
.
Patient was continued on prophylactic acyclovir. He was
continued on voriconazole, started in [**1-25**] for treatment of lung
nodules presumed to be fungal. Of note galactomannin was
negative. The lung nodules have resolved on voriconazole. He is
also getting inhaled pentamidine for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**]. He was
continued on cellcept, solumedrol and cyclosporin as well as
photophoresis.
.
During this admission patient developed progressively worsening
LFTs and encephalopathy. He has also developed vomiting. An NG
tube was placed [**11-1**] with return of 600 cc of brown liquid.
Imaging was been consistent with a partial small bowel
obstruction. Patient removed NGT which was complicated by
prolonged epistaxis. He was subsequently was found to have a
large hematoma in the oropharyx. His hospital stay has been
complicated by elevated INR (likely from liver dysfunction)
requiring FFP and vitamin K.
.
Due to worsening LFTs, patient underwent a liver ultrasound to
rule out portal vein thrombosis which showed no thrombosis.
Patient developed worsening renal failure with urine sodium >
20, thus not consistent with HRS. Voriconazole was stopped due
to progressive liver failure. Liver failure was thought to be
due to cyclosporine toxicity vs GVHD. Patient underwent
photopheresis on [**11-3**]. Patient has been guiac positive from
above and below. He was seen by ID who recommended stopping
zosyn due to thro
