History of Present Illness:
84M s/p revision of R TKA on [**6-13**] who
originally presented to [**Hospital3 **] from rehab with h/o MS
changes. At the time of admission, he was unable to clearly
answer questions, and was febrile to 101. A CXR revealed a LLL
infiltrate and the patient was started on levaquin and
vancomycin.
The patient had a troponin on his admission of 0.04 and
subsequent labs demonstrated a trop of 1.38, with an eventual
peak of 1.65 (CK247, CK/MB 3.1). His mentas status improved and
he underwent nuclear imaging with a fixed inferior-posterior
hypokineesis. Cardiac cath was performed showing three vessel
disease and the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation.

ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2113-6-21**] Mr. [**Known lastname 37806**] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation
of coronary revascularization. At the OSH he had been started on
Vancomycin and Levoquin for a Left lower lobe pneumonia. Once at
the [**Hospital1 18**] preoperative workup included TTE/Carotid US and Chest
ct scan as well as standard PATS. Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 7111**], the orthopeadic
surgeon from [**Hospital3 **] that performed Mr.[**Known lastname 81874**] total
right hip revision on [**6-13**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] for recommendations
regarding postoperative care precautions to protect hip
dislocation. In house orthopedics was consulted as well.
His original OR date was post poned due to elevated creat which
peaked at 1.9 and decraesed to 1.6 on [**2113-6-30**].  On [**2113-6-30**] he
was taken to the operating room and underwent Coronary artery
bypass grafting x3 left internal mammary artery graft to left
anterior descending and reversed saphenous vein graft to the
posterior descending artery and the first marginal branch (see
operative note for details).
Immediately post-operatively he was admitted to the ICU
intubated and sedated. He was weaned from sedation and extubated
without difficulty. His chestubes and pacing wires wwere removed
per protocol. He was started on baetablocker, statin and
diuretic and transferred to the stepdown unit on POD #2. His
coumadin was resumed for afib. His voice quality was hoarse and
he was scoped at the bedise by ENT and found to have normal
vocal cord quality and movement. Hoarse speech felt to be
related to inability to take a deep breath due to discomfort-
pain medication adjusted. He was evaluated by physical therapy
for strength and conditioning and rehab was recommended. He was
cleared for discharge to [**Hospital 582**] rehab [**Location (un) **] on POD#4 and
all appointments and instructions were advised.


Medications on Admission:
Tylenol 650prn, Amlodipine 10', O
