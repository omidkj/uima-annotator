Physical Exam:
Admit PE:
vitals - bp 138-149/70-74, hr 64
general - elderly male in no acute distress
skin - multiple nevi
heent - oropharynx benign, PERRL, sclera anicteric
neck - supple, no JVD, no carotid bruits
chest - lungs clear bilaterally
heart - regular rate and rhythm, normal s1s2, no murmur
abd - benign
ext - warm, no edema
neuro - nonfocal
pulses - 2+ distally bilaterally

Pertinent Results:
[**2118-9-1**] TTE:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with distal septal hypokinesis.
The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 50%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic
valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2118-9-1**] Carotid:
Mild calcified plaques in the common and internal carotid
arteries bilaterally with less than 40% stenosis on both sides.
[**2118-9-2**] Intraop TEE:
PREBYPASS
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. No thrombus is
seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect of
PFO is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with hypokinesis seen in inferioseptal and septal walls.
3. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma
in the aortic arch. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly
dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta.
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is
mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2).
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**12-8**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
POSTBYPASS
1. Patient is on phenylephrine and epinephrine infusions
2. Left ventricular function is improved. EF 55%. Inferioseptal
and septal walls are improved but patient is on inotropes.
3. Right ventricular functions is improved, although on inotrope
infusion.
4. Aortic contour is smooth after decannulation.

CAROTID U/S
IMPRESSION: Mild calcified plaques in the common and internal
carotid
arteries bilaterally with less than 40% stenosis on both sides.
This is a
baseline examination at the [**Hospital1 18**].

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 6339**] was admitted to the cardiac surgical service and
underwent routine preoperative testing which included carotid
ultrasound, and echocardiogram - see result section. He remained
stable on intravenous Heparin. Workup was unremarkable and he
was cleared for surgery. On [**9-2**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
performed coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. For surgical
details, please see operative report. Following the operation,
he was brought to the CVICU for invasive monitoring. Within 24
hours, he awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without
incident. Low dose beta blockade, lasix, Plavix and Warfarin
were resumed. He maintained stable hemodynamics and transferred
to the SDU on postoperative day one.  Physical therapy worked
with him on strength and mobility.  He was ready for discharge
home with VNA and physical therapy post operative day 4.
