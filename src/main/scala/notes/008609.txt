Pertinent Results:
[**2149-3-22**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is hyperdensity within
the right temporal lobe, likely intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Hyperdense extra- axial collection along the left parietal and
left temporo- occipital convexity consistent with subdural
hematoma. A small hyperdensity within the left cerebellum
consistent may represent subarachnoid or intraparenchymal
hemorrhage. There is a 12 x 6 mm hyperdense focus within the
interhemispheric fissure and hyperdense foci in the left frontal
lobe sulci consistent with subarachnoid hemorrhage.

There is no mass lesion, or shift of normally midline
structures. Prominence of the sulci and ventricles are
consistent with age-related atrophy.

Extensive soft tissue swelling overlying the left frontal lobe,
and periorbital area. There is no evidence of fracture. The
visualized paranasal sinuses are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple areas of subarachnoid, likely right temporal
intraparenchymal, and subdural hemorrhage as described above.
2. Soft tissue injury without fracture.

[**2149-3-22**] CT OF THE CERVICAL SPINE

No acute fracture or malaligment. There is hyperlordosis of the
cervical spine. No soft tissue swelling is present. Regions of
hemorrhagic contusion and left sided subdural hemorrhage are
better appreciated on concurrent head CT. Atherosclerotic
calcifications noted within the cavernous portions of the
carotid vessels bilaterally.

IMPRESSION:

No evidence of acute fracture or malalignment.

[**2149-3-24**] CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE

Reason: SYNCOPAL EPISODE

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
82 year old woman with question of syncopal episode
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please evaluate bilateral carotids for signs of stenosis
INDICATION OF THE EXAM: This is an 82-year-old woman with
syncopal episode.

RADIOLOGISTS: The exam was read by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 15785**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 4686**].

TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: Extracranial evaluation of bilateral
carotids was performed with B-mode, color, and spectral Doppler
ultrasound modes.

On grayscale evaluation, there is mild amount of calcified
plaque within bilateral internal carotid arteries.

On the right, peak systolic velocities are 87, 44, and 62 cm/sec
in the internal, common, and external carotid arteries
respectively. The right ICA to CCA ratio is 1.9.

On the left, peak systolic velocities are 67, 63, and 42 cm/sec
in internal, common, and external carotid arteries respectively.
The left ICA to CCA ratio is 1.1.

The right vertebral artery presented with no color flow Doppler
detected.

The left vertebral artery presented antegrade flow.

COMPARISON: None available.

IMPRESSION:
1. There is less than 40% stenosis within bilateral internal
carotid arteries.
2. Right vertebral artery with no color flow on Doppler
detected, compatible with occlusion.

Findings
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2148-10-21**].
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size. Mild
regional LV systolic dysfunction. No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR. No
MVP. Mild mitral annular calcification.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild to
moderate [[**1-1**]+] TR. Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Patient was unable to cooperate with
maneuvers. Suboptimal image quality as the patient was difficult
to position. Suboptimal image quality - patient unable to
cooperate. MD caring for the patient was notified of the
echocardiographic results by e-mail.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal
hypokinesis of the distal septum and anterior wall and apex. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 45 %). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present.No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2148-10-21**],
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction is now identified
and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is much
higher.
These findings are c/w interim myocardial ischemia and/or acute
pulmonary process (e.g., pulmonary embolism).

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2148**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical
