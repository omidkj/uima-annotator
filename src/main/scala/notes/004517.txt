Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:

History of Present Illness:
80 yo man with from h/o CHF, HTN, afib, h/o DVT, on coumadin who
presented to OSH with 1 day history of R flank pain and dysuria,
found to have renal stone.  Pt reports dysuria and hematuria 1
week ago; he was treated with a short course of an unknown abx
with resolution.  OSH renal ultrasound on [**2135-5-5**] was negative
per wife.  His coumadin was also held initially, then restarted.
 However, patient woke up yesterday ([**2135-5-6**]) with acute onset
of [**10-23**] R flank pain.  He also had dysuria, gross hematuria,
chills, and significant fatigue.  His coumadin was once again
held yesterday.  He presented to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital where he was
febrile to 102.4.  CT abdomen showed a 7mm stone a R UPJ
junction.  UA was c/w infection.  He received ceftriaxone.
Patient was also given dilaudid and dropped his SBP to 80s.  He
was given 2500cc NS with BP recovery to 120s.  He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In our ED, initial vs were: T 99.3, P 118, BP 109/63, RR 16,
O2sat 94% 2L.  Patient was given Azithromycin 500mg IV x 1 (for
PNA coverage), and Gentamycin 80mg IV x 1.  Urology was
consulted and recommended perc nephrostomy.  IR consulted and
agreed to take pt this afternoon for perc nephrostomy.
Patient's SBP dropped to 80-90s, so CVL placed and Levophed
started.
.
On the floor, pt with 5/10 R lateral abdominal pain. No f/c,
N/V.
.
Review of systems:

(-) Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Treated for pneumonia in [**2-/2135**] and reports stable nonproductive
cough since. On 1L NC at baseline per pt. Denies chest pain,
chest pressure, palpitations. Denies diarrhea.  Lower abdominal
discomfort which he attributes to constipation; no BMs in
several days. Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rashes or
skin changes.

IMAGES/STUDIES:
.
[**2135-5-7**] CXR: SINGLE PORTABLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: The
cardiomediastinal contour is within normal limits for technique.
There has been prior midline sternotomy with intact sternal
wires in the expected location. The aortic arch demonstrates
moderate calcification. Lung volumes are low, and there are
bilateral small pleural effusions and atelectasis. Osseous
structures and soft tissues are otherwise unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral small effusions and atelectasis.
.
[**2135-5-7**] CXR: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination,
the right-sided jugular vein catheter has been inserted. The tip
of the catheter projects over the inflow tract of the right
atrium. No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.
Unchanged bilateral basal areas of atelectasis.
.
[**2135-5-7**] Percutaneous nephrostomy:
.
LENI ([**5-8**]): IMPRESSION: Short segment of non-occlusive thrombus
within the left popliteal vein.
.

Echo ([**5-7**]): The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right
atrium is markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is mild to moderate
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40 %). The reduced
ejection fraction may be due primarily to irregularity and
rapidity of heart beat with inadequate filling period. There is
considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular
ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**1-15**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left
atrial pressure. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
