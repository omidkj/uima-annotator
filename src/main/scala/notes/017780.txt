HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 60-year-old patient
who is known to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with a history of coronary artery
disease and aortic stenosis.  She was seen originally on
[**2117-9-29**] from the history and physical.  She was doing well
for several years.  She had a prior coronary artery bypass
grafting and aortic valve replacement in [**2110**].  Approximately
one month ago she had an episode of chest pain which resolved
and then another episode of chest pain one week later and
dyspnea on exertion.  An echocardiogram done on [**2117-9-13**]
showed concentric LVH with an ejection fraction of 50-55
percent, mild aortic insufficiency, severe AS with a peak
gradient of 113, and mean gradient of 72, moderate MR, mild
TR, and mild pulmonary hypertension.  TE on [**2117-9-21**] showed
LVH with EF of 50-55 percent AS, mitral annular calcification
with mitral valve thickening, and moderate MR.  Cardiac
catheterization performed prior to this admission on [**2117-9-29**]
showed severe native three vessel disease with a patent LIMA
to the LAD, circumflex 90 percent with a PTI stent, saphenous
vein graft to the OM had an 80 percent lesion, RCA 70 percent
lesion with significant damping, mild aortic insufficiency,
mild aortic arch dilatation.  The patient reported angina,
dyspnea on exertion, but denied nausea, vomiting,
palpitations, diaphoresis.  She reports a presyncopal event
times one yesterday.  No peripheral edema.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. AVR CABG in [**2110**] with [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tissue valve and
   LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM.
2. Rheumatic fever.
3. Spinal meningitis four to seven years ago.
4. Gastrointestinal bleed in [**6-27**].
5. Polyps.
6. Congestive heart failure.
7. AS.
8. Noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
9. Hypertension.
10.      Hypercholesterolemia.


PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1. AVR CABG.
2. Hysterectomy.
3. Appendectomy.
4. Back surgery.


ALLERGIES:  She is allergic to Crestor which gave her
splenomegaly and elevated LFTs.

Surgery was cancelled on [**2117-9-29**] for a platelet drop to a
low of 60,000.  Hematology workup was in progress when the
patient was discharged with plans to follow-up with
Hematology, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], as an outpatient and return for CABG
AVR when hematology issues and platelet issues were
controlled.  The patient was complaining of shortness of
breath at home, orthopnea, and unable to have a conversation
secondary to shortness of breath.  She called her PCP who
recommended that she go to the Emergency Department.  The
patient presented to an outside hospital Emergency Department
and was treated for CHF with much improvement.  The platelets
at the outside hospital were 110 and transferred in for
treatment and consideration for CABG AVR again on [**2117-10-7**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, the patient's blood
pressure was 124/63, heart rate in sinus tachycardia at 94,
respiratory rate 25, saturating 97 percent.  The patient was
sitting at the edge of the bed in no apparent distress.  She
was short of breath with talking and at the time she was
laying flat for a chest x-ray with significantly increased
shortness of breath and heart rate.  She was alert and
oriented, appropriate with a nonfocal neurologic examination.
She had rales at the bilateral bases.  The heart revealed a
regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, grade III-IV/VI systolic
ejection murmur that radiated to her carotids.  Her abdomen
was soft, round, nontender, nondistended with positive bowel
sounds.  The extremities were warm and well perfuse with no
varicosities and trace peripheral edema.  She had 2 plus
bilateral radial pulses, 1 plus bilateral DP and PT pulses.

LABORATORY DATA:  The preoperative laboratories revealed a
white count of 5.7, hematocrit 30.3, platelet count 83,000.
Sodium 142, K 4.0, chloride 105, bicarbonate 28, BUN 32,
creatinine 1.1 with a blood sugar of 166, PT 13.9, PTT 28.4,
INR 1.2.  ALT 22, AST 29, LDH 354, alkaline phosphatase 94,
total bilirubin 0.8.

Chest x-ray showed bilateral effusions and CHF.

Bone marrow biopsy showed a question of early myelodysplasia
syndrome.  Please refer to the official report.

Hematology was consulted again and felt that the platelet
count was probably closer to normal range then was
registering and the patient was probably sequestering
platelets in the spleen with splenomegaly.  This was
discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for a question of whether or not
the patient could continue and go to the Operating Room.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1. Lopressor 50 mg p.o. twice daily.
2. Norvasc 7.5 mg p.o. daily.
3. Glyburide 5 mg p.o. twice daily.
4. Metformin 1,000 mg p.o. twice daily.
5. Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. twice daily.
6. Lasix 20 mg daily.
7. Aspirin 81 mg daily.
8. Paxil 5 mg daily.


HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the CCU and was
followed daily by Cardiology and was evaluated by the Cardiac
Surgery team as we awaited her hematology workup to be
completed and her platelet count to rise.  The patient had an
episode of epistaxis on the 15th and was seen by Dr.
_________________ of Hematology.  Platelet counts remained
low at 75,000.  Surgery was delayed as Hematology continued
to work on this issue for Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  The patient received
a transfusion of platelets preoperatively on the 15th.  The
patient was also seen by Cardiology daily and received a
second unit of platelets on the 16th for her significant
thrombocytopenia which was 113 on the 16th.  On the 17th, the
platelet count rose to 139 with a white count of 5.2 and
hematocrit of 29.7, creatinine was stable at 1.1 and INR of
1.2.

On the 17th, the patient was transferred out of the CCU to
[**Hospital Ward Name 121**] III, the step-down floor, as her preoperative workup
continued.  On [**2117-10-11**], the patient underwent redo CABG with
a vein graft to the RCA and aortic valve replacement with a
19 mm mosaic porcine tissue valve.  The patient was
transferred to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit in
stable condition on a milrinone drip at 0.3 micrograms per
kilogram per minute, Amiodarone drip at 2.4 mg per minute,
epinephrine 0.04 micrograms per kilogram per minute, Levophed
drip at 0.06 micrograms per kilogram per minute, Neo-
Synephrine drip at 0.3 micrograms per kilogram per minute,
and a titrated propofol drip.  Of note, the patient did have
an asystolic cardiac rest at 12:15 a.m. on the morning prior
to surgery.  She had some low blood pressures.  Lasix was
held.  She became unresponsive with bradycardia to asystole
noted on the telemetry strip.  CPR was briefly initiated with
bagging but she became responsive within several seconds and
was sleepy but alert.  The patient had good pulses which
returned spontaneously with blood pressure in the 120s/60s
which had dropped to 80/60.  She had sinus tachycardia on EKG
and stable diffuse ST changes that were unchanged since her
recent EKGs.  She was transferred back to the CCU.  This was
all in the early morning hours prior to surgery.

On postoperative day number one, the patient had some
metabolic acidosis and received 3 amps of bicarbonate which
helped resolve this problem, lactate up to 11.6 and back down
to 6.0.  Epinephrine was decreased. Milrinone was increased.
The patient received intravenous fluids and 20 of Lasix and
remained on Amiodarone, epinephrine, insulin, Levophed,
milrinone and propofol drips.  Postoperatively, the platelet
count was 253,000 with an INR of 1.5.  The white count was 21
and a hematocrit of 30.  The K was 4.8, creatinine stable at
1.0.  The patient began Plavix, continued Lasix diuresis with
the plan to wean epinephrine and keep the patient intubated.

On postoperative day number two, the patient received 1 unit
of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 26, platelet
counts dropped again to 79,000.  A HIT screen was sent.  The
patient was in sinus rhythm, hemodynamically stable.  The
patient was alert and oriented.  The patient had decreased
breath sounds at the bases.  The examination
