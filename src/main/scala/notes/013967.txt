Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Bactrim / Remeron

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**]
Chief Complaint:
respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal Intubation from [**3-22**]/08 through [**4-6**]
Tracheostomy on [**2185-4-6**]


History of Present Illness:
85 y/o man with h/o CHF, CAD, PVD, and chronic atrial
fibrillation on [**Date Range **] who is well known to [**Hospital1 18**] with
multiple admissions who presented to the ED from rehab with
respiratory distress/dyspnea. CXR at rehab the day PTA with B/L
lower lobe PNA. He was also noted to be hypotensive in the ED
with SBPs in the 70s. Of note, he was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**]
for most of [**Month (only) 404**] with FTT and dehydration.
.
ED course:
Vitals on presentation: T 97.9 HR 104 BP 132/68 RR 27 85% NRB
improved to 95% RA then 100% NRB.
In the ED, the patient was intubated for respiratory distress
and increased work of breathing. He was also hypotension with
systolics in the 70s which responded with IVF. He was given
ceftriaxone, vanc, and azithromycin. From [**Hospital3 2558**]. He had
been DNR/DNI but code status was reversed in the ED.

Past Medical History:
Diastolic CHF, most recent EF 60-65%, on Lasix at rehab
PVD s/p right SFA to AT bypass in [**5-9**]
CAD, s/p MI in [**2174**], s/p NSTEMI in setting of rapid afib
(admission [**5-9**])
Chronic atrial fibrillation, had been on [**Month/Year (2) **] in the past,
stopped several months ago for unclear reasons, now on ASA alone

T2DM
Hypercholesterolemia
Hypothyroidism. He was diagnosed with hypothyroidism around
[**6-8**]. He had been taking 12.5mcg Synthroid until his recent
hospitalization this [**Month (only) 359**] when his Synthroid was increased to
25mcg once daily as his TSH was high at that time.  The
Synthroid was again increased to 50mcg at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab at
unknown day as his TSH was high persistently, according to
medical record which was faxed to us from Dr.[**Name (NI) 7753**] office. So
his is taking 50mcg once daily now.
Recurrent C. Diff colitis.
Post-Polio weakness/contracture. He developed polio infection at
age of 25 and has bilateral legs weakness and right upper arm
weakness.
Chronic urinary retention [**3-5**] to BPH
Multiple prolonged recent hospitalizations:
- [**Date range (1) 96030**]/07 - admitted for Right SFA to DP bypass for severe
gangrene of right foot
- [**Date range (1) 96031**] - atrial fibrillation, C.diff, hypotension
- [**Date range (1) 14447**]/07 - hypotension, UTI, afib with [**Date range (1) 5509**], diarrhea
- [**Date range (1) 32799**]/07 - pulmonary edema, pneumonia, afib with [**Last Name (LF) 5509**], [**First Name3 (LF) 282**]
[**First Name3 (LF) **] placement, CPAP, pulm edema requiring thoracentesis and

- [**Date range (1) 96032**]/07 - [**Hospital 100**] Rehab
- [**Date range (1) 96033**] - [**Hospital3 **], dehydration, acute renal failure
and was then transferred to [**Hospital1 69**]
for further management of renal failure, fluid overload. His
clinical course was complicated by recurrent C. diff colitis,
pseudogout in right wrist and UTI. He was discharged to [**Hospital 7137**] Nursing Home [**2185-3-2**].
- 15/08 - [**2185-3-3**] [**Hospital1 18**], FTT, hyperkalemia, ESBL UTI tx with IM
gent, chronic c.diff on PO vanc, pseudogout of right wrist,
subacute stroke on ASA and Plavix, discharged DNR/DNI
s/p [**Hospital1 282**] [**Hospital1 **] placement
Concern for depression at recent geriatric visit on [**2185-3-14**],
refused to take any antidepressant, tried Remeron in the past
but didn't tolerate it because of hallucination, also refused
Megace

EKG [**3-22**]
Atrial fibrillation, average ventricular rate about 100 per
minute. Borderline low limb lead voltage. Complete right
bundle-branch block. Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared to
the previous tracing of [**2185-2-6**] no diagnostic change.

**** IMAGING ****
CXR [**3-22**]
SINGLE SUPINE VIEW OF THE CHEST AT 8:30 A.M.: There has been
interval placement of an endotracheal [**Month/Year (2) **], terminating
approximately 4.5 cm from the carina. Layering pleural effusions
are seen bilaterally, left greater than right. Increased opacity
is seen throughout both lungs, likely due to a combination of
mild pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, and basilar
atalectasis. Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are
unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Appropriate position of endotracheal [**Month/Year (2) **]. Layering
bilateral pleural effusions and mild pulmonary edema.

TTE [**3-23**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
25-30 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with moderate global
free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2184-10-18**],
there has been marked/diffuse biventricular systolic dysfunction
c/w diffuse process (toxin, metabolic, cannot exclude
multivessel CAD but less likely as no focality to dysfunction).
The left pleural effusion is now much larger.

Renal U/S [**3-25**]
1. No evidence of hydronephrosis or mass within the urinary
bladder.
2. A 1.9 cm angiomyolipoma of the right k
