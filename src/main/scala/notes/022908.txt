Chief Complaint:
fever and hypotension

central line placement


History of Present Illness:
Briefly, patient is an 18 year-old female college student with
history of depression, anemia, and dysmennorhea who presented to
the ED with nausea, vomiting and non-specific abdominal pain. On
arrival to the ED she was found to be tachycardic to the 130s
and hypotensive to 76/25 requiring 9 L IVF resuscitation.
According to her she has been having vague abdominal pain since
Tuesday, and developed diarrhea on Friday. Patient denied any
recent travel, sick contacts, irregular foods, vaginal
discharge, or urinary symptoms. Reports last sexual activity was
1 month ago.
.
In the ED, a femoral A-line was placed and a right IJ central
line was placed. She was treated with Decadron, Vanco, Levo,
Flagyl, and neosynephrine drip. CT of chest and abdomen showed
diffuse airspace opacities, no abscess or infection could be
found. Upon further conversation with her family it turns out
that she has been having a urinary tract infection which did not
respond well to antibiotics and has been having flank
tenderness. Lactate went from 4.7 to 1.5 after therapy.
.
In the MICU, patient was non-emergently intubated for increased
respiratory rate, increasing PaCO2 and worsening SOB, and later
extubated - etiology was thought to be pulmonary edema secondary
to aggresive fluid hydration during hypotensive episodes.
Patient diuresed well with gentle IV Lasix. With respect to her
sepsis, no clear origin of her sepsis was found. Abdominal CT
was negative. Patient had a positive U/A but urine Cx was
negative. OB/GYN was consulted, they did not feel that gyn
abnormality could account for symptoms - adnexa and uterus were
normal on CT, GC/Chlamydia probes were negative. Head and sinus
CT were negative. Stool cultures and O & P were negative. ID
consult was obtained, and patient was continued on empiric
Levofloxacin/Flagyl on transfer to the floor.
.
On transfer to the floor, patient denied any complaints. Patient
denied any abdominal pain, chest pain, nausea, or vomiting, and
reported that she had appetite and was tolerating food well.
Reproted that she was breathing better, but reported cough when
she sat up.
