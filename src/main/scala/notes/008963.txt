Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1115**]
Chief Complaint:
Cough and fever


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 62 year old man with mild developmental delay,
mild OCD, and hypertension who presented to the ED from his
group home complaining of fever and cough. The history is
limited due to his somewhat limited ability to communicate.

He apparently developed a cough two days prior to admission.
Today he was seen by an advanced practice nurse, probably at the
group home, and was noted to be febrile to 101.6, tachycardic to
127 and with an oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. He was
sent to the ED where his initial vitals were 100.8 128 125/85 20
94%. He had a leukocytosis, profuse, productive cough, and a
possible right lower lobe consolidation on a chest xray. He was
treated with morphine, azithromycin, ceftriaxone, and tylenol.
He was given 3L NS.

On arrival to the MICU, he complained of a "cold" and continued
to repeat that he was "just getting over a cold". He states that
he sometimes has sharp pains all over his body. He says that he
had a sore throat before his cough.

   Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2138-7-10**]):
      NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
           (Reference Range-Negative).
      Performed by Immunochromogenic assay.
      A negative result does not rule out infection due to other
L.
      pneumophila serogroups or other Legionella species.
Furthermore, in
      infected patients the excretion of antigen in urine may
vary.

   Respiratory Viral Antigen Screen (Final [**2138-7-10**]):
      Less than 60 columnar epithelial cells;.
      Specimen inadequate for detecting respiratory viral
infection by DFA
      testing.
      Interpret all negative results from this specimen with
caution.
      Negative results should not be used to discontinue
precautions.
      Refer to respiratory viral culture results.
      Recommend new sample be submitted for confirmation.
      Reported to and read back by DR [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 104899**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**2138-7-10**] AT

CXR - [**7-10**]
IMPRESSION:  New retrocardiac opacity which is concerning for
pneumonia, and could be better evaluated with dedicated upright
and lateral chest
radiographs.

CXR - [**7-11**]
Improving left lower lobe opacity.  Considering rapid
development and rapid improvement, aspiration is a likely
possible cause.  However, followup radiographs with PA and
lateral technique would be helpful as well as clinical
correlation to exclude an infectious pneumonia.

TTE - [**7-10**]
The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with thinning and hypokinesis
of the mid to distal inferior and inferolateral segments and of
the distal anteroseptum and apex. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. Interventricular septal motion
is normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic function
suggestive of multivessel CAD. No significant valvular
abnormality seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 62yo male w mild developmental delay, hypertension who
presented to the ED from his group home with fever, cough, found
to have R lower lobe consolidation, treated for community
acquired pnuemonia with subsequent improvement
.
#Bacterial Pneumonia with reactive airway disease flare: The
patient's bacterial pneumonia was most likely secondary to
aspiration.  No sputum cultures were able to be sent.  Urine
legionella antigen, nasopharyngeal viral screen were negative.
Patient was treated with PO levofloxacin and weaned off
supplemental oxygen.  To rule out an aspiration cause, he had a
speech and swallow evaluation that was unremarkable. Given
significant wheezing on exam, he was treated with a two week
course of prn albuterol and inhaled corticosteroids.  He
completed a 5d course of levofloxacin prior to discharge.
.
#Hypertension: The patient's home lisinopril and
hydrochlorothiazide were held in setting of acute ilnness, but
restarted at discharge.  Continued home aspirin.
.
#Behavioral Issues NOS: Stable. The patient was continued on his
home clozapine, divalproic acid/delayed release, and
benztropine.
.
# Chronic constipation: The patient's was maintained lactuose
and psyllium for constipation. He also received colace/senna.
.
#?Allergies: Patient received loratidine PRN.
.
