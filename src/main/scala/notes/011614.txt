CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS; CT 150CC NONIONIC CONTRAST  [**2108-6-18**]

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
53 year old woman with elevated INR and subdural hematoma from
OSH
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate evolution of R subdural
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Evaluate evolution of right subdural hematoma.

Note is made of the prior study of [**2102-1-30**].
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT SCAN: There is a roughly 7-mm wide left
frontal subdural hematoma. There is a thin right parafalcian
subdural collection. Subarachnoid hemorrhage is seen in the
right frontal sulci. A 2.5 x 2.2 cm rounded focus of extraaxial
hemorrhage is seen adjacent to an area of right frontal/temporal
cystic encephalomalacia. This does not impress the brain, but
extends into the atrophic area. There is slight 7 mm rightward
subfalcine herniation. There is no hydrocephalus. Again seen are
right middle cerebral aneurysm coils. The osseous structures are
unremarkable. There is bilateral maxillary mucosal, as well as
sphenoid sinus mucosal thickening, and fluid with aerosolized
secretions.

IMPRESSION: Left frontal subdural hematoma. Parasagittal
subdural hematoma. Right frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Right
frontal/temporal hemorrhage adjacent to area of encephalomalacia
which likely is extra-axial. Mild rightward shift of midline
structures.

Acute pansinusitis.

CTA HEAD SCAN:
Dynamically acquired CTA images and 2Drefomatted scans are
reviewed.

The internal carotid arteries, as well as the major vessels of
the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] appear opacified. Beam hardening artifact
from right MCA coils limits evaluation of the right MCA artery.

IMPRESSION: Beam hardening artifact from right MCA coils limits
evaluation of the right MCA artery. Specifically right MCA
aneurysm/ruptured aneurysm cannot be excluded on the basis of
this examination.

ECHO:[**2108-6-19**]
Indication: Cerebrovascular event/TIA. Syncope

Conclusion:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
mild to moderate  global left ventricular hypokinesis. Right
ventricular chamber size and free  wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally  normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral  valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

VERT/CAROTID A-GRAM  [**2108-6-21**]

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
53 year old woman with s/p R MCA aneurysm coiling '[**01**], developed
infarct to R MCA post coiling, on Coumadin for RUA DVT, now
there is blood into infacted area.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o aneurysmal bleed

IMPRESSION: 1. No sign of reperfusion of the previously coiled
right MCA aneurysm.

2. Tiny approximately 1.5-mm aneurysm of the distal right middle
cerebral artery bifurcation separate from the previously coiled
aneurysm.

3. Questionable broad-based 1-mm aneurysm at the left middle
cerebral artery bifurcation.

4. Atherosclerotic plaque present at the origins of the internal
carotid arteries bilaterally, left greater than right.




Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 53 year old woman who presented with
persistent headache past 2 weeks. Her head CT in ED revealed
small left frontal subdural hemorrhage. Patient admitted to
neurosurgery service to further investigate the bleed whether is
a right MCA aneurysmal bleed given the history of coiling on the
right middle cerebral artery in [**2101**]. She transferred to neuro
ICU for close neurologic an hemodynamic monitoring. Her initial
INR was 4.1 reversed with Proplex, vitamin K as well as FFP's.
She is kept NPO overnight. Systolic blood pressure goal is less
than 140 mmHg, then liberalize to less than 160 mmHg. Her
hematocrit on admission was low and dropped from 25.3 to 21.1.
Hematology consulted for anemia work up. She had a fever of
102.3 on admission her urine and blood cultures showed no growth
for microorganism.

She underwent for cerebral arteriogram on [**2108-6-21**] which is
revealed no sign of reperfusion of the previously coiled right
MCA aneurysm. Tiny approximately 1.5-mm aneurysm of the distal
right middle cerebral artery bifurcation separate from the
previously coiled aneurysm. Questionable broad-based 1-mm
aneurysm at the
