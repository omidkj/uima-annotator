Chief Complaint:
worsening shortness of breath


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2103-9-25**]
1. Right mini thoracotomy.
2. Transaortic placement of a 29-mm core valve aortic valve
    bioprosthesis.  The valve data is the following:  Model

History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 83yo caucasian male with known AS, CAD - s/p
CABGx4([**2084**]), PVD, and significant pulmonary disease
(restrictive
and obstructive, asbestosis) on home oxygen. He presents with
c/o
worsening shortness of breath. He reports prior activity of
walking to the senior center twice a week, now is visibly pale
and unsteady after observed walking 50 feet. Admits to
lightheadedness, denies chest pain. He was evaluated at [**Hospital1 2025**] and
was deemed to be prohibitively high risk for surgical AVR, and
not a candidate for TAVI there due to significant peripheral
vascular disease. He is referred here for evaluation for
treatment options for his symptomatic severe AS.

Conclusions
The left atrium is markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. An aortic CoreValve prosthesis is
present. The transaortic gradient is normal for this prosthesis.
Trace/mild paravalvular aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2103-9-27**],
trace/mild paravalvular aortic regurgitation is now visualized
but prior study is suboptimal for comparison.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2103-9-25**] where
the patient underwent Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] in conjunction with cardiology.  Overall the
patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring.  He developed acidosis with rising lactate
immediately post-operatively.  He was given fluid boluses and
hemodynamics remained stable on low dose phenylephrine.  He was
chemically paralyzed and ventilation improved.  Echo showed good
LV function with no pericardial effusion and no evidence of
aortic valve malfunction.  Transplant surgery was consulted for
rising lactate.  Suspicion was low for mesenteric ischemia and
labs were followed.  KUB did not reveal any free air.  Lactate
trended down.  Vasopressor support was weaned.  The patient was
weaned from the ventilator and extubated on POD 4.  He did
exhibit some post-op delerium.  Geriatrics was consulted and
recommended improved sleep/wake cycles.  Mental status returned
to baseline and the patient as oriented and appropriate prior to
discharge.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was
gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient was
transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest
tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.

By the time of discharge on POD# 9 the patient was ambulating
freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral
analgesics.  The patient was discharged to [**Hospital 4470**] Health Care
Center Rehab in good condition with appropriate follow up
instructions.
