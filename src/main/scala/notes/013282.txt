Pertinent Results:
[**2134-8-10**] Echo: Prebypass:
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma
in the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in the aortic
arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve
area 0.8-1.0cm2). Moderate to severe (3+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**2-5**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was
notified in person of the results on[**2134-8-10**] at 1045 am.
Post bypass:
Patient is AV paced and receiving an infusion of phenylephrine.
LV systolic function is mildly depressed (septal and anterior
septal walls are hypokinetic). RV systolic function is
unchanged. Bioprosthetic valve seen in the aortic position.
There is no aortic insufficiency. The gradient across the aortic
valve is 25 to 30 mm Hg. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] aware. Mild mitral
regurgitation persists. Aorta is intact post decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**8-10**] Ms.[**Known lastname 91180**] went to the operating room and underwent coronary
artery bypass graft x 2 (Left internal Mammary artery grafted to
Left anterior Descending arterty)/Aortic Valve Replacement
(#23mm [**Company 1543**] Mosaic)with root enlargement. Cross clamp
time=109 minutes. Cardiopulmonary Bypass time=133 minutes.Please
refer to Dr[**Last Name (STitle) **] operative report for further details. She
tolerated the procedure wella nd was transferred to the CVICU
incritical but stable condition.She weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact, and was extubated without difficulty. All
lines and drains were discontinued in a timely fashion.
Beta-blocker and diuresis was initiated. POD#2 she continued to
progress and was transferred to the step down unit for further
monitoring. Anticoagulation was started for 3 month duration
secondary to pericardial patch placement. Physical therapy was
consulted and evaulation was made. POD#3 Ms.[**Known lastname 91180**] went into
Atrial Fibrillation and was treated medically with increased
beta-blocker and Amiodarone.  She did have some episodes of
bradycardia with the combination of lopressor and amiodarone.
The electrophysiology service was consulted and recommended to
continue amiodarone, but hold lopressor however her rapid afib
persisted and so LOW dose lopressor wa sstarted w/ excellent
response. Resting HR was 60 and ambulatory HR was 80. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of
hearts monitor was placed prior to discharge per the request of
the electrophysiology service. The patient developed a small
area of erythema (without drainage) at the distal pole of the
sternal incision and was started on kefzol for this.  On POD# 8
she was cleared by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] for discharge to home with VNA.
All followup appointments were advised.
