Past Medical History:
Onc History:
Pt presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2153-3-22**] with hemoptysis. At that time
she was found to have a 8x8x9cm mass in the RUL displacing
segmental bronchi of the RML but no clear invasion. CT guided
biopsy showed non small cell lung CA. She had a PET and an MRI
and found to have a T7 likely metastatic lesion.  She underwent
radiation treatment of both her spine mets and lung mass in
[**4-21**].  She is to receive palliative chemo.

   RADIOLOGY  Final Report

MR THORACIC SPINE  [**2153-6-7**] 6:59 PM

MR THORACIC SPINE

Reason: please assess for cord compression

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
59 YO W with metastatic lung cancer with known T7 spinal lesion
now presents with lower extremity weakness
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please assess for cord compression
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 59-year-old with metastatic lung cancer and known T7
spinal lesion. Assess for cord compression.

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images through the
thoracic spine without IV contrast.

COMPARISON: [**2153-3-30**].

There is a large right upper lobe lung mass measuring at least
3.6 x 6.2 cm on scout images. This is consistent with the
patient's known history of lung cancer.

Compression deformity of the T7 vertebral body has progressed
since the prior examination now with marked retropulsion of
fragments and increased soft tissue mass associated with
increased compression of spinal cord. Soft tissue is seen
extending into and essentially obliterating the left neural
foramen and pressing upon the spinal cord causing
moderate-to-severe cord compression. No increased STIR signal
intensity or T2 signal intensity is seen within the cord to
suggest cord edema. Soft tissue mass is also seen extending into
the right neural foramen, but to a lesser extent than the left.

A new linear area along the superior aspect of the T4 vertebral
body is seen, demonstrating decreased T1 and increased STIR
signal intensity. A new 7 x 7 mm rounded somewhat ill-defined
lesion is seen in the posterior right aspect of the T6 vertebral
body concerning for a new metastatic static focus. Decreased T1
signal intensity along the inferior endplate of T6 likely is due
to degenerative changes. Heterogeneously decreased T1 and
increased T2/STIR signal intensity throughout the T8 vertebral
body is also seen and new from the prior examination. There is
also mild-to-moderate anterior wedging of the T8 vertebral body,
also new since the prior study. There has been slightly
increased diffuse T1 signal intensity throughout the vertebral
bodies in the thoracic spine likely related to post-radiation
changes.

Elsewhere in the thoracic spine, the spinal canal appears normal
in caliber. Vertebral body alignment is also normal elsewhere as
is vertebral body height and disc space height.

IMPRESSION:

1. Progression of metastatic disease involving T8 with increased
collapse of the vertebral body and soft tissue component
involving the vertebral body. There is extension of soft tissue
component into both neural foramen, left greater than right, and
moderate-to-severe cord compression without definite cord edema.

2. Probable new metastatic focus in T6 posteriorly on the right.

3. Post-radiation changes throughout the thoracic spine. Signal
abnormalities in the T4 vertebral body is probably due to
insufficiency fracture post-radiation. Signal abnormalities in
T8 are less certain and may be due to new metastatic involvement
or insufficiency fracture.

4. Known right upper lobe lung cancer.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

   RADIOLOGY   Preliminary Report

CHEST (PRE-OP PA & LAT)  [**2153-6-9**] 5:34 PM

CHEST (PRE-OP PA & LAT)

Reason: LUNG CANCER;WEAKNESS

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
59 year old woman with T7 metastatic lesion
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
preop CXR
HISTORY: Metastatic lesion.

PA and lateral radiographs of the chest again demonstrate a
right upper lung mass, similar in appearance when compared to
[**2153-5-4**]. There is no pleural effusion. The left lung is clear.
Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. The osseous structures of
the spine are not well assessed secondary to technique. There is
mild shift of the trachea from the midline to the right. No
pneumothorax.
