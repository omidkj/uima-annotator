Portable chest [**2-28**] Tracheostomy tube remains in standard
position. Permanent pacemaker is unchanged in position, with
proximal coiling of one of the leads in the right
supraclavicular area. Heart is enlarged but stable in size.
Pulmonary vascular engorgement and perihilar haziness are
unchanged. Multifocal areas of atelectasis show slight
improvement, particularly in the right lower lobe. Left
retrocardiac opacity and adjacent left pleural effusion are
unchanged. Small right pleural effusion is also stable.

[**2-28**] CT Head w/o contrast
IMPRESSION:
1. No hemorrhage or mass effect.
2. Chronic microvascular ischemia.
3. Paranasal sinus mucosal disease.
4. Unchanged expansion of the diploic space of the left parietal
bone which may be secondary to Paget's disease.

[**3-2**] EEG
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to the independent, at
times
synchronous, frontocentral slowing with broad-based phase
reversals, as
well as the slow and disorganized background and bursts of
generalized
slowing. This suggests bilateral frontocentral subcortical
dysfunction,
as well as similar regions of cortical irritability. The slow
and
disorganized background and bursts of generalized slowing
suggest an
encephalopathy, which may be seen with infections, toxic
metabolic
abnormalities, ischemia or medication effect.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted with a CHF exacerbation. He was diuresed
and began feeling better. CT surgery was consulted for his MR
and TR. Cardiac cath on [**1-27**] showed severe 3VD with a patent
LIMA-LAD, severe disease in SVG->OM and occluded SVG->RCA. He
was placed on cipro for a UTI. Dental medicine cleared him for
surgery. He awaited improving creatinine before going to the
operating room on [**2124-2-3**] where he underwent a redo,
redo-sternotomy, MVR with #31 [**Company **] mosaic tissue valve & TV
Repair with 32 mm CE band. He was transferred to the CSRU in
critical but stable condition on epinephrine, levophed,
vasopressin, and propofol. His epi was weaned off  and he was
started on natrecor for diuresis. He was extubated on POD #2.
The remaining vasoactive drips were weaned to off on POD #3 and
he was diuresed with lasix. He continued to be followed by
cardiology. He was seen by speech and swallow who recommended
pureed solids and thin liquids with PO meds. He was transferred
to the floor on POD #5. He was cdiff positive on [**2-9**] and was
started on flagyl. He was readmitted to the CSRU on [**2-9**] for
respiratory distress and decreased urine output. He was treated
with nebulizers with little result and required reintubation. He
was seen by mephrology later that same day for anuria and rising
creatinine. He was started on vasopressin and neosynphrine for
hypotension. His neo and vasopressin weaned to off on [**2-11**]. His
creaintine and urine output continued to improve. He was again
extubated on [**2-12**]. On [**2-14**], he had recurrent ATN, required
reintubation for suspected aspiration and pressors again. He
also had afib.  He was started on CVVH. He was seen by ID and
was started on cefepime and vanco. On [**2-21**] he was again
extubated and his CVVH was dc'd. A dobhoff tube wsa placed and
he was started on tube feeds. PICC line placed [**2-22**]. Antibiotics
(vanco/cefepime) for presumed hospital acquired pneumonia dc'd
on [**2-23**]. He completed his course of flagyl.
Urine output continued to wax and wane and he was again seen by
renal, repiratory status [**Last Name (un) **] began to deteriorate. He was seen
by thoracic surgery for consideration of trach and PEG which
were placed n [**2-25**]. He was seen by neurology on [**2-27**] for
stiffness which ws thought to be metabolic. Head CT was
negative.  He was restarted on dialysis on [**3-1**] and an HD cath
was placed on [**3-3**]. He was last
