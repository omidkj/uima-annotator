Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2751**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain, Hip pain, Transfer from OSH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Total hip arthroplasty, left
Blood transfusion


History of Present Illness:
History of present illness: 61 yo M with a past medical history
of fatty liver, COPD, gastritis, and OA of the left hip presents
with acute onset of abdominal pain and diarrhea. Patient was in
his USOH when he developed mild "heartburn" 3 days ago.
Yesterday he developed multiple episodes of diarrhea without
abdominal pain. He had stools roughly every 30 minutes that were
beige, about 250 cc in volume and without frank melena or
hematochezia. His last stool was yesterday morning, and he has
reported decreased flatus since that time. No sick contacts and
no out of the ordinary food products. At 4 am the morning of
admission, patient developed acute onset 10 epigastric pain that
woke him from sleep. Pain is burning in sensation, [**10-12**],
nonradiating, nonpositional, unchanged with po intake and unlike
any pain he has had in the past. Patient also noted acute on
chronic left hip pain. Patient uses a walker at baseline [**2-4**]
left hip OA (although patient is unclear on exact etiology of
his hip pain), and does not recall any trauma or accidents. When
patient awoke with abdominal pain he also noted [**10-12**] left hip
pain localized to the greater trochater and radiating to his
buttock. Pain is like his usual baseline pain, but more severe,
and is exacerbated by weight bearing. Patient takes ibuprofen
and excedrin for his OA, and usually takes 6-8 tabs daily for
pain, but did not take any over the last 24 hours. Patient does
report some dyspnea, but he says this is at baseline for him. He
denies fevers, chills, cough, chest pain, nausea and vomitting.

.
At the [**Hospital 4199**] hospital ER LFTs and lipase were unremarkable. CT
abdomen was remarkable for a small area in the proximal aorta
consistent with small dissection, as well as a question of
avascular necrosis of the hip. He was seen by vascular surgery
who felt that he should be transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible
MRI. He received toradol 30 mg IV, Morphine 4mg IV, dilaudid 1
mg IV x2 prior to transfer.
.
At the [**Hospital1 18**] ER, Vascular surgery evaluated the patient. After
reviewing the CT scan they surgery team felt there was no clear
evidence of vascular injury and advised keeping the patient's
SBP around 120 mmHg and HR less than 60 bpm. However, patient
refused blood pressure medication because he reports having low
blood pressure at baseline. On exam, patient was guaiac positive
with brown stool. He received protonix 40 mg IV x1 and a gram of
tylenol. Orthopedics was consulted for his hip pain, but they
have not yet seen the patient. VS on transfer 90, 162/95, 15,
100 RA.
.
On the floor, patient reports abdominal pain [**10-12**] and hip pain
[**10-12**].
.
ROS was otherwise essentially negative. The pt denied recent
unintended weight loss, fevers, night sweats, chills, headaches,
dizziness or vertigo, changes in hearing or vision, including
amaurosis fugax, neck stiffness, lymphadenopathy, hematemesis,
coffee-ground emesis, dysphagia, odynophagia, nausea, vomiting,
constipation, steatorrhea, melena, hematochezia, cough,
hemoptysis, wheezing, chest pain, palpitations, increasing lower
extremity swelling, orthpnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, leg
pain while walking, joint pain.

Past Medical History:

documentation he has:
# COPD (unknown PFTs)
# Fatty liver (presumed [**2-4**] alcohol)
# Gastritis (never had upper EGD, never had colonoscopy)
# H/o NSVT (3-4 beat run while admitted in [**3-11**])

Social History:
Quit smoking and etoh in [**3-11**]. Frankly denies current ethanol
use, but very heavy use in past per records from OSH. History of
160 pack years tobacco ([**2-6**] ppd over 40-45 years). No IVDU.
Currently unemployed, but formerly works as jeweler.
