Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
GIB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endoscopy and small bowel enterscopy


History of Present Illness:
52 yo F h/o extensive LLE DVT s/p thrombectomy and IVC filter
placement on coumadin/plavix, profound iron deficiency anemia
[**2-21**] AV malformations, DM II, HTN, morbid obesity who p/w
lightheadedness, lethargy, found to have Hct drop from 22 to 18
and dark stools.
.
Of note, pt has just been admitted from [**5-4**] to [**5-7**] with
reproducible CP felt to be due to costochondritis after
extensive workup (EKG unremarkable, ROMI, CTA without PE). Pt
was treated with
tylenol, lidoderm patch, and capsaicin cream, in addition to the

oxycodone which she takes chronically at home (she is allergic
to aspirin, so NSAIDs were not given). A pharmacologic MIBI was
done as well and showed a possible mild reversible inferior wall
defect.
Cardiology was consulted, and recommended medical management at
this time, given that there would not be a mortality benefit to
cardiac cath with the findings on her stress MIBI and that this
would be for symptom management only.  The patient has an
aspirin allergy, and was already on plavix, BB, ACEI and
pravastatin which was increased to the maximum dose. She was
started on ISMN 30 mg daily which she had not yet filled.
.
1d PTA, pt noted formed dark stool x1. On day of admission, she
had another dark BM and developed dizziness, lightheadedness,
blurry vision and vomited x1 (unclear if bloody). She saw her
PCP after that. VS were unremarkable then per the pt. However,
after the PCP visit she became symptomatic again, more
lightheaded. She was lying down and does not remember anything
anymore until she was in the ED. Her daughter had called EMS who
brought her in the ED.
.
In the ED, her VS were T97.2, 100, 80/palp, 98% on 4L. She was
lethargic and had mild abdominal tenderness. Labs were notable
for a Hct of 18, down from latest baseline of 22-23 since [**Month (only) 958**]
(23.6 on recent discharge at 4/18). Also INR of 2.6 on coumadin.
2 PIVs were placed. Pt received 3L IVF NS with improvement of BP
to systolic 120s, later 150s. Pt also received 2mg Vitamin K IV,
2x FFP and 2U PRBC. GI was consulted and NG lavage was attempted
but pt refused. She was admitted for GIB to the ICU.
.
Upon arrival in the ICU, pt was more alert and SBP in 150s.
.
On ROS, denies CP, palpitations, diarrhea, F/C/N.

Studies:
.
EKG: SR, nl axis, nl intervals, new ST depressions in V3-V6
.
CXR [**5-11**] in ED: No acute cardiopulmonary process. No evidence of

pneumoperitoneum. Stable cardiomegaly.
.
Sigmoidoscopy [**2184-2-5**]: nonbleeding hemorrhoids
.
EGD 3/8/078: oozing angioectasia at fundus, was cauterized
.
[**Last Name (un) **] [**9-/2182**]: Polypectomy, no bleeding
.
[**2184-5-4**] CTA Chest: Suboptimal study without evidence of central
or interlobar pulmonary embolism.
.
[**2184-5-6**] pMIBI: No anginal symptoms or ischemic ST segment
changes. Limited study. Probable mild inferior wall reversible
perfusion abnormality. Calculated EF 49%.
.
Echo [**2-/2182**]: EF 55%. Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2177-11-28**], an impaired relaxation pattern is now
noted. Biventricular systolic function appears unchanged. (The
right ventricle was previously reported as being dilated and
hypokinetic; this was not identified upon review of the prior
study.)
.
CXR: No acute cardiopulmonary process or evidence of
pneumoperitoneum.
.
CT Abd/Pelvis [**5-12**]: 1. No findings to account for the patient's
left lower quadrant pain. This patient has undergone 22 CT scans
at this institution and additional studies involving ionizing
radiation should be ordered with discretion. 2. Interval
placement of an inferior vena cava filter and iliac vein stents.

.
RUQ U/S [**5-14**]: FINDINGS: No right upper extremity DVT either
acute or chronic
.
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLER ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and
Doppler
examination of the bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral
and popliteal veins was performed. Normal compressibility,
augmentation, waveforms and Doppler flow is demonstrated. There
is no evidence of intraluminal clot. IMPRESSION: No evidence of
DVT.

Brief Hospital Course:
52 yo F h/o extensive LLE DVT s/p thrombectomy and IVC filter
placement on coumadin/plavix, profound iron deficiency anemia
[**2-21**] AV malformations, DM II, HTN, morbid obesity who p/w
lightheadedness, lethargy, found to have Hct drop from 22 to 18
and dark stools.

Hospital Course by Problem

1. Anemia/Upper GI Bleed: Patient with Hct drop from 22 -> 18,
and has history of known AVMs, has had bleeds several times in
the past years. She was intially admitted to the ICU where she
had 2 large bore PIVs placed, was transfused total of 3 units
PRBCs, started on a PPI IV BID. Her anticoagulation was reversed
with FFP. She had an EGD and small bowel enteroscopy which
showed several AVMs in the proximal small bowel, which were
cauterized. She was transferred to the floor the morning after
admission, immediately following her GI intervention. She has
been getting IV iron as an outpatient, and had not had an
infusion for 2 months. She was given IV iron 500mg IV x2, per
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2539**], her outpatient hematologist. She also had poor
access, so a double lumen midline was placed. She required 1
more units pRBC [**5-15**] for Hct 24 indicating continued slow bleed,
but then HCT stabilized between 26-29 until discharge.
.
Hx of DVT: [**2-27**] had massive L iliofemoral DVT requiring AngioJet
thrombectomy, TPA thrombolysis, and iliac vein stenting and IVCF
placement in [**2184-2-29**]. Her anticoagulation was reversed for
enterscopy. After the enterscopy, Plavix was restarted (for SVC
filter and iliac vein stents). Heparin was started [**5-13**] for hx
of DVT. When her hct was stable for 24 hours on [**5-14**], coumadin
was restarted. She was continued on heparin until INR at goal
([**2-22**]).
.
Left foot pain: patient with left foot pain since DVT admission,
has had recent admission for this pain where [**Month/Day (3) 1106**], bone,
infectious, rheumatologic, and muscle ruled out and it was
thought to be secondary to nerve pain from DVT. c/o of pain
throughout admission. she was on morphine IV, gabapentin,
amitriptyline, with continued pain. Tramadol was started and she
did have improvement with this. She
