HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. [**Known lastname 40503**] is a 25 year-old white
male who was transferred from outside hospital with the
diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia and adult respiratory
distress syndrome.

The patient was initially admitted to [**Hospital6 1597**] on
[**2154-5-10**] after ingestion of OxyContin with alcohol and
found down by his girlfriend with blue color and abnormal
breathing pattern. His time down was unknown. EMS arrived and
gave him Narcan with some arousal. The patient had traumatic
intubation in the Emergency Department at [**Hospital3 **] with
desaturation and vomiting and aspiration of charcoal. On
admission to [**Hospital3 **] Intensive Care Unit the patient was
found to be unresponsive and had evidence of bilateral
pneumonitis and was found to be hypotensive.

On [**2154-5-11**] the patient was started on Ceftriaxone and
Flagyl for a fever and bilateral pneumonitis. He was started
also on Decadron. He was presser dependent at this time. The
patient remained difficult to oxygenate and ventilate and his
FIO2 requirement increased to 80% on [**2154-5-12**]. He
remained on Ceftriaxone and Flagyl and remains paralyzed.

The patient then had a waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] course between [**5-14**] and [**5-17**]. The patient spiked temperatures and found to
have leukocytosis in his blood. The patient had showed
transient clinical recovery up to the point of potential
extubation on [**2154-5-15**]. However he had further
temperature spikes and had increased FIO2 requirement back up
to 80% by [**2154-5-16**]. By [**2154-5-17**] the patient's
oxygen requirement had increased to 90% inspired FIO2. On
this day Vancomycin was started in addition to Ceftazidine.
He was diagnosed with adult respiratory distress syndrome and
started on Solu-Medrol.

On [**2154-5-18**] the patient was found to have a large
pneumothorax requiring a chest tube placement on his right
side. The patient remained difficult to ventilate and
oxygenate and remained persistently hypoxemic requiring high
saturation oxygen on ventilator. The patient was finally
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**2154-5-22**] for further management of his adult respiratory
distress syndrome.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1.  Protonix 40 mg po bid.
2.  Albuterol Atrovent nebulizers.
3.  Ativan 20 mg per hour drip.
4.  Heparin.
5.  Ceftazidine.
6.  Flagyl.
7.  Vancomycin.
8.  Ceftriaxone.
9.  Solu-Medrol.
10. Morphine drip.
11. Nystatin swish and swallow.

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives at home. He works as a
technician. The patient has a positive history of alcohol
abuse and marijuana use.

ALLERGIES: The patient has no known allergies.

MEDICATIONS: The patient takes no medications at home.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Hematocrit 29.2, white count
23.6, platelet count 593,000. Serum chemistry sodium 144,
potassium 4.6, chloride 99, bicarbonate 39, BUN 31,
creatinine 0.7, sugar 89. The differential on the patient's
white count revealed 86% neutrophils, 3% bands and 4%
monocytes. The patient's amylase was 120, lipase 123,
alkaline phosphatase 88, INR 1.2, albumin 2.9, calcium 8.4,
phosphate 0.3, magnesium 23, ALT 96, AST 28, LDH 714.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission to [**Hospital1 190**] was not recorded.

HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for further management of his acute adult
respiratory distress syndrome. He was placed on pressure
controlled ventilation with a driving pressure of 25 and a
positive end expiratory pressure of 15. He was maintained on
antibiotics. He had draining chest tube for his pneumothorax.
The patient was maintained on steroids for potential benefit
in diagnosis of adult respiratory distress syndrome. Due to
the patient's fever and leukocytosis, all of his central
lines were re-sited.

A right upper quadrant ultrasound was obtained to rule out a
cholecystitis. The patient was also started on total parental
nutrition for nutritional support on [**2154-5-24**].

Initially on transfer to [**Hospital1 69**]
the patient's paralytics were removed. The patient had become
increasingly agitated and required higher doses of sedation
and analgesia. The paralytics were restarted on [**2154-5-25**]. The patient's intravenous steroids were stopped on
[**2154-5-27**].

During his entire time in the Medical ICU the patient became
more and more difficult to ventilate. The patient required
additional boluses of Doxacurium, Fentanyl and Ativan and
despite which the patient continued to have spontaneous
breathing episodes with subsequent desaturations.

Due to increasingly difficult ventilation the patient was
started on high frequency jet ventilator at 3 hertz per
minute. Also on [**2154-5-11**] due to the patient's
continuous febrile illness and leukocytosis and clinical
deterioration, Infectious Disease was consulted and
recommended continued Vancomycin, CT scan of the sinuses and
starting Ciprofloxacin 400 twice a day.

On this day the patient began to manifest septic physiology
and all of his lines including arterial lines and central
lines were re-sited again. The patient developed a
spontaneous pneumothorax on his right side on [**2154-5-28**]
and required another chest tube placement. This was detected
following a desaturation at 3:30 in the afternoon of [**2154-5-28**] where chest x-ray showed a large right sided
pneumothorax. On this date the patient was placed back to
pressure controlled ventilation.

The patient also on this day was found to have decreased
urine output and increased serum creatinine to 1.4. A renal
consult was obtained at this time. Renal consultants at this
time found no evidence of interstitial nephritis and
recommended keeping mean arterial blood pressure to be
greater than 60 and avoid further diuresis.

On [**2154-5-30**] the patient now has positive blood cultures as
well as line cultures for staph aureus. He was diagnosed with
staph aureus sepsis. The patient remained hypoxic with high
oxygen requirements, requiring FIO2 of 0.9. The patient
continues to have worsening renal function. His serum
creatinine increased to 2.9 by [**2154-5-30**].

On [**5-30**] to [**5-31**] the patient continued to deteriorate
quickly clinically. The patient had gone into episodes of
hyperkalemia with no EKG changes but had a potassium of 5.9.
The patient was treated with Kayexalate. On this date the
patient had also culture evidence of both staph epidermidis
and staph aureus infecting his blood stream. On this day
Oxicillin was started in addition to intravenous Vancomycin
for the patient's septic syndrome.

The patient was started on continuous renal [**Last Name (un) **] hemodialysis
on this day due to his persistent total renal failure,
decreased urine output and hyperkalemia. His central lines
were re-sited and a Swan Ganz catheter was flown to measure
the patient's hemodynamic guidance of medical therapy. At
this time the patient remained on pressure control
ventilation with high driving pressuring of 32 and PEEP of
12.5 for a rate of 36 and oxygen FIO2 of 0.9. During this
interim the patient also received multiple bags of packed red
blood cells as he had dropped hematocrit of unclear source.
The patient was treated therapeutic, support keeping his
hematocrit greater than 25.

A Hematology consult was requested on [**2154-6-1**] due to the
patient's persistent drop in hematocrit for potential
treatment of hemolysis. No therapy was recommended.

The patient's condition remained tenuous. After proper
treatment of his staph aureus and staph epidermidis
bacteremia  his hypotension resolved and the patient was
weaned off from pressors. However his respiratory status
remained tenuous with high driving pressures and high oxygen
requirement.

On [**2154-6-5**] the patient again had desaturation episode
requiring increasing positive end expiratory pressure to
improve his oxygenation. Careful surveillance at this time
showed no other evidence of infections. At this time the
patient had high intrapulmonary volume and persistent leakage
through bilateral pne
