HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS AND SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE IN
THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT:  Patient is a 55-year-old man with
history of coronary artery disease status post
catheterization with left anterior descending stents, chronic
back pain status post multiple surgeries, hypothyroidism,
hypertension, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma status post chemotherapy
and radiation, prostate cancer status post prostatectomy, and
nephrolithiasis, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**1-28**] from
outside hospital, where he was intubated for respiratory
distress after being found to have multilobar pneumonia,
acute renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, methicillin-sensitive
Staph aureus bacteremia.

Patient initially was brought to the outside hospital after
being found on the floor of his apartment bathroom, and he
had been on the floor for an unknown period of time, but not
more than seven hours.  Cause of the patient being on the
floor was thought to be either accidental drug overdose as
the patient was on chronic narcotics for lower back pain or
sepsis.

Upon admission to the Intensive Care Unit at [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2145-1-27**], the patient was febrile, hypotensive, and
hypoxic requiring pressors and ventilatory support.  His
white blood count was elevated and he was also in acute renal
failure, but his creatinine was already trending down from
4.1 at the outside hospital to 2.1 upon admission here.

Patient was initially on Vancomycin and levofloxacin for
broad coverage given his persistent fevers.  Workup for the
source of his bacteremia was undertaken with CAT scan of the
torso without evidence of abscess or osteomyelitis, although
lumbar spine imaging was suboptimal due to the patient's
metallic hardware.  The CAT scan did show multilobar
pneumonia and bilateral pleural effusions.  Echocardiogram on
[**1-30**] showed no evidence of vegetations, left
ventricular ejection fraction of 59% and no focal wall motion
abnormalities.  The patient's antibiotic regimen was switched
numerous times in the Intensive Care Unit, but eventually
changed to just Vancomycin after a negative workup and after
the patient's sputum grew methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus.  Patient's acute renal failure
resolved with aggressive hydration.

Patient was extubated on [**2-4**] and transferred to the
Medicine floor on [**2-5**].

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE ON THE MEDICINE FLOOR:
See history of present illness above for details of the
course in the Intensive Care Unit.

1. Infectious disease/pulmonary:  Upon transfer to the
medicine floor, the patient was afebrile without significant
respiratory symptoms for the remainder of his hospital stay.
As described in the history of present illness above, the
patient was extubated on [**2145-2-4**], and was satting
well on nasal cannula and then on room air by [**2-8**].
Patient with sputum that was methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus positive.  CAT scan in the ICU showed
multilobar pneumonia.

Patient also reported with methicillin-sensitive Staph aureus
bacteremia at the outside hospital.  Patient's white blood
count trended down and was within normal limits by the time
he was transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit.
Infectious Disease was consulted and followed the patient
throughout his hospital stay.  Infectious Disease workup in
the Intensive Care Unit was done as outlined in the history
of present illness including CAT scan of the torso,
echocardiogram, and blood cultures.

On the medicine floor, MRI of the spine with and without
contrast showed no evidence of abscess or osteomyelitis, but
the study is limited by metallic lumbar spine hardware.  MRI
of the head with and without contrast showed bilateral
subdural hematomas without enhancing lesions or acute
hemorrhage.  Surveillance blood cultures did not grow
bacteria.

The subclavian catheter tip was sent for culture and did not
grow any bacteria either.  A transesophageal echocardiogram
was completed on [**2145-2-16**] to evaluate for
endocarditis and showed no evidence of valvular vegetations,
left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 55%, normal
wall motion, normal cavity sizes.  Patient was continued on
Vancomycin, which was restarted on [**2-1**], which he
tolerated well.  Vancomycin peak and trough serum levels were
tested and were at target, so the patient was continued on
his current dosing.

Per Infectious Disease recommendations, plan to continue the
Vancomycin for at least a six week course.  Patient has an
appointment with Infectious Disease Clinic at [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2145-3-9**] at which time they are decide on whether to
discontinue antibiotics after six weeks or if longer course
is necessary.

Patient's central line was removed.  A PICC line was placed
for IV antibiotic administration.

2. Rhabdomyolysis:  Creatine kinases reported in the 6,000s
at the outside hospital, but had decreased to 2,286 upon
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] after hydration.  Patient's CKs trended
down to within normal limits by the time of transfer to the
Medicine floor from the ICU, and the patient denied muscular
pain at that time.

3. Acute renal failure:  Patient's acute renal failure
resolved with hydration in the Intensive Care Unit and BUN
and creatinine remained within normal limits the remainder of
his hospital stay.  An ACE inhibitor was restarted on the
Medicine floor, and was tolerated well.  Patient also
received nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for
costochondritis which he tolerated well without GI symptoms
or changes in BUN or creatinine.

4. Neurology:  The patient was observed to have a generalized
tonic-clonic seizure on [**2-7**], but had no further
episodes throughout his hospital stay.  Patient was noted to
have short periods of aphasia and staring 2-3 days following
the generalized seizure.  Patient has no history of seizures,
however, and the etiology is likely toxic metabolic.  Patient
is loaded with Dilantin and then maintained on a stable dose.
Patient did not have any evidence of seizure activity
throughout the remainder of his hospital stay.

Workup for the cause of his seizures were negative.  MRI of
the head without contrast on [**2-7**] showed no
