Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3967**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
OptEase IVC filter placement on [**10-9**]


History of Present Illness:
79 yo M with IgA myeloma s/p velcade (incomplete course) and
recent Revlimid, history of PE on warfarin, presented with
shortness of breath with minimal exertion x 2 days similar to
his prior PE episode in [**2169**].
.
Per patient, he reports that he was having worsening lower
extremity edema over the last 3 months.  No pain in his legs.
He had no recent travel.  No cough, pleuritic chest pain, or
chest pain.  Dyspnea and dyspnea on exertion developed over the
course of last 2 days.  Patient thought it was similar to his
prior episode of PE but milder symptoms; therefore, presented
himself to the ED.  Of note, he stopped his Revlimid
.
While in the ED, initial vitals were 98.9 104 194/79 24 92% RA.
Per report EKG showed evidence of right heart strain, new TWI
III, avF, V2-3, and troponin was mildly elevated to 0.04  Given
his symptoms, patient underwent CTA (after receiving IVF) of the
chest which showed PE straddling the bifurcation of the left
pulmonary artery that extends segmental branches.  Per report,
patient was guaic negative.  Subsequently, patient was started
on heparin gtt.  Oncology was consulted who agreed with heparin
and IVC filter placement with + U/S LENIS.  Upon sign out,
reported vitals were 97.8, 18, 95% on 2L, 84, 129/87.
.
On the floor, patient reports feeling better with his breathing.

Microbiology (for fever):
Blood culture negative x2
Urine culture negative

Imaging:

CTA chest:
IMPRESSION: Left nonocclusive pulmonary emboli.

B/L LE US
IMPRESSION:
1. Right posterior tibial deep venous thrombosis.
2. Nonocclusive left popliteal deep venous thrombosis.
3. Left calf veins and right peroneal veins not well evaluated.

IVC OptEase filter placement:
IMPRESSION: Successful placement of an OptEase IVC filter
described above.

Echo:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with depressed
free wall contractility. There is abnormal septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. The aortic root is mildly dilated at
the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Left ventricular systolic
function is probably normal, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be excluded. The right ventricle is at least moderately
dilated with evidence of pressure/volume overload. Pulmonary
artery pressures could not be assessed. Mild aortic
regurgitation.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2171-9-4**], the
right ventricle is now dilated and hypokinetic with evidence of
RV pressure/volume overload.

Brief Hospital Course:
79 yo M with IgA myeloma s/p velcade (incomplete course) and
recent Revlimid, history of PE ([**2169**]) on warfarin, presented
with shortness of breath with minimal exertion x 2 days found to
have left pulmonary artery PE.
.
# Pulmonary Embolism

Patient was initially admitted to the medical ICU for close
monitoring for saddle PE as found on CTA.  IR was consulted and
placed an IVC filter. Pt was started on heparin gtt in setting
of thrombocytopenia given clot burden. Pt was monitored
overnight and then transferred to the inpatient oncology floor.
On the floor, pt remained hemodynamically stable. Echo revealed
new right heart strain.  Pt transitioned from heparin to
lovenox, which he will need life-long as he has failed warfarin.
 Swelling in lower legs decreased dramatically and patient
denied chest pain and endorsed improvement in breathing.
However, pt had 82% O2 saturation while ambulating and was
set-up for home O2.  Will need follow-up as to whether IVC
filter should be removed.  Because pt will be on life-long
anticoagulation, it may be safe to keep in the IVC filter in the
hopes of preventing large clots from entering the pulmonary bed,
however, if patient is to have more chemo or has other reason
for withholding anticoagulation, this will serve as a nidus for
future clots. Pt was told to discuss this issue with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
as this is a retrievable filter, but is often best removed
within a month from placement per IR.
.
# Fever: Pt developed a fever x 1.  Cultured and started on
zosyn and vancomycin. Pt defervesced.  Antibiotics were
discontinued one at a time without recurrence in fever. All
cultures were negative.  Fever was most likely [**1-27**] to
inflammatory response from DVT and PE.
.
# Thrombocytopenia. This was thought most likely [**1-27**] Revlimid.
