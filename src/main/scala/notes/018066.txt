Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
Transferred from [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital for MRSA bacteremia, septic
knee, respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Radial arterial line placement
PICC placement


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 3321**] is a 67 yo man with COPD, morbid obesity, OSA,
h/o coronary artery aneurysm reparin, osteoartritis with recent
B total-knee replacements and septic arthritis who is
transferred from [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital for further management. Mr.
[**Known lastname 3321**] was in his USOH until [**3-31**] when he underwent his TKR.
His post-operative course was complicated by persistant drainage
of fluid from his left knee for which he was placed on
clindamycin as an outpatient, he then developed C diff colitis.
He also developed a stage 4 decubitus ulcer.
.
He was admitted to an OSH on [**4-14**] where he was found to have
MRSA septic arthritis and C diff colitis. He was documented to
be bacteremic with MRSA for much of this time (last blood
culture taken on [**4-20**] was positive 1/4 bottles). He was treated
with vancomycin for the knee infection and underwent removal of
his L knee arthroplasy and placement of a tobramycin spacer on
[**4-20**] (and decubitus ulcer debridement). Post-operatively he has
had continued spiking fevers to 102 and progressive dyspnea. He
has had approximately 40-60 lbs weight-gain since his initial
surgery and has been on bumex IV for diuresis
.
His C diff was initially treated with flagyl but he has had
persistantly + stool, so this was changed to vancomycin. He
denies abdominal pain but has had increasing abdominal
distension.
.
He has had progressive dyspnea, no orthopnea. It appears that he
has been treated for CHF exacerbation with IV bumex and was
placed on BiPAP at 26/20. The patient much prefers being on
BiPAP and has been on it for most of the past 2-3 days.
.
Currently he complains of severe fatigue, no appetite, thirst,
general malaise. He also endorses back and LLE pain. No abdomial
pain, nausea, vomiting. Within an hour of being at [**Hospital1 18**] he was
febrile to 101.5 with 1/4 blood cultures positive for GPCs

Studies:
KNEE (2 VIEWS) BILAT  [**2157-4-24**]
RIGHT KNEE: Three views of the right knee demonstrate
tricompartmental prosthesis in standard position, with no
evidence of loosening or hardware failure. Corticated osseous
density inferolateral to distal femur is likely related to prior
injury or surgery. A 6-mm opacity within the knee joint is may
potentially represent a foreign body. There is an apparent
suprapatellar joint effusion.
LEFT KNEE: Hardware has apparently been removed. A large, 13.6
cm x 7.2 cm diameter lobulated opaque structure extends from the
distal femoral shaft to the proximal tibia and has likely been
surgically placed for the provided history of washout for
treatment of septic left knee joint following knee replacement
procedure. The tibiofemoral joint space has apparently been
obliterated. Apparent diffuse soft tissue swelling is present
within the left lower extremity based upon increased thickness
of the soft tissues compared to the contralateral right
extremity. Additionally, the cortical margin of the
posterior-inferior aspect of the left femur is not well
demonstrated. The possibility of osteomyelitis cannot be
excluded. Direct comparison to previous outside postoperative
radiographs would be helpful. Alternatively, if clinical
suspicion is high, nuclear medicine white blood cell scan or MRI
could be considered.
.
US EXTREMITY NONVASCULAR  [**2157-5-2**]
FINDINGS: Small amount of fluid was noted anterior and superior
to the patella. No definite fluid collection was noted above the
patella to suggest knee joint effusion. Moderate amount of edema
was noted within the anterior thigh region.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2157-4-23**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Limited radiograph due to large body habitus and portable
technique. Apparent widening of mediastinum which may reflect
prominent vascular structures, but standard PA and lateral views
are suggested for more complete assessment of this finding as
well as a peripheral pleural opacity in the left mid lung, when
the patient's condition permits.
2. Likely volume overload.
3. Bilateral effusions.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2157-5-3**]
FINDINGS: AP single view obtained with patient in sitting
semi-upright position is analyzed in comparison with a similar
preceding study of [**5-1**]. There is status post sternotomy, and
there are at least three small surgical clips identified in the
right-sided mediastinum overlying the heart shadow. There is
moderate cardiomegaly, and a rather marked widening and
elongation of the thoracic aorta is present. This coincides with
a congestive vascular pattern and diffuse hazy densities at the
lung bases and most likely representing bilateral pleural
effusions. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The technical
quality of the portable chest examination suffers from the
patient's extreme dimensions (morbid obesity), and discrete
local pneumonic infiltrates cannot be identified with certainty.
Review of the total seven portable chest examinations from [**4-23**] through [**5-1**] is performed. All these studies suffer from
difficulties to penetrate the lungs appropriately. It is noted
that a previously present right jugular vein approach central
venous line has been removed. Also a previously identified
right-sided PICC line remains in unchanged position.
Rather prominent distended azygos vein is compatible with
hypervolemia as mentione
