Pertinent Results:
Reports:
CTA [**9-8**]: No PE. Cardiomegaly and bilateral perihilar ground
glass opacities and septal thickening likely due to CHF. No
pleural or pericardial effusions.

EKG [**9-8**]: sinus brady @ 53bpm, stable LBBB, TWI in I,aVL,V6

CXR [**9-8**]:
IMPRESSION: Improving pulmonary congestion, probably persisting
cardiomegaly, no evidence of chest infiltrates on portable
single view chest examination.

Gastric Lavage [**9-8**]: bright red clots

EGD [**9-9**]:
Impression: Erythema and multiple superficial linear erosions in
the stomach body and antrum compatible with gastritis
Pink filmy material was found in the lower third of the
esophagus. It is unclear if this is from food or other process
(ie [**Female First Name (un) **]). .
Recommendations: The erosions may account for the patient's GI
bleed. The patient should continue PPI [**Hospital1 **] for 6 weeks and then
get a f/u EGD. Avoid NSAIDs. Given patient's recurrent ulcers
and negative H.pylori serology, would check a serum gastrin
level. The patient should be scheduled for a colonoscopy if she
hasn't had one recently (within past 1-2yrs).

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 71 yo F with known CAD s/p MI, LAD stent [**2-/2176**], p/w
unstable angina to OSH, transferred here for possible cath.
.
1.  CP/CAD: Pt was admitted to cardiology service no longer in
chest pain.  At the OSH, she was started on heparin gtt,
nitroglycerin gtt, integrillin, and plavix.  This was stopped in
the setting of GI bleed.  She had a CK that went from 178 down
to 120 on day of admission and TropT that was 0.02 x 2. She
experienced no more chest pain or shortness of breath.  Chest
pain and troponin leak may have been in the setting of demand,
given her GI bleed.  Her medical regimen was optimized, and she
will follow up with her outpatient cardiologist and PCP.

2.  GI bleed: On day of admission, patient experienced a frank
GI bleed with hematocrit dropping as low as 23.1. She was
transported to the MICU, where she received 4 units pRBCs and an
upper endoscopy which showed gastritis as outlined above. Her
hematocrit stabilized in the MICU to 35, and she was transported
back to the cardiology floor, where her hematocrit remained
stable at about 32-36. H. pylori antibody was positive, and
gastrin was pending at time of dishcharged.  Her Protonix was
increased to 40 [**Hospital1 **] (for 1-2 weeks) and ASA/NSAIDS avoided.  She
may restart aspirin in [**12-28**] weeks if hematocrit remains stable.
She will follow up with her outpatient PCP for Colonoscopy and
repeat EGD.

3.  HTN: Upon admission, pt was not significantly hypertensive
as she was on NTG ggt. When she returned to the cardiology
floor, she was hypertensive to SBP above 200. Her lisinopril and
metoprolol were titrated up, she was begun on Imdur and
amlodipine, and she was restarted on her HCTZ.  Renal ultrasound
with doppler showed normal kidneys without evidence of renal
artery stenosis.  Blood pressure was 140-150's (systolic) at
time of discharge.

4.  Renal: Pt with DM2 and received a dye load with CTA. She was
likely volume depleted as well and BUN/Cr ration > 20. Her HCTZ
was held. Her Cr trended back to normal by day of discharge.
She was restarted on her ACEI and HCTZ at time of discharge.

5.  Disposition: She was discharged in good condition, to follow
up with her PCP and cardiologist.
