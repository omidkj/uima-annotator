Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**5-27**] for serial exams.  Her exam deteriorated through
[**5-28**], when she was brought to OR for exploratory laparotomy.
Please refer to op note for details.  She was then sent to the
SICU for further care, which will be reviewed below in an organ
based fashion.

Neuro: minimal sedation with opiates & benzos and treated to
establish comfort.
CV: persistent rapid atrial fibrillation postoperatively.
CK/trop negative.  TEE showed good ventricular fxn & no atrial
thrombi, but no concerted atrial movement.  cards rec'd vs
cardioverting her (either electrically or chemically) secondary
to high clot risk.

Resp: Gradually deteriorated throughout her postoperative course
and had worsening ABG readings.  In the background of her code
status the patient received nasal BiPAP, however did not
tolerate this well with frequent desaturations.  She was then
tried on full face mask and seemed to tolerate this somewhat
better however her gas continued to worsen and she expired due
to respiratory failure on [**7-3**] at 5pm.

FEN: Large fluid requirement postop from septic, distributive
physiology.  Eventually reached 110kg (about 30kg above dry
weight).  Diuresed with lasix & diamox.  Patient also tried on
acetazolamide with limited success.  This was stopped due to her
worsening base deficit as her respiratory status also
deteriorated.

GI: Started on tube feeds POD2, ostomy functional soon
thereafter.  LFTs began to rise about POD7, and ERCP was
consulted.  No ductal dilatation on multiple RUQ US obstruction
vs congestive hepatopathy

Heme: thrombocytopenia of sepsis postop.  HIT negative.  Was
transfused appropriately throughout her hospital stay.

ID: prophylactic antibiotics were given as was fluconazole for
positive cultures for [**Female First Name (un) **]. There were no other positive
cultures to date.

Endo: Patient was maintained on a regular insulin sliding scale
and her blood sugars were noted to be well controlled
throughout.

Dispo: Patient expired in the surgical intensive care unit on
[**7-3**] at 5pm from respiratory collapse and exhaustion.  Her
code status was followed throughout by all involved in her care.
