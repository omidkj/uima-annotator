ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:  Multitrauma, Status post unrestrained
passenger in a
motor vehicle accident.

33 y.o. male with unknown past medical history who was found
unrestrained motor vehicle accident in which he was the
driver.  There was approximately 15 minute extrication time
from the vehicle.  The patient was found to be transiently
hypotensive with systolic blood pressure in the 90s which
responded quickly to approximately 300 cc of fluid
resuscitation.  The patient arrived in the Emergency
complaining of bilateral leg pain and back pain.  He had a
and subsequently had to be intubated to facilitate full
trauma team evaluation.

There was a questionable loss of consciousness during the
accident.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Unknown.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Unknown.

ALLERGIES:  Unknown.

MEDICATIONS:  Unknown.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs revealed pulse 55, blood
pressure 160/48.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat,
atraumatic head with no obvious signs of injury.  Tympanic
membranes were intact.  No blood in the outer ears.  Chest
was clear to auscultation bilaterally, nontender.
Cardiovascular, normal sinus rhythm.  Abdomen was soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Pelvis was stable and tender.
Rectal with normal tone, guaiac negative.  Extremities with
left thigh deformity, palpable dorsalis pedis, posterior
tibial bilaterally, right open tibial-fibula fracture,
palpable posterior tibial but dorsalis pedis was nonpalpable
on the right side.  Back, no obvious stepoff or deformity.

LABORATORY DATA:  Radiographic studies, lateral cervical
spine showed C1 through C7 within normal limits, no obvious
fractures.  The patient did have a left femur displaced,
comminuted fracture and an open Grade 2 right tibia-fibula
fracture.  Computerized tomography scan of the head was
negative.  Computerized tomography scan of the neck was also
negative.  The patient had thoracolumbosacral films
subsequently which showed approximately 10% compression
fracture of T12.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was seen in the Trauma Bay by
the Trauma Team where a full trauma evaluation was carried
out.  He was started on intravenous fluids for resuscitation
and then was taken to the Operating Room for fixation of his
left femur and right tibia-fibula fractures.  He had left
femur intramedullary rodding, he had transverse femoral shaft
fracture and a washout and fibular rodding of the right open
tibia-fibula fracture.  The patient tolerated the procedure
well and postoperatively was transferred to the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit where he remained stable for the next few
days.  He was subsequently extubated at which time he
complained of back pain.  Orthopedic Spine was once again
consulted and recommendation for TLSO brace to be worn when
out of bed for six to twelve weeks was made.  The patient was
subsequently fitted for a TLSO.

The toxicology screen during the common workup was positive
for alcohol and the patient also has a history of
recreational drug use.  The patient was postoperatively noted
to have troponin leak with a troponin of 2.6 in the Surgery
Intensive Care Unit.  The Cardiology was consulted and they
felt that the patient had a cardiac contusion in the setting
of a motor vehicle accident.  He had persistent delirium
through [**9-10**] to 24 which is attributed to either
questionable head injury or over sedation from opioids or
benzodiazepines and it was felt unlikely to represent alcohol
withdrawal.  His mental status improved by [**10-5**].  On
[**10-6**], he was noted to have left upper extremity
weakness and diminished left biceps and brachioradialis
reflexes.  He had subsequent magnetic resonance imaging scan
of the head, demonstrated diffuse axonal injury, magnetic
resonance imaging scan of the neck with C5-6 and C6-7 disc
protrusion.  On [**2171-10-10**] he underwent surgical
decompression of these herniations.  On [**10-11**], the
patient started complaining of some dyspnea at rest
associated with some left-sided chest discomfort.  His oxygen
saturations were a little lower than what they had been.  He
was 93% on room air.  His electrocardiogram showed a
persistent sinus tachycardia, inferior T waves without acute
change from previous study.  Medicine was consulted and they
felt that the patient had left lower lobe pneumonia.  He was
started on Ceftriaxone 1 gm intravenously q. 24 which
subsequently will be switched to Levaquin 500 mg p.o. q. day
for 14 days upon the patient's discharge.  On [**2171-10-14**] the patient had swallow study requested for the
patient's continued inability to swallow.  Speech swallow saw
the patient and recommended pureed diet with thick liquid,
positioning the patient upright for meals, staff supervision
at the time of meals and also a video-assisted swallowing
study.  Neurology was also consulted on [**10-15**] regarding
the patient's continued mental state.  He was unable to carry
out a normal thought process.  He was unable to recall why he
was in the hospital and was perseverating about hunger and
not being able to call for help.  Neurology consult saw the
patient and felt that his behavior represented diffuse axonal
injury and residual shortterm neurological deficit.  They
recommended follow up in Behavioral Neurology Unit for
longterm cognitive neurologic issues as well as follow up in
the General [**Hospital 878**] Clinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  They felt
that the patient needed cognitive rehabilitation as well as
physical rehabilitation.  The patient otherwise made steady
progress while in the hospital.  A rehabilitation bed was
obtained for him and he was transferred to rehabilitation on
[**2171-10-17**].

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d., hold for systolic blood
pressure less than 100 and heartrate less than 55

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Specific treatment and frequency -
The patient will be touch-down weightbearing on the right and
left lower extremity.  He will TLSO for ten weeks when out of
bed.

Follow up appointments:
1.  Follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**] in two weeks, please call his
office to schedule an appointment, office # [**Telephone/Fax (1) 36310**].
2.  Follow up in Behavioral Neurology Unit for longterm
cognitive/neurologic issues.
3.  Follow up in the General [**Hospital 878**] Clinic with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].  Please call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2756**] to reach Dr.[**Name (NI) 36311**]
