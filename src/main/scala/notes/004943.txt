Chief Complaint:
hypotension, AFib

History of Present Illness:
 Ms. [**Known firstname 110553**] [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old Persian speaking woman with a
history of CLL and non-Hodkins lymphoma s/p chemotherapy and
recent recurrence of herpes zoster with subsequent postherpetic
neuralgia.

Pt states that 2 weeks ago while staying at her families house
for [**Hospital1 **] holidays she slipped while getting out of the shower.
She hit her head in a glancing fashion on the wall and fell on
her backside. She did not lose conciousness or bleed. A
bruise/bump developed on her head. She was not brought to the
hospital or to a doctor's office initially because the family
wanted to watch her and see if she got better. Initially she had
some pain in her lower back, sacrum, and bilateral legs but was
still able to ambulate with a cane as she does at home baseline.
However, as days went by the pain in her buttocks and bilateral
extermities has worsened to the point that for the past 4-5 days
she has been unable to ambulate with her cane. Because of these
worsening symptoms she finally came to the hospital. She states

In ED initial vital signs were T 98.2 HR 90 RR 16 BP 134/70 SpO2
97% RA. She underwent CXR, bilateral hip x-ray, CT abd/pelvis,
CT head, MRI C-T-L Spine. Labs were significant for WBC of 11.3,
negative cardiac enzymes, chem 7 within normal limits, and UA
with moderate blood. Neurology team was consulted and examined
pt. They reported normal rectal tone with an essentially normal
neuro exam except for slightly decreased muscle bulk. No UMN
signs. They did not walk pt. They recommended C-spine and
L-spine MRI and admission for pain control. Patient received
dilaudid IV and zofran prior to her transfer to the Medicine
Service.

Upon arrival at the medical floor pt was immediately given IV
dilaudid for pain. Persian interpreter was called and came to
interpreter had to leave after a pre-set amount of time and not
all desired information was able to be gathered while she was
there, but all of the above information was gathered through the
interpreter.

Updated info per grandson [**Name (NI) **]: Pt fell 1-2 weeks ago and was
okay post fall. Hit head and landed on buttocks but was able to
ambulate around normally the next day and had been doing
fine/improving until yesterday at when she suddenly developed
pain in lower back, buttocks, and bilateral lower extermities
that became excruciating later in the day. This pain did not
feel like her zoster pain. Pt was unable to move legs and had to
be carried out to the car and [**Last Name (un) 4662**] to the hospital. Pt had one
episode of uninary incontinence after acute pain onset. No stool
incontinence. Pt has been drinking plenty of fluid and making
uring over the last week.

Pt contracted shingles 1 month ago and was receiving gabapentin
and fentanyl patch for shingles pain - these helped although
somewhat loopy with fentanyl. Shingles seemed to be improving
recently and rash had scabbed over but had been down entire left
leg starting at hip. Otherwise she has been very healthy with
reports of only CLL and some respiratory problems with a few bad
PNAs per the grandson. At baseline he says she is very active
and dose much of the cooking and laundry in the house.

On the morning of [**10-28**], she went into atrial fibrillation with
RVR with HRs in the 160s - 180s; she developed a rate related
LBBB at this time and was not otherwise symptomatic.   Her blood
pressure at this time dipped to 80s-100s systolic.  She received
1.5 L of IVF with no significant improvement in her blood
pressure.  2.5 mg of IV diltiazem was given with restoration of
sinus rhythm almost immediately.  Her BP however failed to
improve despite sinus rhythm with BPs continuing to be 80s-100s.
 Her O2 sats were holding 90s-95 % on 2 L.  Given her new onset
atrial fibrillation, especially in setting of recent bedrest and
fracture, a CTA was ordered but has not yet been performed.
Given her persistent hypotension with no improvement in BP
following fluids, she was transferred to MICU for further
monitoring.
