Date of Birth:   [**2161-12-25**]       Sex:  M

Service:  Trauma

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 35-year-old man
who was working underneath a car supported by a car [**Doctor Last Name **] that
became unstable, fell and crushed the patient in the right
decubitus position.  He remained underneath for approximately
10 minutes.  When he was freed he was found to be
unresponsive with agonal breathing.  EMS arrived and on the
scene the patient was found to be in pulseless electrical
activity.  He was intubated, needle decompressed bilaterally,
and resuscitation was begun.  He was emergently brought to
the [**Hospital1 69**] where he was found
to have a GCS of 3, was intubated and unresponsive.  In the
field systolic blood pressure was in the 120-170 range per
report.  Heart rate was in the 130s.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Unknown.

MEDICATIONS:  Unknown.

ALLERGIES:  Unknown.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon entry to the trauma bay the
patient was intubated, heart rate 110, blood pressure 186/90,
saturation was 81%.  On initial examination he was markedly
cyanotic.  Pupils were 3 mm, nonreactive, tympanic membranes
were clear bilaterally.  Neck was with trachea midline,
cervical collar in place, no crepitus.  Chest had breath
sounds bilaterally with needles in the bilateral second
intercostal spaces anteriorly.  Heart was regular,
tachycardic.  Abdomen was soft, with O- fast.  Pelvis was
stable.  Rectal was normal tone, guaiac negative.  The
patient had no deformities of the extremities.  They were
warm, 2+ radial pulses, and 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses
bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission his hematocrit was 36,
platelet count of 259, BUN of 5, creatinine of 0.9.  Arterial
blood gases were 7.20, 48, 70, 20 and -9.  Toxicology screen
was negative.

RADIOLOGIC FILMS:  AP Chest showed bilateral pneumothoraces,
subcutaneous emphysema, multiple rib fractures.  The head CT
showed no intracranial hemorrhage.  A chest CT did not
demonstrate any PE, but did show the multiple rib fractures
of the right third, fourth, and fifth ribs.  A CT of the
abdomen demonstrated no intra-abdominal injury.  CT of the
cervical spine showed no evidence of acute fracture or
subluxation.  CT of the talus demonstrated no fracture or
subluxation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the trauma bay the patient was
resuscitated.  Bilateral chest tubes were placed.  The
endotracheal tube was repositioned, and the patient was
brought to the trauma intensive care unit for monitoring and
resuscitation.  A pulmonary artery catheter was placed in the
intensive care unit for optimization of the hemodynamics to
ensure good cerebral perfusion.  Cardiology was consulted and
they performed a transthoracic echocardiogram that
demonstrated no pericardial effusion and declined left
ventricular function, which appeared global, with an ejection
fraction of 30%.  Neurosurgery was consulted.  They opted to
monitor the patient with frequent neurological checks.

Over the next several days the patient remained
hemodynamically stable but became increasingly difficult to
monitor secondary to sedation requirements.  On hospital day
two neurosurgery placed [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] bolt with an opening
pressure of [**12-12**] cm of water.  Over the next several days
the patient's management was optimized to maintain an ICP of
less than 20 cm of water.  This was achieved using Mannitol
as needed, paralytics and sedation.  He remained
hemodynamically stable and after close monitoring with the
bolt, by hospital day four, neurosurgery removed the bolt and
recommended lightening sedation.  At the same time the
patient's hemodynamics remained stable and the patient's PA
catheter was changed to a triple-lumen catheter.

The patient's intensive care unit course has otherwise been
significant for the following:  The patient has had
ventilator-dependent respiratory failure and MRSA pneumonia
for which he has been on vancomycin.  Due to difficulty of
weaning the ventilatory support, the patient underwent
percutaneous tracheostomy tube placement that he tolerated
well.  He has been undergoing a slow vent wean, and will
require further vent and respiratory care in a rehabilitation
facility.  His MRSA pneumonia has been treated with eight
days of vancomycin for which he is going to complete a 14-day
course.  Pulmonary toilet is being achieved via tracheostomy
tube suction.  The patient also underwent a percutaneous
gastrostomy tube placement, for which he is receiving tube
feeds at goal.  The patient also had bilateral chest tubes
removed with no residual pneumothorax or effusion and stable
respiratory status.

The patient's neurologic status has slowly improved.  He
currently spontaneously opens his eyes and has some
purposeful movement of his left lower extremity.  He will
intermittently appear to follow commands but not consistently
so.  At this point the patient will require neurological
rehabilitation secondary to what is likely an anoxic brain
injury from his arrest at the time of the trauma.  The
patient otherwise has remained stable and is ready for
discharge to rehabilitation for a slow ventilatory wean and
neurological rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Status post chest crush injury.
2. Cardiopulmonary arrest.
3. Anoxic brain injury.
4. MRSA pneumonia/ventilator-dependent respiratory failure
status post percutaneous tracheostomy.
5. Status post percutaneous gastrostomy tube.
6. Bilateral pneumothoraces status post bilateral chest
tubes.
7. Sputum growing Citrobacter (on levofloxacin).

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Prevacid per gastrostomy tube 30 mg q.d.
2. Lovenox 40 mg subcutaneous q.d.
3. Impact with fiber at 85 cc an hour.
4. Insulin sliding scale.
5. Clonidine patch.

CARE RECOMMENDATIONS:  Ventilatory wean and neurological
rehabilitation.
