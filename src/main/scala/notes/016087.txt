CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath, nausea, weakness.

HI[**Last Name (STitle) 2710**]OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 82-year-old woman who
over the month prior to admission has had several episodes of
severe weakness, mild nausea and shortness of breath.  They
often occur at rest and are associated with lightheadedness.
They last for several minutes and resolve spontaneously after
the patient is at rest.  She does report mild chest
discomfort during these episodes.  She has not noticed any
worsening of symptoms on exertion.  The patient was referred
by her primary care to get an exercise tolerance test.  This
was significant for lateral ST changes persisting for 12
minutes into recovery.  She exercised for two minutes and
then developed chest discomfort and shortness of breath.  She
was then referred for a cardiac catheterization.  Coronary
angiography showed a right dominant system with an left
anterior descending of 60% lesion, left circumflex with a
tight 90% lesion, right coronary artery completely occluded
receiving collaterals from the left.  The left ventricular
ejection fraction was 64%.  She was then referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2546**] office for evaluation for a coronary artery bypass
graft.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension,
osteoarthritis, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease.

cholecystectomy and status post hernia repair.

rhythm with QS depressions in V2 and V3.  There is frequent
ectopic beats and nonspecific ST changes.  This is suggestive
of an old inferior myocardial infarction.
