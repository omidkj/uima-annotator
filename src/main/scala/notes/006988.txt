HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67 year old
gentleman transferred from an outside hospital with an
intraventricular hemorrhage into the left third lateral
ventricle.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Squamous cell lung CA status post
lobectomy and XRT, hypertension, coronary artery disease,
peripheral vascular disease, COPD, left carotid occlusion,
right carotid stenosis.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin, diltiazem, lovastatin,
Combivent, amitriptyline and metoprolol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient
was afebrile. Vital signs were stable. The patient was
sleepy, awake, alert and oriented times two, following
commands in all four extremities. Pupils are equal, round and
reactive to light 3 down to 2 mm. Grasps were full. His
strength was [**5-13**] in all muscle groups.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was admitted to the ICU and had an
MRI/MRA of the head with and without gadolinium that showed
no underlying lesion. The patient had a ventriculostomy drain
placed at admission. The patient also had CTA which showed no
obvious vascular malformation and also an angio which again
showed no obvious vascular malformation. The angio did show
left subclavian steal syndrome, left carotid occlusion and
left subclavian stenosis. Post-angio, the patient was awake,
alert and following commands. Grasps were full. Pupils are
equal, round and reactive to light. EOM's were full. His
right groin was clean, dry and intact with no evidence of
hematoma. The patient was extubated on [**2123-1-19**] and
following commands. Drain was decreased to 10 cc an hour for
24 hours to help drain large amounts of blood from the CSF.
The patient had a chest x-ray on [**1-19**] that showed interval
increase in prominence of the parenchymal opacities within
the left mid and lower lung zones, small left pleural
effusion and increased left retrocardiac densities which
could reflect atelectasis. The patient's vital signs remained
stable and he remained neurologically stable. On [**2123-1-21**],
the patient had a bedside swallow evaluation and was felt to
be safe for thin liquids with pureed solids. The patient was
told that he should sit bolt upright for all meals and
upgrade to soft solids once he was more awake. He was seen by
Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy and felt to require
a short rehab stay. He had repeat head CT that was stable
with stable size ventricles. The drain was discontinued by
the patient himself on [**2123-1-18**]. The patient was
transferred to the regular floor on [**2123-1-20**]. He remains
neurologically stable, awake, alert and oriented times three.
Repeat head CT showed no increase in size of the ventricles.
The patient is awake. His incision is clean, dry and intact.
His repeat head CT on [**2123-1-26**] results are pending. He
remained neurologically stable and is felt to require a short
rehab stay prior to discharge to home.
