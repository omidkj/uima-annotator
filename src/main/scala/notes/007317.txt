ADDENDUM:  This is an Addendum to the previous Discharge
Summary.

As per previous Discharge Summary dictation (which was
dictated by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**2126-1-4**]), the
plan at that time was for the patient to be discharged to
rehabilitation.

However, on the evening of [**2126-1-6**] the patient
developed increasing abdominal distention with concern
obstruction versus ileus.  Hospital course since that time
has been as follows.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM
(CONTINUED):

1.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient continued to do well with
tracheostomy.  Occasional suctioning of secretions was
required.  Nebulizer treatments were increased to as needed
which the patient tolerated well.

2.  STATUS POST FALL/FRACTURE ISSUES:  The patient was
maintained on halo throughout his hospital course.  On
[**2126-1-14**] I contact[**Name (NI) **] Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital6 5016**]
regarding care of the patient's halo.  Per this neurosurgeon,
the halo does not have to be tightened for approximately two
more weeks.  The patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an
outpatient.  In addition, I contact[**Name (NI) **] the orthopaedic surgeon
at [**Hospital6 5016**] who had set the patient's right
olecranon fracture.  The patient will follow up with this
physician in one to two weeks.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  The patient continued to be
stable cardiovascularly throughout the remainder of the
hospitalization.  He was mildly hypertensive, so an ACE
inhibitor was added to his medication regimen as the patient
is also diabetic.  The patient has tolerated this well with
good control of his blood pressure.

3.  ENDOCRINE ISSUES:  Following development of the ileus,
the patient's thyroid-stimulating hormone was rechecked.  It
was found to be high at 9.3, despite being normal at 0.81 on
[**2125-12-30**].  At that time, his levothyroxine was
increased to 212.5 mcg by mouth once per day.   This will be
rechecked in five to six weeks.

4.  RENAL ISSUES:  The patient had no further issues.

5.  GASTROINTESTINAL ISSUES:  As previously mentioned, the
patient developed increasing abdominal distention on the
evening of [**2126-1-4**].  A Surgery consultation was
obtained at that time.  A KUB was suggestive of obstruction
versus ileus.

On [**2126-1-7**] a gastrograph enema was obtained which
was negative for an obstruction.  The ileus was most likely
due to prolonged narcotic use for the patient's pain status
post fracture.  Hypothyroidism may also have played a roll.
The patient was made nothing by mouth and started on total
parenteral nutrition for nutrition.  The Surgery Service and
Gastroenterology Service followed on a regular basis.
Consideration was given to giving the patient neostigmine for
the ileus.  However, it resolved on its own over the course
of the next week with decreased abdominal distention,
increased stool output, and no nausea or vomiting.

Over the last three to four days, the patient's diet has
slowly been advanced, and he has tolerated this well.

6.  DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient's blood sugars
were well controlled on metformin and a regular insulin
sliding-scale.

7.  PULMONARY EMBOLISM ISSUES:  The patient is anticoagulated
at this time on Coumadin.  He will need to continue to have
coagulations checked as an outpatient at rehabilitation.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.
