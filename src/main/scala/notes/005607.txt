History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 70072**] is a 71 yo male who with a PMH of hypertension and
MI, who presents with back pain of 2 weeks duration.  He states
that he first noticed that something was wrong a couple of weeks
ago, after eating eating ice cream and drinking ice water at
night.  Later that night, after going to bed and falling asleep,
he was woken with a strange feeling which he describes as a
curtain descending down over his abdomen.  He states it felt as
if his body, in the region of his abdomen, had just shut down.
He fell back asleep the night, hoping that the strange feeling
would go away on its own.  Over the next few days, he began to
notice a pain in his upper back.  He describes that pain as
similar to a muscle spasm, in his back, that does not radiate.
When the pain first began, it was intermittent and could be
brought on by nearly anything, including getting up to walk and
eating.  He tried Advil and acetominophen which helped at first
to relieve his pain.  He noticed that his pain gradually became
more intense, and more intolerable.  He reports occasional chest
pain, shortness of breath, and feeling feverish when his pain
would become severe. At the time of presentation to an OSH, his
pain was constant, not relieved with Advil or acetominophen, and
he reports it as a [**9-26**].  He also developed a dry,
non-productive cough over the past 2-3 days, and a feeling of
nausea that developed when he would cough.  At times, when the
pain would become severe, he began to feel feverish and
developed sweats.  He reports that his last bowel movement was
nearly a week ago.  Patient reports that he was in Tripoli,
North [**Country 480**] in the [**2044**]'s during the Korean war.  Recalls one
episode of walking pneumonia, nearly 20 years ago, was not
hospitalized.  Recalls no episodes of hemoptysis.  He estimates
that he has lost ~10 pounds over the past two months due to
decreased appetite and pain with eating.  He denies chills,
night sweats, changes in vision, headache, shortness of breath,
chest pain, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, numbness,
parasthesias.

Social History:
Divorced. Used to work in the stock market, retired for 20
years.  Has three sons and one daughter.  Former heavy smoker,

Pertinent Results:
MRI C/T/L spine [**2100-11-29**]:
MRI OF THE CERVICAL SPINE WITH GADOLINIUM:
There is no evidence of disc infection.  There is degenerative
disc disease at multiple levels.
At C4-C5, there is a small central disc protrusion without
evidence of canal or foraminal stenosis.
At C5-C6, there is a broad-based disc-osteophyte bar producing
moderate canal and moderate bilateral foraminal stenosis.
At C6-C7, there is mild retrolisthesis producing moderate canal
and moderate bilateral foraminal stenosis.  There is no evidence
of abnormal cord signal or abnormal cord enhancement.
IMPRESSION:  Multilevel degenerative disease as described.
.
MRI OF THE THORACIC SPINE WITH GADOLINIUM:
IMPRESSION:  Paraspinal mass with vertebral body involvement at
T7-T8.  There is involvement of the disc, and there is an
epidural mass.  The features in general suggest that this may be
a malignant process rather than an active infection, although
granulomatous disease would be an additional consideration.  The
findings are a bit unusual for bacterial abscess, but this is
not entirely excluded.
.
MRI OF THE LUMBAR SPINE:
IMPRESSION:  First degree spondylolisthesis at L5-S1.  Mild disc
bulging.  No evidence of focal disc protrusion.  No evidence of
a destructive mass or abscess in the lumbar region.
.
CT T-spine w/o contrast [**2100-11-30**]:
Again seen is destruction of the inferior one-half of T7 and
superior endplate of T8 with a large associated paraspinal mass.
 There is a small epidural component as well as retropulsion of
bone fragments into the
ventral part of the spinal canal.  The degree of cord
compression is better evaluated on the previous day's MRI.
Again noted is kyphotic angulation of the thoracic spine at this
locale.  No new abnormalities are identified. There are
emphysematous changes in the lungs.  Aortic calcifications are
identified.
.
CT abdomen/pelvis [**2100-12-2**]:
CT ABDOMEN:  The gallbladder is distended likely due to fasting.
 However,
clinical correlation is recommended.  The liver, spleen, and
pancreas are
unremarkable.  The small 11-mm left adrenal gland nodule is not
well
characterized in this study.  The right adrenal gland is normal.
 Small
hypodense area at the interpolar region of the right kidney is
too small to be characterized.  Small and large bowel are
grossly unremarkable.  There is a moderate amount of stool
within the colon.  The appendix is within normal limits.  Severe
calcifications of the aorta.  All the major branches are patent.
 No free fluid or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
CT PELVIS:  Urinary bladder, distal ureters are unremarkable.
No free fluid or free air in the pelvis.  Calcifications within
the prostate. Small segment of chronic dissection involving both
proximal common ilia
arteries.
.
TTE [**2100-12-6**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. LVEF=55%.  The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with focal near akinesis of the basal half of the inferolateral
wall. The remaining segments contract well. Transmitral Doppler
and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild)
LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular cavity size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No systolic prolapse is seen. No mass or vegetation
is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is top
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
