Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer from cath lab for acute pulmonary edema s/p cath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization with Drug Eluting Stent Placement.


History of Present Illness:
73 yo male with past medical history significant for CAD s/p
CABG, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, and peripheral vascular disease PVD was
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital3 3583**] with after having had
[**6-23**] substernal chest pain. Patient was initially admitted to
[**Hospital3 3583**] on [**2180-1-30**] with a COPD exacerbation and a right
lower lobe pneumonia, being treated with IV antibiotics,
steroids, and nebulizer treatment. On [**2180-2-1**], patient
experienced [**6-23**] substernal chest pain with associated bilateral
arm numbness and troponin I of 11. He initially received
morphine and ativan without relief and then received 5mg IV
metoprolol and IV nitroglycerine with relief. On 12.20, patient
found to have troponin I with 83.41 and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for cardiac catheterization.
.
At cardiac cath, patient found to have the following: 3 vessel
native coronary artery disease; LMCA 50% distal in-stent
restenosis; LAD occluded proximally; LCX 60% at its origin with
occluded OM branches except for OM3 which was occluded distally;
RCA known to be occluded and not selectively engaged; LIMA-LAD
widely patent to distal LAD. SVG-RCA was known to be occluded
and was not engaged selectively.
The SVG-D-OM had an ulcerated 80% stenosis at the diagnoal
origin and
widely patent OM stent. Patient had a drug eluting stent placed
(Cypher 3.5 x 18) to the SVG-Diag-OM. 170cc dye used during
procedure and hemodynamics not performed (Aortic pressure 145/74
with HR 73). Post cath course complicated by development of
acute shortness of breath, diaphoresis, and respiratory
distress, thought likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema.
Patient started on a NRB and received 60mg furosemide IV total
(20 then 40), morphine 5mg, and was started on a nitro drip for
elevated blood pressures to SBPs to 190s.
.
Upon arrival to the floor, patient was started on BiPap but had
persistent respiratory distress with use of accessory muscles
and increased CO2 retention, as seen on ABG (7.29 / 59 / 160).
Patient was intubated with anesthesia and started on propafol
for sedation. With increased sedation, patient also became
hypotensive to SBPs 70s-80s and was started on dopamine for
blood pressure support.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
73 year old man with IDDM and COPD who was admitted to the CCU
after presumed flash pulmonary edema , intubated, s/p tube
repositioning
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please re-eval postition of ngt and ett (was ~ 6cm above [**Female First Name (un) 5309**])

CHEST: Status post intubation for flash pulmonary edema. Check
endotracheal tube position.

COMPARISON: Film performed at 18:45 same day.

Tip of the endotracheal tube is in good position, 4.5 cm above
the carina. There is blunting of both costophrenic angles which
is new consistent with bilateral pleural effusions. There is new
focal opacity behind the left side of the heart consistent with
atelectasis or infiltrate. Tip of the NG tube is in the stomach.

IMPRESSION: Tubes in good position.

Interval development of new bilateral pleural effusions and new
left lower lobe opacity. There is moderate pulmonary vascular
redistribution, likely due to the supine technique.
CARDIAC CATH - [**2180-2-2**]
BRIEF HISTORY:
This 72 year old gentleman with known coronary artery disease
status
post CABG with LIMA to LAD, SVG to D and OM, SVG to RCA. He
subsequently
had cypher stents placement to the LMCA/LAD and SVG to D and OM.
He is
transferred from outside hospital following admission for
pneumonia and
was noted to have NSTEMI after complaining of chest pain.

INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:

of the
right femoral artery, using a 5 French left [**Last Name (un) 2699**] catheter,
advanced
to the ascending aorta through a 5 French introducing sheath.
Coronary Angiography: was performed in multiple projections
using a 5
French JL4 and a 5 French JR4 catheter, with manual contrast
injections.
Graft Angiography: of 1 saphenous vein bypass grafts was
performed using
a 5 French left amplatz catheter, with manual contrast
injections.
Arterial Conduit Angiography:  of a left internal mammary artery
graft
was performed using a preformed [**Female First Name (un) 899**] catheter, with manual
contrast
injections.
Percutaneous coronary revascularization was performed using
placement of
drug-eluting stent(s).
Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring
performed by
a member of the nursing staff.
