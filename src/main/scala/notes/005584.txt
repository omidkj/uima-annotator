Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
Generalized weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This is a 81 M with pmh of ESRD on HD, AFib, CHF, C diff
colitis, h/o klebsiella urosepsis, recent MRSA line infection
presented after slipping from his bed due to bilateral lower
extremity weakness.  Patient had his last HD thursday where his
BP was low and experienced chills.  He was recommended to go the
ED but refused.  His BCx were drawn and was given 1 gram of
vancomycin according to nephrology notes. Yesterday he felt
generalized weakness and slipped out of his bed while trying to
get out.  No truama and landed on his buttocks.  He experienced
transient chest pain two days ago but unable to give any more
details about it.  He had stool without knowing yesterday.  No
diarrhea.  Today he experienced abdominal discomfort transiently
which resolved without any intervention.  He is unable to give
any more details about it.  He again slipped today and his wife
was able to convince him to come to the Emergency Department.
He was sleepy since yesterday and this is a sign of him getting
sick per wife.
.
In the ED his vitals were T 96.9  BP 64/39  HR 93  RR 20  98% on
2L NC.  His BP improved to 92/74 after 2LNS.  His baseline blood
pressure is in 90s.  He received 1 gram of vancomycin, zosyn 4.5
mg once, and aspirin 325 mg daily.
.
On arrival to MICU his vitals were T 96.8  HR 86  BP 80/53 to
93/54 without intervention 95% on 3LNC

He denies any fever, chills, nightsweats, current chestpain,
abdominal pain, nausea, vomitting, palpiatations, focal weakness
or numbness.  He makes some urine and denies any dysuria,
hematuria.  No blood in stool.

Pertinent Results:
EKG: afib with vent rate in 90s, LAD, PVC, no acute ST-T changes
compared to [**2125-10-22**].
.
CXR [**2125-12-1**]:
Low lung volumes, with no acute abnormalities.
.
[**2125-12-1**] CT abdomen/pelvis:
1. Enlarged gallbladder with a trace amount of pericholecystic
fluid. There is no cholelithiasis or choledocholithiasis.
Overall, these findings are equivocal for acute cholecystitis
and in the right clinical setting,
correlation with ultrasound is recommended.
2. Chronic dissection and aneurysmal dilation of the left common
and external iliac arteries.

[**2125-12-11**] HIDA Scan:
1. No evidence of cholecystitis. 2. Normal gallbladder function
and
ejection fraction.

[**2125-12-10**] Tunnelled Line Placement:
Successful placement of a 15.5 French tunneled dialysis catheter

with 23-cm tip-to-cuff length via left internal jugular vein
with the tip
positioned in the right atrium. The catheter is ready to use.

[**2125-12-7**] RUE U/S: 1. Findings consistent with acute right IJ
thrombosis.

[**2125-12-7**] Bilateral LE U/S:
Findings consistent with chronic left SFV thrombus. Nonocclusive

echogenic material within the right distal SFV, a son[**Name (NI) 493**]
appearance more consistent with old thrombus, but age
indeterminate.

[**2125-12-3**] RUQ U/S:
Distended gallbladder with sludge, and minimal wall thickening.

No definite evidence of acute cholecystitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 12731**] is an 81 yo male with pmh of ESRD on HD, AFib,
CHF,diverticulosis, h/o klebsiella and ecoli sepsis who was
admitted with generalized weakness and hypotension, found to
have recurrant E. coli sepsis.

1)Multi-drug resistent Ecoli sepsis:  He was initially admitted
to the MICU as he was hypotensive with SBP 70's which improved
with IVF.  He was initially treated with vanocomycin and
meropenam however vanc was stopped once culture data returned.
Etiology of recurrant ecoli sepsis unclear, however it appears
to be the same bacteria given that resistance profile is the
same.   He was investigated for possible biliary source, however
this does not appear to be a potential source given his normal
HIDA scan.  He had ultrasound to evaluate for possible infected
thrombus.  He was found to have a right IJ thrombus.  As a
result his right IJ tunnelled dialysis line was removed in order
to facilitate clot resolution.  Culture of the dialysis line tip
was without growth.  His urine culture was negative making
urinary source unlikely. He was treated with meropenam during
his hospitalization and then discharged on ertampenam to
complete a four week course, starting from his first negative
blood culture which was on [**2125-12-2**] with last day of therapy
[**2124-12-29**].  All further surveillance culturese were without
growth.  His last day of ertapenam will be [**2125-12-16**].  He will
need evaluate of CBC with diff, Chem 7 and LFT's weekly at
dialysis while on ertapenam.  Anticoagulation was considered and
briefly started however given his significant h/o diverticular
bleeding causing discontinuation of anticoagulation in the past
it was stopped.  It was thought that his RIJ clot may dissolve
once line removed.  He was scheduled for follow-up right upper
extremity ultrasound on [**2124-12-23**].  He was discharged on ertepenam
to complete antibiotic course, 500mg IM on non-dialysis days and
500mg IV on dialysis days, to be given at dialysis after he
completes his dialysis session.

2)Acute on Chronic heart failure - per recent echocardiogram
report appears consistent with cor pulmonale (? [**1-20**] long
untreated OSA), likely with current mild decompensation given
pulmonary congestion and left sided effusion new since
admission, likely [**1-20**] volume resuscitation.  He was treated with
dialysis for fluid removal and was euvolemic by discharge.

3)ESRD/HD: dialysis schedule is T/Th/S, new left tunnelled line
placed on [**2125-12-10**].  Previous right IJ tunnelled line removed
given RIJ thrombus.  He has plans for AV fistula by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 816**]
however concern is to determine source of recurrant bacteremia
before placing AV fistula.  He will need ertapenam after
dialysis on dialysis days as well as weekly CBC with diff, chem
7 and LFT's while on ertapenam.

4)Sleep apnea: He was encouraged to use CPAP however refused
throughout his adm
