she was in her normal state of health until two days prior to

Today, the pt reports that the headache worsened and was the
"worse headache ever". She denies any photophobia or visual
changes (her vision is not clear at baseline which she
attributes to needing new glasses). Pt reports that she had a
fever at home but is unclear how high this was. She also felt
nauseated but did not vomit. Pt denies any recent sick contact.

left sided abdominal pain last Friday and yesterday but resolves
spontaneously. None today. Has diarrheal alternating with formed
stools at baseline. This has not changed.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Bacterial meningitis. Pt with evidence of bacterial
meningitus by LP. Received ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and decadron
initially.  Blood cultures from [**Location (un) **] grew H. influenzae (CSF
culture remained negative, but she had received antibiotics
prior to LP).  She was continued on Ceftriaxone 2 mg q12 for a
total of 14 days (some of this completed as an outpatient).  She
ended up getting only 3 doses of dexamethasone.  She had a
persistent headache after the LP which was concerning; MRI was
obtained which was negative for meningeal enhancement or abscess
(showed only possible sinus disease).  She remained afebrile and
her WBC improved (as did her headache).  Repeat LP was not
performed due to clinical improvement and negative MRI.  She was
stable at time of discharge and will complete a 14 day course of
antibiotics via midline with VNA assistance.  ID followed the
patient while in-house.

2. Pneumonia. Pt with increased oxygen requirement since arrival
from OSH. CXR was positive for pneumonia (LLL).  In addition to
the ceftriaxone, she received 4 days of azithromycin to cover
atypical pneumonia.  She was saturating stably on room air at
time of discharge.

3. [**Name (NI) 1069**] Pt with chronic diarrhea that has not been
evaluated. Stool studies, including C. difficile, were all
negative.  Bowel symptoms were improved at time of discharge.

4.  Headache: She had a persistent headache post-tap, thought to
be post LP headache.  MRI was negative, as above, for meningeal
enhancement or abscess.  She received tylenol, 1 dose of IV
caffeine, and was started on oxycontin (with oxycodone PRN)
prior to discharge.  On this regimen, her headache was improved.

5. Cardiac- Question if pt has cardiac disease given history of
angina. There were also signs of heart failure on chest X-ray.
TTE was obtained that showed preserved systolic function,
possible impairment in relaxation, and inferior hypokinesis.,
EKG did not show inferior q waves, however, given these possible
inferior wall motion abnormalities.

6.  Disposition: She was discharged, to complete a 14-day course
of ceftriaxone.  Midline was placed prior to discharge, and she
will have VNA assistance for administration of antibiotics.
