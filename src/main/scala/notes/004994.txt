Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] Spine Surgery Service on
[**2199-4-23**] and taken to the Operating Room for the above procedure
performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1352**] & Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1007**]. During the
procedure he sustained a small dural tear that was repaired
primarily. Surgical EBL was 1000cc, he received 4L of
crystalloid and urine output was 1460cc. Dark red hematuria was
noted during the case and was presumed secondary to traumatic
foley insertion in the setting of baseline BPH. Please refer to
the dictated operative note for further details. The surgery was
otherwise without complication however due to the long duration
under anesthesia and his significant EBL the decision was made
to keep him intubated after surgery.

He was transferred to the SICU overnight. He was placed on a
HOB<30 restriction for the first 48hrs postop due to his dural
tear. Pnemoboots were used for postoperative DVT prophylaxis.
Intravenous antibiotics were continued for 24hrs postop per
standard protocol. He became transiently hypotensive overnight
with SBPs in the 70s and required pressor support. Other vital
signs remained stable. The following morning he was extubated
without incident. He was transfused 1U RBC for HCT 26.9 and his
hypotension improved. He remained stable throughout the day
POD#1 and was transferred to the regular Orthopaedic floor in
the evening of POD#1. His foley was put on traction and
irrigated for treatment of his hematuria. Initial postop pain
was controlled with a PCA. Diet was advanced as tolerated. The
patient was transitioned to oral pain medication when tolerating
PO diet.

On POD#2 his activity restrictions were lifted and he had no
headache or symptoms of dural leak when upright. Physical
therapy was consulted for mobilization OOB to ambulate. He was
transfused a further 2U RBCs for dropping HCT (HCT 25.8) in the
setting of his hematuria and postop Hemovac output. His postop
transfusion HCT was appropriately elevated at HCT 29.0. Urology
was consulted and performed foley irrigation and replacement.
His hematuria resolved by POD#3.

On POD#3 he was noted to have a distended abdomen. A KUB was
performed that was consistent with postop ileus and he was made
NPO for bowel rest. Suppository was given to encourage bowel
movement and IVF were restarted while he remained NPO. Daily
KUBs were checked until his symptoms resolved. On POD#6 his diet
resumed and he was advanced from clear liquids to regular diet
as tolerated.

Hospital course was otherwise unremarkable. On the day of
discharge the patient was afebrile with stable vital signs,
comfortable on oral pain control and tolerating a regular diet.
