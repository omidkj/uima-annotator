Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] is an 88 year-old man with CAD s/p CABG in [**2162**] and
PCI at [**Hospital1 2025**] in [**2192**], mild AS, Parkinsons with autonomic
instability, CHF with EF 30% with multiple recent admissions for
exacerbations ([**3-8**], [**1-31**], [**1-18**]) presents with acute onset
dyspnea.
.
Patient reports acute onset tachypnea and chest pressure after
having large BM this afternoon. Of note, he is DNR/DNI and the
family has explicit wishes not to escalate care or have invasive
procedures, including cardiac catheterization. The patient was
previously discharged with palliative care and CHF nurse, with
morphine and metolazone as rescue medications (which have not
been used to date.) During his previous admission, he
experianced significant orthostasis with SBPs in the 70s
following potentiation of lasix with 5mg of metolazone. The
patient's daughter considered using metolazone this afternoon,
but was unable to communicate with his outpatient physcians and
therefore elected to bring him to the ED instead.
.
In ED, initial VS: 96.8 72 160/51 20 and SaO2 70% on RA. Initial
exam was notable for tachypnea and wet rales throughout lung
fields. Labs notable for Cr of 1.8. EKG showed LBBB, unchanged
from previous. CXR c/w pulmonary edema. Patient placed on CPAP,
nitro gtt and given 80mg IV lasix with 420cc UOP with SaO2
rising to 100%. He was subsequently admitted to the CCU for
further managment.
.
On initial evaluation in the CCU, he is wearing a BiPAP mask and
appears comfortable. He is without addition complaint.
.
On review of systems, he denies deep venous thrombosis,
pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers,
chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All
of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope.

SEMI-UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Patient is status post median
sternotomy.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. Diffuse
airspace opacities are noted, more pronounced on the right
compared to the left, with vascular indistinctness compatible
with moderate pulmonary edema. Bilateral pleural effusions are
small. More focal opacities in the retrocardiac region and right
lung base may reflect atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. No
acute osseous findings are seen.

IMPRESSION: Moderate pulmonary edema with small bilateral
pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is an 88 year-old man with CAD s/p CABG in [**2162**] and PCI
at [**Hospital1 2025**] in [**2192**], mild AS, Parkinsons with autonomic instability,
CHF with EF 30% with multiple recent admissions for
exacerbations ([**3-8**], [**1-31**], [**1-18**]) who presented with acute on
chronic systolic CHF.

# PUMP: Patient has known brittle choronic systolic congesitive
heart failure that has been exacerbated on numerous occasions
over the past year. He presented with an acute exacerbation that
appears to have been precipitated by the a straining episode
while having a bowel movement. It is also possible that more
strenous PT over the two days prior to admission contributed to
his decompensation by transiently increasing his blood pressure.
He had previously been feeling well and was well compensated. He
responded well IV lasix and an attempt was made to transition
him to lasix po on hospital day 2. However, he did not respond
as expected to the oral lasix and he reaccumulated fluid and had
to be given lasix 80 mg iv x2 plus a lasix gtt with BiPAP for a
few hours for respiratory distress. This episode seemed to be
triggered by being moved for nursing care further enforcing how
brittle his heart failure is at this point. After recovering
from this episode he was then transitioned to po torsemide and
was discharged home on 20mg PO torsemide daily with instructions
to increase torsemide if worsened SOB at home and PRN metolazone
to be taken at home if more SOB. Pt [**Last Name (un) **] been stable for 2 days
on current diuretic regimen at time of discharge. He was
continued on his home dose of digoxin 0.125mg QOD.

# Goals of Care: Due to severity of heart failure and how
tenuous patient status appears to be, pt's daughters had
multiple conversations with the palliative care service during
the hospitalization. Palliative care had been consulted at the
request of the palliative service who was aware of the patient.
They followed during hospitalization and continued to give recs
about care. They are currently working with daughters to develop
a plan for possible outpatient hospice. For now, pt going home
with palliative care NP home visits pl
