[**Hospital **]
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
79F with gallstone pancreatitis complicated by infected
pancreatic pseudocyst, now with increased [**Last Name (un) 103**]. pain and nausea.


IMPRESSION:

1. Multiloculated fluid collection in lesser sac representing a
pseudocyst from head and neck of pancreas, with a pigtail drain
in it. Vascular structures appear patent. No bowel pathology is
seen.

2. Diverticulosis without diverticulitis, though evaluation of
the pelvic structures is limited by beam-hardening artifact.

3. Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
Superimposed consolidation (aspiration vs pneumonia) should also
be considered given the presence of air bronchograms.

5. Nasogastric tube is coiled within a hiatal hernia.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

RADIOLOGY   Preliminary Report

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2172-11-14**] 10:23 AM
Reason: Eval. for cardiopulm. changes.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
79 year old woman with acute SOB, diaphoresis, nausea
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Eval. for cardiopulm. changes.
HISTORY: Shortness of breath.

Single portable radiograph of the chest again demonstrates a
left-sided pleural effusion, unchanged from [**2172-11-13**]. Small
right-sided pleural effusion persists as well. The aorta is
calcified and tortuous. Cardiomediastinal contours are
unchanged. No consolidation is evident. No pneumothorax.

Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2172-11-17**]
INTERPRETATION:

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal. Right ventricular
chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation
is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is
a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function. Mild
aortic regurgitation.

   GRAM STAIN (Final [**2172-11-15**]):
      NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
      NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.

   FLUID CULTURE (Preliminary):
      STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.    RARE GROWTH.

   ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO ANAEROBES ISOLATED.

CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  [**2172-11-23**] 12:58 PM

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
79F with gallstone pancreatitis complicated by infected
pancreatic pseudocyst.

COMPARISON: [**2172-11-14**].

CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: The small right pleural
effusion has decreased in size. There is near resolution of the
left pleural effusion. The liver is stable. Small stones are
again noted in the gallbladder. The gallbladder is somewhat
distended, but unchanged in appearance. The spleen, adrenal
glands, kidneys, stomach and bowel loops are unchanged in
appearance. The pancreas is stable in appearance with
multiloculated collections extending anteriorly and posteriorly
from the pancreas. The drainage catheter is stable. No new
collections are identified. A large hiatal hernia is again
observed. There is no free air. No mesenteric or retroperitoneal
lymphadenopathy is identified.

CT PELVIS: Air is noted in the distended bladder. The patient is
status post recent Foley catheter removal. Extensive colonic
diverticulosis is observed without evidence of diverticulitis.
There is no free fluid and no pelvic or inguinal
lymphadenopathy. Bilateral fat-containing inguinal hernias are
again identified.

BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous
lesions. Left hip prosthesis is again observed.

IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of the pancreas with a
multiloculated pseudocyst and pigtail drainage catheter. No new
collections identified.
















Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted on [**2172-11-13**] from [**Hospital3 **] Hospital. She was
continued on Vanco and Imipenum.
.
ID: At [**Hospital **] Hospital she had a PICC line infection (Staph) and was
being treated with Vancomycin. The Imipenem was for the
pseudocyst (Coag Neg Staph). She was afebrile here and her
Imipenem was stopped. The Vancomycin will continue until her
follow-up appointment. She will need a repeat CT prior to that
appointment.

Resp: Upon admission she had an episode of diaphoresis and
dyspnea. She was admitted to the SICU. A CXR on [**11-13**] showed L>R
pleural effusion with LLL collapse/consolidation. She received
O2, nebs, Lasix with some relief. An EKG was done and enzymes
cycled which were negative.
.
Cardiology consult: Cardiac enzymes x 2 were negative. She was
also hypertensive and treated with Lopressor, Enalapril,
Nitropaste, and Hydralazine and Lasix. She was then transitioned
to PO meds and her BP was better controlled. An ECHO was done
and showed an EF>55%.
.
Abd: Her abdomen remained soft, nondistended and nontender. She
had a pigtail drain in place and it was draining small amounts.
A CT on [**2172-11-23**] revealed stable appearance of the pancreas with
a multiloculated pseudocyst and pigtail drainage catheter. No
new collections identified. The drain was subsequently D/C'd.
.
Neuro: Baseline confusion. Seems to wax and wane during the day.
She cleared during her admission and was at her baseline.

FEN: She was started on TPN. On [**11-17**] she passed speech and
swallow and ordered for a  regular diet. Still, she was not
taking much PO. Calorie counts were ordered and revealed kcal of
556, 485 and 616. Repeat calorie counts revealed approximately
800 kcals/day. Her TPN was discontinued and a PO diet was
encouraged.

PT/OT: She was consulted by PT and OT and both recommended
Rehab.
