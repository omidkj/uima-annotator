History of Present Illness:
77F with sleep apnea on home O2 recently discharged from [**Hospital1 2025**] s/p
treatment of LE cellulitis and increasing LE edema.  CXR @ [**Hospital1 2025**]
revelaed worsening pulmonary edema, and she had a positive UA.
She received both CTX and Vancomycin.  She also received bolus
fluids for hypotension. Patient discharged on Dicloxicillin on
[**2184-6-24**]

Patient returned to our ED on [**2184-6-25**] with change in mental
status. and increased LE pain, as noticed by family.  Vitals on
admission were 96.6 72 112/58 20 100NRB (88 RA).  CXR was
negative for any focal infiltrate.  She was given Solumedrol 125
iv x 1 for presumed COPD exacerbation.  ABG: 7.42/54/363.
Patient had facemask removed and transitioned to NC.  She was
also given Vanc/Levo.  Patient remained asleep for 4 hours
without internvention and sent to the floor.  On the floor
patinet was somnolent and ABG was 7.31/65/135 and patinet was
transferred to the MICU for CPAP for presumed hypercarbic
respiratory failure.

Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
CXR: IMPRESSION:  Limited examination.  Moderate cardiomegaly.
No pulmonary abnormality.
.
CT Head
FINDINGS:  There is no hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of the
normally midline structures, or major vascular territorial
infarct.  The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is preserved.
There is no hydrocephalus.  Cysts are seen within the choroid
plexus.  Osseous structures demonstrate mild upper hyperostosis
of the walls of the right maxillary sinus.  The paranasal
sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
IMPRESSION:
1.  No hemorrhage or mass effect.
.
CT CHEST
CTA CHEST:  There are coronary artery calcifications and
calcifications of the mitral and aortic annuli.  Scattered
mediastinal lymph nodes do not meet CT criteria for enlargement.
 While the examination is technically limited, there are no main
or segmental pulmonary artery emboli.  There are small bilateral

pleural effusions and mild diffuse ground-glass opacity as well
as mild cardiomegaly, suggestive of mild pulmonary edema.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Moderate cardiomegaly with small bilateral pleural effusions
and
ground-glass opacities suggestive of mild pulmonary edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
77F with known COPD on home O2 with possible COPD exacerbation
and resultant hypercarbin respiratory failure

Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Cause is unclear, though may
have had some element of CHF.  Patient was found to have c02 in
the mid 60s and was somnolent and thus was taken to the MICU for
non-invasive ventilation.  This intervention improved mental
status.  Additionally was initially diuresed, but this was
complicated by hypotension. Cause was also likely secondary to
obesity hypoventilation given patient's habitus.  As well
patient has OSA and was started on CPAP.  Should increase CPAP
as tolerated and patient if possible should have a repeat sleep
study.  Improved CO2 and mental status after CPAP.  There is
very little evidence in chart that patient actually has COPD.
Night prior to discharge tolerated 10 CPAP.  This should be
continued and a sleep consult should be done at some point.

Hypotension: Found to have SBPs in the 80s, however always able
to mentate and had adequate urine output.  Hypotension was
likely a combination of difficulty in measuring, given habitus,
hypovolemia given diarrhea and high doses of diltiazem (thought
to be home doses, but possible patient was non-adherant).    BPs
stable prior to discharge in the 100-130s range.  Given that the
patient has baseline hypertension, suspect that diovan will
likely have to be restarted, as well as diltiazem.

C diff: diagnosed during this admission.  Started on flagyl for
14 day course.  Symptoms improved at time of diagnosis

Cellulitis - Patient recently discharged from [**Hospital1 2025**] s/p treatment
for cellulitis on dicloxacillin, on presentation was treated
wtih vancomycin.  However, by HD # 2 was clearly improved and
antibiotics were discontinued.

Atrial fibrillation: had episodes of tachycardia and was started
on diltiazem at 1/2 home dose, was hypotensive (though as above,
difficult to get accurate BP) but also intermittently
tachycardic.  Rate control was significantly improved with
digoxin load.  The level of digoxin should be checked in [**11-25**]
days to ensure patient not toxic at time of steady state.

Coagulopathy: patient with increased INR during admission.  This
is likely secondary to coumadin dosing at slightly higher (5 mg
versus 2.5 in some notes) as well as poor intake and diarrhea.
Additionally is on metronidazole that can increase it.  This
level should be followed with coumadin restarted when level <3.
Though it is possible that the patient has developed another
cause for hypocoagulibility, it seems less likely in the setting
of previously normal coags.  Nonetheless, if this should
continue to increase, mixing studies as well as hematology
evaluation may be necessary.
