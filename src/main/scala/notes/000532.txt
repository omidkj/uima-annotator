Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Aspirin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 371**]
Chief Complaint:
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**6-9**] Exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions,
enteroenterostomy
[**6-13**] Exploratory laparotomy


History of Present Illness:
67 year old female with poorly differentiated pelvic carcinoma
(status post surgery, chemo, XRT), with recurrent
admissions/emergency room visits for abdominal pain, presenting
again with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, found to have a
small bowel obstruction in the emergency room. Her previous
admissions were in [**Month (only) 547**] and [**Month (only) **] with similar complaints. CT
scan ([**2105-3-15**]) demonstrated some minimal wall thickening of deep
loops of small bowel. GI was consulted and felt that the
patient's history was most consistent with partial SBO. A
small-bowel follow-through demonstrated a slightly thickened,
irregular, aperistaltic loop of small bowel in the distal pelvis
but no evidence of obstruction. Her last CT in [**Month (only) **] showed an
obstruction at a deflection point in the left lower quadrant.
She was again medically treated and improved.

She now returns with similar symptoms of nausea, vomiting and
abdominal pain since day prior to admission and again is found
to have a partial SBO on CT. She has not had a BM in 10 days.
She complains of pain worse in RLQ. She says she has lost weight
since surgery. No melena or hematochezia. No hematemesis.

Past Medical History:
1) Poorly differentiated pelvic carcinoma:  From last discharge
summary:  "Diagnosed with pelvic mass [**5-20**] after having
difficulty with urination. MRI was notable for a 4.0 x 4.3 x 7.2
cm heterogeneous cystic and solid pelvic mass anterior to the
bladder. Biopsy was consistent with poorly differentiated
malignancy. Underwent radical vaginectomy, radical vulvectomy,
and anterior pelvic exenteration on [**2104-7-18**]. With urostomy. Taxol
on [**2104-9-24**] and then palliative radiation therapy. MRI on [**2104-12-18**]
was notable for interval decrease in size of the soft tissue
density immediately adjacent to and posterior to the pubic
symphysis, compatible with scar and no evidence of disease
recurrence  elsewhere in the pelvis.
2) Cerebrovascular accident x 2 (cerebellar)
3) Anemia: B12 deficient
4) Asthma
5) Hypertension
6) Hypothyroidism status post thyroidectomy

Social History:
She is from [**Male First Name (un) 1056**]. She worked as an office cleaner. She
has three children. She lives with her brother. She reports a
47-pack year smoking history. She quit after she was diagnosed
with cancer. She consumes alcohol on social basis.


Family History:
Sister died of cancer in [**2100**], type unknown, positive for
hypertension, diabetes.

Physical Exam:
T: 96.8  HR: 102  BP: 110/80  RR: 18  98% RA
Gen: no apparent distress
HEENT: neck supple, no masses
Card: regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops
Lungs: clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, or
rhonchi
Abd: soft, nontender, incision clean, dry, and intact, ostomy
pink and viable
Ext: no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema
Neuro: CNII-XII grossly intact

Pertinent Results:
[**6-1**] CT abd/pelvis
1. Small bowel obstruction, at least partial. No distinct
transition point is identified, though it appears to be located
within the pelvis involving the ileum. There is no free air or
significant ascites at this time. Obstructed bowel loops are
more dilated than seen in [**2105-5-15**].
2. Moderate right-sided hydronephrosis, unchanged from the prior
exam.

Pathology specimen from [**2105-6-9**]
Small bowel (3.3 cm):
Mild mucosal edema, otherwise unremarkable small bowel.

[**6-23**] abdominal Xray
No evidence of underlying bowel obstruction. Probable
constipation/impaction with a large amount of stool noted within
the descending colon, sigmoid, and rectum.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 43251**] was admitted to the hospital on [**6-1**] for partial
small bowel obstruction.  She treated with a nasogastric tube,
IV fluids, nothing by mouth, and pain control.  PICC placed on
[**6-4**] and transferred to general surgery care.  TPN started at
that time. NGT was clamped and she had significant nausea.

She was taken to the operating room on [**6-9**] for LOA and
enteroenterostomy and tolerated the procedure well.

On POD#1 she had an episode of hypotension and responded well to
fluid boluses only transiently so was transferred to the ICU.
[**Last Name (un) **] stim test was ordered and was nromal.  Levo and flagyl were
given and TPN restarted.  Was transfused one unit of blood for
Hct of 21.  Levo and Flagyl were dc'ed after 4 days.

Again on [**6-13**] the patient was taken to the OR for exploratory
laparotomy to r/o anastomotic leak/peritonitis. No leaks or
peritonitis was found on laparotomy.

One episode of tachycardia was responsive to fluid bolus,
otherwise the patient was hemodynamically stable the remainder
of the hospitalization.  She was evaluated for confusion and
serial neuro exams showed no focal or cognitive deficits below
baseline.  As bowel function returned diet was advanced and she
was weaned from TPN.  Pain was controlled on oral pain meds.  Pt
began working with PT on walking, transfers, and stairs. She was
cleared by PT to go home with services. The pt was discharged
home with services on POD 20/16.
