Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea, abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
89M with PMH of CAD s/p CABG (LAD, PL-RCA, diag), HTN, HLD,
Carotid disease presenting with lower abdominal pain acute onset
last night as well as possible mild chest pain this morning and
dyspnea.  He reports that he has had some chest pain over the
last two days, none since last night, for which he took
sublingual GTN with little relief.  He previously had not
required GTN for several months.  Denies palpitations.  He
complains of nasal congestion, cough and dyspnea over the past 1
week.  He also has diffuse lower abdominal pain which started
last night, he also reports loose, soft stool over the last [**2-23**]
days, but no liquid stools, no blood, some nausea but no
vomiting.
.
In the ED, his initial vitals were 96.5 87 130/75 24 85% on room
air.  He was placed on bipap with improvement of respiratory
status, but was unable to tolerate weaning of bipap.  EKG showed
sinus rhythm and left bundle branch block, consistent with prior
EKG.  CK-MB was elevated to 22.  Labs were notable for WBC 15.6
with 91.5% neutrophils, and creatinine 1.3, Troponin rose from
0.08 to 0.21. BNP 7857.  CXR showed moderate pulmonary edema
with small bilateral pleural effusions. CTA torso consistent
with right-sided pneumonia, bilateral pleural effusions, normal
aorta, no PE.  He was given full dose aspirin, levofloxacin,
vancomycin, started on heparin drip and given lasix 20mg IV x 1.
 Vitals prior to transfer were: 71 136/54 21 97% on bipap 8/8.
.
On review of systems he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA,
deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time
of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
ADMISSION LABS:

ECG [**2198-1-25**]:  Left bundle branch, unchanged since prior. sinus
rhythm. No q wave abnormalities in inferior leads, changed from
prior.  No other ischemic changes.  Sgarbossa negative

[**2198-1-25**] CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: The great
vessels appear unremarkable. The aorta is of normal caliber
throughout. No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology is
identified. There is extensive calcification in the descending
aorta. The patient is status post CABG with native coronary
calcification. The airways are patent to the subsegmental level.

On the left, there is a small pleural effusion. On the right,
there is a
moderate pleural effusion with subjacent atelectasis. There is
evidence of
volume overload with new septal thickening at the lung bases.
There are also ground-glass opacities in a perihilar
distribution in bilateral lungs; however, there is also a more
focal consolidative process in the right perihilar region
concerning for infection.
A 8 mm lung nodule in the left upper lobe adjacent to the
mediastinum is seen (3a:45).

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver enhances
homogeneously and
shows no focal lesions. The gallbladder has two small
gallstones. However,
there is no gallbladder wall edema or pericholecystic fluid. The
spleen and bilateral adrenal glands are unremarkable. The
pancreas is atrophic. The right kidney has a small hypodensity,
which is too small to characterize, but likely a simple renal
cyst. Again noted is extensive calcification of the abdominal
aorta, including the SMA and extending down to the iliacs. Loops
of bowel within the abdomen are unremarkable. No mesenteric or
retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is appreciated. No free air or
free fluid.

CT OF THE PELVIS: The appendix is visualized and is unremarkable
(3B:134).  Loops of small bowel within the pelvis are
unremarkable. The rectum and loops of large bowel within the
pelvis are also unremarkable. The prostate is slightly enlarged
along with prostatic calcifications. The bladder and distal
ureters are unremarkable. Small fat containing left inguinal
hernia is noted.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Degenerative changes are seen throughout the
lumbar and thoracic spine; however, there is no evidence of
suspicious osseous lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, with
subjacent
atelectasis and mild pulmonary edema. More focal consolidation
in the right perihilar region is concerning for superimposed
infection.
2. Sub-cm hypodensity within the right kidney, too small to
characterize, but likely simple renal cyst.
3. Cholelithiasis without any evidence of cholecystitis.
4. Extensive calcification of the aorta.
5. 8 mm left upper lobe pulmonary nodule. This should be
followed up with a chest CT in [**7-3**] months if there are no risk
factors for lung cancer or prior history of malignancy.
Otherwise, this should be followed up in [**3-27**] months.


Brief Hospital Course:
Respiratory symptoms:  Cough, URI symptoms since 1-2 weeks.
Patient denies noticing any dyspnea, but desatting to 80s off
BIPAP.  Leukocytosis, but afebrile, no tachycardia.  Mets [**2-24**]
SIRS criteria.  Was placed on CAP coverage and diuresed for
suspected new onset CHF (BNP [**Numeric Identifier 2686**]), eventually broadened to
vanc/cefepime and placed on a lasix gtt.  Over the course of the
admission, we were unable to wean the patient from bipap; he
would desaturate into the low 80s/high 70s whenever on 100% FiO2
face mask.  He remained tachypneic with increased work of
breathing on the bipap machine with a PEEP of 10.  His chest
xray showed continued interval progression of his lung
pathology, with worsening multifocal infiltrates and probable
development of ARDS.  The patient remained DNR/DNI throughout.
A family meeting was held to discuss goals of care; at that
point, we felt that we either needed to pursue intubation with
full therapeutic management (ARDSnet volumes, aggressive
suctioning for secretions, etc) or be made CMO as he was
approaching 4 days on bipap without any improvement and was
already maximized on other therapies.  Ultimately, on [**2198-1-28**] the
family decided in conjunction with the patient to make him CMO.
He was placed
