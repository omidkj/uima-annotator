with two days of fever, nausea, vomiting and mental status
changes.  Patient is confused and has poor insight into her
recent symptoms and reasons for presentation to the hospital. "I
felt like I had a cold... my son brought me in, you should talk

Bcx from [**6-24**]: Gram neg rods (prelim)

CXR from [**6-25**]:  In comparison with the study of [**6-24**], there is
little overall changein the extensive left-sided pneumonia that
involves much of this side of the lung. Widespread
air-bronchograms are again seen. Retrocardiac atelectasis or
consolidation is again noted. Mild blunting of the costophrenic
angles again seen.

CT head from [**6-23**]:  no intracranial pathology

RUQ US fro [**6-23**]:  Coarsened and echogenic liver with probable
focal areas of focal fatty sparing. Please note, while the
appearance is in part due to fatty deposition,more advanced
forms of liver disease such as cirrhosis or fibrosis cannot be
excluded. Clinical correlation is advised and consideration may
be given to MRI if clinically indicated.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2182-6-26**] 4:38 PM
Large consolidation in the left upper and mid lung, consistent
with infectious process appears to be minimally different from
the prior study with no obvious evidence of improvement. There
is unchanged cardiomegaly with small amount of left pleural
effusion that appears to be unchanged as well. The overall
appearance has progressed compared to [**2182-6-23**]. No
appreciable evidence of volume overload is demonstrated. The
findings, although consistent with infectious process might
obscure underlying mass. Followup until resolution is highly
recommended with
reevaluation of the patient in two to four weeks after
completion of antibiotic therapy. If no clinical symptoms of
improvement are present,
evaluation with chest CT, preferably after injection of IV
contrast might be considered to exclude the possibility of
post-obstructive pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
#Bacteremia:  On HOD 1, pt was found to grow g+ rods c/w
clostridium or bacillus.  at this time the ceftriaxone/azithro
which she was started on was d/c'd and she was started on a
course of vanc/zosyn/clinda (for possibility of clostridium
toxin).  Pt was spiking fevers persistently throughout the day
of [**6-24**](as high as 104.4), and was receiving tylenol and
continous IVF.  By the following morning, her fevers had
improved, but she was significantly hypotensive (SBP in 80s),
and was satting in the low 90s on 4L NC.  At this point a 1L
bolus was started and she was put on a NRB and her O2 responded
well.  BP also came up to SBP 104 after half of her bolus.
However, given the concern for septic shock, a trigger and MICU
consult was called.  Pt was transported to MICU where her
pressures improved with fluids without a pressor requirement.

#. Pneumonia: Initial CXR in ED showed left perihilar opacity
consistent with pna.  with continued fevers, we obtained a
repeat the next evening which showed worsening of her pna to
include upper and lower lobes.  It is unclear at this point
whether the pna was seeded by the bacteremia or a separate
issue.  However, she was being covered for her pna with her
bacteremic management.  Patient transferred to the MICU on [**6-25**]
for hypoxia requiring a nonrebreather.  Vanc and zosyn were
continued and she was able to quickly wean her oxygen
requirements and was transferred back to the floor the next day.
 On the floor pt had a urine culture that was positive for
legionella; after consultation with ID, the pt was switched to
Levofloxacin 750 mg daily for an abiotic course of 10days. This
was completed in the outpat setting. Pt was discharged on home
oxygen while she completed her recover.
.
#AMS:  Per pt report, she had been feeling ill in the days
leading up, and her family says she was not her baseline and
that something was "off".  The pt's change in MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 2771**]
to her bacteremia.  Her head CT was negative. [**Name (NI) 3575**] pt was
mostly A/Ox3 but would occasionally forget the date. She was
mentating well and answered questions, and carried on
conversations.  Even with her episode of hypotension prompting
the MICU transfer on [**6-25**] she didn't have any acute MS changes.
As she recovered on the floor, her MS continued to improve and
returned to baseline.

#. Transaminitis: Unclear etiology but were initially thought to
be related to hypoperfusion state vs. hepatitis or po
