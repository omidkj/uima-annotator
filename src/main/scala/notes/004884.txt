Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5827**]
Chief Complaint:
Decreased urine output

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubated on ventilator briefly

History of Present Illness:
59 F with ceftriaxone-sensitive Proteus mirabilis UTIs, L MCA
CVA with residual R hemiplegia/aphasia at baseline, DM1, G tube,
seizures, was sent from [**Hospital **] rehab with decreased UO x 12
hours and Cr 4.1 from baseline 1.0. According to Stonehedge
papers, on [**9-9**], BUN/Cr 88/3.3, Na 128, and urine grew out
Proteus mirabilis. She was given 4 L IVF and Ceftriaxone 1 g
daily from [**9-9**] to 9/14m and her foley was changed. On [**9-11**], her
Na 123, K 5.7, Cl 91, HCO3 17, BUN/Cr 94/3.6. Starting on [**9-12**],
she had <200 ml UO in 8 hours, BG 53 increased to 76 after
glucagon. Her vitals were BP 112/75, HR 70, 98% RA. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she was hypothermic to 32 C, hypotensive with
SBP 80s, V paced at 60, 98% 2L nc, WBC 13, Bands 5. RIJ was
placed, pulled back per CXR. CXR negative for infiltrate.
Received levo/flagyl/vanco, BNP [**Numeric Identifier 7206**], lactate 1.4 to 1.9. Could
not send a UA in the ED since she was anuric at the time. CT
abdomen without contrast was not read by the time the patient
was transferred to the MICU.
.
On MICU [**Numeric Identifier **], ABG 7.19/36/99, and patient was intubated,
became transiently hypotensive with SBP 70 in response to
sedation meds, was given 500 ml NS bolus and started on Levophed
which was weaned 30 min later with normotension. Urine output
was several drops. EKG showed V pacing 60 resulting in RBBB with
no signs of ischemia.
.
For her recent medical history, she was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] in
[**3-5**], went to [**Hospital **] Rehab, was transferred to Stonehedge from
[**Hospital1 **] in mid-[**Month (only) 205**] for "increased medical needs" per patient's
son. She was admitted at [**Hospital 882**] Hospital [**Date range (1) 74679**]/07 with ARF
and ceftriaxone-sensitive Proteus UTI. Has MRSA, VRE, Cdiff
history in [**3-4**].

Studies:

IMPRESSION:
1. Small amount of pericholecystic fluid. No evidence of acute
cholecystitis.
2. Echogenic bilateral renal parenchyma, compatible with medical
renal disease.

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST [**2155-9-12**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Gallbladder distension with pericholecystic fluid, sludge and
equivocal stones and mural thickening. Would recommend further
evaluation for possible acute cholecystitis by ultrasound or
HIDA scan.
2. Generalized anasarca.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis; with
the air bronchograms that the patient has, cannot rule out
basilar pneumonia.
4. Pancreatic calcifications consistent with chronic
pancreatitis.
5. No evidence of a large mass, colitis or free air.

ECHO Study Date of [**2155-9-13**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Right ventricular systolic function is normal. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened with focal calcification of the
non-coronary cusp. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitati
