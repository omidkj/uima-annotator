Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2189-8-26**] Drainage of peri sigmoid abcess
[**2189-8-28**] PICC line placement

History of Present Illness:
  50 year-old gentleman with history of HTN, hyperlipidema,
ETOH abuse,pancreatitis, and recent legionella PNA presents as
transfer from OSH for diverticular abscess.  The patient has had
an MVR/AVR and had been on coumadin until hep gtt was started
for
potential intervention off the abscess.  The patient had been
NPO
on IV abx at [**Hospital 5871**] hospital for the past week, however he was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] in case surgical intervention needed to be
performed on the abscess. At the current time, he reports
persistent pain and bloating of his abdomen.  No N/V. He has
been
passing minimal amounts of flatus.

[**2189-8-26**] Abd. CT: IMPRESSION:
1. Large fluid collections within the abdomen and pelvis
containing gas and
amenable to percutaneous drainage. This fluid collection appears
grossly
larger than previous study.
2. Left renal calculus within the proximal ureter, mild
hydronephrosis.

[**2189-8-26**] CT guided drainage of colonic fluid collection:
  IMPRESSION: Successful drainage of the prior colon abscess and
50 ml of the
Small amount of fluid was sent to laboratory as requested. The
catheter was
left in place.

[**2189-8-29**] Abd CT : 1. Interval decrease in size of abscess in the
superior aspect of the pelvic
cavity. A percutaneous drain remains in situ, with tip at the
left lateral
aspect of the collection. The collection appears partly
loculated.

[**2189-9-1**] Cardiac Echo : The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is top normal/borderline dilated. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %). The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. A bileaflet aortic valve
prosthesis is present. The transaortic gradient is normal for
this prosthesis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of aortic regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] A bileaflet mitral valve
prosthesis is present. The gradients are higher than expected
for this type of prosthesis. No mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

IMPRESSION: Bileaflet mitral and aortic valve prostheses.
Trivial aortic regurgitation. Elevated transmitral valve
gradients. Mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Mildly
dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension.

Compared with the prior report (images not available for review)
of [**2187-7-23**], the gradient across the prosthetic valve is
higher. Left ventricular systolic function is less vigorous. The
right ventricle is now mildly dilated and hypokinetic. The
estimated pulmonary artery pressures are slightly higher. If
there is a clinical suspicion of valve dysfunction, a TEE may be
indicated.
[**2189-8-31**] Abd CT for drain reposition :
  IMPRESSION: Successful CT-guided repositioning of the drainage
catheter
2. Focal fluid collection adjacent to the distal portion of
sigmoid colon has
also decreased in size.

3. Persistent distention of the ascending and transverse colon
with gas and
fluid, which is slightly more prominent than on previous CT.

[**2189-9-5**] Abd CT :
. Decrease in size of pelvic collection with drain in situ and
in good
position.

2. Improving acute diverticulitis of the sigmoid colon.

3. New diffuse mild thickening of the wall of the entire colon,
indicating a
superimposed colitis. Differential considerations include C.
difficile, given
that the patient is on antibiotics, however, and other
differentials such as
inflammatory bowel disease and ischemia are much less likely.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] was admitted to the hospital, continued NPO , hydrated
with IV fluids and placed on Flagyl and Ciprofloxacin.  His
abdomen was very distended and tympanic and remained that way
for many days despite the fact that he was passing flatus.  He
was placed on IV heparin for his prosthetic heart valves and
after 6 days of bowel rest and no significant improvement he was
placed on TPN via a PICC line.

A repeat Abd CT was done on [**2189-8-26**] which showed the same large
fluid collection from a diverticular abscess which was
subsequently drained. His partial large bowel obstruction
remained the same. The drainage grew out 2 strains of Ecoli and
coag negative staph.  His antibiotics were eventually changed to
Bactrim DS and Ciprofloxacin orally.  Over time the drainage was
very minimal, prompting a repeat scan on [**2189-8-29**].  On [**2189-8-31**] he
returned to Radiology to have his drain manipulated as there was
an un drained fluid collection.  There was some decreased
distention of the large bowel and on exam his abdomen started to
appear less distended and he gradually had much less pain.

From a cardiac standpoint he had problems with severe DOE and 3+
leg edema requiring concentration of his fluids and vigorous
diuresis.  Due to his cardiac history he had a cardiac echo
which revealed an EF of 45-50% and a slight increase in the
gradient across the mitral valve.  The Cardiology service was
then consulted to address the need for a TEE. Mr. [**Known lastname 10881**]
symptoms improved after vigorous diuresis and the Cardiology
service felt that a TEE could be done on an out patient basis if
it was needed and he should have a TTE in 3 months anyway.  His
cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]  will follow him after discharge.

 His diet was very slowly increased from clear to regular as he
was having bowel movements and passing alot of flatus.  His TPN
was weaned on [**9-3**] and his PICC line was eventually removed.
Coumadin was finally started after complete resolution of his
partial large bowel obstruction and his tolerance of a regular
diet.

After a protracted hospital course he was discharged home on
[**2189-9-7**] with VNA services as he was sent home with his drain in
place and will be on Lovenox 90 mg sc BID until his INR is
greater than 2.0.  I spoke with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who will follow his INR
and regulate his Coumadin dose.

Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 3 weeks and he will
have a colonoscopy in 6 weeks which will be arranged by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] office.
