Intubation. Left subclavian line placement.


History of Present Illness:

urine output and fever. Pt was treated emperically with bactrim
x 1 day for dysuria. He was brought to the ED today for low UO,
fever, and rigors.
.
In the ED, VS were notable for temp to 105, BP initially sable

vancomycin, flagyl, CTX. He was given 6 LNS for presumed sepsis
with renal failure thought [**12-29**] dehydration. With this, he became
tachypneic with RR 33, using accessory muscle for breathing. He
was intubated. A left subclavian was attempted but not able to
be passed. A left IJ was placed with some difficulty of feeding
the wire. He was briefly on levofed for a low mixed venous sat.
His inital lactate was elevated to 6.3 which has decreased to
3.3. Elevated K initially treated with kayexalate, D50, insulin
with improvement to 3.9. A repeat ABG however showed an
increasing K to 5.9. Pt has another episode of bradycardia to
40's, improved with 1 amp bicarb; now on D5W w/ bicarb gtt. A CT
scan of chest and abd showed no intrabd process but a possible
pneumonia.
.

DISCAHRGE LABS:

MICROBIOLOGY:
[**2186-6-29**]: Urine culture: 10K-100000K yeast
[**2186-6-29**]: Blood culture: 2/4 bottles [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans
[**2186-7-1**]: >25PMNs <10epis, 1+ GPC, yeast
.
IMAGING:
[**2186-6-29**] AP CXR: FINDINGS:  The ETT tube was pulled back with its
tip now projecting 4 cm above the carina.  The position of the
left subclavian catheter is unchanged.  The heart size is mildly
enlarged, but stable.  There is bibasilar consolidations most
probably represent atelectasis.  There is worsening of left
upper lobe consolidation which could represent aspiration or
developing pneumonia.  There is no further pleural effusion or
pneumothorax.
.
[**2186-7-1**]: CT abdomen/pelvis:  IMPRESSION:
1.  Interval development of diffuse thickening of the distal
sigmoid colon and
rectum with mild surrounding inflammatory fat stranding and
intrapelvic fee
fluid consistent with proctitis/distal colitis. These findings
are most likely
infectious versus inflammatory in etiology, although given the
extensive
atherosclerosis within the major arterial vessels, ischemia is
also a
consideration.
2.  Large left inguinal hernia containing a large segment of
sigmoid colon
without evidence for hernia incarceration or bowel obstruction.

3.  Extensive atherosclerotic disease throughout the visualized
aorta and its
branches.
4.  Extensive sigmoid-colonic diverticulosis.
5.  Small pleural effusions with unchanged airspace
opacification at the
bilateral lung bases, right greater than left, which may
represent
atelectasis, however, infection/infiltrate is also a
consideration.
