Service:  MEDICAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 68-year-old male with
multiple medical problems significant for coronary artery
disease, congestive heart failure and anemia, who had
previously been admitted to [**Hospital6 2018**] on [**2138-12-3**], for back pain and anemia.  The
patient had developed a lumbar and thoracic compression
fracture.  He also developed bilateral pleural effusions with
a right-sided hemothorax which was subsequently drained via
chest thoracostomy tube.

The patient then developed respiratory failure and was
intubated.  He had a failure to wean and had a tracheostomy
performed, as well as peripherally inserted endoscopic
gastrojejunostomy tube.

The patient then developed aspiration pneumonia while
hospitalized and was treated for vent-assisted pneumonia.

The patient also had suffered bouts of tracheal cellulitis
around the tracheal insertion area and was treated with
Vancomycin for a course of ten days.

The patient also developed blood loss anemia while
hospitalize previously.  The patient had been slowly weaning
and had been transferred to [**Hospital3 7**] on [**2139-1-14**], for prolonged vent management in anticipated prolonged
weaning.

While at [**Hospital1 **] on [**2139-1-15**], until [**2139-1-19**], the patient had been doing well on CPAP with pressure
support.  It was noted on [**Year (4 digits) 2974**] that he developed an upper
posterior oropharynx bleed.  This is the same area that the
patient had a bleed secondary to nasogastric tube trauma
while hospitalized previously.

The patient had been seen by ENT previously secondary to this
nasogastric tube insertion and subsequently his left and
right nares were packed with a Foley balloon catheter.

While at [**Hospital1 **], the patient developed bleeding in the
site.  He bled through the course of the week, and his
hematocrit dropped from 32 to 24.  The patient was
transferred to [**Hospital6 256**] for
management of his bleeding and anemia.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  On presentation in the
Emergency Department, the patient's initial heart rate was
64, blood pressure 176/69, oxygen saturation 100% on SIMV
with pressure support of [**9-13**], titer volume 600, respirations
12, PEEP 5.  It was noted that the patient had copious saliva
and blood filled up the posterior oropharynx that was
suctioned for approximately 200 cc of serosanguinous and
clot-filled material.  He had deep suction through
tracheostomy tube which revealed no blood in the distal
trachea or bronchi.  General:  He was comfortable in no
apparent distress.  HEENT:  Extraocular movements intact.
Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.  He did have dry
clots in his nose and mouth.  His conjunctiva were minimally
pale.  Neck:  Exam revealed tracheal site erythema with no
warmth, no fluctuants.  No jugular venous distention.  No
carotid bruits.  Chest:  He had diffuse rhonchi bilaterally
on the vent.  Cardiovascular:  He had distant heart sounds.
Regular, rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.  PEG tube was in
place and clean and dry without blood around the site.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Warm with god
pulses.  Neurological:  He was alert and answering questions
with nodding yes and no appropriately.  He was following
suggestions.  No focal deficits on neurological exam.  His
deep tendon reflexes were intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  Upon presentation in the Emergency Room, he
had a hematocrit of 25.9, white count 7.8, platelet count
229; CHEM7 revealed a sodium of 131, potassium 5.6, chloride
90, bicarb 37, BUN 36, creatinine 1; PTT 29.2, PT 12.6, INR
1.

Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 75, with
borderline intraventricular conduction delay, and ST
elevation in lead V2 only.

Chest x-ray revealed right middle lobe and lower lobe
opacities, unchanged from previous x-ray, with bilateral
small pleural effusions.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit on [**2139-1-19**].  The patient was
seen by Otolaryngology in the Emergency Department.
Subsequent to his previous history of traumatic nasogastric
tube insertion and subsequent left nares laceration with
bleeding, the left nares laceration required posterior nasal
packing to control the bleeding.

Otolaryngology performed a fiberoptic laryngoscope of both
nares, as well as the oropharynx, as well as the distal
trachea.  They noted no active bleeding.  They noted copious
dry blood in the posterior oropharynx.  They also noted
previous left posterior nasal pharynx laceration secondary to
traumatic nasogastric tube insertion.  The laryngoscopy was
also performed through the trachea which revealed no distal
tracheal bleeding or bleeding around the trach site.
Otolaryngology recommended Afrin 3 times daily during the
hospitalization.

The patient required 2 U of blood to be transfused in the
Emergency Department subsequent to his initial presentation
hematocrit of 25.9.  After 2 U of blood, this corrected his
hematocrit to 27.9.  He was subsequently transfused two more
units prior to discharge.  The patient had no further
episodes of bleeding throughout the hospitalization.  His
hematocrit remained stable.  The patient's vitals signs
remained stable throughout the hospitalization.  He had no
bouts of hypotension or tachycardia secondary to his anemia.

Due to the patient's coronary artery disease history, he
subsequently had serial cardiac enzymes drawn which revealed
showed normal CKs and normal troponins with an unremarkable
electrocardiogram.  It is highly that the patient suffered
myocardial ischemia during this hospitalization.

The patient remained on ventilatory support throughout the
hospitalization.  The patient is known to be a failure to
wean and was sent to [**Hospital1 **] for prolonged vent weaning.
The patient remained on pressure support throughout the
hospitalization with intermittent deep suctioning secondary
to secretions.

The patient was continued on his current cardiovascular
regimen of low-dose Aspirin, beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor,
sublingual Nitroglycerin, Isosorbide, and a statin, as well
as to continue Sotalol for his paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation.

The patient had his tube feeds held initially secondary to
the question of GI bleed.  He was started on protime pump
inhibitor.  His PEG site lavage was negative.  He was noted
to be [**Hospital1 **] positive most likely due to swallowed blood from
the posterior oropharynx bleed.

We would consider outpatient colonoscopy and
esophagogastroduodenoscopy if the patient has prolonged or
subsequently undergoes another bleed.  The patient was also
noted to be hyperkalemic initially in the Emergency
