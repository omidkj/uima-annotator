Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 89 year old male with CHF on home O2 (unknown amount)
and HTN with chief complaint of shortness of breath. He reports
worsening of his baseline SOB in the evening of the night of
admission.  This was associated with palpitations and was
similar to his recent CHF exacerbation in [**Month (only) **].  He reports
that he has been taking all of the medications that he was
discharged on from his last admission in [**Month (only) **], and he
denies recent salt load.  He denies noticeable changes in
chronic LE lymphedema, and he denies CP, arm/jaw/back pain, N/V,
dizziness, or changes in his weight.  At the nursing home,
patient desaturated to 71% on 3 Liters despite 100mg po lasix
and 40 IM 2hr prior. He was placed on nonrebreather 100% with no
improvement. He was given zaroxolyn 5mg po, bp dropped to 98/60,
HR remained 112, no significant improvement in saturation, high
70's to mid 80's.
.
In the ED, VS were T 92.9, BP 119/65, P 110, 97% on 100% NRB. In
the ED he received Furosemide 40mg IV x 3, Acetaminophen 325mg,
1 g ceftriaxone, azithromycin 500 mg. He was placed on bipap and
then nonrebreather.  He was febrile to 101.4 and blood and urine
cx were sent.
.
Upon admission to the ICU, he was no longer significantly short
of breath and was satting well on 50% ventimask.  He denied
other symptoms as outlined earlier.
.
Of note, during his recent admission on [**2191-8-9**] for CHF
exacerbation, he was responsive to lasix.

Imaging:
UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST: Cardiac size is mildly enlarged but
unchanged. A  dilated calcified aorta is also unchanged allowing
for technique. Compared to  [**8-16**], there are more
prominent interstitial markings bilaterally with  evidence of
peribronchial cuffing observed. A left pleural effusion is again
noted. No pneumothorax. No definite focal consolidation.
.
echo [**2191-8-10**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is 11-15mmHg.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function is borderline normal. Interventricular septal motion is
normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**11-23**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal LVEF. Dilated RV with borderline normal
systolic function. Moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension.
These findings suggest chronic pulmonary hypertension. No
findings of acute, massive pulmonary embolism are suggested.

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU COURSE:
A/P: Patient is an 89yo male with pmhx dCHF, pulm HTN, potential
pulm fibrosis and HTN who presents with hypoxic respiratory
failure. Patient was intitially admitted to ICU with
heartfailure and improved with diuresis and was discharged to
floor where he developed hypoxic respiratory failure.
.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure: Per family discussion would like
to extubate as patient's original wishes were DNR/DNI. They are
aware that the patient may have continued respiratory failure
and death if extubated and have decided to continue with
extubation. Patient extubated on [**2191-9-29**].  Leading differential
would be for pulm edema vs aspiration secondary to
intra-abdominal pathology.  Crackles and pink frothy sputum on
suction as well as hx CHF or more suggestive of pulmonary edema.
Flash pulmonary edema may have occured [**12-24**] afib vs mitral
reguritation with mild ischemia. However, recent suctioning
revealed thick, yellow material and patient's hx is c/w
aspiration. Tracheal sputum cultures are growin GPC's and he was
treated with Vanc which was stopped upon discharge.  CE neg for
ischemia.   Would think low prob for PE given INR >2. ABG shows
cont A-a gradient. Likely chronic Co2 retainer. Patient was
allowed to autodiurese. Patient was transfered to Hospice care
after family discussion given poor prognosis of his medical
condition.
.
# Adb pain/colonic dilation: Resolved with bowel movement.
Lactate trending down makes ischemic process less likely. No
evidence for infectious colitis or obtructive process on abd CT.
LFT's are also normal although slight elevated amylase/lipase.
Guiac negative. C diff neg. OGT was placed to decompress.
Flagyl/Zosyn was discontinued.

#Hypotension- Resolved with volume replacement on admission.
likely from peri-intubation medications following pre-intubation
diuresis.
.
# ARF- At baseline.  Baseline creatinine is 1.7-1.9. Up to 2.8
upon admission. This is likely in the setting of CHF
exacerbation and poor perfusion of the kidneys, which improved
with diuresis.
.
# Hypokalemia- likely from diuresis. Repleted K prn during
hospital stay.
.
# Hypernatremia -  Repleted free water deficit during hospital
stay.
.
# H/O DVT- Held anticoagulation with coumadin given elevated
INR. His INR should be followed to assess restarting his
coumadin.
.
# FEN- OGT for decompression, NPO except meds.
.
# PPX- PPI, elevated INR
.
# Access- RIJ
.
# Code- DNR, do not re-intubate.

# [**Name (NI) 2638**] brother [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 61152**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 61153**]
.
# Dispo- Family wanted DNR/DNI.  Patient will be transfered to
Hospice care after discussing with family.
