History of Present Illness:
HPI: 65 yo F with h/o CAD s/p CABG, diastolic CHF,
hyperlipidemia, DMII with h/o DKA, HTN and metastatic breast
cancer to brain/lung s/p WBXRT [**5-4**] on steroid taper p/w FS 567
at home, poor appetite. Patient reports feeling generally weak
for some time, FS running high in 300-500 range at home. Also
with no taste therefore not eating or drinking much. She also

cough, sore throat, sputum production, no SOB, no orthopnea. No
HA. No N/V/D. No abd pain. No BRBPR/melena. No dysuria. Right
arm pain has been severe, not on pain meds, not in sling, just
using ice and rest. Has difficulty getting out of bed, needs
assistance, denies any falls. Other ROS negative in detail.
.
In the ED, VS: 98.4 HR 80-140s BP initially 197/104 then
64-121/30-40s RR 15 100% RA. Given 3L NS, 4 gm Mg, Insulin gtt
started. AG 19-->13. ECG showing RBBB, LAFB, LVH with strain and
sinus tachy to 140s which improved to 120s with IVF. CXR showing
large left sided lung mass now 50% larger than prior, unable to
r/out infectin, rec CT when stable. ECG showing likely sinus
tachy improving with IVF. Also 4 grams of Mg sulfate, ASA,
insulin gtt started at 7 U/hr. Also with SBP in 80-90 range, no
obvious source of infection, not treated for sepsis. Currently
receiving fluids, very volume down on exam. Hct down to 23 with
IVF, guaiac trace positive in ED.
.
Interval Hx: Patient was admitted [**5-27**] to [**5-29**] with RUE swelling
and pain found to have either a mass with bicepts tendon rupture
and surrounding edema with plans for repeat MRI and ortho eval
as outpatient. CTA at that time negative for PE but showing LLL
mass c/w metastatses. During her hositalization she had high FS
in the 600s, small AG, and was treated with insulin. She was
sent home on a higher sliding scale dose of insulin compared to
her prior. This was all thought to be [**1-29**] to her dexamethasone
taper. The patients blood pressure was found to be slightly low
as well in the range of 90-110/40-60. She was assymptomatic.
Amlodipine 5mg was stopped. She was instructed to discontinue
this medication.

Pertinent Results:
CT HEAD [**2152-6-10**]
Multiple hyperdense foci of the left hemisphere including
parasagittal, anterior left frontal and the left parietal have
decreased in size; for example, the left anterior frontal lesion
measured 10 mm on the prior study and now measures 5 mm. No
evidence of edema is noted within the brain. Previously
mentioned shift of midline structure has completely resolved.
The hyperdense lesion of the right hemisphere are not well
visualized on today's study. One of the residual sequelae of the
prior disease is noted within the right subinsular white matter.
The bone windows demonstrate mild mucosal thickening of the
right sphenoid sinus. The mastoid air cells also contain fluid.
The remainder of the paranasal sinuses appear unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:

1. Interval resolution of multiple hemorrhagic foci with small
residual lesions in the left hemisphere. There has also been
resolution of the mass effect of the metastasis and surrounding
edema

ECHO [**2152-6-5**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. There is no aortic valve stenosis. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

CXR 06/13/008
1. Interval resolution of pulmonary edema.
2. No significant change to small bilateral effusions and
fluid-filled rounded opacity corresponding to known left lower
lobe cavity.
3. Unchanged widespread pulmonary nodules, likely infectious.

CT CHEST [**2152-6-4**]
1. Interval development of multiple pulmonary nodules. Given the
short interval, infection and/or septic emboli should be
considered.
2. Minimal increase in left lower lobe lung mass with what
appears to be a necrotic center. No evidence of active
hemorrhage within this lesion.
3. Interval increase of multiple mediastinal lymph nodes, which
at baseline were pathological and now also increased in size due
to likely reactive.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions
identified.


Brief Hospital Course:
65 F with metastatic breast CA to brain and lung, on steroid
taper, DM II, CAD s/p CABG,admitted with DKA and sepsis.
.
# Sepsis. Pt on vanc/zosyn/flagyl for presumed pulmonary source
given LLL mass with necrotic area on CT scan. Team felt that
although it would be helpful to have some data to guide
antibiotic coverage, the risks associated with obtaining sample
via BAL or CT guided biopsy outweighed the benefits of obtaining
culture data. Therefore patient was treated with empiric
antibiotics. She was transiently hypotensive requiring pressors.
Therefore she was started on
