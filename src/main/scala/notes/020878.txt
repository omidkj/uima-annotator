intraabdominal free air

None

History of Present Illness:
76-year-old female found down at home yesterday by family with
altered
mental status, brought to [**Hospital 1562**] hospital where noted to be
coagulopathic (INR > 9) and in rhabdomyolosis.  Found to have
UTI.  Admitted to
medical ICU, where imaging work-up ultimately revealed
significant pneumoperitoneum.  In light of h/o PE/DVT,
coagulopathy, and possible need for exploratory laparotomy and
IVC filter, pt transferred morning of [**2198-9-17**] [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.  Per report, pt has been hemodynamically stable
throughtout her hospital course.  Given 6u FFP and 10mg Vit K
overnight with subsequent improvement in INR to 1.8.
     On interview, pt with little recall of events yesterday.
Admits to confusion pre-hospitalization but denies being found
'down'.  Pt denies abdominal pain, chest pain, fever/chills,
SOB.
By report significant stooling, loose, prompting placement of
flexiseal rectal tube.

Chest CT.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to MICU East for close observation.
She had an abdominal pelvic CT scan which showed no active leak
of oral contrast, and the surgery team concluded that there was
no active bowel or intraperitoneal leak requiring surgery.
Serial exams revealed a completely benign abdomen in a patient
who maintained that she had no complaints. After a 24-hour stay
in the ICU, she was transferred to the floor.

On HD#2, she received a dose of warfarin to restart her
anticoagulation for her pulmonary embolism/DVT treatments. She
had an episode of hemoptysis x 1 (30cc) overnight, but remained
hemodynamically stable without complaints.

On HD#3, she was transferred to the Hospitalist East service due
to the fact that she still had ongoing issues of needing to be
anticoagulated, and acute-on-chronic renal failure.

Overall, the surgery service concluded that there was no acute
reason for surgical exploration, and she was transferred to the
medical service.

Medical Issues addressed during admission:

1.  Rhabodmyolysis.  She was admitted with elevated CK, and was
rehydrated.  CK improved, and she had improvement in her renal
failure with hydration.  Most recent CK 254.

2.  Acute renal failure.  She was admitted with acute on chronic
renal failure, with Cr 2.2.  She was hydrated, her lasix was
held, as was her lisinopril, and her Cr returned to baseline
1.2.  She was also hypernatremic in the setting of dehydration,
and was hydrated with free water with improvement.

3.  Hemoptysis.  She did have small volume of blood tinged
sputum.  Given hx of PEs, she underwent CT scan which ruled out
large central PE.  This did show interstitial changes, possibly
post infections or reflecting interstitial lung disease.  This
was also thought to possibly reflect CHF.  She will need follow
up imaging in [**7-15**] weeks.

4.  Mild CHF exacerbation, likely diastolic, but unknown EF.
She received a single dose of IV lasix, and then was
transitioned back to oral lasix.

5.  Hx of pulmonary emboli.  Due to concern for free air under
diaphragm, and pneumo peritoneum, her anticoagulation was
reversed.  She was restarted on coumadin on [**9-18**], and her most
recent INR was 2.2.  Due to small volume hemoptysis, as well as
questionable abdominal event, she was not started on a heparin
drip.  She was over 1 year out from her PEs as well and was
relatively stable from this perspective.

6.  Chronic venous stasis with ulcers.  She was seen by the
wound clinic and had wound care and ace bandaging of her LE with
improvement in her edema.

7.  IDDM.  She was restarted on her standing insulin once she
was taking a PO diet, and had good sugar control on a diabetic
diet.

8.  Hypertension.  Well controlled on home dose of lisinopril.

9.  Morbid obesity with deconditioning.  She worked with PT but
was found to be significantly below her baseline.  She was
transferred to rehabilitation for strengthening and eventual
return home.

OUTSTANDING ISSUES:

She had an abnormal chest CT, and will need this repeated.
She is on coumadin, and has been loaded to elevate her INR, her
appropriate daily dose has not yet been determined.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted after you were found in your house unable to
communicate.  At the hospital in [**Hospital1 1562**], they found air in
your abdomen, and they sent you to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation.  You
had kidney problems and muscle breakdown, which are all better
now.  You had a urinary tract infection which might have caused
all of these problems.  [**Name (NI) **] also had some blood that you coughed
up, you had a chest CT to evlauation this.

You should return to the emergency room if you have abdominal
pain, worsening shortness of breath, coughing, or increased
weakness.  Also, if you start coughing up blood or having bloody
stools.

Followup Instructions:
You should follow up with your primary care doctor in 2 weeks
after leaving rehabilitation.

You should have a repeat chest CT scan to evaluate for fluid or
other changes in the lungs in a
