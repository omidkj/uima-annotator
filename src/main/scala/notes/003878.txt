61F with PMH of schizophrenia, longstanding asthma/COPD, and
tracheobronchomalacia s/p Y stenting on [**2200-12-13**], who now
presents after being found at home after falling on the floor.
She states she has been fee;ling generally weaker and weaker
since her recent stenting. She endorses subjective fevers and
chills and malaise. On the morning of admission, she slumped
onto the floor from her bed "softly" and called lifeline
herself. EMS found her with a sat in the mid-80's on room air.
Her home O2 was twisted and non-functional. By report, there
were pills scattered on the floor. She admits to taking 1 extra
thorazine pill last night in an effort to sleep, but denies
current SI. although she admits that a long time ago she did
engage in self-injurious behavior.

[**4-5**] liters; Lungs were rhonchorous, with poor resp effort. ABG
showed 7.33/56/99, lactate 0.8. On BiPAP ([**10-5**]), sats improved.
She was transiently hypotensive to the 80's, which spontaneously
improved to 100's; didn't get IVF b/c of spontaneous resolution.
U/A was clean, but urine culture and blood cultures were sent.
Labs revealed an elevated WBC count of 17.5. CXR was suspicious
for aspiration or early PNA. She received vanco/zosyn/solumderol
and was admitted to the ICU.
.
On admission to the ICU, she stated she feelt better than
earlier today. She was easily transferred from a NRB to 5L NC
without respiratory distress or subjective SOB.

RADIOLOGY/STUDIES:
[**2201-1-2**] CXR
FINDINGS: Tracheal Y-stent is again noted in grossly stable
position. Study is significantly limited by moderate rightward
patient rotation. Bibasilar ill-defined opacities are poorly
evaluated with differential including atelectasis, aspiration or
early pneumonia. No supine evidence of pneumothorax is detected.

.
[**2201-1-5**] CXR:
Bibasilar atelectasis with interval right-sided improvement
since
examination from [**2201-1-3**].


Brief Hospital Course:
61F with PMH of COPD, TBM s/p recent Y-stenting, now presenting
with acute onset hypoxia, low grade temp, with CXR concerning
for early PNA.
.
ICU COURSE: She was rapidly weaned off bipap in ICU and has been
stable on [**3-4**] L O2. She is on home O2, 3-4 L. She had a
bronchoscopy and stent was found to be in place.  She was contd
on vanc/zosyn for HCP and also on steroids for possible COPD
exacerbation.  She was transferred to the floor.
.
HYPOXIA: Her hypoxia was most likely secondary to inflammatory
response to y-stenting that was exacerbated by her missing her
medications during the holidays. She improved quickly with broad
spectrum antibiotics, but did not likely have a
hospital-acquired pneumonia. She was also treated with steroids
for COPD initially. These were discontinued as she did not have
significant evidence of COPD.  She had a bronchoscopy in the ICU
that showed the stent to be in good position. Repeat chest x-ray
on [**1-5**] showed interval resolution of consolidations. She has
been at her baseline O2 requirement since [**1-4**].
- She will complete a course for community-acquired pneumonia,
as she has been stable on this regimen with cefpodoxime and
azithromycin. No quinolone [**2-2**] QT.
- She should continue her home nebs, singulair, and chest PT
- possible repeat bronchoscopy in [**3-4**] weeks; will follow up with
pulmonary
.
SCHITZOPHRENIA: She was continued on thorazine, gabapentin,
clonazepam, buspirone
.
DISPO: Home oxygen and VNA were arranged for patient at moms
house, where she will have someone around for assistance.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary: Tracheobronchomalacia, COPD, Pneumonia
Secondary: Schizophrenia, Anxiety, Depression, Asthma


Discharge Condition:
Hemodynamically stable, afebrile and with appropriate oxygen
saturation on baseline supplemental oxygen.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted after being found down in your home, with a
low oxygen saturation (hypoxia).  This was thought to be due to
not taking some of your lung medications for several days.
There was also concern that you may have an early pneumonia.
Thus, you are being discharged with antibiotics and your regular
home oxygen.

Take all medications as prescribed.
