[**2151-10-10**] CT Abd/pelvis : 1. Severe pancolitis in keeping with the
history of underlying C. difficile colitis. No findings of
pneumatosis or pneumoperitoneum. Mild-to-moderate amount of
intra-abdominal pelvic ascites.
2. Dense atherosclerotic calcification without aneurysmal
dilatation.
3. Small type 1 hiatal hernia.

[**2151-10-13**] CXR :
The right at least moderate-sized pneumothorax is seen after
insertion of
right central venous line with the tip terminates at the level
of cavoatrial junction. The ET tube tip is 3.5 cm above the
carina. Tube tip is in the stomach. There is no change in the
cardiomediastinal silhouette. Subsequent studies have
demonstrated a chest tube placement for the treatment of
pneumothorax. Note is made of extensive amount of subcutaneous
air that potentially may be related to insertion of the central
line

[**2151-10-22**]:  cat scan of abdomen and pelvis:

 IMPRESSION:
1. Marked wall edema and mural hyperenhancement involving the
[**Doctor Last Name **] pouch consistent with proctitis, presumably related to
persistent C. difficile involvement, although other etiologies
remain possible.

2. Moderate amount of simple ascites within the abdomen and
pelvis. No
organized or enhancing collection.

3. Interval development of moderate left and small right pleural
effusion
with regions of adjacent compression atelectasis. Small
nonspecific pulmonary nodules may be infectious or inflammatory.


4. Interval worsening of diffuse soft tissue anasarca and marked
subcutaneous emphysema involving the visualized lower chest wall
and breasts

[**2151-10-29**]:  Chest x-ray:

INDICATION: 81-year-old female with fever. Evaluate for
pulmonary etiology.

TECHNIQUE: AP portable upright chest radiograph from [**2151-10-27**].

FINDINGS: There is no relevant change compared to the prior
radiograph.
There is no focal consolidation. There are unchanged bilateral
small pleural effusions. There is unchanged prominence of the
ascending aorta and otherwise unremarkable cardiomediastinal
silhouette. There are low lung volumes and the pulmonary
vasculature is unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1. No focal infiltrate. No relevant change from prior radiograph

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the medical service for
hyperglycemia and significant diarrhea while recovering in rehab
post her right toe amputation.  She was rehydrated and placed on
antibiotics for a proteus UTI. She continued to have diarrhea,
developed abdominal distention with an elevated WBC of 21K and
became anuric with a creatinine of 2.1.  An abdominal CT was
done which demonstrated pan colitis prompting a surgical
consult. She was transferred to the MICU for further management
as she became hemodynamically unstable requiring fluid
resuscitation, pressors and intubation.

She was taken to the Operating Room on [**2151-10-13**] and underwent a
total colectomy with ileostomy for toxic megacolon.  She
tolerated the procedure well and returned to the ICU in stable
condition. She remained intubated and had a chest xray done for
tube placement which demonstrated a large right pneumothorax
prompting placement of a pigtail catheter.  Unfortunately the
right lung did not expand after pigtail placement and a regular
chest tube was placed on [**2151-10-14**].  She was oxygenating well and
subsequently able to be weaned and extubated from the ventilator
later that day.

Following transfer to the Surgical floor she continued to make
good progress. Her ostomy was active and she gradually started a
liquid diet.  She was seen by the speech and swallow service for
evaluation and seemed to have some trouble with aspirating thin
liquids.  She then remained NPO for another day and was
reevaluated.
This time there was no evidence of aspiration and she began soft
solids and thin liquids and was progressing very well.

After multiple water seal trials her chest tube was removed on
[**2151-10-20**] and a post pull film showed a tiny apical pneumothorax
which resolved the following day. She was oxygenating well on
room air and remained free of any other pulmonary complications.
 Her renal function improved dramatically after surgery and her
creatinine was back to baseline 48 hours post op.

Her abdominal wound was healing well
