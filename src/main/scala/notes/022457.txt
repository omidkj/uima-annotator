IMAGING

[**5-1**]-CXR-Right basilar pleural effusion with consolidation which
could reflect atelectasis or pneumonia.
.
[**5-3**]-chest CT-1. Two new pulmonary nodules within the right
lung. Given patient's high- risk status of emphysema, a CT chest
in 3 months after drainage of right pleural effusion is
recommended for further evaluation.
2. Cholelithiasis. Probable distal CBD stones in which ERCP
would be both confirmatory and theraputic.
3. Three-vessel coronary artery calcification. Prominent left
axillary lymph node.
4. Right-sided pleural thickening presumably associated with old
rib fractures.
.
cytology pleural fluid-Pleural fluid:

  NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

  Mesothelial cells, histiocytes, and lymphocytes.
.

CT chest 5/19-1. Persistent moderate-to-large right-sided
pleural effusion.
2. Persistent pulmonary nodules within the right lung. Followup
CT within three months is recommended.
3. Cholelithiasis, unchanged.
4. Three vessel coronary artery calcification.
5. Left axillary and pretracheal lymph node which is enlarged.
6. Stable old rib fractures, some of which demonstrate nonunion
.

CTA 5/21-1. There is significant interval increase in the
multi-loculated right pleural effusion with almost complete
atelectasis of the right lower lobe and to a lesser extent of
the right upper lobe as described above.

2. No pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection. There is
extensive coronary atherosclerosis noted.
.

echo [**5-15**]-The left atrium is normal in size. There is moderate
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2171-10-29**],
the findings are similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 72M with ESRD on HD, HTN, DM2, PAD, CMML, diastolic
dysfunction presented with pleural effusion. Decompensated in
setting of SVT during dialysis, now resolved.
.
On the day of admission, while at HD, the pt became very
tachycardic (SVT to the 150s, ? atrial flutter) and had
associated chest pain radiating to the jaw and diaphroesis. His
tachycardia converted back to sinus rhythm.
.
He underwent thoracentesis [**5-2**]. Results were consistent with an
exudative pleural effusion. Repeat chest CT demonstrated
persistent pleural effusion, and a CTA on the day of transfer to
the ICU demonstrated significant interval increase in pleural
effusion with almost complete atelectasis of the RLL.
.
Upon transfer to the ICU, the pt did not have any complaints
other than some mild wheezing. He denied chest or jaw pain,
shortness of breath, diaphroesis or nausea.
.
#Pleural effusion: Was found to be exudative by Light's
criteria. Ddx included PE, TB, malignancy, parapneumonic
effusion, hemothorax. There was no evidence of PE on CTA. He had
a significant travel history, but reports a negative PPD in the
past. This, coupled with the lack of cavitary lesion(s) on CT,
makes TB unlikely. There was no pneumonic infiltrate, no fever
and no white count to suggest an underlying pneumonia. His Hct
has been stable, although the fluid did reaccumulate so fast
that a hemothorax [**1-18**] a complication of the initial
thoracentesis. Given his significant smoking hx, malignancy is
high on the differential. Exactly why the effusion reaccumulated
so quickly is unclear, although it does suggest a possible
hemothorax.
IP performed thoracentesis with chest tube placement and
obtained 1.5L of red/blood-like fluid  he was then taken to the
OR one day later for VATs.
While in the ICU he became hypotensive to 70's requiring 3L of
IVF and also was noticed to have a HCT to 24 for which he was
transfused 2 units PRBCs. He was started on vanc/zosyn for broad
coverage but this was discontinued after his BP stabilized and
there was no evidence of infection.  In addition CXR showed
possible recumulation of fluid in the R.lung field.
His vitals stabilized and he was transferred to the medical
floor where he remained on 2l nc.  He had his chest tube removed
without inciddent and a follow up CXR did not show
reaccumulation.
Wet read on his pathology from VATS showed reactive
histiocytosis, fibrinous changes, no evidence of CMML
involvement or pulmonary/mesothelial malignancy.
