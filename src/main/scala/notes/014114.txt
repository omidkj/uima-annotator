Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
75 yo M h/o CAD s/p [**11-3**] DES, HTN, DM2, HLD, diastolic CHF (EF
in [**6-29**] 45-50%) with recent admission for chest pain, s/p
catheterization, p/w recurring chest pain today had received
balloon angioplasty in the AM.
.
Patient noticed chest pain, similar in quality to his previous
angina pain while shaving this morning. The pain was described
as moderate, located at midsternal region, dull in quality, and
responded partially to nitroglycerine X3. Patient came to work
and went to a conference, and his chest pain exacerbated,
despite nitroglycerin use. Upon arrival to the ED, there was no
EKG changs or elevation of troponin. Cardiology was called, and
decision was made to re-cath.
In the cath lab, there was a 60-70% stenosis of the LCX, with
widely patent stents, balloon angioplasty was perfromed from LCX
into L main, and no stents were placed. Patient's chest pain
resolved 30 mins during the procedure, but not temporally
associated with PCTA.
.
Of note, on [**6-26**] patient was admitted for chest pain, and was
taken to cardiac catheterization with DES to RCA ostium given
in-stent restenosis (70-80%). Six days later ([**7-2**]) patient had
similar chest pain, underwent another catheterization with stent
placement in LCx, and resulted in normal flow, with no
dissection or residual stenosis.
.
On arriving the CVICU, patient had VS of T 96.5, HR 80, BP
105/51, O2 Sat 98% on 2L. He is free of chest pain or shortness
breath.
.
No h/o of TIA, stroke, PE, DVT. ROS otherwise negative.

PERTINENT STUDIES
PTCA COMMENTS: The left coronary artery was engaged with a XB
3.5
guide catheter providing good support. Initial plan was to cross
the
lesion involving the ostial circumflex by a RADI pressure wire,
but due
to the severe angulation and newly deployed stents in the
proximal LCX,
this was not technically possible. After much difficulty, a
Choice PT
[**Name (NI) 9165**] intermediate wire was delivered across the lesion with
the help
of an Echelon microcatheter. A Pilot 50 wire was positioned in a
large
ramus intermedius branch. At this point patient started
complaining of
chest pain ([**7-1**]) which was unresponsive to IV and IC
nitroglycerin at
high doses. In view of severe chest pain, the ostium of the left

circumflex coronary artery was treated by multiple balloon
inflations to
a maximum of 10 atm with a 2.0 x 12 mm Apex OTW, followed by a
2.5 x 12
OTW balloon. Patient's chest pain improved to about [**3-1**] very
slowly
over the next 15-30 minutes. At this point, we took notice of
very slow
flow in a small caliber first OM branch whose origin had a
90-95%
stenosis and was jailed by the previously deployed proximal LCX
stent.
However, on review of previous angiograms, it was apparent that
the slow
flow in that branch was not a new phenomenon. In view of
uncertainty
about a definitive culprit lesion, patient was admitted to CCU
for
further observation and management. The arterial sheath in the
left
groin was pulled and manual pressure held with excellent
hemostasis.
Final angiograms obtained after PCI showed no dissection,
perforation or
any other mechanical complication.

ETT ([**2136-7-6**]):
This 75 year old man with h/o multiple PCIs most recent PCI to
RCA on [**2136-6-26**] and PTCA to Cx on [**2136-7-4**] was referred to the lab
for evaluation of chest pain. The patient exercised for 4.25
minutes of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4001**] protocol (~ 2.9 METS), representing a
limited exercise tolerance for his age. Test was stopped due to
bilateral hip pain. No chest, neck, back, or arm discomforts
were reported by the patient throughout the study. In the
presence of baseline inferolateral NSSTTW, there was ~0.5-1 mm
of upsloping ST segment depression in
