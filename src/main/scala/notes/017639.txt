[**2124-7-18**] Pathology Tissue: BONE FIRST METATARSAL,
A. Bone, 1st right metatarsal (A):
Bone with some reparative changes; cartilage with some
degenerative changes.
B. Skin, right 2nd toe (B):
Skin with ulceration, granulation tissue, fibrosis, chronic
inflammation, and fibrinopurulent exudate.
C. Bone, 2nd toe (C):
Bone with some reparative changes; no significant acute
inflammation noted.
Cartilage with degenerative changes

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2124-7-19**]: A single upright portable film of
the chest on [**7-19**] at 2051 hours. Sternal sutures are in place
from previous surgery, the diaphragm is high bilaterally which
is presumably due to position and a poor inspiratory effort. The
heart is enlarged to the left thoracic margin, unchanged since
[**Month (only) 205**]. There now appears to be some increased density at the left
base consistent with atelectasis or infiltrate

UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS  [**2124-7-19**]: No evidence of deep venous
thrombosis in the left lower extremity

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2124-7-22**]: Resolving left lower lobe opacity,
likely atelectasis

FOOT AP,LAT & OBL RIGHT  [**2124-7-29**]: Post-op films following
amputation of the right second toe at the metatarsophalangeal
joint.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**7-18**]: Pt was admitted same day for correction of severe hammertoe
and bunion deformity of R foot. Pt tolerated the procedure well
without any complications (see op note for details). Pt w/
undiagnosed bleeding disorder and instructions were given from
Pt's Heme/Onc physician for perioperative medications/recs
including pre and post op DDAVP (desmopressin). Postoperatively,
R 2nd digit was noted to be mildly dusky but still warm with
adequate CRT with pin intact. Pt [**Name (NI) 20851**]
[**7-19**]: POD1; Low grade temps, VSS; R 2nd toe continued to be dusky
but warm, pin still in tact. Dsgs clean and dry. c/o L calf
pain. Venous ultrasound neg for DVT.
[**7-20**]: Temp spike o/n to 101.9 w/ c/o nausea and chills. EKG w/ no
changes and portable CXR w/atelectesis, LLL effusion. White
count bump to 12.9. Incisions still dry, sutures in tact to R
foot but 2nd toe remaining dusky so pin was pulled without
incident. IS was encourage and Pt was also pan cultured and
foley d/c'd. Cipro was added for broadened coverage.  Pt
evaluated and cleared by PT for TDWB through heel.
[**7-21**]: Cont w/ low grade fevers, VSS. Continued bibasilar crackles
though improving. R 2nd toe cont to be warm but color worsening
with white count increasing to 14.  Med consulted for fever who
rec switching to levo and flagyl for questionnable PNA. Also
believe toe is source. ? ECHO if fevers cont. Pt w/ h/o
neurogenic bladder s/o mult bladder suspensions but with urinary
incontinence since foley removed. Bladder scanned showing
>400ccs. Urology curbsided and believed cause likely [**12-17**]
overflow and recommended replace foley until day of discharge
and at that time trial void her and get post void residual. [**Month (only) 116**]
need foley on discharge if doesn't improved
[**7-22**]: (POD4) Pt still spiking fevers to 101.3 while VSS. To date
all Ucx, UA, Bcx were negative but toe worsening in color.
Sutures along dorsal 2nd toe were removed at bedside revealing
necrotic base; Wcx were taken. Lesion flushed and packed open.
White count improving.
[**7-23**]: Cont low grade temps but white count improving. Remaining
sutures prox to 2nd toe removed [**12-17**] incrased drainage and packed
w/ betadine; [**Last Name (un) **] consulted for irregular blood glucose
levels. Medicine unconvinced of any clear signs of PNA but would
cont to monitor for endocarditis/graft infection. Pt made NPO
after MN for possible OR debridment vs amputation next day.
[**7-24**]: OR for open 2nd toe amp. Pt tolerated procedure well (see
op note for details). Postoperatively, Pt doing well still with
low grade temps but white count completely resolved.
[**7-25**]: (POD 7,1) Afebrile o/n w/ VSS. Amp site clean, red and
granular with appropriate bleeding. Cont Abx and NWB RLE.
[**2130-7-27**]: Cont [**Month/Day/Year 20851**]; Amp site clean and granular. 2U PRBC infused
for low Hct with appropriate bump.  Bedside wcx growing pseudo,
coag(-) staph and enterococcus. Cultures from sterile intraop
tissue growing coag (-) staph and enterococcus and GNR. Pt made
NPO for amp closure next day.
[**7-28**]: OR for R 2nd toe amp closure (see op note for details). Pt
tolerated procedure well with uncomplicated postop; [**Month/Year (2) 20851**].
