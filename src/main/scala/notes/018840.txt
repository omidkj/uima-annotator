Admission Date:  [**2160-6-19**]     Discharge Date:  [**2160-6-26**]

Date of Birth:   [**2086-6-5**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74 year old
male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft times
three, most recently [**7-16**], and coronary stents, who
complains of shortness of breath with chest pain times one
day.  He described a nonproductive cough for the past two
months, but has had worsened cough overnight.  He also
complains of fevers and chills on the day of admission.  The
patient presented to his primary care physician's office on
the morning of admission and was noted to be tachycardic to
120s and shaky.  He also vomited times one.  On evaluation in
the Emergency Department, the patient's vital signs were
temperature of 103.8, heart rate 120, blood pressure 90/50,
respiratory rate 16, oxygen saturation 94% in room air.  He
received Aspirin, Tylenol, had two sets of blood cultures
drawn and received 1.5 liters of normal saline in addition to
Levofloxacin and Ceftriaxone.  While in the Emergency
Department, the patient had episodes of hypotension with
systolic pressure in the 60s, though he mentated and did not
feel lightheaded at any time.  He was admitted to the CCU for
further management.

Significant cardiac history includes a transthoracic
echocardiogram in [**8-16**], which demonstrated moderately
dilated left ventricle with ejection fraction of 50%,
anterior, anteroseptal, and inferior akinesis and
hypokinesis, and depressed right ventricular function with 2+
mitral regurgitation.  Cardiac catheterization [**2159-9-16**], resulted in stenting of the saphenous vein graft to OM1
and OM2.   Prior coronary artery bypass graft redo in [**2159-7-16**], included left internal mammary artery to left anterior
descending, radial artery to posterior descending artery,
saphenous vein graft to D1, saphenous vein graft to D2,
saphenous vein graft to OM1 and saphenous vein graft to OM2.
Exercise stress test on [**2160-4-28**], resulted in a rate pressure
product of 11,900, modified [**Doctor First Name **] protocol.  The patient
exercised for nine minutes and stopped due to fatigue with no
anginal equivalents and an uninterpretable electrocardiogram.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a distant tobacco history,
discontinued almost forty years ago.  He lives at home by
himself.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient
has a temperature of 100.9, heart rate 100, blood pressure
67/40, respiratory rate 22, oxygen saturation 95% on two
liters by nasal cannula.  In general, the patient was a
pleasant elderly male in no apparent distress.  Head and neck
examination revealed moist mucous membranes, anicteric
sclera, normal jugular venous distention.  Lungs had crackles
at the bases bilaterally with decreased breath sounds at the
right lower lobe.  Cardiovascular examination revealed
tachycardia with normal S1 and S2 and a II/VI systolic murmur
best heard at the apex.  Abdomen was benign with no
tenderness.  Extremities had no edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count was 8.6, hematocrit
30.4, and platelet count 195,000.  There was a left shift
with 86% neutrophils and 9% lymphocytes.  Coagulation studies
demonstrated a prothrombin time of 14.5, INR 1.4.  Panel
seven was significant for a blood urea nitrogen of 32 and
creatinine of 1.0.  Two sets of cardiac enzymes revealed
sequential CKs of 54 and 62 with MB of 1.0 and 0.9,
respectively.  Urinalysis showed no nitrites and no leukocyte
esterase.

Chest x-ray demonstrated prominent pulmonary vasculature with
small left pleural effusion and retrocardiac haziness read as
atelectasis versus consolidation.

Electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia of 120 beats
per minute, with normal axis, left bundle branch block,
unchanged from prior electrocardiogram in [**2159-11-16**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Hypotension - The patient was thought to be septic and
thus received fluid resuscitation in the Emergency
Department.  A right internal jugular central venous catheter
was placed and initial CVPs were measured at 3.0 to 4.0 of
water.  The patient's diuretics and antihypertensive
medications were held, and he was started on Neo-Synephrine
to maintain his blood pressure.  The suspected source of
infection was a pneumonia, although an abdominal process
could not be ruled out given recent hospitalization at the
[**Hospital3 2358**] six months prior with abdominal pain.
Therefore, the patient was started on Levofloxacin and
Flagyl.  On the second day of hospitalization, the patient's
white blood cell count peaked at 20.2 with a continued left
shift.  he had a temperature spike of 101.6, and subsequent
blood cultures, urine cultures, and sputum cultures were all
negative.  His white blood cell count subsequently normalized
within two days and he remained afebrile thereafter through
the rest of his hospitalization.  In addition, the
Neo-Synephrine was quickly weaned off within 48 hours of
admission and he required no further pressor support.  The
patient will complete a ten day course of Levofloxacin and
Flagyl for sepsis with suspected pneumonia as the source.

2.  Congestive heart failure - Following his fluid
resuscitation, the patient appeared to be in mild congestive
failure with tachypnea and hypoxia.  He was diuresed with
Lasix and then switched over to his outpatient regimen.  He
continued to diurese for several days, after which he felt at
his baseline respiratory status.  Electrophysiology was
consulted, and they recommend biventricular pacing as
possible aid to his congestive heart failure.  This will be
addressed on a return visit as an outpatient.

3.  Coronary artery disease - The patient ruled out for
myocardial infarction, and had no further episodes of chest
pain.  He was continued on his Aspirin and had no evidence of
ischemia during his hospitalization.

4.  Arrhythmias - During his first night of hospitalization,
the patient had a twenty beat run of nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia.  He had additional episodes of nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia on ablators and should thus have an
AICD placed.  Due to his recent sepsis, the patient should
complete his antibiotic course and return as an outpatient
for placement of his AICD as well as biventricular pacer.  He
was started on Amiodarone for his arrhythmias, and should
continue this until follow-up with Electrophysiology.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient was discharged in stable
condition to home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Pneumonia.
2.  Sepsis.
3.  Congestive heart failure.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. once daily.
2.  Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. once daily times three days.
3.  Metronidazole 500 mg p.o. three times a day times three
days.
4.  Digoxin 125 mcg p.o. once daily.
5.  Furosemide 40 mg p.o. twice a day.
6.  Spironolactone 25 mg p.o. once daily.
7.  Klonopin 0.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. and 0.25 mg p.o. twice a day.
8.  Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. three times a day times three
weeks.
9.  Carvedilol 3.125 mg p.o. twice a day.

DISCHARGE PLAN:

weeks for placement of AICD as well as biventricular pacer.
4.  The patient should continue taking Klonopin which was
prescribed by his outpatient psychiatr
