Reason: eval for pneumothorax s/p chest tube removal

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
84 year old man s/p AVR
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

CHEST RADIOGRAPH

Comparison with [**2160-1-10**].

Left-sided chest tube has been removed. The left hemidiaphragm
has returned to its normal position. No pneumothorax. Small
atelectasis right. No pulmonary opacities, no signs of cardiac
failure.

Findings
This study was compared to the report of the prior study (images
not available) of [**2148-12-27**].
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Mildly depressed
LVEF. No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
Paradoxic septal motion consistent with prior cardiac surgery.

AORTA: Moderately dilated ascending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis (AVR).
Normal AVR gradient. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral valve
chordae. No MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Tricuspid valve not well visualized. Borderline
PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.
Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Conclusions
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is difficult to assess but appears mildly
depressed (LVEF= 40 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is moderately
dilated. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
transaortic gradient is normal for this prosthesis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2148-12-27**], a bioprosthetic AVR is now present.
The severity of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation has
decreased, although image quality is technically suboptimal.
Overall left ventricular function appears at least mild to
moderately depressed.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Name13 (STitle) 97422**] was admitted the evening before surgery.  The next
am he was brought to the operating room and underwent a redo
sternotomy and aortic valve replacement.  Please see operative
report for further details.  He tolerated the procedure well
except for complete heart block with swan ganz insertion, and
was transferred to the CSRU for invasive monitoring.  He
required pressors and fluid for blood pressure management and
returned to the operating room on post operative day one for
bleeding and removal of clot. Om post operative day 2 he was
weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact, and was
extubated.  His platlet count had decreased to 58 and HIT was
sent that was negative.  He also went into atrial fibrillation
and was started on beta blockers for rate control, no amiodarone
was given due to heart block intra and post op day 1.  Diuretics
were started and he was gently diuresised towards his
preoperative weight.  On post operative day three chest tubes
were removed and he was transferred to the post operative floor.
 He continued to remain in atrial fibrillation and coumadin was
started for anticoagulation.  Physical followed him during
entire post-op course for strength and mobility. His beta
block
