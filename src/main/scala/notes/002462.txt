Service:  BLUE SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 82 year-old male
who was emergently transferred from the [**Hospital 4068**] Hospital with
ascending cholangitis.  He presented with abdominal pain and
dehydration.  His laboratories upon admission were white
count of 11,600.  His total bilirubin was 3.3, his ALT was
131, AST 697, amylase 48, PTT 22.2.  His INR was 1.1.  His CT
scan was consistent with a common bile duct stone.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for emphysema,
hypertension, chronic renal failure, renal insufficiency,
Parkinson's, history of pneumonia, deep venous thrombosis,
status post left nephrectomy, status post splenectomy.  He
has an allergy to penicillin.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Synthroid, Lasix, Verapamil,
Sinemet, cimetidine and he had been started on Vancomycin,
Levaquin and Flagyl at the [**Hospital 4068**] Hospital.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon admission was significant for a
temperature of 98.4, heart rate 115, 104/59, 22, 94 percent.
On examination his neck was supple.  He was tachycardic.  He
was clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His abdomen was
slightly distended, tender to palpation in the right upper
quadrant with guarding.  He had deceased bowel sounds.  He
was guaiac negative and no masses on rectal examination.
Laboratories were as mentioned.

He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for an emergent
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.  He was
n.p.o. on strict antibiotics.  As mentioned he was admitted
to the Intensive Care Unit.  The endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography completed on [**2167-4-29**] at 11 P.M.
revealed a dilated irregular common bile duct with multiple
large filling defects.  Additional images showed a wire which
transversed the dilated extrahepatic biliary system.  Final
image showed a pig-tail catheter in place traversing the
common duct.  The actual description of the ERCP is as
follows:  The biliary duct was cannulated at and a
sphincterotomy was performed.  Copious purulent discharge was
returned from the common bile duct consistent with ascending
cholangitis.  Diffuse dilation was seen of the common bile
duct with the common bile duct measuring 15 mm.  Irregular
stones ranging in size from 5 to 10 mm that were causing the
partial obstruction were seen at the common bile duct.  There
was post obstructive dilatation.  A solitary stone was
extracted from this vessel using a sphincterotome.  A 5 cm x
#10 French double pig-tail biliary stent was placed
successfully in the common bile duct using a standard
introducer kit.  The impression at that time was
periampullary diverticulum, suppurative cholangitis,
choledocholithiasis, biliary dilatation and a successful
biliary sphincterotomy along with partial clearance of the
common bile duct stone with successful placement of a double
pig-tail stent in the common bile duct.  The patient was
readmitted to the Intensive Care Unit where he remained
stabilized on levofloxacin, Flagyl and Vancomycin.  He was on
Neo-Synephrine drip at .25 and a dopamine drip at 5.  He was
afebrile with stable vital signs at that time.  His drips
were weaned off on [**2167-5-7**].  He received fluid hydration
overnight for hypovolemia.  Patient continued to do well.  A
right radial line was placed on [**2167-5-7**] without complication.
On [**2167-5-8**], hospital day number five, the patient required
intubation for respiratory distress.  He was started on
propofol and dopamine.  He was diuresed with some success.
At that time he was on assist control.  He was assessed by
nutrition at that time who recommended total parenteral
nutrition repletion of electrolytes and a feeding tube.  He
was successfully extubated on [**2167-5-8**] and was continued on
TPN and tube feeds. He was still on Vancomycin, Levaquin and
Flagyl at this time. His temperature maximum was 100.5.  On
[**2167-5-13**] a chest x-ray revealed nasogastric tube tip in the
distal esophagus which was repositioned.  A right IJ central
venous catheter was in the distal superior vena cava.  There
was small bilateral pleural effusion with a tortuous aorta.
There were bilateral [**Location (un) 931**] rods and a spinal stimulator
were in place as well.

Physical Therapy evaluated the patient on [**2167-5-11**] and
recommended bed motility, transfer and hemodynamic stability
prior to increased activity.  He continued to be stabilized
and was screened for rehabilitation over the next few days of
his hospitalization.  His Dopamine drip was weaned off and he
remained afebrile on broad spectrum antibiotics.  He had a
video swallow examination for dysphagia which revealed no
evidence of frank aspiration.  At this time honey thick and
nectar thickened liquids and soft diet were recommended.  It
was also recommended that he eat foods that had the same
consistency, i.e. no milk and cereal.  He was seen by
cardiology on [**2167-5-14**] for his continued hypotension.  He was
continued in the Intensive Care Unit through [**2167-5-17**] at which
point he was transferred to the floor.  His temperature was
97.2 and his blood pressure was 116/53 on no drips.  His
white count was 5.7.  His creatinine was 1.6 and he was
making adequate urine.

He continued to do well and his antibiotics were discontinued
on [**2167-5-19**].  At this time he remained afebrile.  He was seen
by Physical Therapy and they approved him for rehabilitation
screening.  He was seen by nutrition and he was tolerating
adequate p.o. and did not need a Dobbhoff tube.  He was much
more alert and oriented and was deemed stable from this
vantage point as well.  Chest x-ray obtained on [**2167-5-19**]
revealed improved congestive heart failure with improving
bilateral pleural effusion.  It showed improvement in his
lung volumes with a decrease in the bibasilar atelectasis.
He had culture data, blood cultures from [**5-5**] which had
no growth.  He had sputum culture also from the 20th which
was also negative for any organism.
