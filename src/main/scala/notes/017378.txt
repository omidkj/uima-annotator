History of Present Illness:
HPI: This is an 80yo F transferred from [**Hospital3 15402**] with Type A
aortic dissection. She presented today  with shortness of breath
and had a CTA as part of this work-up which revealed dissection
of the aortic root to brachiocephalic artery with 7cm aneurysm.
Cardiac enzymes and BNP were within normal limits. At the OSH
she was given ASA, solumedrol 125, labetalol and she was
medflighted to [**Hospital1 18**] for surgical management. In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED
her VS were 144/54, HR 91, RR 18, 93% 3L n/c at OSH they were HR
114  RR 24  BP 109/72. She was started on esmolol and
nitroprusside drips. Her nitroprusside drip has been weaned off
and her BP on transfer was 121/66.
.
She has declined surgical therapy and expressed wishes not to
have cardiac resuscitation or intubation. CT surgery had seen
patient in ED, explained risk/benefit. Patient understands and
still declined surgery. Patient is therefore admitted to the CCU

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: This is an 80 yo female presenting with
type A aortic dissection, likely [**1-30**] pre-existing aortic
aneurysm; declining surgical therapy.
.
# Type A Aortic dissection: Treatment is surgical; however
despite extensive discussion with Cardiothoracic surgeons on
[**1-18**]/007 at [**Hospital1 18**] ED, Ms. [**Known lastname 70507**] continues to decline any such
aggressive measures. She understands that she is at a very high
likelihood of death without any intervention.  Her mortality is
unfortunately quite high (60% in-house mortality, often worse
mortality for painless dissection).  Patient's blood pressure
was controlled with esmolol and nitroprusside initially and
should continue to be at goal of SBP 100-120.  Her goal HR
should continue to be in the 60s.  Patient is currently stable
and will be discharged home with ambulance and continued 24 hour
care there.  Family and the patient understands her high
mortality risk and if the situation worsens it will become
unstable quickly.   Patient was not found to have other
complications such as bleeding as her HCT remained stable while
in the hospital.  There was no clinical signs of heart failure,
AI, acute myocardial ischemia or other organ ischemia or CVA.
Patient has been known to have known aneurysm for 3 years with
initial surgical evaluation on [**2157-6-28**] with echo confirmed AAA
of 6.8 cm at that time.  These findings were confirmed with PCP.
.
# Shortness of breath: [**Month (only) 116**] also be secondary to her underlying
emphysema with continued tobacco use.  Patient oxygenation above
95% on 2L upon discharge.  Patient with chronic 2 L O 2
requirement at home.  CXR at OSH showed only mild CHF, and only
5% of acute aortic dissection presents without chest pain.  Her
SOB will be managed further at home as [**Month (only) **] care will be
visiting her and further treatment will be discussed at that
time.   She was instructed to monitor for signs of volume
overload and resume her home dose lasix.  Patient was also
instructed to continue on her prednisone taper at home.
