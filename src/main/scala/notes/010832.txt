Mechanical Ventilation, Central Venous Cannulation


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 83 y/o man with PMH of COPD, prior NSTEMI,
and hypertension who presented with respiratory failure. Patient
was at home with increasing respiratory symptoms (productive
cough, fever) X 3 days. He was noted by his daughter (who is RN
case manager at [**Hospital1 18**]) to be cyanotic while having his breakfast
on the morning of admission. Decided to take him to [**Hospital1 18**]; on
the way to car, the patient collapsed and was placed in the car
by his daughter & son-in-law. [**Name (NI) **] was en route to [**Hospital1 18**] with his
daughter when his breathing became acutely worse; she then took
him to [**Hospital3 1443**] hospital as she was near the exit. She
reports that he became pulseless in the car. On the ED
physician's initial evaluation, the patient was noted to be
cyanotic, unresponsive with very low respirations, and without a
pulse. With bagging, reportedly his cyanosis improved as did his
bradycardia and blood pressure. Initial vitals at [**Hospital1 487**] were
rectal temp 97, oxygen sats 90 with bagging (pulse noted in
nursing note and HR 40 in sinus brady). After intubated, copious
amounts of greenish sputum were suctioned. He was treated with
avelox IV X 1 as well as ativan for agitation.
.
On arrival to our ED, initial vitals with BP 80/50, T 99.9, HR
80, and O2 sat 100% (on vent). Central venous access was placed
(right subclavian) and the patient was placed on dopamine with
increase in blood pressures to 120s-130s systolic. He received
zosyn 4.5 g X 1, clindamycin 600 mg IV X 1, solumedrol 125 mg IV
X 1, and versed 2 mg. Noted to be guaiac negative. He received a
total of 3 L NS and 1 L LR.
.
He is noted by his PCP to serially refuse influenza vaccination
but did have the pnuemococcal vaccine in [**2-6**]. Recent PCP visit
in [**2-7**] notes oxygen saturation 83% on room air at rest and 79%
on room air with ambulation. He was previously on home oxygen
which was recently reinstituted at 1 L/min at night

[**4-16**] CXR: The patient has been intubated with the distal tip of
the
endotracheal tube approximately 5.4 cm from the carina. There is
widening of the mediastinum, likely due to underlying body
habitus and aortic tortuosity. However, in the setting of
trauma, mediastinal vascular injury cannot be entirely excluded.
The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits for size. No
definite consolidation is noted, however, subtle increased
density is seen along the lateral aspects of the right lung,
likely due to overlying soft tissue. In the more superior
aspect, there is an abnormal density resembling a reverse "P"
which may be extrinsic to the patient. Minimal left basilar
atelectasis is also evident. No definite effusion or
pneumothorax is seen.
IMPRESSION: Endotracheal tube in satisfactory position as above.

.
[**4-17**] portable CXR:  Interval placement of nasogastric tube with
the proximal side hole near the GE junction.  Otherwise, stable
radiographic appearance of the chest with left lower lobe
atelectasis.
.
[**4-18**] portable CXR: In the interim, the upper mediastinal vessels
including the azygos vein are less engorged on today's
examination.  The pulmonary opacification seen in both lungs
predominantly at the lung bases has decreased with better
identification of the pulmonary vessels.  Scarcity of the
vessels in the upper lobes reflects underlying emphysematous
lung changes.  The pulmonary arteries are prominent in keeping
with patient's pulmonary arterial hypertension.  The heart is
not enlarged.  There is no pleural effusion. The endotracheal
tube is approximately 4.2 cm above the carina.  A right
central line ends in the upper SVC.  A feeding tube tip is out
of view on this examination. IMPRESSION: 1.  Gradual decrease of
