Service:  PLASTIC SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 52-year-old
with a history of asthma, hypothyroidism, and lobular
carcinoma in situ who was referred to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] for
reconstruction after a planned bilateral mastectomy.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for asthma,
hypothyroidism, gastroesophageal reflux disease,
fibromyalgia, and scoliosis.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Includes breast biopsy x 2 in [**2182**]
and [**2185**], partial thyroidectomy in [**2177**], bilateral tubal
ligation and sinus surgery in [**2186**].

HOME MEDICATIONS:  Include Levoxyl 112 mcg per day, Prevacid,
albuterol as needed, and Nasonex as needed.

ALLERGIES:  Include penicillin, Duricef and Keflex.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her preadmission physical examination
revealed a chest which was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Breast examination revealed status post biopsy with no
masses, discharge or retraction.  Cardiac examination:
Regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen:  No pain, mass or hernia.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 6.0, hemoglobin
11.8, hematocrit 34.0, platelet count 293.  PT 12.5, INR 1.1,
PTT 28.4.  Sodium 141, potassium 3.7, chloride 100,
bicarbonate 27, BUN 17, creatinine 0.6, glucose 79.  She had
an ALT of 28, an AST of 27, alkaline phosphatase 60, total
bilirubin 0.8, total protein 7.1, albumin 4.1.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Procedure:  Bilateral mastectomy by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 11635**] of General Surgery and reconstruction on the
right-hand side with a free TRAM flap, and on the left with a
pedical TRAM flap by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of Plastic Surgery.
Intraoperative ins and outs:  Total in was 11,600.  She
received two units of autologous red blood cells.  Her output
included an estimated blood loss of 800 ml, and urine output
of 800 ml, for a total output of 1600 ml.  Her postoperative
hematocrit was 26.2.  Postoperative antibiotics:  Vancomycin.
Deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis included SCG boots and
subcutaneous heparin.  Pain control was managed with morphine
as needed.

Of note, the patient experienced some airway edema and was
sent to the Trauma Surgical Intensive Care Unit, intubated
and on a ventilator postoperatively to manage her airway.

On postoperative day one, her examination revealed an alert
and oriented, extubated patient, without complaints.
Overnight she had a fever to 102.4 maximum temperature.
Vital signs were otherwise stable.  Urine output was
adequate.  [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains were putting out between 60
and 170 cc.  Her right breast incision was clean, dry and
intact.  There was no evidence of erythema.  Minimal
serosanguinous drainage.  Sensation was intact.  This breast
was the free flap, which had capillary refill of less than
three seconds, a Dopplerable pulse, continuous venous Doppler
signal.  Drains were patent, with serosanguinous fluid in the
left breast, which is the pedicle flap.  The incision was
clean, dry and intact.  There was no erythema, minimal
serosanguinous drainage.  Sensation was intact.  The flap was
warm and well perfused.  Capillary refill less than three
seconds.  Drains were patent, draining serosanguinous fluid.
Abdominal incision was clean, dry and intact, without
evidence of erythema.  The morning's laboratories included a
white count of 6.7, hematocrit 24.7, platelets 179.  Sodium
137, potassium 3.9, chloride 107, bicarbonate 25, BUN 13,
creatinine 0.5, glucose 118.

On postoperative day two, the patient was transferred to the
Vascular Intensive Care Unit.  She was without complaints,
although it was noted that her right Cook monitor was
malfunctioning.  Both flaps were viable at that time.  Vital
signs were stable.  She continued to be febrile to 102, and
defervesced to 99.7.

Postoperative day three revealed a stable patient who
remained slightly febrile but started to defervesce from
101.7 maximum to 100, and otherwise had no complaints.  It
was noted later in the day that she had fine crackles on her
physical examination.  She began to fell unwell, complained
of malaise, and had a rattling cough.  At that time, a full
fever workup, including chest x-ray, blood cultures, sputum
cultures and urine cultures were ordered.  In addition, in
association with this cough, she lowered her oxygen
saturation on room air to 88 to 90.  The chest x-ray was
suggestive for pneumonia with left basilar and right basilar
infiltrates.  It was also noted that the patient was
approximately 11 liters positive fluid balance since
admission, though she continued to diurese well.  Five mg of
lasix was administered intravenously, with good effect.

The following morning, on postoperative day four, the patient
stated that she was feeling much better, with decreasing
shortness of breath.  She was saturating 94% on 2 liters
nasal cannula.  Her bilateral breast flaps continued to do
very well, without any signs of infection.  The [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**]
drains were patent and continued to drain minimal
serosanguinous fluid.  Levofloxacin was begun on
postoperative day four to treat presumptive pneumonia.

Postoperative day five revealed a patient without complaints,
who was afebrile, with a maximum temperature of 99.2, and
oxygen saturation of 95% on room air.  The [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**]
drains continued to decrease their output to between 50 and
95 cc/day.  Physical examination continued to be good,
without evidence of infection and with viable flaps.  Her
lung examination showed decreasing crackles in the left and
right, improving from prior days.

Postoperative day six revealed the patient without
complaints, was afebrile for 24 hours, saturating 92% on room
air, with a continuing improvement in her respiratory
examination, and no evidence of infection in any of her
surgical sites.  She was stable.  A repeat chest x-ray was
obtained, which revealed improvement over the prior x-ray,
and evidence of pneumonia with some persistent bilateral
pleural effusions.

The patient was discharged on [**2189-8-13**].  Her discharge
examination revealed a stable patient with flaps warm and in
good condition.  Her drains x 4 were discontinued, and she
was scheduled to follow up next week in Plastic Surgery
Clinic.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Patient discharged to home.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Patient stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Percocet 325 mg/5 mg one to two tablets by mouth every
four to six hours as needed for pain
2.  Levofloxacin 500 mg by mouth once daily for seven days

FOLLOW-UP PLAN:  The patient is to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
in the Plastic Surgery Outpatient Clinic next week.  The
patient is to call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 17373**] to schedule an appointment.
Her discharge instructions include maintaining the incisions
clean and dry at all times.  The patient may shower, but
should pat the wounds dry afterwards.  No bathing or swimming
for four to six weeks.  She is not to drive while on pain
medications.
