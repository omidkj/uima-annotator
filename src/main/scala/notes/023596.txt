Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 18794**]
Chief Complaint:
Malaise

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Internal Jugular central line placement [**2121-6-5**]

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 59 yo M with PMHx type 1 DM complicated by b/l BKA (left
[**2113**] and right [**2118**]), neuropathy, retinopathy and nephropathy,
HTN, and COPD with extensive smoking history, OSA on BiPAP, who
presented to the ED with complainsts of acute onset
fatigue/malaise, weakness, and diarrhea. He woke up today
feeling unwell. He endorses a [**3-6**] day hx of loose non-bloody
diarrhea. He has not had any fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting,
or abdominal pain. No recent antibiotic use. He has had a
decreased appetite with decreased po recently. He denies any
dysuria, freuqency, or hematuria. He does note a worsening of a
chronic cough recently, with more SOB. He also states that he
has been unable to lie flat in his new bed due to SOB, and this
has been ongoign since his most recent hospital d/c in [**Month (only) 547**]
[**2121**]. By report, his PCA noted him to be less responsive at
home, and so they preented to the ED.

In ED, intial VS were 98.1 68 120/82 16 97, but in room was
noted to be 83% RA, with 2L bumped to 90-93%. Exam showed a
sleepy, disheveled, but alert and oriented male. Cellulitis and
yeast were noted under his pannus, so he was given vancomycin.
Stumps looked chroncially erythematous, not acutely infected.
Lungs were rhonchorous. No evidence of PNA on CXR and U/A was
clean but had "many bacteria" so he was also given levofloxacin
750mg. His left arm was thought to be more swollen, so an
ultrasound was performed, which was negative for DVT. Labs were
notable for leukocytosis to 14.8 with 90% polys (no bands),
hyperkalemia to 6.1 (verified), and acute on chronic renal
failure (2.4 from 1.7). CE's showed elevated toponin but at his
basline given renal failure. EKG showed NSR 66, no peaked Ts, no
ischemic changes. Received 30g kayexylate for hyperkalemia. His
BPs dropped to as low as 70/30, so a RIJ was placed. He received
5L NS, getting his 6th now. Levophed was started. Most recent
vital signs afebrile BP 119/82 60-70 16 92%4L. Sats were as low
as 85% (positionally), ABG drawn which was 7.27/50/61, and
patient was put on home BiPAP with improvement in O2 sats.

Of note the patient has had 3 admissions in [**2121**]. The first was
[**Date range (1) **], which started with a MICU stay for hypoxia,
hypercarbia and resultant lethargy. BiPap was used
intermittently with improvement in mental status and ventilation
at that time. He was readmitted 1 day after d/c ([**2036-3-20**]) for
dyspnea felt to be mutifactorial (PNA vs COP vs volume
overload), treated with levoflox x 10days, as well as an
Enterococcal UTI. He left AMA from that admission. He was most
recently admitted [**Date range (1) 92895**] for cellulitis of bilateral stumps,
treated initially with vancomycin but switched to bactrim on
discharge. That admission also featured an ICU stay for BiPAP to
treat hypoxia and hypercarbia felt due to chronic
hypoventilation from morbid obesity, COPD, and methadone use.

ADLs. Has VNA care who he says helps wash him, give him
medications and prepare his meals. He has spoked 1ppd x 40

Brief Hospital Course:
59 yo M with PMHx IDDM complicated by b/l BKA (left [**2113**] and
right [**2118**]), neuropathy, retinopathy and nephropathy, HTN, COPD
admitted with pannicular cellulitis and hypotension.
.
#. Hypotension - Likely secondary to recent diarrheal illness
and associated hypovolemia. Patient's blood pressure improved
with 5L of IV NS fluid resuscitation. There was no obvious
cellulitis of the pannicular region but rather a fungal/yeast
infection was noted. This was treated with miconazole and wound
care. CXR was without focal infiltrate and U/A was clean despite
"many bacteria" which likely was colonization. Stumps did not
look acutely infected. The patient was easily weaned off of
levophed on arrival to ICU.  He was initially covered with IV
vancomcyin from ED for any gram positive infection (does have a
hx of MRSA. Antibiotics were not continued upon admission to ICU
and the patient remained afebrile and HD stable.  His blood and
urine cultures were monitored and his blood pressure medication
was held initially. He was called out to the [**Year (4 digits) **] [**Hospital1 **] on
[**2121-6-6**] and monitored overnight prior to discharge. Cultures were
negative at time of discharge. His home amlodipine was restarted
at discharge as  his hypotension completely resolved (he was a
bit hypertensive to SBP 150s prior to reinitiation of
amlodipine).

# Hypoxia: Pt with known pulmonary comorbidities including OSA,
hypoventilation and COPD. He is a chronic retainer with baseline
pCO2 likely around high 40s, and he is slightly above this on
presentation per ED ABG. He is a methadone user and this may
also decrease his respiratory drive. No evidence of PNA. Admits
to not using BiPAP freuqently.  Stated he would try BiPAP while
in the hospital but refused this treatment daily.  Once clearly
improved, home dose of Methadone were restarted. His oxygen
saturation was 96% on RA on day of admission.

#. Acute on Chronic CKD: Pt with Cr 2.4 and at his baseline
1.8-2.0.  Improved status-post volume resuscitation.  Urine
lytes with FeNa 0.8 consistent with prerenal etiology. This
improved to 2.0 at the time of discharge.

# Orthopnea.  Patient complains of new orthopnea since recent
hospitalization.  BNP > 9000 on admission.  Echo obtained on
[**2121-6-6**] which showed overall low normal left ventricular systolic
function (LVEF 50%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion were normal, and no valvular disease was seen.

#. COPD: Pt with extensive smoking history. No wheezing on exam,
was
