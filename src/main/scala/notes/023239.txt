Admission Date:  [**2192-10-1**]       Discharge Date:  [**2192-10-4**]


Service:  [**Company 191**]

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female
with a history of pruritic dermatitis, chronic renal
insufficiency, and hypertension presenting on [**2192-10-1**] with hypotension and changes in mental status after
being started on a new medication, Atarax, for her pruritus.
The day prior to admission, the patient became very confused,
averbal, and on the day of admission began to develop jerky
movements of her head and extremities.  She then became
unresponsive.  She was brought to the Emergency Room at [**Hospital3 **] and was given Ativan and developed a drop in her blood
pressure systolic from 100 to the 70s.  She was then started
on a dopamine drip at the rate of 15 which was subsequently
decreased to 5. She was treated with Flagyl, vancomycin,
ceftriaxone and given 2.5 liters of normal saline with Lasix
for decreased oxygenation and crackles.  She was transferred
to the SICU.  She had a temperature of 90.4, blood pressure
111/36, pulse 66, saturating 97% on 2 liters.  Her urinalysis
on transfer was negative for infection.  Her head CT was
negative for bleed.  Her chest x-ray showed a retrocardiac
consolidation consistent with a possible aspiration
pneumonia.

The patient's presentation was thought to be consistent with
septic shock.  She was continued on antibiotics and started
on Levophed in addition to dopamine for pressure support.
Her laboratories were significant for hypernatremia secondary
to a free water deficit, acute renal failure probably
secondary to volume depletion and decreased perfusion, a mild
myocardial infarction with an increased troponin T of 0.15
from a decreased perfusion as well as an acidemia.  The
patient remained minimally responsive in the SICU.  She has a
do not intubate/do not resuscitate status.

The ICU Team discussed the patient's poor prognosis with her
family and the decision was made on [**2192-10-3**] in the
morning to make the patient comfort measures only.  All
pressors were stopped as well as her antibiotics.  The
patient remained unresponsive and on a morphine drip for
comfort.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  The patient
had a temperature of 90.4, pulse 66, blood pressure 111/36,
respiratory rate 22, saturating 97% on 2 liters.  She had a
generalized exfoliative dermatitis, lying in bed.  HEENT:
The mucous membranes were moist.  Cardiac:  A regular rate
and rhythm, no murmurs.  Lungs:  Coarse breath sounds
bilaterally.  No wheezes or crackles.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:
Diffuse weeping, erythematous excoriations over her lower
extremities, abdomen, and arm.  Neurologic:  She was
unresponsive.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  On admission, the patient had a
white count of 5.2, hematocrit 30.5.  Sodium 152, potassium
5.4, BUN 78, creatinine of 3.1.  INR 1.4.  ABGs revealed a pH
of 7.3, C02 35, 02 84.  Liver function tests were within
normal limits.

ASSESSMENT:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with a history of
pruritic dermatitis, hypertension, chronic renal
insufficiency presenting with septic shock probably secondary
to an aspiration pneumonia, changes in mental status as well
as hypotension.  The patient is currently receiving comfort
measures only.  The patient remains unresponsive off all
pressors and antibiotics.  She appears very comfortable.  We
will continue a morphine drip titrated to the patient's
comfort.  She remains DNR/DNI for code status.  Today, she
will be transferred to the [**Hospital3 **] Palliative
Care Unit.
