LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA and RA cavity sizes.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Suboptimal technical
quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). TDI
E/e' < 8, suggesting normal PCWP (<12mmHg). No resting LVOT
gradient.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal diameter of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
levels. Focal calcifications in aortic root. No 2D or Doppler
evidence of distal arch coarctation.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR. No
MVP.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Borderline PA systolic hypertension.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.
PERICARDIUM: There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial
effusion cannot be excluded.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor apical views.

Conclusions
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which
most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
global and regional biventricular systolic function. Aortic
valve sclerosis.



Brief Hospital Course:
She was transferred from an outside hospital for surgical
evaluation.  She underwent plavix washout and preoperative
workup.  On [**7-29**] she was brought to the operating room for
coronary artery bypass graft surgery, see operative report for
further details.  She received vancomycin and cefazolin for
perioperative antibiotics.  Post operatively she was transferred
to the intensive care unit for management.  That evening she was
weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact, and was
extubated without complications.  She remained in the intensive
care unit requiring neosynephrine for hypotension and anemia
that she was transfused with packed red blood cells.  She was
started on lasix for gentle diuresis and on post operative day
two she was weaned off neosynephrine.  Physical therapy worked
with her on strength and mobility.  She continued to improve and
on post operative day three she was started on betablockers and
transferred to the floor.  Chest tubes and epicardial wires were
removed per protocol.  She was ready for discharge home on post
operative day five with services.  Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] her plavix
was not resumed post-operatively.
