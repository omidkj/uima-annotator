MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST  [**2152-5-3**] 11:14 AM

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST; MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST

Reason: eval for diffuse axonal injury, p which pt will need
bolt

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
23 year old man with multi small hyperdense foci, mult fract
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for diffuse axonal injury, p which pt will need bolt
INDICATION: Multiple small hyperdense foci and multiple
fractures. Evaluate for diffuse axonal injury.

COMPARISON: Noncontrast head CT of [**2152-5-3**].

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images of the brain
were obtained, with diffusion-weighted images.

MRI OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT CONTRAST: Multiple small foci of
susceptibility are seen within the brain, corresponding to small
hemorrhages seen on CT scan earlier today. These multiple foci
of susceptibility are noted within both anterior frontal lobes
and the right occipital lobe, as well as within the anterior
right temporal lobe. There is surrounding elevated T2 and FLAIR
signal at these locations, corresponding to small areas of edema
around the hemorrhages. The location of these hemorrhagic foci
correspond to the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]- white matter junction, indicating that
these hemorrhages represent diffuse axonal injury, as commented
on the recent CT scan.

In addition, there are slivers of elevated T2 and FLAIR signal
at the anterior and posterior extra-axial cerebral space on the
left, consistent with tiny subdural hematoma at these locales.

The diffusion-weighted images are degraded by gross motion and
cannot be reliably interpreted.

Multiple osseous injuries are better appreciated on the CT exam
of the same date.

MRA OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **]

TECHNIQUE: 3D time of flight images of the intracranial
vertebral, internal carotid arteries, as well as major
tributaries of the Circle of [**Location (un) 431**] were obtained. 3D
reformatted images were provided.

MRA OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **]: The intracranial vertebral arteries
and intracranial internal carotid arteries, as well as major
branches of the Circle of [**Location (un) 431**] are patent. There are no areas
of flow-limiting stenosis or aneurysmal dilation appreciated.

IMPRESSIONS:
1. Evidence of diffuse axonal injury, as described in the CT
study of the same date.
2. Tiny subdural hematomas within the left anterior and
posterior extra-axial space.
3. Patent Circle of [**Location (un) 431**] vasculature.

The findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of the
neurosurgical service at the time of interpretation.

CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS  [**2152-5-3**] 8:07 AM

CTA NECK W&W/OC & RECONS; CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS

Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
23 year old man s/p high speed MVA w/mult facial fx, head
contusions, unreactive pupils
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
- to be done at 8am per neuro [**Doctor First Name **]- head and neck to eval for
vert. art dissection/aortic dissect
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Status post high speed motor vehicle accident with
multiple facial fractures, has contusions and unreactive pupils.
Evaluate for vertebral artery dissection.

COMPARISON: CT of the head and cervical spine of [**2152-5-3**].

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images through the neck were
obtained following the administration of IV Optiray contrast.
Multiplanar and 3-D reformatted images were obtained.

CTA OF THE NECK: The vertebral arteries and carotid arteries
opacify normally with contrast from the level of the aortic arch
through the skull base and the circle of [**Location (un) 431**]. There is no
evidence of arterial dissection or areas of aneurysmal dilation.

Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes remain in place. A
right-sided chest tube is noted, as are parenchymal opacities
within the lungs posteriorly at the apices.

For additional details regarding multiple facial, skull and rib
fractures, as well as areas of hemorrhage within the brain,
please refer to the dedicated reports of the same day.

CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIAL W/O CONTRAST  [**2152-5-3**] 3:38 AM

CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIA

Reason: with reconstruction

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
23 year old man with sp unrestr driver GCS 4
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
with reconstruction
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Unrestrained driver, GCS score of 4.

COMPARISON: None.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired images of the facial bones were
obtained with coronal reformatted images.

FINDINGS: There are bilateral orbital roof fractures with
intraorbital air present. There are several small fragments that
project into the CSF space overlying the left orbital roof.
There is a segmental fracture of the right lateral orbital wall
with 5 mm of internal depression of the superior fragment, and
suggestion of impalement of the right lateral rectus muscle.
There is a right inferior orbital wall fracture with inferior
segmental displacement of the inferior orbital wall. Though
there is an extensively comminuted fracture of the sphenoid
[**Doctor First Name 362**], at the orbital apex, the optic strut appears intact and
the optic canal is not compromised. There is a right medial
orbital wall fracture with no entrapment of the medial rectus
muscle. There are fractures of the anterior wall of the right
maxillary sinus with posterior extension through the hard
palate. There are multiple fractures of the posterior and
lateral walls of the right maxillary sinus, as well. There also
appears to be a nondisplaced fracture of the lateral wall of the
left maxillary sinus. There are multiple displaced nasal
fractures. A coronally- oriented fracture component, which may
represent further extension of the right palatal fracture,
involves the base of the left pterygoid process, extending into
those pterygoid plates; there is no evidence of mid-facial
separation, however. Note is also made of a right mandibular
fracture. Numerous foci of air are present in the soft tissues
of the face, likely secondary to the numerous fractures that are
present. There is pneumocephalus underlying a right skull
fracture located anterior to the mastoid air cells. The images
also incompletely demonstrate a transverse fracture of the left
temporal bone, extending through the glenoid fossa extending
toward the carotid canal in the
