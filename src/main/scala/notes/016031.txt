History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known firstname 429**] [**Known lastname 87197**] is a 79 yoM with history of COPD on home O2,
CAD, CHF, and chronic indwelling foley for undertain reasons. He
was hospitalized for CHF exacerbation from [**8-4**] - 21/10. He
feeling unwell for several days with weakness and sleepiness,
per the family. This morning he got up to go to the bathroom for
a BM with the assistance of his wife and became unresponsive.
EMS was called and patient was intubated in the field for
respiratory distress; when they arrived he was having agonal
breaths with weak peripheral pulses. His skin was cool and dry
per EMS report. He arrived to the OSH ([**Location (un) **]) and underwent CT
head/neck which was initially read as negative, though they
later called with reports of an acute right subinsular infarct.
He was transferred for further management.
.
In the ED, he received 4L IVF, was started on vanco/levo/flagyl,
and received magnesium 2 g and K 40 mEq. CT head was negative,
and CT torso showed atalectasis and emphysema but no PNA or
acute abdonimal processes. He was discharged with a foley.
.
Of note, he was recently hospitalized from [**8-4**] - 21 for CHF
exacerbation; his weight went from 215 lb to 187 lb. His
daughter said his weight is now around 178 lb. He was also
treated for a COPD atthis admission.
.
This week, his cardizem was started a few days ago, about the
time they feel his symptoms started. It was never started upon
discharge as was ordered due to insurance issues, per the
family. Also, he went this week for a urology appointment and
they left the foley in that was placed on discharge due to his
fatigue and inability to tolerate a voiding trial.
.
Family denies fever, cough, sputum production, abdominal pain,
constipation, diarrhea

URINE CULTURE (Final [**2141-8-30**]):
      Culture workup discontinued. Further incubation showed
contamination
      with mixed fecal flora. Clinical significance of
isolate(s)
      uncertain. Interpret with caution.
      CITROBACTER FREUNDII COMPLEX.    >100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..
         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.

Imaging:
[**8-27**] CT Torso:
1. Severe emphysema bilaterally as well as minimal bilateral
opacity, either atelectatic or infectious. Superimposed more
nodular areas which may represent underlying pulmonary nodules.
Would recommend correlation to prior imaging if available and
failing that, repeat evaluation with a dedicated CT of the chest
in six months.
2. Atherosclerotic disease including coronary arterial
calcification.
3. Diverticulosis with focal sigmoid wall thickening, possibly
early
diverticulitis. Would recommend colonscopy to evaluate this
segment upon resolution of symptoms.
4. Right renal cyst.

[**8-28**] CT Head w/o con: Small left anterior subinsular white matter
hypodensity, consistent with a microvascular infarct which is
most likely chronic. If there is a clinical concern for an acute
infarction, then MR is recommended for f
