Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
syncope, altered mental status, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This is a 61yo male with ESRD on peritoneal dialysis, atrial
fibrillation on coumadin, CAD (s/p CABG in '[**33**] and PTCA in '[**41**])
and DMII, who was brought by ambulance from rehab for an episode
of unresponsiveness.  The patient was apparently found at
[**Hospital3 **] unresponsive in chair during lunch.  At the
time, the SBP was 60s (baseline 80/50s), HR 70s, Glucose 135,
ABG: 7.4/44/195.  SBP increased to the 90s when placed supine
and after receiving 500cc bolus NS.  The patient awoke and was
without complaints; he denied chest pain, palpitations,
shortness of breath, and did not recall what happened.  Pt was
subsequently brought to [**Hospital1 18**] for ?syncope and ?sepsis, although
the latter was thought to be unlikely as he had been receiving
broad spectrum antibiotics(vancomycin and meropenem) for heel
ulcers that grew MRSA and klebsiella.  In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, the
patient was found to be tremulous with BP 80/50 and given 4L NS
without change in BP.  At this point, the patient was started on
dopamine at which point he went into rapid afib.  Dopamine was
subsequently discontinued and the patient was started on
levophed with an increase in BP to 111/52.  The patient also had
a positive UA with purulent urine (pyuria); he was thus started
on fluconazole.  CXR and head CT were negative for acute
changes.  The patient remained afebrile without changes in WBC.
At this point, the patient was sent to the Intensive Care Unit
for further evaluation of the patient's hypotension.

XRAY of HEELS
The anterior aspect of the calcaneus is not included on the
lateral view. Increased density along the extreme posterior
periphery of the calcaneus is unchanged compared with [**2144-6-17**]
and is thought to represent normal variation in the calcaneus.
There is a small erosion in the posterior calcaneus, near the
site of Achilles tendon insertion, likely relates to the
retrocalcaneal bursa. Otherwise, no bone destruction, abnormal
sclerosis, or periosteal new bone formation is detected. There
is diffuse [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] calcification. No radiopaque foreign body is
detected.
No radiographic findings to confirm the presence of
osteomyelitis.
BLOOD CULTURES: NO GROWTH.
URINE CULTURE: YEAST
SWAB CULTURE: XANTHOMONAS (Bactrim sensitive), MRSA


Brief Hospital Course:
1) SYNCOPE: The patient received a thorough workup for syncope,
including evaluation for cardiogenic, neurogenic, and infectious
etiologies.  With respect to the cardiac workup, the patient was
placed on telemetry to evaluate for possible dysrhythimias, the
result of which was negative.  Troponin was found to be slightly
elevated compared to baseline, but this was attributed to ESRD.
ECHO was performed which revealed normal left ventricular cavity
size with moderate global hypokinesis consistent with a diffuse
process.  There was mild mitral regurgitation and EF was found
to be 30-35%.  EKG was consistent with a possible old inferior
infarct and nonspecific ST-T wave changes.  With respect to a
neurogenic etiology, the patient's presentation was found to be
consistent with cerebral hypoperfusion in the context of
multiple [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] metabolic derangements such as hypotension.
Head CT revealed no acute intracranial process and the patient
was already anticoagulated on coumadin with an INR of 1.9 for
his chronic atrial fibrillation.  With respect to infectious
etiologies, the patient was found to have multiple sources, such
as the peritoneal dialysis catheter, PICC line, purulent U/A,
and multiple ulcers, that could be contributing to a septic
hypotension and consequent syncope.  The PICC line was removed
but found to have no growth on culture.  The patient was
continued on vancomycin for MRSA cultured from the wound and
meropenem for klebsiella cultured from the wound as well (but
not documented at this hospital).  Bactrim was started to cover
for stenotrophomas (from wound culture in past).  Ultimately,
the patient was found to have a negative workup with respect to
all three interdisciplinary evaluations.  Further assessment of
the patient's previous hospital records revealed the patient's
baseline blood pressure is 80/40.  As such, it is possible the
patient's syncopal episode was secondary to hypovolemia in the
context of an already brittle blood pressure.  Without evidence
of infection, that is without a white count/fever/positive blood
culture, all antibiotics were discontinued except fluconazole
which was used to treat the patient's UTI with yeast found in
culture.  Blood pressure r
