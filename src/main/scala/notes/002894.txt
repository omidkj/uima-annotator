Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 678**]
Chief Complaint:
Pt unable to give [**12-25**] to history of MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] was sent here for
eval after group home felt that his behavior was off.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal Intubation
PICC line placement


History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 106770**] is a 49-year-old gentleman with severe mental
retardation (non-verbal at baseline, deaf/blind since birth),
epilepsy, bilateral anopthalmia, initially admitted for subdural
hematoma (stable, no intervention performed) who was transferred
from the floor with sudden onset of respiratory distress,
desaturation to mid 80s on 6L NC. He had recently been noted to
have a LUE DVT on [**2162-11-27**] associated with a PICC line which was
subsequently pulled. No anticoaggulation given for this given
the recent subdural hematoma for which he was admitted and the
relatively low risk of PE with upper ext DVTs. The team was
concerned for possible PE vs a new aspiration pneumonitis or
pneumonia. Of note, he completed a 10 day course of levo/flagyl
for aspiration pna on [**2162-11-29**] and had a G tube placed for TFs on
[**2162-11-25**] given his chronic aspiration. Blood cultures positive for
coag neg staph on [**2162-11-18**] and [**2162-11-23**] were felt likely to be
contaminants given the fact that they were different species.
.
He had initially presented to the Emergency Department on
[**2162-11-18**] s/p unwitnessed fall at Group Home. He was found to
have acute right-sided subdural hematoma with minimal mass
effect, and unchanged ventriculomegaly. He was given 1g Dilantin
load and admitted to the Neurosurgical ICU. Repeat Head CT
5-hours later showed no change, and no intervention was planned.
Patient was transferred to the MICU initially for hypernatremia
up to 174 and ARF which resolved with IVFs and free H20. His WBC
started to rise and he was started on Vancomycin for L knee
cellulitis. Arthrocentesis of the knee was neg for septic joint.
He had a PICC line placed and was transferred to the floor.

Pertinent Results:
** PICC LINE PLACMENT SCH  [**2162-12-14**]: Uncomplicated ultrasound
and fluoroscopically guided single lumen PICC line placement via
the right basilic venous approach. Final internal length is 37
cm, with the tip positioned in SVC. The line is ready to use
.
** CXR [**2162-12-3**]: Bibasilar improvement of atelectasis
.
** US EXTREMITY NONVASCULAR LEFT  [**2162-11-29**]: Status post removal
of venous catheter with persistent echogenic thrombus which is
not propagated on limited examination
.
** UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US  [**2162-11-26**]: Acute thrombus in the left
subclavian, axillary and brachial veins surrounding the
patient's PICC line.
.
** CT torso [**2162-11-25**]: 1. Gastrostomy tube within the body of the
stomach, which is not in an intrathoracic position. 2. Bilateral
lower lobe airspace opacity most suggestive of aspiration
although pneumonia cannot be excluded. 3. Porcelain gallbladder.
This is a risk factor for gallbladder carcinoma. 4. Shriveled,
malpositioned, calcified, and scarred right kidney consistent
with chronic process.
5. Stool-filled distended rectum without evidence of proximal
bowel dilation.
.
** Head CT [**11-19**]: Acute or subacute right-sided subdural
hemorrhage, measuring 1.1 cm in greatest diameter, with minimal
mass effect and no evidence of midline shift. Unchanged
ventriculomegaly. Again normal pressure hydrocephalus is a
consideration in the proper clinical setting.
.
** CT C-Spine: No definite evidence of fracture or malalignment.
Ossific fragments associated with the C5 spinous processes are
likely chronic/degenerative, however, correlation with detailed
physical examination is recommended.
.
** R SHOULDER AND L ELBOW XR: Extremely limited views of the
right shoulder and left elbow. No gross evidence of fracture or
dislocation.
.
** L Knee XR: No evidence of acute fracture or dislocation. No
joint effusion.
.
** Pelvis AP: IMPRESSION: No evidence of fracture.
.
** Repeat Head CT: Moderate-sized acute/subacute right subdural
hemorrhage, unchanged compared to five hours prior.

Brief Hospital Course:
49M h/o severe mental retardation, epilepsy, anophthalmia, and
nephrogenic DI presenting following a fall found to have a right
sided subdural hematoma, profound hypernatremia, and knee
cellulitis.
.
SUBDURAL HEMATOMA: The patient had an unwitnessed fall at his
group home.  He was found to have an acute right subdural
hematoma without evidence of midline shift.  He was loaded with
dilantin.  He was evaluted by the neurosurgical service who
recommended serial head CT which showed no change in the
hematoma.  Surgical intervention was deferred unless acute
worsening with herniation was found.  The patient will follow-up
with the neurosurgeons with a repeat head CT in 2 weeks of
discharge.
.
HYPERNATREMIA:  This was felt most likely relate to significant
dehydration worsened by his history of nephrogenic DI.  He was
able to concentrate his urine to Uosm>600.  His serum sodium was
corrected with initially isotonic fluids then with free water
via his NG tube.  The follow-up head CT did not show significant
cerebral edema after sodium correction.  He will need to
continue to have appropriate amounts of free water per PEG to
keep an appropriate Sodium.
.
Knee cellulitis: This was felt to be likely related to a prior
fall that was secondarily infected.  Orthopedics was consulted
for evaluation of a potentially septic joint however a joint
aspirate showed minimal fluid w/o evidence of infection.  He was
treated with vancomycin for 14 days.  This problem was fully
resolved at time of discharge.
.
ACUTE on Chronic RENAL FAILURE (stage 3, GFR 40):  This was felt
to be pre-renal in nature.  He was volume expanded as above and
his urine output improved appropriately.  His Cr had returned to
baseline at time of discharge.
.
Hypoxia:  The patient had two events of significant hypoxia
during his hospital stay.  Upon arrival to MICU on [**2162-11-30**], the
patient was aggitated and a good O2 sat could not be obtained
b/c a good pleth was not seen. He was given haldol 3mg IV,
became less aggitated, and his O2 sat came up to 98% on NRB. CXR
revealed low lung volumes and evidence of large amount of stool
in intes
