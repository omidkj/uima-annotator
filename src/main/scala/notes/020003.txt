History of Present Illness:
In brief, this is a 43 yo male w/ hx of asthma, AIDS (recent CD4
count of 10), p/w fever, dyspnea, and dysphagia. The patient was
seen by his PCP 1wk PTA for dysphagia and treated with Nystatin
however over the past 4 days his pain and discomfort while
swallowing has worsened. Similarly, within this period he
developed a fever, n/v, and loose stools which prompted his
visit to the ED. The patient is unaware of any precipitating
factor however he feels that it might have been due to a recent
asthma flare. He described the feeling as though "he stopped
breathing 3 times". He denies syncope, lightheadedness, loss of
consciousness, tinnitus, photophobia, neck stiffness and reports
that his vomit was non-bloody/non-bilious. His chronic cough
which he attributes to his smoking also worsened and became
productive as yellow-white non-bloody sputum. he experienced
some minor chesst tightness but it resolved quickyl and denies
any current symptoms. Due to his dificulty swallowing he was
unable to take his HAART medications over the last 3d PTA. Of
note, he recently was treated for shingles outbreak of his right
buttocks.
.
In the ambulance his oxygen sats were 86% RA. In the ED his T
was 101.4 HR 140 BP 150/94 RR 40 92% RA. He was treated
empirically for pneumonia and PCP with Levofloxacin, prednisone,
and bactrim. He was then sent to the MICU and his vitals there
were T 101.4 HR 137 BP 124/66 RR 97% 5L NC. He was restarted on
HAARD and his symptoms resolved steadily back to what he refers
to as "normal for me". He was then transferred to the Medicine
floor in a comfortable and stable status while denying any chest
pain, dizziness, or dyspnea. In fact, he was concerned mostly
for going home as soon as possible due to his recently deceased
cat at home and making arrangements for that.
