Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo with h/o COPD, CHF (EF 50%) presents with hypotension,
hyperkalemia, and sepsis from unknown source, likely pulmonary /
pneumonia.
.
1. Hypotension/Sepsis:
On presentation, pt was found down.  Pt was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
and treated with initial pressors, and intubated for pulmonary
support.  Pt was placed on IV Vanco/Zosyn for presumptive
empiric coverage and was pancultured.  Sputum cultures later
returned back MRSA and patient was treated as presumptive MRSA
pneumonia complicated by sepsis.  Pt responded well to
aggressive fluid hydration and was able to be extubated, with
pressors weaned 1 day after initiation.  Her Zosyn was
discontinued and pt was transferred to the floor and continued
on IV Vanco to complete a 14 day course.  Pt continued to
improve clinically, remained afebrile,  and blood cultures
remained negative on day of discharge.  Pt was eventually
discharged to a rehab hospital once stable for continued rehab
after discharge.
.
2. COPD Exacerbation
Pt with symptoms consistant with a COPD exacerbation and had
previously still been on an prednisone taper from her previous
discharge.  Pt was placed on IV solumedrol while in the ICU but
gradually transitioned to Prednisone 40mg daily when she was
transferred to the floor.  Nebulizers, and inhaled steroids were
continued throughout her admission.  Pt's symptoms improved and
patient was discharged on Pred 20mg daily to complete a slow 2
week taper off of steroids.
.
3. Acute renal failure:
Has baseline CRI but creatinine acutely elevated on elevated
which was largely attributed to prerenal azotemia from
hypotension and volume depletion.  Pt was  aggressively hydrated
while in the ICU and her Creatinine rapidly returned to [**Location 213**].
A renal u/s was obtained that was negative for any postrenal
obstruction.
.
4. CHF -
Pt with a h/o CHF with a baseline EF of 50%, with some chronic
vascular markings c/w chronic changes attributable to CHF.
Despite aggressive hydration, clinically pt did not exhibit any
signs of CHF.  Pt was continued on her home dose of ASA and ACE.
 Pt is not on a bblocker due to her COPD. Pt to continue to f/u
as an outpt.
.
5. Proph: Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], MRSA precautions not indicated unless
patient has cough.
.
6. Dispo/Code:  Full Code.  Pt was to be discharged to rehab to
complete a 14 day course of IV Vanco for her MRSA pneumonia.  Pt
is to f/u with her outpt PCP once able.
