denied coughing, chest pain, abdominal pain, arm or leg pain and
urinary symptoms on initial presentation. The patient was

Echocardgiogram: [**2198-7-11**]
The left atrial volume is markedly increased (>32ml/m2). The
right atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. There is mild to moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe
hypokinesis/akinesis of the septum and hypokinesis of the
anterior wall. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion. Ejection Fraction 35-40%
IMPRESSION: Moderate focal LV systolic dysfunction. Diastolic
dysfunction. Mild aortic regurgitation.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2198-7-13**]

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**7-11**], there is no
interval change. Small bilateral pleural effusions are again
seen in this patient with a tracheal stent in place. Enlargement
of the cardiac silhouette with vascular prominence and pacemaker
device.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 47716**] was transferred to the SICU from [**Hospital3 934**]
Hospital intubated [**2198-7-6**] for progressive SOB.  On HOD #1 she
was seen by dermatology for puritis who recommended to keep skin
moist with emollients, such as Eucerin.  On HOD #2 she had
Flexible bronchoscopy was performed through the endotracheal
tube. On HOD #3  she went to the operating room and underwent
successful Rigid bronchoscopy, flexible bronchoscopy, and
metallic covered Ultraflex stent placement 40 mm x 20 mm. She
was transferred back to the SICU and extubated without
difficulty.  [**Last Name (un) **] was seen by Speech and swallow for mild
difficulty with mastication [**3-17**] edentulous state, but otherwise
did not have any overt signs of aspiration. They recommended a
PO diet of thin liquids and ground consistency solids and pills
whole with apple sauce. She tolerated this without difficulty.
Later that evening she transferred to the floor but developed
respiratory distress and was transferred back to the SICU.  She
responded to diuretics, nebulizers and aggressive pulmonary
toileting.  She was found to be in atrial fibrillation and her
beta-blockers were increased.  An echocardiogram was performed
(see report).  The right pleural effusion was drained for 600cc.
 Her hypoxemia improved and she was transferred back to the
floor. She was seen by physical therapy who recommended rehab.
Her oxygen saturation were 96% on RA at rest, and 92-96% on 1
Liter via nasal cannula.  She was discharged to rehab on POD #6.
 She will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 4 weeks.
