HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 23-year-old
male with a past medical history of Crohn's, status post
small bowel resection x 3, last in [**2113**], who was recently
admitted to [**Hospital3 1280**], an outside hospital, on [**9-26**],
where he presented with 12 hours of severe abdominal pain.
He was noted to have severe abdominal pain the night prior to
admission to the outside hospital, followed by nausea and
vomiting.  He is now transferred to the [**Hospital1 190**] after he developed septic parameters at the
outside hospital.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for Crohn's disease.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Small bowel resections x 3.

MEDICATIONS:  Mercaptopurine 100 mg by mouth twice a day,
folate and vitamin B12.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, the patient is a white
male who appeared somnolent and was lying still.  Vitals were
a temperature of 99.6, heart rate 130, blood pressure 146/74,
oxygen saturation 96% on room air.  On examination, there was
a nasogastric tube in place.  Pulmonary examination revealed
tachypnea though the lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Cardiac examination revealed tachycardia with a
regular rhythm.  The abdomen was distended, tense.  There was
guarding and rebound tenderness present.  There were no bowel
sounds.  The extremities were warm and well perfused.

LABORATORY DATA:  From [**Hospital6 3872**], white count
17.2, with a differential of 77 neutrophils, 3 bands.
Hemoglobin was 13.2, platelets were 240.  Sodium was 139,
potassium 4.4, chloride 98, bicarbonate 30, BUN 12,
creatinine 0.8, glucose 119.  Lactate was 43.9.  Total
bilirubin was 2.8.  AST was 36, ALT 113, alkaline phosphatase
82, direct bilirubin 0.5, amylase 68.  CT scan:  At the
outside hospital, revealed on scanning of the abdomen and
pelvis, there was some free fluid present in the abdomen, and
the CT was read as consistent with small bowel obstruction.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the General
Surgery service.  Aggressive fluid resuscitation was started,
and the patient was prepared and taken to the operating room,
at which point he was found to have a mid-gut volvulus with
severe ischemic compromise, and he underwent an exploratory
laparotomy and derotation of a mid-gut volvulus.  Please see
the operative note for details.

Following the procedure, the patient was transferred to the
Post-Anesthesia Care Unit in stable but guarded condition,
and was subsequently transferred to the Surgical Intensive
Care Unit.  The patient was stable following the initial
procedure, during which a second look operation was planned.
The patient was maintained intubated and sedated on
postoperative day one, and lactate was found to be 2.2.
White count was 6.2, with 14 bands.

When the patient was taken back to the operating room for the
second look laparotomy, he underwent segmental small bowel
resection with re-anastomosis.  Please see the operative note
for details.  The patient was transferred back to the
Surgical Intensive Care Unit following the procedure.  The
patient remained intubated following the procedure, and was
subsequently intubated on postoperative day two from the
original procedure.  At the time of the second operation, in
addition to intravenous fluids, the patient also received two
units of packed red blood cells, two units of fresh frozen
plasma, and a five-pack of platelets.

On postoperative day three from the original procedure, the
patient was doing well, and was transferred to the floor.
The patient was also started on total parenteral nutrition.
The patient was still noted to be febrile on postoperative
day four.  Please note that postoperative antibiotics
consisted of Zosyn.

By postoperative day six, the patient was on no antibiotics,
however, he was still found to be febrile, with evidence of a
right pleural effusion on chest x-ray, with no pneumonia.  A
central line tip was sent for culture.

On postoperative day seven, a KUB was obtained to evaluate
the position of the patient's nasogastric tube.  It was
withdrawn slightly, with good effect.  On postoperative day
eight, the patient was noted to have had a small bowel
movement overnight, with no nausea or vomiting.  Total
parenteral nutrition was continued.  A PICC line was to be
placed for long-term total parenteral nutrition, however, the
patient was still febrile.  Oxacillin was started.  A CT scan
was obtained on [**10-5**], which showed no abscess, no free
air, and no extraluminal contrast was detected, and prominent
small bowel loops were seen.

On postoperative day nine from the original procedure, the
nasogastric tube was removed.  The patient continued to
improve, was passing stool, and total parenteral nutrition
was continued.  A PICC line was placed in the right basilic
vein for total parenteral nutrition.  The patient's diet was
advanced to sips of clear liquids.

On postoperative day 11, the patient was found to be febrile,
and was advanced to full clears.  On postoperative day 12,
the patient was afebrile, and tolerated a soft diet.
Arrangements were made for the patient to continue total
parenteral nutrition at his home in [**State 760**], and the
patient was advised to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 44371**] at the
[**State 43840**] regarding adjustment of total
parenteral nutrition as well as postoperative follow up.

resection and anastomosis

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Dilaudid 2 to 4 mg by mouth every four to six hours as
