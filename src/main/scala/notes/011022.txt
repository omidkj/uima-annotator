Brief Hospital Course:
Resp failure most likely secondary to sepsis in setting of PNA
on CXR- unlikely to be related to fluids since patient is

elevated WBC, febrile in the ED and found to have a RLL PNA on
CXR.  Also has underlying COPD. extubated [**2177-1-5**], doing well.

comorbidities so it is possible that only a small insult was
necessary to exacerbate his FTT.  SV02 was 78
