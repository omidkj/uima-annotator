Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
86 y/o Russian speaking male with extensive PMH including
metastatic nonsmall cell lung CA s/p lobectomy and XRT, DM,
orthostasis, mild diastolic CHF and chronic renal insufficiency
presenting with SOB. Pt has had difficulty breathing for the
past several years, especially increasing about 1.5 years ago
after segmental resection of a right lung mass. At that time he
also developed increasing pain in his back around the site of
his surgery, which increases on inspiration, is present at rest
and does not increase with exertion. He was last discharged from
[**Hospital1 18**] for COPD exacerbation [**2102-9-30**].  In general, the patient
has not been eating or drinking as much as he used to and has
lost weight.  Currently, he describes gradual increase in
viscosity of sputum and decreased total volume over the last
month.  He feels it difficult to breathe with these secretions.
He continues to have lateral chest pain on deep inspiration.  He
denies palpitations, nausea, vomiting, hemoptysis, night sweats,
assymetric leg or arm swelling.

In the ED, the patient was treated BiPAP, CXR obtained
(interstial infiltrates) and antibiotics given (after sputum was
collected).

Past Medical History:
1. Metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer - s/p RUL lobectomy
[**2100**], radiation tx to pleural based nodule [**12/2101**]
2. CAD
3. PVD, s/p left femoral stent in [**2091**]
4. Type II DM
5. Chronic Renal Insufficiency
6. COPD
7. Depression

Social History:
The patient was born in [**Country 532**] and moved to the United States in
[**2091**]. He speaks no English.  He currently lives in [**Location 86**] with
his wife. His granddaughter is his health care proxy. [**Name (NI) **] has a
60-90 pack per year history of tobacco use. He quit smoking 1.5
years ago. He denied alcohol use.

Family History:
noncontributory

Physical Exam:
98.4     138/65    87      18 (slightly labored)   95% 3L NC

Brief Hospital Course:
1.  Dyspnea:  Pt was noted to be producing thick secretions and
having difficulty expectorating them.  CXR revealed diffuse
interstitial infiltrates and CT revealed an interval increase in
the # and size of the pt's innumerable pulmonary nodules,
indicating progression of intrapulmonary metastatic disease.  Pt
was initially treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin
empirically to cover for CAP, later switched to just
azithromycin for bacterial tracheobronchitis--he will complete a
7 day course.  Mr.[**Known lastname 7640**] was also started on mucolytics and
nebulizers for symptom relief.  Chest physiotherapy also helped
to mobilize the patient's secretions.  His butamide was
increased from 2 to 3mg po qD to aid in decreasing any
concurrent pulmonary edema and drying out his secretions.
Pulmonary was consulted and felt no cure was feasable for the
patient, and he should be treated palliatively.  Scopolamine
patch started to decrease secretions.

2.  Code Status:  Palliative care consult was obtained and
Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] met with the patient and grandaughter (health care
proxy).  Goals of care were discussed and it was decided that
shifting from the goal of cure to the goal of maximizing comfort
was most appropriate.  He was made DNR/DNI.  He needs chest
physiotherapy and aggressive pulmonary toilet.  Plans were made
for home services with bridge to hospice care, but the patient
subsequently deteriorated (see below).

3.  Pneumonia: On [**11-2**], we were informed by Micro lab that
patient's sputum was growing Nocardia. This raised the
possibility that some of his radiographic findings were
attributable to this infection as opposed to advancing
metastatic disease. The Infectious Disease service was consulted
& the patient was started on the appropriate abx immediately.

4. respiratory failure: Pt deteriorated on [**11-3**], and after
discussion with his family, he was transferred to the MICU where
he was stabilized with NIPPV. Etiology was likely
multifactorial, including advanced lung ca, COPD, Nocardiosis.
After a couple of days, he returned to the medicine floor, where
he again had severe respiratory compromise, along with
increasing lethargy. The family requested transfer back to MICU
for another trial of NIPPV, and shortly after his arrival there,
the family agreed to change the goals of care to comfort
measures only. He was started on a morphine drip and expired
comfortably on [**11-7**].
