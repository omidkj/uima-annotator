Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted and prepared for surgery.  On [**11-11**] he
went to the operating room where an attempt at mitral repair was
unsuccessful.  Therefore, mitral valve replacment was performed.
 See operative note for details.  He weaned from bypass on
phenylephrine and propofol.  He remained stable, pressor was
weaned off and he was extubated uneventfully. vancomycin was
continued pending final tissue culture from the valve.

He was transferred to the floor where beta blockade was resumed
and diuresis continued.  Cts were removed and temporary pacing
wires also in a timely manner.  Diuretics were continued at
discharge as he was still significantly fluid overloaded.
operative tissue culture were sterile at final report and
vancomycin was discontinued.

At discharge he was ambulatory, wounds were healing well and he
felt well.  medications and discharge instructions were
discussed with him prior to going home.
