Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1881**]
Chief Complaint:
cough, hypotension


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
84 y/o M with hx of ESRD on HD, Wegner's granulomatosis on
chronic steroids, afib/flutter, hx of prostate cancer and
baseline low BPs who presented to an outpatient office visit
today due to 3 days of productive cough with yellow sputum.  No
hemoptysis.  He was also feeling very weak and had a hard time
getting out a bed this morning.  His wife took his temperature
and it was 100 (which is high for him).  His sputum has been
yellow and increasing in thickness the last few days.  He denies
any other symptoms like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal
pain, headaches, fainting, dizziness.  He does have a hx of
falls and unsteadiness, especially when he first stands up.  He
fell about 2-3 weeks ago and hit his head.  Had a head CT in the
ED that was negative at that time.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 98.6, P 67, BP 67/40, R 20 and
93% on RA.  He received stress dose steroids with
methylprednisone 125 mg once, ceftriaxone 1 gm IV once and
azithromycin 500 mg IV once.  He required 4L NC.  He had a CXR
that showed a new R effusion and questionable increased opacity
in the RLL, although difficult to tell based on his chronic lung
disease.
.
On arrival to the floor, he is feeling well.  He still is
coughing, but is feeling better from when he first came to the
ED.

Chest XRAY [**2122-8-4**]
HISTORY: Desaturation, worsening effusion.

IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to chest radiographs since [**2117**],
most recently [**6-11**] and [**2122-8-4**]: Since [**2121**], previous
small right pleural effusion has decreased and what was probably
aspiration or asymmetric edema in the right lower lobe has
cleared. Moderate cardiomegaly, severe left upper lobe pleural
parenchymal scarring with bronchiectasis and emphysema are
longstanding. Dual-channel [**Year (4 digits) 2286**] catheter ends in the SVC and
upper right atrium respectively. No pneumothorax.

CT- L Shoulder [**2122-8-6**];

IMPRESSION: Non-displaced fracture of the posteroinferior
glenoid.

 _____________________

CT- Chest [**2122-8-6**];

IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral non-hemorrhagic pleural effusions; improvement of
right effusion leading to resolution of right lower lobe
collapse; relatively unchanged left effusion.
2. Interval resolution or decrease of previously described
pulmonary nodules, likely representing a resolving infectious
process; no new nodules seen.
3. Stable-appearing bronchiectasis.
4. L1 compression fracture, new from prior study but of
indeterminate age.
5. Left renal cyst.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Cough/Hypoxia: The patients cough - hypoxic episode was likely
from an infection, either bacterial vs. viral infection (he does
have hx of H1N1 earlier this year).   His CXR on admission was
unrevealing for large consolidation, but he does have a new
right sided pleural effusion.  In the setting of no generalized
fluid overload, the effusion may also be secondary to infection
or secondary to progressing Wegners with pulmonary involvement,
although none in the past. As the patient is also on chronic
steroids, PCP pna may also be on the differential.  In the MICU
the patient was started on broad antibiotic coverage for
community acquired pneumonia (Ceftrixone, azithromycin). Sputum
cultures, a urine legionella and blood culture were negative.
The patient's antibiotics were narrowed to Levoquin. Pt
respiratory status improved during the next week. He had no
requirement for O2. He did receive an albuterol nebulizer
treatment during an episode of choking on his secretions. This
episode self-resolved without complications.

nodal blocker (would want to avoid given orthost
