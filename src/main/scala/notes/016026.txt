Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**]
Chief Complaint:
CC: fever, abd pain, vomiting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
HPI: [**Age over 90 **] yo M recent UTI on cipro p/w 7 hours fever, abd pain and
vomiting, chronic nonprod cough. In the ED, the patient was
found to have a new RLL infiltrate concerning for PNA (not seen
on CXR [**5-2**] done at NEBH), received ceftriaxone/flagyl for
community-acquired. He was tachycardic and borderline
hypotensive, unclear if SBP dropped below 90 mmHg at any point,
lactate 2.9 on presentation down to 1.9 with IVF. A RIJ central
line was placed. He received aggressive fluid resuscitation with
5L NS. RLL process appeared worse on his second CXR (after fluid
resuscitation). EKG was without concerning features (no
comparison available). Though his MS was near baseline per
family on admission, after becoming hypotensive his MS
deteriorated and he was given Haldol.
.
Labs notable for: low nl WBC count with 16% bands; Hct drop from
42% by CBC to 35% by VBG after IVF; BUN 24/Cr 1.2, likely some
renal insufficiency given his age and weight; AP 434, [**Doctor First Name **] 104;
TnT 0.03, other enzymes pending; urine concentrated, acidic,
otherwise clear. APACHE II score around 14, with subsequent
mortality estimate around 18%.
.
After receiving 5L NS in the ED, he was found to have worsening
hypoxemia, currently only 90% on 100%NRB face mask. The ED staff
discussed with the family regarding intubation, and they
ultimately agreed. Advised the ED to consider MRSA and resistant
GNRs, and to think about changing his abx to include Vanc and
either Ceftaz, Cefipime, Zosyn. Pt to be intubated shortly. ED
staff to re-examine pt and check repeat (3rd) CXR to look for
new pulm edema in setting of aggressive volume repletion, and to
give Lasix if evidence of new CHF.

ROS: unable to obtain as pt noncommnunicative

REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]

MEASUREMENTS:
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 55% to 65% (nl >=55%)
Aorta - Valve Level: 3.5 cm (nl <= 3.6 cm)
Aorta - Arch: *4.9 cm (nl <= 3.0 cm)

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion
abnormality
cannot be fully excluded.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Resting
tachycardia (HR>100bpm).

Conclusions:
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber
size and free
wall motion are normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

    RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2164-5-11**] 9:05 PM

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST

Reason: assess for abscess
Field of view: 36

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
[**Age over 90 **] year old man with fever and bandemia.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
assess for abscess
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

CLINICAL HISTORY: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male with fever and bandemia.
Evaluate for abscess.

COMPARISON: None.

TECHNIQUE: Contrast-enhanced MDCT acquired axial images of the
abdomen and pelvis from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis.
Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN: The lung bases demonstrate patchy areas of
opacity, likely inflammatory. Basilar atelectasis and small
bilateral pleural effusions are identified.

No focal liver lesion is identified. The gallbladder is not
visualized. The spleen and adrenal glands are unremarkable. The
kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically. Multiple low
density lesions are seen within bilateral kidneys, the right is
more complex with septation. The pancreas demonstrates diffuse
calcification, which may represent chronic pancreatitis. A
hiatal hernia is present. Second portion of the duodenum is
somewhat dilated, the remainder of the small bowel is normal in
caliber, without evidence of obstruction. Large bowel is
unremarkable. The aorta is densely calcified. However, proximal
celiac, SMA, [**Female First Name (un) 899**] are opacified. There is small aneurysms of
bilateral renal arteries. No intra- abdominal free fluid, free
air is identified. No retroperitoneal or mesenteric
lymphadenopathy is appreciated.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The rectum is fecal
loaded. The sigmoid colon is unremarkable. A Foley catheter is
seen within a decompressed bladder. The prostate is
unremarkable. No free fluid or lymphadenopathy is appreciated.

BONE WINDOWS: There is diffuse demineralization of the bones.
Multilevel degenerative changes are seen throughout the
thoracolumbar spine. Compression fracture of T12 is identified,
of undetermined chronicity. Mutiple Tarloff cysts are present.
THere is pagetoid change within both femurs and iliac bones.

IMPRESSION:

1. Small bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent compressive
atelectasis.

2. Diffuse calcifications throughout the pancreas likely
representing chronic pancreatitis.

3. Multiple low-density lesions within bilateral kidneys,
incompletely characterized.

4. Diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications throughout the aorta
and branch vessels.

5. Multilevel degenerative changes throughout the thoracolumbar
spine with compression deformity of T12 of undetermined
chronicity. There is diffuse demineralization of the bones.

6. No evidence of obstruction or intra-abdominal abscess.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
