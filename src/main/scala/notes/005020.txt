History of Present Illness:
This is a 70 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for COPD
on 3L home oxygen therapy, OSA, unknown type of CHF, OSA, cor
pulmonale, who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management
of respiratory distress.

Patient was recently discharged from OSH 2 days prior for a COPD
exacerbation returned to OSH the following day with worsening
respiratory symptoms.  At OSH, ABG was 7.16, 80, 80.  Patient
was transferred here without any intervention or radiographic
tests.

Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vital signs were T: 97, HR:
89, BP: 147/71, RR: 18, O2sat: 88%2L NC.  Patient noted to have
poor air movement.  Initial ABG was 7.37, 70, 77.  Lactate of
0.7.  Patient given albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers times
three, SL NTG, and azithromycin 500mg PO X 1.  Chest radiograph
demonstrated mild vascular congestion and right lower lobe
opacity.  Patient was placed on BIPAP.  Two hours later, repeat
ABG was 7.27, 94, 60, and one hour later ABG: 7.24, 100, 103.
Code status was verified to be DNR/DNI with health care proxy
(wife), and as hypercarbia worsened patient became acutely
confused.  Due to question of steroid allergy (which later was
denied by health care proxy), the delivery of steroids was
delayed until immediately prior to transfer to the MICU.
.
In the MICU, pt was weaned off BIPAP by the next morning. Pt was
doing well, breathing and satting well on 3L NC (baseline
requirement). Pt was on standing nebs initially, now on Advair
and Spiriva with nebs PRN. Pt was continued on Solumederol, with
plan to transition him to PO Prednisone 60mg daily starting
tomorrow morning. Pt had elev WBC On admission with improved
initially with abx, then bumped up again (likely [**2-27**] steroids).
Blood cx are NTD. Abx initially were broad with
Vanc/Cefepime/Azithro, but then with pt's clinical improvemetn,
have been now narrowed to just Levoquin. Pt has been on Lasix
40mg IV daily with good response. Home Lasix dose is unclear and
needs to clarified. On transfer to the floor, VS were T 98.3 HR
77 BP 169/77 RR 94% (92-95%) on 3L NC and -1.6L net outpt in
last 24hrs.
.
On the floor, pt is comfortable, stated breathing is much
better. Denies CP, fevers. Endorses a chronic mild cough that
occ produces clear sputum.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. ADmits to chronic mild cough, with clear sputum.
Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. No recent

MICROBIOLOGY:
[**2171-2-8**] BLOOD CULTURE NEGATIVE

EKG: Normal sinus rhythm with rate of 81, normal axis, no signs
concerning for ischemia.

Chest Radiograph:  [**2171-2-8**]
1. Mild cardiomegaly and vascular congestion.
2. Right lower lobe opacity, may represent atelectasis, although
infection cannot be excluded.

TTE [**2171-2-13**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. There is
abnormal septal motion/position. The aortic valve is not well
seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve
leaflets are not well seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Moderate right ventricular
dilation with severe global hypokinesis. Moderate to severe
pulmonary hypertension. Preserved global left ventricular
systolic function.

LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLER U/S [**2171-2-13**]:
Limited study as right peroneal veins not visualized. Otherwise,
no evidence of bilateral lower extremity DVT.

CTA CHEST [**2171-2-14**]:
1. No evidence of PE.
2. Mild cardiomegaly.
3. Emphysema.
4. No definite evidence for CHF or pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
70 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for COPD on 3L home
oxygen therapy, OSA, unknown type of CHF, OSA, cor pulmonale,
who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of
hypercarbic respiratory distress.

ACTIVE PROBLEMS:
1. COPD EXACERBATION:  he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH for
management of hypercarbic respiratory distress in the setting of
recent and likely ongoing acute exacerbation of COPD.  He was
admitted to the MICU after starting BiPAP in the ED and was
subsequently weaned off overnight.  He received azithromycin in
the ED and was broadened to levaquin, vancomycin, and cefepime
in the ICU when chest X-Ray showed evidence of possible
pneumonia, though this was narrowed back to levaquin given his
rapid  clinical improvemen
