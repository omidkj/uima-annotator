Reason: evaluate rll s/p min inv mvr

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
57 year old man with s/p min inv mvr
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate rll s/p min inv mvr
HISTORY: Mitral valve replacement.

Three radiographs of the chest again demonstrate a tiny
right-sided pneumothorax. Linear lung markings involving the
bilateral mid and lower lungs represent persistent atelectasis.
There is a persistent right-sided effusion. Trachea is midline.

Persistent bilateral atelectasis and right-sided pleural
effusion.

Tiny right-sided pneumothorax.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus in the LA/LAA or the RA/RAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. No ASD by 2D or
color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta with no atherosclerotic plaque.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Partial
mitral leaflet flail. Moderate to severe (3+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient.
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta are normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque
to 35 cm from the incisors. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is partial mitral leaflet flail. There is an
eccentric mitral regurgitant with a P2 flail segment of mitral
valve c/w Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in
person of the results on [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] at 2pm.

Post_Bypass:
Preserved biventricular [**Last Name (un) **] stolic function. LVEF 55%.
Thoracic aortic contour is intact.
There is a prosthesis in the mitral annular position and is
stable and functioning well. There is no residual MR>
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2149-5-1**] he was taken to the operating room where he
underwent minimally invasive mitral repair. Please refer to
operative note for further details. XCT=80 minutes,CPB=107
minutes. Patient was transferred to ICU in stable condition.
Mr.[**Known lastname **] was extubated on POD #1, prolonged due to a
respiratory acidosis. He was transferred to the floor on POD#1.
Hospital course complicated by Atrial Fibrillation which was
treated with an increase in Beta Blocker and started on
Amiodarone.Rhythm converted to normal sinus and amio changed to
po dosing. CXR post chest tube removal revealed a tiny right
sided, stable pneumothorax. He was reday for discharge home on
POD #4.
