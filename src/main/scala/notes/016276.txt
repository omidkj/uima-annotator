Allergies:
Penicillins / Cephalosporins / Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
Syncope and Shortness of Breath, Hyptension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
87 yo F with h/o pulmonary fibrosis, CAD, presented to [**Location (un) 620**]
from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab for evaluation of syncope and SOB worse than
baseline. Pt reports feeling well until yesterday morning,
unable to have lunch due to feeling unwell, although denied
abdominal pain or nausea. After lunch pt had bowel movement and
afterwards had witnessed syncopal episode. No trauma was
reported. Pt denied any CP, Palp, Abd pain. Reported
cramping/nausea 2 days ago but nothing since.
.
At [**Name (NI) 620**], pt found to be hypoxic to mid 80s, intermittently
hypotensive. CXR showed baseline fibrosis and possible pulmonary
edema but was unable to rule out PNA so pt received Levaquin.
Head CT at [**Location (un) 620**] without intracranial process. Pt also
received 3L IVF and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for furthur workup.

.
Here, initial vitals T98 HR84 BP100/60 RR24 O2 94%on Venturi
50%. Labs were significant for INR 1.4, WBC 13.7 (87%N), HCT
49->42, Trop 0.05, ALT/AST 61/142, Lipase 69, LDH 663, Cr 1
(Baseline 0.8), Lactate 2.8. UA was also positive, and urine and
blood cultures were sent. Abdomen completely benign, but given
elevated lactate, CTA abdomen was done and showed sigmoiditis
c/w ischemic process.  Pt received Flagyl, ASA and Zofran, as
well as ativan. General surgery evaluated pt but pt refusing
surgery. Pt was also evaluated by GI who recommended tx with
IVF, ASA, Cipro/Flagyl but were not particularly impressed by
the extent of the bleed, given elevated Hct.
.
Family/pt discussion confirmed DNR/DNI based on prior
discussions and reassessment.

C spine CT:
no cervical spine fracture. grade I anterolisthesis of C7 on T1,
likely degenerative. if clinical concern for ligamentous injury,
an MRI is more sensitive for evaluation. multilevel degenerative
change.
.
Abd/Pelvis CT:
Circumferential wall thickening of the sigmoid colon, suggestive
of a colitis, which may be infectious/inflammatory. Though no
arterial thrombus is identified, given distribution, ischemia
cannot be excluded. Infrarenal AAA, measuring up to 5 cm in
maximal dimensions. Small pericardial effusion.
.
Most recent ECHO at [**Location (un) 620**]:
Mild biatrial enlargement. LVEF was 60%. There was moderate LV
diastolic dysfunction. There was marked PA systolic
hypertension.   Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was likely
elevated. RV cavity was markedly dilated with severe global RV
free wall hypokinesis and abnormal septal motion consistent with
RV pressure/volume overload. There was mild functional MS and
trivial MR. There was mild to moderate TR with moderate PA
systolic hypertension.
.
EKG:
NSR @ 85, rightward axis, normal intervals, diffuse
TWI/flattening, poor RWP, right atrial enlargement
.
CXR [**10-9**] at [**Location (un) **]:
Upper zone vacular redistribution more pronounced than [**7-19**] c/w
pulmonary edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
87 yo F with h/o CAD, Pulmonary Fibrosis and COPD, presents with
syncope and hypoxia likely secondary to poor cardiopulmonary
reserve during exertion.  She was also noted to have one
melanotic BM.

## Hypoxia/IPF: At OSH, chest x-ray was felt consistent with
pneumonia and given levofloxacin.  On transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], patient
had increased oxygen requirement over baseline.  After transfer
from MICU to floor, oxygen was attempted to wean down, but
unsuccessful.  Cardiology and pulmonology were consulted.
Cardiology felt that despite her hypoxia she was overalli
intravascularly deplete and recomended IVF.  Pulmonology felt
that her hypoxia was likely [**1-23**] to progression of her fibrotic
lung disease.  She was started on prednisone 50mg daily but was
without significant improvement.  She was maintained on her
ativan prn given her chronic anxiety and small anxiety component
of her hypoxia. Vasodilators such as sidenafil were considered
but were thought to worsen her orthostasis and provide no
benefit in oxygenation.  Her CT scan showed significant fibrosis
(irreversible) and no signs of inflammatory disease that may be
reversible.  After disucssion with the palliative care team,
patient and her family decided to go home with hospice for
continued symptomatic treatment of her pulmonary disease.
.
#. Syncope: Likely due to tenuous balance of volume status.
Possibility that patient had orthostatic hypotension in setting
of hypovolemia due to requirement of 5-6L IVF on admssion.
Cardiac workup recently completed, recent ECHO, EKG unchanged,
CEs neg. Monitored on telemetry with no events.  Repeat echo
during admission was stable, bubble study negative. Likely
patient has no cardiopulmonary reserve during exertion and was
unable to tolerate ambulation at home, especially being
hypovolemic.  She was sent home with hospice for her end stage
pulmonary fibrosis with 24 hr home care.

#. Hypotension: Blood pressure was stable after recieving IV
fluids prior to transfer from outside hospital and additional
fluids in [**Hospital1 18**] ED.  Total fluids approximately 5-6L.  Patient
was admitted to the ICU for management, however, blood pressure
remained stable.  No pressors required.  Blood pressure remained
stable over the duration of admission.

# Hematochezia: Patinet had one episode of bloody stool that
were gauiac positive after admission.  GI consult felt possible
infectious vs. ischemic colitis.  CT abdomen and pelvis showed
mural wall edema and circumferential wall thickening that could
be consist
