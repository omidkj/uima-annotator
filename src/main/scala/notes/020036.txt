Chief Complaint:
Motor Vehicle Accident

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
78 y/o M with history of HTN, COPD (apparently on home O2 at
night), AFIB (unknown if on coumadin) who initially presented
after [**First Name3 (LF) 39447**]. Patient was med-flighted to [**Hospital1 18**] ED. Unknown if
patient was restrained however was driver of car. Prolonged
extrication from car (>20 minutes). Apparently was intubated
then for airway protection and was not in respiratory distress.
It is unclear what medications were used for intubation.
.
In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, patient had full trauma evaluation by surgery
including Ct of head, c-spine, and torso, which did not reveal
any major injuries. On close evaluation, patient had small right
heel laceration which was repaired. During repair, ED resident
noted that patient had 20+ beats of clonus. Remainder of neuro
exam was unrevealing. Patient was not extubated for concern of
clonus.
.
Initial laboratory data revealed lactate 4.0, ABG of
7.26/80/316/38, and negative serum tox. Patient was given IVFs
(unknown volume) and repeat lactate was 2.2.
.
ED team contact[**Name (NI) **] wife, who was also in car at time of [**Name (NI) 39447**] and
was sent to another hospital, who stated that he was smoking at
time of accident and was complaining of nausea and ?chest pain.
.
Given metabolic concern for clonus and unclear cause for [**Name (NI) 39447**],
patient remained intubated and admitted to MICU for further
evaluation.
.
In MICU, patient intubated and sedated however moving all 4
extremities.

   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2117-6-24**]):
      SPARSE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
      SERRATIA MARCESCENS.    MODERATE GROWTH.
         Piperacillin/tazobactam sensitivity testing available
on request.
         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.
