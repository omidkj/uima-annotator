[**2146-3-1**] B/L Hips:
Bilateral superior and inferior pubic rami fractures, as
demonstrated on prior CT.

[**2146-3-3**] MRI T spine :
1. The T6 and T12 vertebral body fractures appear chronic in
nature. No
acute fractures are identified.
2. Minimal extrinsic indentation on the spinal cord by slightly
retropulsed T12 vertebral body. Subtle increased signal within
the spinal cord at this level could be due to prominent central
canal on an area of myelomalacia only seen on sagittal inversion
recovery images and difficult to evaluate on the axial images
secondary to artifacts.
3. Changes of cervical spondylosis visualized on the sagittal
images in the cervical region from C4-5 to C6-7 level.



Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2146-3-1**], the patient was admitted to the trauma ICU on the
acute care surgery service for a fall with pelvic fractures and
hematoma.  Hematocrit was checked regularly, and she was
transfused 1u PRBC for a hematocrit of 23 and subsequently
stabelized in the 27 range.  She also had compression fractures
of T6 and T12 that were evaluated as chronic by an MRI.  She was
in rapid atrial fibrillation on admission with a Troponin of
0.02-0.06.  She was treated with lopressor, her rate was
controlled and she subsequently converted to normal sinus
rhythme with occasional PAC's which she sustained.  By
[**2146-3-3**], she was hemodynamically stable and she was
transferred to the floor.

Following transfer to the Trauma floor she continued to make
good progress.  She was evaluated by the Physical and
Occupational Therapy services and she was able to bear weight
with some pain but was able to take a few steps.   She will need
further rehab with the goal of getting her back home
independently.

She remained in NSR with PAC's and was able to tolerate
lopressor 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **]. She was taking a regular diet in modest
amounts and voiding sufficiently.  Her last hematocrit prior to
discharge was 27.4.  She was discharged to rehab on [**2146-3-3**] and
will follow up in the Acute Care Clinic in [**1-6**] weeks as well as
the orthopedic Clinic in 4 weeks.
