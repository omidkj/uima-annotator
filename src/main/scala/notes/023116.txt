CHEST (SINGLE VIEW) IN O.R.  [**2102-9-1**] 1:21 PM
ONE VIEW CHEST: A single fluoroscopic spot intraoperative
radiograph was obtained. A right tunneled dialysis catheter
begins outside the field of view and extends into the distal
SVC. The tracheostomy has not changed in position.
IMPRESSION: Right tunneled dialysis catheter with tip in the
distal SVC.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2102-8-29**] 9:22 AM
FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest obtained with patient in
supine position is analyzed in direct comparison with a similar
preceding study obtained [**2102-8-28**]. Position of
tracheal cannula is unchanged. The previously described
parenchymal densities in the apical areas of both upper lobes
have further progressed and so is the evidence of pleural
effusions bilaterally apparently layering posteriorly but
reaching also the apical area

TISSUE (Final [**2102-8-11**]):
      STAPH AUREUS COAG +.    SPARSE GROWTH.
         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.
         Trimethoprim/Sulfa sensitivity testing performed by
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3077**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3060**].
      ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE.    SPARSE GROWTH.
         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.

MCG/ML

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to cardiac surgery. He received vitamin K
and FFP for an INR of 10. He was given amiodarone for rapid
afib. He was started on meropenum and vancomycin. He was then
taken to the operating room where he underwent sternal
debridement and VAC dressing placement. He was transferred to
the ICU in stable condition on propofol. He remained sedated and
paralyzed. He was started on tube feeds. His paralytics were
dc'd on POD #2. He was taken back to the operating room on [**8-11**]
by plastic surgery for further debridement and vac replacement.
His vac was again changed on [**8-14**]. Blood cultures grew MRSA. He
remained on vanco. He underwent TEE for MRSA bacteremia, no
vegetations were identified. He was taken back to the operating
room by plastic surgery on [**8-16**] where he underwent further
debridement and irrigation as well as bilateral pectoralis
myofascial advancement flaps. He was seen by infectious diseases
and he finished courses of vancomycin and meropenum. Renal
counsult was called for borderline oliguria, increasing
creatinine and volume overload, and acute on chronic renal
failure. Renal u/s showed No evidence of hydronephrosis in
either kidney. He was started a lasix drip, however required
dialysis within the next few days. He underwent tunnelled
catheter placement on [**2102-8-31**]. He continued with intermittent
hemodialysis. He was stable for discharge to rehab on [**2102-9-7**].
He continues to require ventilatory support.
