History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 21006**] is a Spanish-speaking 74 yoM (son is translating in
the [**Name (NI) **]) with a h/o CAD (s/p stent [**12-18**]), CVA, GERD and asthma
who presented to the ED from home with 2+ hours of "spitting up"
blood. Per patient and family, this was not [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 104845**] or
hemoptysis, but rather blood in the OP. He denied emesis, cough,
ENT pain, abd/chest pain, melena/brbpr and SOB.
.
In the ED, VS were T 99.2, P 79, BP 176/76, RR 14, 99% RA. NG
tube was attempted to be placed twice w/o success; thus, NG
lavage was not performed. He was noted to have bleeding from his
NP and the right nares was packed (around 5 pm pm on [**2142-1-13**]). By
8 pm, the packing had been soaked through; the patient was then
given affrin and a balloon was put in place to tamponade the
bleed. Hct was 32.9 on admission with a baseline in low 40's as
of [**10-18**] (MCV unchanged). Given he was not tachycardic or
orthostatic, he did not receive an RBC transfusion in the ED.
.
Of note, the patient is on warfarin for stroke/TIA (?); ED notes
say had a DVT in RLE one month ago and has been on Coumadin
since that time, though has older rxn in OMR. His INR was noted
to be 14.1 on admission. He was given 10 mg IV Vit K; two units
of FFP have been ordered but not yet administered. The ED staff
also spoke with the cards fellow given the recent stent
placement (in right ? LE artery for PVD); they advised to keep
on ASA and plavix currently.
.
ENT saw him in the ED and did a flex scope and standard anterior
rhinoscopy. They noted several areas of oozing along the septum
bilaterally w/o a clear single, brisk source. Gauze soaked in
bacitracin was placed in the right nares. Left nares was packed
with gelfoam and surgicell packing. Oral cavity clear.
.
The ED staff spoke with the GI fellow, who is deferring EGD
tonight and is recommending IV PPI overnight. Low suspicion for
UGIB.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT/PLAN:  74 y/o spanish speaking M with h/o PVD s/p
stenting of RLE in [**12-18**], CVA, GERD and asthma who presented to
the ED with gross epistaxis and hct drop in setting of elevated
INR.
.
#) Epistaxis/Bleed: Initially unknown source, however ENT scoped
the patient and visualized bleeding. There were several areas of
oozing along the septum bilaterally w/o a clear single, brisk
source. Gauze soaked in bacitracin was placed in the right
nares. Left nares was packed with gelfoam and surgicell packing.
Pt was reversed with Vitamin K and FFP, treated with Keflex and
monitored overnight in the ICU.  Bleeding was felt to be
secondary to extremely supratherapeutic INR.  Patient reported
taking his coumadin twice a day which likely led to increased
levels. Hct decreased from 38 to 29, however it remained stable
after packing.  He was called out to the floor on the 2nd
hospital day and Hct remained stable.  His coumadin was held and
on the day of discharge INR was 1.2.  He will continue Keflex
while packing in place and this will remain in for 5 days.  He
will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (ENT) for packing removal.
Given recent stent placement he was continued on ASA and plavix.
.
#) ARF:  BUN 34, Cr 1.5 on admission; baseline Cr 1.0-1.1.
BUN:Cr ratio suggested pre-renal etiology.  Cr returned to
baseline with IVF.
.
#) LEUKOCYTOSIS: WBC was 14 on admission. Patient was afebrile.
Felt to be stress response given no localized signs of
infection. He was treated with Keflex prophylactically and WBC
normalized on day of discharge.
.
#) CAD/recent stent:  The ED staff spoke with the cardiology
service given the recent stent placement in RLE; they advised to
keep on ASA and plavix.
.
#) GERD: Initially on protonix [**Hospital1 **] given concern for possible GI
source of bleed.  This was then stopped and patient was
discharged on his usual outpatient ranitidine.
.
#) DIABETES:  Patient is on metformin and NPH as outpatient.
His metformin was held while in house.  He was placed on a
insulin SS while inpatient.  He will resume his outpatient
regimen on discharge.
.
#) HYPERLIPIDEMIA: Continued statin.
.
#) ASTHMA: Continued albuterol and advair.
.
#) HTN: On amlodipine and lisinopril at home.  Antihypertensives
were initially held given bleeding.  These were restarted at
discharge.
.
#) CODE: full (confirmed with son)
.
#) COMMUNICATION: son [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 1071**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 104847**]; PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
