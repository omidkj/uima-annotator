Service:

This is a 47-year-old male with multiple medical problems
namely obstructive sleep apnea/obesity, hyperventilation
syndrome, status post BiPAP complicated by failure on BiPAP,
status post trache collar placed on [**1-11**], also type 2
diabetes, idiopathic cardiomyopathy.  The patient was in
usual state of health until four to five days ago, started
experiencing increased cough and wheezing.  Also notes
increasing fatigue with diarrhea x3 days and decreased urine
output.  Denies sick contacts or suspicious foods.  No sexual
contact.  Regarding diarrhea, the patient describes loose
stools 3 times per day with a normal volume and no blood.
Denies chest pain, lightheadedness, dizziness, diaphoresis,
nausea or vomiting.  No fevers or chills.  No PND, no leg
swelling.  The patient reports receiving flu shot, does not
know if he has received Pneumovax.  Recent [**Hospital **] hospital
course in [**1-11**] for trache collar followed by rehab stay at
[**Hospital1 **].

In the ED, the patient was found to be hypertensive with
systolic blood pressures in the 80s.  Was given 2 liters
fluid bolus without significant response and was started on
dopamine.  Oxygen saturation was found to be 94 percent on
room air.  The patient was given nebulizers and placed on
supplemental oxygen.  The patient was found to have UTI by UA
and was started on Levaquin empirically.  The patient was
subsequently initiated in the sepsis protocol and transferred
to the MICU.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS ON ADMISSION:  Heart rate
98, blood pressure 89/44, heart rate 74, breathing 16, and 95
percent on 2 liters.  GENERAL:  Obese man in mild respiratory
distress.  HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to
light.  Moist mucous membranes.  NECK:  Without bruits.  No
lymphadenopathy.  Questionable JVD.  RESPIRATORY:  With
diffuse wheezing bilaterally.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate,

nondistended, and obese.  Guaiac negative on rectal exam.

LABORATORY DATA:  Labs on admission notable for white count
of 16.4 with 78 neutrophils, 15 lymphocytes, no bands.
Hematocrit of 48, platelets 396, PT 18.5, INR 2.3, sodium
138, potassium 4.9, chloride 95, bicarbonates 32, BUN 18,
creatinine of 1.3, glucose of 115.  Venous blood gas was 7.35-
56-36 with the mixed venous out of 65 percent, and a lactate
of 2.0 which declined to 1.1.  UA showed moderate leukocyte
esterase, small blood, positive nitrite, 100 protein, 11 to
20 white blood cells, and no bacteria.  Chest x-ray showed
possible early right middle lobe infiltrate.  No evidence of
CHF or effusions.  Blood cultures were drawn.  Sputum culture
was drawn.  EKG showed sinus rhythm at 70 beats per minute,
normal axis, normal intervals, normal R-wave progression.  No
acute ST or T-wave changes.  No signs of active ischemia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 47-year-old male with multiple
medical problems, now with evidence of UTI and physiology
consistent with sepsis.

Presumed sepsis:  The patient was continued on the sepsis
protocol from the ED.  He was given BiPAP, but refusing.  The
patient's O2 saturation remained stable on 5 liters by nasal
cannula.  Chest x-ray remained clear.  The patient was
continued on nebulizers and MDI.  Regarding his hypotension,
the patient had a Cortrosyn test but was found to be
adrenally competent.  There was no evidence of adrenal
insufficiency.  Ultimately, there was no evidence of sepsis.
The patient was continued on Levaquin, weaned off dopamine
with resultant STPs  greater than 100.  The patient's cardiac
status remained stable.  All medications were initially held,
but slowly restarting as patient's hemodynamics stabilized
and the patient was called out to the floor on [**2114-3-13**] after
pressors had been weaned.

Urinary tract infection:  At the time of admission to the
floor, the patient denied any burning or pain with urination,
denied any abdominal pain or flank pain.  Unfortunately, no
cultures had been drawn at the time of admission.  The
patient was continued empirically on Levaquin for a 7-day
course.  White blood count was trending down.  Blood cultures
remained negative.

Hypotension, initially thought to be consistent with septic
physiology versus adrenal insufficiency, however, neither
were the case.  The patient stabilized off pressors and
hypotension essentially resolved.  The patient was restarted
on outpatient mediation.  Transient hypovolemia was thought
to be initially secondary to poor p.o. intake and then
subsequently secondary to infection, although patient has
never been bacteremic.

Pulmonary:  The patient's chest x-ray remained clear.  Sputum
culture remained negative.  The patient was continued on
BiPAP and will be followed up by Respiratory services as an
outpatient.  The patient was continued on nebulizers and MDIs
for his asthma/COPD.  At the time of discharge, the patient's
O2 saturation was approximately 95 percent on room air and
the patient was able to ambulate without desaturation.

Acute renal failure.  Acute renal failure improved with IV
fluid hydration.  ACE inhibitor was held and was restarted
prior to discharge for control of blood pressure.  The
patient's urine output remained stable.  No active issues.

Diabetes.  The patient was given a diabetic/cardiac diet,
Regular Insulin sliding scale.  Diabetic medications were
held during hospitalization and were restarted upon
discharge.

Atrial fibrillation.  The patient was continued on Coumadin
and amiodarone.  The patient maintained therapeutic INRs
during this hospital course.  Prophylaxis was with a PPI,
Coumadin, and bowel regimen.  The patient's code status
remained full code.
