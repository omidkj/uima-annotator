and was intubated for respiratory distress. CT showed PE in
addition to dense consolidation. Bronch washings showing
Enterobacter and was treated with 8 day course of meropenem
after initial broad coverage. Discharged on heparin gtt and
coumadin also. She had completed meropenem on ?[**2191-4-10**] via PICC
line and had been doing well since. On [**4-20**] AM she spiked to
102.5 with fatigue. Here endorses cough with brownish-red

throat, dysphagia, aspiration, abdominal pain, diarrhea, urinary
sx, change in leg swelling, rash, bleeding.

In the ED, T100.9, BP 94/61, HR 52, R20, 94% RA. Lowest SBP

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 47 year old female with HIV not on HAART, recent
Enterobacter pneumonia status-post 8 day Meropenem course,
readmitted with fevers and empyema vs. lung abscess on CT.

# Lung abscess vs. empyema. Given very recent previous admission
for HAP, concerning for continued presence of Enterobacter as
the causative organism, vs. other bug as superinfection.
Unlikely PCP or atypical/fungal/mycobacterial. Chest CT with
contrast for further characterization of RLL area suggests a
possible necrotic process in the area of her previously treated
pneumonia. Thoracics did follow the patient, however surgical
intervention is not indicated at this time. She was placed on
Meropenem and Vancomycin after consultation with the ID consult
service. She will continue this regimen for 21 days.  Pt was
afebrile x36 hours on discharge.
.
# Hypotension. This was transient and responsive to IV fluids.
She had an isolated SBP < 90, and then she returned to her
baseline SBP in the 90's.
.
# Hypoxia. The pt was continued on a heparin gtt for her recent
PE. She was able to breathe comfortably on room air on day 1 of
admission, so hypoxia was extremely transient. On discharge the
pt's O2 sats on room air were 99%.
.
# PE/APS. On admission the pt was on coumadin with heparin drip
bridge. On admission, the Coumadin was held in case of thoracic
surgery intervention and she was placed on a heparin drip.
Because of her antiphospholipid syndrome, her goal INR once back
on Coumadin is [**2-8**]. On discharge the pt's coumadin was
restarted.
.
# HIV. Not on HAART due to adherence issues. Last CD4 159. On
atovaquone for prophylaxis for PCP due to [**Name9 (PRE) 101144**] while on
bactrim.

# CHF, systolic dysfucntion, chronic. Has known EF of 20%.
Lisinopril was continued on discharge. Carvedilol was stopped
due to pt's chronic cocaine use.
.
# Hoarseness. She reported this symptom for 1 day prior to
admission. The ear, nose and throat service examined the pt and
thought that this is likely candidal, and fluconazole was
restarted.
.
