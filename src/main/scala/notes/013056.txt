Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13159**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This is an 87yoM with history of ESRD on HD (TTSa), CHF, AS,
myelodysplastic syndrome who presents from [**Location (un) **] with acute
dyspnea. Per report patient was in USOH until this evening when
he complained of acute SOB. On evaluation at [**Hospital3 2558**],
patient was desatting to 70s on RA. EMS was called and placed
patient on NRB mask and transported him to [**Hospital1 18**].
In the ED, initial VS were: 98.5 105 117/61 28 100% 15L NRB.
Patient was very tachypneic on arrival and appeared hypervolemic
and febrile on exam. LUE was noted to be mildly edematous.
Patient was started CPAP with improvement of respiratory status.
Labs were significant for leukocytosis to 26.4 with lactate of
2.4. Troponin was 0.52. CXR showed pulmonary edema. CTA chest
was completed and showed large pleural effusions without e/o
PEs. Patient was then admitted to the MICU for further
evaluation. Patient received Vancomycin and levofloxacin while
in ED VS prior to transfer were 98.1 86 141/55 25 98%BiPAP.
In MICU, patient stated that breathing was feeling better.
Denied chest pain, palpitations or abdominal pain.
Of note patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) **]
with similar complaints during which time palliative care was
consulted to discuss of end of life issues. During this time,
hospice was introduced given that patient did not appear to be
tolertating dialysis.


Past Medical History:

Imaging
CXR [**2193-6-20**]: Recurrent, moderately severe, pulmonary edema,
worsened since [**6-10**].  Bibasilar opacification, likely edema
and atelectasis.
.
CT chest [**2193-6-20**]:
No pulmonary embolism. Evaluation of subsegmental vessels is
limited. Moderate to large bilateral pleural effusions with
associated atelectasis. Moderate bilateral ground glass opacity
likely represents pulmonary edema.
Additional findings are present in addition to the original wet
read: There
appears to be a small amount of gas within the right rectal wall
(2:73).
Stercoral colitis is suspected given the presence of a large
amount of rectal
stool. Trace free air is present (2:38). The apparent trace
pneumobilia may
instead represent intraperitoneal air dissecting along portal
veins.
Alternatively, portal gas is possible.
.
CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST [**2193-6-20**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  Minimal biliary air in the gallbladder and biliary tree is
nonspecific and may the sequelae of prior instrumentation such
ERCP/sphinterotomy. Please correlate with patients history.  No
free air.
2.  Comminuted fracture of the left ilium with extension to the
superior pubic ramus and acetabulum. Acetabular component has
intra-articular extension without femoral head involvement or
dislocation.
3.  Changes of ankylosing spondylitis with fusion of the right
sacroiliac
joint and vertebral body.
4. Diffusely abnormal marrow with sclerosis and atrophic kidneys
consistent renal osteodystrophy. Osseous sequelae of
myeloproliferative disease are also superimposed.
5.  Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with subsegmental
atelectasis.
Difficult to exclude infectious consolidation in the atelectatic
lung.
6. Mild fusiform aneurysmal dilatation of the abdominal aorta
just proximal to the bifurcation measuring 2.2 cm

CXR [**2193-6-26**]
In comparison with study of [**6-20**], the degree of bilateral
opacification may be slightly less prominent.  Substantial
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists.

Brief Hospital Course:
87 year old M with ESRD on HD (T/Th/Sa), renal osteodystrophy,
diastolic CHF, severe aortic stenosis, myelodysplastic syndrome,
who presented from [**Hospital3 2558**] on [**2193-6-20**] with dyspnea [**12-20**] to
pulmonary edema now resolved but with acute/subacute fractures
of the left acetabulum and found to have free air which is
thought to be [**12-20**] stercoral ulcer.

Active Issues:
# Acute Respiratory Distress: Pt was hypoxic on admission
requiring O2 therapy secondary to pulmonary edema. Inciting
event unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] evidence of PNA or PE on CT scan. No evidence
of MI. TTE showed stable severe AS. Pt appeared hypervolemic and
was approximately 3kg above last dry wt. Pt respiratory symptoms
improved after he received emergent ultrafiltration. Since
resolution of acute dyspneic event pt has been asymptomatic and
tolerating 2L of O2 with Pox sats > 95. An oxygen weaning trial
resulted in O2 sats dropping to around 92%. CXR was obtained
which did not show evidence of recurrent pulmonary edema. He
will be discharged on 2L of O2.

#Left acetabular fracture: This was found incidentally on the CT
abd/pelvis.  Patient reported a fall 1 week prior with minimal
pain. He remembers falling while trying to put on his pants.
Orthopedics was consulted to recommended surgery. However given
his sever AS and multiple poor outcome comorbidites it was felt
that he would survive this type of high risk surgery
