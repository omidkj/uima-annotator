Discharge Labs:

Micro:

[**2154-7-24**] ECG: Sinus rhythm. Normal tracing. No previous tracing
available for comparison.

[**2154-7-25**] Echo:  Normal regional and global biventricular systolic
function. No pathologic valvular abnormality seen. Normal
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure.

[**2154-7-25**] CT Head: No acute intracranial process. CT is less
sensitive in the
detection of early cerebral edema. Clinical correlation to
evaluate for
worsening encephalopathy is recommended. Intracranial pressure
monitoring and close followup should be done if clinically
indicated.

[**2154-7-25**] Abd U/S: 1. Gallbladder wall edema likely related to
hepatic failure. 2. Otherwise normal abdominal
ultrasound/hepatic Doppler.

Brief Hospital Course:
32 yo woman with a history of substance abuse, bipolar disorder,
asthma, and recently diagnosed fibromyalgia presents after
multiple medication overdoses with acute liver and renal
failure.
.
1) Acute liver failure: Patient presented with a transaminitis
peaking at ALT 2900 and T. bili 4.1 on transfer from OSH
attributed primarily to acetaminophen toxicity. In house ALT
peak was 2726, AST 292, Tbili 3.6. Patient was admitted to MICU
and was continued on IV NAC (started by the OSH) until her
transaminases trended down below 1000. She was seen by
hepatology and given lactulose and rifaximin to treat her
hepatic encephalopathy- her mental status and asterixis improved
gradually. She was seen by transplant surgery who began
evaluation for liver transplant (sent hepatitis serologies, [**Doctor First Name **],
AMA, anti-smooth muscle Ab, HIV Ab- all negative, abdominal U/S-
which showed gallbladder wall edema likely related to hepatic
failureand, and TTE- normal), but they signed off when it was
clear that her clinical status was improving quickly and she
would not require transplant. Patient also underwent head CT
given her altered mental status, which was negative for cerebral
edema. On return to baseline mental status, patient was
transferred to the floor, where lactulose and rifaximin were
discontinued and transaminases, bilirubin, and INR continued to
trend down. Hepatotoxins were avoided. On discharge, patient was
alert and oriented x3 and LFTs had trended down to ALT 278* AST
33 LDH 244 and AKP 115*, INR 1.3.
.
2) Renal failure: Patient presented with creatinine of 6.1 at
OSH. Nephrology was consulted and felt her acute renal failure
was due to her ingestions, probably primarily topiramate
tox
