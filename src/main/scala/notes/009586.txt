Service:  Surgery, Green Team

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 72-year-old
gentleman with a past medical history of hypertension, a
50-year smoking history, alcohol abuse, and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease who presented to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1888**] with a large polyp in the right colon.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  He was
taken to the operating room on [**2122-10-20**] for a right
colectomy.  This operation went smoothly.  An ileocecectomy
was done with an end-to-side ileotransverse colon anastomosis
(hand sewn).  There were no operative complications.

The patient was kept intubated overnight on the first night
due to marginal respiratory effort.  He was extubated on
postoperative day one.  In the afternoon on postoperative day
one, he was noted to be tachycardic and agitated.  A workup
indicated that at that point he had entered delirium tremens.
The dictation from this point on will cover his protracted
hospital course by systems for simplicity sake.

1.  NEUROLOGIC ISSUES:  The patient was started on Ativan for
his delirium tremens, and this Ativan was required for
extreme agitation for a number of weeks.  He was very slowly
tapered off the Ativan.  At this point, he was maintained on
clonidine and as needed Haldol for his agitation.

He has also been diagnosed with metabolic encephalopathy and
has a variable examination; at times only tracking with his
eyes but not following commands and at other times attempting
to speak and following commands.

Neurologically, he also had a fall out of bed in early
[**Month (only) 359**].  A full workup was done for that including a head
computed tomography and a head and neck magnetic resonance
imaging; all of which were negative.  A cervical spine collar
was removed after Orthopaedics approved his studies.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  From a cardiovascular standpoint,
he flipped into atrial fibrillation at the time of the onset
of his delirium tremens.  He was started on amiodarone and
Lopressor, and his heart rate was controlled well.  He
actually converted to a sinus rhythm on [**11-27**].  The
amiodarone and Lopressor were to be continued.

3.  RESPIRATORY ISSUES:  The patient has respiratory failure.
He was reintubated after his surgery on the night on
postoperative day one.  Eventually, his family agreed to a
tracheostomy which was performed on [**2122-11-20**].

Currently, the patient is in continuous positive airway
pressure mode on a ventilator with pressure support at 15,
and positive end-expiratory pressure at 10, with 40% FIO2,
and his blood gastric on these settings was satisfactory.  He
is on slow pressure support wean at this time.

4.  GASTROINTESTINAL ISSUES:  From a gastrointestinal
standpoint, he underwent a right colectomy.  The pathology
report showed that his cecal polyp was an adenoma.  He was
tolerating tube feeds at goal through a percutaneous
endoscopic gastrostomy tube which was also placed on [**2122-11-20**].  His tube feed rate is 85 cc per hour; which is
goal.

5.  GENITOURINARY ISSUES:  The patient has maintained a
normal blood urea nitrogen and creatinine.  He has adequate
urine output.  He had a Foley catheter in place which was
draining clear yellow urine.  He has received Lasix on a
regular basis to keep him at an even to slightly negative
fluid balance.

6.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  From an Infectious Disease
standpoint, the patient is currently on tobramycin and
meropenem as coverage for Campylobacter and Pseudomonas
pneumonia.  These two antibiotics are infusing through a
right antecubital peripherally inserted central catheter
line; his only intravenous access, and they should be
continued for a full 14-day course (which ends on [**2122-12-13**]).

7.  HEMATOLOGIC ISSUES:  The patient was being anticoagulated
for his atrial fibrillation.  He has received Coumadin, and
his INR is currently 1.6.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: (His current medications are)
1.  Insulin sliding-scale which has not been needed.
2.  Lansoprazole 30 mg by mouth once per day.
3.  Amiodarone 400 mg per PEG-tube once per day.
4.  Clonidine 0.4 mg per PEG-tube three times per day.
5.  Lopressor 25 mg per PEG-tube twice per day.
6.  Coumadin 5 mg for the last two days; to be dosed
according to INR.
7.  Haldol as needed.
8.  Lasix as needed.
9.  Tobramycin and meropenem intravenously.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:   At this point, he is deemed
appropriate for ventilatory rehabilitation and will be
allowed to be transferred when he is accepted at an
appropriate institution.
