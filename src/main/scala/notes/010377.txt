History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 72 year old male with a history of COPD, GERD,
hypertension, and alcohol abuse who was recently hospitalized at
[**Hospital1 18**] from [**2133-7-11**] to [**2133-7-23**] for decompensated alcoholic
cirrhosis, acute kidney injury and bilateral deep venous
thrombosis. Course was also complicated by
altered mental status attributed to hepatic encephalopathy and
anemia requiring transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood
cells.  During prior admission, nutrition was a major challenge
and pt continually removed dobhoff.  He was also noted to have
large ascited (SBP negative).  Furthermore, a EGD revealed
portal gastropathy and no varices.

He was ultimately discharged to rehab and followed up in clinic,
where he was informed that he is a poor transplant candidate due
to continued etoh abuse and malnourishment.

He presented to OSH ED today for coughing as well as vomitting
coffee ground emesis, increased ascites and upper abdominal pain
as well as acute renal failure with Cr >3.0.  Because he get's
his care at [**Hospital1 18**], he was transferred here.

In the ED, triage vitals were Temp: 97 HR: 130 BP: 102/71 Resp:
18 O(2)Sat: 97 Normal.  He was intubated for airway protection
and OG returned 600cc of black fluid.  A diagnostic paracentesis
was performed at bedside, results pending.  He was guaiac
negative.  Received a triple lumen in RIJ and 20G in arm.  He
was started on fentanyl/midaz drip and given 2g ctx, 80/8 of
pantoprazole as well as octreotide.

On arrival to the MICU, he is tachycardic, but otherwise
hemodynamically stable.  He is sedated and intubated.

Past Medical History:
EtOH Cirrhosis
GERD
Vitamin D deficiency
