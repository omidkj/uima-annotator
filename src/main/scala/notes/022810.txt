Brief Hospital Course:
81 yo Russian Speaking male with multiple medical problems
including [**Name2 (NI) **] sinus syndrome s/p pacemaker, CAD, CHF (EF
40-45%), DM, PVD, history of lower GI bleed presenting to ED
with chest pressure and found to have a GI bleed.

# Acute blood loss anemia: Secondary to bleeding from GI tract
most likely from the site of the polypectomy in the setting of
NSAIDS use and plavix. The patient received 4 U RBC's in the ICU
and remained hemodynamically stable. A prep was done with
intention to do a c-scope, but the patient was thought to be too
unstable. He HCT then leveled off as the plavix wore off and he
was transferred to the floor. No c-scope was performed as it was
assumed that this was a low bleed from the polypectomy site and
it had stopped. He will have his HCT checked 2 days after
discharge with VNA.

# Chest pain: Patient with substantial history of CAD. CP most
likely demand ischemia given acute blood loss and in the morning
even with hematocrit at baseline his CAD meds had been held and
his pressure was 180s. CP releieved initially with nitro gtt
then added back isosorbide dinitrate and [**5-10**] started home imdur.
Metoprolol restarted at home dose. Biomarkers trended down.
continued statin. held plavix. he will continue to hold his
plavix until he follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3357**] in 1 week.

# [**Last Name (STitle) **] sinus syndrome: A-V paced at HR in 60s. amio continued.

# Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient's most recent EF
40-45%. After blood, pt with SOB, orthopnea, rales that required
IV las
