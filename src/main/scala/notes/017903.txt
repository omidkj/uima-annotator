Pertinent Results:
[**2188-2-26**] CT Chest: Status post [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] valve replacement and
sternotomy, status post CABG. Extensive coronary and
moderate-to-severe [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] calcifications. Mild centrilobular
emphysema, no evidence of pulmonary edema. Mild pleural
calcifications, several subpleural granulomas, none of which
requires followup. Small hiatal hernia.

[**2188-2-27**] Carotid U/S: Right ICA stenosis <40%. Left ICA stenosis
60-69%.

[**2188-2-29**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma
in the ascending aorta. There are complex (mobile) atheroma in
the [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] arch. There are complex (mobile) atheroma in the
descending aorta. The transaortic gradient is higher than
expected for this type of prosthesis. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a very small pericardial effusion. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was
notified in person of the results on Mrs. [**Known lastname 43400**] before
surgical incision. POST-BYPASS: Overall LVEF 45%. Normal RV
systolic function. Mild MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 43404**] is in place,
stable and functioning well with a mean gradient of 11 mm of HG.
Intact thoracic aorta.

[**2188-3-3**] CXR: In comparison with study of [**2-29**], the Swan-Ganz
catheter and nasogastric tubes have been removed. The patient
has taken a somewhat better degree of inspiration. Continued
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with probable small
effusions and bibasilar atelectatic change. Coarse interstitial
markings persist.

Brief Hospital Course:
This 73-year-old patient who had a prior [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] valve
replacement and coronary artery bypass graft x2 with left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery and a
saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal, presented with
increasing cardiac symptoms and was investigated and was found
to have critical [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] stenosis which has been worsening with a
valve area down to 0.6. Coronary angiogram showed the grafts to
be patent, and he had disease in the right coronary artery which
was stented, and he was put on Plavix for that. He was referred
for redo [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] valve replacement. His left ventricular ejection
fraction was about 40%, and his previous surgery was about 9
years ago.The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought
to the operating room on [**2188-2-29**] where the patient underwent
redo sternotomy and redo [**Date Range 8813**] valve replacement with a size
23-mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] Magna pericardial valve. Post
operatively the patient had high volume of bloody drainage from
the chest tubes and the decision was made to return to the
operating room for reexploration. He was hemodynamically stable
upon return to the operating room. Intraoperatively there was a
significant amount of clot and blood in the mediastinum which
was evacuated. The surgical sites were explored and no bleeding
from the aortotomy or the cannulation sites was found. The only
possible bleeder was on the right chest wall, probably from the
sternal wire or needle hole, and no other significant bleeder
was found. Hemostasis was achieved and he was again transferred
to the CVICU in stable condition. He was weaned from all
vasoactive medications and extubated on POD #1 without incident.
Beta blockers were not started due to bradycardia with heart
rate in the 50-60's. Lisinopril was started for blood pressure
control. He was started on Lasix for gentle diuresis which was
increased to 40 mg IV BID with patient complaining of shortness
of breath on 3 L nasal cannula. He was transferred to the step
down unit POD #2 in stable condition. Chest tubes and pacing
wires were discontinued without complication. Oral diabetic
medication was added back for better blood sugar control. The
patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility. His hematocrit trended
down over several days and required multiple blood transfusions.
Hematocrit at time of discharge was 25.8. In addition he
underwent an echo on [**3-6**] which revealed no pericardial
effusion/tamponade. Post-op he also required a free water
restriction for hyponatremia. By the time of discharge on POD
seven the patient was ambulating
