Porcine Valve


History of Present Illness:
This is a 78 year old male with severe aortic stenosis and a
history significant for atrial fibrillation on coumadin,
hypertension, dyslipidemia, history of DVT/Phlebitis s/p filter
placement & removal, COPD and a history of respiratory failure.
An echo by Dr [**First Name (STitle) 7756**] on [**2129-4-22**] demonstrated progressive aortic
stenosis with [**Location (un) 109**] 0.9, peak gradient 80/mean 45, mild MR/ TR.
LVEF 65%. He reports shortness of breath on exertion only, such
as climbing one flight of stairs, carrying a bag from car, or
walking up an incline. This has been getting worse over the past
6 months.  He also reports bilateral ankle edema. He was
referred for right and left heart catheterization. He is now
being referred to cardiac surgery for an aortic valve
replacement.

Pertinent Results:
[**2129-5-27**] ECHO
Pre Bypass: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Mild spontaneous
echo contrast is present in the left atrial appendage. A
probable thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. The right
atrium is markedly enlarged. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve
area 0.8-1.0cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe mitral
annular calcification. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Post Bypass: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including phenylepherine. A
well-seated bioprosthetic valve is seen in the aortic position
with normal leaflet motion and gradients (mean gradient = 14
mmHg). No aortic regurgitation is seen. Regional and global left
ventricular systolic function are normal. Mitral valve anterior
leflet with increased mobility mva 3.24 cm2 by pressure half
time. MR remains trace. Remaining exam is unchanged. All
findings discussed with surgeons at the time of the exam.

Radiology Report CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2129-5-30**] 8:30 AM

Final Report : There is mild improvement of bilateral
interstitial markings and hilar prominence compared with prior
exam. No focal opacities are seen in the right, while the left
lung demonstrates improved aeration although with persistent
lower lobe atelectasis with concurrent small pleural effusion.
The mediastinum is widened secondary to mediastinotomy, but
unchanged compared with prior exam. There is no evidence of
pneumothorax. Old right-sided sixth rib fracture is again noted.

A right IJ line is seen ending in the mid SVC. Sternotomy wires
are intact.
IMPRESSION: Interval improvement of pulmonary vascular
congestion, left lower lobe atelectasis and left sided pleural
effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 67619**] was admitted for intravenous Heparin and routine
preoperative evaluation prior to aortic valve replacement.
Workup was unremarkable and he was cleared to proceed with
surgery. On [**5-27**] Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed a bioprosthetic aortic
valve replacement - for surgical details, please see operative
note.
In summary he had: Aortic valve replacement with [**Street Address(2) 17009**]. [**Hospital 923**]
Medical Biocor Epic tissue valve. His bypass time was 77 minutes
with a crossclamp time of 58 minutes. He tolerated the operation
well and post-operatively was brought to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring. On the day of surgery he woke neurologically intact,
was weaned from the ventilator and extubated.
On  postoperative day one, he was transferred to the stepdown
floor for continued post-operative care. Coumadin was resumed
for atrial fibrillation. Gentle diuresis was initiated. He
worked with nursing and physical therapy to increase his
postoperative strength and mobility. All tubes lines and
epicardial pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
On postoperative day three, he did have a temperature of 101.0.
Blood cultures were drawn and negative at the time of discharge,
urine culture was negative and the the triple lumen catheter was
discontinued.  Heparin intravenous was started for [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2966**]
on intra-op echo and preoperative atrial fibrillation. He failed
a voiding trial and the foley catherter was replaced.  Flomax
therapy was initiated.  The foley catheter was discontinued on
the evening of postoperative day number 3 without further
complication. He did hav
