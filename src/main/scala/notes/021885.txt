History of Present Illness:
This is a 53 year-old male with a history of type II diabetes
mellitus and  hyperlipidemia presents with sepsis from another
institution.  He was found at home by EMS diaphoretic and pale
with a blood pressure in the 80s.  He complained at the time of
1 week of watery diarrhea.   He also reported that he was in the
middle of his treatment for a right foot ulcer and had been on
Keflex.  At the OSH, he was noted to have a WBC 17.8 with 17%
bands, plts 36 and lactic acid to 6.8.  He became hypotensive in
OSH ED and was given 6 L NS, and started on levophed.  A CXR
wasfelt to be consisitent with a  LLL pneumonia.  He was started
on vancomycin, zoysyn, flagyl, and levofloxacin.  He was also
noted to have a wide complex tacchycardia and was started on an
amiodarone infusion.  He was intubated due to lethargy.  He was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of his sepsis.


Here VS were:T 99  BP 114/61 HR 82  Sat 100% AC FiO2 100% RR 20
TV 550 PEEP 5.  He was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further
management of his sepsis.

ROS: unable to be obtained as he is intubated and sedated.

Imaging/Pathology:
TTE [**2201-2-6**]: The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is no
ventricular septal defect. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses
or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Tricuspid regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.
TEE [**2201-2-10**]: No thrombus/mass is seen in the body of the left
atrium. A large highly mobile, well circumscribed mass (1.6 x
1.7 cm) associated with a catheter/pacing wire is seen in the
right atrium . This could be consistent with a vegetation or
thrombus. There are several smaller, highly mobile mass-like
structures which also appear to be attached to the pacemaker
lead and are in close proximity to the inferior vena cava. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular free wall motion is normal. A homograft aortic valve
is present with three aortic valve leaflets. There is a
moderate-sized (1.6 x 0.6 cm) vegetation on the right coronary
cusp of the aortic valve. The vegetation prolapses into the left
ventricular outflow tract in diastole. The aortic root is
circumferentially markedly thickened with areas of echolucency
which appears consistent with abscess (versus less likely post
surgical changes from prior known aortic root replacement). At
least moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The severity
of regurgitation may be underestimated due to shadowing (clip
[**Clip Number (Radiology) **]). The mitral valve appears structurally with mild mitral
regurgitation. No mitral vegetation or mass is seen.
CT Head [**2201-2-10**]: No acute intracranial process.
[**2201-2-10**] CT chest/abd/pelvis:
1. Soft tissue density at the anterior aspect of the base of the
aortic root may correspond to valvular vegetation seen on recent
TEE. However, without cardiac gating, CT evaluation is limited
by cardiac motion.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions, and moderate bibasilar
atelectasis,
left greater than right.
3. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
[**2-12**] Carotid U/S: Normal carotid study.
[**2-13**] Bone Scan: Radiotracer uptake predominantly at the medial
aspect of the first metatarsopalangeal joint is non-specific.
[**2-16**] TTE: Compared with the TEE study (images reviewed) of
[**2201-2-10**], the overall findings are similar.
[**2201-2-17**] CT chest:
1. Left lower lobe consolidation associated with small amount of
left pleural effusion.
2. Unchanged appearance of enlarged mediastinal and right hilar
lymph nodes.
3. Mild cardiomegaly.
4. Gallstones.
[**2201-2-18**] Arterial Peripheral Study:
IMPRESSION: No significant peripheral [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] disease
bilaterally at rest.

[**2-20**] TEE: Compared with the findings of the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2201-2-10**], the mass on the pacer wire is bigger and
possibly attaching to the tricuspid valve. The smaller masses
previously associated to the SVC portion of the pacer wire are
no longer seen. The aorti
