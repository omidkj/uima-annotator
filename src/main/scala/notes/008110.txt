History of Present Illness:
53 year old male with AML day +354 s/p myeloablative sequential
unrelated double cord blood transplant presenting to the
outpatient 7F clinic with generalized body aches and painful
toes. Mr. [**Known lastname 39623**] has had several admissions over the last
several weeks. He was admitted from [**Date range (1) 39630**]/08 with a right
lower extremity rash and was treated for cellulitis. He was
treated with vancomycin and cefepime until [**10-12**] and then
transitioned to clindamycin/ciprofloxacin to complete a course
on [**2184-10-26**]. He was seen by Podiatry on that hospitalization,
who did not feel that his toes were the source of infection.
.
He was hospitalized again from [**Date range (3) 39631**] for fevers and
back pain and had a long/complicated course including,
hypotension/sepsis, fevers, respiratory distress,
Stenotrophomonas bacteremia, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia,
diffuse joint pains, infected ingrown toenail and decreased EF
on echocardiogram. He completed 11 days of a 14 day course of
high dose bactrim, stopped due to renal failure, persistent
hyperkalemia and joint pains. He was feeling well on the day of
discharge without specific complaint. He was discharged to
complete a 7 day course of Augmentin for the infection related
to his ingrown toenail.
.
He presents to the 7F outpatient clinic today complaining of
diffuse joint/generalized body aches and painful toes. Reports
all joints are painful, and particularly shoulders, hips,
elbows, and knees bilaterally. Joint pain is chronic, although
this is worse than he has ever experienced. Improvement with
oxycodone, worsened when climbing stairs. Toe pain present from
last hospital stay. Large toes bilaterally and spreading
laterally with erythema, pain, and bleeding.
.
Of note, his creatinine remains elevated from baseline, but
improved from the last hospitalization. He also has
leukocytosis, elevated potassium, and stable thrombocytopenia.
.
On review of systems, also complains of general fatigue
worsening since discharge. Febrile to 100.3 two days prior to
admission that resolved without intervention. Denies dyspnea.
Home oxygen requirement unchanged - 1.5L NC when sleeping, 3L NC
walking. Slight dysuria, now resolved. Denies chest pain,
abdominal pain. Bowel movements daily.

Brief Hospital Course:
53 year old male day diffuse joint pain and painful toes;
recently hospitalized with hypoxic repiratory failure and found
to have stentotrophomonas bacteremia.
.
1. Toe pain - Presented with history of chronic in-grown toe
nails. s/p toe nail biopsy at previous hospitalization. Wound
culture with coag positive Staph aureus. At previous
hospitalization, was initially treated with vancomycin (2
doses), then given at discharge 5 day course of Augmentin. On
admission for present hospitalization, vancomycin IV was
started. Podiatry was also consulted; excisional debridement of
left first toe was performed. Pain and erythema improved
considerably on IV antibiotics. On discharge, patient was
provided information to arrange follow-up with podiatry in one
week. A PICC line was also placed to allow the patient to
complete additional 7 day course of vancomycin IV.
.
2. Stenotrophomonas bactermia - Patient did not complete
antibiotic course for Stenotrophomonas bacteremia at last
infection secondary to renal failure and hyperkalemia which was
thought to be due to Bactrim. Received 12 of 14 day course.
Stenotrophomonas sensitivities from previous hospitalization
show sensitivity to Bactrim and ceftazidime. On admission,
patient was restarted on ceftazidime based on the possibility
that his diffuse arthralgias may be due to a systemic infection.
Blood cultures were no growth to date. Ultrasound at former
central line site was ultrasounded to assess for abscess - no
abscess or clot was seen. Given patient's improvement on
steroids (as explained below), ceftazidime was stopped prior to
discharge.
.
3. Diffuse arthralgias/myalgias - Has history of aspergillosis,
which can in itself cause severe muscle aches. Has been on
voriconazole. Differential diagnosis on presentation also
included GVH, ava
