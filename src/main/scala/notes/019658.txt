.
[**2102-6-17**] ECG: Sinus rhythm. Left bundle-branch block. Compared to
the previous tracing of [**2098-6-3**] no diagnostic change.
.
[**2102-6-21**] ECG: Sinus rhythm with atrial ectopic activity versus
atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Left bundle
branch block
Possible inferior infarct - age undetermined. Lateral ST
elevation, CONSIDER ACUTE INFARCT. Since previous tracing of
[**2102-6-20**], the heart rate is faster, irregular rhythm, atrial
ectopic activity or atrial fibrillation now present.
Clinical correlation is suggested.
.
[**2102-6-22**] ECG: Sinus rhythm. Left bundle-branch block. Compared
to the previous tracing of [**2102-6-22**] the rhythm is now sinus.
.
[**2102-6-17**] CXR: No acute pulmonary process.
.
[**2102-6-19**] CXR: Bilateral infrahilar opacification, left greater
than right, which has worsened since [**6-17**] is stable since
[**6-18**], probably atelectasis, conceivably aspiration. Upper
lungs clear. Heart size normal. No pulmonary edema. No
appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Left jugular line
tip projects over the junction of the brachiocephalic veins.
Nasogastric tube ends in the upper stomach. Heart size top
normal.
.
[**2102-6-22**] CXR: Lung volumes are lower. Cardiomediastinal
silhouette is unchanged. Bilateral bibasal opacities greater on
the left side have increased on the left probably due to
atelectasis and or aspiration. There is no pneumothorax. The
left IJ catheter remains in place. NG tube has been removed.
.
[**2102-6-22**] CXR: Right PICC terminates in the mid SVC. Minimally
increased right upper lung opacity may represent evolving
infectious process or increasing atelectasis. Otherwise little
change since [**05**] hours prior.
.
[**2102-6-19**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The interatrial
septum is aneurysmal. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is moderate to severe regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the
distal 2/3rds of the ventricle (LVEF 25%). No aneurysm or
thrombus is seen. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal left vevntricular
cavity size with extensive regional systolic dysfunction c/w
multivessel CAD. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2097-1-7**], the severity of mitral regurgitation
and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure have
increased. Left ventricular systolic function is similar.
.
[**2102-6-18**] Liver/Gallbladder U/S: 1. Gallbladder filled with
sludge and stones with moderate wall thickening. The findings
are equivocal for acute cholecystitis and if there is continued
concern, consider HIDA scan for further evaluation. 2. Echogenic
liver consistent with fatty infiltration. However, other forms
of liver disease and more advanced liver disease (ie hepatic
fibrosis/cirrhosis) are not excluded.
.
[**2102-6-20**] Liver/Gallbladder U/S: 1. Mildly improved appearance of
the gallbladder, containing sludge, with mild wall thickening.
No specific sign of cholecystitis or biliary dilatation.
2. Increased hepatic echogenicity as previously seen.
3. Right pleural effusion.
.
LFT TREND:


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 88 yo M admitted for abdominal pain and hypotension,
transferred to the unit for evaluation of new UGI bleed in
setting of anticoagulation.

# Hypotension/Shock. Felt initially to be hypovolemia in setting
of GIB and poor po intake. He received IVF and blood (4 units
total) and hcts remained stable. Patient also with poor CO (EF
25%) and some concern for cardiogenic shock so IVF given
conservatively after initial boluses in ED. Patient then
developed rapid AF and had MAPs in 40s. He was started on
neosynephrine with good result. Digoxin was started as below and
when patient remained in NSR BPs were in 110s/60s and the neo
was turned off.  In the setting of the hypotension he did
develop ARF and ALF as noted below. After initiation of CVVH,
hypotension continued and mental status deteriorated. Goals of
care were transitioned to comfort measures after discussion with
his family and he died less than 24 hours after CVVH was
discontinued. Family and PCP were notified. Family declined
autopsy.

# Coffee ground emesis - Thought likely upper GI source in
setting of therapeutic INR, ddx included PUD, ASA-induced
gastritis, malignancy. Gi was consulted and wanted to perform
EGD when I
