Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2745**]
Chief Complaint:
lightheadedness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
86 year old male with pmh significant for DM, HL, HTN, CAD s/p
distant IMI (no prior cath), and systolic congestive heart
failure with EF of 40-45%, who presented to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital on
[**3-16**] with chest pain x 2 weeks. EKG showed ST depressions and pt
ruled in for NSTEMI via biomarkers. Patient was managed
medically, but on [**3-18**], the patient experienced had sudden onset
lightheadedness, hr 30. Thought to be a vagal episode, but had
new T wave inversions in V3-V6, so was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
cath. Of note, the patient did have an episode of agitation
while at [**Hospital3 **]. Head CT at the time was negative.
.
Patient arrived at [**Hospital1 18**], Vitals 58, 118/62, 15, 100%2L. He
underwent catheterization where he was found to have diffuse
disease including 90% proximal RCA stenosis. He received a BMS
to the RCA as well as stents to both common and external iliac
arteries. After the procedure the patient became agitated,
pulling at lines, pulling out his right femoral sheath, and
tried to get up from the table. Vitals were HR 68, SBP 140,
O2sat 99% RA. He was sedated with haldol 2.5mg IV X1 and
transferred to the CCU for closer monitoring.
.
In the CCU he remained agitated. His left femoral sheath was
pulled two hours after arrival. The patient was sedated with
zydis, haldol 5mg IV, morphine 2mg IV X1, and physical
restraints. A geriatrics c/s was called. Workup for infectious,
organic etiology negative. Pt's mental status improved slowly.
Creatinine bumped to max of 2.8 from baseline 2.0, attributed to
CIN, given gentle IVF.
.
Upon transfer to the floor, he is in good spirits and surrounded
by family. He has no complaints.

[**2148-3-18**] EKG
Sinus bradycardia. A-V conduction delay. Left ventricular
hypertrophy.
Left anterior fascicular block. T wave inversions in leads I,
aVL and V3-V6 with ST segment depressions. These findings are
consistent with active
anterolateral ischemic process. Rule out myocardial infarction.
Followup and clinical correlation are suggested. No previous
tracing available for
comparison.
.
[**3-18**] CARDIAC CATH
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Anomalous origin of LCX from right coronary cusp.
3. Diastolic LV dysfunction.
4. Bilateral common iliac artery disease.
5. Successful PCI/stent to proximal RCA with bare metal stent.
6. Successful PTA/stent to right common iliac.
7. Successful PTA/stent to left common iliac.
.
[**2148-3-18**] EKG #2
Sinus rhythm. The previously mentioned multiple abnormalities
persist.
The T wave inversions previously recorded on [**2148-3-18**] have
improved.
Otherwise, no diagnostic interim change. Clinical correlation is
suggested
.
[**3-19**] R GROIN U/S
IMPRESSION: No evidence of right groin pseudoaneurysm, AV
fistula or dissection
.
[**3-19**] CXR
FINDINGS: No previous images. There is enlargement of the
cardiac silhouette with tortuosity of the aorta. Some plethora
of ill-defined pulmonary markings is consistent with elevated
pulmonary venous pressure. Blunting of the left costophrenic
angle could reflect pleural effusion or thickening. No evidence
of acute pneumonia.
.
[**2148-3-21**] EKG
Sinus rhythm. First degree A-V delay. Consider left atrial
abnormality
Right bundle branch block. Left anterior fascicular block. Q-Tc
interval appears prolonged but is difficult to measure. ST-T
wave abnormalities - are in part primary and are nonspecific.
Since previous tracing of [**2148-3-20**], no significant change.
.
[**2148-3-23**] EKG
Sinus rhythm. P-R interval prolongation. Left atrial
abnormality. Left
anterior fascicular block of right bundle-branch block type. Q-T
interval
prolongation. ST-T wave abnormalities. Since the previous
tracing of [**2148-3-22**] probably no significant change.
.
[**2148-3-26**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
FINDINGS: No edema, masses, mass effect, hemorrhage, or
infarction is detected. The ventricles and the sulci are mildly
prominent consistent with involutional changes. The left
maxillary sinus contains a small amount of fluid. The remainder
of the visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are
clear. Note is made of calcification of the cavernous portion of
both carotid arteries.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathology including no
hemorrhage.
.
[**3-26**] CXR (PA+lat)
IMPRESSION:
1. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
2. Left lower lobe atelectasis and a small effusion that could
be followed up in future chest radiographs
.
[**3-26**] RENAL U.S.
IMPRESSION: Small renal size bilaterally with no hydronephrosis
identified
.
[**3-28**] CXR
As compared to the previous radiograph, there is slight
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. In a generalized manner,
moderate-to-severe reticular opacities are seen, mainly in the
periphery of the lung, these are suggestive for fluid overload.
This suggestion is supported by the bilateral perihilar haziness
and the slight increase in diameter of the apical pulmonary
vessels. There is no evidence of larger pleural effusions, no
focal parenchymal opacity suggestive of pneumonia are seen.
.
[**3-29**] EEG
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG in the waking and
drowsy
states due to intermittent bursts of moderate amplitude theta
frequency
slowing in the left temporal region, suggestive of an underlying
area of
subcortical dysfunction. The tracing cannot specify the
etiology, but
vascular disease would be a common cause
