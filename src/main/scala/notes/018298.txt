Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left IJ hemodialysis catheter placement
Right IJ central line placement

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 72 year old male with a history of CAD s/p CABG
x 2, CHF EF 20%, AFIB, DM2 who presented on [**2139-4-5**] with
worsening DOE x 4 weeks, cough, and increased LE edema. Pt
reports that 4 weeks prior to presentation, he would be able to
climb 10 steps and walk [**1-28**] mile w/o dyspnea - DOE has slowly
progressed such that today not able to walk 20 feet w/o dyspnea.
Denies dyspnea at rest. Pt also states that he had noticed
increased LE edema over past 4 weeks before admission. Finally,
he states he has had a cough productive of white sputum x 4
weeks; worse at night and interferes w/ his ability to sleep.
On presentation, the patient denied any CP, but stated that one
week prior he felt non-radiating sharp substernal CP after
climbing 1 flight of stairs. +dyspnea -diaphoresis, -N/V. He has
been prescribed SL NTG in past, but never has needed it - during
this episode, however, he wished he had it at the time. CP
dissipated after resting for 10 minutes and did not recur.

Does not actively monitor salt intake. Has increased fluid
intake (2-3 L/day now) b/c of sensation of dry mouth when wakes
up. General malaise has resulted in missing some medication
doses. Pt's PCP was going to start him on digoxin for his AF but
the prescription has not been filled b/c of dosing error
(prescribed 0.1 mg every other day). Has been taking tylenol (2
tabs 2-3 times daily) for generally unwell feeling. Has been
seen multiple times by PCP for worsening DOE. Work-up included
CXR ([**3-31**] - no evidence CHF, no infiltrate), echo (EF 20%) and
blood cx to r/o endocarditis (pending).

ROS: + rhinorrhea, decreased appetite. +wt gain, but not sure
how much. Denies orthopnea, PND (but sleeps w/ two pillows for
GERD), fevers, chills, night sweats, change in bowel or bladder
habits, BRBPR, melena, hematuria, visual changes, weakness in
arms or legs. pain in L shoulder w/ movement (longstanding
problem)

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2139-4-5**] 1:28 PM
SEMI-UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Patient is status post median
sternotomy and CABG. The heart is at the upper limits of normal
size. In the interval, there has been upper zone vascular
redistribution, vascular engorgement, and perihilar haziness,
findings all consistent with mild congestive heart failure. The
costophrenic angle is excluded from this study. Small left
pleural effusion is likely present. There is no pneumothorax.
Osseous structures are unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Mild congestive heart failure. Probable small left
pleural effusion.

UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS LEFT  [**2139-4-5**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of
DVT.

Other Studies:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2139-4-13**] 7:10 AM
1. Slightly improving interstitial pulmonary edema.
2. Swan-Ganz catheter terminates in the right upper lobar
artery.

RENAL U.S.  [**2139-4-9**] 9:55 AM
IMPRESSION: Diminished intrarenal arterial diastolic flow
suggesting chronic small vessel disease. Otherwise, normal renal
ultrasound with no hydronephrosis or evidence for renal artery
stenosis.

ESOPHAGUS  [**2139-4-16**] 3:08 PM
During the initial swallows, there was no evidence of
aspiration. However, after consecutive sips of thick dye and the
patient aspirated a small amount. The cough was partially
effective in clearing the aspirated barium.
The motility of the esophagus appears satisfactory. In the
anterior aspect of the distal third of the esophagus there is
some irregularity which was incompletely evaluated in this
study. This should be further evaluated when the patient comes
down tomorrow for a video swallow.
IMPRESSION:
1. Mild aspiration during the study. Recommend evaluation by the
speech and swallow therapist with a video swallow fluoroscopy.
REPEAT BARIUM SWALLOW [**4-17**]:
IMPRESSION: Extrinsic compression upon anterior distal
esophagus. If there
is further clinical concern recommend followup CT exam.

VIDEO SWALLOW: mildly reduced oral control and mild pharyngeal
residue in the valleculae with all consistencies. Pt also had
trace penetration before the swallow with both thin and nectar
thick liquids, but he completely cleared the penetration and no
aspiration was seen during this study. Based on this study, pt
is safe for thin liquids and regular consistency solids. Pt will
need to perform repeat swallows as needed to clear the
pharyngeal residue which he is sensate to, and often coughs in
response to. Spontaneous coughs during this evaluation were
never due to
aspiration.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. suggest pt continue with a PO diet of thin liquids and
regular
consistency solids.
2. Pills whole with thin liquids.
3. Continue with esophageal work- up, especially for reflux, as
many of the pt's symptoms may coincide with reflux.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2139-4-17**] 9:04 PM:
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is a left internal
jugular line terminating in the distal SVC. There are extensive
vascular calcifications. There are multiple small mediastinal
lymph nodes. There are multifocal patchy areas of consolidation
in the right upper lobe, left upper lobe, right middle lobe, and
bilateral lower lobes. There is a focal area of calcification at
the dome of the liver. There is
