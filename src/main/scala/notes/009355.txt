Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 465**]
Chief Complaint:
Right heel osteomyelitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Partial debridement of right heel osteomyelitis
Hemodialysis

History of Present Illness:
This is a 53 year-old male with end stage renal disease, insulin
dependent diabetes, coronary artery disease, congestive heart
failure, and right heel chronic osteomyeltis who was admitted to
an outside hospital on [**2131-2-10**] with fevers and weakness.  A wound
culture of his right heel grew out MRSA, providencia stuartii,
and e. coli.  He also had a MRSA bacteremia that has
subsequently cleared.  He was treated with vancomycin and
ertapenem.  He had a transesophageal echocardiogram that showed
no vegetations and no involvement of his pacer leads.  He also
had a tagged white cell scan that only showed enhancement at the
right heel.  He was transfered to the [**Hospital1 18**] for surgical
debridement of his right heel osteomyelitis.
.
At this time, he states that he continues to have some fevers
with chills although they are less than previously.  He denies
any pain in his right heel as he has no sensation in either
foot.  He denies shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal
pain, fatigue, weakness, diarrhea, or urinary symptoms.

Past Medical History:
1. Chronic osteomyelitis in his right foot for 18 months
complicated by MRSA bacteremia.
2. Status post skin graft to left heel in [**2126**] for ulcer.
3. Congestive heart failure with an EF of 60%
4. Coronary artery disease status post 2 stent placements
5. Status post pacemaker placement
6. Insulin dependent diabetes diagnosed at age 37, complicated
by neuropathy and retinopathy
7. Peripheral vascular disease status post bilateral lower
extremity bypass grafts
8. Hypertension
9. Hypercholesterolemia
10. End stage renal disease on hemodialysis
11. GERD
12. Constipation
13. Depression
14. Insomnia


Social History:
He lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] doesn't smoke or drink.

Family History:
There is a history of diabetes.  His mother is on hemodialysis.

RADIOLOGY
[**2131-2-24**]
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
53 year old man with right heel osteo
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate for other bone involvement
INDICATION: History of right heel osteomyelitis, evaluate for
bone involvement.

COMPARISONS: [**2130-6-29**].

RIGHT FOOT THREE VIEWS:

Again seen is a fracture through the proximal third of the
calcaneus with sclerotic margins. There is evidence of
destruction, osseous debris, and sclerosis in the region of the
calcaneus. There has been interval development of a large soft
tissue defect on the plantar aspect of the heel. Again seen is
diffuse osteopenia and vascular calcifications.

IMPRESSION: Old non-united fracture of the anterior calcaneus
with sclerotic margins and evidence of osseous debris and
destruction. Chronic infection could have a similar appearance.
.
[**2131-3-12**]
ECHO
Conclusions:
Pacemaker wire is identified in the RA/RV. There is a large (>3
cm long),
highly mobile echodense mass(es) associated with the RV pacing
lead. The mass  is adherent to the pacing lead in multiple loci,
and extends from the high  right atrium, along the lead, to the
tricuspid valve. The mass may also  involve the tricuspid valve.
The mass likely represents avegetation, although  the
differential diagnosis includes a lead-associated thrombus. No
atrial  septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function
are normal. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly  thickened. No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mass
or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is  seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is a small  circumferential pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Large mass/vegetation on the right ventricular
pacing lead. Mild
tricuspid regurgitation. Small pericardial effusion.

[**2131-3-15**]
CHEST PA & L
IMPRESSION:
1) Pacing lead terminates in right ventricle with no
pneumothorax.
2) Patchy posterior basilar right lower lobe opacity which may
relate to atelectasis, aspiration or evolving pneumonia. Follow
up radiographs may be helpful.
