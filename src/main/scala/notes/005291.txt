Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the general surgery team with a partial
small bowel obstruction. Initially, there had been a report of
some coffee ground emesis which was not witnessed. A Hct was
checked and remained stable. A GI consult was called. He was
kept NPO with an NGT in place. Serial abdominal exams were
performed. An endoscopy was not performed secondary to the
partial small bowel obstruction and the risk of perforation. The
patient was closely monitored with serial KUB's which remained
stable. Clinically, his abdomen remained soft and nontender and
his hematocrit remained stable. He did demonstrate persistent
asymptomatic tachycardia during his first days in the hospital
which could not be controlled with metoprolol. He was started on
a diltiazem drip and then eventually transitioned to po digoxin
with good control of his heart rate.
His NGT was discontinued and he was slowly advanced on a diet
which he tolerated well. He was tolerating a regular diet, and
remained hemodynamically stable and was discharged to rehab on
HD9 in stable condition.
