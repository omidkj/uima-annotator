History of Present Illness:
39 year old female transfered from [**Hospital3 **] s/p cardiac
arrest. The patient used heroin, possibly cocaine, and possibly
benzodiazepines last night and was altered, but her boyfriend
did not do anything until this morning when she was
unresponsive. At [**Hospital1 **], she was altered and had some
improvement with naloxone. After a period of observation, she
became unresponsive, had a wide complex tachycardia and no
pulse. She was intubated with propofol and vecuronium. She
recevived bicarb and epinephrine. Labs came back with a
potassium of 7.4 so she was given insulin/D50 and calcium. After
brief CPR, she regained pulses. She was persistently hypotensive
so a right femoral CVL was placed and phenylephrine gtt started
along with bicarb gtt. She was on propofol for sedation and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. At [**Hospital1 **] she revieved 3L NS.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, after transferring from EMS stretcher no pulse
was felt. CPR was initiated and one 2 minute cycle was
perfromed, epinephrine, calcium, bicarb all were all given once.
Regained pulses. ETT confirmed w/ CXR and ETCO2. A left femoral
a-line was placed (not sterile). She was then tranferred to the
MICU for futher management.

On arrival to the MICU, Vitals were Temp: 99, HR: 98, BP: 126/67
RR: 28 O2: 100%. Vent settings were AC Tv: 450 RR: 24 PEEP: 5.
She was non-responsive and the artic sun protocol was initiated.
Her left and right femoral lines were removed and a left CVL was
placed as was a left arterial line.

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:

EEG [**2109-6-30**]
This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations. The EEG
background showed the slow cortical activity and bursts of
generalized slowing throughout indicative of severe diffuse
encephalopathy. It did not change appreciably over the course of
the recording. Compared with the recording yesterday, the
background was slightly slower which might be due to medication
adjustment. There were no clearly epileptiform features, and
there were no electrographic seizures.

CT Head [**2109-6-30**]
FINDINGS:  There are EEG electrodes in place. There is no
evidence of acute hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or recent
infarction.  The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and
configuration.  No concerning osseous lesion is seen.
Fluid-opacification of the nasopharynx and nasal cavity, with
layering fluid in the sphenoid and ethmoidal air cells and
maxillary sinuses, likely relates to intubation and supine
positioning.

IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.  If
there is
concern for acute hypoxic-ischemic injury, MRI would be more
sensitive.

NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: There is some loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
matter
differentiation, diffusely, concerning for cerebral edema, in
this context.

CT Chest [**2109-6-30**]
FINDINGS:  Evaluation is slightly limited in the absence of
intravenous
contrast; however, the mediastinal vessels appear normal in
caliber.  There is no pericardial effusion.  There are
widespread extensive areas of consolidation and atelectasis
extending from the hila bilaterally towards the bases.  As seen
on coronal images, these consolidations superimpose on the
mediastinum and likely contribute to the apparent mediastinal
widening seen on the prior radiograph, which also relates partly
to vascular prominence and  mediastinal fat.  No pneumothorax is
present.  No significant pleural effusion is seen.  An
endotracheal tube is in place with tip in the distal trachea.
An esophageal catheter courses inferior to the diaphragm.

No concerning osseous lesion is seen.  Limited views of the
upper abdomen
demonstrate coiling of esophageal catheter within the stomach,
though the
entire course is not visualized.  Otherwise, no upper abdominal
abnormality is seen.

IMPRESSION:  No evidence of mediastinal vascular injury.
Extensive bilateral consolidations extending from the hila
consistent with aspiration pneumonia.

CXR [**2109-6-30**]
The left internal jugular central line has been repositioned so
that its tip now lies in the proximal SVC.  The endotracheal
tube, nasogastric tube and right internal jugular dual-lumen
catheter are unchanged in position.  The diffuse airspace
process appears to have somewhat cleared, although there is a
persistent opacity throughout both lungs and therefore this
would favor resolving pulmonary edema rather than diffuse
pneumonia or ARDS.  Stable overall cardiac and mediastinal
contours.  No pneumothorax.  Probable small bilateral layering
effusions.

Echocardiogram [**2109-7-1**]
Conclusions
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal
diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
global biventricular systolic function. No valvular pathology or
pathologic flow identified.
