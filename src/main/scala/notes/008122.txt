Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3619**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
80 yo F with a new diagnosis small cell lung cancer on
chemotherapy less than 24 hours, transferred to the ICU with
progressive hypoxia.
.
ICU evaluation was requested for hypoxia. The patient arrived
last night saturating well on 6L NC. This morning she was noted
on routine vitals to be saturating at 83% on 6L. She responded
to 91-95% on a non-rebreather. The patient denies any new
symptoms. She denies chest pain or shortness of breath. She does
note a non-productive cough for several hours. The patient had a
CXR which did not reveal a clear etiology of her hypoxia. ABG
was 7.37/51/64. She received 10mg IV furosemide given that she
likely had a positive fluid balance not well recorded since
admission. Due to persistent hypoxia she is transferred to the
ICU.
.
The patient was originally transferred from [**Hospital6 17390**] ICU with a new diagnosis small cell lung cancer. She
presented initially with complaints of abdominal pain, dysphagia
and generally not feeling well. She underwent an outpatient
work-up including normal nuclear stress test and CT abd/pelvis
with mesenteric lymphadenopathy. On [**2164-3-8**] she was admitted to
a hospital in [**Location (un) 78617**], FL for laparoscopic biopsy of a
mesenteric node, cecal mass and omentum. Biopsy was reactive and
benign. She returned to her PCP with complaints of persistent
weight loss and weakness. She was admitted to [**Hospital1 16549**] and on [**2164-4-30**] underwent an excisional biopsy
of a right axillary lymph node which confirmed high grade small
cell lung cancer. She was found on staging to have liver mets
and peribronchial lymphadenopathy. CTA at [**Hospital6 **]
revealed right lower lobe bronchus compression with right lower
lobe collapse, diffuse lymphadenopathy, small bilateral pleural
effusions and by verbal report to have invasion of the SVC with
associated SVC thrombus.
.
The patient was transferred from [**Hospital6 2910**]
last night for emergent chemotherapy. She received cis-platinum
and etoposide with steroids.
.
ROS: Patient denies any complaints and cannot clearly recall the
symptoms that brought her in to the hospital. She denies fevers,
chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain, dysuria, diarrhea, rashes, arthralgias or any
other concerning symptoms.

CT [**2164-5-18**] IMPRESSION:
1. Widespread lymphadenopathy in the mediastinum, right hilum,
right
supraclavicular region and upper abdomen, in keeping with the
history of small cell lung cancer. Left adrenal and likely
widespread hepatic metastases.
2. Superior vena cava is mildly compressed by the right
paratracheal lymph nodes but appears patent.
3. Moderate right and small left dependent pleural effusions.
4. Two indeterminate right breast lesions, the largest measuring
2.2 cm in diameter. In the absence of intervention in this
region, a primary breast cancer should be considered for the
dominant lesion, although differential diagnosis includes
inflammatory and infectious etiologies as well as a metastatic
focus.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Lung Cancer: Ms. [**Known lastname 9241**] [**Known lastname **] was transferred from the NEBH
ICU for urgent chemotherapy. She began cisplatinum and etoposide
on the evening of admission. The following morning, she was
increasingly hypoxic to 83% on NC 6L. She was transfered to the
ICU. Her respiratory compromise was felt most likely due to
airway and vasculature compression/obstruction from tumor burden
as seen on recent CTA at the OSH. PE was felt possible though
not likely given recent CTA that was negative. The patient also
probably had a component of volume overload as seen on CXR and
consistent with a recent history of volume rescucitation. Of
note she likely has a contribution of compression from pleural
effusions though this was felt not likely to be the primary
force causing hypoxia. The patient was started on chemotherapy
with the goal of reducing tumor burden. She received 3 days of
cisplatinum and etoposide. Radiation oncology was consulted for
consideration of palliative XRT. Unfortunately the patient was
not able to lie flat in bed and therefore could not receive
radiation. If her respiratory status improves and she is able to
lie flat, then she could be an XRT candidate in the future. In
addition, the patient was diuresed as much as possible though
she required fluid boluses with chemotherapy administration and
therefore was only negative 1.6L during her stay in the ICU. She
also continued to receive nebulizer treatments. Her oxygenation
did improve somewhat and the patient left the ICU on 15L 40%
high flow mask. The patient and her family clearly wished for
the patient to be DNR/DNI with palliative therapy as possible.
On the floor, she was further diuresed. Her oxygen was weaned
down and her respiratory status improved.  She was reimaged on
[**2164-5-18**] and in comparison to previous CT scan showed 40-50%
reduction in tumor burden post-chemotherapy. A decision was made
to initiate a second cycle of chemotherapy with 3 days of
etoposide and cisplatinin which she tolerated without
difficulty. A repeat CT scan on day #14 after this chemotherapy
showed regression o
