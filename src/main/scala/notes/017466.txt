Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Motrin / Chlorhexidine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1377**]
Chief Complaint:
hepatic hydrothorax with bloody thoracentesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2158-8-4**]:  Right video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery
evacuation of hemothorax, removal of clotted hemothorax, talc
pleurodesis.


History of Present Illness:
53 yoM with HCV and ETOH related
cirrhosis (Childs Class C) on [**Month/Day/Year **] list complicated by
chronic hydrothorax (always on right) requiring thoracentesis
throughout past year, ascites, PVT, hepatic encephalopathy,
grade
1 varices, and h/o SBP. Over the past few months he has been
needing biweekly taps. He reports that the amount of fluid taken
out has decreased per tap from initially 5-6l now down to 2-3L.
He was tapped on [**2158-8-1**] for 1.3L. There is no history of
infection related to the thoracentesis and per patient he has
never had talc/pleurodesis. Over past week his taps have been
showing signs of blood and so he was admitted for evaluation by
thoracic surgery for possible chest tube placement with
talc/pleurodesis.

He has required frequent banding for esophageal varices and has
failed TIPs procedure in past. He was started on Cipro PPX after
admission for SBP in 3/[**2157**].

He has recent PNA now s/p azithromycin course with residual
cough
but SOB, CP, fevers/chills. States that he has been gaining
weight over the past few months.

 In brief, this is a 53yo M PMHx HCV cirrhosis c/b
encephalopathy, varices, SBP, portal vein thrombus, ascites w
recurrent hepatic hydrothorax, hypervolemic hyponatremia (on
tolvaptan), initially presenting after patient had bloody
thoracenteses, with patient remaining hemodynamically stable w
unchanged Hct; hospital course notable for R chest tube
placement and pleurodesis by Thoracic Surgery on hospital day 3;
prior to undergoing chest tube placement, patient developed
whole body [**Year (4 digits) **], blanching, maculopapular, thought to be
allergic reaction to chlorhexadine wash.  Over 12 hours after
chest tube placement and pleurodesis, patient had 400cc
serosanguinous output; UOP fell overnight to <10cc/hour; HR
increased from 70s to 150s, SBPs 130s to 90s, and patient
developed new O2 requirement (initially on room air, slowly
escalating to 4L then nonrebreather).  CXR did not demonstrate
signs of PTX or new infection; given worsening symptoms, patient
transferred to MICU for further management.

Imaging:
[**8-1**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Slight increase in size of
small-to-moderate right pleural effusion.

[**8-5**] TTE (PRELIM): IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular function. No
echocardiographic evidence of PE, though is not definitive test
for evaluation of pulmonary embolism.

[**8-5**] CXR: There is a small right apical pneumothorax. There is a
right-sided chest tube with distal lead tip in the right apex
and the second chest tube at the right base. There has been
decreased size of the right small pleural effusion. There is
coarsening of the bronchovascular markings without signs for
overt pulmonary edema. Atelectasis at the right lung base is
seen. Cardiac silhouette and mediastinum are grossly within
normal limits.

[**8-6**] CXR: FINDINGS: There is a right-sided chest tube with tip
in the apex. There is no pneumothoraces. There is a right-sided
pleural effusion with some loculation along the right chest
wall. This is stable. Heart size is stable.There is improvement
of pulmonary vascular marking and congestion. There is some
atelectasis versus developing infiltrates at the lung bases,
which are stable. The right IJ central venous catheter has the
distal lead tip in the proximal right atrium.

abd US
Limited four-quadrant ultrasound of the abdomen demonstrates a
trace amount of
ascites in the perihepatic and perisplenic regions. Given the
trace ascites
and the patient's elevated INR, this was deemed unsafe for a
diagnostic/therapeutic paracentesis.

[**2158-8-10**]
CXR PA and Lat
IMPRESSION:
1. No pneumothorax after chest tube removal.
2. Persistent small bilateral pleural effusions.
