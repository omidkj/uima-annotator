Imaging upon admission:
Right acetabular fracture with loose intraarticular fragment,
widened pubic symphsis and left SI joint

Left L3-5 TP fracture, T7-10 SP fracture, right ribs [**8-5**]
fracture

Right second metatarsal fracture

Left closed comminuted femur fracture

MR [**Name13 (STitle) 30171**] [**2170-9-25**]

IMPRESSION:

1. Edema in the infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis
muscles. This could be related to trauma, especially given the
history. If symptoms
persist, repeat noncontrast MRI in approximately 2-3 months is
suggested to evaluate for other causes of muscular edema.

2. Partial thickness intrasubstance tear of the infraspinatus at
the
myotendinous junction. No full-thickness rotator cuff tears.



Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Trauma service. Orthopedics was consulted
and he was taken to the operating room for intramedullary nail
left femur and closed treatment of pelvic ring fracture with
manipulation. His metatarsal fracture was managed non
operatively.

On [**9-19**] he was noted with tachypnea/dyspnea and drop in his
hematocrit; a CTA of his chest was done which was positive for
PE. He was started on a heparin drip and transferred to the
Trauma ICU. He was later started on Coumadin and the Heparin
drip was stopped. His last INR on [**10-3**] was 2.7 (Goal INR [**2-27**]). He
required multiple blood transfusions during his hospital course
due to acute blood loss from his injuries. His last hematocrit
was 25 on [**2170-9-30**].

On [**9-27**] he was taken back to the operating room by Orthopedics
for open reduction and internal fixation, unstable ring, with
orthogonal plate; an IVC filter was placed at that time by
Trauma surgery. He was noted to complain of left shoulder pain
and underwent an MRI which showed a partial thickness
intrasubstance tear of the infraspinatus at the myotendinous
junction and no full-thickness rotator cuff tears. This will be
re-evaluated at his follow up orthopedic appointment.

He was eventually transferred back to the regular nursing unit.
His pain was controlled using IV narcotics initially and then he
was changed to oral narcotics prn with adequate control. He is
on an aggressive bowel regimen and is moving his bowels.

Physical and Occupational therapy were consulted and have
recommended rehab after his acute hospital stay.
