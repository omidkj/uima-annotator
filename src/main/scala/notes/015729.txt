HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 87-year-old black
female status post an unwitnessed fall on [**2184-7-18**]
at her residence in [**Location (un) 2716**] Point Baywood Unit.  The patient
was without the walker, which she is supposed to use.  She
denied lightheadedness, dizziness, palpitations, chest pain,
or loss of consciousness.  The patient stated that the left
leg and hip hurt when she moved it.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  History revealed several recent
hospitalization for urinary tract infection, fever of unknown
origin, and confusion; dementia; end-stage renal disease on
hemodialysis; coronary artery disease status post two
myocardial infarctions.

In the ED, the patient underwent a workup, which revealed an
elevated white blood cell and a urinalysis suggestive of a
UTI.  The patient was visited by the orthopedic surgery team,
which examined her and found her to have signs and symptoms
consistent with a left hip fracture.

X-ray of the hip and left femur revealed a left
intertrochanteric fracture of the femur.  The Orthopedic Team
consented her for an Oris [**Hospital **] Healthcare proxy, pending
medical clearance of urinary tract infection, increased white
blood cell count, increased coagulations, and evaluation of
cardiac status.  Throughout the ED stay, the patient denied
any fever, chills, diarrhea, constipation, urinary symptoms,
respiratory symptoms, GI symptoms, or sick contacts.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Diabetes mellitus type 2, not on insulin.
2.  End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
3.  Coronary artery disease with three-vessel disease and
myocardial infarction in [**2177**], and [**2182**].  Last echocardiogram
[**2184-5-1**] shows an ejection fraction of 45%.
4.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
5.  Peripheral vascular disease status post femoral/popliteal
bypass.
6.  GI bleeding secondary to arteriovenous malformation
[**2183-11-1**].
7.  Hypertension.
8.  Mitral regurgitation.
9.  Transient ischemic attacks.
10. Dementia.
11. Status post total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy.
12. Status post H. pylori infection, resolved.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is widowed; lives in [**Hospital3 93553**] Home in [**Location (un) **].  The patient denies current
alcohol, drug, or tobacco use, but admits to heavy tobacco
use in the past.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Senna q.h.s.
2.  ProMod t.i.d.
3.  Zoloft 50 q.a.m.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergies to NIFEDIPINE AND
PERCOCET.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the following:
Vital signs:  Temperature 96.5, heart rate 68, blood pressure
140/99, respiratory rate 22, oxygen saturation 99% on room
air.  GENERAL:  The patient was laying in bed in no apparent
distress.  HEENT:  EOMI, PERRLA, no oropharyngeal erythema,
moist mucous membranes, normocephalic, atraumatic.  NECK:  No

PULMONARY:  Left sided dialysis catheter in place on anterior
chest.  Mild bilateral bibasilar crackles on auscultation.
ABDOMEN:  Positive bowel sounds times four, soft, nontender,
and nondistended.  EXTREMITIES:  The patient was missing
several toes bilaterally secondary to amputation.  There was
no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Left leg is shorter than the
right leg.  There was tenderness to palpation over the left
groin.  VASCULAR:  Nonpalpable pulses bilaterally in the
lower extremities.

LABORATORY DATA:  Pertinent labs in the ED:  White blood cell
count 23.7, hematocrit 41.3, hematocrit 12.6, platelet count
290,000, MCV 78, 3+ hypochromia, 2+ microcytosis, sodium 142,
potassium 3.6, chloride 100, bicarbonate 26, BUN 22,
creatinine 4.1, glucose 171, anion gap 20, PT 13.4, INR 1.2,
PTT 45.5.  Urinalysis:  Brown, cloudy urine with a few
bacteria, large blood, nitrite positive, no yeast, 100
protein, no glucose or bilirubin, [**2-3**] epithelials cells,
urobilinogen of 1, pH 6, greater than 50 white cells,
moderate 21 to 50 red blood cells.

EKG:  Negative for acute changes.

CHEST X-RAY:  Negative for fracture or cardiopulmonary
disease.

CERVICAL SPINE FILMS:  Negative for fracture.

Films of the left hip revealed an intertrochanteric fracture
of the left femur.

CT of the spine revealed no fracture and left IJ catheter
site for peritoneal catheter.

CT of the head was negative for masses or bleeds.

Old echocardiogram taken [**2184-5-1**] revealed mild LVH, mildly
decreased systolic function.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 87-year-old black female with
dementia, poor historian status post fall with multiple
medical problems chronically and an increase white blood cell
count and UTI acutely.

The following was the plan decided upon admission of the
patient.

#1.  ORTHOPEDIC:  Left intertrochanteric fracture of the
femur by x-ray.  The patient was seen by the Orthopedic
Department to under open reduction and internal fixation
after medical clearance.  Pain is to be controlled with
Morphine sulfate with adequate breakthrough coverage as well.

#2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Increased white blood cell count
and urinalysis consistent with URI in a patient with a recent
history of frequent UTIs.  Urine culture pending.  Will treat
empirically with Cipro 500 mg q.24h. PO and follow CBCs.  The
patient is afebrile and stable for now.  No other infectious
source suspected.

#3.  RENAL:  The patient has end-stage renal disease on
dialysis with a creatinine of 4.1, much greater than
baseline.  The patient usually gets dialysis on Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday.  Will arrange for hemodialysis to be
done appropriately.

#4.  ENDOCRINE:  Diabetes mellitus with triopathy; stable
with pain medications and placed on [**Doctor First Name **] diet.

#5.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Status post myocardial infarction times
two with 45% [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**2184-5-1**].  The last cardiac catheterization
was [**2182**].  Currently, no symptoms with negative EKG.  No need
for rule out myocardial infarction, may need cardiac workup
for ...................clearance.

#6.  PROPHYLAXIS:  Heparin subcutaneously, check
coagulations.

#7.  FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  [**Doctor First Name **] and cardiac
diet.

#8.  DEMENTIA:  No sign of altered mental status from
baseline or lethargy;  will contact family to verify; can
give Ambien for sleep.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On hospital day #2, the patient was found
to be unable to respond sensibly to questions.  However, the
vital signs remained stable with blood pressures in the 140
range.  The heart rate was in the 80s, and she was saturating
well and afebrile throughout the day.  She was given
Ciprofloxacin for a second day to treated a supposed UTI.
The patient was somnolent, drowsy, and babbling at times.
The physical examination was unchanged, however.  Labs showed
an increase in the White blood cell to 25.9 with a left shift
of 92% neutrophils.  The patient underwent dialysis later
that day.  The plan on hospital day #2 was to continue
working up the patient for potential increased white blood
cell count of infectious etiology.

On hospital day #3, the patient had no complaints that
morning, but the patient was still disoriented and she did
not know why she was in the hospital.  Vital signs were
stable.  The examination was normal.  The patient was thought
to be improving clinically and laboratory wise as the white
count had dropped to 18 and the electrolytes were normal
except for a magnesium of 1.4.

Because the patient had apparent petechiae on her feet, the
patient's attending, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] felt that it would be
necessary to get a DIC panel.  The DIC panel revealed the
fibrinogen coming back elevated at 426 and the fibrin
degradation products are equal to 10 to 40.  As of hospital
day #3 neither urine cultures nor blood cultures had come
back positive for any growth and the plan was made to have
the patient operated on the following day and then return to
the Medicine
