STUDIES:
[**4-3**] CXR: Diffuse bilateral opacities most consistent with
pulmonary edema. Although most frequently due to congestive
heart failure, the differential diagnosis for pulmonary edema is
broad and includes central nervous system disorders, sensitivity
reaction, aspiration, and hemorrhage.

[**4-3**] KUB: Non-obstructive bowel gas pattern with NG tube
visualized with
the tip in the stomach.

[**4-4**] TTE: No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis. EF
60-65%. Normal regional and global biventricular systolic
function. The valves are well seen without significant
regurgitation making endocarditis unlikely.
.
[**4-8**] TEE:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. A central line is seen in the SVC/right
atrium without evidence of overlying thrombus/vegetation.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque to 42 cm
from the incisors. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation
is seen on the mitral valve. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Trace aortic regurgitation with normal valve
morphology.

Brief Hospital Course:
30 F w/ IDDM c/b gastroparesis and HTN p/w n/v and coffee-ground
emesis concerning for UGIB.

In the MICU, patient was transfused 1U PRBC with hematocrit
remaining stable and stool guaiac negative. She was seen by GI
who felt that the NG return showed brown, not coffee-ground
emesis and deferred endoscopy given hemodynamic and hematocrit
stability. Her MICU course was otherwise notable for respiratory
distress attributed to possible aspiration in the setting of her
emesis. She required a non-rebreather to keep up her sats in the
morning, but was quickly weaned to 3L nasal canula. [**Month/Day/Year **]
cultures were significant for coag positive S. aureus. Patient
was started on vancomycin and zosyn for broad coverage. A TTE
was done which was read with a low likelihood of endocarditis.
Stool cultures, urine cultures negative to date. Influenza swab
was negative. NGT was clamped and removed prior to call out to
the floor. Finally, patient presented with [**Last Name (un) **]- FeNa was 0.21%
consistent with a prerenal process. Re
