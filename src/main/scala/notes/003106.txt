s/p fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] F who lives in an independent living facility has been
taking OTC meds for a chest cold of which the robitussin makes
her lightheaded.  She stood up to get out of bed this morning
and
fell down.  Does not rememebr hitting her head or LOC but admits
it took quite a while to get back up.  She was taken to an OSH
where a head CT showed a 0.9cm R SDH with a 0.45cm midline
shift.
A CXR was c/w pneumonia.  Pt has a h/o CAD with 2 stents,
currently anticoagulated with Plavix and ASA.

Pertinent Results:
CT head [**2200-8-25**]:
FINDINGS: There is a mixed attenuation subdural collection
layering along the right cerebral hemisphere, compatible with
acute on chronic subdural hematoma, which measures up to 1 cm.
There is mild right- to- left midline shift measuring
approximately 4 mm. There is sulcal effacement along the right
cerebral hemisphere. No intra- axial hemorrhage or edema is
seen. There is focal calcification in the left basal ganglia.

Subcutaneous tissues and orbits are grossly unremarkable. The
mastoids are clear. There is nasal septal deviation to the
right. Mucosal thickening is noted in the ethmoid and sphenoid
sinuses as well as air- fluid level in the bilateral maxillary
sinuses. The lamina papyracea appear intact.

There is calcification of the carotid siphons.

IMPRESSION:

1. Acute on chronic subdural hematoma along the right cerebral
hemishpere causing sulcal effacement and mild shift of midline.
2. Small air-fluid levels in the maxillary sinuses and paranasal
sinus mucosal thickening. CT facial bones may be obtained if
there is concern for facial bone fracture.

CT head [**2200-8-26**]:
Comparison is made with [**2200-8-25**].

Right hemispheric acute subdural hematoma is unchanged in size.
There is minimal midline shift, which is also unchanged. A small
amount of hemorrhage along the left tentorial reflection is also
seen.

There has been no extension of the hematoma or new hemorrhage
seen. There is mild small vessel ischemic sequela in the
subcortical and periventricular white matter.
Ventricles are stable.

IMPRESSION: Essentially no change.

CT head [**2200-8-27**]:
Comparison with [**2200-8-26**], 12:03 p.m. The subdural
hematoma outlining the right cerebral convexity is unchanged, as
is the amount of blood along the tentorial reflections. No
significant midline shift, hydrocephalus, or acute major
vascular territorial infarct is identified. No fractures are
seen. Imaged sinuses are notable for scattered opacification of
scattered ethmoid air cells and sphenoid sinuses. Mastoid air
cells and frontal sinuses are clear.

IMPRESSION: Similar appearance of subdural hematoma.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) [**2200-8-25**]:
FINDINGS: AP portable chest radiograph was obtained in a
semi-upright position. The lungs appear clear bilaterally. There
is no evidence of pneumonia or CHF. No pleural effusion or
pneumothorax is present. The heart size is top normal.
Mediastinal contour is unremarkable. Aortic arch calcification
is noted. Degenerative changes are seen at the AC joints
bilaterally. Surgical clips in the right upper quadrant likely
from prior cholecystectomy. There may be slight compression of a
lower thoracic vertebra, though this is suboptimally assessed.
Degenerative changes are noted in the spine.

IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of acute intrathoracic process.
2. Borderline cardiomegaly.
3. Possible compression deformity in the mid thoracic spine.
Correlation with lateral view may be helpful to further
evaluate.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2200-8-27**] 5:23 PM
Reason: pneumonia
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
[**Age over 90 **] year old woman with pneumonia
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
pneumonia
CHEST, PA AND LATERAL VIEWS IN COMPARISON WITH [**2200-8-25**].
PA and lateral views of the chest reveals the heart to be
enlarged. There is calcium in the aorta with uncoiling. There is
slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle and haziness at
the left base. The vascular markings are prominent. There is
pleural fluid in both fissures as well as both costophrenic
angles posteriorly. The pattern is that of congestive failure.
Small patch of pneumonitis cannot be excluded, however. A focal
area cannot be identified.

CONCLUSION: Changes consistent with cardiac failure, however, a
small area of pneumonitis cannot be excluded.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to neurosurgery service on [**8-25**] after a fall
with a CT showing a 0.9cm R Subdural hematoma.  A chest-x-ray
from her referring hospital was consistent with pneumonia and
the pt was c/o cough with productive sputum.  A 5 day course of
levofloxacin was initiated. Plavix and ASA were held, the pt
recieved a unit of platelets, was loaded on dilantin for seizure
prophylaxis and Pt was admitted to the ICU for strict
neurological monitoring.  On the night of HD#1 the pt's blood
pressure dropped to a systolic in the 80s with a corresponding
HR in the 30s and required dopamine to maintain her SBP>100.
Her antihypertensive medications were held. A reduced dose of
metoprolol was restarted the next day when she was tranfered out
of the ICU to the neurosurgical floor. Follow-up CTs on [**8-26**] and
[**8-27**] showed no progression of her subdural hematoma.  Her
hospital course was uncomplicated.  Neurological exam showed no
defecits on admission and remained normal throughout her
hospital course.  Her pneumonia continued to resolve during her
hospital stay, treated with levofloxacin and robitussin for
cough.  Follow-up CXR was consistent with resolving pneumonia.
Her aspirin was restarted during her hospital course and her
plavix is to be restarted on [**9-1**].
