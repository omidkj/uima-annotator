none

History of Present Illness:
57F known history of alcohol abuse and withdrawal seizures
presenting with several suspected seizures and a prolonged
generalized seizure this [**Last Name (un) 44550**].
From neurology note:
Per husband, he noted her to have urinary incontinence followed
by brief twitching of both her hands with eye deviation upwards
around 4:30 AM while in bed. He changed the sheets and then went
back to sleep. There was a second short episode around 8AM of
similar semiology with urinary incontience.

Later in the morning, she was noted to have a similar but more
prolonged episode that also involved urination and rhythmic
movements of all extremities. EMS was called and arrived to the
house with her continued seizing, for which she received 4 mg IV
ativan. Total duration of last episode was at least 15 minutes.

Initial ED vitals were temp of 97.4, 98, 148/99, 100% RA.
Patient was noted to be somnolent and unarousable but was
protecting
her airway, but then began seizing again with clonic movements
of
all extremities. She received 6 mg Ativan which did not stop the
event; she was then intubated for airway protection with 120
succinate and 20mg etomodate and given another 4 mg Ativan which
did stop the clinical seizures.  She was also given narcan
0.04mg x1.She was started on propofol for sedation.

Per husband, patient has been drinking more heavily in past 3
weeks, but progressed to double or more of her usual for the
past
3 days where she has essentially been drinking and sleeping
only.
The last known drink was at 11PM last night ([**6-28**]) just before
she
went to bed.

Labs remarkable for an etoh level of 20 and serum benzos
positive. K on ABG was 3.1.

On arrival to the MICU, patient is intubated and sedated.

Radiology:
Head CT: IMPRESSION:  No intracranial hemorrhage or calvarial
fracture.  Pan-sinus
disease.

CXR:IMPRESSION:  No significant interval changes or evidence of
pneumonia

EEG:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study
because of
diffuse background slowing during wakefulness and brief runs of
frontal
intermittent rhythmic delta activity along with triphasic waves.
These
findings are indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction,
which is
etiologically nonspecific. There are rare multifocal sharp waves
indicative
of multifocal cortical irritation and propensity towards
multifocal seizures.
There are no electrographic seizures. Compared to the prior
day's recording,
there is no significant change

Brief Hospital Course:
57F known history of alcohol abuse and withdrawal seizures
presenting with several suspected seizures and a prolonged
generalized seizure.

Active Diagnoses
# Alcohol withdrawl seizures:  History of alcohol abuse and
previous withdrawal seizures.  Non contrast Head CT was
negative.  Pt was monitored with continuous bedside EEG
monitoring and followed by Neurology for seizure management.  Pt
initially required propofol sedation and intubation for airway
protection.  The first attempt at extubation on [**6-30**] resulted in
apnea and agitation.  However, a second attempt on [**7-1**] was
successful.  Thiamine, folate, MVI on board now.  Of note,
Dilantin should be avoided in EtOH withdrawal seizures.  Once
extubated, the patient was placed on a CIWA protocol with
diazepam.  EEG monitoring was discontinued.  On the morning of
[**7-2**], she had no asterixis or tremors, but had been given
diazepam as part of CIWA protocol 3 times in prevous 24 hours.
She spoke of grief over the death of her son as a cause of her
drinking, and a social work consult was requested.  The patient
was considered stable enough for transfer to the floor from the
MICU. On arrival to the floor, the patient remained stable. She
did not score on the CIWA and required no diazepam. Her vital
signs remained stable, no AMS, and no tremors.

# Hypokalemia: Pt presented with hypokalemia, likely
nutritional. Repleted throughout admission.

#Throat pain: Following transfer from the MICU, the patient
developed a cough, sore throat, and right sided   pleurtic chest
pain. These symtoms were most likely secondary to intubation. A
CXR showed no signs of infiltrate or consolidation and the
patient remained afebrile with no white count. The patient was
never SOB or tachypneic. Pain was improving at discharge.

Chronic Diagnoses
# Hypertension: Patient initially hypertensive on admission, but
this resolved with sedation.  On extubation, her home dose of
amlodipine was re-initiated.

# Sinusitus: Unclear if active.  Home meds held initially, but
fluticasone was restarted when patient was extubated.

# Reactive airway disease.  Stable, restarted albuterol MDI
after extubation for her cough.

Transitional Issues
#Patient to follow up with social work recommendations for
alcohol recovery programs.
# Communication: Patient, husband [**Name (NI) **]: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 100588**]
