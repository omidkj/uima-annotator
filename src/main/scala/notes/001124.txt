Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
83 YO M w AF/FLUT (not anticoagulated), bioprosthetic AVR for
AS, prior colon Ca s/p hemicolectomy presenting from [**Hospital 745**]
Health Center Rehab with increased confusion, lethargy and
cloudy urine. The patient is a very poor historian so his
history was obtained largely from his daughter and HCP. She
reports that the patient was largely independant prior to a [**Month (only) 116**]
admission to [**Hospital1 18**] for MRSA bacteremia. He was treated with 4
weeks of abx and discharged to rehab. While at rehab he was
doing well until approximately 2 weeks ago. He began to develop
some mild confusion and had a fall. He reportedly did not have
any sequelae after the fall and it is not clear if the patient
had any secondary trauma although his changes in mental status
have also occurred over the past couple of weeks. Over the past
week, he has become more fatigued and lethargic, not getting out
of bed as he usually does. At one point, he did pull out his
foley. Over the past day, the patient's confusion became much
more severe. He developed some diarrhea and his family was
concerned that his confusion was [**3-4**] a UTI. His rehab noted that
the patient had a leukocytosis and so he was brought into the ED
for further evaluation.
.
Upon presentation to the ED, his initial VS were: 101.8 110
105/47 18 95%. Shortly after arrival his SBP decreased to 84.
Exam was reportably notable for mild confusion (normally
oriented times 3, but not oriented to time in the ED) a LUSB
ejection murmur and cloudy urine. Labs were notable for a
leukocytosis with left shift but no bands, a lactate of 1.4 and
a u/a with >50 WBCs and positive leuks. EKG was notable for new
ST segment depressions in V4-V6 with a rate of 117. Two 18g PIVs
were placed and less than 1L NS were given. Blood and urine
cultures were sent and the patient was given cefepime 2g,
levoflox 750mg IV once and APAP 325mg. VS prior to transfer
were: 107 22 97/52 95%.
.
Upon arrival to the floor, the patient reports recent confusion
and possibly some chest pain within the past few days although
he denies active chest pain and is unable to provide any
additional information.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 83 YO M with CHF EF 45-50%, aortic stenosis s/p
biprosthetic AVR, prior colon CA s/p hemicolectomy, chronic
indwelling foley for urinary retention and recent
hospitalization for MRSA bacteremia admitted with septicemia
from urinary source with pansensitive proteus mirabilis on blood
and urine cultures.

# Sepsis secondary to ascending urinary tract infection
Blood and urine cultures from admission with pan-sensitive
proteus mirabilis. Presented with pyuria, fevers, altered mental
status and leukocytosis to 18.2. Became hypotensive and
tachycardic shortly after arrival, which improved with fluid
boluses. Initially treated with vancomycin, cefepime and
ciprofloxacin. Changed to meropenem/ciprofloxacin. Narrowed to
ciprofloxacin alone once sensitivities available. Fevers, pyuria
and leukocytosis resolved within a couple days, and his mental
status slowly cleared to his baseline.  He was discharged to
complete 14 day course of ciprofloxacin and he will follow up in
[**Hospital 159**] clinic.

# Altered mental status
Acute delirium in the setting of dementia. Most likely secondary
to infectious process. He came in mildly confused and
persistently did not know why he was brought to the hospital.
His confusion slowly improved; he became more coherent and
interactive over the course of his stay. He became mildly
agitated at times but could be reoriented. No focal neurologic
signs or symptoms.  On discharge he was alert, oriented to
person and place.  He was able to count from 10 to 1 backward.
He was at his baseline on discharge.

# EKG changes
When he became tachycardic to 117 in the setting of sepsis, he
had new ST segment depressions V4-V6. Improved when his heart
rate normalized with fluid resuscitation. Negative cardiac
enzymes and lack of chest pain or symptoms suggestive of anginal
equivalent. EKG changes were likely secon
