Service:

Patient was initially admitted to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit and was then transferred to the Medicine Team.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 75-year-old white
male with multiple medical problems who was admitted on
[**2146-11-4**] from an outside hospital.  Patient was in
his usual state of health until an acute onset of shortness
of breath and respiratory distress.  The patient was admitted
to an outside hospital with tachycardia, acidosis, hypoxia
and hypotension with systolic blood pressures in the 70s and
a pH of 7.26.

He had an EKG which showed sinus tachycardia, but no evidence
of acute ischemia.  An echocardiogram at the outside hospital
showed an ejection fraction of 40% with anterior hypokinesis
and akinesis.  He had a CT Scan angiogram which was negative
for a pulmonary embolus, but did have a right lung effusion
and consolidation.  Given these findings, the patient was
transferred from the outside hospital to the [**Hospital1 346**].

During the transfer, the patient suffered from a PEA arrest
and was resuscitated according to the PEA protocol.  Upon
admission to the [**Hospital1 69**], he was
admitted to the CCU.  Work up revealed cardiogenic versus
septic shock.  The patient did have a troponin leak, but EKG
changes were not suspicious for ischemia.  This initial
troponin leak was thought secondary to demand ischemia or a
result of his cardiac arrest and resuscitation.

The patient had a PA catheter placed which was significant
for an elevated cardiac output and a decreased systemic
vascular resistant which was consistent with a septic picture
rather than cardiogenic shock.  At that point, the patient
was transferred to the MICU for treatment of a right lower
lobe pneumonia and effusions.

The patient had a long .................. MICU course which
was complicated by infection and difficult fluid balance.
The patient had thoracentesis to drain his pleural effusions
and it was found they were consistent with a transudative
pattern likely thought secondary to congestive heart failure.
The patient had a repeat echocardiogram here at [**Hospital1 346**] which revealed an ejection fraction
of 25%.

The patient was initially covered with Levofloxacin, Flagyl
and Vancomycin.  When no clear pathogen was identified, he
was continued on Levaquin.  Throughout his MICU course, the
patient had difficulty being weaned from his ventilator.  He
developed a new pneumonia and had sputum positive for
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.  In addition,
the patient had a difficulty fluid status with hemodynamic
instability secondary to his congestive heart failure and
hypoalbuminemia.  Initially, he was maintained on pressures,
but eventually was able to be weaned off.

His blood pressure persistently remained low after the
multifactorial secondary to sepsis versus decreased albumin.
He was ruled out for adrenal insufficiency.  The patient was
given Dopamine to help increase cardiac output and help
increase his blood pressure, however he developed a second
troponin leak and lateral ischemic changes so Dopamine was
discontinued.  The patient was continued for treatment of his
pneumonia and was started on Lasix in hope of mobilizing his
third space fluid and increasing his cardiac output.

At the time of his transfer to the Medical Floor, the
patient's main issues included continued diuresis for his
persistent right sided transudative pleural effusion and
continued mobilization of third space fluid in general.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  CVA in [**2147-8-25**] embolic which left him with
expressive aphasia.
2.  Right leg deep venous thrombosis now on Coumadin.
3.  Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
4.  Increased cholesterol.
5.  Abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
6.  Non-Q wave MI in [**2146-9-25**].
7.  Left carotid stenosis 80%, right carotid stenosis 50 to
60%.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient is widowed for 10 years.  Cigar
smoker for 60 years.  Denies any alcohol.  He is a retired
National Guardsman.  Had been independent in terms of his
activities of daily living and was living alone prior to his
CVA in [**2146-8-25**].

MEDICATIONS:  On transfer from the MICU to the floor medical
team included,
1.  Pantoprazole 40 mg via NG q. 24 hours.
2.  Nystatin 5 mg p.o. q.i.d. p.r.n..
3.  Albuterol q. six hours p.r.n.
4.  Ipratropium six puffs inhaled q.i.d.
5.  ..................
6.  Lorazepam.
7.  Aspirin 300 mg p.o. q. day.
8.  Tylenol.
9.  Regular insulin sliding scale.
10. Dextrose.
11. Lasix 20 mg p.o. q. day.
12. NPH insulin 11 in the morning and 5 at night.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon transfer from the ICU to the
Medical Floor included a temperature of 97.7 F, blood
pressure 98/50, pulse of 80, respirations 22.  He was 96% on
room air.  In general he was a pleasant, elderly male in no
acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  He had
moist mucous membranes.  His oropharynx was clear.  Heart was
regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or
gallops.  Lungs were clear to auscultation anteriorly.
Posterior lung sounds were not assessed.  Abdomen is soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Bowel sounds are positive.
Extremities:  He had 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses.  He was warm
with trace edema.  Neuro exam:  Patient did not say anything,
but nodded his head to questions.

LABORATORY:  On transfer from the Medical Intensive Care Unit
to the Medical Floor included a white count of 3.9,
hematocrit 29.0, platelets 300.  PT 13.1, PTT 74.4, INR 1.1.
Chemistry showed a sodium of 138, potassium 4.0, chloride
101, bicarbonate 30, BUN 20, creatinine 0.9 and glucose of
134.  Calcium is 9.0, phosphorus 2.9 and magnesium of 2.0.

Urinalysis showed zero to two white blood cells, no bacteria,
occasional yeast and 21 to 50 red blood cells.

Chest x-ray showed no interval changes.

ASSESSMENT:  This is a 75 [**Hospital **] nursing home resident with
complicated recent medical history including CVA and a non-ST
segment elevation MI within the past two months.  He was
admitted on [**11-4**] with sepsis likely secondary to
pneumonia complicated by bradycardia and PEA arrest upon
transfer.  There was initial resolution of his pneumonia with
continued hypotension secondary to infection,
hypoalbuminemia, grossly positive fluid balance with right
sided transudative pleural effusion status post two
thoracentesis procedures, status post extubation now
transferred from the MICU on [**2146-11-27**] to the floor.

HOSPITAL COURSE: While on medical floor by system.
1.  PULMONARY:  Patient was status post extubation and was
intubated for respiratory failure.  He had persistent
transudative right sided pleural effusions.  Two
thoracentesis revealed that this is transudative in nature
and it was determined that continued thoracentesis would only
result in reaccumulation of fluid.

The patient was continued on a regimen of mild diuresis with
Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. in hopes of immobilizing his third
space fluid.  We monitored his effusions via chest x-rays and
oxygen saturations.  His oxygen requirement remained stable
and chest x-ray revealed stability of his effusions.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Coronary artery disease, patient is
status post two troponin leaks.  Initially he had a troponin
leak secondary to demand ischemia versus cardiac arrest
resuscitation.  His second troponin leak was secondary to
Dopamine to increase his cardiac output.  The patient had no
symptoms of chest pain and was continued on aspirin therapy.

The patient was not placed on a beta blocker or ACE inhibitor
given that his blood pressure remained low in his
hypoalbuminemic state.

PUMP:  Patient had ejection fractions of 25% after his
troponin leak, however repeat echocardiogram was obtained
which revealed an ejection fraction of 35 to 40% showing
improvement in his overall systolic function.  The patient
still had a globally depressed akinesis and hypokinesis,
however his overall function was improved.

Rhythm:  The patient was not placed on Telemetry while on the
Medical floor.  There was no indication to monito
