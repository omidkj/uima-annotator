Transfer from OSH for respiratory failure and delirium.

Left internal jugular central line placement
Intubation for mechanical ventilation


History of Present Illness:
64M with h/o AF, DM and HTN and no h/o CAD or CHF, which was
originally admitted to [**Hospital3 **] on [**1-5**] with dyspnea. He
had been experiencing chills, dry cough, and low-grade fever
during the previous week. He also did admit an increase in his
intake of salty food. On [**1-5**], he became more dyspneic. He
became frightened, and attempted to drive himself to the
hospital, whereupon he had an MVA with a stationary object and
hit his head. Afterwards c/o neck pain attributed to whiplash.
In the ED, he was febrile to 101.5F, with CXR demonstrating
cardiomegaly, perihilar vascular congestion and possible R
infiltrate. A subsequent CTA was negative for PE, though was a
limited study, and extensive airspace disease was seen c/w ARDS
vs PNA vs CHF. Rapid flu A/B was negative. He was also noted to
have RLE cellulitis which, per the family, has been present for
at least 5 years, and LENIs were checked, which were negative
for DVT. He was in AF with rate in the 80s, with a
rate-dependent LBBB. Head CT reportedly showed no evidence of
hemorrhage.
.
On the medical floor, he was started on CTX and Azithro, which
was changed to Levofloxacin. He experienced worsening
tachycardia and intermittent hypotension. CKs were elevated to
300s with negative MBs. Troponin was initially 0.01, peaked at
0.11 on [**1-6**], and decreased to 0.07, with positive being >0.30.
He was transiently on a heparin gtt during ROMI. Repeat CXR
demonstrated progressive infiltrates, and pt became increasingly
hypoxic. He was intubated on [**1-6**], and diuresed [**2-10**] concerns
about CHF. He was transiently on neosynephrine for hypotension.
A TTE was done, demonstrated mildly reduced LV function with
septal paradox, mild-mod reduced RV function of unclear
etiology, and evidence of caval plethora, though pt was on PEEP.
Initial ddx for these findings included pulmonary HTN with
decompensated RV or possible myocardial contusion from the MVA.
He was extubated without difficulty after 36 hours, and was
satting well on 2L NC, but found to have striking delirium. He
was treated acutely with Haldol and benzodiazepines, with some
effect. He continued to be hypertensive to 180s, and with
worsening radiographic CXR findings in spite of clinical
improvement. At some point in stay, antibiotic regimen changed
to Levofloxacin/Vanc. Also with rising transaminitis with
AST/ALT in 500s at time of transfer. In the context of fever and
mental status changes, consideration was given to performing LP;
however, due to inadequate neurology coverage at [**Hospital3 6592**],
pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
.
On arrival, initial labs significant for hypernatremia of 154,
hypokalemia at 3.3, BUN/Cr 32/1.5, INR 5.4. Initial CEs CK
117(3), trop 0.07. ALT 469, AST 116, Aphos 56, Tbili 2.3,
Amylase 162, Lipase 216.

Past Medical History:
1) Atrial fibrillation, s/p cardioversion [**2132**], recurrent
2) Diabetes mellitus
3) HTN
4) Chronic "leg cellulitis", for which he uses triamcinolone
cream. Was last on antibiotics for this 1 year ago, and has
dramatically improved, per family.
5) h/o Bell's palsy [**2131**]
6) s/p MIBI [**2132**] with no perfusion defects, EF 35% by SPECT,
global mild HK
