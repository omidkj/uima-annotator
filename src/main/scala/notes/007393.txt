[**2164-9-25**]


History of Present Illness:
This 78 year old white male has had essentially no medical for
20 plus years. he was told in the early summer he had dental
abscesses but declined intervention then.  He recalls fever at
the time, despite a 10 day course of antibiotics. He eventually
underwent dental surgery and received another 10 day course of
antibiotics.  He now presented to [**Hospital6 5016**] with
fever and malaise and  a murmur was appreciated.  An
echocardiogram was concerning for mitral vegetation and after
being cultured was begun on Vancomycin and Unasyn.  He was then
transferred for further evaluation.

Echcardiography and cardiac catheterization were performed and a
flail posterior mitral leaflet was seen. Denatal extarctions
were performed after an intra aortic balloon was placed for
stabilization.  Infectious Disease was consulted as well.

DISCHARGE EXAM


Pertinent Results:
TTE ([**2164-9-20**]):  Dilated atria. Mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and preserved global and
regional systolic function. Probable flail posterior mitral
leaflet with at least moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
Severe tricuspid regurgitation in the presence of a possible
septal leaflet vegetation. At least moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension (IVC not visualized).

TEE ([**2164-9-21**]):Flail posterior mitral valve with severe mitral
regurgitation. No vegetation, mass, or thrombus seen.

RUQ ultrasound ([**2164-9-21**]):
1. Extremely dilated hepatic veins and IVC, and pulsatile PV
flow, findings
suggestive of right heart failure, tricuspid insufficieny and
congestive
hepatopathy secondary to cardiac dysfunction.
2. No definite hepatic mass or abscess.
3. Large right pleural effusion.
4. Limited examination of the pancreas, biliary tree, and
gallbladder.

Cardiac Cath ([**2164-9-21**]):
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated no angiographically apparant coronary artery
disease.
2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated significantly elevated
right and
left sided filling pressures, with a mean RA pressure of 22
mmHg, a
RVEDP of 22 mmHg, a mean PA prssure of 39 mmHg, and a mean PCWP
of 22
mmHg.
3. The Cardiac output/index were severely reduced to 1.9/1.0
4. SVR and PVR were elevated
5. An IABP was inserted in the right femoral artery
6. A 8 french venous sheath was sutured in place.


Brief Hospital Course:
Following admission the Infectious Disease service was
consulted.  Several TEEs failed to reveal mitral vegetations,
but did demonstaret a flail posterior leaflet.  Antibiotics were
continued.  No coronary disease was found at catheterization and
an intra aortic balloon was placed to stabilize hemodynamics and
unload the ventricle.  Beta blockade was utilized to reduce his
rapid ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation.

Multiple dental extaractions were completed as he was prepared
for cardiac surgery.
On [**9-25**] he went to the Operating Room where valve replacement,
MAZE and ligation of the left atrial appendage was performed.
The tricuspid regurgitation was reduced to trace after mitral
replacement.  The balloon was retained and the right heart was
severely impaired at the end of surgery, requiring Milrinone,
Epinephrine and Neo Synephrine to wean from bypass.  Tissue
culteres and ribosomal PCR samples were sent intraoperatively.
Vasopressin was added on the night of surgery. His IABP was
removed on POD2 followed by  worsening heart function- his
pressor support was escalated and the intraortic balloon pump
was reinserted. He stabalized mom[**Name (NI) 11711**] but then developed a
lactic acidosis and elevated liver function tests. He was seen
by general surgery and brought to the operating room for an
exploratory laparotomy and cholecysectomy. Post-operatively he
had acute renal failure requiring Continuous Venovenous
Hemodialysis. He also developed bilataterally cold lower
extremity limbs and the IABP was removed. Eventually, his toes
became necrotic.
He ultimately was found to have developed heparin antibodies and
all heparin containing meds/catheters were stopped and he was
started on Argatroban.
He continued to have an escalating pressor need and was
hypothermic. Blood cultures ultimately grew out [**Female First Name (un) **]
albicans- he was started on antifungals at that time. A long
discussion was carried out with family. Given the fact that his
prognosis was poor, and that his quality of life would be what
the patient desired, even if he was to recover from the sepsis,
the family decided to make this patient comfort measures only.
His pressors were stopped and he expired shortly thereafter. He
was pronounced at 15:40.
