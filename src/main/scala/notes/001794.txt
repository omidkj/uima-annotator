Admission Date:  [**2124-7-20**]       Discharge Date:  [**2124-7-28**]


Service:  Cardiothoracic

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 79 year old female
with a history of coronary artery disease, status post
myocardial infarction in [**2121**] who presented to an outside
hospital [**7-17**] with complaints of warmth and malaise.  She
had been in her usual state of health when these symptoms
occurred which were reminiscent of her prior myocardial
infarction.  She also had palpitations and intermittent
shortness of breath.  Electrocardiogram then showed ST
depressions in leads 1, V3 through V6 and she was thought to
be in heart failure.  CKs were cycled and found to be
negative and she was diuresed but continued to have oxygen
requirements of 4 liters by nasal cannula.  She was
transferred to [**Hospital6 256**] for
cardiac catheterization with a diagnosis of unstable angina
on a Heparin drip.  Her transthoracic echocardiogram done at
the outside hospital showed an ejection fraction of about 55%
with questionable wall motion abnormalities.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial
infarction in [**2121**], no catheterization was done.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  Diabetes mellitus.
5.  Peripheral vascular disease.
6.  Peptic ulcer disease, status post gastrointestinal bleed
requiring transfusion.
7.  Status post bladder suspension.  The patient has no known
drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Heparin drip
2.  Nitroglycerin drip
3.  Lopressor 25 b.i.d.
4.  Norvasc 10 mg q.d.
5.  Pravachol 10 mg q.d.
6.  Zantac
7.  Univasc 7.5 mg q.d.
8.  NPH 15 units q AM, 10 units q PM, 5 units of regular q.
PM

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother died at 60 of myocardial infarction,
father with diabetes mellitus.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She stopped tobacco use in [**2114**], 25 pack
year history, occasional alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on admission
revealed vital signs of temperature 97, heartrate 62, blood
pressure 142/64, respiratory rate 22, saturation 94% on 4
liters nasal cannula.  General:  An elderly female lying
           .  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination:
Anicteric, no ocular lesion.  Neck with jugulovenous
distension about 6 cm, carotids 2+ bilaterally.
Cardiovascular, regular rate and rhythm, II/VI systolic
murmur, no S3 or S4.  Lungs, crackles bilaterally.  Abdomen
is soft, nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds.
Extremities, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulse bilaterally, 1+ edema of
the lower extremities to mid calf.  Neurological:  Cranial
nerves II through XII intact, alert and oriented times three,
nonfocal.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood count 9.8, hematocrit 31.6,
chemistries reveal sodium 139, potassium 3.9, chloride 103,
carbon dioxide 22, BUN 20, creatinine 1.1, glucose 126.  CKs
were 48, troponin 2.1, MB negative.  Studies revealed
electrocardiogram results as listed above.  Cardiac
catheterization revealed three vessel coronary artery
disease, presumptive left main coronary artery disease,
normal ventricular function, elevated bilateral filling
pressures, severe pulmonary hypertension, severe systemic
systolic hypertension.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted [**2124-7-20**] with
a diagnosis of unstable angina and congestive heart failure
to the Medicine Cardiology Service where she was treated with
Aspirin, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors and Heparin drip.  She
was also diuresed with Lasix pending cardiac catheterization.
Cardiac catheterization was performed with results as listed
above. The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Based on
these results, it was felt that coronary artery bypass
grafting would be necessary.  She was further stabilized and
diuresed with Lasix and continued on Nitroglycerin drip and
Heparin.  She was taken to the Operating Room on [**2124-7-24**] where she underwent three vessel coronary artery bypass
graft with saphenous vein grafts to obtuse marginal 1,
posterior left ventricular and left anterior descending
respectively under general endotracheal anesthesia.  There
were no intraoperative complications and the patient was
transferred to the Cardiac Recovery Room, intubated, being
atrioventricularly based at 90 per minute.  She was extubated
on postoperative day #1 and she was weaned.  She was started
on Lopressor, Aspirin and Lasix and transferred to the
regular floor that evening.  That evening the patient was
complaining of some increased belching and symptoms that were
similar to her previous myocardial infarction.
Electrocardiogram was obtained which showed no changes.  She
was given 1 mg of Morphine.  On postoperative day #2 the
patient exhibited some confusion which cleared over the
course of the day.  Her narcotics were held.  On
postoperative day #3 she went into atrial fibrillation with
rates to 100s.  She was given 2 mg of Magnesium Sulfate and 5
mg of Lopressor intravenously.  Rate was controlled to the
70s, she was intravenously loaded with Amiodarone after which
she converted to normal sinus rhythm and then was continued
on oral Amiodarone.  At this time the patient was in normal
sinus rhythm on p.o. Amiodarone and Lopressor.  She is
ambulating with assistance, tolerating a regular diet and is
deemed stable for discharge to a rehabilitation facility for
further physical therapy and cardiopulmonary care.
