HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81 year-old Russian
speaking male with three vessel coronary artery disease
refusing coronary artery bypass graft, congestive heart
failure with an ejection fraction of 20 percent,
hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and
diabetes mellitus type 2 who presented to the Emergency
Department with acute onset of malaise and generalized
weakness.  The patient had been in his usual state of health
able to slowly walk up stairs when on the day of admission he
was walking through the park with his family and after five
minutes experienced the acute onset of generalized weakness
and malaise.  The patient sat down and his family noted him
to be somewhat confused.  The patient did not report any
chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, facial droop,
slurred speech or recent paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
orthopnea or edema.  The family brought the patient to the
Emergency Department where he was noted to have a heart rate
in the 40s with a systolic blood pressure around 110.
Transcutaneous pacing was attempted in the Emergency
Department, but they could not capture.  The patient
subsequently got 1 mg of Atropine three times without
improvement in his mental status, but an increase in his
heart rate to the 60s to 80s.  A Dopamine drip was
subsequently started with the patient's heart rate increasing
to the 100s and a systolic blood pressure in the 130s, but no
improvement in his mental status.  The patient subsequently
became hypoxic and hypotensive and was intubated for airway
protection prior to going for a head CT.  The patient was
subsequently transferred to the Coronary Care Unit after
getting 500 cc of normal saline.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 6.3,
hematocrit 38.4, platelets 159, PT 19, PTT 34, INR 2.4,
sodium 143, potassium 4.0,chloride 108, bicarb 25, BUN 58,

right middle lobe infiltrate.  Electrocardiogram slow atrial
fibrillation at a rate between 35 and 40 with a right bundle
branch pattern.  There are multiple premature ventricular
contractions and no ST T wave changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Arrythmia:  The patient was admitted with slow atrial
   fibrillation and treated initially with Dopamine, which
   increased his heart rate on transfer to the Coronary Care
   Unit.  The patient's Dopamine drip was eventually titrated
   to off.  The patient was briefly on Isopril for rate
   control.  The patient was taken for a automatic implanted
   cardioverter defibrillator/pacemaker placement on [**2140-5-23**], which was uncomplicated.  The patient's heart rate
   was subsequently noted to be around 90 and the etiology of
   his arrythmia was considered to be likely sick sinus
   syndrome with a tachy/brady syndrome.  The patient was
   monitored on telemetry while in the Coronary Care Unit and
   started on Amiodarone for rhythm control and a beta
   blocker for rate control. The patient's beta blocker dose
   was titrated up as tolerated by his blood pressure.

1. Coronary artery disease:  The patient was admitted with a
   history of three vessel coronary artery disease having
   refused a coronary artery bypass graft in the past.  The
   patient had no elevation and his cardiac enzymes and had
   no complaints of chest pains throughout his
   hospitalization.  He was continued on an aspirin, beta
   blocker and ace inhibitor throughout his stay in the
   Coronary Care Unit.

1. Congestive heart failure:  The patient was admitted with a
   history of congestive heart failure with an ejection
   fraction of 20 percent.  The patient appeared to be well
   compensated throughout his stay in the Coronary Care Unit
   and was continued on a beta blocker and ace inhibitor,
   which were titrated up as tolerated by the patient's blood
   pressure.

1. Pulmonary:  The patient was intubated in the Emergency
   Department for airway protection.  His oxygen and
   ventilation were normal on transfer to the Coronary Care
   Unit and he was quickly weaned from the ventilator and
   extubated on hospital day number two.  The patient had a
   stable respiratory status throughout the remainder of his
   hospitalization.

1. Renal:  The patient's creatinine was elevated on admission
   to 1.5. This had improved to 1.1, but had again trended up
   to 1.7 prior to discharge.  It is notable that the patient
   has a baseline renal insufficiency with a creatinine
   ranging between 1.1 to 1.5.  The etiology of the patient's
   elevated creatinine was considered likely secondary to
   dehydration given a calculated fractional excretion of
   sodium of 0.16 percent, which suggested a prerenal
   etiology.  The patient was given gentle hydration with
   intravenous fluids and po intake was encouraged.

1. Psychiatric:  The patient was noted to be somewhat
   confused on admission and throughout his stay in the
   Coronary Care Unit. It is notable that the patient
   received 14 mg of Ativan in the Emergency Department and
   later received 15 mg of Haldol in the Coronary Care Unit.
   Once these medications were held the patient's mental
   status improved dramatically and he was alert and oriented
   times three.  The patient was evaluated with a head CT on
   admission and on the day prior to discharge that were
   negative for acute changes.

1. Endocrine:  The patient was admitted with a history of
   diabetes mellitus type 2.  His oral hypoglycemics were
   held while he was hospitalized and he was covered with an
   insulin sliding scale.  The patient had moderately well
   controlled blood sugars and it is anticipated that his
   oral hypoglycemics will be restarted as an outpatient.

1. FEN:  The patient was evaluated by the speech and swallow
   consult service and demonstrated no evidence of
   aspiration.  He was given a soft, solid, thin liquid,
   cardiac diabetic diet, which he tolerated.

1. Hematology:  The patient's Coumadin dose was held on
   admission and was restarted once he received his automatic
   implanted cardioverter defibrillator.  His INR was
   therapeutic prior to discharge.


CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is discharged to a
rehabilitation facility.
