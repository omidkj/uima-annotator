History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 80287**] is a 68 year-old male with complex cardiac history
yearly exam with his PCP who ordered an echocardiogram which
showed increased tricuspid regurgitation with possible
constrictive physiology.  He's had a 5 pound weight gain over
the past 5 days but denies DOE, orthopnea, Occasional PND,
increased
abdominal girth with mild nausea and decreased appetite.
Cardiac surgery was consulted for evaluation and recommendations
for possible constricture pericarditis physiology and increased
TR.

[**2123-4-21**]
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The right ventricular
cavity is dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. There
is abnormal septal motion/position. A bileaflet aortic valve
prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well
seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular
gradients. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. [The amount of
regurgitation present is normal for this prosthetic aortic
valve.] The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. A
bioprosthetic tricuspid valve is present. The tricuspid
prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet motion and
transvalvular gradients. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normally functioning tricuspid valve replacement.
Dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle. There is abnormal
septal motion present, likely due to a combination of conduction
abnormality and pressure/volume overload. Normally functioning
aortic prosthesis, normal regional and global left ventricular
systolic function.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2123-4-9**], a
tricuspid valve prosthesis is now present. No tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. Pulmonary artery pressures cannot be
measured. The right ventricle is probably slightly smaller and
is hypokinetic on the current study. Dysfunction of the right
ventricle may have been masked by the degree of tricuspid
regurgitation on prior.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 80287**] was admitted on [**2123-4-4**] for a heparin bridge before
extraction of his RV lead and tricuspid valve replacement.  His
lead was extracted and a new generator was implanted on [**2123-4-6**].
A perctoral hematoma formed which resolved with evaculation and
a pressure dressing.  On [**2123-4-16**] he underwent a redo, redo
sternotomy, TV replacement (29mm porcine), epicardial lead
placement and PPM/AICD placement with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Please see
the operative note for details. He tolerated this procedure well
and was transferred in critical but stable condition to the
surgical intensive care unit.  He was extubated by the following
day.  His pacer was interrogated and his epicardial wires were
removed.  He was transferred to the surgical step down floor and
started on coumadin.  By post-operative day six he was ready for
discharge to home with coumadin follow-up.  All appointments
were advised.
