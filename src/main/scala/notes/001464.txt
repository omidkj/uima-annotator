Conclusions
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
RV with normal free wall contractility. The ascending,
transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter
and free of atherosclerotic plaque to 35 cm from the incisors.
No thoracic aortic dissection is seen. A bioprosthetic aortic
valve prosthesis is present. The prosthetic aortic valve
leaflets appear normal. The aortic valve prosthesis leaflets
appear to move normally. A paravalvular aortic valve leak is
present about the non-coronary cusp and possibly from the left
cusp. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation from the paravalvular leak is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal. Trvial to mild mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Bioprosthetic aortic valve with moderate
paravalvular regurgitation leak. Blood pressure at the time of
imaging was 130/60 mmHg on Nipride. If indicated, a repeat TEE
after continued blood pressure should be considered.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
