Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 371**]
Chief Complaint:
Right upper quadrant abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Laparoscopic, converted to open cholecystectomy
Umbilical hernia repair

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a massive gallstone in
her gallbladder.  She is 2 months status post right upper
quadrant pain with a diagnosis of the large stone and acute
cholecystitis.  At that time due to a
transient troponin increased to 0.8 she was considered not to be
a candidate for surgery and she underwent a percutaneous
cholecystostomy.  Ultimately she did not rule in for myocardial
infarction.

One month prior to this admission the tube was clamped.  She had
a drain study
which showed that there was flow of contrast injected through
the cholecystostomy tube into the cystic duct and common duct.
Three days PTA the drain was removed.  1 day PTA she experienced
right upper quadrant pain getting worse throughout the day.  She
presented to the emergency room with a white blood cell count of
11.6, alkaline phosphatase of 100, total bilirubin of 0.9.
Ultrasound showed less inflammation than was previously seen on
her ultrasound with a 4 cm stone in the gallbladder.  There was
no pericholecystic fluid or edema, but there was slight
stranding.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 28613**] was taken the operating room on [**2112-7-31**] for a lap
converted to open cholecystectomy, largely due to the size of
stone and difficulties associated with body habitus.  Please
refer to Dr.[**Name (NI) 6218**] operative note for additional details.

Post-operatively, she was admitted to the ICU for further care
due to severe pain and low urine output requiring heavy fluid
resuscitation in the setting of her multiple comorbidities and
pulmonary hypertension.  Overall, her neuro status wasw normal.
She had some post-op agitation into POD [**1-10**] which was treated
with haloperidol and ultimately resolved.  She remained with
normal mental status throughout the rest of her course.  Her
pain was managed with an epidural placed by the acute pain
service team and was subsequently removed on POD 4 without
incident; she tolerated a dilaudid PCA then oral pain when
appropriate.

She required pressors intermittently into POD 2 and remained HD
stable thereafter.  From a pulmonary perspective, CXRs were
routinely monitored for fluid overload and she was dosed with IV
lasix a couple times in order to manage her fluid balance.
Urine output improved gradually.  From a renal perspective, her
Cr did increase immediately post-operatively, peaking on [**8-3**] to
1.8 before trending downwards.  This was attributed to fluid
resuscitation issues post-op as well as lasix therapy.

From a GI perspective she was NPO initially and advanced to a
regular diet over the course of her hospitalization.  She
tolerated regular diet without incident.

She was kept on ciprofloxacin/flagyl for antibiotic coverage
until POD #3.

Of note, patient was noted to have decreased movement in her
left side during an episode of hypotension in the post-operative
period while in the ICU.  A carotid ultrasound was performed and
did not show plaque at the bifurcation but did show some flow
abnormalities including reversal of flow indicative of a
proximal lesion.  This is to be followed up as an outpatient
with further imaging potentially required.  Due to the symptoms
resolving and its overall lack of acuity this was not
readdressed during this hospitalization.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during
this stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as
possible.

At the time of discharge on POD#6, the patient was doing well,
afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet,
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well
controlled.
