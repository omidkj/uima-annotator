Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 61-year-old gentleman
with past medical history significant for COPD, bullous
emphysema, pulmonary embolus, chronic thromboembolic disease,
pulmonary hypertension, and atrial fibrillation who presented
from [**Doctor Last Name **] House with a one day history of increased shortness
of breath, bilateral lower extremity edema and facial
swelling.  On presentation, denied chest pain and
palpitations, fever, chills, cough.  In the Emergency Room
was found to be 74% on room air, was placed on a non
rebreather with increased sats to 94-95% and chest x-ray
showed bilateral effusions, right greater than left with
interstitial edema.  Initially was treated as a CHF
exacerbation on a Nitro drip and Lasix; eventually required
Bi-PAP because of continued trouble with breathing.  Because
of the patient's bilateral lower extremity swelling, the
patient had lower extremity dopplers which did demonstrate a
left sided clot, DVT, in his common femoral vein extending to
his popliteal vein.  The patient also had an emergent echo
done in the Emergency Room which showed PA pressures of 97,
severe right ventricular dysfunction and patient was then
sent for a CT angiogram which showed extensive clot burden of
the bilateral pulmonary arteries.  The patient was stable on
Bi-PAP and was not intubated and was then transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Includes history of pulmonary emboli,
reportedly per patient first in [**2134**].  From records from [**Hospital1 2025**]
noted to have pulmonary embolus a year ago and was evaluated
at [**Hospital1 2025**] for pulmonary hypertension, chronic thromboembolic
disease and was started on anticoagulation at that time.  The
patient has history of COPD with bullous emphysema on two
liters nasal cannula at home, history of hypertension,
history of prostate cancer just followed by PSA's, no
intervention yet.  History of hydrocele, history of atrial
fibrillation, history of perforated ulcers requiring a
Billroth II surgery, history of restrictive pulmonary
function test and otherwise no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  As an outpatient, Coumadin, Advair, Combivent,
Ibuprofen, Folate and Multivitamin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives at the [**Doctor Last Name **] House, formerly heavy
alcohol drinker, formerly 1?????? pack per day smoker, previous
140 pack year history, quit 6-8 years ago, former security
guard.  No children.  Survived by his two nieces.

FAMILY HISTORY:  No coronary artery disease, no peripheral
vascular disease.  No history of clots.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on admission, heart rate
77 with blood pressure 110/80, O2 saturation 97% on Bi-PAP,
respiratory rate 26.  Temperature 96.5.  In general he was a
thin, cachectic man in respiratory distress.  HEENT:  Mask in
place.  Extraocular movements intact.  Significant right
sided edema, periorbital.  Neck with JVP increased.
Cardiovascular was prominent PMI, prominent right sided
heave, positive gallop, no murmurs appreciated, no evidence
of tachycardia, regular rate and rhythm.  Respiratory was
faint crackles at the lateral bases bilaterally, otherwise
clear to auscultation.  Abdomen was active, soft, nontender,
non distended.  Well healed vertical scars.  Extremities, 2+
pitting edema of the lower extremities, warmer to pulsation,
2+ DP pulses, amputated 4th left toe.  Rectal was guaiac
negative, normal tone.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 6.7, hematocrit 38.9, platelet
count 285,000, MCV 69, sodium 137, potassium 6.5, repeat was
4.3, chloride 109, CO2 21, BUN 23, creatinine 0.7, glucose
66.  Arterial blood gases on the non rebreather, PH 7.45,
PCO2 28, PO2 42.  INR 2.8.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This was a 61-year-old gentleman with past
medical history of chronic thromboembolic disease, history of
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with bullous emphysema,
history of prostate cancer, atrial fibrillation, who presents
with acute on chronic pulmonary embolism while on therapeutic
Coumadin.

1.  Pulmonary embolus:  The patient had a pulmonary embolus
while on therapeutic Coumadin and was considered a Coumadin
failure.  The patient was initially started on Heparin drip
and transitioned to a Lovenox regimen [**Hospital1 **].  The patient's
Lovenox regimen was adjusted per his factor X-A level and was
eventually maintained on an 80 mg [**Hospital1 **] dosing of Lovenox.
However, the patient had CT angiogram with large clot burden
bilaterally, no evidence of extension of clot into the right
atrium on echocardiogram.  However, two days following
admission the patient had an acute episode of hypotension,
hypoxia and tachycardia and as was considered less
hemodynamically stable, the patient received treatment with
TPA, no evidence of bleed or neurologic change after this,
however, patient's oxygenation remained stable in the 80's to
90's as had been prior to episode of acute decompensation.
As patient continued to require increased oxygen requirements
on non rebreather and eventually to C-PAP.  Patient was tried
on a regimen of inhaled Nitric oxide to help pulmonary
vasodilation.  The patient tolerated this well and patient's
oxygenation improved rapidly while on the inhaled regimen.

However, this was a short-term therapy and patient was
started on Viagra to help bridge pulmonary vasodilation until
Nitric oxide could be weaned off.  However, patient remained
on the Nitric oxide for around 72 hours before it was
titrated off and this was turned off (was on a 25 mg q 8
regimen of the Viagra) and was then requiring C-PAP
ventilation to maintain oxygenation.

During the course of his stay, the patient had repeated
echocardiograms including echocardiogram with a bubble study
which did show improvement in his PR gradient from 97 on
admission to 84 as was noted from his previous discharge
summaries from [**Hospital1 2025**], was noted to have elevated PA pressures
on echocardiogram a year prior to this and had chronic
history of pulmonary hypertension.  The patient otherwise had
good LV function but did have a bubble study which showed
stretched patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect which
was likely a shunt secondary to patient's chronic right heart
failure as a compensation.  Echo study also showed severe
global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis which was also
consistent with previous echocardiogram reports from his [**Hospital1 2025**]
hospitalization including a right heart catheterization
during that hospitalization.  His echocardiogram did show
presence of pericardial effusion which was determined to be
stable in size and asymptomatic and which was continued to be
followed.  Eventually patient continued to not tolerate the
C-PAP mask and ventilation and continued to pull off the mask
because of discomfort.  The patient was tried on a non
rebreather mask which was more comfortable, however, his
oxygen saturations remained in the low 80's during this.  The
patient remained asymptomatic and was probably chronically
hypoxic.

Patient's PCP did note that on office visits, the patient's
room air saturation was rarely greater than 80 and on his two
liters patient's oxygen saturation was rarely greater than
86%.  Eventually patient had family meeting including his
nieces and his PCP and the primary team and as concerns for
chronicity of patient's condition and limited options in
terms of treatments secondary to his large clot burden and
large pulmonary artery pressures, the patient's code status
was changed to DNR, DNI. Patient was agreeable to this but
wanted to continue to have aggressive management as
tolerated.  The patient was continued to be treated with
C-PAP machine as tolerated, however, eventually patient was
refusing this secondary to discomfort and was maintained on a
non rebreather mask as tolerated.  Eventually as patient
continued to remain hypoxic, patient was started on prn doses
of Ativan and Morphine for increased agitation and discomfort
and eventually patient's nieces were called back and decision
was made to move toward comfort measures on a Morph
