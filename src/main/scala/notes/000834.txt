has been experiencing dyspnea on exertion since last Fall and
needs to rest for 15 minutes to resume his normal breathing
pattern.

He denies rest pain.  A stress echocardiogram on [**2112-3-28**] was stopped secondary to fatigue and was uninterpretable
for ischemia.  An echocardiogram showed mild left ventricular
hypertrophy and mild mitral regurgitation.  There was new
hypokinesis in the anterior and lateral walls status post
exercise.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  History of hypertension.
2.  History of hypercholesterolemia.
3.  History of insulin-dependent diabetes.
4.  History of peripheral vascular disease.
5.  Status post abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Accupril 20 mg p.o. twice per day.
2.  Lipitor 40 mg p.o. once per day.
3.  NPH 40 units subcutaneously twice per day.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:   His family history was unremarkable.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  His smoked one and a half packs for 15 years
and quit 20 years ago.  He drinks alcohol rarely.  He is a
retired civil engineer and lives with his wife.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Review of systems was unremarkable.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On physical
examination, this was a well-developed, well-nourished
elderly male in no apparent distress.  Vital signs were
stable, afebrile.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
Extraocular movements were intact.  The oropharynx was
benign.  The neck was supple with full range of motion.  No
lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  Carotids were 2+ and equal
bilaterally without bruits.  The lungs were clear to
auscultation and percussion.  Cardiovascular examination
revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, gallops, or
rubs.  Normal first heart sounds and second heart sounds.
The abdomen was soft and nontender with positive bowel
sounds.  No masses or hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremity
examination revealed no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Pulses
were 2+ and equal bilaterally throughout.  Neurologic
examination was nonfocal.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  The patient underwent cardiac
catheterization on [**2112-4-18**] which revealed the left
main had mild diffuse disease.  The left anterior descending
artery had a calcified origin with an 80% to 90% stenosis.
The left circumflex had an 80% stenosis at the origin, 80%
stenosis before the first obtuse marginal, and diffuse distal
60% to 70% stenosis.  The posterior descending artery was
small and diffusely diseased.  The right coronary artery was
nondominant with an ostial 80% lesion and mid diffuse 80% to
90% lesion.  Left ventriculography revealed an ejection
fraction of 45% with inferior severe hypokinesis and
akinesis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   He was admitted, and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] was
consulted.  On [**4-19**], the patient underwent a coronary
artery bypass graft times three with a left internal mammary
artery to the left anterior descending artery, reversed
saphenous vein graft to the first obtuse marginal and second
obtuse marginal sequentially.  The cross-clamp time was 87
minutes.  Total bypass time was 105 minutes.

He was transferred to the Cardiothoracic Surgery Recovery
Unit in stable condition and was extubated.  He then
developed stridor and required reintubation.  He was also
very agitated and remained intubated and on propofol.  He was
extubated on postoperative day three and had his chest tubes
discontinued on postoperative day two.

He was transferred to the floor on postoperative day six and
did well except for evening agitation which eventually
resolved.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  He was discharged to rehabilitation on
postoperative day nine.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON DISCHARGE:  His discharge
laboratories revealed hematocrit was 29.4, white blood cell
count was 10,200, and platelets were 288,000.  Sodium was
138, potassium was 4.6, chloride was 104, bicarbonate was 25,
blood urea nitrogen was 28, creatinine was 1.1, and blood
glucose was 78.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Colace 100 mg p.o. twice per day.
2.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. once per day.
3.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. twice per day (times seven days).
4.  Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. twice per day (times seven
days).
5.  Lopressor 75 mg p.o. twice per day.
6.  Haldol 5 mg p.o. q.h.s.
7.  Quinapril 10 mg p.o. twice per day.
8.  NPH insulin 10 units subcutaneously twice per day.
9.  Lipitor 40 mg p.o. once per day.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  The patient was to be
followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 39354**] in one to two weeks, and by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
