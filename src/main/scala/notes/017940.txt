Admission Date:  [**2101-8-31**]       Discharge Date:  [**2101-9-16**]

Date of Birth:   [**2024-8-2**]       Sex:  M

Service:  GENERAL SURGERY BLUE

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Cholangitis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77 year old man with a
history of obstructive jaundice since [**2101-5-26**].  In [**2101-5-26**],
the patient was discovered to have painless jaundice.  A
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed
and stent was placed.  Several days later, the stent eroded
and the patient developed an acute abdomen.  He underwent an
exploratory laparotomy by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], during which the stent
was removed and a repair of the duodenal perforation was
performed as well as placement of an 8French T-tube.  The
patient was in his usual state of health until one day prior
to admission when his T-tube accidentally fell out of his
side.  He also complained of some low grade fevers while he
was at home.  So the patient had been in his usual state of
health until one day prior to admission when apparently the
T-tube came out.  He denies any pain and he did have the low
grade fevers up to 101.7.  He denies any nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea or constipation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  In addition to the suspected ampullary
adenocarcinoma, the patient also has hypertension and
hypercholesterolemia.  He has the prior surgical history of
the exploratory laparotomy in [**2101-5-26**].

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  He takes no medications at home.

ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives with his wife and daughter.  [**Name (NI) **]
does have a positive smoking history.  No alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient on presentation was
afebrile with a heart rate of 112, blood pressure 99/69,
respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 96%.  The patient did
not seem in any acute distress.  He had a regular rate and
rhythm and lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His
abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended.  The right upper
quadrant T-tube site was in place without any drainage.  He
did have a J-tube in the left upper quadrant.  His
extremities were warm with no edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  His laboratories showed a white blood cell
count of 8.9, hematocrit 35.3, platelet count 345,000.  He
did a left shift of his white blood cell count with 90%
neutrophils.  Sodium was 133, potassium 4.1, chloride 96,
bicarbonate 25, blood urea nitrogen 38, creatinine 1.4 and
glucose 145.  His current liver function tests revealed ALT
193, AST 182, alkaline phosphatase 640, total bilirubin 1.1,
amylase 55, lipase 41. Coagulation factors showed prothrombin
time 12.4, partial thromboplastin time 26.6, INR 1.0.
Incidentally, his CA19-9 level is 82.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to surgery and
given intravenous antibiotics, Linezolid, Fluconazole and
Levofloxacin and a CAT scan was performed.  The CAT scan
showed a significant amount of intrahepatic ductal dilatation
with a persistence of the mass in the porta hepatis
compressing the hepatic duct.  There were no fluid or air
collections indicating abscesses and stable abdominal aortic
aneurysm.  The patient was followed with serial examinations
over the next 24 hours but unfortunately on hospital day two,
the patient acutely decompensated with shortness of breath,
decreasing oxygen saturation with increasing heart rate to
approximately 160.  On physical examination, the patient had
wet sounding lungs and looked in significant distress.  He
was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where a Swan-Ganz
catheter was placed.  The patient was also intubated.  An
echocardiogram at this time revealed an ejection fraction of
only 25% with diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis.  Troponin
levels were increased at this time.  A chest x-ray showed
marked bilateral pleural effusions which was confirmed in a
CTA that was performed afterwards that also showed the
bilateral pleural effusions but did not show any sign of
pulmonary embolus.  Over the next few days, the patient
received multiple transfusions with packed red blood cells
and required pressors for hemodynamic stabilization.  On
[**2101-9-6**], which was hospital day seven, the patient was doing
better hemodynamically and was finally extubated which he
tolerated well.  In addition, tube feeds were begun at this
time.  On [**2101-9-11**], hospital day twelve, the patient was
transferred to the floor.  At this time, he was already on
goal tube feeds.  He appeared well.  He appeared chronically
ill but was stable with respect to his pulmonary status and
his respiratory status, his pulmonary status and
cardiovascular status and hemodynamically he was also stable.
On [**2101-9-14**], cholangiography was performed.  This revealed an
obstructive stricture in the common bile duct with associated
dilation of the intrahepatic ducts.  Multiple biopsies were
sent that did not reveal any tumor.  A percutaneous biliary
drain was placed traversing the strictured area.  This drain
was left to drainage and drained well.  It drained bilious
material afterwards.  The bilious material was sent for
culture and grew back Enterococcus.  This Enterococcus was
sensitive to Vancomycin.  It should be noted that this is the
only positive culture that the patient had during his
hospital stay.  On the day of discharge, the patient appeared
well and was tolerating his tube feeds without complication.
His heart rate was regular rate and rhythm, lungs were clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft,
nontender, nondistended with the drain in place draining
bilious material.  The patient's extremities were warm with
no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  Although the patient had
been seen by physical therapy and was recommended for
rehabilitation, the patient and his family refused
rehabilitation and the patient was discharged home in stable
condition on [**2101-9-16**], hospital day number seventeen.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post percutaneous transhepatic catheter placement.
2.  Hypoxia and respiratory distress requiring intubation.
3.  Congestive heart failure.
4.  Myocardial injury.
5.  Atrial fibrillation.
6.  Chronic blood loss anemia requiring transfusion.
7.  Hypokalemia.
8.  Hypomagnesemia.
9.  Hemodynamic monitoring with Swan-Ganz catheter.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q24hours for one week.
2.  Fluconazole 400 mg p.o. once daily for one week.
3.  He was also recommended to start his prior medications
that he was taking before admission.

He could not remember these so he was recommended to
follow-up as soon as possible with his primary care physician
to coordinate his home medication regimen for hypertension
and hypercholesterolemia.

In addition, he was recommended to follow-up with Dr.[**Name (NI) 32606**] office to arrange a follow-up appointment in about
two weeks.

The patient was recommended to continue his tube feeds at
home with the same rate that he was taking before this
admission.
