Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, lower
extremity edema, in setting of recent coronary catheterization

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
72 year old female with h/o CAD s/p cardiac cath with BMS to PDA
4 days before admission, DM, and asthma who presents with
dyspnea, cough, chest pain, nausea, and vomiting.

She was admitted [**8-17**] to [**2170-8-18**] with shortness of breath and
lower extremity edema. She underwent cardiac cath with placement
of a bare metal stent to the posterior descending artery. She
felt well at the time of discharge. However, two days after
discharge, she developed worsening SOB and cough productive of
yellow green discharge. Her symptoms progressed and she
developed nausea and nonbilious nonbloody vomiting. She also had
chest pain, but only when coughing, and denied any at rest. She
reported low urine output over the last 1-2 days, loose stools,
lower extremity edema, and orthopnea. Weight gain of 4 lb since
discharge. No fevers or chills.

She presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital with SOB and lower extremity
edema. She was started on a heparin drip and a nitro drip and
given aspirin. Labs were significant for creatinine 5.8 from
baseline of 1.4.

In our ED, initial vitals were BP 152/85 with O2 sat 89-91%4L.
ECG showed NSR at 69 with LBBB. CXR showed pulmonary edema.
Given insulin, D50, kayex, and calcium gluconate. She was
evaluated by the attending cardiologist in the ED who felt she
was appropriate for the MICU.

In the MICU, she received insulin and D50, kayexalate and
calcium gluconate in setting of hyperkalemia.  She was ruled out
for MI with stable troponin-Ts 0.10-0.11 in setting of renal
failure. TTE with poor windows, poor patient cooperation, showed
depressed LV function with anteroseptal hypokinesis, consistent
with prior MI. She was briefly on levofloxacin for question of
pneumonia during her MICU stay, which was stopped due to low
suspicion and rapid improvement in CXR with diuresis. She was
noted to have cough during MICU stay, productive of white
sputum, no fevers, and rapid improvement in WBC. She was given
then lasix 120mg IV and metolazone 5mg po to which she responded
very well. She continued to be 2+L negative today in MICU prior
to transfer without additional diuretics. Creatinine stabilized
at 6.3 and she was transferred to the floor and felt well
overall, denying SOB but orthopnea, no CP at rest but yes with
coughing, no fevers.

Of note, patient gets yearly TTEs by outside cardiologist, per
daughter.  Follows with cardiologist because of hypertension
history, no prior MIs that she knows of. Per daughter, EF was
noted to decrease from 40% to 20% on routine Echo at [**Location (un) **] a
couple of weeks ago. She was then scheduled for Diagnostic
Cardiac Catheterization at [**Location (un) **] on Wednesday [**8-15**], showing 80%
stenosis of PDA. She then underwent upper endoscopy on Thursday
[**8-16**] to look for gastric pathology because of history of GI bleed
in [**2166**]. Admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for Cardiac Catheterization Friday
[**8-17**], s/p bare metal stent to posterior descending artery,
discharged [**8-18**].

Pertinent Results:
ECG [**8-17**]: Normal sinus rhythm. Incomplete left bundle-branch
block with secondary repolarization changes

ECG [**8-21**]: Normal sinus rhythm with left bundle branch block,
rate 100

Cardiac cath [**8-17**]:
1. 80% ostial PDA stenosis.
2. Successful PCI to the PDA with 2.5x15mm BMS.
3. FFR of 0.89 assessment of the mLAD lesion.
4. Medical management of the LAD lesion.
5. Successful Perclose of the right CFA.
6. No complications.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful PCI to the PDA with BMS.
3. Negative FFR of the mid LAD lesion.
4. Patient to remain on aspirin indefinitely and clopidogrel for
at
least 1-3 months uninterrupted.
5. No complications.

[**2170-8-22**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
FINDINGS: Since [**2170-8-21**], pulmonary edema has
resolved. Bilateral
mild-to-moderate effusion and bibasilar atelectasis are no
different.
Mild-moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. Mediastinal and hilar
contour are
similar in appearance to the prior radiograph.

[**2170-8-21**] Radiology RENAL U.S.
IMPRESSION:
1. No hydronephrosis seen.
2. Two 6 mm non-obstructing right renal stones.

[**2170-8-21**] Cardiology ECHO
Study severely limited due to poor acoustic windows and limited
patient cooperation. The left atrium is normal in size. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Left ventricular systolic
function is depressed (probably severely) with anteroseptal
akinesis. Inferolateral wall motion appears borderline
preserved. Regional wall motion was not fully evaluted due to
technical difficulties. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened (?#). There is probably no aortic stenosis. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Valvular regurgitation was
not adequately assessed. No significant pericardial effusion
seen in limited views.

Brief Hospital Course:
72 year old female with h/o CAD s/p cardiac cath with BMS to PDA
3 days prior to admission, DM II, CHF, anemia, and asthma who
presented with contrast-induced nephropathy causing acute renal
failure, chest pain, and congestive heart failure.

# Acute renal failure: When admitted, creatinine elevated to 5.8
with baseline of 1.4. Most likely etiology was contrast
nephropathy given time-course and 2 recent cardiac caths in this
diabetic patient. Renal recommended deferring HD, and p
