notable for hypokalemia and low mag, also found to be
pancytopenic.  EKG with NS, normal axis/intervals, with no
regional ischemic changes.  CXR was negative for focal process.
In the ED, was given magnesium and potassium repletion, as well

Imaging:
CT chest ([**7-10**]):
IMPRESSION:
1.  Decreased tree-in-[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 239**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 75026**] in the lungs
bilaterally, most likely due to an improving diffuse small
airways infection. Tumor dissemination could have this
appearance; however the diffuse and relatively homogeneous
distribution suggests infection rather than malignancy.
2.  No CT findings of radiation pneumonitis.
3.  Slightly improved left hilar mass.
4.  Slightly enlarged 17mm hepatic hypodensity incompletely
assessed on this exam or the prior CT and further assessment
should be obtained with MRI to assess for metastasis.

Barium Swallow ([**2101-7-18**])
Delayed passage of thick barium and a barium tablet in the
midesophagus. While it does not meet all radiologic criteria it
likely represents a mild stricture as the patient reports
dysphagia in this location.

CXR ([**2101-7-23**]):
Worsening airspace consolidation at the right lung base which
could
reflect worsening pneumonia, although the pulmonary vasculature
looks more ill-defined and therefore superimposed edema should
also be considered.  There continues to be a small right pleural
effusion, but now visualized is a small left effusion as well.
Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  No
pneumothorax.

MICRO/PATH:
C. Diff negative on [**7-15**] and [**7-22**]

Urinary legionella antigen negative on [**7-16**]

      2+   (1-5 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE COCCI.
