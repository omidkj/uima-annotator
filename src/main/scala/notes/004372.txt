Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5606**]
Chief Complaint:
pneumonia, sepsis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This is a 76 year old male with PMH significant for CAD s/p MI,
CHF, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, PVD s/p right BKA, IDDM
complicated by ESRD on MWF dialysis who initially presented to
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital from [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 1501**] for further evaluation of
nausea/vomiting/hypoxia and was found to have right lower lobe
pneumonia and sepsis. Per his rehab records, the patient was
found to have an O2 sat of 63% on RA with a temperature of
102.1. He was reportedly alert and his O2 sat increased to 80%
after 4L NC. Blood glucose was 152 at the time. Per report, his
code status had previously been established as DNR/DNI, but it
was reversed upon arrival to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and he was intubated
and placed on peripheral Levophed and Neosynephrine to support
his blood pressure. He was given 6L of IV fluids and was started
on vancomycin/Zosyn/ceftriaxone at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital. He was
then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for higher level of care. During
transport, he was noted to be hypotensive despite peripheral
Levophed and Neosynephrine to the 60s-90s systolic.
In the ED, initial VS were not recorded. A left IJ central line
was placed. His neosynephrine and Levophed were titrated up to
3.5mcg/kg and 0.4mcg/kg respectively to maintain MAPs>65. He was
also started on a fentanyl drip for sedation. CXR showed
bilateral mediastinal and lower lobe infiltrates, right sided
pleural effusion, right sided tunneled HD catheter, and newly
placed left IJ central line. Labs were significant for a
positive UA, elevated coags with an INR=2.7, a white count of
14.8 with 16% bandemia, a Hct=38.9 with an MCV of 99, BNP of
27,394, and elevated BUN to 53 and Cr=3.5. Blood and urine
cultures were drawn. Of note, his lactate was within normal
limitis at 1.6. No additional antibiotics or IVFs were
administered. CVP was noted to be 19. On transfer, vitals were
noted to be HR=116, BP=99/63, RR=19, POx=98% on CMV with 100%
fiO2, 500cc TV, and PEEP=10.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient was intubated and sedated,
therefore further history was obtained through OSH records.

IMAGING:
[**2186-4-3**] CXR:
SINGLE PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: A large bore right
central venous
internal jugular catheter terminates in the low SVC. An
endotracheal tube
terminates 2.8 cm above the level of the carina. A nasogastric
tube courses
below the diaphragm, though the tip is incompletely imaged. A
left internal
jugular catheter terminates in the left brachiocephalic vein at
the midline. No pneumothorax is evident. Diffuse alveolar
opacities involve the entire right lung. Given the overall
diffuse interstitial opacities, hilar engorgement and
cardiomegaly, the right-sided density likely reflects
asymmetric pulmonary edema. Confluent consolidation such as
aspiration or
pneumonia are also within the differential though less likely.
Followup chest radiograph is recommended when patient is in a
more euvolemic state.
Additional opacities in the left lung base, likely reflect
atelectasis. Mild fullness of the right hila appears stable on
follow-up chest radiograph, suggesting that this reflects
vascular engorgement.
IMPRESSION:
1. Right large bore central venous line terminating in the lower
SVC. Left
central venous line terminating in the mid left brachiocephalic
vein.
Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes in standard position
