HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 47 -year-old
gentleman with a past medical history of coronary artery
disease status post coronary artery bypass graft, diabetes
mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and peptic ulcer
disease, who was in his usual state of health until the day
prior to admission when he noted the onset of dizziness.  The
dizziness occurred with standing and resolved when he lay
flat.  He held his blood pressure medicine after discussing
it with his wife's primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
afternoon, he began to have black, semi-liquid stools.
Approximately four episodes prior to coming to the Emergency
Department.

At 01:00 PM he began to have chest pain that resembled his
anginal equivalent which was sharp, substernal chest pain
with radiation to the left arm without shortness of breath,
nausea, or diaphoresis.  He took one to two sublinguals with
relief for one hour, but then the chest pain recurred.  He
took two more sublingual nitroglycerin every hour for four
hours, and then decided to come to the Emergency Room.  He
developed chest pain in the ambulance on the way in.

He has a past medical history peptic ulcer disease without
bleeding twenty years ago.  No recent reflux, abdominal pain,
nausea or vomiting, or bright red blood per rectum.  He has
been taking Naprosyn 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] over the past month after a
motor vehicle accident.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2155**] with a left internal mammary artery to
the left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to the
right coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to the RI.  In
[**2161**] he had a stent placed at the saphenous vein graft to the
RI which was redilated after he had filled with stenosis.  He
also had a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of
the distal left anterior descending at the touchdown site in
[**2162**].  All of his native coronary arteries are occluded.  He
had a positive exercise tolerance test in [**2163**] which showed
previously seen anterolateral deficits.  He had a
catheterization in [**2163**] which showed an ejection fraction of
20%, global hypokinesis, and saphenous vein graft #2 to the
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was totally
occluded and his distal left anterior descending at touchdown
site was 70%.
2.  Diabetes.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Hyperlipidemia.
5.  Status post breast carotid endarterectomy in [**2161**] after
cancer.
6.  Transient ischemic attack.
7.  Proteinuria.
8.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
9.  Peptic ulcer disease.

ADMITTING MEDICATIONS:  Glucophage 800 mg po tid, Lipitor 40
mg po bid, Naprosyn 500 mg po bid, Glucotrol 20 mg q day,
Diltiazem 240 mg q day, nitroglycerin prn, Isordil 20 mg tid,
Norvasc 10 mg q day, Glyburide 10 mg [**Hospital1 **], Captopril 12.5 mg
tid, Wellbutrin 100 mg [**Hospital1 **], Atenolol 100 mg q day, aspirin
325 mg q day.

ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, he was afebrile, heart
rate was 100, blood pressure was 130/80, respirations of 16,
saturating 100% on two liters.  In general, he was an
uncomfortable appearing male, but alert.  Head, eyes, ears,
nose and throat: had anicteric sclerae, his mucous membranes
were moist.  Neck was supple, no lymphadenopathy or jugular
venous distention.  Heart was tachycardic, but had a regular
rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Lungs are
clear bilaterally.  Abdomen was soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Guaiac positive.  Extremities showed no
cyanosis, clubbing or edema.

ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA:  He had a white count of 12.0 and
a hematocrit of 23 with a hemoglobin of 7.8 and platelets
250,000.  BUN and creatinine 65 and 1.0.  PT INR 1.2, PTT 21.
First CK was 77 with a troponin of less than 0.3.

Chest x-ray showed no infiltrates or effusions.
Electrocardiogram was sinus tachycardia, normal axis and
intervals, with 2.[**Street Address(2) **] depressions and T-wave inversions
in I, AVL, and also ST depressions in II, III, and F, 4.[**Street Address(2) 26378**] depressions in V2 through V6.

ASSESSMENT:  A 47 -year-old man with severe coronary artery
disease affecting his native vessels in one out of three
bypass grafts who presents with chest pain and dramatic
electrocardiogram changes in the setting of an acute
gastrointestinal bleed.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiac:  The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Care
Unit and serial CKs were cycled, which peaked at close to
3,000, with evolution of his electrocardiogram changes.
Given the active gastrointestinal bleed and profound anemia,
felt to cause a strain on his heart, a decision was made not
to take the patient to the Catheterization Lab, but to
medically manage his gastrointestinal bleed first.  He was
continued on beta blockers as tolerated, his ACE inhibitor,
his Lipitor, and aggressively medically managed.
