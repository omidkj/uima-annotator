Discharge Labs:

micro:
Blood culture pending
Urine culture pending

Imaging:
CXR [**2117-2-25**]: IMPRESSION: 1. Appropriate ET tube positioning. 2.
Prominent cardiac contour and increased left greater than right
upper lung
opacification, likely representing cardiac decompensation and
asymmetric
edema.  3. Can't exclude supervening infection in the upper
lungs. Consider reevaluation following treatment for pulmonary
edema. Improving right lower lobe consolidation. 4. Severe
emphysema, basal predominant, in keeping with known Alpha-1
antitrypsin deficiency.
CXR [**2117-2-26**]: IMPRESSION: 1. Heterogeneous opacities in the upper
lungs, left greater than right, not significantly changed since
[**2117-2-28**] exam. Retrocardiac opacity is new since prior. Above
findings may represent asymmetric pulmonary edema or multifocal
infection
2. Moderate emphysema with basal predominance, compatible with
patient's
given history of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.
CXR [**2117-2-27**]: Compared with [**2117-2-26**] at 2:22 a.m., multiple lines
and tubes have been removed. A left subclavian indwelling
catheter tip is unchanged, overlying the SVC/RA junction.
Otherwise, no significant change is detected. Again seen is
hyperinflation and parenchymal scarring. Relative lucency at
both apices is stable and may reflect bullous change.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure: Most likely
multifactorial in etiology with possible contribution from
anxiety, respiratory depression from narcotics and possible
aspiration. Patient with alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency and
severe COPD in 3-4L O2 at baseline. He was recently admitted for
a pneumonia 1 month ago and has completed a course of
ceftriaxone and azithromycin. CXR on admission shows a possible
LUL opacity and he had an elevated WBC count of 16 though no
fever. He was intubated in the ED and started on broad-spectrum
antibiotics with vanc, cefepime and levofloxacin, which were
discontinued on day 2 due to low suspicion for true infection.
Patient was extubated on day 2 and was satting well on NC.
Oxygen was weaned on the medicine floor and patient was satting
well on RA

2. Diabetes mellitus type I: Poorly-controlled with most recent
A1c 11.9, and resent, with result of 11.2 . He was maintained on
outpatient Lantus 35 units daily and insulin SS.

3. LE Edema: On Bumex for diuresis.  Was treated with 80mg IV
lasix x2 and then restarted on home bumex with good effect. He
currently does not appear significantly volume overloaded.  He
needs outpatient follow up for his cirrhosis.

4. Cirrhosis (HCV and A1AT): Hep C has not been treated. He has
not followed up with liver in a while. He was recently
discharged on lactulose and bumex and instructed to follow up
with liver as outpatient

5. Adrenal Insufficiency: He was given hydrocortisone in the ED.
Continued on prednisone taper down to home dose of 10mg daily

6. Hypothyroidism: Originally placed on IV levothyroxine while
intubate and switched to PO home levothyroxine.

7. Chronic Back Pain: Placed on fentanyl while in the ICU.
Switched to home dose methadone and oral morphine when
extubated. On transfer to floor, morphine was held for
oversedation with adequate control with home methadone

8. Anxiety / Depression: Restarted clonazepam and home
mirtazapine

Goals of Care: Though previous d/c summaries state pt is
DNR/DNI, code status was clarified with family who confirm he is
full code. Palliative care followed him during this hospital
stay.
