Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2356**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion, pericardial/pleural effusions, CDiff

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis X2

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known firstname 4134**] [**Known lastname 16479**] is a 65 year old female with a history of
HTN, hyperparathyroidism, and hypothyroidism who was recently
discharged from the [**Hospital1 18**] Cardiology Medicine service where she
had been treated for pericarditis, presumed viral etiology. Her
hospital course was complicated by frequent episodes of AVnRT
(started on diltiazem), community acquired pneumonia (completed
course of azithromycin and ceftriaxone), and C. difficile
colitis (started on metronidazole). Her bilateral pleural
effusions were also tapped during that admission.
.
The patient was transferred from [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**] for worsening
shortness of breath, bilateral shoulder and neck pain X2 days.
The patient had been sent there by her cardiologist, who saw her
in clinic and found her to be tachycardic. On ultrasound in
clinic, she had a small pericardial effusion but generally poor
"squeeze" concerning for congestive heart failure.
.
In the ED, initial vital signs were pain T 97.7, HR 114, BP
114/77, RR 17, O2 sat 97%. Exam was negative for friction rub,
jugular venous distension, distant heart sounds. Pulsus
paradoxus has remained stable at 6-7. She received morphine (1mg
IV), zofran (4mg IV), intravenous fluids and was started on
Vancomycin/Cefepime with improvement. Was also started on PO
Vancomycin and switched to IV Flagyl.
.
Upon arrival to the floor, the patient was resting more
comfortably in bed with no complaints.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of
stroke/TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism,
myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, fevers/chills. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
*** Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest
pain, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Physical Exam:
Discharge Physical Exam:

VS:  T95.8, BP 131/68, HR 92, RR20, 94% RA
Gen: Well-developed, cachectic woman in NAD. Alert and oriented
X3. Mood and affect appropriate - slightly anxious.
HEENT: NCAT. Sclera anicteric. EOMI. Dry mucus membranes, normal
oro/nasopharynx.
Neck: Soft, supple without JVD
CV: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
Tachycardia, regular, normal S1/S2. No murmurs/gallops. No
friction rub.
Chest: Anterior chest wall deformity. Respirations unlabored, no
accessory muscle use but slightly uneven. CTAB. No
wheezing/rhonchi/rales but mild left basilar crackles.
Abd: Soft, non-tender, non-distended. +bowel sounds. No HSM or
tenderness.
Ext: No cyanosis, edema. Scattered ecchymosis of bilateral upper
extremities.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, or xanthomas.
Pulses:  Right: DP 2+ PT 2+  ; Left: DP 2+ PT 2+

Pertinent Results:
ECG: Sinus tachycardia, low voltage, no electrical alternans.
.
CXR (my read):  Significant left costophrenic angle blunting
suggestive of effusion vs. consolidation - more likely the
former given meniscus. ?wedge on lateral view suggestive of
lobar pneumonia.
.
[**2107-7-8**] TTE (prelim): The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The number of
aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. No mitral regurgitation is seen. Stranding
is visualized within the pericardial space c/w organization.
[**2107-6-29**] TTE: Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). with borderline normal free wall function. There is
a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs
of tamponade.
.
CT torso: 1. No evidence of acute pulmonary embolism within the
main, lobar or
segmental branches of the pulmonary arteries bilaterally.
Evaluation of the
subsegmental pulmonary arteries is limited secondary to bolus
timing.

2. Moderate-sized pericardial effusion with interval increase in
enhancement
of the pericardium suggestive of pericarditis.

3. Ground-glass opacity in the left apex again identified and
may be
infectious in nature. Followup to resolution is recommended.
Large right and
moderate left-sided pleural effusion with adjacent compressive
atelectasis.

4. Multiple low-density lesions within the kidneys bilaterally
which most
likely represent renal cysts. Confirmation may be obtained with
renal
ultrasound when the patient is clinically able.
.
C-spine films:
1. Sclerotic C6 vertebral body of unclear etiology. Correlate
with MRI.
Multilevel discogenic disease with secondary degenerative
changes and
multilevel neural foraminal narrowing. MRI would be more helpful
to further
assess.
.
CXR: 1. Bilateral stable moderate pleural effusions with
associated bibasilar
dependent atelectasis.

2. Subtle ground-glass opacity at the left lung apex, new since
last CXR,
but evident on recent CT, could suggest early developing focus
of infection.

3. Cardiac silhouette is suboptimally evaluated due to summation
of shadows
with pleural effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
65 year old woman with history of hypertension, hypothyroidism,
hyperparathyroidism and recent pericarditis, felt likely viral,
s/p drainage of pleural effusion (pericardial effusion not
drained) and CDiff infection who presents with dyspnea on
exertion and returning pleural effusions.

# Pleural Effusions: Patient arrived with SOB and CXR revealed
pleural effusion bilaterally.  Each side was tapped on different
days and patient was symptomatically better and hypoxia
resolved.  Pulmonary, ID, and Rheumatology were consulted but no
clear diagnosis was made.  She was started on a prednisone taper
which will be managed by her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] will be following up
with her as an outpatient.

# Leukocytosis: On admission, patient had a WBC of 40.0.
Initially it was thought to have been contributed by prior
C.Diff infection. Was initially on broad spectrum abx and was
ultimately placed on 250mg PO Vanco QID for a 14 day course.
Hematology/Oncology was consulted, however no concrete diagnosis
was made. Hematology/Oncology is interested in following up with
her in one month. Will need repeat CBC prior to appointment.

# AVnRT: Patient developed with AVnRT to during last admission
and was placed on diltiazem. Patient had intermittent AVnRT
episodes but remained stable and was discharged on her home
dose.

# Diarrhea: Patient experienced daily loose green BM for
multiple days. Initially it was thought that she redeveloped
C.diff, as she had a corresponding WBC. However stool analysis
was negative for C.diff toxins. Colchicine was then discontinued
and the diarrhea subsided.

# Hematuria: On U/A, patient had microscopic blood. No further
investigation was completed at th
