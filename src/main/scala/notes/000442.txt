Pertinent Results:
TEE [**2157-12-28**]:
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinetic apical
segments.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The mitral
valve leaflets do not fully coapt and bileaflet restriction is
appreciated. There is a central MR jet with Moderate to severe
(3+) mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
POSTBYPASS:
The patient is AV paced on epinephrine & phenylephrine
infusions. There is a well seated annuloplasty ring in the
mitral position. The Mitral regurgitation is now trace to mild.
The RV function is maintained. The LV function is mildly
improved on inotropy, with EF 50%. The remaining valves are
unchanged. The aorta remains intact.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was transferred from [**Hospital6 3105**] on
[**2156-12-26**].  She underwent preop testing including PFTs, Echo, and
dental consult.  On [**2157-12-28**] she had a mitral valve repair with a
28mm annuloplasty ring.  The cross clamp time was 38 minutes
and the total bypass time was 51 minutes. She tolerated the
procedure well and was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition on Propofol.  She was extubated on the post op night
and had her chest tubes discontinued on POD#1.

She was transferred to the floor but had to return to the CVICU
that night for hyperglycemia requiring an insulin drip.  She was
restarted on her preop NPH and was stable by the morning of
POD#2.  She was transferred back to the floor in stable
condition. Pacing wires and chest tubes wer removed per protocol
and sh3e was gently diuresed toward her preop weight.

Her glucoses remained somewhat problem[**Name (NI) 115**] and the 70/30 insulin
was downwardly adjusted to compensate.  The evening dose was
discontinued.  In conversation she says at home she snacks at
night and that is perhaps why her Morning glucoses in house have
been low. the glucoses the morning after stopping evening NPH
dosing her glucoses were in the mid 100s- the insulin can be
adjusted at rehab as her intake changes.

She continued to make good progress and was cleared for
discharge to [**Location (un) 16493**]rehab in N. [**Location (un) 7658**] on POD 8.  All
follow up appointments were arranged.
