Chief Complaint:
Transfer from [**Hospital3 **] for pulmonary edema

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 81 y/o M with an extensive history of severe AS,
CAD s/p stent placement in [**10-13**] and [**9-12**], DM, and CHF, and PAD
s/p stent placemnt who presented to [**Hospital6 3105**] on
[**2173-11-5**] with flash pulmonary edema. Mr. [**Known lastname **] had been discharged
from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2173-10-30**] after a cardiac catheterization and BMS
placement to the LCx and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 3 to the LAD arteries. Since
discharge, Mr. [**Known lastname **] followed up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in his clinic and
was noted to have an elevated systolic blood pressure and was
subsequently started on Lisinopril (dose unknown).
On Friday [**11-5**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was lying supine in bed and suddenly
became dyspneic. Soon after, Mr. [**Known lastname **] had worsening dyspnea while
standing and had "gurgily" breath sounds. EMS was called by pt's
son and patient's respiratory status declined. He was intubated
in the field and taken by ambulance to [**Hospital3 19345**]. His field O2 sats are unclear.
On arrival to the ER, patient's SBP was > 230 and was intubated.
He was transferred to the floor for further medical management.
Pt was diuresed and started on a nitro gtt for BP control. Pt
had a temp > 101 at OSH and was started on IV Ceftriaxone.
Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. Upon
arriving to floor, patient's VS were 101.8, 113, 141/65, 84, 22,
97% 4L NC.


Past Medical History:

TEE [**11-11**]: No vegetations found. Depressed left ventricular
function. Severe aortic stenosis. Complex atheroma in the
ascending aorta and descending thoracic aorta.

Renal US [**11-9**]:
1. Bilateral simple renal cysts. No hydronephrosis. 1-cm
angiomyolipoma in the left kidney.
2. Mildly elevated RIs bilaterally suggest of renal parenchymal
disease.
3. Bilateral tardus parvus waveforms of the main renal arteries.
Ultrasound cannot exclude bilateral renal artery stenosis.

CXR [**11-7**]: The current study demonstrates mild-to-moderate
cardiomegaly, unchanged compared to the prior study. The
previously demonstrated interstitial edema currently has been
progressed involving both interstitium and alveolar space. There
is also increase in left retrocardiac atelectasis and bilateral
pleural effusions. The left subclavian line tip is at the
junction of brachiocephalic vein and SVC.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 81 year old chinese speaking gentleman with CAD
w/BMS and DES, AS, presenting as OSH transfer in diastolic CHF
in context of severe AS.

Acute on Chronic diastolic heart failure:  Patient presented to
OSH with SBPs > 230 and flash pulmonary edema and was intubated.
Patient was diursed and maintained on nitrolycerin drip. Pt was
extubated prior to transfer and on arrival SBP on was 142. Pt
was continued on nitro gtt and transitioned to PO
antihypertensives with metoprolol and hydralazine. Pt was also
restarted on his home lasix and remained euvolemic for the
remainder of the hospital course.

Coronary Artery Disease: Patient with 2v disease, s/p BMS in LCx
and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 3 in LAD one week ago. Patient with EKG changes (ST
depressions in precordial lateral leads) suggestive of demand
ischemia, with old RBBB. Patient was throught at OSH to be
having NSTEMI, and was started on heparin gtt. Patient's enzymes
were flat at OSH, however Trop at [**Hospital1 18**] was 0.93. This elevation
in troponin is likely related to subendocardial ischemia in the
setting of increased demand. Pt had GI bleeding in setting of
elevated PTT, and so heparin stopped and pt was transfused 1u
pRBCs. Here pt was medically managed with aspirin, plavis,
atorvastatin and beta-blocker. ACE inhibitor was held due to
renal failure.

Severe Aortic stenosis: Last echo [**10-13**] showed severe AS of 0.8.
Hypertensive urgency in setting of Severe AS likely precipitated
CHF, with dietary indescretions.

MSSA Bacteremia: Pt found to be febrile, pancultured and found
to have MSSA bacteremia. He was started on Nafcillin and PICC
line was placed for outpt antibiotics. Pt had a TEE negative for
vegetations and will thus require at 2-4 weeks of antibiotics
course. He will be seen by ID in 2 weeks at which point
remainder of course will be determiend.

HTN: Blood pressures were poorly controlled and pt initially
required nitroglycerin drip. Goal SBP given AS is 130-150.
Changed home regimen to beta-blocker and hydralazine with good
control. Pt was extensively counseled on need for low sodium
diet.

DM II: Oral medications were held and pt controlled with lantus
and insulin sliding scale.

Chronic Lymphoblastic Leukemia: The patient remained stable with
a mild anemia and thrombocytosis.

Dyslipidemia: Continued on atorvastatin

Peptic Ulcer Disaese: Continued on home pantoprazole.
