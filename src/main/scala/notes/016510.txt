HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old man
with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction,
aortic valve replacement times 2, congestive heart failure,
atrial fibrillation, type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
and benign prostatic hypertrophy with indwelling Foley who
presented to the hospital on [**2124-3-13**] with blood in his Foley
catheter. The patient was ill-feeling with increased lower
abdominal pain and pressure.  He also reported a fever,
shortness of breath as well as chest pain.  The patient was
found to be in rapid atrial fibrillation at 150 beats per
minute in acute respiratory distress with a fever up to 104.
The patient was begun on IV Levaquin, was given Tylenol PR as
well as sublingual nitroglycerin, Solu-Medrol and breathing
treatments, nitropaste and was begun on a cardizem drip for
rate control.  Additionally, the patient had a bladder scan
which showed a markedly distended bladder.   A new Foley was
placed in and 1300 cc of urine was then obtained.  The chest
pain resolved and his heart rate was controlled with a
Cardizem drip.  Urinalysis in the hospital showed the urine
to be red, opaque with moderate leukocytes, positive
nitrates, large blood, greater than 300 protein.  His CBC at
the hospital showed a white blood cell count of 4.8 with a
hematocrit of 35.7 and platelets of 300.  At this point, the
patient was transferred to the [**Hospital6 2018**].  CBC on arrival showed a significantly increased
white blood cell count at 23.2 with a bandemia, 64 polys, 36
bands as well as UA consistent with urinary tract infection.
The patient continued to be in atrial fibrillation and was
weight controlled on a Diltiazem drip.   While in the MICU,
the patient significantly improved with no chest pain and
decreased shortness of breath and, therefore, was called out
to the medical service on [**2124-3-15**].

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a previous 100 pack year
history of smoking.  He quit in [**2115**].  He has an occasional
alcoholic beverage, approximately 3 drinks per week.  He
lives in a retirement home with his wife.  However, he is
looking into [**Hospital3 **] in [**State 1727**] closer to his daughter.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On transfer to the Medical Floor,
vital signs were 98.1, blood pressure was 112/50, heart rate
is 80, Respiratory rate is 18, 92% on 3 liters nasal cannula.
In general, the patient is a pleasant elderly man in no
apparent distress.  Head, ears, eyes, nose and throat:
Anicteric, moist mucus membranes, extraocular movements are
intact, pupils, equal, regular, and react to light and
accommodation, difficult to assess jugular venous distention
secondary to tremor.  Chest: With a diffuse rhonchi at lower
lobes bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:  Irregularly irregular
with a III/VI systolic ejection murmur heard best at the
right upper sternal border with mechanical valve opening and
closing appreciated secondary to the patient's mechanical
aortic valve with a rate in the 80's. Abdomen: Soft and
nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds.
Extremities: No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  No calf
tenderness.  Neurological:  Alert and oriented times 3.
Mentating appropriately.

LABORATORY DATA:  On transfer, white blood cell count was
9.4, hematocrit was 30.9, platelets 233, PT was 22.2, PT-T
was 51.5, INR was 3.3.  Electrolytes: Sodium 137, potassium
4.9, chloride 102, bicarb 28, BUN 35, creatinine 1.1, glucose
96, CK was 62 with troponin of less than 0.3, digoxin level
was 1.2.  Blood culture from [**2124-3-14**] grew gram positive cocci
in pairs and chains and the urine culture from [**2124-3-13**] grew
enterococcus and the sensitivities were pending.  Blood
cultures from [**2124-3-15**] were negative to date at that point.

PERTINENT STUDIES:  On [**2124-3-13**], a chest x-ray showed bibasilar
opacities, significant for aspiration versus infection.  On
[**2124-3-14**], chest x-ray showed significant improvement of the
right lower lobe lesser extent in the left lower lobe.

IMPRESSION:  This is a 75-year-old male with type II diabetes
mellitus, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure,
and benign prostatic hypertrophy presenting with urosepsis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Infectious disease:  The patient was initially started in
the hospital on Levaquin IV.  Vancomycin was added to this
regimen on [**2124-3-15**] for further coverage of the enterococcus.
Both the urine culture and the blood cultures from [**3-14**] and 5th grew out enterococcus which was resistant to
Levaquin, therefore, due to the fact that the patient is
allergic to penicillin, he was unable to be started on
ampicillin and vancomycin was the drug of choice.  He was
continued on vancomycin throughout his stay. The patient
remained afebrile and his white blood cell count trended down
throughout his stay.  Blood cultures from [**3-16**] and
7th remained negative throughout.

The patient had a PIC line placed due to the fact that he
would need long term antibiotic therapy.  Furthermore, both
transthoracic echocardiogram as well as transesophageal
echocardiogram were performed in order to evaluate the
patient's mechanical aortic valve for potential vegetation
subsequent to being bacteremic for approximately 24 to 48
hours.  Both studies were negative for any vegetation and,
therefore, the patient will be discharged on a total of 3
week course of vancomycin IV.

2.  Cardiovascular:  The patient did have multiple brief
episodes of chest pain during his stay.  All episodes were
well controlled with nitroglycerin sublingual and no further
electrocardiogram changes were identified.  After his weight
was well controlled with the Diltiazem drip, the patient was
just restarted on his Verapamil and continued on that for the
remainder of the day.  His calcium channel blocker aspirin
and Coumadin were also continued.  The Coumadin was given
based on the goal INR being 1.8 to 2.2.  As previously
mentioned, both PTE and PEE were performed revealing no
evidence of any vegetation on the mechanical aortic valve.
PEE did reveal a small paravalvular leak, normal left
ventricular size and function, normal right ventricular size
was functioned moderately decreased. The mitral valve was
found to be calcified with 2+ mitral regurgitation and the
prosthetic aortic valve with mechanical leafle
