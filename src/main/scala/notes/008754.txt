Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tracheostomy
Percutaneous Endogastric tube
Intubation and extubation


History of Present Illness:
70 y/o F with PMHx of severe COPD and recent NSTEMI who was
transferred in from rehab due to increased SOB over the prior
3-4 days. This am, she was noted to have low sats in 70% which
did not respond to nebs. Her sats came up with high flow O2 in
the EMS. Pt denied any cough, increased sputum, chest pain or
pedal edema. She was notably wheezey on presentation and was
initially treated as COPD exacerbation.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.6 BP 146/70 HR 147 RR 20 Sats
96% on RA. Patient was given solumedrol 125mg, nebs &
levofloxacin for LLL infiltrate seen on CXR. On re-evaluation,
pt was lethargic and desatting into the 70s. Pt was intubated
for respiratory failure and received ceftriaxone and vancomycin
for presumed PNA. Pt was noted to have sbps in 80s
peri-intubation and received a total of 6L of IVF. Pt had a Tmax
of 103.8 in the ED, though lactate was normal at 1.7. Pt was
transferred to the ICU on versed/fentanyl and dopamine to
maintain SBPs.
.
On arrival, pt was intubated and sedated though following
commands. She reported some chest pain but was otherwise
comfortable and sating 100% on the vent.

.
CXR: [**2158-2-12**] IMPRESSION: Focal consolidation in the left
peripheral mid lung superimposed on changes of emphysema. This
is consistent with pneumonia.
.
CXR: [**2158-2-25**] IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to 7:12 p.m.
Nasogastric tube ends in the upper portion of a nondistended
stomach. Although the tip of the ET tube is less than 2 cm from
the carina and the chin is down, this is only 1 cm below optimal
placement. Right PIC line ends at the junction of the
brachiocephalic veins. Residual of pneumonia in the left mid
lung has been stable for several days. Small bilateral pleural
effusion has increased slightly since earlier in the day, and
there is pulmonary vascular redistribution but no edema. Heart
size is normal. Thoracic configuration
indicates COPD.
.
A region of scar-like opacity in the axillary portion of the
right mid lung is more radiodense than it was earlier in [**2157**]
and largely new since [**2156-10-4**]. This could also be
post-inflammatory, but is concerning for possible malignancy.
Followup is advised clinically indicated, with chest CT, which
can be compared to the CTPA on [**2157-11-19**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 40583**] and
I discussed these findings at the time of dictation.
.
IMPRESSION: Little overall change.
.
CXR: [**2158-2-27**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-27**],
the tracheostomy tube and PICC line remain in place.
Hyperinflation of the lungs is again seen consistent with
chronic pulmonary disease. Extensive areas of scarring persist.
More focal opacifications laterally in the mid lung zone on both
the right and left are again seen. No evidence of pneumothorax.
.
Echo: [**2158-2-27**]: Conclusions
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.  Compared with the prior study
(images reviewed) of [**2157-11-21**], regional and global left
ventricular systolic function are improved. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now slightly higher.
Based on [**2156**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.
.
ECG: Sinus rhythm. Left bundle-branch block with secondary
repolarization
abnormaliites. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2158-2-19**] no
diagnostic
change.
