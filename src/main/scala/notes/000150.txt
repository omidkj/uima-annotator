Findings
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. Bidirectional shunt
across the interatrial septum at rest. Large secundum ASD.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal regional LV systolic function. Overall
normal LVEF (>55%). No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Mildly dilated
aortic sinus. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient.
Conclusions
Prebypass

1. There is a bidirectional shunt across the interatrial septum
at rest. A large secundum atrial septal defect is present.

2. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).

3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.

4. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. There
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

5. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.

6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.

7. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on
[**2201-1-28**] at 900am.

Post Bypass

1. Patient is A paced and receiving an infusion of
phenylephrine.

2. Biventricular systolic function is unchanged.

3. Small residual flow across the interatrial septum at the site
of the pledgets is seen. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] made aware.

4. Aorta intact post decannulation.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2201-1-28**]
where he underwent CABG x 3 and closure of ASD.  The patient
received vancomycin for perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis
because he was inpatient 24hours prior to surgery.  Overall the
patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for further
recovery and invasive monitoring.  By POD 1 the patient was
extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.  He was
hemodynamically stable and neurologically intact.  He did
develop some rapid atrial fibrillation in the 120s.  This was
managed with amiodarone and beta blockers, and the patient would
convert to sinus rhythm.  He was transferred to the step down
unit where he made excellent progress with physical therapy,
showing good strength and mobility prior to discharge.  Chest
tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
The patient was discharged home on POD 4.
