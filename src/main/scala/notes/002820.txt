Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization

Right IJ line

History of Present Illness:
67M h/o HTN, seizure disorder, inferior NSTEMI ([**2150**]) with
unsucessful PTCA of RCA (TIMI I flow), thoracic AAA repair
complicated by cardiac arrest/femoral artery repair ([**2150**]), who
presents to [**Location (un) **] @ 1407 [**2158-12-18**] after increasing chest pain /
shortness of breath x several days. He reports no chest pain
until about 9 days ago when he had one of the worst seizures he
has had in a long time.  After that he reports that it felt as
though he had a pressure on his chest. He continued to do push
up and other exercising, but could not do as many given the
pain. He took garlic which helped relieve his pain until today
when it became unbearable. His pain was [**5-15**] on arrival to the
OSH. VS=98.0  78  24  103/78  88%RA.  Trop 5.59 at OSH, noted to
have 1.5mm anterior STE in v2-v4, CXR concerning for widened
medisteinum.  Rythym was initially regular, then noted to be in
"heart block" on nursing flow with BP 80/58 at 1700 after
receiving nitro, ativan 1mg, asa, lopressor 25mg po @ 1600,
lasix 20mg x 1.  Per report given 600cc IVF bolus without
benefit.  Pt transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath.
.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], pt found to have proximal LAD occlusion,
with incomplete revascularization after POBA, and was started on
IABP [**1-6**] hypotension. A foley was placed tramatically and he
developed hematuria.
.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain
currently, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.


Past Medical History:

filling defect consistent with thrombus was present.  Mild
left to right collaterals observed.  Intervention with
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and angio-jet,
thrombectomy of the distal RCA was unsuccessful.  large aortic
aneursym noted.

Cath [**12-18**]:
COMMENTS:     1.  Selective coronary angiography in this right
dominant
patient revealed two vessel CAD. The LMCA had a distal taper.
The LAD
had moderate proximal calcification and a ostial occlusion with
faint
filling by collaterals.  The large LCX was without critical
lesions.
The RCA was occluded mid-segment with distal vessel filling via
left to
right collaterals.  The RCA was felt to be chronically occluded.

2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevation of PCWP with mean
wedge of
31mmHG.  The cardiac index was low at 1.9.  We did not obtain RA
or RV
pressures but the PA pressure was elevated at 48/28.  The
hemodynamics
were consistent with cardiogenic shock.
3.  Placement of IABP via RFA for cardiogenic shock.
4.  Balloon angioplasty of origin and proximal LAD with 3mm
balloon
resulting in TIMI 2 flow.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Anterior MI of greater than 24 hour duration
3. Cardiogenic shock with placement of IABP
4. Successful POBA of ostial LAD.
.
CXR [**12-19**]:
IMPRESSION: Tip of the aortic balloon pump 2.2 cm from the
aortic arch. Although it appears somewhat lateral, this is
likely due to the patient positioning. Recommend close attention
to patient positioning on any subsequent followup exams.
.
TTE [**12-19**]:
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. There is severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with akinesis of the anterior wall, septum and apex,
as well as basal and mid-inferolateral wall (c/w multivessel
coronary disease). There is moderate hypokinesis of the
remaining segments (LVEF = 15-20%). There is a large left
ventricular thrombus, layering along the distal anterior and
lateral walls and apex. The clot is mural and not mobile. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with normal free wall
contractility. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. There is mild mitral regurgitation. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with severe regional and
global left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w multivessel
CAD. Large left ventricular mural thrombus.
Compared with the report of prior study (images not available
for review) of [**2151-1-14**], anterior/anteroseptal wall motion
abnormalities are new, and left ventircular function has
deteriorated. Left ventricular thrombus is new.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 67-year-old man with a past medical history
significant for hypertension, seizure disorder, inferior NSTEMI
in [**2150**] with unsuccessful PTCA of the RCA (TIMI I flow), who
presents with a late LAD STEMI s/p cardiac catheterization with
unsuccessful PTCA complicated by cardiogenic shock, now
resolved.
