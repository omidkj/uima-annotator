Brief Hospital Course:
40 year-old woman presents with fever, headache,
photosensitivity, and neck stiffness.  LP performed revealing
elevated WBC in CSF consistent with meningitis viral more likely
than bacterial.  Vancomycin and Chrlorampenicol started to cover

meningitis.  The patient underwent desensitization to
cephlasporins and was transitioned to Cefepime.  Dexamethasone
was also started for meningitis, but only given for one day.
Vancomycin and Cefepime were discontinued after CSF cultures
were no growth for 48 hours.  HSV PCR was positive and treatment
plan determined for meningitis--Acyclovir IV for 3 week course.
