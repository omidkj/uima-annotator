shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 108213**] is an 81 year old male with a history of COPD and end
stage pulmonary fibrosis on 4-8L oxygen at home who presents
with three weeks of progressive dyspnea on exertion with acute
worsening on the day of presentation. The patient reports that
over the past six months there has been a progressive worsening
of his functional status which has been more steeply declining
over the past three weeks. One week ago he had an isolated fever
to 101 degrees and restarted cefpodoxime per his pulmonologist
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2171**]. Over the past week he has been able to move slowly
around his house and gets short of breath with minimal exertion.
His baseline oxygen saturations range from 70s to 90s on 4 to 8
L nasal canula. On the day of presentation he felt that his
breathing acutely worsened. He does not have chest pain or chest
tightness. He denies palpitations. He has felt chills but no
documented fevers. He denies sore throat but endorses
congestion. Mild body aches. He has mild increase in his sputum
production and mildly worsening cough. On the day of
presentation he had mild hemoptysis (pink sputum) which he
attributed to aspirin use. He called his pulmonologist who
discussed the possibility of transitioning his care to hospice
but he decided to present for evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T: 98.4 BP: 115/54 P: 112 R: 20 O2
sat 80% on 8L. He received vancomycin 1 gram IV and ceftazidime
1 gram IV. EKG showed sinus tachycardia at 108, normal axis,
normal intervals, no acute ST segment changes, poor baseline.
Chest xray showed possible increased haziness of the right
hemidiaphragm on a baseline of significant fibrotic changes. He
was admitted to the MICU for further management.
.
On arrival to the MICU he reports that his breathing is
significantly improved on non-rebreather. Denies fevers but
endorses, chills, no night sweats, does endorse weight loss but
can't quantify Denies headache, sinus tenderness but endorses
mild congestion. rhinorrhea. Denied chest pain or tightness,
palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or
abdominal pain. No recent change in bowel or bladder habits. No
dysuria. Denied arthralgias or myalgias.

CXR: In comparison with the study of [**11-7**], there is little
overall
change. Extensive chronic fibrosis is again seen bilaterally
with more focal areas of opacification in the right mid zone and
left lower lung. Relative hyperlucency of the upper lungs is
consistent with the known history of emphysema. Although these
findings most likely represent chronic disease, the possibility
of supervening pneumonia would be extremely difficult to detect
radiographically.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Respiratory Failure: patient was admitted with acute
shortness of breath and acute decompensation of his end-stage
lung disease. He had increased sputum production, mild
leukocytosis with left shift and subjective chills. CXR with
mild increased haziness at right hemidiaphragm. Progression of
underlying lung disease felt more likely than other possible
etiologies. Cardiac etiology unlikely given lack of chest pain
or EKG changes. Started on vancomycin, cefepime, azithromycin
and tamiflu in an effort to treat any potential contributing
infections. Nebulizers were continued, and he was continued on
his prednisone 60mg daily. Patient was also started on MS Contin
for dyspnea as well.

2. Goals of Care: As this patient was struggling with end-stage
disease and was approaching the end of life palliative care was
consulted to assist with providing for this patient's care and
assuring focus on his goals of care. Morphine was provided for
respiratory discomfort as above. Hospice options were discussed
with the patient and his family. He was discharged with home
services with the possibility of a bridge to hospice.

3. Respiratory Discomfort: As above, will continue to treat
whatever is treatable and attempt to improve this patient's
underlying pulmonary function, however prognosis is very poor
and patient is increasingly having epidodes of what sound like
considerable respiratory distress, stating how terrible it feels
to not be able to breath. Per discussions previously documented
we will do all we can to help make this patient as comfortable
as possible through these episodes.
-morphine, prn, for respiratory distress and related anxiety
-consider ativan, prn, if needed
-will follow up with palliative more tomorrow

4. Stage III Chronic Kidney Disease: Creatinine below baseline
at 1.4. Continued to hydrate and renally dose medications.

5. Coronary Artery Disease: s/p angioplasty many years ago.
Currently no signs of ischemia on EKG. Held aspirin given some
report of hemoptysis.

5. GERD: Stable. Continued on omeprazole 20 mg [**Hospital1 **].

6. Hypercholesterolemia: Continued on Crestor 40 mg daily.

7. Depression: Continued on Celexa 20 mg daily

8. Steroid Induced Hyperglycemia: Continued on lantus with
humalog sliding scale with good overall control.

9. Prostate Cancer: In remission. Continued on tamsulosin 0.4 mg
