CXR [**1-29**]
INDICATION: 85-year-old woman status post aortic valve
replacement. Evaluate effusions.

COMPARISON: [**2166-1-26**].

FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST: A left-sided pacemaker with leads are
in unchanged positions. The patient is status post median
sternotomy. Skin staples remain in place. The cardiac and
mediastinal contours are similar in appearance. The lungs remain
clear with minor atelectasis in the left base. There is a small
left-sided pleural effusion that appears roughly similar
compared to the prior study. Pulmonary vascularity remains
within normal limits. Hardware in the right humerus is
unchanged. The thoracic spine demonstrates extensive
degenerative change with a marked kyphosis.

IMPRESSION: Small left-sided pleural effusion and minimal left
basilar atelectasis.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA
and extending into the RV. Left-to-right shunt across the
interatrial septum
at rest. Small secundum ASD.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal regional LV systolic function. Overall
normal LVEF
(>55%). No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in
aortic root. Mildly dilated ascending aorta. Simple atheroma in
ascending
aorta. Normal aortic arch diameter. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the
aortic arch. Normal descending aorta diameter. There are complex
(>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Severely
thickened/deformed aortic
valve leaflets. Severe AS (AoVA <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral
annular calcification. Mild MS (MVA 1.5-2.0cm2). Moderate (2+)
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild
[1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
Physiologic
(normal) PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the
procedure. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Results
were personally

Conclusions:
PreBypass

1. A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen
at rest. A
small secundum atrial septal defect is present.

2. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).

3.Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.

4.The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple
atheroma in the
ascending aorta. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic
arch. There
are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

5.There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (area
<0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.

6. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
mild mitral
stenosis (area 1.5-2.0cm2). Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
is seen.

7. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.

Post Bypass

1. Patient is receiving an infusion of phenylephrine.

2. Bioprosthetic valve seen in the aortic position. Leaflets
move well
(demonstrated on deep gastric views) and valve appears well
seated. Peak
gradient across the aortic valve is 30 mm Hg. Trace aortic
insufficiency.

3. Moderate mitral regurgitation persists.

4. Aorta intact post decannulation.

5. Biventricular systolic function is unchanged

DIAGNOSIS:

Aortic valve leaflets:

Valve leaflets with extensive calcifications.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization [**1-17**] which
revealed: calcified LM, 70% prox. LAD, 70% prox LCX. heavily
calcified RCA, tr. MR, and an EF of 60%.  She had aortic
stenosis with an AV gradient of 44 and [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.71 cm2.  Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] was consulted and then a dental consult recommended
extraction of 7 teeth.  She underwent extraction of 7 teeth on
[**1-19**], and on [**1-20**] she had AVR(19mm Mosaic tissue
valve)/CABGx1(LIMA->LAD).  The cross clamp time was 86 mins.,
total bypass time 115 mins.  Please see operative report for
further details.  She tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred to the CSRU in stable condition on Neo and Propof
