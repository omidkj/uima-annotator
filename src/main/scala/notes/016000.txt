History of Present Illness:
72 y/o woman with recently diagnosed cirrhosis and hemolytic
anemia complicated by acute cerebellar hemorrhage now transfered
to MICU for further workup and treatmenyt.
.
In [**2192-2-24**], during a routine nephrology visit for her CRI
she was found to have jaundice. Labs showed: AST 102, ALT 62,
thrombocytopenia, and indirect hyperbilirubinemia, with tbili
7.7, Indirect bili 5.5, haptoglobin < 20 and hct 24-26. She was
diagnosed with cryptogenic cirrhosis and hemolytic anemia;
outpatient workup by her PCP and hematology including negative
Hep serologies, [**Doctor First Name **] <1:40, -ANCA, low C3/C4 and including
negative cold agglutinins and negative combs test was
unrevealing. She underwent an outpatient BM biopsy was
complicated by bleeding requiring a transfusion.
.
She was admitted to [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**2192-5-4**] with
hypotension (60s systolic); which responded to fluid/PRBC
resucsitation. Her course was complicated by an NSTEMI (medical
managagement, preserved EF per echo). CT of her abdomen showed
liver nodularity suggestive of cirrhosis. Her INR was 2.0. She
was discharged with follow up, but re-presented to the ED dizzy
the next day ([**5-7**]) and was then transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
work up at the request of her PCP.

IMAGING:
.
CXR [**5-9**]: clear
.
ABD US [**5-9**]: 1. Echogenic liver consistent with fatty
infiltration. Please note that other forms of liver disease and
more advanced liver disease including significant hepatic
fibrosis and cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study. Simple
cyst. 2. Cholelithiasis without evidence for cholecystitis. 3.
Small amount of ascites. 4. Previously identified (per patient)
5cm abdominal aortic aneurysm. Recommend comparison with prior
studies to evaluate for stability. Surgical consult should be
considered.
.
CT HEAD [**2193-5-11**]
There is a 3.6 x 2.0-cm well circumscribed hyperdense focus at
the superior aspect of the cerebellar vermis, above the fourth
ventricle. This likely represents a subdural hematoma, although
an intraparenchymal component cannot be excluded. There is
associated vasogenic edema.
There is no compression noted of the fourth ventricle or the
cerebellopontine cisterns. Prominence of the extra-axial CSF
spaces is likely due to age-related involutional changes. There
is no evidence of other hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, mass, shift
of midline structures, or large vascular territory infarction.
No
fractures are seen in the skull. Small amount of mucosal
thickening is seen in the left ethmoidal/sphenoidal region. The
orbits are unremarkable. Vascular calcifications are noted in
the cavernous carotid arteries.
IMPRESSION: Acute hemorrhage at the superior aspect of the
cerebellar vermis in the midline likely represents subdural
hematoma although possible intraparenchymal component cannot be
excluded. There is associated vasogenic edema. Currently there
is no compression on the fourth ventricle or the
cerebellopontine cisterns.
.
CT HEAD: [**2193-5-12**]
The known hyperdense collection along the cerebellar vermis is
unchanged compared to the initial CT from [**Month/Day/Year 13835**] 27 hours
prior, measuring 3.7 x 2.1 cm. Again the focus is at the
superior aspect of the cerebellar vermis and likely represents
subdural hematoma. There is mild associated vasogenic edema. No
evidence of
hydrocephalus. The remaining brain parenchyma is within normal
limits. Age-related involutional changes are again noted.
IMPRESSION: Unchanged subdural hematoma along the cerebellar
vermis with associated edema. No new hemorrhage.
.
MR HEAD: [**2192-5-14**]
FINDINGS: There is an [**Month/Day/Year 13835**] 40 x 22 mm intraparenchyma
hematoma in the cerebellar vermis along with surrounding edema.
There is no apparent enhancement within this lesion, and there
are no apparent underlying lesions. Followup MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 13835**]
one month after the resolution of the hematoma would be helpful
to confirm the absence of underlying pathology. There are
several small high T2 signal foci in the deep and subcortical
white matter on FLAIR imaging consistent with small vessel
disease. There is T1 hyperintensity in the basal ganglia
suggestive of hepatic insufficiency. There are no incidental
bony or soft tissue abnormalities. CONCLUSION:
Acute cerebellar hematoma with surrounding edema as described
above. There are no apparent areas of enhancement or underlying
lesions, and a followup MRI in one month would be helpful to
assess resolution and also absence of underlying pathology.
.
B/L UE US: [**2192-5-14**]:
Though the history states bilateral upper extremity swelling,
the patient states only swelling focally within the left upper
extremity. There is no evidence of DVT involving either
extremity, there is a focal hematoma medially in the upper left
arm.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
72 y/o woman with HTN, HLP, CRI, COPD, admitted with hemolytic
anemia and decompensated ESLD.
.
On [**5-11**] she developed acute dysarthria; stat head CT showed
acute hemorrhage at the superior aspect of the cerebellar
vermis. She was transferred to the neurology ICU for spontaneous
SDH. She also developed a spontaneous large hematoma in her left
arm. Neurosurgery did not intervene on the SDH, it was stable on
repeat imagining. Vascular did not intervene on arm hematoma,
but recommended reversal of coagulpathy.  She continued to have
falling Hct, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy.
.
Consults included:
Neurology and Neurosurgery (for acute SDH- no intervention)
Rheumatology (for ?vasculitis, thought unlikely),
Hepatology (for cirrhosis, rec outpatient liver f/u, and outpt
EGD)
Hematology (for hemolytic anemia/coagulopathy, thought to be due
to ESLD +/- mild DIC, rec plt goal 80-100, INR goal 1.5-1.7--no
note since [**5-14**])
Vascular surgery- no need to intervene on arm hematoma, rec
reversal of coagulopathy
.
She required multiple transfusions of blood products, including
9 units PRBCs, 11 units
