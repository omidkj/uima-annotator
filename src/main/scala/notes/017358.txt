Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11495**]
Chief Complaint:
AICD firing

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 68 yo male with a PMH of CAD s/p CABG [**2163**] (LIMA->LAD,
SVG->D->OM2 jump graft, SVG->LPDA) with stents to distal and
proximal LCx, s/p VT ablation and AICD implantation [**2-16**], who
presents after his AICD fired 3 times this AM.  The pt was
walking out from his bathroom and tripped and fell (with his
headhitting the mattress), at which time his AICD fired 3 times
over a 6 minute period. He denies associated syncope or
associated CP, SOB, n/v, diaphoresis.  He has been feeling more
weak over the last two weeks and has been unable to use his cane
like normal because of right wrist pain. He initially presented
to [**Hospital **] Hospital and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation.
.
Per EP fellow's note, the pt was recently admitted for stable VT
two days after fem-fem bypass R->L. During that hospitalization
([**7-16**]?), the pt was initially loaded on amiodarone, but this was
subsequently discontinued for concern of toxicity. The threshold
on the pts ICD was changed at that time. However, pt had 4
episodes of ICD discharge for continued stable VT. Therefore,
patient was started on sotalol during previous admission.
.
In the ED the pt was found to have a SBP initially in the 80s
and a HCT of 25 (BL 31).  He was given 2 units of PRBC and his
SBP rose to 110s.  EP interrogated his paecmaker and found the
pt to have had three shocks for what appears to be ATach around
the same rate as his VT (VT lower detection limit is 600ms). He
was given Toprol XL 25 mg po x1 per EP recs as well as [**Month/Year (2) 11573**] 20
mg IVx1 and 1 L NS.
.
Overnight patient received an additional 40 mg of [**Month/Year (2) 11573**] IV with
300 cc of UOP overnight. He was also started on 20 mg of
prednisone for presumed gouty attack. This am he continues to
complain of right wrist pain.  He states that this is similar to
prior gouty attacks. It has been going on for ~ 1 week.  He has
also had fevers as high as 102 in the last week reported by his
visiting nurse. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] dose was also increased approximately
1 month ago from [**Hospital1 **] to TID given increased lower extremity
edema and fluid on the lungs. He does not complain of anything
else but when questioned, he does note that he has been more
weak in the last 2 weeks.  He lives alone and can normally walk
with a cane or walker but has had more difficulty walking around
recently. He notes that he has not been able to use his cane as
he normally would because of his painful wrist. Pt denies
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, increased leg swelling,
orthopnea, subjective fevers, chills. He also denies BRBPR,
melena, focal weakness/numbness.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 68 yo male with a PMH of CAD s/p CABG and PCIs, VT
ablation and AICD implantation [**2-16**], PVD s/p fem-fem bypass with
PTFE graft who presents after AICD firing for atrial tachycardia
found to be anemic, thrombocytopenic, hyponatremic, and now
bacteremic with staph aureus.
.
1) Bacteremia: The patient had persistent high-grade MRSA
bacteremia. He grew bacteria in 4 out of 4 bottles in <24 hours
on admission. Cultures were positive in [**4-14**] bottles for several
days. He initially spiked fevers to 102 but was asymptomatic and
quickly defervesced while on IV Vanc 1gm Q24h. ID was consulted
and followed the patient throughout his hospital course. The
patient was noted to have an open LLE foot ulcer draining
tophaceous material. Swab of this wound grew MRSA representing a
possible source for his bacteremia. [**Date Range **] surgery was
consulted and it was decided to not surgically intervene at the
site. Given his persistent high grade bacteremia a source of
sequestered infection was sought. TTE and TEE did not show
vegetations. The patient's ICD and graft site were visualized by
U/S without any fluid collections found. It is still concerning
that the patient relatively recently had his ICD placed.
Cardiology was contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding this issue. The patient
developed a R wrist, R knee and L 3rd finger swelling and
erythema consistent with either gouty flare or septic joints.
The patient's knee was tapped multiple times and was consistent
with gout with an associated low grade infection growing staph
aureus. The patient's R wrist had a surgical washout by hand
plastics and contained gross crystals and on gram stain
contained gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters. The patient
had a transient decline in his blood pressure which improved
after holding diuresis. At that time, the patient's lactate was
2.8. The patient's left foot was debrided by podiatry. He
finally cleared blood cultures on [**2178-10-11**]. The patient
completed a 5-day course of gentamicin (for synergy) and was
continued on Vanc IV alone, dosed renally. Patient continued to
have an elevated WBC with elevated temperatures despite
treatment with Vancomycin. Other sources of infection were
investigated, included her ICD. His ICD was removed and cultures
of the atrial leads grew coag + staph aureus. This was thought
to be his source of infection and may have triggered his
episodes of VT. He was continued on Vancomycin, per ID reccs,
and will continue this for 6
