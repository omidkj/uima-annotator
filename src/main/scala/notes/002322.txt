dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
81 y old male w/ extensive history CAD s/p AMI at age 37, CABG
in [**2115**] (LIMA-LAD, SVG-PDA, SVG-OM1) with redo in [**2121**] (occuded
LIMA-LAD and SVG-PDA, RIMA-LAD,SVG-PDA, SVG-OM2), DES to OM1 for
NSTEMI in '[**29**], CHF with EF of 20% s/p cardiac resynchronization
and biV ICD, and [**11-20**] admission for SOB and chest tightness in
which he had an echo w/ severe AS with an area of <8 cm2, and
therefore underwent apico-aortic valve conduit placement on
[**2132-12-2**]. Pre-op he had a cath demonstrating patent RIMA -->
LAD, and SVG --> OM2, but occluded SVG --> PDA, but had no
intervention and no bump in enzymes.  Post operatively he was
initially on Amiodarone for ventricular ectopy which resolved
after a few days. He had persistent hypotension and it took
several days to wean him off inotropic support. Coumadin was
started for afib and continued. He was discharged post-operative
day seven.  His discharge VSS were 96/50, 95%, and HR of 71.  He
was d/c'd on [**12-9**] with coumadin and lasix with an eye toward
restarting an ACE inhibitor if his blood pressure improved.
Today pt presented to [**Hospital3 24768**] with shortness of
breath. His BNP was found to be 1152 and CXR showed CHF. He was
given lasix 40 IV x 2 with good urine output. However, his BP
decreased to 76/40 and then increased to 86/60 at time of
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further eal and treatment.
.
Upon presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] hs vitals were BP 85/43, HR 77, RR
18, 96% on 2L, T 97.1.  He reported shortness of breath that
improved with lasix. He reports that the shortness of breath
began this morning gradually. No chest pain.  He is not walking
around much so he denies dyspnea on exertion. He denies PND, but
reports orthopnea. He does not know if his leg swelling is
increasing or decreasing. He does not know if he has had weight
gain or weight loss. He denied lightheadedness, cough, fevers,
chills.

Social History:
The patient lives alone in [**Location (un) 11790**].  Social history is
significant for the absence of current tobacco use though the
patient has a remote smoking history. He reports smoking 1PPD
for 20 years, but quit at age 37. There is no history of alcohol
abuse but he drinks alcohol occasionally. There is no family
history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.

Brief Hospital Course:
81 y old male w/ extensive history CAD s/p AMI at age 37, CABG
in [**2115**] (LIMA-LAD, SVG-PDA, SVG-OM1) with redo in [**2121**] (occuded
LIMA-LAD and SVG-PDA, RIMA-LAD,SVG-PDA, SVG-OM2), DES to OM1 for
NSTEMI in '[**29**], CHF with EF of 20% s/p cardiac resynchronization
and biV ICD, and severe AS s/p apico-aortic valve conduit
placement on [**2132-12-2**] now presenting with SOB.  Patient was
admitted to the floor team who initiated diuresis.  Patient was
then noted to be transiently hypotensive and was transferred to
the CCU for management.
.
#Hypotension: On arrival in CCU, patient noted to be hypotensive
in upper extremity b/l, but with elevated SBP in lower
extremity.  Impression was for either b/l subclavian stenosis or
normal physiology with his apical-aortic conduit that was
preferentially directing flow to the lower extremity.  Patient
was asymptomatic from the hypotension, and subsequent upper
extremity BP's were regularly in normal range.
.
#SOB: In CCU, patient was persistently tachypneic 20-30's at
baseline.  Exam was consistent with volume overload with
elevated JVP, peripheral edema, and crackles on lung exam.
Diuresis resulted in mildly improved respiratory function.
Patient was optimized from a volume perspective, but continued
to be tachypneic with exertion.  Patient was afebrile, without
WBC count elevation, and impression was for post-operative
deconditioning.  He was transferred to the floor for management
where he was evaluated by PT and recommended for inpatient rehab
on discharge.
.
#Atrial Fibrillation: Patient was rate controlled with HR in
60's during much of his hospital stay.  Coumadin was restarted
for anticoagulation.  Please have your INR checked regularly on
discharge to ensure therapeutic level of your coumadin.
.
#Mental Status: Patient had episode of altered mental status on
AM of [**2132-12-16**].  Neuro exam was non-focal, CT head negative,
Neuro consult recommended A1c and lipid panel.  Impression was
for benzo intoxication as patient had received an additional
dose of xanax on the AM of this episode.  also w/ component of
sleep deprivation.  Recommend that patient discontinue xanax on
discharge.
.
#PT: Physical therapy evaluated patient and recommended acute
[**Hospital 19586**] rehab on discharge.
.
#CAD: Patient was started/continued on ASA, zetia, low dose
beta-blocker, captopril, and statin therapy.  Recommend
outpatient f/u with Cardiology.
.
Remainder of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was uncomplicated.
