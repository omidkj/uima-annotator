CXR [**2131-2-23**] admission
Confluent opacity involving mid and lower right lung with round
lucencies, suggestive of cavitation and/or abscess formation.
Ground-glass
opacification of the left mid lung. Small-to-moderate right
pleural effusion.
Findings concerning for infection with cavitary lesions in the
right lower
lung. Correlation with CT exam from the outside hospital, which
by report was
performed at the OSH.

[**2131-2-24**] EGD w/ stent

A fistula was found in the lower esophagus. There was a deep
fistula at approximately 35cm with upstream ulceration and
visible suture material. The GE junction is located at
approximately 47cm
Successful placement of a 20Fr [**Company 2267**] traction PEG
tube using the standard pull technique.
Successful insertion of a 23mm x 155mm fully covered metal
esophagal stent [REF 1675, LOT [**Numeric Identifier 41706**]] under fluoroscopic
guidance, with the middle of the stent positioned over the
fistula, and the bottom of the stent above the GE junction. The
stent was deployed smoothly, and the endoscope was reinserted to
confirm appropriate location.
Otherwise normal upper endoscopy.
Fluoroscopic images viewable on Centricity.

[**2131-3-15**] CXR
FINDINGS:
Multifocal pneumonia including dense right lower lobe
consolidation with
abscess has not really changed much since [**2131-3-13**]. A
pigtail catheter
in the right lower lobe abscess is unchanged in position and
presumably within
the abscess cavity. Residual stent is present. Tracheostomy tube
is in
standard position

[**2131-3-12**] CT chest
IMPRESSION:
1. Overall similar size of large right lower lobe complex fluid
collection.
Pigtail catheter appears in appropriate position inside the
collection. Tube
patency cannot be assessed.
2. Progression of multifocal areas of peripheral lung
consolidation
consistent with infection.
3. Increased fluid and air surrounding esophageal stent.
4. No acute process in the abdomen or pelvis.

[**2131-2-28**] esophagus
1. No evidence for leak around the esophageal stent, only the
distal
two-thirds were fully evaluated.

2. Smooth narrowing and stricturing at the distal
esophagus/gastroesophageal
junction, likely related to edema or esophageal dysmotility in
the setting of
a metallic stent along a large segment of the esophagus.

[**2131-2-26**] Cardiac echo
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structural
