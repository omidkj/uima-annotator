Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3276**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central Venous Line placement - R internal jugular vein

History of Present Illness:
received INH x 8 months, and recent bronch during admission for
pna ([**Date range (1) 75968**] at [**Hospital1 **]) on last day of 6-day course of
augmentin who presents with R-sided chest pain, productive
cough, temp x 1 day.

In the ED, initial VS were T 100.4 BP 120/66 HR 115 satting 100%
on 2L NC. He was initially stable, although ill-appearing, but
then spiked fever to 101.8 around 4am, so abx (vanc/levo/zosyn)
were started. He then became hypotensive to 70s systolic;
received 3L NS with BP up to high 80s systolic, which is near
his baseline, and he was mentating well. Pt was very reluctant
to have a central line, so got fluid boluses through 2 PIVs. VS
at 6am: 99.5, 91, 85/60, 16, 100% 2L. Then, prior to transfer at
730am, SBP was back down to 70s, so ED placing central line to
start levophed.

ROS: The patient denies any chills, weight change, nausea,
vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, melena,
hematochezia, chest pain, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity
oedema,urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria, lightheadedness,
gait unsteadiness, focal weakness, vision changes, headache,
rash or skin changes. He does report a low grade temperature
around 99.4 prior to admission and worsening cough for the last
day, non-productive in nature. He does have occasional right
sided chest pain related to his cough, though not pleuritic.


Past Medical History:
- squamous cell lung cancer T3, N2 s/p L pneumonectomy [**2-/2151**]
after chemo and XRT; bronchoscopy on [**12-22**] revealed erythema and
abnormal appearance in the L bronchial stump suggesting
recurrent disease. Recent PET shows some FDG avidity along the
pneumonectomy suture line with a comment about a foci of avidity
in the AP window area. There is also circumferential uptake
around the pneumonectomy cavity. There is also a note of poor
anatomic delineation without a contrast CT. There was also FDG
avidity between the right atrial appendage and the left
ventricular outflow track without anatomic correlate. No
definite bony lesions, no subdiaphragmatic lesions. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**]
is his oncologist and last note indicates they are considering
radiation therapy.
- a-flutter s/p ablation in [**11/2151**]; not anticoagulated [**1-17**]
bleeding problems while on coumadin for PE in the past
- PE [**11-20**]
- multiple PNAs, most recently in [**12-24**]
- + PPD, treated with INH x8 months (completed in [**4-21**])
- COPD: FEV1 of 1.55 liters or 48% of predicted, an FVC of 2.38
liters or 53% of predicted, and an FEV1/FVC ratio of 55%

Patient is divorced and lives with his two daughters. Only rare
alcohol use and prior tobacco use (roughly 70 pack years); he

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU COURSE:
58M with squamous cell lung CA, h/o recurrent/?post obstructive
pna, also h/o PE, who presented to the ED with  fever, cough,
and hypotension.  He was treated with vancomycin, levofloxacin
and cefepime.

# Sepsis: Patient met SIRS criteria with fever and hypotension
in ED. Likely source was pneumonia based on symptoms of cough, R
sided chest pain. Patient had completed course of Augmentin day
prior to admission after admission for PNA at which time he was
initially treated with vanc/zosyn. During that admission, AFB
titers were normal, PCP smear was negative, sputum cultures were
negative. Symptoms worsened the day prior to admission after
completing antibiotic course. On admission his CXR unremarkable.
CTA showed no focal infiltrate, No PE but did show ground glass
opacities.  Patient initially required pressors but was quickly
weaned off when he got to the ICU.  He was treated with
vancomycin, levofloxacin and cefepime for broad coverage.  DFA
was negative, blood cultures were negative and urine culture was
negative.  He remained afebrile and normotensive and was
transferred to the floor.  He was transitioned to PO
levofloxacin.  We considered doing a thoracentesis to evaluate
for empyema, but after speaking with the patient's throacic
surgeon (who reviewed the CT scan) it felt that empyema was
highly unlikely.  The patient remained afebrile for >48 hours
and was d/c'd home and asked to follow up with the infectious
disease clinic.
.
# A-flutter, s/p ablation: In sinus rhythm on admission.
Diltizem & flecainide held on admission [**1-17**] hypotension but were
restarted after patient was weaned off pressors.  Patient was
monitored on telemetry and remained in normal sinus rhythm for
the remainder of his hospitalization.
.
# Squamous cell lung cancer: Status post L pneumonectomy now
with evidence of local recurrence as confirmed by biopsy during
admission at [**Location (un) 620**].  Primary oncologist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] was is
aware of admission.  His oncologist, thoracic surgeon and
primary team felt that the patient should recover from his acute
illness and his treatment will be decided upon as an outpatient.
.
# COPD: Continued outpatient medications including albuterol,
advair, and spiriva. Albuterol/ipratropium nebs as needed.
