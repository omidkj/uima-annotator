Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 800**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
89-year-old with diastolic CHF, HTN, recently diagnosed COPD
admited to MICU with asymptomatic oxygen desaturation from and
is now transferred to floor. Per nursing home records, patient
desated to 84% on 4L of NC pta. She had no symptoms other than
her baseline shortness of breath, which has been stable for 3
years per patient. She has been offered home 02 before but
refused. On presentation to [**Hospital1 18**], she developed afib with RVR,
which was controlled with diltiazem. In the MICU she was managed
with lasix, given history of dCHF but her oxygenation did not
improve. She was also given supplemental O2 and neb rx. Her Afib
has been managed by uptitrating her PO dilt to 180 mg PO bid.
.
Currently she feels comfortable and is asymtomatic. She states
she has been short of breath for 3 years, for example getting
out of breath after speaking for a few minutes. This has not
worsened recently. Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache,
vision changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough,
shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia,
dysuria, hematuria.

IMAGING [**2162-3-13**]
As compared to the previous radiograph, a pre-existing
retrocardiac
opacity, likely to represent a combination of infection and
atelectasis, has further slightly increased in extent. The
subtle opacities at the right lung base, accompanied by small
pleural effusion, are stable.
Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly, unchanged slight enlargement of
the right
hilus.
Massive degenerative shoulder disease.

MICRO:
URINE AND BLOOD CX NEG

Brief Hospital Course:
89 yo F with h/o diastolic CHF, COPD, HTN presents with acute
hypoxia.
.
# Hypoxia: Patient has been asymptomatic throughout course.
Initial ddx included flash pulmonary edema secondary to afib
with RVR, COPD exacerbation, pneumonia, aspiration. However with
no clinical signs or no symptoms, no pulmonary edema on imaging
and no clearcut PNA compared to prior films, it was still
unclear what caused this. Patient had CTA on prior admission,
and this seemed to be the same process so this was not repeated.
Patient was not volume overloaded and BNP was lower than at
prior hospitalization. She initially received abx and steroids
in ED, and diltiazem for rate control. She was transferred to
the medical floor. Patient was treated with PO prednisone for 5
days followed by 7 day taper. Received standing albuterol and
ipratropium nebs, and continued on Advair. She was not treated
with antibiotics that her clinical picture is not formally
diagnosed at this point, and is unlikely to be COPD. Much more
likely primary pulmonary hypertension, (or secondary pulmonary
hypertension due to valvular disease and diastolic dysfunction).
CT previously showed possible emphysema, however mysterious
given no smoking history (alpha1-antitrypsinase normal).
02 sat improved to high 80s-low 90s on room air, and mid to high
90s on 1.5 L NC. She will be set up with home 02 and home
nebulizers. She will have PFTs and pulmonary follow up as
outpatient.
.
# Afib with RVR: Likely triggered by pulmonary disease. Patient
had been on diltiazem at home, and this was titrated up to 240
mg CR [**Hospital1 **] with good effect. Baseline HR 80-100s at rest which
was satisfactory. INR borderline subtherpeutic (ranged 1.9 to
2.0) so coumadin dose was increased slightly to 1.5 mg daily.
INR should be checked in 3 days.
.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Patient had creatinine close to baseline at admission. On
transfer to the medical floor however, Cr bumped from baseline
1.0 to 1.7. Patient had been started on lasix at prior
hospitalization, for presumed diastolic CHF. It is possible that
patient's hypoxia was falsely attributed to volume overload and
CHF at that point, and that 40 mg Lasix was too much for this
100 lb woman with poor PO intake at baseline. Lasix was held and
IVF repleted. Creatinine was steadily improving at discharge
(1.3 on [**2162-3-13**]). Patient should have renal function checked
daily until at baseline. Lasix should continue to be held until
creatinine at baseline, and then could consider restarting at 20
mg QOD and monitoring. Lisinopril also held in setting of [**Last Name (un) **]
and should be restarted when resolved.
.
# leukocytosis: Patient initially had borderline leukocytosis in
setting of receiving steroids. This was not worked up sine she
had no fevers or chills, no symptoms. However, leukocytosis
continued to increase as steroid dose was tapered down.
Differential unchanged and no left shift. No fevers or other
signs of infection (no cough, loose stools, dysuria, etc). CXR
indeterminate given atelectasis but may have infectious
component. We discussed this with [**Hospital 100**] rehab, they will
monitor her closely and start vancomycin and levaquin if WBC
continues to increase or if patient develops fever or symptoms
of PNA.
.
# dCHF: No clear evidence of significant heart failure. Has
elevated JVP due to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Lung exam
significant only for poor aeration and fine crackles at bases
more consistent with pulm HTN than volume overload. CXR did show
small plerual effusions, but may be [**1-26**] atelectasis as well
given patient's immobility and hypoventilation. Lasix held as
above. If patient develops leg swelling, worsened pleural
effusions on CXR, Lasix can be restarted.
.
# HTN: Well controlled on diltiazem. Held lisinopril given [**Last Name (un) **].
