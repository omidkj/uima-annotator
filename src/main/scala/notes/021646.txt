OTHER STUDIES
===============
ECG [**2127-3-11**]:
Sinus rhythm. Atrio-ventricular conduction delay. Right
bundle-branch block.  Probable prior inferior myocardial
infarction. Probable prior anterior myocardial infarction. No
previous tracing available for comparison.

Urine cytology [**2127-3-12**]:
Negative for malignant cells

RENAL U.S. [**2127-3-12**]:
FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 12 cm. The left kidney
measures 11 cm.  There is no hydronephrosis, stone, or mass.
Trace diffuse cortical thinning may be present. The bladder is
decompressed with a Foley catheter.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of renal obstruction, mass, or hematoma.


COLONSCOPY [**2127-3-13**]:
Impression: Diverticulosis of the mainly located on the left
side of the colon Small amout of red blood was noted at the
cecum. There was no active bleeding seen. There was no source of
bleeding seen. When washed away the underlyling mucosa was
normal. Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids Otherwise normal
colonoscopy to cecum

RUE U/S [**2127-3-14**]:
CONCLUSION: No DVT seen by ultrasound examination in the right
upper
extremity veins.

CYSTOSCOPY [**2127-3-14**]:
Patient had normal anterior urethra.  Prostatic urethra with
some slight mucosal oozing of blood.  Bladder trabeculated with
some diverticula.  Visualization not optimal given recent
bleeding.  No obvious tumor or stones seen within bladder.
Small blood clot seen in dependent portion of bladder. Ureteral
orifices not visualized.


Brief Hospital Course:
83 M history of diverticulosis, mechanical mitral valve
replacement on coumadin who presents with maroon colored stool x
1 week and HCT drop, concerning for lower GI bleed.

ACTIVE DIAGNOSES:
#Lower GI bleed/acute blood loss Anemia: HCT baseline 28-31 and
was 24.8 after 1 week of maroon colored stools. Given history of
diverticuli, this was felt to be likely a diverticular bleed as
it was painless.  He received 1 unit of pRBC's in the ED and
another unit on HD#1 with a goal Crit of 28 given active
bleeding and comorbidities.  Colonoscopy on hospital day two
showed no active bleeding, but diverticulosis and possibly old
blood. Bleeding stopped soon thereafter without particular
intervention and by time of discharge he had no maroon stools or
notable GI bleeding for >5 days despite therapeutic
anticoagulation.  He was still having hematuria at that time
that may have explained Hct drifting down to 25-27 range where
it remained after all bleeding had resolved.  Given Hct remained
over 25 after bleeding had resolved and patient's chronic
systolic CHF presented a risk for overload with transfusion
further transfusion was deferred.  At time of discharge he is on
therapeutic coumadin with no signs of bleeding and a stable Hct.
 He will follow up with PCP three days after discharge at which
point Hct can be repeated.

#Gross Hematuria requiring CBI: Pt with known BPH who was
admitted with gross hematuria x 1 week. This was felt to be
likely bladder or prostate source. He was managed with CBI giv
