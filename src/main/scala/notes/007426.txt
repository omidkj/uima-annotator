Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

REASON FOR ADMISSION:  The patient arrived into the hospital
on [**2163-1-6**], with a same day admitted for a coronary artery
bypass graft times one with a graft to his left anterior
descending artery.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71 year old man
with a history of a silent myocardial infarction evident on
EKG.  Echocardiograms followed serially.  He has a history of
cardiomyopathy and experienced shortness of breath.  In
[**6-/2162**], there was a negative Persantine test.  Cardiac
catheterization done at [**Hospital6 33**] revealed an left
anterior descending ostial 50% occlusion, right coronary
artery 100% occlusion, ejection fraction ranging 25 to 30%,
however, actually lower, around 15% as well.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Spondylolisthesis of the left shoulder.
2.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with cardioversion in
[**2162-10-14**].
3.  Coronary artery disease.
4.  Cardiomyopathy.
5.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
6.  Asthma.
7.  Hypertension.
8.  Silent myocardial infarction.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Open reduction and internal fixation of the left ankle in
[**2153**].

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1.  Lasix with last dose given on [**12-29**].
2.  Coumadin, last dose on [**12-29**].
3.  Amiodarone 200 mg q. day.
4.  Captopril which was stopped the week prior to surgery.
5.  Nebulizer treatment at home.

ALLERGIES:  His allergies include penicillin.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for the death of his father in a
car accident; his mother died of complications of diabetes
mellitus in her old age.  He is a retired gentleman who lives
with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] stopped smoking, however, has 50 plus year
history of cigar smoking.  He admitted to occasional ethanol
use socially and no illicit drug use.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Significant for emphysema, asthma, but no
chronic bronchitis.  He experiences occasional palpitations.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   His vital signs on admission revealed
that he was in atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 125.
Physical examination was also significant for him having a
red complexion with a Type B emphysema and multiple skin tags
as well as keratoses.  He had no jugular venous distention.
He was clear bilaterally, however, he had episodes of
coughing with deep breaths.  His heart was irregularly
irregular consistent with the atrial fibrillation however, no
murmur was detected.  There was no hepatosplenomegaly, no
masses and his abdomen was benign.  There was some swelling
of his left foot the same foot which had the broken ankle,
and some pedal edema.  He has a mild superficial right and
left knee rubor.  Neurologically he was intact with excellent
motor strength five out of five.  He had distal pulses which
were non-palpable, but his extremities were non-ischemic.  No
carotid bruits were appreciated.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the Operating
Room.  The patient, postoperative day number one was admitted
to the Intensive Care Unit where he was extubated the
following day and Rehabilitation Services were involved.  He
had an occasional expiratory wheeze.  Levo was weaned off and
Cardizem was discontinued.

Postoperative day two was significant only for him having
some minor confusion to time and person, unaware of having
surgery.  He pulled off his lines and was confused to times
and place.  The patient was combative and belligerent,
hitting anyone who attempted to get near him.  He was
restrained.  He was also threatening to kill anyone who came
to the room which is consistent with psychosis secondary to
the bypass surgery.

By postoperative day number three, the patient's pain was
well controlled.  He remained in the Unit and we advanced his
diet.  We had him on Vancomycin.  Postoperative day number
four, he remained in the Intensive Care Unit to be monitored.
Dobutamine were weaned off and awaiting call.  Good function
and cardiac index.  The patient's heart rate, however,
remained elevated despite the administration of Lopressor.
On postoperative day number five, the patient was awake and
found somewhat difficult to control his atrial fibrillation.
Cardiology was called, and Rehabilitation was also involved.

On [**1-11**], the patient pulled his Foley catheter and arterial
line and was again hostile and confused and refused to go
back to bed.  On postoperative day six, [**2163-1-12**], he was
clinically stable and his Captopril was reduced as it was
noted that his creatinine was increased to 1.4.  Physical
Therapy was involved and at this point patient was receiving
amiodarone boluses to help control his atrial fibrillation.
From a respiratory point-of-view, the patient was tolerating,
however, remained wheezy and agitated.

The patient was extubated on [**2163-1-13**], without
complication and following anti-coagulation to 4.1 after a 5
mg dose of Coumadin was given.  Captopril was discontinued
pending the fact that his creatinine had now risen to 1.6.
The patient was transferred to the Floor on [**1-12**] and on
nebulizers where he had repeated shortness of breath which
was evaluated not to be cardiac in origin but more consistent
with poor pulmonary function.

At this point, the patient was advanced on diet and increased
to ambulate, however, secondary to chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease he was unable to tolerate much physical
activity.  His wires were discontinued on [**1-14**], without
complication.  He remained in somewhat of a regular rhythm at
this point and not in atrial fibrillation.  The patient was
referred to Rehabilitation and agreed to it after some
coaxing.

The patient is discharged on [**2163-1-17**], in good condition.
His INR has gone down to 1.3 after Vitamin K and his
creatinine has risen now to 1.5.  The Captopril is being
held.  He is being started at 2.5 mg of Coumadin today and is
expected to have that dose adjusted to an INR of 2 to 2.5 at
rehabilitation for his previous atrial fibrillation, and his
low-flow state mainly.  The patient was started on digoxin on
[**1-16**], with a loading dose also.  He is to continue on
digoxin.  The patient is not acute upon discharge and his
groin wound looks non-infected and intact with no clicks or
signs of infection.

on the following medications.

8.  Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q. day.
9.  Coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q. day adjusted to an INR of 2.0 to
2.5.
