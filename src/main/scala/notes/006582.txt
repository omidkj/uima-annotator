Chief Complaint:
Cardiac arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
80 year old male with CAD, DM2, HTN and AAA repair in [**5-25**]
presents from OSH after cardiac arrest. Per report and wife, the
patient was in his USOH, very active at baseline, walking with
his wife on the AM of admission when he experienced a choking
sensation and right arm pain after walking [**1-20**] mile. He sat down
to get some rest, but within minutes was found by his wife on
the ground unresponsive. his wife started CPR and EMS was
called. EMS arrived after 7-10 min and began resusitation
efforts. He was found to be in PEA, given epi x1, which
converted to V.fib, was shocked w 200J and converted to sinus
tachy. There was concern that the patient hit the back of his
head when he fell.
.
On arrival to the OSH, pH was 7.21, Hct 26, K 3.2. EKG with deep
ST depr/TWI in V1-V4. The patient went into VTach and was
shocked back into sinus. Pt was bolused with Amio. He was
hypotensive with SBPs in the 70s and started on dopamine/neo
which was switched to levophed (left subclavian) with good
result. Pt was given 1 unit PRBCs, rectal ASA. Given concern for
ruptured AAA, CT abd was performed and was negative for rupture.
Heparin gtt was also started. Given acute cardiac issues, the
patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
.
On arrival to the CCU, the patient was intubated and sedated.
With stimulation the patient was noted to have movement in all
extremities with question of posturing. His levophed and heparin
were continued. After reviewing the data, the decision was made
to take the patient for cardiac cath.
.
According the the wife, ROS prior to the event was as per above.
In addition, the patient did complain of stomach discomfort on
the night prior to admission. She otherwise denied HA,
dizziness, lightheadedness, f/c, cough, SOB, chest pain, n/v/d
or change in BMs, rashes
.

[**7-22**] CARDIAC CATH:
Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system
demonstrated a severe three vessel CAD.  The LMCA had a distal
calcific 40% lesion.  There was a twin LAD system.  The LAD had
a severe diffuse disease with an 80% tubular lesion at the
origin into the D1/twin LAD system.  The twin LAD/D1 had a 90%
proximal hazy lesion. The distal LAD was a small vessel.  The
LCx was a dominant vessel with origin
calcifications. The RI was subtotally occluded and was small.
The OM2
was occluded with a left to left retrograde filling.  The distal
PDA had
a 70% proximal lesion.  The RCA was a non-dominant vessel with
severe
diffuse disease.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left
sided filling pressures with a mean PCWP of 22 mm Hg. The
cardiac index was preserved at 4.57 l/min/m2.
Left ventriculography was deferred.

.
[**7-23**] TTE:
LA is mildly dilated. RA is moderately dilated. LV wall
thicknesses are normal. The LV cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall LV systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). RV chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No AR is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial MR.  There is no pericardial
effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is an 80 yo M with CAD, HTN, s/p AAA repair who presents with
PEA/V.fib cardiac arrest, hypotension, and acidosis, found to
have severe 3 vessel CAD, having seizures secondary to anoxic
brain injury.

# Anoxic Brain Injury : Pt. experienced cardiac arrest in the
community with several minutes of presumed non-perfusion prior
to CPR and EMS arrival. Pt has been intubated and unresponsive
to all stimuli since admission. Neurology was involved
throughout the course of his hospitalization.  Over subsequent
days, the patient did not recover any neurologic function
requiring multiple anti-epileptic medications for seizure
control.

# Cardiac Arrest: Likely related to his underlying severe CAD
+/- acute MI. No obvious acidosis, electrolyte or drug/toxin
exposures. Per cath, appeared to have stable heart function with
adequate CO/CI. pH/lactate improved. CE's peaked with CK of 1281
([**7-22**]). Patient was s/p arctic cooling protocol.

# Myoclonus vs. seizure: On [**7-24**] patient began to display
myoclonus/ convulsive activity, especially with manipulation.
Neurology was consulted and performed an EEG which was
inconclusive as to whether the etiology was anoxic brain injury
versus epileptic foci. Keppra was started on [**7-25**] without
resolution of myoclonus. A loading dose of Dilantin was given on
[**7-27**]. Due to good response with Dilantin, another loading dose
was given on [**7-28**] and then transitioned to a maintence dose.
Sedation was initially avoided so as not to cloud a complete
neurological exam, however, on [**7-29**] due to poor response of
antiepileptics and continued convulsive activity, a Versed drip
was begun.

# CAD: Prior cath in [**2145**] with multivessel disease, s/p
angioplasty. Cath here with diffuse 3 vessel disease including
LAD, LCx, RCA. No interventions performed. Pati
