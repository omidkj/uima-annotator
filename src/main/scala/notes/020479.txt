Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 473**]
Chief Complaint:
painless jaundice, gallbladder carcinoma

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2141-7-17**] - ERCP - biliary evaluation with biopsy
[**2141-7-20**] - percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography
[**2141-7-21**] - esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with duodenal
stenting
[**2141-7-27**] - percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage with
right-biliary tree catheter exchange
[**2141-7-28**] - percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage with left
and right metal biliary stent placement

History of Present Illness:
This is a pleasant 68-year old female who intially presented six
weeks ago to an outside hospital with RUQ pain concerning for
acute cholecystitis. Surgery was deferred due to co-morbidities
and a percutaneous cholecystostomy drain was placed. The patient
was then discharged to [**Hospital 582**] Rehab with a plan for possible
outpatient cholecystectomy once the inflammation resolved.  At
rehab the perc chole tube was unintentionally removed.
Approximately 1.5 wks ago the patient became increasingly
jaundiced. She was again evaluated at [**Hospital3 20284**] Center in
[**Hospital1 189**] where CT and MRI showed dilated intrahepatic ducts and
CBD with proximal narrowing near the cystic duct concerning for
Mirizzi's syndrome. The patient was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 48587**]
for ERCP/decompression.
ERCP was attempted but unsuccessful as the scope could not pass
an edematous duodenal bulb. Ms. [**Known lastname 4135**] was then transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

[**2141-7-18**] CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS WITH CONTRAST - Moderate-to-severe
intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation. Dilatation of the proximal
common bile duct with abrupt cutoff of the lumen at the level of
the liver hilum. Markedly abnormal gallbladder with irregular
enhancing wall thickening. Enhancing soft tissue extending to
the liver hilum and second portion of the duodenum, encasing the
duodenum. Due to the extensive soft tissue extension the
appearance is concerning for gallbladder carcinoma, differential
diagnosis includes Mirizzi syndrome although this is considered
less likely. Gallstones are not seen on CT and ultrasound would
be helpful to document an obstructing stone in the cystic duct.
Bilateral small pleural effusions. Soft tissue stranding along
the right paracolic gutter; uncertain clinical significance,
this may be postsurgical, however peritoneal metastases canot be
entirely excluded. Thrombosis of the middle hepatic vein with
corresponding wedge-shaped hypoperfusion of the liver.

[**2141-7-27**] CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST - Persistent mild
dilatation of the left biliary ducts which is improved from the
[**2141-7-18**] CT. Significantly improved appearance to the right
biliary ducts which are decompressed by the indwelling
percutaneous biliary catheter. Unchanged appearance to the
gallbladder, again most consistent with invasive gallbladder
carcinoma. Findings remain highly suspicious for peritoneal
disease along the right paracolic gutter. Unchanged extension to
the portal hilum and second portion of the duodenum as noted
previously. Interval increase in size to moderate right and
small left pleural effusion. Moderate ascites within the pelvis.




Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4135**] is a 68 year-old female who intially presented to an
outside hospital with RUQ pain concerning for acute
cholecystitis. A percutaneous cholecystostomy tube was placed
given her poor surgical candidacy, and she was discharged to
[**Hospital 582**] Rehab facility. Her perc cholecystostomy tube was
removed unintentionally at rehab. She noticed worsening jaundice
and represented to [**Hospital3 20284**] Center in [**Hospital1 189**] where a CT
and MR imaging showed dilated intrahepatic ducts and dilated CBD
with proximal narrowing, concerning for Mirizzi's syndrome
initially. She was referred for ERCP and decompression but this
was unsuccessful as the scope could not pass the edematous
duodenal bulb. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.

She was admitted on [**2141-7-17**] for management of her obstructive
jaundice. On [**2141-7-17**], an ERCP was re-performed and a
circumferential infiltrating mass causing near complete
obstruction was noted at the second part of duodenum and
biopsies were performed which yielded chronic duodenitis, but no
malignancy. A CT scan performed on [**7-18**] demonstrated
moderate-to-severe intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation.
Dilatation of
the proximal common bile duct with abrupt cutoff of the lumen at
the level of
the liver hilum was noted. A markedly abnormal gallbladder with
irregular enhancing wall thickening was noted. Enhancing soft
tissue extending to the liver hilum and second portion of the
duodenum, encasing the duodenum, was noted. Due to the extensive
soft tissue extension the appearance was concerning for
gallbladder carcinoma. On [**7-20**], PTC was performed showing
occlusion of the upper CBD with biliary dilitation above. The
duodenum at the ampulla was not well opacified but the third and
fourth portions appeared within normal limits. Uncomplicated
right-sided PTBD
with 8-French internal-external drain placement was performed. A
this point, EGD with duodenal stenting was performed on [**2141-7-21**],
to bypass the obstructing duodenal mass noted above. From
[**Date range (1) 32604**] the biliary drain was capped and her diet was advanced
from clears to full liquids. She tolerated this well initially.
She did have poor ability to clear secretions and given her
extensive hospitalization, there was concern for poor
respiratory status. She had a CXR on [**7-23**] which demonstrated
findings concerning for RLL pneumonia and she was monitored
closely with chest PT and encouragement of IS. She was afebrile
at that time.

On [**7-24**], a trigger alert was called and the patient was doing
poorly. Her mental status was diminished and she was minimally
interactive. Her blood pressure dropped and her HR was elevated.
There was concern for sepsis. In an effort to determine the
source, the biliart drain was uncapped, revealing foul-smelling
bilious drainage and laboratory studies, along with cultures,
were obtained. As noted above, her RLL infiltrate was of concern
and work-up at the time demonstrated findings consistent with a
UTI. Given all infectious sources, she was fluid resuscitated,
started on IV Vancomycin and Zosyn following obtained cultures
and transferred to the surgical ICU for further care. She was
transferred back to the floor on [**7-25**] after clinical improvement
and antibiotic coverage. Her bile culture speciated MRSA whic
