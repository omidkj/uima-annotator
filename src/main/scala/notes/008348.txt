Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
 s/p vfib arrest, transferred for continuous EEG monitoring

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Extubation, [**2156-6-17**]

History of Present Illness:
This is a 50 year old man with known CAD s/p STEMI in [**2146**] (with
LAD stents) and infrequent medical followup since that time who
was admitted to [**Hospital6 2561**] on [**2156-6-8**] following vfib
arrest. History is obtained from the medical records. He
reportedly had an unwitnessed (but heard) syncopal event at work
around 5:15pm on [**6-8**]. CPR was started within 2 minutes and 911
was called. AED was applied and a shock was given. On EMS
arrival, PEA was noted, and pt was given epi x2, atropine x2
with CPR continued. VF then noted again and shocked x2.
Lidocaine 100mg given, follwed by gtt. No BP was obtainable for
about 15 minutes. Peripheral dopamine started, after which SBP
108 noted. Pt was intubated en route to the hospital, and
sedated with versed. On arrival to the [**Last Name (un) 1724**] ED, rhythm was sinus
tachy 130s-150s with ST elevations V1-V3 noted.
.
Head CT was negative, and pt was then taken to the cath lab,
where multivessel disease was noted. DES x2 placed to LAD (prior
stents 100% occluded). Prox RCA was also noted to be chronically
occluded with L->R collaterals. IABP was inserted. Arctic Sun
cooling protocol was initiated. He was weaned off dopamine and
the IABP was discontinued 2 days prior to transfer.
.
On [**6-9**] he was noted to have some bleeding from his mouth. ENT
evaluated the patient and did not see any ongoing bleeding.
However, hct decreased from around 40 initially to 30 today.
.
The patient has also been spiking fevers and is currently on
vancomycin and ceftazidime for empiric treatment of VAP. He
reportedly has had H. flu and pan-sensitive staph growing from
sputum.
.
After re-warming, he has been noted to have LE>UE shaking
movements which are concerning for seizure activity in the
setting of possible anoxic brain injury. Neuro was consulted and
pt was loaded with Keppra. The patient is now transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for continuous EEG monitoring.
.
Currently unable to complete review of symptoms, as pt is
intubated and sedated. Medical records note that pt's wife
reported pt had L anterior chest pain radiating to his left arm
on the night prior to admission, but further details of this
history are unavailable at this time.

CV: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
RR, normal S1, S2. No S4, no S3, no murmurs.
Chest: On mechanical ventilation, pressure support. Exam limited
by supine positioning, but no crackles, wheeze, rhonchi
appreciated.

guaiac negative.
Ext: No clubbing or cyanosis. Significant upper extremity
non-pitting edema, and 1+ lower extremity edeam. Peripheral
pulses 2+. UE reflexes 0-1+, Patellar reflexes 3+, no clonus,
Babinski with no response. No femoral bruits or hematomas.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Pulses:
Right: Carotid 2+ without bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit; 2+ DP

Left: Carotid 2+ without bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit; 2+ DP


Pertinent Results:
EKG on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] demonstrated sinus rhythm, normal
intervals and axes, Q waves of [**10-27**] mm in V1-V3, and of [**1-14**] mm
in III and aVF, compared with OSH EKG which showed ST elevations
in V1-V3.
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2156-6-9**] demonstrated:
This was an extremely technically limited study due to poor echo
windows, the patient being intubated, hypothermic and having a
balloon pump in. There was no pericardial effusion seen. Overall
EF was moderately depressed. There was hypokinesis of the
anterior wall, apex and antero septum. Aortic valve is not well
visualized. There is mild MR. There is trace TR. Again, no
pericardial effusion is seen.
IMPRESSION: Moderately depressed EF. No evidence of pericardial
effusion. Recommendations made for a repeat echocardiogram for
better assessment of LV function when the patient has further
stabilized.
.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2156-6-8**] demonstrated:
1. Severe 2-vessel coronary artery disease with acute and
chronic occlusions.
2. Severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
3. No significant mitral regurgitation or aortic stenosis.
4. Successful balloon angioplasty and stenting (2 drug eluting
stents) of the left anterior descending coronary artery acute
proximal occlusion resulted in 0% residual stenosis.
5. Intra-aortic balloon pump placed for hemodynamic support.
.
[**2156-6-12**] Head CT:
1. Interval development of small low attenuation focus in the L
basal ganglia, which may represent a focus of ischemic injury.
2. Interval development of subcutaneous fluid collections over
the R parietal and L temporal bones, which most likely represent
hematomas if there is a history of recent trauma.
3. Interval worsening of sinus disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
# CAD/Ischemia:
The patient presented s/p MI with 100% lesion of LAD stented
with 2 drug-eluting stents. RCA was occluded but had L to R
colaterals; no intervention was undertaken during cath. Echo on
[**6-14**] showed severe anterior, septal, and apical hypokinesis.  The
patient was started on a beta-[**Last Name (LF) 7005**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], statin, and plavix.
.
# Pump:
The patient had TTE on [**6-14**] showed EF of 30-35%, severe anterior,
septal, and apical hypokinesis. The patient was not
anticoagulated with heparin for intraventricular thrombus
prophylaxis. He was diuresed with lasix and started on
Lisinopril 5mg daily.   He was sent home on 20mg lasix daily.
.
# Rhythm: s/p V-fib arrest, now sinus rhythm, monitored on
telemetry. Arrest appears to have been in the setting of MI vs
old scar; and he remained in sinus rhythm since AED
defibrillation.  Given his arrest he underwent an EP study which
showed inducible ventricular arrhythmia, and an ICD was placed.
He was given 2 days of Keflex post ICD placement. He had no
further events on telemetry.  He was discharged with follow up
in device clinic.

.
# Neurologic status: Per neuro, there was no evidence for
seizure, and EEG showed slow, low amplitude acitivity with no
foci. Patient was unresponsive initially, likely due to having
been without a blood pressure for 15 minutes with possible
anoxic brain injury. He did undergo cooling protocol at the
outside hospital. Patient became responsive on HD#3, and has had
steady improvement in neurological function since. MRI showed no
intra
