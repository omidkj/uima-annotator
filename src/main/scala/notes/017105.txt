Date of Birth:   [**2056-6-17**]       Sex:  M

Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 58 year-old man
who has a history of _____________ mitral valve disease with
prolapse ultimately leading to a mitral valve repair in [**2107**],
first noted to have a murmur on physical examination in [**2105**]
with an echocardiogram revealing left ventricular dilatation
and an EF of 70%.  He had no follow up at that time, however,
in [**2108-8-5**] he was seen in the Emergency Room at [**Initials (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 47**] Hospital complaining of abdominal distress and
progressive exertional dyspnea.  He was found at that time to
be in rapid atrial fibrillation.  He was started on Digoxin,
but refused to be hospitalized.  An echocardiogram done a
month later showed a markedly dilated and globally
hypokinetic left ventricular with an EF of only 15 to 20%.
At that time he was shown to have severe mitral regurgitation
and severe tricuspid regurgitation with a flail anterior
leaflet, dilated RA and RV.  He was anticoagulated and
started on an ace inhibitor and advised to undergo surgery to
repair his valvular regurgitation.  Cardiac catheterization
done in [**Location (un) 47**] showed global hypokinesis with an EF of
24%, marked mitral valve prolapse with severe mitral
regurgitation.  Coronary angiography showed a right dominant
system with no obstructive disease.  In [**2108-11-4**] he
underwent mitral and tricuspid valve surgery at [**Hospital6 **] receiving [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 405**] ring anuloplasty of the mitral
valve with a tricuspid valve anuloplasty as well via a
minimally invasive incision.  He did well clinically, but
follow up echocardiogram in [**2108**] showed continued left
ventricular dilatation with an EF of 20 to 25%.  Mitral valve
angioplasty ring was intact with no mitral valve prolapse and
only mild mitral regurgitation.  There was an anuloplasty
ring in the tricuspid position, whoever, he had persistent
tricuspid regurgitation.  He was in normal sinus rhythm at
the time.  Repeat echocardiogram in [**2109**] showed little
change.  For the next two years the patient had intermittent
bouts of rapid atrial fibrillation for which he was
electrically cardioverted.  Over the past several months the
patient has had progressive exertional dyspnea.
Echocardiogram in [**Month (only) **] of this year showed normal left
ventricular size and regional wall motion with an EF of 55%,
mild mitral regurgitation with severe right and flail sutures
seen in the septal leaflet.  Catheterization done at that
time showed an EF of 50% with normal coronaries.

MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:  Atenolol 50 mg q.d.,
Percocet three to four tabs q.d. for reported tendonitis.

ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.  He denies
alcohol use.  Tobacco one pack per day and continues to smoke
at this time.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs temperature 98.2, heart
rate 72, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure 132/94.  Height
6'1", weight 190 pounds.  General, no acute distress.  HEENT
no teeth.  No JVD.  Neck is supple.  No bruits.  Chest is
clear to auscultation.  Heart irregular rate and rhythm.
Abdomen is soft, nontender with positive bowel sounds.
Extremities no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  No varicosities.
Neurological alert and oriented times three.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**11-21**], Mr. [**Known lastname 46705**] was brought to
the Operating Room at which time he underwent a redo
tricuspid valve repair with a #30 anuloplasty ring and a Mays
procedure with ligation of the left atrial appendage.  He
tolerated the operation and was transferred from the
Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  At
the time of transfer the patient was on Milrinone at 0.25
micrograms per kilogram per minute, Levophed at 0.2
micrograms per kilogram per minute and Propofol at 20
micrograms per kilogram per minute.  Post surgery the patient
remained in atrial fibrillation with a right bundle branch
block and a rate of 105 to 115 beats per minute.  He was seen
by the Electrophysiology Service at that time.  In the
immediate postoperative period the patient did well.  He was
weaned from his cardioactive drugs.  His anesthesia was
reversed.  He was weaned from the ventilator and successfully
extubated.  On postoperative day one the patient continued to
do well.  He remained in the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care
Unit for vigorous pulmonary toilet.  His chest tubes were
removed on postoperative day one.  On postoperative day two
the patient continued to do well and at that time he was
transferred from the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit to
Far Two for continued postoperative care and cardiac
rehabilitation.

On postoperative day three the patient was found to be
relatively hypoxic and short of breath.  He was moved from
the floor back to the Intensive Care Unit for continuous
pulmonary toilet and aggressive diuresis, which was achieved
over the next 24 hours.  On postoperative day five the
patient was again transferred to the flor for continuing
postoperative care.  He did well over the next three to four
days and increasing his level of activity with the assistance
of physical therapy and the nursing staff.  On postoperative
day nine it was felt that the patient was stable and ready
for discharge to home.

DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs temperature
98.9, heart rate 88, atrial fibrillation, blood pressure
109/64, respiratory rate 18, O2 sat 97% on room air.  Weight
preoperatively is 86 kilograms.  At discharge he is 89
kilograms.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 10.8, hematocrit
26.1, platelets 239, PT 18.1, INR 2.2, sodium 133, potassium
4.3, chloride 95, CO2 29, BUN 16, creatinine 0.8, glucose
167.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Levofloxacin 500 mg q.d., Coumadin 5
mg q.d. with a goal INR of 2, Amiodarone 200 mg q.d.,
Metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d., furosemide 40 mg b.i.d. times seven
days and then 20 mg b.i.d. times two weeks, potassium
chloride 20 milliequivalents b.i.d., and Percocet 5/325 one
to two tabs q 4 hours prn.
