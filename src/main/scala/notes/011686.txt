.
[**2180-6-21**] CHEST (PA & LAT) FINDINGS: Cardiomegaly is moderate to
severe. Pulmonary vascular congestion and pulmonary edema is
noted with small bilateral pleural effusions. Mediastinal
contour is notable
for atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta which is also
unfolded. No
pneumothorax is seen. Bony structures appear grossly intact.
.
[**2180-6-22**] TTE (Complete) The left atrium is dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%). Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade I
(mild) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The number of
aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is critical
aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). No aortic
regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
prominent fat pad.
.
[**2180-6-22**] CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST IMPRESSION:
1. No radiographic evidence of intrathoracic malignancy or
active infection.
2. Widespread atherosclerotic calcification involving coronary
arteries,
spares the ascending thoracic aorta.
3. Probable pulmonary hypertension.
4. Severe aortic valvular calcification, moderate left atrial
and left
ventricular enlargement. No pulmonary edema. Minimal pleural and
pericardial effusions.
.
[**2180-6-23**] Cardiac Catheterization:
1. Coronary angiography in this left-dominant system
demonstrated two
vessel disease. The LMCA was without angiographically apparent
disease.
The LAD had 70% mid lesion. The LCx was dominant with <50%
disease. The
RCA was very small and non-dominant with severe mid vessel
disease.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left heart
filling
pressures with RVEDP 14 mmHg and PCWP 28 mmHg. There was
moderate-severe
pulmonary artery hypertension with PASP 54 mmHg. The cardiac
index was
preserved at 2.8 L/min/m2. There was mild systemic arterial
systolic
hypertension with SBP 144 mmHg.
.
[**2180-6-26**] CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE	Findings:  Right ICA less than
40% stenosis. Left ICA less than 40% stenosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
MEDICINE COURSE:

86 y/o woman with reported critical aoric stenosis presnetin
with acute dyspnea.

# Critical aortic stenosis: The patient on arrival was acutely
dyspnic, and was on 4 L NC. The patient was diuresed with PO
Furosemide, her weight dropped by [**4-7**] pounds, and subsequently
her breathing improved. When the patient was given 20 mg IV
Lasix, although this helped to diruese her, the patient would
become hypotense into systolics 80s; as such, the team avoided
IV diuresis in Ms. [**Known lastname 88941**]. On admission, her results were
notable for a proBNP of [**2093**], and the patient was troponin
negative x3, with stable CK, CK-MBs. Her CXR on admission showed
cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural
effusions, and her admission EKG showed a sinus rhythm. She
diuresed well, and was subsequently satting well on room air
with stable vitals. An ECHO was performed which showed LVEF of
55% as well as critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area
<0.8cm2) (see full report in results section for more details).
Based on this ECHO, the patient was evaluated by the
cardiothoracic surgery team, who believed that she would be a
candidate for aortic valve replacement. She underwent several
tests to ensure her candidacy for valve replacement, including a
CT chest, which showed no radiographic evidence of intrathoracic
malignancy or active infection. She also underwent cardaic
catheterization, which revealed a left-dominant system, with LAD
70% mid lesion, LCx with <50% disease, and a small and
non-dominant RCA with severe mid vessel disease. Hemodynamic
were also performed which showed elevated right and left heart
filling
pressures with RVEDP 14 mmHg and PCWP 28 mmHg. There was
moderate-severe pulmonary artery hypertension with PASP 54 mmHg.
Based on this result, it was decided that CABG would also be
performed at the time of aortic valve replacement. A Panorex
showed lucencies within the upper right incisor as well as
within the lower right molars, likely representing caries, but
without active infection or abscess. By ultrasound, the patient
had patent lower extremity superficial veins with small
diameters, and carotid ultrasound showed right ICA less tha
