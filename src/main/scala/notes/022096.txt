Dyspnea, hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
*Obtained from wife and medical records as patient is aphasic
and intubated and sedated* Mr. [**Known lastname 33962**] is a 69M with history
of pontine CVA [**2103**], dilated cardiomyopathy with EF 10%, CAD and
recurrent aspiration pneumonias treated with PO antibiotics most
recently Augmentin [**Date range (1) 101946**] and started on Levofloxacin at
[**Hospital3 2558**] on [**12-26**] for PNA now presenting to ED with
increased respiratory distress and hypoxic respiratory failure.
Per wife, pt has had increased shortness of breath, "asking for
O2", increased sputum production with foul odor, and increased
confusion (not making sense when communicating via letter board)
and agitation for which he has been receiving valium over the
last 2.5 weeks. Denies change in chronic cough from baseline and
fevers or chills. Denies history of witnesed aspiration and is
NPO with TFs at baseline but but did have emesis x 1 2.5 weeks
prior around time of onset of symptoms.
.
In the emergency department, initial VS: 97.9 110 125/57 35 100%
on 10L NRB. He desaturated to 80s with noted periods of apnea so
was intubated after code status confirmed by patient (nodded
head to intubation) and family (previously DNR/DNI). SBP
80s-120s but dropped to 70s with sedation and intubation so
right femoral CVL was placed and he was started on levophed in
addition to fentanyl, midazolam. CXR was consistent with
bibasilar infiltrates with appropriate ETT placement. He
received ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and vancomycin after blood
cx were drawn and he was transferred to MICU. Flagyl was ordered
but not received. VS prior to transfer: T96 BP 92/57 100% on
SIMV Vt600 PEEP 5 RR16 FiO2 100% on Levophed 0.15mcg/kg/min.

Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], patient opens eyes but is not
following commands and appears comfortable.

IMAGING:
CXR [**2114-1-2**]:
Worsening pulmonary edema with increasing size of bilateral
pleural effusions.

ECHO [**2114-1-2**]:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 20 %) secondary to extensive septal akinesis, and
hypokinesis of the inferior free wall, anterior free wall, and
apex. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive
filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2113-10-20**], the mitral regurgitation is significantly
increased.

LE U/S
Thrombus involving the right greater saphenous vein as it enters
the common femoral vein as described, but no thrombus is seen
within the common femoral vein.


Brief Hospital Course:
69M with pontine CVA, CAD, dilated cardiomyopathy, and recurrent
aspiration pneumonia presenting with progressively worsening
dyspnea over 2.5 weeks and hypoxic respiratory failure likely
secondary to HCAP vs aspiration PNA/pneumonitis
.
#. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient presented with indolent
worsening of SOB, cough and sputum. He developed hypoxic
respiratory failure requiring intubation. Differential diagnosis
included CHF, health-care associated pneumonia, aspiration
pneumonia, pneumonitis or a combination thereof. Patient was
treated empirically with vanc/cefepime/flagyl/levaquin. Sputum
cx grew pseudomonas and based on sensitivities, patient
completed course of ceftazidime. Patient became afebrile and
leukocytosis trended down. To evaluate for worsening CHF,
patient had TTE which showed stable low EF (<20%). LENIs were
negative for PE, although he did have superficial venous
thrombosis that did not require any intervention. The patient's
continued hypoxemia and inability to wean off the vent were
attributed to volume overload, since pt had received several
liters IVF on presentation in the setting of sepsis and
hypotension and his Lasix had been held. Patient was diuresed
with
