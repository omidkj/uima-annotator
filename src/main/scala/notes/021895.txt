HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient a 24-year-old female
with end-stage renal disease secondary to hereditary
oxalosis.  The patient was called in from home on [**2117-4-11**] for combined kidney and liver transplant.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for end-stage renal
disease secondary to primary hereditary oxalosis.  The
patient has had two previous renal transplants done in [**2093**]
and [**2103**].  Both these occurred secondary to recurrent
oxalosis.  Her past medical history is also significant for
hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux disease.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for renal transplants in
[**2103**] and [**2093**].  The patient has had multiple upper extremity
dialysis access catheters as well as grafts.  The patient
currently has a left leg AV graft placed on [**2116-9-12**].
The patient also underwent a transplant nephrectomy of her
left renal allograft on [**2117-3-12**].

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Include atenolol 50 mg, Protonix
40 mg once daily, vitamin B 300 mg three times daily, Paxil
38 mg three times daily, Renagel 1600 mg three times daily,
Coumadin 2 mg once daily, Nephrocaps, and Ambien as needed.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  She is a Caucasian
female, approximately 40 kilos.  She was afebrile with normal
vital signs on admission.  Her OP were noncontributory and
clear.  Her HEENT revealed sclerae were anicteric.  The
pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  The extraocular muscles were intact.  The
chest was clear to auscultation.  Heart revealed she had a
[**3-21**] murmur in the left upper sternal border.  Her chest was
clear bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft with normal bowel
sounds.  She had a right iliac fossa catheter incision and a
left iliac fossa catheter incision.  She had a midline
incision through which her last nephrectomy was performed.
Her extremities were warm without cyanosis with good pulses.
Her left upper extremity had an AV graft in place.

IMPRESSION:  She is a 24-year-old female with end-stage renal
disease secondary to hereditary oxalosis, on hemodialysis.
The patient underwent frequent hemodialysis to lower her
system oxalate load prior to transplantation.  A suitable
kidney and liver became available from the same donor, and
she was admitted for a combined liver and kidney transplant.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2117-4-11**].  The patient underwent ultrafiltration to again lower
her oxalate level.  This was done prior to transplantation.
The patient underwent combined kidney and liver
transplantation on [**2117-4-11**].  Of note, during the
procedure the liver was placed in orthotopic position.  It
was done utilizing piggyback technique.  At the completion of
her portal anastomosis there appeared to be some thrombus in
the portal vein.  Therefore the anastomosis was taken down
and thrombectomized and redone with good result.  She had a
replaced left and replaced right hepatic arteries, both of
which were small.  Therefore, we utilized an aortic conduit
to revascularize the hepatic artery.  At the completion of
the liver procedure the patient was dry, and a kidney
transplantation was performed with a good result, and the
patient made initial urine.  The patient was taken to the
ICU.  However, on the first postoperative day just having
normalization of her liver function tests her AST and ALT
increased and a Doppler exam revealed thrombosis of her
aortic conduit.

She was taken back to the Operating Room on [**2117-4-12**]
where she was found to have a kink of her aortic conduit
under the caudate lobe.  The kink was removed.  The graft was
opened and thrombectomized with return of flow, however,
particularly the left lobe of the liver, appeared mottled.
We were able to achieve Doppler signals in both left and
right lobes of the liver.  The patient was washed out and
closed and brought to the ICU.

She dropped her hematocrit on [**4-13**] - which was
postoperative days two and one - and was returned to the
Operating Room for bleeding.  Her hematocrit had decreased to
17.  Rapid resuscitation led to elevation of her PA
pressures.  She was taken to the Operating Room for
exploration, at which time the liver appeared acutely
congested secondary to her high PA pressures.  CVVH was
initiated to decrease her pressures intraoperative.  A TEE
demonstrated decreased ventricular function.  Hemostasis was
achieved.  The left lobe of the liver appeared poorly viable.
Biopsies were taken of the left and right lobes of the liver.
Drains were placed, and the abdomen was closed temporarily.
Postoperatively, CVVH was continued.  She had been given 2 mg
of Prograf, and her tacrolimus level rose as high as 27.  She
became anuric.  We achieved a negative fluid status using
CVVH.  Her postoperative LFTs revealed her transaminases had
increased over 10,000 and slowly decreased.  Liver function
was adequate; however, she had episodes of hypoglycemia which
were concerning.

She returned to the Operating Room on [**4-15**] for exploration
and second look.  Because the left lobe now compared and to
prevent episodes of sepsis secondary to infection,  left
lateral segmentectomy was performed.  The abdomen was washed
out.  Drains were placed.  She was returned to the ICU.
Postoperatively, she gradually became hemodynamically
unstable.  CVVH was discontinued secondary to hemodynamic
lability.  She required pressors including dopamine and
Levophed.  Her hemodynamic status normalized with intravenous
fluid resuscitation.  LFTs continued to decrease.  Bilirubin
remained 5.

On [**2117-4-16**] in the afternoon she developed
supraventricular tachycardia with aberrant conduction and
widening of QRS complex.  Cardiology was consulted.
Interrogation of her EKG leads as well as interrogation by
placing atrial wires revealed that she had a sinus rhythm
with aberrancy and a long PR interval of approximately one
second.  This was unable to be remedied with atrial pacers.
A pacing wire was placed.  On each episode of tachycardiac
with this rhythm she developed hypotension to the 40s.  This
resolved with increasing doses of Levophed and fluid
resuscitation.  These bouts became more frequent over the
course of the evening of [**4-16**] and the early morning of
[**4-17**].  Efforts were made to normalize her electrolytes and
her acid base status.  Bicarbonate was given for metabolic
acidosis.  At approximately 5:00 o'clock in the morning on
[**4-17**] she developed another recurrent episode with
hypotension; however, her pressure continued to decrease, and
despite increasing doses of Levophed, an amp of epi, calcium,
and bicarbonate she lost her rhythm and CPR was inititated,
ALS protocol was initiated.  Despite attempts to pace,
defibrillate, multiple rounds of  ACLS protocol including
calcium and bicarbonate, multiple rounds of Accutane and
epinephrine, we were unable to regain a sustainable blood
pressure or cardiac rhythm.  She had positive breath sounds
bilaterally with no evidence of pink pneumothorax or
pneumothorax.  She had a previous echo demonstrating no
pericardial tamponade.  Despite maximum efforts, we were
unable to return cardiac rhythm or blood pressure.  Family
was present and were able to visit with [**Known firstname 698**].  A code was
called, and time of death was 5:20 a.m. on [**2117-4-17**].
