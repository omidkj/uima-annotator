lady with a history of thyroid cancer metastatic to lung with

radioactive iodine treatment which she has subsequently
failed and has extensive localization in the neck. She is
also status post Guillain-[**Location (un) **] syndrome with diaphragmatic
paralysis which initially required tracheostomy in [**2142**]. She
required another tracheostomy in [**2145**] for recurrent
pneumonias which she has kept until this time. However, she
had progressive difficulty with trach changes and
bronchoscopy on the day of admission showed 100 percent
obstruction of the trachea above the tracheostomy tube by a
mass consistent with a tumor. The patient has not been able
to phonate since [**2151-9-22**] when her current
tracheostomy tube was placed. She additionally requires
ventilatory support at night and is on trach collar during
the day.

INITIAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile.
Heart rate was in the 90's and atrial fibrillation. Blood
pressure was 136/66. Respiratory rate was 25. O2 sat was 99
percent on trach collar. Initial exam - alert, ill-appearing
female in no apparent distress. Lungs - adequate breath
sounds bilaterally. Heart - irregularly irregular. Abdomen
was soft with positive bowel sounds, nontender. Extremities
are warm with no edema. Neuro - grossly intact.

LABORATORY:  White count was 5.2 with a hematocrit of 39.1,
potassium 4.1, BUN and creatinine 10 and 0.7. INR was 1.2.
EKG showed atrial fibrillation at 97 and chest x-ray shows
multiple pulmonary metastases.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 57942**] was admitted to the
hospital to the Intensive Care Unit overnight because of her
requirement for ventilatory support. On hospital day #2, she
was taken to the Operating Room with Interventional
Pulmonology where she underwent flexible and rigid
bronchoscopy. They saw the upper trachea 100 percent
obstructed by tumor. This was excised and debrided and a No.
4 Shiley tracheostomy tube was placed. There were no
complications. The patient tolerated the procedure well. She
was transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit, ventilated
by her tracheostomy. On postoperative day #1, she was weaned
back to trach collar and deemed stable for discharge to home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Tracheal obstruction status post
excision, debridement and tracheostomy change.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Same as admission medications.
