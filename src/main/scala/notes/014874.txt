Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted postoperatively after undergoing an
aortobifemoral bypass.  Please see the operative report for full
details of the surgery.  She remained intubated and was admitted
to the Cardiovascular ICU postoperatively.  She was extubated
the following morning.  Her hemodynamics remained stable postop
and she remained euvolemic.  She was noted to have a fever POD1
overnight and she was empirically started on IV antibiotics for
a possible pneumonia as she had copious sputum production.  Her
epidural was removed on POD2 and she remained pain controlled on
an IV then PO pain regimen.  She was started on plavix and
gently diuresed on POD2.  On POD3 she was transfered to the VICU
in good condition.  She was started on sips of clear liquids on
POD3 and advanced to regular on POD4.  Her home medications were
all resumed.  Her antibiotics were discontinued POD4 as she no
longer had sputum production and CXR was negative for
infiltrates and she remained without a leukocytosis.  She
initially was on bedrest with venodynes for DVT prophylaxis and
her activity was liberalized POD3 and she was out of bed
ambulating with minor nursing assistance on POD4 & 5.  She was
seen by physical therapy and cleared for discharge home.  She
was discharged to home on POD 5 in good condition, ambulating
independently, tolerating a regular diet, and with adequate pain
control.
