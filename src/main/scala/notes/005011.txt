History of Present Illness:
86 year old Male sent from [**Hospital6 **] for urgent
management of spinal cord compression due to L1 vertebral burst
fracture, and orthospine requested medical co-management.
Patient also with Left mainstem aspiration of food, virtually
obstructing the bronchus. Patient initially presented to OSH
after falling backwards while brushing his teeth, presumed to be
retropulsion due to his parkinson's disease. Patient did not
lose consciousness. Patient reports marked pain at lumbar area
post-fall, but was able to ambulate. Over the next week his pain
progressed to the point he could no longer ambulate. Over the
next 3 weeks he was bed bound.

He was seen at a hospital in [**Doctor First Name 5256**], and an x-ray showed
a L1 fracture of undeterminate age. He returned to
[**State 350**], and was sent by his PCP to [**Hospital3 **]. While
there he was noted with hypoxic, and imaging there was
consistent with an aspiration pneumonia, and he was started on
vancomycin/Zosyn. A CT of his back, along with MRI demonstrated
a communuted fracture of L1 with cord-compression. He is
transferred for possible surgical repair.

Of note, he suffered an NSTEMI in [**5-10**], which was medically
managed.

At OSH, he did not have leukocytosis, but on arrival here it had
progressed to 17 on arrival here. He was afebrile at the OSH as
well.

Brief Hospital Course:
#. Cord Compression due to L1 burst fracture secondary to
traumatic mechanical fall: On admission, the patient complained
of excruciating pain in his back and legs. On exam, he was able
to wiggle his toes, but unable to lift his legs from a supine
position without substantial pain. He also had decreased light
touch sensation in the lower extremities bilaterally. Imaging
from OSH showed an L1 burst fracture. He was placed on bedrest,
and his pain was controlled with dilaudid. Ortho/spine was
consulted and recommended surgical decompression for
stabilization of the spine. On HD3, he underwent T10-L3
decompression.
.
#. Aspiration Pneumonia, Dysphagia, Leukocytosis: On admission,
the patient was afebrile, but had an elevated white blood cell
count of 17. OSH imaging showed material in the left mainstem
bronchus and left lower lobe collapse, likely due to aspiration.
He was made NPO and started on IV cefepime and flagyl. Pulmonary
was consulted, and on HD2, he was transferred to the MICU for
bronchoscopic removal of foreign material in the left mainstem
bronchus. Gram stain and culture of the material was sent. Gram
stain returned 2+ gram positive rods and 1+ yeast. Culture
returned positive for yeast. An NG tube was placed, and he was
restarted on all essential medications prior to surgery.
.
#. Parkinson's Disease: On admission, the patient was made NPO
for aspiration risk and sinemet was held. An NG tube was placed
on HD2; neurology was consulted and recommended restarting
sinemet, which was resumed at his home dose.
.
#. Severe Malnutrition: On admission, the patient, per the
daughter's report, had lost upwards of 40 pounds over the last
three months. Nutrition was consulted, and an NG tube was
placed. Tube feeds were started, though they were periodically
held, as he was NPO after midnight prior to surgery. Speech and
swallow consult was deferred until he was post-op.
.
#. CAD, NSTEMI in [**5-10**], atrial fibrillation: On admission, the
patient was NPO for aspiration risk. He was rate controlled on
IV metoprolol, titrated up to goal HR of 60-70. An NG tube was
placed and he was restarted on metoprolol and statin. Aspirin
and coumadin were held prior to surgery.
.
#. Sacral Decubitus Ulcer Stage 1: On admission, the patient had
stage I sacral decubitus ulcers on the bony surfaces of his
back, likely worsened by poor nutrition. Wound care was
consulted and recommended dressings for the ulcers, an air
mattress to relieve pressure, and frequent rolls.
.
Full Code, although family considering change to DNR/DNI.
Daughter concerned that he may not have a truly meaningful
recovery, although is aware that even from a comfort standpoint
the surgery may be helpful.
.
On [**9-7**] decision was made to make patient CMO status.  Pt was
extubated and sunsequently developed agonal respirations, with
bradycardia and hypotension.  Pt soon passed.  TOD 23:47.
Immediate cause of death: Cardiopulmonary arrest.  Chief cause
of death: Respiratory Failure.  Family does not wish for
autopsy.  Condolences from the orthopedics team expressed to
family for their loss.
