History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4401**] is a 55 year-old man with a history of diabetes and
COPD who presents with shortness of breath.
.
In speaking with the patient, he reports feeling short of breath
since "leaving the hospital". Wears 3 liters of oxygen during
the day and at night. In [**Location (un) 1131**] the referall note from [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], states that the patient "complained of pain at 2pm and
SOB. O2 sat 75-8-% on O2 and neb was given + PRN atrovent
without effect. Pt. is alert and oriented. His face is swollen
and both hands are swollen. VS T 99.5, P136, RR 24, BP 162/87."

.
The sister reports that the patient has had approximately four
months of upper extremity swelling. The work-up for this has
included an echo on [**12-5**] which has not yet been read but which
shows a mildly thickened LV and a large TR gradient.
.
Per EMS report, noted to be 97% with unclear FiO2.
.
In the ED, T 99.2, BP 143/101, HR 102, RR 22, O2 96% on RA.
Saturation decreased to 86% on room air then 85% on 5 liters and
was placed on 35% venti mask with sats up to 89-91%. Treated
with azithromycin 500mg IV, ceftriaxone 1g IV, solumedrol 125mg
IV and multiple combivent inhalers.

IMPRESSION:
1. Limited evaluation. No evidence of pulmonary artery embolism.
2. Diffuse centrilobular emphysema with bullae.
3. Prominence of main pulmonary artery may suggest underlying
pulmonary artery hypertension. Correlate clinically.
4. Atherosclerotic coronary artery calcifications.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2138-12-7**] 3:46 AM
AP CHEST: The heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar
contours are unremarkable. Pulmonary vascularity is within
normal limits and there is no evidence of overt edema.
Hyperinflation of the lungs are again noted. Question is raised
of subtle retrocardiac and left basilar opacity, more prominent
compared to [**Month (only) 116**]. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
.
ECG Study Date of [**2138-12-7**]  4:54:18 AM
Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Left anterior fascicular
block. Modest right ventricular conduction delay pattern. Since
the previous tracing of [**2138-6-18**] sinus bradycardia is absent and
further left axis deviation is now seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
55 year-old man with history of COPD, diabetes, hepatitis C and
prior alcohol use who presents with hypercarbia and chronic
upper extremity swelling.
.
1. Hypercarbia:
Patient has a known history of COPD with prior bicarb values in
the high 30s. No prior ABG to assess pCO2 in past. ABG indicated
large degree of hypercarbia with respiratory acidosis, though
the level of acidemia does not seem as severe as the hypercarbia
which may suggest chronicity. He briefly required BIPAP, which
rapidly improved his hypercarbia and pH to closer to baseline
level. He continued to have well compensated hypercarbia
thoughout his stay. He was initially given azithromycin and
prednisone, both were discontinued before he was discharged. He
was given  nebulizers throughout his stay.
- cont Nebs (atrovent and albuterol)
.
3. Upper extremity swelling:
Unclear etiology. Though he does appear to have TR there is no
lower extremity swelling which would be more consistent. A
portal or liver process is possible as well, especially given
his prior alcohol use, hepatitis and the presence of RUQ pain.
The liver and spleen were unremarkable on CT in [**Month (only) 116**]. The
possibility of a complication s/p Whipple could be considered
given the temporal association. LFTs were normal during his stay
and no further workup was undertaken.  His swelling improved
transiently while on prednisone, but whether the prednisone
contributed to the improvement is unclear.
.
4. History of PE with IVC filter:
Patient states he is currently on coumadin though his INR is not
therepeutic. In speaking with the sister and patient, this is
for prior PE in [**2137**]. From discussion with his PCP,[**Name10 (NameIs) **] did not
restart coumadin in a previous admission as she felt his risks
outweighted the benefits given history of GI bleed.  He was
given sc heparin for prophylaxis during his stay.
.
5. Diabetes: He was given his home NPH as well as SSI. He did
require extra insulin while taking steroids.  His insulin should
continue to be titrated to his blood sugars as they are probably
currently transiently unstable from his hospital stay and
prednisone.
.
6. Hypertension: He has had a somewhat wide range of SBP. He may
benefit from an antihypertensive as an outpatient,
