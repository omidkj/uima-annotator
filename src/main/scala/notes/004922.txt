History of Present Illness:
77F with PMH significant for COPD on 3L home 02, CHF, DM, CVA
(h/o frequent asp PNAs), schizophrenia, AF, HTN, discharged
today from [**Hospital1 2177**] (hospitalized from [**Date range (1) 21502**]) for COPD
exacerbation/PNA, on arrival to [**Hospital3 **] found to have bp
70/30 HR 149, was observed to be vomiting and cyanotic. Taken to
[**Hospital1 18**] as was closest ED given HD instability. During her stay at
[**Hospital1 2177**] she was treated with a complete steroid taper/nebs and
CTX/axithromycin for COPD exacerbation/PNA and UTI. In ed
initial VS: 98.3 SBP 140s HR 130s (AF) sats high 90s on 15L NRB.
Mild respiratory distress with mucous production initially,
responded to suction, initial ABg 7.27/82/364, off 02 ABG
improved to 7.32/77/88. CXR significant only for LLL
atelectasis. Mildly + UA, elevated WBC. Had distended abdomen,
reported to be vomiting, distented colon on KUB but was
stooling. Given zofran. Also recived flagyl/levo for c.diff/asp
PNA as well as linezolid given history of VRE in urine and for
additional MRSA HAP coverage. Had normal lactate and CEs. AF
with RVR did not respond to 1L NS, given 10mg IV dilt and 30mg
PO dilt with response to 90s. Given IV solumedrol for COPD flare
given acute on chronic respiratory acidosis. At time of transfer
sats low 90s on 4L face mask. On interview pt is a poor
historian. She is oriented to self, not to date or place. She
does not know why she is here..." I fell...a while ago and hit
my head."

ROS was otherwise essentially negative. The pt denied fevers,
night sweats, chills, headaches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation, cough, hemoptysis, wheezing, shortness of breath,
chest pain, palpitations, or joint pain. Does endorse some
dysuria, states this is how she usually feels when she has a
UTI.

Brief Hospital Course:
77 year old woman with COPD on home 02, history of CVAs with
multiple aspirations, AF, CHF presents immediately after
discharge from OSH for a COPD admission, with hypotension,
tachycardia, respiratory distress, and leukocytosis.
.
1. Respiratory distress: The patient's ABG was consistent with
acute on chronic respiratory acidosis.  In the setting of
observed vomiting, aspiration was high on the differential.  She
was treated empirically for aspiration PNA with Flagyl and
Levaquin.  CXR was negative for PNA, and these antibiotics were
stopped after 12 hours.  However, an aspiration event with
consequent pneumonitis was considered likely.  A COPD
exacerbation was also on the differential.  Supporting data
included her leukocytosis(albeit in the setting of recent
steroids at OSH) and sputum production. She was treated with
nebulizers and prednisone for 3 days.  There was no evidence of
CHF exacerbation on exam or by history (per OSH TTE in [**2-26**], EF
65%).  Her respiratory status continued to improve, and she was
transferred out of the ICU shortly after her arrival.  On the
floor, her oxygen saturation improved to baseline (on [**12-23**] L O2
with O2 Sats in the high 90's) within 1 day.
.
2. UTI: Initial UA showed WBC.  Because of the past h/o of VRE,
the pt was given a single dose of linezolid prior to culture
being sent.  She did not complain of urinary symptoms.  No
further antibiotics were given for this.
.
3. Diarrhea: The patient had marked leukocytosis and loose
stools.  In the setting of recent hospitalization and
antibiotics, c-diff was on the differential.  She was treated
with PO metronidazole.  C diff toxin was negative x 1. Her
symptoms improved rapidly and metronidazole was discontinued. IF
diarrhea returns would have a low threshold for restarting
flagyl.
.
4. h/o aspiration: The patient has history of multiple CVAs with
complicating aspirations, and aspiration was thought to be a
likely cause of this admission.  She was noted by the nurses to
be unable to handle regular food without coughing fits.  Speech
and swallow evaluation from prior admission recommended
nectar-thickened liquids and pureed solids.  This evaluation was
repeated during this admission and her diet was advanced to
include ground solids with nectar thickened liquids. They
suggested a re-evaluation in 1 week.
.
5. atrial fibrillation: The patient was on diltiazem for rate
control as an outpatient.  She had not been anticoagulated, per
old notes, due to fall risk.  She has all CHADS risk factors
including prior stroke, putting her at very high risk for
recurrent stroke.  Aspirin and diltiazem were continued, and the
discussion about possible anticoagulation going forward was
deferred to her primary care physician for outpatient
management.
.
6. DM:  Fingersticks were elevated as high as the 400's in the
setting of prednisone.  She received NPH and sliding scale
insulin.
.
7. CHF: EF per OSH report was 65% with nl LV function.  Patient
was euvolemic to dry on exam.
.
8. Hypertention:  Diltiazem was continued.  Clonidine was held
in the setting of hypotension. Her blood pressure remained
stable off clonidine, and this medication was discontinued.
.
9. Hyponatremia: The patient had a history of psychogenic
polydipsia and was mildly hyponatremic on admission. Free water
was restricted.
.
10. Schizophrenia: Haldol was continued at outpatient dose.
.
The patient was DNR/DNI throughout her stay.
