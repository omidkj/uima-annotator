Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 15716**] is an 84 year old female with CAD s/p CABG on [**2138-7-29**],
AS, recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on vanco for MRSA pneumonia
who now presents with worsening shortness of breath and
increasing oxygen requirements. She reports ongoing productive
cough though her cough is weak. She denies fevers, chills, chest
pain. She reports stable PND. She is unable to comment on
orthopnea. She denies diarrhea, constipation, dysuria. She
reports that she remains mostly in bed following her previous
admission for pneumonia.
.
Of note patient has a history of PE, but is anticoagulated with
coumadin for A. fib (INR 4.5 on admission).
.
In the ED, vitals were 97.9, HR 74, BP 106/48, 100% on 3LNC. In
ED, she got vanco, cefepime, lasix. Her blood pressure fell to
80/32 after receiving lasix 20 IV, but responded to a fluid
bolus. She was admitted to the MICU due to frequent suctioning
requirements. She was evaluated by cardiac surgery who
recommended admission to medicine.

Social History:
She is widow and lives alone, but has been at rehab since
surgery.  She does not drink or smoke.  She has three children.
She is retired from office work. Walk with walker at baseline


Family History:
Mother died of "heart attack" at age 68

Physical Exam:
VS: HR 84, BP 102/35, 96% on 6LNC, RR 22
Gen: frail, chonically ill appearing elderly female, tachypneic

HEENT: EOMI, dry mucous membranes
CV: RRR, 2/6 systolic murmur present and LUSB

Imaging:
CXR. [**2138-9-26**].
Retrocardiac opacity along with atelectasis and left basal
effusion, likely a combination of atelectasis and pneumonic
consolidation. Atelectasis is also seen in the right mid-zone.
Superimposed mild CHF. Followup AP and lateral radiographs are
recommended for further evaluation.
.
Echo. [**2138-9-29**].
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. A bioprosthetic
aortic valve prosthesis is present. The transaortic gradient is
higher than expected for this type of prosthesis. Mild to
moderate ([**11-20**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2138-8-4**],
the gradient across the prosthetic aortic valve has increased
and the aortic regurgitation is also increased. Estimated
pulmonary artery pressure also increase. TEE may be recommended
to further evaluate AVR.

CT Chest.  [**2138-9-27**].
IMPRESSION:
1. Improvement in non-hemorrhagic left pleural effusion, now
small.
Improvement of left lower lobe collapse.

2. Change in location and overall increased multifocal
pneumonia, now more in the right lower lobe, less marked in
right upper lobe, right middle lobe and left lower lobe.

3. Moderate cardiomegaly. Prior sternotomy for AVR. Extensive
atherosclerotic calcifications.

4. Enlargement of main pulmonary artery, suggesting pulmonary
hypertension.

5. Left adrenal adenoma.

6. Kyphosis and unchanged multiple compression fractures.


Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname 15716**] is an 84 year old female with CAD, AS,
diastolic CHF admitted with a worsening shortness of breath
likely due to worsening aspiration pneumonia and CHF.
.
Pneumonia.  Ms. [**Known lastname 15716**] was was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**]
with pneumonia, treated with levaquin and 14 day course of
vancomycin for MRSA PNA completed on [**9-18**].   She presented on
this admission with leukocytosis, though denies fevers or
chills.  She had significant secretions, requiring deep
suctioning due to patients poor cough.  She was treated with
Vanco/Zosyn and deep suctioning and her pneumonia improved.

CHF.  Patient had LE edema, shortness of breath.  She did not
tolerate diuresis ddut to low blood pressures.  An echo revealed
high pressure gradients across her recently (2 months prior)
replaced aortic valve suggesting and malfunctioning valve.  It
was recommended that she undergo TEE, but given her tenuous
respiratory status and her wishes to remain DNI, this was not
pursued.

H/o PE.  Patient was anticoagulated for PE from 6 months prior
and anticoagulated for A. fib.  However, developed significant
epistaxis due to frequent deep suctioning requiring reversal of
anticoagulation.  She was continued on amiodarone and remained
in NSR during hospital stay.

Epistaxis.  Patient required frequent nasal suctioning.  She
developed significant epistaxis with aspiration of blood.  Her
INR was therapeutic for A. fib and h/o PE. This was reversed
with FFP and vitamin K. She was evaluated by ENT and nasal
packing was placed.

CAD. S/p CABG on [**2138-7-29**]. No evidence of a cardiac event during
hospital stay.  She was continued on aspirin, simvastatin,
metoprolol during hospital stay.  Lisinopril was held due to
hypotension.

During hospital stay, patient became progressively more
tachypneic.  She had evidence of CHF but did not tolerate
diuresis due to hypotension.  She was treated wtih vancomycin
and zosyn for PNA and her pneumonia symptoms seemed to improved.
 She developed worsening shortness of breath, and ABG revealed
significant hypercarbia, likely due to tiring, worsening
pulmonary edema and pneumonia.  She did not respond to lasix
bolus or lasix drip.  After disucssion with patient and family,
the decision was made to make patient comfortable.  She was
given morphine for SOB.  Her family was at her bedside when she
passed away.
