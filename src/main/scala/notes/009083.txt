CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: assess for infiltrates/effusions

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
68 year old man s/p recent MVR with high WBC, FTW and pleural
effusion.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
assess for infiltrates/effusions
PORTABLE SEMIERECT CHEST.

COMPARISON: [**2174-4-18**].

INDICATION: Elevated white blood cell count.

A tracheostomy tube and central venous catheter remain in place.
Cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits. Focal
consolidation in the right upper lobe is unchanged allowing for
differences in patient positioning, but has improved compared to
an older study of [**2174-4-5**]. Additional multifocal areas
of consolidation in the left upper and both lower lobes show
interval improvement compared to the recent radiograph with
residual opacity most prominent in the left lower lobe. Small
left pleural effusion has also slightly improved.

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW  [**2174-4-20**] 1:45 PM

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW

Reason: r/o aspiration

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
68 year old man with s/p mvr
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o aspiration
INDICATION: Please rule out aspiration.

Video fluoroscopic images were obtained with assistance speech
pathologist. Barium of various consistencies was given to the
patient. No aspiration or penetration was seen. Delayed emptying
of valleculae and piriform sinuses was seen most likely
secondary to patient's weakness. Please look at the speech
pathologist's report in CCC for complete assessment and
recommendation.

IMPRESSION:
1. No aspiration or perforation is seen.
2. Slight retention of barium within the valleculae and piriform
sinuses most likely secondary to patient's weakness.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) 412**] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 413**]

MEASUREMENTS:
Left Atrium - Long Axis Dimension: *6.3 cm (nl <= 4.0 cm)
Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness: 0.7 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1
cm)
Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: *6.0 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm)
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 60% to 65% (nl >=55%)
Aorta - Ascending: 3.4 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm)

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement. No spontaneous echo contrast
in the body
of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA. No mass/thrombus in the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mild spontaneous echo contrast
in the body of
the RA. A catheter or pacing wire is seen in the RA and
extending into the RV.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D
images. Normal LV wall thickness. Moderately dilated LV cavity.
Normal
regional LV systolic function. Overall normal LVEF (>55%).
[Intrinsic LV
systolic function likely depressed given the severity of
valvular
regurgitation.]

LV WALL MOTION: basal anterior - normal; mid anterior - normal;
basal
anteroseptal - normal; mid anteroseptal - normal; basal
inferoseptal - normal;
mid inferoseptal - normal; basal inferior - normal; mid inferior
- normal;
basal inferolateral - normal; mid inferolateral - normal; basal
anterolateral
- normal; mid anterolateral - normal; anterior apex - normal;
septal apex -
normal; inferior apex - normal; lateral apex - normal; apex -
normal;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderate global RV free wall hypokinesis.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Focal calcifications in
ascending
aorta. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Partial mitral leaflet [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]. Mild mitral annular
calcification.
No MS. [**Name13 (STitle) 650**] (4+) MR. Eccentric MR jet.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.


PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
Physiologic
(normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the
procedure. Suboptimal image quality. The rhythm appears to be
atrial
fibrillation. Results were personally reviewed with the MD
caring for the
patient.

Conclusions:
PRE CPB The left atrium is markedly dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast is
seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No
mass/thrombus
is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage. Mild
spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the right atrium. No atrial
septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler, though can not completely rule out
a small PFO.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
