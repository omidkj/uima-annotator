Attending:[**Attending Info 11308**]
Chief Complaint:
altered mental status, unresponsiveness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right ventricular lead revision


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]-year-old white female with a recent PPM for CHB, history of
CAD, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and arthritis who presented to
[**Hospital6 33**] with altered mental status and failure of
RV capture.
.
Per ED report, the patient had a syncopal episode at her nursing
facility today.  The patient just had a pacemaker placed on
[**2161-2-17**] at [**Hospital3 **] after prolonged episodes of complete
heart block with asystole and no escape rhythm. The patient's
family subsequently reports that the patient had been
complaining of some discomfort in the left lower chest/ left
upper abdomen over the past 2 days.  They report this is worse
when the patient takes a deep breath.
.
EMS reports that the patient's pacemaker did not appear to be
functioning adequately as they found the patient's heart rate to
be between the 30's and 70's.  EMS was not able to obtan IV
access and an IO was placed.  There are no reports of any recent
chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, new back pain,
or trauma.  The patient was not able to answer review of systems
questions or identify exacerbating or alleviating factors.  The
patient did have some eccymosis about the left side of her head.
.
In the [**Hospital3 **], the patient was successfully intubated with
versed, fentanyl, and succinylcholine out of concerns that she
could not protect her airway and hypotension. A temporary pacing
wire was placed via the right IJ. The patient was bradycardic
and a CXR demonstrated a displaced right ventricular pacer wire.
 After consultation with the family, the patient was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and management.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], we noted complete loss of capture of the pacemaker RV
lead, and intermittent or absent capture of the temporary pacing
wire.  During periods of her complete paroxysmal heart block,
she was completely pacer dependent.  Given the tenuous
situation, she was taken to the OR emergently.  On Echo, there
was concern for RV lead displacement but no evidence of
tamponade or effusion.  She was taken to the OR and had the RV
lead repositioned to the RVOT.  She was intubated and sedated
and on dopamine. A repeat ECHO demonstrated no effusion or
complication of lead placement. Access is PIV, femoral 7-french
central line.
.
ROS: unable to obtain due to intubation/sedation.

IMPRESSION:
1. ETT approximately 1.7cm above the carina and should be
repositioned.
2. New right ventricular lead projects medial to the ventricular
apex, however it's exact position cannot be completely assessed
without a lateral view.
.
[**2161-3-2**]
pCXR
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**3-2**], the new right
ventricular lead appears to be in good position, substantially
less peripheral than on the previous study. Endotracheal tube
tip lies approximately 2 cm above the carina. Small layering
pleural effusion persists on the left and there is mild
bilateral basilar atelectasis.
.
ECHO [**2161-3-2**]
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The right ventricular pacing lead is identified in the right
ventricular cavity. It does not appear to extend beyond the free
wall (but images are focused). There is a trivial pericardial
effusion with no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
.
Compared with the prior study of earlier in the day, the right
ventricular pacing lead no longer appears to extend beyond the
free wall (though views are focused).
.
ECHO [**2161-3-1**]
Normal right ventricular cavity size and free wall motino. In
some views (clips [**4-7**]), the right ventricular pacing lead
appears to extend beyond the right ventricular free wall. There
is no pericardial effusion.
