on 2 liters nasal cannula.  In general the patient appeared
fatigued and in no acute distress.  HEENT pupils are equal,

ASSESSMENT/PLAN:  The patient is a 73 year-old male
presenting with fever, hypotension and tachycardia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Hypotension:  The patient was initially
felt to have evolving sepsis given accompanying fever and
question pneumonia on chest x-ray.  He responded well to
intravenous fluids with stabilization of his blood pressure.
He did not require pressors.  He was treated for the
pneumonia with Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin initially and
then switched to po Levofloxacin.  Due to the constellation
of hypotension, fever, rapid improvement and history of
pancreatic cancer lower extremity dopplers were obtained and
revealed bilateral deep venous thrombosis in the right common
femoral vein and the left common femoral vein.  He was
subsequently started on anticoagulation with heparin and
Coumadin.

cannula for oxygen supplementation, but over the course of

was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells with

outpatient pain regimen of Oxycontin and Oxycodone.
