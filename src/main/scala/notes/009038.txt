Allergies:
Penicillins / Aspirin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, CP, Nausea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old man with h/o COPD, recent NSTEMI who presents from
[**Hospital3 **] facility c/o SOB and chest pain and nausea for
most of Tuesday. He denies vomiting and abdominal pain. In the
ED, he was found to have a temperature to 101.3, retrocardiac
opacity on CXR, negative abdominal and pelvis CT. He was given
levofloxacin, flagyl, and 1800 cc of NS with systolic pressures
staying in the 90's. In the ED, he began ruling in for a non-ST
elevation MI; cardiology initially recommended only antiplatelet
therapy, but later recommended a heparin drip. While in the ED,
after receiving IVF and approximately one unit packed red blood
cells, the patient was noted to be in mild respiratory distress
with oxygen saturations of 89% despite 4L NC. He was otherwise
tachycardic to the 130s, but SBP stable in the 120s. A repeat
CXR showed congestive heart failure. He was treated with lasix
40mg IV x 2 with good results. When patient came to the ICU, he
denied CP and his breathing had improved.

Past Medical History:
coronary artery disease, s/p non-ST elevation myocardial
infarction, no prior catheterization performed as his son did
not feel he would want interventional measures; last echo ([**3-15**])
- EF 35% to 45%
gastroesophageal reflux disease
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
s/p cholecystectomy for gangrenous gallbladder in [**2139-7-13**]
dementia
iron deficiency anemia
anxiety
history of deep venous thrombosis


Social History:
Used to smoke 1 PPD for many years, quit several years ago.
Occasional ETOH on special occasions.
Lives in [**Hospital3 **], according to his son, he needs
assistance for everything other than feeding.
Per his son, he has dementia at baseline with poor short term
memory but is able to remember people and is usually oriented.


Family History:
Noncontributory

Physical Exam:
Tm 101.3 Tc 99.2 BP 94/30 HR 98 RR 38 O2Sat 93% 2L NC
Gen: Patient lying comfaortable in bed, able to communicate
Heent: EOMI, sclera anicteric, MMM, poor dentition
Lungs: Diffuse ins/exp wheezes
Cardiac: RRR S1/S2 grade II/VI holosystolic murmur at apex
Abdomen: distended, soft, +BS, NT no rebound or gaurding; giuac
neg in ED
Ext: no edema, DP 1+, trace PT
Neuro: AAOx3


Pertinent Results:
CXR: There appears to have been interval development of
interstitial opacities bilaterally consistent with pulmonary
edema. Again seen is a poorly defined retrocardiac
opacity/consolidation consistent with left lower lobe pneumonia.


CT Abdomen: No CT findings to explain the patient's abdominal
pain/distention. No bowel abnormalities. Sigmoid diverticulosis
without evidence of diverticulitis. Left base consolidation,
suspicious for pneumonia. Multiple simple hepatic cysts. Stable
tiny hypodensity in the left kidney, not well evaluated on this

study. Status post cholecystectomy with stable mild prominence
of the extrahepatic biliary system. Stable mild dilatation of
the infrarenal aorta. Short left common iliac dissection,
chronicity indeterminite.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment: [**Age over 90 **]yo man with COPD, recent NSTEMI admitted with
dyspnea, chest pain, and nausea; found to have a LLL pneumonia
by CXR and cardiac enzyme elevations suggestive of NSTEMI.
.
1. Respiratory distress - His dyspnea and hypoxia were most
likely secondary to the left lower lobe pneumonia in the setting
of severe lung disease. In addition, he most likely had a
component of congestive heart failure, especially given IVF and
PRBC administration in the first few days of his admission. His
pneumonia was treated with levofloxacin and vancomycin initially
given his allergy to penicillin.  There was no need to cover for
anaerobes as he did not aspirate.  Blood cultures were negative,
and he tested negative for influenza and legionella. He was
treated with supplemental oxygen, albuterol inhaler and
nebulizer treatments, atrovent nebulizer treatments,
fluticasone-salmeterol, and steroids.  He remained afebrile,
hemodynamically stable w/o any respiratory distress, and he will
complete a 14 day total course of antibiotics.
.
2. Chest pain - He was found to have cardiac enzyme elevations,
with [**Known firstname **] CKs in the 300s. He was treated with a nitroglycerin
drip in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to become chest pain free, and a heparin drip
for 48 hours. He was also treated with aspirin, plavix, and
metoprolol. His imdur was restarted when the nitro drip was
stopped. He had one additional episode of chest pain in the
setting of exertion (transferring); this resolved within five
minutes. His chest pain was frequently accompanied by nausea -
this is likely to be an anginal equivalent for him.  Pt had
troponin rise from 0.36 to 0.64 over the weekend.  Pt was
asymptomatic - denied CP, nausea, vomiting.  Considered other
causes of enzyme leak such as PE, CHF, renal failure or demand
ischemia.  Given his baseline renal insufficiency and CHF, this
troponin increase could be due in part to those causes.  He was
started on lovenox 70mg q12 and continued on this for 3 days.
Also, given that his CKs were flat, he is not an ideal candidate
for cardiac cath, and he is already on appropriate medical
management, the team felt that there were no further
interventions for this patient.  Would continue to manage
symptomatically and continue current cardiac regimen.
.
3. CHF - On last ECHO, his LVEF was 35-45%. He went into
pulmonary edema after receiving IV fluids and PRBCs. He was
monitored clinically for signs of overload and treated as
needed.
.
4. HTN - He was continued on a beta-blocker, to keep his
SBP<110.
.
5. GERD - He was treated with a proton pump inhibitor.
.
6. CRI - At baseline, his creatinine is 1.3-1.6; it was stable
throughout his hospital stay.
.
7. Anemia - The patient has chronic iron deficiency anemia and
was transfused approximately one unit of packed red blood cells
in the emergency room. His hematocrit remained stable throughout
the hospitalization.
.
