Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1406**]
Chief Complaint:
exertional chest pain/stable angina

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2115-1-7**] Coronary artery bypass x2:  Left internal mammary
artery to left anterior descending, and reverse saphenous vein
graft to ramus.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 91391**] is a 57 year old gentleman with a PMH significant
for severe hypertension, mild hyperlipidemia, and a family
history of heart disease, who presented to his PCP at the end of
[**Month (only) **] with two months of exertional sub-sternal chest pain.
His symptoms started at the end of [**Month (only) 205**] when he noticed burning
substernal pain while walking his dog briskly.  Symptoms were
predictable in onset with exertion and always subsided with
rest.  The pain occassionally radiated to his left arm, but he
denies nausea/vomiting or diaphoresis.  Never had symptoms at
rest.  He presented to his PCP who sent him to the [**Hospital1 3597**] ED,
where he was noted to have hypertension to 244/110.  His blood
pressure medications were changed at that time.  He has
long-standing hypertension, but does not recall his prior
regimen before this change.  He also underwent exercise MIBI at
[**Hospital3 7362**], during which he went 4 minutes 36 seconds on a
[**Doctor First Name **] protocol and developed 2mm ST depressions in the inferior
lateral leads. He did experience chest discomfort. Imaging
showed a large and severe defect involving the mid anterior wall
extending to the anterior apex.
In addition there was another defect involving the mid to distal
septum. There was transient ischemic dilation of the left
ventricle. LVEF was noted at  64%. He was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
left heart catheterization which revealed multivessel coronary
artery disease.Cardiac surgery was consulted for coronary
revascularization.

Past Medical History:

Imaging/Studies:
Cardiac Cath [**2115-1-4**]:
1. Selective corobary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA is a
large
caliber vessel with a 30% ostial stenosis. The LAD has an ostial
90%
stenosis prior to an ulcer, followed by a 95% stenosis. There is
diffuse
disease through the mid-LAD to 60%. The LAD is short and does
not extend
to the apex with TIMI 1 flow. The Lx is a large caliber vessel
with
diffuse plaquing. There is a modest ramus/OM1 with proximal 65%
stenosis. There is a moderate OM2 with moderate origin stenosis.
There
is a tiny OM3. There is a tortuous branching OM4 with mild
stenosis at
the origin of the lower pole. There is a large OM5/LPL that is
diffusely
diseased to LPL2 with 60% mid-vessel stenosis. The RCA has an
ectatic
origin with a proximal-mid tubular 50% stenosis. There is
diffuse
plaquing throughout with a distal 30% stenosis into RPDA with
50%
stenosis at the origin of its first lateral sidebranch. There
are faint
collaterals to the LAD.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated
left-sided
filling pressures with LVEDP averaging 13, max 21 mmHg.
3. Left ventriculography revealed no mitral regurgitation, an
LVEF of
70%, and no regional wall motion abnormalities.
4. Left radial artery hemostasis achieved with TR Band.

Chest Xray PA/Lat [**2115-1-4**]:
IMPRESSION:
Heart is normal size. Lungs are clear. Fullness in the right
tracheobronchial angle is explained by fat deposition in the
mediastinum
projecting over a transverse process of the thoracic spine.
There is no good evidence for central lymph node enlargement or
pleural abnormality. Lungs fully expanded and clear.

TTE [**2115-1-5**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
No pathologic valvular abnormality seen. Mildly dilated aortic
root and ascending aorta.

Renal Artery Ultrasound [**2115-1-5**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Normal kidneys and bladder.
2. Segmental arterial resistive indices within normal limits,
ranging from
0.58 to 0.67. No evidence of renal artery stenosis.

CTA Coronaries [**2115-1-6**]:
Impression:

1.Extensive involvement of the coronary arteries by diffuse and
focal
abnormalities as described in details in the body of the report.
Those findngs
in conjunction with focal areas of coronary arteries dilataions
ca raise the
suspicion of vasculitis with some degree of atherosclerosis as
well. Given the
lack of coronary calcifications in the presence of such an
extensive
unvolvement of coronary arteries, vasculitis might first
diagnostic
consideration.

2.Segmental and subsegmental pulmonary embolism.

3. Persistent Left SVC

Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric
