Pertinent Results:
AP portable chest [**2155-4-6**] at 8:40 a.m.:  No apparent change in
the position of the left subclavian central venous catheter
whose tip is in the left brachiocephalic vein.  There is opacity
at the right cardiophrenic angle, which appears increased when
compared to prior study, but this may be secondary to lesser
inspiration.  The patient is in mild failure.

Brief Hospital Course:
71yo male w/ known prostate ca, CAD s/p CABG, multiple PCI,
ischemic CMY EF 30%, restrictive lung dz on home o2 (usual
3liters), metastatic prostate CA, anemia, xferred from [**Hospital 35462**] (where presented for progressive dyspnea/ ? PNA) for ?
ACS w/ elevated CKs, but flat troponins. Marked cardiogenic
pulmonary edema, hypotensive (responded to fluids) on arrival
that improved w/ diuresis.   He was intially admitted to the
cardiology (telemetry floor).

EVENTS:
[**2154-4-2**] = Patient became hypotensive w/SBP in 60-70s wtih some
response to fluid boluses. Has had approx 2.5Liters via 500cc
boluses with his pressures holding in 90's and HR in 80s.
Patient's creatinine bumped to 2.3, and his urine output
dropped. EKG was unchanged, but cardiac enzymes were cycled and
CK were mildly elevated. Mid day it was reported that a temp of
100.6 had not been recorded on the vitals sheet. A potential
septic workup was initiated as a source of the hypotension w/
CXR (? retrocardiac PNA vs CHF), ABG (okay, not acidotic),
lactate (up to 2.4 from 1.6), chemistries w/ no anion gap. Blood
and urine cultures sent and initiation of Zosyn and Vancomyocin
empirically. Additionally, patient has been complaining of
increasing pain secondary to his prostate cancer. We increased
his morphine to 2-4mg from 2mg, however [**Month/Day/Year 2449**] have been
informed to give judisciously if signs of respiratory
depression/somnolence.  Patient began exhibiting waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**]
delirium x2 days which he has had several episodes of today.
MICU was made aware. AT 5pm started to improve after 3rd liter
of NS.  BP 105, mentation okay, o2 sats stable on 3 liters at
94% (note has EF 30%).

[**2154-4-3**] = Patient initially doing much better, maintaining
pressures, improved mentation, improving creatinine and urine
output, better pain control w/PCA. Received central line
secondary to non-functional peripherals and possible need for
future fluid boluses/reliable line. Continuing zosyn/vanc, with
cultures pending. At end of day, developed substernal chest
tightness w/increased depression on lateral leads. Relieved
w/nitro and rate controled w/10mg of IV lopressor(pushed 5 and
5). Heparin drip started, cardiac enzymes cycled.   He was
admitted to the CCU and taken for cardiac cath:

SIGNIFICANT DATA:
CATHETERIZATION:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Instent restenosis of the first diagonal branch.
3. Patent LIMA->LAD, SVG->OM2.
4. Successful PTCA of first diagonal.

COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary arteriogram of this right dominant system
revealed
angiographic evidence of three vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA
had mild diffuse disease. The LAD was totally occluded after the
first
diagonal branch. The first diagonal branch had a focal 95%
instent
restenosis distally. The LCX had moderate diffuse disease
throughout its
course with a totally occluded lower pole OM1 filling with
collaterals.
The RCA was not engaged.
2. Graft angiography revealed a patent LIMA->LAD and a patent
SVG->OM2.
3. Successful PTCA of the first diagonal branch with a 2.5x15mm
balloon.
Final angiography revealed 30% residual stenosis, no dissection.

The chest pain was thought to be demand ischemia in the setting
of pneumonia and anemia.  On [**4-6**] he was transferred back to the
cardiology floor.  Issues of hospital course briefly summarized
below.
