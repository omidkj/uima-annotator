Admission Date:  [**2192-9-20**]       Discharge Date:  [**2192-10-1**]


Service:  NEUROLOGY
BRIEF HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  This is a 79-year-old woman with
a past medical history of asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, hypertension, ITP, depression, increased
cholesterol and status post old cerebrovascular accident who
presents with unresponsivity at home.  She was brought to the
[**Hospital6 1708**].  Earlier this evening, she was
apparently in her usual state of health, but when the
daughter returned home from work, found her to be
unresponsive and basically responsive only to pain.
According to the daughter, her eyes were apparently initially
deviated to the left.

continued to be unresponsive there.  No adventitious
movements were seen.  The only other history that could be
obtained at that time was that she had apparently been
complaining of some headache for two to three days and had
had some nausea and vomiting at home on the day of admission,
but her general health and mentation had apparently been at
baseline.  Apparently, at home, she is able to ambulate
around the house, although she is limited by the fact that
she is blind from longstanding glaucoma.  Her mental status
is that she is apparently able to converse quite well with
her daughter, although she is Romanian speaking.

VITAL SIGNS:  In the Emergency Room, she was noted to have a
heart rate of 110.  Temperature was 99.8??????.  Blood pressure
was 128/86.  Respirations were 19 and pulse oximetry was 98%.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.
NECK:  Supple without mass.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation.
ABDOMEN:  Benign.

NEUROLOGIC:  She was unresponsive, but she was slated to
receive an MRI emergently upon admission to rule out stroke
and so she had received some sedation prior to me seeing her.
On cranial nerve exam, pupils were 4 mm, equal and poorly
reactive.  The eyes were midline without deviation.  GAG was
very weak.  Cephalic reflex was intact.  On motor exam, she
withdrew all four limbs to pain and would grimace.  Reflexes
were brisk, but symmetric throughout.

LABORATORY EXAM ON ADMISSION:  White count of 12.4, but
otherwise CBC was normal, except for a raised platelet count
of 773 which is chronic secondary to hydroxyurea treatment
for her ITP.  Coagulation studies were normal.  Chem-7 was
normal.  Amylase was mildly elevated at 142.  Urinalysis was
pending at that time.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Xalatan eyedrops
2.  Univasc 7.5 q day
3.  Levoxyl 0.025
4.  Lipitor 10
5.  Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizer and inhaler treatments
6.  Wellbutrin 100
7.  Prilosec 20
8.  Singulair 10
9.  Hydrochlorothiazide 25
10. Hydroxyurea 500
11. Aspirin daily

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was seen and accepted to the
Neurologic Intensive Care Unit.  She was initially intubated
in the Emergency Room for airway protection.  This was
quickly weaned off and she tolerated extubation well.  Her
mental status continued to remain depressed, however and she
was not completely responsive for several days.  She remained
in the Intensive Care Unit until [**9-24**] when she was felt to be
medically stable and thus be transferred to the floor.  At
that time, she was able to awaken to voice, but did not speak
spontaneously and continued to have very low level of
communication.  Per her daughter, this was definitely not at
her baseline and she was found to be fairly encephalopathic.
Her mental status would wax and wane somewhat and she was
intermittently oriented and then would become disoriented.
Communication was carried on by her daughter due to the
language barrier.

EEG was done to establish whether this initial event truly
was a seizure.  No activity was seen, however she had loaded
on Dilantin in the Emergency Department and it was decided to
keep her on Dilantin, although at a lower level at the end of
the therapeutic range.  She continued to have some low grade
fevers which were investigated.  Chest was found to be clear.
Urinalysis was negative.  She was seen by OT and PT who were
able to get her out of bed from time to time and it was found
that her functional status was actually better than what she
looked like in the bed, in that she was able to walk, albeit
slowly, and for short distances.  In the bed, she would adopt
a strange adducted posture of her leg and so x-ray of the hip
was obtained to rule out fracture around the time of her
initial event, but this was negative.

Once her mental status has improved, a full physical exam was
carried out in the presence of her daughter to facilitate
communication.  At that point in time, it seemed like her major
issues were that she still remained slightly decreased level of
consciousness and a little bit disoriented, as well as that she
had some right upper quadrant pain.  Further work up was obtained
in the form of a right upper quadrant ultrasound which was
negative.  Liver function tests were obtained which were also
negative.  An abdominal CT scan was done which was negative.  She
received a repeat MRI of the brain which showed no interval
change. MRI was done of the C-T and L-spine which showed
degenerative changes of the spine, but there was no acute
cord compression or cord edema.

She would also have episodes where she would complain of
shortness of breath which were felt to be related to
underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
While in house, the frequency of her nebulizer treatments was
increased with good outcome.  It was always somewhat
questionable whether or not the underlying comorbidities
including the lung disease might not be the cause of a toxic
metabolic encephalopathy in this patient, as this was felt to
be a likely good explanation for her deficits, despite the
lack of a hard findings on diagnostic testing.

She slowly improved over the course of her hospitalization
and became more consistently oriented during this time also,
although she was still intermittently drowsy throughout the
day.  However, in discussion with her daughter, it was felt
that medically she appeared stable and that she might benefit
more from rehabilitation facility at this point in time.  It
was decided that she would go to [**Hospital 2716**] Rehabilitation
Facility which is close to the daughter's home for management
there.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient was afebrile.  She was
hemodynamically stable.  She was respiratorily stable on
frequent nebulizer treatments.  She was not able to walk
safely without assistance at this time.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  She was to be discharged to rehabilitation
for further work on her functional goals.
