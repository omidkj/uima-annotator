Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**]
Chief Complaint:
Fatigue and pancytopenia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bone marrow biopsy

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 21540**] is a 57 year old with a PMH significant for HIV
with a recent admission at [**Hospital1 34**] for pancytopenia.  Per nightfloat
admission History and Physical, the patient states that he
initially started experiencing symptoms of dry cough and fatigue
at the end of [**Month (only) **]. Prior to this he has felt otherwise well in
good health.  The patient has been HIV positive since [**2099**],
stable until 3 weeks ago when presented to S. [**Hospital **] hospital
with fevers and pancytopenia.  He also endorses low grade fever
at that time. He denies having [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], sinus congestion, CP,
n/v/d, abd pain, rash, or lower ext swelling. He thus presented
to S [**Hospital **] Hosp on [**2110-7-31**]. There he was found to be pancytopenic
with WBC 1.9, Hct 16.5, Plt 11. His bili, AST/ALT were also
mildly elevated. He was therefore admitted there for 2+ weeks
for further work up. He presumably underwent bronch which was
neg for PCP (per patient). CT chest/abd was only notable for
fatty infiltration of the liver, spenomegaly, and mild
atelectasis. Other infectious work up was neg. He received
multiple transfusions, and underwent a bone marrow biopsy before
being discharged home. His bone marrow bipsy was thought to be
myelodysplasia. Upon follow up on [**8-20**], he was found to be
persistently pancytopenic. After discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was thus transferred for further work up. Of note,
he denies travel though he lives on [**Location (un) **]. He denies sick
contacts. [**Name (NI) **] has lost 10lbs since this began.  While there, he
received multiple transfusions, bone marrow bx preliminary dx
was myelodysplasia and he was discharged to home approximately a
week ago.

Repeat labs performed the day prior to admission at [**Hospital1 34**]
demonstrated WBC 1000 (WBC 1000 - 23 poly, 65 lymph, 12 mono, 1
nuc.rbc), hgb 7.9, hct 22.8, platelets 21. He was readmitted and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation of pancytopenia.  Of
note, bone marrow biopsy slides were sent to [**Hospital1 112**] for further
read.

In the ED, T 98.1, HR 100, BP 107/70, RR 18, 96%RA. Labs
confirmed pancytopenia/neutropenia. Pt subsequently spiked to
101.3. Pt was given Cefepime 2g IV x1, vanco added upon initial
transfer to the floors.

Currently, he states that he is fatigued but otherwise resting
comfortably without complaints.  On further questioning, he
states that he has been febrile in the past week up to 101-102.

Pertinent Results:
STUDIES:
CXR
The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. The lungs are
clear. There are mild degenerative changes seen in the mid
thoracic spine.

EKG: NSR, nl axis, intervals, early R wave progression,
non-specific STT changes. No priors for comparision

Bone Marrow bx [**2110-8-5**]: hypercellular marrow showing erythro
hyperplasia with left shift, myeloid left [**Hospital1 **] shift. NO
evidence of lymphoma. CD117 focally positive. GPH-A postive

TTE [**8-28**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%) Transmitral and tissue Doppler
imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses or vegetations
are seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass
or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 21540**] is a 57 year old gentleman with a PMH
significant for HIV diagnosed in [**2098**] transferred from [**Hospital1 34**] for
further diagnostic evaluation of pancytopenia found to have
leukemia.

# Pancytopenia: The patient was intially worked up for multiple
infectious etiologies and a bone marrow biospy was reobtained to
evaluate for cancer.  He had an inital bone marrow biospy at the
OSH which was inconclusive.  Leading diagnoses included
Ehrlichiosis (so he was started on doxycyline empirically while
the test was pending) and parvovirus (for which he received two
treatments of IVIG).  During workup for pancytopenia, DIC labs
were sent and were negative, as were peripheral smear for
schistocytes, as well as hemolysis labs which were consistent
with a moderate amount of hemolysis.  PCR of parvovirus returned
negative and IgG Ab was found to be positive and IgM was
negative.  Ehrlichiosis serologies were still pending at time of
admission from OSH records. Smear for babesia x 3 was negative.
On [**8-28**] the bone marrow biopsy results returned without evidence
of parvovirus infection and with evidence of erythroleukemia so
he was transferred to the oncology service for initiation of
chemotherapy.

# Neutropenic fevers: The patient was intially started on
cefepime for his fevers, however ID felt this was not needed and
it was stopped.

# SOB/Hypoxia: Likely secondary to anemia versus pulmonary
process. A chest CT in the OSH has shown no airway disease.  The
patient was transfused two times since admission for a Hct less
than 21.  He remained only mildly symptomatic on exertion. Pt
progressively became more hypoxia, requiring 4L O2 by NC at one
point. On [**8-30**], pt underwent bronchoscopy for the evolving
hypoxia. On [**8-31**], pt became acutely dyspneic while maintaining
his sats. ABG performed at the time was relatively unchanged
from prior, showing a respiratory alkalosis and possibly
worsened A-a gradient (PO2 83.) CXR showed no
consolidation/pneumothorax. Pt wa placed on a NRB and given
nebulizer treatment with improvement of dyspnea. He was
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management. In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he
transitioned back to 4LNC, satting 96% with reassurance by his
partner a
