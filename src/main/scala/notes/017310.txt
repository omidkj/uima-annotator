Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7223**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer from OSH for VT/ICD firing

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
57 yo M Mandarin speaking who has a PMH of VT s/p ICD placement
in [**12-10**], non-ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 25% who presents with
ICD firing and VT. His son translated for him and states that he
was in his usual state of health without recent illness, no
fevers, chills. His son says he had some non-discript chest
discomfort for several days. Non radiating. No palpitations,
SOB. The day of presentation, he was painting and noticed his
ICD fired. They called EMS. The ICD fired several times prior to
EMS arriving- his son says 7 times. EMS arrived and found he was
in VT with rate of 200. They gave him amio bolus of 300mg and
bolus of lidocaine 75mg x1. They gave him asa 325mg x1 and took
him to OSH. In route his ICD fired 2 more times, but has not
fired since then. There his potassium was 3.3, but I can not
find documentation that it was repleted. No magnesium. He was
given lidocaine bolus again 75mg and started on a gtt at 4mg/hr
and then transferred here.
.
In our ED, he was given 1L NS and continued on the lidocaine
gtt. He complained of some chest pain and was given 4mg of
morphine and 2 SL NTG tabs. He was admitted to the CCU for
further care. Labs were drawn but pending on time of transfer.
.
Of note, he was admitted in [**2141-1-3**] for similar ICD firing. His
sotalol was increased to 120mg [**Hospital1 **] at that time.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, red
stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain
currently, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

EKG's
[**4-15**]: Atrially paced and ventricularly sensed rhythm at 75 beats
per minute with A-V conduction delay and intraventricular
conduction defect of
the left bundle-branch block variety. Compared to the previous
tracing
of [**2141-1-6**] atrial pacing is new.
[**4-17**]:Atrial pacing with native ventricular conduction. Left
bundle-branch block. Compared to the previous tracing there is
no significant change.
[**4-18**]:Atrial paced rhythm with intrinsic A-V conduction. A-V
interval 0.24 seconds.
Left ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T wave changes. Compared to
the previous
tracing of [**2141-4-17**] the Q-T interval remains long. There is once
again no
evidence of left bundle-branch block and no diagnostic interim
change.
[**4-19**]: The rhythm is now ventricular paced with capture. Compared
to the previous tracing of [**2141-4-18**] the rhythm is now just
ventricular paced. QTc 465.
.
Echo: results pending.




Brief Hospital Course:
57 yo M with PMH of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 20-30%, VT
s/p ICD placement and now presents with VT and ICD firing.
.
# Rhythm: ICD fired several times and rhythm strips document VT.
He was noted to have hypokalemia which could have potentiated
his VT. He was admitted on a lidocaine drip, which controlled
his V-tach. Lidocaine drip was tapered off as his antiarrhytmics
were increased. Sotalol was increased to 80 TID, and Metoprolol
25mg [**Hospital1 **] started. However, as his blood pressure was
occaisonally low, Metoprolol was decreased to 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **]. It was
also noted that Sotalol increased his QTc substantially, and
Sotalol was then discontinued. Mexiletine was started at 200mg
TID. His electrolytes were closely monitored with goal of Mag
>2.5 and K >4.5. He had no further episodes of V-tach or NSVT.
He was monitored throught his hospital stay in the CCU on
telemetry.
.
# Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: Non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy with EF 20-30%. On admission he was slightly
volume overloaded with bibasilar crackles on exam. As these
crackles persisted, he was started on lasix 40 daily x3 days. He
never had dyspnea or hypoxia. He diuresed well and lasix was
decreased. On admission, he did was not taking any diuretic at
home. He was discharged on lasix 10mg daily. He will need a Chem
10 in one week to evaluate electrolytes and creatinine. To avoid
V-tach, magnesium should be avoid 2.5 and potassium above 4.5. A
repeat echo showed no changes, no pericardial effusion, no
decrease in EF.
.
# Mechanical aortic valve- INR was maintained from [**2-5**] on
coumadin
.
# Hypotension: The patient had occaisonal episodes of
hypotension to SBP 77. These episodes were transient and usually
resolved within 15-20min. He remained assymptomatic, mentating
well,
