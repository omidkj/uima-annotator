ADMISSION EKG:
Sinus tachycardia. Inferolateral ST changes likely [**2-10**] LV
hypertrophy.

RADIOLOGY:
[**2121-1-23**] CTA CHEST:
The study is limited by the suboptimal timing of the contrast
bolus. Allowing for these limitations, there is no evidence of
pulmonary embolism in the main, lobar, or segmental levels. The
assessment of subsegmental pulmonary arteries is limited.
There is minimal dependent atelectasis bilaterally. The lungs
are otherwise clear without pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
The mediastinal great vessels are intact. The heart is within
normal limits, without pericardial effusion. There is no
lymphadenopathy observed.

[**2121-1-23**] LENI's BILATERAL:
No DVT in bilateral lower extremities.

[**2121-1-24**] TTE:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is small.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
[**2121-1-27**] CXR: Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged and there is
distension of the azygous vein contour as well as prominence of
the pulmonary vascularity. These findings are accompanied by new
multifocal patchy opacities predominantly in the upper lobes and
perihilar regions. Observed findings may reflect asymmetrical
pulmonary edema, but coexisting aspiration or infections are
also possible in the appropriate setting. New small bilateral
pleural effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
#INFLUENZA A, ASTHMA EXACERBATION:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted with shortness of breath and chest pain in
setting of influenza A infection.  She was put on respiratory
precautions. She was not started on oseltamivir as she was
thought to be out of the window and most influenza viral strains
have been shown to be resistant to oseltamivir this year.
Work-up for MI was negative.  CTA of the lungs was negative for
PE;
