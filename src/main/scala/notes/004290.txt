Admission Date:  [**2148-1-5**]       Discharge Date: [**2148-2-12**]

Date of Birth:   [**2104-4-9**]       Sex:  F

Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 43 year old
African-American female with a past medical history
significant for severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
hypertension, and anxiety, who presented to [**Hospital1 346**] on [**1-5**], with one month
history of progressively increasing shortness of breath and
hypoxia.  The patient is followed closely by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 217**] on an outpatient basis.

Two weeks prior to admission, her FEV1 was found to be 0.36
and her FVC 1.13.  Her obstructive lung disease was so bad
that she was being considered a candidate for a lung
transplant.

In the Emergency Room, the patient was given treatment with
nebulizers, terbutaline, intravenous Solu-Medrol, intravenous
Levaquin and transient Heliox therapy.  Unfortunately, none
of these therapies seemed to work and the patient became
increasingly acidemic.  She was placed on Bi-PAP but
subsequently became increasingly tachypneic and tachycardic.
Her blood gas revealed a pH of 7.26, carbon dioxide of 65 and
O2 of 95 so as a result she was emergently intubated.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Review of systems before intubation was
remarkable only for a productive cough of yellow sputum.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Asthma / chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
3.  Anxiety.
4.  Mitral valve prolapse.
5.  Positive PPD status post INH therapy times six months.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Atenolol 50 q. day.
2.  Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 q. day.
3.  Singulair 10 q. day.
4.  Celexa 50 q. day.
5.  Clonazepam 0.5 q. day.
6.  Flovent twice a day.
7.  Serevent 2 twice a day.
8.  Albuterol q. four hours p.r.n.
9.  Nebulizers p.r.n. at home.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   The patient smoked one to two packs a day
for 15 years and quit in [**2147-1-14**].  She drinks
alcohol socially and denies any intravenous drug use.  She
has a 5 year old son.  [**Name (NI) 6419**] her parents are in the area.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Remarkable for a grandmother with lung
cancer.  There is no family history of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Temperature 98.9 F.; blood pressure
127/81; pulse 110; saturation of 100% on assist control of
600 by 8 with 8 of PEEP and 40% FIO2.  In general, before she
was intubated, the patient was visibly uncomfortable.  She
was unable to speak full sentences and was gasping for
breath, visibly having a difficult time breathing.  Pupils
are equal, round and reactive to light.  Extraocular muscles
are intact.  Sclerae anicteric.  Oropharynx was clear.  Neck
was supple without any lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.
Cardiac examination revealed a normal S1, S2, at a
tachycardic rate, no audible rubs, murmurs or gallops.  Lungs
revealed diminished air entry bilaterally with diffuse
expiratory wheezes and a prolonged expiratory time.  The
patient's breathing was labored and she was vigorously using
her accessory muscles of breathing.  Abdomen was mildly
protuberant, soft, nontender, nondistended, with good bowel
sounds and no masses.  Extremities revealed no cyanosis,
clubbing, edema or calf tenderness.  Neurologically, the
patient was a little somnolent but otherwise the examination
was non-focal and benign.

LABORATORY:  On admission notable for a white blood cell
count of 16.1, hematocrit of 41, platelets 310, BUN 16,
creatinine 0.7, bicarbonate 27.

Chest x-ray demonstrated hyperinflated lungs with flattened
diaphragms but no signs of any focal infiltrate consistent
with pneumonia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   In light of her chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease exacerbation, the patient was placed on
high dose steroids, frequent bronchodilators and adequate
antibiotic coverage with Augmentin initially.  She was
intubated and sedated appropriately.  Over time, it was
attempted to wean her from the ventilator, but unfortunately
as her pressure support was decreased to minimal levels, the
patient would become desynchronous with the ventilator,
requiring immediate paralysis for ventilation.

Even to this day, it is a mystery as to why these episodes
would occur.  The patient eventually received both a
tracheostomy tube and a PEJ tube via surgery.  She was given
tube feeds for nutrition and her vent settings were slowly
weaned to pressure support.  For her underlying anxiety
disorder, the patient was placed on an around the clock
regimen of Valium with p.r.n. doses of Ativan.

An EMG was performed and confirmed the diagnosis of critical
care polyneuropathy.  Because it took a while for the
patient's mental status to return to baseline off of all
sedation, a head CT scan was performed to evaluate for any
signs of an acute hypoxia.  Fortunately, the CT scan
confirmed the presence of a pan-sinusitis but no acute
cerebral injury.

For most of her hospital stay, the patient continued to have
frequent intermittent episodes of tachycardia and
hypertension which were most likely related to her underlying
anxiety disorder.  Secondary causes of hypertension such as
pheochromocytoma, carcinoid, and hyper-thyroidism were all
ruled out.

The patient's renal function remained excellent throughout
her hospital stay with occasional episodes of oliguria which
responded well to fluid boluses.  Iron studies were checked
and were found to be consistent with anemia of chronic
disease.  As a result, the patient was started on iron
supplements.  A hemolysis work-up was completely negative.

Her electrolytes were checked on a daily basis and were
repleted as needed.  She was placed on heparin subcutaneously
and Pepcid for adequate prophylaxis.  Towards the end of her
hospital stay, she developed a Methicillin Sensitive
Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia from a line infection.  She
was thus treated with adequate doses of Oxacillin for a total
14 day course through her PICC line that was placed by
Interventional Radiology.

The patient developed some diarrhea during her hospital stay
as well and was ruled out adequately for Clostridium
difficile toxin.

Once the patient was stable on pressure support settings,
Physical Therapy was consulted to improve the patient's motor
tone and strength.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with failure
to wean status post tracheostomy.
2.  Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.
3.  Severe anxiety.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Critical care poly-neuropathy and myopathy.
6.  Anemia of chronic disease.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Prednisone 15 mg q. day until [**2-15**].  Her dose is to
be tapered by 5 mg per week thereafter until she reaches
zero.
2.  Oxacillin 2 grams intravenously four times a day until
[**2-21**] (a complete two week course).
3.  Valium 5 mg twice a day.
4.  Heparin subcutaneously twice a day.
5.  Rhinocort two puffs twice a day.
6.  Colace 100 mg twice a day p.r.n. constipation.
7.  Pepcid, 20 mg twice a day.
8.  Albuterol inhaler and nebulizers p.r.n.
9.  Serevent 2 puffs twice a day.
10. Flovent 6 puffs twice a day.
11. Celexa 50 mg q. day.
12. Singulair 10 mg q. day.
13. Captopril 50 mg three times a day.
14. Iron sulfate 325 mg twice a day.
15. Ativan 1 mg q. three hours p.r.n.
16. Tylenol p.r.n.
17. Nitroglycerin paste p.r.n.
18. Metoprolol 12.5 mg twice a day.

DISCHARGE STATUS:   The patient was discharged in good
condition to a rehabilitation center.  There she is to regain
her strength in terms of motor function and respiratory
muscles.

She is to slowly be weaned off of her ventilator.
