Service:

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 82-year-old
gentleman with a past medical history of coronary artery
disease (status post myocardial infarction times three) who
presented as a transfer from [**Hospital 26200**] Hospital
secondary to respiratory distress requiring intubation and
sedation.

The patient was originally seen on [**1-1**] in the
Emergency Department for three days of shortness of breath
and a cough.  At that time he was sent home on treatment with
Bactrim double strength.

The patient presented again on [**1-5**] with increased
shortness of breath and was noted to have a blood pressure
elevated to 232/96, a heart rate of 113, and a regular rate
and rhythm of 36.  In addition, a chest x-ray revealed
questionable flash pulmonary edema.  The patient was then
intubated and sedated and transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further treatment.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease; status post myocardial
infarction times three.
2.  Cardiac arrest in the setting of pneumonia.
3.  Chronic renal insufficiency (with a baseline creatinine
of 1.6 to 2.1).
4.  Hypercholesterolemia.
5.  Questionable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

ALLERGIES:  Questionable allergy to LIPITOR (causing back
pain and "liver pain").

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  (Medications on admission
included)
1.  Isosorbide 60 mg by mouth once per day.
2.  Lopressor 75 mg by mouth twice per day.
3.  Vitamins.
4.  Aspirin.
5.  Bactrim double strength (since [**1-1**]).

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married with five children
and eleven grandchildren.  The patient quit tobacco 10 years
ago.  Occasional alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  General physical
examination on admission revealed the patient was intubated
and sedated.  Vital signs revealed his temperature was 100.8
degrees Fahrenheit, his heart rate was 90, his blood pressure
was 145/76, his respiratory rate was 21, on a ventilator AC
510/5 saturating 100%.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
examination revealed the pupils were equal, round, and
reactive to light.  The mucous membranes were dry.  Lungs
revealed rhonchi diffusely with decreased breath sounds at
the right base.  Heart was regular in rate and rhythm.  There
was distant heart sounds.  Barrel chested.  The abdomen was
soft and nontender.  There were positive bowel sounds.
Extremity examination revealed trace bilateral edema.  The
hands were warm.  The feet were cold.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories
on admission revealed the patient's white blood cell count
was 11.4, his hematocrit was 45, and his platelets were 300.
Differential revealed 35 neutrophils and 6 lymphocytes.
Chemistry-7 revealed the patient's sodium was 136, potassium
was 5.3, his blood urea nitrogen was 41, and his creatinine
was 2.8 (up from 1.7 on [**12-12**]).  His troponin was 0.8.
Creatine kinase was 414.  MB was 4.8.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram revealed a
normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 100 with peaked T waves in
V2 through V4.  There were Q waves in leads II, III, and aVF
which were old.

A chest x-ray revealed endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube
properly placed.  Perihilar haziness and patchy lower lobe
densities consistent with pulmonary edema/congestive heart
failure.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  (a)  Ischemia:  There was
initially some concern regarding possible electrocardiogram
changes with questionable ST elevations in V2 through V3.

Upon transfer, the patient was seen by Cardiology who felt
the shape of the T waves were not consistent with infarction
and were more consistent with left ventricular hypertrophy.
The patient had been on a heparin drip, but this was
discontinued shortly thereafter.  The patient's cardiac
enzymes were cycled, and they trended down.  The patient was
continued on aspirin.  A statin was started despite the
questionable history of an allergy.  His beta blocker and ACE
inhibitor were titrated up.  The patient was to have an
outpatient Cardiology followup regarding a possible
outpatient stress test or catheterization.

(b)  Pump:  The patient had an echocardiogram which revealed
an ejection fraction of 25% to 30% with global hypokinesis
and focal hypokinesis on the anterior free wall.  The patient
was diuresed with intravenous Lasix as needed.  The patient
was treated with hydralazine and nitroglycerin for afterload
reduction.  ACE inhibitor was held secondary to an increased
creatinine, and Lopressor was titrated up.

The patient was extubated on hospital day two.  Throughout
the remainder of his course he showed no signs or symptoms of
congestive heart failure, and no further Lasix was required.

2.  ACUTE-ON-CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE ISSUES:  This was felt to
be secondary to Bactrim with an acute interstitial nephritis
picture as there was positive eosinophils.  Bactrim was held.
The patient's creatinine peaked at 4 and trended down.  At
the time of discharge, his creatinine was 3.8.  The patient
was to follow up in a few days with his primary care
physician to have his creatinine checked once again to make
sure it was going in the right direction.

3.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient was intubated for presumed
flash pulmonary edema in the setting of likely viral
bronchitis presentation.  The patient was extubated on
hospital day two.  On this presentation on [**1-5**],
initially the patient was started on Levaquin for
questionable pneumonia; however, after extubation the patient
was saturating well.  A chest x-ray showed no evidence of
infiltrate.  Therefore, the antibiotic was discontinued as it
was felt that this was likely a viral bronchitis.  At the
time of discharge, the patient was oxygenating well at rest
as well as with ambulation.

4.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient had upper
respiratory infection symptoms and a temperature at home
prior to admission.  The patient was initially on Levaquin
for a question of bronchitis/pneumonia but was stopped on
[**1-6**].  The patient clinically did not appear infected.
Blood cultures, and urine cultures, and sputum cultures were
all no growth.  The patient remained afebrile throughout the
rest of his admission.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged to home in
good condition.  He was saturating well on room air at rest
and with ambulation.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient was instructed to weight himself every
morning and call his medical doctor if his weight increased
greater than three pounds.
2.  The patient was instructed to seek medical attention if
he experienced shortness of breath, fevers, chills, or other
concerning symptoms.
3.  The patient was instructed to follow up with his primary
care physician (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on the Friday after his discharge
to have his blood urea nitrogen and creatinine checked.
4.  The patient was instructed to follow up with his new
cardiologist (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3321**]) on [**1-24**] at 2:30
in [**Location (un) 620**].

FINAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Congestive heart failure.
2.  Acute renal failure; likely secondary to Bactrim.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once per day.
2.  Folic acid 1 mg by mouth once per day.
3.  Lopressor 75 mg by mouth twice per day.
4.  Isosorbide dinitrate 20 mg by mouth three times per day.

NOTE:
1.  The patient should be considered to have an allergy to
SULFA, as this was likely the cause of his acute renal
failure.
2.  The patient had been treated with pravastatin in the
hospital with no adverse effects; however, reports repeated
problems with statin medications in the past and was treated
with niacin.  His most recent cholesterol panel revealed his
low-density lipoprotein was 99 and a total cholesterol of
159.  Therefore, the patient elected to not continue on the
pravastatin as an outpatient and would discuss this with his
new cardiologist further lipid management.
