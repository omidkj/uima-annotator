Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
bloody diarrhea x 2 weeks

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
colonoscopy x 2 (+1 failed [**12-23**] poor prep)
Tagged RBC GI bleeding study

History of Present Illness:
83yo woman with h/o diverticulosis, C. Diff who presents with
bloody diarrhea for 2 weeks. States is constipated at baseline
(1 BM qod), and has a h/o hemorrhoids so she initially thought
her bloody diarrhea was hemorrhoidal bleeding. Her BM frequency
increased to 2-3BM's day from baseline. The color was darker
than normal for her. The diarrhea was unusually malordorous. She
came to [**Hospital1 18**] because she just wasn't getting better and was fed
up with wearing sanitary pads. Also worried because her sister
passed away from colon CA last year (age 81). Denies any
abdominal pain or N/V. No CP, no SOB. She has been tolerating
POs normally but notes a slightly decreased appetite and weight
loss of 5 pounds. Feels tired and weak but denies dizziness or
lightheadedness. No recent hospitalizations but was hospitalized
last year in [**Month (only) **] for pneumonia, developed C. Diff which
required 3 months of treatment.
.
In the ER she was found to have a hct of 38 (baseline), she had
guaiac positive melena on exam. She received 1L NS. GI was
called and recommended CT abdomen with contrast, which was
negative for colitis, showed patent arteries, and showed
diverticulosis without diverticulitis. They recommended
colonoscopy in AM, and she was begun on GoLytely prep. However,
the patient did not tolerate this and was changed to Mag
Citrate. She also received 1 unit of PRBCs.
.
On admission to the fllor she feels well but weak. BMs are still
dark, mixed with blood.

Past Medical History:

diverticulitis.

2. Mild-to-moderate atherosclerotic disease involving the
intra-abdominal aorta with patent celiac axis, SMA, and [**Female First Name (un) 899**].
Normal-appearing SMV. No evidence of colitis or pneumatosis.

3. Multiple small liver and splenic calcified granulomas.

GI BLEEDING STUDY  [**2192-5-24**]
IMPRESSION: Bleeding from the distal sigmoid/rectum.
.
ECHO [**5-24**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left ventricular cavity
size is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is a severe resting left
ventricular outflow tract obstruction (peak gradient >150 mmHg)
in the setting of hyperdynamic state. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is systolic anterior motion
of the mitral valve leaflets. Mild to moderate ([**11-22**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
83yo woman with h/o diverticulosis, C.Diff, presented with
bloody diarrhea x 2 weeks. Infectious causes ruled out (neg
CDiff, campy, salm, shig), and CT negative for mesenteric
ischemia. Colonoscopy [**5-21**] found a bleeding sigmoid diverticulum
that was injected with epinephrine with good hemostasis. In
setting of GIB anemia and demand ischemia, pt suffered mild
NSTEMI. Pt began to pass bloody stools again, necessitating RBC
transfusions to maintain HCT. Tagged RBC study showed rebleed in
sigmoid colon not amenable to angio. GI re-scoped on [**5-25**], which
showed normal colon with no bleeding. Pt.'s HCT remained stable
until disharge and did not have further bleeding.
.
# GIB: Presented with 2 weeks of bleeding at home. Infectious
etiologies ruled out. Mesenteric ischemia ruled out by CT.
Diverticular bleed found on first colonoscopy, epi injected, but
patient with continued LGIB which was seen in the distal sigmoid
on tagged RBC study [**5-24**]. The bleeding was not deemed amenable to
angio intervention. She continued to be supported with aggresive
pRBC trasfusions until her repeat colonoscopy on [**5-25**] which
showed a no source of bleeding. She did not have any further
bloody BMs and was hemodyamically stable as of [**2192-5-29**].
.
# CHEST PAIN: Patient has had negative CKs but small troponin
leak, ? 1mm ST depressions on EKG from [**5-21**]. Likely represents
mild NSTEMI from demand ischemia, as tends to recur only when
patient drops her hematocrit to the mid 20's. Cardiology
consulted, agree that this represents demand ischemia, recommend
agressive transfusion. Echo obtained showed LVOF obstruction in
setting of hyperdynamic state, mild-moderate MR, but no wall
motion abnormalities. ASA was initally given but held per GI
recommendations. Patient was put on metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 **] in the
setting of her NSTEMI. Pt. will follow up with cardiology as
outpatient [**2192-6-5**].
.
#SOB: after aggressive volume resuscitation and blood
transfusions, the patient began to experience SOB and tachypnea.
A CXR was c/w volume overload and CHF. She was treated with
Lasix 10mg x 2, which excellent diuretic effect and symptomatic
relief. Pt. was started on Lasix 20mg QD on discharge.
.
# HTN: We held her diuretic throughout her stay in the setting
of her GIB, and restarted B blocker during her admission
(metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 **]). Her home diltiazem was held.
.
# BRONCHIECTASIS: Continued on home meds of
