Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
AV Nodal ablation with pacemaker placement--[**7-13**]. [**2132**]


History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 83 yo M with ESRD on HD (MWF), h/o a fib and
PAT, baseline AV conduction delay, CAD, moderate MR, moderate AS
who p/w dyspnea. He developed acute shortness of breath after
lunch today and called the EMS. He denied any syncope, chest
pain, palpitations, nausea/vomiting, diaphoresis. He reports
worsening orthopnea and couple of episodes of PND in the past 2
nights. He has poor functional status due to excessive fatigue
more than SOB. His pedal edema is the same, and he denies any
weight gain. He urinates 500 cc per day. He has not missed any
dialysis days. He had half a hotdog and puts salt on his food
but no more than usual. He takes all his medications as
prescribed. He had a cough with clear sputum, no hemoptysis, in
last day. No fever, chills, sick contacts.
On arrival to the ED, VS were: T 97.4, P 117, BP 210/130, R40,
75% on RA. Pt was not able to speak in full sentences. He was
started on BiPap with improvement and transitioned to NRB with
O2 sats of 95-97. He was also started on nitro gtt with improved
BP to 120/80s. He also received 20 mg IV Lasix with ?response
(unable to pass catheter [**12-20**] BPH). EKG showed atrial
fibrillation, noted to be regular at rate of 120s with but no p
waves. No ischemic changes on EKG. His shortness of breath has
improved but he is unable to eat without desaturating.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any deep venous thrombosis,
pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery. He has back
pain but no other myalgias or joint pains. He has some nausea on
days off HD in the past week. No vomiting, abdominal pain, black
stools or red stools. All of the other review of systems were
negative.

ECG Study Date of [**2133-7-5**]  2:45:08 PM
Sinus tachycardia. Prolonged P-R interval. Left axis deviation.
Probable
left anterior fascicular block. Possible inferior myocardial
infarction,
age undetermined. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2133-6-9**] P
waves are
now visible, right bundle-branch block has resolved and the rate
has increased somewhat. Otherwise, no significant difference.
.
Portable TTE (Focused views) Done [**2133-7-6**] at 3:43:34 PM
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.] The inferolateral segments are
akinetic. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. The aortic valve is not well seen. There is moderate
aortic valve stenosis (area 1.0-1.2cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2133-6-5**],
overall LV systolic function is probably slightly worse. The
degrees of aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation are similar.

.
ECG Study Date of [**2133-7-14**]  2:33:46 PM
Atrial sensed and ventricular paced rhythm with left
bundle-branch block
pattern. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2133-7-13**] there is
now one hundred percent atrial sensing and ventricular pacing.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is an 83 yo M with ESRD on HD (MWF), h/o a fib and PAT,
baseline AV conduction delay, CAD, moderate MR, moderate AS who
presented with acute shortness of breath on [**7-5**] and found to be
in CHF.
.
# Pump/Acute Congestive heart failure: The patient appeared to
have acute on chronic congestive heart failure with EF of 35% on
last ECHO from [**5-26**].  Repeat ECHO this admission demonstrated a
EF of 25-30%.  He was clinically volume-overloaded on exam and
CXR on presentation was consistent with flash pulmonary edema.
It was felt that these symptoms were from his elevated blood
pressure and prolonged tachycardia. The patient's dyspnea
improved on an non-rebreather mask. Given his volume overloaded
status, the patient underwent urgent hemodialysis with marked
improvement on exam as well as his oxygen requirements.  The
patient was able to demonstrate good oxygen saturation at rest,
but during evaluations with physical therapy, the patient
consistantly desaturated to the low 80's with ambulation.  PT
