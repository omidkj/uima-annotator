History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 1007**] is a 48 year old female with a history of type II DM,
migraines and asthma who presents with inability to take POs.
Pt was in her usual state of health until about 1 week PTA, when
she developed malaise, myalgias, and nasal congestion.  In
addition to this she also developed a cough productive of
greenish sputum and mild SOB. Also with subjective fevers and
chills.  She has also had non-bloody, non bililous emesis since
the start of these symptoms. She was seen by her PCP 4 days PTA,
and she was thought to have sinusitis as well as an asthma
exacerbation, and was prescribed azithromycin x5 days and
prednisone x4 days.  She was unable to tolerate the prednisone
but did complete 3 days of azithromycin.  Her symptoms
continued, including continued N/V and inability to eat, so she
brought herself to the ED.  Of note, she did not take any of her
medications yesterday, including insulin and metformin.  She
reports frequent sick contacts as she works at [**Hospital1 **].
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 95.9, 122/60, 79, 19, 94% on RA. She
felt nauseated and had two episodes of vomiting.  She was was
found to have a FS of 270, given 6 units of reg insulin,
initially with no anion gap.  Next set of labs however, revealed
an anion gap of 17 with a glucose of 215.  Patient was hydrated
with 3L of NS and was given 10 units insulin.  She was also
started on an insulin gtt at 5 units/h.  She is being admitted
to the ICU for diabetic ketoacidosis.
.
On the floor she reports a bilateral constant headache that
started with the onset of the above symptoms.  Reports
photophobia similar to her usual migrainous headaches.  She
received toradol in the ED with some relief.
.
ROS: The patient denies abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation,
melena, hematochezia, chest pain, shortness of breath,
orthopnea, PND, lower extremity oedema, cough, urinary

Brief Hospital Course:
48 year old female with a history of type II DM, hyperlipidemia,
asthma who presented with an anion gap acidosis in the setting
of nausea, vomitting, viral URI symptoms.
.
# Anion gap acidosis: On presentation the patient had minimal
ketones on urinalysis, with elevated glucose.  This could
potentially be consistent with DKA though not perfectly
consistent.  The ICU team was also concerned about lactic
acidosis vs mild starvation ketoacidosis.  Lactate was normal
after presentation to the floor (but this was after anion gap
had resolved).  The patient was put on maintenance fluids
overnight and remained gap free the next AM.
.
# Nausea/vomitting: The patient presented with nausea and
vomiting most likely due to a viral illness vs. side effect of
taking azithromycin at home vs migraine headaches.  She had a
good response to anti-emetics and by her second hospital day was
tolerating PO's.  Her diet was advanced to regular.
.
# Type II DM: The patient had elevated blood sugars in the
setting of missed insulin dosing but she was initially
hypoglycemic on the floor in the setting of having been on
insulin drip in the ED.  Her insulin drip was stopped but she
continued to fall into the 60's.  At that point she was started
on  maintenance fluids with dextrose.  In the AM her glucose was
in the 400's (she remained without an anion gap).  She received
a [**1-23**] dose of her home glargine (10 units) and covering insulin
and decreased to the 300's at which point she received another
20 units of glargine (for a total of 30 units). Her lisinopril
and metformin were resumed and she was started on a baby ASA a
day.m On  day of discharge, pts Glargine was increased back to
home dose of 40 U daily as her FS were in the 100s-200s range.

# Asthma:  The patient has a history of reactive airway disease
in the context of viral infections.  She had been prescribed a
prednisone course at her PCP's office on [**2118-3-3**] but never
filled this and was denying any wheezing or shortness of breath
at her presentation to the hospital.  As she was also without
wheezes on auscultation of the chest and satting well on room,
no steroids were given.
.
# Migraine Headaches: Pt had several while here, treated
symptomatically. Her headaches were associated with nausea and
vomiting.
