CXR:
[**2165-6-4**]:  There is no change in the right apical pneumothorax.
Continued right effusion with minimal atelectatic changes at the
bases.
[**2165-6-3**]: there is minimal increase in right still
small pneumothorax. The lung is well aerated on the right and on
the left.  There is no change in basal atelectasis. There is no
appreciable increase in pleural effusion which is currently
present on the right, small. Surgical clips appear to be
unremarkable.
[**2165-6-2**]:  Following removal of one of two chest tubes, a small
right apical pneumothorax is again visualized but has slightly
decreased in size in the interval. Appearance of the chest is
otherwise without change since the recent study except for
decrease in degree of subcutaneous emphysema in the right
supraclavicular area.
[**2165-6-1**]: Small amount of right pneumothorax restricted to the
apex is unchanged. The position of two right chest tubes is
unchanged. There is small amount of pleural effusion. Lungs are
well aerated. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
[**2165-5-31**]: Two right chest tubes are in place. There is small
apical pneumothorax on the
right. Overall, the extension of the right lung is preserved. No
appreciable pleural effusion is seen. The left lung is well
aerated. Mediastinal contour is stable. Mild mediastinal shift
to the right is expected due to surgery.

node dissection and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage.
She was extubated in the operating room, and monitored in the
PACU. While in the PACU she was hypotensive which responded to a
fluid challenge and decrease titration of Bupivacaine Epidural
and phenylphrene. Once stable she transfer to the floor
hemodynamically stable.

Respiratory: Pulmonary toilet with incentive spirometery was
encouraged throughout her stay. She was titrated off oxygen with
ambulatory saturations of 93% on room air.

Chest tubes: 2 [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drains anteriorly and posteriorly over the
apex were removed once pleural drainage decreased on [**2165-6-2**] and
[**2165-6-3**] with stable postpull film revealing right apical
pneumothorax, which is unchanged on followup CXR's.

Cardiac: The patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation
[**2165-6-2**] which converted to Sinus rhythm with 10 mg IV
Lopressor.  Her home dose Lopressor was continued and she
remained in sinus rhythm 60-70's with blood pressures 110-120
systolic.

GI: PPI and bowel regime continued. The patient was passing gas
on discharge but due for BM. Diet was advanced and tolerated.

output.  Electrolytes were replete as needed.

intitial pain management with good effect. [**2165-6-3**] PCA was dc'd
with po vicodin ordered and managed by the acute pain service.
