Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2597**]
Chief Complaint:
Nonhealing ulcer of the left foot.
Ischemic rest pain of the right foot.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**7-29**] Aortobifemoral bypass with 14 x 7 Dacron graft and
thrombectomy of right fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] graft
[**8-3**]  Exploratory laparotomy, left colectomy with proctectomy and
takedown splenic flexure.


History of Present Illness:
This 63-year-old gentleman with severe
peripheral vascular disease has rest pain of his right foot
and a nonhealing ulcer on the left. He has previously had a
left-to-right fem-fem bypass with a right femoral-popliteal
bypass with saphenous vein many years ago at another
institution. This graft was found to be failing and he has
undergone a combination of iliac angioplasty and stenting on
the left to improve inflow plus surgical revision of the fem-
fem bypass. He continues to have poor flow to his extremities
and we decided to convert his inflow to an aortobifemoral
graft.

FINDINGS:
Compared to the prior study, there is increased prominence of
the left lower lobe density which has a more patchy appearance
and is concerning for evolving consolidation. This would be
consistent with pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
The remainder of the lungs is unchanged. Mild increased
distension of the pulmonary vasculature suggests slight
worsening of fluid status.
IMPRESSION: Evolving left lower lobe consolidation, consistent
with pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. Slightly
worsened fluid status. DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4347**]

Final Report
PICC LINE PLACEMENT
 TECHNIQUE: Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the
left basilic
vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a
micropuncture set. Hard copies of ultrasound images were
obtained before and immediately after establishing intravenous
access. A peel-away sheath was then placed over a guide wire and
a double lumen [**Last Name (un) **] PICC line measuring 45 cm in length was
then placed through the peel-away sheath with its tip positioned
in the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance. Position of the catheter
was confirmed by a fluoroscopic spot film of the chest.
The peel-away sheath and guide wire were then removed. The
catheter was
secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile dressing applied.
The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no
immediate
complications.

IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided
double lumen [**Last Name (un) **] PICC line placement via the left basilic
venous approach. Final internal length is 45 cm, with the tip
positioned in SVC. The line is ready to use. The study and the
report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
