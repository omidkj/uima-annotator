Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on [**2141-6-5**] and underwent an aortic
valve replacement with a 21 mm tissue valve.  She tolerated the
procedure well and was transferred to the CSRU on levophed,
propofol, and isoprel.  She had a four beat run of non-sustained
VT in her postop night and was extubated the following morning.
She remained on milrinone and levophed and was transfused 1 unit
of PRBC.  She was in Wenkebach and was seen by EP.  They
recommended holding beta blockers and followed.  She continued
on milrinone and had her chest tubes d/c'd on POD#4.  On POD#6
her wires were d/c'd and she was off pressors.  EP continued to
follow her and she developed tachycardia in addition to her 2nd
degree heart block. Whenever she was given beta blockers she
would block down.  On [**2141-6-13**] she had a DDD pacer placed and
tolerated the procedure well.
She was transferred to the floor on POD#9 and was restarted on
beta blockers without problems.  She continued to improve and
was discharged to rehab on POD#10 in stable condition.
