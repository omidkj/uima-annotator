History of Present Illness:
58 year old male nursing home resident, MMP incl in brittle DM
[**1-25**] pancreatic insufficiency, ESRD on HD, others, BIBA from
[**Location (un) **] NH with chief complaint of low BS a/w increased
somnolence, diaphoresis, shaking, and confusion. Patient is a
resident at [**Hospital **] Nursing Home. Per report, yesterday pt had
FSBS = 41 yesterday, given dextrose and food with stabilization
of BS. This morning the patient was found to be diaphoretic and
not speaking, and glucometer at 910am read "low" - he was given
juice with increase in his BS to 61. He was given glucagon 1mg
IM x 1, and EMS called. On arrival to ED FSBS was 64. The
patient's repeat FSBS was 29. IV access was difficult, and a L
femoral line was placed. He was given 1 amp D50, and his sugars
increased to 89. 1.5 hours later, his BS was 19, he was given
1amp D50 and started on D10 drip. Prior to transfer to the MICU,
his FSBS was 86.
.
Pt states his dose of insulin (? lantus) was recently increased
during the 1 week prior to admission, but he is a difficult
historian and unclear on the details. He does not know which MD
is in charge of his diabetes. He states he has had diminished po
intake this week because he does not like the food at the NH. He
did not eat breakfast this AM, but reportedly was given his
lantus.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was initially admitted to the MICU for further
management of his hypoglycemia. His hospital course, by problem,
is as follows.
.
1) Hypoglycemia - Attributed to recent increase in Lantus dose
(6U qAM -> 15UqAM) with poor renal function (decreased
clearance) and compromised liver gluconeogenesis. He was placed
on a D10 drip, and his lantus dose was initially held, then
decreased to 7U. He was weaned off the D10 drip, but had
reccurent symptomatic hypoglycemia to FSBS 34. [**Last Name (un) **] consult
was obtained, and the patient was then put on 4 U lantus with a
sliding scale. He persistently had relatively low blood glucose
levels each morning, and therefore, his nighttime sliding scale
was made less aggressive. His FSBS were fairly stable on
transfer to the floor. On transfer to the floor he had normal to
high blood sugars without any evidence of hypoglycemia
overnight, but than had one episode of hypoglycemia to 39 in the
setting of not eating after getting prandial humulog coverage.
he was counciled to not allow administration of any kind of
insulin unless he had food available and he was planning on
eating a meal. All changes in insulin dosing should be made with
extreme caution. Do not cover with humulog at dinner until FS
>150 and no not cover with humulog at bedtime until FS >200.
.
2) End Stage Renal Disease - Stable throughout his admission. He
was dialyzed by the renal service as per his outpatient schedule
(Tues, Thurs, Sat).
.
3) Pancreatic insufficieny/chronic diarrhea - The patient
continued with his chronic diarrhea. He should take pancrease w/
meals due to ongoing malabsorption.
.
4)Rectal prolapse - The patient had 2 episodes of rectal
prolapse while in the MICU. One episode required manunal
reduction (stage III), the other spontaneously reduced (Stage
II). A curbside surgery consult was obtained, and they
recomended that the patient be referred for outpatient surgical
management unless his prolapsed rectum becomes irreducible.
.
5) Hypothermia - the patient was hypothermic on presentation to
the ED, with a rectal temperature too low to be recorded by the
rectal thermometer (<96 degrees). TSh/fT4 were checked which
were normal. He showed no evidence of sepsis. This was therfore
attributed to his hypoglycemia. He was normothermic for the rest
of his hospital stay.

He has a right arm AV graft for Dialysis and should have
dialysis on Tues/Thurs/Sat.
