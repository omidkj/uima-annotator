[**2185-5-10**] CXR
1. Tiny right apical pneumothorax with chest tube in place.
2. Worsening right pleural effusion and increasing atelectasis
in the right middle and both lower lobes.
3. Slight increase in cardiac silhouette, possibly related to
technique, but developing pericardial effusion is not excluded.

[**2185-5-9**] EKG
Sinus rhythm
Lead V1 absent
Otherwise normal ECG
Since previous tracing of [**2185-5-4**], no significant change

[**2185-5-9**] ECHO
PRE-BYPASS: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in
the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of
the right atrium/right atrial appendage. A patent foramen ovale
is present. A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum
is seen at rest by color flow doppler. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta are normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.
POST-BYPASS:
Intact interatrial septum by color flow doppler or valsalva
release. Preserved biventricular systolic function. Overall LVEF
60%. Ascending aorta looks normal.

[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4125**]ospital Course:
Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 65579**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2185-5-9**] for surgical
management of his atrial septal defect (ASD). He was taken
directly to the operating room where he underwent a minimally
invasive ASD closure by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]. Please see operative
note for detail. Postoperatively he was taken to the cardiac
surgical intensive care unit for monitoring. He awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. His chest tube was
removed with a very small residual pneumothorax. He was slow to
wean from pressors however was successfully of neosynephrine by
postoperative day 2. Later on postoperative day two, he was
transferred to the cardiac surgical step down unit for further
recovery. He was gently diuresed towards his preoperative
weight. The physical therapy service was consulted for
assistance with his postoperative strength and mobility. Beta
blockade was started and titrated for optimal heart rate and
blood pressure control. Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 65579**] continued to make steady
progress and was discharged home on postoperative day three. He
will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], his cardiologist and his
primary care physician as an outpatient. On discharge, his blood
pressure was 104/57 and he was in a normal sinus rhythm. His
wound was clean, dry and intact without drainage.
