CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath and right sided
weakness.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 48 year old
male with a history of hepatitis B, Child's A cirrhosis and
hepatocellular carcinoma who had been followed and treated by
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in [**Hospital **] Clinic.  He presented with right arm
and right leg weakness, dyspnea, hemoptysis and several hours
of pleuritic chest pain.  In route to the Emergency
Department, he had witnessed tonoclonic seizures and was
stabilized at [**Hospital3 **] and transferred to [**Hospital1 346**].  The patient was loaded on Dilantin
in the Emergency Department and transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.  There he was found to have a pulmonary
embolus and some hemorrhage around new brain metastases.  An
IVC filter was placed to protect against new pulmonary emboli
but no deep vein thromboses were found in the lower
extremities.  The patient also received Decadron for brain
metastases and was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] for
radiation treatment.  Currently, the patient felt that his
shortness of breath and chest pain are improving.  The
weakness on his right side is subjectively worse.  Otherwise,
the patient had been diagnosed with hepatitis and liver
cancer in [**2139**], after routine screening.  He has no ethanol
history.  He has a mother with hepatitis B.

On review of systems, the patient has no hemoptysis or bright
red blood per rectum.  No nausea or vomiting.  He does
complain of sleep disturbance and confusion over the past
week prior to admission.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hepatitis B and Child's A cirrhosis.
2.  Portal hypertension.
3.  Hepatocellular carcinoma with known lung metastases.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Celebrex 200 mg p.o. once daily.
2.  Cholestyramine once daily.
3.  Epivir 100 mg p.o. once daily.
4.  Propranolol 20 mg p.o. twice a day.

ALLERGIES:  Tylenol and Aspirin which both lead to a rash.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's mother has hepatitis B as well
as his maternal uncle who also died of liver cancer.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married and lives in [**Hospital1 392**]
with his family.  He denies any alcohol use.  He moved to the
United States in the [**2117**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, in general, the patient
is well appearing pleasant male in no apparent distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination - positive
scleral icterus, moist mucous membranes.  Extraocular
movements are intact. Cardiac - regular rate and rhythm, no
murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Pulmonary - Bilaterally clear to
auscultation, decreased breath sounds at the bases.  The
abdomen revealed positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender,
nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly, no ascites, a scar in
the abdomen from previous liver surgery.  Extremities - no
cyanosis, clubbing or edema, good pulses.  Neurologically,
cranial nerves III through XII are intact.  Mild asterixis.
Right are the weakest muscles on the patient's neurologic
examination which are 3 and otherwise his triceps are 4-,
biceps 4+, and the remainder of the examination is [**4-10**] except
for the right quadriceps muscles which are also [**3-11**].

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count 9.4,
hemoglobin 13.5, hematocrit 37.1 down from 41.7 and platelet
count 83,000.  Prothrombin time was 14.2, INR 1.3.  Chem7
showed sodium 138, potassium 3.9, chloride 105, bicarbonate
23, blood urea nitrogen 12, creatinine 0.9, and glucose 189.

Magnetic resonance scan of the head showed left parietal
occipital hemorrhagic metastatic lesions and a left
frontoparietal enhancing metastatic focus with mild blood
products and surrounding edema in the left frontotemporal
region.  There was mild mass effect in the left lateral
ventricle without midline shift.  There were no other
metastatic foci seen.  CTA of the chest had also been
performed on admission which showed multiple segmental and
subsegmental left sided pulmonary emboli.  There were nodular
lung parenchymal and mediastinal masses consistent with the
patient's known metastatic disease.  There was occlusion of
the left lower lobe bronchus with associated atelectasis and
superimposed infectious process could not be excluded.

Given the above, the patient was managed on the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**].
He was seen by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and by the radiation oncology
service for treatment of his brain metastases.  During his
stay, hematology/oncology wise, for his pulmonary emboli, the
patient was managed supportively.  He remained approximately
99% oxygen saturation in room air. He was not anticoagulated
given his propensity for coagulopathy with his liver disease.
Otherwise in terms of his brain metastases, the patient
received radiation treatment daily during his stay.  He was
also seen by physical therapy and occupational therapy to
improve his function given his right sided deficits.  In
terms of his gastrointestinal issues, the patient had mild
encephalopathy and was treated with Lactulose which was
titrated to approximately three bowel movements per day.  For
question of esophageal varices, the patient was treated with
Propranolol.  He was continued on Protonix.  He was also
given a low protein diet to minimize any further exacerbation
of his encephalopathy.  He was also given Vitamin K to
improve his coagulopathy and he was discharged on [**2141-2-26**],
in stable condition.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Hepatitis B cirrhosis.
2.  Hepatocellular carcinoma.
3.  Pulmonary emboli.
4.  Metastatic hemorrhagic brain lesions.

He was instructed to follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in one to two
weeks.  He was also instructed to follow-up for radiation
treatment on Monday, [**2141-2-27**], at 11:00 a.m. in the [**Hospital Ward Name 12573**]
basement of [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] where further appointments would be
set.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Epivir 100 mg p.o. once daily.
2.  Vitamin K 5 mg p.o. once daily.
3.  Dilantin 100 mg p.o. three times a day.
4.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. once daily.
5.  Ambien 5 mg p.o. q.h.s.
6.  Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day.
7.  Thorazine 25 mg p.o. three times a day.
8.  Lactulose 30 ml p.o. three times a day.
9.  Decadron 6 mg p.o. q6hours.
10. Propranolol 20 mg p.o. twice a day.
