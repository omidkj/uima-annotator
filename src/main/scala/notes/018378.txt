History of Present Illness:
HPI: 81 year old male, CP, A fib hx,L DVT in femoral vein,
started to develop GIB, , s/p IVC filter RA on MTX and
prednisone, recently admitted for worsening hip pain and
inability to walk, and recent CT of abd/hip that revealed
diverticular abscess [**3-4**] to perforated diverticulum and s/p
drainage and drain removed on [**9-28**]. CT scan noted abscess well
drained. He was d/c back to rehab Vanc/Levo/Flagyl. levaquin 500
qd x 3, ticarcillin 3.1 gm IV
He is was noted to have spiking over past 24-48 hrs
(101.8-103.8) with highest 103. 8 at 10pm on [**9-28**]. CXR -> LLL
infiltrate . He was examed by HO at 9pm on [**9-28**] He did not have
any complaints to HO at rehab. He denies any abd pain, SOB or
SOB, no diarrhea. No cough or sputum. He was given vanco X 1. On
exam, CV: tachy, abd: no pain on deep palp, no rebound, Resp:
scattered rales, Ext: + pain w/ flexor of L hip
He c/o [**9-9**] CP this AM at 9am. He was given asa, sub lingual
nitro, BP 100/60, P 132-> 5 mins post 162/88 P 192 A fib and 2nd
sublingual nitro given-> 10 mins post, BP 172/88 P 192, 2nd
nitro sl given-> 9am 5 mg lopressor, HR down to 130s.CP
disspiated at 945am. BP normalized in 100/60 at 10am. He was
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**]  where sepsis protocal was initiated in the ED
after CT abd showed marked increase in the size of the LLQ
abscess associated with ileopsoas muscle and extending into the
thigh. Bilateral residual pulmonary emboli were also noted

Pt had fevers/sepsis on admission which was from diverticular
abscess but also concern for about PICC line infection.  PICC
line was d/c on [**9-29**] - no growth from tip.  Blood culture from
[**9-29**] grew [**Female First Name (un) **] parapsilosis ([**2-3**]). Blood cultures are
negative to date subsequent. A drain was placed by IR on [**10-1**] by
CT guidance.  Colorectal surgery has been following.  Abscess
culture from [**10-1**] grew entrococcus (vanc/amp/levo/pcn resistant)
and yeast (likely c. albicans). Pt covered linezolid (hx VRE),
meropenem (for GNR and anaerobes) and caspofungin (fungemia) .
Infectious disease team has been following.  Right IJ line was
d/c and tip showed no growth. Pt has been afebrile for past 48
hours.  His WBC count has improved from 14K to 6k since
admission.
Pt blood pressure runs in SBP 90-100.  HR is controlled with QID
metoprolol.  Today the MICU team is attempting gentle diuresis
for volume overload

Past Medical History:
1) Perforated diverticulum with pelvic abscess
[**Hospital1 18**] admission, his CT pelvis which revealed a large left
pelvic abscess (7.3 x 11.1 x 14.4 cm), felt likely secondary to
perforated diverticulum. He underwent CT-guided drainage of his
abscess on [**9-3**] in IR, and was started on emipiric abx with
Levo/Flagyl. Vanco added following an episode of hypotension
responsive to IVF, D/C'd [**9-7**]. He was also started on Heparin
on [**9-3**] with initial bolus for PE, and Coumadin started on
[**9-4**].
On [**2178-9-7**], Mr. [**Known lastname 50388**] had an episode of BRBPR, initially with
BM described as 3 "coinsized clots", then 2 further episodes
with clots without stools. Hct drop 34 last night-->27 this AM,
transfused an additional unit of PRBCs. Hemodynamically stable
overnight, but this AM BP drop to 84/60, with spontaneous
recovery. PTT intermittently supratherapeutic (101, 108, 143) in
past days, INR 2.5 this AM. Still on heparin, last Coumadin on
[**9-6**]. Last C-scope in [**2172**] with diverticulosis. Only prior
history of occasional blood on toilet paper after straining.

2) CAD since [**2138**], s/p IMI in [**2145**]. Stress thallium in [**2163**] with
redistributing posterolateral and inferior defect.
3) Hypertension
4) Hyperlipidemia
5) Rheumatoid arthritis, recently diagnosed, on Prednisone 5 mg
PO BID and Methotrexate 10 mg Qwk
6) Diverticulosis, last colonoscopy in [**2172**]
7)VRE but unclear sources
8)RLL PE ([**2178-9-28**]), bilat DVT
9) GI bleed on last admission, coumadin and hep held -> filter
placed by IR  s/p IVC filter (removable)
