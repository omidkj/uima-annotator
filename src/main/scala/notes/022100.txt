Allergies:
Norvasc

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7055**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Non-invastive positive pressure ventilation.


History of Present Illness:
58 yo female w/ hx of CAD status post LAD and RCA stents, LHCath
w/ multivessel disease, CHF, HTN, Hyperlipidemia, PVD (s/p
fem-fem bypass on L, R iliac stent, iliac stenosis prox to popl
artery), end-stage renal disease, status post allograft
transplant [**2197**] complicated by graft rejection treated with ATG,
scleroderma, and GI bleed who presented to the ED progressively
worsening SOB.
.
Over the past 2 weeks, she has had progressively worsening DOE
and intermittent chest tightness.  She repots that this has
progressively gotten worse since she began to take the new
medications since d/c from hospital (see below).  She can only
walk ~ 5ft w/o DOE and does not recall how far she could walk
prior to this exacerbation.  She has no CP or SOB at rest.
There have been URI sx, she has had nonproductive cough. She
denies dietary indiscretions.  Did not notice weight gain.
.
She had a recent hospitalization ([**10-11**] - [**10-13**]) at which time
cardiac cath showed proximal LAD had 40% in-stent restenosis
with patent proximal RCA stent though there were serial 60% to
80% stenosis throughout the mid to distal LAD, the circumflex
had proximal 40% stenosis, and the distal left circumflex was
occluded with collateralization.  There were also 40% stenoses
in the mid and distal RCA.  She was deemed to have two-vessel
coronary artery disease that was not intervenable by angiography
and would not be a good CABG candidate.  Her blood pressure was
very high during her hospitalization and peri-procedure, thus it
was felt that the most useful thing to do would be to
aggressively control her blood pressure and improve the flow to
her transplanted kidney.
.
During this hospitalization, her lisinopril was increased to 30
mg and Imdur was added though not continued as an outpatient her
PCP notes in [**Name9 (PRE) **].
.
Per OMR, PCP was called by VNA on [**10-21**] for hypertension
(180/80); at this point, she had started the increased
lisinopril and imdur and was started on Norvasc 2.5mg QD (which
she did not take).
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, but endorses hx of DVT (timing unclear and unsure if its
venous or arterial), no pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time
of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors.  She reports leg pain w/ ambulation.  All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for chest pain, dyspnea on
exertion.  She denies paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were  98.1F, 191/90, 68, 92% on RA.
She c/o of CP, had rales b/l.  She was given SL nitro, lasix
60mg IV, started on NTG gtt, given ASA 325mg and was placed on
BiPAP 10/5.  She also received CaGluconate, 10U of insulin and
D50 amp for K of 6.8.
.
In the ICU,  vitals were 98F, 175/53, 97, 20 100% 50%O2 on Bipap
[**3-30**]. pt. was resting comfortably.  Denied CP, SOB or any
discomfort.

EKG [**2201-10-26**]:  NSR, No peaked Tw or Twi.  Anteroseptal ST elev <

CXR [**2201-10-26**]: These findings favor cardiogenic edema with
slightly more
confluent collection in the right mid lung zone. Conversely this
particular area may represent a focus of infection and repeat
radiography following appropriate diuresis recommended.

CXR [**2201-10-27**]: Resolution of cardiogenic edema. Stable-appearing
right upper
lobe nodule, consistent with old granulomatous disease

Renal U/S [**2201-10-28**]: No significant abnormality or change in
appearance of the transplanted kidney which has patent
vasculature.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. DYSPNEA
The patient was admitted with signs and symptoms of left sided
heart failure, likely from poor hypertension control and flash
pulmonary edema.  Her chest x-ray was consistent with pulmonary
edema.  She initially required bipap but was given 40mg IV Lasix
in the ED and 40mg IV Lasix on admission and responded.  She was
placed on a nitroglycerin drip on admission and this was able to
be titrated down and stopped on [**2201-10-27**].  Her oxygen was able to
be weaned to minimal settings after diuresis.  She was then put
on her home dose of Lasix 20mg PO qday.  She was ordered for
Amlodipine 5mg PO qday but refused to take this due to a history
of leg swelling as a side effect.  Her Lisinopril was restarted
but stopped on [**2201-10-27**] due to rising creatinine.  On discha
