Chief Complaint:
hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

broncholith resection and biopsy
lymph node biopsy


History of Present Illness:
24 year old F with no significant past pulmonary history who was
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2117-2-24**] with increasing hemoptysis. She was
recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with fevers, neck stiffness, chest
pain, and headache. She underwent an extensive work-and treated
empirically for CAP. She was thought to have had a viral
infection.

.

Since she has left the hospital, she has continued to have
fever, night sweats, and has had 8lbs weight loss.  She has also
in the last week developed hemopysis.  She first noted one
episode one week ago.  She had recurrent episodes three days,
every night this week.  Episodes occurred at night so she was
unable to quanititate the amount of blood loss, until the day of
admission when she had two episodes of approximately [**11-25**] cup of
bright red blood.  Patient reports today that the volume of
blood did not change over the course of the week, and was more
concerned about the increasing frequency of symptoms.  However,
per [**Company 191**] note on [**2-23**] patient as reporting one tablespoon of
hemoptysis prior to recent outpatient visit.  Patient denies any
chest pain, shortness of breath. She denies , nausea, vomiting,
hematemesis, or blood in stools.

.

Of note, patient's recent evaluation for fevers, chest pain,
headache and neck stiffness eventually attributed for viral
syndrome included the following workup. She underwent extensive
workup including rule out for ACS, CHF, PE, and pericardial
effusion.  She also had an extensive infectious workup with head
and neck imaging, EGD, fiberoptic endoscopy, LP which were
overall unrevealing.  CT chest showed evidence calcified lymph
nodes near the airways suggestive of prior histoplasmosis.
Patient as treated for CAP with ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
She was followed by the ID team.

.

In the ED, initial VS were stable.  She was initially admitted
to the medical floor.  She was evaluated by pulmonology, however
given increasing volume of hemoptysis, patient was transferred
to the MICU for monitoring.

.

On arrival to the MICU, patient appeared well, complained of a
headache and mild nausea without emesis.  Bedside basin with
three to four quarter sized block clots from hemoptysis.  She
was shortly after taken away for CT Chest.

.

CXR [**2117-2-24**]: IMPRESSION: Findings suggestive of right lower lobe
pneumonia.

CT TORSO [**2117-2-25**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Increase in size of partly calcified subcarinal lymph node,
new partly
Preliminary Reportcalcified right hilar lymph node and right
infrahilar lymph node.
3. New consolidation involving the anterior basal segment of the
right lower Preliminary Reportlobe.
4. Multiple peribronchial opacities and multiple tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**]
opacities
Preliminary Reportthroughout the right lobe which is a
nonspecific finding which has a wide differential including
infection.
5. Multiple areas of ground-glass opacity diffusely throughout
the right
lung.
6. Interval decrease in size of right pleural effusion.

RIGID BRONCH [**2117-2-26**]:
24 yo female with likely fibrosing mediastinitis and submassive
hemoptysis underwent Rigid bronchoscopy, flexible bronchoscopy,
showing Splayed main and right main carinas. At the distal [**Hospital1 **],
there was a rounded area of mucosal extrinsic compression that
bled easily to light bronchoscopic contact. Evaluation of all
airways to subsegmental level and with application of suction
did not show evidence of parenchymal origin of hemoptysis. There
was no evidence of a broncholith and no endobronchial lesions or
thrombus. EBUS showed a large calcified station 7 node, not
sampled. Station 11R enlarged lymph node underwent EBUS TBNA
with minimal bleeding. Argon plasma coagulation to the mucosa at
the [**Hospital1 **] that was bleeding was used to control bleeding with
complete hemostasis.

MRI HEAD: Normal brain MRI. No evidence of infection or mass.

FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING
The following tests (antibodies) were performed:  HLA-DR, FMC-7,
Kappa, Lambda, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 16, 19, 20, 23, 45 and 56.
RESULTS:
Three color gating is performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to
optimize lymphocyte yield. T cells comprise 90% of lymphoid
gated events.
INTERPRETATION
Non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic
immunophenotypic features of involvement by leukemia/lymphoma
are not seen in specimen. Correlation with clinical findings and
morphology (see S12-16115N) is recommended. Flow cytometry
immunophenotyping may not detect all lymphomas due to
topography, sampling or artifacts of sample preparation.

RIGHT BRONCH INTERMEDIUS BX:
Right bronchus intermedius endobronchial lesion, biopsy:
- Bronchial mucosa with ulceration and squamous metaplasia of
the respiratory epithelium; see note.

EBUS-TBNA, Lymph node 11R:
  NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
  Polymorphous lymphocytes, consistent with lymph node
  sampling.
  Bronchial cells.
