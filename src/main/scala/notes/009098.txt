Admission Date:  [**2139-12-13**]       Discharge Date:  [**2140-1-21**]

Date of Birth:   [**2119-11-6**]       Sex:  M

Service: Neurosurgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 20-year-old
gentleman who fell five feet off a porch with loss of
consciousness and unresponsiveness.  The patient had been on
a week-long binge of heroin and ethanol.

The patient presented to an outside hospital unresponsive to
pain with stimulation and was intubated and paralyzed.  A
head computed tomography showed a basilar skull fracture and
a subarachnoid hemorrhage.  The patient was transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**] for further management.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   On admission, the
patient's temperature was 99.6 degrees Fahrenheit and his
blood pressure was 145/palp.  He was intubated and sedated
but was moving all four extremities spontaneously.  He was
opening his eyes.  His pupils were 2 mm down to 1 mm.  His
lungs were clear to auscultation.  He was bradycardic with a
regular rhythm.  His abdomen was soft. The pelvis was stable.
Extremities with multiple tattoos.  No abrasions.  Spine with
no stepoff.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories
on admission revealed the patient's white blood cell count
was 33.6, his hematocrit was 41.9, and his platelets were
377.  The patient's Chemistry-7 revealed sodium was 142,
potassium was 3.7, chloride was 103, bicarbonate was 21,
blood urea nitrogen was 11, creatinine was 0.1, and his blood
glucose was 136.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray showed no
pneumothorax.

A head computed tomography revealed a subarachnoid hemorrhage
and left frontotemporal contusion, and intraparenchymal
hemorrhage, and multiple basal skull fractures.

A computed tomography of the spine was negative.

A computed tomography angiogram of the head and neck revealed
no evidence of neurovascular injury.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted
to the Trauma Surgical Intensive Care Unit for close
neurologic and vital sign observation.

The patient had blossoming of contusions on repeat computed
tomography scan 24 hours after his admission.  The patient
continued to move his extremities spontaneously and
purposefully.  His pupils were 6 mm down to 3 mm and
symmetric.  He was opening his eyes spontaneously.

On [**12-13**], the patient's condition deteriorated.  He
became less responsive.  A head computed tomography showed
further blossoming of contusions, and a ventricular drain was
placed on [**2139-12-14**].

On [**12-15**], the patient's intracranial pressure continued
to climb and his hydrocephalus was worse despite ventricular
drain placement.  The patient was taken to the operating room
for evacuation of the subdural hematoma, the left
frontotemporal hematoma, and craniectomy.

Postoperatively, he lifted his lower extremities off the bed
to sternal rub with the left upper extremity.  No movement of
the right upper extremity.  Withdrew the lower extremity.
The right upper extremity was flaccid and areflexive.  The
pupils were equal and reactive.  The brain flap was very
tight.

On [**2139-12-17**], the patient was intubated, off propofol,
slightly sedated, withdrew his left upper extremity and lower
extremities to painful stimulation localized on the left.
There was still no movement of the right upper extremity.
The pupils were equal and reactive to light.  He had a
diagnostic angio to rule out vascular malformation which was
ruled out.  Postoperatively, the patient's condition was
stable.

On [**12-19**], the patient was still intubated and was moving
the left side spontaneously.  His eyes were slightly open.
The pupils were 4 mm down to 3 mm.  The gaze was not
conjugant.  The brain flap was tense.  We continued to be
monitored with a ventricular drain in place leveled at 10 cm
above the tragus.  The patient continued to be worked up for
fevers.  Currently on oxacillin for ventricular drain
coverage.  The patient was on no other antibiotics at this
point.  Levofloxacin was added for gram-negative blood
cultures that were positive from [**12-18**] and gram-negative
rods in his sputum.  The cerebrospinal fluid remained
negative (culture wise).

On [**2139-12-22**], the patient had tracheotomy and
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube performed without
complications.  Postoperatively, his vital signs were stable.
He continued to spike a temperature to 102.3 degrees
Fahrenheit.  He had Enterobacter grow out from his blood
cultures from [**12-18**] and Staphylococcus aureus from his
sputum from [**12-18**].  The cerebrospinal fluid continued to
remain stable and without infection on the tracheostomy mask.

On [**2139-12-24**] off the ventilator, his vital signs
remained stable.  He continued to be awake.  He was moving
the left side spontaneously.  The right side with a right
facial droop and was moving right upper extremity slightly.
He was following commands on the left side, localizing in the
right upper extremity.  He continued to improve
neurologically.  Santalol was discontinued on [**2139-12-25**].

On [**12-29**], the ventricular drain was raised to 18 cm
above the tragus.  The patient tolerated this well.  He
remained neurologically awake and alert.  He was following
commands in all extremities.  The patient was opening his
eyes.

On [**1-1**], the patient spiked a temperature to 102.1
degrees Fahrenheit and was fully cultured.  The patient had
2+ gram-positive cocci in his sputum.  Urine cultures were
pending.  Blood cultures were pending.  The patient was
started on vancomycin for gram-positive cocci in his sputum,
and oxacillin was discontinued.  The patient was awake and
alert.  He was following commands and was moving all
extremities spontaneously and purposefully.  The brain flap
was soft but prominent.  The patient's ventricular drain was
clamped at this point (on [**2140-1-3**]).  On [**1-4**], the patient pulled out his ventricular drain. It was
replaced without complications.

The patient was taken to the operating room on [**2140-1-9**] for cranioplasty and replacement of bone flap.  The
patient tolerated the procedure well.  Postoperatively, the
patient remained neurologically stable status post
cranioplasty and status post bone flap replacement.  He
tolerated that without any changes in his neurologic status,
and his ventricular drain was eventually clamped and
discontinued.  The ventricular drain was discontinued on
[**2140-1-13**] along with the [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain that was
in place.  The patient was seen by the [**Hospital 878**]
Rehabilitation Service and was followed by the Physical
Therapy Service and Occupational Therapy Service.

He was transferred to the regular floor on [**2140-1-14**].
He has remained neurologically stable to date.  He was
alert, awake, and oriented times three.  He was moving all
extremities.  He was walking with some assistance.  His vital
signs have been stable.  He has been afebrile.  His
gastrojejunostomy tube had been removed.  His Foley catheter
was out.  He was voiding spontaneously.  He was tolerating a
regular diet and walking with some assistance.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient was to be discharged to
the [**Hospital **] Hospital with followup with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 1132**] in
one month.  The patient's staples should be removed on
postoperative day fourteen from his cranioplasty surgery
incision (which was on [**2140-1-9**]).
