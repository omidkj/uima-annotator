History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname 84837**] [**Known lastname **] is a 69-year-old woman with metastatic melanoma
with known brain metastases, s/p whole brain radiation completed
on [**2170-10-12**] who presents with 3 days of malaise, nausea,
vomiting, HA, and impaired vision.  Nausea is exacerbated by
food, and she admits to vomiting 'a couple' times daily without
blood.  She also complains of headache, but is unable to
characterize, worse over the last several days and not relieved
by tyelenol.  Her vision has been progressively decreasing over
the last several months, and she is now having problems [**Location (un) 1131**]
and knitting.  Also, she has had more difficulty walking, but
denies falling or hitting her head.  She denies seizures or new
focal numbness or weakness.  She has no recent fevers or chills.
 She denies CP or SOB.  She has had increasing urinary urge
incontinece for several weeks but no bowel incontinence.  Her
husband did note blood in her stool several days ago, which the
patient attributes to hemmorhoids.  She presented to the ED
today after family called radiation oncology clinic concerned
about her decline over the last several days.

In the ED, inital vitals were temperature 98.6 F, pulse 79,
blood pressure 154/91, respiration 20, and oxygen saturation
100% in room air.  Patient was given 4mg po dex and 10mg IV
along with Tylenol and Zofran.  Non-contrast enhanced head CT
showed showed new 3cm left occipital hemorrhage with vasogenic
edema and smaller right-sided lesion with mass effect, but no
cerebral herniation.  Neurosurgery was evaluated who recommended
conservative therapy, and family agrees not to pursue surgery at
this time.  Her vital signs on transfer were temperature 98.4 F,
blood pressure 147/76, pulse 78, respiration 16, and oxygen
saturation 98% in room air.  On the floor, patient is sitting up
comfortably in bed without complaint.

Past Medical History:
CAD status post PCI stents
Hypertension
Hypothyroidism
Diabetes mellitus type 2
Asthma
Hysterectomy
Status post appendectomy

Past Oncologic History, Per OMR:
Metastatic Melanoma:  status post resection of cutaneous
melanoma from her right calf in [**2144**].  She did well until
[**2168-9-13**] when a right groin mass was discovered. A
lymph node dissection was done on [**2168-11-18**]. At that time,
staging head MRI revealed the left parietal hemorrhagic
metastasis. S/p CTLA-4 antibody on compassionate use complicated
by colitis.  Now she is status post several
CyberKnife radiosurgery treatments for brain mets, last in [**Month (only) **]
of this year:
(1) CyberKnife radiosurgery to left parietal met on [**2169-1-23**] to
[**2159**] cGy,
(2) CyberKnife radiosurgery to left lateral temporal and left
medial temporal mets on [**2169-2-24**] to 1800 and 2200 cGy
respectively,
(3) CyberKnife radiosurgery to right basal ganglia [**2169-6-20**] to
2200 cGy,
(4) CyberKnife radiosurgery to five lesions on [**2169-6-23**] to 2200
cGy each,
(5) Cyberknife radiosurgery to left parieto-occipital (2200 cGy)
and left frontal ([**2159**] cGy) on [**2170-1-30**], and
6. Cyberknife radiosurgery to right frontal and right parietal
metastases on [**2170-6-29**] to [**2159**] cGy.

Also, she recently underwent whole brain cranial irradiation
from [**2170-10-8**] to [**2170-10-12**] to [**2159**] cGy over 5 fractions.

Social History:
She lives at home with husband.  She denies tobacco, drugs.  She

patient's mother and sister had early coronary artery disease as
did her father and two brothers.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 69-year-old woman with h/o metastatic melanoma
with brain metastases, who presents with headache, nausea, and
vomiting.  She was found to have hemorrhagic metastases and
vasogenic edema, admitted for blood pressure control and
conservation management.  Initially stabilized in MICU then
transferred to OMED.

(1) ICH:  Patient with new hemorrhagic metastases and
surrounding vasogenic edema. Neurosurgery consulted, but no
surgical intervention at this time.  Family agrees to
conservative management.  Continued Dexamethasone and Keppra.
Her blood pressure was controlled with lisinopril and nifedipine
with goal SBP <150 4mg IV q6h.  Symptomatic relief of nausea and
HA with zofran and tylenol.

(2) Hyper
