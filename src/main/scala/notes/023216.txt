Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2160**]
Chief Complaint:
Bright red blood per rectum

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD
Colonoscopy
Capsule endoscopy


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 79 year old male with a history of PE, COPD,
Atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diastolic dysfunction and
hypothyroidism presenting with bright red blood per rectum. The
patient was in his usual state of health until approximately
three weeks ago when he developed sudden onset dyspnea and was
hospitalized with pneumonia.  The patient was discharged to a
[**Hospital1 1501**] to complete a course of IV antibiotics.  He was subsequently
hospitalized from [**Date range (1) 61516**] with a pulmonary embolism and was
treated with Lovenox and transitioned to Coumadin.
.
The patient was on both Lovenox and Coumadin prior to this
admission. On the day prior to admission, he developed acute
onset abdominal cramping and asked to use the commode. According
to the [**Hospital 100**] Rehab records, the patient had a large grossly
bloody bowel movement (approx 1 Liter).  He was hemodynamically
stable and transferred to the ED for further evaluation.  He was
feeling otherwise well, aside from continued dyspnea on
exertion, and denies nausea, vomiting, chest pain, headaches,
change in diet, dysuria, fevers or chills.
.
In the ED, his initial vitals were 97.6, BP 135/45, HR 74, RR
17, 94% on 4 L NC.  He reports that his abdominal pain subsided
to intermittent "rumblings," and his review of systems was
otherwise negative. He denies a history of blood per rectum
before. He had another soft, marroon stool while in the ED.  He
also developed some worsened shortness of breath during his ED
course and was treated with 20 mg IV lasix.  He was transferred
to Medicine for furhter evaluation.

Portable chest xray ([**2106-3-19**]): Patchy opacity projecting over
the right mid and lower hemithorax progressed since prior
examination. Differential for this finding includes early
aspiration pneumonitis, pneumonia, with asymmetric alveolar
pulmonary edema felt less likely. Interval followup radiographs
is suggested.
.
Chest CT [**2106-3-26**]: FINDINGS: Superimposed upon marked
centrilobular emphysema are ground- glass opacities and
subsegmental atelectasis in the dependent portion of the right
upper and lower lobes, and to a smaller degree in the superior
segment of the left lower lobe. Secretions and a small fluid
level is identified in segmental branches of the right bronchus.
There are no pleural effusions. Multiple tiny calcified sub 3-
mm granulomas are scattered throughout the lungs. A multinodular
thyroid is partially visualized. There are coronary artery and
aortic vascular calcifications, but the heart and great vessels
at the mediastinum are otherwise unremarkable. No pathologic
adenopathy is present. Evaluation of the visualized abdomen is
limited secondary to arm- related artifact, but there is an
indeterminate soft tissue structure abutting the upper pole of
the right kidney. Degenerative changes are present in the
osseous structures, but no suspicious lesions are identified.
IMPRESSION:
1. Dependent right lung ground-glass opacities with bronchial
secretions is most suggestive of aspiration or evolving
aspiration pneumonitis.
2. Right renal upper pole structure, which may be due to a renal
lesion or adjacent bowel; ultrasound is recommended to exclude
possibility of a renal mass.
.
Renal ultrasound [**2106-3-26**]:
1. Simple-appearing cyst in the superior pole of the right
kidney measuring 5.7 cm, corresponding to the abnormality seen
on recent chest CT. Small left renal cyst.
2. Incompletely distended bladder. Poorly defined structure at
the base of the bladder likely represents an enlarged prostate,
though a bladder mass cannot be entirely excluded. Repeat
examination with a full bladder could be performed.
.
[**2106-3-29**] VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW: A study done in
conjunction with speech and swallow division. Multiple
consistencies of barium were administered to the patient under
constant video fluoroscopy. Oral phase was characterized by
mildly impaired bolus control with premature spillover with thin
liquids. Pharyngeal phase is characterized by mildly reduced
laryngeal elevation with all consistencies of barium. There was
a mild amount of residue within the valleculae after all
consistencies. Patient demonstrated penetration with consecutive
sips of thin liquids. There was one mild aspiration with
teaspoons of thin liquid.

Echo [**2106-3-22**]
MEASUREMENTS:
Left Atrium - Four Chamber Length: *5.5 cm (nl <= 5.2 cm)
Right Atrium - Four Chamber Length: *5.7 cm (nl <= 5.0 cm)
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: >= 70% (nl >=55%)
Aortic Valve - Peak Velocity: 2.0 m/sec (nl <= 2.0 m/sec)
Mitral Valve - E Wave: 1.1 m/sec
Mitral Valve - A Wave: 1.1 m/sec
Mitral Valve - E/A Ratio: 1.00
Mitral Valve - E Wave Deceleration Time: 228 msec

INTERPRETATION:
Findings:
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV
wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets. No AS. No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Mild (1+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.
Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.
PERICARDIUM: There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial
effusion cannot be excluded.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully exclu
