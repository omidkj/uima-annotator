Discharge
[**11-14**] CBC within normal limits
[**11-16**] BG 221, Bicarb 34 and electrolytes were wnl

Imaging:
CXR [**2194-11-5**]: Single AP upright portable view of the chest was
obtained. There are relatively low lung volumes. Mild elevation
of the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged. There has been interval
removal of endotracheal and nasogastric tubes. There is
pulmonary vascular congestion. No large pleural effusions are
seen, although a trace effusion on the left would be difficult
to exclude. No pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette
remains enlarged. IMPRESSION: Pulmonary vascular congestion with
persistent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. No large
pleural effusion is seen, although a small left pleural effusion
would be difficult to exclude.

Brief Hospital Course:
64 year old female with h/o diastolic left-sided CHF, right
heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, DM2, CAD, morbid obesity,
obstructive sleep apnea on CPAP, COPD, obesity hypoventilation
syndrome, and active smoking, who presented with respiratory
failure secondary to acute on chronic diastolic heart failure in
the setting of stopping lasix.  She was initially intubated in
the Medical ICU and subsequently diuresed aggressively on the
medical floor.  Her course was c/b providencii PNA for which she
completed a course of ceftriaxone while in the hospital.  Her
hospital course is further summarized by major issues below.
.
# Acute on chronic diastolic CHF (EF 55% in [**Female First Name (un) **] [**2193**])
complicated by right heart failure: home regimen includes on
ACEi, furosemide, spironolactone, metoprolol. All home meds held
in acute setting while sedated and with borderline pressures.
They were all restarted on the medical floor and titrated back
to her home doses.  We estimate that during this admission, she
was diuresed approximately 20 liters net.  Weight at the time of
discharge was 280.  The patient was re-started on 40 po QD of
lasix which was her prior dose

# Providenci stuartii PNA: [**Year (4 digits) **]-associated gram-negative
rod. Completed course while in the hospital of ceftriaxone,
started [**2194-11-8**], ended [**2194-11-16**]
.
# Chronic venous stasis ulcer with possible surrounding
cellulitis: Improved with wound routine wound care and diuresis.
 Received antibiotics for this in the ED, but these skin changes
seem to be chronic.
.
CHRONIC PROBLEMS:
-OSA/OHS: Supposed to be on CPAP at home but non-compliant.
Modafinil and triazolom held in MICU and not restarted on the
medical floor.
-DM: On metformin at home. Received SSI while here.  [**Month (only) 116**] need to
be on glipizide which she was reportedly on in the past
-CAD: Unclear why she is on plavix monotherapy, but this was
continued. Should address potential need for a statin with her
PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] changed omeprazole to protonix due to interaction
with plavix
-AFIB: Not anticoagulated as an outpatient despite CHADS score
of 3.  In sinus during most of this admission.
-DEPRESSION: Fluoxeteine and abilify.
-COPD: started patient on fluticazone and continued spiriva as
well as nebulizers and breakthrough inhalers.  Confirmed this
regimen with outpatient pharmacy and discontinued symbicort and
trospium.
-patient is a danger to herself and others smoking while on
oxygen.  Her facility has deemed her not a candidate for oxygen
due to this.  She was desaturating to the mid to low 80's while
here.  In the short term, I encouraged her to quit smoking and
only do mild to moderate activity.  Long term, she should
ideally quit smoking and be on oxygen but is scheduled to follow
up with Pulmonary
-Due to this limit in ambulation, continued her on sc heparin
for now
.
Goals of Care: Has a HCP. FULL CODE. Seen by palliative care
while here with no major changes in her stated goals.

Medications on Admission:
ALBUTEROL SULFATE - 2.
