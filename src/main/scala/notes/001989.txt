Attending:[**Male First Name (un) 5282**]
Chief Complaint:
hematemesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD, TIPS

History of Present Illness:
59 yo old gentleman with alcoholic cirrhosis transfered from
[**Hospital 8641**] hospital, NH for hematemesis from Esophageal and gastric
varices. Reports drinking 2 cases of beer daily and last bleed
[**4-1**] with banding. He states he had increased fatigue over
the course of ten days without nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
hematemesis, melena hematochezia. Day of admission to [**Location (un) 8641**]
[**4-21**] patient with hematemesis. This was the patients third
admission in recent months. Banding performed in [**Month (only) 956**]
admission only. While admitted, it appears from review of the
records that his hematocrit remained stable and he did not
receive any blood products. EGD revealed grade I-II varices in
Esophagus and gastrocardiac junction without stigmata of recent
hemorrhage. No evidence of banding. He was maintained on an IV
PPI, no octreotide nor antibiotics were administered.  Patient
was transferred for further evaluation and potential TIPS.
Several episodes of encephalopathy in the setting of bleed in
the past.
.
The patient reports that he continues to have small episodes of
hematemesis as recently as this morning. He has abdominal pain,
chronic back/leg pain and a headache that has lasted several
days. Has loose, non-melanotic guaiac positive stools.
.
VS on admission to the floor: 98.7 158/60 61 18 96%RA. Patient
was transferred to MICU for closer monitoring and potential EGD.

Pertinent Results:
- CXR 1V ([**2109-4-29**]): Pulmonary vascular congestion which improved
between [**4-26**] and [**4-27**] has returned suggesting a borderline
cardiac decompensation. Right basal consolidation is most
consistent with pneumonia, while left basal abnormality which
has improved since [**4-27**] is probably resolving atelectasis,
although it may be related to aspiration. Heart size is normal.
Lateral aspect of the right lower chest is excluded from the
examination. The other pleural surfaces are normal. Right
jugular sheath ends just above the junction with the right
subclavian vein. Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and
out of view.

- TIPS ([**2109-4-26**])

- RUQ ultrasound ([**2109-4-26**]): Limited Doppler examination due to
the covered TIPS shunt is causing acoustic shadowing and
preventing Doppler examination of the flow within the TIPS shunt
itself. Indirect evidence suggests TIPS patency with appropriate
direction based on the flow in the main, anterior right common
and left portal veins. Followup ultrasound in one week is
recommended when the TIPS shunt may be interrogated with
ultrasound.

- TIPS ([**2109-4-25**])

- TTE ([**2109-4-25**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen, secondary to incomplete central leaflet
coaptation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional
biventricular systolic function. Moderate aortic regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.

- EGD ([**2109-4-25**]): Varices at the lower third of the esophagus (4
cords of grade I-II varices); varices at the cardia, injected;
otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum and stomach
antrum.

Brief Hospital Course:
58 year-old male with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol complicated
by esophageal and gastric varices s/p banding in [**2109-1-27**]
transferred from outside hospital on [**2109-4-25**] with hematemesis.
Patient was admitted directly to the MICU, and transferred to
the medical [**Hospital1 **] on [**2109-4-30**]. Hospital course was as follows.
     Hematemesis was most likely secondary to variceal bleeding.
Patient was started on an ocretotide gtt, IV PPI, Ciprofloxacin,
and transfused to keep HCT > 25.  Nadolol and Spironolactone
were held in the setting of acute GI bleed. Patient was kept NPO
during admission. Liver team was consulted. They performed an
EGD on the night of admission.  EGD revealed large gastric
varix, which was injected 2cc, 6cc, with bleeding (hematemesis).
Bleeding appeared to stop. However NG tube with dark blood,
clots. Patient looked unwell. BP transiently dropped to 80's.
Patient was typed and cross matched and received 2 units of
blood. IR was contact[**Name (NI) **] for urgent TIPS. He was intubated prior
to TIPS, with permission from daughter, his health care proxy.
In procedure, initial porto-systemic gradient of 22. Brought
down to 6 after TIPS. Saw esophageal varices. Pre-TIPS saw
splenorenal shunt. Slower filling after TIPS. They did not
perform any embolization on initial TIPS.
     The following morning [**4-26**], patient had a second episode of
hematemesis, 200cc.  Vital signs and HCT were stable. IR
performed a redo of TIPS procedure. Patient was extubated on
[**4-27**]. On [**4-28**] patient was started on Ceftriaxone and Flagyl for
aspiration pneumonia seen on chest x-ray.  The following day a
meeting was held with the [**Hospital 228**] health care proxy and the
MICU team. The daughter concluded that the patient should have
no more care other than treating his hepatic encephalopathy
(i.e. continuing lactulose, rifaximin, but discontinuing all
antibiotics). Central lines were discontinued, and one
peripheral IV was placed. She did not want further antibiotics,
lab draws, blood products, intubation, or resusitation. Patient
was made CMO, with the exception of treating hepatic
encephalopathy in the event that mental status clears and the
patient does not continue to bleed.
     On transfer to the medical service, patient's NG tube fell
out. Per discussion with daughter, the patient would not want
tube replaced. She reported that this was based on lengthy
discussions with her father following recent hospitalizations.
Patient received one dose of lactulose PR. Pain was controlled
with morphine PO; agitation with olanzapine. Patient required
the use of restraints given danger to himself; he made repeated
attempts to get out of bed, and was at risk of falling. He was
alert at times although with limited interaction; he was not
oriented to place or time on discharge. He was hemodynamically
stable on discharge.
