History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 29921**] is a 78 year old male transfered from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]
with a history of CAD and CHF who presents with AICD firing,
palpitations, and newly diagnosed colon cancer.  He had been in
a nursing home and reported fevers and chills at his nursing
home for 1-2 days prior to presentation.  On the morning of
admission his ICD fired several times and so he came to the ED.
VS in [**Location (un) 620**] ED were T103.8, O2 sat 89%RA , HR 128, BP 121/39.
He was given Vanco/CTX/Azith/Zosyn at [**Location (un) 620**] ED for pneumonia.
He was reportedly extremly dry on exam.  He was given 4L of IV
fluids for tachycardia.  Sinus tachycardia evolved into A. fib
with RVR and the patient received diltiazem 10mg IV x2.  Given
concern for PE patient he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for a V/Q
Scan.

In the ED at [**Hospital1 18**] initial vs were: T97.4, HR 120 BP 124/58, RR
24, O2 sat 89% RA, 4L NC was in mid-90's.  Exam was notable for
bilateral LE edema and guaiac positive stool.  The patient had
several episodes of A. Fib with RVR and was given bolus IV
diltiazem and started on a diltiazem gtt.  V/Q scan was done
prior to arrival on the floor.

On the floor, the patient complained of total body joint pain
involving elbows, knees, ankles, and lower left leg.  He denied
chest pain, shortness of breath, or other complaints.  Prior to
arrival on the floor he had received 5L NS.

   Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2174-3-13**]):
      STAPH AUREUS COAG +.    FINAL SENSITIVITIES.
         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.
