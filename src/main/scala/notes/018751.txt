Brief Hospital Course:
1. Respiratory failure - This 70 year old female with severe
COPD s/p trach was transfered from Rehab with respiratory
failure most likely secondary to COPD exacerbation.  Her
respiratory failure was felt to be most likely bronchospastic
secondary to severe COPD and superimposed infection.  She might
also have some component of fluid overload.  She was started on
broad spectrum antibiotics given high risk since she was coming
from a nursing home.  She was started on Vancomycin for possible
MRSA and Zosyn for broad coverage including Pseudomonas.  On [**5-20**]
she grew Stenotrophomonas in her sputum and Timentin was added
for coverage.  On [**5-26**] the Zosyn was discontinued, the Vanco was
discontinued once a 14 day course was complete.  The Timentin
was continued for a 5 day course.
  Throughout her hospital stay attempts were made to wean her
off the ventilator.  She was able to tolerate pressure support
however every occasion when the PEEP was decreased below 8 she
had episodes of desaturation and respiratory difficulty.  On [**5-22**]
a bronchoscopy was performed on which she was noted to have
posterior membrane collapse on exalation with agitation.
Numerous further attempts to wean her off the ventilator were
unsuccessful.  She was continued on steroids and nebs as
treatment for her COPD.  In addition she was treated briefly
with IV Aminophyline which she tolerated without complication.
Based upon this she was started on PO Theophyline which was
titrated up to obtain levels between 8 and 12.  She was also
diuresed aggressively for possible fluid overload as a cause of
increased respiratory failure.
  On [**5-27**] she began to have copious bloody secretions per
her trachostomy.  These were initially felt to be due to trauma
and it they were monitored.  These bloody secretions continued
for several days and repeat CXR showed increased nodular
densities.  Given concern for vasculitis vs. trauma vs. other
cause of hemoptysis.  On [**5-29**] a bronchoscopy was performed which
showed diffuse oozing blood in all airways, no focal bleeding
source.  Otherwise the airways were normal and BAL was
performed.  A chest CT was also performed which showed bilateral
upper love consolidation with nodular opacification.  She was
briefly treated with Voriconazole and cyclophosphamide with
concern for fungal infection vs. vasculitis.  These were d/cd
given low clinical suspicion as well as a normal ESR and CRP.
It was felt that the most likely cause of bleeding was still
trauma for suctioning and the frequency of suctioning was
decreased.
Pt continued to be intubated, in discussion with family, her
code status was changed to comfort measures only and she was
started on a morphine drip.  Pt died on [**6-12**] from respiratory
failure.
.
2. Hypotension - She had some hypotension post diuresis which
resolved with fluid.  She had no further hypotension on
admission.  Her blood pressure was monitored closely.
.
3. Throughout admission she had episodes of tachycardia,
diaphoresis, hypertension, and hypoxia. These episodes were felt
to be due to agitation.  However other possible causes were
ruled out.  A Triptase was normal indicating no allergic
reaction.  Her pain was controlled with morphine.  Psychiatry
was involved in controlling her agitation.  They felt that she
might have some level of delerium and held all benzos.  In
addition she was weaned off her Paxil, however she seemed more
depressed and it was restarted.  She was treated with Haldol as
needed for agitation.  She was continued on calcium channel
blockers for tachycardia.
- Urine Metanephrines pending to evaluate for pheo. 5HIAA
pending to evaluate for carcinoid.
.
4. C.diff - On admission she had just completed a course of PO
Vanco for C.diff.  A repeat sample was sent for c.diff assay
which was negative.  She was monitored for diarrhea given the
inititation of antibiotics, and had no further diarrhea.
.
5. Klebsiella UTI (based on cultures from [**Hospital1 **] - [**5-8**]).  She
was treated with Zosyn on admission which covered the Klebsiella
UTI.  Repeat urine cultures here were negative.

6. She had some Hyponatremia on admission which resolved with NS
IV fluid.

7. CAD/HTN - She was continued on Diltiazem for a.fib and BP
control. Her Captopril was D/Cd on admission given hypotension.
.
8. Anemia. Her HCT dropped at which time she was noted to have
some guiaic positive stool.  NG lavage was negative.  She will
need colonoscopy/EGD once active issues resolved.  Her HCT was
also noted to be dropping at the time of the bloody hemoptysis.
Her HCTs were checked [**Hospital1 **] and she was transfused to keep her HCT
greater than 30.
.
9. Access - On this admission a second PICC line was placed as
her single lumen PICC on the left was inadequate for IV
antibiotics and her multiple other IV medications.
.
10. FEN - She was continued on tube feeds via her g-tube on this
admission.  Her lytes were repleted as needed.
.
11. PPx -  She was treated with Heparin SC for DVT prophylaxis.
She was also treated with a PPI.
13. Social work and Case Management were involved in her care
and further dispo.
14. Code: DNR
15. Rt LE swelling - LENIs were performed for some LE swelling,
they were negative for DVT.
