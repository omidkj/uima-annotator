Admission Date:  [**2157-4-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2157-4-17**]


Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 492**]
Chief Complaint:
hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left VATS pleural biopsy [**4-14**]


History of Present Illness:
This is an 88 yo M with a history of Afib, atrial thrombus, Head
and Neck cancer s/p excision and RXT in [**2150**], COPD, HTN, with a
recent history of chronic hemoptysis secondary to an eroding
broncholith, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital3 **] Hospital today
after massive hemoptysis for flex bronch. Of note, he underwent
flexible bronchoscopy with argon plasma coagulation on [**2156-4-2**] for the above and has been transferred for repeat
treatment. He underwent the flex bronch today with no
complications and was awaiting bronchial artery embolization in
IR when he suddenly developed respiratory distress, desatting on
room air from 95% to 80's and was started on a nonrebreather. He
was never hypotensive. A stat portable chest film was suggestive
of pulmonary edema and lasix 20 IV was pushed and a foley
catheter placed. He had received about 400cc of NS while
awaiting his second procedure. He is transferred to the MICU for
further treatment.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient had already put out about
300 cc in the foley bag, and was considerably less distressed,
satting 100% on the NRB. He was asking for food. He was changed
over to NC at 6L, satting 93% and was breathing at 25-29
breaths/min. He admits to cough, hemoptysis, diarrhea, no
difficulty chewing or swallowing.


Past Medical History:
Afib/Aflutter s/p ablation [**9-30**] (no anticoagulation)
tachy/brady (requiring BB at times)
head/neck CA s/p excision (R) & RXT [**2150**]
hypothyroidism
dysphagia
HTN
HLD
MI [**2133**] s/p CABG [**2134**]
Glaucoma
COPD
Depression/aniety
h/o atrial thrombus


Social History:
Retired from insurance industry, quit tobacco [**2128**] smoked 2
packs for many years. Drinks 2 beers/week

Family History:
non-contributory

Physical Exam:
VS: T: HR 116 BP: 109/74 RR 25 Sats; 96% 6L
General: sitting up in very mild respiratory distress
HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, mucus membranes moist
Neck: supple, no lymphadenopathy, JVP @ 11cm
Card: tachycardic normal S1,S2 1/6 SEM at base
Resp: decreased breath sounds 1/3 up on right, with bibasilar
rales and diffuse rhonchi, expiratory wheezing.
GI: NT/ND +BS
Extr: warm, no edema
Skin: well healed surgical scar extending from inferior lip to
base of throat on right, otherwise wwp.
Neuro: non-focal


Pertinent Results:
CXR [**4-11**] at OSH: RML opacity, CCT: moderate sized spiculated
soft tissue mass in the RML.
.
CXR [**4-14**] portable: FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest
obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position is
analyzed in direct comparison with a preceding similar study
obtained approximately 11 hours earlier during the same date.
Typical central pulmonary edema has developed during the
interval. The previously described right lower lung field
density, apparently the site of a large mass, appears unchanged.



Brief Hospital Course:
88 yo M with large RML mass with hemoptysis, HTN, COPD, afib
admitted with respiratory distress.
.
#. Respiratory Distress: chest film and ivf raise suspicion for
acute pulmonary edema. Without hypotension, hypoxia from ?PE
seems unlikely. Could be bleeding into other lung from the
right, but would expect hemoptysis as well. Cardiac ischemia is
also possible given history. Is doing much better clinically
after moderate diuresis from single dose of IV lasix, now on
nasal cannula. Patient is DNR/DNI.
- continue supplemental O2
- repeat lasix as needed with goal of weaning off O2
- TTE
- cycle enzymes
- check BNP
- monitor on tele
.
#. Hemoptysis/RML mass: Patient had two episodes of hemoptysis
at outside hospital and was awaiting bronchial artery
embolization s/p flex bronch today when this event occurred.
Plan is to continue with embolization in AM. If patient bleeds
acutely overnight, will contact IR stat for embolization.
- maintain 2 large g PIV's
- active T&S
- will hold ctx and azithro
.
#. Diarrhea - patient has been complaining of diarrhea, can send
out c diff, but low suspicion.
.
#. COPD- stable. Continue nebs.
.
#. Afib/Tachy-Brady Syndrome: patient has been tachycardic all
day, but regular, ekg shows an ectopic atrial tachycardia.
Monitor on tele, continue home beta blockade.
.
#. CAD: history of MI in [**2128**]'s s/p cabg and has atrial thrombus
and afib. Unable to give anticoagulation, given hemoptysis.
Continue beta blocker and statin.
.
#. HTN: well controlled currently, continue beta blocker.
.
#. Hypothyroidism: not on supplementation, will check TSH
.
#. FEN: heart healthy low sodium diet, NPO at midnight.
.
#. PPx: pneumoboots
.
#. Access: 2 PIV's 18g/20g
.
#. Code- DNR/DNI
.
Briefly, Mr. [**Known lastname 69574**] was transferred to the floor from the MICU
on [**4-16**] in good condition after having his bronchial artery
embolization on [**4-15**] performed by IR. On the floor, on HD 4, the
patient had some episodes of tachyarrhythmia. The patient was
discharged to home on [**4-17**] after his foley catheter was removed
and he was able to void. He was weaned off of supplemental
oxygen with ambulating saturations in the low 90s. He was also
ambulating well, without much assistance. The patient did
continue to have some tachycardia, however his lisinopril was
started on HD 4 at 2.5mg and his pindolol was increased to 15mg
qdaily.
.
The patient was sent home after he voided, tolerated a regular
meal and with a normal heart rate.
