Chief Complaint:
s/p arrest

History of Present Illness:
36yo male with medical history notable for morbid obesity was
admmitted from the ED s/p cardiac arrest.

Patient was found by his family having tonic clonic movements
and unresponsive. EMS was called and patient was found to be in
Vfib arrest. He was initially cardioverted at 200J and rhythm
converted to asystole. He received epi, atropine, narcan, and
100mg lidocaine for recurrent VF. He was defibrillated again
with conversion to sinus tachycardia. He was intubated and
started on a lidocaine drip. Hypothermia cooling protocol was
initiated at that time and taken to an OSH. At the OSH, vital
signs on arrival were BP 111/66, HR 98, RR 23, temp 98.5, and O2
sat 96% on vent. He was administered midazolam 8mg total, ativan
2mg IV x 2, lopressor 5mg IV x 1, and 1L normal saline bolus.
The patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. Upon arrival at
[**Hospital1 18**], vital signs were temp 37.9, HR 142 / BP 139/50, RR 48,
and O2 sat 97% on vent (unclear what the settings were). He was
switched to propofol boluses for sedation. He was started on the
arctic sun protocol and transferred to the floor. He required
vecuronium x 1.

Patient is intubated and sedated and full review of systems
could not be obtained.  In discussion with his wife, patient was
dizzy one day ago when he bent over to pick up something. On
this day of admission, patient was in his usual state of health.
He and his wife went [**Name2 (NI) **] without any complications. She
heard a noise in their bedroom and found that he had whole body
shaking, eyes rolling back into his head. She called 911 and
then went with him. She thinks he was breathing but unsure if he
had a pulse.

- Portable CXR - [**2165-4-7**] - Bilateral interstitial pulmonary
edema

STUDIES:
- ECG - [**2165-4-8**] - sinus rhythm, tachycardic at ~115 bpm, normal
axis, no acute ST changes
- ECG - [**2165-4-8**] - 4:40am - normal sinus rhythm at 100 bpm,
normal axi, no acute ST changes with possible mild TWI in I and
avL
- CXR - [**2165-4-8**] -
 Mild cardiomegaly. Upper mediastinal widening needs further
evaluation. Possible
left lung contusion or aspiration.
- 2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
The left ventricle is not well seen. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %). The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad.

IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body
habitus. Left ventricular function is mildly hypokinetic, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The
right ventricle is not well seen but is probably mildly
dilated/hypokinetic. No pathologic valvular abnormality seen.
Pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.


Brief Hospital Course:
In brief, this is a 36yo male with morbid obesity was admitted
s/p cardiac arrest at home.

1. s/p Arrest
The exact etiology of his arrest was unclear and was very
difficult to assess given that he was unmonitored at the time of
the event. Given patient's multiple medical problems including
sleep apnea, asthma, and morbid obesity, a likely etiology of
his arrest was thought to be PE. Other diagnoses entertained
included arrest in the setting of hypoxia related to his
obesity-hypoventilation, sleep apnea, and asthma. Additional
differential diagnosis included ischemia, structural heart
disease, and arrhythmia, although patient has no prior history
of any of these abnormalities and initial EKG showed only sinus
tachycardia with no ischemic changes. Patient was seen in the ED
and started on the arctic sun cooling protocol. This was
continued for 24hours and then the patient was re-warmed.
Neurology was consulted and EEG was performed. TTE showed RV
dilation consistent with PE. Patient's weight prohibited him
from having a CTA or cardiac angiogram, however, given the
paucity of other plausible diagnoses and the risk of not
treating a PE the patient was started on heparin gtt
empirically. He was then bridged onto coumadin and will need to
remain on this for 6 months for presumed PE. His INR will be
checked at rehab and coumadin will be adjusted as necessary.

2. Leukocytosis
Etiology of his leukocytosis was initially thought most likely
related to his Vfib arrest, however he had a positive UA. He was
treated for complicated UTI with 10 days of ciprofloxacin. His
culture was not positive, however he had received one dose of
Vancomycin and one dose of Zosyn empirically for possible
