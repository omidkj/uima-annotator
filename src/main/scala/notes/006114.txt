History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known firstname 12335**] [**Known lastname **] is an 80 year old woman with a history of
paranoid schizophrenia, anoxic brain injury and advanced

eating breakfast.

In the ED, initial vs were: T 96.5 P 140 BP 162/116 R 28 O2 sat
80%. Patient was in significant respiratory distress on
presentation with oxygen saturations falling into the 70s.  She
was urgently intubated. Report of large amount of pink frothy
sputum. Patient initially with persistent hypoxia requiring FiO2
100%. Subsequent ABG revealed 7.25/60/323/28. CXR was performed

with trace protein and ketones, glucose 278, and Na 134. In
addition to antibiotics patient was given 2L NS, protonix 40 mg
IV, versed 2 mg IV bolus and fentanyl 50 mcg IV bolus.

On arrival to the ICU, patient is awake but not answering
questions.
