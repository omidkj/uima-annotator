Radiology:
CXR [**11-16**]: Diffusely increased opacities at the lung fields
bilaterally. In an immunocompromised patient, this is concerning
for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2**]. Radiographically, the differential includes
pulmonary edema. Additionally, there is a faint opacity at the
right lung base, which may represent atelectasis or focal
pneumonic process.
.
CT-Head [**11-16**]: Focus of low attenuation within the subcortical
white matter of the right medial frontal lobe. This may
represent a subacute infarction; however, an underlying mass
lesion cannot be completely excluded. An MRI examination with
gadolinium and diffusion-weighted imaging is recommended for
further evaluation. No intracranial hemorrhage noted.
.
MR-head-w&w/o gadolinium [**11-18**]:
Signal abnormality in the medial right frontal lobe involving
the corpus callosum does not demonstrate enhancement. This
finding most likely represent a small infarct. However, in
absence of ADC map, age of the infarct could not be determined.
No abnormal enhancement is seen. Follow up is suggested, if
clinically indicated.
.
Echo [**11-18**]:
1.The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or
vegeta
