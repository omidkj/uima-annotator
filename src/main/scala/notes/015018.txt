Service: [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
82 yo M w/ h/o IMI, DM, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, CHF with EF
of 30%, and COPD who was recently admitted to [**Hospital3 **] [**Date range (1) 14447**] for SOB and was treated for COPD flare with
steroids. After d/c pt experienced SOB, PND, orthopnea for 2
nights and daughter called EMS on [**9-27**] for SOB, but on their
arrival pt was improved sitting in chair sat'ing 95% on RA and
was not treated. The next day (DOA) pt was again feeling SOB
with PND, orthopnea, and abd pain and was brought to [**Hospital1 18**]. Pt
has h/o recent H.pylori infxn and was c/o black stools. Hct was
39.2 and occult blood negative. He was given 2L NS for ? GIB in
the ED and developed worsening SOB and cardiac enzymes revealed
CK 111, MB 9 trop 0.12. EKG showed ST elevations in V2-V3. Pt
received lopressor, nitro, amio (for ? runs of NSVT per ED
nursing note), heparin gtt, and integrillin. He was taken to the
cath lab where coronaries showed no acute disease. It showed
mild LAD, LCx, 60% LMCA, and TO of RCA with collaterals
supplying territory. RA 13, RV 67/17, PA 44/24, PCWP 18, CO
2.97, CI 1.6. Pt became agitated and had decreased MS so was
electively intubated. IABP was inserted and sBP dropped to the
40's. IABP was d/c'd and the sBP rose to the 70's. Dopamine and
Levophed were started and sBP increased to the 110's. Echo
showed some AI, severity unclear.
     [**Name2 (NI) **] family ROS was positive for fevers, chills, cough
productive of brown sputum.

Pertinent Results:
CXR ([**2102-9-28**]):
The heart is top-normal in size. Mediastinal contours are
unchanged. There is perihilar haziness bilaterally and slight
prominence of the upper zone pulmonary vasculature, consistent
with mild congestive heart failure. The left costophrenic angle
is excluded from the radiographs on all three views. Allowing
for this, there are probable bilateral pleural effusions, right
greater than left. The surrounding osseous structures appear
osteopenic. Flattening of the hemidiaphragms and coarsened
interstitial markings bilaterally, consistent with emphysematous
change.

Coronary Cath ([**9-28**]):
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system

revealed multi vessel coronary disease.  The LMCA had a distal
60%
lesion.  The LAD had serial 50% stenosis in the proximal and mid
vessel.
The RCA was totally occluded proximally, but filled via left to
right
collaterals.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed an elevated mean PCPW of
28mmhg.
Cardiac index was low at 1.6 l/m/m2. Central aortic pressure was

elevated at 164/81.
3.  Left ventriculography was not performed.
4.  Due to respiratory distress the patient was intubated during
the
procedure.
5.  Due to decompensated CHF, an intra-aortic baloon pump was
inserted.
Shortly following insertion and intubation, the patient became
hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the 80s.  The IABP
was
stopped and the pressure improved to 90s to 100s.  This raised
concern
for AI so an echocardiogram was performed which revealed
markedly
depressed ejection fraction of ~20%.  AI was noted on color
doppler and
seemed to increase when the baloon pump was turned on.  For this
reason,
the baloon pump was removed.  The patient was sent to the CCU
intubated,
on dopamine and levophed for hemodynamic support.  On leaving
the
catheterization lab, the patient's cardiac index had increased
to 2.4
l/min/m2 and his SBP was in the 110s.  His PCPW had decreased to
20mmHg.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe systolic ventricular dysfunction.

Echocardiogram ([**9-29**])
The left ventricular cavity is dilated. There is severe global
left
ventricular hypokinesis (ejection fraction 20 percent). Right
ventricular
chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic function
appears depressed.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but not
stenotic. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened.
There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

RIGHT GROIN ULTRASOUND ([**9-30**]): Normal flow is seen in the right
common femoral artery and vein. There is a small tract extending
from the right common femoral artery all the way to the skin
likely representing the former catheter tract. This tract is
small and measures approximately 5 mm immediately under the
skin. Color flow is seen within the tract, and some arterial
flow on doppler signal is also identified within it.
IMPRESSION: Persistent flow in the former catheter tract over a
length of 2.9 cm (5 mm in largest diameter). This would be
amenable to ultrasound guided embolization if clinically
warranted.

ART DUP EXT R LE;F/U ([**10-2**])
Duplex evaluation was performed of the right lower extremity
arterial and venous system with concentration on the inguinal
region. The appearance and wave forms of the femoral artery and
vein are normal. There is no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV
fistula.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of right inguinal pseudoaneurysm or AV
fistula


Brief Hospital Course:
82 yo M with CAD, CHF EF 30%, recent COPD exacerbation,
diarrhea, F/C, H. pylori infxn who p/w SOB, cath without
evidence of acute disease who developed subsequent hypotension,
leukocytosis, and coffee-ground emesis.
1. CV:
A. CAD: no evidence of acute lesions on cath (just chronic). ASA
was continued. BP meds were held initially while pt was
intubated on pressors, but then after extubation ACEi and
Diltiazem were restarted and titrated up to achieve good BP
control.
B. PUMP: EF 30% shown on echo x one week ago at OSH. Repeat echo
showed severe Left LV hypokinesis with EF of 20%. 1+ MR, 1+AR.
Pt was weaned off of pressors and then diuresed with IV Lasix.
His Cr bumped slightly to 2.2, but then started trending down.
The pt had good UOP and a successful diuresis. Spironolactone
was also started.
C. RHYTHM: Pt had many runs of NSVT, the longest of which were
22 beats in duration. EP was consulted but pt stated he would
not want any interventions, incluing a EP study or ICD or BiV
pacer.
D. HYPOTENSION: When the pt left the cath lab he was very
hypotension, and the etiology seemed to be most likely adrenal
insufficiency. Random cortisol level was very low. Pt had been
on prednisone x 12 days from his previous hospitalization.  He
was given dexamethasone 4mg IV q8 for 24 hours, then this was
tapered down to prednisone 20 mg po qd. The pt will remain on
this for COPD until it is tapered by PCP as [**Name9 (PRE) 3782**] after lungs
have improved.
E. R groin psuedoaneurysm: After the pt's catheterization the pt
was found to have a small R groin pseudoaneurysm by U/S. A
pressure dressing was placed and a repeat U/S showed that the
pseudoaneurysm had resolved and no inj
