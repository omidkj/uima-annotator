Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was left intubated post operation due to some
concerns of hypotenstion.  This resoled quickly and he was
extubated.  He was extubated by the AM of POD1.  He did well
postoperativly.  He had epidural anesthesia, which provided good
pain control.  He was moved to the VICU on POD1.  His diet was
held until flatus was passed.  His INR was revered with Vit K.
A bleeding time was done to assess coagulation, which was
normal.  His swan catheter was changed to cvl on POD 3 due to
stable cardiac function.  In the OR, a stomach mass was found,
so Dr.[**Name (NI) 1482**] service was consulted, he will f/u as an
outpt.  He was found to have a weak left deltoid, and neurology
was consulted.  After extensive radiological study, no definate
cause for his weakness was found, but it had almost complealty
resolved by the time of discharge.  Otherwise his diet advanced
without incident and he did well from a PT persepective.  He was
d/c'ed on POD 7 on coumadin to be followed by his PCP.
