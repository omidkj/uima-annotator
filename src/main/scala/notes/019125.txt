History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 77287**] is an 88yo male with PMH significant for colon
cancer with known metastases to the liver and lung who presents
with respiratory distress, hypotension, and confusion. Per
patient's daughter, the patient has not been himself over the
past few days. He has been frantic, nervous, and concerned that
he cannot breath. The patient confirms this on questioning and
has noted increasing SOB over the past few days. He is on 2L NC
at home. Earlier this evening, Mr. [**Known lastname 77287**] told his daughter
that he could not breath. "I am so nervous" he said. Half hour
later his daughter found him slouched in a chair, disoriented,
and somewhat unreponsive. He was also hyperventilating at the
time. There was no report of fevers, chills, chest pain,
abdominal pain, or any other symptoms. He does admit to a
chronic productive cough. Upon EMS arrival, his O2 sat was 75%
on 2L NC which increased to 91% after a neb treatment.
.
In the ED his initial vitals were T 94.9 BP 162/105 AR 94 RR 40
O2 sat 97% on NRB (15L). He was noted to be wheezy. He received
a Combivent neb, Levaquin 750mg IV, Ceftriaxone 1g IV,
Vancomycin 1g IV, Solumedrol 125mg IV, and ASA 325mg PO. His SBP
dropped to 79/46 and he was immediately infused with IVFs
through his port with an immediate bump in his BP to 103/56. His
O2 sat also improved to 98% on 4L.
.
On further questioning, the patient was recently completed his
last cycle of 5-FU on [**3-14**]. On a follow-up CT scan he was found
to have partial lung collapse. He was admitted to [**Hospital1 2025**] and
started on supplemental oxygen at this time. Per family, he is
not a candidate for further chemotherapy and plans were being
made for hospice care.

Past Medical History:
1)Metastatic colon ca: s/p resection in [**2164**] complicated by
leak; underwent ileostomy but hospital course complicated by
septic shock. He then underwent reverse ileostomy. He has known
metastases to liver and lung. Completed last cycle of
chemotherapy on [**2167-3-14**] with 5-FU.
2)CAD s/p stent in [**2161**] and [**2163**] at [**Hospital6 2561**]

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 77287**] is an 88 year old male with metastatic colon cancer
who presents with increasing respiratory distress, confusion,
and hypotension.
.
1) Respiratory distress: Patient was noted to be hypoxic at
home.  On initial presentation, his oxygen saturation was 72% on
his home 2L of oxygen.  He responded immediately to nebulizer
treatements, which made the most likely diagnosis of his
respiratory distress bronchospasm.  He was maintained on
nebulizer treatments and prednisone to complete a 5 day burst.
He was however, also covered with levofloxacin and flagyl for
possible pneumonia given his CXR appearance that showed
metastatic disease with inability to rule out underlying
pneumonia.
He was discharged with nebulizer treatments at home, oxygen as
needed at home, prednisone to complete 5 day burst, and
levofloxacin/flagyl to complete 7 day course.
.
2) Hypotension: Patient was transiently hypotensive in ED with
BP improvement quickly with IVFs. Likely dehydrated based on
history obtained from daughter. [**Name (NI) **] has had poor PO intake over
the past week. No evidence of an infection.  IVF was continued
during hospital course with improvement in blood pressure.
.
3) Mental status changes: Per daughter, patient was found to be
confused earlier this evening. Mental status returned to
baseline upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] after treatment of hypoxia with
nebulizer treatments. Patient does not remember course of
events.  Mental status remained at baseline during hospital
course.
.
4) Metastatic colon cancer: Patient has metastases to liver and
lung. He is not a candidate for additional chemotherapy and was
scheduled to meet with hospice nurses on day after admission.
Hospice evaluated patient in the hospital and was set up to
discharge home on hospice.
.
5) Coronary Artery Disease: Patient with history of 2 stents at
outside hospital. No complaint of chest pain on this admission.
Troponin mildly elevated. EKG unremarkable.  Patient was ruled
out for acute MI.  No further active issues during hospital
course.
.
6) History of DVT/PE: Diagnosed in the setting of surgery. On
anti-coagulation as outpatient.  Coumadin was continued with
goal INR 2 (lower end given history of lung metastases and
hemoptysis).
.
7) Atrial fibrillation: Patient currently in sinus rhythm.
Outpatient sotalol and digoxin were continued.
.
8) Anxiety: Per family, pt is extremely anxious at baseline
likely related to underlying cancer and prognosis.  Remeron was
continued.  Patient was given morphine as needed.
.
9) Code: DNR/DNI (confirmed with HCPs); daughter:
(H)[**Telephone/Fax (1) 77288**], (C)[**Telephone/Fax (1) 77289**]; son: (H)[**Telephone/Fax (1) 77290**],
(C)[**Telephone/Fax (1) 77291**].
.
10) Dispo:  Patient discharged home with hospice.
