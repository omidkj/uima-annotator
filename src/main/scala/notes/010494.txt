Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 695**]
Chief Complaint:
Cholangiocarcinoma.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left hepatic lobectomy, cholecystectomy, common bile duct
excision, loop hepaticojejunostomy to the right hepatic duct
over a 10-French Silastic catheter, extensive lysis of
adhesions.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 72-year-old female who presented with jaundice
and was noted to have a stricture in the mid common bile duct as
well as in the left hepatic duct near the confluence.  Cytology
samples from both strictures were positive for malignant cells.
EUS demonstrated ill-defined 2 cm x 0.9 cm hypoechoic mass in
the common hepatic duct.  She had a CA19-9 of less than 3.  Her
initial liver function tests include AST 938, ALT 555, alkaline
phosphatase 549, total bilirubin 14. She subsequently underwent
placement of bilateral transhepatic catheters that demonstrated
positive cytology from the left hepatic duct stricture and the
mid common duct stricture as noted above.
.
She was also noted to have compromised pulmonary function tests
with FEV1 of 1.0 related to chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease secondary to smoking. This improved to an FEV1 of 1.4 on
bronchodilators and with discontinuation of smoking.  An
echocardiogram demonstrated mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with regional left ventricular dysfunction
consistent with coronary artery disease. She had a mild resting
left ventricular outflow tract gradient. Her LVEF was 55% to
60%.  She had mild aortic stenosis and moderate pulmonary
hypertension.  A sestamibi stress test demonstrated normal
myocardial perfusion and left ventricular ejection fraction was
48%. The stress portion demonstrated no anginal symptoms or
additional ST-segment changes from baseline. With drainage, her
liver function tests improved and most recently include AST 27,
ALT 19, alkaline phosphatase 92, total bilirubin 1.4, albumin
3.9. She is now brought to the operating room for
cholecystectomy, common bile duct excision, left hepatic
lobectomy and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy.

Imaging:
[**2139-6-2**]: Preoperative CXR: In comparison with the study of
[**5-9**], the patient has taken a better inspiration. The areas of
suspected nodularity seen on the previous AP view are not
definitely appreciated at this time. CT, of course, would be
more sensitive for nodule detection if clinically indicated.

[**2139-6-10**]: Tube Cholangiogram:
INDICATION: 72-year-old woman status post left hepatic
lobectomy,
cholecystectomy, common bile duct excision, loop
hepaticojejunostomy to the right hepatic duct with 10 French
Silastic catheter h/o extensive lysis of adhesions. For gravity
cholangiogram to assess anastomosis.
COMPARISON: PTC from [**2139-5-7**].
FINDINGS:
1. Prompt opacification of jejunal loops and remaining right
hepatic ducts.
2. Nondilated intrahepatic ductal system.
3. Drainage of nondependent right ducts through patent
anastomosis.
IMPRESSION:
Findings are compatible with a patent hepaticojejunostomy.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the West 1 Surgical Service for left
hepatic lobectomy, cholecystectomy, common bile duct excision,
loop hepaticojejunostomy to the right hepatic duct over a
10-French Silastic catheter, and extensive lysis of adhesions on
[**2139-6-5**]. The surgery was without complication. Intraoperatively
she did have an episode of hypotension requiring pressors, and 1
unit of pRBC.  After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the
patient arrived on the floor NPO, on IV fluids, with a foley
catheter, and IV pain control.  The patient was hemodynamically
stable.
.
Neuro: The patient received IV analgesics with good effect and
adequate pain control.  When tolerating regular oral intake, the
patient was transitioned to oral pain medications, Dilaudid.
.
CV: While in the PACU, the patient was in junctional rhythm, but
converted to sinus rhythm once on the floor. Throughout her
admission she was occasionally hypertensive to SBPs in the 190s,
for which she received hydralazine prn, and was continued on her
home verapamil SR. On discharge her blood pressure was at its
baseline, in the 160s/60s.
.
Pulmonary: Given the patient's COPD, she was initially kept on
3L O2 on arrival to the floor post-operatively. Her O2 was
weaned, and on discharge she was saturating 95% on RA. Since she
desaturated to 88% while walking with physical therapy, home
oxygen was arranged for her with VNA. Good pulmonary toilet,
early ambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged
throughout hospitalization. She was continued on her home
Spiriva, and received albuterol nebulizers to assist her with
her breathing.
.
GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV
fluids. Diet was advanced when appropriate, which was well
tolerated.  Patient's intake and output were closely monitored,
and IV fluid was adjusted when necessary.  Electrolytes were
initially followed, and repleted when necessary (particularly
the patient's K, which was frequently repleted). The fluids were
stopped when the patient tolerated diet. She underwent a tube
cholangiogram on POD5, which showed a patent anastamosis.
Subsequently, her PTC was capped on POD5.   Her JP output
gradually decreased post-operatively, and it was pulled on POD6
on the
