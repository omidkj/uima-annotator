History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 71411**] is a 34 y.o. F with Crohn's disease on Imuran and
Pentasa, who started having fever, headache, myalgias,
rhinorrhea, and sore throat on [**2194-9-1**]. Prior to this,
she had travelled to [**Country 6607**] 12 days earlier. Was in some rural
areas. She came to the [**Hospital1 **] ER 1 week prior to her
admission in early [**Month (only) **] for feeling unwell. She was sent
home. Her symptoms worsened and she went to her PCP's office,
who by report, tested her for influenzae, which was positive.
She was not put on Tamiflu given her symptoms were > 48 hours.
Symptoms worsened and she presented again to the [**Hospital1 **]-N ED on
[**9-13**].
.
The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 **]-N ICU and was found to be
influenzae and mycoplasma positive. She was started on tamiflu
for 5 days. Pt also found to have Mycoplasma IgM positive on
[**2194-9-17**], which was thought to be cause of her hepatitis as well.
CTA chest was completed also which revealed bilateral lobe
consolidation concerning for pna, small bilateral pleural
effusions, small pericardial effusion, and splenomegaly. She was
treated for secondary bacterial pneumonia as [**Doctor Last Name **]. Initially on
ceftriaxone and doxycycline, then changed to vanco and zosyn
after continued to be febrile 101. When mycoplasma was returned
positive, zosyn changed to levaquin and doxy was stopped.
Continued to be tachypneic with shallow breathing.
.
During her time at [**Hospital1 **]-N, the patient had transaminitis.
Initially, thought to be obstructive process. HIDA revealed
severe liver dysfunction. MRCP showed hepatosplenomegaly with
concerns of early portal hypertension. INR 1.6 on discharge. She
was seen by surgery and gastroenterology. Thought that hepatitis
was due to mycoplasma. She was also noted to be pancytopenic -->
heme was consulted and no evidence of hemolysis. Thought to be
BM suppression secondary to infection with thrombocytopenia for
splenomegaly.
.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup. Currently, the
patient feels that she has a painful, dry throat. She is asking
for ice chips. She has worsened diffuse abdominal pain different
from a Crohn's falre. If she moves or hiccups, the abdominal
pain is worse. She notes gaining wt recently but cannot tell me
how much -- possibly 10 lbs while at [**Location (un) 620**].
.
ROS: Endorses weakness, mild fevers, nasal congestion,
nonproductive cough, chest pain, increased SOB that has worsened
at [**Location (un) **]. Denies melena, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria,
rhinorrhea, ankle swelling.

CMV IgG ANTIBODY (Final [**2194-9-19**]):
      POSITIVE FOR CMV IgG ANTIBODY BY EIA.
      18 AU/ML.
      Reference Range:  Negative < 4 AU/ml, Positive >= 6 AU/ml.


CMV IgM ANTIBODY (Final [**2194-9-19**]):
      POSITIVE FOR CMV IgM ANTIBODY BY EIA.
      INTERPRETATION: SUGGESTIVE OF RECENT/ACTIVE INFECTION.
      A positive IgG result generally indicates past exposure.
      Infection with CMV once contracted remains latent and may
reactivate
      when immunity is compromised.
      Interpret IgM result with caution; liver disease,
autoimmune and
      lymphoproliferative diseases may cause false positive
results.
      IgM antibody may persist for 6 months or longer after
primary
      infection and may reappear during reactivation.
      Greatly elevated serum protein with IgG levels >[**2185**] mg/dl
may cause
      interference with CMV IgM results.
      Submit follow-up serum in [**2-4**] weeks.

[**2194-9-19**] Blood CMV viral load 38,200 copies/mL
Imaging:

CT abd/pelvis ([**9-19**]): IMPRESSION:
1. Thickening and irregularity of the entire terminal ileum with
fistula formation consistent with Crohn's disease. Interval
resolution of abdominal phlegmon with minimal scarring and no
definite mesenteritis.
2. Abdominal ascites.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis.
4. Moderate pericardial effusion.
5. Thickening of the right colon likely secondary to hepatitis
and third spacing.
6. Hepatosteatosis and hepatomegaly.

Liver biopsy: [**2194-9-19**]: Liver, transjugular needle biopsy:
1.  Moderate diffuse lobular mixed inflammation composed of
lymphocytes and neutrophils.
2.  Cellular changes consistent with cytomegalovirus effect.
3.  Severe mixed steatosis without associated intracytoplasmic
hyalin.
4.  Focal balloon cell degeneration is seen.
5.  Scattered cell show immunoreactivity for cytomegalovirus.
6.  No immunoreactivity is seen for HSV [**1-3**].
7.  Trichrome and iron stains are pending, and will be reported
in an addendum.
Note: The findings of severe steatosis, balloon cell
degeneration, and lobular mixed inflammation raises the
possibility of a pre-existing with toxic metabolic injury with
superimposed CMV infection.

RUQ ultrasound ([**9-26**]):
IMPRESSION: Small amount of ascites localized to inferior aspect
of right
lower quadrant and left lower quadrant.

Abdominal U/S with doppler ([**10-1**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Hepatosplenomegaly with echogenic liver. Echogenic liver may
be related
to diffuse fatty infiltration or other forms of liver disease.

2. Appropriate directional flow of hepatic arteries, hepatic
veins, and
portal veins.
3. Diffuse gallbladder wall edema, similar to the CT from
[**2194-9-19**]. The
gallbladder is only moderately distended, and may be secondary
to hepatitis.
