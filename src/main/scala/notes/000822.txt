History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]F with hx of dementia, CRI presents to the ED with fever,
diarrhea and altered mental status.  Per nursing home, pt had a
CXR on [**11-15**] (for congestion?) which showed an infiltrate.  At
that time, she was started on levaquin for the PNA and flagyl
for ppx against C. diff.  One day later, pt started having
fevers to 101 and large amounts of diarrhea associated with
change in mental status.  Her blood pressure was in the 100s (nl
130s) with HR in the 120s.  Labs were checked and she was found
to have a WBC of 38.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1266**] was alerted and she was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
On arrival to the [**Name (NI) **], pt's BP was in the 60s/30s with HR in the
110s, temp 101 (R).  She received 4L NS and her bld pressure
gradually increased to 90s/40s.  After blood and urine cx were
drawn, she was given vanc and zosyn.
.
Per nursing home, pt's baseline mental status waxes and wanes
[**1-31**] her dementia but she is verbal.  She is dependent in all her
ADLs.

PEG: IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated percutaneous placement of a
gastro jejunal feeding tube.

LIVER US: IMPRESSION:
1. One of the left lobe of liver lesions represents a cyst.
Another left lobe of liver lesion is not fully characterized but
may represent a cyst. Right liver lesions are not visualized on
this exam.

The examination could be re-attempted, when the patient is able
to tolerate it. Alternatively, contrast-enhanced CT or MRI could
be considered.

2. Ascites fluid is not visualized on this four-quadrant survey.
A very small amount is seen on CT.

3. Right pleural effusion.

CT HEAD: IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage. Calcified
extraaxial mass adjacent to the left frontal lobe likely
represents a calcified meningioma.

CT ABD: IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions with probable
compression atelectasis, however, underlying pneumonia cannot be
ruled out and evaluation is limited due to lack of intravenous
contrast.

2. Mild amount of ascites and pelvic free fluid with diffuse
edema of the pelvic mesentery. No direct evidence of colitis or
diverticulitis noted.

3. Ill-defined hypoattenuating lesions within the liver, too
small to characterize by CT and evaluation limited by lack of
intravenous contrast. If clinically indicated, further workup
with ultrasound or contrast-enhanced CT/MRI may be ordered.

4. Levoscoliosis and degenerative changes of the spine.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] in septic shock with SBPs
70-80s/40-50s, MAPs 50-60s, s/p 6L IVF.  Her O2 sats were stable
in the low 90s on RA.  She was mentating, though mumbling
(demented at baseline). septic shock: the etiology of pt's shock
was presumed to be c. diff given her history of recent
antibiotic use (amoxicillin, levaquin) and profuse diarrhea.
Blood, urine, and sputum cultures were obtained on admission,
and pt was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics including
zosyn and vancomycin empirically given the severity of her
shock.  she was also continued on IV flagyl as she was not
taking PO.  per discussion with ID, PO vanco was not started as
she had not yet failed flagyl.  KUB and CT abdomen were obtained
which were negative for toxic megacolon or diverticulitis.
Nursing home stool culture on [**11-19**] were positive for c. diff,
and vanco and zosyn were discontinued.  her blood and urine
cultures were  unremarkable.  retrocardiac opacity on admission
CXR was not felt to represent infiltrate.
.
Pt was breifly treated with levophed for <12 hrs for MAPs 50s on
[**11-18**] after failing to have improvement in SBP after ~10L IVF.
she was weaned off on [**11-18**].  she subsequently required
intermittent IVF boluses (2L) for decreased UOP and MAPs 50s x 1
when she went for CT abdomen.   On [**11-19**], pt was noted to have
increased O2 requirement to 2L, and had rales on exam.  As she
was  net +10L, she was given IV lasix 10mg  to facilitate
diuresis on [**11-19**] and [**11-20**].  Her blood pressure tolerated this
well.  Urine sediment revealed muddy brown casts on [**11-19**], and
plan was to avoid further IVF for low UOP as pt was
euvolemic/volume overloaded.  If her mental status improves,
plan was to switch from IV flagyl to PO flagyl.

ARF/CRI: cre baseline ~0.9 ([**2138**]), peaked 2.2 on admission, then
trended down with aggresive IVF resucitation.  however, urine
with +muddy brown casts on [**11-19**], c/w ATN likely [**1-31**]
hypotension.  plan was to follow, and tolerate UOP 10-20cc/hr.
pt started on lasix 10mg IV prn (home dose 20mg po qd) on [**11-19**]
to try to remove fluid in anticipation of declining UOP from her
ATN (goal even to negative).
- lasix 10mg IV prn [**11-20**], goal even to negative.
- follow UOP, creatinine daily.
- low UOP [**1-31**] ATN, though unclear why creatinine is coming down
so quickly, will follow UOP, flush foley, and consider bladder
scan if UOP drops again.

# altered mental status: pt demented at baseline per report, but
her MS waxes and wanes at baseline per daughter, pt will have
long periods of being nonverbal followed by periods of being
much more interactive.  current MS likely [**1-31**] infection
overlying baseline dementia.  she responds to questions, but
generally mumbles.  generally follows commands this AM.  no
focal deficit on limited neuro exam.
- follow mental status
- iv/im 1-2mg haldol prn agitation.
- cont home zyprexa prn agitation
- cont namenda, remeron for dementia

# anemia: pt was noted to have hct drop from 30->25 after 5
liters IVF (normal saline); pt had a hct=32.5 in [**12-31**].  on [**11-19**]
pt receied 1U PRBC for hct=25 in the setting of septic shock.
iron studies were obtained which suggest ACD possibly [**1-31**] CRI
and OA.  plan was to follow hct, and guaic all stools.
.
.
# Hyperglycemia: pt was treated with an insulin sliding scale.
.
# chronic lower extremity edema: 2+ edema B LE, chronic, could
be exacerbated by fluid resuscitation and ?dCHF on TTE (E/A
0.6).  on [**11-19**] pt restarted on lasix 10mg iv prn (home dose
20mg po qdaily) as her SBPs were stable.
# glaucoma - continue home eye drops.
.
Pt ultimately transferred to floor. P
