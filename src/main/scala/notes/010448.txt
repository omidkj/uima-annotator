Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8810**]
Chief Complaint:
[**Hospital **] transferred from [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for chemo


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line


History of Present Illness:
This is 73 year old male with multiple medical problems
including burkitt's lymphoma, seizure of unclear etiology, afib
on amiodarone transferred from [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to OMED service for
induction of chemotherapy.
.
On evening of [**2134-9-5**] patient had two episodes of "shaking and
gurgling," coherent but slurred speech and right mouth droop
witnessed by his wife and a third witness by EMS where he
received 2mg ativan with resolution of shaking.  In [**Name (NI) **] pt felt
to be post-ictal, did not remember ambulance ride, neuro
consulted and pt loaded with Dilantin. CT head negative, LP
performed and pt started on CTX and Vanco for meningitis
prophylaxis.
.
His [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course was notable for: Neruologic issues relating to
possible seziure acitivty for which he recieved an LP, started
on CTX/vanc. for broad spectrum meningitis coverage; EEG
perfomred, overall not clear what this neurologic process was
(stroke vs. seizures vs. infection); also treated for
arachnoiditis with dexamethasone. Pt also with F and N, prior
micro grew GNR in [**12-29**] bottle during last admission with
Stenatropamonas, being treated with bactrim IV tid. While in
unit, pt was in NSR, on amiodarone, lasix continued, plavix held
[**1-27**] possible chemo. Other issues stable including Hct.
.
On transfer, patient reports no fever or chills, headache, chest
pain, cough, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, or
vomitting.  Reports dizziness worsened with sitting up and
constipation.
.
Transferred to OMED/HEME B service for further care.

Studies:
[**9-6**] CXR-- Patchy opacity in the left retrocardiac area, likely
due to atelectasis. Aspiration is considered less likely. No
pleural effusions.
.
[**9-6**] CT HEAD-- no IC bleed
.
[**9-6**] FDG scan--
1. No focal abnormal areas and a increased FDG uptake.
2. Lytic lesions within the right ilium and superior aspect of
the left  acetabulum as described above.  These are of uncertain
etiology or significance, but not do not demonstrate any
significant FDG uptake.  Tiny calcifications which may be
present in the right iliac lesion may be related to a focus of
treated lymphoma.  Correlation with past history is recommended.

3. Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
4. Bibasilar pulmonary scarring with somewhat more consolidative
changes at the right lung base.
5. Marked coronary calcifications

Brief Hospital Course:
73 y.o male with Burkitt's lymphoma presents with new seizures
after recent intrathecal [**Hospital 3454**] transferred to OMED/BMT B service
to initiation of CODOX chemotherapy [**9-7**].
.
Plan:
## Neuro: Patient's seizure was likely secondary to intrathecal
chemo causing irritation of epileptogenic foci from a prior R
MCA stroke, arachnoiditis from chemo, infection or stroke.  A
MRI/MRA was performed to evaluate for new stroke and carotids
for evidence of source.  MRA did show moderately significant
carotid stenosis bilaterally that will require resumption of
Plavix once patient completes chemotherapy.  Head CT was
negative for new bleed or mass.  Patient was started on
ceftriazone, vancomycin and acyclovir for possible infectious
meningitis.  CSF fluid had 4+ PMNs on CSF gram stain and there
was no growth on culture.  HSV PCR and EEG were negative.  For
possible arachnoiditis secondary to intrathecal ara-C, patient
was continued on dexamthasone and then gradually tapered.
Finally, patient was loaded with dilantin and switched over to
keppra at the time of discharge.  From the time of transfer from
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to the discharge day, patient was seizure free and
complained only of improving symptoms of left hand weakness
(thought to be post-ictal re-expression of stroke symptoms per
neurology) and lightheadedness (orthostatics within normal
limits).  Patient was instructed to wait a couple of minutes
before moving after standing up.
.
## Lymphoma: Last chemo [**2134-9-3**] with intrathecal ARA-C and prior
to this hyper-CVAD on [**2134-8-27**]. CSF on [**2134-9-3**] was negative for
malignancy. PET-CT shows no additional areas of abnormal FDG
uptake. PETCT also shows lytic lesions within R illium and L
acetabulum (previously known).  Patient had a porta-cath placed
for chemotherapy [**2134-9-8**] am.  He started CODOX (cytoxan,
decadron, adriamycin, vincristine).  Patient tolerated chemo
very well.
