History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 7518**] is a 78 yo right handed man who presents for
evaluation of confusion.  The history is given both by the
patient and his daughter.  Apparently, the patient lives
predominantly alone.  His daughter recalls speaking to him on
Saturday and he appeared to be his typical self.  This morning,
around 9am she received a phone call from her father- he was
asking for the phone number to his office, something he should
know very well.  She became concerned and he told her that he
was
not feeling well and was lying in bed (also unlike him).  They
hung up the phone and just minutes later, he called back, again
asking the same questions and without recalling that he had just
spoken to her.  This prompted his daughter to go to his home
where she found things in disarray- he had apparently soiled
himself as well as vomited on the floor as well as a nose bleed
and had no cleaned it up.  She is not sure how long things had
been like that.  The patient refused to go to the ED and
requested calling his PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].  Upon hearing this, the PCP
rightfully referred the pt to the ED.

On arrival to the ED, the patient was noted to be extremely
hypoxic (O2 sat 65% off oxygen).  ABG at the time showed mild
bicarb retention and normal COhb. EKG was notable for PACs.  A
head CT was obtained which identifed a large intraventricular
bleed in the left caudate, extending into the ventricular
system.
Neurosurgery was consulted but felt there was no issued for an
acute intervention.  His sats quickly correctly and neurology
was
consulted.

Mr. [**First Name (Titles) 104720**] [**Last Name (Titles) 104721**] feeling "Plunky" that last few hours but
he cannot give a further description of his overall well being
other than feeling fatigued.  His daughter feels his fatigue
predates his presentation, stating he has been a bit more quiet
and down over the past few weeks than he typically is.  He
denies
any recent head injuries or falls.  He reports a mild headache
(0.5/10) which is a central pressure and which appears to be
resolving.   On further neurologic review of systems, the
patient
denied loss of vision, blurred vision, diplopia, dysarthria,
dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus or hearing
difficulty. Denied difficulties producing or comprehending
speech.  Denied focal weakness, numbness, parasthesiae. No bowel
or bladder incontinence or retention. Denied difficulty with
gait.

On general review of systems, the patient denied recent fever or
chills.  No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denied
cough, shortness of breath.  Denied chest pain or tightness,
palpitations.  Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation
or
abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
No
dysuria.  Denied arthralgias or myalgias. Denied rash.

Physical Exam:
Exam changes during the admission:
Patient remained afebrile. Was hypertensive briefly,
particularly on exertion, until antihypertensives added to 170s
at maximum. His oxygen saturation was typically low, often in
80's - he appears to have habituated to this, with some
polycythemia and no symptoms. His neurologic examination is
essentially normal now, with some confusion in the evening on
two nights. His family judge that he is approaching his
cognitive baseline.
