Service:  Purple Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 78-year-old male with
a history of severe MR, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart
failure, who is status post pacemaker, who also has a history
of hypertension, who was started on Coumadin in [**Month (only) 205**] and
presented with melena to his primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was
also noted to have a 10-pound weight loss.  The patient was
evaluated for this and the EGD showed a T3, N1 lesion of his
stomach.  Biopsies were done and a CT scan was also performed
that showed a question of a left lower lobe nodule, which was
reviewed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 175**].  He presented to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for a
planned gastrectomy and for further evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Coronary artery disease.  2. Atrial
fibrillation.  3. Congestive heart failure.  4. Hypertension.
5. Status post cholecystectomy.

MEDICATIONS:  1. Pepcid.  2. Atenolol.  3. Allopurinol.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to penicillin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He was afebrile, vital signs were
stable.  He was thin.  His lungs were clear.  Heart was
regular.  Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended.
Extremities were warm and well perfused.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the operating room
on [**2192-7-27**] where a subtotal gastrectomy and liver biopsy was
performed.  He had a Roux-en-Y reconstruction of his stomach.
The patient was transferred postoperatively to the intensive
care unit for closer monitoring and he did well.  Cardiology
was consulted for pacemaker management which they did and his
pacemaker was returned to [**Location 213**].  The pain service was also
consulted for epidural placement and epidural management,
which again he did well with.  He slowly improved through his
intensive care unit stay and was able to be extubated.  He
required pressor support for low blood pressure and was kept
intubated for that reason.  However he was able to be weaned
from the ventilator and his blood pressure increased due to
the significant volume administered through the operation and
postoperatively.  The patient did have some mild congestive
heart failure and required Lasix for diuresis.

He was slowly started on sips which he tolerated, and was
able to continue on with that.  The epidural was removed and
he continued to do well.  He was advanced on his diet to a
stage II diet, which he was able to tolerate, and his
medications were all crushed.  He was advanced to a stage III
diet after tolerating stage II and again he was able to
tolerate this as well.  He responded well to his diuresis and
his oxygen requirement slowly reduced.  He was transferred to
the floor on postoperative day number seven and continued to
do well.  Physical therapy was consulted at this time and he
was able to get up and ambulate.  He did well with physical
therapy and it was decided that the patient could ultimately
go home with services.  On [**2192-8-4**] he was tolerating a stage
II diet and continued to do well.  His IV fluids were heparin
locked.  He was maintaining good saturation on room air and
it was decided that the patient could be discharged home on
[**2192-8-4**] in stable condition.
