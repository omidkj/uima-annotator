[**Known lastname 94683**], [**Known firstname **]       [**Hospital1 18**] [**Numeric Identifier 94684**]Portable TEE
(Complete) Done [**2179-10-4**] at 1:05:08 PM      FINAL
Age (years): 82 M  Hgt (in): 65
BP (mm Hg): 90/49  Wgt (lb): 240
HR (bpm): 90  BSA (m2): 2.14 m2
Indication: Hypotension. AVR.
Echocardiographic Measurements
Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  45% to 50%  >= 55%
Findings
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis (AVR). AVR
leaflets move normally. Normal AVR gradient. Paravalvular leak.
No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.

PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was monitored by a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 9833**]
throughout the procedure. The patient was under general
anesthesia throughout the procedure. No TEE related
complications. Results were personally reviewed with the MD
caring for the patient.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:
     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesis of the distal inferior and inferior-lateral walls
with LVEF 45-50%. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. No aortic dissection seen. A bioprosthetic
aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis
leaflets appear to move normally. The transaortic gradient is
normal for this prosthesis. A trace paravalvular aortic valve
leak is present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is a small pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Trace paravalvular leak s/p bioprosthetic AVR with
normal leaflet function and gradient. Mildly depressed LV
systolic function. This degree of trivial paravalvular leak is
probably normal at this post-operative stage.
The ICU team caring for the patient was notified of the results
in person at the time of the study.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

[**2179-10-4**] 2:15 PM
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   82 year old man s/p CABG/AVR, now ex-lap for necrotic

   new line
Final Report
CHEST RADIOGRAPH
INDICATION: Status post CABG, status post line placement.
COMPARISON: [**2179-10-4**].
As compared to the previous radiograph, an introduction sheath
has been placed over the right internal jugular vein. The sheath
shows a normal course, there is no evidence of complications,
notably no evidence of pneumothorax. The other monitoring and
support devices are in unchanged position. Unchanged size of the
cardiac silhouette. No newly appeared focal parenchymal
opacities suggesting pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was transferred from [**Hospital **] Med Ctr for AVR/CABG.
During preoperative workup patient was hemodynamically
unstable/developed flash pulmonary edema, continued to have
anginal symptoms and an intra aortic balloon pump was placed
following which the patient developed an ischemic foot, vascular
surgery was consulted. He was brought to the operating room on
[**10-2**] for AVR/CABG.
Post operatively the patient became acidotic with an elevated
lactate, general surgery was consulted and he was brought to the
operating room on [**10-4**] for an open cholecystectomy.
He remained hemodynamically unstable with a worsening acidosis
and despite all efforts at resuscitation the patient expired on
[**10-4**] with the family at his b
