Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC Line placement


History of Present Illness:
 [**Age over 90 **] YO F with CAD, AF (not on anti-coagulation), UTIs and prior
multiloculated parapneumonic effusion presenting with shortness
of breath. She is a very poor historian but reports feeling well
until the day of admission when she developed acute SOB at home.
EMS was called and brought the patient into the ED. She reports
a minor non-productive cough and denies sob, fever, chills, or
dysuria. Her daughter does report that her birthday was the
other day and she has been eating out alot. Also, with the
recent warm weather, she has been drinking alot of water.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 104.8 rectally 87 101/57 26 88% on
RA. Exam was notable for a very tachypneic woman in severe
respiratory distress. Her lung exam was notable for wheezing
with decreased air movement. Labs were notable for WBC to 21,
lactate 2.2. CXR was without clear infiltrate or effusion. EKG
showed RBBB and LAD which was c/w priors. She was placed on
non-invasive BiPAP 15/5 FiO2 100%. The patient was given
methylpred 125mg IV once, nebs, APAP and ibuprofen, levofloxacin
750mg IV and ceftriaxone 1g IV. 20g and an 18g PIV were placed.
VS prior to transfer were: HR 103 138/70s 20 98%; however just
prior to transport the patient's SBP dropped to the 70s. She was
taken off BiPap and given gentle fluids with recovery of her SBP
to the 90s and O2 sat 96% on 4L NC.
.
Upon arrival to the MICU, the patient reports feeling well aside
from some difficult breathing and feeling as though something is
"on" her chest.

GU: no foley
Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or

Pertinent Results:
LOWER EXTREMITY U/S:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the left lower extremity.
.
CTA CHEST:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Cicatricial atelectasis in the right lower lobe is not
concerning for
malignancy.
3. New left lower lobe consolidation.
4. Interval decrease in size of segment VIII liver cyst.
.
ECHO:
Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic
function. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2190-6-30**], the severity of mitral regurgitation
and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure are lower.
.
CT head [**2191-7-6**]: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or large
hypodensity to suggest infarct. If continued concern for carotid
dissection or skull base lesion to explain pupil asymmetry,
consider MRI andMRA to better evaluate, if there are no
contraindications.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]yo F with AFib not on anticoagulation who presents with SOB
and hypoxia. Initially requiring BiPAP, saturating well on RA at
the time of discharge. She was treated for for CAP with h/o
MRSA, E. coli UTI, and cellulitis.
.
#HYPOTENSION: She was initially hypotensive with an elevated
lactate and admitted to the ICU for further management. Given
her fever and leukocytosis there was strong suspicion that this
was a distributive process with likely either urinary vs
pulmonary source. She was started on broad spectrum intravenous
antibiotics. Her hypotension was fluid responsive and she did
not require vasopressors. She was transfered to the medical
floor on HD 3 where she was hemodynamically stable.
.
# URINARY TRACT INFECTION: She was found to have a fever,
leukocytosis, and urine culture growing >100,000 colonies of
E.Coli. She was initially on broad spectum IV therapy in the
MICU. When she came to the medical floor, she was started on po
levofloxacin. The E. coli was sensative to ciprofloxacin so she
was continued on levofloxacin for coverage of UTI and PNA. Will
be discharged on levofloxacin for 5 more days for her UTI as
given her age and having had a foley in the MICU, she should be
covered for a complicated UTI.
.
#Community Acquired Pneuonia: She presented with a new oxygen
requirement, cough, and fever. She was evaluated with a CTA
chest that showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism but revealed
consolidation. She was given broad spectrum antibiotics for
pneumonia. There was a LLL infiltrate present on both CT and
CXR. As noted above, she was started on po levofloxacin when she
came to the medical floor, and this was chosen so that one
antibiotic could cover both community-aquired pneumonia and her
UTI. IV vancomycin was continued for LLE cellulitis as well as
for treatment of PNA given her need for ICU admission and
history of MRSA PNA in the past. She was unable to provide a
sputum to determine whether or not it was still present. Given
this history, her iniital need for ICU level of care, and her
improvement on vacomycin, the decision was made to continue
vancomycin on the medical floor and for 5 more days.
.
#L LOWER EXTEMITY SWELLING/ERYTHEMA: She was evaluated with
lower extremity ultrasound, which revealed no evidence of DVT.
The redness, swelling, tenderness, and warmth of her left ankle
was concerning for cellulitis. The degree and extent of redness
and swelling improved with vancomycin. She will be discharged
with vancomycin for 5 days to complete a 10 day course of
therapy for cellulitis.
