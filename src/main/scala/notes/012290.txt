Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11495**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal distention and pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IJ line placement
Swan-ganz catheter placement
Arterial line placement
Dental extraction

History of Present Illness:
(History limited by pain, partially from prior notes)

64 y.o. female with multiple medical issues including SLE, AS
and MR with resulting CHF presents with increased abdominal
distention from baseline, and abdominal pain x 1 week.  The
patient was recently admitted in [**12-6**] and [**1-5**] with CHF
exacerbations presenting as abdominal distention and pain.  On
her last admission a RUQ U/S demonstrated a question of
perihepatic fluid collection.  A CT ABD demonstrated thickened
GB wall and sludge.  The abdominal distention and U/S findings
were thought to be secondary to right-sided failure secondary to
valvular disease.  She was supposed to be evaluated for AVR/MVR
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 36737**] but apparently did not obtain outpatient dental
extractions.

AXR [**2-18**]:  Nonspecific bowel gas pattern, without definite
obstruction.

CXR [**2-19**]:  Slight worsening of congestive heart failure.
Worsening patchy and linear basilar lung opacities, which may
relate to atelectasis. Underlying pneumonia is not excluded in
the appropriate clinical setting.

Transthoracic echo [**2-19**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is mild global left ventricular
hypokinesis.  [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may
be more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
with septal dyskinesis. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There
is moderate aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets and supporting structures are
moderately thickened. There is mild mitral stenosis (?functional
from mitral annulus). Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of
mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
Severe [4+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is severe pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2164-12-25**],
left ventricular systolic fuction is more depressed (septal
dysnchrony more apparent) The severity of aortic stenosis amd
mitral regurgitation are similar.

CXR [**2-20**]:  1) No interval change in position of Swan-Ganz
catheter tip.
2) Interval improvement in cardiopulmonary status.
3) Persistent/slightly worsened bibasilar atelectasis.
4) Patchy perihilar infiltrates persist unchanged.

EKG [**2-21**]:  Uncertain supraventricular tachycardia which could be
non-paroxysmal junctional tachycardia versus other paroxysmal
supraventricular tachycardia mechanism. Cannot exclude subtle
atrial flutter with 2:1 conduction. Underlying left ventricular
intraventricular conduction delay with left axis deviation. Left
ventricular hypertrophy by voltage. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2165-2-19**] which showed sinus tachycardia at about the
same rate, supraventricular tachy-arrhythmia is new.

RUQ US [**2-22**]:  There is evidence of right ventricular dysfunction
on this examination. Mild increased echogenicity of the liver.
Some loculated perihepatic fluid is seen as before. A
thick-walled gallbladder containing debris and stones, thought
to be manifestation of hypoproteinemia and adjacent ascites
rather than cholecystitis. Clinical correlation is recommended.

CXR [**2-25**]:  Overall improvement in degree of congestive heart
failure, but there is a worsening area of opacity in the left
lower lobe. Although possibly due to asymmetrical pulmonary
edema, superimposed process such as aspiration or infectious
pneumonia should be considered in the appropriate clinical
setting.
