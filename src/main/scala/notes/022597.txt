Imaging:
[**2143-1-9**] Colonoscopy: Blood was seen throughout the whole colon.
There was blood into the terminal ileum to 10cm. Diverticulosis
of the Right and left colon. Otherwise normal colonoscopy to
cecum.
[**2143-1-9**] EGD: Normal mucosa in the esophagus. Normal mucosa in
the stomach.
Normal mucosa in the duodenum. Otherwise normal EGD to third
part of the duodenum.
[**2143-1-11**] Colonoscopy: Blood in the whole colon. Diverticulosis of
the cecum and right colon. Normal mucosa in the terminal ileum.
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum.
[**2143-1-9**] Meckel's Scan: negative
[**2143-1-9**] CTA abdomen/pelvis: 1. No acute hemorrhage identified.
2. Bilateral ovarian cysts, likely physiologic. 3. Small
hypodensity in the left lobe, too small to characterize.
[**2143-1-11**] Tagged RBC scan: No evidence of GI bleed during the time
of study.
[**2143-1-12**] repeat CTA: No acute hemorrhage or source of bleeding
identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
23yo F with no significant PMH admitted for BRBPR of unclear
etiology, likely lower GI bleed.

Active Issues:
# BRBPR: Patient presented with bright red blood per rectum as
well as dark stools X1 day. She continued to have several bloody
bowel movements during the hospitalization. GI was consulted,
and she was made NPO for a colonoscopy the day after admission.
Stool studies negative. Hematocrits were trended.  Her hct on
admission was 29.6 (baseline unknown) but fell to 22.4 with some
associated dizziness and she was transfused 1 unit of blood.
Colonoscopy showed blood throughout the colon and 10cm into the
terminal ileum. Diverticulosis was seen in the right and left
colon, but the colon was otherwise normal, no active bleeding
identified. Patient was transferred to the MICU for oversedation
and active GI bleed of unknown source, with a plan for EGD. In
the MICU, she gradually came out of sedated state an
