ECG: sinus tach, 136 bpm, RAD, IVCD, delayed RWP, no ST-T
changes
.
CXR: Opacification of the left lung base and mid zone and mild
opacification of the right lung base.  These findings are
concerning for pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 50M h/o DM, HTN, COPD, OSA, Bipolar disorder presenting
with SOB and cough -> multilobar PNA.
.
# Respiratory failure: Intubated for hypoxia, AMS. Noted to have
LLL infiltrate on CXR suggesting PNA (also possible RLL
infiltrate), supported by leukocytosis and fever. [**Month (only) 116**] have had
recent PNA per report, unclear if treated effectively. Pt had
required intubation by EMS to support airway.  Pt underwent
bronchcoscopy which revealed no obstructive lesion. Pt r'd/o MI
with serial negative cardiac enzymes, sputum cultures + for
H.flu.  Pt had originally been started on vanc/flagyl for broad
spectrum, but switched to levo once cultures returned.  Records
indicated severe OHS with chronically elevate pCO2 60-70s and
low O2 sats. Extubated [**6-8**] directly to BiPAP, bridged to NC O2,
which was titrated down to RA by the day of discharge, w/ O2
sats of 98%.  Pts WBC down from 15 to 11 (still on steroids) and
bandemia has resolved.

- continue levoflox for CAP (day [**8-3**])
- combivent combivent nebs PRN
- continue prednisone taper, due for 20mg x 2 more days daily-to
now 10mg daily x 4
- continue progesterone for resp stim in OHS as given by home
meds

replaced with free H2O boluses. Follow Na [**Hospital1 **].  Has since
resolved to normal levels.  d/c'd lasix.
.
# Altered mental status: Most likely due to hypoxemia and
hypercarbia. No evidence of illicit substance ingestion as serum
and urine tox screens negative except for benzos. CNS infection
also on the differential given fevers and mental status changes
but less likely now that improved. No concerning findings on
neuro exam post-extubation.
.
# Cardiovascular: Low suspicion for ACS and r/o MI with serial
negative cardiac enzymes. Risk factors include DM2, smoking, and
HTN. Echocardiogram preserved. ASA, metoprolol, statin.
.

Prednisone per above. Restarted progesterone per home regimen.
