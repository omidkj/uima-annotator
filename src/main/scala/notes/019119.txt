Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2712**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB/COPD


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Mechanical Intubation
Central line placement right femoral and right IJ
Arctic Sun s/p PEA arrest


History of Present Illness:
56 yo F with PMH COPD and asthma who presented to OSH with
increasing SOB x 3d. Per family, despite report of SOB, she was
doing relatively fine until the day of admission, when she
developed N/V/D. Daughter came over to help transport pt to ED
and says at that time she was c/o feeling like she "couldn't
breathe" and having sweats. Called paramedics who took patient
to OSH. At OSH, pt was somnolent and minimally responsive. She
was trialed on BiPAP and then intubated for resp distress and
airway protection [**1-6**] AMS. After intubation her pressures
dropped to 80s systolic and she was started on a levophed drip
via EJ peripheral line and sedated with propofol. A CXR showed a
LLL consolidation, so she was started on azithro/CTX and
solumedrol and given 2L IVF. Labs significant for Na 141, K 3.8,
bicarb 31, AG 9, Cr 1.3, lactate 2.2, LFTs WNL, INR 1.04, WBC
25.5, Hct 41.9, Plt 218She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

At [**Hospital1 18**] she triggered on arrival for O2 sat 65%, though this
was thought to be inaccurate pulse ox and first vital set in ED
records noted to be 137, 68/55, 16, 99% ETT. Labs significant
for WBC 18.8 (84% PMN), Hct 38.3, plats 203, Cr 1.6 (CHEM-7
otherwise unremarkable). U/A neg with 23 hyaline casts. Patient
had no prior records and baselines unknown. CXR showed LLL PNA.
She was broadened to vanc/cefepime and the propofol was weaned.
A right IJ was placed and she was continued on levophed (at 4.5
upon transfer) with fentanyl/midaz for sedation. Pressures
improved to 92/57 with pressors. She was tachy to 130s on
arrival. On transfer, HR 115, 92/57, 96% on CMV. She was sent
for CTA to r/o PE on way up to MICU floor.

On arrival to MICU, VS 99.5, 111, 88/55, 16, 100% CMV. Shortly
after arrival to MICU, pressures dropped and pt became
pulseless. Pt noted to have high auto-PEEP of 23 prior to
arrest. A code blue was called and chest compressions started
immediately. Rhythm check was performed and pt noted to be in
PEA arrest. Pt was coded for approx. 10 minutes after which time
pulse was regained. During that time period she received 2 amps
of epi, 2 amps of bicarb, and started on an epi drip. Labs prior
to arrival in MICU revealed unremarkable electrolyte panel.
Decreased BS noted on left both before and during code, likely
[**1-6**] to LLL PNA. Pt was very difficult to ventilate and there was
concern for large PTX, however, this was not seen on CXR. CTA
was negative for PE. Echo performed at bedside during code did
not show pericardial effusion. Repeat echo after code showed
global hypokinesis. Etiology was never identified but most
likely explanation for arrest was thought to be [**1-6**] worsened
resp failure and subsequent acidosis. Immediately after code we
were unable to assess mental status since pt was already heavily
sedated. Arctic Sun protocol was initiated and pt was paralyzed
with cisatrocurium. She was on three pressors after
stabilization - levophed, epinephrine, and neosynephrine with
pressure 102/59, HR 105, 100% on CMV.
