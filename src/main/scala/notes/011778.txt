He was transferred to the MICU after repeated episodes of severe
SOB, intially responsive to IV lasix, now requiring BIPAP for
hypoxia.

Brief Hospital Course:
1.Pulm/SOB: Pt returned to the hospital after being discharged
last week after COPD flare with mild amt of CHF.  He felt well
for a few days, but returns with worsening SOB as well as new
cough and wheezing.  He had been on a steroid taper and was
almost tapered off.  Unclear whether he was taking his inhalers
as directed at home.  This admit, initially found to have
probable LLL PNA and small COPD exacerbation.  Intially treated
him with azithromycin and ceftriaxone for CAP.  Sputum cx
ordered, but pt unable to produce adequate specimen.  He did
have WBC ct of 34 on admission.
    Patient required NRB for O2 support, with intermittent
BIPAP. Chest CT was felt to be c/w aspiration PNA. He was given
nebs as well as steriods given COPD history. Because of
increasing hypoxia he was diuresed, however, this diuresis was
complicated by rising creatinine. His antibiotic regimen was
changes to Vanc/Zosyn because of his clinical worsening.
*
2.CRI: Initially at his baseline of 1.9, but his Cr continued to
rise in the setting of diuresis. After consultation with
Nephrology and numerous family meetings, it was felt per
patient's family that there was no role for hemodialysis.
*
3.DM: Pt on 48 units NPH qam and glyburide qpm at home. Glucose
low at home and here, likely secondary to not eating but
continuing his normal meds. We held his glyburide and continued
NPH with HISS at meals.
*
4.MAT/CHF: The patient was determined to be intermittently in
MAT on his last admission. He again had multiple episodes of MAT
on tele while here, which was felt to possibly causing CHF and
worsened hypoxia.  He was also felt to have a component of
diastolic dysfunction as well. Numerous medication changes were
made to control his rate while maintaing appropriate BP,
including afterload reduction, IV diltiazem, and metoprolol.
*
5.Troponin elevation: Had small elevation in troponin, with no
change in CK or MB values.  Likely demand related with his
hypertension and MAT in the setting of worsening renal failure.
He was continued on ASA.
*
6.Goals of Care: After numerous family meetings with a Cantonese
interpreter, the patient was made DNR/DNI during his MICU
course. Given patient's clinical deterioration, worsening
hypoxia, and multisysten organ failure, it was felt that comfort
should be the goals of care. Antibiotics were held and the
patient was placed on prn Morphine and Ativan. At the 3:10pm, he
was noted to be noresponsive to pain, had fixed & dilated
pupils, and was without spontaneous respirations or pulse and
was declared dead. The family declined post-mortem. Immediate
cause of death was felt to be mulifocal pneumonia.
