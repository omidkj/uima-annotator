palpitations, cough

History of Present Illness:
This 54 year old white male is status post instrumentation of a
urethral stricture in [**2176-7-18**] when he underwent
cystoscopy and urethral dilatation for hematuria. Since that
time he has had some increased lethargy and generalized
weakness, weight loss, night sweats. He is also complaining of
more recent onset of a cough productive of clear, brown sputum
and chills for the last 1 week. These symptoms have also been
associated with chest congestion. He denies sick contacts,
recent travel, sore throat, myalgias, or rhinorrhea. As part of
the workup, he had elevated ESR and CRP, and blood cultures
drawn, which today resulted in positive results in both aerobic
bottle and anaerobic bottle for enterococcus, no sensitivities
yet available. He was referred to the ED for admission and
further workup of suspected endocarditis. He denies any history
of heart disease including valvular abnormalities.
.
In the ED a central line was placed and Levophed was started due
to systolic BP's around 90. He was noted to be febrile to 101.1
which came down to 98.8 without intervention. Bedside echo did
not show pericardial effusion and valves were not well
visualized.

Pertinent Results:
[**2176-9-1**]
URINE CULTURE: Enterococcus faecalis >100,000 cfu/mL
Antibiotic
Atrius Blood cx grew enterococcus
ECHO [**2175-11-21**]: Mild prolapse of the posterior leaflet with
valvular vegetation and moderate-severe mitral regurgitation. No
abscess visualized. Hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic
function.  .
EKG: AF/flutter 104 (old), upsloping sub-mm [****]

TEE [**2176-11-25**]:
PRE-BYPASS:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right
atrium.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %).
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending, arch, and
descending levels are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. There is
an echodensity on the noncoronary cusp seen in both short & long
axes is most consistent with the appearance of a fibroelastoma
although an endocarditic related mass can not be ruled out.
The mitral valve leaflets are myxomatous. There is bileaflet
flail versus destruction from endocarditis. The anterior leaflet
may be torn. Torn mitral chordae/masses are present at both
leaflet tips. An eccentric, jet of Severe (4+) mitral
regurgitation is seen (Coanda effect).
There is a left pleural effusion
There is no pericardial effusion.
POSTBYPASS:
The patient is inituially AV paced and then atrially paced and
is on a norepinephrine infusion. There is a well seated
bioprosthetic valve in the mitral position. The leaflets appear
to be moving normally. There is trace valvular MR and can not
completely rule out a jet of trace perivalvular MR. The maximum
gradient through the valve is 12mmHg with a mean of 4 mmHg at a
cardiac output in the 7.5 liter/minute range. The remaining
valves are unchanged. The RV function is unchanged. The LV
function is improved with an estimated EF of 55%. The septum is
dyssynchronous consistent with bundle branch block seen on ECG.
The aorta remains intact after decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
He was referred to Cardiac Surgery and on [**11-25**]. He weaned from
bypass on Levophed and Propofol and was transferred to the CVICU
in stable condition.  He was extubated later that day, but
remained pressor dependent for several days.  He was transferred
to the floor on POD# 4 after weaning from pressor support.

His activity level was increased and he was gently diuresed
toward his preop weight. OR tissue cultures grew enterococcus as
preop and Infectious disease recommended a  6 week course of IV
gentamicin and ampicillin. Beta blockade and coumadin wre begun.
 A PICC line was placed. Chest tubes and pacing wires removed
per protocol.

He continued to make good progress and was cleared for discharge
to [**Hospital 105159**] rehab in [**Hospital1 **] on [**2176-12-3**].

 Arrangements were made for ID followup after discharge as welll
as with surgery and his cardiologist.
