ADDENDUM:  On the evening prior to discharge, after receiving
two units of packed red blood cells, the patient subsequently
developed pulmonary edema with an oxygen saturation of 89% on
two liters.  He was also coughing up pink frothy sputum and
had crackles one-half the way up on his pulmonary
examination.  He was given intravenous Lasix 20 mg times
three, with diuresis of approximately 2,100 cc of urine, with
resolution of his pulmonary symptoms.

It was determined that the patient would benefit from oral
Lasix 20 mg daily, which should be added to his discharge
medication regimen.  He will also be discharged on
ciprofloxacin 250 mg orally every other day for urinary tract
infection prophylaxis given his incontinence and Foley
catheter use.
