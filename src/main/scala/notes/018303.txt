controlled blood pressure, DM2 (last HbgA1c 9.5% in [**11-4**]), OSA
who presented to the ED with complains of sudden onset SOB. The
patient has had prior hospitalizations for acute pulmonary edema
in the setting of hypertensive urgency. He is followed by Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 437**], with a recent improvement in cardiac function, with now
improved systolic function (20% in [**2098**] to 50%), but dialated
and hypertrophied ventricles. He was seen by his PCP one day
prior to presentation with complaints of 3 days of
conjunctivitis and rhinorhea with a slight, non-productive

placed on BIPAP, was started on a nitro gtt, given ASA 325mg,
and was 100mg IV lasix, to which he put out 400cc of urine.
Cardiology was consulted in the ED, but felt that given recent
URI symptoms, a MICU admission would be more appropriate. The
patient was admitted to the MICU for further manegment.

or dysuria. He has not had any worsening LE swelling, orthopnea,

CHEST X-RAY [**2119-2-8**] - FINDINGS: There is mild cephalization of
the pulmonary vasculature and
prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature. There are no
definite focal consolidations. Study is slightly limited by
motion blurring. There is moderate cardiomegaly, stable. No
pneumothorax or pleural effusion is present.


Brief Hospital Course:
# HTN: He has had multiple recent hospitalizations for similar
systolic blood pressures.  Initially he required a nitro drip to
control his blood pressure, however with improvement in his
blood pressure the drip was discontinued and, adjustments were
made to his home medications for optimum blood pressure control.
His lisinopril and carvedilol were at supratherapeutic doses
without additional benefit in blood pressure control thus his
carvedilol was decreased to 25 mg twice a day and lisinopril was
decreased to 40mg daily. His lasix was increased to 40mg twice a
day and his clonidine was increased to 0.3mg/q24 he once a week.
Amlodipine 10mg daily was added to his regimen. Outpatient
evaluation for obstructive sleep apnea is recommended, as well
as addition of spironolactone by his primary care doctor if
there are no contraindications.

# Hypoxia: Patient had pulmonary edema on CXR on admission.   He
was initially placed on non-rebreather with good oxygen
saturation.  In the ED, he also recieved IV furosemide for
diuresis.  On arrival to the ICU, he was further diuresed and
weaned to oxygen by nasal canula without difficulty.  He had no
oxygen requirement by the second hospital day.  He was
discharged on an increased diuretic dose.

# Dilated Cardiomyopthy with CHF: Mr. [**Known lastname 805**] has a
long-standing daignosis of dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 51%) in
10/[**2118**].  This was felt to be contributing to his hypoxia in
setting of hypertensive urgency.  He was diuresed as above.
Continue carvedilol and lisinopril.    He is to follow-up with
his outpatient cardiologist after discharge.

# Chest Pain:  Mr. [**Known lastname 805**]' presented with chest pain in
setting of hypertensive urgency.  EKG unchanged, noted to have
recent exercise MIBI without ischemia.  Cardiac enzymes were
cycled and were negative.  He was continued on his aspirin,
statin, beta blocker.

# DM2:  He was hypoglycemic in the early mornings and in the mid
afternoons. This was likely due to his NPH dosing. His NPH am
dose was decreased to 26 units and his pm dose was decreased to
18 units. Further titration should be continued as an
outpatient.
