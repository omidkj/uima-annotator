Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1943**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
57 year old gentleman with trachoeobronchomalasia s/p y-stent
placement, multiple prior admissions to ICU, p/w SOB x3 days.
The patient had a sudden onset of SOB at night with subsequent
increased difficulty breathing and increased sputum production
for the next several days. He denies any fever, +/- chills, no
lightheadedness or dizziness. No CP. He states that he sleeps
semi-upright in bed and can not lie flat [**2-15**] sleep apnea. In
addition, he endorses PND which he also attibutes to sleep
apnea. He denies any lower ext edema in the past week. Per rehab
notes, he was started on Unasyn today. The patient notes that he
now feels significantly better that on arrival the the ED.

Of note, he was recently discharged on [**11-1**] after a short
admission for tracheostomy removal, stoma revision, and T-tube
placement. These procedures were performed as patient had not
tolerated "red-cap" and was noted to have malacia proximal to
y-stent. In addition, he had an admission in [**9-/2168**] for y-stent
placement which was complicated by renal failure and pulmonary
edema requiring PPV. He was discharged on Vancomycin, Cipro and
Cefepime with an unclear course.

Review of systems is otherwise negative.

In the emergency department, initial vitals were T98.3, 73,
118/48, 20-25, 98% 4L NC. The patient was found to be
rhonchorous on exam with acessory muscule use. CXR was performed
and was notable for retrocardiac opacity. Labs were significant
for K 5.2 and BNP of 1700 (10,000 on last admit). EKG with no
significant changes. D-dimer was positive at 1400. The patient
was initially put on NRB, but was able to be weaned to 2 L NC.
The patient was also noted to have secretions, blood cultures
were sent and was started on Vanc/Zosyn empirically. The patient
was evaluated by Interventional Pulmonology, who thought that
it's unlikely stent plugging if no lobar collapse seen on CXR,
may be more associated w/ secretions.

Vanc Level [**11-25**]: 32 (note this was taken ~3.5 hrs before next
q12 dose)

EKG ON ADMISSION:
Sinus rhythm. Non-specific intraventricular conduction delay.
Prominent limb lead QRS voltage suggests left ventricular
hypertrophy. Non-specific low amplitude T waves in the limb
leads. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2168-9-13**] QRS change in
lead V3 could be positional.

CXR ON ADMISSION: PA AND LATERAL: Low lung volumes limit
evaluation of the lungs. Bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis is
noted. There is no evidence of pneumonia or congestive heart
failure. The heart is enlarged. The aortic contour is not well
seen; however, mildly tortuous. IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly with no
evidence of pneumonia or congestive heart failure.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. [**Hospital 16486**] Healthcare Associated: Patient admitted with recent h/o
both MRSA and Zosyn-resistant PNA as well as difficulty clearing
secretions due to y-stents. Admitted to ICU afebrile,
normotensive but with respiratory distress and hypoxia requiring
non-rebreather. CXR with retrocardiac opacity atelectesis vs
consolidation. History of pulmonary edema but CXR clear, no LE
edema, no JVD, BNP of 657 vs 10,000 on prior admission. No
evidence of lobar collapse on CXR. D-dimer elevated but low
clinical suspicion for PE. Patient was started on Vanc, Levo and
Meropenem based on prior sensitivities. The patient was given
mucomyst IH, guaifenisin and regular nebulizer treatments, as
well as frequent suctioning. Over the next day dyspnea
significantly improved and patient was weaned down to room air.
Bronchoscopy [**11-22**] showed no acute problems with his y-stent.
Sputum cultures grew out overwhelming proteus which was
cefepime-sensitive but could not rule out other organisms. He
was continued on full 8-day course of antibiotics for HAP
consisting of vanc, cefepime and levofloxacin. Vancomycin levels
were adjusted twice for changing renal clearance. Dose on
discharge 1250mg q24 hours.

Antibiotic Course:
-Levofloxacin: [**Date range (1) 83204**]
-Vancomycin: [**Date range (1) 83204**]
-Meropenum: [**Date range (1) 83205**] (switched to cefepime)
-Cefepime: [**Date range (1) 81061**]

2. Blood Pressures: Initially hypertensive consistent with
patient's baseline. Hypertension was controlled with patient's
home regimen of hydralazine, isordil, metoprolol and amlodipine.
The patient was noted to be transiently hypotensive on [**11-21**]
with SBP in 90s and decreased urine output. However, his mental
status remained normal, he remained otherwise hemodynamically
stable and responded well to IVF. Anti-hypertensive medications
were held in the context of relative hypotension and then
restarted gradually with good effect. His BPs remained normal
across the remainder of his hospitalization.

3. Acute Kidney Injury: Patient was admitted with a creatinine
of 2.2 versus a baseline from [**2168-7-13**] of ~1.0. His creatinine
resolved rapidly with treatment with IVF and was 1.1 at the time
of discharge.

4. Atrial Fibrillation: Controlled on metoprolol. Aspirin was
continued.

5. DM: Blood sugars were controlled with glargine and an insulin
sliding scale.

6. OSA: The patient's tracheostomy was uncapped at night to
allow for unobstructed breathing.
