INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.


LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D
images. Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size. Mild
global LV
hypokinesis. Mildly depressed LVEF.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include:
basal anterior
- hypo; mid anterior - hypo; basal anteroseptal - hypo; mid
anteroseptal -
hypo; basal inferoseptal - hypo; mid inferoseptal - hypo; basal
inferior -
hypo; mid inferior - hypo; basal inferolateral - hypo; mid
inferolateral -
hypo; basal anterolateral - hypo; mid anterolateral - hypo;
anterior apex -
hypo; septal apex - hypo; inferior apex - hypo; lateral apex -
hypo; apex -
hypo;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Borderline normal RV systolic function.

AORTA: Focal calcifications in aortic root. Focal calcifications
in ascending
aorta. Normal descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in
descending aorta.
Focal calcifications in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Severely
thickened/deformed aortic
valve leaflets. Moderate AS. Mild to moderate ([**12-6**]+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular
calcification. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.


PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the
for the
patient.

Conclusions:
PRE-CPB No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is
normal. There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis.
Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed. Right
ventricular systolic
function is borderline normal. There are simple atheroma in the
descending
thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The
aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is moderate
aortic valve
stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**12-6**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

POST-CPB Patient is receiving epinephrine by infusion. Normal
right
ventricular systolic function. Left ventricle with septal
"bounce" consistent
with ventricular pacing. Overall systolic function is slightly
improved from
pre-CPB. Bioprosthesis in aortic valve position is well seated
and displays
normal leaflet function. There is trace valvular AI. No other
changes from
pre-CPB.

Brief Hospital Course:
The pt. was admitted on [**2157-5-1**] to the MICU and intubated for
respiratory distress and profound acidosis.  He was on Levophed
for hypotension and had bacteremia and sepsis.  His pneumonia
was treated with Ceftriaxone and Azythromycin and was on Levo
for quite some time.  He had an echo on admission which revealed
an EF of 55% and no wall motion abnormality.  He eventually had
a NSTEMI and refused cardiac cath.  He eventually agreed and
underwent cardiac cath on [**2157-5-13**] which revealed: 70%LM stenosis,
prox 80%LAD, 50% [**Date Range **] 1, 80% [**Date Range **] 2, 90% prox LCX, 100% L PDA,
mod. AS with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.9 cm2 and a peak gradient of 30mmHg,
and [**12-6**]+MR.  Cardiac surgery was consulted and he needed to wait
for surgery until he was off Plavix for 5 days, and he had 2
teeth extracted.
On [**2157-6-1**] he had a CABGx4(LIMA->LAD, SVG->PDA, [**Date Range **], and
OM)/AVR w/ 23mm Magna Pericardial valve.  The cross clamp time
was 136 mins. and total bypass time was 166 mins. He tolerated
the procedure well and was transferred to the CSRU on Epi,
Nitro, and Propofol.  He was agitated and followed by psychiatry
who recommended Haldol.  He was extubated on POD#1 and had his
chest tubes d/c'd on POD#3.  His epicardial pacing wires were
d/c'd on POD#3 and he was weaned off Levophed.  He was
transferred to the floor on POD#4 and continued to progress.  He
remained in the hospital for the next 3 weeks to have his
sternum heal as he will be released to a homeless shelter and
will need to be completely independen
