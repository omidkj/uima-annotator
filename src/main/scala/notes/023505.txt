Chief Complaint:
Infected lower extremity ulcer

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Percutaneous tracheostomy placement


History of Present Illness:
CC: Respiratory failure
.
HPI: The patient was initially admitted to OSH for treatment of
RLE ulcers from venous stasis/arterial insufficiency. The
patient was intended to have fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass, but the ulcers
became infected with MRSA and the patient was taken to the OR at
the OSH for debridement. The patient was then stabilized and
transferred to rehab on a regimen of vanc/zosyn/cipro. An MRI
showed no evidence of osteo, but MRA showed minimal inflow to
RLE with SFA occlusion. At the rehab center, the patient
experienced increasing pain and erythema at the RLE site, and
was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further vascular workup. The
patient was being monitored and worked up by vascular surgery
when urine output began to drop and creatinine bumped from 1.4
--> 2.2, coincident with a fever to 103.3. The patient had no
hypotensive episodes. A renal consult was obtained, which
suggested ATN vs AIN as a diagnosis, possibly precipitated by
sepsis or worsening CHF. The patient was noted to be in fluid
overload by the renal team. They finally settled on the
diagnosis of non-oliguric ATN. A goal of [**2-4**] L diuresis per day
was set, and easily met using lasix. Unfortunately, the patient
then became oversedated on her opiates, with some resolution
with narcan, then transferred to the SICU for BiPAP and
observation of respiratory status. When her respiratory status
had improved sufficiently, she was transferred to the medical
floor for further care.
.
Pt then became unarousable on the evening of [**8-24**] pt became
unarousable, partially responded to Narcan. Pt was transferred
to MICU for decreased respiratory drive and unarousability. Pt
was placed briefly on a Narcan drip, then weaned off with good
respiratory drive. Pt initially had a Cr bump with this episode,
Cr has been fluctuating since. Have been trying to get patient
in net negative fluid balance with Lasix, but has been
difficult, and Cr has stayed above the level of 3.1, which was
her Cr when she came out of the SICU.
.
This AM the patient is resting comfortably and breathing with
good O2 sats on only 2L by NC, which is a vast improvement over
earlier in her hospital course. No complaints, though she notes
that her pain level is higher than before, she understands our
reticence to use narcotics to treat it. No F/C, no N/V, no CP,
mild SOB.
.
At 5 am on [**8-27**], the patient became acutely hypoxic and had
respiratiory failure with diffuse wheezing and poor air
movement, with evidence of extreme respiratory fatigue prompting
a MICU evaluation and subsequent call for anesthesia to intubate
stat in on the floor before transfer. A Stat cxr was obtained
which showed acute exacerbation of heart failure. She was given
120 mg of Lasix, and was intubated and put on assist control
ventilation. An ECG was obtained which showed diffuse low
voltages, a leftward axis, late R wave progression, normal
intervals and no evidence of ischemia. Cardiac markers were sent
as well as a sputum sample for gram stain and culture.

Brief Hospital Course:
53F with severe PVD and infected RLE ulcer transferred from
OSH/rehab for vascular eval. Complicated ICU course complicated
by non-oliguric ARF and respiratory depression [**3-7**] narcotics -
transferred to floor for further management of her infected foot
ulcers found to be in acute respiratory failure intubated and
sedated and transferred back to the unit.
.
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory failure - In unit pt extubated but
required re-intubation c respiratory failure believed due to CHF
exacerbation. Pt then difficult to wean from vent. Multiple
factors believed to be involved including large pleural
effusions that were noted on CT, respiratory muscle weakness
(NIF of approx -20), pulmonary edema, and obstruction [**3-7**] large
body habitus. Multiple attempts made to diurese pt c approx 1L
taken off everyday for one week. The aggressiveness of diuresis
had to be slowed last week as pt became hypotensive and
intermitently febrile. During this time internentional pulmonary
service gave pt a percutaneous tracheostomy. Once hypotension
relieved pt noted to have large pleural effusuions bilat on CT.
Interventional pulmonary service tapped one of the L effusion
and removed approx 600cc of transudative fluid. Pt's respiratory
status improved significantly after this tap and c signif
diuresis of nearly 1-2L per day via lasix drip this week. Able
to wean pt from AC to PS and pt tolerated trial of 5/0 this am
for appox 4 hours. Pt then tolerated trach mask.  Speech
following pt and she tolerated a passy muir valve yesterday am x
30 mins.

2. Sepsis: Pt c intermitent fevers, hypotension c SBPs in 90s
last week. Bld cx initially grew out staph and pt treated c
vancomycin. This stopped when believed [**3-7**] contamination as
staph speciated as coag negative. Pt received TTE and TEE that
showed no signs of infective endocarditis. Vascular surgery
evaluated her RLE wound and felt there were no signs of
cellulitis or anything contributing to a more systemic process.
A line pulled and grew coag negative staph, pt then placed on
vancomycin. Pt continued to spike low grade fevers and remained
hypotensive c SBPs in low 100s. R IJ then pulled and grew
Enterococcus, bld cx from same day grew VRE and so pt placed on
linezolid 4 days ago. Once pt placed on linezolid fevers
resolved and no episodes of hypotension.

3. RLE wound: vascular surgery followed. No evidence of
osteomyelitis/fasciitis on previous MRI. Wound culture growing
stenotrophomonas. This is sensitive to Bactrim, have started and
vascular indicates abx should be continued until wound improves.
They are wary to perform angiography on the leg given pt's
kindey function. Once this improves they plan to image the leg
and determine vascular supply to area.  In meantime, they
recommend continuing wet-to-dry dressing changes [**Hospital1 **].

.
4. ARF: Pt developed ARF amid fevers, no clear evidence of
hypotensive episode. Renal service followed the patient and
indicated they suspect ATN. With aggressive fluids initially in
the hospital stay pt's creatinine trended downward. It now it
1.3 down from 2.6 on admission. During diuresis have been
following Cr closely. Cr currently 3.3. Holding her ACEI.
.
5. IDDM: Pt on SSI for now. Will monitor sugars closely. Pt's BS
elevated over last week due to multiple changes in diet.
Increased NPH after pt started taking TFs. Again recently
increased NPH dose and SSI to accomodate pt's increased BS since
started on TFs and now eating snacks.
.
5. Hyperlipidemia: continued lipitor throughout hospital stay
.
6. FEN: Pt initially NPO. Dubhoff then placed but d/c'd by pt
multiple times. During most recent placement of Dubhoff
interventional radiology unable to pass tube past pylorus, so it
currently resides proximal to pylor. Pt been given TFs according
to nutrition reccs. Seen by Speech and received swallow stu
