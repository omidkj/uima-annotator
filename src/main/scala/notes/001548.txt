Date of Birth:  [**2066-10-31**]             Sex:   F

Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Penicillins / Ceftazidime / Carbamazepine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 848**]
Chief Complaint:
Seizure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
-[**Location (un) **] t-tube removed and replaced with regular
tracheostomy tube
-Tunneled HIckman catheter


History of Present Illness:
40-year-old bed-bound, hemiplegic, minimally-to-non-verbal woman
with history of [**Doctor Last Name **] encephalitis (Dx at age 8), on 4x
AEDs at baseline, s/p Left partial (parietal) hemispherectomy in
[**2085**] (age 19) and s/p VNS placement, who now presents with
several break-through GTC seizures witnessed at a Neurosurgery
appointment for battery replacement surgical planning. She has
daily focal seizures at baseline -- primarily causing twitching
of her Right eyelind -- which are resistant to hemisphereotomy,
VNS placement, and four AEDs. She also has occasional
break-through GTC seizures. She also has a h/o episodes of
aspiration pneumonia requiring intubation, subsequent tracheal
stenosis, and is now s/p tracheostomy, then T-tube placement
[**2101**].

Her VNS battery was at 0.55 years of life remaining back in [**Month (only) 116**]
of [**2108**], but it could not be replaced at that time because the
venous access requested by Neurosurgery could not be established
at that time (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**] insisted on a port-a-cath,
placement of which in the OR by Thoracic was unsuccessful). On
the DOA [**10-8**], while she was at her Neurosurgery appointment (Dr. [**Name (NI) 14232**] office) for preoperative evaluation for her VNS battery
replacement, she had multiple seizures involving eye deviation
to the left, drooling, and cyanosis. Each seizure lasted less
than one minute.  From 12:30 to 4:30pm, there were 15-20
seizures.  In the past when she has had these seizures, it was a
sign that she had an underlying infection, such as aspiration
pneumonia, UTI, or G-tube site infection.

In the ED on admission, she received lorazepam 2mg IM and then
phenobarbital 60mg IV. Of note, her phenytoin dose was decreased
several weeks ago due to an elevated level of unclear cause. Her
phenobarbital level was good at that point (mid-30s), but her
phenytoin level of 7 was much lower than Dr.[**Name (NI) 3536**] goal of
20-25 in this patient, so she was bolused with 500mg IV
phenytoin.

ROS: The patient has chronic abdominal pain, which she continues
to have today.  At baseline she understands speech and is
minimally verbal, with phonation (has T-tube since [**2101**],
replaced once here since) that is understood only by family, not
by her outpatient Neurologist/Epileptologist (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**].  She
has a right hemiplegia, with contracted/flexed RUE. Does not
take PO (G-tube meal bolus feeds). No recent problems with
fever, vision, hearing, cough, vomiting, diarrhea, urination, or
new weakness.

3. Partial left hemispherectomy at age 19 complicated by right
hemiparesis and partial aphasia
4. Mental retardation
5. Left thoracolumbar scoliosis
6. Vagal nerve stimulator implanted [**12-7**], needs battery change
7. h/o Aspiration pneumonias, now on scopolamine patch
8. S/p PEG placement using T tube
9. S/p tracheostomy
10. MRSA line infection in the past
11. Hx multiple UTIs, Urosepsis (enterococcus, VRE, other)
12. Difficult venous access requiring femoral sticks
13. Constipation
14. Mood disorder, on SSRI; also Zyprexa
