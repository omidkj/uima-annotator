History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 49013**] is an 87 year old gentleman with hx of Afib, does not
follow regularly with medical care, who presented [**2128-3-20**] from
OSH with penile necrosis, requiring penectomy on [**2128-3-20**],
post-operative course complicated by tachyarrhythmia, Group G
Strep bacteremia, pulmonary wheezing, cough and new O2
requirement.
.
Patient had been using a plastic soda bottle at bedside about
6-7 days prior to admission to help him urinate with more ease
at home due to frequent nocturia. The bottle became stuck on his
penis, and he attempted to cut most of it off but could not
remove the plastic ring from the base of the penis. Due to
embarrassment, he did not seek medical attention for about one
week, after which entire shaft of penis was noted to be black
with dry gangrene, also with wet gangrene at the base of the
penis surrounding the plastic bottle ring. He was still able to
urinate a small amount through his penis. Denied any
fevers/chills at the time. Only had small amount of pain at the
base of the penis.
.
Patient underwent emergent penectomy with several drains in
place on [**3-20**] and is now POD#3, including urethrostomy, pending
reconstructive surgery in the future. He is currently voiding
through suprapubic tube. There is a clamped perineal tube
keeping the urethra open like a stent. There are also a JP drain
hooked to suction and smaller drain near scrotum.
.
Vancomycin and Zosyn were started on [**2128-3-20**] presentation in
setting of wet gangrene and positive blood cultures. Blood
cultures from OSH on [**3-20**] were noted to be positive for G+ cocci
chains x3 bottles, as well as blood cx from [**Hospital1 18**], later
speciated out to Group G Strep, sensitive to Vancomycin and Pen
G, resistant to erythromycin.
.
Patient was transferred to SICU post-operatively, where he was
A&Ox3 but noted to be pulling on lines and tubes. HRs ranged
from 40s-150s, mostly irregular with stable BPs. Overnight, he
was noted to have decreased urine output, so catheter was
flushed and IVFs were increased. Patient was started on IV
metoprolol for rate control of tachyarrhythmia, presumed atrial
fibrillation, then switched to po metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **], on
which he remains. On [**3-21**], he was switched from morphine to
oxycodone in the setting of hallucinations. He ruled out for MI
with troponins negative x3. On [**3-23**], Zosyn was discontinued
because blood cultures confirmed Group G strep, and Vancomycin
was continued. He was transferred to the Urology floor on
[**2128-3-22**] for further management.
.
On the floor, patient reports wanting to sleep and not
participate in conversation or full exam at this time. He denies
shortness of breath though looks like he is having some
difficulty breathing; states he "always breaths hard." Denies
cough. Denies history of orthopnea or leg swelling. Denies any
known cardiac history. He states that he has not had bowel
movement yet post-operatively. He does state that his lower back
pain is improved at this moment.
.
ROS:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats. Denies headache, sinus
tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denied cough, shortness of
breath. Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations. Denied
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain. Denied arthralgias
or myalgias. All of the other review of systems were negative.
