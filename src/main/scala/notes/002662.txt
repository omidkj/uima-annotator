CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fever and dyspnea.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 63 year-old Haitian
man with HIV (viral load of 21 K, CD4 count of 580).  He was
in his usual state of health until one to two weeks prior to
admission when he developed increased cough with occasional
brownish sputum.  He also had fevers and chills one to two
days prior to admission with general body aches.  He
presented to the Emergency Room with high fevers and profound
fatigue and weakness.  He complained of dyspnea on exertion
and worsening shortness of breath.  In the Emergency Room the
temperature is 104, [**Location (un) **] pressure is 104/80, pulse 120,
respirations 32, O2 sat of 92% at room air.  Later his [**Location (un) **]
pressure dropped to 80/60, heart rate increased to 140,
respirations increased to 36 and O2 sat of 99% with
nonrebreather mask.  He had a chest x-ray done in the
Emergency Room, which showed right upper lobe consolidation.
He was given Levofloxacin and Reserpine and started on
Levophed drip for [**Location (un) **] pressure control.  He was admitted to
the MICU for sepsis and pneumonia.  In the MICU his [**Location (un) **]
pressure was quickly stabilized with fluid resuscitation and
Levophed drip was weaned off shortly afterward.  He continued
to spike fevers on antibiotics until hospital day four
([**7-30**]).  Ceftriaxone and Levaquin were changed to
Levaquin alone after culture was shown to be positive for pan
sensitive strep pneumo.  He had a few episodes of
desaturation in the MICU, which responded well to diuresis.
He had an echocardiogram done, which showed normal left
ventricular function with possible diastolic dysfunction.  He
also had an episode of atrial fibrillation, which was
resolved with magnesium repletion.  He also had an episode of
chest pain in the MICU, which was resolved with sublingual
nitroglycerin and diuresis.  Acute myocardial infarction was
ruled out with series of enzymes.  He has never required
intubation in the MICU.  On the day of transfer to the floor
he was weaned off face mask to 5 liters nasal cannula.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  HIV diagnosed in [**2166**], multiple
pneumonia and bronchiectasis.  Positive PPD status post INH
for one year.  HSV meningitis, disseminating varicella
zoster, lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis diagnosed in
[**2168**] by bronchoscopy, hypertension, diabetes, communicating
hydrocephalus.  No history of [**Year (4 digits) **] transfusion.

MEDICATIONS:  Fortovase 1200 po t.i.d., Nelfinavir 1500
b.i.d., Delavirdine 600 b.i.d., Bactrim double strength one
tab q.d.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No alcohol, cigarettes or intravenous drug
abuse.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 100.  [**Year (4 digits) **] pressure
119/64.  Pulse 107.  Respirations 26.  O2 sat 97% at 5 liter
nasal cannula.  General, awake, alert and oriented times
three, comfortable in bed, no acute distress with nasal
cannula in place.  Head and neck supple.  No lymphadenopathy.
Right IJ triple lumen catheter in place.  Cardiovascular
normal S1 and S2.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Lungs
bilateral crackles half way up.  Abdomen soft, nondistended,
nontender.  Extremities no edema.  No calf tenderness.  Well
healed scar at the right leg.  Neurological examination
cranial nerves II through XII intact.  Motor 5 out of 5.
Sensory intact.

LABORATORY:  White [**Year (4 digits) **] cell count of 8.1 with a
differential of 75% neutrophils, hematocrit 31.4, platelets
387, PT 12.7, PTT 32.1, INR 1.1, sodium 130, potassium 4.4,
chloride 93, bicarb 27, BUN 18, creatinine .8, glucose 75,
calcium 1.2, phos 3.7, magnesium is 1.7.  Chest x-ray
bilateral diffuse alveolar opacity.  Sputum no AFB.  No
fungi.  No Legionella.  No PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] cultures on admission
[**7-27**] positive for strep pneumo, pan sensitive.  Urine
culture negative.  Stool culture negative.  C-diff negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient remained stable in afebrile on
Levaquin.  The clearing of bacteremia was documented with two
negative [**Month (only) **] cultures.  However, his pulmonary status
failed to improve significantly.  He continued to require O2
supplements although he remained O2 sats in the high 90s with
3 to 4 liters of nasal cannula at rest.  He desated very
quickly to 70s with ambulating.  Chest x-ray showed slowly
resolving right upper lobe consolidation, but with interval
worsening of interstitial infiltrates.  Chest CT showed
peripheral cystic and honeycomb changes suggesting idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis.  The pathology report of lymphocytic
interstitial pneumonitis in [**2168**] was reviewed and the final
diagnosis of LIP was regarded not definitive.  He had another
bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage performed before the
discharge.  He was scheduled to follow up as an outpatient
for further workup including possible VATS after he has
recovered from this acute bacteria pneumonia.

He was also found to have asymptomatic hyponatremia on
admission.  The workup was consistent with SIADH due to
pulmonary process. The condition was controlled with fluid
restriction.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Home with oxygen and visiting nurse.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Oxygen 3 to 5 liter nasal cannula,
Levaquin 500 mg q.d. for a fourteen day course, Bactrim
double strength one tab q.d., Delavirdine 600 mg po b.i.d.,
Fortovase 1200 mg po t.i.d., Nelfinavir 1500 po b.i.d.

DISCHARGE FOLLOW UP:  Appointment with primary care physician
in one week.  Appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] at the Pulmonary
Clinic in one month.  Phone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5091**].
