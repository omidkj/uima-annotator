Chief Complaint:
RUQ pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP [**3-17**]
percutaneous chole tube [**3-22**]


History of Present Illness:
This is a 81 year-old male with a history of HTN and afib on
coumadin who was transfered from on [**Hospital3 **] Hospital due to
hypotension and choledocholititasis/cholangitis. Pt was admitted
[**2129-3-16**] at OSH due to a abd pain that started as substernal CP
[**7-22**] 9 hours after dinner on [**3-15**]. Pain improved on arrival to
ER. Also has nausea. Later in OSH started having more lower abd
pain that was different that presentation pain. CT showed a 7mm
in lower CBD stone with 11mm CBD.  Pt became febrile after
admission with rigors and temp to 104.2 rectally. Pt became
hypotensive to 80s and was bolused with IVF with improvement to
100s. Earlier he also had some temporarty MS changes with a neg
head CT. He was given zosyn x 1. EKG vpaced at 60 bpm. PT was
transfered for ERCP.

[**3-17**] CXR: There is a single-lead pacer seen projecting over the
left chest. The heart size remains at the upper limit of normal.
No frank pulmonary edema. The lungs are grossly clear.
.
[**3-17**] ERCP: FINDINGS: Eight fluoroscopic spot views from an ERCP
are submitted for review. A filling defect is noted in the
distal common bile duct with minimal upstream dilatation of the
main common bile duct and consistent with a 7-mm stone.
Sphincterotomy was not performed due to elevated INR as per ERCP
note. A 7 cm x 10 French plastic biliary stent was placed in the
common bile duct for decompression.
IMPRESSION: Single 7-mm distal common bile duct stone.
Sphincterotomy was
not performed in the setting of elevated INR. Instead, a 7 cm x
10 French
plastic biliary stent was placed for decompression.
.
[**3-19**] CXR: Lateral view shows mild peribronchial infiltration, in
both lower lobes, new since [**3-17**]. Findings suggest
aspiration. Small right pleural effusion is new. Moderate
cardiomegaly is unchanged, and there is no interstitial edema or
particular vascular engorgement. Transvenous pacer lead is
continuous from the left pectoral pacemaker to floor of the
right ventricle.
.
[**3-22**] CT abd/pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive gallbladder wall edema and pericholecystic
stranding, consistent with cholecystitis. Additional 2-cm
gallstone at the base of the gallbladder, likely not within the
neck. No definite obstructive stone seen within the cystic duct
or common bile duct, though CT is not exquisitely sensitive for
detection of biliary calculi. Surgical/IR consult is
recommended.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions and left lower lobe
consolidation which may represent pneumonia.
3. Incidentally noted moderate sliding hiatal hernia, large
fat-containing right spigelian hernia, and diverticulosis.
Findings were discussed with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2184**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2185**] at 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. on
[**2129-3-22**].
.
[**3-22**] IR report:
The risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the
patient.
Written informed consent was obtained. Preprocedure timeout
confirmed the
identity of the patient and the procedure to be performed.
Patient was
prepped in the usual fashion. With aseptic technique, an 8
French [**Last Name (un) 2823**]
catheter was inserted into the gallbladder. Brownish material
was drained.  Post-procedure instructions were documented on the
electronic patient record.  No immediate post-procedure
complications were identified.
IMPRESSION:
Successful placement of percutaneous cholecystostomy tube.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 81 year-old male with a history of afib, CAD, ICM
(?EF) who presents with fevers, RUQ, hypotension, and dilated
CBD [**3-16**] to obstructing stone from [**Hospital3 **] hospital for ERCP.
.
#  Choledocholithiasis, acute cholangitis, acute cholecystitis -
Patient had a obstructing stone causing fever, RUQ pain, and
hypotension at OSH. He improved with IVF and IV unasyn.  His BP
soon stabilized after aggressive hydration.  ERCP was performed
and it revealed a distal CBD measured approximately 10mm. A
single 7 mm round stone that was causing partial obstruction was
seen at the distal CBD. Otherwise, the proximal CBD, the CHD and
the intrahepatic biliary tree appeared unremarkable.  A
sphincterotomy was not performed due to elevated INR. In setting
of acute cholangitis, A 7cm by 10FR Cotton-[**Doctor Last Name **] biliary plastic
stent was placed successfully for decompression.
AFter the plastic stent was placed he initially felt
symptomatically improved and demonstrated quick normalization of
his LFTs.  He was able to tolerate Pos without difficulty.  IV
unasyn was switched to PO augmentin.  Blood cxs are negative to
date.  He however he spiked to 101 on this regimen and cipro was
added for added coverage.  He continued to have low-grade
temperatures on this regimen, so the antibiotics were broadened
to zosyn and vancomycin.  Repeat LFTs were stable.  The patient
had minimal RUQ pain, but no other symptoms.  In discussion with
ERCP, a CT abd/pelvis was pursued on [**3-22**] given ongoing low-grade
temperatures.  This demonstrated findings consistent with acute
cholecystitis.
Upon discussion with surgery (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and ERCP (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 99779**],
a percutaneous chole tube placement for GB decompression was
felt to be the best option rather than CCY, given the extent of
inflammation and the [**Hospital 228**] medical co-morbidities (though no
active medical issues).  He underwent placement of the tube by
IR the evening on [**3-22**] without any complications. He was
continued on zosyn and vancomycin, and had good output through
the tube.  Fluid prelim cultures demonstrated GNR, but were
still PENDING upon discharge.  Blood cultures drawn on [**3-22**] were
still NGTD, but PENDING upon discharge.
Once his WBC and fe
