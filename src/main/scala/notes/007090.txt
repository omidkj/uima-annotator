IMAGES/ STUDIES:
================

CXRAY ON [**2188-12-29**]:
INDINGS: Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding. A
dialysis
catheter projects over the right atrium, unchanged. The right
PICC tip is not seen beyond the junction of the right
brachiocephalic vein and superior vena cava. There is no focal
consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac and
mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal, allowing
for low lung volumes.

IMPRESSION: Right PICC tip is not seen beyond the junction of
the right
brachiocephalic vein and superior vena cava.

EGD on [**12-27**]
Esophagus: Normal esophagus.
Stomach:  Excavated Lesions A single bleeding ulcer was found in
the stomach. There was a visible vessel. Three endoclips were
successfully applied for the purpose of hemostasis.
Duodenum: Normal duodenum.
Impression: Gastric ulcer (endoclip)
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

REPEAT EGD ON [**2188-12-31**]:
Schatzki ring noted in distal esophagus. Scope easily traversed.
Gastric ulcer
Ulcer in the lesser curvature of the body of the stomach
Erosions in the stomach body
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 61 yo female with dCHF, ESRD on HD on plavix and
aspirin who was admitted to the MICU for emergent EGD with with
hypotension, melena and +NG lavage, found to have a bleeding
gastric ulcer which was clipped and is now stable.

# Upper GI bleed: Pt had a bleeding ulcer that had 2 clips
placed. She also received a total of 2 units of PRBCs on [**12-27**]
but has not required any additional blood transfusion since
then. She was on Plavix and ASA given that she has prior stents
for PAD and recent TMA. Her GI bleed was likely aggravated by to
Plavix/Aspirin use. Her Hpylori serology was negative, so this
is unlikely. Pt had two episodes of melanotic stools on [**12-30**],
last one early in the afternoon. She remains HD stable and Hct
is stable in the high 20s. So, this was discussed with GI and
she was taken back to have an EGD on [**12-31**] given that she would
need to be restarted on plavix and ASA. On the repeat EGD there
was no bleeding noted on the gastric ulcer and clips appeared in
place. There is another non-bleeding ulcer seen on the stomach.
GI's recommendation is to continue to hold the ASA and plavix at
this time until she is re-evaluated by GI on Tues of next week
given that her risk of rebleeding is high. This was discussed
with the [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] team who states that her risk of bleeding
outweighs her risk of clotting at this time and she should be
restarted on ASA and plavix as GI thinks this is safe. She will
follow in the [**Hospital **] clinic on Tues of next week and she will need
to have blood counts checked every other day until then with
results sent to her PCP in [**Name9 (PRE) **] hospital as noted on the
d/c instructions.
- continue protonix 40mg Q12 PO
- Diet as tolerated
- hold aspirin and plavix until further indicated by GI
- Check Hct every other day and have results sent to [**Hospital 1459**]
hospital as n
