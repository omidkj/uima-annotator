ADDENDUM:  This is a discharge summary addendum to a
previously dictated discharge summary.  This addendum covers
the dates of hospitalization from [**2144-5-11**] through [**2144-5-18**].

While the initial plan was for the patient to be discharged
to the [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**Last Name (LF) 766**], [**2144-5-11**], he spiked a fever to 102 on that afternoon.  Given this
new development, a fever workup was pursued and a family
meeting was arranged for the following afternoon.

On [**2144-5-12**], a meeting was held.  This meeting was
attended by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 217**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2505**].  In addition, representatives from the nursing
staff, Department of Case Management, and Department of
Social Work were also present.  The patient's family was
represented by his daughter, son in-law, and son.  By the end
of the meeting, it was determined that the family wished to
continue to pursue aggressive medical care for their father.
They felt that were he able to receive adequate nutrition, he
would stand a good chance at being rehabilitated to his prior
level of functioning.

The plan at that time was, therefore, to pursue aggressive
pulmonary rehabilitation at [**Hospital1 **], for a period of time
ranging between one to two weeks, followed by subsequent
reassessment of the patient's clinical status.  The patient
was, therefore, arranged to be discharged to [**Hospital1 **] on the
day following this family meeting.

On [**2144-5-13**], the family requested that the patient be
evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from the Department of
Gastroenterology for PEJ tube placement.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] felt
that the patient was a candidate for PEJ tube placement if he
were to be afebrile.  The patient was, therefore, restarted
on vancomycin and metronidazole as empiric coverage for
possible MRSA and aspiration pneumonia.

Later that afternoon, the patient had an episode of
desaturation into the mid 70s on a 100% nonrebreather face
mask; chest physical therapy was performed and a large mucous
plug was retrieved.  The patient subsequently returned to his
baseline oxygen saturation of the mid 90s on a 50% face tent.
A chest x-ray done at that time showed no significant changes
from prior radiographs.  Also at this time, the patient's
code status was changed to DNR, CPR not indicated, intubation
acceptable if cleared with the family first.

On [**2144-5-14**], the patient was clinically stable, and he
went to the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] for PEJ placement.  Given the
patient's tenuous pulmonary status, however, the Department
of Anesthesia was reluctant to sedate the patient because of
his significant pleural effusions.

On the following day Interventional Pulmonology, therefore,
performed a left-sided thoracentesis under ultrasound
guidance and drained off 1 liter of transudative pleural
fluid.  Chest x-ray performed after this procedure
demonstrated marked improvement in the radiographic
appearance of the left lung.  Later that afternoon, the
patient underwent successful PEJ placement.

On [**2144-5-16**], the patient remained intermittently
febrile, and it was noted that a sputum culture from his
bronchoscopy on [**2144-5-4**] was growing out
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.  Given that the patient was
intermittently febrile, he was, therefore, started on Bactrim
for treatment of his Stenotrophomonas.  His tube feeds were
initiated by his PEJ tube and he was tolerating these feeds
without difficulty.

At the time of discharge, the patient's cell counts and serum
chemistries were stable.
