Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 15519**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tracheal Aspiration


History of Present Illness:
54 yo F with PMH sarcoidosis, tracheostomy [**3-14**] upper airway
obstruction, dCHF, DM1, pulmonary HTN, CAD, morbid obesity
presenting with acute onset dyspnea. She reports that she was
resting at home last night when she noted sudden onset of
shortness of breath. She denies any fever, cough or increased
sputum production. She also reports diffuse abdominal pain which
started around the same time. This morning she developed nausea
and vomiting, which she feels is different from her
gastroparesis. She reports that she has been passing gas and her
last bowel movement was yesterday. She does endorse some
increased tenderness at the site of her umbilical hernia. She
also reports slight increase in bilateral lower extremity edema
as well as migrain headache which started today. According to
her partner who lives with her the onset of her dyspnea was more
subacute occurring over 2-3 days accompanied by and productive
cough.
.
On arrival to the ED T97 BP 184/94 HR 92 RR 24 88% on RA -> 98%
on NRB. In the ED she was given nebulizers, solumedrol 125mg IV.
CXR was done which showed worseing left mid and lower lung
opacity concerning for pneumonia so she was given ceftriaxone
1gIV and azithromycin 500mg po. She was also given morphine 4mg
IV for migraine headache and compazine 10mg x 2 for emesis x4.
While in the ED she desatted to the mid 80's with ABG
7.32/66/58/36 on 100% trach collar so she was admitted to the
ICU. Patient refused positive pressure ventillation in the ED.
.
Of note she was recently admitted from [**4-20**] - [**4-24**] for nausea,
vomiting and migraine headache. She was also treated with zosyn
for a catheter associated urinary tract infection, urine culture
was negative thought due to administration of abx prior to
culture. She was also felt to have a LLL pneumonia. On review of
discharge summary antibiotics were not included on her discharge
medications.
.
She was also admitted [**4-8**] - [**4-12**] for dyspnea thought
multifactorial. She was treated with IV diuresis, IV followed by
po steroids, nebulizer treatments and azithromycin.

.
CXR ([**2191-5-16**]): Worsening left mid to lower lung opacity which
likely is a
combination of atelectasis, and/or pneumonia with superimposed
effusion. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
.
CXR ([**2191-5-16**]): The current study demonstrates rapid development
of bilateral widespread parenchymal opacities, consistent with
rapidly developed moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema. The study
is technically limited, and the lung bases were only partially
included in the field of view, but bilateral pleural effusion is
most likely present. The patient is after prior cardiac surgery.
Tracheostomy tip is at the midline. No pneumothorax is seen.
.
LENI ([**2191-5-16**]): No DVT of the lower extremities.
.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis ([**2191-5-17**]):
1. Mild dilation of ileal small bowel loops with transition
point near an
umbilical hernia represents at least partial small-bowel
obstruction. Early complete obstruction is a less likely
possibility.

2. Stable extensive coronary artery atherosclerotic
calcification and post
CABG changes.

3. Pulmonary artery enlargement suggestive of pulmonary artery
hypertension is unchanged since [**2191-1-3**].

4. No evidence of pneumonia.




Brief Hospital Course:
54 yo F with PMH sarcoidosis, tracheostomy [**3-14**] upper airway
obstruction, dCHF, DM1, pulmonary HTN, CAD, morbid obesity
presenting with dyspnea, nausea and vomiting. The following
issues were investigated during this hospitalization:
.
#Dyspnea: Multiple hospitalizations for similar complaints and
patient has always been approached from a multifactorial
treatment strategy with Lasix, Steroids and nebulizers. During
this hospitalization, she was given Lasix for pulmonary edema
seen on CXR with gradual improvement. Overall etiology was felt
to be pulmonary flash edema in the setting of hype
