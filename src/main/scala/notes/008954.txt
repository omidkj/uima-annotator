Seizure.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 41 yo man with a h/o EtOH abuse, suspected
EtOH/NASH induced cirrhosis, CHF, obesity, and lymphedema who
presented following a seizure.

He was feeling generally unwell with URI symptoms and
conjunctivitis for several days prior to admission.  On the day
of admission, his wife found him down on the ground and
described generalized "tonic-clonic" movements lasting one
minute and urinary incontinence.  He was reportedly confused
after the episode and was intermittently screaming.  He had no
recollection of the event and denies any preceding symptoms,
including unusual tastes or smells, lightheadedness,
palpitations, chest pain, or dysnpnea.  He reportedly got up on
his own and walked downstairs to the ambulance.
He denies any history of seizures including febrile seizures or
EtOH withdrawl seizures although on chart review there is
mention of "seizure-like" activity during a possible PEA arrest.
 He has a long history of alcohol use (3 beers per day for many
years, stopped in [**2151-5-5**] when he was diagnosed with liver and
heart disease).  He states he started drinking again ([**1-7**] shots
of vodka) every other day two weeks prior to admission due to
the stress of losing his job.  His last drink was three days
prior to admission.
He initially presented to an OSH where he was given dilantin 1gm
IV.  His vitals on arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED were T 99.6, HR 104,
BP 156/91, 100% on RA. While in the ED he spiked to 101.3 and
had a traumatic LP which did not reveal evidence of infection.
He recieved 2 L NS, vancomycin, decadron, morphine, and
ceftriaxone and he was intubated for airway protection and was
admitted to the ICU on a CIWA scale.

Pertinent Results:
Labs:
wbc 9.3, hct 35, plt 233
Na 138, K 3.8, Cl 101, HCO3 24, BUN 15, Cr 0.8, glucose 131

ALT 18, AST 62, LDH 277, Alk Phos 199, T bili 1.9.

U/A - done on [**12-10**], [**10-10**], [**10-11**]:
These all showed no evidence of infection but did show hematuria
ranging from 265 rbcs -> 31 -> [**2-6**].

Microbiology:
[**10-5**] CSF: no micro-organisms, negative culture.
[**10-5**] Blood culture: no growth.
[**10-6**], [**10-10**] Urine cultre: no growth.
[**10-7**], [**10-10**] Blood culture: pending.
[**10-10**] IV catheter tip culture: pending.

Studies:
[**10-4**] Head CT:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
2. Maxillary, sphenoid, and ethmoid sinus disease.

10/31 L shoulder X-ray:
1. No fracture or dislocation noted.

[**10-8**] Abd Ultrasound:
1. Cirrhotic appearing liver.
2. No evidence of intra or extra-hepatic bile duct dilatation.
3. No evidence of ascitis.

[**10-10**] CXR:
Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is new but there is no
pleural effusion. Heart size is top normal.  No good evidence
for pneumonia.  Sclerosis in the right third and fourth anterior
ribs, probably posttraumatic, should not be mistaken for lung
lesions.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 41 yo man with a history of CHF, EtOH abuse,
suspected EtOH/NASH induced cirrhosis, obesity, and lyphedema
who presented after having a suspeced EtOH withdrawl seizure.

1. Seizures:  These were thought to be secondary to EtOH
withdrawl.  He was evaluated by neurology while he was in the
ICU and was briefly placed on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
However, this was not continued and he did not have any seizure
activity while hospitalized.

2. EtOH withdrawl:  Due to his heavy benzodiazepine requirement
he was electively intubated in the ICU for airway protection.
He went through withdrawl with a CIWA protocol using ativan and
self-extubated himself on [**10-8**] (day 4 of admission).  He was
also supplemented with folate, thiamine, and a multivitamin.  By
the day of discharge ([**10-11**]) he had stable vitals and was not
[**Doctor Last Name **] at all on the CIWA scale.  The importance of alcohol
cessation was stressed to him by all members of the medical
team.  He was also followed by social work and was given
multiple resources to pursue as an outpatient, including [**Company 191**]
social work, [**Location (un) 15953**] Community Care, AA meetings in [**Location (un) **],
and ALANON meetings for his wife.  At this point he seems most
interested in a combination of AA meeetings and meeting with a
social worker.

3. Cirrhosis: This is thought to be secondary to EtOH and NASH.
An ultrasound during this admission showed no ascites.  He was
followed by the hepatology service while hospitalized and
continued on his regimen of nadolol, aldactone, and lasix.  He
has a follow-up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**10-13**].

4. CHF: This is of unclear etiology but is thought to be due to
right sided failure from his obesity and OSA.  He was continued
on his regimen of lasix, aldactone, lisinopril, and nadolol.  He
was discharged on lasix 40 po daily which is an increase from
his previous dose of 20 po daily.  He has had an evaluation for
CPAP but he has not been using it due to discomfort.  He was
encouraged to follow up on this with his PCP if he would like to
restart CPAP.

5. Lymphedema: This is thought to be due to chronic right sided
failure.  He was continued on his diuretic regimen of lasix and
aldactone and was encouraged to follow a low salt diet and
exercise as tolerated to try to lose weight.

6. Hematuria: He was noted to have hematuria on three separate
urinalyses.  He did not have any urinary symptoms and his U/As
and cultures were otherwise unremarkable.  This should be
followed up with a repeat U/A by his PCP and potentially by
cystoscopy if indicated.

7. Fever:  He was initially febrile in the ED to 101.3.  An
infectious workup including a CXR, LP, blood, and urine cultures
were all negative.  On the day of discharge, he had a low grade
fever (100.3) and again had a negative infectious workup.  He
was asymptomatic with a normal wbc count and was instructed to
seek medical care if he had increasing fevers at home.
