Service:  CMI/CARDIOLOGY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient is admitted to the
CMI/Cardiology Service for elective cardiac catheterization.
The patient is an 80 year-old woman who presented to [**Hospital 1474**]
Hospital with approximately six weeks increasing jaw pain at
rest.  She presented to [**Hospital1 1474**] on the [**5-31**] via
primary care physician's office where she reportedly
developed chest pain with a new right bundle branch block
during exercise tolerance test.  Her peak CK at [**Hospital1 1474**] was
33, peak troponin was less then 0.3 within normal limits.
Here the patient had a CT angiogram, because of complaints of
back pain, but there is no evidence of dissection on the
scan.  There was confirmation, however, of her known
abdominal aortic aneurysm, which on the scan was 3.9 by 4.3
cm.  The patient's underwent cardiac catheterization there on
the [**2199-10-3**].  The patient's catheterization was
notable for severe osteo RC stenosis and underwent successful
RPT stenting of the osteo right coronary artery with an ultra
stent.  The patient also had ____________ after the case,
because of heparin allergy and was also given Plavix.  Post
procedure course was complicated by the evening after the
catheterization of agitation requiring doses of antipsychotic
medications and anxiolytics.  During removal of the sheath
the patient became agitated complicating removal of the
sheath.  The patient became hypotensive and bradycardic
during the sheath removal with bleeding during the removal of
the procedure as well.  Given the concern about an AV fistula
at the right femoral site or a retroperitoneal bleed, the
patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit and was
evaluated by Vascular Surgery who recommended no surgical
intervention at that point.  Serial hematocrits were followed
over the course of the evening.  The patient received one
unit of packed red blood cells, but was otherwise
hemodynamically stable overnight.  An ultrasound the
following morning revealed no presence of any AV fistula, no
pseudoaneurysm, only the presence of hematoma.  The patient
was transferred back to the floor, but kept under Coronary
Care Unit care for monitoring, daily hematocrit checks and
markedly improved.  The patient has been evaluated by
physical therapy and is presently requesting home health aid
to assist with her short term home restoration of her
activities of daily living.

Discharge medications will be added as an addendum to this
discharge summary.
