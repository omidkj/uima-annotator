Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
mental status changes

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line insertion

History of Present Illness:
61F with multiple medical problems including CHF, [**Name (NI) 2320**], chronic
arachnoiditis, neurogenic bladder, recent admission for altered
mental status and recent admission for bacteremia, who now
presents to the ER with mental status changes.
.
The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 23798**] with
mental status changes which were attributed to her Detrol, which
was discontinued. She was discharged on her previous dose of
Morphine PCA and was admitted again [**2192-2-17**] with hypotension and
fevers. She was found to have [**2-28**] blood culture bottles with
coagulase-negative staphylococcus. The decision was made by her
PCP and ID specialist to treat through the line with vancomycin
given recent multiple line changes. She was discharged on
[**2192-2-22**] with a ten-day course of Vancomycin. She has had
multiple admissions to [**Hospital1 18**] with mental status changes and
renal failure, thought to be secondary to narcotics overdose and
decreased po intake.
.
Her husband reports that since her discharge from the hospital,
she has been "down" and not quite herself. She hasn't been
excited to talk to people who she is usually excited to speak
with and she has been less interactive and taking in fewer po's.
She had been awake and communicative, however, until this
morning when her husband tried to wake her up to give her her
Vancomycin dose.  She was difficult to arouse and he called EMS.
He denies that she has had fevers, chills, night sweats, N/V,
pain, cough, aspiration events, diarrhea, foul-smelling or a
change in urine, change in her ambulation or motor ability. She
is currently on Day 13 of Levofloxacin and Vancomycin.
.
In ED, her FSG was 129, she was afebrile at 97.6 with BP 178/64.
There was a concern for narcotics overdose from her PCA and she
was given narcan 0.4mg x3. Subsequently her BP increased to
220/100 with HR in 150s and she was acutely agitated. She was
given 1mg IV haldol and 1mg of ativan to control her agitation.
She was also given metoprolol 5mg IV x 3 to control
hypertension.

without evidence of CHF or pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Altered Mental Status:  The patient was admitted with a
change in mental status that was thought to be related to
narcotics overdose.  Her mental status improved with three doses
of narcan and holding her morphine PCA. Over the next several
days of her hospitalization, her various pain medications were
gradually restarted and she was given prn morphine doses. The
pain consult service was contact[**Name (NI) **] and recommended starting
methadone and titrating according to morphine needs. Several
days later, the patient became somnolent and occasionally
apneic. She was given two doses of narcan with transient
improvement in her mental status, but she became extremely
hypertensive, necessitating transfer to the MICU for
observation. There, she was monitored without further narcan.
She made a surprisingly fast return to baseline with holding her
pain medications. This decline in mental status was almost
certainly related to her methadone and multiple pain
medications. On transfer back to the floor, she was placed again
on a morphine PCA at her outpatient basal rate of 2mg per hour
and was noted to become somnolent and less responsive once
again. Her basal rate of morphine was discontinued and she
returned to baseline. She was maintained on the morphine PCA
with demand doses only. In addition, her baclofen and tizanidine
are being held.
.
2. Fever: The patient was noted to have low-grade fevers during
the first week of her hospitalization. Blood cultures from a
prior hospitalization on [**2192-2-17**] grew staph epi in [**2-28**] BCx
bottles and the plan was to treat through the line with
Vancomycin. Given continuing fevers on Vancomycin and [**12-2**] blood
culture bottles on [**3-8**] that grew staph epi, the Hickman
catheter was discontinued. Her fevers resolved with several more
days of Vancomycin.
.
3. Urinary tract infection: In addition to her line infection,
the patient had a positive UA with a urine culture which grew
Pseudomonas. She was treated with a seven-day course of
Ceftazadime.
.
4. ARF: The patient was admitted with a creatinine of 1.7,
elevated from her baseline. Her renal function improved with
fluid hydration suggesting a prerenal etiology. Her ACEI was
initially held and restarted.
.
5. History of PE and DVT: She was continued on Coumadin with a
therapeutic INR throughout her hospitalization.
.
6. Chronic arachnoiditis: As described previously, the patient's
morphine was intermittently held throughout this admission for
altered mental status. As her pain medications were restarted
and morphine dosing increased, she w
