Admission Date:  [**2179-12-7**]       Discharge Date:  [**2179-12-13**]

Date of Birth:                    Sex:  M

Service:  THORACIC

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75 year-old man with a
history of chronic restrictive lung disease with a history of
asbestos exposure.  The patient is admitted for elective
decortication of his right lung in attempt to improve his
respiratory status and symptoms, which present as chest pain,
dyspnea and shortness of breath.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Dilated cardiomyopathy with an EF of 35%, normal coronary
arteries, mitral regurgitation secondary to prolapse, status
post pericarditis, status post myocardial biopsy, which was
nondiagnostic.
2.  Past ETOH with fatty infiltrate of liver and a history of
alcoholic hepatitis.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Status post cholecystectomy.
2.  Status post lung biopsy.
3.  Status post tonsillectomy.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the day of his admission on [**2179-12-7**] he underwent a right thoracotomy with decortication,
total pleurectomy on that side.  The procedure was
uncomplicated and he tolerated it well.

1.  Neurological:  His pain was originally controlled with an
epidural and later well controlled on po Percocet.  He had
one very short episode, which lasted seconds in which he was
found to be unresponsive, but that was attributed to
syncope/vasovagal response in the setting of hypotension.  He
otherwise presented no neurological deficits.

2.  Cardiovascular:  Immediately postoperatively had a short
run of supraventricular tachycardia.  He does have a history
of this arrhythmia in the past and was therefore initially
placed on intravenous beta-blocker at a low dose and then
later back on his Carvedilol.  In the early postoperative
period it seemed that he was retaining fluid and that he had
worsening congestive heart failure.  He was followed by his
cardiologist and the congestive heart failure team and was
recommended to put him on a Natrecor drip.  After the
Natrecor drip and while receiving Lasix intravenously he
diuresed well and seemed to be stable, because of his
hemodynamics and his volume status.  The drip was
discontinued and he was placed again on Lasix po, which he
was taking at home.  During his hospitalization he had
borderline low blood pressures and therefore was never placed
back on his Diovan.  His original Digoxin dose was continued
throughout his hospitalization.  Because of his low blood
pressures he did have one episode, which resulted in him
having syncopal episode while trying to get out of bed.
Blood pressures at the time measured to be low, but he
responded within seconds and blood pressures came back up
with a minimal amount of fluid.  On the days prior to his
discharge he remained stable with no arrhythmias with blood
pressures in the range of 100 to 110 systolic.

3.  Respiratory:  He remained stable throughout his
hospitalization.  Chest tubes were removed on postoperative
day two and at no time did he develop any significant
shortness of breath or dyspnea.  He was satting well on 2
liters of nasal cannula (100%).

4.  Gastrointestinal:  His diet was advanced without
difficulty.

5.  Genitourinary:  He was placed back on Lasix as noted and
was on a Natrecor drip for two days diuresing well.  His
kidney function remained stable throughout his
hospitalization.

6.  Hematology:  He remained stable with no evidence of
significant bleeding.  His hematocrit prior to discharge is
31.1.

7.  Infectious disease:  There were no active issues.  He
remained afebrile throughout his hospitalization with a
normal white count.

8.  Musculoskeletal:  During his stay his ambulation was
gradually advanced, but after being evaluated by the Physical
Therapy Service here it was decided that he would benefit
from a short stay in a rehabilitation center.

He is therefore discharge to rehab with the following
recommendations:  Follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 175**] on the day and
time as noted in the discharge sheet.  Continue current
medications as noted on the discharge sheet.  Continue follow
up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] his cardiologist, his primary care
physician and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from the congestive heart failure
program as scheduled by appointment.
