History of Present Illness:
50 yo M with h/o asthma, who was found unresponsive and shaking
by his son. [**Name (NI) **] reports he was unresponsive for about 5 minutes,
called 911 who was there withn several minutes. Per EMS note, pt
found pulseless, apneic.  AED read no shock. Pt intubated. Pt
then went into Vfib at 15:34 and was shocked, converted to sinus
brady, given lidocaine bolus, converted to Vfib and shocked
again. He went into sinus and was bolused with lidocaine again,
then went into Vfib ->then PEA, given epi with CPR, ->VT
shocked, ->sinus ->VT and shocked ->sinus ->VT and shocked ->
sinus continued, started on lidocaine drip. This period of
shocks lasted from 15:34 to 15:41. He arrive to [**Location (un) **] at
15:50, while there he was coded from 15:50-16:02, shocked 4 more
times, given calcium, epi, amiodarone 150 mg load and drip,
dopamine. He was med flighted to [**Hospital1 18**], on arrival to ED, he
lost pulse, given epi 1mg x2, calcium, shocked x2 and pulse
returned. He was sent up to cath lab, cath showed clean
coronaries, apex not moving well ?takasubo.

[**Last Name (un) **]-tsubo
like wall motion abnormalities.
3. Severely elevated left sided filling pressure with LVEDP of
30 mm Hg.

[**2108-10-6**] CT head: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or
mass effect.

[**2108-10-6**] ECG: Ectopic atrial rhythm
Long QTc interval
Left axis deviation - anterior fascicular block
Probable old inferior infarct
Generalized low QRS voltages
Anterior ST segment elevation - consider anterior myocardial
infarction
.
[**2108-10-8**] Echo: Conclusions:
Technically suboptimal study.
The left atrium is normal in size. No definite passage of saline
microbubbles at rest. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is good. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded ?mid septal
hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right
ventricular systolic function is borderline normal. The aortic
valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Overall good biventricular systolic function. No
definite
right-to-left shunt identified.
.
[**2108-10-16**] KUB: IMPRESSION: Nonspecific bowel gas pattern with
mildly distended transverse colon, without evidence of
obstruction or free air.
.
FECAL CULTURE (Final [**2108-10-14**]):
NO ENTERIC GRAM NEGATIVE RODS FOUND. NO SALMONELLA OR SHIGELLA
FOUND.
CAMPYLOBACTER CULTURE (Final [**2108-10-14**]):  NO CAMPYLOBACTER FOUND.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 50 year old male who presented with ventricular
fibrillation cardiac arrest in the setting of QT interval
prolongation, and hypokalemia likely secondary to diarrheal
illness. The patient received multiple shocks to achieve a
stable rhythm and was intubated for respiratory failure. He was
given the arctic sun therapeutic cooling protocol. On day 2 of
hospitalization there was 24hour period of sepsis physiology
requiring a brief period on pressors and broad antibiotic
coverage. The patient was extubated on hospital day #4 and
demonstrated improving mental status. The patient was treated
empirically for C. difficile infection and received an
implantable cardioverter defibrillator on [**2108-10-17**].
.
CARDIAC
Long QT: During investigation of the etiology of the patient's
cardiac arrest, it was noted that he had a prolonged QT interval
on ECG.  Additionally an old ECG shows a long QT interval.
Cardiac catheterization was done which revealed clean
coronaries.  Old echo and new echocardiograms were normal.  A
tox screen was positive for opiates and THC, however it is known
the patient takes methadone for low back pain.  The patient
endorses using marijuana.  As Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented with
hypokalemia and required regular supplementation, he was started
on standing potassium.  In addition, an ICD was placed for
prevention of recurrence.  The procedure went well and no
hematomas developed.  He will need to follow up with device
clinic and will require monitoring of his potassium as he is
receiving supplemental K in addition to being on spironolactone.
.
Rhythm:  The patient is discharged in sinus rhythm.  His QT
remains in the upper 400s.  During the hospitalization he
required olanzapine for agitation secondary to anoxic brain
injury.  Olanzapine was used as there is less evidence to show
it prolongs QT.
.
Pump:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented with cardiogenic shock.  A v-gram
showed possible takatsubo on the night of admission however an
echocardiogram on [**10-8**] was essentially nl.  His EF was shown to
be >50%.  He was diuresed minimally and the goal was to keep
fluid balance even.
.
PULMONARY
Respiratory Failure:  The reason for intubation was thought to
be due to acute asthma.  ABG on admission showed respiratory
acidosis and elevated lactate.  The diagnosis of PE was also
considered.  A CXR was done which showed a possible developing
RLL infiltrate.  On HD #4, the patient was extubated
successfully, satting 97-100% on RA.  He was treated initially
with IV steroids, changed to oral, and is now being tapered.  He
will be discharged on 10mg of prednisone which will be further
tapered at time of PCP visit or as deemed appropriate at rehab.
He was given nebulizer treatments for acute asthma and completed
a course of vanco/zosyn for concern of aspiration pneumonia.
.
GI: During his hospitalization, Mr. [**Known lastname **] developed frequent
diarrhea.  He has a known history of rectal fistula.  Cultures
for C. diff were sent which were negative, however based on the
frequency of diarrhea and his elevated white count, he was
started on flagyl for empiric treatment of C diff.  He continued
to tolerate PO with adequate fluid intake.  He will require 8
more days of flagyl to
