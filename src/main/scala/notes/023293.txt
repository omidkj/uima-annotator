Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
ICD firing

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
VT ablation


History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 82 year old with known nonischemic
cardiomyopathy (LVEF 10-15%), s/p BiV ICD, CAF s/p AVN ablation,
VT s/p ablation who presents with recurrent VT and ICD firings.
In [**2127**], the patient had a BiV ICD placed, with an EF of 15%,
prolonged, QRS, and NYHA class 3. The patient represented on
[**2132-2-17**] with VT storm and ICD firing
about 8 times. The patient was loaded with amioderone. He then
underwent EPS and VT ablation. On study, the patient was found
to have three VTs with RBBB morphology with varying late
precordial transition and at least three VTs with LBBB
morphology were seen. An unstable induced VT with LBBB
morphology with superior axis and dominant precordial R waves
were induced, which required defibrillation. After the last set
of ablation lesions, no
inducible VT was seen with single extrastimulus testing.
Endocardial mapping demonstrated basal posterolateral and apical
scar. The patient was discharged on amioderone from that
hospitalization.
.
The patient was intially maintained on amioderone 200mg daily.
Without reoccurance, that dose was intially decreased to 100mg.
A subsequent ICD interrogation during the summer of [**2131**] showed
two recurrent episodes of VT requiring ICD shocks, and the
amioderone dose was returned to 200mg. He has remained symptom
free, without further ICD firings, palpitations, chest pain, or
pre-syncope.
.
Over the last 3 weeks, the patient has noted increasing symtpoms
of heart failure, with dysnpnea at rest and lower extremity
swelling. His lasix dose was uptitrated from 40mg to 80mg [**Hospital1 **],
with notable improvement of symptoms, and loss of 5-6lbs of
water weight. 6 days prior to presentation, the patient's ICD
fired. He was instructed by his cardiologist to go the ED if it
reoccurred more than 1x per day. The patients ICD fired again on
thursday and friday, and on follow up with his cardiologist, his
amioderone was increased to 200mg [**Hospital1 **]. His device fired again on
saturday morning.
.
On the day of presentation, the patient awoke from sleep at 5am
and felt light headed. He reports trying to feel his radial
artery, but couldn't feel a strong pulse. He felt a shock, and
went back to bed. He awoke again at 630 am, with a similar
dizzyness, and his device fired for a second time. This happened
again at 7am. The patient went to [**Hospital6 **], where he
was bolused with amioderone, and started on a gtt. He again went
into stable VT, and again his device fired. He was transfered to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
.
In the ED, the patient remained comfortable and chest pain free.
He had another reoccurance of VT, with HR of 150. His blood
pressure dropped to 78 systolic. His ICD did not fire. He was
given atomadate and DCCV. He was bolused with lidocaine, and
started on a lidocaine gtt. His blood pressures improved to
105/70, and V-paced rhythm 85. The patient is being admitted to
the CCU for further care.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis. He
had bloody stools three months prior, with a negative GI work
up. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

Imaging/Studies:
CXR [**11-28**] -  No overt pulmonary edema or change in position of
the dual
pacemaker leads.
.
ECHO [**12-3**]: The left atrium is elongated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated. No masses or thrombi are seen in
the left ventricle. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is severely depressed (LVEF= 15-20 %) with global hypokinesis
and akinesis to dyskinesis of th inferior and infero-lateral
walls. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left
atrial pressure. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
EKG [**12-1**]: Ventricular paced rhythm. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2132-2-21**] ventricular premature depolarizations are no
longer evident.
