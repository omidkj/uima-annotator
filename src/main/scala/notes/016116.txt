Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2024**]
Chief Complaint:
Lethargy.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
59 yo F with PMH left upper lobe NSCLC stage IV adenocarcinoma
with brain mets s/p met resection, cyberknife, and whole brain
radiation completed on [**2185-11-29**] not currently undergoing chemo
(planned to start this on [**2185-12-8**]) who reports being too weak
to get out of bed for past four days with very poor po intake.
Also notes constipation which improved with senna, abdominal
pain which she felt was related to constipation and has improved
since moving her bowels, nausea, vomiting.  Pt [**Name (NI) 4045**] after
calling neighbor.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 98.4 124 73/23 18 90%.  CXR
showed PTX on left with no shift or tension.  CTA C/A/P was
obtained which showed consistent findings with PTX, bilateral
pulmonary emboli, DVT in left common iliac left superficial
femoral veins, and extensive metastatic progression with
innumerable mets to the liver and bones. Also obtained head CT
which shows edema at sites of known brain mets. Started heparin
drip without bolus in ED per onc recs in effort to treat PE but
reduce risk of hemorrhage into brain mets. Got 6L fluid and SBP
improved.  Pt appeared more alert after fluid rescuscitation.
Lactate was 7.2 with increase to 12.1 after a few hours. IP felt
chest tube was appropriate if patient was not CMO however
patient wanted to think about this more.  Oncologist saw pt in
ED and discussed GOC - explained that she had only a few weeks
to live at best.  Pt agreed to be DNR/DNI but refused CMO and
wished to continue treatment. Vitals on transfer were 107/71,
80, 18, 98% RA
.
On the floor, patient is comfortable and denies pain. Notes she
would like some coffee.
.

Past Medical History:
Past Oncologic History: (Per Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 91178**] Note
[**2185-11-10**])
NSCLC stage IV adenocarcinoma EGFR/ALK/KRAS w/t
- [**7-/2185**] Developed progressive DOE and weight loss
- [**2185-9-8**] Presented to her PCP with DOE, referred to the [**Hospital1 18**]
ED where she was found to have a LUL mass on CXR. CT chest
showed
mass in the left upper lobe measuring up to 4.6 cm, causing
complete collapse of the left upper lobe. This tumor is
centrally
located and extends into the mediastinal fat. Outpatient work up
arranged
- 08/12-13/11 Presented with L sided numbness c/w a complex
partial seizure. Heat CT revealed new brain mets.
- [**2185-9-9**] Brain CT showed right parietal lobe mass at the
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white junction, with extensive surrounding vasogenic edema
and 5-mm left [**Hospital1 **] shift.
- [**2185-9-10**] Brain MRI showed right posterior frontal and anterior
parietal mass measuring approximately 3 cm.
- [**2185-9-14**] Resection of  brain met, consistent with NSCLC
adenocarcinoma of lung primary
- [**Date range (1) 91179**] CyberKnive to brain lesion
- [**2185-10-6**] PET CT showed intensely avid paraortic lymph node
demonstrated adjacent to the primary left upper lobe mass
measuring 21 x 17mm. Known FDG-avid left upper lobe mass as
detailed above, most compatible with the primary carcinoma.
Several other scattered pulmonary nodules in the left hemithorax
as detailed above. Increased bilateral adrenal FDG-avidity to
SUVmax of 4.6 most compatible with metastatic involvement, left
greater than right with an associated soft tissue lesion on the
left. Known right cerebellar metastasis is better appreciated on
the prior MRI from [**2185-9-30**]. Post-surgical changes from prior
right parietal craniotomy.
- [**2185-10-31**] MRI of the brain showed multiple new mets
- [**2185-11-1**] Start WBRT, planned to complete on [**12-15**]
.

CXR: Large left apical tumor as previously noted however now
with features suggestive of an underlying pneumothorax as
described above. No
signs of tension at this time. Results were relayed over the
phone initially to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19409**] at approximately 12:05 p.m. on the
day of study and then reviewed in person at approximately 12:10
p.m.

CTA C/A/P:1. Large left pneumothorax without evidence of
tension.
2. Right upper lobe pulmonary embolus in the apical segmental
artery. Right lower lobe pulmonary emboli in the lateral basal
and posterior basal segmental arteries. No evidence of right
heart strain or definite pulmonary infarction. Large DVT in the
left common femoral and right superficial femoral veins likely
source of pulmonary emboli. 3. Enlarged left upper lobe mass
with areas of hypoattenuation suggesting
necrosis or pulmonary infarction. Continued encasement of the
left pulmonary artery, which is narrowed to a diameter of 3 mm,
also seen on prior study.  Obliteration of the left upper lobe
pulmonary artery and left upper lobe bronchus. Complete
occlusion of the left superior pulmonary vein with eccentric
filling, which may represent thrombus or tumor invasion. 4.
Extensive progression of metastatic disease in the chest,
abdomen and pelvis. Progression of mediastinal lymphadenopathy
with new epicardial lymph node. New right lower lobe spiculated
lung nodule. Multiple new intra-abdominal metastases including
lesions too numerous to count within the liver, bilateral
adrenal and bilateral renal metastases.

HEAD CT:1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Encephalomalacic post-surgical changes in the right
frontoparietal region.
