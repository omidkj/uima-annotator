Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
Elective admission for valvuloplasty

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with Drug eluting stent to Left main
coronary artery
Cardioversion


History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo gentleman with history of aortic stenosis,
HTN, DM, HLD, PBD CAD s/p NSTEMI with LAD stent who was admitted
for elective cath/valvuloplasty in the setting of known AS and
increasing SOB over the past few weeks, and concern for
worsening AS by outside echo. Pt states that he has been
asymptomatic and denies SOB, chest pain/pressure, N/V or
diaphoresis. However, according to his home nurse, his exercise
tolerance has diminshed and although his mobility is even more
limited than usual due to shortness of breath. At present, he is
only able to walk [**12-23**] blocks before becoming short of breath. He
denies orthopnea however he sleeps on three pillows at night.
Currently he is pain free and asymptomatic.
.
He has been followed as an out-pt for his aortic stenosis. His
last echo on [**2197-9-21**] showed peak aortic gradient of 46, mean of
30.3 and [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.4 cm2. In the cath lab today, he was found to
have left main distal stenosis of 60-70% (borderline) and a
valve gradient 15-20 mm with calculated [**Location (un) 109**] of 1.2-1.3,
therefore valvuloplasty was deferred. A left main stent was
placed.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope. He does endorse bilateral
LE edema.

1. No evidence of renal artery stenosis on the left. The right
side cannot
be evaluated and renal artery stenosis on this side cannot be
excluded.
2. Bilateral renal cysts.
.
[**9-28**] CARDIAC ECHO
Color-flow imaging of the interatrial septum raises the
suspicion of an atrial septal defect, but this could not be
confirmed on the basis of this study. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. LV systolic function appears mildly-to-moderately
depressed (ejection fraction 40 percent) secondeary to
hypokinesis of the inferior and posterior walls. Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The supporting structures of the tricuspid
valve are thickened/fibrotic. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2196-8-8**], the right ventricle now appears somewhat
hypokinetic.
.
[**9-27**] CARDIAC CATH
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated left
main coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had an 80% distal
stenosis.  The
LAD and LCX had diffuse luminal irregularities.  The RCA was
known to be
occluded and not injected.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated filling
pressures
with a LVEDP of 40 mmHg and a RVEDP of 24 mmHg.  There was
severe
pulmonary arterial hypertension with a PA pressure of 75/34
mmHg.  There
was systemic arterial hypertension with a central aortic
pressure of
154/64 mmHg.  The cardiac index was normal at 2.5 L/min/m2.  The
mean
gradient across the aortic valve was 15 mmHg.  The calculated
aortic
valve area was 1.0 cm2.
3. Successful PTCA and placement of a 3.5x18mm Cypher
drug-eluting stent
were performed in the LMCA.  The proximal edge covered the LMCA
ostium.
Final angiography showed normal flow, no apparent dissection,
and no
residual stenosis.  (See PTCA comments.)
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Left main coronary artery disease.
2. Placement of a drug-eluting stent in the LMCA.
3. Moderate aortic stenosis.
4. Biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
5. Severe pulmonary arterial hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo gentleman with hx of AS, CAD, s/p cath with LAD stent
placement, admitted for management of AS and cardioverted for
afib.
.
# Coronary Artery Disease: Mr [**Known lastname **] has a history of CAD with
stent placement to the LAD [**3-27**] and known RCA occlusion. He does
not have any recent history of CP or pressure and ST depressions
on EKG appear to be chronic. Cath showed LM 80% lesion, rec'd
DES with good result.  He will be continued on aspirin and
plavix on discharge and will need to take for at least one year.

.
# Acute on chronic systolic congestive Heart Failure: Volume
overloaded on exam with scrotal and peripheral edema. PCWP
elevated at 40. Lasix gtt initially to diurese. Pt then changed
to furosemide PO that was changed back to Torsemide [**Hospital1 **] on
discharge. Note that this is an increased dose for pt and he
should be monitored for signs of dehydration. Atenolol changed
to Metoprolol XL for CHF. ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] not started because of low
blood pressures after diuresis. This can be addressed by pts
outpt cardiologist. Pt should do daily weights and
