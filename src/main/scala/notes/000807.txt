Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
56 yo M with widely metastatic renal cell CA on sutent
presenting with hypoxia and hypotension.

The patient states that approximately 2-3 days ago he awoke in
the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and noted
significant dyspnea on exertion. His shortness of breath was
persistent and slightly worsened until the time of admission. On
the day of admission, the patient was seen in oncology clinic
for a scheduled transfusion for anemia thought to be associated
with sutent myelosuppresion. The patient complained of SOB and
was found to be hypoxic to the 80's%. He was sent to the ED. The
patient denies any recent fevers, chest pain, pleuritic pain or
dizziness. He notes a non-productive cough over this time period
with increased RLE swelling more than LLE swelling. The
patient's wife notes that his RUE also was transiently swollen.
The patient describes a small amount of increased shortness of
breath when supine. He notes possible sick contacts.

In the ED, the patient was hypoxic to 80s% improved on 4L NC
with sbp 80. He received approximately 1.5L NS and 1U PRBC (for
Hct 22 down from 29 1 month prior). Lactate was noted to be 2.8.
CXR revealed a multifocal infiltrate and he received 1 dose of
levofloxacin. The patient was felt not stable for CTA and he was
admitted to the ICU for further care.

Past Medical History:
--Metastatic RCC diagnosed [**7-/2152**] after developing hematuria.
S/p debulking nephrectomy in 10/[**2151**]. His disease progressed,
and he received radiation to the lumbar spine, left chest wall,
and left humerus. Mets also to R temporal bone, T10 vertebral
body with compression and extension into epidural space. He
developed a left humeral pathologic fracture in [**12/2152**]
requiring an IM nail procedure. S/p laminectomy and poterior
T3-L1 fusion for back pain from spinal met. He started high-dose
interleukin-2 therapy in [**2-/2153**], but his disease continued to
progress. He entered the Avastin and sorafenib trial on
[**2153-4-18**] and has had a decrease in size of his lesions.
Sorafenib had to be held for four weeks because of weight loss.
His sorafenib was restarted after gaining some weight but at a
reduced dose on [**2153-7-25**]. His Avastin was held because of
excessive proteinuria. He was withdrawn from the study on
[**2153-11-28**] because of osseous metastases. Started Sutent
[**2153-12-26**], discontinued soon after that and then restarted on
[**2154-5-15**] at reduced doses due to myelosuppression. Cord
compression at T10 [**2154-3-8**]. He underwent spinal embolization on
[**3-9**] followed by transpedicular decompression at T10, total
laminectomy for excision of tumor at T11, and T3-L1 fusion on
[**3-12**].  He then received radiation therapy to T10-T11 and T5-T6,
completed [**5-3**].
-- HTN
-- GERD
-- Bilateral knee replacements


Social History:
The patient lives in [**Location **] with his wife. [**Name (NI) **] is retired, but
previously worked as a combat engineer in the military for 15
years and as a post officer in the post office for 30 years. He
smokes approximately 1 pack over the span of 3 days. He reports
having smoked one pack per day since the age of 15. He drinks
very occasionally. He is married. He has two daughters.


Family History:
Brother w/ early heart disease.  DM in both mom and dad.  Mother
and daughter both have "thyroid problems."

Physical Exam:
97.8 101 94/53 63 22 98% 4L NC 71.3kg, desats to 80's% with
minimal movement.
Gen: Cathectic, pale. NAD.
Integumentary: No rashes or lesions.
HEENT: PERRL.

Pulm: Bilateral crackles R>L.

Pertinent Results:
[**2154-8-23**] CTA -
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
2. New extensive multifocal bilateral ground-glass opacity with
septal thickening and increase of size of preexisting pulmonary
nodules. These findings are most likely secondary to pneumonia,
less likely CHF. Recommend evaluation of pulmonary nodules
following resolution of these opacities.
3. Extensive bony metastatic disease within the spine, ribs and
sternum.

[**2154-8-23**] CT Head -
1. New right cerebellar enhancing 1 cm lesion concerning for a
metastatic focus.
2. Worsening right frontal bone expansile lytic lesion
consistent with bony metastasis.

[**2154-8-23**] US RUE/RLE - No evidence of acute deep venous thrombosis
in the right upper or right lower extremity.


Brief Hospital Course:
56 yo M with metastatic renal cell CA on palliative chemo and
XRT with mets to spine with hypoxia and hypotension.

# Hypoxia. The patient was hypoxic to 80s% on admission to the
ED but improved on 4L NC.  Also hypotensive to SBP 80's.  He
received approximately 1.5L NS and 1U PRBC (for Hct 22 down from
29.1 month prior). Lactate was noted to be 2.8. CXR revealed a
multifocal infiltrate and he received 1 dose of levofloxacin.  A
CTA was negative for PE, but showed multifocal infiltrates
consistent with PNA.  His antibiotics were broaden upon
admission to the ICU to vancomycin, ceftazidime, and
levofloxacin.  The patient continued to deteriorate during the
next few days with increasing oxygen requirements.  He was
started on bactrim to cover for possible bactrim given his
relative [**Name (NI) 28729**].  A family meet was held given his
worsening respiratory status that was felt to be a combination
of infection, worsening metastatic disease, and bilateral
pleural effusion.  He and his family decided on CMO and all
medications were discontinued.  He passed away on [**2154-8-29**] at
11:01am.  His wife was with him at this bedside.  His family
declined autopsy.
