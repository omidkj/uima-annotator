Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2969**]
Chief Complaint:
weight loss, heavy smoker

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Bronchoscopy.
2. Cervical mediastinoscopy.
3. Right thoracotomy with right lower lobectomy, resection of
giant upper lobe bulla and intercostal muscle flap
bronchoscopy.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 69 year old Chinese immigrant with
a large cavitary right lower lobe nodule. Bronchoscopy with
biopsy failed to yield a cancer diagnosis and was negative
for acid-fast organisms. The lesion was intensely PET-
positive with no other site of disease. He had obvious
bullous emphysema with a giant bulla occupying half the upper
thorax but adequate pulmonary reserve to tolerate lobectomy.
Lobectomy was recommended to clear this lesion with associated
bullectomy to further improve his respiratory mechanics.
Because of the T2 nature of the lesion in the lower lobe, also a
 mediastinoscopy. He agreed to proceed after
careful explanation using the hospital's Chinese interpreter.
He complains of generalized weakness as well
as some vague back pain. He denies any cough, fevers, dyspnea,
hemoptysis, productive cough, or night sweats. His weight has
recently remained stable.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2133-6-16**] 9:37 AM
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
69 year old man s/p RLL resection and RUL blebectomy, ptx on
water seal returned to sx
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for interval change on sx
2 VIEWS CHEST:
COMPARISON: [**2133-6-15**].
INDICATION: Chest tube on water seal.
A right-sided chest tube remains in place in the lower right
hemithorax posteriorly. Again demonstrated is a moderate sized
pneumothorax at the right apex as well as a loculated anterior
hydropneumothorax. These findings are stable in the interval.
Increased opacity is again demonstrated in the right middle and
right lower lobes, not significantly changed, but there are
improving opacities at the left lung base with only minor
residual atelectatic changes remaining in this area.
IMPRESSION:
Stable moderate right apical pneumothorax and basilar
hydropneumothorax. Improving atelectasis at left lung base and
no significant change in right middle and lower lobe opacities,
most likely due to atelectasis although infection is not
excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: please eval for ptx s/p CT d/c

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
69 year old man s/p RLL resection and RUL blebectomy, CT d/c
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please eval for ptx s/p CT d/c
INDICATION: Status post right lower lobe resection and right
upper lobe blebectomy, chest tube removed, evaluate for size of
pneumothorax.

COMPARISON: [**2133-6-16**].

TECHNIQUE: Single AP portable upright chest.

FINDINGS: A right apical pneumothorax is again seen and is
probably unchanged in size allowing for differences inpatient
positioning. There is continued right-sided pleural effusion
consistent with hydropneumothorax. The right basilar chest tube
has been removed. Approximately stable opacities within the
right lung base and stable atelectasis at the left base. Tiny
left pleural effusion. The osseous structures appear unchanged.

IMPRESSION:
1. Stable moderate right apical pneumothorax.
2. Approximately stable right basilar hydropneumothorax. Tiny
left pleural effusion.
3. Stable bibasilar atelectasis. More prominent density at the
right base may represent atelectasis versus superimposed
infectious process.
