STUDIES:
.
[**2126-10-20**] PELVIC US:
1. Limited examination demonstrates an endometrial stripe
measuring 1.4 cm. If the patient is postmenopausal, this is an
abnormal finding, and differential diagnosis includes
endometrial hyperplasia, endometrial polyp, or endometrial
carcinoma and clinical correlation with biopsy is recommended.

2. Extensive ascites.
3. Ovaries not visualized on this limited examination.
.
ECHO ([**2126-10-16**])
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened (?#). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral
regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There is probably at
least mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension (although
tricuspid regurgitation jet is now technically subopitmal).
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2126-10-3**],
probably at least mild pulmonary artery systolic pressures is
now detected.
.
ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND ([**2126-10-17**])
1. Cirrhosis.
2. Bidirectional low velocity flow in a patent portal vein.
3. Mild-to-moderate ascites.
4. Cholelithiasis.
.
SIGMOIDOSCOPY [**2126-10-18**]
Findings:  Clotted blood was seen in the colon extending from
the rectum to transverse colon. Other Three to four cords of
rectal varices were identified. Mostly likely cause of rectal
bleeding. Varices were injected with a 1:1 mixture of dermabond
and ethiodol.
Impression: Blood in the colon Three to four cords of rectal
varices were identified. Mostly likely cause of rectal bleeding.
Varices were injected with a 1:1 mixture of dermabond and
ethiodol. Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to transverse colon

-[**2126-11-2**] Abd U/S (Initial read): 1. Moderate ascites.
2. Reversed flow in the main portal vein.
3. Normal waveforms in the hepatic veins
-[**2126-11-1**] Fluoro: Successful repositioning of the [**Last Name (un) 28075**]-[**Doctor First Name 1557**]
tube beyond the pylorus in the ascending duodenum and additional
placement of a NG tube in the gastric antrum.
-[**2126-11-1**] KUB: Unchanged bowel gas pattern consistent with
nonobstructive ileus. Feeding tube is now localized in the
stomach.
.
Endometrial biopsy: Blood and very scant strips of surface
endometrium with focal tubal metaplasia.
Pap: NEGATIVE FOR INTRAEPITHELIAL LESION OR MALIGNANCY
.
Blood culture: negative
HBV DNA: Not detected
Urine culture ([**10-22**]): > 100K yeast
Urine culture ([**10-24**]): 10K-100K yeast
Right lower extremity wound/Catheter tip culture: Negative
C Diff: Negative ([**10-25**] and [**10-31**]).


Brief Hospital Course:
Floor Course:
#. CIRRHOSIS/TRANSPLANT EVAL: The patient's MELD was
consistently in the high 30's, including total bilirubin levels
in the high 30's. ALT/AST/AP were generally stable. The etiology
of cirrhosis was not entirely clear, as her past workup included
a mildly positive anti-smooth muscle antibody, and an isolated
positive HBcAb, in the absence of surface antigen positivity.
Repeat anti-[**Last Name (un) 15412**] was weakly positive at 1:40. IgG levels were
elevated at >[**2116**]. She was empirically started on prednisone and
broad-spectrum antibiotics, to cover possible autoimmune
hepatitis as well as low-grade undetected infection. Prednisone
was subsequently stopped several days later, as the patient had
not demonstrated any improvement in her LFT's, and she
experienced small amounts of blood in her stool. Culture data
was generally negative, except for urine cultures revealing
yeast. Pre-transplant evaluation included an endometrial biopsy
and pap smear that was negative for malignancy. On [**11-2**], a donor
liver was believed to be available, and the patient was taken to
the pre-operative holding area. The donor was found to have a
soft tissue infection, however, and the
