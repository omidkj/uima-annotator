History of Present Illness:
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admit: Chart reviewed, please see admit note for further
details). Briefly, Ms. [**Known lastname 5395**] is a 62-year-old woman with
history of COPD who presented to an OSH with difficulty
breathing after failed outpatient antibiotic treatment for
presumed bronchitis - symptoms included 1 month of progressive
dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and cough. 10lb weight loss over
1 month prior to hospitalization, some anorexia (all per
report). CXR showed bilateral hilar masses with multiple lung
lesions. Chest CT showed multiple nodules and mediastinal LN
enlargement. Bronschosopy under intubation with biopsy at OSH
revealed undifferentiated CA, likely small-cell lung CA and
possible post-obstructive PNA. She was treated with
Vanc/Zosyn/Levofloxacin for 2 days plus Solumedrol for ?COPD.
.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**11-18**] and had flexible
bronchoscopy in SICU which showed extrinsic compression of
LUL/lingula/LLL, but L mainstem was patent. Patient also had
thick sputum presumed to be from post-obstructive pneumonia. She
was taken to OR on [**11-19**] for flexible bronchoscopy through rigid
scope to obtain specimens -- here, IP performed TBFNA of L
paratracheal and subcarinal nodes, EBBx of LUL, brush of LUL,
BAL for cytology of LUL.
.
Given findings of obstructive mass and new lung CA, patient was
transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to receive radiation and chemotherapy. On
arrival, patient appeared comfortable and was in NAD.

Physical Exam:
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission:
VS: T 97.9 HR 68; BP 128/62; RR 23; O2 97% on AC FIO2 60% TV 350
RR 22 PEEP 10
GEN: Intubated, comfortable, alert, awake, shakes head
appropriately to yes/no questions
HEENT: NCAT. Anicteric. MM slightly dry.
LUNGS: Crackles over right upper lung field. CTA anteriorly.
Absent lung sounds in left lung fields.
HEART: S1S2 RRR II/VI midpeaking systolic murmur best heard at
RUSB
ABD: Hypoactive BS, soft NT/ND.
EXT: warm, no edema, syymetric DPs
NEU: Alert, responds appropriately to questions, limited exam
due to intubation and sedation. PRRL. Reflexes symmetric.

Pertinent Results:
- CT CHEST ([**11-18**]): 1.  Large obstructing left perihilar mass
accompanied by significant mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Leftsided tracheal impression with slight rightward shift due to
displacement by the lymphadenopathy. 2.  Abrupt termination of
the distal left main bronchus likely due to left hilar mass with
associated collapse of the left lung and left pleural effusion.
? left lower lobe lung mass. 4.  Right lung consolidations
consistent with inflasmmation/infection/aspiration. 5.
Leftsided pleural effusion.
6.  Questionable splenic masses versus perfusion anomaly on
single phase arterial phase scan. Overall appearances highly
suggestive for lung malignancy, possibly small cell carcinoma
but correlate clinically and with bronchoscopy/biopsy.
- CXR: Unchanged total left-sided pulmonary white-out distal to
bronchial stenosis.  No significant interval change.
.
ECG: sinus rhythm @ 60BPM. nL axis. nL intervals. poor R wave
progression. No acute ST/T changes.
.
Pathology
1.  4L  lymph node (A): Invasive non-small cell carcinoma, favor
squamous.  Examination of the frozen section shows that no tumor
is present on the frozen section.  Tumor is only seen in the
frozen remnants.
2.  Left upper lobe (B): Invasive non-small cell carcinoma,
favor squamous.
3.  Endobronchial biopsy (C): Invasive non-small cell carcinoma,
favor squamous.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P 62-year-old woman with new SCLCa and obstructing mass
causing white-out of left lung and post-obstructive PNA. She was
transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] with symptoms of hemoptysis and left lung
whiteout for bronchial stenting and artery embolization. She was
initially treated in MICU [**Location (un) **] then transfered to the [**Hospital Ward Name 5074**] [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for XRT.
.
# LUNG CA:  Intitially pathology was read as small cell lung
cancer which on further evaluation was determined to be NSCLC,
most likely squamous. She received 3 rounds of radiation therapy
to reduce tumor burden and to attempt to allieviate left lung
collapse. She was then started on Carboplatinim/Taxol on
[**2122-11-23**].  CT abd/pelvis showed no metastasis. MRI read shows no
mets.
.
# RESPIRATORY DISTRESS/POST-OBSTRUCTIVE PNEUMONIA/?COPD: After
bronchoscopy, the patient remained intubated given total
white-out of left lung field from obstruction due to NSCLCa and
underlying severe COPD. She was also diagnosed with a presumed
post-obstructive PNA with leukocytosis and fever and started on
Levofloxacin for a 14 day course. She was also intially started
on Vanc which was then discontinued. In addition, she was
started on  treatemtn for COPD flare: Albuterol/ Atroven, IV
Methylprednisolone which COPD treatment which is now being taper
off. The patient was extubated successfully as oxygenating 94%
on %5L NC.  Patient was d/c'd home with supportive home O2
therapy.

Discharge Condition:
Stable


Discharge Instructions:
You are being discharged from the hospital after being admitted
for shortness of breath.  Work up revealed multiple masses in
your lung, and a biopsy was taken showing cancer of the lung.
You have since undergone the initation of chemotherapy and
radiation, which will need to continued as an outpatient with
additional radiation.
  You were also found to have a pneumonia, and have completed a
course of antibiotics.  You still remain short of breath because
of the compromise to the airways by the lung cancer, and are
being discharged with home oxygen to maintain adequate
oxygenation.

Followup Instructions:
You need to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient.
