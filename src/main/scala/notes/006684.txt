Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2166-4-2**] for a
right total knee replacement. The patient tolerated the
procedure well. Please see the separately dictated operative
note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for details of the surgical procedure.  He was
extubated and brought to the recovery room in stable condition.
Once stable in the PACU, he was transferred to the floor. On
POD#1 he was seen by physical therapy and initiated his rehab
care. His labs and vitals were within normal limits.  In the
afternoon of POD #1, Mr. [**Known lastname 57215**] was sitting up in a chair
when he leaned over in the chair to try to reach something, he
fell from the chair onto his right knee.  The patient's surgical
dressing was noted to become stained with serosanguinous fluid.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] remove the dressing and found the wound to be dehisced
at the distal aspect.  Mr. [**Known lastname 57215**] was taken urgently back to
the operating room for an irrigation and debridement of the
wound and revision closure.  He was given one unit of blood
intra-operatively.  He tolerated this procedure well and again
was successfully extubated in the OR.  On arrival in the PACU,
patient was noted to be having multiple PVCs.  He received
Lidocaine and labs were sent.  Patient was transferred to the
ICU overnight for close observation.  He had no further issues,
remained hemodynamically stable overnight and had only a few
PVCs over the course of the night.  On POD #1 his hemovac drain
was removed.  His diet was advanced.  He was transferred to the
floor for continued post-operative management.  He progressed
well with physical therapy.  His hematocrit was low at 21.6.
The patient did not wished to be transfused.  His hematocrit
trended up to 23.4 and remained stable.  He continued to
progress well with physical therapy.  All lab results and vital
signs remained stable.  He is being discharged today to rehab in
stable condition.
