Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2751**]
Chief Complaint:
Back pain

- T6 & T7 laminectomy for evacuation of epidural hematoma.
- L hallux amputation


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 89225**] is a 56-year-old gentleman with a history of atrial
fibrillation on coumadin, DM, CAD s/p 3-vessel CABG & chronic
back pain s/p spinal surgery in [**2166**] who complained of worsening
"flank pain" after having a root canal on [**2171-7-3**].  The next day
he was unable to stand & the pain was described as being much
worse than his chronic back pain.

He initially presented to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 1459**] Hospital on [**2171-7-7**]
with back pain that was radiating to the top of his thights.  He
was discharged but returned later that day.  On his second
presentation, labs were drawn which revealed an INR 17 (the
patient had been taken antibiotics in association with his root
canal). The patient was started on ceftriaxone for a possible
toe infections that was noted on exam.

The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for MRI (he has an allergy
to contrast). A repeat INR was 4.5 s/p Vit K administration.  In
the ED, the patient was noted to be tachypneic & in respiratory
distress s/p IV dilaudid & valium (for concern about possible
EtOH withdrawal) administration; he was subsequently intubated.
He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (cefepime & vanco),
and was admitted to the MICU.

In the ED, he was writhing in pain and was given Dilaudid. He
drinks 3-4 drinks per day, but had not in the last 3 days. Given
the posibility of withdrawal, he was given valium.  He became
hypoxic to the low 80s, tachypneic, and was intubated. A CT head
was negative for an acute process. His INR here was 4.5. He was
started on cefepime for a presumed L toe infection. He remained
persistently tachycardic to high 120s/low 130s, even after
intubation and sedation for which he was admitted to the ICU.

Past Medical History:
- CAD s/p CABG x3 in [**2163**], s/p stents
- [**8-/2166**] bone graft
- diabetes
- carotid stenosis
- anemia
- atrial fibrillation
- chronic back pain


Social History:
- Currently on disability from a job as a dispatcher
- Previously worked as an critical care nurse
- Denies tobacco use
- Drinks approximately [**3-15**] drinks per day.  He wife believes
that he has had withdrawal symptoms in the past during previous
hospital admissions, although he has never had seizures, nor has
been been admitted for detoxication.
- Lives with his wife.

Family History:
- Not-contributory

CT Head IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. Specifically,
there is no evidence of an acute hemorrhage

CXR IMPRESSION: ET tube terminating 5.7 cm above the carina.
Vascular crowding is seen in the setting of low lung volumes,
however, no acute intrathoracic process is detected. Please note
that the right costophrenic angle is completely excluded from
the study.

MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] IMPRESSION:
1. 5 cm x 13 mm x 9 mm left posterior epidural collection
posterior to the
T12 and L1 vertebral bodies is consistent with an epidural
abscess with mild involvement of the left posterior paraspinal
muscles.
2. Anterior displacement of the nerve roots of the cauda equina
with mild
thickening and clumping is most consistent with arachnoiditis.

MR L spine [**2171-7-12**] IMPRESSION:
Status post evacuation of epidural abscess. Except for tiny
residual areas of fluid slightly above the level of the
laminectomy site and also at T11-12 level majority of fluid seen
within the epidural space is no longer visible.  Some residual
enhancement of the epidural soft tissues is noted with
considerable decrease in mass effect on the thecal sac. No
abnormal signal seen within the spinal cord.

MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] [**2171-7-11**]  FINDINGS: There is an area of slow diffusion in
both occipital horns of the lateral ventricles. No corresponding
abnormality is noted on the susceptibility T2 or T1-weighted
images. No infarct, mass or mass effect is noted in the brain.
There is no significant FLAIR hyperintensity within the brain
parenchyma. The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells show
mild fluid in the right maxillary and sphenoidal sinuses.
IMPRESSION: Small areas of slow diffusion in both occipital
horns concerning for pus within the ventricles. A small amount
of blood is a less likely possibility.

ECHO IMPRESSION: Very suboptimal image quality due to body
habitus. Left ventricular systolic function is difficult to
assess, ejection fraction is probably at least 45%. The right
ventricle is not well seen. No significant valvular abnormality
seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
56 yo male w/ CAD s/p CABG & stents, Afib on coumadin and EtOH
abuse here w/ acute on chronic back pain. Pt was admitted to the
MICU after intubation in the ED for hypoxia.

ACUTE DIAGNOSES:
# Epidural Abscess & Hematoma: The patient was intubated on
admission to the MICU. An MRI was obtained which showed an
epidural fluid collection concerning for infection or hematoma.
He was started on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam.
Neurosurgery was consulted and considered that the fluid was a
hematoma consistent with his INR of 17 at presentation. His INR
was partially corrected after FFP and Vit K to an INR of 4.5. On
hospital day 2, a repeat MRI was ordered to help further
identify the fluid collection. On hospital day 4, the patient
had a brain MRI due to a concern for his mental status (given
that he was not responding off of sedation). After his INR was
corrected to 1.4 in preparation for surgery, he underwent a
T5-T8 laminectomy and hematoma evacuation, during which purulent
material was also found in the space. The culture from the
epidural mass showed pan-sensitive E-coli as well as Group B
strep. As per ID recs, the Pip-Tazo was changed to Ceftazadime,
which was then changed to ciprofloxacin because of a drug rash
presumed to be secondary to the ceftazidime. ID recommends
continuance of the Vancomycin and Ciprofloxacin for a duration
of 6 weeks (Vanc started on [**2171-7-8**], Cipro started on [**7-16**]).
