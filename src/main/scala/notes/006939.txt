Imaging:
1)CT head ([**3-31**]): No acute intracranial process. Small scalp
contusion anteriorly.

2)Cxray ([**3-31**]): 1. ET tube in satisfactory position; however, the
findings suggest overinflation of its cuff. 2. Coarse reticular
opacities at the right lung apex, raising the possibility of
aspiration pneumonitis.

3)MRI ([**4-13**]

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 84F PMH hypothyroidism, multiple falls, p/w respiratory
failure and bradycardic arrest, s/p paravertebral hematoma
drainage, no active issues.

1) Respiratory failure/VAP/Pneumothorax: Patient was initialy
intubated at the OSH in setting of bradycardic respiratory
arrest which per the record may have been the result of an
aspiration event.  She initially looked quite good on the vent,
following commands, with good mechanics and so she was extubated
on [**4-1**].  Within 2-3 hours, she had what is presumned to be be
another respiratory event.  She became hypoxic to the 20's, with
marked cyanosis, requiring an oral airway for adequate
oxygenation by ambu-mask.  She was emergently intubated by
anesthesia, fiberoptically as she was still in the hard cervical
collar.  After she was re-intubated, she had a CT of the neck
which showed disruption of the anterior longitudinal ligament at
the C5/6 level with large prevertebral hematoma.  neurosurgery
was consulted and the patient was taken to the OR on [**4-8**] to
have the hematoma drained.  She began to have infiltrates on her
CXR and copious secretions beginning on [**4-4**] suggestive of VAP.
Sputum and mini-BAL cultures were sent and eventually grew out
MRSA and S. pneumonia.  Further complicating her respiratory
status she had an iatrogenic pneumothorax on [**4-5**] as the result
of a sub-clavian central line placement.  Thoracic surgery was
consulted and a chest tube was placed with good resolution of
the pneumothorax.  Patient has received intermittent diuresis
with lasix to improve her resp status. Patient was successfully
extubated on [**4-15**] with no complications. She had no respiratory
complications thereafter.

2) Mental status: Patient arrived to unit intubated.  She
appeared to follow commands and there were no notable focal
deficits.  Her mental status appeared good enough that she was
extubated on [**4-1**] and immediately after extubation she was able
to answer simple questions appropriately. After becoming
re-intubated her mental status was unclear and she was often
agitated, though sometimes following commands. A CT scan on [**4-9**]
showed a small amount of layering intraventricular hemorrhage
within the right lateral ventricle.  Neurosurgery was informed
and they felt that it was not likely to be a result of her
hematoma drainage.  Neurology was consulted but found it quite
difficult to assess the patient secondary to sedation.  There
was some concern about decreased strength and movement on her
left side, which appears to be a new finding compared to her
exam prior to her first extubation. This finding did not seem to
persist after she moved to the floor. An MRI/MRA of the head was
performed [**4-13**] and was unremarkable for acute stroke, or mass
lesion. For much of the admission, we assumed that her dementia
was significant, and indeed on [**4-24**], psychiatry was consulted in
the setting of seeking guardianship, and formally judged the
patient to not have capacity.
.
For unclear reasons, perhaps related to resolution of pain and
discomfort, and with no clear relationship to the periodic
evidence of bacterial colonization of her urethra and Foley, her
mental status cleared to a quite lucid and well-oriented state
starting on [**5-6**], confirmed by a follow-up assessment by the
same psychiatry attending who had seen her on [**4-24**] and again on
[**4-30**]. She was mostly well-oriented, though sometimes eccentric,
after that time. She was able to consent to neurosurgery.
Additionally she made her son her healthcare proxy. We stopped
the process of pursuing guardianship.

3) Other issues of infection: Her initial leukocytosis and fever
in the MICU resolved as she was on the floor. Her diagnosis of
VAP as described above was consistent with her continued copious
secretions.  Sinusitis - acute vs chronic on CT head.
Coagulase-negative S. aureus were seen from A-line cultures, but
peripheral cultures negative and all other blood cultures NGTD.
She started vancomycin, zosyn, and ciprofloxacin on [**4-4**]. Zosyn
and cipro were stopped on [**4-6**] and replaced with ceftriaxone,
continuing vanco. (see below re: rash). Ceftriaxone was then
changed because of rash the next day to levofloxacin, and she
was then on vancomycin and levofloxacin through until [**4-13**]. She
was briefly put on ciprofloxacin again for a UTI from [**5-10**] to
[**5-13**] but when quinolone resistant Citrobacter grew out we
discontinued this and changed her Foley; a subsequent urine
culture showed a small number (<5000) GNRs, likely a small
remaining colonization.
.
4)Rash: Started after patient received one dose of Ceftriaxone
on [**4-7**]. Ceftriaxone was stopped and the rash gradually
resolved.  Ceftriaxone was added to her record as a drug allergy
and her ant
