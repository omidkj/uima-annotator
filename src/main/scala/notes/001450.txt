Chest Pain

History of Present Illness:
This is a 44 y.o. female with history of 1 vessel CAD s/p MI and
placement of DES to LAD in [**2186**], insulin dependent DM, and
Polysubstance abuse who presented with 3-4 days of crescendo
chest pain.  The patient complained of 2 weeks of SOB with
exertion and talking that worsened over time. Three days prior
to presentation this was accompanied by chest pain that felt
like substernal chest pressure; she took sl nitro on two
occasions to good effect. On the day prior to admission, she
took 3 sl NTG. Then, at 0400 on [**2193-1-12**], she awoke from sleep
with a 10/10 chest pain/pressure that radiated to both arms and
her back. It was accompanied by an inability to move or talk and
lasted 30 minutes. She stood up, went to the bathroom, and then
went back to sleep. She awoke in the later AM, felt [**4-13**] Chest
pressure, arranged a babys[**Name (NI) 1786**] for her child, and asked her
ex-husband to take her to the [**Name (NI) 487**] [**Name (NI) **] (11:15 AM).
.
At [**Hospital1 **], pt presented with ST Elevation in 2,3, aVF, V5 and
V6. received ASA 324, Heparin Drip, Nitro drip, Plavix (600mg),
and 10u Regular insulin (bg 417). Transfered to [**Hospital1 **] with VSL
104/70, HR 76, RR 18.
.
At [**Hospital1 **], patient straight to cath lab. RCA with 95% distal
stenosis, received IC ntg, balloon angioplasty, Endeavour stent
with 2nd Endeavour to repair proximal edge restenosis. 105 ml
Omnipaque given.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for presence of:
DOE (walking, talking), chest pain as above.
absence of:
chest pain (at present), paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.
On other review of systems:
+ occ. nausea, occ. nightsweats (when sugar low), menorrhagia,
calf pain ("charleyhorse") with ambulation, leaning on shopping
cart, numb toes, tingling fingers. All of the other review of
systems were negative.

DISCHARGE LABS:

--------------
STUDIES:
Cardiac catheterization [**2193-1-13**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated one vessel disease. The LMCA had no
angiographically apparent disease. The LAD had a patent stent
and no angiographically apparent disease. The Cx had no
angiographically apparent disease. The RCA had a distal 95%
stenosis with TIMI 2 flow into the more distal branches.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed an elevated left sided
filling pressure of 30 mmHg (LVEDP). The central aortic pressure
was 97/58 mmHg. There was no transaortic gradient on pullback
from the LV to the aorta.
3. Left ventriculography revealed a calculated LVEF of 34%.
There was hypokinesis of the posterobasal, inferior, apical and
anterolateral walls.
Qualitative wall motion:
1. Antero basal - normal
2. Antero lateral - hypokinetic
3. Apical - hypokinetic
4. Inferior - hypokinetic
5. Postero basal - hypokinetic
Final DX
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 27534**] was admitted to the hospital s/p STEMI.  Hospital
course by problem:
.
1. ST-ELEVATION MI
She presented with worsening chest pain and was found to have
RCA disease on cath.  She received a DES to the RCA during cath.
 Tox screen was positive for cocaine which likely contributed to
coronary vasospasm and cause the MI.  She was given Integrilin
for 18 hours post-cath.  She was started on Atorvastatin and
Lisinopril while in the hospital as well as Plavix.  Due to
difficulty paying for medication, the Atorvastatin and
Lisinopril were not continued on discharge.  She worked with
physical therapy prior to discharge and was chest pain free.
She was discharged only on aspirin and Plavix to facilitate
medication compliance.  She has follow-up with cardiology and
her PCP.
.
2. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE
She has both systolic and diastolic dysfunction.  Preliminary
Echo showed EF of 40-45%.  She had no symptoms of decompensated
heart failure during this admission and did not require
diuretics.  She was counseled on limiting her salt intake.  She
has cardiology follow-up.  She was not discharged on an ACE due
to inability to pay for medications.
.
3. DIABETES
Blood sugars were difficult to control.  She was continued on
NPH 28 units [**Hospital1 **] as per her home regimen and was given a humalog
sliding scale.  She has an appointment with [**Last Name (un) **] to follow-up
on blood sugar management as an outpatient.  She was not given
an ACE due her inability to pay for medications.

4. SUBSTANCE ABUSE
