History of Present Illness:
HPI: Mr. [**Known lastname 2816**] is a 53 year old male with HIV (CD4 401 in
[**6-10**], VL 1250), MVP, sterile pyuria, who presents with 4 days of
N/V/D. He says he was in his usual state of health when he noted
onset of nausea and anorexia. The following morning he awoke
with a fever of 103, N/V and diarrhea which he describes as
profuse, watery, non-bloody, but dark in color. He has been
having at least 20 episodes of diarrhea per day. His emesis has
been dark in color, but no gross blood. He has not been able to
keep down any of his medications. His abdominal pain started
only after significant emesis, diarrhea, and coughing (see
below).
.
On review of systems he also notes a cough that began 2 days
prior to admission, productive of sputum. He also notes dark
urine, but denies dysuria, or increased frequency. Of note, he
had a barbeque about 6 days ago at which time he ate cooked
meat. No recent antibiotic use.
.
On arrival in the ED, VS were 103.5, 87, 141/59, 18, 98% on RA.
He overall appeared only mildly uncomfortable, however labs were
notable for a WBC count of 15, lactate 5.2. His CXR revealed a
RML and RLL PNA. He was also guaiac positive. Code sepsis was
initiated with a RIJ catheter and he received 4 L NS, as well as
levo/flagyl for presumed intra-abdominal process/PNA.

8) Last colonoscopy [**1-/2171**]


Social History:
He lives alone in an apartment in [**Location (un) 86**]. He is not currently

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 53 year old male with longstanding HIV (CD4 400, VL 1250),
sterile pyuria, presents with 4 days of N/V, profuse diarrhea,
febrile, RML infiltrate, code sepsis.
.
1) Sepsis: Patient meets criteria based on lactate, fever, WBC
count, although it's possible that his lactate elevation is
related to a primary intestinal process rather than diffuse
tissue hypoperfusion. Code sepsis initiated in the ED. Other
possible sources include his RML/RLL PNA, and positive UA. He
has been noted in the past to have sterile pyuria, with negative
urine AFB, therefore this is not new for him. Will f/u cultures
before considering UTI. See below for discussion on
intra-abdominal source - cover with levo/flagyl for this
possiblity as well as CAP. Given CD4 count, less concern for PCP
or other atypical infection. Cont on levaquin, flagyl.
.
2) N/V/D: With respect to an intra-abdominal process, his
symtpoms are consistent with a colitis, especially with an
enteroinvasive organism given his guaiac positive stool and hct
drop. His recent barbeque makes E.Coli (with renal failure and
uncooked meat, need to consider EHEC) and salmonella possible.
No recent antibiotics, however C.Diff still possible. History of
Hep B infection as well - will repeat full panel of serology
given transaminitis and mild bili elevation, and check hep A as
well as C (though C would not explain acute picture). Lastly,
with HIV infection need to consider CMV colitis - will check CMV
serology as well as viral load, as it doesn't appear he's ever
had this - as well as cryptosporidium, and TB infection,
especially given his recent sterile pyuria, although his urine
AFB was negative, and his CD4 count is > 400 making all of these
less likely. Urology had been planning a CT abdomen to evaluate
his pyuria. CT abdomen notable for duodenitis.
.
3) RML PNA: As above, treated for CAP with levaquin for now.
Unlikely atypicals given CD4 > 400. Patient 98% on RA. Started
on levaquin.
.
4) Metabolic acidosis: Anion gap of 17 on arrival, likely
secondary to lactic acidosis which was eventually trending down.
Interesting that in the setting of > 20 episodes of watery
diarrhea per day, patient doesn't have a concurrent non-gap
acidosis.  Eventually resolved w/ hydration.
.
5) Anemia: Patient with large hct drop with hydration, likely
unmasking pre-existant anemia. However, much below basline.
Likely GI blood loss, discussion as above.
.
6) Code: In discussion with patient, he wanted to be DNR, and
was leaning towards DNI, however said he would agree to a brief
intubation for a presumed reversible condition such as PNA, with
withdrawal of care if it appeared he wasn't going to be able to
come off the vent.
