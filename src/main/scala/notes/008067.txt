Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Mass in the body of the LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV cavity size. Normal regional LV
systolic function. Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta with no atherosclerotic plaque.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AR.


MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild MVP.
Eccentric MR jet. Mild to moderate ([**2-4**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild to
moderate [[**2-4**]+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
Physiologic (normal) PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PREBYPASS
A large (6.9x2.1cm) mobile mass is seen in the body of the left
atrium attached to the interatrial septum and prolapses into the
LV during diastole. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal
in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
mitral valve prolapse of the A2/A3 segment of the anterior
leaflet. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of Mild to
moderate ([**2-4**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

POSTBYPASS
There is preserved biventricular systolic function. The LA mass
is no longer visualized. The interatrial septum is intact and
there is no evidence of an ASD. There is a ring prosthesis in
the mitral annular position.The anterior MV leaflet no longer
prolapses. There is no MR [**Last Name (Titles) 53171**]. The study is otherwise
unchanged from prebypass.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   Evaluate PA catheter positioning



Final Report
HISTORY: For PA catheter position.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date,
there has
apparently been an attempt to advance the right IJ catheter. It
appears to
extend well into the IVC, before _____ back on itself so that
the tip is in
the pulmonary outflow tract. This information has been
telephoned to Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 6479**].

The endotracheal tube and nasogastric tubes have been removed.
Relatively
lower lung volumes with increased opacification at the left base
most likely
reflecting a combination of pleural fluid and atelectatic
change.

The gas-filled stomach has increased in size since the removal
of the
nasogastric tube.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**2128-9-10**] Mrs.[**Known lastname **] was taken to the OR by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **]
where she underwent LA mass/myxoma removal with pericardial
patch repair of atrial septum, and MV repair (#26 mm
annuloplasty ring). Please refer to Dr[**Doctor Last Name 14333**] operative
report for further details. She was transferred to the CVICU
intubated and hemodynamically stable. XCT:138min. CPB:160min.
She was extubated in a timely fashion. POD#1 she was transferred
to the SDU. All lines and drains were discontinued in a timely
fashion. Anticoagulation was star
