History of Present Illness:
The Pt. is a 57 y/o F with a PMH of hypertension,

presyncope. The pt went shopping day prior to transfer and
became suddenly dizzy after arriving home. The pt was unable to
recall if she had LOC or fell. Does not recall seizure activity.
States that she woke up later at home but was confused and did
not realize she was still in her home. Reports taking her
anti-seizure meds regularly except missed her Dilantin on
morning of admission. On arrival to OSH, she was loaded with
dilantin for possible seizure. She was found to have a Dilantin
level of 0.6. Her Head CT was negative for evidence of acute
process. She was found to have elevated CE, with Troponin of
0.22., CPK 534, MB 18, index of 3. She was started on aspirin,
Plavix, beta blocker and lovenox. TTE demonstrated  an echogenic
area in the apex consistent with clot, ventricular systolic
pressure of 48. MR, TR and anteroseptal and anterior wall
hypokinesis, and apical akinesis. EF 30%. The pt was placed on
aspiration precautions and seizure precautions. Pt was also
found to have bilateral lung infiltrate with question of PNA.
She was started on Zosyn for presumed on PNA. She also was found
to have a BNP 6073. Treated with IV lasix. Patient also with a
UTI, urine cx with >100,000 cfu/ml, no culture data. Per records
pt has been in SR without neuro symptoms since admit. No chest
pain/SOB.
.
On arrival to the floor, the patient is resting comfortably in
NAD.  Pt is poor historian on review. Pt denies frequent
sizures, last being few months ago. States she has been
complaint with her medications at home however does not recall
her medication lists. She lives by herself and states that she
feels she has become "too involved with her pain" over the past
few weeks. On ROS states she has had dysuria over past few days.

[**2193-4-4**] Chest x-ray: There is a subtle rounded area of opacity
in the superior segment of the left lower lobe. More inferiorly,
there is linear left lower lobe opacity and tenting of the
diaphragm consistent with volume loss. The left costophrenic
angle is blunted consistent with a small effusion or scarring.
The right lung appears clear. There is mild cardiomegaly. The
aorta is calcified and slightly tortuous. Pulmonary vasculature
is unremarkable.
[**2193-4-4**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with
inferior/inferolateral/distal LV akinesis. There is mild
hypokinesis of the remaining segments. Quantitative (biplane)
LVEF = 26%. A large (1.1 x 1.6 cm) thrombus is seen in the
distal/apical left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
[**2193-4-4**] Cardiac Cath: Selective coronary angiography revealed a
right dominant system with 50% hazy distal left main disease.
LAD had a hazy ostial lesion and was occluded mid vessel with
collaterals from the RCA. LCX was totally occluded proximally.
RCA had minimal disease.
[**2193-4-6**] Chest CT Scan: No prior imaging is available for
comparison. Diffuse emphysema is noted. Multiple bilateral
pulmonary nodules are identified. The largest is seen within the
left upper lobe on image 109 of series 4 and measures 16 x 12
mm. Also, a 10 x 14 mm somewhat spiculated appearing lesion is
seen within the left upper lobe on image #65 of series 4.
Numerous smaller lesions are also identified bilaterally. An
area of ill-defined opacity is within the left upper lobe on
image #51 of series 4. This is somewhat nonspecific imaging
finding and may represent a mild inflammation or infection. No
significant basilar opacity is seen to suggest aspiration
pneumonia. Mild pericardial effusion is seen. Scattered
subcentimeter mediastinal lymph nodes are identified.
[**2193-4-6**] Head CT Scan: 1. No intracranial hemorrhage or mass
effect. 2. Vascular calcifications. 3. Changes of chronic
microvascular ischemia and mild atrophy.
[**2193-4-8**] Rest Thallium: 1. Severe apical perfusion defect without
evidence of
redistribution at 24 hours. 2. Moderate inferolateral wall
perfusion defect
without redistribution at 24 hours. 3. Increased activity in the
anterolateral wall that may be due to the anterolateral
papillary muscle; however, it could also indicate more diffuse
disease with the anterolateral wall representing only normal
perfusion.
[**2193-4-8**] Carotid Ultrasound: 1. There is 60-69% stenosis within
the right internal carotid artery. 2. There is 40-59% stenosis
within the left internal carotid artery.
[**2193-4-8**] Lower Extremity Ultrasound/ABI: There is monophasic
waveform at femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial, and dorsalis
pedis arterial levels bilaterally. The right ABI is 0.50. The
left ABI is 0.83. Pulse volume recording shows dampened
amplitudes at all arterial levels evaluated bilaterally.
IMPRESSION: There is bilateral iliofemoral arterial disease.
