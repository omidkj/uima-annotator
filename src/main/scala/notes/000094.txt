ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

Upon presentation, patient's vital signs were 99.5, blood
pressure 100/53, heart rate 75, respiratory rate 20.  He was
on SIMV mechanical ventilation with pressure support.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON ADMISSION:  In general, he is a
young man in no apparent distress, intubated.  Pupils are
midline, equally reactive.  Oropharynx was moist.  Neck was
supple, no bruits.  Lungs:  Crackles diffusely, decreased

hematocrit 27, platelets 183.  Chem-7:  144 is the sodium,
potassium 3.7, chloride 114, bicarb 21, BUN 44, and
creatinine of 1, sugar of 154, lactate 1.8, INR 1.3, PTT
35.9.  He had multiple blood cultures.

On [**1-30**], he had a left subclavian central line culture that
showed no growth.  His MRSA screen on [**2159-1-29**] was negative.
Stool cultures were negative on [**1-27**].  Sputum culture on
[**1-25**] is negative.  Blood culture on [**1-15**] negative.  Urine

course in terms of issues:  Gastrointestinal:  His upper
gastrointestinal bleeding was evaluated by the
Gastroenterology Service.  They initially did not scope the
patient and given that his hematocrit stabilized.  During the
last couple days prior to discharge, they scoped him twice,
and both times determined that he had gastritis and
esophagitis in the lower [**12-1**] without any focal hemorrhage.
They recommended supportive care.

In terms of his presentation, a CT scan of his belly was
performed which showed free air as well as bowel wall
thickening around the cecum.  Surgery service was consulted,
and they elected to do a right hemicolectomy secondary to
diverticular disease.  A postoperative CT scan several days
later showed no anastomotic leak.  His GI course was
unremarkable as examination remained nontender, nondistended.

In terms of pulmonary issue, the patient was getting Zosyn
and gentamicin for presumptive pneumonia.  He had blood
cultures which had showed sparse growth of Pseudomonas last
month, but he was treated for an 11 day course.  In terms of
mechanical ventilation, he was on IMV with pressure support,
and then weaned off to pressure support and PEEP, pressure
support of 20 and PEEP of 10.

Chest x-rays had already showed some failure, i.e., pulmonary
edema.  However, the saturations always remained stable.
Cardiovascularly, he has always remained hemodynamically
stable of hypertension, and Lopressor was continued.

Infectious Disease:  He has never spiked a fever, though his
white blood cell count has been elevated as high as 30s in
the low 30s.  Fever never spiked.

Renal wise, given his fluid status on examination, he had
