Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation

Left internal jugular central venous line placement

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 80664**] is a 65-year-old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis,
DM, pneumonia who is transferred from [**Hospital6 5016**] for
evaluation of hepatopulmonary syndrome.

Admitted to the OSH on [**3-5**] with shortness of breath, he was
initially treated with Levaquin and Cetriaxone along with
steroids for COPD as this was felt to be most consistent with a
COPD exacerbation.

Given CT findings consistent with pulmonary fibrosis, thoracic
surgery was consulted and on [**3-14**] a bronchoscopy with washings,
RVATS RUL lung biopsy was performed.

Per the OSH notes, he appeared to have respiratory failure on
[**3-15**] with a PaO2 of 58.  He was not intubated at this time.
Worsening was felt to be due to CHF and hebwas diuresed with IV
lasix.  On [**3-18**] he was noted to have diarrhea.

On [**3-19**] he underwent an echo that showed an LVEF of 64% with
negative bubble study.  On [**3-26**] a PICC line was placed.  On [**3-27**]
he appeared more confused.  Transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] was arranged.

Studies:
[**2198-3-28**] ECG: Normal sinus rhythm. Normal tracing. No previous
tracing available for comparison.

[**2198-3-28**] ECHO: The left atrium is elongated. No thrombus/mass is
seen in the body of the left atrium. A patent foramen ovale is
present. A right-to-left shunt across the interatrial septum is
seen at rest. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. There is no valvular
aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is likely
related to high cardiac output. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Patent foramen ovale.

[**2198-3-28**] CXR - IMPRESSION: Retrocardiac opacity may represent
pneumonia or atelectasis.  Background interstitial lung disease.
Small left pleural effusion.

[**2198-3-28**] CXR - FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of
this date, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube that
has its tip at the top of the clavicles, approximately 7 cm
above the carina. The patient has taken a much better
inspiration. Opacification persists in the left mid and lower
lung zones.

[**2198-3-28**] Abdominal ultrasound - IMPRESSION:
1. Limited study due to respiratory motion. Portal venous system
appears
patent with reversed flow. Hepatic arterial and hepatic venous
systems are
grossly patent.
2. Small amount of ascites.
3. Heterogeneous, coarsened liver echotexture, consistent with
the patient's history of cirrhosis.
4. Cholelithiasis.

[**2198-3-28**] CXR - FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph,
all monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position. In
addition, a central venous access line has been inserted over
the left internal jugular vein. The tip projects over the mid
SVC. There is an increase of the retrocardiac opacity with air
bronchograms, suggestive of atelectasis. Otherwise, no relevant
changes. No pneumothorax.

[**2198-3-29**] Peritoneal fluid cytology:
 	NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
 	Few reactive mesothelial cells with histiocytes, lymphocytes
 	and neutrophils.

[**2198-3-29**] Cardiac Cath - COMMENTS:
1.  Resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated
right-sided
filling pressures with an RVEDP of 16 mmHg, mild pulmonary
arterial
hypertension with a PA pressure of 35/19 mmHg, and elevated left
ventricular filling pressures with a mean PCWP of 20 mmHg.
2.  Oximetry run did not demonstrate any evidence of
left-to-right
shunting.  Assuming an o
