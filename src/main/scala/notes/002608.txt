Brief Hospital Course:
55-year-old female with alcohol cirrhosis with known varices
(last variceal bleed 6 years ago) presenting from OSH with
hematemesis. Hospital course complicated by significant
encephalopathy.

1. Hematemesis: Pt with several episodes of hematemesis at home
and at OSH. She has been prescribed propranolol but was not been
taking this consistently at home.  Hct on admission was stable
at 39.  She was initially placed on IV PPI gtt and IV
octreotide. Initially, she was intubated for EGD which showed
varices at lower third of esophagus that was ligated as well as
varices at GE junction and fundus and portal gastropathy. She
did not have further episodes of hematemesis during hospital
stay and Hct remained stable. She completed a 7 day course of
ABX for infection prophylaxis. She was started on nadolol for
her varices. She should have repeat EGD as outpatient.

2. ST elevations: After being intubated for planned EGD, patient
had ST elevations on telemetry.  12 lead EKG revealed ST
elevations were in leads I/AVL with reciprocal depressions in
AVF/III.  She was seen urgently by cardiology and taken to
cardiac catheterization which revealed clean coronaries.  The
likely diagnosis was coronary vasospasm. TTE showed EF >  75%,
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved
global and regional biventricular systolic function. No
pathologic valvular abnormality seen. No further cardiac
complications during admission.

3. Altered Mental Status: Initially was admitted to the MICU for
GI bleeding reasons, but was sent to floor on [**3-29**]. However,
readmitted to the MICU on morning of [**3-31**] for worsening mental
status. Infection was ruled out. The patient's decompensation
was likely due to holding of lactulose, polypharmacy, and GI
bleed. CXR, LE U/S, Head CT, RUQ U/S were all unrevealing for
cause of AMS and all cultures of blood/urine were negative. She
was not placed on antibiotics and slowly cleared with aggressive
lactulose.  At discharge, she is alert and oriented x 3.

4. Alcoholic cirrhosis with alcoholic hepatitis: Pt with
alcoholic cirrhosis that decompensated due to GI bleed and
continued alcohol/drug use. Her bili started to trend up,
peaking at 4.4 on [**3-31**]. She was not started on steroids due to
GI bleed. A biopsy was not done. The patient was treated with
aggressive nutrition and her bilirubin trended down on
discharge.

5. Polysubstance abuse: Pt had active alcohol abuse.  Urine tox
was also positive for methadone and benzos.  She was seen by
social work and addictions consult.  She was started on MVI,
thiamine, and folic acid.  She initially had significant alcohol
withdrawal and required high doses of IV ativan and haloperidol
that was eventually weaned. The patient had family support
throughout her hospital stay.

6. COPD: Pt with questionable hx of COPD.
