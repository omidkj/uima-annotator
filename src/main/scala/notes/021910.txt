History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 53 year old female with a past medical history
of renal-pancreas transplant ([**2137**]) on azathioprine,
cyclosporine, prednisone, type I diabetes complicated by
retinopathy, autonomic dysfunction, chronic renal insufficiency
(cr 1.3-.16) who presents with chills and fever. She was in her
normal state of health until yesterday, when she returned home
from shopping with her daughter she felt chills. She went to bed
and when she awoke in the middle of the night she felt feverish
(did not take temperature), myalgia, headache but no photophobia
or neck stiffness, "like I had the flu." She got up and tried to
use her walker but slumped to the floor due to weakness (hx of
gait instability). She crawled back to bed. Her daughter went to
her house earlier this morning and brought her to the ED,
possibly thought she was more confused per report. She denies
cough, shortness of breath, dysuria, abdominal pain, diarrhea.
Endorses nausea but no vomitting. Daughter recently had a cold
but no other sick contacts.

In the ED, initial vs were: 105.8 178/64 120s 18 97%RA.
Non-focal exam. Daughter reported her mental status is at
baseline. Labs notable for WBC of 1.8, creatinine of 1.9
(baseline 1.6.-1.8). Renal transplant aware. Given tylenol and
cool IVF. Plan to transfer to floor then systolic blood pressure
dropped to 70s. Left IJ placed. Got vancomycin, cefepime,
solucortef 100mg IV. Given 5L of fluid. Being started on
levophed. Vitals on transfer to the MICU: 76/44, 87, 16, 99%.
Left IJ, PIV.
.
In the MICU, she reported feeling much better compared to
earlier this morning. Denied headache, nuchal rigidity.  The
patient's blood pressure stabilized following initiation of
levophed at 116/52.  Her antibiotics were changed to vanco,
zosyn and levoflox.  Her high dose steroids were rapidly tapered
to Prednisone 30mg daily.  The patient was restarted on home
midodrine.  Blood, urine cultures pending on transfer.  Viral
swab negative for flu.

CXR:
FINDINGS: AP portable view of the chest is obtained. Low lung
volumes limit evaluation. There is, however, no evidence of
pneumonia or CHF. Overlying EKG leads are noted. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal. No pleural effusion
or pneumothorax is seen. The visualized osseous structures
appear intact. Clips are noted in the right upper quadrant.
Imaged upper abdominal bowel loops are notable for marked fecal
loading.
IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
.
NON-CONTRAST CT ABDOMEN:
1. Right lower quadrant renal transplant with nonspecific
neighboring
stranding. The ureter is dilated as seen on prior examinations,
likely secondary to post-surgical reflux. There are no
intra-abdominal and intrapelvic fluid collections seen.
2. Moderate bibasilar atelectasis.
3. A very large amount of stool within the colon. There is no
bowel
obstruction. Lack of IV contrast limits the evaluation for
ischemia.
