ADDENDUM:  This discharge addendum is to continue where a
previous discharge summary ended.

HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY:  After resolution of Ms. [**Known lastname 47365**]
acute on chronic renal failure, she was transferred to the
medical floor in good condition.  It was at this time that
she had noted some right hip pain, and as she has a history
of multiple falls, plain films were obtained to further
evaluate this symptom.

The x-rays demonstrated a fracture of the right iliac bone
involving the anterior superior iliac spine.  The Orthopedic
Service was contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding possible stabilization of
this fracture, however, they admitted that there was nothing
that could be done with this type of fracture.  A follow-up
CT scan was recommended secondary to some pathologic
fractures and lytic lesions demonstrated at that area.  The
follow-up CT scan showed a lytic lesion involving the right
iliac bone and the sacrum with several areas of pathologic
fractures.  There were soft tissue masses noted to be
surrounding the right iliac bone.

A skeletal survey demonstrated no other areas of fractures,
dislocations, lytic or sclerotic lesions.  An MRI without
contrast was obtained to further delineate the possibility of
soft tissue involvement.  These results were consistent with
expansion of the medullary cavity of the right ileum.  The
multiple fractures within the iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**] were visualized.

The Hematology/Oncology Service was contact[**Name (NI) **] and agreed with
obtaining tissue from the soft tissue lesion prior to making
a decision regarding aggressiveness of care.  This was
discussed with the family and the family was in agreement
with this plan.

The CT-guided biopsy was unable to be performed while the
patient was admitted.  Further workup for this soft tissue
mass will be determined by the patient's primary care
physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] note, an SPEP and UPEP were sent and the
results were negative.

Although the right hip pain was not present at rest, this
area gave the patient significant discomfort.

PHYSICIAN [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]:  Ms. [**Known lastname 47363**] will need to be followed
by her primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **], while she is at

soft tissue mass can occur at that time.  A CT-guided biopsy
will be the next step in the patient's overall evaluation.
