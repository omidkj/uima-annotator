No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 896**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, Abdominal pain, SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
hemodialysis

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 43-year-old man with HIV, Hep C,
cardiomyopathy, hypertension, polysubstance abuse including
cocaine in addition to membranous GN (MPGN from Hep C) now ESRD
on HD (T/Th/Sat, last on Saturday), heavy smoker who presented
to the ED with abdominal pain, fever, dyspnea.
.
Pt reports he was in his usualy state of health until this
morning at 2am when he awoke feeling SOB. His BP at that time
was "very high." and he had abdominal pain. Notes 5 bm
yesterday, formed stool with no blood. He reported to the ED. He
had missed some of his doses of his blood pressure medications.

.
In the ED, initial VS were: T 102.9, BP 179/95, HR 110, RR 23,
98% RA. Given 1g tylenol, ASA 325, 5mg IV morphine, Vancomycin
1g, ceftriazone 1g, azithromycin 500mg IV.
Labs in ED: WBC 10, HCT 27, PLT 211. INR 1.1, PTT 34. Na 142, K
4.5, Cl 105, HCO3 20, BUN 70, Cr 7.3, glucose 112. ALT 13, AST
19, AP 105, TBilli 0.2, Alb 4, lipase 48, Ca 8.3, Mg 2.2, Phos
4.
CXR showed RLL pna. CT abd performed for abd pain.
.
The patient was sent directly to dialysis for HD session since
he was 4 kilograms above his dry weight.  Per fellow, he had
episode of small hemoptysis, confirmed by RN. However, according
to patient, he felt it was from the grape juice he was given
earlier in the day. Denies any history of hemoptysis. While in
HD, patient became suddenly hypertensive up to the 200s/120s and
has sudden acute worsening of his dyspnea, RR 40s, hypoxemic
satting in 70s on RA. Concern for flash pulmonary edema. He
continued HD to remove 4-5 L fluid. He was given a nebulizer
with no improvement. Placed on non-rebreather and satting in
93-95%. He looked uncomfortable, sitting upright, using
accessory muscle use to breath. Vitals in HD on initial
evaluation of patient 226/128, HR 136, RR 40s, satting mid 90s
on non-rebreather.  While in HD he was given hydralazine 10mg IV
(did not improve BP), tylenol 325mg, Epo 7600, Zemplar 3mcg,
topical nitro-paste 1.2 inch, Lopressor 5mg IV. Then given
nitropaste 0.5 inch and BP improved to 160s. Vitals prior to
transfer to MICU: BP 161/102, HR 124. Following his dialysis,
the patient felt substantially better and was breathing more
easily.
.
In the MICU, the patient's vitals were T 98.7 HR 116 BP 179/90
RR 23 98% 3L. He complained of pain in his jaw, neck, hips, and
left upper quadrant on exam. The patient did think that he was
breathing more freely than the event in hemodialysis.

In MICU, pt's hypertension was controlled with nitro drip,
carvedilol, clonidine, nifedipine, hydral and terazosin.
.
On transfer to medicine, his vitals are 97.8, 146/86, 102, 21
98% 2L. He reports that he is still having some hemoptysis and
he was complaining of continued RUQ pain. Pt reports that he
thinks his pain has been inadequately controlled. He is
currently being dialysed.

IMPRESSION:
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism or aortic pathology.
2. Enlarged main pulmonary artery suggestive of pulmonary
arterial
hypertension.
3. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
4. Right middle and right lower lobe opacifications concerning
for pneumonia
on a background of pulmonary edema.
5. Small right pleural effusion, periportal and pericholecystic
edema as well
as hazy mesentery, unchanged compared to [**2129-4-22**] and likely
due to HIV
diagnosis.
6. Nonspecific bowel wall thickening in distal ileum likely
exaggerated by
collapse, though a mild ileitis is a consideration.

Echo
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is elongated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed (LVEF= 40-50 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade II (moderate)
left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.

[**4-14**]
CXR

There has been interval improvement of pulmonary edema,
substantial with only
minimal residual Kerley B lines demonstrated. Right lower lung
opacity is
still present, consistent with known right middle lobe and right
lower lobe
infectious process. Mild vascular engor
