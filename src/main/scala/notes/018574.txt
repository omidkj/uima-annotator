IMAGING:

[**7-4**] RUQ Ultrasound
IMPRESSION: 1. Diffusely echogenic liver is most consistent with
fatty deposition although more advanced liver disease such as
cirrhosis and/or fibrosis cannot be excluded. 2. No evidence of
acute cholecystitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
65 year old male with hx of DM2, CAD, ischemic cardiomyopathy
with LVEF 30-35% p/w diaphoresis, acute onset of nausea and
lightheadedness and was found to have UTI, [**Last Name (un) **], and hypotension
which responded to fluids in the MICU. Patient has been
hemodynamically stable since.

# UTI: Will complete a 7-day course of ciprofloxacin 500mg Q12H
for complicated UTI (male). Dysuria improved.

# [**Last Name (un) **]: Resolved with IVF. Etiology prerenal azotemia, in the
context of exertion and glucosuria. Creatinine trended back to
baseline by time of discharge.

# Transaminitis: Fatty liver on RUQ ultrasound, however
cirrhosis or fibrosis cannot be ruled out. Hepatitis serologies
negative. Recommended outpatient liver followup.

# CAD w/Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: LVEF 30-35%. Troponin negative
x 2. No chest pain. Continued aspirin, metoprolol, lisinopril,
atorvastatin and isosorbide mononitrate SR. Held HCTZ, can
discuss restarting with PCP.

# IDDM: Continued home lantus 25 units qAM in addition to
supplemental HISS once patient started eating. Metformin held
while in-house.

# History of Afib: Metoprolol switched from home metoprolol
succinate to metoprolol tartrate for closer BP control while
in-house; switched back to metoprolol succinate on discharge.
Coumadin was held in the context of supratherapeutic INR (3.6).

# Supratherapeutic INR: Possibly secondary to liver injury.
Coumadin was held & INR monitored closely.

# Asthma: Continued Flovent as needed.

# DVT Prophylaxis: Systemic anticoagulation (INR 3.6).

# Code status: Full code.
