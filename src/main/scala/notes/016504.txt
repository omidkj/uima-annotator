History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 82433**] is a 57 year old female with a past medical history
significant asthma, HTN, and a recent admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]
service for hypertensive urgency and shortness of breath now
admitted to the MICU for dyspnea on CPAP. The patient was
initially admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] from [**Date range (1) 82616**] after presenting to
her PCP for [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 82617**] cough and worsening shortness of
breath with a BP 200/100.  At that time, ECG demonstrate TWI in
the precordial leads. He was ruled out for ACS and felt to have
hypertension and a reactive airways disease component that led
to her wheezing.  She presented to [**Company 191**] on [**1-29**] for follow-up,
and at that time had a clear lung exam but noted chronic 2
pillow orthopnea. This morning, the patient reports that she
awoke with shortness of breath, subjective fevers, wheeze,
productive cough of white/yellowish sputum, and fatigue. She
denies any CP, palpitations, abdominal pain, diarrhea, sick
contacts, or recent travel.  Per EMS, the patient received a
combivent neb without benefit and was placed on CPAP.

vancomycin 1 gram, and levofloxacin 750. She was continued on
CPAP with an FiO2 0.4 with an ABG demonstrating 7.39/44/100.
She was then admitted to the MICU for further management.

Radiology:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)	Study Date of [**2131-2-2**] 4:39 AM
Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2-1**].

Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. The lungs are
essentially clear.
There is no appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax noted.
There is
prominence of the hila bilaterally which might potentially
represent large
pulmonary arteries, and hypertension as a result might be
considered.
.
TRAUMA #3 (PORT CHEST ONLY)	Study Date of [**2131-2-1**] 8:55 PM
FINDINGS: AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.
Subtle
increased opacity projecting over the right lower lobe could
relate to
aspiration or early infectious process. Consider dedicated PA
and lateral
views when patient able for further evaluation. The left lung is
clear. No
pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and
mediastinal
silhouettes are unremarkable. Calcification is noted at the
aortic knob. No
overt pulmonary edema is seen.

IMPRESSION: Subtle increase in opacity projecting over the right
lower lobe,
underlying mild infectious process or aspiration cannot be
entirely excluded
in the appropriate clinical setting. Suggest dedicated PA and
lateral views
if patient able.

Cardiology:
ECG	Study Date of [**2131-2-1**]  9:00:24 PM

Normal sinus rhythm with right bundle-branch block. Non-specific
ST-T wave
abnormalities. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2131-1-27**].
