History of Present Illness:
 52 yo female with h/o breast ca s/p mastectomy and
AC+tamoxifen, h/o diverticulosis, who presents with BRBPR for
approximately 24 hours. On the evening on the second, the
patient had significant diarrhea after having had a lactose meal
earlier in the day, and noted some blood at the end of her BM.
The following morning, on [**6-29**], the patient had loose, water
stool which had about [**12-30**] cup blood and a large clot. Later that
AM, around 11, she had another BM which was mostly blood and
clots as well. At 3 PM, and 3:30, she had 2 more BMs which were
mostly bloody, and some clots. She could not fully quantify the
amount at that time. She decided to drive home, but felt
lightheaded and had blurry vision, so she called EMS to bring
her to the ED. She denies any abdominal pain, but she does
report some slight burning in her lower abdomen. She states that
she has not been constipated recently, denies any nausea or
vomiting up until this afternoon. She felt nauseous on the way
to the ED, then in the ED, vomited prior to NGL. She denies any
hematemesis. She reports that in the last few weeks, she noted
very slight pink tinge on the toilet paper after a BM, but has
never had significant bleeding such as this before.

In the ED, vitals were 98.3 115 16/56 20 100% 4L . Prior to NGL
attempt, the patient vomited significant amount of food, but no
hematemsis. She was HD stable throughout her ED course. 2 large
bore IVs were started and she was started on 1 unit pRBC prior
to transfer. GI was consulted in the ED and recommended nuc med
scan.

IMAGING
-------
1) CHEST (PORTABLE AP) ([**2102-6-29**])

FINDINGS: The lungs are clear without consolidation or edema.
The
mediastinum is unremarkable. The cardiac silhouette is within
normal limits
for size. No effusion, pneumothorax, or free air under the
diaphragm is
identified. The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process.

2) GI Bleeding Scan ([**2102-6-29**])
RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL DATA:
14.7 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m RBC ([**2102-6-29**]);
INTERPRETATION: Following intravenous injection of autologous
red blood cells labeled with Tc-99m, blood flow and dynamic
images of the abdomen for 90 minutes were obtained. A left
lateral view of the pelvis was also obtained.
Blood flow images show dynamic radiotracer activity within the
vascular
structures. Dynamic blood pool images show no abnormal tracer
accumulation.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of active GI bleeding during the time of
study.

Medications: fentanyl 175 micrograms
Midazolam 4.5 mg IV

Indications: GI Bleeding


Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential
complications were explained to the patient, who indicated her
understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms. A
physical exam was performed. The patient was administered
conscious sedation. Supplemental oxygen was used. The patient
was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and the
colonoscope was introduced through the rectum and advanced under
direct visualization until the terminal ileum was reached. The
cecal sling folds were seen. The appendiceal orifice and
ileo-cecal valve were identified. Careful visualization of the
colon was performed as the colonoscope was withdrawn. The
colonoscope was retroflexed within the rectum. The procedure was
not difficult. The quality of the preparation was fair.
Visualization of the ascending colon and sigmoid colon was poor.
The patient tolerated the procedure well. The digital exam was
abnormal. Hemorhoids. There were no complications.
Findings:
 Contents: Red blood and clotted blood was seen in the sigmoid
colon, descending colon, transverse colon and ascending colon.
The clotted blood was flushed, but no bleeding source could be
located.
 Protruding Lesions Small non-bleeding grade 1 internal &
external hemorrhoids were noted.
 Excavated Lesions Several diverticula with medium openings were
seen in the sigmoid colon and ascending colon.Diverticulosis
appeared to be of mild severity. No single bleeding diverticulum
was found.
Impression: Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and ascending
colon
Grade 1 internal & external hemorrhoids
Blood in the sigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse colon
and ascending colon
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to terminal ileum
Recommendations: Repeat HCT on arrival to the floor.
Continue to monitor serial HCTs overnight.
If she has additional bleeding, the best step would be
angiography. We suspect a right-sided diverticular bleed, but a
sigmoid diverticular bleed is possible as well.
Please follow-up with either Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1158**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 679**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 682**], or in
[**Location (un) **] with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2987**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2986**] in [**2-28**] weeks.
Additional notes: The procedure was performed by the GI fellow
and attending.


Brief Hospital Course:
##. Hematochezia: Pt was admitted for a 2 day history of
hematochezia with lightheadedness. Upon admission to the ER pt
was noted to be anemic secondary to blood loss and was
transferred to the ICU where she received 5 units of packed red
blood cells. Whilst in the ICU a tagged RBC was performed and
showed no active bleeding. Prior to discharge day pt was
transferred to the floor where a colonoscopy revealed showed
extensive diverticular disease extending up into the ascending
colon with fresh blood. On the day of discharge pt showed a
stabe Hct x 72hours and was able to tolerate a PO diet with
gross rebleeding.

##. HTN: During hospitalization pt was continued on her home
regimen of blood pressure medications and remained normotensive.


##. H/o breast cancer: During hospitalization pt was continued
on her home regimen of Femara.
