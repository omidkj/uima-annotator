EXT: Warm, well perfused, no edema, 2+ pulses, no varicosities.

Pertinent Results:
[**2147-9-21**] ECHO
Pre-procedure: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left
atrial
appendage. Right ventricular systolic function is normal. LV
systolic fxn is moderately depressed, with akinetic apex, and
hypokinesis especially of the inferior, infero-septal and
infero-lateral walls. There are simple atheroma in the ascending
aorta. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are
three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The patient was done "off pump" because
of hematuria.
Post procedure: Biventricular systolic fxn is essentially
unchanged. No AI, trace MR, aorta intact.
[**2147-9-25**] CXR
Improved aeration of lung bases. Still present small left
pleural effusion. No evidence of failure

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for surgical management. GU service were consulted secondary to
hematuria (also followed pt during post-op course). He had all
pre-operative work-up done prior to surgery and was brought to
the operating room on [**8-20**] where he underwent a coronary artery
bypass graft x 4 (off-pump). Please see operative report for
surgical details. Following surgery he was transferred to the
CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. Within 24
hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact
and extubated. On post-op day one he was started on beta
blockers and diuretics. He was gently diuresed towards his
pre-op weight. Also on this day his chest tubes were removed and
he was transferred to the SDU for further care. Epicardial
pacing wires were removed on post-op day three. Later on this
day she had episode of atrial fibrillation which was
appropriately treated. She remained in sinus rhythm through
discharge but remained on amiodarone. She continued to slowly
improve while working with physical therapy over the next two
days. On post-op day five he was discharged home with VNA
services and the appropriate follow-up appointments.
