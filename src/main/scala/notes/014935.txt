Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6195**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
R IJ placement

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 10936**] is a 54 yo man with ESRD on home PD, CAD s/p MI with
3-vessel disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 20%, who
presents with hypotension. Mr. [**Known lastname 10936**] reports that for the past
3-4 days he has been noting mild cough productive of white
sputum. He has also noticed that his blood pressure, which is
baseline systolic was 80 systolic today. He did feel light
headeded but denies loss of consciousness or neausea. He denies
any respiratory distress, fevers, urinary symptoms, focal pain,
abdominal pain, nausea, vomitting, or other localizing symptoms.
Baseline exercise tolerance is ~1 block and unchanged recently.
Baseline 1-pillow orthopnea is also unchanged. He does endorse
slight increase in chronic LE edema
.
In the ED, initialy VS: BP 60/44, O2 90% RA in triage, but first
set of VS in core BP 121/101, RR 19, HR 72, T 98.3.
He was given 1.5L NS. CXR did not demonstrate any significant
change from prior. Exam was without localizing features apart
from an elevated JVP. LIJ was placed and norepinephrine started.
Vancomycin 1 g and zosyn 4.5 g were also administered as well as
10 mg dexamethasone. Urine and blood cultures were sent. Bedside
echo demonstrated global hypokinesis, thought to be similar to
prior. EKG showed ST depressions in v3-v6 and new QW in II, new
from prior. Labs were notable for trop elevated above baseline
but no CK elevation. Cardiology was consulted. They felt that
this was either demand ischmia or a missed cardiac event. They
recommended Plavix and [**Known lastname **], which were given, but no
heparinization unless CK became elevated. Subsequent EKGs were
unchanged.
VS prior to transfer (on .09 of norepinephrine): HR 78, BP
104/85, 20, 97% 4L, CVP 26
.


Past Medical History:

Unasyn. He was sent home on Keflex for a total 14 day course of
antibiotics. No other positive culture data.

- Cardiac surgery planed for surgery pending resolution of
medical issues
- during admission [**1-26**] for sepsis, pt noted to have demand
ischemia with CK peaking at 647 and troponin 1.59.
# Systolic CHF: ECHO [**1-26**] showed EF 20 % with hypokinesis of
the inferior septum and lateral wall; akinesis of the posterior
wall.
# Polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **]
# PVD
# HTN
# h/o Osteomyelitis of R 5th metatarsal in [**2128**]
# Eosinophilic gastritis
# Stoke in [**2123**] with right hand weakness, resolved on its own

CXR:
Comparison is made with prior study performed six hours earlier.

Cardiomegaly is grossly unchanged. Right IJ catheter tip is in
the SVC. Left
lower lobe retrocardiac opacities have improved consistent with
improved
atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. The component of mild
pulmonary edema
has resolved. There is persistent right lower lobe opacity
consistent with
aspiration or pneumonia. If any, there is a small right pleural
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
54 year old man with 3VD, CHF, recent sepsis, ESRD on PD, DM1,
admitted with hypotension.
.
# Hypotension: Differential includes cardiogenic vs distributive
vs hypovolemic causes. Among cardiogenic causes, this may
represent an acute exacerbation of his chronic CHF or a new
cardiac event. He may be septic, although afebrile and without
localizing signs or symptoms. CXR with possible RLL infiltrate,
not impressive.. Awaiting urine. Foot does not appear infected.
Regarding the possibility of hypovolemic shock, he may be
over-dialyzed. He does state that he has noticed a decrease in
his weight and poor PO intake.
.
On admission to the MICU, levophed was quickly weaned off.  BP
was initially 110s but trended down to the 90s.  He received an
additional 500cc of IVF.
.
SVCO2 was 77%, arguing against heart failure. TTE was ordered to
further evaluate.  For the possibility of sepsis, vancomycin and
piperacillin-tazobactem were started but discontinued after
there was no evidence of sepsis. Blood, urine, PD fluid, sputum
cultures, stool for c diff if diarrhea were ordered.  Lactate
was down trending.  He was given stress-dose steroids.  Most
likely was a combination of poor systolic function, poor PO
intake, and adrenal insufficiency.

# EKG changes: Patient has known 3VD and systolic dysfunction
with EF 20% with new QW on EKG. Although troponin was elevated
significantly above baseline, CK was not. This likely
represented a recent cardiac event with CK now resolved and
troponin trending down.  Bedside echo in ED without clear
evidence of new WMA. Official TTE was ordered.  Per cardiology
recommendations in [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] and Plavix were continued and no
heparinization.  Metoprolol and ACE were held given hypotension.
.
He likely also had demand ischemia in the ED related to poor
perfusion pressures with shock.  Cardiac enzymes were trended.

.
# ESRD: c/b failed renal transplant, on nocturnal PD. No urgent
indication for dialysis on admission, although BUN/creatinine
higher than previously in OMR, likely secondary to missing HD
the night prior. Renal was consulted and PD started.  Sensipar,
calcitriol, renagel were continued. Per renal recommendation,
cyclosporin was discontinued.
.
# Anion gap: AG 19, from [**2-1**] previously. Likely secondary to
renal failure and mildly elevated lactate.
.
# Diabetes type I:  He was given home dose of insulin lantus and
humalog sliding scale.
.
Patient stated his desire to be full code.
