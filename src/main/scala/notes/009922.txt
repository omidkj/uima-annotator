Imaging:
[**2109-3-19**] echo
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is a small pericardial effusion. There
are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2109-2-28**],
criteria for elevated LVEDP are not seen on the current study.
The other findings are similar.
.
[**2109-3-20**] CT head
 The ventricles and sulci are unremarkable. There is no evidence
of
acute hemorrhage or shift of normally midline structures. There
is normal
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation. There is no evidence of large
acute
vascular territorial infarct. Aerosolized secretions in the left
sphenoid
sinus are noted.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute hemorrhage. Sphenoid sinus
disease.
.
[**3-21**] Renal ultrasound:
Increased echogenicity of the renal cortex consistent with
medical renal disease. No evidence for renal artery stenosis.

Labs on discharge:
**************


Brief Hospital Course:
35 year old woman who is G7P4, status post C-section on [**2-28**] at
28 weeks for preeclampsia who presents with hypertensive urgency
and acute renal failure.
.
# Hypertensive urgency:  Patient initially presented with SBP to
200s requiring labetalol drip and was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
initially. She was evaluated by Ob/Gyn in whose assessment was
that this is not consistent with post-partum preeclampsia and
was likely unrelated to the pregnancy. She was weaned off
labetalol drip and oral medications have been titrated.  Renal
ultrasound was negative for renal artery stenosis.  She was
followed by Nephrology throughout her hospitalization.  Blood
pressure medications were gradually adjusted and added until her
blood pressure remained under relatively good control.  Her
final regimen consisted of HCTZ, labetalol, nifedipine and
methyldopa.  Her medications were chosen based on the fact that
she hoped to continue to breastfeed her child and wanted meds
that were safe in lactation.  At the time of discharge she did
not have any complaints of dizziness/lightheadedness, headache,
vision changes or nausea.  The patient will follow up next week
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in nephrology clinic.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure:  Creatinine was up to 2.9 on
this admission, up from 1.9 during the previous admission when
she had c-section for preeclampsia. Renal ultrasound showed no
hydronephrosis.  FENa was 4.7 on admission. Renal consultants
assessed the patient and renal failure was thought secondary to
longstanding essential hypertension which was acutely worsened
by her preeclampsia.
The patient has a strong family history of essential
hypertension at young ages.  Patient's renal function remained
relatively stable and was 2.8 on discharge.  She has follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2109-4-2**].
.
# Headache:  HTN urgency was contributing.  Head CT was
negative, as above.  Resolved with improved blood pressure
control.  Tylenol was given prn.
.
# UTI, bacterial: finished course of antibiotics in house.
.
# Anemia: Likely due to renal insufficiency, recent C-section.
Iron studies, B12, folate were within normal limits.
.
# Anxiety/Depression:  continued lexapro.
.
# Dispo: Pt was discharged in stable condition.  The patient is
originally from [**Location (un) 3844**] but is try to move her medical
care into the area and is in the midst of researching local
PCPs.  I gave the patient the phone number for [**Company 191**] in case she
chose to establish care there.
