History of Present Illness:
HPI: 58 yo woman w/ h/o afib s/p ablation, chf(ef55%), htn,
breast ca who was just d/c'd yesterday([**12-26**]) afternoon w/ dx of
PNA and PAF on amiodarone load with coumadin and levofloxacin
after being treated with ceftriaxone/azithro while in house.
Returns to the ED with episode of acute onset of SOB, unable to
get breath, she tried to go to bed and went to bed around
midnight, but remained SOB and dry cough ('felt I was drowning')
around 1:30am also felt 'I was in afib with very fast heart
rate'. SOB improved with sitting up. Pt reported 2 lb weight
gain from Friday to Sat. No LE edema. Denied chest pain,
palppitations.
.
On way to [**Name (NI) **], pt received 100mg lasix, in ED, found to have
BP200's, with heart rate 100 initially in afib but subsquently
converted to sinus spontaneously. Temp 99.8, and O2sat 80's in
RA, RR50's was placed on nitro gtt and CPAP initially, BP
subsquently dropped to 80's/30's, stopped nitro gtt. Pt was
placed on 4L O2 NC improvment in sats to 99% and 250cc bolus and
then started on dopamine.
.
While in ED remained hypotensive as HR 110's and was started on
dopamine peripherally again at 2.5-5mcg/kg/min.  She has
diuresed about 1700 UOP since arrival.  As dopamine taken off,
HR improved and converted to NSR in 80's.  Then she started
rigoring and spiked a temp to 103.  She was transferred to the
MICU for close monitoring and a dopamine drip that was quickly
weaned off.

.
Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is borderline
left ventricular  hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Due to suboptimal  technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.  Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve  leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic  regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened.  Probably moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen (views suboptimal; seen  well in
apical 3 chamber view only). The left ventricular inflow pattern
 suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left
atrial  pressure. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a  trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2148-9-13**],
mitral
regurgitation is now more prominent (as visualized in the apical
3 chamber  view). Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is now higher.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 58 yo woman w/ h/o afib s/p ablation, h/o chf, htn, breast
ca, recent admission with LLL PNA and afib w/ RVR admitted with
increased shortness of breath and now fevers and hypotension.
.
.
Respiratory Distress: Ultimately it was felt that her symptoms
developed from her underlying pneumonia and an episode of rapid
atrial-fibrillation that caused pulmonary edema.  She was
diuresed with good effect with IV furosemide and a two gram
sodium diet.
Her antibiotic coverage was transitioned from levofloxacin to
azithromycin.  Urine and blood cultures failed to grow anything
and she was initially febrile, early in the hospital course,
despite antibiotic treament.  She was, however, afebrile, during
the forty-eight hours prior to discharge on azithromycin.  She
continued to cough intermittently, but this was well controlled
with benzonatate.
.
Hypotension: Occuring in the ED and resolving by the time she
reached the MICU, her hypotension, although originally felt due
to septic physiology, was ultimately thought to be secondary to
overdiuresis and anti-hypertensive therapy while in the ED.
Once her fluid status and heart rate were optimized, she
remained normotensive for the rest of the admission.
.
PAF:  She was continued on her amiodarone load with good effect,
as she remained in sinus rhythm for the rest of the admission.
Warfarin was also continued.  She was discharged on her home
dose of amiodarone 200mg daily.
