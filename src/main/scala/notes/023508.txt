Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**]
Chief Complaint:
BRBPR


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
86 yo f with h/o schizophrenia, DM, HTN, CHF (EF unknown), who
has a h/o of a GI bleed approx 1 year ago presents with BRBPR.
Per [**Hospital1 1501**] report the BRBPR started on [**2190-2-2**].  She had increased
bleeding per rectum this morning and she was noted to be less
animated and interactive than usual.  She has not had any other
complaints or any vital sign abnormalities.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 98.5 77 142/45 18 100%ra.  In the
ED, she was hemodynamically stable, alert and oriented to person
only.  Her belly exam revealed a ventral hernia, but was
non-tender and rectal exam showed maroon colored stools that
were guaiac positive.  Her Hct was down to 23, last Hct in our
system was 30 in [**6-13**].  Surgery was consulted to evaluate for
strangulated hernia.  Surgery felt there was no evidence of
ischemic gut or strangulated hernia. CT a/p was also negative
for bowel ischemia.  She was seen by GI consult who felt that
doing a colonoscopy in the AM would be reasonable if consistent
with patient's goals of care.  Patient was given protonix 80mg
IV x1, Zyprexa 2.5mg PO for agitation, 2 units of PRBCs and 1L
of IVF.  VS prior to transfer 101 152/72 16 99% ra.
.
In the ICU, she appears comfortable.  Her speech is garbled,
likely has dentures at [**Hospital1 1501**].  She answers questions
appropriately.  She does not know why she is in hospital.  She
denies any particular complaints.

Studies:
CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2190-2-6**] 10:07 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Large periumbilical ventral hernia containing large bowel and
fluid. No evidence for obstruction or incarceration.
2. Diverticulosis.
3. Probable left renal simple cyst.
4. Small 5-mm right lower lobe pulmonary nodule. This may have
been seen on the prior study. Attention on follow-up.
5. Unchanged L3 compression fracture.


Brief Hospital Course:
86 yo f with h/o schizophrenia, DM, HTN, CHF (EF unknown), who
has a h/o of a GI bleed approx 1 year ago presents with BRBPR.
.
# Acute blood loss anemia: Most probably a lower GIB given
hematochezia for 3 days prior to admission.  She was monitored
in the MICU overnight and she remained hemodynamically stable
making it likely a slow bleed.  The possible etiologies include
diverticuli, hemorrhoids, AVM and colon cancer.  Her baseline
Hct was uncertain. Prior value in our system was 30 6 months
ago, and on admission her HCT was 23.  Per her guardian, she has
had GIB managed conservatively in the past.  She received 2
units of PRBCs overnight with an appropriate bump from 23 to 28,
and subsequently dropped to 25.5 and was given an additional
unit of PRBCs prior to transfer to the general medical floor
(total 3 units PRBC). IV access was established with 2 PIVs.
.
# Ventral Hernia: Long standing. Surgery was consulted initially
out of concern for possible strangulation or incarceration.
However, on exam she denied pain and did not exhibit tenderness.
A CT abd/pelvis was done that showed no evidence of
strangulation or obstruction.
.
# Schizophrenia: She was alert and tangential in the MICU. Her
speech was slightly garbled, however she has dentures at which
were not with her, and oral thrush that was likely contributing
to the picture. She followed commands and answered questions
appropriately. Standing zyprexa QHS was continued and a smaller
dose prn for agitation was added.
.
# Cardiomyopathy: EF unknown, she appeared dry to euvolemic.
lasix, aspirin, and atenolol were held for potential
instability. Her statin was restarted.
.
# DM: While in the ICU she was covered with ISS. Held prandin
and glipizide.
.
# Acute on Chronic kidney disease (Stage III):
Baseline cr not entirely clear, but improvements in Cr suggest
ARF on admission. Her Cr peaked at 1.7 (admission), and improved
to 1.2 at the time of discharge. Given her improvements in renal
failure and unclear baseline, and the probable ARF on admission,
her lasix was continued to be held at the time of discharge, but
would recommend resuming in another 1-2 days as her clinical
condition continues to improve.

# Urinary incontinence: Her Detrol was held during this
hospitalization, as foley was initially in place.  Her Detrol
was held on discharge to see if she can remain off of this
medication, as the anticolinergic effects have the potential to
be problem[**Name (NI) 115**] in this elderly female with cognitive and
psychiatric impairments.

# Pulmonary nodule: noted incidentially on CT scan. She will
need outpatient follow-up.

# Osteoporosis: continued calcium, vit D and calcitriol.
