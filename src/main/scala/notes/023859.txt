Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 1726**] was admitted to surgical service and taken to the OR
on [**2121-11-14**]. He tolerated his procedure (see operative note for
full details). He was transferred to the post anesthesia care
unit for recovery and then to the intensive care unit. He was on
a mechanical ventilator, with IVF , a foley and monitoring with
central line pressures and with ABGs. He received several
boluses of IVF and albumin and repletions of his electrolytes.

On [**2121-11-16**] he had a chest xray which showed As compared to the
previous radiograph, there was increase in density of the right
hemithorax.

He continued to receive IVF boluses and his J tube was taken off
of suction and placed to gravity. He was placed in two point
restraints secondary to non-violent behavior such as tube
pulling. He was weaned off pressors and extubated on [**2121-11-16**].

He was reintubated on [**11-18**] after increased respiratory distress
to RR 28-29. He received lasix on [**11-19**]. His cxr on [**11-20**]
showed:

1. Worsening right upper lobe opacity either represents
consolidation or
fissural fluid.
2. Moderately large bilateral pleural effusions, increased since
[**2121-11-19**].

He was started on Ampicillin IV. He received another dose of
furosemide 20 mg IV on [**11-20**]. He remained intubated until [**11-20**]
when he was weaned off the vent. He was started on TPN on [**11-21**]
for nutritional support. He was transferred to the floor on
[**2121-11-22**], started on zosyn, and kept NPO. His pain was controlled
with IV dilaudid. His blood sugars managed with an insulin
sliding scale. His NGT was continued on suction. He continued
HSQ for DVT prophylaxis and pantoprazole for GI prophylaxis.

On [**2121-11-23**] his electrolytes were repleted. His NGT continued and
he received TPN.

On [**2121-11-24**], he continued his TPN, his NGT removed, and his diet
advanced to sips. His foley was discontinued at midnight and he
voided.

On [**2121-11-25**] his J tube was clamped and flushed with sterile water
TID. he received Albuterol nebulizers for wheezing and increased
work of breathing. He continued his TPN. His CXR on [**2121-11-25**]
showed:

Severe cardiomegaly has worsened since [**11-22**], moderate right
pleural
effusion is unchanged and previous mild pulmonary edema has
decreased.

His insulin sliding scale was also adjusted to optimize blood
sugar control.

On [**2121-11-26**], he continued his TPN. Pulmonology was consulted who
recommended thoracocentesis. His Chest CT on [**2121-11-26**] showed:

1. Large dependent bilateral pleural effusions and resulting
atelectasis,
with a right fissural component which may or may not be
loculated.
2. Mild pulmonary edema.
3. Cardiomegaly, coronary artery calcification, and pulmonary
arterial
enlargement.

On [**2121-11-27**] he continued his TPN, received a dose of lasix for
increased work of breathing, and also received a transfusion of
1 uPRBC to continue to optimize his respiratory status. A
thoracocentesis was attempted on [**2121-11-27**] however unsuccessful as
as there was no clear window on ultrasound.

On [**2121-11-28**], he started tube feedings and continued his TPN as his
tube feedings were progressively increased.

On [**2121-11-29**] He continued his TPN and continued to advance his tube
feeds. His zosyn was discontinued. His zosyn was discontinued
after completion of the fourteen day course.

On [**2121-11-30**], his TPN was changed from half strength to full
strength fibersource. His foley was replaced as the patient was
incontinent over the past several days and was developing skin
irritation.

On [**2121-12-1**] and [**2121-12-2**], his central line was discontinued and
his diet advanced to regular, pureed per speech and swallow
consult. His respiratory conditions progressively improved until
he was on minimal O2 supplementation by nasal cannula or room
air.
His chest x ray showed:

Severe cardiomegaly and large right pleural effusion are
unchanged. What
appears to be increasing consolidation in the right upper lobe
and persistent
severe consolidation in the right lower lobe is instead fissural
pleural
effusion and mild basal atelectasis posterior to a moderate
layering pleural
effusion, respectively.

His tube feeds were cycled and optimized by the nutrition
service. He chronic left upper extremity swelling improved after
elevation above the level of the heart with a stockinette.

His tube feeds were adjusted on [**2121-12-4**] and his home meds
including coumadin started. He was discharged to rehab in stable
condition with a foley that should be discontinued at rehab.
