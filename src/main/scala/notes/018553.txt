Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
CODE STROKE

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
MRI/MRA head
MRA neck
endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
 The pt is an 87 year-old right-handed woman with a prior
history of stroke who presented with alteration in mental
status.

The pt was unable to offer a history at the time of my
encounter.
Therefore, the following history is per the primary team, the
medical record, and the pt's daughter.

She had been in her usual state of health until approximately
1440 today. At that time, she was sitting in her wheelchair
[**Location (un) 1131**] the newspaper when her daughter suddenly saw the pt's
right arm moving abnormally (not clear if rhythmically). The
pt's
face appeared "contorted" and her eyes were clamped closed. Her
extremities appeared turned in and clinched together except for
her right arm that was moving abnormally for an uncertain amount
of time. Her daughter had never witnessed such an event in the
past. She became concerned and called EMS who brought the pt to
the [**Hospital1 18**] ED. Code stroke was called at 1530 and neurology was
immediately at the bedside. NIHSS was documented as follows:

Dependent on others for ADLs. No history of tobacco, alcohol,
illicit drug use.

stimuli, but very inattentive. Oriented to self only. Language
nonfluent with intact repetition for one word phrases,
inconsistently follows commands.

-cranial nerves:  PERRL 3 to 2mm. Funduscopic exam revealed no
papilledema, exudates, or hemorrhages. VFF to threat. EOMI. Left
facial droop. Tongue protrudes in midline.

-motor: Atrophic musculature throughout. Tone is spastic on the
left. Dense left hemiplegia. Withdraws to noxious stimuli on the
right and is at least antigravity strength throughout on the
right(formal strength testing limited by impersistence). No
adventitious movements noted.

Brief Hospital Course:
In brief, the patient is an 87 year old woman with history of
right MCA stroke who was admitted with signs and symptoms
consistent with seizure activity potentially related to a new
cerebral infarct whose course was complicated by asystolic
arrrest, and anoxic brain injury.

1.) Neurologically, as mentioned above patient has history of
right MCA stroke with residual left hemiplegia.  Differential
for her acute mental status change included seizure, infectious,
metabolic, cardioembolic with clot dissolution.  An MRI an acute
ischemic event to left insula and the left parietotemporal lobe.
 An EEG showed encephalopathy and frequent posterior
temporal-occipital sharp and slow wave discharges but no clear
seizure activity.  There were no witnessed convulsive seizures
during the admission.  As the patient had a good clinical
description and reason for seizure focus, she was started on
Keppra 500IV [**Hospital1 **] and increased up to 750mg [**Hospital1 **] after 72 hours.
Fasting lipid profile was acceptable and was not started on
statin.  She was normotensive.  Her mental status did not
improve significantly during the admission.  She continued to be
largely unresponsive only very rarely speaking, and never
responding appropriately.  It was thought that she was
debilitated by the old right hemisphere infarct combined with
the new left sided infarct.  As her quality of life prior to
admission was questionable, her daughter requested palliative
care involvement.  Patient's UTI undergoing treatment and recent
acute stroke were discussed with palliative care.  After
discussing with palliative care, the daughter requested
continuing all non invasive medical care to see if there would
be any improvement.  On [**6-17**], the daughter requested a trial of
tube feeds for 12-24 hours to see if this would improve the
patient's strength and ability to interact.  ON [**6-18**] she
requested that the tube feeds be continued throughout the
weekend.  Repeat CT [**6-18**] showed evolving infarct in the
distribution seen on MRI, and no new processess.  A second EEG
study [**6-19**] showed continued intermittent spike/waves from the
area of the old infarct, but no epileptiform activity.  Her
course was further complicated as she suffered an asystolic
arrest on [**2173-6-22**] which was of unclear etiology but could relate
to depressed mental status with resulting aspiration
pneumonia/pneumonitis.  Following this event she was transferred
to the MICU team, however she recovered no meaningful neurologic
function.  In discussions with her daughter following the
arrest, her code status was confirmed to be DNR. Her GCS and
brainstem function over 3 days were consistent with very poor
prognosis for recovery.  She could not complete an apnea test
secondary to abrupt development of hypotension that recovered
following early termination of the test.  EEG showed no cortical
activity at 30 minutes.  Cerebral blood flow studies revealed a
trace amount of blood flow.  Ultimately, the patient's condition
worsened and she expired.  The family was notified. Autopsy was
declined.  Arrangements were made for the patient to be flown to
[**Country **] for burial arrangements.

.
Patient has history of afib and was subtherapeutic on admission.
 Telemetry showed intermittent afib/flutter.  She was ruled out
for MI with 3 consecutive cardiac enzymes.  Heparin drip was
started and titrated for goal PTT of 40-60, and patient was
unable to take coumadin due to failed swallow studies.
.
Infectious Disease: patient had positive Urinalysis for
infection and cultures grew Ecoli sensitive to ceftriaxone.
Infection was treated with rocephin 1gm IV daily.
.
GI: she failed swallow study on [**6-14**] and she was maintained NPO.
NG tube feeds were initially not started per daughter's request
as patient had previous poor baseline.  However, as explained
above daughter requested tube feeds [**6-17**].
.
Renal: There were no acute issues on presentation, however
following her arrest she developed acute non-oliguric renal
failure likely secondary to ATN.

Endocrine: TSH was normal. HbA1c: 5.6

Disp: As above. The patient was pronounced dead on [**2173-6-27**].
