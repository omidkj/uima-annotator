cxr: no acute CP process, hyperinflated lung fields and
flattened diaphragms c/w COPD.

EKG: NSR at 100, nl axis, large peaked Ps, no ST changes, nl
intervals, no Qs.

[**2191-8-9**] PA/Lat CXR:
CHEST, TWO VIEWS: Cardiac size and mediastinal contours are
normal and unchanged. Hyperinflation with hemidiaphragmatic
flattening again seen. Prominent pulmonary arteries. There is no
pneumothorax or pleural effusion. There is again prominence of
the ascending aorta.

IMPRESSION:
1. No acute cardiopulmonary process; stable obstructive lung
patent.
2. Prominence of ascending aorta again demonstrated, for which a
CTA or echocardiography could be considered.

[**2191-8-11**] ECHO:Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal.  The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Symmetric LVH with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function. Mild pulmonary hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 48yo man with asthma, HTN, presents with 5d of productive
cough, decreased PO intake, diarrhea and shortness of breath.
Found to have decreased peak flow, wheezing, and ARF.

#. Hypercarbic respiratory distress: Likely this is due to an
asthma exacerbation in setting of URI. Pt was initially treated
with Bipap, Albuterol and ipratropium nebs were given
continuously q6h, and patient was started on IV salumedrol and
covered for infection with a 7 day course of levofloxacin.
Patient was continued on his outpt Advair 500-50 twice daily. Pt
with hyperinflated lung fields on CXR suggesting COPD component
for which the patient was started on tiotropium. Alpha 1
antitrypsin level returned within normal range. On day of
admission, patient was able to ambulate with 02Sats of 92-93 on
RA.

# Hypertension: He is on HCTZ, Lisinoprol and Atenolol at home.
Lisinopril had been held in setting of ARF which has now
resolved and atenolol was discontinued in setting of
bronchoconstriction. Hydralazine 20mg IV was given for isolated
episode of hypertension and emesis ensued.  Once ARF resolved,
patient was resumed on his home BP regimen.


# Cough: Pt presented with cough and there was concern for
possible pneumonia which has not blossomed on CXR, vs
bronchitis. Given very high temp of 102.4 in ER was continued on
Levoquin to cover for CAP. However, in absence of high fevers on
the floor strong possibility that this is viral, especially in
combination with pt's diarrhea. Sputum culture, urine legionella
antigen, and blood cultures were negative.

# ARF: Admission high of 1.6, with improvement then increase in
Creatinine to 1.4 on [**8-13**]. Pt had diarrhea and had not been
eating for last 3-4 days. Likely this was prerenal due to
dehydration. Improved with continued IVF and po intake.

#) Prophylaxis: heparin SQ, holding bowel regimen given
diarrhea, no indication for ppi.

#) Elevated blood glucose: Most likely a result of steroids and
covered inpatient with insulin sliding scale.  Recommend further
work up as an outpatient once off steroids.

#) ECG changes (enlarged P wave morphology): Concerning for
atrial enlargement.
- Repeat ECHO with similar findings when compared to prior ECHO.


#) FEN: Lytes monitored and repleted prn, regular diet
maintained.

#) Code Status: FULL CODE

#) Communication: patient and daughter [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 26953**].

#) Dispo: To home once ambulating off O2.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
Intermittent Asthma
Hypertension


Discharge Condition:
Stable, ambulating on room air with oxygen saturations of
92-93%.


Discharge Instructions:
You have been evaluated and treated for shortness of breath
requiring 2 days in the ICU for respiratory distress.  You were
treated with IV steroids, nebulizers, and levofloxacin.
Diagnostic testing revealed that in addition to your
intermittent asthma,  you may have a component of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and have had an exacerbation
requiring this hospitalization.  It is recommended that you stop
smoking tobacco.  We have started Spiriva to treat this chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease in addition to your current asthma
medications.  It is advised that you follow up with your primary
care physician before the end of this week prior to returning to
work on [**8-22**].

Please call your physician or return to the emergency department
if you have shortness of breath that is not relieved by your
inhalers, fevers, chills, or new productive cough.

Followup Instructions:
Please follow up with your primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3924**]
