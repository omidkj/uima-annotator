EEG (last week)(LTM): routine and automated sampled EEG does
show some suspicious left posterior frontal/anterior temporal
interictal epileptiform activity, particularly late in the
recording session on the
routine record rather than on the spike detection algorithm.
There is
also some asymmetric slowing over the left central frontal
region in the
theta bandwidth early in the recording that seemed to normalize
later.
The breach phenomenon is still present.


Brief Hospital Course:
42 yo M with L frontal AVM s/p resection, seizure d/o,
non-epileptic seizures, borderline personality disorder,
depression, recent admit for 1 week LTM monitoring, and
dischatged a few hours prior to returning to ED. He was
discharged off all AEDs except Klonopin and was on outpatient
EEG monitoring. He returned in the middle of the night following
his discharge with events he felt concerning for seizures. There
was no change on the few hours that were recorded on his
outpatient EEG monitoring. While in the ED, he had 3 minute
event of cyanosis and poor responsiveness and was admitted to
the ICU overnight. It was unclear if this event in [**Name (NI) **] was a
seizure or non-epileptic event; however, he was started on
Zonegran 400 mg daily. He was also continued on his Klonopin
0.5/1/0.5. The plan was to re-monitor him on EEG prior to
discharge; however, prior to having this arranged, he absconded.
