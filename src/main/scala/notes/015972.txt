Chief Complaint:
Evaluation for Y stent placement

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchcoscopy
Mechanical ventilation


History of Present Illness:
64 year old obese female with a past medical history
significant for HTN, COPD, CAD, tracheobrochmalacia, with
chronic trach/vent dependence is transferred from [**Location (un) 43512**], VT
for further work-up of tracheobronchomalacia and need for
Y-stent to allow for ventilator weaning (currently requires CPAP
for ventilation).  The patient was hospitalized with respiratory
failure in [**7-7**] due to combination of COPD, obesity
hypoventilation, OSA, and bronchomalacia; bronchoscopy on
[**2122-7-16**] showed
a posterior tracheal membrane tear that precluded the placement
of a Y-stent at that time. She received a tracheostomy and a PEG

on [**2122-7-20**]. G-tube study showed no extravasation of fluid, and
the PEG was successfully used for tube feeds and medications.
She was also treated w/ standing and PRN nebulizers (albuterol
and ipratropium). She is now transferred back to [**Hospital1 18**] for
placement of a Y stent.


Past Medical History:
COPD: no PFTs. associated erythrocytosis and has undergnone
phlebotomy.
HTN

CXR:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
major change.  The morphology of the cardiac silhouette and the
lung parenchyma are unchanged. The tracheostomy tube is in
unchanged position. The tip of the PICC line is located 2 cm
more cranial and at the previous examination and now projects
over the azygous vein.

Name:  [**Known lastname **], [**Known firstname **]             Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 78987**]

Service:  MED                     Date:  [**2122-9-3**]

Date of Birth:  [**2058-6-4**]        Sex:  F

Surgeon:  [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], [**MD Number(1) 17274**]

PROCEDURE:  Bronchoscopy.

ASSISTANTS:  [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) 75352**], MD

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  This is a lady with a history of
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, prolonged intubation
with tracheostomy and recent diagnosis of tracheal tear.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Posterior membranous tracheal tear
in the proximal trachea partially healed. Tracheostomy in
place.

INDICATION:  Inspection.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  After informed consent, the patient was
prepped in the usual fashion in her room in the intensive
care unit. Moderate sedation was employed using low dose
opioid and benzodiazepines. The flexible bronchoscope was
introduced through the oral route. The upper airways looked
crowded and edematous. The flexible bronchoscope introduced
past the vocal cord and then immediately there was a
partially healed tear in the posterior membrane of the
trachea extending from the hyoid cartilage down to the site
of the tracheostomy. Distal to the tracheostomy the airways
looked normal with moderate to severe tracheobronchomalacia
seen.

IMPRESSION:
1. Partially healed posterior membranous tracheal tear.
2. Moderate to severe tracheobronchomalacia.


Brief Hospital Course:
64F with COPD, presumed OSA, obesity hypoventilation, trach,
vent dependence, and [**Hospital 59735**] transferred from
[**Location (un) 43512**], [**State 3914**] for consideration of Y stent placement.

1. Tracheobronchomalacia: Interventional Pulmonology performed a
flexible bronchoscopy, and found that her posterior trachea
membrane tear was only partially healed, thus precluding Y-stent
placement. She should follow up with Interventional Pulmonary as
an outpatient in [**2-1**] months for reevaluation.

2. C Diff: She developed diarrhea during her admission and was
found to be C Diff positive.  She had recently completed a
course of PO Vanco prior to admission (last dose 9/4). She was
initially started on Flagyl PO, however, this was changed to
Vancomycin PO on [**2122-9-8**] due to lack of clinical response.  Her
symptoms improved with the Vanco. She should continue this
medication for a minimum of a 10 day course followed by a slow
taper.

She was continued on her other chronic medications and tube
feeds.
