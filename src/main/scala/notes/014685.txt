Pertinent Results:
[**2170-5-8**] CTA CHEST:
IMPRESSION:
1. Large non-occlusive thrombus involving the right and left
main pulmonary arteries extending into the segmental and
subsegmental branches bilaterally.
2. Stable appearance of the left upper lobe mass with interval
improvement in post-obstructive pnuemonia/pneumonitis.
3. Scattered sub-4-mm noncalcified lung nodules as described
above. Attention to these lesions should be paid in followup
scans.
4. Cirrhotic liver with lesion at the dome, best seen on
[**2170-3-7**], CT of the abdomen study.

[**2170-5-8**] CXR:
IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process. Stable fiducial markers
as previously noted.

[**2170-5-8**] ECHO:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
right atrial pressure is indeterminate. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
mild global free wall hypokinesis. The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is
seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired
relaxation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. The pulmonary artery is not well visualized. There
is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mildly dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle. At
least mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

[**2170-5-9**] BLE ULTRASOUND:
IMPRESSION: DVT involving the superficial femoral and popliteal
vein on the left. Clot is also identified in the lesser
saphenous vein on the left. Findings were discussed with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] upon completion of the study.

[**2170-5-9**] CT HEAD:
IMPRESSION: No hemorrhage and no mass effect.


Brief Hospital Course:
60M with HIV, HCV with cirrhosis/ascites, hx DVT, RCC and HCC
presenting with chest/epigastric pain, found to have large
saddle pulmonary embolus.

1. Submassive pulmonary embolus: The patient's CTA was
consistent with a submassive PE.  He was hemodynamically stable.
 BLE ultrasounds showed large clot burden. CT head checked given
malignancy and need for anti coagulation--no masses.  It was
felt that the patient would need lifelong anticoagulation, but
given the large clot burden and the submassive PE, it was felt
that he would benefit from an IVC filter.  This was done by IR.
The patient remained hemodynamically stable.  He was started on
a heparin drip in the ICU and was then transferred to the
general medical floor.   Maintained on heparin until therapeutic
on coumadin.  Patient's anticoagulation to be managed by Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1743**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1226**] office who was contact[**Name (NI) **] and is aware of
need for close monitoring, esp in setting of concurrent
fluconazole therapy.  Given extent of VTE, multiple malignancies
and that this is second episode of VTE, patient needs lifelong
anticoagulation.

2. Odynophagia/Dysphagia/Candidal esophagitis: Unclear etiology,
though likely candidal esophagitis given HIV/HCV/malignancy.
Other possibilities include radiation espophagitis vs CMV
esophagitis or contigious spread of malignancy in setting of
thickened appearance on CTA. GI was consulted and they will
evaluate for cause of dysphagia and agreed likely candidal
esophagitis.  Empiric three week course of fluconazole initiated
on [**5-8**] and to finish [**5-28**].  Too high risk for endoscopy given PE
and heparin therapy.  Patient should have endoscopy within one
month, once stabilized on coumadin regimen, especially given
cirrhosis (? varices) and possibility of spread of malignancy to
esophagus.  Symptoms much improved on fluconazole.

3.  HIV. The patient gets his care at [**Hospital1 2177**], currently well
controlled on HAART regimen.
CD4 of 100 here.  Maintained HAART.  Contact[**Name (NI) **] Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1743**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1226**] office (PCP and ID doctor for Mr. [**Known lastname **]).  Bactrim
prophylaxis given.

4. Hepatitis C/Cirrhosis/Ascites: Maintained on home diuretics
(spirinolactone 200 adn lasix 80  with control of ascites -
however, dose reduced given hyponatremia, slight, and slight
increase in Creatinine and dry overall appearence.  Patient
should follow up for endoscopy within one month to evaluate for
varices especially given concurrent coumadin therapy (arranged
follow up at [**Hospital1 **] with his GI MD, [**Last Name (un) 14429**])

5.Oncology: RCC/mets to lung/probable HCC: S/p cyberknife
radiation (less likely to cause radiation esophagitis  than
traditional XRT).  He is not candidate for IL-2 given liver
disease.

6. Diabetes. Continued ISS and standing long-acting per home
regimen

7. BPH: maintained on terasozin.
