Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
ventilator dependent patient with ?trach leak

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchscopy
Tracheostomy tube replacement
PICC line placement


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 116**] is a 75F with COPD, pulmonary HTN, atrial fibrillation,
and chronic respiratory failure who is ventilator dependent who
is transferred from an OSH for IP evaluation of a possible
tracheostomy leak. The current trach has been in place for 1
year. Of note, the patient has had been admitted continuously
since [**2200-5-1**] for failure to wean from ventilator. On the
morning of admission, the patient had desaturations and required
ventilation with an ambu bag. A bronchoscopy was preformed
revealing a patent trachea a the tube was replaced with a shiley
# 8 89 mm in length to 15 mm above the carina. The patient was
then placed on assist control 450/12/O peep and FiO2 of 40%. She
had consistently low tidal volumes ranging from 250-280, but in
no distress.
In addtion, on the day of admission the patient had a CBC/diff
with 5% bans. The patient was currently treated with Zyvox which
was d/c'd and broadened to Zosyn/flagyl for concern of possible
aspiration. The team from the OSH also had concern for C diff,
but labs are still pending at time of transfer.

Relevant Imaging:
CT Chest [**1-24**]
1. Severe scarring and traction bronchiectasis more prominent in
both upper
lobes, could be due to old granulomatous exposure such as
tuberculosis, less
likely sarcoid.

2. Multifocal peribronchial and bronchiolar opacities on the
right, likely
due to aspiration. Left lower lobe secretions with newly
develped
atelectasis could also be due to aspiration. Note that it is
impossible to
rule out a spiculated lesion from this extensive scarring given
the absence of
prior study for comparison. Followup in three months is
recommended.

3. Marked volume loss on the left with shift of the mediastinum.
The left
upper lobe bronchus is not identified, could be obstructed or
due to prior
left upper lobectomy.

4. Mild emphysema.
5. Signs of pulmonary hypertension.
6. Moderate hiatal hernia. Gallstones.
7. Pectus excavatum.
8. Hyperinflated tracheostomy cuff.

Torso CT [**1-27**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal or intrathoracic hemorrhage.
2. Slightly worsened peribronchiolar and dependent opacities in
the right
lower lobe, suspicious for aspiration.
3. Unchanged severe bronchiectasis and scarring in the upper
lobes
bilaterally, which [**Known lastname **] be due to prior granulomatous disease.
4. Persistently over-inflated tracheostomy tube cuff as well as
termination
of the left PICC in the right brachiocephalic vein.
5. Moderate hiatal hernia.
6. Gallstones.

Brief Hospital Course:
A 75 year old lady transferred from [**Hospital1 **] for
Interventional Pulmonary evaluation of persistent tracheostomy
leak.  Her tracheostomy tube was changed after bronchoscopy.
She was found to have a developing Pneumonia on transfer for
which she will be treated with Doripenem & Vancomycin  until
[**2201-2-9**].

1. Ventilator dependent respiratory failure:  Ms. [**Known lastname 116**] was
transferred for evaluation of her persistent tracheostomy leak.
She was evaluated at bedside by interventional pulmonology (IP),
underwent bronchoscopy via tracheostomy tube which showed
copious purulent secretions which were aspirated. The
tracheostomy tube was changed and replaced at the bedside.  The
leak persisted, but the patient tolerates CMV with tidal volume
set at 600 (breathing ~ 350).  The was clearly an anxiety
component to her complaints of dyspnea because while she was
sleeping or sedated, her tidal volumes improved.  She had
transient episodes of desaturation which improved with suction.
She was treated with morphine to resolve symptoms of air hunger.
A fentanyl patch 25mcg was applied daily to relieve pain/anxiety
which also improved her respiratory status. It is recommended
that she remain on AC/CMV for transport to be re-evaluated by
her primary team at [**Hospital1 **].  Our IP team has no further
mechanical interventions to offer at this time.

2. Pneumonia:  Gram stain of sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage
was significant for
Gram negative rods and Gram positive cocci. She has been started
on Doripenem and Vancomycin to be administered via placed PICC
line for a 2 week course to end [**2201-2-9**].

3.  Tachycardia:  The patient was found to be in sinus
tachycardia from 95-130 while admitted despite a history of
atrial fibrillation.  This was determined to be secondary to
anxiety, work of breathing, and pneumonia.  As we achieved
therapeutic success with antibiotics her tachcardia improved.

The patient was continued on all other medications on which she
was transfered.
