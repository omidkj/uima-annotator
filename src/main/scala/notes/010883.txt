catheterization.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 69 year-old male with
moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who underwent
cardiac testing in [**2174-8-1**].  Myoview at that time showed
no ischemia or infarct with an ejection fraction of 66%.  An
echo also at that time showed AS with thickening of the
aortic valve leaflets, peak aortic gradient of 52, mean of 35
and a valve area 1.0 cm squared, trace MR and trace TR.  The
patient has no history of chest discomfort, but has had a
history of exertional shortness of breath.  This has worsened
over the past year and he is easily short of breath after
climbing only one flight of stairs.

The patient's cardiac catheterization done in mid [**Month (only) 1096**]
showed an aortic valve area of 0.9 cm squared, gradient of
33.  His coronaries were without significant stenosis with
the exception of OM1 that had a 90% stenosis.  His ejection
fraction by cardiac catheterization was 60%.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Aortic stenosis.
2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Hyperlipidemia.
5.  History of hepatitis in the past, not specified which

patient was discharged home and scheduled for aortic valve
replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting times one as
a postoperative admit.  On [**2175-2-9**], the patient was
admitted to the Operating Room at which time he underwent AVR
coronary artery bypass graft times one, please see the OR
report for full details.  In summary, the patient had a
coronary artery bypass graft times one with a saphenous vein
graft to OM1 and aortic valve replacement with a #21 mm
[**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] bovine pericardial valve.

He tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the
Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.
The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period.
His anesthesia was reversed and his sedation discontinued.
Initially, he responded well and was weaned from the
ventilator, however within a short time he became very
agitated requiring resedation.  A second attempt at awakening
the patient was met again with extreme agitation and the
patient, again required resedation.

The following morning, the patient's sedation was
discontinued and he was successfully weaned from the
ventilator and extubated.  Following extubation, the patient
remained hemodynamically stable.  From a pulmonary
standpoint, he remained wheezy throughout the next several
days and therefore was monitored in the Cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit.

On postoperative day #4, it was felt the patient was stable
and ready to be transferred to the floor which was done at
that time.  Over the next several days with assistance of the
nursing staff and Physical Therapy, the patient's activity
level was increased.  He remained hemodynamically stable and
on postoperative day #6, it was decided he was ready for
discharge to home.

At that time, the patient's physical exam is as follows:
Vital signs with a heart rate of 94 and sinus rhythm, blood
pressure 130/72, respiratory rate 18, O2 saturation 94% on
room air, weight preoperatively is 97 kilograms and at
discharge is 96.6 kilograms.  Lab data with a white count of
10, hematocrit 31.2, platelets 256.  Sodium 153, potassium
