[**8-4**] CXR AP and lat: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of
earlier in this date, there is no interval change. The pacemaker
remains in place and there is again evidence of hyperexpansion
of the lungs consistent with chronic pulmonary disease and mild
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. No acute focal pneumonia
or vascular congestion.
.
[**2195-8-5**] CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY
IMPRESSION: No evidence of central or segmental pulmonary
embolism. Enlarged pulmonary artery suggestive of pulmonary
artery hypertension.
Emphysema and multiple small solid lung nodules in left lung
which are
indeterminate. Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
RECOMMENDATION: Followup CT is recommended at six months.
.
[**2195-8-5**] CT Head non-contrast: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of
hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass effect, or acute territorial
infarction. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is preserved,
throughout. The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and
configuration. There is a stable hypodensity demonstrated within
the right corona radiata compatible with the a remote lacunar
infarction. The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable,
with no evidence of fracture. The visualized paranasal sinuses
and mastoid air cells are well-aerated. Incidental note is made
of a prominent right [**Doctor Last Name 13856**] bullosa with leftward deviation of
the bony nasal septum. IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial
process. CT has limited sensitivity for the evaluation of acute
infarction and MRI can be obtained, as clinically indicated.
.
[**2195-8-9**] CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**8-5**],
there are increasing opacifications at the left base
silhouetting the medial aspect of the hemidiaphragm. In view of
the clinical symptoms, this is
