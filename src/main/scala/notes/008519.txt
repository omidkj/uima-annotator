Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5123**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
69 y/o F with hx of NSCLC in L lung, known LLE DVT on coumadin,
presents today with new onset chest pain.  Approximately 2 days
ago, she started having pleuritic chest pain.
.
Of note, she has a hx of PE diagnosed in [**2158**] and has been on
coumadin since that time.  She had held her coumadin 4 days
prior to a lymph node biopsy on [**2-10**].  The coumadin was
restarted the day after the biopsy, and on that day she noted
redness and swelling in her RLE.  She was admitted [**2-19**] and
treated for RLE cellulitis with vanco/keflex.  She was also
found to have LLE DVT.  The thought was that it likely occurred
while she was off her coumadin, so it was not considered a
treatment failure and she was continued on her coumdain, as she
was appropriately therapeutic.  She was discharged [**2-23**].
.
In the ED, initial vs were T 98.9, p 86, bp 125/72, r 20, 100%
on 3L. Patient was given vanco, ceftriaxone, levofloxacin.  She
had a head CT that was negative.  Vascular surgery was consulted
and plans to place an IVC filter tomorrow morning.
.
On the floor, she is complaining of SOB and L sided chest pain.
She is hemodynamically stable.  She wears home O2 since [**2157**].
She has no other complaints.  No headaches, fevers, chills.
Does have chronic productive cough.


Past Medical History:
PMH:
Hypertension - diagnosed 25 years ago
Hyperlipidemia
hearing loss
chronic diastolic heart failure
lung/thyroid cancer s/p resection
[**2159-3-28**] CT scan --> pulmonary embolism; started coumadin
Hypothyroid
Pulmonary hypertension
Left ventricular hypertrophy
.
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
- [**11-2**] - increased SOB --> CXR with RUL opacity, CTA with 1.7 x
2.1 cm spiculated right apical lung mass was noted, also found
to  have left sided thyroid mass with mass effect and tracheal
narrowing.
- [**11-2**] - CT scan of the abdomen that showed innumerable
low-density lesions in the liver for which MRI was recommended
- [**11-2**] negative bone scan
- [**11-2**] thyroid ultrasound with FNA biopsy that was
nondiagnostic.
- [**11-2**] PET/CT intensely FDG-avid right apical spiculated nodule

 measuring 2.4 x 1.7 cm with an SUV max of 15.8. Also noted was
an FDG-avid 5-mm left upper lobe nodule. There was no evidence
of hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy and her thyroid lesion
was not FDG avid.
- repeat thyroid biopsy was unremarkable.
- [**2158-1-10**] left total thyroidectomy and right subtotal
thyroidectomy, wedge resection of a right upper lobe nodule
given her poor lung function as well as mediastinal lymph node
dissection.
- Pathology from lung revealed a 1.9 cm grade II adenocarcinoma
staged as a T1, N0.
- Note was also made of a micropapillary 0.1 cm thyroid cancer
confined to the thyroid.
- followed with frequent imaging
- [**2159-3-28**] CT scan --> pulmonary embolism, and she was
subsequently started on Coumadin for anticoagulation.
- follow up CT scans every three months.
-[**8-5**] a right lower lobe nodule and a 3-mm right middle lobe
nodule concerning for metachronous lung cancer was noted.
- PET/CT right lower lobe non-FDG avid lesion, but there was
some concern for a bronchoalveolar carcinoma upon the read of
that scan.
- [**12-6**] Repeat CT scan with right middle lobe nodule measuring
now
8.9 mm and a right lower lobe opacity concerning for
bronchoalveolar carcinoma.
- [**2160-1-8**] PET/CT on [**2160-1-8**], which revealed two suspicious
right lung lesions that were noted on the CT scan on [**2159-12-19**],
both with increased FDG avidity that was new from prior scans
and felt very suspicious for malignancy
- [**5-6**] CT interval progression in the right middle lobe lesion,
A slowly growing lesion in the left lower lobe suspicious for
bronchoalveolar cancer with significant soft tissue component,
Left axillary and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, Equivocal
findings in the adrenals.
.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
# Hysterectomy age 18
# [**2158-1-10**] left total thyroidectomy and right subtotal
thyroidectomy, wedge resection of a right upper lobe nodule
given her poor lung function as well as mediastinal lymph node
dissection.  (Pathology from lung revealed a 1.9 cm grade II
adenocarcinoma staged as a T1, N0. Note was also made of a
micropapillary 0.1 cm thyroid cancer confined to the thyroid.)
# [**2161-2-10**]: L axillary LN biopsy metastatic lung cancer

Pertinent Results:
CTA CHEST

FINDINGS: There are large filling defects within the right main
pulmonary
artery extending into the right lower lobe subsegmental arteries
and right
middle lobe segmental arteries. Filling defects within the left
lower lobe
segmental and subsegmental arteries as well left upper lobe
segmental artery are noted. There has been interval development
of patchy opacity within the left upper lobe (3, 25). This may
represent developing infection versus pulmonary infarct. There
has been interval development of small left pleural effusion.

Large right upper lobe mass measures 3.7 x 3.2 cm, increased
when compared to prior exam. Additional pulmonary nodules are
similar in appearance. Patient is status partial right lung
resection. There is patchy opacity in the left lung base, which
also may represent atelectasis versus developing pulmonary
infarct. There are coronary artery calcifications. There is no
pericardial effusion.

There is massive left axillary and left subpectoral
lymphadenopathy, partially imaged. For example, there is a 3.7
cm lymph node in short axis diameter within the left axilla.
Enlarged lymph nodes within the mediastinum including a
subcarinal lymph node measuring 2.6 x 2.2 cm is also identified,
similar in
appearance. Calcifications of the arch of aorta and its branches
arnoted.
Limited views of the upper abdomen are noncontributory, except
to note a
subcentimeter hypodense lesion within the liver (2, 52), better
seen on prior CT scan.

IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli which
extend into
the right main pulmonary artery.
2. Interval development of patchy opacity in the left upper lobe
and left
lung base, which may represent new infectious process versus
developing
pulmonary infarcts.
3. Small left pleural effusion.
4. Interval increase in pulmonary nodules and masses.
5. Extensive lymphadenopathy in the left axilla and mediastinum,
similar in appearance.

LE U/S:
FINDINGS: The right common femoral vein, superficial femoral
vein, greater
saphenous vein and calf veins are patent with appropriate
direction of flow and compressibility. However, the right
popliteal vein is enlarged with echogenic material within the
lumen and absence of flow or compressibility.  These findings
are compatible with an occlusive thrombus. This is new when
compared to the prior study.
 .
The left common femoral vein, superficial femoral vein and
greater saphenous veins are patent with appropriate direction of
flow, compression and augmentation. There is a filling defect
within the left popliteal vein
without compressibility, however, a small amount of flow is
identified.
