CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-; CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS

CT OF THE ABDOMEN:

Overall, there has been no significant interval change in
extension of dissection flap, which still originate at the level
of the subclavian artery origin. The ascending aorta remains
normal in size and measures approximately 2.6 cm in greatest
diameter.

The dissection flap and descending thoracic aorta is overall
unchanged in appearance. However, there appears to be slightly
better opacification of some areas of the false lumen, which may
be related to the rate of injection. The descending aorta
measures approximately 2.9 cm at the level of the left main
pulmonary artery, which is not significantly changed. The
pulmonary arteries are normal in caliber.

Note is made of prominent bilateral hilar lymph nodes. The
largest right hilar lymph node measures 1.7 x 2.4 cm. The
largest left hilar lymph node measures 1.5 x 1.1 cm. There is an
enlarged precarinal lymph node that measures 1.3 cm in AP
dimension x 1.3 cm in transverse dimension. No pathologically
enlarged axillary lymph nodes are identified.

There are small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than
right with associated atelectasis. The left pleural effusion has
slightly increased in size. The left pleural effusion measures
up to 25 Hounsfield units in density and underlying hemorrhagic
component cannot be excluded.

Evaluation of the lung windows.

Two 6 mm nodules in the right upper and left lower lobes are
unchanged.

The liver is normal in size and contour. There is no
intrahepatic biliary dilatation. Incidental note is made of
accessory left hepatic artery. The spleen, pancreas, and adrenal
glands are unremarkable. The kidneys enhance symmetrically.
There is no hydronephrosis. There is a 2.6 cm cyst in the
interpolar region of the left kidney as well as additional
multiple hypodensities that are too small to be accurately
characterized.

There is mild aneurysmal dilatation of the suprarenal abdominal
aorta that is not significantly changed and measures
approximately 3.6 cm in maximum diameter. The celiac and
superior mesenteric arteries arise from the true lumen and are
patent. The right and left renal arteries arise just distal to
the end of the dissection flap and are patent. The common iliac,
external iliac and internal iliac arteries are patent.

CT OF THE PELVIS:

The uterus and adnexal regions are unremarkable. The urinary
bladder contains a Foley catheter and is collapsed. There is no
significant free pelvic fluid. Evaluation of the anterior
abdominal wall reveals a small hernia in the anterior abdominal
wall containing a part of the lumen of one of the small bowel
loops, consistent with a [**Doctor Last Name 6261**] hernia. There is no
associated bowel obstruction or pneumatosis. This is unchanged
since the prior study.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are
identified. The Tarlov cyst is again noted in the sacrum.

IMPRESSION:

1. No significant interval change in extent of dissection flap,
which originates at the level of the proximal origin of the left
subclavian artery.

2. Slight interval increase in size of a small left pleural
effusion which measures up to 25 Hounsfield units in density. A
hemorrhagic component /rebleeding secondary to dissection cannot
be excluded. Diagnostic thoracentesis could be performed.

3. Hilar and mediastinal adenopathy of unclear etiology.

4. Two 6-mm pulmonary nodule. A followup in four to six months
with dedicated chest CT is recommended to assess for stability.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Cardiac silhouette appears slightly larger compared to the
previous examination, but this difference could potentially be
due to the portable technique and lower lung volumes. Aorta
remains tortuous, and there is a new left pleural effusion
accompanied by adjacent left basilar atelectasis. Comparison to
the more recent CT torso of [**324-4-18**] confirms the presence
of a left effusion and adjacent atelectasis

What Are the Signs and Symptoms of an Aneurysm?

The signs and symptoms of an aneurysm depend on its type,
location, and whether it has ruptured or is interfering with
other structures in the body. Aneurysms can develop and grow for
years without causing any signs or symptoms. It is often not
until an aneurysm ruptures or grows large enough to press on
nearby parts of the body or block blood flow that it produces
any signs or symptoms.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm

Most abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) develop slowly over years
and have no signs or symptoms until (or if) they rupture.
Sometimes, a doctor can feel a pulsating mass while examining a
patient's abdomen. When symptoms are present, they can include:

Deep penetrating pain in your back or the side of your abdomen
Steady gnawing pain in your abdomen that lasts for hours or days
at a time
Coldness, numbness, or tingling in your feet due to blocked
blood flow in your legs
If an AAA ruptures, symptoms can include sudden, severe pain in
your lower abdomen and back; nausea and vomiting; clammy, sweaty
skin; lightheadedness; and a rapid heart rate when standing up.
Internal bleeding from a ruptured AAA can send you into shock.
Shock is a life-threatening condition in which the organs of the
body do not get enough blood flow.

Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm
A thoracic (chest) aortic aneurysm may have no symp
