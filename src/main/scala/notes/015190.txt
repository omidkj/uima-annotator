Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4891**]
Chief Complaint:
GI bleeding

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This is a 69 year-old Female with a PMH significant for chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (on home oxygen supplementation),
coronary artery disease (s/p silent MI previosuly), non-insulin
dependent diabetes mellitus, peripheral artery disease and
diverticulosis, known hiatal hernia who presents with bright red
blood per rectum.
.
The patinent presented to [**Hospital3 **] 1-week prior with the
onset of shortness of breath. She was initially presumed to be
having a COPD exacerbation and recveived steroids, nebulizers
and oxygen treatments with subsequent improvement and discharge
to a skilled nursing facility. At the facility, she was noted to
have grossly blood stools mixed with melena in the AM on [**2161-8-14**]
(at 2AM) associated with hypotension. She denied
lightheadedness, dizziness or palpitations. She had no nausea,
emesis or abdominal pain. She had no cough, respiratory symptoms
or hematemesis. She returned to the [**Hospital3 **] ED and was
noted to have a hemoglobin of 7.2 g/dL (significant decline from
baseline). She recived 1 unit of packed red cells and 1.5L of
normal saline prior to transfer. She has been on prophylactic
Lovenox and ASA. She denies recent NSAID use.
.
Of note, her last colonoscopy and EGD were 1-year prior and at
that time noted evidence of diverticulosis. She reports that she
has been admitted to [**Hospital3 **] almost annually with
similar bleeding concerns and each endoscopy reveals resolved
bleeding with a presumed divericular source.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED upon transfer, initial VS 100.0 56 98/42 16 96%
RA. Her exam was notable for a moderate amount of maroon colored
diarrhea per rectum. Laboratory data noted a WBC 6.9, hemoglobin
9.5, hematocrit 30.9%, platelets 204 and INR 1.2. LFTs were
reassuring. A 22-gauge, 20-gauge and two 18-gauge peripherals
were established for IV access. She received 1L NS x 1 in the ED
and 1 unit of pRBCs. GI and General Surgery were consulted and
agreed with MICU transfer.
.
On arrival to the MICU, she was mentating well without abdominal
pain and appears stable. She was treated and stabilized in the
ICU before being transitioned to the hospital medicine service
for ongoing management.  She underwent an attempt at
colonoscopy, although the preparation was not felt to be
adequate to effectively rule out focal GI pathology. No upper GI
pathology was noted on endoscopy.

Past Medical History:
1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (on 2L NC home oxygen)
2. Coronary artery disease (status-post silent MI without
stenting; on ASA for secondary prevention; had MI over 15 years
prior and recent pharmacologic stress testing was reassuring)
3. History of hiatal hernia
4. History of diverticulosis
5. Peripheral artery disease
6. Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus
7. Hyperlipidemia
8. GERD, reflux esophagitis


Social History:
Patient lives at home with her husband and has 6 children.
Denies tobacco use currently (quit 6 days prior); prior to that
has a 50 pack-year history; denies alcohol use; no recreational
substance use. Patient is independent in ADLs and ambulates
unassisted. Worked at Stop-and-Shop as a cashier.

Family History:
Denies significant family history of cardiovascular disease,
early MI, arrhythmia or sudden cardiac death. Mother died of
liver cancer at age 63 years.

#MICROBIOLOGY:
[**2161-8-14**] 6:32 pm MRSA SCREEN      Source: Nasal swab.
                            **FINAL REPORT [**2161-8-17**]**
   MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2161-8-17**]):    No MRSA isolated.

#IMAGING:
[]CXR [**2161-8-15**]: The lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with COPD.
 The heart is likely enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and
unfolded.  There is upper zone redistribution, but I doubt overt
CHF.  No gross effusion.
