History of Present Illness:
74 year old male with dyspnea and chest discomfort, now referred

experience chest pain with exertion and requires one
nitroglycerin SL for
relief.  These episodes of dyspnea and chest pain have increased
since his follow up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] in [**2152-1-12**].

Pertinent Results:
[**2152-4-10**] ECHO
PRE BYPASS The left atrium is dilated. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. Moderate to
severe spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial
appendage. A left atrial appendage thrombus is not clearly see
but cannot be completely excluded. The right atrium is dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the
lateral, anterolateral, and inferolateral walls. The rest of the
segments are moderately globally depressed. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20
%). The right ventricle displays moderate global free wall
hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are
three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is severe aortic stenosis by Doppler
however there is likely an element of pseudo-aortic stenosis.
Likely there is mild to moderate aortic stenosis. There is trace
aortic to mild aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. Mild to moderate ([**2-13**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the
results in the operating room at the time of the procedure.

POST BYPASS The patient is being AV paced. The patient is
receiving norepinephrine and milrinone by infusion. The right
ventricle displays improved systolic function and is now
borderline normal. The left ventricle also displays improved
systolic performance with mild global hypokinesis with continued
severe lateral, anterolateral, and inferolateral hypokinesis.
Overall EF now about 40%. The aortic valve area has improved to
1.6 cm2 consistent with mild to moderate aortic stenosis. The
rest of valvular function is unchanged. The thoracic aorta is
intact after decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Transferred in for cardiac evaluation, after presenting to
outside hospital for chest pain and ruled in for non ST
elevation myocardial infarction.  He underwent a cardiac
Catheterization that revealed significant coronary disease and
cardiac surgery was consulted.  Post cardiac catheterization he
had an acute kidney injury with peak creatinine to 3.2.  He was
monitored and underwent preoperative workup.  On [**2152-4-10**] he was
brought to the operating room and underwent redo sternotomy and
coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  See operative report for
further details, of note he required bougie for intubation. (see
anesthesia report)  He received cefazolin and vancomycin for
perioperative antibiotics.  He was transferred to the intensive
care unit for post operative management on levophed for
hypotension and milirone for systolic failure.  He was also
started on vasopressin and with in the first twenty four hours
he was weaned off levophed and vasopressin.  Postoperative day
one he was weaned and extubated without complications and
milirone was slowly tapered off.  That night he had increasing
oxygen requirements with volume overload and was treated with
diuretics with no response.  Postoperative day two he was placed
on non invasive ventilation for hypoxia with good response,
renal was consulted for acute kidney failure and he was started
on CVVH for volume overload.  He improved with volume removal
and remained in the intensive care unit for monitoring.  On [**4-15**]
CVVH was stopped and he was restarted on diuretics with good
response. He was restarted on coumadin for atrial fibrillation.
He continued to progress well and was transferred to the floor
on postoperative day 7 for further recovery.  Physical therapy
worked with him on his strength and mobility.  His renal
function continued to improve. Lasix was stopped. His intake and
output should be monitored while at rehab along with every other
day labs to include renal function and electrolytes. In the even
that his output diminishes, lasix should be dosed or resumed as
needed. Mr. [**Known lastname 94219**] continued to make steady progress and was
ready for discharge to Masconomet rehabiltation on post
operative day 10. He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] and
his primary care physician as an outpatient.
