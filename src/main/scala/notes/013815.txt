Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Diovan

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
85yo F who is now transferred from [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 745**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 18896**] after she
presented there with flash pulmonary edema. On presentation to
the OSH she had an initial O2 sat 60% with respiratory distress
and a CXR consistent with pulmonary edema. She was intubated and
received NTG SL, morphine, lasix 100mg. She was transfered to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further management as there were no ICU beds at the
OSH.
.
On arrival to the ED here, the patient was found to be
intubated, with a HR 84, BP of 160/80, T 98.8 and O2 Sat of 100%
on AC with FIO2 of 100%. A murmur was noticed on exam.
Cardiology was consulted and an ECHO showed severe AS with a
valave area of 0.5cm and a peak gradient of 65mmHg, also with
2+MR and 2+TR, moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
EF 50%.
.
On arrival to the floor the patient was alert and intubated. She
was answering yes and no questions appropriately, however
history was limited due to intubation.
.
Pt reports shortness of breath, which worsened over several days
and made her go to the OSH on the day of admission. She denied
any chest pain, syncope or presyncope and alse denies any
dietary indiscretion or any other pain, nausea, vomiting. She
also denies [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 691**] [**Location (un) **]. ? Orthopnea, PND hard to elucidate from
intubated patient, but present per PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 626**]. The family is not
able to contribute to her recent history.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, cough, black stools or red stools. He denies
recent fevers, chills or rigors, no cough. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Her family reports that at baseline she is very active and
independent in all her ADL. She has a history of CHF and has DOE
but is able to ambulate a flight of stairs without problems and
is babys[**Name (NI) 12854**] her grandchildren on her own.


Past Medical History:

H/o of mild AS: Aortic valve area is estimated to be 1.5 cm sq.
Mean pressure gradient is 20 mmHg and maximum pressure gradient

peak gradient 76 and mean 49 mmHg.
S/p PCM, DDD, for bradycardia
Anemia, unclear baseline, Vit B12 def
Breast cancer, s/p L mastectomy and chest radiation

Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current or
prior tobacco use. There is no history of alcohol abuse.

Family History:
 There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death.  Mother had angina in her 60s and a stroke in
her 70s. Son with DM2.

Pertinent Results:
[**2140-10-7**] EHCo
The left atrium is elongated. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal
(LVEF 50%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: severe calcific aortic stenosis with moderate
concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and low normal ejection
fraction
.
CXR:
Extensive pulmonary fibrosis with most marked abnormalities at
left apex.
Suspect chronic lung disease such as idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis with superimposed scarring from prior granulomatous
disease at left apex.
.
CT Chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. Pulmonary fibrosis is severe in the left apex and compatible
with known prior chest radiation, and mild-to-moderate in the
remainder of the lung parenchyma.
2. Mild dependent ground-glass opacity is compatible with
pulmonary edema.
3. Scattered mild relative lucency in both lungs may be
secondary to a perfusion abnormality such as pulmonary
hypertension or air trapping.
4. Severe aortic valvular calcification with associated left
ventricular chamber enlargement.
5. Multiple calcified and noncalcified pulmonary nodules
measuring up to 4 mm in diameter. If the patient has no known
malignancy or risk factors for lung cancer, no additional
followup is required.
6. Extensive left anterior descending coronary artery
calcifications.

Brief Hospital Course:
85 year old with severe AS and acute pulmonary edema.
.
CHF(Acute, diastolic): Likely acute decompensation in the
context of severe AS and difficult fluid balance. Patient
diuresed gingerly in light of preload dependent AS. Volume
overload resolved with PRN lasix. ECho [**Last Name (un) **] preserved EF and
severe EF. Patient was started on 12.5 metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]. Patient
had left and right heart caths showing branch vessel disease
only, no needed for stent. Patient also started on daily ASA.
.
Aortic stenosis: Patient with known AS, but this is first
incident of acute pulmonary edema. Aortic valve area <.8cm2
here. Patient very hesitant to go for surgery, and after much
discussion, conclution reached that she be discharged home, and
is scheduled for AVR on [**10-25**].
.
Pulmonary fibrosis: Patient has history of breast Ca, with
radiation. PFT's in house demonstarted mild restrictive disease
with normal DLCO. She is cleared for surgery from a pulmonary
perspective, and can f/u as outpatient.
.
# HTN: Amlodipine dc/ed and toprol XL continued.
.
# ARF: pt without evidence of chronic failure on records from
PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 8856**] have to presume this is ARF. Likely due to poor
forward flow in the context of CHF and severe AS. Patient was
diuresed with stabilization of creatinine to 1.1.
.
# Rhythm: ventricularly paced at heart rate of 80
.
# DM2: Glyburide held on floor, on ISS. discharged on glyburide.
