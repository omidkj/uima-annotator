Service: NEUROSURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1271**]
Chief Complaint:
right upper extremity numbness and weakness, right facial droop,
word finding difficulty

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
evacuation of left subdural hematoma via burr holes


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with right upper extremity numbness and
weakness since Saturday [**1-29**].  She went to ED at OSH Saturday
and they
told her it was secondary to arthritis and cervical DJD.
Saturday
afternoon she began having word finding difficulty, where she
"can't get the words out", which improved in the evening and
then
started again later that night.  Family spoke with PCP who
suggested follow up in the office on Monday [**1-31**].  Sunday night
her
family noticed she had a slight right facial droop and today her
family noticed she had 1 sentence which was completely jumbled
and did not make sense.  She visited her PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3011**] ([**1-31**]) who
sent her
to [**Hospital3 **] ED for eval.  Head CT done there showed a L SDH
and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further eval. Reports fall
3
months ago where she hit her head, no CT done per patient and
family.   No headache, no complaints other than left leg pain
which is baseline due to neuropathy and right upper extremity
numbness.

Pertinent Results:
[**2135-1-31**] 05:00PM   PT-26.6* PTT-30.4 INR(PT)-2.6*
[**2135-2-1**] 02:44AM   PT-14.4* PTT-26.5 INR(PT)-1.3*

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2135-1-31**] 5:13 PM
FINDINGS: There is a large left frontoparietal extra-axial fluid
collection predominantly hyperdense, within a largely hypodense
background, likely representing subdural hematoma. This measures
13 mm in maximal thickness at the level of the lateral
ventricles. There is slight rightward shift of the septum
pellucidum, measuring roughly 4mm. There is effacement of the
occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle. There is no
evidence of uncal herniation. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation
is preserved. There is no evidence to suggest acute major
vascular territorial infarction. The visualized paranasal
sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear, and no skull fracture
is seen.

IMPRESSION:
1. Large left frontoparietal subdural hematoma with mixed hypo-
and hyper- dense material, with a laminar and compartmentalized
appearance, consistent with acute-on-more chronic hemorrhage,
likely from internal fibrovascular strands; there is no "swirl"
sign to suggest hyperacute hemorrhage.
2. Mild rightward shift of midline structures, no evidence of
herniation.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2135-2-1**] 6:24 PM

FINDINGS: There has been interval placement of two burr holes
located within the left frontal cortex. Multiple staples are
present in the subcutaneous tissues at this level. There are
several foci of pneumocephalus present throughout the left
subdural space and more medially within the left cerebral
hemisphere/subarachnoid space. There is a new large area of
subarachnoid hemorrhage centered within the left frontal lobe
superiorly. There is shift of normally midline structures to the
right by approximately 5 mm . Aside from effacement of the sulci
within the frontal lobe, there is no other significant mass
effect. A persistent mixed density subdural hematoma overlying
the left cerebral convexity appears slightly smaller in size
when compared to the examination from eight hours prior. There
is no intraventricular blood. There is no hydrocephalus. The
visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air
cells are clear.

IMPRESSION: Status post two burr holes placed in the left
frontal cortex for evacuation of subdural hematoma. New interval
confluent subarachnoid hemorrhage centered within the superior
left frontal lobe compared to examination from eight hours
earlier. Multiple foci of intracranial pneumocephalus as
described.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2135-2-4**] 10:37 AM

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
[**Age over 90 **] year old woman with new seizure activity
FINDINGS: New low attenuation within the left MCA distribution
is most prominent within the left anterior temporal lobe, and
left parietotemporal lobe. This finding is concerning for
subacute infarction. The patient is status post evacuation of a
left subdural hematoma via two burr holes within the superior
left frontal and parietal lobes. Remaining subdural hematoma is
stable in size, measuring up to 1 cm in maximum dimension. There
has been a slight interval decrease in postoperative
pneumocephalus. A large amount of left frontoparietal
subarachnoid hemorrhage and adjacent focal edema is unchanged.
Left-to-right midline shift at the level of the septum
pellucidum is unchanged at 4 mm. The ventricles and right
cerebral hemisphere are unchanged.

IMPRESSION: New low attenuation within the left MCA territory,
including the left anterior temporal and left parietotemporal
lobes concerning for evolving infarct.





Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 76607**] was admitted from the ED to the ICU by the
neurosurgical service.  She was given a loading dose of Dilantin
in the ED and continued on Dilantin in the ICU for seizure
prophylaxis.  She was given FFP to reverse the INR and her
neurologic status was closely monitored.  A CT head was repeated
in the morning on [**2-1**] and surgical treatment of the SDH was
recommended.  The patient and family agreed to evacuation via
burr holes and she was consented and prepared for the OR.  She
underwent evacuation via burr holes on [**2-1**] and it was noted
post operatively that she had some right sided hemiparesis,
expressive aphasia and right facial droop. A stat head CT was
done which showed new left frontal intracerebral hemorrhage.  A
repeat CT head on [**2-2**] was stable and she was treated for
hypernatremia with a Na of 146.  On [**2-3**] she had worsening
mental status including not following commands and a repeat head
CT was done which was stable.  She also had increasing
creatinine and decreased urine output which was responsive to IV
fluid boluses.  A discussion was had with her family and she was
made DNR/DNI.  On [**2-4**], her creatinine continued to increase with
a low urine output and low urine output.  She was started on
phenylephrine for low urine output.  She had multiple seizures
and a repeat head CT was done which showed new low attenuation
within the left MCA territory, including the left anterior
temporal and left parietotemporal lobes concerning for evolving
infarct.   A discussion was had with the patient's family and
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**] in the afternoon on [**2-4**] and it was decided to
begin comfort care only.  The patient expired at 1:50 am on
[**2135-2-5**]. Her family was with her when she died and they did not
want an autospsy performed.
