   GRAM STAIN (Final [**2104-11-10**]):
      >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
      3+  (5-10 per 1000X FIELD):   MULTIPLE ORGANISMS
CONSISTENT WITH
                                    OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.
.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2104-11-9**] 5:31 PM
IMPRESSION: No significant change in appearance of hypodense
material within the basal cisterns, consistent with subarachnoid
hemorrhage. CTA could be helpful for further evaluation, this
was discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2808**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1726**]. There is a plan to obtain
CTA when the patient is more stable.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: The value of CTa is
questionable, unless this is truly a spontaneous hemorrhage.
However, there are small amounts of dural thickening and
possible subdural hemorrhage along the falx anteriorly and
overlying the right frontal lobe. These suggest trauma, as does
the distribution of the blood into the inferior frontal
subarachnoid space. Thus, there may be a combination of
subarachnoid hemorrhage and inferior frontal hemorrhagiv
contusion- all compatible with trauma. Correlation with the
clinical history is recommended.
.
.
CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2104-11-9**] 3:29 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of fracture or abnormal prevertebral soft tissue
swelling.
2. Cervical spondylosis.
3. Subarachnoid hemorrhage seen on CT of the head not well
evaluated on this study.
4. Small nodular density at the right apex possibly represents
convergence of vessels. Correlation with prior studies if
available is recommended.
.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2104-11-9**] 3:29 PM
IMPRESSION: Hyperdense material within the basal cisterns
consistent with subarachnoid hemorrhage. No evidence of shift of
normally midline structures or hydrocephalus.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There is a left parasagittal
linear skull fracture without depression.
.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2104-11-10**] 6:29 PM
IMPRESSION: No change in the subarachnoid and likely small
subdural hemorrhages.
.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2104-11-10**] 2:38 PM
A single AP view of the chest is obtained [**2104-11-10**] at 1445 hours
and compared with the prior day's radiograph. The patient has
been extubated. Since the prior examination, the patient has
developed opacity in the right lower lobe. There is also
increased interstitial markings in the right upper lobe and to a
lesser extent in the left lung compared with the prior
examination. The findings may represent asymmetric pulmonary
edema. However, particularly in the right lower lobe, aspiration
or pneumonitis must be considered..

Brief Hospital Course:
This patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] under the Neurosurgery
service on [**11-9**] after being transfered from an outside
hospital. The patient was evaluated in the ED and had a CT scan
(findings as above). The patient was intubated for airway
protection after an episode of vomiting. She was then brought to
the surgical ICU for furthur monitoring. Her initial CT scan of
her head was stable compared to that of the outside hospital.
.
On [**11-10**], the patient was extubated. She had some respiratory
difficulties, with tachypnea and a raised pC02. She was
evaluated via a chest xray. Her neurological status had greatly
improved overnight and through the course of the day.
.
The following day on [**11-11**],
.
A/P: [**Age over 90 **] yo female with history of HTN, hypercholesterolemia who
presented from OSH with subdural bleed and AMS who had a STEMI
and ARF while in house.
.
# STEMI: Apppears to be anterior wall
- Cardiology consulted - not a cath candidate because of ARF and
intracranial hemorrhage
- started on aspirin, statin, BB
- unable to start hydralazine for afterload reduction, given low
BPs
- ECHO to assess cardiac function - see results above -
consistent with R and L sided heart failure.
.
# ARF: Most likely secondary to poor forward flow in setting of
significantly depressed EF.
- creatinine rising from 1.1 on admission to 2.9
- Pt noted to have signif decreased UO, not significantly
responsive to fluids
- given Lasix with increased UO, then creat bumpted to 2.9
.
# Aspiration PNA: Patient with MS changes and 3-4L O2
requirement after aspiration. Would also account for her
elevated WBC count.
- oxygenating and ventilating well after event. ABG: 7.36/39/145
with normal lactate.
.
# Altered mental status: Several reasons for AMS including:
- MI, ARF, UTI, Aspiration PNA and intracranial bleed
.
# Subdural bleed:
- Neuro/Neurosurg recs
- dilantin for seizure prophylaxis - level 16.5 on day of
admission
- serial head CTs have been stable - patient with aneurysm - Per
neuro, would consider an MRI to properly assess this if pt
stable
.
# Anemia:
- Iron studies c/w ACD
.
# UTI:
- treat with Levofloxacin for 7 days since she has a Foley
- renally dosing levofloxacin
.
# FEN: TF
.
# Hypernatremia: D51/2NS to replete some free water.
.
# Diabetes Mellitus: titrate up SSI.
.
# PPX:
- PPI
- No heparin [**3-13**] intracranial bleeds
- pneumoboots
- sliding scale insulin
.
# Code Status: Patient can be intubated if it is felt it would
be for a short period of time. No chest compressions or
defibrillation
