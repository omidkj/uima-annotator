Allergies:
Epinephrine / Keflex

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4616**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, chills, increased abdominal girth.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Diagnostic paracentesis.
Therapeutic paracentesis with removal of 4L.
Central venous line placement and removal.

History of Present Illness:
73 YO M with fatigue, increased abdominal girth, decreased PO
intake and chills with low grade temps to 100. Re-initiated oral
chemotherapy on [**4-13**] and is status post 5L paracentesis 4 days
prior to admission. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10919**] are onc team.
Complained of intermittent diffuse abd cramps. Initial VS in ED:
98.1 102 93/66 16 100% Lactate 2.7. Mild tachycardia. BP in 90s.
Family reports pt runs in 110s. Mild diffusely tender abd.
Guaiac + brown stool. 2PIVs placed initially. CXR unremarkable.
Paracentesis done, transudative, did not look like SBP, cultures
sent. UA with no infection. CT scan abdomen with ?gasrtric
obstruction. Has history of duodenal stent in the past. Surgery
evaluated and did not feel that this was clinical gastric outlet
syndrome, though with more metastatic disease in abd, most
likely leading to more ascites. Over the night in the ED his BP
decreased to 80s. Initially he received 500 cc bolus with
increase to 88. LIJ was placed...post-CXR fine. CVP 3. Got add'l
500cc NS with increase to SBP 100, HR 105, satting fine on 2L
NC. Basically admitted for hypotension, potential infection with
unclear source.

Got zosyn and vanco, question of allergy to keflex, though has
tolerated in the past. VS at time of transfer 105 83/49 99% 2L
16-18. Received add'l fluid bolus prior to transfer, received
total of 3L NS in ED.

On arrival to [**Name (NI) 153**] pt's BP in high 80s, low 90s, borderline
tachycardia. Complaining of fatigue, increased abdominal girth,
decreased appetite. Currently denies abdominal pain. Reports
decreased PO intake since chemo on Monday with increasing
abdominal girth, lower extremity edema. No diarrhea, no nausea
or vomiting, no change in stool.  No dizziness/orthostasis.
Shaking chills at home.  Currently no abdominal pain, responded
to low dose morphine.

Imaging Studies:

CT abdomen/pelvis ([**4-17**]):
  CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: In the visualized
thorax, there is a new small right pleural effusion with
associated relaxation atelectasis. The heart is top normal in
size. There are coronary artery calcifications. There is no
pericardial effusion.
  In the abdomen, there is increased, now massive ascites. Again
seen is a
common biliary ductal stent terminating in the third portion of
the duodenum. There has been interval placement of a duodenal
stent; however, the stomach is distended but the antrum
collaped. A new duodenal stent is seen.
  Multiple enlarged hypodensities within the liver are
concerning for metastatic disease, progressed from prior. The
spleen, adrenals and pancreas appear normal. The kidneys
symmetrically take up and excrete contrast. Multiple
retroperitoneal and mesenteric nodes are again seen, but none
reach size criteria for pathologic enlargement. No peritoneal
implants are specifically identifiable.
  CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is a right
fluid-containing inguinal hernia (series 2, image 95). The
urinary bladder, distal ureters, rectum, sigmoid [**Month/Day (4) 499**] and
prostate are unremarkable.
  MUSCULOSKELETAL: Again noted is sclerosis of L3. Degenerative
changes are seen at multiple levels of the spine and severe
degenerative changes are seen in the hip.

IMPRESSION:
1. Interval placement of duodenal stent.
2. Progressed metastatic disease in the liver with associated
massive ascites.
3. Fluid-filled right inguinal hernia.
4. Unchanged sclerotic L3 vertebral body lesion concerning for
metastasis.

CXR PA and LAT ([**4-17**]):
CHEST, TWO VIEWS: Heart size, hilar and mediastinal contours are
normal. Low lung volumes limit assessment. There is mild
bibasilar atelectasis. There is no consolidation, effusion or
pneumothorax. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. There is a
distended gastric bubble. Two stents are seen in the righ
