Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4980**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
diagnostic paracentesis

History of Present Illness:
73 with history of HTN, Type 2 DM, recent recurrent
cholecystitis non-operatively managed, newly diagnosed cirrhosis
c/b ascites transferred from [**Hospital 671**] [**Hospital 4094**] Hospital to [**Hospital1 18**]
for abdominal pain. Patient has had recent admissions for RUQ
abdominal pain, diagnosed with cholecystitis, non-operatively
managed due to poor surgical candidate. Most recently, she was
discharged from [**Hospital3 3583**] on [**2104-5-13**] after treatment for
LLL pneumonia. She was transferred to [**Hospital 671**] [**Hospital 4094**] Hospital.
Per her son, he was notified that she had decreased PO intake,
no stooling. On day prior to admission, patient was found to
have abdominal pain, KUB at that time showed possible early SBO.
Due to worsening pain, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation.
In the ED, initial vitals were 96F 126/84 60 16 99%RA. She
underwent CT abdomen and pelvis that showed small bowel
distention and mild dilation with air-fluid levels and possible
point of subtle caliber transition in the right lower quadrant,
ascites, no free air. Surgery was consulted and recommended CT
with contrast to rule out ischemia. CT with contrast showed
small bowel/colonic wall thickening/edema, likely secondary to
third spacing. Slight terminal ileal hyperemia in the right
lower quadrant could indicate infectious or inflammatory
process. She was given Zosyn empirically. Patient developed
transient hypotension to systolic 70's, resuscitated wtih 4L
IVF. At that time, diagnostic para was done and she recieved IV
Ceftriaxone. Right Groin line placed. She was transferred to the
ICU for hypotension.
On arrival, she is uncomfortable with pain, unable to articulate
her exact symptoms.

1. Multifocal small bowel and colonic wall thickening and edema,
most likely related to third spacing and low protein state
secondary to cirrhosis. Mild hyperemia of the terminal ileum
could be seen in the setting of infection or inflammation with
ischemia considered less likely.
2. Cirrhosis with splenomegaly and ascites.
3. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions.


Brief Hospital Course:
ICU Course:
73 female with history of cirrhosis, pancytopenia/presumed MDS,
medically managed cholecystitis, recent LLL pna admitted for
abdominal pain and hypotension.

1. Hypotension - Treated empirically with antibiotcis to cover
intraabdominal source. Responded to IVF. Held
diuretics/anti-hypertensives. Morning cortisol 23 ruling out
adrenal insufficiency.

2. Abdominal Pain - Initial concern for SBO based on OSH
radiology. Seen by surgery. They were not concerned for SBO. CT
with contrast showed hyperemic bowel. Lactate of 2.6--> not
consistent with ischemic bowel or perforation. Passing flatus
and small amounts of stool.

3. Pleural Effusions - Bilateral, found on CT. Recent treatment
for LLL PNA at [**Hospital3 **]. No tachypnea, on room air with
good O2 saturations. Diff includes hepatic hydrothorax,
parapneumonic effusion, CHF, effusion related to thyroid
disease.

4. Hypernatremia - 154 on arrival to floor, concern for
decreased Po in rehab hospital. Also hyperchloremic, which may
correlate. Free water deficit 2.7L.  Given D5 but held after
sodium dropped 154-149.

5. Cirrhosis -  Hepatitis serlogy, anti-smooth muscle, anca all
negative in late [**2103**]. + AScites, para negative for SBP.
Restarted lactulose. Held diuretics. Will need outpatient liver
follow-up.

6. Coagulopathy - likely [**3-5**] underlying liver disease.
Fibrinogen normal. Trended.

7. Elevated Alkaline Phosphatase - trending down, monitor. While
has chronic elevation, if this presentation was from
cholecystitis, would expect acute change.

8. Pancytopenia - Long-standing, concern for MDS. Repeat labs in
ED with acute drop in all cell lines in setting of IVF
resuscitation. Emailed heme-onc to comment on bone marrow.

9. UTI - on cefepime
10. history of VTach - continued amiodarone
11. Hypothyroidism - continued Levothyroxine 175mcg/day, checked
TSH/FT4.
12. GERD - continued PPI.
13. Depression - continued zoloft 50 mg daily
.
14: Multiple medical problems/several re-admissions: Following
discussion with HCP and PCP and overall unclear diagnosis but
subsequent decline and several admissions consulted palliative
care.
