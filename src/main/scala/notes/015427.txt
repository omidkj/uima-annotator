Brief Hospital Course:

procedure well with no complications.  The patient was
transfered to the SICU post operatively secondary to his

so postop PA pressure measurements could be taken. He was placed
on his home regimen of anti pulmonary hypertension meds, but in
the evening of POD#0, the patient developed hypertension to SBP
>200 and tachycardia.  Nifedipine prn was added to his regimen,
and he was stabilized on 90mg TID which he often takes at home.

kidney by falling from 6 to 1.5 in 3 days.  Otherwise, the
