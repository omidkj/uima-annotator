RUQ u/s [**2124-6-25**]
1. Small gallstones. No evidence for cholecystitis.
2. Two gallbladder polyps measuring up to 6 mm in diameter.

CXR:

Chest CT/abd pending

Brief Hospital Course:
He was treated with aggressive IVF given leukocytosis, fever,
and elevated lactate. The history was concerning for pneumonia
given productive cough and fever, although CXR was without
significant consolidation. He was empirically started on
Vancomycin Ciprofoxacin, and Zosyn for healthcare associated
pneumonia given his residence. He was hemodynamically stable on
arrival to ICU though BP trended down overnight and responded
appropriately to normal saline boluses.  He had evidence of mild
acute renal failure but the following morning the creatinine
trended down to baseline and lactate normalized as well.  The
source of infection remained unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] did complain of
transient abdominal tenderness with mild LFTs abnormalities.
RUQ ultrasound showed old gallbladder stones but no sign of
acute cholecystitis or biliary duct dilatation.   Speech and
swallow evaluation was conducted and there was no clear evidence
of aspiration.  UA was clean and the urine culture was negative.
he had no other focal symptoms.  Sputum samples were
contaminated. CT chest and abdomen was performed to evaluate for
intra-abdominal source and further document or rule out
aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis.  The CT showed ground-glass
opacities and tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] pulmonary nodules in both lower lobes
which most likely represented an infectious process. It did show
cholelithiasis but no evidence of acute cholecystitis. He had
prominent mediastinal, retroperitoneal and pelvic lymph nodes,
more prominent than on the prior study, most of which did not
meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement. There was multiple
compression fractures, some of which were new from [**2120**]. In
regards to the hyperbilirubinemia, the patient had a benign
abdominal exam and negative RUQ U/S for CBD stones or CBD
dilatation.  His LFT's remained the same and he was asked to see
his PCP in one week to follow the trend and conduct further
diagnostic tests, if needed.  VNA and home PT were requested.
Total discharge time 45 minutes.
