EKG:
[**Last Name (un) 26580**] [**2153-2-9**]: EKG HR 99, ST depressions II, III, aVF.

CTA (prelim): 1. No pulmonary embolus or aortic dissection is
seen.
2. Emphysematous changes with diffuse bronchiectasis. There are
new
scattered opacities in the bibasilar regions which most likely
represent
atelectasis, less likely pneumonia. Clinical correlation
recommended.
3. Stable ET tube and tracheal Y stent.
4. Scattered 5 mm pulmonary nodules, some new. In a high-risk
patient
continued followup is recommended to assess stability.

Brief Hospital Course:
78 y/o F bronchiectasis, severe COPD, tracheobronchomalacia s/p
Y-stent who presents with respiratory distress and hypotension.
S/p trach and PEG tube this admission, now being discharged to
pulm rehab. See below for specific discussion of each problem.

# Respiratory Distress: Thought to be likely due to COPD
exaerbation with underlying component of tracheobronchomalacia
and bronchiectasis. Initial work-up revealed troponins negative
for myocardial ischemia, PE CTA negative for pulmonary embolus,
and bronchoscopy/bronchoalveolar lavage with Y-stent for
tracheobronchomalacia in appropriate place. She was started on
IV methylprednisolone 125mg IV q6H for presumed COPD
exacerbation, and this was gradually tapered. Remained on Q4h
ipratropium and albuterol inhalers. Respiratory cultures from
[**2-10**] grew gram negative rods. Given previous respiratory
cultures positive for pseudamonas, she completed a 12-day course
of vancomycin and levofloxacin and an 11-day course of
levofloxacin. For respiratory support, she was intubated on [**2-10**]
on AC ventilation. Failed multipled trials of PSV until finally
on [**2-15**] was successfully transitioned from AC to PSV. Was
extubated on [**2-16**] for 10 hours, then re-intubated due to
respiratory distress and hypertension to 200s requiring a nitro
drip. Subsequently failed several spontaneous breathing trials
(became hypertensive and tachycardic during these periods) with
significant distress. Discussed treatment options with
healthcare proxy (daughter) and rest of family, who ultimately
decided on tracheostomy and G-tube placement. Proceeded with
trache/G-tube placement on [**2153-2-23**] and worked with respiratory
therapist to wean off mechanical ventilation. On the trach mask,
she has been weaned slowly but still continues to be pretty
symptomatic when PS is <10. Has been stable on [**5-2**] for
approximately a day. Mostly seen is tachycardia when she becomes
uncomfortable.

# Hypotension: Patient arrived to MICU with elevated lactate
