Chest Pain

History of Present Illness:
61 year old male with a history of asthma and mild sleep apnea
describes many years of chest discomfort that have progressed in
frequency and duration. Currently he has daily episodes of
exertional chest discomfort. He reports that the discomfort
begins in the neck and spreads down to the chest. It typically
will resolve with rest but there was one time that he required
SL nitroglycerin to get relief of his discomfort. He has
undergone stress testing through the years. A myoview study was
negative in [**2101**]. Non imaging ETT in [**2106-5-26**] was positive for
chest pain but negative for ischemic EKG changes. He was
referred for cardiac catheterization to further evaluate. He was
found to have coronary artery disease and is now being referred
to cardiac surgery for revascularization.

Pertinent Results:
[**2107-2-3**] Cardiac cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this
right dominant system demonstrated left main and three vessel
disease. The LMCA had an eccentric 80% lesion distally near the
bifurcation. The LAD had a 90% stenosis both before and after
D1. The proximal aspect of D1 itself also had a 90% lesion. The
LCx had an ostial 90% lesion. The RCA was notable for an 80%
stenosis in the mid-PDA. 2. Limited resting hemodynamics
revealed normal systemic systolic arterial pressures, with a
central aortic pressure of 137/77, mean 93 mmHg.
.
[**2107-2-4**] Carotid U/S: Right ICA no stenosis. Left ICA <40%
stenosis.
.
[**2107-2-7**] Echo: 1. The left atrium is normal in size. 2. Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). 3. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 4. There are
simple atheroma in the aortic root. There are simple atheroma in
the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in the aortic
arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. 5. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurallynormal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. 6. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. 7. There
is a small pericardial effusion.
Post myocardial revascularization: The patient is on no
inotropes. The patient is atrially paced. Biventricular function
is unchanged. Mitral regurgitation is unchanged. The aorta is
intact after partial cross-clamping.
.
[**2107-2-10**] Chest X-ray: The patient was extubated with removal of
supporting tubes and lines. Bibasilar atelectasis and small
amount of pleural effusion is seen. Small left apical
pneumothorax is present. No right pneumothorax is seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 83016**] was admitted to the cardiology service with angina on
exertion for planned cardiac catheterization. On [**2-3**] he was
brought to the cath lab, it revealed left main and 3 vessel
disease. The patient was then referred to cardiac surgery for
surgical revascularization. He had the usual pre-op screen
including vein mapping, carotid ultrasound, labs, CXR, and MSSA
screen.
He was brought to the operating room by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 7772**] on [**2-7**]
for coronary artery bypass grafting. Please see the operative
report for details. In summary he had:
1. Urgent off-pump coronary artery bypass graft x3 -left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery and
saphenous vein grafts to obtuse marginal and
diagonal arteries. 2. Endoscopic harvesting of the long
saphenous vein.
He tolerated the operation well and post operatively was
transferred tot he cardiac surgery ICU in stable condition. In
the immediate post-op period he was stable, woke neurologically
intact and extubated. On [**2-8**] he transferred to the stepdown
floor.

Respiratory: aggressive pulmonary toilet nebs and ambulation he
titrated off oxygen with saturations of 97%.  Inhalers, singular
and home CPAP were continued.

Cardiac: low-dose beta-blockers were started. On postoperative
day 3 had intermittent atrial fibrillation 70-90's. Amiodarone
PO was started and he converted to sinus rhythm 60-70's.   A 3
months course of Plavix was started immediately postoperative
for off-Pump CABG. His heart rate became bradycardic into the
30s. Electrophysiology was consulted. Amio was discontinued. He
remains on beta-blocker with a stable HR in the 80s. Paroxysmal
AF continued and he was started on anticoagulation with
Coumadin.  He remained hemodynamically stable 110-130's. Low
dose aspirin and statin were continued.

GI: benign. Tolerated a regular diet

Renal: He was gently diuresed toward his preop weight of 100 kg.
 Renal function CRE peaked to 1.4 base 0.9-1.2. His diuretic was
decreased.  He continued to have good urine output. Electrolytes
were closely monitored and repleted as needed. Foley reinserted
for failure to void. Flomax was restarted and voiding trial with
good results.

Endocrine: well controlled with insulin sliding scale.

Disposition: he was seen by physical therapy who recommended
rehab.  He was discharged on POD# 8 to [**Hospital 83017**] Nursing and Rehab
in [**Location (un) 1456**]. All follow up appointments were advised.
