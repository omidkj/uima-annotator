[**9-5**] EGD -
Esophagus: Normal esophagus.
Stomach:  Excavated Lesions Two 10mm ulcers were found in the
antrum, above pylorus, at 12 o'clock and 2 o'clock. 2nd ulcer
had visible vessel, nonbleeding.. [**Hospital1 **]-CAP Electrocautery was
applied to the 2nd ulcer for hemostasis successfully.
Duodenum: Normal duodenum.
Impression: Ulcers in the antrum, above pylorus, at 12 o'clock
and 2 o'clock. 2nd ulcer had visible vessel, nonbleeding.
(thermal therapy)


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 76 year old woman with ESRD on HD, DM, CAD, CHF,
atrial fibrilation on coumadin who presented with coffee-ground
emesis and positive NG lavage suggestive of an upper GI bleed.
She also presented with a Hct of 16 and a supratherapeutic INR
of 6.1. She was admitted to the MICU and received a total of 3 u
FFP, vitamin K and 3 U PRBCs. Coumadin and aspirin were stopped.
She underwent an upper endoscopy on [**9-5**] which showed 2
non-bleeding gastric ulcers. One ulcer was noted to have an
exposed blood vessel that was cauterized. Biopsies came back
positive for H.pylori, so she was started on triple therapy of
clarithromycin, flagyl, and protonix - she has 11 days left of
the antibiotics to complete and needs to remain on the PPI [**Hospital1 **]
until follow-up with GI. Her Hct has been stable after the EGD,
ranging from 31-37, and she was transferred to the medical
floor. No further signs of active bleeding were noted. She was
restarted on low-dose Aspirin on [**9-7**]; however, her coumadin
will need to be held for at least one month until she follows up
with GI.
.
Secondary issues:
.
# CAD - while in the MICU, patient was noted to have lateral and
inferior ST changes concerning for ischemia in ED and elevated
biomarkers (trop 0.18 on admission, negative CK). This was
thought to be related to demand ischemia secondary to her acute
anemia. Her repeat EKGs have since improved and she was
restarted on her aspirin on [**2124-9-7**]. She was continued on her
metoprolol and simvastatin.

# Afib - continued on metoprolol, anticoagulation has been
stopped (coumadin) until patient follows up with GI in [**10-11**].

# ESRD - on HD Tu/Th/Sa. Continue nephrocaps, calcium, and
phos-lo.

# Pelvic fractures - This was thought to be secondary to
adynamic [**Date Range 500**] disease and less likely secondary
hyperparathyroidism in the setting of ESRD. Both [**12-30**] hydroxy
vitamin D and 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels were sent and pending
at the time of discharge. The patient is scheduled for a BMD on
[**2124-9-13**] and has follow-up with endocrinology on [**2124-9-20**]. Her
calcium acetate needs to be held on the day of the BMD.

# DM - continued on fixed dose NPH (16 units q AM, 3 units qPM)
and sliding scale coverage.

# Pressure ulcer - patient noted to have a pressure ulcer on her
sacrum and was seen by wound care. Recommended following
pressure ulcer guidelines for treatment, including dry gauze
dressing changes daily.
