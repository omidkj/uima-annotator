CXR: [**2160-10-13**]
FINDINGS: A temporary pacemaker lead has been placed via a left
internal jugular approach and there is a defibrillator pad
overlying the lower right hemithorax. There is more marked
elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. The heart and mediastinal
contours are stable. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. The
pleural spaces are normal and the lungs are clear, with the left
costophrenic angle excluded from the radiograph.
IMPRESSION: Elevated left hemidiaphragm, with no evidence of
acute cardiopulmonary process.
.
Echocardiogram: [**2160-10-14**]
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Compared with the
prior study (images reviewed) of [**2158-8-15**] , estimated pulmonary
artery pressure is now lower.
.
TEE [**2160-10-20**]:
Conclusions:
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Right
ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses
or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis or
paravalvular
abcess.
.
ABD u/s:
INDICATION: Liver transplant with LFT abnormalities.
LIVER DOPPLER: The right common, middle, and left hepatic veins
appear patent with appropriate directionality of flow. The main
hepatic artery is patent. The portal veins are patent with
hepatopetal flow. Incidental note is made of a small cyst in the
right lobe of the liver. There is no evidence of biliary ductal
dilatation.
IMPRESSION: Patent hepatic vasculature
.
[**2160-10-24**] RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND: Using the
linear probe, grayscale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right
common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal vessels were
performed. There is no intraluminal thrombus. The vessels
demonstrate normal flow, compressibility, respiratory
variability, and augmentation.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 64 y.o male w/ h/o HCV cirrhosis s/p liver transplant, and
several other comorbidities presents s/p complete heart block.
.
#Paroxysmal AV Block: pt presented to OSH w/ AV block, possibly
secondary to hyperkalemia, which is thought to be due to pt's
FK506/tacrolimus.  Pt had temp pacer wire placed at OSH.  By
time of transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], pt was out of AB blocke & in NSR.
His temp line was eventually removed here as there were no
further signs of AV block.  He was monitored on telemetry.
Placement of permanent pacer delayed due infectious issues.  Pt
spiked temps, had (+) bld and line cx's--bld cx grew
enterococcus and PICC line grew coag negative staph.  Given
these issues, plan made for pt to have permanent pacer placed
after completion of 4wk course of antibiotics, followed by 2wks
of monitoring for fever and blood cultures.  If pt is fever free
and has no further positive cultures during this period, he will
go for pacemaker placement with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of [**Hospital1 18**].
.
# Infections: h/o MRSA, VRE and recurrent PNA.  Pt had recurrent
fevers during early part of hospital stay.  Fevers thought to be
due to bacteremia--bld cx's grew enterococcus (last (+) blood cx
from [**10-14**]), which was sensitive to vanco.  Pt's right PICC line
(from [**10-15**]) grew coag negative staph resistant to oxacillin.
Subsequent surveillane cultures were negative.  Source of
enterococcus in blood not identified.  Pt had pustule on LLE,
but not felt to be source of infection.  Pt had no further
positive blood cultures after those listed above.  He last
spiked a tempurate on the night of [**10-17**].  Pt did have
pseudomonas in the sputum, which was treated for a period with
cefepime.  However, pt had little evidence of respiratory
infection and the pseudomonas was thought to be colonizers, thus
the cefepime was discontinued.  Pt underwent TEE which was
negative f
