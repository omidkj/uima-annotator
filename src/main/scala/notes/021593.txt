ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
The patient was diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in

[**9-/2165**] and treated with eight cycles of R-CHOP and 25 doses of

XRT, finished in 6/[**2165**]. In [**6-/2166**], relapsed with
disease found in periaortic lymph nodes and in the spleen. He
received one cycle of ICE chemotherapy on [**2166-8-11**], underwent
autologous stem cell transplant and was discharged [**2166-11-11**].
Follow up PET scan on [**2167-1-30**] demonstrated recurrent persistent
uptake in the spleen, mesentery, and with new liver and
pulmonary lesions. Liver biopsy demonstrated diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma and he was treated with three weekly doses of
Rituxan but continued to progress. He was treated with salvage
therapy with one cycle of MINE chemotherapy as an inpatient
starting [**2167-4-23**] and CT scan demonstrated response in the lung
and liver with stable disease in the spleen. The patient was
admitted for a second cycle of MINE
chemotherapy on [**2167-6-4**]. He received a nonmyeloablative
sibling-matched allogeneic SCT in 8/[**2166**]. He has had severe
chronic GVHD of the skin and oropharyngeal mucosa; he is
currently undergoing Rituxan weekly x4 for GVHD, last completed
at end of [**Month (only) 958**].

Social History:
No changes since last admission:
He lives with his wife and 6 year old son. [**Name (NI) **] works as a sales
manager for [**Company 56968**], although he has been out of work
recently due to his recent hospitalizations. He does not smoke
and has not had any alcohol intake since prior to transplant.


Family History:
No changes since last admission:
His paternal grandmother had breast cancer and a paternal uncle
had cancer of an unknown etiology. His father had diabetes and
died of a myocardial infarction.

.
CTA Chest ([**2170-4-7**])
1. New right lower lobe consolidation consistent with acute
pneumonia.
2. Multiple nodular opacities in the right and left upper lobes
are grossly unchanged. Stable small left pleural effusion.
.
CT Chest ([**2170-4-14**])
1. Marked interval increase in the large left pleural effusion
with
associated compressive left lower lobe atelectasis. An embedded
focus of
consolidation with a parapneumonic effusion cannot be excluded.
2. Small focus of tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacity at superolateral right
middle lobe
(2:24) may reflect evolving infection/inflammation.
3. Interval improvement in the right lower lobe atelectasis with
better
parenchymal aeration of the right lung. Multiple bilateral
pulmonary nodules are unchanged since [**2170-4-7**].
.
Echo ([**2170-4-17**])
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45-50 %). Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed. Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild global left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with normal estimated left
ventricular filling pressure. Tachycardia. Compared with the
prior study (images reviewed) of [**2170-3-15**], the heart rate is
faster. The other findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient presented to outpatient clinic with hypotension and
tachycardia.  Attempted stabilization on floor, but then
admitted to the ICU for management.
.
#Pneumosepsis: Patient admitted to the ICU for management.
Impression on admission was for sepsis.  Patient was
aggressively volume resuscitated with improvement in his BP and
HR.  Started on cefepime and caspofungin on arrival.  Central
venous access was attempted w/o success.  Left IJ repeatedly
coiled and turned upwards into R-IJ on CXR.  Line was d/c'd and
decision was made to use PICC line in interim period.  Blood
cultures grew strep pneumo pan sensitive and patient was
narrowed to nafcillin but then later changed to ceftriaxone
given its improved activity against strep infections.  CT of the
chest confirmed lobar infiltrate in RLL w/o evidence of
significant effusion.  Patient became mildly hypoxic following
rehydration requiring at peak time 4L NC.  Subsequently
respiratory status improved to 2L at time of call out from ICU,
but still desating with exertion.  CXR demonstrated minimal
pleural effusion on right at site of infiltrate and moderate
L-pleural effusion thought to be related to fluids. A repeat
