History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 86198**] is a 81 year old man with a history of CHF,
Afib, COPD and DM2 presented to an OSH after several days of
nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea with new onset altered mental
status. His family reports several family members with similar
recent GI symptoms. At the OSH he was found to be febrile 102.8,
hypotensive (77/44), confused, and hypoglycemic (fsbs 45). He
underwent chest x-ray and was started on vancomycin and zosyn
for presumed hospital acquired pneumonia. He was also given 2 L
IVF and started on stress dose steroids for history of COPD with
frequent steroid use. His INR was found to be 11 and he was
given Vitamin K 10 mg IV. His blood pressure was documented as
77/44 and he was started on peripheral levophed. Due to bed
availablity patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
In the ED, initial VS: T 100.1 HR 110 BP 94/55 RR 26 SpO2 100%
4L NC. WBC was elevated at 12 with 22% bands. He underwent CXR
which did not show clear evidence of pneumonia. Urinalysis was
negative for infection. RUQ U/S was suggestive of possible acute
cholecystitis. Surgery was consulted. They did not recommend
urgent surgery given his hemodynamic instability and
supratherapeutic INR. They recommended perc cholecystectomy in
the morning pending correction of his INR and stable blood
pressures. CVL was placed and levophed was titrated to MAP > 65.
He received 4 g IV prior to transfer to the ICU.
.
On arrival to the ICU, patient is alert and oriented. He admits
to poor appetite and RUQ pain with deep inspiration or
palpation. He reports several days of increased fevers and
chills. He admits to increased loose stools and nausea. He
denies any hematuria, dysuria, productive cough, chest pain,
black or tarry stools, BRBPR, history of blood clots.
.
Of note, patient had multiple recent hospital admission in
[**State 108**] for CHF exacerbations and pneumonia.

========
.
ECHO [**3-12**]:
moderately dilated left ventricle with severe global LV
hypokinesis. Dilated and hypokinetic RV. The mid lateral wall
has relatively preserved function. Calcific aortic stenosis that
is probably severe/critical - low flow state makes calculation
of valve area difficult. Mild mitral regurgitation.
.
CT Torso [**3-12**]:
1. Bibasilar consolidations and smaller bilateral pulmonary
opacities
compatible with multifocal infection. Small right and trace left
pleural
effusions.
2. Similar appearance of moderately dilated and edematous
gallbladder with a small calculus.
3. Findings compatible with pulmonary arterial hypertension.
4. Cardiomegaly, coronary artery calcifications and significant
atherosclerotic involvement of the thoracic and abdominal aorta
and branches.
5. Multilevel severe degenerative changes in the thoracolumbar
spine.


Brief Hospital Course:
.
MRSA/Pseudomonas Pneumonia: Mr. [**Known lastname 86198**] was empirically
started Vancomycin and Zosyn on presentation due to sepsis and
suspicion for hospital acquired pneumonia.  Sputum cultures grew
MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  Chest CT was consistent with
multilobar pneumonia.
.
MRSA Bacteremia:  Blood cultures from OSH yielded two out of
four bottles positive for MRSA.  He was started on Vancomycin
empirically on arrival to the ED.  With positive cultures, ID
team was consulted who recommended completing a three week
course of Vancomycin.  This will be complete on [**4-8**].
.
Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: Medical records from
OSH suggested systolic heart failure and aortic stenosis.
Transthoracic echo was performed during this admission which
showed no evidence of vegetations.  Aortic valve area was
measured at 0.8 cm2 and EF was 10%.   After resuscitation for
sepsis, he was significantly volume overloaded but with
borderline low BP (low 90s systolic).  The cardiac consulting
team was involved.  Standing IV lasix 80 mg TID was started but
intermittently held for hypotension.  On this regimen he
improved significantly, although significant lower extremity
edema persisted.   He was changed to oral lasix 80 mg [**Hospital1 **]. On
discharge, he was changed to 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] lasix and metolazone was
added. Clinical status was notable for [**1-17**]+ lower extremity
edema with clear lungs, mild orthopnea, and O2 Sats in the mid
daily and consider increasing lasix or continuing metolazone
beyond the 1 week in order to achieve euvolemia.
.
Coronary artery disease: Patient with elevated troponin on
presentation.  Concurrent chest heaviness, shortness of breath
and elevated cardiac enzymes was concerning for ACS.  Patient
was continued on daily aspirin, home dose statin was increased.
He was placed on a heparin gtt for 48 hours as empiric medical
management of ACS.  His enzymes trended down. Beta blocker was
initially held due to significant hypotension.  Patient's
outpatient cardiologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 86199**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] who revealed
that the patient has known three vessel disease diagnosed on
cardiac catheterization in [**2174**].  He was uncertain as to why
patient did not undergo any interventions at that time.   The
cardiac consulting team was involved and thought that this was
likely demand ischemia and did not think any intervention was
appropriate.  Troponin trended down.  Chest heaviness recurred
intermittently in the absence of EKG changes or troponin
elevation.  It is possible that this represents angina.  He had
previously been on a long-acting nitrate.  This was restarted at
a lower dose on discharge and should be titrated to comfort as
BP tolerates.  Follow up was arranged with his cardiologist, and
discharge summary will be faxed.
.
Atrial fibrillation:  Beta blocker was initially held given
hypotension.  This was restarted at a lower dose when he was
hemodynamically stable.  Rate control was adequate.  He was
anticoagulated with a supratherapeutic INR on admission, having
received Vitamin K 10 mg IV at OSH prior to arrival.  Coumadin
was held initially.  INR was closely monitored while on
antibiotics.  Coumadin was restarted when INR fell in o
