Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Ultrafiltration/Hemodialysis


History of Present Illness:
74 yo F with ESRD on HD (TThSat), T2DM, sCHF, and other medical
issues presented with SOB from [**Hospital1 100**] Senior Life. Shortness of
breath started Sunday with non-productive cough.  She reported
mild nasal congestion and subjective fevers.  Had mild nausea on
Sunday and on the day of her presentation.  Denied sore throat,
chills, chest pain, palpitation, V/D, abdominal pain, diarrhea,
constipation.  She stated that her weight is usually around 98
lb.  She denied any LE swelling, orthopnea, PND.  She denies
drinking excessive fluid but endorses having very salty soup at
[**Hospital1 2286**] on Saturday. Reports from daughter also confirm patient
takes salty chips due to dislike with food at rehab and being a
picky eater.  Patient states that she makes urine but very small
amounts and only intermittently

In the ED, initial VS were: 98.6 63 145/66 20 97% 2L.  However,
O2 sat dropped to the 70%, requiring titration to 4L.  Labs were
notable for WBC 5.6, Hgb 8.6, Hct 27.4, Plt 161, Crt 4.1, blood
cultures x 2 pending.  ECG showed sinus, ~70, axis is normal but
decreased amplitude for QRS in I/aVL, sub-mm STD in III and III,
TWI in aVL, and V2, poor R wave progression, flattened T wave in
V3.  CXR showed increased right sided pleural effusion, hazy
opacity in the RML c/w pulmonary edema.  Patient was given
levofloxacin 750 mg IV x1 for concern of possible pneumonia.
Nephrology was informed about patient for possible need of
[**Hospital1 2286**].  Patient is DNR.  Upon transfer, VS were BP 144/55 HR
63 RR 25 pOx 88 % on 5 L NC, A&Ox3.

On arrival to the MICU, patient reports breathing is better. She
was further diuresed and sent to the floor on 2L of O2

Imaging:
[**2206-3-24**]
CXR lateral: A single lateral view of the chest was provided.
Layering effusions are seen, right greater than left. Further
evaluation is not possible on this single lateral view.

CXR portable: FINDINGS: Portable AP upright chest radiograph
obtained. A right subclavian venous stent is again noted. There
are pleural effusions, right greater than left. There is hazy
opacity obscuring the majority of the right mid-lower lung which
is most compatible with pulmonary edema, though a component of
the layering effusion is also possible. Pulmonary edema is less
evident in the left lung. The heart size is difficult to assess
but appears grossly stable.  Atherosclerotic calcification along
the thoracic aorta noted.  Tracheobronchial tree calcification
is also noted. Bony structures are intact. Clips in the upper
abdomen noted.
IMPRESSION: Possible pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural
effusions, right greater than left.

[**2206-3-25**]
CXR Number 1:
COMPARISON: [**2206-3-24**].
SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST: In comparison to prior
radiograph,
there is little relevant change. Right subclavian venous stent
is in
unchanged position. Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater
than left are again present, unchanged. No focal opacities
concerning for a developing infectious process. Atherosclerotic
calcifications throughout the thoracic aorta as well as the
tracheobronchial tree are noted. No pneumothora
CXR Number 2:
Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day
earlier in the
morning.
Right pleural effusion has decreased in amount, now small. It is
associated  with a large atelectasis in the right lower lobe.
Mild cardiomegaly is stable. There is no pneumothorax. The aorta
is tortuous. A stent in the right subclavian vein is again
noted. Multiple surgical clips are present in the upper abdomen.

Left pleural effusion has resolved. The main pulmonary arteries
are enlarged as before.

[**2206-3-26**]
CXR Number 3 - Lateral decub
FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**3-25**], there has been
removal of some
pleural fluid from the right chest. The fluid collection in the
minor fissure has essentially been eliminated. However, right
lateral decubitus view shows a substantial amount of free
pleural fluid layering out along the right chest wall

[**2203-3-27**]
FINDINGS: There is a severely enlarged heart, unchanged in size
from [**2203**]. A left sided subclavian stent is in place. There are
also significant vascular calcifications throughout the aortic
arch, great vessels and descending aorta. A metalic structure is
seen within the caudal segments of the heart (2:40) which was
present since at least [**2201**], but not prior to this. Surgical
history in OMR reveals no clear correlation.
  Calcifications are also seen in the tracheobronchial tree, as
well as subdiaphragmatically throughout all the branches of the
aorta. Severe coronary artery calcifications of the LAD, left
circumflex artery as well as the aortic annulus are also
present. There is no substantial appreciable mediastinal
lymphadenopathy; however, without IV contrast, it is difficult
to ascertain.
  There is a simple-measuring, layering, nonhemorrhagic small
right-sided
pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis adjacent to it. No
definitive masses or nodules are identified in either lung.
There is no left-sided effusion. Minimal areas of
