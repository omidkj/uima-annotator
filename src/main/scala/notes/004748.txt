carcinomatosis and worsening of large volume ascities. Abnormal
hepatic perfusion with new mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation.

metastatic disease though infection should be excluded

Brief Hospital Course:
72 year old male with newly diagnosed stage IV gastric
adenocarcinoma, peritoneal carcinomatosis presenting with
increased abdominal distension, ascites and no bowel movement x
3 days.
.
# widely metastatic gastric cancer - patient has been evaluated
by surgery and is not a surgical candidate.  He was seen by
Heme-Onc during his last hospitalization and scheduled for outpt
follow-up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for palliative chemo options
(Has not yet seen Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Seen by Palliative Care
yesterday who spoke with nephew, [**Name (NI) **].  Appreciate
interventions.  Are willing to assist in Family Meeting.
Oncology recommended continuing with xeloda as an outpatient and
they will continue to follow.  Continue pain management with
fentanyl patch and morphine elixir at home.  Hospice service
will follow the patient at home.

# abd distension -  Initial concern for ileus on admission,
however, no evidence of ileus on admission.  Patient has been
constipated for 2 weeks although had a bowel movement 3 days
prior to admission.  He was not taking bowel regimen (colace,
senna, MOM) at home.  He had 4 bowel movements on [**2132-9-29**] after
restarting colace, senna and lactulose so this can be held for a
few days.  His abdominal distension was from large ascites.  He
had a paracentesis with 3.5L amber colored drainage (some blood
so from malignant ascites from peritoneal carcinomatosis).
Patient will be set up with Interventional Radiology
paracentesis after discharge.  Will likely need outpatient
paracentesis every 5-7 days.  He is not a candidate for port
placement (for home drainage) until he is on hospice (ie - no
longer taking xeloda or other chemotherapy) per Oncology.  He is
tolerating po's.

# Tachycardia - Resolved the night of admit with paracentesis of
3.5L, reinstitution of metoprolol and fluid bolus of 1L.  Thus,
likely resultant from hypovolemia, increased abdominal pressure
and b-blocker withdrawal.  Also considered dehydration, not
taking metoprolol, side-effect from xeloda and PE.  No note of
tachycardia on his last discharge, EKG on [**9-23**] w/ HR 95.  Heart
rate 70's-90's thereafter.

# Wheezing - has asthma and emphysema.  Patient denies feeling
short of breath.  Abdominal ascites may have been contributing
to taking rapid breaths and wheezing.
Started nebulizer treatments.  Patient set up with home oxygen
prior to discharge as he remained on 2L oxygen after
paracentesis (O2 sat < 88% at rest and with ambulation on room
air).  Continued on home inhalers on discharge.

# Hyponatre
