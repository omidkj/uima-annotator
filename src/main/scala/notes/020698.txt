Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2782**]
Chief Complaint:
respiratory disress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo lady with a history of COPD, CHF,
alzheimer's and expressive aphasia, who presented from her
nursing home to the ED in respiratory distress on [**2152-7-26**] about
1.5 hours after eating her lunch. She has had an episode of
aspiration about one year ago as well as urosepsis a few months
ago. In the ED, her vitals were T 98.9F, HR 130, BP 158/66, RR
40 and O2 sat of 91% on RL. A chest xray taken showed widespread
coarse reticular opacities but no signs of consolidation. She
was given solumedrol given her history of COPD. She was also
started on IV Vancomycine and Aztreonam (due to a PCN allergy)
as well as metronidazole. She was also given 1L Normal Saline
for alactate of 4.7.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia. She was then
admitted to the MICU for further care.

In the MICU, her Aztreonam was dc'ed, and she was started on
cefepime instead. She was also started on an insulin sliding
scale. Her lactate returned to 1.3, and her cre and WBC trended
down as well (WBC 26). Her IV fluids were tricky since any flow
>75cc/hr led to hypertension with sbp int he 170's. However, she
was able to tolerate small boluses of fluids. A straight cath
performed also showed purulent liquid, though her urine cultures
from [**2152-7-25**] were negative. After a few hours in the MICU, she
was transferred to the floor.

CXR ([**7-28**]):

FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of [**7-25**], the diffuse
bilateral pulmonary opacifications are less prominent.  Some of
this may reflect the PA rather than AP frontal view.  Blunting
of the costophrenic angles is consistent with bilateral pleural
effusions with some compressive atelectasis at the bases.

CXR ([**7-25**]):
FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a
mild increase in the diameter of the pulmonary vessels,
potentially indicative of mild fluid overload.  In addition, the
atelectasis at the left lung base has increased in extent and
there is blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, potentially
caused by a small left pleural effusion.  No cardiomegaly.
Unchanged tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  No pneumothorax.

EKG: [**2152-6-30**]:
Sinus rhythm and occasional atrial ectopy. Low limb lead
voltage. Prior
anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Compared to the previous
tracing
of [**2152-7-26**] the axis is more rightward, atrial ectopy has
appeared. Otherwise, no diagnostic interim change.

Brief Hospital Course:

and aspiration who presented from her nursing home in acute
respiratory distress after eating lunch.

SIRS 4 PROGRESS NOTE [**2152-7-29**]
Assessment and Plan:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **]F with a history of COPD, alzheimer's dementia,
and aspiration who presented from her nursing home in acute
respiratory distress after eating lunch.

# Respiratory Distress: Possibly secondary to aspiration, which
is consistent with the presentation 1.5 hours after lunch.
Initial CXR showed multiple reticular opacities but no
consolidations. Repeat CXR showed less prominant bilateral
opacifications, though there is possible bilateral pleural
effusions with some compressed atelectasis at the bases.
Initially on Vancomycin and Cefepime, switched to IV Ceftriaxone
to treat UTI since pna was unlikely. IVF was at 40cc/ml for the
last 3 days of her hospitalization. PO trial of thick liquids
started on [**2152-7-29**], which pt tolerated well. Lungs sounded a lot
clearer with residual right base crackles. Pt breathing
comfortably at 94% O2 sat on room air.

# Abnormal EKG - Admission EKG read yesterday by Cardiology, who
was concerned about possible acute event. However, EKG compared
with one in [**2142**], which also showed similar changes. Troponins
elevated at 0.06 x 2 but did not trend up, likely from transient
ischemia due to increased cardiac demand [**12-30**] infection. No signs
of acute cardiac event. Medical management with beta blocker,
asa discussed with family, who declined due to allergy to asa
and desire for minimal medication.  Patient did tolerate
beta-blocker (metoprolol 6.25mg) for one dose and seemed to perk
up afterwards, but given difficulty i
