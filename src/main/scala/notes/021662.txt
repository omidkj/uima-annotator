Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
Left upper abdominal pain and chest pain for 2 days. Transfer
from OSH.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 41447**] is a 79 year-old male with a past medical history
significant for HTN and ruptured AAA status post AAA repair 6
years ago, transferred from [**Hospital3 **] Hospital with a concern
over for possible type B aortic dissection.

He presented to the OSH on [**2196-2-13**] at night with a 2-day
history of left upper abdominal pain, initially low-grade, then
severe to 13/10 on the day of presentation, sharp,
non-radiating. He denies any associated N/V, no SOB, no
worsening LH or dizziness (per patient, he experiences chronic
LH and dizziness symptoms). No back pain. At the OSH, a CTPA was
negative for PE, but revealed a ? descending thoracic aortic
aneurysm. His SBP was in the 160s on presentation, and he was
given Labetalol 20 mg IV X 1 given, followed by Nitroprusside
drip started at 0.1 mcg/kg/min, titrated up for goal SBP<120. He
also received Toradol 30 mg IV, and Protonix 40 mg IV. He was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further management.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vitals were T 98, HR 62, BP 116/74 on
Nipride, RR 11, Sat 96% on room air. He was seen by thoracic
surgery, who recommended medical management. He was admitted to
the CCU for further care.

History of ruptured AAA, status post AAA repair 6 years ago
Hypertension
Spinal stenosis, status post laminectomy C4-C5
Gastroesophageal reflux disease
History of CVA

Social History:

smoking history.

Relevant data in hospital:

[**2196-2-15**] CT CHEST W/IV CONTRAST: Diffuse emphysematous changes
are noted throughout the lungs. No lung mass is identified. No
mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.

CT ABDOMEN W/IV CONTRAST: The liver, adrenals, spleen, pancreas,
and kidneys are unremarkable. Simple cysts are noted within the
left kidney. No adenopathy.

CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: A Foley catheter is in place within
the urinary bladder. Prostatic calcifications are seen. The
colon appears unremarkable.

CT ARTERIOGRAM WITH IV CONTRAST, RECONSTRUCTIONS: The ascending
aorta demonstrates borderline enlargement, measuring 4 cm in
maximal axial dimension. Thoracic aorta measures 3.3 cm at the
isthmus, and 3.3 cm at the diaphragmatic hiatus. Thoracic aorta
is markedly tortuous. Within the distal descending thoracic
aorta, two areas of ulceration are identified measuring up to
approximately 7 mm. There is thickening of the posterolateral
aortic wall in the areas of penetrating ulcer, which are
thickened to approximately 1 cm. Unfortunately, since a
noncontrast CT scan of the chest was not performed prior to
contrast administration, acute hematoma vs. chronic thrombus
cannot be distinguished. However, given the relatively low
density of the aortic wall, thrombus is probably more likely. No
evidence of intimal flap within the thoracic aorta.

Abdominal aorta is normal in size, measuring up to 2.8 cm. The
celiac artery and superior mesenteric artery are widely patent.
The root of the inferior mesenteric artery is not opacified,
however, demonstrates contrast material shortly after its
origin. This may be related to relatively less contrast within
the anterior abdominal aorta at the level of the [**Female First Name (un) 899**] origin. A
surgical clip is also identified near the infrarenal abdominal
aorta on the right. Synthetic graft material is seen within the
distal aorta, extending into the origins of both common iliac
arteries. Shortly beyond the prosthetic graft limbs within the
common iliac arteries, there is aneurysmal dilatation of the
common iliac arteries. The right common iliac artery measures up
to 3.4 cm in maximal axial dimension, and the left common iliac
artery measures 2.8 cm. The internal and external iliac arteries
are patent, however, examination for subtle abnormalities within
these vessels is limited due to relatively poor opacification of
the distal abdominal aorta and iliac vessels.

No evidence of periaortic fluid or hematoma. A small amount of
wall thickening is seen within the distal abdominal aorta,
suggestive of thrombus.

The renal arteries are widely patent. Incidental note is made of
replaced left and right hepatic arteries.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious bony lesions. Degenerative changes
are seen within the thoracic and lumbar spine.

IMPRESSION:
1) Penetrating ulcers within the distal descending thoracic
aorta. Slight wall thickening within the distal thoracic aorta
may represent chronic thrombus, however, acute hematoma is less
likely. No intimal flap identified.

2) Post surgical changes within the abdominal aorta, with large
iliac artery aneurysms as described.

Brief Hospital Course:
79 year-old male with a history of HTN and AAA rupture s/p AAA
repair 6 years prior to admission, who presented to an OSH with
c/o abdominal pain, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] given concern for
possible thoracic aortic dissection. His hospital course will be
reviewed by problems.

1) R/O aortic dissection: The OSH CT was reviewed on admission
with the radiology resident, with a differential diagnosis of
descending thoracic aortic dissection versus hematoma. CT
surgery was consulted and recommended medical management with
heart rate and blood pressure control. Mr. [**Known lastname 41447**] was admitted
to the CCU for close hemodynamic monitoring.

While in the CCU, he was continued on a Nipride drip for tight
blood pressure control, with goal SBP<120. A repeat CTA was
performed on [**2196-2-15**], which revealed penetrating ulcers within
the distal descending thoracic aorta, with slight wall
thickening felt to possibly represent a thrombus versus
hematoma, but without evidence of dissection. He remained pain
free in the CCU, and was transitioned to oral medications with
Metoprolol and Captopril, both titrated up to meet goal blood
pressure parameters. He remained stable throughout, with stable
hematocrit. Norvasc 5 mg PO QD was added on the day of discharge
for tighter blood pressure control.

Long-term risk factor management was also addressed. A lipid
profile revealed LDL 84. He was started on Lipitor 40 mg PO QD,
with goal LDL<70. He will need follow-up LFTs. Smoking cessation
counseling was also initiated, and will need to be readdressed
with Mr. [**Known lastname 41447**] as an out-patient.

He was discharged on Lisinopril 20 mg PO QD, Toprol 25 mg PO QD
and Norvasc 5 mg PO QD. He will need close BP monitoring as an
out-patient. He will also need a repeat CTA torso to assess
interval change in [**6-15**] weeks.

2) COPD: Mr. [**Known lastname 41447**] was noted to have significant wheezing on
admission. He was given bronchodilator therapy via nebulizers,
and started on Advair diskus, with significant improvement in
his respirat
