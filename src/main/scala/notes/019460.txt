History of Present Illness:
70 y/o male with h/o CAD s/p LAD PTCA [**92**] yrs ago, COPD, T2DM,
and AICD pocket infection who presented to the ED on [**2177-7-27**]
with worsening SOB x 5 days and feeling "cloudy." The patient
was currently at [**Hospital3 **] and began to develop worsening
SOB for the past 5 days. This AM while talking with his daughter
on the phone, he was noted to desaturate into the high 80s and
he was brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation. The
patient states that he has felt "cloudy" of late which seems to
relate to his worsening SOB. He is not ambulatory and is very
deconditioned secondary to several complications within the past
two months related to an AICD pocket infection. He denies any
CP, N/V/D, abdominal pain, or HA. He states that he only uses
one pillow to sleep but admits to sleeping at about 30 degrees
at rehab.
.
In the ED, his VS were 97.8  150/80  88  12  89-94% 3L NC. He
was given Percocet for back pain, Lasix 80 mg IV, and Combivent
neb. For unclear reasons, he was placed on a [**Name (NI) 597**] in the ED.
.
Upon arrival to the CCU, he was hemodynamically stable. He was
quickly weaned to 3L O2 via NC, O2 sats 100%.

.
Imaging Studies:
1. CXR (PA/Lateral) [**2177-7-27**]
Congestive heart failure with bilateral effusions (R>L), with
possible underlying consolidation in the RLL and to a lesser
degree the RML and LLL.
.
2. CXR [**2177-7-28**]
Compared to PA and lateral chest of the prior day. Right-sided
PICC line with its tip in the distal SVC. The heart is markedly
enlarged. There remains a large right and small left pleural
effusion, not significantly changed. Patient remains in
congestive heart failure, though it may be slightly improved
compared to the prior study. Underlying infectious consolidation
in the right lower lobe not excluded.
.
3. Echo [**2177-7-28**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. LV systolic function appears depressed. Resting regional
wall motion abnormalities include inferior and inferolateral
hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber size is normal and free
wall motion may be mildly impaired. The aortic root is mildly
dilated. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. A bioprosthetic aortic valve
prosthesis is present. The aortic prosthesis leaflets appear to
move normally. The transaortic gradient is normal for this
prosthesis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling
abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. Transmitral
Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade
III/IV (severe) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2177-7-7**], ventricular function is now similar. EF 35-40%.
.
4. Echo [**2177-8-7**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left ventricular cavity
size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function
cannot be reliably assessed. 3l. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.  Compared with the
prior study (images reviewed) of [**2177-7-28**], there is
probably no significant change.
.
All cultures, including BCx, UCx, pleural fluid culture, and
wound culture have been negative.
.
5. CT Chest [**2177-8-9**]:
1. Increasing large right-sided pleural effusion and pulmonary
edema. Scattered parenchymal opacities in the left lower lobe
represent superimposed infection vs atelectasis. There is no
evidence of abscess.
.
6. [**2177-8-21**] Chest X Ray:
SINGLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST. There has been almost complete
resolution of pulmonary edema. A small right pleural effusion
has decreased in size. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. There is no
pneumothorax. Right PIC catheter tip ends in the lower SVC.
Patient is post median sternotomy.
.
IMPRESSION: Almost complete resolution of pulmonary edema.
.
7. [**2177-8-22**] CT Head:
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of intraaxial or extraaxial
hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normally midline structures,
or acute major or minor vascular territorial infarction. The
ventricles and sulci are mildly prominent, but stable in size
and appearance. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is
preserved. Again seen are subtle hypodensities within the
periventricular white matter which is an indication of chronic
microvascular ischemic changes, stable. Extensive carotid artery
calcifications are identified. The visualized paranasal sinuses
are clear. The surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures
are unremarkable.
.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute or chronic infarction. Stable
microvascular ischemic changes in the periventricular white
matter.
.
8. [**2177-8-23**] EEG:
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to the moderately slow posterior
background and occasional bursts of generalized slowing. These
findings
indicate a widespread encephalopathic condition affecting both
cortical
and subcortical structures. Medications, metabolic disturbances,
and
infection are among the most common causes. No prominent focal
abnormalities were evident, and there were no epileptiform
features.
The cardiac monitor showed occasional irregularities in a PACED
rhythm.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 70 y/o male with h/o CAD, T2DM, hyperlipidemia, and COPD
who presented to the ED on [**2177-7-27**] with worsening SOB x 5 days
from [**Hospital3 **]. Pt. was initially admitted to CCU on
[**2177-7-27**], transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 6 on [**2177-7-29**], triggered on [**2177-8-3**]
for hypotension with BP 67/38 and transferred back to CCU on
[**2177-8-3**]. He remained fluid overloaded and a swan cat
