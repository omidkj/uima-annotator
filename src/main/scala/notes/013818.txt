CXR Portable ([**2126-12-4**])
FINDINGS: AP portable upright view of the chest is obtained.
Evaluation is
limited given the low lung volumes and the patient's kyphotic
and slightly
rotated positioning. There is a single-lead pacer device
projecting over the left chest wall with single lead tip
terminating in the expected location of the right ventricle.
There is a large right pleural effusion with probable
atelectasis in the right middle and lower lobes. Cannot exclude
underlying infection. There is a rounded density projecting over
the left lower lung, which could represent a prominent nipple
shadow. The left lung is otherwise grossly unremarkable. The
heart appears enlarged, though this is difficult to quantitate
given the study limitations and the lack of prior studies. The
aorta appears extensively calcified and unfolded. No
pneumothorax is seen. Bones are demineralized with a marked
dextroscoliosis of the spine with the scoliotic apex at the
thoracolumbar junction.
IMPRESSION: Large right pleural effusion with probable collapse
of the right middle and lower lobes, though infection in the
right lower lung cannot be entirely excluded. Probable nipple
shadow accounting for rounded density projecting over the left
lower lung. Cardiomegaly. Followup to resolution is advised.
.
Echo:
The left atrium is normal in size. The left ventricular cavity
is unusually small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right
ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with moderate global free
wall hypokinesis. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function
is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid
regurgitation.] The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened
(?#). There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with
minimal aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
severe mitral annular calcification. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
.
Pleural fluid cytology: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS; CONSISTENT
WITH ADENOCARCINOMA
.
CXR: FINDINGS: Right pleural effusion has decreased in size
following
thoracentesis, with residual moderate effusion remaining. No
visible
pneumothorax, but extreme right lung apex is partially obscured
by the flexed position of the patient's chin and neck.
Asymmetrical airspace process within the right mid and lower
lung could potentially represent reexpansion pulmonary edema in
the setting of recent thoracentesis. Infectious process is also
a consideration in the appropriate clinical setting. On the
left, a small pleural effusion is unchanged, but retrocardiac
atelectasis has worsened.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo F with dCHF p/w worsening SOB and LE over last 3 weeks
with increasing O2 requirements whose hospital course included
aggressive diuresis with lasix gtt, pacemaker exchange, and
transfer to the CCU for increasing respiratory distress.
.
# Hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure: After pacemaker
exchange, the patient required noninvasive positive pressure
ventilation to oxygenate properly with hypercarbia to the 90s.
She did not require intubation and was able to be weaned to a
Venti mask and eventually to high-flow O2 through a nasal
canula.  Her respiratory issues were multi-factorial: (1) large
plerual effusion, with a thoracentesis that showed malignant
cells consistent with adenocarcinoma and minimal symptomatic
relief.  (2) Severe pulmonary hypertension with markedly reduced
right ventricular function.  (3) Likely intrinsic lung disease.
Initial echocardiogram findings were suspicious for a PE given
the level of RV failure, but this was felt to be a progression
of her pulmonary hypertension.  A family meeting was held with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and it was determined to make her CMO, given
that she would never achieve the level of independence that she
was accusto
