   RADIOLOGY   Preliminary Report

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2142-9-28**] 4:59 PM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: ET tube placement, pulmonary edema, infilatrate.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
78 year old woman intubated for CHF after cardiac cath.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
ET tube placement, pulmonary edema, infilatrate.
HISTORY: ET tube placement, CHF.

AP CHEST: There are no studies for comparison. There are
bilateral pleural effusions. There is prominenc of the pulmonary
vasculature consistent with pulmonary edema. Median sternotomy
wires appear intact. The ET tube is in satisfactory position
approximately 1.5 cm above the carina. Portable technique limits
evaluation of the cardiac size. No pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: Satisfactory ET tube placement. CHF.

  ECG:
Atrial fibrillation
Abnormal extreme QRS axis deviation - due to extensive
myocardial infarctions
Right bundle branch block
Old inferior infarct
Anterolateral infarct - age undetermined
Generalized low QRS voltages
No previous tracing

CATH:
COMMENTS:
  1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant circulation
revealed
single vessel CAD. The LMCA had mild diffuse disease. The LAD
had no
flow-limiting lesions. The LCX had a 90% mid vessel stenosis.
The RCA
was not selectively engaged.
  2. Resting hemodynamics showed central aortic hypertension.
  3. Successful stenting of the LCX with a 3.5 mm Cypher
drug-eluting
stent. Final angiography showed no residual stenosis, no
dissection and
normal flow (see PTCA comments).

ECHO:
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion
abnormality
cannot be fully excluded.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate
mitral annular
calcification. Moderate thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Calcified tips of
papillary muscles. Mild to moderate ([**12-15**]+) MR. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the
severity of MR may be significantly UNDERestimated.]

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild to moderate [[**12-15**]+] TR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Resting tachycardia (HR>100bpm). The rhythm
appears to be
atrial fibrillation. Emergency study performed by the cardiology
fellow on
call. Ascites.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity
size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
mitral valve
leaflets and supporting structures are thickened. At least
mild-moderate
([**12-15**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing,
the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
There is no
pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Respiratoty:  The patient had a Cypher stent placed without
incident but then developed increased SOB after the case and was
intubated for an ABG of 7.14/89/89.  This was caused by the
increased volume given during thr procedure and diastolic
dysfunction. She then had hypotension at the time and improved
on dopamine which was quickly weaned. During the intubation, the
patient also had bleeding from the posterior nasopharynx [**1-15**] to
NGT placement attempt. The patient's integrillin was stopped
when the bleeding started. ENT was consulted and applied Afrin
spray which ceased the bleeding.  The patietn was being weaned
however on [**9-30**] she self-extubated.  After she was transferred
to the floor, she had a slight O2 requirement that decreased
with gentle diuresis.

2. CAD: The patient recieved a Cypher stent to the left Cx
artery with 0% residual stenosis. She should continue ASA,
Plavix, Atenolol and Lisonopril.  Ultrasound of her right groin
showed AV fistula. She will follow-up with vascular surgery as
an outpatient. She will be refered to a vascular surgeon
associated with [**Hospital1 **] by her PCP.

3. Pump: The patient has preserved systolic function with
diastolic failure possibly due to hemochromotosis or HTN. The
patient developed flash pulmonary edema as described above. She
was gently diuresed and her respiratoy status improved.

4. Rhythm:  The patient was in atrial fibriollation and was
restarted on anticoagulation for stroke ppx. Her goal INR is 2.5
- 30. given her AVR.

5. Bleeding: The patient had a bleeding epidose in the setting
of intergrillin after the cath which was described above. Then
on [**10-1**], she had an abrubt HCT drop from 31 to 26. She had
melana and a GI consult was obtained. The patient had an
extensive workup inculding a bleeding scan which did not reveal
a cause for her mutiple episodes of melana. Heparin and coumadin
was held for several days and the patient ceased bleeding.
Coumadin was gently restarted. She can be followed by her
gastroenterologist as an outpatient.

6. AVR: The patient has an AVR therefore anticoagulation is
crutial with a goal of 2.5 - 3.0.
