Allergies:
Lisinopril / Ace Inhibitors

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1042**]
Chief Complaint:
Angioedema.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Already intubated upon transfer.
Mechanical Ventilation.

History of Present Illness:
79 y.o. F with DM, HTN, and hypercholesterolemia, 2 prior
episodes of angioedema without known etiology, transferred from
OSH for management of 3rd episode of angioedema.  History was
obtained from RN signout as well as her friend/caretaker.  [**Name (NI) **]
friend, the patient was in her USOH and was eating a salad and a
peice of ham yesterday when she called her friend and told him
that her tongue was becomoing swollen.  He went to her house and
took her to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] ER.   She has had two prior episodes
of angioedema per her friend, which occurred while visiting
[**Country 3399**] in [**2111-9-24**] - [**2111-11-24**] when her tongue became
very swollen.  She attributed it to some BBQ sauce that she ate
abroad.  There is some vague report of tracheostomy that
occurred in [**Country 3399**], but cannot be corroborated with the patient.

At the OSH ER, her VS: 146/66  67  12  100% O2 (unknown if RA vs
supplemental).  Insulin gtt was started at OSH for blood sugar
of 300.  There, she received IV Benadryl 50 mg x 4, IV
Solumedrol 120 mg x 4, epinephrine 1:1000 SQ x 2, and IV Zantac
50 mg x 2.  She was also given 4 mg Versed and 3 mg morphine.
The patient was initially taken to OSH OR for tracheostomy, but
instead, the decision was made to intubate her fiberoptically.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] via [**Location (un) 7622**].

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED: VS 96.4  101/47  16  100% on vent.  She was
sedated with Fentanyl and remained on ventilator without any
problems (FiO2 60, Vt 400, PEEP 5, BPM 12).  Insulin gtt stopped
at [**Hospital1 18**].

MICROBIOLOGY:
=============

STUDIES:
========
CXR [**2112-2-11**]:
IMPRESSION:
1)  Low-lying ET tube which should be partially withdrawn,
several cm.
2)  NG tube may be kinked at the gastric fundus.
3)  Diffusely prominent interstitial markings, nonspecific;
however, this may relate to the given history of "angioedema."
There is bibasilar atelectasis.

OSH [**2112-2-11**] NECK PLAIN FILMS:
IMPRESSION: Subtle soft tissue features involving the adenoids,
soft palate, and right floor of the mouth region.  Findings may
represent infectious, inflammatory, or possibly neoplastic
process.  Clinical correlation is needed.

OSH [**2110-10-29**] ECHO: EF 59%

-----
CT-CHEST [**2112-2-12**]:
The superior vena cava and other mediastinal veins are widely
patent.  Lower
in the chest, to the right of the esophagus is a sort tissue
abnormality,
either pleural thickening, a chain of borderline enlarged nodes
or a
redundant, patulous esophagus. There is no other mediastinal or
hilar
lymphadenopathy. Emphysema and interstitial edema are mild.
Subsegmental
atelectasis in both upper and lower lobes is moderately severe.

Cardiomegaly and atherosclerotic calcification in the coronary
arteries and
aorta are mild. Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes are in
standard placements.
The thyroid gland is enlarged by many subcentimeter nodules.

A 4 x 3.3 x 3 cm heterogeneously enhancing mass in the left
adrenal gland has
central necrosis and dystrophic calcification. The wall of a
small gallbladder
is thickened and hyperemic with two punctate calcifications.
There are no bone
lesions suspicious for malignancy. Degenerative changes are
present in the
thoracic spine.

IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of central venous obstruction. Mild pulmonary
edema.
2.  4-cm left adrenal mass, possible neuroendocrine tumor or
adrenal cortical
carcinoma.
3.  Inflamed gallbladder wall, possible adenomyosis.  No
intraluminal stones
4.  Multiple small thyroid nodules.

-----
CT-NECK ([**2112-2-12**]):
FINDINGS:  There is diffuse infiltration of the subcutaneous
tissues.  There
is no evidence for abscess.  There is a small focus of soft
tissue swelling of
the lower lip with potentially small skin defect.  The tongue is
prominent,
but there is no focal mass or fluid collection.  The patient is
intubated and
there is an NG tube.  There is mild mucosal thickening in the
maxillary
sinuses.  The mastoid air cells are clear.  The patient is
status post
cataract surgery.

The lung apices demonstrate a prominent interstitial with
underlying
emphysema. There are multiple small thyroid nodules measuring up
to 10 mm.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Soft tissue edema throughout the neck without focal abscess.

2.  Multiple thyroid nodules measuring up to 10 mm.
3.  Focal soft tissue swelling of the lower lip.  A skin defect
and
phlegmon/abscess cannot be excluded.

Brief Hospital Course:
79 y.o. F with DM, HTN, and hypercholesterolemia, 2 prior
episodes of angioedema without known etiology, transferred from
OSH for management of 3rd episode of possible angioedema.
.
# Neck swelling: The patient was intubated at an OSH for airway
swelling.  Unclear etiology after 3 episodes, but would consider
allergic reaction, hypereosinophilic syndrome (although no
eosinophilia on admit labs), C1 esterase deficiency (although
occurs mostly in adolescents, but can occur later in adulthood),
ACE-I use (in which angioedema occurs mostly wi
