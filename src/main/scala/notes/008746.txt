IMAGING:
Head CT [**12-17**]:
Interval increase of right acute SDH from 7mm to 9mm in maximal
diameter. There is again layering of acute blood over the
tentorium and falx. Minimal midline shift. Mild effacement of
the sulci on the affected side.

Plain Images of Right Shoulder [**12-17**]:
Negative for acute fracture per Trauma evaluator.

C-Spine CT [**12-17**]:
Degenerative changes of C3-4 C4-5 with stenosis. Ossified
fracture of spinous process of T7, per Trauma evaluator.

Head CT [**12-18**]:
The right parafalcine, supratentorial-suboccipital subdural and
frontal subdural hematoma appears unchanged in thickness and
distribution. Small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the
superior aspect of bifrontal lobes is unchanged. Small
intraventricular hemorrhage in the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] is
unchanged. No new focus of hemorrhage is detected. No
hydrocephalus is noted.No fracture is identified. Mild mucosal
thickening of ethmoid sinuses is unchanged. The patient is
status post placement of globe implant on the left side.
IMPRESSION: Unchanged thickness and distribution of subdural
hematomas and
small subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage, as
described.

Head CT [**12-19**]:
IMPRESSION: No significant change from prior study.

Brief Hospital Course:
81 yo spanish-soeaking gentleman w/ a h/o of HTN, CVA with a
subdural hematoma after slipping on ice.
.
# Subdural Hematoma: Patient was on plavix at the time of
admission for prior embolic CVA. He was admitted to the trauma
service after a mechanical fall slipping into the ICE and
hitting his head, passing out immediately. Patient had a head CT
scan that showed a right-sided subdural hemorrhage with 3 mm of
subfalcine herniation. Plavix was stopped and patient was
monitored with serial CT scans, initially every 5 hours.
Subdural hematoma was stable and neurologic exam was unchanged.
Neurosurgery signed off and transfered patient to medicine. The
only complication observed so far has been hyponatremia due to
associated SIADH (and thiazide). Patient's neurologic status
kept improving and patient was discharged to rehab. He will need
a CT scan in 2 weeks and follow up with neurosurgery.
.
# Hyponatremia: Patient had hyponatremia with nadir of 122 on
[**12-21**] with euvolemia, serum osmolarity was not checked
originaly, but sodium was measured using a direct assay. Urine
osmolarity was 549 and urine sodium of 97. During this time
patient was on HCTZ for blood pressure control and was stopped.
SIADH was diagnosed, patient was fluid restricted and given
normotonic fluids at 30 cc/hr with salt tablets. Upon transfer
to medicine on [**12-26**] fluids were stopped and fluid restriction
was continued. Sodium trended up slowly and was 132 upon
discharge.
.
#. Fever: Patient developed fever late in the course if his
hospitalization with wrosening of his baseline cough. His blood
and urine cultures were negative and his CXR was unchanged with
small L pleural effusion and bibasilary mild consolidations
(old) compatible with atelectases or PNA. Pt was started on
azithromycin 500 mg IV (3 doses) and ceftriaxone and was
switched to cefpodoxime 36 hours prior to discharge. He was
afebrile and improving clinically and WBC trending down 19from
to 6.0 upon discharge. Please continue cefpodoxime and check
temperature.
.
# Somnolence: neurology service was consulted by the
neurosurgical service for worsening somnolence, thought to be of
toxic metabolic etiology. Sodium was 122, tox screen and
negative work up were negative. CT scan showed [**Last Name (un) 2677**] SDH. PT
had normal LFTs, low-grade temp up to 100.8 and negative CXR.
HCTZ was stopped, BP was controlled with captopril, salt tablets
were given and pt was fluid restricted and improved. Now at
baseline per family.
.
# Hypoxia: RA sat at rest 92%, but desated at night (RA).
Patient was put in BiPAP and later in his home-settings CPAP and
symptoms resolved. He had bibasilar rales and atelectases on
CXR. Improved with incentive spirometry as well. No evidence of
PNA, shunt or PE since pt improved.
.
# Hyperglycemia: mild but no h/o DM. A1C was 6.3%. Pt was
maintained on ISS while in the hospital. Will need PCP follow up
and possibly outpatient treatment. Would recommend starting
metfromin.
.
# HTN: Outpatient regimen was with coreg 25 mg Daily. Patient
required labetalol drip and hydral IV for pressure control while
in the ICU. Upon transfer to the medical floor patient was on
carvedilol 37.5mg po daily, captopril 25mg po tid, hydralazine
75mg po q6hrs PRN. His coreg was switched to 25 mg PO BID,
captopril was increased to 50 TID and his BP was controlled.
.
# OSA: CPAP at night on his home-settings.
.
# PPX: dvt ppx w/ sc heparin tid, s+s evaluation, PT/OT consult,
will require rehab plcmt prior to returning home.  Continue H2
blocker.
