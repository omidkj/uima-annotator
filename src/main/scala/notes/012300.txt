History of Present Illness:
This is an 89 year old male with a medical history significant
for heavy alcohol use, mild dementia, frequent falls,
a-fib/flutter, bradycardia s/p PPM, who had new onset of LGIB on
am of admit.  Patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 **] for PPM
placement.  PPM placement was complicated by multiple blood
cultures that were positive for coag negataive staph (first set
of Bl Cx returned positive on day of PPM placement and had been
drawn the day prior).  A TEE could not be done given concern for
general anesthesia (which would have been needed given lack of
pt cooperation).  He was thus placed on nafcillin for a planned
course of 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks of PO levoflox and
rifampin.

having a worsening cellulitis around an old PICC site.  At that
time he was also noted to have increase stool and a concern for
a GU candidial infection.  Nafcillin was transitioned to Vanc
per ID for RUE cellulitis which would also cover S. hominis.  He
was also started on cefepime at that time for presumed HAP. RLL
infiltrate also seen on CXR.  C. diff, blood and urine Cx were
recommended.

In the ED, initial vs were: 97.5 70 139/60 18 100 RA. Per the NH
report he lost about a pint of blood and then continued having
blood loss throughout the day.  Patient had lots of blood and
clots in diaper on ED.  Patient was given Pantoprazole 80mg and
started on a PPI drip, started on an octreotide drip.  On
transfer he was afebrile, 69, 108/43, 13, 99% RA.  Never
hemodynamically unstable.  Per the surgery resident, while he
was interviewing the patient he passed [**3-5**] cups of blood in the
ED.

Access 2 PIV (prob 18 G) and a midline.

On the floor, he is without complaints.  He did have a cough in
the interview which he reported was new over the past hour.  He
did not report any chest pain, shortness of breath, headache,
double vision.  No N/V/C/D.  He reports that the BRBPR started
1-2 days ago although he admits he is not sure why he is here.
He reports he never had BRBPR in the past.  Per pt he has never
had hematemasis.

Bleeding Scan:

INTERPRETATION: Following intravenous injection of autologous
red blood cells labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic
images of the abdomen for minutes were obtained. A left lateral
view of the pelvis was also obtained. Blood flow images show
normal aorta and iliac vessel opacification. Dynamic blood pool
images show pooling of tracer in the recto/sigmoid region.
Bleeding was noticed during the first five minutes of the
examination.

IMPRESSION:
Positive GI bleeding study with tracer in the recto-sigmoid
region.


Brief Hospital Course:
MICU Course:
89 year old male with multiple medical problems including
[**Name (NI) 58845**] with variable conductance recently s/p PPM and S.
hominis bacteremia on Vanc/Cefepime for HAP at rehab, who
presented with BRBPR x1 day.

# Acute Lower GI Bleed:  Admitted with BRBPR and hct drop to 24
to the ICU.Required a total of 4 units of RBC with
stabiliazation of hct to 29. Bleed seen on tagged red cell scan,
but too low in the mesenteric vasculature to be emobolized per
IR consulation. Surgery was consulted who felt surgical
intervention not warrented as patient remained hemodynamically
stable. GI was consulted and recommended colonoscopy for
possible intervention of likely diverticular bleed but [**Hospital 228**]
health care proxy and family declined given patient's age, mold
dementia and clinical stability. They stated they would
reconsider if patient bled again.  GI continued to follow
patient on the floor.

# S. Hominis Bacteremia: Unclear source.  Multiple blood Cx with
S. hominis.  First blood Cx that turned positive were from day
before PPM placed.  Patient had a TTE that was a poor study and
TEE was unable to be performed.  He had a dental work up that
ultimately was felt not to be the source of his infection.
Initially on Nafcillin though was broadened to Vanc/Cefepime for
HCAP at rehab which was continued when transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  He
completed treatment on [**8-7**] and was transitioned back to
Nafcillin from [**Date range (1) 23465**] and then started on oral regimen of
levofloxacin/rifampin per prior ID plan at last hospitalization
through [**2155-8-24**].

# Hospital Acquired PNA: Patient was being treated for HAP
diagnosed at Rehab with Vanc and Cefepime and completed
treatment on [**2155-8-7**]. Per report patient had fever and RLL
infiltrate on CXR.  He remained afebrile while in-house

# A-flutter s/p PPM: PPM placed for intermittent bradycardia.
Site was oozing on admission and EP was consulted, who felt that
the area was not infected. On atenolol 50mg daily.
Anticoagulation with ASA 325 given frequent falls.

# Dementia: Remained stable.

# Hyponatremia: Labs c/w SIADH, improved with 1500cc fluid
restriction.

# Code: DNR/DNI

# Communication: Patient and family: [**Doctor Last Name **] ?????? c[**Telephone/Fax (1) 58846**] ;

# Sepsis
During a nightfloat call for atrial fibrillation.flutter, it was
discovered that patient had overnight fever to 102.2 and white
count subsequently began to climb.CXR the night of fever
suggests bilateral effusions and bibasilar consolidations. Scans
of chest, abdomen, pelvis showed no obvious locus of infection.
Blood culture, urine culture, C. diff. ordered. C. diff, was
highly suspected organism, given previous coverage with
vanc/cefepime and nafcillin, along with negative CT scans
(although done without contrast). ID followin
