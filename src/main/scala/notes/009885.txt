CT C-spine [**2175-9-10**]

FINDINGS: The vertebral body heights and disc spaces are well
preserved and
well aligned. No paravertebral soft tissue swelling is noted.
The contour of
thecal sac is intact. Please note that CT does not provide
intrathecal
details comparable to MRI. Emphysema is noted in the lung
apices. Acute
fractures are noted involving the left first and second
posterior ribs. These
are only minimally displaced.

IMPRESSION:
1. No cervical spine fracture or malalignment.
2. Acute left first and second rib fractures.

CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis [**2175-9-10**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Acute fractures involving L1 and L2 vertebra with superior
endplate
compression and associated retropulsion resulting in at least
mild central
canal stenosis. Correlation with MRI is advised. Associated
transverse
process fractures at L1.

2. Acute fractures involving the anterior column of the right
acetabulum and
right inferior pubic ramus. No significant surrounding hematoma.


3. Tiny left pneumothorax likely from a ruptured bleb in this
patient with
extensive paraseptal emphysema.

CT T & L spine [**2175-9-12**]
IMPRESSION:

1. Fractures of T11 through L3, as described above. Thoracic
spine MRI with
STIR images may be helpful to exclude additional subtle
vertebral body
compression fractures.

2. Fractures of the left first and second ribs.

3. Atelectasis versus contusions in the dependent portions of
the lungs.
Small pleural effusions.

4. Probable sludge in the gallbladder.

5. Left adrenal nodule with non-specific density
characteristics.
Statistically, these most commonly represent adenomas. If the
patient has a
known primary malignancy, then further characterization may be
performed by
MRI, or by multiphasic adrenal CT. Fullness in the lateral limb
of the right
adrenal gland may also be evaluated at the same time, if
indicated.







Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Trauma Service. Neurosurgery and
Orthopedics were consulted because of his injuries. His spine
fractures were managed non operatively; he was fitted for a TLSO
brace which needs to be worn when out of bed at all times.

He was taken to the operating room for repair of his wrist
fracture, an external fixator was placed at that time.
Postoperatively there was some concern for cellulitis around his
pin sites; the site was assessed by orthopedics who felt no
obvious cellulitis. If once at rehab the exam changes
Orthopedics is recommending 10 day course of Keflex.

There was an incidental finding on CT imaging of the
chest/abdomen which revealed bilateral adrenal nodules, which
were incompletely characterized. These
statistically represent adenomas and further evaluation with CT
or MRI may
be obtained on a non-emergent basis. He will need to follow up
with his PCP after discharge from rehab.

He was evaluated by Physcial and Occupational therapy and is
being recommended for rehab after his acute hospital stay.
