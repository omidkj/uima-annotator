                            **FINAL REPORT [**2157-8-22**]**

   HELICOBACTER PYLORI ANTIBODY TEST (Final [**2157-8-22**]):
      POSITIVE BY EIA.
           (Reference Range-Negative).


Brief Hospital Course:
86 Y/O Somali lady w/ h/o gastritis & PE/DVT on Coumadin & h/o
iron deficiency, presented to ED with n/v (hematemesis)
epigastric abd pain, and melena for 3 weeks. Pt taking Advil for
chronic pain. HCT 18.5 & INR 11.8  transfused a total of 5 units
RBC??????s and 6 units FFP.

1) Upper GI Bleed/Acute Blood Loss Anemia: likely underlying
gastritis from NSAID use exacerbated by supratherapeutic INR.
Also with old imaging suggesting stable ? penetrating
atheromatous ulcer of aorta superior to [**Female First Name (un) 899**]. Got vitamin K in
ED.
access was established with 20g IV x 2, protonix ggt started, 1U
PRBC with 6 more crossmatched on hold, and q4h hct/INR/iCa.  GI
consulted and agreed to EGD.  Surgery made aware because of
changing HCT and recent bleeding.  EGD revealed
esophagitis/gastritis no active bleeding or ulcers.  Recommended
changing Protonix from ggt to [**Hospital1 **] dosing, stop all nsaids, and
test for H pylori.  Was transferred to the floor where she had
one further melanotic stool but then had no further bleeding.
Her final H. Pylori test was positive.  This was communicated to
her pcp [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 2450**].

2) Abdominal Pain: Patient had epigastric and LLQ pain.  She had
a KUB which showed no free air, and underwent a colonoscopy
which showed diverticula but no evidence of ischemic bowel or
bleeding sight.

3) hx PE/DVT: no PE on recent imaging [**6-4**].  Coumadin held for
bleed.  No heparin given.  Ordered LE U/S to look for DVT, which
were negative.  Just prior to discharge, the patient was
restarted on coumadin to follow up with coumadin clinic.

4) Chronic diastolic CHF: Pt had dyspnea with ambulation, with
sats dropping to 80.  After her bleeding was resolved, her home
lasix dose of 60mg daily was restarted.  She was also given
several doses of IV lasix, which improved her symptoms.  On
discharge she was saturating 95% on RA while resting.  Her
metoprolol was stopped initially but, restarted at a lower dose
of 25mg toprol xl daily.
.
5) HTN: see above on beta blocker.
.
6) Fall: Patient fell on night prior to discharge, hitting her
left wrist and right knee.  It was a witnessed, mechanical fall.
 NO syncope or head trauma.  PT/OT was consulted, who saw her
and prescribed her a walker.  She was also prescribed a left
cock-up wrist splint.  Knee and wrist films were negative for
fracture.
