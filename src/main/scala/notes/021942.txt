History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 24529**] is a 68 year-old male with recently diagnosed locally
advanced esophageal adenocarcinoma receiving neoadjuvant
chemoradiotherapy s/p 5-FU/cisplatin cycle #1 on [**2131-10-8**], also
with a history of DM type 2, HTN and COPD, who is being
transferred from the floor for further management of
hypotension.
*
He initially presented to [**Hospital3 417**] hospital on [**2131-10-15**]
with a [**3-2**] day history of diffuse cramping abdominal pain,
associated with N/V. There, he was reportedly afebrile, and labs
were remarkable for WBC 3.9, Hct 37.8, Na 134, K 3.7, Cl 98,
HCO3 28, BUN 27, Creat 1.6, AST 21, ALT 22, ALP 76, Amylase 118
(peak 139 on [**10-16**]), lipase normal, TG 91. An AXR showed no
pathology, a RUQ U/S was remarkable for a mildly dilated CBD
10.3 mm without other abnormalities, and a CT revealed no
obvious explanation for his abdominal symptoms. He was made NPO,
hydrated, and eventually transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2131-10-17**] for
consideration of MRCP.
*
While on the floor, he developed a fever to 101.9, and was
placed on Unasyn for coverage of ? pancreaticobiliary process.
His abdominal pain persisted. Around 0030 on [**10-18**], his blood
pressure was noted to be 66/35 with HR 135 (down from 113/65, HR
126 earlier in night). No foley in place. He was given IV NS
bolus 1 liter, and [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] team was called for further evaluation.

*
In ICU, pt was initially treated with IVF and mild pressors for
hypotension.  Pressors were weaned on [**10-19**] in AM.  [**Name (NI) 24895**]
pt was evaluated for persistent fevers, neutropenia and
abdominal pain.  Pt thought to have both entercolitis as
complication of 5FU and also ileus (increased output from
G-tube).  The patient was kept on vancomycin and cefepime given
that he was severely neutropenic with potential GI infection.
Pt was also evaluated by both surgery and GI who do not
recommend intervention at this time, but to continue Abx and
NPO. Rad onc evaluated pt and may continue XRT monday.
Additionally pt was followed by oncology who recommend checking
dihydropyramadine level.
.
Pt currently has no complaints.  He has no pain, no nausea or
vomiting.  He has no pain, headache, shortness of breath, chest
pain, dizziness.   He does have mouth sores that have been
bothering him since the intial chemotherapy.
