History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 17926**] is a 52 F transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital3 **]
where she presented on [**11-8**] with diarrhea, brown emesis, and
back pain. The patient presented from rehab where she had
recetly been discharged to after a hospitalization for PNA and
had been on azithromycin.  KUB of the abdomen was negative for
any acute pathology. Stools were initially "trace" guiac
positive, but were guaic negative prior to transfer. Stool
culture was negative. Pt refused colonoscopy or other invasive
GI workup. Diarrhea resolved a few days into the admission.
Coumadin was initall held but re-started. Sputum cultures werte
also negative. The patient had been having poor "respiratory
status" since her previous admission, so she underwent
bronchoscopy [**2102-11-13**], which showed "near complete occlusion
bilaterally of the right main bronchus and left main bronchus
with occulsions."  Cultures from the bronch grew only [**Female First Name (un) 564**],
for which she recieved a 3 days course of fluconazole. At that
point, she was transferred to the ICU so a percussion bed could
be used for intensive chest PT. She was treated with nebs and
Mucinex. Case management was working on getting the patient a
SmartVest to help improve airway clearance. However, the patient
continued to desaturate and have worsening hypercarbia. A rapid
response was called on [**11-15**] for staff concern and was found to
be saturating 87% on 2L NC, and CXR done at the time showed
worsening PNA. There was concern for aspiration and that pt
unable to clear secretions.
Labs at [**Hospital1 **] were notable for albumin 2.3 and total protein
4.2. Bicarb ranged from 27-41 during the hospital course, and
was mainly in the high 30s. WBC count peaked at 25.6 in [**11-8**] and
was 12.1 on the day prior to transfer. Hct ranged from 42.2 on
admission to 29.1 It was mainly around 33, and was 31.1 on the
day prior to transfer. INR was therapeutic at 2.34 at the time
of transfer. CXR showed cardiomegaly, mild pleural effusions
attributed to CHF, and bibasilar patchy infiltrates R>L. Blood
Cx were without growth.
Vitals at the time of trasfer to [**Hospital1 18**] were T 98.3, BP 130/70,
HR 99, RR 22. She was reported as being in AFib with occassional
PVCs.
Upon arrival to the [**Name (NI) 153**], pt endorsed feeling SOB, which
improved with being placed on 100% face mask. ROS was also
positve for headache, sore throat, pleuritic chest pain,
intermittent fevers and chills, and B/L LE edema.

FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**11-27**], there is persistent
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with bibasilar
opacification most likely consistent with pneumonia and
pulmonary vascular congestion.

ECHO [**12-5**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is small. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
depressed free wall contractility. There is abnormal septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload with reverse Bernheim effect. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). The mitral
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
borderline/mild anterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse. A mitral
valve annuloplasty ring is present. The mitral annular ring
appears well seated with normal gradient. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe [4+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
