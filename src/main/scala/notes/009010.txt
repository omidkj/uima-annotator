HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 63 year old male
with a past medical history significant for long standing
diabetes mellitus who is status post renal and pancreas
transplant in [**2190**].  The patient also had a myocardial
infarction in [**2190**] as well as a percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty and stent placement within a right
coronary artery in [**2195**].  A cardiac catheterization performed
at that time showed 50% left anterior descending lesion, 70%
obtuse marginal lesion and an ejection fraction of 51%.

Recently, however, the patient started to have some pressure
in his arms and chest when he ambulated up any type of
incline.  According to a report, the patient had a stress
echocardiogram performed in [**State 108**] which showed no change
from his previous findings.  He was, at that point, placed on
an increased dose of Lopressor.

Over the last few months, however, the patient reports
increasing frequency of chest pressure with activity.  The
patient denies any chest pain at rest.  He also denies
claudication, orthopnea, edema, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea
or lightheadedness.

Prior to admission, the patient had a cardiac catheterization
performed on [**2200-11-14**].  That cardiac catheterization
revealed three vessel coronary artery disease.  His left main
coronary artery had no angiographic evidence of stenosis.
The left anterior descending artery had a focal 90% stenosis
in the mid segment.  The circumflex system had luminal
irregularities with two 90% stenoses in the large first
obtuse marginal.  The right coronary artery had an 80% ostial
stenosis.  Ejection fraction was not assessed at that time.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  History of type 1 diabetes mellitus status post kidney
and pancreas transplant.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Diabetic retinopathy.
4.  Sleep apnea.
5.  Foot ulcer.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Renal and pancreas transplant in [**2190**] complicated by
postoperative wound dehiscence and pancreatic leak.
2.  Recent chest cyst removed.

1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Zantac 150 mg p.o. twice a day.

4.  Norvasc 5 mg q. day.
5.  Colace 100 mg p.o. q. day.
6.  Cyclosporin 200 mg p.o. q. a.m. and 150 mg p.o. q. p.m.

9.  Imuran 25 gm p.o. q. day.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   The patient is married.  There is no
history of tobacco or alcohol abuse.

LABORATORY:  On admission, hematocrit 36.8, white blood cell
count 4.4, platelets 187.  Glucose 69, BUN 36, creatinine
1.3, sodium 139, potassium 4.9.  Albumin 3.5.

EKG performed on [**2200-11-14**] showed sinus bradycardia with a
probable anteroseptal infarction with undetermined age, left
ventricular hypertrophy but no change since previous EKG.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   In general, alert and oriented middle
aged male in no apparent distress.  Vital signs are
temperature 98.2 F.; heart rate 76; blood pressure 139/69;
respiratory rate 18; 95% on room air.  HEENT examination
within normal limits.  Heart examination regular rate and
rhythm; no murmurs.  Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities warm and
well perfused; no evidence of edema.  Pulses present
bilaterally upper and lower extremity.  Neurologic
examination grossly intact.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:   Prior to admission, the patient
underwent a cardiac catheterization which demonstrated three
vessel coronary artery disease.  At that time, it was decided
that a surgical intervention would be the best approach.  The
patient was admitted to Cardiac Surgery.

On [**2200-11-21**], the patient underwent coronary artery bypass
graft times three; left internal mammary artery to left
anterior descending; saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal;
saphenous vein graft to patent ductus arteriosus.

The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no
complications.  Please see the full operative report for
detail.  The patient was then transferred to the Intensive
Care Unit in fair condition.  He remained intubated.

The patient remained in sinus rhythm with occasional unifocal
premature ventricular contractions.  His urine output was
adequate.  The patient was extubated on postoperative day
zero.  He tolerated the extubation well.  He showed good
oxygenation levels.

The Renal Service was consulted given the history of the
renal/pancreas transplant.  This service followed the patient
throughout his hospitalization.  The patient was continued on
his immunosuppressive regimen.  His hematocrit on
postoperative day one was 25.8.

He originally required some Neo-synephrine.  The patient
received perioperative Vancomycin.  His blood sugars were
noted to be slightly elevated and he was maintained on
insulin and titrated appropriately.  The patient was
tolerating the diet well.  The chest tube was removed on
postoperative day one.  His urine catheter was removed on
postoperative day two.  The patient received Lopressor.

Physical Therapy was consulted which followed the patient
throughout his hospitalization.  The patient was eventually
cleared by Physical Therapy to go home.  His blood pressure
and heart rate remained stable.  He was maintained on Bactrim
prophylaxis as preoperatively.  His incision remained clean,
dry and intact.

The patient was transferred to the Floor on postoperative day
three in stable condition.  His hematocrit on postoperative
day four was 27 with creatinine of 1.6, which is basically
his baseline.  The patient remained afebrile.  He was
ambulating without assistance.  The patient was discharged to
home on [**2200-11-27**].
