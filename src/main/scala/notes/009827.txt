HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67-year-old
male with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and three-vessel
disease diagnosed by catheterization in [**2145-1-2**], who
also has poor pulmonary function, and was transferred here
for further evaluation of coronary artery disease and options
for intervention.

The patient reported that he has had severe chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease for several years and unstable
angina with exercise times five years.  He was also admitted
to [**Hospital6 22197**] Center for evaluation of his coronary
arteries.  Catheterization results are unknown at this time.
The patient was reported to have had three-vessel disease and
was told that this is inoperable due to his pulmonary status.
The patient and his primary care physician were unsatisfied
with this evaluation, and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further work-up.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Obesity.  2.  Obstructive sleep
apnea.  3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  4.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.  5.  Diabetes mellitus.  6.
Chronic lower extremity cellulitis.  7.  History of inferior
myocardial infarction.  8.  Status post catheterization with
three-vessel disease in [**2145-1-2**].

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN AND RELAFEN.

MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., Ativan 0.5 mg p.o.
p.r.n., Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d., Docusate 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
Flomax 0.4 mg p.o. q.d., Lasix 80 mg p.o. q.d., Metformin
1000 mg p.o. b.i.d., Glyburide 1 mg p.o. q.d., Isosorbide 60
mg p.o. q.d., Lovenox 50 mg subcue b.i.d., Diovan 180 mg p.o.
q.d., Metoprolol XL 50 mg p.o. q.d., sliding regular Insulin,
Pravachol 20 mg p.o. q.d., Prednisone 5 mg p.o. q.d.,
Albuterol metered dose inhaler, Atrovent metered dose
inhaler, Flovent metered dose inhaler.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 7.5, hematocrit 40, platelet
count 239; CHEM7 136, 4.5, 90, 42, 23, 1.1, 97.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Pulse 52, blood pressure
130/74, respirations 18, oxygen saturation 89% on 1 L nasal
cannula.  General:  He was an obese male in no acute
distress.  HEENT:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.
Neck:  Supple.  No jugular venous distention.  Chest:
Decreased breath sounds bilaterally.  Mild expiratory
wheezes.  Heart:  Distant heart sounds but regular.  Abdomen:
Obese.  Extremities:  There was 2+ edema in his bilateral
lower extremities.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2145-3-30**], and the hospital records were obtained from the outside
hospital.  The results of the cardiac catheterization did
show severe three-vessel disease.  Repeat cardiac
catheterization on [**2145-4-2**], at [**Hospital6 649**] did demonstrate three-vessel disease with left
main coronary artery diffuse disease up to 60%, left anterior
descending calcified and diffusely disease with 70-80%
lesions, and left circumflex with 80% ulcerate ostial lesion,
right coronary artery totally occluded.

Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted regarding surgical
intervention.  Pulmonary was called to see the patient to
optimize his pulmonary status for surgery.  The
recommendations from Pulmonary were to continue the Atrovent
and Albuterol inhalers and obtain PFTs.  Intraoperative
strategies that they suggested included keeping the duration
of the surgery to less than three hours and using a shorter
acting neuromuscular blockade.

On [**2145-4-6**], the patient underwent three-vessel coronary
artery bypass grafting with LIMA to the left anterior
descending, saphenous vein graft to posterior descending
artery, and saphenous vein graft to OM1.  The patient did
well postoperatively and was transferred to the CSRU.  The
patient received a transfusion of 2 U of packed red blood
cells on postoperative day #1 for a hematocrit of 23.  The
patient was started on subcue Heparin on postoperative day #1
due to his high risk for DVT.  The patient was out of bed to
chair on postoperative day #1 and was started on BIPAP at
night for sleep apnea.

On postoperative day #2, the patient experienced an episode
of atrial fibrillation.  He was started on Amiodarone drip.
On postoperative day #3, the patient's Neo-Synephrine was
weaned to off.  The patient was transferred to the floor on
the evening of postoperative day #3.  On postoperative day
#4, the patient's wires were removed as he was in sinus
rhythm.  The patient was continued on his subcue Heparin.
The patient's Lopressor was increased to 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.

On postoperative day #5, the patient experienced some wound
drainage.  The patient was started on Vancomycin 1 g IV q.12
hours for this drainage.  On postoperative day #6, the
patient's wound drainage slowed considerably, but the patient
was continued on the Vancomycin.


The patient was seen by Physical Therapy on postoperative day
#6, and evaluation was made that he would most likely be
discharged to home with services.  The patient reached a
level IV by postoperative day #6.

On postoperative day #7, the patient's sternal wound drainage
was quite minimal, and Vancomycin was discontinued.  The
patient was started on Keflex 500 mg p.o. q.i.d., and it was
decided that he could be discharged to home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Status post three-vessel coronary
artery bypass grafting on [**2145-4-6**].

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Good condition to home.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lasix 80 mg p.o. q.d., KCl 20 mEq
