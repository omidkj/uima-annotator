Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2751**]
Chief Complaint:
Epistaxis, nausea, hypotension


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 65 yo M with Hx of multiple CVAs, CAD with
stents (DES to RCA [**2164**], off plavix), HTN, pacemaker, Mechanical
Aortic valve who has had several recent admissions to [**Hospital1 18**] for
anemia (thought secondary to epistaxis and hematuria).  Most
recently admission was([**Date range (1) 80819**]), where he initially presented
with SOB, dizziness and Hct of 22, and guaiac pos stools.  He
was transfused, and did not bump appropriately to transfusions;
labs were suggestive of hemolysis although coombs and antibody
testing were normal.  His Hct stabilized and was 23.6 on
discharge; he was sent home with a plan to f/u with hematology
and undergo outpatient egd/[**Last Name (un) **].  Overnight, he experienced an
episode of copious epistaxis and returned to the ED today
complaining of HA, nausea and mild SOB.

In the ED, initial vs were: 98.8 86 93/48 18 100% on RA. BP
declined to 70s/40s and Hct was down approx 3 pts to 20.8 with
INR 3.1.  Rectal exam showed black, guaiac pos stool and nasal
examination showed slight oozing of the septum.  The patient was
given approximately 800 cc NS, protonix 80 mg IV, zofran IV, and
given 3 units prbcs.  During his transfusion, reportedly passed
a large amount of melena, and was cross-matched for another 4
units prbcs.  Vitals on transfer were: BP 86/50, HR 74, RR 25,
100% on RA.  He was admitted to the ICU for ongoing hypotension
in the setting of anemia.

On the floor, patient reports dizziness, nausea and abdominal
tenderness. Has some SOB, which he describes as chronic.  No
epistaxis today.

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI, also reports recent constipation the past week
(relieved with today's melena, as well as intermittent black
stools for the past several months.
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies
cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing. Denies chest pain,
chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness. Denies dysuria,
frequency, or urgency. Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies
rashes or skin changes.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Acute blood loss anemia: Multifactorial with (a) epistaxis;
(b) gastritis; (c) anticoagulation. A total of 8 units of pRBC
were transfused and aspirin/warfarin were held. No reversal of
anticoagulation was done given mechanical valve and prior
stroke. After EGD showed gastritis, pantoprazole dose was
increased. ENT follow-up was arranged to help manage epistaxis
which stopped spontaneously.

2. Hypotension: Per family and the patient, he has had
chronically low BPs for at least the past month. Likely
secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of acute bleed. SBP
remained in 90s after stabilization of bleeding. Given CHF/CAD,
Low dose beta blocker and daily morning lasix was resumed on
discharge since BP was at its baseline.

3. Epistaxis: Patient with multiple episodes of epistaxis in the
past several months. Last ENT evaluation showed evidence of
anterior bleeding. Afrin was given for 3 days was given as well
as nasal saline, humidified air and vaseline to nasal mucosa.
ENT follow-up was arranged.

4. Gastritis: Given guaiac positive stool, EGD was done and
showed gastritis. Pantoprazole dose was increased.

5. Mechanical AVR: Anticoagulated with goal INR 2.5-3.5. Managed
with a heparin gtt with warfarin resumed after stabilization of
HCT.  He was instructed to take 2mg Warfarin on discharge
([**2166-2-23**]), repeat level will be drawn by VNA on [**2166-2-24**] and [**Company 191**]
will be in touch with patient.  Pt's PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 21150**] (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was
paged and this issue discussed.
Date - INR value:Warfarin Dose
[**2166-2-19**] - 1.9:3mg
[**2166-2-20**] - 1.9:3mg
[**2166-2-21**] - 2.1:3mg
[**2166-2-22**] - 2.3:3mg
[**2166-2-23**] - 2.8:2mg

6. Congestive heart failure, diastolic, acute on chronic:
Initially dry to euvolemic but after administration of pRBC,
experienced orthopnea with CXR showing mild vascular congestion.
Improved with one day of IV furosemide diuresis. As above,
resumption of beta-blocker and lisinopril was initially limited
by SBP, though BP normalized to his baseline of low 90s.  Once
daily lasix and low dose betablockade was resumed.
