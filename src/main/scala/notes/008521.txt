Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 473**]
Chief Complaint:
Epigastric pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**10-28**]: ERCP
[**11-15**]: Percutaneous dilational tracheostomy with bronchoscopic
guidance


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 67 y.o. F with h/o breast cancer s/p
lumpectomy, gallstones who presents with epigastric pain and
nausea. + emesis and dry heaves. She presented to an OSH where
the abdominal CT scan demonstrated diffuse new inflammatory
changes surrounding the  head of the pancreas with fluid
tracking along the anterior pararenal fascia- c/w acute
pancreatitis. Study was limited [**3-12**] to absence of IVc contrast
thus +Gallstones in the GB but GB unremarkable. Pain is similar
to a presumed attack of biliary colic that she had 2 years ago
which resolved without medical intervention.
She was given zosyn 4.5 gm IV, protonix 40 mg IV, zofran 4 mg
IV, dilaudid 1 mg IV x 2 along with pepcid 20 mg IV x T,
benadryl 25 mg IV x T. She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
ERCP. In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED she was given dilaudid 1 mg IV x 1.

IMAGING:
[**10-28**] ERCP: Sludge and small stone fragments were extracted.
There is no evidence of biliary stricture or ductal dilatation.
Filling defects within the gallbladder consistent with
stones/sludge
[**10-29**] CT: Basilar atelectasis and pleural effusion bilaterally.
Moderate amount of fluid in peritoneal cavity, strandings in fat
surrounding the pancreas and other organs and adynamic ileus are
findings compatible with pancreatitis. No free air.
[**10-31**] CXR: left-sided pleural effusion, basilar atelectasis
[**11-2**] CXR: NG tube tip passes below the diaphragm, most likely
terminating in the stomach. No interval change bibasilar
atelectasis
[**11-4**] CTA prelim: Interval worsening of peripancreatic
inflammatory stranding without evidence yet of
pancreatitis-related complication. No definite focal fluid
collection observed. Anasarca with small left greater than right
pleural effusions. Cholelithiasis with biliary stent in place.
[**11-7**] CXR: Increasing left basilar atelectasis. Minimally
improving right basilar atelectasis.
[**11-13**] CXR: No interval change in ET tube is persistently low with
tip 1.7 cm above the carina. Bibasilar atelectasis with small
pleural bilateral effusions are unchanged.
[**11-14**] CXR: Endotracheal tube seen with tip approximately 3 cm
above the carina. Nasogastric tube coursing over the stomach,
tip incompletely imaged. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
unchanged. Persistent retrocardiac opacity and bilateral pleural
effusions, not significantly changed from prior, however, do
appear increasing since studies performed in [**2112-10-10**].

[**11-15**] - CXR post-trach: no pneumomediastinum or PTX. The lung
volumes are somewhat improved though there is persistent
obscuration of the hemidiaphragms consistent with effusion and
atelectasis.
[**11-15**] - CT abd w/ contrast: . Interval evolution of known
pancreatitis, with hypo-enhancement in the region of the
pancreatic head, and slight increase in parapancreatic fluid
collections which have become more loculated in appearance,
extending superior to the pancreas as well as inferior to the
pancreas, and extending inferiorly along Gerota's fascia and the
left paracolic gutter.
2. Biliary stent in place. 3. Interval slight decrease in
parahepatic free fluid and increase in pelvic free fluid. 4.
Interval increase in now small-to-moderate sized bilateral
pleural effusions, with related compressive atelectasis in the
visualized lung base
