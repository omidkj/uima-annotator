IMAGING:
CT/A of Head [**6-11**]:
FINDINGS: In the interval since the prior study, there has been
placement of a right ventriculostomy. The caliber of the
ventricles appears unchanged. Again seen is extensive
subarachnoid hemorrhage and intraventricular hemorrhage. There
has been re-distribution of intraventricular hemorrhage with a
larger amount now present in the right lateral ventricle. Again
seen is extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage, most prominent in the
left suprasellar cistern and middle cranial fossa. These leads
appear most related to the expected location of the posterior
communicating artery. They appear medial to the carotid
bifurcation. There is hydrocephalus, unchanged since the prior
study. Diffuse periventricular white matter hypodensity suggests
chronic small-vessel ischemia. There are calcifications of the
cavernous carotid arteries bilaterally. The CTA examination is
partially complete, but post processing has not been
performed. There is a 9 x 11 mm markedly irregular and
multilobulated
aneurysm arising from the left internal carotid artery at the
expected
location of the posterior communicating artery. The aneurysm's
size,
irregular configuration, and relationship to the distribution of
blood
suggests that this is the bleeding lesion. There is an 11 x 6 mm
lobulated aneurysm arising from the bifurcation of the left
middle cerebral artery. This points directly lateral. Although
the appearance of this aneurysm would be concerning for a
bleeding lesion, the distribution of blood does not center
around this location. There is a 4 mm aneurysm arising from the
anterior communicating artery, near its junction with the left
anterior cerebral artery. Again, the blood distribution does not
appear typical for an anterior communicating artery aneurysm.
However, there is interhemispheric hemorrhage. Limited views of
the posterior circulation demonstrate no definite aneurysm
formation. However, sensitivity is limited in the absence of the
volume-rendered images.
CONCLUSION: No evidence of new hemorrhage.
Status post right lateral ventriculostomy placement with
increased blood
within the body of the right lateral ventricle. Three left-sided
aneurysms located at the origin of the posterior communicating
artery, the left MCA bifurcation, and the junction of the left
ACA with the anterior communicating artery. A preliminary report
was generated that read "multiple intracranial aneurysms (?
related to hypertension, female sex versus systemic issues such
as fibromuscular disease, polycystic kidney disease)". 3 x 4 mm
small-neck aneurysm at junction of ACOM and A1 segments. 6 x 11
x 6 mm bilobed aneurysm at M1-M2 junction with 2-3 mm neck. 7 x
13 x 11 mm multilobulated supraclinoid left ICA aneurysm with a
2-3 mm neck. Basilar tip prominent but without frank aneurysm.
Right frontal ventriculostomy catheter in place with tip
abutting portion of parenchyma but slight decrease in size to
lateral ventricles. Appearance of diffuse subarachnoid
hemorrhage, left subdural hematoma, and intraventricular
hemorrhage is stable.

CT Head [**6-14**]:
FINDINGS: There are two aneurysm coils in the left hemisphere
which cause
extensive streak artifact limiting evaluation in this region.
Diffuse
subarachnoid hemorrhage, particularly notable in bilateral
sylvian fissures appears stable. A left temporal lobe
intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding hypodensity likely
edema, also appears stable in size, as does a SDH along the
medial border of the left temporal lobe. Hyperdense material
layers in bilateral occipital horns are present in the right
lateral ventricle. The volume of intraventricular hemorrhage
appears stable. No blood is seen in the third or fourth
ventricle. The size of the ventricles appears unchanged.
Position of a right transfrontal ventriculostomy catheter is in
unchanged position, with the tip in the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
There is trace hyperdense material surrounding the tract of the
ventriculostomy catheter (2:19), unchanged. Periventricular
white matter hypodensity is stable likely the sequelae of small
vessel microvascular infarction. There is no significant shift
of normally midline structures. A burr hole is present in the
right frontal skull. Otherwise, osseous structures appear
intact. Paranasal sinuses, ethmoid, and mastoid air cells are
well aerated. Soft tissue density material
is present in bilateral external auditory canals which may be
cerumen, but
would recommend clinical correlation. Calcifications are present
in lateral carotid siphons as well as the vertebral arteries.
IMPRESSION:
1. Stable appearance to diffuse subarachnoid, intraventricular,
left temporal lobe parenchymal and subdural hemorrhage, along
the medial border of the left temporal lobe. No new foci of
hemorrhage are identified.
2. Unchanged slight ventriculomegaly.

Final Report
CTA CRANIAL VESSELS, WITH CONTRAST.

CT HEAD: Compared to the most recent head CT from [**2130-6-14**],
there is no change in diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage, including
in bilateral sylvian fissures, as well as the subdural hematoma
along the medial border of the left temporal lobe, left temporal
lobe parenchymal hemorrhage and surrounding hypodensity, as well
as intraventricular extension. There is no hemorrhage seen in
the third or fourth ventricles, and the ventricular size and
configuration are stable. The position of the right transfrontal

ventriculostomy catheter is unchanged.

Extensive streak artifact in the region of left MCA and left
PCom aneurysm
severely limits evaluation of these regions. Persistent flow in
the coiled
aneurysms cannot be assessed.

There is no significant shift of normally midline structures.
Periventricular white matter hypodensity, unchanged, likely
represents sequelae of chronic small vessel infarction in a
patient of this age.

CTA: Again noted is a 3-mm aneurysm arising from the anterior
communicating artery. Extensive streak artifact limits
evaluation of vessels in the region of the coiled left MCA and
left PCom aneurysms; the presence of persistent flow into these
aneurysms cannot be assessed. However, the caliber of the major
vessels and their branches, in both the anterior and posterior
circulation appears reduced, diffusely and globally, compared to
most recent CTA of [**2130-6-11**], though the overall number of
distal branches appears similar to the prior study.

IMPRESSION:
1. Diminished caliber of the cerebral vessels, diffusely, in
both the
posterior and anterior circulation, concerning for diffuse
vasospasm.
N.B. Dedicated perfusion imaging was not requested.
2. Stable appearance to diffuse subarachnoid, intraventricular,
left temporal lobe parenchymal, and subdural hemorrhage. No new
foci of hemorrhage are identified.
3. Unchanged slight ventriculomegaly.
4. Persistent flow into the two recently-co
