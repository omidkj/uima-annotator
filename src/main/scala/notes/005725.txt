Pt was admitted [**2111-3-29**] for heparin gtt in preparation for the
OR.  Also administered vitamin K in pre-op time period.  Once
INR had normalized, she was taken to the OR on [**2111-4-4**] for AVR
and MAZE procedure.  For more detailed account, please see
operative report.  Post-operatively, she went to the CSRU where
she extubated on POD0, PA catheter was d/c'd on POD1, and
amiodarone was started.  Pacing wires and chest tubes were
removed on POD3 and she was transferred to the floor.  On the
floor, coumadin was administered.  On POD5, pt had slight rise
in creatinine; lasix was stopped and this was followed.  It
