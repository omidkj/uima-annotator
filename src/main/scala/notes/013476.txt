Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
83yo man with DM, HTN, MI with RCA stenting in [**2127**] and recent
STEMI 3 weeks ago with BMS stent complicated by cardiogenic
shock and VT/Vfib requiring defibrillation/pacing for heart
block. During that admission, cardiac angiography found him to
have completely occluded proximal LAD, 80% occlusion of the Lcx
and complete proximal occlusion of the RCA with distal flow from
collaterals. The LAD lesion was opened by angioplasty and a bare
metal stent was placed. During the procedure the patient became
hypotensive with episodes of V Tach and V fib requiring multiple
cardioversions, managed with amiodarone. He then experienced
chest pain at rest on [**2137-3-1**] which on repeat cath was shown to
be from LAD instent thrombosis, managed by PTCA. His Troponin
peaked at 23.5. ECHO at the beginning of the admission showed
cardiogenic shock with EF 20%, 3+ MR, and septal and
anterolateral ventricular akinesis. He required dopamine and
levophed, which was weaned after a few days. Metoprolol was
started and titrated. He was also fluid overloaded, managed by
lasix. He was discharged on amiodarone, coumadin, Toprol, lasix,
plavix, and aspirin.  He was d/c'd to [**Hospital1 **] of [**Location (un) 55**]

Today, he presents with SOB x a few days, mild dull SSCP.  No
diaphoresis, N/V.  Increased LE edema, PND, DOE.  In ED,
presenting vitals of 96.5, HR 71, BP 132/83  24, 98% on 8L.  EKG
with concern of Qs and ST elevations anteriorly.  Trop of 1 (way
down from before), CXR showed volume overload.  He was CP free
after nitroglycerine and morphine. He was given 80 lasix in the
ED and initially was to be sent to floor but became tachypneic,
agitated with hypoxia to 80s on NC, placed on BIPAP, with
improvement of sats to 100s.  Pt. 7.42/38/154 on 50% BIPAP.  In
ED, non-invasive BPs marginal, so pt. given 1.25L IVFs.  Art
line placed, which showed 40 pt. difference between NBP and art
line.  Nitro gtt initiated, additional 40mg lasix given with
total of 2L UO in ED.  Pt. remained on BIPAP for tachypnea on
transfer to ICU.

CXR:
There is stable moderate cardiomegaly. The aorta is calcified
and tortuous. There is pulmonary vascular congestion and
diffusely increased interstitial linear opacities. Bilateral
pleural effusions are identified.

IMPRESSION: Moderate CHF.

ECG:
Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Prior anteroseptal
myocardial
infarction. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2137-3-4**] right
bundle-branch block is no longer recorded. There is further
evolution of acute anterolateral myocardial infarction. Followup
and clinical correlation are suggested.

ECHO [**2137-3-18**]
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. There is an apical
left ventricular aneurysm with near akinesis of the distal half
of the ventricle (LVEF <20%). No masses or thrombi are seen in
the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with moderate global free
wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-26**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2137-2-21**],
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is now identified. The
severity of mitral regurgitation was slightly overestimated on
the prior study, but is slightly reduced today (may be related
to the lower systemic pressure).

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 83 yo male with CAD, DM, HTN, CRI, with recent MI
and EF of 20%, who presents with likely acute CHF exacerbation.
.
#. CAD: s/p complicated admission with 2 anterior MIs, second
from instent thrombosis, two cardiac catheterizations,
cardiogenic shock, vfib/vt, and fluid overload. Currently CP
free. His troponins are much decreased compared to discharge,
trending down, and CKs flat, likely [**1-26**] ARF.  Ruled out for ACS
by 3 sets of down trending cardiac biomarkers. EKG unchanged
from prior. No signs of new ischemia. The patient was changed to
carvedilol for better CHF management and continued on his [**Month/Day (2) **],
plavix, statin. He will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
#. Pump: The patients symptoms were likely from fluid overload
in setting of depressed cardiac function and depressed EF.  LVEF
20% by echo with 3+ and septal and anterolateral ventricular
akenesis.  Repeat echo showed LVEF <20% with global akinesis and
apical aneursym.  Acute on chronic CHF
