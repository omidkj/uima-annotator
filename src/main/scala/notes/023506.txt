Brief Hospital Course:
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was febrile w/ SBPs 70s; started on sepsis
protocol.  Pt was intubated and placed on neosynephrine.  CXR
showed LLL opacity, blood and urine cultures grew out
Enterobacter cloacae.  Pt was initially started on
vanco/levo/zosyn; switched to levofloxacin alone after
sensitivities were final.  Flagyl started for possible C. diff.


Patient since admission virtually anuric.  CT scan showed an
atrophic L kidney w/ multiple stones, nl R kidney.  Renal
ultrasound demonstrated no evidence of obstruction on R side.
Scant urine samples demonstrated packed WBCs despite appropriate
antibiotic coverage.  Urology consult did not believe it was
necessary to intervene on stones currently.  Renal consult
believed anuria/renal failure likely ATN vs renal artery
thrombosis.  Given persistence of anuria/oliguria and worsening
renal failure, impending longterm if not lifelong hemodialysis
likely.  Multiple discussions w/ family, prognosis described was
poor, with the likelihood of prolonged intubation/hemodialysis,
small likelihood of recovery.  The healthcare proxy believed
that patient would not wish to have such interventions and on
[**10-30**], pt was extubated and placed on CMO.  Patient expired on
[**2163-10-31**].
