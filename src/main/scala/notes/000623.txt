CTA [**2140-4-13**]: IMPRESSION: Penetrating ulceration and aneurysmal
dilatation of the descending thoracic aorta, with areas of
intramural hematoma in the thoracic aorta. The areas of
penetrating ulceration continue into the upper abdominal aorta,
with a 3.7 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm as described.

CXR [**2140-4-14**]: There is widening of the mediastinum, which has a
slightly ill- defined margin. While this may be positional,
there are no prior radiographs for comparison. Given that the
recent CT scan, performed yesterday demonstrated an aortic ulcer
with intramural hematoma and that there is a new left pleural
fluid collection, clinical correlation and followup CT scan are
recommended.

CXR [**2140-4-15**]: Left lower lobe pneumonia versus atelectasis.

CXR [**2140-4-16**]:
There is continued marked tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
Please refer to recent CT scan report.There is continued left
lower lobe consolidation most likely indicating atelectasis. The
possibility of pneumonia cannot be excluded. There is continued
small left pleural effusion. The lungs are clear otherwise. The
heart is normal in size. No pneumothorax is seen.

CXR [**2140-4-17**]: Mild congestive heart failure with cardiomegaly and
small bilateral pleural effusion.

ECHO [**2140-4-20**]: Mild symmetric left ventricular systolic function
with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic
function. Mild mitral regurgitation.

Based on [**2131**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate a low risk (prophylaxis not recommended).
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be
based on clinical and echocardiographic data.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Abdominal pain. This is a 77 F with history of HTN, AAA, and
CVA who presented with acute onset of abdominal pain on [**4-13**].
The patient was initially admitted to Vascular surgery service.
CT done at OSH was concerning for aortic dissection. Upon
further evaluation of images and comparison with [**2137**] studies,
it was found that descending aortic aneurysm was unchanged from
2 years ago and there was no dissection. On CT done at [**Hospital1 18**] AAA
size was measured 3.7 cm. Her abdominal pain resolved without
intervention soon after transfer. CT did show that she had
several large gallstones within the gallbladder. There was no
evidence of acute cholecystitis. Possible etiologies of her
abdominal pain included passing of a gallstone or gastritis
(later confirmed on EGD). LFT's were WNL on admission. The
patient was continued on PPI during this admission. She remained
asymptomatic and was tolerating po's well.

2. UTI. On [**4-14**], the patient developed T 102 with UCx positive
for E. coli >100,000 and Strep bovis in urine. She was started
empirically on a 3-day course of Bactrim.
She was then continued on a 7-day course of Levaquin per ID
because of better coverage of Strep bovis with Levaquin and also
because of CXR finding concerning of pneumonia. Would recommend
repeating UA and culture after she completes treatment course to
ensure resolution.

3. Atrial fibrillation, new diagnosis. [**4-16**] the patient was
found with new onset Afib with rapid ventricular response
130-150 with decrease in BP (SBP from 130 to mid 80s for 3
minutes). IV Lopressor was given without success and she was
loaded with IV amiodarone with subsequent return to NSR.
Cardiology were consulted. Cardiology consultants advised to
continue amiodarone po loading followed by 400 mg po bid dose x
7 days then 200 mg po daily. Vascular surgery were reconsulted
with question of anticoagulation in the setting of AAA and
advised that AAA is not a contraindication to anticoagulation.
The patient was started on anticoagulation with unfractionated
heparin while in the hospital in anticipation of colonoscopy.
After EGD/colonoscopy, she was then started on lower dose
Coumadin, 3 mg daily,  (as she was also on Levaquin and
Amiodarone). Given history of a prior stroke which puts her at a
high risk for thromboembolic events, it was felt that the
patient needs to be bridged with Heparin to overlap with
t
