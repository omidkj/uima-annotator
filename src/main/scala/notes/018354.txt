In the ED inital vitals were, 00:35 5 98.5 118 165/97 18 95% ra


A CXR was performed that showed no acute cardiopulmonary
process. He was given multiple nebulizer treatments and
prednisone 60 mg PO x 1. His initial peak flow was 150. Repeat
after 3 nebs was 200.

Initial exam showed poor air movement and diffuse wheezing. He
was able to speak in complete sentences and was not in
respiratory distress with no accessory muscle usage.

He was intially placed in observation for nebulizer treatments
every two hours. However while he was in observation, he
triggered for pulse oximetry [**Location (un) 1131**] of 88 % on room air. On
repeat exam, his lungs were very tight with poor air movement.
He was given magnesium 2 mg. He received continuous nebulized
albuterol for an hour and on repeat exam, he still have poor air
movement. He was subsequently admitted to the MICU for continued
asthma exacerbation and poor peak flow measurements.

Labs on transfer were significant for WBC 13.4, Hgb 16.6, Plt
340 with neutrophilia and lymphopenia. Chem panel was within
normal limits except hyperglycemia.

VS on transfer: 110 19 152/101 94% on neb, peak flow 200.

.
On arrival to the ICU, patient was able to relate above history.
He was in no acute respiratory distress. He was given continuous
albuterol nebs, 3 L of LR given tachycardia and hypovolemia. ABG
on 5 L NC and 50 % FM showed pH 7.42, pCO2 35, pO2 70, HCO3 23,
lactate 4.6. RRV screen was performed, and he was placed on
influenza precautions. A sputum culture was also obtained.

[**2154-3-2**] 3:38 pm Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture
      Source: Nasopharyngeal swab.

   Respiratory Viral Culture (Preliminary):

   Respiratory Viral Antigen Screen (Final [**2154-3-3**]):
      Negative for Respiratory Viral Antigen.
      Specimen screened for: Adeno, Parainfluenza 1, 2, 3,
Influenza A, B,
      and RSV by immunofluorescence.
      Refer to Respiratory Virus Identification for further
information.

[**2154-3-2**] 7:06 pm SPUTUM      Source: Expectorated.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2154-3-2**]**

   GRAM STAIN (Final [**2154-3-2**]):
      >25 PMNs and >10 epithelial cells/100X field.
      Gram stain indicates extensive contamination with upper
respiratory
      secretions. Bacterial culture results are invalid.
      PLEASE SUBMIT ANOTHER SPECIMEN.

   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2154-3-2**]):
      TEST CANCELLED, PATIENT CREDITED.

[**2154-3-2**]:
STUDY: PA and lateral chest radiograph.
COMPARISON: None.
FINDINGS: The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
The lungs are clear. There is no pleural effusion or
pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

[**2154-3-3**]:
AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to
[**2144-3-2**].
Heart size and mediastinum are stable. Lungs are essentially
clear. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum
demonstrated on the current examination. Bibasal opacities are
noted and might reflect small areas of atelectasis, new since
the prior study that might also reflect compromised aeration
through compromised airways or fatigue of inspiration
musculature, please correlate clinically.

CTA w/ and w/out contrast ([**2154-3-3**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute aortic syndrome or pulmonary embolus.
2. Areas of atelectasis in the lingula, and right lower lobe.
