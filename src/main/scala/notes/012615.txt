Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4327**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION:
Selective coronary angiography of this left-dominant system
demonstrated significant single-vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA had no angiographically-apparent flow-limiting
stenoses. The LAD had a 100% mid-vessel occlusion, with diffuse
disease throughout and a 50-60% stenosis in the distal segment.
The large LCx had luminal irregularities up to 30%; there was a
large first OMB with a superior and inferior branch, a large
first and second posterolateral branch, and a large dominant
PDA.  These vessels were free of angiographically-apparent
disease.  The non-dominant RCA was small and diffusely diseased.

1. Anterior STEMI.
2. Single vessel coronary artery disease with LAD occlusion.
3. Successful drug-eluting stents to the mid-LAD.


History of Present Illness:
44 yo M with history of HTN and HL (untreated), obesity, former
tobacco abuse had acute onset [**9-7**] CP after eating dinner. He
reports that the pain was sudden onset, substernal, radiation to
the arms, he was diaphoretic and vomited x2. He reports that he
had never had any chest pain before.

He initially presented to OSH got ASA, plavix, NTG (which
dropped his pressure), morphine. He was then transfered to
[**Hospital1 18**]. His EKG had ST elevations in V2-5. He was evaluated in
the ED and a STEMI was called amd he was taken urgently to the
Cardiac Cath Lab. Found to have complete occulsion of LAD.
Reopened and 3 DES were placed with good result. Transfered to
the CCU in stable condition.

On arrival to the floor, patient was stable with a TR band in
place on right wrist. Denies chest pain or SOB.

Pertinent Results:
[**2129-6-27**] Chest X-Ray: The mediastinal silhouette and hilar
contours are normal.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax
is present. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.

[**2129-6-27**] Cardiac Cath: Selective coronary angiography of this
left-dominant system demonstrated significant single-vessel
coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had no
angiographically-apparent flow-limiting stenoses. The LAD
had a 100% mid-vessel occlusion, with diffuse disease throughout
and a
50-60% stenosis in the distal segment.  The large LCx had
luminal
irregularities up to 30%; there was a large first OMB with a
superior
and inferior branch, a large first and second posterolateral
branch, and
a large dominant PDA. These vessels were free of
angiographically-apparent disease.  The non-dominant RCA was
small and diffusely diseased.
1. Anterior STEMI.
2. Single vessel coronary artery disease with LAD occlusion.
3. Successful drug-eluting stents to the mid-LAD.

[**2129-6-29**] Cardiac Echo:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with akinesis of the mid and apical anteroseptal
wall, and dyskinesis of the apex. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed (EF is 30-35% %). No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe regional wall motion abnormalities consistent
with infarct in the mid-LAD territory. Borderline pulmonary
hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
44 year old male with Hx HTN and HLD presented with chest pain
and was found to have a large STEMI.

#STEMI: Patiently initially presented to OSH with complaints of
chest pain and then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. His EKG was notable
for 2-3mm ST elevations in the anterio-septal leads. He was
loaded with ASA, plavix, placed on heparin ggt and he was taken
urgently to the cardiac cath lab where he was found to have 100%
occlusion of the mid LAD. The LAD was opened and DES x3 were
placed. We was placed on Integrillin following the cath and he
was loaded with Prasugrel. His CK peaked at 4219, MB: 5.8
troponin I 10.58. An echo on HD2 showed an EF of 30-35%, severe
regional wall motion abnormalities consistent with infarct in
the mid-LAD territory, and borderline pulmonary hypertension. He
was placed on coumadin given the decreased EF and apical
akinesis. Given the increased bleeding risk of prasugrel and
coumadin the prasugrel was discontinued and he was loaded with
plavix. He was maintained on ASA, plavix, coumadin, metoprolol,
and lisinopril while in the hospital without bleeding and with
his blood pressure well controlled in the 110s. He was
discharged with cardiology follow-up. A repeat echo should be
obtained in several weeks to evaulate if there is any return on
LV function and if continued coumadin is required.
.
#Hypertension: Per report he has a history of HTN that was being
treated with lifestyle modification. On arrival to the hospital
his SBP was in the 130's. Following the cardiac cath he was
started on metoporol and captopril and his SBP was in the 110's.
He was transitioned to metoprolol XL and lisinopril. He
tolerated this regimen with blood pressures at goal SBP<130
prior to discharge.
.
#HLD: Per report he has a history of HLD that was being treated
with lifestyle modification. He was placed on atorvastatin 80mg
for post MI treatment. This should be reevaluated as an
outpatient with a target LDL <70.
.
Transitions of Care:
- Patient being discahrged on coumadin, He will follow-up in
[**Hospital 197**] clinic for monitoring of INR.
- Patient will likely need a repeat TTE in 6 weeks to assess for
akinesis, dyskinesis of ventricle and to decide on further need
for anticoagulation.
