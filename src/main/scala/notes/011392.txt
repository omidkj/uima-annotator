Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
acute pulmonary edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 98553**] is a 89yo M w/ a PMH of CAD, CHF (EF 15-20%), HTN,
hyperlipidemia, and DM who presents with acute shortness of
breath. Pt had gone to his granddaughter's baby shower on [**Name (NI) 1017**]
and afterwards, noted that he was short of breath. His family
does not think that he ate any additional salt, but it is
unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2130-11-6**] where the
HPI noted a week of weakness and dyspnea. Initial O2 sats was
80%, BP was 180/92. His CXR was c/w volume overload and he was
diagnosed with CHF vs. acute pulmonary edema requiring emergent
intubation. He was noted to be a difficult intubation and
required LMA mask ventilation before an adequate ETT was able to
be placed fiberoptically (7.5 ETT). He was maintained on IMV
initially and required a dopamine gtt transiently for
hypotension. Initial labs were notable for a normal WBC (7.0),
Hct (40.9), and BNP of 1180. EKG showed a paced rhythm. He was
given 80mg IV lasix x1 for his edema. On [**11-7**], CPAP was
attempted but pt did not tolerate this due to apnea. CT of the
head was performed and was negative for an acute bleed. It did
show atrophy c/w age and bilateraly maxillary sinus soft tissue
changes, with question of polyps. Pulmonary was consulted and
felt his respiratory failure was due to CHF/pulmonary edema.
Attempts were made at diuresis with lasix, but he was noted to
be in acute renal failure with a Cr of 2.0. His CXR on [**11-7**]
showed some improvement and his sedation was weaned but he went
back into pulmonary edema, for reasons that are unclear. His
sedation was achieved with versed gtt and boluses of morphine.
He was noted to be in afib w/ RVR on [**11-8**]. He was found to have
a troponin leak with a trop I peak of 6.03. An ECHO showed an EF
of 15-20%. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] intubated for cardiac
catheterization for NSTEMI. In the cath lab, he was found to
have normal coronaries (no occlusion of stents) and he was sent
to the CCU for further monitoring.
.
In reviewing his EKGs from the OSH, on [**11-6**] he appeared to be
v-paced, with intermittent natural conduction which appeared to
be LBBB. On [**11-8**], his EKG showed slow afib with intermitten
v-pacing. Native QRS complexes showed TWI in I, II, and aVF and
ST depressions in V3.
.
ROS was unable to be obtained as pt was intubated and sedated.

Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (LVEF= 20-30 %) secondary to severe
hypokinesis-to-near akinesis of the inferior septum, inferior
free wall, and posterior wall. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests
an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
size is normal. Right ventricular systolic function appears
depressed. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2129-8-25**], the mitral regurgitation is increased.
.
CT abdomen/pelvis: IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.
2. Stable lesion in the dome of the liver likely represents
simple cyst or hemangioma.
3. Numerous large simple-appearing renal cysts bilaterally.
4. Sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
.
Renal US: IMPRESSION: No evidence of renal artery stenosis.
Normal flow to kidneys bilaterally. No hydronephrosis.
.
Chest CT: IMPRESSION:
1. No bronchial obstruction or bronchiectasis. Severe bilateral
consolidation and bronchopneumonia, possibly hemorrhagic.
Minimal reactive central adenopathy.
2. Unhcharacterized liver lesion should be evaluated with
ultrasound.
3. Severe atherosclerosis including coronary arteries. Possible
calcific aortic stenosis.
4. Anasarca and small nonhemorrhagic bilateral pleural
effusions.
5. Marked left atrial enlargement.

Brief Hospital Course:
89yo M w/ CAD s/p multiple stents, pacemaker, CHF w/ EF 15%-20%,
[**Hospital 23051**] transferred from OSH after being intubated for CHF
exacerbation in setting of NSTEMI, subsequently developed MSSA
bacteremia and PNA and acute on chronic renal failure. After
considering the patient's overall prognosis, his family decided
to refocus the goals of his care on comfort only. Non-comfort
therapies, including ventilatory support, were withdrawn, and
the patient passed away shortly thereafter.
