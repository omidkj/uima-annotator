Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from [**Hospital6 17032**] for management of
sepsis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
    The patient is a 74 year old female with a past medical
history significant for CAD, CHF (EF 45%), COPD, and who was
recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2179-10-24**] until [**2179-10-30**] for
multiple problems, including MRSA bacteremia complicated by
mitral valve endocarditis, right upper lobe pneumonia, and ST
elevation myocardial infarction.  During her last
hospitalization, initial plans for cardiac intervention were
deferred due to sepsis, hypotension, and the discovery of high
grade MRSA bacteremia.  The patient was discharged on [**10-30**] to
[**Location (un) **] House rehabilitation facility so that she could
complete her six week course of Vancomycin.
    On [**11-15**], the patient developed shaking chills, fever to 102,
and hives while being administered Vancomycin.   She also had
loose stools for a period of days, and anorexia.  She presented
to [**Hospital6 17032**] on [**11-15**] for further evaluation.
 Her hospital course was notable for periods of hypotension (SBP
70-80s), requiring IVF and low dose neosynephrine.  The patient
was given empiric treatment with Flagyl for C. difficile
colitis.  She was administered Linezolid instead of Vancomycin
for coverage of her MRSA bacteremia.  Repeat blood cultures from
the outside hospital have grown [**4-18**] gram positive cocci in
pairs/clusters, with preliminary ID consistent with
Staphylococci.  The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU
for further management of her hypotension and infectious issues.


Past Medical History:
CAD (anterior-inferior defects noted on previous stress tests),
s/p STEMI on [**2179-10-24**].  Plans for cardiac intervention during
recent hospitalization were deferred due to sepsis, hypotension,
and the discovery of high grade MRSA bacteremia. ECHO disclosed
EF 40-45%, and possible RV free wall depression.  Peak CK=580,
Trop 1.55. Patient is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11493**].

Staph aureus bacteremia, [**10-18**], complicated by mitral valve
endocarditis.   Patient started on Vancomycin [**2179-10-26**].  Source
of MRSA bacteremia not identified, although may have been
secondary to MRSA pneumonia (see below).

RUL multifocal pneumonia, associated with parapneumonic right
pleural effusion, noted on CT chest on [**2179-10-27**].  Attempts to
sample this fluid collection were unsuccessful due to its
relatively small size.

Right hilar lymphadenopathy (2.3 x 2.3 cm right hilar lymph
node) noted on [**10-27**] CT chest.

1.6 cm left breast mass

Left upper lip basal cell carcinoma

CHF (EF=40-45%, 1+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] [**2179-10-28**]),

COPD

Venous thromboembolism- PE. Patient takes Coumadin daily.

Hyperthyroidism

Hyperlipidemia

Obesity

Diverticulosis (noted on CT abdomen in [**10-18**])


Social History:
The patient lives alone, but was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**10-30**]
to [**Location (un) **] House rehabilatation facility.  The patient has two
children.  The patient has a 20 pack year history of tobacco
use. She has a history of occasional ETOH use. No history of
illicit drugs.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  74 year old female with multiple medical problems,
including CAD, CHF (EF 45%), and  COPD, s/p recent [**Hospital1 18**]
hospitalization for MRSA bacteremia complicated by mitral valve
endocarditis, right upper lobe pneumonia, and ST elevation
myocardial infarction.  Patient now transferred from OSH for
further evaluation of leukocytosis, acute renal failure, and
hypotension requiring neosynephrine/IVF.

1.	Sepsis:
Pt had been recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] with MRSA
endocarditis and bacteremia, and prior to this admission it was
discovered at the OSH that she continued to have MRSA
bacteremia.  The day of her transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] she had [**4-18**] blood
culture bottles positive for MRSA at the OSH and was started on
Linezolid at that institution.

Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was continued on Linezolid,
Infectious Disease was consulted and other possible infectious
etiologies such as C diff were ruled out.  Blood cultures drawn
here were also [**4-18**] positive on the day of admit. She was started
empirically on Flagyl for a brief course until 3 C diff toxin
tests were negative.  Her PICC line was thought to be a likely
nidus for her continued bacteremia and was d/c'd and cultured,
but failed to grow an organism.

Her BP was maintained with IVF and Levophed initially, though
pressors were quickly weaned off in the first night.

ID felt that her continued bacteremia was much more likely due
to an absces than to resistance to Vancomycin, and recommended
that we search for such a collection.  [**Month/Day (4) **] was chosen as the
first study, given the pt's h/o endocarditis.  The [**Month/Day (4) **] revealed
worsening endocarditis as well as a new abscess near the mitral
valve.

2. MRSA endocarditis/abscess:
[**Month/Day (4) **] revealed MV abscess and worse endocarditis of MV as well as
possible involvement of the AV.  ID recommended changing from
the linezolid back to vanc, but adding daptomycin as well and
initially gentamycin. They also recommended getting a head CT to
r/o emboli prior to her likely needed surgery for abscess
drainage.  CT [**Doctor First Name **] was initially recommended cath in prep for
surgery given recent STEMI, but then after further review was
not convinced that the pt had a true abscess requiring s
