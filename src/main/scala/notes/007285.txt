Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1070**]
Chief Complaint:
cough, SOB, ARF.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
84 yo Russian speaking man with h/o MDS, PAF and new congestive
heart failure of unclear etiology with gradual decline since the
middle of [**Month (only) 359**]. Originally noted lower extremity edema and
cough in mid [**8-27**] pillow orthopnea over the last year
(change compared to previous [**11-26**] pillows last year). He denied
fever, chills, nausea or vomiting. Admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from
[**Date range (1) 19710**]/05. He appeared volume overloaded on exam and had an
elevated BNP. CXR with ?PNA/effusion. He was treated with
antibiotics, gradually diuresed, and sent home on home O2. He
had TTE which was read after he was discharged and revealed new
CHF.

Since his discharge, he has had significant difficulties at
home. He has been getting progressively weaker and his weight is
increasing. He continues to note a cough, worse with lying down.
He had TFTs showing new hypothyroidism, but unlikely source of
CHF. He had not made appointment with heart failure clinic yet.
Trial of lisinopril 5 mg daily resulted in SBP in the 80s. Lasix
dose increased from 20 to 40 mg for three days to see if this
would help. He did not note any increase in urine.

Over the last 12 hours, no urine output. He continues to feel
weak and SOB. No other symptoms. Went for weekly blood check
this AM and HCT 27, but K 5.5 and Cr 2.5.  He had declined
admission in the past, but is now willing to get admitted.
Currently declining ED, but is willing for direct admission.


Past Medical History:
- Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS); dx'd [**2131**], requiring Q 2wk
transfusions (last 2u PRBCs [**9-24**]), treated with azacitidine
first five cycles followed by thalidomide, but he since stopped
this for unclear reason, possibly due to fatigue.
- PAF, not on coumadin
- Echo [**2140**]: EF 60%, 1+MR, mod PA HTN
- s/p CCY, Appy
- BPH
- PPD+ [**2131**], no treatment


Social History:
The patient formerly lived in [**Country 532**] moved to approximately 10
years ago with his wife and family. He smoked for 30 pack years
but quit over 30 years ago. He drinks alcohol rarely. He does
not have any history of drug abuse. The patient lives in an
apartment with his wife in [**Name (NI) 583**]. It is [**Hospital3 4634**].



Family History:
Unremarkable.

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2142-10-26**]: Enlarging moderate left pleural effusion, stable
right pleural effusion.
.
CXR [**2142-10-22**]: New bilateral small pleural effusions and mild
fluid overload.
.
GU u/s [**2142-10-22**]: 1. Enlarged bladder, no hydronephrosis in the
setting of a moderately enlarged prostate gland. Patient was
unable to void and this is likely due to acute surely urinary
retention, depending on clinical correlation. 2. Kidneys are
normal in size for the patient's age.
.
Echo [**2142-9-28**]: LVEF 35-40%. The left atrium is elongated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.  The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately depressed. Resting regional wall motion
abnormalities include inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis
with mild hypokinesis elsewhere. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is borderline
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. There is a minimally increased
gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion. Compared with the report of the prior
study (tape unavailable for review) of [**2141-7-11**], left
ventricular systolic function is now abnormal. Mitral
regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation are now more
prominent.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) ARF: The Pt's ARF was likely post-renal obstruction given
BPH. Pre renal azotemia may have contributed as well.  The
patient was evaluated by renal who felt much of his failure was
also due to poor cardiac output in setting of his worsening
heart failure. Work up of renal failure was otherwise negative.
His creatinine did not improve during the course of his
admission.

2) Systolic congestive heart failure: The patient was volume
overloaded on exam (elevated JVP and LE edema, and effusion on
CXR) and was therefore diuresed with IV lasix.  Approximately
1.5L was diuresed, with modest improvement in SOB and resolution
of LE edema.  Pt. had been hyperkalemic on admission; this also
resolved with diuresis. When Pt. was felt to be euvolemic,
diuresis was stopped.  Unfortunately, the Pt's recuperation
seemed to be limited by a combination of poor PO intake and
inability to tolerate cardiac meds (both afterload reducers for
CHF, and rate and rhythm controllers for PAF), due to low bp
(baseline 90s/50s).  IVF boluses did help to keep bp up, but due
to poor cardiac function and tendency toward 3rd-spacing fluids,
this was not an effective measure for long-term pressure
support.  Several episodes of desaturation into the high-80s
prompted a repeat CXR which revealed worsening bilateral pleural
effusions.

The Pt. was evaluated by both cardiology and renal, and his poor
cardiac function was felt to be due to multi-vesse
