History of Present Illness:
63 yo female with history of schizoaffective disorder with SI,
UC s/p sigmoidectomy, COPD who was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 39099**]
for pneumonia and suicidal ideation. Patient presented on
[**2105-6-1**] s/p fall at her group home and found to be hypotensive
secondary to dehydration and atenolol intake.
.
Of note, she has had multiple admissions in the past for
lightheadness and was admitted to [**Hospital1 112**] for the same complaint
from [**Date range (1) 39100**]. At that time the patient fell in the bathroom
and hit the back of her head on her bath tub. She recalls having
a head CT which was negative. Up to and throughout that
hospitalization she had nausea and vomiting which only resolved
on her day prior to discharge. After discharge she was feeling
well and tolerating PO's. She had occassional feelings of
diziness, but thought it was due to the psychosocial stress over
the murder of her grandson's girlfriend.
.
She continued to eat and drink well with no diarrhea, melena,
hematochezia. She denied headache but has been taking Motrin
600mg qid for left hip pain. She decided to take her Atenolol
which she had taken in the past but was no longer taking on the
morning of admission. The diziness progressed and she felt
presyncopal and fell onto her backside with her left foot
underneath her. She had no fecal or urinary incontinence. In ED,
her SBP was in the 70's and she was given 1 liter fluid with
good response. It was initially thought to be due to atenolol
ovedose and she was given glucagon and calcium gluconate with no
further improvement. Pt complained of foot pain and had negative
plain x-ray of her foot, but after she was given 1mg of morphine
her SBP's decreased to to 60's which didn't respond to Narcan so
decision was made for ICU admission. Patient responded well to
IVF in the ICU and thought that her symptoms were a combination
of Atenolol overdose along with dehydration from decrease po
intake.

Brief Hospital Course:
63 yo female with multiple medical problems who presented s/p
fall and found to be hypotensive secondary to dehydration and
ingestion of atenolol that seemed to have resolved with IVF.
.
1. Hypotension:
- likely secondary to dehydration as responded well to IVF and
did have some acute renal failure that resolved with fluids
- could have been superimposed with atenolol overdose although
patient denies taking multiple pills. BP and HR have returned to
[**Location 213**] by HD#2. Will continue to hold Atenolol until
reevaluation of BP as an outpatient. Suggest restarting at a
lower dose and titrating up gradually.
- has had multiple workups in the past including a pMIBI in [**9-9**]
which was unremarkable. Echo done [**2105-6-2**] showed EF 55-60% with
mild to moderate AR and mild MR; no evidence of any wall motion
abnormalities
- was ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes
- medications adjusted as per Psych team; avoid narcotics
.
2. Heme:
- HCT drop likely secondary to volume resuscitation
- iron studies consistent with deficiency of chronic disease
likely from her ulcerative colitis with inappropriately low
Retic Index. Guaiac neg on exam. Instructed to f/u with PCP for
further monitoring.
.
3. COPD:
- not wheezy at this time and so will continue on outpatient
Combivent and Advair MDI's.
- smoking cessation; is on Wellbutrin which will facilitate
this; cont nicotine patch to prevent withdrawal
.
4. Foot pain:
- findings not suggestive of severe trauma and plain films show
no fracture
- continue to treat with Ibuprofen around the clock, and Tylenol
prn, and be gentle with narcotics for risk of hypotension
-PT evaluation. Is safe to go to home with cane. Will arrange
VNA home PT to work on strength and use of cane.
.
5. Schizoaffective D/O:
- denies SI at this time and denies taking overdose of atenolol
- seen by the Psychiatry team who recommended to d/c buspirone,
reduce trazodone, and reduce risperidone and move it to QHS
Did not need sitter at any point. No SI/AH.
.
6. Ulcerative colitis:
- denies diarrhea as precipitant for dehydration and labs show
no low bicarb
- cont on her output mesalamine dose. Is guaiac Neg.
.
7. Renal:
- initially presented with acute renal insufficiency secondary
to dehydration as resolved with IVF from 1.7 to 0.7
