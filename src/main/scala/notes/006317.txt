REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   Review of systems revealed no fever, now
with chills.  No change in bowel habits recently.  The
patient is on Bactrim and no other antibiotics.

SOCIAL HISTORY:

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed the patient's temperature was 95 degrees Fahrenheit,
her heart rate was 65, her blood pressure was 130/80 (with a
subsequent decrease to 70/40 later on), her respiratory rate
was 25, and her oxygen saturation was 97% on room air.  In
general, the patient looked uncomfortable with a swollen nose
and blood on his lips.  The nose was ecchymotic.  The patient
is legally blind.  The lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  No wheezes or rales.  Heart revealed a regular
rate and rhythm.  The abdomen was thin, very distended, and
tender.  There was some guarding.  Rectal examination was
guaiac-positive.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on
admission revealed the patient's white blood cell count was
5.8, her hematocrit was 36.5, and her platelets were 115.
The patient's lactate was 7.8.  Electrolytes revealed the
patient's sodium was 128, potassium was 4.9, chloride was 99,
bicarbonate was 16, blood urea nitrogen was 26, creatinine
was 2.1, and her blood glucose was 88.  Arterial blood gas
revealed pH was 7.05, her PCO2 was 60, and her PO2 was 115,
bicarbonate was 18, base -14.  Her alanine-aminotransferase
was 234, her aspartate aminotransferase was 65, her alkaline
phosphatase was 47, her total bilirubin was 0.4, her amylase
was 88, and her lipase was 79.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A computed tomography of the
abdomen and pelvis on admission revealed diffuse pneumatosis
of the cecum and small bowel with portal venous air;
consistent with ischemia.

A computed tomography of the head showed no intracranial
hemorrhage (taken due to a report of syncope and fall with
signs of facial trauma).

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to
the operating room the next day where she had a subtotal
colectomy with ileostomy.  Surgical pathology of the specimen
showed markedly dilated proximal colon with extensive
ischemic necrosis focally transmural; consistent with toxic
megacolon.

The patient was taken to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for
further stabilization.  The patient remained in the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit until [**11-13**] where she required a
significant amount of blood products.  More specifically, 9
units of packed red blood cells, 5 units of platelets, and 13
units of fresh frozen plasma, and 2 units of cryoprecipitate.
The patient was intubated for management of her respiratory
status and was eventually extubated on [**11-13**].

While the patient was still in the Intensive Care Unit, total
parenteral nutrition was started for nutritional support.  On
[**11-10**], a postpyloric feeding tube (nasojejunal tube)
was placed on [**11-10**] for tube feeds, and the patient was
started on Nepro full strength tube feed formula starting at
10 cc per hour and flushing slowly.  The tube feed formula
was changed on [**11-13**] to ProMod with fiber full
strength.  The patient remained on this formula until the day
of discharge on goal rate.

In terms of medications, the patient was started from the day
of her admission on her home medications of
immunosuppression; that was tacrolimus and azathioprine plus
intravenous steroids.

Blood cultures, urine cultures, and peritoneal cultures were
drawn on [**11-4**] and [**11-5**] along with Clostridium
difficile toxin assays (stool test).  On [**11-5**],
[**11-6**], and [**11-7**] all cultures were negative, and
the screening culture for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus
and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were also
negative on [**11-8**].  However, was started on Flagyl 500
mg three times per day for presumed Clostridium difficile
colitis started on no evidence 14 and continued until
[**11-16**] for empiric treatment of suspected Clostridium
difficile colitis.

The patient was transferred to the floor on [**11-13**].
Since then the patient has been improving.  The patient has
been afebrile and has been tolerating her tube feeds.  Total
parenteral nutrition was eventually stopped.  The patient was
advanced on her tube feeds at a goal rate.  On [**11-17**],
she was advanced to clears.  On [**11-18**], she was advanced
to a regular diet without any problems.

The plan was for the patient to be discharged on [**11-19**]
to a rehabilitation facility on no antibiotics, on her
immunosuppression medications (tacrolimus currently at 5 mg
by mouth twice per day; azathioprine 50 mg by mouth at hour
of sleep, and prednisone 5 mg by mouth once per day).  The
patient was also to be discharged on all of the rest of her
home medications and Bactrim as prophylaxis.

The patient was instructed to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
(Nephrology) and with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (at the Transplant Center)
per instructions.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  (Discharge medications included)
 1.  Tacrolimus 5 mg by mouth twice per day.
 2.  Desipramine 150 mg by mouth once per day.
 3.  Reglan 10 mg by mouth four times per day.
 4.  Tylenol 325 mg to 650 mg by mouth q.4-6h. as needed.
 5.  Lansoprazole 30 mg by mouth once per day.
 6.  Metamucil one wafer by mouth every day.
 7.  Azathioprine 50 mg by mouth at hour of sleep.
