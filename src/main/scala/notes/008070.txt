Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**]
Chief Complaint:
Mental status changes and increased oral secretion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Liver biopsy

History of Present Illness:
76 year-old male with hx of traumatic brain injury with
bilateral SDH and R MCA stroke in [**10-4**] after being on
coumadin, hx of multi-resistant Klebsiella pneumonia, MRSA
bacteremia/pneumonia, VRE bactremia, s/p tracheostomy and PEG
[**10-29**] who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] with fever of
101.6, mental status changes, and increasing oral secretions.
At baseline, the patient responds to verbal stimuli, able to
follow some commands, and occasionally speaks through PMV.
However, his mental status does wax and wane.  His daughter
reports that over the past 10-12 hr prior to admission, his
mental status has been poor, minimally responsive, not
responding to sternal rub, and only rarely opens his eyes.  She
also states that the respiratory therapy at Rehab noted
increasing secretions and thickening of secretions over the last
2-3 days.  She states that her father's O2 sats were dropping
into 60's for [**2-28**] minute intervals today as well.  From the
rehab notes, new sputum culture growing pan-resistant Klebsiella
that is sensitive to meropenem and ertrapenem.  Urine cx growing
same species ([**1-19**]).  Patient was started on Ertrapenem and
doxycycline.  Patient was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further
management.

Pertinent Results:
Studies:
CT head: Left parietal and frontal subdural hematomas are again
identified. Several small areas of increased attenuation seen
within the left parietal subdural hematoma which were not
present on the most recent prior study. These are suspicious for
rebleeding within the subdural hematoma. The size of the
parietal subdural hematoma is essentially unchanged measuring
approximately 11 mm in greatest dimension. The tiny left frontal
subdural hematoma is stable in appearance. Encephalomalacic
changes throughout the brain are stable. The ventricles,
cisterns, and sulci are stable with no evidence of
hydrocephalus.

The osseous structures demonstrate bifrontal and parietal prior
craniotomies. Opacification is seen within the frontal, ethmoid,
sphenoid, and bilateral mastoid air cells. There is
near-complete opacification of the right maxillary sinus. These
findings are stable compared to the prior study.


Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course: Initially he finished 2 weeks course of
Meropenem/Ampicillin for VRE and bacteremia and ESBL Klebsiella
PNA.  Pt also noted to have ulcers of L knee, heel, decubitous.
MS did not improve after treating infection.  Pt with episode of
questionable seizure on [**1-21**]. EEG done on [**1-21**] with abnormal
focal sezire from L parasagittal area.  Dilantin was then
started for seizure ppx.  His hospital course was complicated by
multiple trips to the ICU for likely sepsis from either
aspiration pneumonia and cellulitis/osteo.  On [**2-18**], he was
febrile, hypoxic to 89% RA, hypotensive to 70/30.  He was fluid
resuscitated, Vanc/meropenem were re-started, and transferred
back to the floor on [**2-19**]. Pt was stable until he became febrile
on [**3-11**] and meropenem re-started.  Pt had a witnessed aspiration
on [**3-12**].  On [**3-13**], Vanc re-started for persistent fever.  Stool
was + for C.diff and Flagyl was started.  Pt also noted to have
transaminitis, ultrasound showing hypoechoic lesions, and
following abdominal CT showed multiple liver lesions.  The
lesion was biopsied and the pathology was consistent with
adenocarcinoma.  The primary was thought likely colon ca given
his hx of colon ca, and hx of GIB.  On [**3-20**], pt became febrile,
BP 70-80/40's, HR in 120, got 4L IVF and 2 units of PRBC.  The
following day, he got abd CT which showed small pericapsular
hematoma but not big enough to account for the hypotension.
Given his new cancer diagnosed, his wife decided to make him
DNR/DNI.  He was treated with 2 week course of Vanc/meropenem
and remained clinically stable.  He was off the antibiotics for
several days.  He was clinically stable until [**4-5**] when he had
another episode of fever and hypotension, so Vanc/meropenem were
re-started and IVF given to maintain his BP.  He again remained
afebrile and hemodynamically stable until [**4-23**]. At that time he
spiked fever, blood, urine sent for culture and chest x-ray
obtained.  Chest x-ray with no change/evidence of infiltrate.
Urine came back with Gram negative rods.  Patient started on
vanc/meropenem initially which was switched to meropenem once
urinary source revealed.  Patient needs imipenem or meropenam
given history of pseudomonas.  Speciation pending at time of
discharge.  Needs meropenam for additional 10 days. Patient has
had chronic foley requirement. He had few episodes of urethal
bleed when attempted to remove the foley in early [**Month (only) 958**].  At
that time a 3-way foley was inserted for irrigation. Plan is to
keep foley in place given significant clots/bleeding and
difficulty in re-placing a new catheter and to minimize
patient's suffering.

1. Hypotension/fever. He was transferred to the unit on [**2-17**]
with hypotension, trop leak, and new Klebsiella pna. Again
trasferred to Unit [**2-18**] for hypotension which responded to
fluids and transfusion. Finished course of meropenem for ESBL
Klebsiella on [**2126-3-2**].  It was thought to be secondary to
hypovolemia, however also considered cardiogenic shock, sepsis,
and adrenal insufficiency.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim test negative. BP
responded to NS boluses and 2 Units of PRBC's. Hypotension
resolved but did require periodic NS boluses over [**Date range (1) 15001**]
weekend again. BP since stabilized.  Knee ulcer (as below) c/w
polymicrobial contamination without radiographic signs of
osteomyelitis.  Recurrent aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis
also is a risk fact for recurrent infection. Per ENT, new trach
will not necessarily limit further aspiration because always
will have some cuff leak. Main indications for trach would be
the need for PS or need for pulmonar
