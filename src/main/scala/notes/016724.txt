HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 39-year-old gentleman,
who sustained a 30-foot fall, hitting a porch prior to
landing on the ground.  There was no loss of consciousness,
and the patient arrived in the Trauma Bay complaining of a
chest pain on arrival.  He was noted to have a massive
bleeding from his oropharynx and became hypotensive to the
60s.  He was emergently intubated, and a right femoral cordis
was placed.  His blood pressure improved with a fluid
resuscitation, and his chest x-ray was clear.  He had good
saturations after intubation.  A DPL was performed given his
hypotension as an unknown source that was positive after
instillation of 1 L of saline.  He was also noted to have a
left upper extremity open fracture.  He was taken emergently
to the operating room for exploration.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Unknown.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Unknown.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  None known.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Unknown.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Initial physical exam:  Heart rate was
88, blood pressure 82/palpations, and 02 saturation 90
percent.  The patient had an unstable face with a lip
laceration and blood in his oropharynx.  GCS of 15.  Pupils
equal, round, and reactive with TMs clear.  Heart:  Regular
rate and rhythm.  S1 and S2.  Chest:  Clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Sternum stable with no crepitus.  Abdomen is
soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Rectal was guaiac
negative with a normal prostate and normal tone.  Back showed
no step-offs or lacerations.  Pelvis was stable.  Left
forearm with an open fracture unstable with a 2 plus radial
pulse.  Right arm question dislocation, and left and right
lower extremities are without deformities.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 8.1, hematocrit
38.9, and platelets 244,000.  Chemistry-7:  Sodium 143,
potassium 4, chloride 104, and bicarbonate 29.  PT was 12.2,
PTT 19.4, INR 1.0, fibrinogen 199, and lactate was 3.5.  ABG:
pH was 7.38, pCO2 43, pO2 232, bicarbonate 26, and base
deficit minus 2.  UA was moderate blood and urine tox
negative.  Initial films:  Chest x-ray negative and pelvis
negative.  Left forearm showed an ulnar fracture with radial
head displacement.  Left shoulder was negative.  Left wrist
was negative.  Right shoulder, a nondisplaced fracture of the
greater tuberosity.  A right humeral neck fracture that was
nondisplaced and impacted.  CT of the head:  Frontal
contusion, small temporal bleed, frontal sinus fracture of
the anterior and posterior table, and Le [**Location 56204**] fracture.
CT of the C-spine was negative.  CT of the chest showed
bilateral pneumothoraces, right greater than left, with a
right upper lobe collapse and a sternal fracture.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  As per HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname 20598**] was taken
emergently to the operating room for exploration.  On
entering the abdomen, they found a laceration of the
transverse mesocolon, splenic decapsulation, liver
laceration, and multiple colonic deserosalizations.  The
splenic decapsulation was repaired, as were the serosal
injuries to the colon.  The transverse mesocolon was
repaired, as was the liver laceration.  The Orthopedic
Surgery team then came into the operating room for washout
and closed reduction of his left Monteggia fracture of the
radial head without long-arm splinting.  He remained
hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure without
hypothermia.  Of note, prior to this, because of the known
intracranial hemorrhage with hemodynamic instability,
Neurosurgery was called for bolt placement.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] ICP
monitor was placed with pressures in the 10 to 13 range.  He
was also placed on IV Ancef perioperatively.  He was then
taken to the Trauma ICU where several consults were obtained,
including an Ophthalmology consult regarding his orbital wall
fractures.  They did not identify any entrapment on CT and
recommended outpatient followup.  He had subsequent bilateral
chest tubes placed and a subclavian line placed on return to
the ICU.  He was seen by Oromaxillofacial Surgery regarding
his facial fractures and was taken to the operating room on
[**2156-4-12**] for open reduction and internal fixation of his mid
face fractures.  Of note, he had a large laceration of his
eyebrow/nasal region that had been closed on the day of
admission.  Of note, because of his multiple facial injuries
and his deteriorating respiratory status over the course of
his ICU stay, he ended up developing Pseudomonas in his
urine.  A tracheostomy was performed on [**2156-4-7**].  He also
had an IVC filter placed on [**2156-4-12**] after bilateral lower
extremity ultrasound revealed a right common femoral vein
nonocclusive thrombus.  A CTA of the chest to evaluate for
pulmonary embolus was negative, but was a poor quality study.
He was subsequently additionally started on a heparin drip.
However, there was difficulty in making him therapeutic, and
a Hematology consult was obtained.  However, he was deemed to
have no identifiable hematologic problem and was eventually
maintained on goal PTT.  Coumadin was subsequently started.
He was maintained on antibiotics for the Pseudomonas in his
sputum.  He did continue to spike temperatures during his ICU
stay and required frequent suctioning and aggressive
pulmonary toilet to manage his copious secretions.  After
recovering from his last operation, which was the ORIF of his
facial fractures, he was finally transferred to the floor on
[**2156-4-20**].  Due to the fact that he was now a candidate for
anticoagulation, Vascular Surgery was re-consulted and his
IVC filter was removed.  He was then placed on Lovenox for
anticoagulation purposes.  He was able then to ambulate with
physical therapy.  However, he continued to have a very poor
p.o. intake.  We strongly encouraged p.o., and he stabilized
his intake and was cleared by Speech and Swallow and was
deemed stable for discharge to home from that standpoint.  He
was also placed on a Passy-Muir valve, which he tolerated
well.  He defervesced, and his antibiotics were stopped, and
he remained without any further infectious issues.  His
mental status improved, and he was able to follow commands,
and he was oriented x 3.  Once his mental status had
improved, his C-spine was clinically cleared and his C-collar
was removed.  He was followed up by Orthopedic Surgery, who
revised his cast after doing repeat films of his left upper
extremity.  He continued to progress well, and he was deemed
stable for discharge to home on postoperative day numbers 29
and 17, which was also hospital day number 30.
