Initial EKG at OSH: STE V1-V3, ST depressions in II, III, AVF

EKG [**9-18**]
Initial portion of the tracing shows an irregular narrow complex
tachycardia.
Question sinus tachycardia with atrial premature beats/question
atrial
tachycardia which is followed by sinus bradycardia. Diffuse ST-T
wave
abnormalities with configuration consistent with acute
anterior(question

suggested. No
previous tracing available for comparison.

Cardiac cath [**9-18**]
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system.
The LMCA was a short artery, but angiographically normal. The
LAD had a
proximal 50% tubular stenosis, a focal 90% stenosis with mid
vessel
thrombus, and a 80% distal stenosis.
2. Limited hemodynamics on entry showed an elevated central
pressure.
4. Successful stenting of the mid LAD with overalpping 2.5 x 23
mm
cypehr DES and 2.0 x 13 mm pixel stent at 14 atms with no
residual
stenosis, no dissection and timi 3 flow. See PTCA comments.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful stenting of the mid LAD.

Echo [**2166-9-19**]
Conclusions:  EF not calculated
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction. Resting
regional wall motion abnormalities include anteroseptal,
anterior and apical
akinesis. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
an anterior
space which most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated
anterior
pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Anterior STEMI: The patient was taken for emergent cardiac
catheterization upon transfer from [**Location (un) 620**]. The patient was
stented twice in the LAD  (cypher DES and hepacoat) and was
continued on integrillin post catheterization for 18 hours. She
was started on aspirin, plavix, a statin, bb, and ACE. Physical
therapy was consulted for cardiac rehab. During her initial
cardiac cath, she was also noted to have a LCx stenosis (>80%),
so it was recommended that she return to the cath lab for
elective stent of this vessel. She returned on [**9-22**] to receive
a Cypher stent to her Left Cx. She recommended to continue
Plavix 75mg for at least 6 months and ASA daily.

2. Pump - Echo post MI showed apical aneurism, moderate LV
dysfunction. She was started on lisinopril and a beta blocker.
She was also started on heparin because of potential for
thrombus formation in the aneurism. She was given Lasix as
needed for diuresis. She was started on coumadin and should
continue this as an outpatient for at least 6 months. She needs
to have her INR checked daily until INR [**12-31**] reached and dosing
should be changed accordingly.

3. Rhythm - The patient was noted to be generally in sinus
rhythm but had occasional runs of atrial tachycardia as well as
atrial fibrillation. Her metoprolol was increased as tolerated,
and she was given Lopressor 5 mg IV prn for runs of atrial
tachycardia which generally occurred prior to her scheduled dose
of oral metoprolol. She was started on anticoagulation with
coumadin as above.

4. Sundowning - This occurred on several evenings, requiring 1:1
observation, which was discontinued >24 hours prior to her
discharge. Her confusion was likely multifactorial: She had a
large anterior MI, followed by cardiac catheterization x 2 with
sedation, EGD w/ sedation, and a prolonged hospital stay.  The
patient was A+Ox2 at baseline. Per her daughter, she did not
have appreciable memory loss or other symptoms. She was given
Zyprexa QHS and ativan as needed for agitation with good effect.
There may be a component of underlying dementia that should be
sorted out once her acute medical issues have completely
resolved.

5. Anemia - The patient's hct dropped from 34 at admission to 27
without known etiology. Hemolysis labs showed no evidence of
hemolysis. Iron studies showed TIBC low, ftn ok, iron low which
suggested a mixed picture of [**Doctor First Name **] and ACD. Guaiac was initially
negative during admission. She had no history of GI bleeding or
scope evaluation prior to this hospitalization. Though she had a
slight R groin ecchymosis post cath with some blood oozing from
around the sheath site, this was not felt to be a large source
of bleeding.  She then developed one episode of melena. She had
an EGD which revealed duodenitis. She will require pantoprazole
as she cannot stop her Plavix and she is at risk for bleeding.
This may require further outpatient work up if her anemia
continues. Her hematocrit remained >30 for several days prior to
discharge. She received a total of 2 units of packed red blood
cells during her admission (on [**9-20**] and [**9-23**]). She remained
hemodynamically stable throughout her admission.

6. Follow-up: The patient will need a PCP and to [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/u with a
cardiologist (we have made her a cardiology appt). In addition,
she needs basic health maintenance such as a screening
colonoscopy and a mammogram. All of the above has been discussed
with patient and her daughter.
