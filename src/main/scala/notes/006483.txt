Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 60 M with recently dx EtOH cirrhosis now with fulminant
liver failure, ARF, PNA.
.
Fulminant Hepatic Failure:  The patient was transferred from an
OSH with known fulminant hepatic failure. 10 days PTA at OSH he
was seen by GI who noted he had a t bili of 38.  He had negative
hepatitis serologies and hemochromatosis w/u as an outpatient
which was negative. The patient also had an ultrasound at the
OSH with questionable portal vein thrombosis. Because of
increasing confusion, he then was admitted to the [**Hospital3 **] on [**7-5**] to the ICU and was found to have a BUN of 104
and creatinine of 9.5. (Of note, 10 days ago per report, his BUN
was 20 and Cr 1). He also had a total bili of 42 and direct bili
of 29 and indirect bili of 12. He had a LDH of 324, amylase of
41 and lipase 65. He had a CXR with a left lower lobe
consolidation with pleural effusion. He was started on
aggressive IV hydration overnight and renal and gastroenterology
were consulted. His creatinine decreased to 8.4 with BUN of 95.
He was transferred here for further evaluation.  Here a RUQ
ultrasound was done but was not of sufficient quality as the pt
was agitated and could not hold his breath.  His t bili rose to
43 and his respiratory status began to decline. He also
continued to be in ARF. He was seen by hepatology and started on
lactulose and rifaximin.  He did not have enough ascites to tap.
He was also seen by the renal team, but since his clinical
course was guarded due to his hepatic failure, it was elected to
hold off on dialysis until it was discussed with the family.
Since he had been drinking as recently as 3 weeks ago, he was
not considered a transplant candidate. This was discussed with
his family and he was made comfort measures only. He was started
on a morphine gtt, given PRN ativan and expired in the morning
of [**2110-7-9**].
