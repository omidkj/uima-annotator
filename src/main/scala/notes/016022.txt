Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Bactrim

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1990**]
Chief Complaint:
Aggression/Manic Behavior/Abnormal labs

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
89M with PMHx of CAD s/p CABG, Aortic Stenosis s/p bovine AVR,
PVD, DM, Systolic CHF (LVEF of 35-40%) and hypothyroidism sent
in on section 12 by PCP after wife reported increasing
aggression and reported manic behavior over the past several
weeks. The patient has a history of CHF and has been undergoing
diuresis intermittently as an outpatient as well as an admission
2 months ago. Denies pain anywhere, fevers, cough, vomiting,
diarrhea, dysuria.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 97.3 100 121/76 18 99%
ED Course (labs, imaging, interventions, consults):
- CXR: Stable cardiomegaly, mild fluid overload
- EKG: afib 98 LAD/LBBB incr ST depr V5-6 c/w prior no Sgarbossi
- urinalysis
- Right IJ placed as patient was difficult IV access
- insulin, D50, calcium and Kayexalate for hyperkalemia
- IV fluid resuscitation for elevated lactate - 2Liters
- Anion gap likely secondary to lactic acidosis
- differential diagnosis in ED included infection, overdiuresis,
ingestion. Likely a toxic metabolic encephalopathy rather than
psychiatric given lab abnormalities. Patient can have psych
consult as an inpatient

- Patient admitted to ICU, given above workup.
.
On the floor, patient is in no distress. [**First Name3 (LF) **] and oriented x3.
Very pleasant. Tells me that he had a disagreement with his
family members this morning, because he was trying to teach his
wife something. Denies any pain anywhere. No cough, no SOB, no
nausea/vomiting/diarrhea/fevers/new rashes. Tells me that he
indeed did not take his medicine for several days, because he
had not eaten in 5 days due to lack of appetite.

STUDIES:
AP CXR: [**11-8**]: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph,
there is minimally improved ventilation at the right lung base.
Otherwise the radiograph is unchanged.  Moderate cardiomegaly
with moderate pulmonary edema and right pleural effusion.
Bilateral basal areas of atelectasis. No evidence of newly
occurred focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
Unchanged position
of right central venous access line.
.
TTE [**2159-11-8**]:
Severely depressed left ventricular global systolic function.
Depressed right ventricular systolic function. Bioprosthetic
aortic valve with probable paravalvular leak and moderate aortic
regurgitation. At least moderate mitral regurgitation. At least
moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Severe pulmonary
artery systolic pressure. Compared with the prior study (images
unavailable for review)) of [**2159-8-29**], an aortic bioprosthetic
paravalvular leak with moderate aortic regurgitation is now
present. The global left ventricular ejection fraction has
decreased from 30-35% to 15%. The severity of mitral and
tricuspid regurgitation has increased. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure has decreased quanititatively (from 69 mmHg to
58 mmHg), but in the setting of moderate to severe tricuspid
regurgitation the severity of pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension may, in fact, be underestimated on the current
study
.
NCHCT [**2159-11-9**]:
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Age-related diffuse cerebral atrophy.
3. Evidence of atheromatous disease demonstrated by
cerebrovascular
calcifications and white matter gliosis due to small vessel
ischemic disease.
.
MRI Head [**2159-11-11**]
There is no evidence of acute ischemic changes. Few foci of
magnetic susceptibility are noted on the mid brain, left
cerebellar hemisphere and right occipital lobe, likely
consistent with microbleeds.Prominent ventricles and sulci are
identified, likely age related and involutional in nature versus
cortical volume loss.
Scattered areas of high signal intensity are noted in the
subcortical and periventricular white matter, representing
chronic microvascular ischemic changes.
.
Abdominal US [**2159-11-13**]:
FINDINGS: Technically challenging study due to poor acoustic
window. The liver is normal in echogenicity and echotexture. No
focal liver lesion identified. There is no intra- or
extra-hepatic duct dilation. The common duct measures 5 mm.
There is normal flow within the portal vein in a hepatopetal
direction. The patient is status post cholecystectomy. The
spleen is normal in appearance measuring 7 cm. Both kidneys are
normal in size and echogenicity. The right kidney measures 11.2
cm. The left kidney is 10.5 cm. No evidence of hydronephrosis,
stone, or renal lesion. The pancreas is not visualized. There is
no ascites.
IMPRESSION: Technically challenging study due to limited
acoustic window. The pancreas is not visualized. The remainder
of the study is normal.
