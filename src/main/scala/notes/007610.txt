Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 5314**] is a 75 yo male with h/o CHF and CAD s/p CABG who
presented to presented on [**10-4**] to [**Hospital3 3583**] with a
complaint of chest pain and shortness of breath. Patient is
intubated at time of transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], and history was obtained
almost entirely from discharge summary.
.
At time of admission to [**Hospital3 3583**], he described sudden
onset of sharp left-sided chest pain, with onset at rest. On
arrival to the ED, he reported shortness of breat and was found
to have SpO2 84% on room air. He was placed on a nonrebreather
and was subsequently intubated in the ED for respiratory
failure. The patient was treated with lasix and responded with
good UOP and improvement of his respiratory status. ABG
performed 90 minutes after intubation was 7.18/72/86.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 5314**] was subseqnetly admitted to the CCC at [**Hospital1 3325**] where he was started on standing IV lasix, Nitro paste
1" q8h, an insulin drip and Propofol for sedation.
Anti-hypertensives were held, but he was continued on ASA,
Plavix, and Lipitor. Patient was felt to be septic due to an
episode of hypotension with a fever to 101 and a leukocytosis of
17.9K. Patient was reported to be maintaining BP's of 100/60
with Vasopressin, Levophed, and IVF boluses.
.
He underwent an TTE which showed mid to distal hypokinetic areas
of the LV and a hypokinetic apex, moderate MR, and an EF of
15-20%, which is notably diminished from an EF of 40-60% two
weeks prior. Of note, patient was admitted to [**Hospital3 3583**]
from [**Date range (1) 5316**] with a similar presentation; at that time elevated
troponins were felt to be related to his renal insufficiency.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
ROS is notable for recent fever. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for patient motioning to
the presence of epigastric pain at time of arrival to [**Hospital1 18**]
(symptoms of indigestion previously noted to be his anginal
equivalent). ROS is notable for the absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope
Hospital, he had been complaining of shortness of breath over
the days prior to admission.

memory and attention

had an MI in his 40's.

PERTINENT LABS/STUDIES:
ECHO ([**10-5**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %) with global
hypokinesis and inferior akinesis. There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis
(area 1.0-1.2cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**2-14**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CXR ([**10-6**]): There is increased pulmonary vasculature and
interstitial opacities consistent with fluid overload,
unchanged. A retrocardiac opacity is again identified and likely
represents atelectasis. An ET tube is identified approximately
5.4 cm above the carina.
.
Cardiac Cath ([**10-8**]): Three-vessel coronary artery disease.
Elevated [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular filling pressures.  Moderate systemic
arterial hypertension.
.
CXR ([**10-11**]): The appearance of the thorax is essentially
unchanged, including the position of the ICD leads. The degree
of cardiomegaly, mild interstitial edema as well as bilateral
small pleural effusions are unchanged.  There is no
pneumothorax.
