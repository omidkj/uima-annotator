REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Evaluate for infiltrate/edema
FRONTAL CHEST

COMPARISON: [**2199-10-1**].

FINDINGS: Again seen is a stable enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette. The degree of interstitial pulmonary edema has not
significantly changed in the interval. Again seen are [**Year (4 digits) **]
small pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: No significant change in the appearance of the chest
from prior examination. Cardiomegaly with mild interstitial
edema.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2199-10-29**] 3:15 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: interval improvement

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
65 year old woman with COPD and acute onset sob with wheezing
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
interval improvement
HISTORY: COPD with acute onset of shortness of breath and
wheezing.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**10-28**], there is again
substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with mild
fullness of pulmonary vessels consistent with some increased
pulmonary venous pressure. No evidence of acute pneumonia,
pleural effusion, or atelectatic change.

IMPRESSION: No significant interval change.


Brief Hospital Course:
Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Was felt likely to be due to
another COPD flare with a possible underlying pneumonia given
her subjective chills at home, fevers, and increased WBC. She
was begun on continuous BIPAP, initially 16/8. She was initially
treated IV steroids, frequent nebulizers and cetriaxone and
azithromycin. Her ABG improved overnight on the day of her
admission with the BIPAP to her baseline of 7.4/63/38 which was
then maintained the next day on her home O2 regimen. She also
had some signs of mild fluid overload with mild pulmonary edema
on CXR and lower extremity edema, she received few doses of IV
lasix to assist in mild diureses with good effect as well. Her
BNP was 627 on admission making flagrant CHF much less likely.
He fluid overload was possibly due to some level of diastolic
dysfunciton as her recent EF was >75%. On HD 3 her steroids were
tapered to 40mg PO daily and her antibiotic coverage was
decreased to Azithromycin alone given no radiologic evidence of
acute pneumonia. She was restarted on her home COPD regimen and
maintained on her home 02 of 2L NC with a goal O2 sat between
88-92%. Furthermore, LENIS were checked for a low suspicion of a
PE and they were negative.   She was sating in the mid 90s on 2
L NC upon discharge and was on all of her home medications at
her home doses.  Her hypercarbic respiratory failure resolved as
her PCO2 returned to her baseline as she is likely a CO2
retainer at baseline.

Hypertension: On admission her blood pressure did not require
the administration of her antihypertensive medications. As her
blood pressure rose, they were slowly titrated back on, starting
with her Norvasc 10mg PO daily and a half dose of her lisinopril
(20mg PO daily) and her home dose of lasix at 20mg PO daily.
These will need to be added back on as needed.

Depression, scizophrenia: Her home doses of prozac, risperdal
and trazadone were continued once she was taking POs with good
effect.
