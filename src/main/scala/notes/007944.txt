Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2880**]
Chief Complaint:
Fatgue, dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
85 yo F with hx of HTN, CHF, PPM for 2 degree AV block, presents
with increasing fatigue. The patient's family reports that she
has been sleeping 5-7 hours per night, rather than her usual
three. The patient herself reports that she has been sleepy much
more often than usual. The patient's sone reports that her
appetite has been dwindling over the past few weeks as well. The
patient's son also think she may have had a temperature, but
there is no objective data for a fever. The patient has been
having difficulty breathing as well, especially when she lies
flat. She has been sleeping sitting up intermittently over the
last few weeks. The patient denies any chest pain or
palpitations. She further reports some cough. She denies any
nausea, vomiting, or GI symptoms.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 98.2, HR 84, BP 124/62, RR 22,
O2Sat 95% on 2L. EKG reportedly unchanged from prior; patient in
sinus rhythm. Supplemental oxygen was removed and patient had a
desat to 84% on RA. After 2L NC applied her O2Sat was in the
mid-90s though again had a desat to the 80s when lying flat. CXR
showing pulmonary edema. BNP elevated to 5053. 18g IV placed and
patient given 40 mg IV furosemide. Vitals on transfer were: HR
84 28 114/52 97% 2L NC.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient was comfortable in bed. The
patient is profoundly deaf and required handwritten notes as
part of interview.

[**5-22**] CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2-5**] through
[**2133-5-21**]: Pulmonary vascular congestion and mild
interstitial edema has improved since [**5-20**]. Uniform
opacification of the right lower lung is probably atelectasis.
Mild cardiomegaly is chronic. Small bilateral pleural effusions
are unchanged. Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular
pacer leads are in standard placements.
.
[**5-20**] CXR: IMPRESSION:
1. Mild congestive heart failure superimposed on severe chronic
obstructive airway disease.
2. No evidence of pneumonia.
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM: [**2133-5-21**]
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There is a severe resting left ventricular outflow tract
obstruction. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
descending thoracic aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve
leaflets. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the
eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be
significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is borderline
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a very small
pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH. During systole mitral valve and
chordae are pulled towards the hypertrophied upper septum and a
severe LVOT obstruction develops. At least moderate, posteriorly
directed mitral regurgitation. Very small pericardial effusion
without evidence of tamponade.
.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2133-2-6**], the LVOT gradient has increased
significantly. LV systolic function is not quite hyperdynamic on
the current study. The estimated pulmonary artery pressures are
lower. Pericardial fluid amount is probably similar.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 85-year-old woman who presented with loss of
appetite, lethargy, dyspnea.
.
# PUMP: On presentation, the patient appeared to be having an
exacerbation of her diastolic CHF, based on her physical exam
and the imaging taken in the emergency department. The patient
reports she is compliant with her medications, but she has a
complicated home life that may make compliance difficult. She
may have had a dietary indiscretion (unlikely given reports of
her diminished appetite) or a worse
