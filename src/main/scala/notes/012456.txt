Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11040**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
71 yo F with h/o CAD, A. Fib, COPD, recent diagnosis of
hepatocellular carcinoma presents with one day of worsening
shortness of breath.  She reports that within the last week, she
developed productive cough and shortness of breath which
worsened so that she was feeling short of breath at rest this
morning and albuterol nebs, combivent MDI were not providing any
relief.  She was seen at [**Company 191**] on [**2130-2-3**] and her steroids were
increased to 20mg daily and she was started on azithromycin, but
she says this did not provide any relief either.  She denies
subjective fevers with her worsening respiratory status, but
says she transiently had low grade fevers on Wednesday [**2130-2-1**] in
the setting of diarrhea which has since resolved.  She denies
chest pain/palpitations. She does report chronic low right
lateral rib pain in the setting of her hepatic malignancy.
.
[**2130-2-1**] PFTs reveal FEV1 of 1.05 (66% predicted) and FEV1/FVC of
99% predicted.  DLCO was reduced at 54% predicted.
.
In the ED, vitals were T 98.4 HR 82 BP 127/99 RR 22 O2 sat 100%
by written documentation although by verbal report O2 sats were
in the low 90s and she was diffusely wheezy on exam.  CXR did
not reveal e/o CHF nor infiltrates and CT chest did not show
consolidation.  She had a CT head for her headache in the
setting of known malignancy which has not yet been read.  CT
abdomen showed liver mass causing mass effect on IVC, but no
evidence of IVC thrombosis.  It also showed diverticulosis/no
diverticulitis. CTA chest showed second order left lower lobe PE
of doubtful clinical significance.  She has been requiring
continuous nebs and, thus, was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
continued respiratory care.
.
ROS:  She has had Left occipital to left frontal headache x
2days.  She has blurry vision in left eye at baseline [**3-3**] ?
cataracts.  She denies numbness/tingling/weakness.  She had
diarrhea upon return from a recent cruise, but C. diff and stool
studies were negative.  She has not had diarrhea x several days.
 She denies melena/hematochezia.  No dysuria/hematuria.  She
reports poor UOP x 2 days and decreased PO food and fluid [**3-3**]
poor appetite.  She feels thirsty currently.

Pertinent Results:
[**9-/2129**] Echo:  LVEF 70%, but LV cavity size small.  RV function
appears depressed with dilated RV cavity and hypertrophied free
wall.  2+ TR. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
.
[**2130-2-5**] EKG:  A. Fib 82 bpm, no acute ST, T wave changes.
.
[**2130-2-5**] CXR:
There is unchanged cardiomegaly.  There is tortuosity of the
thoracic aorta. Median sternotomy wires are seen.  Lungs are
clear without focal infiltrates, pleural effusions, or signs of
pulmonary edema.
.
[**2130-2-5**] CTA chest/abdomen:
1.  Second order PE in the left lower lobe.
2.  Somewhat limited comparison of liver masses due to
difference in modality but approximate stability of largest
mass.
3.  Liver mass causes mass effect on IVC, but no evidence of IVC
thrombosis.  Severe atherosclerotic disease involving coronary
arteries, great vessels, abdominal aorta, and major tributaries.
 Focal aneurysmatic dilatation of the mid abdominal aorta.
4.  Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
5.  Severe degenerative changes involving the bony structures.

predicted.  DLCO was reduced at 54% predicted.

Brief Hospital Course:
71 yo F with h/o CAD, A. fib, COPD, hepatocellular carcinoma
admitted for shortness of breath requiring continuous nebulizer
treatments.
.
# Shortness of breath/COPD exacerbation:  Her shortness of
breath was attributed to COPD exacerbation as she remained
diffusely bronchospastic on exam.  In the ED she was requiring
continuous nebulizers and was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
further management.  Although she was recently diagnosed with
PE, CTA chest upon admission did not reveal propagation, but
rather showed stable second order chronic PE in the left lower
lobe and this was thought unlikely to be contributing to her
symptoms.  Additionally, there were no infiltrates on CXR nor CT
chest.  She was originally continued on azithromycin which had
been started prior to admission, but when respiratory status
worsened requiring intubation, she was started on zosyn and
vancomycin.  She was started on IV solumedrol and tolerated
successful extubation.
.
# Hepatocellular carcinoma: This was recently diagnosed.  AFP on
[**2130-1-20**] was found to be [**Numeric Identifier 110679**] and on [**2129-2-3**] was [**Numeric Identifier 110680**].
Recent CT abdomen showed liver mass causing mass effect on IVC,
but no evidence of IVC thrombosis.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of
hem/onc and in discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], patient, and family,
given the rapid progression of her disease, it was established
that there were few therapeutic options.  Thus, family decided
on change in code status to DNR/DNI and then to CMO.
.
# CAD: s/p MI and CABG in [**2115**].  Cardiac enzymes originally
revealed MB index slightly elevated at 6.5 and troponin also up
at 0.05, but with full cycling, troponin decreased to 0.02 and
index was no longer significant.  EKG did not reveal any
ischemic changes and she denied any symptoms of chest pain.  She
was continued on aspirin, BB was restarted when blood pressure
could tolerate and statin was held in the setting of her hepatic
malignancy.
.
# A. Fib:  She remained in a. fib during her stay requiring beta
blockade and then initiation of diltiazem with improved rate
control.
.
# CHF:  Although BNP was elevated to 8340, she had no evidence
of fluid overload on exam nor on CXR.  - holding lasix,
spironolactone, ACEI, and beta blocker in the setting of
currenct hypotension.
.
# HTN:  She remained hypotensive compared to her baseline and
appeared dry on exam.  Thus her diuretics were held as was her
BB transiently.
.
# ARF:  Creatinine elevated to 1.2 from baseline 0.7-0.9.
Resolved with IV hydration and likely represented prerenal
etiology given her dry appearance on exam and response to
hydration.
.
# RA:  She was continued on steroids, plaquenil, and
methotrexate and oxycodone for breakthrough pain.
.
# Depression:  She was continued on her outpatient medication
regimen.
.
# Pulmonary embolism: h/o PE s/p IVC filter placement.  INR was
4.5 in the ED on 3mg daily coumadin dose.  CT
