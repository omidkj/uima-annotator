Chief Complaint:
Allergic reaction.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Nasotracheal Intubation


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 71 year old woman with a history of hypertension
and diabetes who recently presented with bronchitis and now
presents with tounge swelling after a dose of azithromycin. She
initially complained 11 days of cough which was productive for
about 5 days. She denied any fevers, chills, nausea or vomiting.
She presented to her PCP on the day of admission and was
prescribed azithromycin. Around 3pm, she took the first dose of
azithromycin and by about 4pm, she noticed a tingling sensation
in her tongue. At 5pm, the left side of her tongue became
swollen. She was concerned that her throat might close off so
she presented to the ED.
.
In the ED, ENT was consulted and a fiberoptic intubation was
performed given the rapidity of her airway compromise. She was
given 0.3mg 1:1000 epinephrine sc, afrin, bendaryl 50mg iv,
solumedrol 125mg iv, and was sedated with propafol.
.
She was monitored overnight in the ED and initially staffed with
west ICU team, but a bed became avaliable in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  ENT
suggested following cuff-leak throughout intubation and possible
allergy consult.  On arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], nursing noted some
decreased breath sounds on the left side.  She had a temp of 94,
was placed on warming blanket.

============
STUDIES:
CXR [**2137-2-26**]
INDICATION: Intubation.
An endotracheal tube has been placed, terminating at
approximately the thoracic inlet level. The lung volumes are
quite low accentuating the cardiac silhouette and
bronchovascular structures. There is a patchy area of opacity in
the right retrocardiac region which likely reflects atelectasis,
although aspiration is an additional consideration. The
remainder of the lungs are grossly clear.
.
CXR [**2137-2-26**]
Lungs are clear. Heart size normal. No pleural abnormality or
evidence of central adenopathy. Right heart border is obscured
by mediastinal fat, as before. The thoracic aorta is very
tortuous and moderately calcified but not definitely aneurysmal.
.
CXR [**2137-2-27**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Endotracheal tube in appropriate position with tip
approximately 6 cm above the carina.
2. Bilateral right and left retrocardiac opacities, which may
represent atelectasis or aspiration.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
71 year old woman with obesity, diabetes, hypertension who
presents with tongue swelling after taking a dose of
azithromycin for bronchitis as well as cough syrup containing
codeine.
.
# Angioedema: As described in the HPI, ENT was consulted and
performed a fiberoptic nasal intubation in the ED and pt was
sent to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  Her reaction was thought to be due to either
the azithromycin or the codeine but it was heard the tell as she
took both at the same time.  There was a question of whether the
ACE-I was the culprit as it can cause angioedema at any time.
All three of these medications are now listed as allergies.  She
was treated initially with decadron, benadryl, and zantac.  Her
tongue swelling slowly improved and she was extubated on
hospital day #2.  Fiberoptic scope by ENT the next day revealed
persistent laryngeal edema, mild erythema of nasal pharynx,
moderate supraglottis edema, fair glottic airway but the
following day this had all improved.  She will follow up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2603**] as an outpatient.  She will continue the benedryl and
zantac for 5 days and begin a prednisone taper over 7 days. She
was given a prescription for an epi-pen.
.
# Hypertension: The pt's HCTZ and ACE-I were initially held
given her sedation.  Once she was extubated, her HCTZ was
restarted.  As above, pt's ACE-I was not restarted given concern
for the possible etiology of her angioedema.
.
# Bronchitis/Sinusitis: Pt remained afebrile but was noted to
have excessive nasal secretions on fiberoptic exam by ENT.  She
was started on a course of levofloxacin on [**3-1**].  Levofloxacin
was started as it was hoped to be the least allergenic of
potential antibiotics.  She will continue this for a 10-day
course.
.
# Diabetes: Metformin was restarted once pt started eating.
.
# Dispo: PT evaluated the patient and recommended rehab and pt
was agreeable.
.
# Code: Full.
