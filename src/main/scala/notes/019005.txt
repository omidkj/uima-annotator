ABDOMEN U.S. (COMPLETE STUDY) PORT  [**2156-9-1**] 1:09 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
2. Gallbladder sludge. Mild gallbladder wall edema, likely
caused by third spacing.
3. Somewhat heterogeneous pancreatic parenchyma. No focal
lesions seen.
.
[**2156-9-2**] ERCP
The pancreatic duct was partially filled with contrast and
visualized in the head of the pancreas. This was normal..
Procedures: A 7 cm by 10 fr Cotton-[**Doctor Last Name **] pancreatic stent was
placed successfully using a Oasis system stent introducer kit.

Impression: Normal biliary tree - a biliary stent was
emperically placed.
Normal limited pancreatogram.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2156-9-9**] 9:07 AM
IMPRESSION:

1. No acute intracranial pathology.

2. There is either mucosal thickening or an air-fluid level in
the left pterygoid recess of the sphenoid sinus and
opacification of some of the left mastoid air cells. This may be
secondary to intubation or a coexistent inflammatory process.
.

MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST  [**2156-9-12**] 7:41 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Technically limited MRI brain without evidence of hemorrhage,
edema, or infarction.

2. Irregularity within basilar artery may represent atheromatous
disease or artifact. Recommend repeat imaging for further
evaluation.
.

MR CERVICAL SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2156-9-12**] 7:41 PM
FINDINGS: The images are markedly limited due to motion.
Vertebral body alignment is satisfactory at all levels. Due to
motion artifact, the neural foramina are poorly seen at most
levels.
At C2-3, there is a small central disc protrusion without
evidence of canal narrowing.
At C3-4, there is a small posterior osteophyte, which causes
moderate encroachment on the thecal sac and raises the suspicion
for cord compression.
At C4-5, there is small osteophyte producing spinal canal
narrowing.
At C5-6, there is a small osteophyte without evidence of spinal
cord compression.
At C6-7 and C7-T1, there is no evidence of spinal canal
narrowing.
Hyperintesity on T1 and T2 weighted images in vertebral bodies
at C3 and C5 likely represent marrow fat due to [**Last Name (un) 13425**] II
degenerative change. Hyperintensity on T1, T2 and STIR images at
C7 likley represents a hemangioma.

IMPRESSION:
1. Technically limited exam due to marked patient motion.

2. There are multilevel degenerative changes and canal
narrowing, with possible cord compression at C3-4. Repeat
scanning can be obtained for further evaluation if clinically
indicated.
.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2156-9-14**] 7:50 PM

FINDINGS: The conventional brain images show no evidence for an
intracranial mass, hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline
structures, visible minor or major vascular territorial
infarction. The diffusion-weighted images are normal. The
principal vascular flow patterns are identified. There is
redemonstration of prominent mucosal thickening and/or fluid
within both mastoid sinus complexes, which could represent an
allergic or some other type of inflammatory process. Of probable
similar etiology is high T2 signal within the left pterygoid
recess of the sphenoid sinus.
CONCLUSION: Normal brain MRI scan aside from extensive bilateral
mastoid sinus signal abnormalities, possibly representing an
allergic or some other type of inflammatory process.
MR ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **] AND ITS TRIBUTARIES
TECHNIQUE: Three-dimensional time-of-flight imaging with
multiplanar reconstructions.
FINDINGS: There are two areas of irregularity of the
supraclinoid portion of the left internal carotid artery, which
on the projected images appear to be possible aneurysms,
measuring a few millimeters in diameter. However, when the
source images are reviewed, I believe these findings represent
origins of the normal anterior choroidal artery and posterior
communicating artery, which are extremely diminutive in caliber
distally, presumably representing an anatomic variant. Th
