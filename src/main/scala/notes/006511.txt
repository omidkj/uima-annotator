History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1391**] is a 55yo woman with h/o ESRD on HD and peritoneal
dialysis who presented to the ED with c/o blue fingers and was
admitted for hypotension.

She reports a 1 month history of fingers and toes turning blue.
She notes that it happens even at room temperature but that she
can prevent it if her hands are warm or in gloves.  When her
fingers are blue, she loses sensation in her hands and ends up
dropping things.

On the morning of presentation, she woke up with uncontrollable
watery diarrhea such that she could not make it to the commode.
After the episode, she tried to turn the light on but could not
feel that she was touching it.  She ended up knocking over the
lamp and the endtable and stumbling against her right knee onto
the bed.

She states that diarrhea has been a chronic problem for her over
the last 3 months such that she is having 3 BMs/day.  Last
night, she vomited after dinner and then woke up with
particularly bad watery diarrhea.  She does not notice blood in
the diarrhea but does have bright red blood when she wipes; she
thinks she has hemorrhoids.  +Dizzy and weak.  She denies knee
pain.  She had a fever to 101 on Sunday (4 days ago), which
resolved with tylenol and has not recurred.  No headache, cough,
sore throat.  +Abdominal pain.  Her dry weight is 78kg and she
has been 76-77kg at home.  Her baseline home SBP is usually in
110s but she has been running in the 80s lately and was 70/40
this morning.

In the ED, initial VS:  99.1   83/54   18   unable to get pulse
ox, unable to get HR->88.  Lowest recorded BP was 66/36.  A left
femoral catheter was placed and her peritoneal fluid was sent
for culture.   She was given a total of 1L of NS with
improvement of BP to 110/58.  She received vancomycin and zosyn
while in the ED because of concern for sepsis.

Upon arrival to the MICU, she c/o left shoulder pain and right
hip pain, which are chronic for her.
