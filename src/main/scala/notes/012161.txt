Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 19836**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain, decrease in hematocrit

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endoscopy with variceal banding x4
colonoscopy

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 72 yo female with history of chronic GI bleeding, CAD
s/p CABG, CHF w/EF 35%, diabetes, chronic renal failure, and
cryptogenic cirrhosis admitted to the medical servce after
presenting to the ED with chest pain and a low hematocrit.
.
She states that she began having episodes of chest pain
frequently today. Usually she gets chest pains with a low
hematocrit. She has chronic blood loss anemia as well as anemia
of chronic disease, and has her Hct monitored closely. Her HCt
on the day of admission was 26. She was also having
marroon-colored stools. All this, along with her ongoing chest
pains brought her to the ED.
.
In the ED her VS were 96.9 58 121/69 18 97%RA. She was noted to
have guaiac positive marroon stool. GI was consulted and
recommended NPO> MNm, IV protonix and transfusion. She received
2 Units PRBCS and 40mg IV protonix. She had multiple episodes of
chest pains which were relieved with NTG. She had EKGs that were
unchanged from baseline studies.

Physical Exam:
VS: 97.8 120/54 61 95%RA
GEN: Chronically ill-appearing, NAD
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, PERRL, EOMI, OP clear, MMM
NECK: Supple, no LAD
CV: regular with occasional premature beats. 2/6 SEM at USBs, no
G/R
PULM: crackles @ lungs bialterally
ABD: Soft, NT, ND, +BS
EXT: No C/C/E. 2+ distal pulses


Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
CXR ([**9-25**])
There is no significant interval change. The lungs remain clear.
There is no effusion, pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, again noted mild
cardiomegaly. Post-sternotomy changes are noted.  IMPRESSION: No
significant interval change. No acute cardiopulmonary process.

Abdominal U/S with Doppler ([**9-24**])
The liver demonstrates normal echogenicity and texture without
focal hepatic lesions or masses. The CBD measures up to 5.5 mm.
There is cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
There is no free fluid; however, the spleen is enlarged
measuring 18 cm. The portal vein is patent with hepatopetal
flow, however, the splenic venous and superior mesenteric vein
confluence is dilated measuring up to 2.2 cm. Findings
suggestive of portal hypertension.  Doppler evaluation
demonstrates normal hepatopetal flow in main, right and left
portal veins. The systemic vasculature including middle hepatic,
right and left hepatic veins is patent with normal venous
waveform. The main hepatic artery commensurate normal systolic
and diastolic flow.  IMPRESSION: 1.Normal hepatic portal venous
and arterial vasculature.  2.Cholelithiasis with cholecystitis.
3.Prominent portal confluence and splenomegaly suggestive of
portal hypertension. No ascites.

EGD ([**9-24**]):
Impression: Varices at the lower third of the esophagus
(ligation)
Granularity and mosaic appearance in the whole stomach
compatible with portal hypertensive gastropathy
Polyps in the antrum
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum

Sigmoidoscopy ([**9-24**]):
Impression: Grade 2 internal & external hemorrhoids
There was solid black stool in the rectum which precluded
advancement of the scope. Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to
rectum

ECG ([**9-24**])
Sinus rhythm. Left axis deviation. Non-specific intraventricular
conduction delay. There is an abnormal precordial transition
with anterior Q waves consistent with possible prior myocardial
infarction. There are tiny R waves in the inferior leads
consistent with possible prior inferior myocardial infarction.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2145-9-23**] there is no significant change.

Colonoscopy ([**9-30**])
Impression: Grade 3 internal & external hemorrhoids.
At least 2 cords of moderate size and branching rectal varices
without signs of active bleeding. Otherwise normal colon up to
the cecum.

Brief Hospital Course:
72yo female with CAD s/p CABG, CHF (EF 35%), AAA s/p repair, PVD
s/p multiple bypasses, cryptogenic cirrhosis (likely [**2-27**] NASH)
w/ grade II esophageal varices, portal gastropathy, and gastric
angioectasias, peptic ulcer disease, and h/o lower GI bleeding
[**2-27**] AVMs and diverticulosis, who presented to the hospital w/
chest pain and anemia. Seen by hepatology w/ EGD showing
esophageal varices s/p banding x4, on Octeotride gtt, IV PPI
[**Hospital1 **], and CTX IV daily. Transferred to the ICU with continued
melanotic stools and orthostatic hypotension for closer
monitoring in preparation for scope. Returned to medical floor
on [**9-29**], kept NPO for colonoscopy. Colonoscopy showed colonic and
rectal varices, internal and external hemorrhoids. Stable
hemodynamically, stable hematocrit at discharge.
.
1.  Anemia: Hct lower than baseline on admission, found to be
low by VNA services.  After transfusion of 2 units patient's Hct
went up to 27.7. Etiology most likely secondary to patient's
chronic GI bleeds and anemia of chronic disease. Continued to
transfuse to keep Hct >25. Hct stable [**Date range (1)
