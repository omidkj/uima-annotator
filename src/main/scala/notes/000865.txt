Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**3-26**] with c/o chest tightness
and shortness of breath.  Her cardiac catheterization showed a
normal ejection fraction and significant 2 vessel disease.  She
was taken to the operating room on [**3-29**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**3-29**]
for CABGx2.  She tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred to the ICU in stable condition.  She was weaned and
extubated from mechanical ventilation without difficulty and
transferred to the regular floor on POD#2.  On POD#2 she
required PRBC transfusion and had several episodes of atrial
fibrillation.  She was started on amiodarone and began to
develop periods of bradycardia.  On the morning of POD#5 she
developed HTN, SOB and rales.  She was treated with diuretics
and IV nitroglycerine and the decision was made to transfer her
to the ICU for close monitoring.  Her EKG was without ischemic
changes, and echocardiogram did not show any wall motion
abnormality or pericardial effusion.  Her symptoms of heart
failure resolved with continued diuresis and she was transferred
back to the regular floor.  Her beta blockers were discontinued
due to her bradycardia, however she continued to have episodes
of atrial fibrillation.  On POD#10 an electrophysiology consult
was obtained due to continues episodes of rapid atrial
fibrillation and it was recommended to decrease her dose of
amiodarone and restart a low dose of atenolol.  She was started
on Coumadin for anticoagulation, and by POD#14, her INR was 2.1
and she was cleared for discharge to home.
