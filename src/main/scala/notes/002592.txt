[**2107-7-22**] Right suboccipital crani for mass


History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname **] is 85 y/o female this morning in her apartment after
returning to the bathroom. She states she became suddenly dizzy
and fell. She was able to bring herself to her couch and call
her daughter who called EMS. She was transported to [**Hospital3 80253**] with a main complaint of left hip pain. As
part of her dizziness work up she was found to have right
cerebellar mass on CT. An initial hip xray did not see a
fracture the patient is exquistely tender so a further work up
is being completed at this writing of her hip. Ms [**Known lastname **] reports
3 months of dizziness with intermittent falls. She was recently
referred to a neurologist but has not been seen as of yet. She
states she has occasional headache but not more than usual. She
denies any visual problems.

LABS ON DISCHARGE:

------------------
IMAGING:
------------------
CT HEAD [**7-20**]:
1. Right cerebellar vasogenic edema concerning for underlying
cerebellar
mass. 1 cm right cerebellar rounded focus is concerning for
mass/satelitte
lesion. An additional mass underlying the region of edema
remains a
possibility. MRI recommended for further evaluation.
2. Some mass effect on the fourth ventricle which remains
patent. Prominence
of the lateral ventricles and third ventricle is thought to be
due to
generalized atrophy however developing hydrocephalus cannot be
entirely
excluded.
3. Opacification of the left mastoid air cells with minimal
opacification of the right mastoids air cells. Correlate
clinical for mastoiditis or other regional inflammatory process.


MRI HEAD [**7-21**]:
1. 18 x 16 mm single right cerebellar mass, with neighboring
edema and no
significant local mass effect. No other masses are detected.
2. Diffuse cortical atrophy and changes secondary to
microvascular ischemic disease.

CT TORSO [**7-21**]:
1. Right peri-hilar mass, measuring 1.8 x 1.9 x 2.1 cm. In the
setting of
cerebellar lesion, this is concerning for primary lung neoplasm.

2. Emphysema.
3. Cholelithiasis.
4. Diverticulosis.
5. Aortic atherosclerosis.
6. Fat-containing umbilical hernia.
7. Pagetoid changes in the left hip.
8. Known non-displaced left superior and inferior pubic rami
fractures,
better characterized on study performed one day prior with
dedicated bone
windows through the pelvis.

CT HEAD [**7-22**]
1. Status post right suboccipital craniotomy and resection of
mass with
expected post-surgical pneumocephalus. Tiny amount of linear
hyperdensity
along the craniotomy site, likely post-surgical blood products.
No large
intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Residual vasogenic edema in the right cerebellar hemisphere
with unchanged mass effect on the fourth ventricle. No change in
the size of the lateral and third ventricles compared to the
prior study.

MRI HEAD [**7-23**]
Status post resection of right cerebellar lesion with mild
residual enhancement at the anterior margin. Blood products and
expected
post-surgical changes. No significant change in mass effect or
new infarct
seen. No hydrocephalus.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 85F admitted to the neurosurgery service following
transfer from OSH in the setting of new cerebellar mass. At the
time of presentation, her physical examination was such that
admission to "floor" status was appropriate with q4h neurologic
examination. She was also administered steroids to treat
vasogenic edema. MRI of the head was obtained and showed 18 x 16
mm right cerebellar mass. CT of the torso showed 1.8 x 1.9 x 2.1
cm right perihilar mass, abutting the bronchus intermedius. We
contact[**Name (NI) **] hematology/oncology ([**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], MD) they
would not see the patient without the result from pathology,
they recommended calling the thoracic clinic on discharge once
final pathology is back. On [**7-22**] she underwent a suboccipital
craniotomy for without complication, she was monitored for 24
hour in the ICU and transferred to the floor. Her diet was
advanced, she was voiding without difficulty. She remained
pleasently confused/disorientated but was intact otherwise. PT
recommended rehab. Her steroid dosing will be weaned to 2mg [**Hospital1 **]
and her L hip fracture requires no surgical intervention, she
can TDWB. She was accepted to rehab on the morning of [**7-28**] and
was discharged on teh same day
