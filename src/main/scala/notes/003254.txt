HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 82 year old
man with end stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis with
a history of coronary artery disease, who presented with
worsening shortness of breath.  The patient was in his usual
state of health until a few days prior to admission when he
began to experience worsening shortness of breath, more than
his baseline.  He had experienced paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea for some time but more frequently and progressively
worse.  At 4:00 a.m. the morning of admission, he awoke with
extreme shortness of breath which improved when he sat up.
He also reported dyspnea on exertion and occasional chest
discomfort with exertion over the six months prior to
admission, much worse over the week prior to admission.  He
reports that his chest pain improved with rest.  The patient
denied diaphoresis, nausea and vomiting.  He reported that he
could only walk down a [**Doctor Last Name **] until he experienced shortness of
breath and needed to rest.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty to the D1 and right
coronary artery.
2.  End stage renal disease secondary to focal segmental
glomerulosclerosis.  The patient has been on chronic
ambulatory peritoneal dialysis for two and one half years and
has had two episodes of supraventricular tachycardia.
3.  Chronic leukocytosis.
4.  History of pulmonary embolus.
5.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
6.  Hypertension.
7.  Hypercholesterolemia.
8.  Congestive heart failure.
9.  Gout.
10. Status post total hip replacement.
11. Status post right knee replacement.
12. Prostate cancer.
13. Status post cataract surgery.
14. History of adenomatous polyps.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.o.d.
2.  PhosLo 2 mg p.o. three times a day.
3.  Renagel 1500 mg p.o. three times a day.
4.  Simvastatin 40 mg p.o. once daily.
5.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. once daily.
6.  Lactulose 15 to 30 mg p.o. three times a day.
7.  Metoprolol 2.5 mg p.o. once daily.

ALLERGIES:  Motrin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient quit smoking fifty years ago.
He denies alcohol use.  His primary cardiologist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 121**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs revealed temperature 96.3,
heart rate 89, blood pressure 134/72, oxygen saturation 99%
on two liters, weight 200 pounds.  Cardiovascular - The
patient had distant heart sounds with a regular S1 and S2 and
faint S3.  Pulmonary - He had faint bibasilar crackles.
Abdomen was obese, distended to percussion and nontender to
palpation.  Extremities showed no edema, palpable posterior
tibial pulses and no femoral bruit.  Neurologic examination
was intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count was
14.7.  Potassium 3.3.  Blood urea nitrogen 33, creatinine
10.9.  Liver function tests were normal.  Digoxin level 0.88.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted and initially was
believed to rule in for myocardial infarction with a troponin
of 5.0.  Maximal CK was 157 with a MG of 13 and a positive MB
index of 9.1.  The patient was subsequently taken for cardiac
catheterization where coronary angiography of the right
dominant circulation revealed branch vessel coronary artery
disease.  Left main coronary artery had no significant
stenoses. The left anterior descending had mild luminal
irregularities.  D1 totally occluded distally at the site of
prior stenting.  D2 no lesions.  Left circumflex had mild
luminal irregularities.  Three OM branches free of disease.
The right coronary artery was widely patent at the sites of
prior stenting and otherwise free of significant stenoses.
The right coronary artery supplied the posterior descending
artery and PLV.  Resting hemodynamics were measured at
baseline and revealed a markedly impaired cardiac output of
3.6 liters per minute and a moderately elevated left
ventricular filling pressures with a left ventricular end
diastolic pressure of 25 mmHg.  At rest, the gradient across
the aortic valve was 21 mmHg with a calculated valve area of
0.97 square centimeters.  Dobutamine was infused up to 10
mcg/kg/minute.  The patient's systolic blood pressure fell to
a level of 70 mmHg.  During this time, the patient's cardiac
output rose to 5.9 liters per minute.  Aortic valve
calculations revealed peak gradient of 34 mmHg and a valve
area of 1.02 square centimeters.  The patient was then
started on Dopamine with no effect on the systemic arterial
pressure.  For this reason, an intra-aortic balloon pump was
inserted with subsequent return of blood pressure to baseline
and a cardiac output of 7.1 liters per minute.

The patient was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit where he
was weaned off the balloon pump and Dopamine without
difficulty.  Electrophysiology service was consulted and
evaluated the patient for biventricular pacemaker which was
placed in addition to an ICD.  The patient's symptoms of
shortness of breath improved markedly after the biventricular
pacer placement.  He was transferred to the Cardiac Medicine
floor for an additional day of monitoring.  He had one
episode of systolic blood pressure in the high 70s but
otherwise was stable through the remainder of his hospital
course.

Renal - The patient was continued on his chronic ambulatory
peritoneal dialysis throughout his hospital stay.  He was
closely followed by his primary nephrologist as well as the
renal team.  The patient's persistent leukocytosis was not
felt to be a change, however, a sample of a diasolate was
sent for culture with no growth by the time of discharge.
Gram stain was negative.  Per the renal team, the patient was
instructed to continue his outpatient antihypertensive
regimen with further fine tuning of his blood pressure
through dialysis.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post biventricular pacer.
2.  Congestive heart failure.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.o.d.
2.  PhosLo 2 mg p.o. three times a day.
3.  Renagel 1500 mg p.o. three times a day.
4.  Simvastatin 40 mg p.o. once daily.
5.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. once daily.
6.  Lactulose 15 to 30 mg p.o. three times a day.
7.  Metoprolol 2.5 mg p.o. once daily.

FOLLOW-UP:  Device Clinic [**2160-1-29**], at 1:00 p.m., Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 121**] in
two weeks after discharge, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 174**] as needed.
