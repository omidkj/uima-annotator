Date of Birth:  [**2071-3-17**]        Sex:  F

Service:  VSU


CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Bilateral toe gangrene.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 70-year old female
with a complicated medical history including peripheral
vascular disease and insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes. She
has recently moved from [**State 4565**] to [**State 350**]. She
states she has had multiple surgeries and stent placements on
the lower extremities bilaterally. She does not remember the
details. She has requested further information from the
hospital in [**State 4565**] ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital **] Hospital). She was first
seen at our institution, [**Hospital1 18**], on [**2141-4-4**] for
necrotic toes. She was seen in the emergency room and
referred to the [**Hospital **] Clinic for podiatry consult. She was
then referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] for a vascular evaluation. She
is now admitted to our service for IV antibiotics and
evaluation.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive for a history of chest pain and
pressure, dyspnea on exertion (relieved with rest), history
of hemorrhoids with bright red blood per rectum, and urinary
frequency.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Includes insulin-dependent type 2
diabetes, coronary artery disease (with a history of a
myocardial infarction), a history of congestive heart failure
(compensated), seasonal allergies, history of GI bleed
secondary to hemorrhoids.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Includes a cholecystectomy, total
abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy
in [**2105**], right carpal tunnel repair, and trigger finger
surgery.

ALLERGIES:  ZOCOR and LIPITOR (cramps and joint pain), SULFA
(caused hives and angioedema), DEMEROL (caused skin
blisters), IVP DYE (caused hives and blisters), and TAPE
(caused blisters).

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Lasix 40 mg b.i.d., Mavik 4 mg
daily, omeprazole 20 mg daily, Lantus insulin 35 units at
bedtime with a Humalog insulin sliding scale.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for father dying at 79 with
prostate carcinoma, diabetes, Parkinson's, and emphysema.
Mother was 83 and died of renal failure.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She has 3 children, all living, 2 with renal
disease and 1 with hypercholesterolemia. The patient denies
tobacco or alcohol use and is independent in ADLs.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The patient is alert and
oriented. Obese. Teary eyed but pleasant. HEENT exam is
unremarkable. The lungs are clear to auscultation
bilaterally. Heart has a regular rate and rhythm with a 2/6
systolic ejection murmur at the base. Abdominal exam is
obese, nontender, nondistended. Bowel sounds are present. No
masses noted. The extremities show minimal edema with
palpable femoral's at 2+ bilaterally with dopplerable DP and
PT signals bilaterally. The left 1st toe is with gangrenous
changes, dry. The right 1st toe and 2nd toe are with
gangrenous changes, dry.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
vascular service. She was begun on vancomycin and
levofloxacin. Admitting white count was 5.4, hematocrit was
42.5, platelets were 343,000. Coag's were normal. Urinalysis
was negative. BUN was 37, creatinine was 1.5, with a K of
5.2. Liver enzymes revealed an ALT of 19, AST of 23, alkaline
phosphatase of 176, amylase of 71, total bilirubin of 0.4,
and lipase of 25. Albumin of 3.9. Cholesterol of 191.
Triglycerides of 178. Hemoglobin A1C was 8.

The patient's stress test on [**2141-5-9**] showed moderate
reversible medium-size lateral wall perfusion defect with an
ejection fraction of 68%. Foot films done on [**2141-4-4**]
demonstrated osteomyelitis of the right 1st and 2nd digits,
ulceration of the distal left 1st digit with diffusely
demineralized bone. An echocardiogram on [**2141-4-21**]
demonstrated a left atrial dilatation with mild symmetrical
left ventricular hypertrophy with an ejection fraction
calculated at 55%. The mitral valves were mildly thickened.
She had physiological mitral regurgitation with mild
pulmonary systolic hypertension. EKG was a sinus rhythm with
no acute changes.

The patient was continued on her preadmission medications.
Renal function was monitored. IV hydration was begun in
anticipation for arteriogram. Podiatry was consulted
regarding the necrotic toes and recommendations regarding
management and antibiotic therapy.

On [**2141-5-18**] the patient underwent an abdominal aortic and
pelvic vessel arteriogram with bilateral lower extremity
angiograms. The study demonstrated patent abdominal aorta,
although diffusely and mildly narrowed in the infrarenal
portion. There was single renal arteries present bilaterally.
There was mild post ostial stenosis of the left renal artery.
There was calcification along the infrarenal aorta and iliac
arteries. The right side runoff showed significant segmental
stenosis at the level of the mid to upper right superficial
femoral artery. A patent right above-the-knee popliteal stent
was noted. A focal short narrowing of the distal right below-
the-knee popliteal artery was seen. There was involvement of
the proximal right anterior tibial as well. More distally,
the anterior tibial, peroneal, and posterior tibial arteries
were patent. The right DP and plantar arteries were widely
patent, although there was noted of calcification of the
right DP artery. The left side runoff showed a short moderate
narrowing of the proximal left common iliac with segmental
disease of the left external iliac with areas of moderate
stenosis. There were 2 overlying metallic stents visualized
in the mid left superficial femoral artery with mild
restenosis. There was approximately a 5- to 6-cm length area
of significant stenosis just proximal to the stent within the
proximal left superficial femoral artery. The popliteal,
anterior tibial, peroneal, and posterior tibial arteries were
widely patent. The left DP is widely patent as well. The left
plantar arteries are small but remained patent.

Cardiology was requested to see the patient preoperatively
given her significant cardiac history. Their recommendations
were the patient was a high risk for surgery given prior
stress test, history of MI, and decompensated failure.
Recommendations were to cover her perioperatively with IV
beta blockade, starting aspirin, postoperative EKG and
enzymes, continue her H2 blockers, and monitor her hematocrit
and transfuse to maintain a hematocrit of greater than 30,
and defer the use of heparin given history of GI bleeds in
the past.

The [**Last Name (un) **] service followed the patient during her
hospitalization and managed her glycemia control. The patient
was seen by social service for emotional support given her
hospitalization and also for a reported difficult domestic
situation. The patient did require adjustments in her sliding
scale during her perioperatively period to maintain adequate
glucose control.

The patient proceeded to surgery on [**2141-5-24**] and
underwent a right femoral/dorsalis pedis bypass graft with in
situ saphenous vein. The patient had a palpable graft and
triphasic DP and PT at the end of the procedure. She was
transferred to the PACU in stable condition. Postoperatively,
she remained hemodynamically stable. Her hematocrit remained
stable at 31.3. BUN and creatinine were stable at 15 and 1.0.
Her magnesium, phosphate, and potassium were repleted. The
chest x-ray was without pneumothorax, and the line was in
appropriate position. The EKG was without ischemic changes.
The patient continued to do well and was transferred to the
VICU for continued monitoring and care.

On postoperative day 1, there were no overnight events. She
remained hemodynamically stable. Her hematocrit remained
stable. Her BUN and creatinine remained stable. The patient's
pulse exam remained unchanged. The foot showed stable dry
gangrene. The patient was begun on Percocet for analgesic
control. Her diet was advanced as tolerated. Her IV fluids
were hep-locked. She was maintained on bedrest and remained
in the VICU for continued hemodynamic monitoring.

On postoperative day 2, the patient had low urinary output
overnight with a poor response to fluid bolus
