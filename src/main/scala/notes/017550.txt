Pertinent Results:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2151-11-18**] 4:33 PM
UPRIGHT CHEST:  Compared to [**2150-12-18**] there has been little
change. Extensive fibrotic changes in the upper lobes
bilaterally and elevated hilar structures.  Multiple calcified
lymph nodes are unchanged and consistent with changes related to
sarcoid.  Increased lucency of the more inferior pulmonary
tissues demonstrates no new opacities or infiltrates.  Position
of diaphragms again may represent underlying COPD.  Calcified
bilateral breast implants appear unchanged as does a _____ right
hemiarthroplasty of the shoulder.
IMPRESSION:  Chronic changes related to sarcoid and underlying
COPD.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.

Brief Hospital Course:
70 yo with severely obstructive COPD from sarcoidosis presents
with SOB and hypercapneic respiratory failure. On admission, she
was diagnosed with a COPD exacerbation. Given a relatively
normal BNP, EF> 75% and dry status on physical exam, her lasix
was held; her lasix QOD was eventually restarted after she
became euvolemic. She was started on Solumedrol 125mg IV q6hrs,
Azithromycin and Ceftriaxone for COPD with moderate amount of
yellow/green sputum production. In addition, she was given
Ipratropium and Albuterol nebs - initially on continuous
Albuterol. She was also started on BiPap for increased
respiratory effort, tachypnea and ABG showing severe respiratory
acidosis with pH7.21 and pCO2 91. She tolerated BiPap well and
was maintained on it for the next two days with intermittent
breaks on nasal canula. Her breathing became less labored and
serial ABG's showed decreasing hypercapnia. On HD 3, she was
transitioned to nasal cannula and was able to maintain oxygen
saturations. In addition, her steroid dose was decreased to
Prednisone 60mg daily. Placing the patient on PCP prophylaxis
given her chronic steroid use was discussed but deferred in the
ICU setting.

She was transferred to the medical floor where she continued to
be stable on 2 L pm Nasal cannula, combivent nebs prn (approx q
4 hours), and 60 mg of prednisone.

Her antibiotics were transitioned to oral cefpodoxime and
azithromycin was discontinued.

She was discharged home with services and a long steroid taper
(down by 10 mg every five days)
