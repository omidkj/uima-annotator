Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Flexible sigmoidoscopy


History of Present Illness:
64 year old Male who with recently diagnosed hepatocellular
carcinoma who presented to the emergency room severe RUQ
abdominal pain. The patient states the pain started 5 weeks
prior to admission. He had a workup at [**Hospital6 34976**] and
was found to have a large right hepatic lobe mass, consistent
with hepatocellular carcinoma on biopsy.

He was scheduled for outpatient oncology, but was unable to
tolerate the pain, and so presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further
pain management. The pain is stabbing, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**],
alleviated by lying on the right side, worsened by lying on his
left side. He notes he was taking oxycodone at home, but this
was not providing relief. At 5mg he was OK for side effects, but
this did not cover his pain, but when this was increased up to
20mg, he stated he had GI upset. He is able to ambulate up two
flights of stairs before he has to rest due to dyspnea.

Following admission to Medicine service, he was found to be
unresponsive on routine nurse exam at around 2 pm. His vitals
were BP 94/62 HR 84 RR 16 82% on 2LNC. He was placed on 5L NC
which improved the sats to 91% and NRB which improved to 97%. He
was given 1L NS. He received 0.2 mg of IV nalaxone which
improved his mental status in less than one minute. He coughed
up approx 30 ml blood after this. His BP improved to 120s/60s.
His blood pressure transiently decreased to 94/60 and responded
to 100/48 after another 1L of NS. He received 30 mg of MS Contin
at 8 am with another dose of 30 mg at 10 am. He has also
received 15 mg of immediate release at 8 am and 10 am.
.
On arrival to ICU his vitals were T 98.2 HR 85 BP 61/48 which
improved to 108/75 without intervention, 10 97% on 15L facemask.
He was alert and oriented x 3. He denied any discomfort. He
denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomitting,
fever, chills, nightsweats, cough, cold, constipation, diarrhea,
blood in stool, hematuria, or dysuria. He still has abdominal
discomfort. Dyspnea on exertion was noted in the chart.
.
In the MICU, mental status improved with a total of 2 doses of
Narcan.  He was also treated with Lactulose for component of
hepatic encephalopathy.  Palliative care and Oncology were
consulted for management of hepatic mass.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY Study Date of [**2192-11-6**]
1:45 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of aortic dissection or pulmonary embolism.
However, the
subsegmental pulmonary arteries cannot be fully evaluated on
this phase of
contrast.
2. Infiltrating hepatic lesion involving the majority of the
right lobe with relative sparing of segment VI. However, phase
of contrast is not optimized for full evaluation of the liver
and optimal evaluation with triphasic CT versus MRI recommended.
Further progression of portal vein thrombosis involving the
right portal vein with new extension into the main portal vein.
3. Coronary artery calcifications. Calcification of the aortic
valve of
unknown hemodynamic significance.
4. Emphasematous changes.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2192-11-5**] 10:57 PM
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process
detected. No
evidence of free intra-abdominal air.
.
[**2192-11-6**] CT ABD/Pelv: IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of aortic dissection or pulmonary embolism.
However, the
subsegmental pulmonary arteries cannot be fully evaluated on
this phase of
contrast.
2. Infiltrating hepatic lesion involving the majority of the
right lobe with relative sparing of segment VI. However, phase
of contrast is not optimized for full evaluation of the liver
and optimal evaluation with triphasic CT versus MRI recommended.
Further progression of portal vein thrombosis involving the

3. Coronary artery calcifications. Calcification of the aortic

unknown hemodynamic significance.
4. Emphasematous changes.
.
[**2192-11-8**] MRI Abdomen: IMPRESSION:
1. Large infiltrating and enlarging right hepatic mass,
consistent with
hepatocellular carcinoma.
2. Right portal vein thrombosis.
3. Cirrhosis.
.
[**2192-11-12**] EEG: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to
the presence of a slow and abnormal background indicative of a
mild encephalopathy. Medications, metabolic disturbances, and
infection are among the most common causes. Nevertheless, there
were no areas of focal slowing and there was no evidence of
focal epileptiform discharges.
.
[**2192-11-12**] CT HEAD W/O contrast: IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute
hemorrhage or shift of normally midline structures. Small, subcm
hypodensity in left temporal lobe of uncertain significance- can
relate to volume averaging or less likely a focus of ischemic or
neoplastic etiology. Please note that MRI is more accurate for
better assessment and can be considered.
.
[**2192-11-13**] CT ABD PELVIS: IMPRESSION:
1. Thickening of the hepatic flexure and sigmoid colon with fat
stranding and fluid in the mesentery. These findings are new
compared to most recent CT examination from [**2192-11-6**].
These findings are con
