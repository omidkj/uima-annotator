History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 55F from [**Hospital3 4298**] with history of
autoimmune hepatitis on azathioprine who is admitted to the MICU
for worsening SOB. Her symptoms of fevers, chills, cough, and
dyspnea began approximately one week prior to admission; she was
seen in the ER on [**4-18**] and given a prescription for levofloxacin
x5 days. Her symptoms failed to improve. Fevers were up to 102.5
at home. She represented to the OSH on [**4-22**]. Vitals there were
T101.3 P 96 BP 105/62 RR 18 O2 94% on room air. She was given
solumedrol 125mg IV, levofloxacin 750mg, lasix 40mg, and 500cc
of saline. CXR was concerning for a bilateral pna, and she was
subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management as she
receives her hepatology care here.

On presentation to the ED at [**Hospital1 18**] her VS were 96.4 80 105/57,
90% on RA, 96-100 on 2L. She had oral thrush on exam as well as
an infected tooth. She had diffuse left sided crackles. WBC 1.4
(baseline [**12-27**]). Lactate 1.8. She was given 1g Vanco, 100mg
doxycycline, and gentamicin 375mg.

On the medical floor, she was continued on aztreonam,
vancomycin, and azithromycin. The morning of transfer, she was
found to be increasingly tachypneic with an increased O2
requirement. Her sats were 90-91% on 4L, at which time she was
placed on a non-rebreather. She is transferred to the MICU for
closer monitoring given concern for respiratory decompensation.

On review of systems, she reports left molar tooth pain. She has
some loose stools along with her respiratory symptoms. Denies
headache, nasal congestion, sore throat, myalgias/arthralgias,
dysuria, rash. Did have sick contact with "pneumonia" who is not
currently hospitalized. No travel. +mice at home.

STUDIES:
[**4-23**] PA AND LATERAL CXR: IMPRESSION: Multiple new patchy
airspace opacities bilaterally, most
prominent in the left lower lung, consistent with multifocal
pneumonia.
Follow- up is recommended to ensure clearance

[**4-25**] TTE:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect or
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast however images were suboptimal and patient was unable
to cooperate with maneuvers. No evidence of pulmonary AV
shunting identified by technically limited agitated saline
study. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mild
