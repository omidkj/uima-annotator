Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfonamides / Macrodantin / Bactrim

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 317**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxic respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
BIPAP

History of Present Illness:
 [**Age over 90 **]F with atrial fibrillation, severe tricuspid regurgitation,
moderate mitral regurgitation, and HTN, admitted to the MICU
from the ED with hypoxic respiratory distress. Ms. [**Known lastname 96416**] has
a long h/o chronic dyspnea, and has had extensive workup by
Cardiology and Pulmonary, including negative stress test, PFTs,
and CT chest. Her ambulatory sats have been normal. The etiology
has been felt to be most likely [**3-14**] a combination of diastolic
dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, and MR. However, she has
failed to improve on appropriate medical management of these
issues. Over the last 2 days, she has had symptoms similar to
past exacerbations. She states she has become intermittently
dyspneic with minimal exertion, worse in the morning. She has
had no associated chest pain, lightheadedness, diaphoresis,
palpitations, fever/chills, or cough. She has had no recent LE
edema, orthopnea, or PND. She states she has been compliant with
her medications. This afternoon, she was at her hairdresser and
had acutely worsening shortness of [**Last Name (LF) 1440**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she came into the
ED.
.
In the ED, her VS were T 96.8, HR 63, BP 150/70, RR 18, and
O2sat 100%RA. She was in no distress, but had scattered crackles
on lung exam. Her CXR showed no acute process. EKG showed
V-paced rhythm with no obvious abnormalities. Her BNP was mildly
elevated, as was her D-dimer. She was sent for CTA chest to r/o
PE. The CT showed no PE or other acute abnormality, however she
became acutely SOB and hypoxic to 85% on 6LNC upon returning.
She was 90% on NRB, and she was tried on nitro gtt, but became
hypotensive to 70s/40s. The nitro gtt was stopped and she
regained her BP. Her ABG on NRB was 7.51/26/55, and she was
started on BiPAP. She was subsequently given Lasix 40mg IV x 1
then 60mg x 1, to which she put out 1.25L. She was admitted to
the MICU for further management.

Past Medical History:
1. Chronic afib- s/p AVJ ablation ([**2-14**]) and PPM placement
([**4-13**])
2. Hypertension
3. hyperdynamic LV function in the absence of coronary disease
4. s/p breast reduction
5. History of post-herpetic neuralgia

Social History:
Walks with walker; lives alone at [**Hospital3 **].  Smoked for
one year [**73**] years ago; husband was a heavy smoker.  Occasional
EtOH.  She is an artist.


Family History:
Mother died of MI at 78

Admission CXR
New convincing evidence of pulmonary edema in this radiograph.
The radiograph is of somewhat suboptimal quality
.
CTA Chest
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. Limited assessment of the
aorta demonstrates no aneurysmal dilatation.
2. Reflux of contrast into the inferior IVC likely secondary to
bolus rate, less likely right heart failure.
3. Stable CT appearance of 3-mm pulmonary nodules in the lingula
and left lower lobe from [**2198-11-3**].
.
Transesophageal echocardiogram
Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 5-10 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with
Valsalva. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.  Compared with the prior report (images
unavailable for review) of [**2198-11-5**], the  findings are similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a [**Age over 90 **]F with AF, TR/MR, and HTN, admitted with hypoxic
respiratory distress.
.
MICU Course: On admission to the MICU she was satting 100% on
BiPAP in NAD. She was weaned to 4LNC immediately and was
subsequently titrated down to RA again.  She received IV lasix
and had good urine output to it.  She is was then transferred
out to the floor. She denies chest pain, shortness of [**Age over 90 1440**],
lightheadedness, palpitation.
.
1. Hypoxic respiratory distress: SOB on presentation without
hypoxia. Decompensated after CT with hypoxia and respiratory
distress in setting of hypertension, likely [**3-14**] acute pulmonary
edema with IV contrast bolus. TTE is largely unchanged from [**2198**]
- shows mild-mod TR, mod MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 96417**] were flat, making
ACS unlikely.
She was transferred to the floor on room air, and her home dose
of lasix was restarted.  Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], she should receive an
extra half dose for the next two days, and she should take this
extra dose prn shortness of [**Last Name (STitle) 1440**] or lower extremity edema.
.
2. Atrial fibrillation: s/p PPM placement and AVJ ablation. She
is followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 1911**] of
Cardiology.  As above, she was continued Toprol XL for rate
control and coumadin.
.
3. HTN: On multiple meds as outpatient, reports compliance.
Continued Toprol XL, irbesartan, verapamil SR, HCTZ and lasix
.
4. FEN: Regular, heart-healthy/low-sodium diet
.
5. Ppx: PPI, coumadin
.
6. Code status: DNR/DNI, confirmed with patient
.
7. Communication: son, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 96416**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 96418**],
