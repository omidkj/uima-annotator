Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins / Triamterene / Percocet

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, respiratory distress.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation.


History of Present Illness:
A [**Age over 90 **] yo woman with history of diastolic CHF (EF 40-45%), mild to
moderate aortic stenosis, CAD s/p MI, asthma, presents from home
with SOB and cough. Per OMR and discussion with family, she was
recently hospitalized at [**Hospital6 12112**] from
[**Date range (1) 92181**] for acute CHF/hypotension/ARDS requiring intubation,
treated for ? MI + pneumonia, w/ acute wt loss (nadir 117)
related to dysphagia (rx esophagus stretched, has hiatal
hernia). Course also complicated by C diff diarrhea (rx flagyl
then vancomycin) and thrush, prolonged rehab stay. She was
recently back to her baseline status, living independently and
active (plays cards regularly), but reports that for the past
few days she has not been feeling well, too weak to get out of
bed yesterday when family came to visit, worsening cough, SOB.
She was visited by someone at her senior living on the day of
admission and EMS was called. Per EMS, her lungs sounded tight
with poor air movement, no wheeze. She was placed on oxygen,
given 2 mg IV magnesium, and brought to [**Hospital1 18**].

In the ED, initial vitals were: T 101.8, P 139-->99, BP 132/73,
R 22, O2 sat 69% on ??? improved to 96% with bag mask
ventilation. Patient appeared tachypneic with poor mental
status, moving all extremities but not following commands. On
lung exam, she had poor air movement throughout but no wheezes.
She was intubated with etomidate and succinylcholine. Tube was
initially noted to be at the carina and was pulled back to good
position. CXR showed R-sided infiltrate with possible pulmonary
edema. UA negative. Lactate nl. EKG with old LBBB, trop neg. She
was started on levofloxacin, then developed streaking rash up R
arm tracking along vein where IV was placed. Levo was stopped
and IV re-positioned. Given vancomycin. She became transiently
hypotensive to 80s, but improved with IVF. Also received
fentanyl, versed, and tylenol.

In the MICU, she was treated initially with vanco/meropenem for
concern of HAP. She was noted to have AF with ventricular
response to the 120s and was given metoprolol with good
response. On the 11th, she was unresponsive during a spontaneous
breathing trial with CXR concerning for aspiration event vs
flash pulmonary edema, so she remained intubated. She was given
40 mg IV Lasix x3 on the 11th and restarted on her home BP meds,
which include metoprolol and lisinopril. Cardiac enzymes were
negative. Echo showed preserved LVEF, with moderate AS, mild AR,
mild MR, and mild pulmonary hypertension (increased from prior).
She was extubated on the 12th, again diuresed with 40 mg IV
Lasix boluses for net negative of 2L and now is transferred to
the floors in stable condition.

Past Medical History:
CHF with preserved LVEF (50% per TTE [**6-/2184**])
AS/AI ([**Location (un) 109**] 1.2-1.9cm2 in [**3-21**])
CAD, s/p MI '[**78**], angina at rest
Hypertension
Glaucoma
Hyperlipidemia
Asthma
Osteoarthritis

Social History:
She lives alone in senior living in [**Location (un) 3146**]. She is independent
of all ADLs at baseline with high level of functioning. She
walks with a walker. There is no history of smoking, ETOH, or
illicit drug use.

Family History:
Positive for premature CAD (50s-60s) in sisters and brother.

Physical Exam:
Vitals: Tm 97.8, Tc 97.8 (afebrile throughout admission), HR 80
and regular, BP 119/63, O2 sat 96% on 6L oxygen by nasal cannula
I/Os: 2.4L net negative since admission; 1L negative in last 24
hours
General: awake, alert and oriented. Pleasant elderly woman in no
acute distress, sitting comfortably in chair and speaking in
complete sentences. Calm and cooperative.
HEENT: normocephalic, EOMI, PERRLA, moist mucous membranes
Neck: supple
Lungs: diffuse wheezes in upper lung fields with crackles at
bases; inspiratory efforts are poor limiting full assessment,
although air movement in general seems decreased
Cardiovascular: RRR, normal S1/S2, 3/6 systolic murmur loudest
at the LUSB, non-radiating to the coratids
Abdomen: soft and non-tender
Ext: trace pitting edema to ankles bilaterally; DP pulses
intact; no LE erythema, rashes, or tenderness; no assymetric
swelling

Micro Studies:

Blood cultures: negative
Urine cultures: negative

MRSA screen: negative

Imaging Studies:

Transthoracic echocardiogram ([**6-21**]):
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50%). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There is abnormal septal motion/position. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
moderate aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**2-13**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2183-4-4**], the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
higher. The rhythm is now atrial fibrillation. The transaortic
valve gradient and the severity of aortic regurgitation and
mitral regurgitation are similar.

CXR ([**6-20**]):
Probable asymmetric pulmonary edema and left lower lobe
atelectasis, with small right pleural effusion. Infection within
the left lung base and right perihilar region cannot be excluded
and recommend follow up radiographs after diuresis for further
evaluation.

CXR ([**6-21**]):
The ET tube tip is 3.5 cm above the carina. OG tube tip passes
below the diaphragm with its tip being below the inferior margin
of the image. Compared to the prior study there is no change in
cardiomediastinal silhouette. Bibasal opacities are present
although there is interval improvement of vascular engorgement
that might be attributed to better lung volumes. Bilateral
pleural effusions are unchanged.

CXR ([**6-23**]):
Interval removal of the ET and NG tubes. Interval improvement of
pulmonary edema with cardiomegaly. Small bilateral pleural
effusion. No pneumothorax.

CXR ([**6-27**]):
There is significant interval improvement in pulmonary edema,
which is completely resolved on the current study. The lungs are
hyperinflated but currently essentially clear except for minimal
left basal atelectasis. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
The significant kyphosis with
multiple wedge thoracic spine fractures is grossly un
