.
CXR ([**3-31**]): No acute pulmonary process.
.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis ([**3-31**]): Minimal fluid around the right kidney
with possible grade 1 laceration. Although unliklely, collecting
system injury cannot be excluded. The patient was recalled for
delayed imaging through the kidneys but had to be urgently
dialyzed for ethylene glycol toxicity. Low tolerance for repeat
imaging is recommended. This was discussed with the MICU
resident prior to final review of the transcribed report.
.
CT C Spine ([**3-31**]): No CT evidence of fracture or dislocation.
.
CT Head ([**3-31**]): No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or edema.
.
Echo ([**4-1**]):
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is mild to moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the
anterior wall, mid to distal septum, distal inferior wall, and
apex (EF~40%) . Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
consistent with coronary artery disease. Pacemaker/catheter in
right atrium and right
ventricle.


Brief Hospital Course:
43 yo male with history of depression who presented with
ethylene glycol intoxication as a suicide attempt in response to
recent life stressors. The following issues were investigated
during this hospitalization.
.
# Ethylene Glycol Intoxication. The patient presented with an
ethylene glycol level of 581 pre dialysis. He had severe
acidemia with an ABG of 7.06/31/80 and an osmole gap of 126 and
crystals in his urine. The patient received dialysis [**3-31**] and
[**4-1**] and was placed on fomepizole. After dialysis his osmola
