ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  Chest pain.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Dissecting ascending aorta.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  History of GI bleed.
5.  Alcohol history.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 46-year-old
male who presented to the emergency department with
complaints of chest pain.  His chest pain work up included
EKG and a chest x-ray, which were consistent with acute
myocardial infarction and chest x-ray demonstrated a wide
mediastinum.  The patient was in the process of getting a CT
angio to rule out dissecting aorta, when he acutely
decompensated with pulmonary edema on the CT scanner.  The
patient was intubated and was taken to the cardiac
catheterization lab for a suspected possible coronary
syndrome.  On cardiac catheterization, a large ascending
aortic dissection was detected with the dissection extending
into the aortic valve and causing 4+ aortic insufficiency.
At that time, the patient was booked for emergent OR for
repair of his aortic dissection.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  None.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is sedated, intubated.
HEENT - atraumatic, normocephalic.  Neck is supple, midline
with no masses or lymphadenopathy.  The chest is clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular is tachycardiac,
normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops noted.  Abdomen
is soft, nontender, nondistended with no masses or
organomegaly.  Extremities are warm, noncyanotic,
nonedematous.  Neuro is sedated.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken emergently to the
operating room and had a repair of his type A aortic
dissection with a #26 Gelweave as well as re-distention of
the aortic valve.  Operative findings included the fact that
the dissection extending into the aortic valve and nearly
involve the left main coronary artery.  For full details of
the operation, please see the previously dictated operative
note.

Postoperatively, the patient was transported to the CSRU and
had appropriate care to maintain blood pressure less than 140
systolic.  The patient was awoken from sedation and seemed to
move all extremities.  He was re-sedated and eventually
weaned off ventilation.  Subsequent to this the patient had
an essentially unremarkable postoperative course.  His
hypertension was controlled with oral hypotensives and the
patient's activity was advanced as tolerated.  Ultimately,
the patient was discharged on postoperative day six,
tolerating a regular diet, adequate pain control on p.o. pain
meds and having no further symptoms of chest pain.  A CT
angio scan was obtained on [**2153-8-24**], which did demonstrate
continued aortic dissection distal to the interposition
graft, partially involved the innominate artery.  There was
also a small pericardial effusion noted.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISPOSITION:  Home with VNA.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lopressor 100 mg b.i.d.
2.  Lasix 20 mg b.i.d. x2 weeks.
3.  Potassium chloride 20 mEq b.i.d. x2 weeks.
4.  Aspirin 325 mg q.d.
5.  Zantac 150 mg b.i.d.
6.  Percocet 5/325 one to two tablets q4 hours p.r.n.
7.  Iron complex 150 mg q.d.
8.  Vitamin C 500 mg b.i.d.

INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is to continue ambulation and
pulmonary toilette.  VNA is to come in for cardiopulmonary
checks as well as assessment of the wound.  The patient
should continue with the cardiac diet.  No heavy lifting with
a 10 pound weight limit, no driving.  The patient should
follow up with his primary care provider [**Name Initial (PRE) 176**] 4 weeks.  The
patient should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 4 weeks.  The
patient should follow up with the wound clinic in 2 weeks for
wound check.  The patient will ultimately need follow up CT
scans, initially at 3, 6 and 12 months and subsequently 1 to
2 years after that.
