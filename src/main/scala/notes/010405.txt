Brief Hospital Course:
Septic Shock:  Blood pressures in the 90s systolic on arrival to
the ICU.  Patient was febrile, tachycardiac with a bandemia and
a lactic acidosis.  Initially concern for hospital acquired
pneumonia as source as patient had a right sided infiltrate on
presentation.  She subsequently grew e. coli from her urine and
her blood.  A central line and arterial line was placed, she
received over 10 liters normal saline, and levophed was started
for hypotension. The patient was initially started on
vancomycin, aztreonam, levofloxacin for hospital acquired
pneumonia given allergies to both penicillins and sulfa drugs.
Blood cultures and urine cultures grew out E.coli, at which
point gentamicin was started.  She also grew providencia
stuartii from her urine which was sensative to amikacin and not
gentamycin and these antibiotics were switched.  She has now
received 8 days of both gram positive and gram negative coverage
for hospital acquired pneumonia.  Appropriate coverage for
providencia stuartii was started on [**2192-8-23**].

Respiratory Failure: CXR on admission showed evidence of right
sided pneumonia. Patient was intubated given poor oxygenation
and ventilation likely [**1-7**] pneumonia.  Weaning off the
ventilator was attempted daily and she ultimately required
diuresis with lasix prior to successful extubation. She was
extubated successfully on [**2192-8-24**] and is currently satting 92%
on RA.  She received an 8 day course of vancomycin and gram
negative coverage with gentamicin/amikacin for hospital acquired
pneumonia. Patient was initially extubated successfully and
transferred to the floor.  On the floor patient had a PEA arrest
likely secondary to apnea and mucus plugging leading to hypoxia.
 Patient was down for no less than 10 minutes and recieved CPR.
Patient was then trasnferred back to the ICU.  IN the ICU
patient required ventilatory support and was not able to be
successfully extubated - partly secondary to apnea likely
secondary to underlying cerebral hypoxic insult secondary to PEA
arrest.  Patient's family decided again to make her DNR/DNI and
decided to have her extubated.  Patient was extubated on [**2192-8-31**]
and expired at 3:55 pm due to respiratory failure.
