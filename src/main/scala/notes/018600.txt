Reason: Lead placement

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
76 year old man with s/p dual pacer pacer implantation
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Lead placement
PA & LATERAL VIEWS CHEST.

REASON FOR EXAM: Check location of pacemaker leads.

Comparison is made with prior study dated [**2153-8-14**].

New dual lead pacemaker with tip in standard positions in the
right atrium and right ventricle. There is no pneumothorax.
Stable mild bilateral pleural effusions greater in the left
side. Persistent left lower lobe retrocardiac

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement. Elongated LA. Moderate to
severe
spontaneous echo contrast in the LAA. Depressed LAA emptying
velocity
(<0.2m/s) Cannot exclude LAA thrombus.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. Normal
interatrial septum.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Mildly dilated LV cavity.
Normal regional
LV systolic function. Overall normal LVEF (>55%). [Intrinsic LV
systolic
function likely depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.]

LV WALL MOTION: basal anterior - normal; mid anterior - normal;
basal
anteroseptal - normal; mid anteroseptal - normal; basal
inferoseptal - normal;

global RV free
wall hypokinesis.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the
procedure.

PreBypass: The left atrium is markedly dilated. The left atrium
is elongated.
Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is present in the
left atrial
