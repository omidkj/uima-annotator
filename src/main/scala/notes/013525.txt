History of Present Illness:
This is a 72 year old male with a medical history significant
for
DM2, HTN, HLD who recently ([**2119-6-19**]) underwent a complex
revision
left total knee replacement (with hinged knee prosthesis) for a
failed primary left total knee arthroplasty. He was admitted on
[**6-14**] for a failed total knee replacement and underwent a planned
revision left total knee replacement which was converted to a
resection arthroplasty of all components with extensive
synovectomy.  His course was complicated by hypotension related
to blood loss from first surgery which required an ICU stay and
small PE diagnosed for which he was started on coumarin. He was
then taken back to the OR on [**6-19**] for the complex revision of
the
left TKR as above.  He was monitored in the ICU after that
operation for unclear reasons.  He was discharged in a stable
condition on his home medications.

He reports that at the time of discharge he was having a lot of
pain and some serosanguineous drainage from his knee.  He was
initially able to walk with a walker but over the course of the
weeks he was slowly unable to walk.  About 1 week prior to admit
he developed fevers/chills and some redness and swelling of the
knee.  The swelling increased to the point where he could not
move the knee at all.  That is what ultimately prompted him to
come to the ED.

He then presented to the ED with bloody drainage from his left
knee weakness and chills.  An XR of the knee on [**7-10**] revealed
some
gas in the subcutaneous tissue and joint space which was
concerning for an infection.  His WBC count was initially normal
but increased to 17 on [**7-12**].  An ESR was elevated at 95 and a CRP
was 200.1.  The knee was tapped on [**7-11**] and the cell count
revealed [**Numeric Identifier 7923**] WBC (95% polys).  The gram stain revealed 1+
polys.  Of
note his Cr was also elevated from last admit at 1.4 up from
baseline of 1.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopaedic surgery service on
[**2119-7-10**] with the complaint of meft knee weakness and drainage.
He noted that while at rehab he became progressively unable to
extend his knee and noticed reddness and dranage along the
inferior aspect of his incision.  The diagnosis of a patellar
tendon rupture was made after admission.  There was an area of
erythema located over the distal end of his incision that became
progressive over his first 2 days of admission.  He [**Last Name (un) 4996**] to
spike fevers and subsequently had his knee tapped which revealed
13,000WBC and a culture that eventually became positve for MSSA.
 He also had a fever spike as high as 104.3 and had a positive
blood culture for MSSA.  He was taken to the operating room on
[**2119-7-12**] for a left knee I&D and a VAC dressing placement.  He
was once again taken to the OR on [**2119-7-14**] for repeat I+D and VAC
change.  All implats were retained during these procedures.  He
was left intubated following his second procedure for
intermittnet hypotension and respiratory distress.  He was
extubated in the ICU without issue.  He received an IVC filter
on [**2119-7-15**] and was taken back to the OR for a repeat I+D and
VAC change on [**2119-7-16**] with retaiend hardware.  He was taken
back to the OR for definitive repair on [**2119-7-18**] in combination
with Plastic surgery for a repeat I+D, liner exchange, medial
gastrocnemius flap and split thicknedd skin grafting.  He had a
VAC drain placed as a bolster and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 406**] drain in place.  He
was kept on bedrest for 5 days following this procedure.  He had
a short stay in the ICU for monitoring but was subsequently
transferred to the floor in stable condition following this
procedure. Please see separately dictated operative reports for
details.  The patient initially received Vancomycin until
culture speciation and was subsequently trnasitioned to Ancef
and Rifampin per Infectios Disease who were consulted regarding
his care.  The patient received several traunsfusions of PRBC
and FFP for falling hematocrit and INR reversal respectively.
He was anticoagulated on therapeutic Lovenox during his stay for
known prior pulmonary embolus.

Otherwise, pain was initially controlled with a PCA followed by
a transition to oral pain medications on POD#1. At the time of
discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling
well.  The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The
patient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately
controlled on an oral regimen. The operative extremity was
neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign.

At time of discharge, patient was deemed stable for safe
discharge to rehab.

The patient's weight-bearing status is touch down weight bearing
as tolerated on the operative extremity locked in extension.
