HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 57-year-old gentleman was
admitted, referred in after cardiac catheterization to Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for probably aortic valve replacement.  He
had a cardiac catheterization done on the date of admission,
[**1-26**], which showed "normal" coronaries, no mitral
regurgitation, an ejection fraction of 45%, with critical
aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of approximately
0.5-0.6 cm squared.  Patient also had diffuse mild
hypokinesis.  He was admitted to the Cardiology Service
postcatheterization, and was seen by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2031**] with plans to
do aortic valve replacement for his congestive heart failure
symptoms.

On admission, he had allergies to shellfish, otherwise no
other known drug allergies.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Atrial fibrillation which was new onset.
2. Critical aortic stenosis.
3. Congestive heart failure.
4. Pulmonary hypertension.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Coumadin 5 mg po q day.
2. Digoxin 0.25 mg po q day.
3. Cardizem 60 mg po qid.
4. Heparin drip was started on transfer in.

He had no other medications prior to the hospital.

He did present with a cough and dyspnea and some pleuritic
chest pain.  He was a former smoker.  He also mentioned that
his daughter recently had a Strep infection.  The patient did
have some symptoms of orthopnea, but no chest pain at the
time.  He was taken to the Emergency Room.  His blood
pressure was found to be 190/120.  He was given IV Cardizem
for control.  He was also found to be in congestive heart
failure with new onset atrial fibrillation for which he was
given Lasix, Coumadin, Heparin, digoxin, and Cardizem for
rate control.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for catheterization.

On admission, his hematocrit was 47.8, a K of 3.1 for which
he was given 40 mEq of potassium repletion.  Sodium 135,
chloride 99, CO2 27, BUN 9, creatinine 1.2.  Blood sugar of
123.

He quit smoking approximately 15 years ago, but still
admitted to occasional tobacco use.  He is admitted to the
Cardiology service.

CT Surgery consult was requested.  The patient continued to
be diuresed for congestive heart failure, and he remained on
Dr.[**Name (NI) 13610**] service while the patient was diuresed and rate
controlled was achieved for atrial fibrillation.  The patient
remained in atrial fibrillation.  Of note, his pulmonary
artery pressures were 68 systolic.

On examination, he had some ankle edema and a little bit of
abdominal distention.

His only past surgical history was an operation for a right
club foot in childhood.  Also of a more greater importance
which delayed his surgery, he had rotten teeth.  He never had
dental checkup and this needed to be addressed before the
patient could have aortic valve replacement for risk of
infecting his biprosthetic valve.

Dental consult was requested which could not take place that
evening.  The patient was seen on the 14th by the Oral
Surgery Service.  On the 12th, the Coumadin continued to be
dosed.  It was stopped.  The INR was 1.3.  Additional
laboratories were sent off in preparation for his operation.
Dental recommended extracting all of his remaining teeth
given his periodontal compromise and in his great infectious
risk.  They recommended full extraction for the patient.  His
aortic valve replacement surgery was delayed.  Until this was
completed, the patient continued to be diuresed and in-house,
they already diuresed off 2.5 liters the day prior.

He underwent his dental procedure on the 15th, and was
monitored for bleeding given his slightly elevated INR.  He
was switched over to Heparin to cover his atrial fibrillation
which he remained in, in the 90s-100s on house day four.  His
urinalysis was negative.  He remained asymptomatic from his
atrial fibrillation.  It is also recommended that he receive
noninvasive carotid studies which showed essentially normal
carotid arteries.  Please refer to the examination on
[**1-30**].  He continued on diltiazem and digoxin for his
rate control of his atrial fibrillation.

His hematocrit rose to 52.1 and then back down to 48.2.  His
BUN and creatinine were stable.  He continued to receive
Lasix diuresis and continued to have a Heparin drip off
Coumadin for a therapeutic goal of PTT to 60-80 range.
Patient continued to have bleeding from his gums which again
delayed his surgery, and was recommended that his Lasix be
held and his Heparin be discontinued as he would not be able
to undergo his surgery until his oral bleeding stopped.  He
was seen again on the 18th by Oral Surgery.  They cleared him
to proceed with surgery.  The patient was delayed another day
for continued oozing.  Heparin was restarted on the 18th with
PTT to be followed.  Patient had some blood clots that were
loosen and dislodged from his gums.  Early in the morning on
the 19th, he was examined again and his bleeding stabilized.

[**Last Name (STitle) 46501**]ned on diltiazem also for his rate control, and he
continued to bleed on [**2-2**] with oozing while he was
back on his Heparin.  He was seen on the [**2-2**] by Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 46502**] for Cardiothoracic Surgery.  Prosthetic
options were discussed with the patient.  In the evening on
the 20th, the patient continued to have some persistent
bleeding from his mouth, but was ultimately cleared for
surgery, and on [**2-3**], the patient underwent aortic
valve replacement with a 27 mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**] [**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial
tissue valve by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], and was transferred to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit in stable condition on a
propofol drip.  He was seen by case management also.

On postoperative day one, he remained in the Cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit.  He was extubated with a respiratory
rate of 24, sating 95% on 4 liters nasal cannula.  He
continued on his perioperative Vancomycin.  His hematocrit
rose from 25.2 to 30.2.  He had a PT of 16.7, PTT of 26.6,
with an INR of 1.2.  Postoperative laboratories as follows:
sodium 134, potassium 4.6, chloride 107, CO2 23, BUN 12,
creatinine 0.7 with a blood sugar of 130.  Was awake, alert,
and responding appropriately.  His lungs were clear.  He had
no air leak.  He began Lopressor, beta blocker.  His chest
tubes were discontinued.  His diet was advanced and aspirin
was started.  Diuresis was begun.  He remained in sinus
rhythm with good blood pressure of 118/64.

He was transferred out to the floor on postoperative day two
in stable condition with a blood pressure of approximately
88/62 in sinus rhythm in the 80s.  He was seen by Physical
Therapy to begin his ambulation, which he did well.  He was
taking po Percocet for pain management.   On the 24th, he had
no events overnight.  Was in sinus rhythm in the 60s.  Lungs
were clear.  He was sating 99% on 4 liters.  He continued
with good diuresis.  His pacing wires were removed.  He
continued ambulating with Physical Therapy.

On postoperative day four, he had no events.  Again, he was
hemodynamically stable.  His lungs are clear.  He had 1+
pedal edema.  He continued ambulating with Physical Therapy.
He remained in sinus rhythm without any ectopy with a
temperature max of 99.1 and a blood pressure of 120/68.  He
was seen by Case Management with a plan to discharge him to
home with [**Hospital3 **] or Stoten VNA Services.

On the [**2-8**], he had an unremarkable physical
exam.  His incision was clean, dry, and intact without
sternal instability.
