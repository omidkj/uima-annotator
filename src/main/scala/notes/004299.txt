CHEST, AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE FRONTAL VIEW: Blunting of the
costophrenic angles is new, due to small pleural effusions
developed over three days. Previous vascular engorgement has
resolved suggesting the pleural fluid is the residual of
improved CHF. Lungs are hyperinflated, clear of any
consolidation. Right upper lobe nodule is obscured by overlying
EKG lead. The heart size is normal. The aortic arch is
calcified. The descending thoracic aorta is tortuous.
IMPRESSION: New small pleural effusions remain after prior heart
failure. COPD. Right upper lobe nodule.

EKG: Sinus tachycardia. Occasional ventricular premature beats.
Compared to the previous tracing no definite change.


Brief Hospital Course:
77-year-old female with a history of COPD, on 2L NC home oxygen,
HTN, DM, vascular dementia who presents with shortness of
breath.

# COPD exacerbation: There is an unclear inciting event. The
patient didn't respond to home steroids or nebulizations.
Initially the patient was on up to 6L NC for oxygenation. The
patient was admitted to the hospital and improved with IV
steroids, levofloxacin and nebulizations. She completed 7 days
of levofloxacin. She was transitioned to oral prednisone and
given a 10 day taper. Her oxygen was weaned to 2L NC.

# RUL nodule: The patient has a known RUL nodule. This as been
previously followed as an outpatient. The most likely etiology
is scarring but malignancy cannot be ruled out. This will be
followed as an outpatient. Further management is up to her
primary care physician.

# Tachycardia: The patient has episodes of tachycardia which
were thought to be secondary to alberterol nebulizers. She was
switched to Xopenex with a decrease in the heart rate. She was
also given some IVF which decreased her heart rate as well. She
was encouraged to take PO fluids.

# Acute kidney injury: On presentation was 1.3 likely in the
setting of dehydration. With fluids her creatinine returned to
baseline.

# Elevated Cr: Cr up to 1.3 from baseline around 1.0 on
admission and mildly dry appearing on exam, likely from poor PO
intake over the weekend while having respiratory difficulties.
Creatinine resolved to baseline on second day.

# HTN: The patient was continued on verapamil. She was also
started on captopril (from lisinopril). Her blood pressure
remained well controlled.

# DM: The patient had elevated blood sugars in the setting of
steroids. She was taking oral diabetic medications. She was
started on NPH and insulin sliding scale. She was monitored
closely and her insulin scale was adjusted as needed. Her
aspirin was continued.

# Anemia: Stable during admission. She will need to be followed
as an outpatient.

# Dementia: Stable during admission. She has short term memory
problems. [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) 97069**] was held because it causes "increased
confusion and aggitation" per family. Sertraline and trazadone
were continued.

# Hyperlipidemia: Continued on pravastatin.

# GERD: Continued on omeprazole.
