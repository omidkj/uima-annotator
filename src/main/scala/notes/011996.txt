CXR (PA & LAT) [**2107-1-26**]:
There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm which may in part
be due to
volume loss, although underlying small subpulmonic pleural
effusion may also be present. Large area of right perihilar
opacity likely relates to the patient's known underlying
malignancy, although superimposed infectious process is
difficult to exclude. The left lung is clear. SVC and IVC
filters are noted.

CTA Chest [**2107-1-26**]:
CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: A right paratracheal lymph
node measures
1.2 cm in short axis and is stable. There is a filling defect in
the left
subclavian vein. This is also unchanged. A filter is seen in the
SVC. Distal to the SVC, there is no evidence of clot. The right
pleural effusion is significantly increased in size and is now
large. There is a new left pleural effusion. There is a new
pericardial effusion of moderate size. There is now
near-complete atelectasis of the right upper lobe with some
patchy opacities likely due to post-obstructive pneumonia. There
is complete atelectasis of the right middle lobe. The right
lower lobe is still aerated with some minimal atelectasis. The
tumor in the right upper lobe is slightly increased in size,
currently measuring 2.0 x 1.9 cm (previously 1.9 x 1.5 cm).
There is some atelectasis in the lingula. No new lesions are
seen in the aerated portions of the lungs; however, please note
that the previously identified rounded foci in the right upper
lobe and right middle lobe are now obscured by atelectasis.
There is a small filling defect in a subsegmental artery to the
left lower lobe (series 3, [**Female First Name (un) 899**] 51 through 54). The most proximal
portions of the liver and spleen that are depicted on this
examination are unremarkable. The thyroid gland is enlarged and
this is stable.

On bone windows, there are no concerning osteolytic or
osteosclerotic lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. Increase in size of right pleural effusion which is now large
and new left pleural effusion, small to moderate in size. New
moderate size pericardial effusion.
2. Subsegmental PE in an artery to the left lower lobe.
3. New right upper lobe and right middle lobe collapse. Bronchi
to the right upper lobe are increasin
