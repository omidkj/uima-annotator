Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4891**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer for somnolence, vascular intervention, renal failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2130-5-5**]: PICC placed
[**2130-5-8**]: Tunnelled hemodialysis line

History of Present Illness:
53 yo F with PMHx of CHF EF 25%, Cdiff, DM2, HTN, chronic venous
stasis who presented to OSH ED for lower ext pain and edema on
[**2130-5-3**]. She went in from wound care clinic appt and admitted
for cellulitis. She was found to have sbp in 80s [**Doctor Last Name **] given IVF.
Her BNP was >4800 and trop was 0.15. She never c/o CP or SOB but
was started on a hep gtt. Cards was consulted and deemed her not
to have ACS or CHF and hep gtt was stopped. Vascular surgery was
consulted for leg ulcers and determined that she had
irreversible ischemic changes of the left lower extremitiy and
determined it is nonviable to pursue revascularization given her
underlying vascular anatomy.

She has a h/o med noncompliance, which her family confirms is
not a recent issues. Of note, she had a recent admission from
[**Date range (1) 88991**] for cdiff, CHF and venous stasis.
.
Most of history obtained from OSH records. Patient received 2mg
IV ativan prior to leaving OSH. She remarked "ouch" when moving
from stretcher to bed and said she knew she was in a hospital.
However, mostly only responsive to sternal rub.
.

.
CXR [**2130-5-4**]: The left PICC line tip is at the level of mid low
SVC. There are bilateral large pleural effusions obscuring
cardiac silhouette associated with bibasilar atelectasis. The
patient is in pulmonary edema, at least moderate. There is no
evidence of pneumothorax.
.
ECHO: [**2130-5-5**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The
right atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %)
with global hypokinesis and regional inferior, infero-septal and
apical akinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position. The diameters of aorta
at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. LVEF 20%
.
Arterial exam: Findings consistent with bilateral iliac disease,
left to a greater extent than the right. Given the history, one
must raise the question of left-sided stent occlusion.
.
EKG: NSR at 86 bpm, NA, NI, Q waves in V1-V4, STD and TWI in
III, II, avF and V6 overall unchanged
.
Renal ultrasound ([**2130-5-6**]): IMPRESSION: No renal pathology.
Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion.
.
[**5-8**] CTA abdomen, lower extremities:
IMPRESSION:

1. Severe and extensive vascular disease, which appears
longstanding with
multiple regions of collateralization.

2. Inflow:
The most severe abnormalities include a markedly narrowed aorta,
near complete occlusion of the distal aorta, with only tenous
threads of flow in the common and external iliac arteries,
occlusion of the right internal iliac artery, and occlusion of
bilateral superficial femoral arteries. Collateralization to the
popliteal arteries is more robust on the right than left via
intramuscular profunda femoral branches.
3. Outflow:
Three vessel runoff with mild right posterior tibial artery
disease on the right (anterior tibial and peroneal are patent).
Widely patent anterior tibial artery on the left, with moderate
diffuse
disease of the left peroneal and occlusion of the left posterior
tibial
artery.
4. Filling defect within the proximal branches of the SMA, which
may be
embolic in addition to the severe multivessel stenotic disease.
5. Extensive third spacing with a large right pleural effusion,
small left pleural effusion (both with significant atelectasis),
moderate ascites within the pelvis and extensive anasarca.
6. Soft tissue ulcers along both calves, however, no definite
bony
destruction to suggest osteomyelitis.
.
[**2130-5-10**] Abdomen X-ray
IMPRESSION: Nonspecific bowel gas pattern. Large right and small
left
pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
53 yo F with PMHx of CHF EF 20% (ECHO [**2130-5-5**]), recent Cdiff
infection, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic
venous stasis/peripheral vascular disease with ulcerations and
personality disorder NOS who presented to OSH ED for lower
extremity pain and edema transferred for ongoing care.
.
#Leukocytosis: Likely from C.difficile given medical
noncompliance and also from ulcers and cellulitis even
potentially osteoporosis (nothing probable to bone on exam,
though). The patient did not have signs of sepsis (mental status
changes, hypotension, lactate normal). The patient was continued
on vancomycin IV and cefepime for cellulitis. She was also
continued on vancomycin PO and flagyl IV (transitioned to PO)
for CDiff. Wound Care was consulted for management of her
cellulitis, ulcers.
.
#Altered Mental Status: Etiology likely multifactorial given
infections, likely Cdiff and cellulitis. The patient also
received ativan prior to transfer and has history of personality
