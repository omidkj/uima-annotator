endobronchial metastasis from her papillary cancer of her
thyroid.  Patient was taken to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit where patient was intubated and had a rigid bronchoscopy
that was done in the operating room by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **].
During the procedure the patient was provided with some
relief of obstruction by placing a stent and then patient was
extubated and hopsital course was complicated by a post

obstructing causing her symptoms.  Her obstruction was from a
mass secondary to the metastases from her primary cancer of

providing some relief of the obstruction but the overall
prognosis was found to be very poor.  Initially after
discussion with the family the family wanted the patient to
be in full code ad had requested that if patient did
decompensate patient be reintubated.  However, after
extensive discussion between Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], [**Doctor Last Name **] who is Russian
