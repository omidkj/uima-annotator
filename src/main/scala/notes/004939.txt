Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
Hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchial arteriogram + embolization

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 63 yo F with restrictive lung disease, severe diffuse
tracheobronchomalacia s/p endotracheal Y stent, recurrent MRSA
and psedomonal PNA, and h/o hemoptysis requiring embolization
who was admitted to OSH with hemoptysis/hematemesis and
intubated for airway protection.
.
Pt initially presented to her outpatient clinic for "feeling wet
in her chest" and coughing up blood, including some clots.  She
was evaluated urgently in pulmonary clinic where she stated she
was coughing every 2-3 hours, coughing tablespoon fulls or more
of blood/clots. She denied any recent NSAID, aspirin or
anticoagulation. She denied any fevers/chills, or purulent
sputum.
.
She was admitted to the OSH on [**7-31**]. Two days later she was
intubated for airway protection due to further hemoptysis and
for hypercarbic respiratory failure.  On [**8-2**] she was found to
be lethargic and decompensated with further hemoptysis and
paradoxically breathing using accessory muscles.  Her ABG was
7.2/111/165 on 10L NC.  She was difficult to intubate with
several attempts, finally size 7.0 ETT passed. She underwent
Bronchoscopy which noted bleeding from LUL, and was treated with
iced saline lavage (25cc) and lido, which stopped the bleeding.
No endobronchial mass noted.  Chest CT noted LUL consolidation
with probability of Aspergilloma, and she was started on
Itraconazole. She was continued on Zosyn for Pseudomonas PNA.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible embolization.

Imaging:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2161-8-3**] 9:18 PM
Findings:  Exam is limited by motion. There are low lung volumes
producing prominence of the pulmonary vasculature. There are
bibasilar streaky opacities that could represent atelectasis. No
pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
Endotracheal tube and left subclavian line are in satisfactory
position. Nasogastric tube is also in satisfactory position.
.
TRANCATHETER EMBOLIZATION [**2161-8-4**] 9:33 AM
IMPRESSION: Thoracic angiogram demonstrates marked
hypervascularity at the left upper lobe of the lung. Selective
bronchial arteriograms from the left bronchial arteries
demonstrates branches supplying this lesion were successfully
embolized with embosphere particles. Left internal mammary
arteriogram also demonstrates enlargement of the artery as well
as branches supplying that hypervascular lesion at the left
upper lobe of the lung. The branches supplying the lesion at the
left upper lobe of the lung were successfully embolized with
embosphere particles until stasis was achieved.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 63 yo F with restrictive lung disease, severe diffuse
tracheobronchomalacia s/p endotracheal Y stent, recurrent MRSA
and psedomonal PNA, and h/o hemoptysis requiring embolization
who was admitted to OSH with hemoptysis/hematemesis and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for embolization.
.
Pt arrived to [**Hospital1 18**] intubated for airway protection in the
setting of hemoptysis and for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
The following morning after transfer, pt underwent thoracic
angiogram with successful embolization of several bleeding sites
in her left upper lobe on [**8-5**].  However, prior to the
procedure, pt was noted to have low O2 sats in the 80s.  After
the procedure the pt's O2 sats improved on APRV-type
ventilation.  However, pt then became hypotensive, which was not
responsive to fluid resuscitation.  Pt was started on
norepinephrine drip to maintain MAP >60 and the ventilation
setting was changed to AC.  ABGs suggested hypercarbic + hypoxic
respiratory failure.  Active respiratory issues included
confirmed Pseudomonal PNA, pulmon edema as evidenced on CXR
(received 7L IVFs during fluid resuscitation), baseline
restrictive pulmonary disease, ?ARDS (bilateral infiltrates on
CXR), iatrogenic PE from embolization procedure, and likely
aspiration of blood/bacteria during hemoptysis episodes on
admission.  She was difficult to oxygenate and ventilate.  An
esophageal balloon was used to assess pleural pressures and her
PEEP was optimized on the ventilator settings.  Pt was
ultimately optimized on APRV.
.
While her respiratory status was deteriorating, pt's cardiac
status was also tenuous as her BP began to fall into the 70s
systolic overnight from [**2073-8-4**].  Pt was initially on
norepinephrine and phenylephrine drip, which was latter weaned
and replaced with vasopressin, in suspicion of septic shock.
Her poor respiratory status prevented additional fluids and she
was suspected to be fluid overloaded.  Pt eventually required
maximum doses of NE, vasopressin and phenylephrine to keep her
SBPs in the 70-80s, MAPs in 60s.  In addition, pt was
increasingly acidotic from non-anion gap metabolic acidosis
(suspected RTA), anion gap metabolic acidosis (likely lactic
acidosis, lactate levels up to 9), and respiratory acidosis; pt
was receiving bicard with minimal temporary improvement in BP.
On morning of [**8-6**], pt went into V. Tach and PEA, CPR was
initiated and sustained for ~20 min.  Pt was pronounced dead.
Family was notified.
