Service:  MICU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fever and mental status changes.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83-year-old male with
a history of progressive [**Last Name (un) 309**] body dementia and a seizure
disorder who was a resident of [**Hospital3 **] with a
recent general functional decline (since two months) that has
manifested as a decrease interactiveness, recent anorexia
(refused orals), and decrease functional ability (activities
of daily living).

He was noted by his neurologist to be likely progressing with
his dementia, as recently as [**2103-6-21**].  He was started on
Sinemet at that time.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He presented to [**Hospital1 190**] with fevers of 102 degrees Fahrenheit, a heart
rate of 112, and a blood pressure that was 90/palp, and a
respiratory rate of 36, and saturating 100% on 15 liters with
decreased urine output.  He was also noted to be unresponsive
on admission.

A chest x-ray was consistent with a right middle lobe
infiltrate.  He was given levofloxacin, and vancomycin, as
well as Flagyl for presumed pneumonia versus urinary tract
sepsis.   He was hypotensive with a poor response to fluid
boluses (he was given a total of 8 liters in the Emergency
Department).  He was started on a dopamine drip with no
response.  He was switched to Neo-Synephrine with an
increased blood pressure and arousability.

He was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where
his hypotension worsened, requiring a second pressor
(Vasopressin), plus fluid boluses.  He became increasingly
acidotic with lactate initially at 8 that increased to 20.7
during the evening of [**7-4**].  He also had worsening
bicarbonate levels from 25 initially, decreasing to 6.

He was intubated with a pre-intubation arterial blood gas
that was 7.04/22/122.  Post intubation, his arterial blood
gas was 7.11/23/215 on 50% oxygen.  He was given sodium
bicarbonate followed by a sodium bicarbonate drip.  His
antibiotics were continued, and he was given stress-dose
steroids for presumptive adrenal insufficiency in the setting
of sepsis.  Levophed was added on as another pressor for
hypotension.

Blood cultures from earlier that day in the Emergency
Department grew gram-negative rods, and the patient was
started on ceftazidime.  He was also noted to have severe
coagulopathy and was treated aggressively with fresh frozen
plasma and vitamin K.  He was also transfused several units
of packed red blood cells for a rapidly decreasing hematocrit
in the setting of fluid restriction.

Despite all of these aggressive interventions (including
triple pressors), the patient's mean arterial pressure
remained in the 40s, and his heart rate started to drop.

At 5:45 p.m., on [**2103-7-6**], he became asystolic on the
monitor.  His pupils became fixed and dilated, and he
expired.  His sister was present and refused the autopsy at
that time.  The attending, as well as the [**Hospital3 1761**], were notified of his death.
