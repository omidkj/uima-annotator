Syncope

Left Heart Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
68M s/p anterior STEMI [**2142-8-25**] with placement of BMS x2 to LAD,
systolic CHF with LVEF 35%, h/o AF who presents after syncopal
episode at home today. Pt. was feeling well since discharge from
[**Hospital1 18**]. This afternoon, he was taking his warfarin with liquids
when he felt the sensation as if the liquid "went down the wrong
pipe". Denies coughing, but did note sharp pain in lower
neck/upper sternum that lasted seconds and did not radiate, did
not feel similar to CP with prior MI. He then "felt his head
going down", unsure if this was voluntary or not, and that was
his last recollection before losing consciousness. LOC x
10-30sec, fall unwitnessed, fell from 30" stool onto floor,
+head trauma. His daughter who was in the next room heard a
distressed sound around this time and came in to investigate.
His next memory is being awoken by his daughter. [**Name (NI) **] was confused
for a few seconds and then oriented and alert. Denies tongue
bite or olfactory aura. Denies tunnel vision or presyncope. He
has not noted any discharge from his life vest. Denies
SOB/F/C/orthopnea/PND/LE edema/visual changes/headache/focal
neuro deficits. He also reports that his last 2 voids have been
darker than usual but denies suprapubic pain and reports normal
UOP recently.
.
He presented to the [**Hospital1 69**] ED on
[**2142-8-25**] with 3 days of heartburn. Initial electrocardiogram
revealed anterior ST elevation and a STEMI was diagnosed. He
received aspirin Plavix, nitroglycerin, Integrilin, heparin and
IV metoprolol. He was transferred to the cath lab. Cath revealed
three-vessel disease with total mid vessel occlusion of the LAD
90% mid-vessel occlusion of the left circumflex and 80%
occlusion of the right coronary artery. 2 bare metal stents were
placed in the mid LAD region. There was a significant anterior
thigh hematoma complicating the catheterization which improved
prior to discharge with stable hematocrits. ICU course was
notable for persistent ST elevation, thought to be related to LV
aneurysm. He was also placed on colchicine for possible
pericardial inflammation post MI. The patient underwent echo
which demonstrated a small apical aneurysm without evidence of
mural thrombus. His ejection fraction was 30%. During the
hospitalization he had a brief course of atrial fibrillation and
spontaneously cardioverted to sinus rhythm. EP was consulted for
?ICD and recommended no implantable ICD but he was discharged
with a life vest (external ICD). Hospital course was also
notable for gross hematuria with clot formation and he underwent
continuous bladder irrigation after urology consultation. This
irrigation resulted in clearance of blood and resolution of the
bladder pain that he was experiencing.
.
In the ED, initial VS: 98 80 102/56 20 100%RA. EKG notable for
SR 78, LAD, NI, q's V2-4 (old), STE V2-3 (old), TWI ant/lat
(new). Exam revealed head laceration. Labs and imaging
significant for WBC 12 with normal diff, INR 3, BUN 30, Cr 1.6,
troponin 0.08 (previous peak 7.46). He was given a tetanus
booster and 7 staples were placed on his head laceration after
wound was thoroughly irrigated. NCHCT showed no acute
intracranial process and right frontoparietal laceration with
staples in place. CXR showed improved aeration compared to
prior. Atrius cardiology was consulted and recommended admission
to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] for syncope. Patient given tetanus booster and local epi
for sutures. Vitals on transfer: 98 76 122/70 18-24 98% RA.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient feels well except for some
soreness in the area of his head laceration. He denies
CP/SOB/HA/suprapubic pain.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, or palpitations.
