Chief Complaint:
"severe metabolic acidosis with concern for DKA."


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo F with diabetes, Parkinson's disease, dementia, urinary
retention and overflow incontinence, initially presenting on
[**2193-8-17**] for altered mental status. In the ED, she was noted to
be febrile, with lactate 3.7 and signficant pyuria. She was
admitted to medicine, and was intially treated for UTI with
vancomycin and cefepime. MICU is now consulted for metabolic
acidosis.
.
Upon evaluation by MICU team while on medicine floor, the
patient was lying in bed with a normal blood pressure and heart
rate. She was tachypneic, oriented only to self. ABG 7.38/25/92,
with lactate 4.0 (from 1.8 yesterday). The patient's fingerstick
was >400 this morning. Urine ketones 150. WBC has been rising
since admission. Of note, the patient was admitted for DKA from
[**Date range (1) 104414**]. Review of prior micro data reveals a history of
MRSA but not of ESBL organisms. Blood and urine cultures from
this admission were pending. Per floor team, patient also has
stage II decubitus ulcer. She had been having frequent but small
volume diarrhea.
.
Review of systems is unobtainable due to the patient's mental
status.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with Parkinson's disease, dementia,
DM, anemia, urinary retention & overflow incontinence who
intially presented with altered mental status found to be in
DKA. Precipitant was initially thought to be UTI given patient's
grossly positive urinalysis. Patient's course was complicated by
pneumonia and C.diff infection.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES BY PROBLEM:
.
#Diabetic ketoacidosis: Precipitant was likely multiple
infections as below. Patient has history of DKA during prior
admission also in the setting of urosepsis. She was fluid
resuscitated, was placed on insulin drip at 4 units/hr, received
D5 NS until resolution of DKA. Lytes were checked Q2hrs and
repleted accordingly. After resucitation she was volume
overloaded and required 10mg IV Lasix which she responded with
brisk UOP. Patient's gap closed and her ketosis and lactic
acidosis improved.  Patient was discharged to hospice with NPH
[**Hospital1 **] only.
.
#Urinary Tract Infection: Patient's urinalysis was grossly
positive on admission, though culture data could not be obtained
to confirm this. This was thought to be the likely contributing
precipitant of patient's diabetic ketoacidosis. Patient was
started on vancomycin and cefepime due to her stay in [**Hospital1 1501**].  She
completed 9 days of treatment and had been afebrile for several
days before discharge to hospice.
.
#Hospital-acquired pneumonia: Patient's chest x-ray on [**8-19**]
showed signs of new right-sided pneumonia. DDx included
aspiration PNA versus hospital-acquired. Patient was tachypneic,
mildly febrile and with persistent leukocytosis but otherwise
asymptomatic with no cough or sputum production. Patient's
cefepime was re-dosed to treat for pneumonia a
