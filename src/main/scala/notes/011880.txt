Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation, Bronscopy, A-line

History of Present Illness:
63 y/o F w/COPD, OSA, RSD, GERD, who presented to [**Hospital **]
Hospital tonight c/o dyspnea.  Per their notes, she had four
days of increasing shortness of breath, "raspy breathing", and
leg edema.  Pt nods her head yes when asked if she has
increasing swelling in her legs and difficulty breathing when
lying flat, says no when asked about cough.  En route to their
hospital she developed 8/10 chest pain.  On arrival, she was
tachycardic in the 100s, hypertensive to the 140s/60s,
saturating 91% on a NRB.  She was given nitro paste and lasix 60
mg IV.  She continued to have chest and abd pain, and was given
morphine 10 mg IV and pepcid 20 mg IV.  She also received
compazine 10 mg, levofloxacin 500 mg IV, and solumedrol 125 mg
IV.  She put out 1600 cc to the lasix.  Her ABG was 7.41/48/55
and it was decided to transfer her to [**Hospital1 **] for further care.
.
In our ED, her vitals were 103.4, 109, 110/70 (ranging
100s-170s/50s-70s).  RR initially 19 with O2 sat 88% on NRB.
She was emergently intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure.
Her ABG here (per ED resident was a preintubation ABG but was
after she had been intubated x 5 minutes?) 7.38/56/77 (so was on
either 100% NRB vs intubated with 100% FiO2).  She was given an
additional 250 mg levofloxacin, as well as etomidate,
succinylcholine, propofol, versed, fentanyl, and tylenol.  She
was admitted to the MICU for respiratory failure.

Admission Chest Xray:Endotracheal tube terminating just above
the carina. Cardiomegaly with mild volume overload versus mild
CHF.  Widened superior mediastinum which can be positional.
Opacities in both lower lobes representing combination of
atelectasis and pneumonia.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11315**] was informed by
telephone at 2:00 a.m. on the day of the study. Enlarged cardiac
contour raises the possibility of pericardial effusion.

Admission ECG: Baseline artifact. Probable sinus tachycardia.
Low voltage. Late R wave progression. Since the previous tracing
of [**2167-9-11**] limb lead QRS voltage has diminished.

TTE: The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded.  Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
 mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear  structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mitral regurgitation is  seen. There is borderline
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no  pericardial
effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of  [**2168-4-15**], there is no definite change.

IMPRESSION:  No evidence of DVT.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, this is a 63 year-old F w/obesity, COPD, CAD, CHF
and diet controlled DM, who presented with hypoxic respiratory
failure requiring intubation..
.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to pneumonia
given her fever, bandemia, infiltrates on chest xray.  Has
significant A-a gradient based on her initial ABG (on 100%
FiO2).  Also may have several other contributing factors,
including chronic hypercarbia likely from COPD, OSA, restriction
due to habitus.  Other obvious concern is that this is CHF or
complicated by CHF, given history of worsening LE edema and
orthopnea.  Chest xray was consistent with both pneumonia and
edema.  She was started on broad spectrum antibiotics.
.
Bronchoscopy on [**2-12**] demonstrated substantial secretions and
likely mucous plug obstructing right-middle lobe which was
cleared, with subsequent re-expansion of RML.  TTE was negative
for tamponade or wall motion abnormality and unchanged from
prior.  LENIs were obtained and were negative for DVT.  Multiple
sputum cultures were sent and grew out staph aureus, methacillin
sensitive.  She was initially treated with broad spectrum
antibiotics, but coverage was eventually narrowed to
levofloxacin (she has a penicillin allergy).  She was extubated
successfully on [**2172-2-16**].  Strongly recommend follow-up with a
pulmonologist and sleep study.  She was also diuresed with
improvement in her respiratory status.
.
# CHF: Amlodipine and captopril were initially held. Gentle
diuresis was performed. TTE showed mild symmetric LVH. LVEF>55%.
No AR, no MR. Borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No pericardial effusion.  Unchanged from echo [**2168-4-15**].
.
# DM: placed on humalog sliding scale with good control of blood
sugar.
.
# Hyperlipidemia:  Atorvastatin was continued
.
# Psychiatric:  Cont depakote, tiagabine.  Restarted Xanax once
extubated and since off sedation, but a dose lower than home
regimen.
.
# RSD:  Has indwelling morphine pump. Will need pain consult on
[**2-21**] to refill pump.
.
# FEN: While intubated, received tube feeds for nutrition.
Nursing was concerned that on thin liquids might have some
aspiration; no difficulty with thickened liquids.  Transitioned
to regular diet with thickened liquids; recommend speech and
swallow evaluation (ordered but not performed at time of
transfer).
.
# Ppx: pneumoboots, recieved SC heparin and [**Hospital1 **] Pantoprazole
40mg per home regimen.
.
# Code Status: Full
.
Discharged to [**Hospital6 **] on [**2172-2-16**] at patient
request given improvement in respiratory status.
