Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2291**]
Chief Complaint:
Continued shortness of breath, hypoxia and hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC placement [**2172-11-20**]


History of Present Illness:
86 year old male with history of chronic aspiration, COPD (no
PFTs), t2DM, history of PE s/p IVC filter placement and
dementia, presenting with shortness of breath and hypotension.
He is usually on 2L O2, satting in the low 90s, but he was
requiring a non-rebreather to sat 86% on 4L NRB prior to
arrival. He was also noted to be hypotensive to the SBP of 80s
as well. He has not had any fevers, and has otherwise been doing
well since discharge. Though he is a chronic aspiration risk
(evaluated by speech and swallow to have aspiration to all
consistencies), he has continued to eat by his insistence. The
relationship of eating to his hypoxia is unclear. On arrival to
the ED, the patient was not in respiratory distress. He vomited
x1 at [**Hospital3 2558**] as well. He has a known history of
hypotension with ?adrenal insufficiency, previously treated with
fludrocortisone.
In the ED, initial VS were: T 96.5, HR 120, BP 85/60, RR 20, 94%
on 4L. CXR showed diffuse infiltration both lungs, concerning
for aspiration. He was given Vancomycin, Cefepime, and Flagyl
for broad-spectrum coverage as well as stress-dose hydrocort and
1.5L NS for hypotension. In accordance with his wishes, no
central venous lines were attempted and peripheral levophed was
started temporarily until goals of care could be clarified in
the intensive care unit.
.
As was clarified on the discharge summary from [**2172-11-12**], the
goals of care were supposed to be oriented towards avoiding
re-hospitalization and other invasive procedures. He and the
family are fully aware of the risks of aspiration from continued
eating. At [**Hospital3 2558**], they were not able to commit the
family and patient to a Do-Not-Hospitalize order and but did
agree to DNR/DNI. The patient has had numerous admissions (to
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**], MICU [**Location (un) **], and medicine floors) for similar issues and
goals of care have been discussed at each visit without any
progress further than DNR/DNI.
.
On arrival to the MICU, he is on a non-rebreather in no acute
distress with continued SBPs in the 80s, despite fluid
resuscitation in the ED. He is adamantly refusing another IV
placement in his arm, saying that 1 is enough. He is trying to
communicate with the nurses and is wide awake.
.

Imaging:
[**2172-11-18**] ECG: rate 116, Sinus tachycardia. Non-specific ST
segment changes. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2172-11-10**]
precordial T wave changes are less prominent.
[**2172-11-18**] CXR: Emphysema with persistent airspace opacities
involving the mid and lower lungs concerning for pneumonia with
possible component of pulmonary edema.
[**2172-11-20**] CXR: New PICC line was inserted through the left arm
with its tip being at the level of mid SVC. Heart size and
mediastinum are stable including extensive calcifications in the
aortic arch. Widespread parenchymal consolidations seen
bilaterally appear to be unchanged or minimally improved, in
particular at the mid left lung zone. No interval development of
pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
