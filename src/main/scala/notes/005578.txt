History of Present Illness:
71M with h/o GOLD stage III COPD s/p 2 intubations, moderate
pulm HTN, cryptogenic/alcoholic cirrhosis with portal HTN and
varices, admitted to [**Location (un) **] with dyspnea, cough productive of
frothy sputum and bilateral leg swelling and transferred to the
MICU for hypercarbic respiratory distress and concern for sick
sinus.
.
Pt reports that his symptoms started 3-4 weeks ago with
worsening swelling, redness and itching and tenderness in BL
calfs. He also reports that 3-4 days ago, he reports progressive
shortness of breath and cough productive of frothy white sputum;
no phlegm or hemoptysis. He has not been taking any of his
medications including his inhalers or diuretics for the past [**3-9**]
days either; he reports this is because "I'm on too many pills."
 Also endorses recent salt load, saying he has been eating lots
of bacon and eggs with breakfast. Has continued smoking 1.5 PPD
throughout. Denies fevers/chills, night sweats, known recent
sick contacts.  Denies chest pain/pressure, pleuritic pain.  No
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting. Currently reports that his
mental status feels altered, "zero" out of 10.  Denies any
headaches, double vision, blurry vision, loss of time,
unintentional movements or urinary/fecal incontinence.  Denies
recent increase in abdominal girth.
.
Of note, pt recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 65656**] for
respiratory failure [**2-7**] COPD, CAP and acute diastolic CHF,
requiring ICU stay and intubation; also severely hyponatremic at
that time. Symptoms resolved with steroid pulse, aggressive
diuresis to dry weight (163 lb) and antibiotics. He was
discharged on prednisone taper, PO lasix (given brisk response
to diuresis), spironolactone, advair and nebs.
.
In the ED, initial VS were T 99.9 P 108 BP 130/67 RR 18 SaO2 97%
on NRB. He was hypoxic to high 80's on RA on arrival (baseline
per last PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 626**]).  Lungs with bilateral rhonchi throughout.
Labs were significant for Na 125, K 5.2, BNP 5503, Troponin
0.06, WBC 7.8, PMNs 81.4. EKG showed sinus tachycardia with
PACs. CXR showed slight pulmonary edema. LENIs negative BL. He
was given solumedrol, azithromycin, duonebs and ceftriaxone and
transferred to the floor.
.
On the floor, initial VS notable for RR 22, SaO2 low 90s on 4L.
He was started on tele and found to have HR between 100-150;
repeat EKG showed sinus tachycardia but no ST changes,
subsequently with HR dropped to 40s; pt A&Ox3 with bradycardia,
though lethargic. Per his respiratory status, pt was felt to
have a COPD exacerbation complicated by CHF exacerbation and he
was given Lasix 40 IV.  Per transfer, @20:00 pt with increased
work of breathing, and seem "off" to his family.  His O2 sat was
87-93 on 3L throughout the day, but went down to 80 so he was
increased to 4L NC.  ABG at the time was 7.29/65/116.
.
Upon transfer to MICU, VS were BP 110/60, HR 100, RR 26, O2 98%
4L (79% on 3L).  Pt notable for labile HR, with multiple
bradycardic episodes to HR of 40s, baseline in 70s.  Also with
waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status (somnolent to speaking
coherently and c/w prior history); no clear correlation with
changes in heartrate.  Pt O2 sat high-90s on non-rebreather.
Currently, most concerned with BL LE edema.

[**2159-11-15**] ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size
and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%).
Doppler parameters are indeterminate for left ventricular
diastolic function. The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with normal free wall contractility. The ascending aorta
is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: normal biventricular systolic function.
Indeterminate indices to assess diastolic function.
Dilated right ventricle with moderate tricuspid regurgitation
and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

[**2159-11-15**] EKG:
Normal sinus rhythm. Compared to tracing #2, except for an
increase in the
rate from 42 to 73 no diagnostic interval change.

[**2159-11-15**] CXR:
There is prominence of the bronchovascular markings, which
appear stable
dating back to multiple films. There is improved aeration at the
right base since the prior study. There is no pneumothoraces or
definite consolidation or pleural effusions. There is
cardiomegaly, which is stable.
