History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 7796**] is a [**Age over 90 **]F with a PMH s/f critical aortic stenosis s/p
recent valvuloplasty in [**7-/2123**] who presented to [**Hospital3 4107**]
with right groin pain.  The patient was admitted [**Date range (2) 9390**]
for complaints of dyspnea. A cardiac catheterization was
performed to determine the etiology.  After evaluation of the
coronary arteries showed no culprit lesion that was amenable to
PCI, the team proceeded with an aortic balloon valvulotomy, as
they felt the dyspnea was likely secondary to her critical AS.
At the conclusion of the case it was noted that patient was
forming a massive right groin hematoma.  She was transiently
hypotensive, and required three units of pRBCs, fluids,
dopamine, and neosynephrine.  She was able to be weaned off
within 30 minutes.
.
At [**Hospital3 4107**] the patient was noted to be hypotensive.  She
was started on peripheral dopamine, transfused 2 units of blood,
and transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.  In the ED
initial vitals were HR 106, BP 88/56, RR 20, O2 Sat 85% 3L.
Patient was maintained on neosynephrine and weaned off dopamine
with resolution of tachycardia. CT scan was obtained and patient
was admitted to CCU.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old woman with CAD s/p CABG, critical aortic stenosis
s/p valvulotomy, presenting with right groin pain, hypotension
and respiratory distress, found to have a large right groin
hematoma requiring a total of 3 transfusions at [**Hospital3 **]
and 9 transfusions at [**Hospital1 18**].  On day of discharge, Hct had been
stable for 3 days.  Shortness of breath had imprvoed to the
point that pt could lie supine without supplemental O2.  And ARF
resolved with Creatinine back to baseline of 1.5.
.
# BLOOD LOSS/ HEMATOMA/ HYPOTENSION: Hct stable at 25 for 3 days
prior to discharge.  No interval change on serial abdominal CT
scans during hospital stay.  Pt's blood pressure is tolerating
Beta blocker at time of discharge.  Restarting ACE inhibitor is
deferred to pt's PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was discontinued indefinitely and
ASA was reduced to 81mg qd given the extent of the RP bleed.
.
# CORONARIES: Last cardiac catheterization with patent LIMA and
SVG grafts. Native vessels with discrete lesions of mid LAD, OM1
and distal circumflex, as well as diffuse RCA disease. S/P BMS
to LM and LCx. Also with known 50% left subclavian artery
stenosis. On Statin.
-- Bare metal Stents placed [**2117-2-1**], safe to discontinue [**Month/Day/Year 4532**]
-- continue ASA at 81 mg qd and continue statin
.
# PUMP: Last EF slightly improved to 45% with inferior akinesis,
mild AR and severe AS. Also 2+ MR and 2+ TR
-- Re-start home dose Lasix 20 mg [**Hospital1 **]
-- defer restarting Ace-i to primary care
.
# RHYTHM: At baseline sinus rhythm with left bundle branch
block. Pacemaker in place for tachy-brady syndrome
-- Pt noted to be in atrial flutter for 30 seconds overnight (no
symptoms reported), given that this was an isolated event and
that the pt has a contraindication to anticoagulation, coumadin
was not started.
.
# ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Creatinine today 1.5, within
baseline 1.3 - 1.6. Improved with resolved hypotension.
.
# Pneumonia: Retrocardiac opacity discovered on CXR. Treat
Levofloxacin for 10 days (until [**2123-9-12**]). Increased dose to 750
mg q48 hr based on improving renal function. So far negative
blood cultures. Patient afebrile.
.
# Guaiac positive stool: Stool brown/green in colour per nurse.
No bright red blood. Not acutely bleeding. Should be followed up
as outpatient.
