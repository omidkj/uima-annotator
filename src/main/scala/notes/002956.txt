Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Chief Complaint: Bradycadia
.
Reason for MICU transfer: hyperkalemia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Attempt to remove a blood clot from the AV graft (thrombectomy),
not successful
placement of left subclavian tunnelled hemodialysis line


History of Present Illness:
68 year old female with ESRD on HD who presented from AV Care
with bradycardia to the 30. The pt went to her normal HD
yesterday at the [**Hospital **] Clinic where her R AVG was
found to be thrombosed. She was unable to get her HD, last HD
was last Friday. She set up for a thrombectomy at AV Care today,
but when on the table for the procedure, her heart rate was
noted to be 32. The procedure was aborted and the patient and
sent to the ER for evaluation.
.
K on arrival to the ED was 7.4. Bradycardic to the 30s with a
junctional rhythm. She received Calcium, insulin, and D50 with
improvement in K to 6.9 and HR to 60s. Renal and transplant
surgery were both contact[**Name (NI) **] in the [**Name (NI) **]. She was noted to be going
back into a junctional rhythm prior to transfer. Another 2g of
calcium carbonate were ordered, but there were no doses
availible in the ED. She is being admitted for emergent HD.
.
On the floor, she has no complaints other than being hungry.

Social History:
She is married. She and her husband are independent in their
ADLs. She emmigrated from Barbados in [**2084**]. She used to work
baby sitting for a physician here at [**Hospital1 18**], but she is not

She has 2 siblings with DM2 and one of her children as well, who
also has CKD.

Echo:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There
is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Right ventricular hypertrophy. Diastolic dysfunction. No
pathologic valvular abnormality seen. No evidence of restrictive
filling of left ventricle. The findings could be consistent with
infiltrative process but are more likely due to effects of
hypertension/renal failure.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2103-7-5**],
mild symmetric LVH and right ventricular hypertrophy are seen on
the current tracing.

Brief Hospital Course:
68yo F with ESRD, type II DM, and HTN who missed HD yesterday
[**2-4**] graft thrombosis who presented to the ED after thrombectomy
was aborted in the setting of bradycardia.
.
# Bradycardia: Initial junctiona rhythm resolved with HD and
resolution of hyperkalemia. On HD 3, patient had sinus
bradycardia with ventricular escape beats.  Potassium was not
elevated at the time.  EP felt related to high doses nodal
agents for BP control. Her labetolol and am clonidine were held,
she underwent HD, and her rhythm improved.  BPs remained in the
130s for most of the day but eventually increased to 190.  Per
discussion with patient??????s nephrologist we continued nifedipine
and hydralazine. Clonidine was given in place of home guafacine.
Pt did not have any more bradycardic episodes and remained in
sinus rythm in the 60s for teh rest of the admission.  LFTs
checked for reduced hepatic clearance of labetolol? but were
normal. D/c home on regimen of nifedipine, hydralazine, and
guafacine. Her regimen will be further adjusted by her
nephrologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4883**].
.
# Hypertension: Had restarted home regimen (labetolol,
nifedipine, hydralazine, clonidine in place of home guafacine),
but pt developed a second episode of bradycardia concerning for
medication toxicity (see above).  She required a nitro gtt for
control on hospital day #1, but for > 24 hours prior to
discharge she maintained BP < 180 on just nifedapine, clonidone,
hydralazine (held labetolol).
.
# Thrombosed HD graft: IR unable to perform thrombectomy. Got
tunneled HD line.
She will need a thrombectomy to reopen her AV graft. She is
scheduled to follow up at [**Hospital **] Care Center with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
# ESRD: Awaiting transplant. Continued nephrocaps. Low K/phos
diet, and phos binder was uptitrated.
.
# DM: Pt takes 30 units of 50/50 [**Hospital1 **]. Had some hypoglecemia,
maintained just on sliding scale while admitted. Per pt, eats
more sugary food at home. resume home regimen upon d/c.
.
# Asthma: Well-controlled per pt history. Con't home Advair with
albuterol PRN.
