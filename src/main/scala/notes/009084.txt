Brief Hospital Course:
74 yo male with multiple medical problems presented to [**Hospital1 18**]
from OSH with dyspnea thought to be caused by tracheal stenosis.
Patient arrived complaining of fevers, chills, SOB, DOE. Patient
was admitted to the ICU, started on Abx and thought to have
tracheal malacia and was scheduled for rigid bronch on [**6-17**]. The
bronch was performed without difficulty and the previous stent
was removed and the patient was found to have a tracheal tear
and significant stenosis in the upper trachea and subglottic and
glottic regions. During the postoperative check the CXR showed a
moderate right pneumothorax for which a chest tube was placed. A
tracheostomy was performed the following day along with a bronch
and upper endoscopy [**6-18**]. The patient remained in the SICU
postop and was weaned off the vent to trach mask on [**6-21**]. The
patient was found to have C-diff and MRSA PNA on [**6-23**] and was
treated with the appropriate antibiotics. The patient progressed
well and was transferred to the floor on [**6-24**] and was started on
anticoagulation for his a-fib with coumadin and lovenox bridge.
ENT also evaluated the patient for his tracheal stenosis and
recommended placing the patient on aspiration precautions and
starting him on Nexium which were all done. The patient was also
given a swallowing evaluation which recommended soft solids,
thin liquids. The patient was in good condition throughout his
transfer to the floor therefore the decision was made to
transfer the patient to rehab.
