History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 20246**] is a 56yo female with multiple medical issues
including severe gastroparesis who underwent colonoscopy on
[**2166-2-6**] for removal of a polyp seen during prior screening
procudure (she had been anticoagulated at the time of the first
study). She returned home last evening with some mild
discomfort. She subsequently developed the acute onset of severe
right-sided abdominal pain in morning. She denied any fever or
chills, some nausea, but no emesis. She feels uable to tolerate
oral intake. She is passing flatus. No dysuria.

Past Medical History:
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Weight loss/diabetic gastroparesis/functional dyspepsia. See

HPI.
2. Chronic pain. She has a history of chronic abdominal pain
due to T-spine compression fracture. as well as DJD of the knee.

She has been on narcotics episodically over the past several
years, though this was recently completely discontinued. She
uses a lidocaine patch, Lyrica, Flexeril, capsaicin cream, and
has recently started titrating a tricyclic medication. She also

uses a TENS unit p.r.n. and is followed at the Pain Center.
3. History of depression/anxiety. She is followed by a private
psychiatrist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 20247**], [**State 2748**]). On Effexor, trazodone,
and clonazepam.
4. History DVTs/PEs. She had a negative coagulopathy work-up in

the past for this. All of her DVTs have occurred in the setting

of immobility except for a clot noted on an IVC filter this
year,
which prompted restarting of anticoagulation with Lovenox.
5. History of MRSA bacteremia. Hospitalized for this at [**Hospital 1012**]
Hospital.
6. History of [**Female First Name (un) 564**] bacteremia. Felt due to J-tube.
7. History of C. difficile colitis. Treated with Flagyl.
8. History of asthma. She has had several severe episodes in
the past, sometimes requiring hospitalization (also intubated).

She has had very [**Last Name **] problem with her asthma over the past
year on her current regimen. She has a pulmonologist in

gastroparesis. Her glucose control has come under control with
weight loss, not currently on diabetic medication.
10. History of venous insufficiency. She reports a history of
venous ulcers in the past, recently quiescent.
11. Colonic polyps. Colonoscopy on [**2165-11-22**] revealed a polyp
in the transverse colon. Resection was not attempted since she
is anticoagulated.
12. Problems with continuity of care. There have been
difficulties with continuity of care in the past, partly due to

her distance from [**Hospital1 **] and use of other facilities in [**State 2748**]

(e.g. [**Hospital 1012**] Hospital). There have also been difficulties tracking

narcotic use in the past and problems with [**Name2 (NI) 20248**] to her
narcotic contract. Over the past year she has made an effort to

transfer all of her care to [**Hospital1 18**]. She currently only receives
care outside of [**Hospital1 18**] for physical therapy, pulmonology, and
psychiatry.

[**Year/Month/Day 706**]  Final Report
CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST  [**2166-2-7**] 7:54 PM
Reason: please eval for evidence of micro perf**gastrograffin
please
HISTORY: Post-colonoscopy yesterday with severe right lower
quadrant pain.
IMPRESSION: Extensive free air which in consideration with the
history provided is likely due to perforation of the colon.
However, please note, no extravasated contrast is identified and
a definite source has not been noted. The study is limited
secondary to lack of IV contrast. Suggestion of possible
pneumatosis of the small bowel. Please note pneumatosis may be
seen following colonoscopy although it is curious that it may be
affecting the small bowel. This also may be artifactual and due
to free air. It is difficult to assess without benefit of IV
contrast or more proximal oral contrast.

   [**Year/Month/Day 706**]  Final Report
PORTABLE ABDOMEN  [**2166-2-8**] 5:23 PM
Reason: assess for interval change
HISTORY: Abdominal pain. History of free air post colonoscopy.
FINDINGS: This study is a single supine film of the abdomen and
therefore is not sufficient to assess for free air. Contrast is
seen in the colon with prominent outlining of the wall of the
colon on the right suggesting free air in this region. For
further assessment of possible perforation, a CT scan may be
needed if clinically indicated.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 20246**] was evaluated in the ED for RLQ pain that started after
a colonoscopy the day prior. An abdominal CT scan revealed
intraperitoneal free air indicating a possible perforation. In
addition, the patient was experiencing acute abdominal pain. A
central line was inserted due to poor peripheral venous access.
Her pain was treated with IV Dilaudid, and IV levaquin & flagyl
were started. She was transferred to the SICU for closer
monitoring.
.
HD1: She remained NPO with IV fluid hydration, IV antibiotics,
and pain management. Blood cultures were collected due to mild
leukocytosis to rule out sepsis. VRE & MRSA cultures were
collected as well due to past history of MRSA bacteremia. Her
vitals signs remained stable, and her pain was moderately
managed with IV Dilaudid. She was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name **] for
further monitoring.
.
HD2-HD6: She continued with IV antibiotics with decrease in WBC,
and remained afebrile. Her diet was advanced as her bowel
function resumed, and her pain decreased. She was transitioned
to regular food with supplemental shakes and PO Percocet which
she tolerated well. Iv antibiotics were switched to PO. She will
continue 4 more days of antibiotic therapy. She was able to
ambulate safely with bilateral leg braces in place.Her central
line was removed. She was discharged home. No services required.
She will follow-up with her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], and Orthopedist. She was
advised to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with any abdominal
complaints.
