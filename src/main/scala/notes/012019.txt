Admission Date:  [**2169-8-29**]       Discharge Date:  [**2169-9-4**]

Date of Birth:   [**2106-11-13**]       Sex:  M

Service:  CARDIAC SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62-year-old
white male with a past medical history significant for
coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, and hypercholesterolemia.  The patient originally
presented with unstable angina at the end of [**2169-9-29**].  At that time, the patient experienced sudden onset of
shortness of breath, dyspnea, and lightheadedness.  He
eventually presented to an outside hospital, which revealed
possible inferior ST changes.  A cardiac catheterization was
performed, which revealed three vessel coronary artery
disease.  The patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] to be evaluated for a possible
coronary artery bypass graft.

On the day of admission, the patient was feeling well,
denying any chest pain or shortness of breath.  He came in on
an intravenous heparin drip.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension
2.  Coronary artery disease
3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
4.  Anxiety
5.  Obesity

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  No significant surgical history

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:
1.  Paxil
2.  Effexor
3.  Lipitor
4.  Aspirin

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's temperature was 97.2,
heart rate 72, blood pressure 128/77, oxygen saturation 94%
on room air.  He was in no apparent distress.  His head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat examination was within normal
limits.  There was no jugular venous distention.  There were
no bruits.  He was clear to auscultation, although decreased
breath sounds throughout.  His abdomen was obese, nontender,
nondistended, with no hernia or masses palpable.  He had
decreased bowel sounds.  Extremities showed no edema, were
warm and well perfused.  He had palpable dorsalis pedis and
posterior tibial pulses bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  Hematocrit 41.1, white blood cell count
8.0, platelets 268.  PT 12.8, PTT 43.7, INR 1.1.  Glucose 79,
BUN 15, creatinine 1.0, sodium 141, potassium 4.0.  Chest
x-ray obtained on [**2169-8-29**] showed no evidence of acute
cardiopulmonary disease.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to Cardiac
Surgery.  At the time, given three vessel disease on cardiac
catheterization, it was thought that a surgical solution
would be the best approach.  On [**2169-8-30**], the patient
underwent coronary artery bypass graft x 3, with left
internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending,
reverse saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal, branch
of the circumflex and reverse saphenous vein graft of the
right coronary artery.  The patient tolerated the procedure
well.  There were no complications.  Please see the full
operative report for details.

The patient was transported to the Cardiac Intensive Care
Unit postoperatively.  The patient remained intubated.  The
Swan-Ganz catheter was in place.  The patient had chest tubes
in place.  On the same day, the patient was extubated without
incident.  The patient was encouraged pulmonary toilet.

On postoperative day one, the patient remained in the
Intensive Care Unit.  He was tolerating ice chips without
complaints of nausea.  He remained Neo-Synephrine dependent
despite additional fluid, with systolic blood pressures in
the 90 to 100 range.  His BUN, creatinine and white cell
count remained stable, as did his hematocrit.

Physical Therapy was consulted and worked with the patient
daily.  The patient was consequently transferred to the
regular Cardiac floor.  He remained stable.  His pacing wires
were discontinued.  His chest tubes were first put to water
seal and then removed as well.  He continued to be diuresed
and beta blocked as per protocol.  He was on aspirin.  The
patient continued to make significant progress with physical
therapy.  He was eventually cleared by Physical Therapy to go
home.  The patient remained in sinus rhythm.
