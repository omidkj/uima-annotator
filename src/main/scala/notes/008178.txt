CXR: Comparison with [**2131-10-22**]. Again seen is plate like
linear atelectasis at both lung bases. The cardiac contour
remains enlarged. Again demonstrated are bilateral diffuse
interstitial and alveolar opacities consistent with CHF,
fibrosis, infection or inflammation. Probable small bilateral
pleural effusions. COPD.
.
LENI RLE: There is marked subcutaneous and interstitial edema
within the right leg. There is normal compressibility and
augmentation and respiratory variation in the deep veins of the
right leg. No evidence of DVT is seen. The previously large
lymph node mass identified in [**Month (only) 956**] is now not visualized. A
small residual lymph node is identified in the region of the
saphenofemoral junction and just anterior to the artery. Some
arterial calcification is also identified.
.
Tib/Fib XR: There are vascular calcifications, and
tricompartmental knee joint degenerative change. There is an
area of slight lucency in the soft tissues of the lower leg,
with no evidence of soft tissue emphysema or osseous
destruction. Periosteal new bone along lateral mid tibia, which
is nonspecific. Soft tissue swelling.

Brief Hospital Course:
#. Hypotension: The patient was initially hypotensive in the ED,
but her SBP in the 80s was not far off from her normal SBP.  She
was initially admitted to the MICU, where she responded well to
IVFs and [**Month (only) **], with rapid resolution of her BPs into the high
90s/low 100s.  The patient required no pressor support and no
further fluid boluses throughout her hospitalization.
.
#. Pancytopenia: The patient has longstanding anemia and
thrombocytopenia, with very low WBC count, all secondary to end
stage myeloid metaplasia, patient getting transfusions
frequently for supportive care.  The patient is transfusion
dependent.  The goal Hct > 25 and plt > 10 were kept during her
stay, and she required several transfusions to maintain adequate
Hct and Platelet count.  The patient had no bleeding episodes
during her hospitalization.  The patient does have a history of
small bowel AVMs and hemorrhoids, but was Guiac negative during
this hospitalization.  The patient tends to run INR in the 1.5
range, and in previous hospitalizations Vit K has been given to
help maintain adequate clotting.
.
#. RLE ulcer: The patient has chronic venous stasis changes in
the BLE. Pt recently had a lesion "lanced" on her RLE at the
location of the currently ulceration and cellulitis, which
likely represents the source of the current infection. The
infection is being treated with Keflex for 14 days total,
elevation of the RLE, and dry dressing changes [**Hospital1 **].  The patient
has minor pain at the lesion site, responsive to tylenol.
.
#. UTI: The patient began to complain of suprapubic pain on the
second day of her hospitalization.  Cultures grew out
pan-sensitive enterococcus.  The Keflex being given for her
cellulitis should prove able to clear this UTI as well.
