Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p diagnostic cath

History of Present Illness:
73 yo female with PMH CAD (s/p CABG '[**02**]) and PCI x 3 ([**2116**],
[**2117**]) with stenting of SVG to LCx presents from OSH with
substernal chest pain since [**2122-12-6**]. Pt had chest/epigastric
discomfort on Sunday which seemed worse with food. Pain did not
resolve. No radiation, SOB, nausea.
.
Pt seen in clinic on Thursday with persistent CP and found to
have anterior ST depressions in V1-2 along with stable ST
elevations inferiorly. Pt admitted to [**Location (un) **] [**Hospital **]
hospital where chest pain was relieved with nitro drip, has been
chest pain free since.
.
At [**Name (NI) 7145**], pt found to have positive troponin and negative CK,
which coupled with EKG changes led to the diagnosis of NSTEMI.
Sent to CCU here at [**Hospital1 18**] for potential cath.
.
Pt is currently without complaints: denies CP, SOB, DOE, PND
.
ROS negative for fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
abdominal pain.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. CAD: Pt admitted s/p NSTEMI with positive Tn and negative CK
with new anterior ST depressions and old inferior ST elevations.
On admission, pt was chest pain free. She was continued with
medical management on ASA, heparin drip, integrillin drip, nitro
drip, ezetimibe (lipid lowering [**Doctor Last Name 360**]), beta blocker, and ACEI.
On the night of admission, pt developed 3 episodes of chest
pain, each associated with hypertension. Each time the pt was
given IV lopressor to lower blood pressure, sublingual nitro,
and increase in nitro drip with resolution of chest pain. The
second episode of chest pain was associated with ST depressions
in anterolateral leads. Cardiology fellow was consulted and
emergent cardiac cath was considered. After the third episode of
chest pain, pt had slowly resolving chest pain on maximal dose
of nitro drip. Pt was taken to emergent cath and found to have
fully occluded native vessels and SVG grafts. The only vessel
that was patent was her LIMA graft to LAD, which was stenosed
70% beyond the anastomosis. Left ventriculography found LVEF of
40% with inferior akinesis. CT surgery was consulted for
potential CABG, however they felt that she was not a good
surgical candidate given the high risk of the surgery with only
one patent major artery. Pt was taken back to cardiac cath
during which a cypher drug-eluding stent was placed in the SVG
graft to the RCA. Pt had no post-procedure complications. Her
medical management was optimized. Pt remained hemodynamically
stable and chest pain free throughout the rest of the
hospitalization.

.
2. Pump: Pt was euvolemic on admission. Left ventriculography
during cardiac cath found LVEF of 40% with inferior akinesis.
.
3. Rhythm: No arrythmias were noted on telemetry.
.
4. Hypertension: Pt's blood pressure was managed with beta
blocker and ACE. She was given IV lopressor for transient
episodes of hypertension associated with chest pain.
.
5. Anemia: On admission, hct was 29. Hct decreased to 23 after
the first cardiac cath. Pt was transfused 1 unit with hct bump
to 29. Prior to discharge, pt was transfused for hct of 28, with
hct bump to 31.
.
6. Hx CVA/TIA: Stable with non-focal neuro exam on admission. Pt
was continued on ASA.
.
7. Hx depression and anxiety: Pt remained stable without any
psych medications.
.
8. Prophylaxis: Pt was given PPI and initially on heparin drip.
