Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit with bleeding from
your nose and your tracheostomy site.  Upon arrival, you were
seen by our otolaryngology specialists and, given that it was
difficult to perform the packing that was required, you were
placed under sedation and on mechanical ventilation.  The
otolaryngology specialists were successful in packing your
wound.  In addition, your had a procedure done to stop your
bleeding which required artificial blocking of one of the small
blood vessels in your neck.  You were also found to possibly
have a pneumonia, so you have been placed on antibiotics.

If you have any subsequent excessive bleeding, or difficulties
breathing, please return to the hospital immediately.

Followup Instructions:
1.) Please schedule a follow up with your primary care physician
