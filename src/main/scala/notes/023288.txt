Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 800**]
Chief Complaint:
Syncope, nausea, vomiting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EP study

History of Present Illness:
This is a 64-year-old gentleman with a history of metastatic RCC
on Bevacizumab/Temsirolimus, sick sinus syndrome s/p PPM in
[**2091**], HTN, and hypothyroidism who is transferred here from [**Hospital 7912**] after syncopal event.  Patient reports that he
had just finished showering and entered his walk-in closet when
everything went blank.  His wife heard a "thud" and went
upstairs to find her husband unconscious.  Wife called 911 and
began administering rescue breaths.  According to wife, patient
was making gurgling noises and was cyanotic.  EMS arrived and
transported patient to [**Hospital1 34**] (no note of CPR or shock, but per
report, patient was bagged).  Wife denies seizure-like activity
or bladder/bowel incontinence.  At [**Hospital1 34**], CT head, CT spine, and
CXR were negative.  Patient was transported to [**Hospital1 18**] without
incident.
.
In [**Hospital1 18**] ED VS 98, BP 140/98, HR 70, RR 19, Sat 98%2L. (P 36 to
72 in ED). Repeat CT head without new pathology. Seen by EP
fellow in ED, interrogation showed normally functioning duel
chamber PM with occasional ventricular bigeminy with normal PM
inhibition.  There is also a question of ventricular tachycardia
at the onset of the syncopal episode.
.
Admitted to medicine [**2-14**] to [**2-15**] and again [**2-16**] to [**2106-2-17**] for
lightheadness. Attribued to dehydration [**2-16**] poor PO intake and
diarrhea in setting of chemo. Of note at that time, "His pacer
was interrogated without any brady or tachyarrhythmias. He was
noted to have a HR of 30 but this was false, it was related to
PVCs in a bigemy pattern which would lead to a peripheral pulse
or pulse oximeter recording a pulse of 30, but an EKG revealed a
rate of 60."
.
PT has had > 5 bouts of non-bloody diarrhea for last 3 days. Did
note small blood on TP x 1. Poor PO intake as well last few
days.  He Reports that 3 nights ago he has multiple episodes of
seconds long dull chestpain radiating from right to left chest
occuring in bed without SOB, diaphoresis or N/V. No
palpatations.  ROS: + chronic frontal HA. No change in vision or
hearing. No focal weakness or loss of sensation. + N/V at [**Hospital **]. + diarrhea x 3 days. No dysuria or hematuria.

Past Medical History:

diagnosed [**2103**])
syncope, SSS s/p pacer (DDD) in [**2091**], generator change in [**2092**]
PAF

VEA, ??????Triggered ventricular tachycardia??????
Remote ??????seizure??????- treated at [**Hospital6 **], attributed to
 Wellbutrin
[**2103-6-1**]: Removal of colon polyps
Tobacco abuse (1ppd x approximately 40 years)
Hypothyroid
s/p Tonsillectomy

Social History:
Patient has a 40-pack-year history, quit in [**2103**].  Occasional
ETOH, none in months.  Lives with wife and works in IT at
[**Name (NI) 82882**] power plant.

Family History:
Father had stroke in 70s. Mother had colitis.  Sister has
[**Name2 (NI) **]-valvular disease.

CT HEAD [**4-9**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process. Stable findings of chronic
small vessel ischemic changes and old prior right cerebellar
infarct.
2. Slight progression of pansinus mucosal thickening.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
.
CXR [**4-9**]:
One portable view. The right chest is not entirely included.
Comparison is
made with the previous study of [**2106-2-14**].
There is minimal streaky density at the lung bases consistent
with subsegmental atelectasis or scarring, as before. The heart
and mediastinal
structures are unchanged. Spinal fusion hardware remains in
place. A bipolar transvenous pacemaker is present as
demonstrated earlier. There is no acute change.
IMPRESSION: No acute change.
.
TTE [**2106-4-12**]:
The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is severe
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near
akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral wall and hypokinesis
of the mid to distal anterior septum and anterior wall. There is
no left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with
Valsalva. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There is abnormal septal motion/position. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study ([**Month/Day/Year **] echo - limited images
reviewed) of [**2106-2-18**], the above mentioned wall motion
abnormalities were present in a milder form on the prior echo.
The ejection fraction has decreased.
.
TEE [**2106-4-14**]:
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal
to mid inferior hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic valve abscess is seen. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. No vegetation/mass is seen on the
pulmonic valve. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Good quality study. No valvular vegetations or
perivavlar abcesses seen. No vegetations seen on RA/RV pacer
leads. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild focal left ventricular
dysfunction with basal to mid wall hypokinesis. Compared to the
transthoracic echo of [**4-12**]/9, the anterior wall motion looks
normal and the inferior wall is less hypokinetic.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 64-year-old gentleman with metastatic RCC, SSS s/p
pacemaker, history of seizure x 1, who is transferred here from
[**Hospital6 33**] for an episode of syncope, agonal
breathing, and cyanosis.  Upon interrogation of PPM, appears as
though patient had an episode of V-Tach at symptom onset.
.
#) Syncope/Ventricular Tachycardia: Initially his symptoms
appeared consistent with cardiac etiology (history of sick sinus
syndrome, no prodrome, "drop attack," cyanosis).  According to
EP, his pacermaker was functioning normally, but there was
concern that he may have an an ectopic focus possibly near left
coronary, causing dysrhythmia.  The initial plan was for him to
undergo an EP study, h
