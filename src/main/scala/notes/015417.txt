Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea, chest pain, hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization
Chest tube placement and removal

History of Present Illness:
62 yo F with no significant PMH, recently diagnosed with
cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, who was transferred from an
OSH to [**Hospital1 18**] for left heart catheterization, who is now being
called out to the floor following initial management of
hemothorax (due to chest tube placed at OSH for unclear
reasons).
.
Briefly, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2124-1-10**] with
6 months of cough, 30 lb weight loss, DOE, orthopnea and
lethargy.
.
On the day of presentation at the OSH, she also developed
bilateral LE edema, as well as increased dyspnea.  She underwent
a chest CT (w/contrast) that ruled out PE but demonstrated
"multifocal multinodular infiltrates with nodular
consolidation", mediastinal and hilar adenopathy, and
tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities.  She had a VATS and RUL wedge lung biopsy
on [**2124-1-14**] which revealed COP /BOOP, with negative flow
cytometry.  ANCA, Anti CCP, and AFB were negative as well.  She
had a post-op chest tube from [**2033-1-12**].  She was started on
Solumedrol 40mg IV TID, which had been started for empiric
treatment of her dyspnea and concomitant eosinophilia of 17% on
presentation, and was continued after the tissue diagnosis of
BOOP /COP.
.
She developed chest pain initially in her hospital stay, and
enzymes revealed a peak troponin I of 7.960.  ECG did not reveal
ST elevations, but given her elevated tropnin she was started on
Plavix, metoprolol, aspirin and Ranexa.  TTE revealed mild LV
systolic dysfunction and diastolic dysfunction with moderate MR
and TR.  Nuclear stress test on [**2124-1-12**] showed anterolateral
myocardial infarct with moderate ischemia and mildly reduced LV
function with segmental wall abnormalities.
.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization on
[**2124-1-21**] which revealed clean coronary arteries.  She remained on
the Cardiology service therafter.  She was felt to have possible
myocarditis, but could not rule out small embolus to the cornary
artery.  Cardiology advised f/u MRI as an outpatient.
.
She then developed recurrent chest pain. Pain was pleuritic and
located at the site of her VATS procedure in her right axilla.
She desaturated from the low 90s on 3 L to high 80s. She
underwent a repeat chest CT w/ contrast that was negative for
PE.  It did reveal persistent "bilateral nodular and
centrilobular opacification with peribronchial wall thickening
and mucoid impaction, indicative of aspiration or chronic
infection/inflammation."  She received analgesia for the chest
pain and her symptoms improved.
.
Thoracic surgery was consulted to evaluate an oozing chest tube
site, and they advised close monitoring..  Pulmonary was
consulted and advised transitioning to prednisone and started
PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
.
The patient then noted escalating pain at biopsy site.  Pain
improved with analegesic, but worsened to [**7-5**] with associated
dyspnea and substernal chest pressure, and saturation on routine
vitals showed 87% on 9L.  Increased drainage from chest tube
site was noted.  Repeat CXR showed worsening right sided pleural
effusion.  A thoracentesis was done on [**2124-1-23**] and pleural fluid
was sent for analysis.  ABG on NRB showed 7.44 / 40 / 94 /28.
Chest pain and dyspnea improved with morphine and patient
repositioning.  She became hypotensive to 70's, and chest tube
was placed due to worsening right sided pleural effusion was
noted on CXR.  Tube drained 2.5L blood after initial placement,
and she was transfused 3 units PRBCs and given fluids.  Since
then tube drained an addition 1L (not including initial 2.5L),
most recently 100 mL serosanguinous from 12A-8A, but since 8AM
~60 mL dark blood.
.
Currently, the patient denies chest pain, dyspnea, fevers,
chills.  She reports recent right-sided chest pain, similar in
quality to previous pain, although less severe, that resolved
spontaneously.  No other complaints.
.
On transfer to floor her VS were stable: T 96.3 afebrile  HR 81
BP 131/71  RR 20  99% on 3L NC.
