He was admitted to medicine wards for alcohol withdrawal.
.

sublingal nitro. His EKG showed continued J point ST elevations
in II,III, AVF, old T wave inversion in AVl and new T wave
inversions in V1-V3. His were elevated and peaked at a CK-Mb of
19 and a uptrending troponin of 0.16 in the setting of
chronically elevated creatinine of 1.4-1.7. He was started on a
heparin drip. Today at 4 am, he developed 1 hour of chest
pressure. His BPs have dropped to the 90s with SL nitro. and was
transferred to the CCU for nitro drip. He also developed a
worsening hypoxia and briefly required a non-rebreather which
was weaned quickly and he was transferred on nasal cannula.

Imaging:
Cardiac Cath ([**4-14**]) - Prelim report
COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system

demonstrated two vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had
no
angiographically apparent flow-limiting coronary artery disease.
 The
LAD had a calcified, 70-80% lesion after D1.  The high first
diagonal
had diffuse disease a mid vessel total oclusion with
collaterals.  The
LCx had mild diffuse diease.  The RCA had a 60% proximal and
distal
lesions.
2.  Limited resting hemodyanamics revealed normal systemic blood

pressure, with a central aortic pressure of 131/86 mmHg.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
.
ECHO ([**4-14**])
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 70%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a prominent fat pad.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2113-7-21**], the findings are similar.
