Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea, chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IABP placement

History of Present Illness:
49 year old male with h/o severe MR s/p MVR [**7-/2163**], s/p AVR due
to endocarditis in [**2156**], redo bioprosthetic AVR [**2157**] for
endocarditis recurrence, CAD s/p CABG [**2157**] with SVG to RCA and
SVG to LAD, HTN who presented to the ED at [**2185**] with chest pain
and dyspnea, N/V, loose stools. Pt initially received SL NTG and
ASA in ambulance on way to ER and was on CPAP. BP 170/100 on
presentation, HR 80 in SR. ECG showed STE anterior leads with
lateral depressions. TTE done in ED and seen by cardiology. CXR
with pulmonary edema and given 80 IV lasix, became hypotensive
to 80. He was given 2L IVF, SBP improved to 100. Blood and urine
cx's sent, given vanco and gentamicin. He subseqently developed
rapid AFib to 110, became more dyspneic and was intubated.
Became hypotensive to 60s in setting of intubation. A-line was
placed with SBP 107, transferred to CCU.
On arrival pt was hypotensive to 70's, started on levophed, L
femoral central line placed. Pt was transferred to cath lab for
emergent IABP, in addition R sided cath revealed severe MR.
During this time, increasing difficulty with ventilation and
hypercarbic acidosis, despite attempts at various types of
ventilation, limited by resp pressure in high 40's. Pt was
paralyzed with vecoronium to aid with ventilation. After IABP
added, SBP improved to 90's, however continued difficulty
oxygenating, ABG pH 7.06/79/83. PCW 41, Fick CI 2.78.
On evaluation, pt is intubated and sedated.

Cardiac Risk Factors: Diabetes, Dyslipidemia, Hypertension

Cath [**2164-2-14**]:
4+ MR, 60% LVEF
LAD mid-segment competitive flow from patent SVG which is
patent, RCA occluded at origin, SVG patent.
CI 2.78, PCW 41
.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2163-1-25**] demonstrated:
1. Two vessel native coronary artery disease.
2. Patent SVG to LAD.
3. Moderate origin stenosis of SVG to RCA.
4. Moderate pulmonary systolic arterial hypertension.
5. Giant V waves consistent with mitral regurgitation.
6. Preserved cardiac index (CI 2.9, PCWP 16).

Brief Hospital Course:
49 year old male with h/o severe MR s/p MVR [**7-/2163**], s/p AVR due
to endocarditis in [**2156**], redo bioprosthetic AVR [**2157**] for
endocarditis recurrence, CAD s/p CABG [**2157**] with SVG to RCA and
SVG to LAD, HTN found to be in cardiogenic shock due to acute
severe MR in setting of volume overload with extreme difficulty
mantaining oxygenation and adequate MAP.
.

# Cardiogenic shock/Multiorgan failure due to acute MR

Due to severe MR, on triple pressors (dopa 5, NE 0.3 to 0.4,
vaso 2.4), lasix gtt (15), IABP. Multiorgan failure, kidney
(creat 3.1 to 4.2), liver (INR 6 to 13, bili 4.6 to 7.6),
cardiac, and pulmonary function is all trending down. Patient
was currently not a surgical candidate per CT surgery. Decision
made my HCP [**Name (NI) 21709**] [**Name (NI) 1968**] (brother) and family to withdraw care.
Patient expired with family present on [**2164-2-16**] at 2100. Autopsy
to be performed, consent given by son [**Name (NI) 4035**] [**Name (NI) 1968**].
