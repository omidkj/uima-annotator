History of Present Illness:
79 y.o. with PVD, a.fib (on coumadin), R leg neuropathy (no

[**2130-10-6**] VENOUS UE ULTRASOUND
IMPRESSION:
1.  Patent right and left basilic veins and cephalic vein in the
forearm.
2.  Thrombus seen within the distal left cephalic vein.
.
[**2130-10-6**] VENOUS LE ULTRASOUND
IMPRESSION:  Patent greater and lesser saphenous veins
bilaterally.
.
[**2130-10-7**] CARDIAC ECHO:
LVEF 70%
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF 70%). The right ventricular free wall
is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
depressed free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.

.
[**2130-10-8**] CT ABD/PELVIS, CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Right upper lobe consolidation, concerning for pneumonia,
with small foci of peribronchovascular consolidation in the left
upper lobe, which could represent atelectasis or atypical
infection.
2.  Fluid layering in the presacral space, of indeterminate
etiology.
3.  No CT evidence for hematoma.
4.  Extremely dense, diffusely distributed arterial
calcifications, including  the coronary arteries and aortic
valve, of indeterminate hemodynamic significance.
5.  T9 vertebra plana with retropulsion into the spinal canal,
age indeterminate in the absence of prior imaging.  MRI is
recommended for
evaluation of intrathecal structures if clinically indicated.
.
[**2130-10-8**] CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECON
IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of acute pulmonary thromboembolic disease in the
central or subsegmental branches. Tiny focus of linear
hypoattenuation in the right lower lobe pulmonary arterial
branch may represent sequelae of a tiny chronic pulmonary
embolus. Findings of pulmonary arterial hypertension.  There is
mild straightening of the interventricular septum and right
ventricular enlargement which correlates with reported right
ventricular strain.  Cardiomegaly with left atrial enlargement.
2.  Bilateral upper lobe patchy consolidation is likely related
to
infectious/inflammatory process.  Recommend followup unenhanced
CT chest six to eight weeks following the initiation of
antibiotic therapy to document resolution.
3.  Upper lobe predominant centrilobular emphysema.
4.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
5.  Interlobular septal thickening, although a nonspecific
findings, with
cardiomegaly and bilateral pleural effusions, pulmonary edema is
considered the likely etiology.
6.  Minimally enlarged right paratracheal lymph node, likely
reactive. Attention to this finding on followup imaging.
7.  T8 vertebra plana compression fracture of indeterminate age
with
retropulsion and mild narrowing of the spinal canal. Further
evaluation can be obtained with MRI.
