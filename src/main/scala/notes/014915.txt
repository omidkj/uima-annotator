disease.  2. Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction
of 30%.  3. Chronic atrial fibrillation.  4. Hypothyroidism.
5. Right upper lobe lung mass consistent with adenocarcinoma
diagnosed with outside hospital thoracentesis (stage IIIb).  6.
Prior hemothorax/hemorrhagic effusion, patient failed pleurodesis

atelectasis and porcelain gallbladder.
3. EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 90,
normal axis, left ventricular hypertrophy, ST depression 1 mm
in V2 through V6, T wave inversions in leads 1 and 2.
