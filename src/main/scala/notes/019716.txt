Service:  CARDIAC CARE UNIT

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Congestive heart failure/pulmonary edema.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 84-year-old
man with a history of coronary artery disease, peptic ulcer
disease, who presented to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital on [**2107-5-5**] with
complaints of shortness of breath and lower extremity edema
as well as nausea.  The patient was found to have a troponin
of 1.49 which was positive per their assay.  An EKG
demonstrated variable ST changes.  The patient was initially
treated for unstable angina.  However, on the evening of
admission, the patient developed worsening abdominal pain
which progressed into an acute abdomen.  The patient was
evaluated with a KUB which demonstrated free air and
diagnosed eventually with perforated fundal and duodenal
ulcers.

The patient was taken emergently to surgery on [**2107-5-5**] which
involved repair of these ulcers, cholecystectomy,
pyloroplasty, placement of G tube for gastric drainage, J
tube for tube feeds, JP drain, T tube for biliary drainage.
The patient's wound was left open for healing by secondary
intention.

The patient's postoperative course included an uncomplicated
extubation after the event on [**2107-5-10**], empiric treatment
with a course of Cipro, Flagyl, ampicillin, and Diflucan from
[**2107-5-6**] to [**2107-5-11**], advancement of his diet to tube feeds
at goal at the time of transfer.

The patient has a history of chronic renal insufficiency with
a baseline creatinine of 2.1-2.9 of unknown etiology.  On
presentation to the [**Hospital1 882**], the patient's creatinine
increased to 4.0 which subsequently increased to 5.4 during
the hospitalization likely secondary to postoperative ATN.
At the time of transfer, the patient's creatinine had begun
to trend down and was 5.1.

The patient developed episodes of flash pulmonary edema on
[**2107-5-11**] and [**2107-5-12**] with symptoms including shortness of
breath, a choking sensation, no chest pain.  EKGs taken
during these episodes demonstrated a lateral ST depression.
The patient was noted to have MR, [**12-30**]+, on admission;
however, during these episodes, he was noted to have an
increased murmur and an echocardiogram was repeated which
demonstrated [**3-1**]+ mitral regurgitation.  There was concern
that the patient's episodes of flash pulmonary edema were
secondary to acute mitral valve ischemia and further
intervention with cardiac catheterization was recommended.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease:  Cardiac catheterization in
[**3-30**] demonstrated a 70% LAD lesion, 50% left circ.  Repeat
catheterization in [**2-28**] demonstrated question of 40% LAD
lesion, RCA 30%, circumflex 50%.  A decision was made not to
proceed with surgery at that time.
2.  Congestive heart failure.
3.  Peripheral vascular disease, status post left fem-[**Doctor Last Name **]
bypass.
4.  Chronic renal insufficiency, baseline 2.1-2.9.
5.  Hypercholesterolemia.
6.  Peptic ulcer disease.
7.  COPD.
8.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
9.  Status post left total hip.

6.  Plavix 20.
7.  Zocor 20.

6.  Oxycodone p.r.n.
7.  Free water boluses t.i.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his son who is also
his health care proxy.  [**Name (NI) **] has a history of tobacco use.  No
significant alcohol and no illicit drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  No coronary artery disease.  He has seven
brothers and four sisters who are healthy.  His mother is
deceased at age [**Age over 90 **].  Father deceased at 79 of a CVA.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
97.0, blood pressure 152/42, pulse 76, respiratory rate 15,
saturating 100% on 3 liters nasal cannula.  General:  The
patient was a pleasant elderly Irishman, in no acute
distress.  HEENT:  NC/AT.  Pupils equal, round, and reactive
to light.  Positive proptosis, positive nose abrasion.  Neck:
Supple.  JVD increased, elevated above angle of mandible.
Bilateral carotid bruits.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and
rhythm, holosystolic murmur at the apex, prominent P2.  He
has a systolic murmur at the upper sternal border.
Pulmonary:  Decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally.
No crackles.  Abdomen:  Large abdominal wound with minimal
purulent drainage.  No surrounding erythema or edema.  Four
drains in place.  Extremities:  1+ DPP bilaterally, bilateral
femoral bruits.  Neurologic:  Alert and oriented,
appropriate.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White count 12.7, hematocrit
32.9, platelets 229,000, dif within normal limits.
Coagulations:  14.3, 1.4, 62.2.  Sodium 147, potassium 3.3,
chloride 109, bicarbonate 24, BUN 104, creatinine 4.4, down
from 5.1, glucose 104, calcium 8.1, magnesium 2.6, phosphorus
6.5, AST 19, AST 17, albumin 2.4, LD 240, CK 101, alkaline
phosphatase 70, bilirubin 0.5.

Chest x-ray demonstrated right lower lobe linear infiltrates,
mild upper zone redistribution, no pneumothorax, right
subclavian line in good place.

EKG demonstrated a normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, no
ischemic ST wave changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  CARDIOVASCULAR/ISCHEMIA:  The patient
was evaluated for possible mitral valve ischemia with
echocardiogram which demonstrated a moderately dilated left
atrium, mildly dilated right atrium, moderate global left
ventricular hypokinesis, 2+ aortic regurgitation, 2+ mitral
regurgitation, no pericardial effusion.

The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2107-5-6**]
which demonstrated multivessel CAD with a right dominant
system with LMCA, 30% ostial lesion, LAD 90% D1 and 50%
distal LAD and left circumflex 70% OM2 stenosis.
Interventions including stenting of the OM stenosis with a
2.5 mm Hepacoat stent and dilation of the D1 stenosis with a
cutting balloon.

The patient noted subsequent improvement in his ischemic
symptoms with fewer episodes of choking sensation and chest
discomfort.  He was maintained on aspirin, Plavix, and
eventually the nitroglycerin drip was weaned to off.  In
terms of his pump issues, moderately depressed LV function.
The patient was noted to have severely elevated filling
pressures in cardiac catheterization.  He underwent diuresis
initially with nisiritide given his chronic renal
insufficiency.  The patient was easily diuresed with
nisiritide and switched to IV Lasix with good effect.  The
patient was maintained on Hydralazine IV as well as Isordil
for afterload reduction.

RHYTHM:  The patient was with an episode of atrial
fibrillation on [**2107-5-10**] at the outside hospital.  He will
continue telemetry monitoring.

2.  RENAL ISSUES:  The patient was admitted with a creatinine
falling to 4.4.  The patient tolerated cardiac
catheterization and dye load with subsequent decreased in the
creatinine to a low of 2.6.  During the hospitalization,
however, the patient began experiencing a rise in his
creatinine, likely associated with infection and a question
of prerenal etiology.

3.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient required a transfusion of 3
units of blood to maintain a stable hematocrit.  His heparin
drip was discontinued post catheterization and his crit has
remained stable since.

4.  ABDOMEN:  The patient was followed by the Surgical
Service for wound care in regards to his wounds and drains.
The patient initially remained afebrile with normal white
count, however.  On [**2107-5-20**], the patient spiked a
temperature with leukocytosis.  Blood cultures drawn at this
time demonstrated gram-positive cocci with speciation
including Enterococcus.  The patient underwent a culture of
bile fluid which demonstrated gram-negative rods with
gram-positive cocci.  He was started on treatment with
vancomycin, levofloxacin and Flagyl.

5.  NUTRITION:  The patient was maintained on tube feeds at
goal.
