Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4611**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath, failure to thrive

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
thoracentesis [**2185-1-11**]

History of Present Illness:
Mrs [**Known lastname **] is a 62 year-old woman transfered from pulmonary
clinic with complaint of SOB and failure to thrive at home. She
presented to [**Hospital3 635**] ED 2 weeks ago and remained inpatient from
[**Date range (1) 92600**]. This admission identified a left pleural effusion
and left hilar mass that underwent CT guided biopsy to reveal
small cell lung cancer. She received XRT [**1-3**] and chemotherapy
on [**12-31**] and [**1-6**]. She was evaluated by the [**Hospital 18**] [**Hospital **]
clinic for SOB for which she describes that she has been on 2L
of O2 since her recent discharge. In addition she complains of
anorexia and reports taking very little by mouth.
.
In the ED, initial vs were:T:100.6 HR:102 BP:115/90 RR:32
SpO2:89%. Labs in the ED were notable for K of 2.9, Cr 0.7, Cl
87, and HCO3 42. She was found to be hypoxic to the high 80s on
room air that did not sufficiently improve sufficiently on
supplemental O2 and transiently required BiPap. She underwent
thoracentesis of left pleural effusion in the ED of 1600mL
revealing protein of 2.7, LDH 93 and glucose of 101 with 560
WBCs and 185 RBCs. She received 40 mEq of K, 1g ceftriaxone and
750mg levofloxacin and was admitted to the MICU. Vitals on
transfer were T:96.9 HR:98 BP:140/66 RR:20 100% on BiPAP.
.
On arrival to the MICU the patient was alert and comfortable on
BiPAP with 100% SpO2 and was rapidly titrated to 100% SpO2 2L
NC. Patient denied additional complaints.

STUDIES:
[**2185-1-11**] CT chest w/o contrast
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive central adenopathy in the left hilus and in the
mediastinum from the supraclavicular to the subcarinal stations.
Left hilar adenopathy and adjacent upper lobe lung mass combine
to severely narrow the left upper lobe bronchus, producing
severe left upper lobe atelectasis. Esophagus and superior vena
cava might be compromised by adenopathy.
2. Coarse interstitial infiltration left lower lobe, probably
combination of atelectasis and obstructed lymphatic drainage.
Pneumonia is another possibility.
3. Severe emphysema. Hyperexpansion and diminished vascularity
in the
superior segment of the right lower lobe could be due to tumor
infiltration affecting the superior segment and basal trunk
bronchi.
4. Possible large left renal and hepatic masses.

pleural fluid analysis [**1-11**]:
  NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
  Reactive mesothelial cells, histiocytes, and lymphocytes

ECG [**2185-1-11**]
Severe, profound baseline artifact. Unable to detect rhythm.
However, rhythm appears to be regular. There is a poor R wave
progression suggesting prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
Repeat tracing is recommended. No previous tracing available for
comparison.

CXR [**2185-1-11**]
IMPRESSION: Limited exam given no prior studies for comparison
with large
opacity obscuring the majority of the left lung which could be
secondary to effusion and consolidation. Right effusion and
basilar atelectasis with
probable background emphysema.

[**2185-1-12**] left lower extremity ultrasound:
All of the deep veins of the left lower extremity from the groin
to the
popliteal fossa show normal and full compressibility. Color flow
and pulse
Doppler waveforms were normal throughout including the posterior
tibial and peroneal veins. CFV waveforms were symmetrical
bilaterally.
CONCLUSION: Normal study. No evidence of DVT.

Brief Hospital Course:
62 y/o F with recent dx of SCLC presenting [**1-11**] with SOB/FTT,
MICU stay for hypoxia requiring bipap resolved with
thoracentesis. Transferred to OMED for onc management, now with
neutropenia.

#Respiratory distress - On admission pt found to be hypoxic in
high 80s on RA, found with left pleural effusion in the setting
of recent diagnosis of small cell lung cancer, see below. Pt
required temporary MICU stay for BIPAP but was quickly weaned
and satting well on 2-3L NC. Received thoracentesis the evening
of admission with improvement in respiratory status.
Cefepime/cipro/vanc started for CAP, but stopped [**1-12**] and the pt
was afebrile since. IP planned pleurex placement for [**2185-1-14**] and
pt was transferred to OMED. At this point s/p chemotherapy pt's
counts began to nadir and her platelets were 28 so the pleurex
placement was deferred. In addition her respiratory status
remained stable with O2 sats in mid-90s on 2-3L which is her
baseline at home. Her lung exam had improved and th
