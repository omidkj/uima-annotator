Recurrent VT: The patient has history of recurrent VT and
underwent a successful elective VT ablation during this
admission with no complications. Electrolytes remained stable
and the patient had no significant events on tele after the
procedure.

Atrial fibrillation:  The patient has history of atrial

continued during hospitalization. PTT on discharge was
therpeutic (2.7). He was sent home on his home coumadin regimen
(3mg Mon and Fri and 2mg all other days).

CAD:  The patient has CAD s/p LAD stenting in [**2197**], which was
later complicated by instent thrombosis and VF arrest.
Currently asymptomatic, denying any chest pain or shortness of
breath. Atenolol, lovastatin, and aspirin were continued during
hospitalization.

Ischemic related CM:  Most recent ECHO with EF 20% with moderate
LV cavity dilation with severe regional LV systolic dysfunction
c/w multivessel CAD. The patient was given furosemide 40 mg
during the procedure, and another 20 mg prior to transfer to the
CCU.  Patient remained euvolemic during hospitalization. He was
discharged on home furosemide dose.
