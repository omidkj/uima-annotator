History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7086**] is a 52 year old male with past medical history of
COPD on home oxygen and type two diabetes mellitus who presented
with shortness of breath.
.
He reported that over the past week to weeks, he has noted some
increasing white sputum production, but that was no accompanied
by any shortness of breath or fevers. He did note some chills
with the clear and white sputum. + Sick contact: nephew. [**Name2 (NI) **]
called [**Company 191**] on [**2204-5-7**] to discuss his worsening symptoms. He
was instructed to increase his prednisone to 10 mg daily (from
qOD) and initiated levofloxacin [**5-7**]. As per usual over the last
2 years (about 4 times), he had a COPD exacerbation that he
managed at home with nebulizers. This time, however, the meds
"didn't work". Th morning of admission, he woke up acutely short
of breath. He took one nebulizer treatment at home, but given
the degree of dyspnea and lack of improvement, EMS was called.
.
Per report from the ED, upon arrival EMS administered another
nebulizer treatment, and gave him magnesium en route to [**Hospital1 18**].
It was reported that he was moving "very little air." Upon
arrival to the ED, his initial vital signs were: temperature of
97.0, heart rate of 114, blood pressure 107/62, respirations of
24, and oxygen saturation of 100% on 60% face mask. Per
discussion with ED, his respiratory rate remained in the low
30's. He received three additional combivent nebulizer
treatments back-to-back, as well as 125 mg of methylprednisolone
and 500 mg of IV azithromycin. Lorazepam was given to see if
there was any improvement in his tachypnea; ED reported this
transiently improved his symptoms, but not significantly. At
time of sign-out, he was receiving his forth nebulizer
treatment. Vitals at time of ICU transfer were reported as heart
rate of 119, blood pressure of 132/70, respiratory rate of 29,
and oxygen saturaiton of 98% on 50% nebulizer treatment.
.
In the ICU, he was started on Prednisone 60mg daily, intended
for a long taper, received Azithro and plenty of nebs. He
required BiPAP at night and was at the mid 90's sats on 6L
during the day. He experienced an episode of [**2-1**] CP that
radiated down his left arm with flat troponins. On my exam, he
feels "100 times better"
.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7086**] is a 52 year old male with past medical history of
COPD on home oxygen, diabetes mellitus, and OSA who presented
with respiratory distress. He was found to be in hypercarbic
respiratory failure that responded swiftly to IV (and then PO)
steroids, nebulized bronchodilators, antibiotics and NIPPV. He
had TWI with an episode of chest pain that was evaluated by
serial enzymes and a dobutamine-stress MIBI (both negative). He
was discharged on a prednisone taper with documentation of
nocturnal hypoxia to support a biPap prescription.

#) COPD, OSA ?????? Patient was found to by in hypercarbic
respiratory failure secondary to COPD exacerbation, improved on
bipap in ED.  Was given methylprednisolone for 24 hours, changed
to prednisone 60mg PO qdaily which was subsequently tapered.
continued on azithromycine, iptropium/albuterol nebs standing
q4h.  Patient did well. Completed abx. Had documented nocturnal
desaturation to merit BiPap at home. Bicarb rose on penultimate
day with improving ABG, likely related to metabolism of
admission hypercarbia.

#) chest pain - found to have non-exertional substernal chest
pain with radiation to the left shoulder.  Had stress test in
[**2198**] that was nondiagnostic.  ECG with dynamic inferior t wave
inversions.  TIMI score calculated at 1. Coronary calcifications
on chest CT. Stress mibi was negative.
