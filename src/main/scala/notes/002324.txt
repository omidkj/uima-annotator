CXR ([**2170-2-8**]):
A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device appears unchanged with leads
again
terminating in the right atrium and ventricle, respectively. The
heart is
mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear
unchanged. A
calcified nodule in the right upper lobe suggesting a granuloma
appears
unchanged. Otherwise, the lungs remain clear. There is no
pleural effusion
or pneumothorax. Small osteophytes are noted along the
mid-to-lower thoracic spine. IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute
disease.
.
ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND:
Normal abdominal ultrasound. Normal liver.
.
EGD ([**2-9**]):
Findings:
Esophagus: Normal esophagus.
Stomach:
Flat Lesions Many non-bleeding localized angioectasias were seen
in the stomach antrum. The lesions were distributed in a
watermelon-stomach pattern, consistent with GAVE.
Duodenum: Normal duodenum.
Impression: Angioectasias in the stomach antrum, watermelon
stomach consistent with GAVE
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
Recommendations: The findings account for the symptoms.
GAVE could not be treated during this endoscopy due to elevated
INR.
.
EGD with APC ([**2-13**]):
Normal mucosa in the esophagus
Angioectasias in the antrum (thermal therapy)
Normal mucosa in the duodenum
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
Recommendations: Repeat endoscopy in [**3-30**] weeks for repeat APC.
Additional recs by inpatient GI team.


Brief Hospital Course:
65 yo M w/ CAD s/p MI, sCHF, AFIB, HTN and DMII presented with
four days of dark stools and several weeks of progressive
fatigue. Found to have marked iron-deficiency anemia likely
secondary to chronic bleeding and GAVE treated with EGD/APC on
[**2-13**].
.
# Anemia / GI bleed: Hct ~ 20 at presentation. He refuses
transfusion for religious reasons. His anemia is likely
secondary to both acute bleeding (dark stools) and slow chronic
loss (ferritin of 7). He has received two doses of IV iron
during this admission and is discharged on PO BID iron to be
continued until his iron stores are replete. GAVE tissue was
successfully
