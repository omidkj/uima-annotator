Service:  Medicine

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Patient is a 79 year old female
with multiple medical problems including coronary artery
disease, type-2 diabetes, hypertension, a remote history of
breast cancer 28 years ago, atrial fibrillation who
transferred from an outside hospital ([**Hospital 1562**] Hospital) to
[**Hospital1 69**] for management of her
recurrent pleural effusion.

Patient reported that she began being diagnosed with
effusions about one year ago, however, did not develop
shortness of breath until [**2193-6-11**].  She noted that she
had dyspnea on exertion, that has been gradually worsening.
She denied any cough or chest pain.  She denied any
orthopnea.  She had undergone paracentesis three or four
times prior to presentation at [**Hospital1 18**], and reports relief
after the procedures.  Recently, the patient was at [**Hospital 1562**]
Hospital with a gastrointestinal bleed and hematocrit down to
16.  During that admission, she had a thoracentesis which
drained 1800 cc of fluid.

She was discharged on [**2193-9-12**] and returned on [**9-13**] because
her shortness of breath had not resolved, however, it was not
any worse than it was on the discharge.  Per the note,
patient had oxygen saturation of 80 percent in the ambulance
on the way to [**Hospital1 18**].  In the outside hospital she had oxygen
saturations of 96 to 99 percent on one liter.  She was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible Pleurax catheter placement
and management of this recurrent effusion.

recurrent right-sided pleural effusion.

HOSPITALIZATION COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1.  Pulmonary:  Patient underwent a therapeutic thoracentesis
on [**2193-9-14**] which was consistent with a transudate and
revealed 222 white blood cells, 2,000 red blood cells, 11
percent polys, 72 percent lymphocytes, total protein of 2.0,
glucose 152, LD 114, amylase 56, albumin 1.2, triglycerides
18.  Serum albumin was 3.3 and LD was 338.  Cultures were
collected but not evaluated due to laboratory error.  Patient
underwent serial evaluations of her effusion via chest x-ray
and repeat x-rays on [**9-15**] and [**9-19**] revealed increasing in
the size of the right-sided effusion.

Patient initially required oxygen of about four liters, and
decreased her oxygen requirements down to one liter with
oxygen saturations of 99 percent by the time of discharge.
Patient was evaluated by Interventional Pulmonology who
planned to insert a permanent Pleurax catheter for self
draining to prevent future recurrence of the effusion.
However, this procedure was deferred to the day of discharge
as the patient developed chest pain and underwent a cardiac
workup as listed below.

The cause of the effusion remained unknown.  It was unlikely
due to recurrence of malignancy as the patient has had no
other signs or symptoms or laboratory evidence of malignancy.
An ultrasound of the liver and gallbladder was performed to
see if the changes were consistent with cirrhosis which could
be a contributing etiology.  However, this study was negative
for any such change.  An infectious etiology was also
considered and therefore the patient was placed on
prophylactic antibiotics for perhaps an underlying pneumonia.

Congestive heart failure was also a possible etiology and
therefore an echocardiogram was repeated which was consistent
with right ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension,
and mild mitral regurgitation, mild left atrial dilatation
with an ejection fraction of 50 percent, but not consistent
with florid congestive heart failure.

Lymphatic syndrome was also unlikely given the patient's
albumin.  Lymphedema was also entertained as a possibility,
however, this would be an unusual cause of the effusion given
the remote history of cancer nearly 30 years ago.  Patient
continued to improve symptomatically, particularly after the
Pleurax catheter was placed and she was instructed on how to
use this catheter as an outpatient.

2.  Cardiovascular:  The patient has history of atrial
fibrillation.  However, Coumadin was held for an INR of 5.0
and a recent history of gastrointestinal bleed.  The Coumadin
will need to be restarted as an outpatient, and one might
want to consider rhythm control with digoxin.  The patient
was also maintained on aspirin and later Plavix was started
for anticoagulation.

On [**9-15**], the patient was evaluated multiple times for chest
pain and shortness of breath.  She had a Troponin of 0.5,
0.46, 0.56 with CK values of 86, 72, 98.  At the outside
hospital, the patient has had a Troponin level of 0.1 to
0.23.  EKG changes were very nonspecific.  The patient was
treated for her symptoms with an aspirin, Beta blocker,
Nitroglycerin, oxygen.  However, due to her recent
gastrointestinal bleed, IV heparin could not be s
