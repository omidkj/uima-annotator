ADDENDUM

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient was continued on Protonix
and Helicobacter pylori treatment.  She had occult positive
stool, but this was expected given her recent upper
gastrointestinal bleed.  Her hematocrit was monitored and
remained stable.

2.  Cardiovascular:  The patient had been admitted on
antihypertensive medications, however, her blood pressure was
monitored and these were held as her blood pressures remained
under reasonable control without antihypertensives.

3.  Infectious Disease:  The patient was noted to have
increasing secretions from suctioning from her tracheostomy
as well as low-grade temperatures up to 99.8.  A sputum grew
pseudomonas, and white count was noted on [**7-13**] to be 12.7, up
from 8.9 several days previously.  The patient had a history
of pseudomonas that was resistant to imipenem.  As
sensitivities were not available yet, the patient was started
on ceftazidime 2 grams every eight hours.  Additionally,
chest x-ray showed bibasilar infiltrates vs. atelectasis.
Sensitivities will need to be followed up on.  The patient's
heel ulcer was continued with wet-to-dry dressings.

4.  Renal:  The patient had a stable creatinine and was noted
to have a decreasing BUN.  Elevated BUN was thought secondary
to gastrointestinal bleed.

5.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient was
noted to have a hypernatremia as high as 150.  Free water
boluses were initiated and then increased, and this slowly
resolved.  On [**2179-7-13**], sodium was 145.  On [**7-13**], the patient
was noted to have a calcium level of .5 with an albumin of
2.3.  Electrocardiogram was done, which did not show any
electrocardiogram changes of hypercalcemia.  Review of
records showed that in [**2179-5-10**] the patient had had
workup of her hypercalcemia.  At that time, her PTH was less
than 7.5.  Vitamin D-125 was 28, with normal range 15 to 60.
25 vitamin D was 5, with normal range of 10 to 68, and PTH RP
was .2.  At this time, SPEP has been sent and test is
pending.  Additionally, a TSH has been sent.  Would recommend
that UPEP be sent also to work up hypercalcemia.  Patient
currently being treated with intravenous fluids and lasix as
well as calcitonin 600 units subcutaneously twice a day.

6.  Endocrine:  The patient's finger sticks were monitored.
She had elevated blood sugars in the 200s, and her NPH was
slowly titrated up.

7.  Prophylaxis:  She was on Protonix and Venodynes.  She was
not on subcutaneous heparin given her recent gastrointestinal
bleed.

8.  Access:  Peripheral PICC line was place, and placement
confirmed by chest x-ray.
