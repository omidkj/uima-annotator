History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4636**] is a 71yo paraplegic female with PMH significant
for HTN, HLD, and chronic UTI's who is being transferred to the
MICU for management of hypotension. Per her son,
the patient's home nurse noted that she had a slight temperature
this morning. Her son noted that her appetite was poor and was
also incoherent. He also noted that her catheter contained urine
that was dark and concentrated. He immediately called 911. She
was then brought to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further work-up. There is no
report of SOB, chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or
constipation. The son was also concerned that her catheter was
not working well and needed to be changed.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 102.2 BP 115/33 AR 105 RR 18 O2
sat 94% on 3L NC. She received Vancomycin 1gm IV, Zosyn 4.5gm
IV, and Tylenol 1gm. Her blood pressure dropped to 95/43 and
given lack of improvement after receiving 3L NS, she is being
transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring.

Past Medical History:
1)Paraplegia [**1-5**] Anterior Spinal Infarct
2)Thoracic Aneurysm Repair ([**2128**])
3)Hx of LLL Collapse/PNA s/p mucous plug removal via
bronchoscopy
4)HTN
5)Hyperlipidemia
6)GERD
7)Suprapubic Catheter Placement / UTIs on Ppx Bactrim
8)Fecal Incontinence
9)Depression

denies EthOH, denies drug abuse.  Widowed.  Has 3 sons.  She
lives alone in [**Hospital3 4634**].

ECG: Sinus tachycardia. Left axis deviation. Left anterior
fascicular block. Diffuse non-diagnostic repolarization
abnormalities. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2136-9-12**]
heart rate has increased. Otherwise, no major change.
[**7-2**]: KUB Single AP abdominal radiograph obtained, however,
limited as only the superior portion of the abdomen imaged. The
imaged portion is obscured by overlying pannus, however, the
underlying bowel loops show a nonspecific bowel gas pattern with
mildly air-filled distended loops of colon. No intra-abdominal
free air. Multiple left-sided rib deformities are noted.
[**7-2**]: Single AP chest radiograph compared to [**2137-2-7**] show
slightly increased interstitial lung markings, which may
represent mild edema with areas of new patchy opacity in the
right lung base and left mid lung, which may represent
atelectasis although aspiration/pneumonia would be difficult to
exclude. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The
cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged. Again seen are multiple
left-sided rib deformities.

CT Head:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Moderate opacification from fluid versus mucosal thickening
in the
maxillary sinuses, not [**Last Name (LF) 4646**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] reflect
sinusitis, and
clinical correlation is recommended.

CTA Chest [**2137-7-6**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
2. Mild cardiac decompensation with pulmonary vascular
congestion but no
alveolar edema. Small right pleural effusion.
3. Possible small airways infection in the right middle lobe.
4. Aneurysmal descending aorta, 4 cm. Descending aortic graft in
place
without complication.
5. Enlargement of the pulmonary arteries suggesting underlying
pulmonary
artery hypertension.

[**2137-7-7**] MRI HIP
FINDINGS:
Please note that due to hardware failure, the complete sequences
could not be obtained.
There is a comminuted left proximal femur intertrochanteric
fracture, with
coxa varus orientation. There is a large amount of marrow edema
within the
proximal femur. Marrow edema and a small fracture line also
extends into the femoral neck. However, the marrow signal in the
femoral head appears normal. There is a small left hip joint
effusion. The adjacent left acetabulum appears normal. There is
a large amount of surrounding muscular edema. Also noted is
abnormal marrow signal in bilateral ischial tuberosities, left
greater than right. These areas of abnormal marrow signal are
just deep to the bilateral decubitus ulcers. In the appropriate
clinical setting, these are consistent with osteomyelitis.
The right hip appears normal. There is no evidence of right hip
fracture.
A suprapubic catheter is present. There is a large amount of
pelvic
musculature atrophy, consistent with patient's history of
quadriplegia.
There are spinal cysts which are partially visualized on the T1
images in the sacral spine. Due to lack of T2-weighted images,
these cannot be further evaluated. Differential consideration
includes Tarlov cyst.

8/3 L HIP XR: IMPRESSION:
1. Comminuted intertrochanteric fracture of the proximal left
femur.

2. Sclerosis and osseous irregularity of the left ischial
tuberosity in the region of a vacuum drain is concerning for
osteomyelitis. Correlation with the recently performed MRI is
advised.

[**7-5**] R HIP XR: Markedly limited study without definite evidence
for acute bony injury or marked infection. If there is high
clinical concern, cross-sectional imaging is recommended. Due to
the patient's large size MRI may not be possible and CT scan may
be the best alternative.  (Per discussion with radiologist after
fracture seen on MR, fracture was previously visible on this
film as well, but was poor study)



Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4636**] is a 71yo paraplegic female with PMH as listed
above who presents with transient hypotension and leukocytosis.

1)Hypotension: Patient initially found to be hypotensive with
SBP~90's despite receiving 3L NS. Her baseline SBP is between
110-120's. Upon transfer to the MICU, her BP stabilized. The
drop in her BP may have been early sepsis physiology given
fever, history of recurrent UTI's. She may also have some
underlying autonomic dysregulation given paraplegia. She was
started on Vancomycin and Zosyn given prior culture results
which grew E.coli and enterococcus. After transfer to the floor
on [**2137-7-4**] her BP remained stable SBP 110s-120s, no longer
requiring IVF.

2)Leukocytosis/fevers: Patient noted to have WBC~14.0 and
febrile on admission. Cxray was not very revealing. Her U/A was
positive for leukocytes and nitrites but no WBCs and urine cx
were negative. Plastic surgery was consulted to see patient
while she was in-house and recommended VAC dsg changes q MWF.
She continued to spike fevers until [**7-5**] on Vanc/Zosyn but
remained afeb
