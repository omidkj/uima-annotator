HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 89 year-old female
with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
atrial fibrillation presenting with chronic cough with recent
two to three days worsening.  Her cough is associated with
rhinorrhea as well as productive sputum, which she described
as being whitish.  She additionally describes myalgias, which
are diffuse as well as shortness of breath and wheezing.  The
patient reports that she has "been around many sick people."
She currently resides at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.  Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 1444**] the patient received
Combivent nebulizers in the Emergency Department and
developed rapid atrial fibrillation.  The patient was
tachypneic during this event and received Lopressor 5 mg
intravenously as well as Diltiazem and eventually required a
Diltiazem intravenous drip.  The patient converted to sinus
rhythm and in the Emergency Department reported feeling "much
better" from a respiratory standpoint.  At that time the
patient denies any headache, nausea, vomiting, chest pain,
palpitations, diarrhea, fevers or chills.  The patient was
transferred to the floor for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Atrial fibrillation on Coumadin.
2.  Uterine cancer.
3.  Crohn's disease diagnosed in [**2106**].
4.  Barrett's esophagus, questionable about when her recent
esophagogastroduodenoscopy was.
5.  Depression.
6.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which consist of
emphysema.
7.  Arthritis.
8.  History of resected left upper lobe pulmonary nodule.
9.  History of basal cell carcinoma.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.  She
needs assistance with activities of daily living.  She is not
on home O2 and she is currently DNR/DNI.  She reports a 100
pack year history of tobacco use.  She quit approximately one
year ago.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION FROM ADMISSION:  Vital signs the patient
was afebrile.  Blood pressure 105/60.  Heart rate 81.
Respiratory rate 28.  The patient was 95% on 3 liters nasal
cannula.  Generally, she is an elderly female who is hard of
hearing, oriented times three in no acute distress.  HEENT
the patient is anicteric with dry mucous membranes.  No
lymphadenopathy.  Neck no lymphadenopathy.  JVP flat.
Cardiac examination regular rate.  S1 and S2.  2 out of 6
systolic murmur at the left sternal border.  Pulmonary
examination scattered diffuse expiratory wheezes.  No
crackles.  Shallow breathing.  No use of accessory muscles.
Abdominal examination soft, nontender, nondistended.
Extremities examination normal.  Neurological examination
grossly intact.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  CBC within normal limits.
Chem 10 within normal limits.  Coags within normal limits.
Chest x-ray no evidence of infiltration, bibasilar
atelectasis was noted.  Electrocardiogram sinus rhythm,
normal axis, rate of 90, no ST elevations, no ST depressions.
 Her second electrocardiogram in atrial fibrillation with a
rate of 180, less then [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depression noted in 2, AVF and
V6.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: The patient was
maintained on steroids both by mouth / intravenously and through
nebulizer treatments given her persistent wheezing throughout her
hospital course.  She received nebulizer treatments primarily
consisting of Atrovent as well as MDIs with long acting beta
agonist.  The patient finished a total of seven days of
Azithromycin and was maintained on Solu-Medrol intravenously,
which was converted to Prednisone po, which should be tapered as
an outpatient.  Overall her respiratory status improved, however,
approximately on hospital day three the patient developed acute
hypoxia probably related to mucous plugging versus acute
bronchospasm.  The patient required a one day stay in the
MICU for BiPAP treatment as well as initiation of Diltiazem,
because during this event the patient had developed rapid
atrial fibrillation.  Repeat chest x-ray did not reveal any
new infiltrate or worsening of her baseline chronic lung
disease.

2.  Atrial fibrillation:  The patient came in and out of
atrial fibrillation with a rapid rate.  She required
Diltiazem intravenous push as well as Metoprolol intravenous
push several times during her hospital course.  She was
maintained on telemetry.  Electrophisiology service consulted due
to the difficulty controlling her heart rate and we initiated
Digoxin therapy as well as standing dose of Diltiazem and
Metoprolol.  There was some discussion regarding the possible
need for AV junction ablation and pacemaker placement given the
difficulty controlling her rate.  However, after the patient was
loaded for a total of six doses of Digoxin, we achieved rate
control for over 48 hours.  Upon discharge the patient's Digoxin
level was greater then 3 therefore her standing dose of Digoxin
was held and will need to be reinitiated as an outpatient.

3.  Anticoagulation: The patient's Coumadin was held throughout
her hospital course, because her INR was supratherapeutic as high
as 8.  There is no evidence of active bleeding, however, the
patient did require one transfusion with a hematocrit drop of
approximately four points during her hospital course.  The
patient was given vitamin K to reverse her INR and upon
discharge the patient will need Lovenox with Coumadin to
achieve an INR goal of 2 to 3.

4.  Cardiac:  The patient is on an aspirin, statin, Digoxin,
beta blocker and Diltiazem.

5.  Hyperthyroidism:  The patient previously received Methimazole
on an every other week basis.  She received one dose during this
hospital course and will need follow up as an outpatient.

6.  Gastrointestinal:  There were no active issues during her
hospitalization.  The patient was maintained on mesalamine for
her Crohn's disease with normal bowel movements.  No evidence of
active bleeding.

7.  Code status:  Again code status was addressed during this
hospitalization and it was confirmed that the patient is
DNR/DNI.

FOLLOW UP PLANS:  The patient is instructed to follow up with
her outpatient primary care physician for possible referral
to electrophysiology if she wants to pursue elective ablation
with pacemaker placement.  The patient currently is in atrial
fibrillation, however, she is rate controlled and therefore will
need close follow up as an outpatient.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient is off of oxygen, was
weaned down from 1 liter nasal cannula upon discharge and her
saturation has remained stable.  Additionally the patient's
heart rate has been controlled with ambulation.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient will be discharged to [**Hospital 100**]
Rehab with appropriate follow up with her primary care
physician shortly after discharge.

1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.
