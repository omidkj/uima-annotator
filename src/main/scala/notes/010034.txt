CT LS spine [**1-16**]: IMPRESSION Questionable lucency within the
left transverse process of L5, a finding that is of questionable
significance, however, this area is incompletely evaluated due
to technique on the present examination. If the patient has
symptoms referable to this area and there is clinical concern, a
repeat CT of the lumbar spine in this region could be obtained.

CT Tspine [**1-16**]: IMPRESSION  1. Minimally displaced fracture of
the posterior portion of the left 3rd rib.  2. No other acute
fracture is identified within the thoracic spine, or visualized
portions of the ribs.

CT abd/pelvis [**1-16**]: IMPRESSION 1) Patchy ground glass
opacification in both lung fields likely represents contusion.
No pneumothorax.
2) Fractures of the posterior left third rib and the left
femoral neck as described above.
3) No evidence of intrathoracic vascular injury. No evidence of
intraabdominal solid organ or bowel injury.

CT Cspine [**1-16**]: IMPRESSION  Fracture of the body and right C2
facet involving right C2 vertebral foramen. Correlate with
scheduled CT angiography to exclude vertebral artery injury.

CTA head [**1-16**]:
IMPRESSION: 7 mm enhancing lesion near the right anterior
temporal artery which does not involve the right M1 middle
cerebral artery segment. This finding could represent a
meningioma versus a small aneurysm. Either MR or conventional
angiography may be helpful in differentiating between these
diagnostic entities.

CT head [**1-16**]: IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Soft tissue defect along the left frontal bone.
3. Right nasal bone fracture.
4. Air-fluid level in right maxillary sinuses. No obvious
fracture is seen involving maxillary sinus walls but Facial bone
CT would help for detailed evaluation, if clinically indicated.

FEMUR [**1-16**]: left subtrochanteric and segmental femur fracture

CT KNEE [**1-16**]:
IMPRESSION
1. Extensively comminued fracture of the tibial plateau with
multiple displaced fragments and extensive involvement of the
articular surface, including depressed and impacted fragments of
the articular surface. Dislacement and angulation of the tibia
with respect to the femur.
2. Minimally displaced fracture of the lateral femoral condyle.
3. Lipohemarthrosis.

MRI spine [**1-19**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Although MR is limited in its ability to evaluate the
posterior elements, no malalignment or stenosis of the lumbar
spine are identified.
2. Multiple thoracic and lumbar spine hemangiomas.
3. Known C2 fracture is not well visualized on this exam.

CT Chest [**1-19**]:
IMPRESSION:
1) Technically limited study. Several areas of hypoattenuation
are seen in branches of the right and left pulmonary artery,
which may represent perfusion abnormalities or real filling
defects. This is worrisome for pulmonary emboli, and a repeat
study with better bolus timing is recommeneded for better
evaluation.
2) Bibasilar areas of parenchymal consolidation with associated
small pleural effusions, which may represent atelectasis, though
in the setting of recent trauma, may represent pulmonary
contusion

LOWER EXT ULTRASOUNDS [**1-20**]
IMPRESSION:
No evidence of deep vein thrombosis. Secondary to the patient's
leg cast, only her proximal venous vasculature was imaged and
interrogated.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted for observation and management of her left femur
fracture, right tib fib fracture, cervical fracture, and large
forehead laceration.  Left Femur Fx put in traction in the ED by
ortho, OMFS repaired laceration of forehead.  Femur Fx was
repaired with IM nail on HD 1, external fixation placed on right
tibfib fx at that time.  HD 3 ex fix removed and ORIF of right
tibfib completed.  Also on HD 3, she developed hypoxia and
tachycardia; a CT chest demonstrated a pulmonary embolism and
she was started on heparin IV for anticoagulation.  MRI of
lumbar spine on HD 4 did not identify any lumbar pathology and
patient was removed from logroll precautions and her activity
level was liberated.  Pt was tolerating POs well, moving her
bowels well, and tolerating physical therapy- she was also
transitioned to coumadin for anticoagulation.  She was
transfered to a rehabilitation facility on HD
