Admission Date:  [**2164-1-8**]       Discharge Date:  [**2164-1-14**]

Date of Birth:   [**2091-3-15**]       Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypotension.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 18034**] is a
72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease,
two vessel disease as shown on cardiac catheterization in
[**2161-4-15**], also with an echo showing ejection fraction of 15
to 20% in [**2161-4-15**] and severe mitral regurgitation.
Patient was brought in by his family who founded status post
syncope at home.  Patient recovered consciousness
spontaneously at home.  His blood pressure was checked and it
was found to be in the low 80s.  Patient relates that he has
been very fatigued, unable to move his legs or even hold up
his head because of his weakness for the past two to three
weeks.  They also complain of a decreased appetite for the
same length of time.

The patient was hospitalized at [**Hospital6 **] for
the same complaints three weeks prior to his admission to
[**Hospital1 69**].  The patient reports
that during that hospitalization, his pacer was adjusted,
however they relayed that they did not notice any improvement
since he was discharged.  They also complained that since
discharge, his systolic blood pressure which they check at
home every day has persistently been less than 90.

In the Emergency Department of [**Hospital1 188**] the patient initially presented with a blood pressure
of 102/40 and a heart rate of 60.  He then became hypotensive
with the lowest blood pressure being 68/37.  He then became
unresponsive and he was noticed to have seizure activity and
a short time of apnea which prompted intubation for airway
protection.  He was then started on Dopamine and received IV
fluids for a total of 2.5 liters.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Stroke, one 12 years ago and one 6 years ago which left
him with left sided residual weakness.
2.  Right nephrectomy because of nephrolithiasis and stent
complications which was performed in [**Location (un) **].
3.  Status post pace replacement.
4.  History of thrombus in the left ventricle.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Pravachol 20 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Cozaar 25 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Coreg 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5.  Coumadin 25 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Calcium.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  No history of coronary artery disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Tobacco one and half pack per day for many
years.  He stopped in [**2156**].  Alcohol:  Patient used to drink
one or more of Vodka a day with meals and he also quit in
[**2156**].  He is a retired dentist.  Originally Armanian who
immigrated to the United States from [**Country 532**] in [**2154**].  He
recurrently lives with his family in [**Location (un) **].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Heart rate 79 V-paced, blood pressure
88/47, respiratory 14, oxygen saturation 98% on that.
General impression:  Intubated and sedated.  Ear, nose and
throat:  Supple neck.  Minimally reactive pupils bilaterally.
Moist mucous membranes.  CV:  Regular rate and rhythm, S1,
S2, III/VI systolic murmur at left sternal border.  Lungs
clear to auscultation bilaterally, auscultated anteriorly.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with active bowel
sounds.  Extremities:  Dorsalis pedis palpable bilaterally.
Extremities are cool and clubbing.

LABORATORY DATA:  CBC 8.7, 30.2, 218, MCV 77.  PT 23.2, PTT
36.8, INR 3.6.  Chem-7:  Sodium 126, potassium 5.7 and
repeated at 4.6, chloride 92, bicarbonate 20, BUN 54,
creatinine 2.5, glucose 116, calcium 8.2, magnesium 2.4, phos
3.6.  ALT 22, AST 38, LD 48, CK 68, alkaline phosphatase 98.

Report of cardiac catheterization performed in [**2161-4-15**]
with three vessel disease right dominant system.  LAD with
70% proximal stenosis.  RCA with 100% occluded proximally.
LCX with diffuse disease and no significant stenosis.

Echo performed in [**2161-4-15**] showed left atrium moderately
dilated.

EKG shows patient's AV pace with a heart rate of 68.

Chest x-ray has cardiomegaly without any evidence of
congestive heart failure, left ICD with atrial and
ventricular leads in appropriate position.  Endotracheal tube
in place.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 18034**] is a 72-year-old
male with a history of coronary artery disease and three
vessel disease also with mitral cardiomyopathy as shown on
echo in [**2164-4-14**] which revealed 3+ MR and an ejection
fraction of 15 to 20% status post ICD pacer placement who
presents with hypotension of unclear etiology now intubated
for airway protection.

1.  HYPOTENSION:  The etiology was initially unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **]
presented with two to three weeks of systolic blood pressures
less than 90 which remained unchanged after discharge from
[**Hospital6 **].  During the hospitalization, the
main intervention of resetting of his pacer.  He has a
history of ischemia, but no evidence of angina recently.  His
CK and troponins were cycled and MI was ruled out by cardiac
enzymes.  There was initially no evidence of congestive heart
failure on chest x-ray, however his jugular venous pressure
was above his ear, therefore at least 16 cm.

The patient was found to be volume overloaded most likely
secondary to ineffective pacer settings and valvular
cardiomyopathy.  The patient was initially started on
Dopamine to which he responded very well with improvement of
his blood pressure.  Dopamine was discharged after his blood
pressure had stabilized.  He was then started on Natrecor
plus albumin for diurese.  He responded very well to this
management and during his hospital stay, he diuresed
approximately eight liters.

The pacer was also reset which resulted in marked improvement
in his blood pressure which went from a systolic pressure
ranging from 80 to 100 to a systolic blood pressure ranging
from 100 to 110.  As a result of his increased pressure, he
increased his renal profusion which resulted in decrease in
BUN and creatinine with resolution of his hyponatremia.

The patient had been intubated for airway protection during
questionable seizure activity.  The patient did not have any
more evidence of seizures.  He was extubated the next morning
and did not require any further intubation.

2.  ANTICOAGULATION:  Upon admission, the patient's INR was
3.6.  The patient is currently being anticoagulated with
Coumadin for history of left thrombus on echo in [**2161-4-15**]
and history of atrial fibrillation.  Coumadin was initially
held because his INR was supratherapeutic and was then
discharged before discharge.

3.  CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:  The patient is status post
nephrectomy on the right side.  His baseline creatinine is
1.6.  When he presented his creatinine was 2.5.  This was
most likely secondary to decreased kidney profusion secondary
to hypotension.  The patient's blood pressure raised and his
urine output improved.  His BUN and creatinine decreased and
returned to his baseline values of 1.6 and 1.7.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Fair.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehabilitation facility.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Congestive heart failure.
2.  Hypotension.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Carvedilol 6.25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Bumex 1 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Losartan 25 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Warfarin 4 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Cephalexin 500 mg p.o. q. 25 hours for five days.
7.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.

Of note during his hospital stay, patient developed mild
erythema and swelling over his right arm.  This seems to be
most consistent with right forearm cellulitis which was
treated with Keflex with complete resolution.  The patient
was discharged on a five day course of Keflex.

FOLLOW UP PLAN:  Patient is to follow up with Dr. ..........
at the next available appointment and establish care with Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1059**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2413**] as his new primary care physician who is family
has requested.  The family has agreed to make the follow up
appointments.
