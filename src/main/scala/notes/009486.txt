History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 88M with CAD, CHF, DM who presents from home
with chills and n/v x1 day.
.
Patient's history is limited, and no family members able to be
contact[**Name (NI) **] at time of evaluation in MICU. Per patient, he was
feeling well until [**5-28**] when he develops rigors and sweats. Had
n/v and appetite recently poor. Has been short of breath for the

shot this year.

96% on room air. He was given vancomycin, ceftriaxone,
levofloxacin, zofran, and acetaminophen. Tmax in ER was 104
rectally; he subsequently became hypotensive to 56/34 despite 3L
of IVF. Line placed, started levophed. CXR showed right middle
lung field infiltrate. EKG with old RBBB. Total IVF in ED 5+ L.
Currently 99.5 81 89/65 26 100% on NRB.
.

As above. Also notes occasional constipation and abdominal
discomfort.

[**2160-5-28**] CXR - Right lung pneumonia.
[**2160-5-29**] RUQ US - No evidence for biliary ductal dilatation
[**2160-5-30**] Echo -
The left and right atrium are moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**1-11**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2159-7-9**],
septal motion is abnormal (?new IVCD) and overall left
ventricular systolic funciton is less vigorous. The severity of
tricuspid regurgitation is increased.
[**2160-5-30**] CT Abd/Pelvis -
1. Pericystic stranding and apparent wall thickening suggests a
cystitis.
Correlate with UA.
2. Fluid in the abdomen and pelvis limits the evaluation of the
bowel. There is no abscess.
3. Bilateral lower lobe opacification suggests pneumonia
associated with
pleural effusions, loculated on the right. Empyema is not ruled
out given the appearance.
4. Persistent dense pleural plaque on the right.

Right: Unchanged chronic partially occlusive DVT in R
superficial femoral
vein. No sign of new or acute DVT.
Left: No LLE DVT.

Brief Hospital Course:
88yo male with history of coronary artery disease, CHF, DM, and
prior DVT admitted with septic shock.
.
1. Septic shock
Hypotension is likely related to sepsis. The source of his
sepsis is likely related to klebsiella and enterococcus found on
blood cx, although the source of the GNR and enterococcus is
unclear. His blood pressure improved rapidly with broad spectrum
antibiotics and was weaned off of pressors within 48 hours.  He
was originally started on broad spectrum antibi
