.
[**2136-5-22**] stress MIBI: No anginal symptoms or ischemic EKG changes
noted. 1. Normal myocardial perfusion. 2. Normal left
ventricular cavity size and function on visual inspection.
.
[**6-1**] CXR: The skeletal structures are otherwise unremarkable.
Stable calcified granuloma in the left mid lung zone. Findings
consistent with improving CHF, which is now mild. There are no
pleural effusions or focal consolidations.
.
[**6-5**] Path specimen: Bone and disc, L3-L4, Fibrocartilage and
bone with no significant pathologic change.
.
[**6-5**] CXR: RIJ placed
.
[**6-7**] CXR: RIJ removed, replaced?
.
[**6-7**] Head CT: (for altered MS) No interval change. No acute
hemorrhage or mass effect.
.
[**6-8**] EEG: (post-witnessed seizure). This EEG is consistent with
a moderate encephalopathy of toxic, metabolic, or anoxic
etiology.
.
[**6-8**] CXR: RIJ. ET tube (intubated)
.
[**6-9**] MRI/A head: No evidence of acute infarct. Ventriculomegaly
and prominence of sulci. Although the ventriculomegaly is
somewhat out of proportion for sulci, the appearances are most
likely due to atrophy. However, clinical correlation is
recommended to rule out normal pressure hydrocephalus. Severe
changes of small vessel disease in the periventricular white
matter. normal MRA.
.
[**6-9**] MRI L spine: Since the previous MRI of [**2136-3-1**], the patient
has undergone laminectomy at L4-5 level. Increased endplate
changes and enhancement within the disc at this level indicate
discitis and osteomyelitis. There is now apparent narrowing of
the spinal canal at L4-5 level, which is related to soft tissue
changes at the laminectomy defect with indentation on the thecal
sac on the posterior aspect. This could be related to hematoma
at the laminectomy site compressing the thecal sac from the
posterior aspect. Fat suppressed post-gadolinium T1-weighted
images and inversion recovery images would be helpful for
further evaluation, as clinically appropriate.
.
[**6-9**] MRI C Spine: Overall, no change in the appearances of
cervical spine compared to the prior MRI of [**2136-3-1**]. Signal
changes involving the left lateral mass of C2 are again noted
with some enhancement, unchanged from the previous study.
Degenerative changes are again seen in the cervical region.
.
[**6-10**] 24 hr EEG: (s/p 2nd seizure): This showed an encephalopathy
throughout. There were no major focal findings. There were no
epileptiform features. Medications, metabolic disturbances, and
infection are among the most common causes of such
encephalopathies.
.
[**6-11**] 24 hr EEG: It showed a slow and often low voltage
background in all areas indicative of an encephalopathy. There
were no prominent focal abnormalities, but encephalopathies may
mask focal abnormalities. There were no epileptiform features.
.
[**6-15**] EEG: This is a moderately abnormal EEG due to the presence
of
generalized and bifrontal slow waves at times suggestive of
triphasic
waves, superimposed upon a slow background. This pattern is most

consistent with a moderate encephalopathy and may be related to
the
patient's history of renal disease. There was no evidence of
ongoing
epileptogenesis.
.
[**6-17**] MRI Lumbar spine: At L4-5 endplate changes as before with
enhancement and increased T2 signal which are indicative of
discitis and osteomyelitis. There is severe spinal canal
stenosis at the L4-5 level. Interval worsening of the diffuse
epidural process noted with severe stenosis at these levels.
Phlegmon vs early abscess(1.6 x 2.4 x 2.1 cms ) is noted along
the posterior soft tissues at L4/5. No definite drainable fluid
noted.

TTE [**6-21**]: The LA is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric LVH.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed with probable
basal inferior hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. Trace AR is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**11-20**]+) MR is seen. There
is moderate pulm artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable
for review) of [**2135-5-26**], probable basal inferior hypokinesis is
now noted. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation is now present.

.
CXR [**6-25**]: 1. Improved interstitial pulmonary edema.
2. Slightly improved left pleural effusion.
3. Mild linear atelectasis in the left lower lobe.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was taken to the OR for L4/5 laminectomy/fusion on
[**2136-6-5**].  The surgery went without incident.  The patient
remained afebrile with stable vital signs and was given Abx for
48 hours.  He has a witnessed seizure post-op on [**6-7**] and was
tramsferred to the MICU on [**6-8**].  He was intubated [**6-7**] for
airway protection/apnea and extubated successfully on [**6-10**].
MRI/A head was performed on [**6-9**] which re
