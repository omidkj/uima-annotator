History of Present Illness:
 63 yo M with HTN, hyperlipidemia, and newly diagnosed multiple

KNEE (2 VIEWS) RIGHT PORT  [**2105-12-2**] 5:30 PM

Frontal and lateral projections of right knee, with no
comparison on PACS, show total right knee replacement prosthesis
in near anatomic alignment, and no hardware complications. The
suprapatellar effusion is moderate. Osteophytes are present in
the patella. Calcifications within the distal quadriceps tendon.
Multiple surgical clips are present.

IMPRESSION: Right total knee replacement with no complications.

[**2105-12-2**] CT SINUS

FINDINGS: No prior studies of the head are available for
comparison.

There is an endotracheal tube in place as well as an orogastric
tube.

There is minimal mucosal thickening of the right frontoethmoidal
recess. There is moderate mucosal thickening of the left
sphenoid air cell and minimal mucosal thickening of the right
sphenoid air cell. Minimal mucosal thickening with small
polypoid lesions is seen within the maxillary sinuses
bilaterally. The right OMU is widely patent. The left OMU is
somewhat narrowed but still patent. There is bilateral [**Doctor Last Name 13856**]
bullosa. Nasal septum is deviated to the right with a
right-sided nasal septal spur. The cribriform plates are
essentially symmetric.

There are no areas of bony destruction. The visualized mastoid
air cells are clear. No suspicious bony abnormalities are seen.
The visualized orbits are normal. The visualized intracranial
structures are grossly normal. Fluid is seen within the
nasopharynx.

IMPRESSION: Mucosal changes of the paranasal sinuses as
described above in the setting of orogastric and endotracheal
tubes. No areas of bony destruction.

[**2105-12-2**] CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST [**2105-12-2**]:

IMPRESSION:

1) Circumferential complex right pleural disease likely due to
organizing phase of empyema. No large loculated collections.

2) Bibasilar consolidation likely due to provided history of
pneumonia. High attenuation focus within left basilar
consolidation may be due to aspirated barium if the patient has
received oral contrast at the outside hospital.

3) Small left pleural effusion and trace ascites.

4) Slight overdistention of endotracheal tube cuff.

5) Distended loops of bowel within the imaged portion of the
upper abdomen on scout image incompletely evaluated. Consider
dedicated abdominal radiograph if warranted clinically.

6) Incompletely imaged distended gallbladder.

MRI OF THE TOTAL SPINE

HISTORY: 63-year-old man with strep pneumonia, septic arthritis,
and empyema who is persistently febrile; assess for epidural
abscess.

MR OF THE CERVICAL SPINE:

TECHNIQUE: Sagittal pre-gado T1, post-gado T1 with and without
fat sat, T2, STIR; axial T2-weighted images of the cervical
spine were obtained as part of the total spine protocol.

FINDINGS: No comparisons are available.

There is enhancement and T2 hyperintensity of the
retropharyngeal/prevertebral soft tissues extending from the
skull base to the C3 level which is concerning for
cellulitis/phlegmon. No discrete fluid collections are
identified concerning for abscesses.

There is minimal T2 hyperintensity and enhancement of the right
side of the C2 vertebral body but without destructive changes of
the adjacent endplates or signal abnormalities of the C2/3 disc.
There is possible T1 hyperintensity in this region on the
pre-gado images. These findings likely represent a hemangioma.

The remainder of the visualized bone marrow signal is normal
with no loss of vertebral body heights.

At C3/4, there are degenerative changes of the right
uncovertebral and facet joints causing mild right foraminal
stenosis.

At C4/5, there are degenerative changes of the right facet and
uncovertebral joints as well as thickening of the ligamentum
flavum which is causing moderate right foraminal stenosis.

At C5/6, there is a disc osteophyte complex eccentric to the
right and thickening of the ligamentum flavum, the combination
of which is causing mild canal stenosis but no foraminal
stenoses.

No paraspinal soft tissue abnormalities are seen.

MR OF THE THORACIC SPINE:

TECHNIQUE: Sagittal pre-gado T1, post-gado T1 with and without
fat sat, T2, STIR; axial T2-weighted images of the thoracic
spine were obtained as part of a total spine protocol.

FINDINGS: No comparisons are available.

The alignment of the thoracic spine is normal. The visualized
bone marrow signal is normal with no loss of vertebral body
heights or intervertebral disc space heights. Spinal canal is
widely patent.

At T2/3, T5/6, T6/7, T8/9, and T9/10, there are small disc
protrusions which are not contacting the ventral cord.

Partially imaged is an azygos lobe of the right lung. There are
also loculated fluid collections within the right pleural space
and consolidation of the right lower lobe with apparent
br
