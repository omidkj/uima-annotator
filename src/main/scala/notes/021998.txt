Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2009**]
Chief Complaint:
DKA

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Balloon angioplasty of left ramus


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 66yo F with history of DM who presented to an OSH
24 hours after her house caught fire with nausea and vomiting.
Patient had some exposure to smoke and had soot over her face
and clothes when she went to a friend's house but none in her
mouth.  She was to be in DKA with elevated troponin suspecious
for ACS.  At [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], she had a junctional rhythm on EKG
and was given lopressor with good response.  She also received
7.5 units insulin over 1 hr with 1000cc.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vs were: T 98 P 118 BP 105/67 R 14 O2
sat 97% 3L NC.  EKG initially had ST elevations in V2-3 which
evolved to TWI V5-6 and deep T waves in V2-4.  Cardiology saw
her and felt these were c/w ischemia.  A bedside echo was done,
and she was started on a heparin drip with plans for eventual
cath.  She was guaiac negative and had an anion gap of 22 with
ketones in her urine.  Patient was started on a insulin drip at
5.5 units/hr and given 3 liters of fluid.  She also received
750mg levaquin for UTI, 40mEq of potassium and CVL was placed
given borderline hypotension.  Vitals on transfer were 99.8
rectal, 131, 95/54, 23, 94% 4LNC.
.
In the ICU, she says she is tired and stopped seeing her doctors
3 years ago after her husband died.  She has not taken any
medications since then.  Today, she came to the hospital because
she had intractable vomiting after leaving her house (while it
was in flames) and going to a friend's house.  Her review of
systems otherwise is grossly negative and significant for no
chest pain, palpitations, cough or dyspnea.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Denies diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in
bowel habits. Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency. Denies
arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rashes or skin changes.

[**2156-4-29**]
COMPARISON: Rest of chest radiograph obtained approximately
three hours
earlier.
  .
Portable AP chest radiograph: In comparison to the chest
radiograph obtained
approximately three hours earlier, there appears to be increased
vascular
congestion and increase in cardiac silhouette consistent with
mild fluid
overload pattern. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
pneumothorax is noted.
 .
.
.
ECHO [**2156-4-29**]
Severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the distal two-thirds of the left
ventricle. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. No mitral regurgitation is seen.
.
Impression: Overall appearance appears consistent with Takotsubo
cardiomyopathy given basal sparing and akinesis of the distal
two-thirds of the ventricle. No significant aortic stenosis or
mitral regurgitation seen.

Cardiac Cath
[**2156-4-30**]
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated one vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA, LAD,
LCx and
RCA had no angiographically apparent coronary artery disease.
The ramus
had a long 90% lesion.  There appeared to be global anterior
wall motion
abnormality with no stenosis in the LAD, no hinge point and no
area of
myocardial bridging.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normotension.
3. Successful balloon angioplasty only of the proximal Ramus
Intermedius
lesion with 2.0 X 12 mm Apex balloon at 12 atms. Final angiogram
showed
30% residual stenosis, no dissection and normal flow.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful balloon angioplasty only of the Ramus Intermedius,
that
was too small for a stent.
3. There appears to be a global anterior wall motion abnormality
with no
stenosis in the LAD, no hinge point and no area where there is a

myocardial bridge.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname **] is 66F with PMH of DM2 now presenting with DKA and
takotsubo's cardiomyopathy while fleeing from having her home
burn down.
.
# DKA: Upon admission to outside hospital pH 7.17 with glucose
1000, ketones 150 in urine, bicarb 15, anion gap 26, serum
glucose of 350, lactate 1.  This likely represents DKA secondary
to severe physiologic, emotional stress.  She is a known long
standing diabetic previously on oral hypoglycemics who has been
not taking medications and out of touch with medical care for
the past 3 years.  No other secondary stressors leading to
precipitation of DKA were identified.  She has a negative CXR
and blood cultures show no growth to date.  This resolved with
fluid resuscitation and insulin at both the outside hospital and
in treatment at the [**Hospital3 **] ICU.  She was started on
metformin 500mg [**Hospital1 **]. Additionally, she was started on insulin
which was titrated to the attached regimen (glargine 26U QHS and
humalog SS).  Due to her aggressive fluid resuscitation and
heart failure, she initally had O2sats ~90% on 2L nasal cannula
on transferred to the floor.  With diuresis, her fluid status
improved and she was weaned from oxygen.

***She will be discharged with a diuretic (lasix 20mg daily) and
her electrolytes/volume status should be monitored on this
medication.***
.
#Takotsubo cardiomyopathy: Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], she had mild
troponin elevations and ST segment elevations in precordial
leads.  Subsequent echo showed LV apical hypokinesis with an EF
of 35-40%.  She did also undergo cardiac cath, where she had a
left ramus lesion which was targeted with balloon angioplasty.
However this lesion was ultimately felt to be unlikely to be
clinically signficant as it was not associated with a
significant wall motion abnormality.  Taking all of this
together, it was felt that takotsubo cardiomyopathy was the most
likely diagnosis.  For this, she was started on metoprolol,
atorvastatin and ASA 81.  Per cardiology, it was f
