Chief Complaint:
Dizziness, diarrhea

History of Present Illness:
55 year-old female with a history of ESRD secondary to
hypertensive nephropathy, transitioning from HD to PD, SVC
syndrome [**12-27**] clots on anticoagulation, recent line infection
with E.cloacae on ceftazidime admitted with hypotension and
diarrhea found to have C.diff colitis now somewhat improved on
PO vanco and IV flagyl. The patient was admitted to the MICU on
[**7-15**] [**12-27**] hypotension in the ED. In the MICU, the patient was
fluid repleted, given peripheral dopamine, and ruled out for MI.
Renal is following and managing her HD and PD.
.
Patient was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) 17901**]
enterobacter bacteremia, and began treatment with ceftazidime at
HD and empirically in peritoneal diasylate with plans for 3 week
course starting [**6-28**] (last day would be [**7-18**]). She states that
she began having very frequent liquid diarrhea after discharge
from the hospital with slight blood, mucous in stool. Reports
dizziness and a presyncopal episode, especially with standing
over past 2 weeks. Pt was seen by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 805**] on [**7-8**] and had
stool culture sent at that time that was negative, no c. diff
was sent.
.
She has denied abd pain, SOB, chills, CP. States appetite has
been normal, no N/V. Reported her dry weight at 78Kg, was 78Kg
at HD prior to HD on Monday. Gets HD M and F at [**Location (un) **] in

was retaining water because her face was "puffy." Reports her
normal BPS 100-120s. Has noted her BPs have been low, has been
holding her lisinopril and taking half dose of her atenolol.

CT Abdomen/Pelvis ([**2128-7-29**]):  1. There is expansion and
hyperdensity involving the right gluteus musculature, consistent
with an acute hematoma. 2. Diffuse anasarca, with marked edema
of the subcutaneous tissues. Intra-abdominal fluid is likely
related to peritoneal dialysis.
3. Mild interval increase in nodes about the right inguinal
region.
4. Left renal cyst, with a questionable thin rim of enhancement
posteriorly. MRI is recommended to exclude a solid component in
this lesion.


Brief Hospital Course:
55 year-old female with ESRD, transitioning from HD to PD, SVC
syndrome [**12-27**] clots on anticoagulation, recent line infection
with E.cloacae, admitted with hypotension and diarrhea found to
have C.diff colitis, treated with oral vancomycin, subsequently
developed R. gluteal bleed likely from heparin gtt, transfused 2
units, Hct stable since, to be placed on warfarin and
discharged.
.
.
## Functional SVC syndrome: Patient's face and upper extremities
are diffusely anasarcic due to SVC clot, thought to be from
indwelling catheter.  IR attempted multiple times to perform
venoplasty and alleviate the clot in some manner, but was
unsuccessful, and concluded that further intervention would not
be warranted in light of HD catheter presence.  Additionally,
given that the patient was on heparin gtt for most of these
procedures, she developed a spontaneous R. gluteal bleed seen
via CT scan.  Heparin was discontinued, and the patient received
2 units of PRBC's through dialysis catheter, and another 2 units
two days later. Hct has been stable since.
.
## Asthma:  patient had an episode of shortness of breath with
expiratory wheezes on exam.  Desaturated to 90-92 percent on RA,
lower than baseline of 97-100 percent on RA.  Given albuterol
nebulizers which alleviated the problem, will be discharged on
this medication.
.
## Hypotension/syncope: pt had hypotension and syncope, was
fluid responsive, on dialysis, no events after initial episode
since, patient had all antihypertensive medications held.
.
## C.diff colitis: pt. admitted for colitis and treated
successfully with 14 day course of PO vancomycin.  No fevers
once on Abx, and cultures have since been negative to date.
.
## ESRD: Was in a period of transition from Hemodialysis to
Peritoneal Dialysis, unable to dialyze peritoneally adquately,
so patient had her HD catheter continually in place and is
having a prolonged transition period.  IR replaced old HD
catheter, which may have been source for SVC clot, with new one
on [**2128-7-29**].  The patient also had a CT scan of the abdomen and
pelvis which showed a small atrophic cyst of the L. kidney which
may warrant a future MRI.
.
## OSA: CPAP was in use throughout stay.
.
## H/O GNR bacteremia: Blood cultures were monitored, patient
was placed on ceftazidime and finished course with no blood
culture growth to date.
.
## Depression: Continued celexa
.
## Anemia: Continued EPO and Iron infusions with dialysis.
.
## Post-herpetic neuralgia: Continued gabapentin
.
## CAD: No active symptoms or ecg changes during this admission.
.
## GERD: continued PPI
