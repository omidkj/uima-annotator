Radiology
=========
CTA Chest [**9-24**] - IMPRESSION: 1. Findings consistent with acute
pulmonary embolism. 2. Right upper lobe pneumonia. 3. Interval
increase in size of multiple pulmonary nodules. 4. Interval
increase in size of hypodense liver lesions. 5. Findings
consistent with known esophageal carcinoma post-stenting.
.
Knee XR bilateral [**9-25**] - Mild osteoarthritis. No radiographic
evidence of gout or avascular necrosis.
.
CXR [**9-25**] -
Cavitating ill-defined density in the right upper lobe
suggestive of pneumonic consolidation, however, a neoplasm
cannot be entirely excluded and follow up to clearance is
recommended.
.
CXR [**9-26**] - Two AP views were brought to our review, but note is
made that both of them do not include part of the right upper
lobe. Within the limitation of this radiograph, the impression
is that there is an improvement of the right upper lobe as well
as left lower lobe opacities consistent with resolution of
infectious process/aspiration. No other abnormalities are seen
within the limitation of this limited radiograph.
.
CXR [**9-28**] -  Both extent and the density of the previous right
upper lobe
opacity has markedly decreased. On today's examination, only
subtle remnant opacities are seen. The other lung parenchyma
still displays subtle opacities in the left lung, at the level
of the hilus and in projection on the left costophrenic sinus. A
linear opacity is seen in the right upper lobe. The lateral
radiograph displays the peripheral esophageal stent.

Cardiology
========
TTE [**9-25**] - The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal for the patient's body size. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow
tract obstruction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot
be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. The mitral
valve leaflets have normal thickness. The mitral valve leaflets
are elongated. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral
valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
quality. There is systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve
leaflets. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
small pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2104-9-24**],
the mild resting LVOT gradient and valvular systolic anterior
motion of the mitral valve are more apparent. No vegetations
identified, but the image quality was suboptimal. If clinically
indicated, a TEE would be recommended for assessment of
endocarditis.
.
EGD [**9-30**]: Localized erythematous mucosa with edema and
friability noted in the esophagus adjacent to the proximal
border of the metal stent. No frank ulceration or active
bleeding noted. The mucosa in the upper third of the esophagus,
proximal to the stent was nodular. This could represent tumor,
reactive process or less likely varices.


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT: Mr. [**Known lastname 36365**] 53 yo M with PMH of metastatic
esophageal cancer (liver, lung, bone mets), known LE DVT on
lovenox, ESRD [**2-2**] IgA s/p renal transplant who presented with
diffuse arthralgias and RUQ/pleuritic chest pain and found to
have PE and RUL pna. Also had an episode of hematemesis vs
coffee ground emesis in ED prior to admission.
.
.
## Pulmonary Embolism: Patient developed embolism in setting of
known DVT and missing a dose of lovenox at home (although
unclear as this may not represent Lovenox failure, as he had a
known DVT at the time which could have embolized). Patient
contines to be hemodynamically stable and saturating well on RA.
TTE did not demonstrate right heart strain which suggests that
the PE is likely small. Very difficult management given recent
hematemesis, but likely benefits of anticoagulation outweigh
risks of holding lovenox given no more episodes of hematemesis
since ED.  He was sent home to continue his old Lovenox dose
with specific instructions not to miss [**First Name (Titles) 691**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4319**].

.
## RUL pna: Pna reported on CTA Chest as well a
