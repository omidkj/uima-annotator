History of Present Illness:
Dr. [**Known lastname **] is a an 80 yoM with a history of severe COPD,
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, spinal stenosis,
AFib/flutter, and CHF with EF 60% from [**6-5**] echo. He Per notes
from EMS, he had a BP of 84/54 on arrival to [**Hospital1 **] of [**Location (un) 16824**] and his metoprolol order was decreased from 100 mg TID to
100 mg [**Hospital1 **]. His BP this morning was 60-70's/40-50's with HR
75-104 in Afib. He was noted to be in AFib with RVR in the ED
only, per the reports. He was wheezing this am and in some
placed noted as being SOB though he refused his nebs. He was
just in the hospital from [**Date range (1) 11735**]/10 for LLL pneumonia treated
with Vancomycin/Aztreonam/Flagyl (10 day course; to end [**2183-9-4**]).

.
In the ED, HR was 105-126 with BP 99/46. He was given 1 L NS and
continued his three antibiotics; no HR medications were given.
He denies chest pain, cough, SOB, fevers, chills, abdominal
pain, and HA. He was given 1LNS.
.
Of note, he has had multiple hospitalizations recently. In [**Month (only) **]
he was hospitalized for LLL CAP treated with levofloxacin; his
course was complicated by CHF as well as AFib/RVR and
hypotension. Earlier in [**Month (only) 216**] he was treated with levofloxacin
for a bronchitis. Last week, he had a chest CT that did not show
mass causing post-obstructive pneumonia

MICROBIOLOGY:
Blood Cx [**8-31**]: PENDING AT DISCHARGE

RADIOLOGY:
Overall, this examination is similar to the prior dated
[**8-27**], [**2182**]. There is bibasilar atelectasis, more prominent on the
left with
retrocardiac opacification. A left-sided pleural effusion is
also present.
There is also some pulmonary vascular congestion. The proximal
aspect of a
right-sided PICC line is seen, although its course can not be
seen distal to the right chest wall and proximal migration of
the PICC can not be excluded.


Brief Hospital Course:
HYPOTENSION: Likely related to being in atrial fibrillation with
RVR. [**Month (only) 116**] have also been related to recent uptitration of
metoprolol tartrate to 100 TID from 100 [**Hospital1 **] on last
hospitalization. BP stabilized with rate control and reduced
dose of metoprolol. Not suspicious for sepsis given BP
stabilized with rate control and no radiologic or laboratory
evidence of worsening PNA.

ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: In RVR on admission which improved after
restarting metoprolol, which was actually reduced to 50mg Q6
(was 100mg TID at time of last discharge). HR now well
controlled in 70's. Would continue this dose of metoprolol
tartrate and eventually transition to once a day succinate when
HR proves stable. We held patient's enalapril while we are
titrating up metoprolol. Would suggest restarting enalapril when
you have completed this titration. You should cont outpatient
regimen of amiodarone 200mg daily. Patient has not been on
anti-coagulation given his fall risk. Please make an appt for pt
to see his cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] within the next [**7-5**]
days [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6937**].

ELEVATED VANCOMYCIN TROUGH: Hold Vancomycine today and lower
dose to 750mg Q24
tomorrow. Would also advise checking another am Vanc dose
tomorrow.

ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA: Diagnosed with LLL aspiration pneumonia on
last admission ([**Date range (1) 11735**]).Currently on
Vancomycin/Aztreonam/Flagyl (10 day course; to end [**2183-9-4**]).  No
evidence of worsening respiratory status on this admission..
-- cont Vancomycin/Aztreonam/Flagyl through [**2183-9-4**]
-- maintain aspiration precautions

HYPONATREMIA: Thought to be secondary to SIADH. Na has
normalized to 134 at time of discharge. Would suggest free water
restricting to 1500 mL/day and concentrating antibiotics.

ULCERATIVE COLITIS:
-- cont home asacol

DIABETES TYPE II: Cont home regimen of glargine 30 units QHS and
Humalog SS. Please titrate both glargine and SS as needed to
maintain stable blood sugars.

KNOWN ASPIRATION RISK: failed S&S at last admission.  Video
swallow studies showed frank aspiration and esophageal
dysmotility.  Per discharge summary, he had requested to
continue eating despite the aspiration risk and declined PEG. He
also refused endoscopy for evaluation of GI dysmotility at last
admission, and wants to follow up on this issue as an
outpatient.
-- continue Reglan 5 mg PO with meals and at bedtime (started at
last admission)

ACCESS: PICC line, which per CXR may have migrated proximally.
Can be removed when he finishes ABX course.

CODE: DNR/DNI on this admission.
