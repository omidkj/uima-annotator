History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 38 year old female with ALL s/p double cord
blood SCT [**1-/2173**] c/b GVHD, severe left ventricular systolic
dysfunction attributed to chemotherapy for ALL as well as XRT
for [**Year (4 digits) 3242**] (EF 15-20%), embolic CVA now on coumadin, asthma,
hypertension and chronic kidney disease who was sent in from onc
floor today for confusion.  Pt arrived for appointment with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] today; she thought she was to go to 7F to see her MD.
In actuality, she had no appointment today, and her appointment
would have been in [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] had she had one.  Per her father, she
has been confused for 3-4 days with complaints of recurrent and
chronic abdominal pain.  She describes her abdominal pain as
constant and nonradiating, the same as always.
.
In the ED, VS 97.1 77 135/105 16 100% RA.  In ED, AOx2(not date)
with c/o abdominal pain. Labs notable for creatinine 3.6,
Lactate 8, K 6, ALT 210 AP: 173 Tbili: 4.7 AST: 144 LDH: 575
Dbili: 3.7 Lip: 154. AG 24. WB 14.9 plt 131 Hct 31 INR: 16.7.  A
right femoral line was placed.  Head CT was negative.  CXR was
unremarkable.  Given calcium Gluconate 1g/10mL, Sodium
Kayexelate 30mg, Phytonadione 10mg/mL Amp,
Vanc/Piperacillin-Tazob. She was afebrile in ED and prior to
leaving 80 137/95 20 100% on RA. She received 1 amp d50, 10units
of insulin. She received 1L NS.
.
Of note patient had recent admission to [**Hospital Ward Name 3242**] [**Date range (3) 94160**]
where she presented with nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain in
addition to acute on chronic renal failure. She was found to
have peritonitis with lymphocytic predominance with unclear
etiology but Tb vs malignancy was explored. It seems she was
seen by cardiology for CHF (including ICU stay for diuresis with
BP support), renal for ARF, psych for coping, ID for peritonitis
and surgery for peritonitis.  Surgery did not think it wise to
do peritoneal biopsy.  There is no discharge summary, but
following medication changes appear to have occurred: start
acyclovir, stop carvedilol and start Toprol, decrease torsemide
to 40mg daily (from 40mg).
.
She was last seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**5-20**] at which point
prednisone was decreased to 50 mg a day.  She was continued on
Cellcept despite a slight transaminitis at that time.  She also
had thrush and was started on fluconazole.  Bactrim was
continued for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].  Her torsemide was increased to
60mg qday due to worse lower extremity edema.
.
Upon arrival to the ICU, pt's father reports improvement in MS
since interventions in ED.

Past Medical History:
ALL:
- initially presented in [**2172-8-5**] right chest and right upper
extremity pain and paresthesias and visual blurriness. WBC
149,000; received leukapheresis, started on hydroxyurea.
Diagnosed with precursor B-cell ALL.
- underwent phase I induction with daunorubicin, vincristine,
dexamethasone, L-asparaginase, MTX; phase II with
cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, mercaptopurine, MTX
- Bone Marrow Aspirate/Biopsy on [**2172-10-26**] showed no morphologic
evidence of residual leukemia
- underwent allo double cord blood SCT [**2173-1-11**], course
complicated by neutropenic fever and acute skin GVHD
- subsequent course has been complicated by pseudomonas
pneumonia
in [**5-15**], empiric treatment of CMV pericarditis in [**7-15**], chronic
nausea and vomiting which has been treated as GVHD with steroids
though colonoscopies in [**8-14**] and [**11-14**] were negative for GVHD.

- Asthma
- Hypertension
- Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia
- C-section in [**2165**]
