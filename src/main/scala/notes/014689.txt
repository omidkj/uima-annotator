Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Phenytoin / Tegretol

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3705**]
Chief Complaint:
BRBPR, hypotension


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Colonoscopy

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 78 year old male with a history of stroke
(residual partial aphasia), CAD, hypertension, diastolic CHF
with recent switch to Torsemide, and AFib with recent initiation
Dabigatran who presents with BRBPR.  He had a visit with his PCP
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2101-4-20**], at which he was feeling well with recent improvement
in his LE edema and breathing after switching to Torsemide on
[**2101-3-30**].  Immediately after the visit and over the next 3 days,
he felt intermittently lightheaded, but otherwise close to his
baseline.
.
Earlier today, he noted BRB after a bowel movement, which was
new for him.  Given his recent initiation of Dabigatran in
[**Month (only) 404**], he was concerned by the bleeding and contact[**Name (NI) **] his PCP,
[**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] recommended [**Name (NI) **] evaluation.  He denies any bruising or easy
bleeding other than the above-mentioned blood in his diaper.
Over the past couple of hours that is daughter has been with
him, he has not had any stools, and he reported that for the
most part his stools have been brown.
.
In the ED, initial VS were T 98.2, HR 90, BP 92/49, RR 16, and
SpO2 100% on RA.  Physical exam showed irregular tachycardia,
clear lungs, slight LE edema, and benign abdomen.  Rectal exam
was notable for bright red blood and streaks of brown stool.
Notable labs included Hct 33.7 down from 37.5 on [**2101-3-25**],
creatinine 2.6 up from baseline 1.6 with creatine 0.6 on [**2101-4-20**]
most likely spurious.  CXR showed no acute process with clear
lung fields and mild-moderate cardiomegaly.  ECG showed atrial
fibrillation at 86-101 bpm with RBBB, unchanged from prior on
[**2101-3-30**].  GI was consulted and recommended observation with
consideration of CTA if developing rapid bleeding.
.
Access was obtained with three 18g PIVs.  He was given normal
saline 1500 ml with continued mild tachycardia and blood
pressure 90s-100s, which seems to be slightly below his baseline
of around 120/80 seen at recent clinic visits.  He was also
given about 400 ml of sodium bicarbonate 150 mEq in D5W in
anticipation of possible need for CTA.
.
He was admitted to the MICU for continued monitoring.  VS prior
to transfer were T 97.5, HR 80, BP 104/53, RR 20, and SpO2 99%
on RA.  On arrival to the MICU, he reported feeling close to his
baseline without any specific complaints.

Dishcarge Labs:

Imaging:
CXR ([**2101-4-22**]):
The patient is status post sternotomy. The heart is
mild-to-moderately enlarged. The aortic arch is partly
calcified. The
cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. The
lungs appear
clear. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
Mild-to-moderate
osteophytes are noted along the visualized thoracolumbar spine.

Final Report
INDICATION: Swelling.

COMPARISON: None available.

LE ultrasound:
FINDINGS: Waveforms in the common femoral veins are symmetric
bilaterally
with appropriate response to Valsalva maneuvers. In both lower
extremities, the common femoral, proximal greater saphenous,
superficial femoral and popliteal veins are normal with
appropriate compressibility, wall-to-wall flow on color Doppler
analysis and response to waveform augmentation. Wall-to-wall
flow is also present in the posterior tibial and peroneal veins
on the left as well as in the posterior tibial veins on the
right. The peroneal vein in the
right calf was not visualized. Just anterior to the right common
femoral
vasculature, proximal to the insertion of the greater saphenous
vein is a
large ovoid hypoechoic collection measuring 5.2 x 1.4 cm,
without internal
vascularity.

IMPRESSION:
1. No deep venous thrombosis in either lower extremity. The
peroneal veins
in the right calf were not visualized.
2. Ovoid hypoechoic collection measuring 5.2 cm in the right
groin, possibly a seroma, chronic hematoma or lymphocele.

Final Report
SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST

REASON FOR EXAM: Fever, right pneumonia.

Comparison is made to the prior study, [**4-28**].

Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Vascular congestion has
resolved.  The left lobe is clear. There is no pneumothorax. If
any, there is a small right pleural effusion. Multifocal right
lung opacities have improved, consistent with improving
pneumonia.
