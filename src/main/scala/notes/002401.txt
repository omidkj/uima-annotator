Brief Hospital Course:
The blood from rectum was most likely retained blood from his
Hartmann's Pouch. No scope was performed and the bleeding did
not recur.
In the ER, he was febrile to 103 and requiring
ventilation.  He was hypotensive to the high 80s but did not
require pressors.  He was transfused two PRBC for a hct of 23.
He was treated in the ER with vancomycin, levofloxacin and
flagyl, but was started on empiric therapy with
vancomycin and Zosyn in the SICU.  His fever was initially
thought to be due to
partial lobar collapse discovered on a [**3-20**] CT torso.  There was
no evidence of abscess in the abdomen or pelvis. Postoperative
changes from AAA repair were seen.
However a blood culture from [**3-18**] grew yeast.  Following his
fevers in the ER he became hypothermic consistent with a
fungemia.  An ID consult was obtained.  He was started on
mycofungin and the vanco/zosyn was stopped.  He became
normothermic and his white count decreased from 14 to 9.  An
echo on [**3-23**] showed no vegetations and an EF of 40-45%.
Opthalmology was consulted to rule out fungal endophthalmitis.
They recommended tobramycin for 5 days.
His mental status was alert, oriented, and cooperative with
occasional episodes of confusion.  He would become more
lethargic in the evenings.  He was rested on the ventilator
overnight and placed to trach collar during the day.  He had a
tracheostomy change on the 14th and passy muir valve was
employed successfully.
His foley catheter was removed [**3-20**].  He pulled out his picc
line on [**3-21**] which was to be removed anyway because of infection
risk.
He was advanced to a regular diet, eating full meals and taking
in over a liter of fluid and supplements by HD 3.  He became
hypernatremic to 150, but this resolved with IV free water.
His abdominal wound was intially treated with wet to dry
dressings and then with a vac.  His sacral pressure ulcer was
treated by the wound nurse and frequent positioning changes.
He was seen by PT and he was able to get OOB to a chair.
Prior to discharge his fungal coverage was changed from
mycofungin to fluconazole.  A picc line was placed by IR for
access.
