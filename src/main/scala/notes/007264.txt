HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was transferred from
[**Hospital3 **] due to hypoxia and mild hypotension secondary
to newly diagnosed pulmonary embolism.

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a known history of
coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease and recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer.
The patient was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2129-2-21**] for
elective wedge resection of a right lower lobe mass.  The
mass was found to be non-small cell lung cancer.  The patient
did well postoperatively and was transferred to the
Transitional Care Unit for rehabilitation.  Reportedly, the
patient was ambulating freely until five days ago.  Two days
prior to admission to [**Hospital6 256**],
she developed dyspnea with oxygen saturation decreasing to
the 80s in room air.  The patient was transferred to the MICU
at [**Hospital3 **].  There, she was hypotensive.  Her blood
pressure improved with fluid administration.  She was found
to have bilateral pulmonary emboli on CT angiogram.  Since
the patient had recently undergone wedge resection of the
right lower lobe, she was not a candidate for systemic
thrombolytic therapy.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for further management.

At [**Hospital6 256**], review of chest CT
disclosed segmental bilateral pulmonary emboli.  Doppler
ultrasound of the lower extremities did not disclose evidence
of deep venous thrombosis.  The patient was admitted to the
MICU for further management.

IMPRESSION:  79-year-old female with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease and non-metastatic
squamous cell lung carcinoma, status post resection, who
presents with shortness of breath, desaturation and
hypotension.  She was found to have bilateral pulmonary
emboli on CT angiogram.  The patient was transferred from
[**Hospital3 **] for further management.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Pulmonary:  The patient was admitted to the MICU for
management.  The patient was maintained on 2 liters of oxygen
by nasal cannula.  CT angiogram from [**Hospital3 **] was
reviewed by radiology.  Review confirmed bilateral pulmonary
emboli but no saddle emboli.  The patient was placed on
Heparin.  The patient underwent lower extremity Doppler
ultrasounds which were negative.  The cause of the pulmonary
emboli was thought to be multifactorial and due to
malignancy, a history of smoking, immobility and the presence
of a recent internal jugular central line.  Inferior vena
cava filter was considered, but, since there were no clots by
lower extremity ultrasound, it was decided that the patient
would not benefit from this procedure.  The patient was also
administered her inhalers and Atrovent and Albuterol
nebulizer treatments.  During her hospital stay, she began to
feel less short of breath.  She was transferred out of the
MICU on [**2129-3-12**] to the medical floor. Her oxygen saturation
was stable on [**2-15**] liters of oxygen by nasal cannula.  It was
decided that the patient would be initiated on Lovenox for
treatment of her pulmonary emboli.

2.  Cardiovascular:  On admission, the patient was
hypotensive and required fluid boluses to maintain her
systolic blood pressure over 80.  An arterial line was
placed, and it was noted that her systolic pressure was
significantly greater with the arterial line [**Location (un) 1131**] than
with the non-invasive pressure.  The patient's blood pressure
should be checked in the right arm.  On EKG, the patient has
evidence of an old infarction.  The patient's cardiac enzymes
were cycled and found to be negative.  She was administered
aspirin and beta blockers.

Regarding the patient's rhythm, she was noted to be
tachycardiac.  Rhythm seemed consistent with multifocal
atrial tachycardia.  The patient's rate has been controlled
with beta blockers.  The patient is also on Digoxin 0.25 mg q
day.

3.  Infectious Disease:  The patient has a history of MRSA in
her sputum.  The patient remained afebrile during her
hospital stay.

4.  Oncology:  As noted above, the patient is status post
wedge resection of the right lower lobe for non-small cell
lung cancer.  The patient also underwent mediastinoscopy
which was negative for metastatic disease to the lymph nodes
of the mediastinum.

5.  Hematology:  On [**2129-3-13**], the patient was noted to have a
hematocrit of 24.8.  The patient was administered two units
of packed red blood cells.  DIC panel and Hemophilus workup
were negative.

The patient was anticoagulated with Heparin and Coumadin
during her hospital stay.  Due to difficulty maintaining the
patient's INR, she will be anticoagulated with Lovenox.

6.  Neurology/Psychiatry:  The patient was noted to have
periods of delirium during her hospital stay.  She was
managed with Risperidone q h.s.

7.  Physical Therapy:  The patient underwent evaluation by
Physical Therapy.  The patient will continue to require
physical therapy upon discharge.

8.  Nutrition:  The patient was seen by the Nutrition
Service.  The patient has refused supplements but is willing
to try other supplemental forms of nutrition.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Fair.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The long term plan is for the patient to
live in an [**Hospital3 **] facility in [**State 108**].  The patient
w
