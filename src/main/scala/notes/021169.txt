INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion
abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. No LV mass/thrombus.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTIC VALVE: ?# aortic valve leaflets. Severely
thickened/deformed aortic
valve leaflets. Severe AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular
calcification. Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae. Mild
(1+) MR. LV
inflow pattern c/w impaired relaxation.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild
[1+] TR.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Suboptimal
image quality - body habitus.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. There is an echodensity within the
posterior [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) **] that likely represents the ridge betweeen the left atrial
appendage and
the [**Doctor Last Name **] pulmonary vein (warfarin ridge). Left ventricular wall
thickness,
cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right
ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The number of aortic valve
leaflets
cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow
pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severe aortic stenosis. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension. Normal
LVEF.

CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE PORT  [**2161-3-23**] 3:15 PM

CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE PORT

Reason: syncope

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
62 year old woman with AS, syncope, preop
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
syncope
CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE.

REASON: Aortic stenosis.

FINDINGS: Duplex evaluation was performed of both carotid
arteries. Minimal plaque was identified.

On the right, peak systolic velocities are 51, 64, 37 in the
ICA, CCA, ECA respectively. The ICA to CCA ratio is 0.8. This is
consistent with no stenosis.

On the left, peak systolic velocities are 60, 75, 51 in the ICA,
CCA, ECA respectively. The ICA to CCA ratio is 0.8. This is
consistent with no stenosis.

There is antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of stenosis in either carotid artery.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2161-3-22**] 7:31 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: r/o effusion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
62 year old woman with AS
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o effusion
CHEST ONE VIEW PORTABLE.

INDICATION: 62-year-old woman with AS.

COMMENTS: Portable erect AP radiograph of the chest is reviewed.
No previous study is available for comparison.

There is mild congestive heart failure with cardiomegaly. There
is marked tortuosity of the thoracic aorta, which is consistent
with patient's history of aortic stenosis. No evidence of
pneumothorax is identified.

IMPRESSION: Mild congestive heart failure.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 106519**] was admitted after presentation to OSH ED for
syncopal episodes associated with a loss of consciousness and
CHF.  She was admitted for diuresis and cardiac monitoring.
Cardiology was consulted for management of CHF in the setting of
Aortic stenosis.  She was empirically placed on levaquin for
possible pneumonia.  Blood Cultures were negative after 72hours.
 She was gently diuresed toward her baseline weight.  Urine
culture showed a E. Coli UTI, sensitivities pending.  On
hospital day 4 Mrs. [**Known lastname 106519**] was 1.5kg below her baseline
weight, able to walk up two flights of stairs without distress,
denying any chest discomfort or shortness of breath at rest.
She has dental follow up scheduled with her dentist as an
outpatient for fillin
