Service:  TRANSPLANT SURGERY
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a previously healthy
24 year-old male who moved to the United States from [**Country 11150**]
five months prior.  He presented to the [**Hospital1 190**] with history of two weeks of illness with
jaundice and drowsiness that is progressively getting worse.
use.  No significant family history of liver disease.  The
patient was found to have significantly elevated LFTs.  He
was emergently evaluated for a liver transplantation and was
found to be a suitable candidate.  He was admitted to [**Hospital1 1444**] for further evaluation and
management.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Patient is drowsy and very hard to
arouse.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Included ALT 727, AST 377,
alkaline phosphatase 108, amylase 84, total bilirubin 41.9.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Due to patient's increased neurological
distress, he was emergently transferred to the Intensive Care
Unit, paralyzed and intubated.  On surveillance chest x-ray
after intubation, he was found to have a right pneumothorax
and the chest tube was placed.  He had an ultrasound which
showed a small liver surrounded by hyperechoic fibrous fatty
tissue, suggestive of perihepatitis, patent portal and
hepatic venous system, minimal ascites, splenomegaly. A
catheter was placed for fluid management.  Patient was
transfused two units for falling hematocrit.

On hospital day #2 and 3, the patient remained afebrile.  He
is on prophylactic antibiotics.  His LFTs are slowly going
down.  He is still intubated and sedated.  Transfused with
packed red blood cells and FFPs p.r.n. for correction of
anemia and coagulopathy.  On [**2145-12-2**], a liver became
available.  The patient was taken to an operating room where
involving cadaveric liver transplant, Roux-en-Y
hepaticojejunostomy was performed.  The operation when
without complications.  Please see operation note for
details. The patient was transferred to the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.

On postoperative day #1, the patient is on Zosyn,
Vancomycin, Bactrim and Acyclovir for antibacterial and
antiviral prophylaxis.  He was started on CellCept,
Cyclosporin, Simulect IV for immunosuppression.  Patient is
afebrile requiring Nitric Oxide for IPA pressure.

He had an ultrasound of his liver performed which showed
normal flow characteristics in the lower vessels without
evidence of focal abnormalities.  He was transfused with
platelets, FFPs and RBCs for coagulopathy and anemia p.r.n.
He was started on TPN.  He is also on SVHD.

On postoperative day #2, the patient spiked a fever up to
101.5 F.  His Propofol started to get withdrawn.  He remains
unresponsive, intubated and ventilated.  His SVH was stopped.
Continued on antibiotic prophylaxis.  He had a repeat
ultrasound which was read as no flow through hepatic artery.
The patient had a CTA which showed normal flow and
perihepatic changes consistent with postoperative changes.
His ICP drain was removed.

On postoperative day #3, the patient remains afebrile up to
103.3 F.  He was pan cultured with source still unknown.
Continued on antibiotic prophylaxis.  Off sedation, but still
unresponsive. His PA pressures are improving, but still
require Nitric Oxide.

On postoperative day #4, the patient is still febrile weaning
off NO2.  Opening eyes, but not following command.  His blood
cultures grew gram negative rods.  Neurology was consulted.

He had duel cholangiogram done on postoperative day #6 which
showed no strictures and normal ducts.  He had a fluoro
guided NG tube placement for tube feeds.  On postoperative
day #7, the patient continued to be febrile.  Started on tube
feeds.  Continued on antibiotic prophylaxis including
Imipramine for fevers.  His Nitric Oxide was discontinued.
He is slowing becoming alert and starting to follow commands.
One of his JPs was removed.

He had a CT Scan of his head which showed two small foci of
hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe immediately adjacent to
calvarial defect.  CT Scan of his abdomen showed small left
lower lobe consolidation.  On postoperative day #8, the
fevers are going down.  He had a MRI of the head done which
showed recent left insula cortical infarction, normal flow
through a circle of [**Location (un) 431**] in the major branches.

On postoperative day #9, the patient is afebrile. Vital signs
stable.  LFTs are slowly improving.  There was a question new
right middle lobe infiltrate on chest x-ray.  On hospital
stay #11, the patient had repeat MRI of the head which was
unchanged.  He had a swallow study performed which is normal.
Patient is responsive, moving all extremities and following
commands.  He is starting to move with help.  He had a liver
biopsy performed that showed evidence of preservation injury,
otherwise normal.  The patient continued on tube feeds,
through post-pyloric Dobbhoff tube.  He is also starting to
take regular food.  His medication was switched to p.o.  He
was transferred to the floor on postoperative day #14 in
stable condition.

On postoperative day #15, the patient had an increase in
LFTs.  He had an ultrasound performed which showed no hepatic
artery flow.  He had an emergency CTA performed which showed
normal flow through hepatic artery, however there was a
stricture of common hepatic.  Neurology Service was
reconsulted and patient was started on aspirin.

The patient has remained afebrile.  His LFTs are going down.
Vital signs are stable.  He is on oral medications.  Calorie
count was performed and showed that the patient is taking one
half of his required calories p.o. and he was switched on
nighttime tube feeds.  The patient has trouble feeding
himself and OT was consulted who found the patient has a lot
of trouble with fine motor movements.  [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted
and was managing the patient's blood sugars.  He also had
hypertension.  He was started on Norvasc which brought his
blood pressure under control.

On postoperative day #17, the patient was found to have good
p.o. intake.  His tube feeds were stopped and Dobbhoff was
removed without complication.  He is still whispering while
talking so Speech and ENT consults were obtained which both
indicated the patient has edematous erythematous vocal cords
consistent with intubation injury.  Suggested that the
patient will be based on humidified air with voice rest.
Patient is afebrile.  Vital signs stable.  Continue to work
with Respiratory and OT.  Improving good caloric intake.  The
patient is feeding himself.  Continued immunosuppression with
new oral modified daily by levels.  Blood sugar controlled
and improved.  Blood pressure improved.

On postoperative day #5, the patient is afebrile.  Vital
signs stable.  Taking good p.o.  He is ambulating without
assistance.  Can feed and dress himself.  His voice is
improving.  His LFTs are stable.  His wound is clean, dry and
intact.  His G tube is in place.  He will undergo G tube
cholangiogram today.  Patient has significantly improved.
