Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
Flash pulmonary edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation and extubation


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 6330**] is a 65yo F with history of AF (not on coumadin),
diastolic CHF, HTN, Pulm HTN, COPD on 2L NC, interstitial lung
dz, HL and DM who presented to [**Location (un) 620**] with confusion and AMS
and found to have opiate overdose with otherwise negative tox
screen.  She was treated with Narcan drip and charcoal infusion.
 Patient also had hyponatremia, ?rhabdo and [**Last Name (un) **].  Her labs were
also remarkable for elevated uric acid, anemia to 26 with signs
of anemia of chronic disease, mildly elevated AP and AST with
normal ALT and bili.  Her lasix was held and she was fluid
resuscitated for rhabdo over two days.
.
On [**2184-8-16**], pt was given echo, which showed EF > 55%, mild LA/RA
dilation,  normal LV size and systolic fxn and borderline pulm
HTN.
Overnight, she went into RVR also systolic BP of 200 and
developed flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation and cardiac
enzymes were checked with initial values of CK 790, MB 3, trop T
.21 to 410, 2.3, 0.21. BNP on presentation was 4,000, repeat was
12,000.  Started on dilt drip, given lasix 80IV and She was
transferred to the CCU here for further care.  A repeat echo
showed mild LV systolic dysfunction and mid andterioseptal wall
motion hypokinesis.  EKG was unchanged.  Most recent ABG
7.43/47/96/31 on AC FiO2 50%, 450x14 with reportedly zero of
PEEP and PSV.  On admission, she on 50%/500/14/5.  Of note, pt
was started on vanc zosyn at osh for concern for aspiration PNA.

.
Unable to obtain ROS due to intubation.

OSH imaging:
- p-MIBI [**12-7**]:
There is some mild decrease in activity in the anterior wall of
the
left ventricle which is probably related to soft tissue
attenuation.
It does not proceed into the apex and no abnormality is seen of
the
septum.  Wall motion of the left ventricle appeared entirely
normal.
The computer calculated left ventricular ejection fraction was
66
percent and the computer calculated left ventricular end
diastolic volume was 116 ml.
ECG: afib with rate 125, no sttw changes, low voltage.
.
- ECHO [**2184-8-16**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. There is borderline pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**8-18**]
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with hypokinesis/near-dyskinesis of the mid septum. Due to
suboptimal technical quality/limited views, additional focal
wall motion abnormalitiescannot be fully excluded. There is
considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular
ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Focused study. Mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction as described above. No clinically
significant valvular regurgitation or stenosis appreciated.
Normal pulmonary artery systolic pressure.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2184-8-16**],
the left ventricular regional wall motion abnormalities and mild
left ventricular systolic dysfunction are new. Given the limited
nature of the current study, a comparison of all previously
measure parameters could not be made.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2183-11-17**],
there is no significant change

IMPRESSION: Biatrial enlargement. Normal left and right
ventricular function. Normal valvular function.
.
[**Hospital1 18**]
CXR [**2184-8-18**]
The ET tube tip is 6.5 cm above the carina. The right internal
jugular line
tip is at the level of mid-to-low SVC. The NG tube tip is in the
stomach.

Cardiomegaly is unchanged. The patient was in moderate-to-severe
pulmonary
edema represented by bilateral perihilar opacities, and
bilateral pleural
effusions. Followup after diuresis is required.

Findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] over the phone by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
approximately at 5 p.m. on [**2184-8-18**].

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 6330**] is a 65yo F with history of AF, diastolic CHF, HTN, HL
and DM who presented to [**Location (un) 620**] with confusion and AMS and found
to have opiate overdose complicated by flash pulmonary edema
requiring intubation with elevated cardiac enzymes.
.
# Transient cardiac Ischemia:  Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
because of elevated CE.  She did not have any evidence of EKG
changes from
