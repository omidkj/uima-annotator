Service:  General Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 55-year-old
woman with chronic neuronal dysplasia, which is an adult form
of Hirschsprung's disease, as well as anxiety disorder and
benzodiazepine dependence, depression, irritable bowel
syndrome, and sarcoidosis.  She presented on [**2185-7-13**] for an
elective rectal dilatation and partial colectomy by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 957**].  The patient on [**2185-7-13**] underwent a preoperative
work-up including chest x-ray, EKG, various blood tests,
placement of a peripherally inserted central catheter, and a
bowel preparation involving p.o. erythromycin and neomycin.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Long history of colorectal procedures
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**].  The patient's initial surgery was a total
abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in
[**2149**].  Since then she has undergone numerous exploratory
laparotomies with lysis of adhesions for obstructive
symptoms.  She has also undergone repair of a spigelian
hernia, pelvic floor reconstruction and a two-part segmental
colectomy.

On [**2185-7-13**] the patient complained of continual abdominal
pain associated with nausea and a significant amount of
weight loss.  She described alternating episodes of diarrhea
and constipation, but denied any chest pain, shortness of
breath, or any other constitutional symptoms.

Her prior surgical history was as above, total abdominal
hysterectomy, total abdominal hysterectomy/bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy, colon resection, pelvic floor
reconstruction, spigelian hernia repair, and five exploratory
laparotomies with lysis of adhesions.

ALLERGIES:  She describes allergies to Zofran, Celexa,
Ultram, Benadryl, morphine, Augmentin, and intravenous
pyelogram dye.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  1. Kondremul.  2. Darvocet.  3.
Phenergan.  4. Lasix.  5. Valium.  6. Elavil.  7. Vicodin.
8. Anusol.  9. Ambien.  10. K-Lyte.  11. Levsin for nausea.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives in [**Location 4121**] with her husband and
three daughters.  She described no toxic habits, although she
does have a history of cigarette and ethanol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile, pulse 72,
respiratory rate 18, blood pressure 118/60.  Her physical
examination was benign.  Abdomen was soft, nontender,
nondistended, with multiple surgical scars that were well
healed.

LABORATORY DATA:  Her admission laboratory studies included
white blood cell count of 3.1, hematocrit 36, platelet count
236.  Chem-10 showed a sodium of 138, potassium 3.3, chloride
103, bicarbonate 26, BUN 16, creatinine 0.9, glucose 94,
calcium 9.2, phosphate 3.7 and magnesium 2.2.

Her chest x-ray showed emphysematous changes, osteopenia, no
opacifications or effusions.

EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 78 with left atrial
enlargement, no ischemic changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was typed and crossed for two
units in the blood bank.  Her consent for the procedure was
obtained and she was given a bowel preparation overnight.

On the morning of [**2185-7-14**] the patient went to the operating
room and once cleared by the anesthesia resident she was
taken to the operating room for her procedure.  Please refer
to Dr.[**Name (NI) 6275**] previously dictated operative summary for
details.  In short, the patient underwent an exploratory
laparotomy with lysis of adhesions, a rectal sphincter
dilatation, a low anterior resection with ileoproctectomy and
proctostomy, gastrostomy, tube placement and feeding
jejunostomy tube placement.  During the procedure the
peripherally inserted central catheter was taken out and
replaced with a central venous catheter.

The patient's postoperative course was significant mostly for
pain management issues.  The pain was initially treated with
a Demerol epidural with bupivacaine instilled into it, but
this did not completely control her pain.  A Dilaudid PCA
apparatus was added on to control her pain.  Between these
two the patient described better relief.  When the PCA was
added the Demerol was removed from the epidural and the
patient just received a bupivacaine epidural.  In addition to
this, Toradol was added, 10 mg q. 6 hours p.r.n. for better
pain control.  On this regimen the patient's pain control was
relatively well controlled.

Another postoperative problem with the patient's course was
low urine output in the first few days after surgery.  The
patient had low urine output and low blood pressures
requiring transfer to the intensive care unit.  The patient
went to the intensive care unit on [**2185-7-16**] and was monitored
for hypotension via her central venous catheter.  In addition
her urine output was kept up by fluid boluses and Lasix
doses.  During this time the patient also received a blood
transfusion for chronic blood loss anemia.  The patient was
in the surgical intensive care unit for two days and came
back out onto the floor on [**2185-7-13**].  By the time she came
out to the floor the patient was tolerating p.o.  She was
advanced to small amounts of clear liquids and cycled tube
feeds at 30 cc an hour.

On [**2185-7-18**] the patient was noted to have decreased breath
sounds bilaterally as well as low oxygen saturations.  She
underwent a chest x-ray that revealed signs of aspiration
pneumonia and effusions and atelectasis.  The patient was
started on levofloxacin and IV gentamicin with good results.
The patient soon defervesced and became less tachypneic as
well as had better oxygen saturations.  She was also treated
with chest physical therapy every four hours as well as
albuterol and Atrovent nebulizer treatment.

Over the next few days the patient improved and was slowly
advanced to a soft solid diet and p.o. pain regimen as well
as her home medications.  She continued to complain of nausea
following the tube feeds, as well as whenever the gastrostomy
tube was clamped, however for the most part she is now able
to tolerate the gastrostomy tube being clamped.

One [**Last Name **] problem following her surgery was a little bit of
fluid overload status.  She had some edema in the legs as
well as some congestive heart failure.  She has been getting
almost a daily dose of Lasix 5 mg to help diurese her with
good results.  She has much decreased edema in both of her
legs and her lungs today sound much clearer.

Today, on [**2187-7-26**], the patient is being discharged to a
[**Hospital 3058**] rehabilitation center skilled nursing facility for
the next week.  At the end of this week the patient is
scheduled to go for a follow-up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**]
on Monday, [**2185-8-1**], during which Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**] will remove her
gastrostomy and jejunostomy feeding tubes.
