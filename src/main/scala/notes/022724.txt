History of Present Illness:
56 yo female with ESRD s/p renal [**Month/Year (2) **] in [**2108**] who
presented with shortness of breath and tachypnea for about 2
weeks, accompanied by subjective fevers and chills, decreased
appetite, productive cough with hemoptysis. Has lost 20#

Social History:
Married with 5 children. Lives at home with husband, daughter
and grandchildren.  She moved from [**Country 5737**] in [**2098**] and last
visited in [**Month (only) **].  She denies any cigarette use, and quit
alcohol, though she used to abuse alcohol. No IVDU. While in
[**Country **], she lived on a farm for 3 years-- exposure to many
domestic farm animals. She does not recall any skin rashes or
febrile illnesses during that period. She does not know if she
received the BCG vaccine as a child.


Family History:

were killed in [**Country **]. Mother had stroke. Sister alive and
well.

Pertinent Results:
Renal US [**11-25**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No neighboring fluid collections.
2. Segmental arterial resistive indices ranging from 0.73 to
0.85.
Previously, this ranged from 0.72 to 0.76. Diastolic arterial
flow is redemonstrated.
3. Better defined, echogenic bands at the base of the pyramids
may reflect small calcifications.

TTE [**11-10**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
infero-lateral hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-4-6**],
infero-lateral hypokinesis is now appreciated. The degree of MR
has slihgtly increased.

TTE [**2114-11-17**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a very small
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-11-10**],
left ventricular systolic function is improved (previously low
normal), the severity of mitral regurgitation is reduced
(previously mild) and the heart rate is now higher.

LUE ultrasound [**11-11**]:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the left upper extremity.

Renal Echo: [**11-9**]
IMPRESSION: Persistent mild-moderate hydronephrosis of the
transplanted
kidney. Minimal increase in the resistive indices throughout the
transplanted kidney.

CT Chest: [**11-8**]
1. Multifocal ground glass opacities and airspace consolidation.
The
differential diagnosis includes multifocal pneumonia, most
likely pyogenic
though atypical organisms are also in the differential given a
history of
immunosuppression.
2. Central adenopathy, likely reactive.

EKG [**11-9**] Sinus rhythm. Diffuse non-specific inferior and
anterolateral ST segment changes. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2114-4-4**] the findings are similar.
