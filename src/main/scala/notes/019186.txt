Admission Date:  [**2144-7-22**]       Discharge Date:  [**2144-7-26**]

Date of Birth:   [**2073-6-17**]       Sex:  F

Service:  VASCULAR SURGERY

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71-year-old
female with a history of peripheral vascular disease and
COPD, who the day prior to admission had gone for an
angiography at the [**Hospital **] Hospital.  Postprocedure, she had
felt lightheaded and dizzy and was kept overnight and
discharged on the morning of admission.  She was sent home
after a workup which included a CT which was done to rule out
a hematoma which was reportedly negative.  When she arrived
home, she continued to complain of lightheadedness, left
groin pain, and once these symptoms failed to resolve, the
family felt that it was necessary to have her brought here
for evaluation.

She was brought to the Emergency Room and upon entering the
triage area, she promptly had a hypotensive episode where the
systolic blood pressure went down to the 50s.  She was
immediately brought to the Resuscitation Bay and was
resuscitated aggressively.  Her blood pressure was recovered.
She never lost a pulse or rhythm during this time.  An
emergent CT was done and demonstrated a large anterior wall
hematoma.  She was then evaluated by the Vascular Surgery
Service and admitted.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  COPD.
2.  Peripheral vascular disease.
3.  DVT.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Vioxx.
2.  Aspirin.
3.  Albuterol.
4.  Atrovent.
5.  Prilosec.
6.  Pletal which is being held.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denied any ETOH use.  She does
have a history of tobacco use, two packs per day for 50
years.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
98.1, heart rate 93, blood pressure 130/74, respirations 20,
98% on 2 liters nasal cannula.  General:  She was awake and
alert.  She was tachycardiac but a regular rhythm.  Chest:
Clear.  Abdomen: Soft, tender along the left flank and
anterior abdominal wall.  The left groin had a hematoma but
was nonpulsatile and she had distal Doppler signals of both
lower extremities.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  Her hematocrit on initial
admission was 27.8.  BUN and creatinine 14 and 0.8.  INR was
1.0.

EKG on admission included sinus tachycardia with no evidence
of ischemia.

CT of the abdomen revealed enlarged left pelvic hematoma
extending from the right posterior rectus sheath up to the
left parapsoas region.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transfused with 4 units of
packed red blood cells and 4 units of FFP.  She was
transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit with large
bore central access and serial hematocrits.  She remained
hemodynamically stable after her initial hypotensive episode.
She demonstrated no end-organ injury with maintaining good
respiratory status, renal status, and liver functions.  She
never developed any coagulopathy.

On hospital day number two, the patient was moved to the
Vascular Intensive Care Unit and remained in stable
condition.  Her hematocrit remained stable at 34.  She
received no other blood products.

On hospital day number three, her diet was advanced which she
tolerated.  She was allowed to get out of bed and ambulate
without difficulty.  The hematoma had decreased in size
considerably and was much softer.  She is currently stable
for discharge with follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Hypovolemic shock.
2.  Anterior abdominal wall hematoma, status post
angiography.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
5.  Peripheral vascular disease.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Vioxx.
2.  Aspirin.
3.  Albuterol.
4.  Atrovent.
5.  Prilosec.
6.  Pletal which is being held.
7.  Percocet 5/325 one to two p.o. q. four hours p.r.n.
8.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.

FOLLOW-UP: The patient will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
one to two weeks, will call for an appointment.  This is
mainly to just evaluate her hematoma and also discuss the
findings of her lower extremity angiogram, and possible
surgical intervention.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.
