Service:  CSU


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81-year-old female
patient, with hospitalization earlier this year for
congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema and palpitations.
She has also had several hospitalizations in the past 4-5
years for congestive heart failure.  The patient has been
followed by echocardiograms for her mitral regurgitation, and
most recent echo from [**Month (only) **] of this year revealed 4 plus
mitral regurgitation with mitral annular calcification, as
well as a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55 percent.
The patient subsequently underwent cardiac catheterization
which revealed two-vessel coronary artery disease, a left
ventricular ejection fraction of 65 percent, and severe
pulmonary hypertension.  The patient was referred for mitral
valve replacement and coronary artery bypass graft, as well
as a Maze procedure for atrial fibrillation.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg po once daily.
2. Levoxyl 0.05 mg po once daily.
3. Metoprolol 50 mg po bid.
4. Lasix 80 mg once daily.
5. Potassium chloride 10 mEq po once daily.
6. Verapamil 120 mg po once daily.
7. Lipitor 40 mg po once daily.
8. Pepcid 10 mg po once daily.
9. Calcium supplements.
10.Zestril 5 mg po once daily.

ALLERGIES:  Keflex which causes nausea and vomiting.  She is
also allergic to shellfish.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient does not smoke and has rare
alcohol intake.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital on
[**2120-10-29**], where she was taken directly to the
operating room by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], where she underwent
a coronary artery bypass graft x 2 with a LIMA to the LAD and
a saphenous vein to the OM.  She also had a mitral valve
repair with a 28 mm [**Doctor Last Name 405**] ring, as well as a Maze
procedure.  Postoperatively, she was on epinephrine, propofol
and Neo-Synephrine drips, and was transported from the
operating room to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit in good
condition.  The patient was extubated on the night of surgery
and remained on epinephrine, Neo-Synephrine drips through the
course of that night.  She also had a metabolic acidosis
which was treated with sodium bicarbonate.

On postoperative day 1, she remained hemodynamically stable
and weaned off of her epinephrine and propofol drips.  On
postoperative day 2 had begun with diuresis, still remained
somewhat hypotensive on IV Neo-Synephrine drip.  Her
pulmonary artery catheter was discontinued, as were her
epicardial wires and chest tubes.  Her Neo-Synephrine was
ultimately weaned off on postoperative day 3, after which she
was transferred from the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit to the
postoperative telemetry floor.  The patient was started on
Coumadin on postoperative day 3 for her history of atrial
fibrillation, status post Maze procedure.  She had remained
ventricularly paced at that time.  She had progressed well
from a hemodynamic and respiratory standpoint, although was
slow to progress with physical mobility and ambulation.

The patient had remained in normal sinus rhythm, or being
paced by her permanent pacemaker,  tracking her native atrial
rate, until [**11-5**] when she was noted to be in atrial
fibrillation early in the morning with a rate between 100 and
120.  Her blood pressure remained stable throughout this
time, and her Lopressor was increased, as was her amiodarone.
She continued to progress slowly from a physical therapy and
rehabilitation standpoint, although remained in atrial
fibrillation, was anticoagulated for it, and her rate was
controlled.  She has had intermittent atrial fibrillation
this morning with ventricular response rate in the 80s-90s.
She was going to be discharged today to rehabilitation
facility with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts event monitor for her
amiodarone loading, and she was also going to remain on
Coumadin for her atrial fibrillation.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Neurologically, she was alert and
oriented.  Her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Her cardiac exam was regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen was
soft, nontender, nondistended.  Her Steri-Strips to her
sternal incision were clean, dry and intact, as was her right
lower extremity incision.  She had some edema of her right
lower extremity and some peripheral edema remained
bilaterally only when her legs are in a dependent position,
but she was continuing to be diuresed.  The patient was
scheduled to have a chest x-ray prior to discharge today, and
the results of that were still pending.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin enteric-coated 81 mg po once daily.
2. Potassium chloride 20 mEq po bid.
3. Protonix 40 mg po once daily.
4. Lipitor 40 mg po once daily.
5. Levothyroxine 50 mcg po once daily.
6. Lasix 40 mg po bid.
7. Percocet 5/325, 1-2 tablets po q 4-6 h prn pain.
8. Continue amiodarone 400 mg po tid for 1 week and then
   decrease it to 400 mg [**Hospital1 **] for 1 week, then 400 mg once
   daily for 1 week, then 200 mg once daily, or until
   discontinued by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7047**].
9. Lopressor 25 mg po bid.
10.Senna 1 tablet po bid.
11.Coumadin 1 mg po today, on [**11-6**], and tomorrow, on
[**11-7**].  She is then to have an INR checked in rehab on
[**11-8**], and her Coumadin dose should be adjusted
accordingly for a target INR of 2.0-2.5.  The patient's INR
yesterday, [**11-5**], was 2.1, and she received 2 mg, and
today her INR was 2.5, and she will receive 1 mg today.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient is to follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], cardiac surgery, for postoperative check in 4 weeks.

She is also to follow-up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7047**] in [**3-12**] weeks.
Dr.[**Name (NI) 9654**] office will be dosing her Coumadin, as well.
Dr.[**Name (NI) 9654**] office telephone number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3183**].
