Chief Complaint:
cc: Dyspnea/Hypoxia/Hypotension


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
HPI:  This 53 year old female with a past history of CHF, DM,
recurrent PEs was transfered from NH after she was noted to be
hypoxic.  On 4L NC her O2 sats ranged from 88-92%.  She has
reported a persistent non-productive cough, at breakfast she
vomited a small amount of cereal but reported no nausea.  She
also had large loose stools.  Of note she is on Coumadin for a
history of PEs, she was found to have an INR on [**8-25**] of >10 so
5mg SC Vitamin K was given.
  Upon arrival here there were no medical records available.
She was able to respond to a few questions she denied CP, SOB,
said that her current breathing was her baseline.  Her vitals
upon arrival were Temp 98.5, HR 90, BP 80/palp, 87% on RA, 93%
on NRB.  Her BP continued to remain low and she was started on
peripheral dopa.  She was intubated secondary to her hypoxia.
Pulmonary emboli was high on the differential so they got a stat
Echo which showed right heart strain.  She was treated with tPA.
 She continued to have hard to control pressures, she was
treated with Levophed, Vasopressin, and Dopamine.  She was also
given 125 mg Hydrocortisone given her adrenal insufficiency.
  Records from [**Hospital1 756**] indicate that she was hospitalized there
in [**Month (only) 216**] for Pulmonary hypertension and CHF at that time CXR
and chest CT showed pulmonary edema, bilateral LENIs were
negative for DVTs.  There she was diuresed for presumed heart
failure, treated with Levofloxacin, Vancomycin and Gentamicin.
She had positive cultures for MRSA on [**7-17**] with no source found
for bacteremia.

EKG: sinus rhythm, nl axis, flipped Ts V1-V2, flattened T waves
throughout, very variable baseline, no old to compare, no ST
changes.
.
CXR: IMPRESSION:  Examination markedly limited by overlying soft
tissue.  However, probable left lower lobe opacity.  Mediastinal
shift to the left.
.
Echo: Technically difficult study, limited parasternal views
demonstrated preserved LV function, significant RA and RV
dilatation, bowing of interventricular septum consistent with
acute pulmonary hypertension and RV strain.


Brief Hospital Course:
This 53 year old female with history of CHF, DM, PEs in the past
and subtherapeutic INR presented with hypoxia and hypotension.
Echo and hypoxia consistent with pulmonary emboli, was lysed
with tPA in the ED.  Other possible causes of hypoxia included
pneumonia, CXR showed LLL opacity which is consistent with this,
or CHF, less likely given no evidence of this on CXR and normal
LV function on Echo, however could be diastolic.  She was
treated with Vanco, Flagyl, Levofloxacin for Pneumonia and
possible sepsis.  She was afebrile, however WBC elevated with
increased neutrophils, and LLL opacity on CXR.  She was treated
with fluid gently given concern for fluid overload.  She was
continued on nebulizers.  She was supported on the ventilator,
initially on PEEP of 10 and FIO2 of 100.  Her cardiac enzymes
were cycled, if her condition was due to an MI she was already
getting tPA.  A repeat CXR was sent which showed no evidence of
pneumothorax.  Upon arrival to the MICU her family was contact[**Name (NI) **]
and they stated that she was DNR/DNI and would not have wanted
to be on life support.  They came into the hospital and a
conversation was held with them and with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 57046**] at [**Hospital1 756**]
and it was come to the understanding that she would not have
wanted the aggressive care which she received.  It was decided
to withdraw pressure support.  This was done and she expired at
12:15AM on [**2152-8-28**].
.
Other issues on hospitalization:
1. Hypotension - most likely from PE vs. Sepsis from PNA.  She
was treated on Dopamine, Levophed, and Vasopressin.  These were
discontinued pending conversation with the family.  Stress
steroids were given history of Addison's and thus adrenal
insufficiency.  Propofol was avoided as this will drop pressures
and we avoided giving too much fluid given history of CHF.

2. DM - Patient had some hypergylcemia upon arrival to the MICU,
has a history of insulin dependant diabetes.  She was covered
with insulin drip.
.
3. Addison's disease - patient on steroids at home.  She was
covered with stress dose steroids here.
.
4. Thyroid insufficiency
- Continued synthroid
.
5. Renal insufficiency
- Continued Renagel
.
6. CHF
- Continued Spironolactone
.
7. GERD
- Continued Protonix
.
8. FEN
- IV fluid at maintenance
- repleted lytes prn
.
9. PPx
- Anticoagulate with heparin
- PPI
