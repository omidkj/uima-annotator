Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4616**]
Chief Complaint:
T4-5 Lesion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
T4-T5 corpectomy/cage, T3-6 lami,post instrumented fusion T2-T7,
iliac crest bone harvest


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 75M electively admitted on [**8-24**] for planned thoracic
fusion and resection of vertebral body lesion. Patient has stage
IV NSLC with brain and spinal mets underwent T4-T5
corpectomy/cage, T3-6 laminectomy, post instrumentation and
fusion T2-T7 on [**2124-8-24**]. Post procedure course was complicated
by AFRVR and transient hypotension. Patient was called out of
the SICU on [**2124-8-30**] to step down unit.
.
He continued to be in atrial fibrillation. He was treated
initially with Zosyn which was switched to cefepime per ID recs
for a hospital acquired pneumonia. The patient was then found to
be diaphoretic and unresponsive at 2 AM. His FS was found to 24.
He had received glyburide while NPO peri-procedure. His BP was
124/62, HR 85, T 92.7. He recieved [**2-18**] amp of Dextrose and his
BS increased to 175. Patient was also placed on a bear hugger.
His temp eventually recovered early morning and has been normal
since.

Patient currently denies chest pain, shortness of breath,
abdominal pain, N/V/D, dysuria, [**Month/Day (2) **], chills, nightsweats,
headache, focal weakness, numbness, change in vision or hearing.
His wife was present during the presentation and helped with
history as the patient was delerious. She states that patient
has had similar confusion symptoms during past hospitalization
which resolves with discharge and going back home.

Imaging:
CT T-Spine [**8-24**]:
FINDINGS: Again seen is a compression fracture of the T5
vertebral body.
Again seen is a small amount of retropulsed bone that encroaches
on the spinal canal and indents the spinal cord. The posterior
margin of the vertebral body is fractured, and this fracture
extends into the pedicles bilaterally. The facet joints appear
intact. There is a small vacuum phenomenon anteriorly in the
vertebral body, and tiny vacuum phenomenon in the T4-5 and T5-6
intervertebral discs. Images of the remaining vertebral bodies
included in this study demonstrate osteoporosis, but no evidence
of fracture.
CONCLUSION: T5 compression fracture with kyphotic angulation and
bone
retropulsed into the spinal canal compressing the spinal cord.

CT T-spine [**8-24**]:
FINDINGS: The patient is status post recent posterior fusion of
T2 to T7 with placement of posterior fusion construct and bony
fusion material, and
intervertebral cage placement at T4-T5, and extensive
post-surgical changes in the region. There is marked metallic
streak artifact, significantly limiting the evaluation of the
spinal canal. There is subcutaneous emphysema, post- surgical.
At T2 level, there is tiny hyperdense focus within the spinal
canal (2:[**12-28**]), which could relate to the streak artifact;
however, hemorrhage cannot be excluded. There are NG and ET
tubes in situ. Right lower lobe consolidation and effusion,
incompletely imaged, and underlying emphysema are similar in
overall appearance to the recent study.
IMPRESSION: Immediately status post posterior fusion, from the
T2 to T7
level, with T4-T5 partial corpectomy and intervertebral cage
placement, and significant streak artifact limiting evaluation
for epidural hemorrhage, with:
1. Focal hyperdensity in the right posterolateral aspect of the
spinal canal, at about the level of T2, likely relates to the
streak artifact; however, hemorrhage is difficult to exclude
entirely.
2. No residual retropulsed bony fragment in the spinal canal.
3. Other than expected surgical result, no acute change in
alignment.
4. The tips of the right-sided transpediculate screws, at the T3
and T6 levels transgress the anterior vertebral cortex.

LENIS [**8-29**]:
FINDINGS: Grayscale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] were performed
of the
bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal
veins. These
demonstrate normal flow, compressibility and augmentation.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.

CTA of Chest [**8-29**]:
CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There are no filling defects
within the
pulmonary arterial vasculature. There is evidence of prior right
lower lobe lobectomy including shift of the mediastinal
structures to the right with right lung volume loss and right
upper lobe expansion. There is less than expected enhancement of
the inferior right upper lobe concerning for
consolidation (3:74). A moderate right pleural effusion has
increased in size compared to the [**2124-7-25**] PET CT. Circumferential
thickening of the pleural surface, particularly at the right
lung base, likely reflects chronic pleural effusion. There is
evidence of advanced metastatic disease including an irregular
area of nodular pleural thickening seen at the right lung apex
posteriorly abutting lytic destruction of an adjacent thoracic
vertebral body status post posterior fixation (3:32). Multiple
abnormal lymph nodes evident within the lower posterior
mediastinum with the largest measuring 1.9 x 1.87 mm (3:100).
There are a few solid-appearing mediastinal lymph nodes,
however, none meet criteria for pathology by CT. Extensive
emphysematous changes, most evident in the hyperexpanded right
upper lobe and right middle lobe are evident. Multiple soft
tissue metastatic nodules within the left upper and lower lobes
have increased in size compared to the PET CT of [**2124-7-25**]
concerning for disease progression. For example, soft tissue
nodule abutting the major fissure measures 1.5 x 1.5 cm,
previously 1.1 x 1.1 cm (3:58). There is a small left pleural
effusion with associated atelectasis. The imaged portions of the
upper abdomen demonstrate prominence of both adrenal glands
better assessed by recent PET CT. Patient is status post
posterior fusion of multiple upper thoracic vertebral bodies and
introduction of inner body spacers. There is no CT evidence of
hardware loosening. No new lytic osseous metastases are present.

IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism.
2. Right upper lobe pneumonia, most evident at the right lung
base.
3. Worsening widespread thoracic metastatic disease compared to
the PET CT of [**2124-7-25**].
4. Chronic moderate right pleural effusion with smaller left
pleural
effusion, increased in size compared to the PET CT.

Surface Echo [**8-30**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Regi
