Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Partial Small Bowel Obstruction
Nausea, Vomiting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right Portacath Placement


History of Present Illness:
This is a 82 year old male with a h/o bladder cancer requiring 4
resections and recently diagnosed metastatic squamous cell
cancer involving the rectum. He also had a recently elevated INR
of 12.4.  He has fecal incontinence secondary to squamous cell
carcinoma  infiltrating the pelvis. He underwent a diverting
colostomy approximately 10 days ago. Following surgery, the
patient developed ileus and experienced continued nausea w/o
vomiting. He was discharged from the hospital 5 days ago. He has
done poorly at home and reports persistent nausea, anorexia, and
decreased stoma output. He had continued nausea and poor
appetite at home w/1 episode of vomiting triggered by brushing
his teeth.

He was admitted to the hospital for FTT, persistent ileus and
placement of a port for systemic sensitization chemotherapy/.

Bladder Cancer (Papillary urothelial carcinoma, diagnosed [**2139**])
- s/p several cycles of therapy with BCG, interferon,and most
recently on intravesicular mitomycin (last dose [**2144-4-30**]), and

rectum to the sigmoid colon and increased mediastinal nodes.

Radiology Report CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT Study Date of
[**2144-6-10**] 12:15 PM
FINDINGS: A pacemaker/AICD overlies the left lateral thoracic
chest wall with leads in unchanged position. A nasogastric tube
and right-sided port have been placed with the port tip in the
cavoatrial junction. There is no
pneumothorax. Borderline cardiomegaly persists. The pulmonary
vasculature is normal. Lateralization of the apex of the right
hemidiaphragm which may
suggest a small underlying subpulmonic effusion. There is no
focal
consolidation.

Radiology Report PORTABLE ABDOMEN Study Date of [**2144-6-10**] 12:16
PM
IMPRESSION: Findings concerning for early or partial small bowel
obstruction. Nasogastric tube likely extends into the duodenum.
.
Radiology Report CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2144-6-12**]
11:59 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Persistent dilatation of the small bowel, without a discrete
transition
point. Although early or partial obstruction is difficult to
exclude, the
appearance is more consistent with an ileus.
2. Anasarca.
3. Suspected peritoneal drop metastasis in the lower pelvis,
with overall
evaluation for metastatic disease highly limited by technique.
4. Asymmetric thickening along the pylorus, in the setting of
more diffuse
gastric wall thickening, which may be inflammatory in etiology.
Clinical
correlation suggested.
.
Radiology Report BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS Study Date of [**2144-6-16**]
3:04 PM
FINDINGS: Grayscale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) **] of bilateral
common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were
obtained. There is normal compression, flow, and augmentation.
Color flow in the superficial veins of bilateral calves is
demonstrated. A moderate amount of subcutaneous edema is seen
within bilateral lower extremities.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT of bilateral lower extremities.

CT abdomen/pelvis [**6-12**]:

INDICATION: 82-year-old man with end-colostomy for bladder
tumor, now with
nausea, vomiting and higher nasogastric tube output.

COMPARISONS: CT from [**2144-4-28**] and more recent radiograph from
[**2144-1-11**].

TECHNIQUE: Axial non-contrast CT images of the abdomen and
pelvis were
obtained with oral but not intravenous contrast, and sagittal
and coronal
reconstructions were also performed.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There are moderate
bilateral pleural
effusions, greater on the right than left, of low density with
associated
parenchymal opacities, most likely represent atelectasis. A
dual-lead
pacemaker device is noted along the most superior images. The
gallbladder is
full, but not markedly distended. A nasogastric tube terminates
immediately
beyond the pylorus, which shows asymmetric thickening up to 12
mm. The liver,
pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are within normal limits.
The kidneys
again appear atrophic.

There is a persistent moderate hydronephrosis of the left
kidney, slightly
increased, with mural thickening of the left ureter and again a
suspected
filling defect, as noted before. A similar 3- cm focal fusiform
aneurysm of
the mid infrarenal aorta is also present.

The patient is status post diverting colostomy. The stomach and
entire bowel
show mild-to-moderate wall thickening, and there is diffuse
stranding in the
mesentery and along the subcutaneous tissues of the flanks.
There is also
moderate ascites of low density, particularly adjacent to the
lateral aspect
of the spleen. There is no free air.

At the time of the scan, some of the enteric contrast had
entered the cecum.
The more distal bowel up to the colostomy site contains air and
stool, and is
not collapsed. However, the distal small bowel is again
moderately dilated to
a similar extent as on a plain film from two days ago.

The lack of intravenous contrast makes it difficult to evaluate
for metastatic
disease, but limiting evaluation, particularly in the setting of
diffuse
edema.
