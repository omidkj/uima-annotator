[**2202-4-7**] Cardiac Cath:
1.  Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated an elevated right
and left
heart filling pressures with an RVEDP of 18 mm Hg and an LVEDP
of 34 mm
Hg.  The cardiac index was low at 2.17 L/min/m2 via the Fick.
2.  Hemodynamics demonstrated a mean gradient of 17 mm Hg across
the
aortic valve.  The aortic valve area was 0.6 cm2.  Hemodynamics
demonstrated equalization of the left ventricle and femoral
diastolic
pressures indicating significant aortic regurgitation.  A
echocardiogram
obtained in the cath lab demonstrated moderate - severe (3+)
aortic
regurgitation.  Decision made not to perform the aortic
vavlvuloplasty.
[**2202-4-7**] Echocardiogram:
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
Significant aortic stenosis is present (not quantified). There
is probably moderate to severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen
(Pressure half time 200 ms, holodiastolic flow reversal in the
descending aorta). The aortic regurgitation jet is eccentric and
difficult ot assess visually. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-13**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
[**2202-4-13**] Carotid Ultrasound:
Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral carotid arteries.
There is no significant plaque seen bilaterally. The velocities
are 96, 74, and 56 cm/sec in the ICA, CCA, and ECA respectively.
This is consistent with no stenosis.
[**2202-4-14**] Intraop TEE:
Pre Bypass -
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with with focal septal hypokinesis as well as
overall global hypokinesis (EF 45%). The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There is
severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Severe (4+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild mitral regurgitation.
Post Bypass -
A well-seated bioprosthetic valve is seen in the aortic position
with normal leaflet motion and gradients (mean gradient = 5
mmHg, peak 11 mmHg). No aortic regurgitation is seen. There is a
mild perivalvular leak in between the right and left coronary
cusps. Overall left ventricular function is similar. No aortic
dissection is seen. All findings discussed with surgeons at the
time of the exam.
POSTOP LABS:



Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 2916**] was admitted under cardiology with congestive heart
failure. She ruled out for myocardial infarction. She was noted
to have acute renal insufficiency, likely prerenal etiology for
which the ACE inhibitor was discontinued. EP interrogation of
her pacemaker revealed normal function. She continued on
Amiodarone for atrial fibrillation. She experienced increasing
dyspnea and oxygen requirements which prompted transfer to the
CCU for initiation of Lasix drip and CPAP. Her oxygenation
gradually improved but she remained critical. Given that she was
a poor surgical candidate, it was decided to attempt aortic
valvuloplasty. Aortic valvuloplasty was aborted however
secondary to hemodynamic and echocardiographic evidence of
severe aortic insufficiency. Cardiac surgery was therefore
consulted for redo aortic valve replacment surgery. After
extensive discussion with the patient and her family, it was
decided to proceed high risk redo operation. Please see result
section preoperative workup. Of note, preop HIT assays were
negative for PF4 Heparin antibodies. On [**4-14**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
performed redo sternotomy, aortic valve replacement and coronary
artery bypass grafting surgery. For surgical details, please see
seperate dictated operative note. Following the operation, she
was brought to the CVICU for invasive monitoring. Initial
postoperative course was complicated by shock and coagulopathy.
She required significant pressor support and multiple blood
products. She also required re-exploration on postoperative day
zero. Due to a prolonged critical condition and failure to wean
from mechanical ventilation, tube feedings were initiated. She
concomitantly became oliguric despite fluid and volume
resuscitation. She was unresponsive to Natrecor and Lasix drip.
The renal service was consulted, and CVVH was eventually
initiated. Due to eventual mechanical problems with CVVH,
hemodialysis was temporarily required.
