RUQ US [**2-4**]:
1. Unchanged appearance of mildly distended gallbladder
containing layering sludge, without evidence of acute
cholecystitis.
2. No focal liver lesions or biliary ductal dilatation.
3. Right pleural effusion.
.
[**2-4**] CT Chest:
1. Interval decrease in right-sided pleural effusion. Left-
sided pleural effusion is unchanged.
2. Persistent multifocal pneumonia with interval worsening
consolidation in the lingula and left upper lobe.
3. Nonspecific soft tissue stranding in the left upper quadrant,
new from prior study but difficult to assess without oral
contrast. Consider CT of the abdomen for more complete
assessment, if warranted clinically.

Brief Hospital Course:
53-year-old male patient with h/o of hodgkins lymphoma in BMT
'[**64**],  h/o splenectomy, h/o pericarditis, hypothyroidism was
initially admitted for fever in setting +sick contacts. In ER,
confirmed Influenza B + (Rx with Tamiflu X7days). Pt initially
did well first night, but then had rapidly worsened hypoxia am
of [**2181-1-28**] with CT chest showing new multilobar consolidations.
Developed septic shock and ARDS, started broad Abx
(vanc/cefepime/azithromycin), transfered to MICU, was intubated
for hypoxemic resp failure [**1-28**].  Resp cultures grew MSSA and Abx
changed to nafcillin to complete 3week course per ID (until [**2-18**]
via R PICC). Was finally extubated [**2-7**] and transfered to Gen
Med on [**2-9**]. On Gen Med, continued with rapid improvement,
weaned off O2. There was some concern initially with persistant
leukocytosis in 20s with fevers and imaging with pleural
effusions that raised concern for parapneumonic efffuisons or
empyema. However, WBC did start to trend down so [**Female First Name (un) 576**] was
deferred. He will have ID f/u after Abx and needs repeat
imaging.  Still having low grade fevers and imaging with L>R
infiltrates but clinically much better. Other infectious w/u
negative.
Of note, during hospitalization, pt had some LFT elevation with
US/CT showing sludge but no evidence of cholecystitis and this
was likely [**1-29**] acute illness and possible TPN which he recieved
for few days (improving by time of discharge). Also developed
Anemia 12-->8 w/o gross evidence of bleeding or hemolysis, s/p
1U prbc [**2-9**] with hgb stable 9s thereafter. this can be followed
up as outpt.

See progress note below for details according to each problem:

53 year-old male with a history of hodgkin's s/p BMT in 93, s/p
splenectomy, h/o pericarditis, hypothyroidism, anemia, admitted
[**1-27**] with influenza B (received antiviral treatment in ICU)
complciated by severe MSSA bacterial
superinfection-->ARDS/intubation, extubated [**2-7**], t/f to floor
[**2-9**], doing very well, ambulating, tolerating PO, plan to d/c
home today
.
.
MSSA CAP, superinfection (Influenza B): ARDS, extubated [**2-7**].
Doing well, off oxygen. Some concern initially with persistant
leukocytosis/fevers and CT with persistant L>>R pleural
effusions concerning for parapneumonic effusions but white count
finally down. Pt has been afebrile (low grade temps)
- continue Nafcillin 2 gm IV q 4hr through [**2-18**] for total of 3
weeks per ID (confirmed plan)
-since downtrending wbc, can hold off on [**Female First Name (un) 576**], but needs repeat
imaging to ensure resolved effusions, f/u [**Hospital **] clinic in [**2181-3-6**]
- continue incentive spirometry
- guiafenisin prn, duonebs
-note, pt is post splenectomy, asked to confirm pneumovax and
meningitis vaccine, but none here while PNA
.
.
Leukocytosis: as above, 20s for several days, today down to 12,
as above, concern for parapneumonic effusions but holding [**Female First Name (un) 576**]
as above with repeat CXR in 1week.  Currently with low grade
temps, no fevers. As for other sources,  LIJ tip not sent, PICC
site looks good, no urinary complaints, no diarrhea.  note,
baseline elevated wbc partly due to post-splenectomy.
.
.
Anemia and thrombocytosis: baseline hgb 12s, here 9-->7s s/p 1U
prbc [**2-9**], now 9s. No obvious bleeding or hemolysis but was
acutely ill.
-Fe studies will be unreliable since got blood t/f, hold supp
since Fe load with transfusion
-will need to be followed as outpt
-as for thrombocytosis, likely reactive (anemia, illness) and
post-splenectomy
.
.
Hodgkins disease s/p BMT'[**64**], no issues
.
.
Hypothyroidism: cont levothyroxine 88mcg
.
.
GERD: protonix 40-->prilosec at home
.
.
Dyslipidemia; resume lipitor 10
.
.
Elevated Alk phos: RUQ [**2-4**] with sludge, no dilation, bili
normal, no RUQ pain
-slow trend down, monitor, follow as outpt
