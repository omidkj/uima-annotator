Brief Hospital Course:
Rabbi [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2160-7-7**] for surgical
management of his coronary artery disease. Heparin was started
as his INR was allowed to normalize. On [**2160-7-9**] Rabbi [**Known lastname **] was
taken to the operating room where he underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting to three vessels. Please see operative note for
details. Postoperatively he was taken to the SICU for
monitoring. On postoperative day one, he awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated. He was transfused with packed red
blood cells for postoperative anemia. The electrophysiology
service interrogated his pacemaker and programmed it to VVI at
80-100. Coumadin was resumed for his chronic atrial
fibrillation. On [**2160-7-12**], Rabbi [**Known lastname **] fell while in the
bathroom. Fortunately no injury was sustained. On postoperative
day three, Rabbi [**Known lastname **] was transferred to the step down unit
for further recovery. He was gently diuresed towards his
preoperative weight. The physical therapy service was consulted
for assistance with his postoperative strength and mobility.

Rabbi [**Known lastname **] continued to make steady progress and was
discharged to rehabilitation on postoperative day 6. He will
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**], his cardiologist and his primary
care physician as an outpatient. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will resume his
coumadin management as per preoperatively upon discharge from
rehabilitation. His Goal INR is 2.0-2.5 for atrial fibrillation.
