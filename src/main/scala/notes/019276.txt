Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

2) placement of midline

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 35 year old G3P1011 at 21w2d ega who initially developed
nausea and vomiting 2 days prior to admission.  She developed
acute-onset N/V and reports vomiting bilious fluid every 15
mintues.  She ws unable to keep down po fluid.  Pt presented to
an OSH and received antiemetics and fluids and was sent home.
On the day of admission the pt developed a fever and chills
along with right pleural pain.  The pt was seen at an OSH and
was found to have a collapsed right middle lobe by CT scan along
with infiltrate.  Pt wa also found to be hypotensive and was
subsequently given IVF (3L) at OSH w/ response.  Pt was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

When pt arrived she ws tachycardic and tachypneic.  She was kept
on 5L NC to keep O2 sat > 94% and she was given a dose of
ceftriaxone and azithromycin at the OSH.  Pt states that her
nausea has improved but states that she is very thirsty.  She
also states that one of her children recently had fever and URI
symptoms.  She has a non-prodouctive cough but denies hemoptysis
or hematemesis.

[**2183-11-18**] CXR:

1. Right subclavian venous access catheter with tip at the right
atrial/SVC junction. The catheter tip location was discussed
with the intern caring for the patient at the time of
interpretation (8:50 p.m.).

2. Right middle and lower lobe opacity and right pleural
effusion.

3. Rightward deviation of the trachea. This may represent
enlargement of the left lobe of the thyroid gland. Correlation
with any possible history of instrumentation in this region is
also recommended.

[**2183-11-20**]:  TAUS
Single live intrauterine gestation with size equals dates.
Evaluation of the left ventricular outflow tract is limited due
to position of the fetus.

[**2183-11-20**]:  Thyroid US
The right thyroid lobe measures 1.7 x 2.1 cm at the level of the
isthmus and no nodules are seen within it. The left lobe is
nearly entirely replaced by a solitary nodule measuring 3.8 x
3.6 x 3.4 cm. The nodule has a hypoechoic rim, however also
demonstrates increased color flow.

IMPRESSION: Dominant nodule in the left lobe as described above.
Ultrasound- guided FNA is recommended.


Brief Hospital Course:
1) Pneumonia:
Given concern for sepsis, the pt was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] upon
transfer from the OSH.  A central line into the R subclavian was
placed.  She was continued on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for
community pneumonia coverage and was kept on supplemental O2 to
keep her O2 sat > 94%.  Aggressive chest PT was performed and
albuterol nebulizers were administered to help open airways.
The pt's hypotension improved w/ aggressive IV hydration and she
did not require pressors.  On HD#3, the pt had stabilized and
was transferred to the floor to the antepartum service.

On the evening of HD#3, the pt spiked a fever to 101.4 F and the
infectious disease service was consulted to assess antibiotic
coverage.  Per ID recs, a repeat set of blood cultures were
drawn, a sputum gram stain and culture, legionella urine antigen
, and mycoplasma serologies were sent.  The legionella urinary
antigen was negative and gram stain of the sputum showed no
organisms.  Blood cultures from both [**2183-11-18**] and [**2183-11-20**] are
still pending at the time of this dictation but have
demonstrated no growth to date.  ID also recommended keeping the
pt on her current regimen of ceftriaxone and azithromycin.  The
pt subsequently defervesced.  Her central line was removed on
HD#4 without difficulty and a midline was placed for continuing
antibiotics.

On HD#6, the pt's O2 sat was 94-96% on room air.  However, her
maximum temperature within the past 24 hours was 100.6F.  Given
the pt's ongoing intermittent low-grade fevers as well as the
serious nature of her pneumonia, she was counseled regarding
staying in the hospital for another 1-2 days for further
monitoring by both Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] ([**Doctor Last Name 13675**]) and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (Infectious
Disease).  However, the pt refused and signed herself out
against medical advice.  VNA was set up for the pt for line care
and antibiotic administration.  Prescriptions for ceftriaxone
and azithromycin were given to the pt.  She was encouraged to
make a follow-up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**12-1**] weeks and
with her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 1 week.

2) Fetal well-being:  Given the previable gestational age, the
fetal heart tones were checked every day but no further
interventions were performed.  The pt had reassuring fetal heart
rate spot checks in the 140s-150s throughout her hospital
course.  She underwent a full fetal survey on [**2183-11-20**] that
demonstrated a single live intrauterine gestation with size
equals dates.  Evaluation of the left ventricular outflow tract
was limited due to position of the fetus.

3) Thyroid nodule:
On CT scan at the OSH, the pt was incidentally found to have a
thyroid nodule in the left lobe.  She underwent a thyroid
ultrasound at [**Hospital1 18**] which demonstrated that the left thyroid
lobe was nearly entirely replaced by a solitary nodule measuring
3.8 x 3.6 x 3.4 cm. The nodule has a hypoechoic rim, however
also demonstrates increased color flow.  Given this finding,
ultrasound-guided FNA was recommended.  TSH was checked and
found to be wnl at 1.2, free T4 was slightly low at 0.8.  The
endocrine service was informally consulted and recommended
outpatient follow-up in the thyroid nodule clinic in [**Month (only) 404**] for
FNA.  The pt was discussed w/ [**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name 9835**] (endocrine fellow)
who recommended scheduling a follow-up appointment for the pt
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 6468**]) with her upon discharge.
