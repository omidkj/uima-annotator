Benzodiazepine overdose

endotracheal intubation (intubated [**2186-2-8**], extubated [**2186-2-9**])


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 52 year-old woman with a history of
depression/anxiety who was brought to the ED after taking a
"handfull" of Xanax following an argument with her partner.
[**Name (NI) 65507**] to him, they were home at his apartment where she has
also been staying for the last few months. They had a few beers
before dinner, ate dinner around 5 pm, and were later preparing
to go to bed and watch [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] when they began to argue over
"something stupid." The partner suggested she just go back to
her own house (where she has not stayed in several weeks), at
which point she became upset. She told him she was taking
several pills (he thinks maybe [**5-10**] Xanax, though it may have
been more) though he did not actually see exactly what she took.
She then went to the kitchen and took a knife and began trying
to cut her wrists. He went to her and was able to wrestle the
knife away. He held her wrists and maneuvered her to the sofa;
after several minutes of holding her still, she began to
"weaken" and then became somnolent, at which time he called 911.
He states there was never any trauma or injury other than that
self-inflicted to her wrists.

She is followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4135**] (prescribing psychiatrist) and
therapist [**Doctor First Name **] at [**Hospital1 **] for mental health issues. As far as
her partner is aware, she has never been hospitalized for
psychiatric reasons or had a prior suicide attempt. She is seen
approximately monthly as an outpatient.

Partner is not aware of any recent physical complaints or
symptoms though does note that since her bypass surgery she is
only able to eat very small amounts at a time and occasionally
has stomach problems including cramping.

Vitals on arrival to the ED were not recorded on ED dash but per
verbal signout she had normal BP, HR and RR of [**9-13**]. She was
found to be obtunded and was intubated for airway protection.
She received a dose of Narcan after which she was mildly roused,
but then became somnolent again. She received activated charcoal
x 1 dose through OG tube. She received Td shot given wrist
injury, and lacerations to left wrist were sutured. She received
IVF (on 2nd L NS). She was started on propofol after intubation.

Vitals prior to transfer to the MICU were: t 97.8, BP 120/71, HR
80, RR 20, 100% on ventillator.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Could not be obtained as patient intubated,
somnolent.

Additional history obtained post-extubation: Patient now reports
that she was not intending to kill herself by taking the pills
or using a knife on her wrists. She says that her depression has
generally been under fair to good control, but on the night of
admission she was very upset and felt like she "just snapped."
She now reports two prior hospitalizations approximately 10
yaers ago for depression.

ECG [**2186-2-9**]: Sinus rhythm. J point elevation with early
repolarization in precordial leads is probably a normal variant.
No previous tracing available for comparison.

CXR [**2186-2-9**]: FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: A transesophageal
catheter extends to at least the level of the stomach, possibly
post-pyloric. An ET tube terminates 2.1 cm above the carina. The
lungs are underinflated. The heart size is normal. The hilar and
mediastinal contours are within normal limits. The central
pulmonary vessels appear prominent, with no evidence of overt
edema. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. IMPRESSION:
1. ET tube terminating 2.1 cm above the carina. Recommend
pull-back 1-2 cm.  2. Transesophageal catheter extending to at
least the level of the stomach, possibly post-pyloric.

CXR [**2186-2-9**]: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph,
there is no relevant change. The tip of the endotracheal tube is
still abutting the carina and should be pulled back by
approximately 2 cm. The course of the nasogastric tube is
unchanged and in correct status. Low lung volumes with
developing left retrocardiac atelectasis. No larger pleural
effusions. No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia or
aspiration.
