Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
ventricular tachycardia, ICD generator change

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ICD generator change

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 68 y/o F with PMHx significant for NIICMP
(EF5-10%) s/p AICD/BiV pacer, PAF s/p ablation, who presented to
OSH on [**2145-12-2**] with worsening DOE, cough, runny nose, diarrhea,
fatigue.  BNP was noted to be elevated at 1000, and there was
some concern for dietary indiscretion during a recent trip.
Symptoms were initially attributed to CHF exacerbation, and she
was treated with lasix.  Given leukocytosis, there was also
concern for underlying respiratory infection, for which she was
started on doxycycline.
.
However, on the day after admission, the patient had a syncopal
event while in the bathroom, hitting her head on the door.
During this event, telemetry recorded VT/?torsades and she
received a shock from her AICD.  She endorseded lightheadedness
prior to the event, denies any chest pain, palpitations, or
shortness of breath.  Given that she was scheduled to have and
AICD generator change at [**Hospital1 18**] in the next few weeks, her
cardiologist was contact[**Name (NI) **] and recommended transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
ICD was interrogated at OSH and reported to episodes of
device-classified VT (vs. Afib with RVR).
.
Of note, imaging performed after the patient's head strike was
significant for anterior C4 fracture of unclear chronicity.
Telephone neurosurgery consult was placed at OSH, and it was
recommended that patient be placed in a neck collar.  Patient
also experienced a significant head laceration, which was
sutured prior to transfer.  VS at the time of transfer were HR
80s - 100s with SBP 100s - 110s.  She has been experiencing
significant nausea and diarrhea; her doxycycline has been
stopped out of concern that it could be contributing to her GI
symptoms.
.
On arrival to the CCU, the patient's VS were .  She denies any
shortness of breath or chest pain.  She reports pain in the area
where she struck her forehead.  She denies any other complaints.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations.

Brief Hospital Course:
68F with with a PMH significant for non-ischemic and ischemic
cardiomyopathy (LVEF 5-10%) s/p AICD and biventricular pacer,
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation s/p ablation, admitted to an
outside hospital with worsening dyspnea on exertion, cough,
rhinorrhea, diarrhea and fatigue who was initially treated for a
CHF exacerbation but through her hospital course she developed
ventricular tachycardia and Torsades de Pointes with firing of
her ICD and a shock successfully delivered with maintenance of
her circulation; thus, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
monitoring and AICD generator change.
.
# VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA / TORSADES DE POINTES - The event on
telemetry strip from her outside hospital appears to be
polymorphic ventricular tachycadia with a Torsades de Pointes
morphology. There was no clear inciting event noted. The patient
is not on any new QT-prolonging medications (although Sertraline
and Zofran have been known to prolong the QT), and only new
medication was Doxycycline. She had no significant electrolyte
abnormalities noted (K was 3.5 the morning of admission to the
outside hospital and her magnesium was reassuring). The most
likely etiology at this point seems to be patient's underlying
ischemic cardiomyopathy and prior scarring. Her electrolytes
were optimized with a magnesium of greater than 2.0 and
potassium greater than 4.0 to 4.5. We consulted the
Electrophysiology team and planned for ICD generator change
early in the week. She was maintained on telemtry and had serial
EKG monitoring.
.
# CORONARIES - The patient had no documented history of coronary
disease in our records; or cardiac catheterizations. On
admission, she denied any chest pain and her EKG was without
ischemic changes.
.
# DYSPNEA ON EXERTION - The patient has a known history of
non-ischemic and ischemic cardiomyopathy wi
