Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION:
55-year-old male with DM2, OSA, HTN, COPD presenting with
several weeks of cough, sore throat, and new neck swelling.

ACTIVE DIAGNOSES:
# Periodontal Disease with osteomyelitis of of the jaw: The
patient was initially admitted to the MICU for concern regarding
Ludwig's Angina.  ENT evaluated the patient and ruled out this
diagnosis.  His laryngoscopy showed that there was no concern
for airway compromise. His CT neck showed that he has left
periodontal disease with likely osteomyelitis an infection
tracking to the anterior neck. On admission he was started in IV
unasyn. He was evaluated by the OFMS service and was ultimately
taken to the OR on [**2107-6-30**] for mandibular debridement & bone
sampling. While the final pathology report is still pending,
discussions with the pathologist revealed that the bone showed
areas of osteomyelitis, but there was no concern for cancer.
Mr. [**Known lastname 57913**] antibiotics were ultimately switched to IV ertapenem
1 g daily for 4 weeks.  He was given instructions for weekly
labwork & a follow-up appointments with ID.  OFMS provided him
with instructions to rinse his mouth with chlorhexidine wash and
eat a soft diet.  He was given a follow up appointment at [**Hospital1 2177**].

# [**Hospital 7502**] healthcare associated:  The patient's admission CXR
was concerning for a LLL PNA.  It was decided that given his
risk factors that he would be treated for healthcare-associated
PNA.  As such, he was started on IV vancomycin & IV zosyn (which
replaced the IV unasyn he was initially started on) for [**7-30**]
days.  He had relatively high oxygen requirements on the floor
(up to 6L with 50% by tent) and was transiently readmitted to
the ICU for BiPap after being found poorly responsive &
hypercarbic overnight.  His respiratory status slowly improved;
his oxygen requirement decreased. On discharge he was saturating
in the low-mid 90s on room air and breathing comfortably.

CHRONIC DIAGNOSES:

# Bipolar Disorder: On admission, the patient denied worsening
depression, mania, homicidality, & suicidality.  He was
intermittently agitated and demanding on the floor. Night  float
was called to the patient's bedside for oversedation and poor
responsiveness and it was discovered that he had a PCO2 of 87,
although based on this blood gas result this appeared to be
acute-on-chronic hypercarbia.   It was thought that his
oversedation superimposed on his baseline lung disease could
have caused the acute-on-chronic hypercarbia.  He was readmitted
to the ICU for BiPAP. Psychiatry evaluated the patient and
recommended holding off on additional doses of benzodiazepines
if the patient appeared sedated.  They recommended continuing
clozapine, but holding nighttime doses of depakote if Mr. [**Known lastname 57898**]
appeared too sedated at night.  The patient's outpatient
psychiatrist requested that the patient be evaluated for
inpatient psychiatry placement.  This was offered to the patient
but he refused and the inpatient psychiatry team did not find
any contraindications to discharge once medically stable.

# COPD: The patient was continued on his home medications.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
# Follow-Up: Although the patient is being discharged to
rehabilitation, he has some follow up appointments that need to
be kept.

# Code Status: The patient states that is amenable to intubation
but does not want compressions.
