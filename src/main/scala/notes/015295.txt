[**2178-9-3**] Bedside Swallowing [**Name (NI) **]
Pt is not demonstrating any s&s of aspiration or dysphagia at
this time. Coughing episode this am at breakfast may have been
related to pt's current confusion. However, it appears that pt
can tolerate a PO diet consistency that he is currently ordered
for.

[**2178-9-3**] CXR
1. No evidence of pneumothorax after removal of a right internal
jugular central venous line and removal of left-sided chest
tube.
2. Unchanged mild congestive heart failure.

[**2178-9-1**] EKG
Atrial fibrillation
Q-Tc interval appears prolonged but is difficult to measure
Probable left bundle branch block
Poor R wave progression - could be in part lead placement but
clinical
correlation is suggested
Since previous tracing of [**2178-8-30**], poor R wave progression
present

[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4125**]ospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 32416**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2178-8-29**] for surgical
management of his mitral valve disease. His coumadin was stopped
and heparin was continued. As his INR was slow to drift towards
normal, vitamin K was given with good effect. On [**2178-9-1**], Mr.
[**Known lastname 32416**] was taken to the operating room where he underwent a
mitral valve repair with a 28mm [**Last Name (un) **] [**Doctor Last Name **] annuloplasty
band, a MAZE procedure and a pericardectomy. Postoperatively he
was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit for
monitoring. Amiodarone was started ofr his atrial fibrillation.
On postoperative day one, Mr. [**Known lastname 32416**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**] neurologically intact
and was extubated. Coumadin was resumed. His pacing wires and
drains were removed when protocol was met. Mr. [**Known lastname 32416**]
experienced some confusion and aggitation at night which slowly
resolved over his postoperative course. On postoperative day
two, he was transferred to the cardiac surgical step down unit
for further recovery. Mr. [**Known lastname 32416**] was gently diuresed towards his
preoperative weight. The physical therapy service was consulted
for assistance with his postoperative strength and mobility. Mr.
[**Known lastname 32416**] was noted to have some coughing with a meal and a speech
and swallow consult was obtained. A bedside swallowing
evaluation was performed which showed no evidence of aspiration
and a regular diet was continued without issue. Mr. [**Known lastname 32416**]
continued to make steady progress and was discharged to rehab on
postoperative day #6. He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **],
