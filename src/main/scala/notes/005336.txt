Chief Complaint:
CC:[**CC Contact Info 99585**]
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line removal


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 99580**] us a 73 y.o. Male with a history of NICMY (EF 20%)
s/p AICD, PPM, PAF on Coumadin, AVR s/p recent admission for
shock requiring pressors following Endocardial ablation on Vanc
for GAS bacteremia.
.
Pt was seen in [**Hospital **] clinic today for removal of his PICC lines
after completing a course of IV Vancoymcin for GAS bacteremia.
They had difficulty removing the PICC line, he was then
transferred to IR for removal. In IR the PICC line would not
move over a wire, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] gram showed extensive pericatheter clot
extending to subclavian vein. They infused 6mg tPA via multi
side hole catheter with some improvement in clot burden but no
movement of PICC line. He was thus admitted to the ICU for tPA
infusion with a repeat venogram in the AM.
.
He was recently discharged from the hospital 3 days ago. He was
initially admitted on [**7-14**] after noting some dizziness in [**Hospital **]
clinic. His AICD showed 4 episodes of VT which was treated with
ATP. He underwent an ablation and subsequently had hypotension
requiring pressor support. He was already on a 6 week course of
abx for GAS bacteremia and was changed from Ctx to Vancomycin
[**3-8**] neutropenia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 99580**] is a 73 y.o. Male with a history of NICMY (EF 20%)
s/p AICD, PPM, PAF on Coumadin, AVR s/p recent admission for
shock requiring pressors following endocardial ablation on Vanc
for GAS bacteremia, now here because of difficulty with removing
PICC line.  Clot was visualized. He was treated with tPA and the
PICC was then removed.

#.  Embedded PICC line: Pt was given tPA in the ICU, which he
tolerated well.  PICC was then nremoved by IR.  Pt was then
started on Lovenox bridge to Coumadin as his INR was
subtherapeutic.  INR on transfer back to rehab was 1.9.  Lovenox
can discontinued once INR is therapeutic in 2.0-3.0 range.

#.  Hypotension: Pt did have a couple of episodes of hypotension
to SBP in 70-80s, asymptomatic. Likely [**3-8**] timing of BP meds.
Also, likely mildly hypovolemic [**3-8**] low PO intake. Pt responded
well to small boluses of NS (250cc).  By day of transfer, pt did
not have hypotensive episodes for >24hrs.

#.  DVT:  Patient noted to have RUE DVT.  Started Lovenox to
Couamdin bridge since pt has subtherapeutic INR.  On day of
transfer, INR 1.9. Lovenox can be continued once INR in target
range of 2.0-3.0.  Pt needs daily INR until therapeutic.
Currently on Warafrin 5mg daily dose.

#.  GAS bacteremia: Finished with his ABx course, per ID does
not need any further ABx.  PICC was removed as above.

#.  PAFib: Pt was continued on Coumadin, Amiodarone, Digoxin.
INR is subtherapeutic, will bridge with Lovenox as above.

#.  OSA: Pt noted to have significant desats at night with sleep
(usually to 70s). Pt refuses to use CPAP.  Pt was maintained on
O2 when sleeping. Pt will need outpt sleep study follow up.

Transition Issues:
- trend INR, continue Warfarin 5mg daily, discontinue Lovenox
once INR in target range of [**3-9**].
- encourage PO intake so pt does not have hypotensive episodes.
if required, can give small boluses (250cc) of NS.
- encourage CPAP at night.  if continues to refuse, will need O2
while sleeping.  O2 desats recover with arousal as well.
