History of Present Illness:
  64-year-old man w/ OSA, AF, h/o CVA and CAD presents with
progressive dyspnea x 3 weeks.  He was in his USOH until 3 weeks

becoming SOB.  There is associated increased LE edema over the
past few weeks.  He has occasional cough that is non-productive.
 There is no chest pain, nausea, vomiting, abd pain, fever, or
chills.
  At baseline, he uses home O2 at 2L/min mostly when lying down.
 He uses BiPAP at night prescribed by [**Hospital1 18**] sleep clinic.  Of
note, he has been admitted to [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital multiple times
over the past 2 years for "fluid in my lungs."

Brief Hospital Course:
1.  CHF exacerbation:  he displayed pulmonary edema on admission
[**2-12**] CHF exacerbation.  The etiology of this exacerbation was
unclear.  Ischemia was ruled out with EKG and normal biomarkers.
 He was monitored on telemetry to rule out rapid afib as a cause
of his CHF; he displayed no rapid afib during his admission,
instead displaying occasional episodes of bradycardia with HR as
low as 35, which were sometimes symptomatic with fatigue but all
resolved within 60 seconds.  Treatment was begun with IV lasix,
initially achieving good diuresis.  However, response to lasix
soon became inadequate, and IV nesiritide was begun to aid in
diuresis, with good effect.  He was diuresed with a goal of 1-2L
negative per day throughout his admission, and displayed
progressively decreasing dyspnea and increasing functional
status with treatment.  As his CHF was thought to be [**2-12**] OSA and
pulm HTN, he underwent right heart catheterization to study
hemodynamics, which confirmed pulm HTN as a likely cause of CHF;
2+ mitral regurgitation was also discovered.  He underwent
cardiac cath to evaluate CAD and mitral valve function as a step
in determining the utility of mitral valve replacement as a
treatment for CHF.  He was found to have 1 vessel CAD not
amenable to any intervention, with acceptable mitral valve
function not requiring surgery.  Thus, his CHF was finally
discovered to be predominantly [**2-12**] OSA, obesity hypoventilation,
and pulm HTN, and the mainstay of his treatment was afterload
reduction with diuresis.  He improved steadily with diuresis
until DC, when he is at his baseline functional status:  able to
lie flat without symptoms, requiring BiPAP only at night, and
able to be minimally active without symptoms.

2.  Afib:  he was observed to be in afib during his entire
admission.  He was therapeutic on coumadin at admission.  In
prep for left heart cath, his coumadin was held and he was
covered with heparin until after his procedures were completed,
when coumadin was reinstated before discharge.  He was monitored
on telemetry during his hospital stay.  He was begun on
amiodarone in preparation for attempt at DC cardioversion into
NSR.  After > 1 week of amiodarone, TEE was performed to rule
out intracardiac thrombi, and DC cardioversion was attempted but
failed.  Amiodarone was then DC, and the patient was monitored
on telemetry until DC, at which time he remains in afib and is
not yet therapeutic on coumadin therapy.  He was DC with
instructions to follow-up with his PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 176**] 5 days to check
INR and adjust coumadin dosing as necessary.

3.  OSA:  he was maintained on BiPAP at night on his outpt
settings for OSA, which remained well-controlled during his
admission.

4.  Asthma:  he was maintained on albuterol inhaler during his
admission, with well-controlled symptoms.
