Pertinent Results:
Head CT [**2111-3-2**]:
Significant bifrontal contusions, left occipital skull fx.

Head CT [**2111-3-3**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Overall similar appearance to extensive inferior bifrontal
parenchymal
hemorrhages, inferior bitemporal parenchymal hemorrhages, and
right frontal subdural hematoma.
2. Minimal layering hyperdense material in bilateral occipital
horns likely represents acute blood.

ECHO [**2111-3-3**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately depressed with inferior/inferolateral
akinesis/hypokinesis and hypokinesis elsewhere (LVEF= 30%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

LENIS [**2111-3-3**]:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.

Carotid Ultrasound [**2111-3-3**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. 60-69% stenosis in the left internal carotid artery with no
significant
stenosis in the right internal carotid artery.
2. Diffuse moderate heterogeneous calcified plaque in the
bilateral common
carotid and internal carotid artery, left more than the right.

EEG [**2111-3-5**]:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous telemetry because of
mild to
moderate diffuse background slowing. These findings are
indicative of
mild to moderate diffuse encephalopathy which is etiologically
non-
specific. In addition, there is right more than left
centrotemporal
slowing indicative of a more severe cerebral dysfunction in the
right
centrotemporal region. There are no epileptiform features.

CT Head [**2111-3-5**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No significant interval change in the extensive hemorrhagic
contusions and surrounding edema in the inferior frontal lobes
bilaterally. Stable bilateral temporal lobe hemorrhagic
contusions. Stable small parafalcine frontal subdural hematoma.
2. No evidence of herniation or significant interval change.

EEG [**2111-3-6**]:
IMPRESSION: This EEG is evidence for diffuse slowing of
background
frequencies into the theta and delta bandwidth. There is some
focality
over the central regions with a slight rightsided preference. No

epileptiform activity was identified. No seizures were recorded.


LENIS [**2111-3-11**]:
Negative for DVT

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the ICU on the Neurosurgery service
for frequent neuro checks and systolic blood pressure control
less than 140.  He was loaded with Dilantin for seizure
prophylaxis and started on 100mg TID.  He was given 2 units of
FFP to reverse an INR of 2.4 and started on Vitamin K daily x 3
days.  Given his history of heavy EtOH use he was placed on a
CIWA protocol and observed for signs and symptoms of alcohol
withdrawal.

Syncope work up was performed as the patient had no recollection
of falling.

An EKG was done that revealed sinus rhythm with some ectopy.

A TTE was done that revealed mild left atrium dilation and an
LVEF of 30%. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

An EEG was done that revealed no seizures.

Carotid ultrasounds were performed that revealed: 1. 60-69%
stenosis in the left internal carotid artery with no significant
stenosis in the right internal carotid artery. 2. Diffuse
moderate heterogeneous calcified plaque in the bilateral common
carotid and internal carotid artery, left more than the right.

Lower extremity ultrasound was performed to assess for lower
extremity DVT: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either
leg.

EP was also consulted to interrogate his pacemaker/defibrillator
for any discharges. No arrhythmias were found during pacemaker
interrogation.

On [**3-5**]: patient continued to be disoriented and at 12:30, while
working with PT, patient had a sudden onset episode of speech
arrest and confusion that self resolved. It was thought that
patient may have had a seizure and underwent an EEG that
revealed no seizure activity on final read.

On [**3-6**]- A UTI was noted and Cipro was started. EEG continued to
be negative. [**Date range (1) 25583**], patient remained stable and was awaiting
dispo planning. Physical therapy felt Acute Rehab was needed.
Screening began and patient was approved. On [**3-9**], he had a
short episode of speech arrest that self resolved. Keppra was
added. Patient remained stable.
On [**3-10**] his right pleurex catheter was drained.

On [**3-11**]- we began tapering down Dilantin as there was no EEG
confirmation of seizure. Keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] was continued.
Bilateral lower extremity doppler ultrasound was performed for
extended bedrest and was negative for DVT.

Patient was discharged to [**Location (un) 16493**]Rehab in [**Location 9583**].
At the time of discharge the patient was tolerating a regular
diet, ambulating with assistance, afebrile with stable vital
signs.
