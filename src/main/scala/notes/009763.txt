History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 32090**] is a 66 yo female with a h/o CAD s/p CABG, PVD,
afib/flutter on coumadin, ASA, plavix who presents with BRBPR
since yesterday afternoon. Patient was transferred from The
[**Hospital3 2558**] following two episodes of bright red blood that
filled the toilet bowl. Per transfer note, BP dropped from
139/69 to 100/65 and patient reported feeling dizzy at time of
transfer.

Of note, patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] following
hospitalization for ulcer/cellulitis of the right foot
complicated by atrial flutter. She underwent LE angiography
which revealed total occlusion of the right DP at the site of
the previous PTA. This lesion was not amenable to intervention.
Hospital also started on coumadin for afib/aflutter prior to
discharge.

On arrival to ED, T 98.4, HR 65, BP 105/70. Hematocrit was 29.8,
unchanged from 29.6 on day of discharge [**6-4**]. She received
Vitamin K 5 mg SC x 1. She had an episode of right-side chest
pain and pressure that did not radiate. Chest pain resolved with
Morphine 1 mg IV. She had one episode of maroon stool in the ED.
NG lavage was attempted but was not successful. GI consult was
called and recommended admission to the MICU.

Tagged RBC scan [**2162-6-13**]:
Following intravenous injection of autologous red blood cells
labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic images of the
abdomen for 45 minutes were obtained. A left anterior oblique
view of the pelvis was also obtained. Blood flow images show no
abnormalities. Dynamic blood pool images show tracer
extravasation in the right lower quadrant with movement both
laterally across the abdomen and superiorly. Bleeding was first
noticed at 2 minutes.

CXR [**2162-6-13**]: The moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. The multiple
fractures in the post sternotomy wires as well as the severe
displacement is unchanged as well. There is no pleural effusion
or pneumothorax. The lungs are clear.

Angiography [**2162-6-13**]:
1. Normal angiogram of the superior mesenteric artery and
inferior mesenteric artery with no signs of active bleeding,
vascular malformation, or pseudoaneurysm.
2. Atherosclerotic disease within the [**Female First Name (un) 899**].

CXR [**6-15**]:
O2 requirements, evaluation for interval change. Unchanged
aspect of the multiple fractures in the sternotomy wires. There
might be a newly occurred minimal left-sided pleural effusion,
although apparent blunting
of the left costophrenic sinus might also be caused by a
different patient rotation. The right sinus is clear. Despite
moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, no signs
indicative of overhydration is seen. There is no evidence of
focal parenchymal opacity suggestive of pneumonia.

Colonoscopy [**2162-6-16**]:
Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon
5cm segment of ucleration erythema and friability at the hepatic
flexure with smaller area of ulceration distally (biopsy)
Polyp in the sigmoid colon
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to terminal ileum
Additional notes: Despite the findings on the previous taggged
RBC scan, the bleeding site is clearly the lesion noted at the
hepatic flexure. The cecum and TI were completely normal without
fresh or old blood. The differential for the lesion includes
ischemic colitis and possibly neoplasm. Further management
depends on biopsy findings. If the biopsy does NOT show
neoplasm, recommend repeat colonoscopy in [**3-11**] months to reassess
the area.

Mucosal colon biopsies [**6-16**]:
A.  Hepatic flexure:
Fragments of colonic mucosa with ulceration and acute
inflammation.
Note:  Some fragments show ulceration with acute
inflammation/granulation tissue.  Others are more intact showing
limited abnormality.  No dysplasia or granulomas identified;
findings could represent ischemic changes, but inflammatory
bowel disease cannot be ruled out.
B.  Transverse:
Colonic mucosa, with chronic changes (crypt branching and
irregularity).

b/l LE Dopplers [**6-20**]:  No evidence of DVT.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 32090**] is a 66-year-old woman with history of coronary
artery disease s/p 4-vessel CABG, peripheral vascular disease,
atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter on warfarin, who presented
with bright red blood per rectum for one day.

# Gastrointestinal bleed:
Patient has chronically guaiac-positive stool and was recently
started on warfarin. She has a history of gastrointestinal
bleeding secondary to peptic ulcer disease. A colonoscopy in
[**2158**] revealed sigmoid diverticulosis and internal hemorrhoids.
Shortly after admission, her hematocrit dropped from 29 to 21;
her Hct nadir was 16. Her aspirin, clopidogrel, and warfarin
were held, as were her anti-hypertensives.  In the MICU, she
received 7 units of pRBCs, 7 units of FFP, 2 bags of platelets.
She still had dark red stools.  Her hematocrit was stable in the
low 30s on transfer out of the MICU.
