[**Numeric Identifier 62309**] - CCC
PROCEDURE DATE: [**2122-11-3**]
INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION: Coronary artery disease, aortic
stenosis, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, preop for
colectomy.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Low normal filling right- and left-sided filling pressures.
COMMENTS:
Right heart catheterization demonstrated reduced filling
pressures
consistent with hypovolemia. The right atrial and PCW filling
pressures
were low normal (4 and 6 mmHg), respectively. There was no
pulmonary
arterial hypertension. Using an assumed oxygen consumption, the
cardiac
index (based on finger oximetry) was slightly depressed at 2.3
L/min/m2.
The PA catheter was secured in place with a protective sleeve.
There
was no evidence of pneumothorax on fluoroscopy.
TECHNICAL FACTORS:
Total time (Lidocaine to test complete) = 30 minutes.
Arterial time = 0 minutes.
Fluoro time = 2 minutes.
Contrast:
Non-ionic low osmolar (isovue, optiray...), vol 0 ml
Premedications:
Versed 0.5 mg IV
Fentanyl 25 mcg IV
Anesthesia:
1% Lidocaine subq.
Anticoagulation: none

FINAL REPORT


CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE

REASON: Bruit.

FINDINGS: Duplex evaluation _____ both carotid arteries.
Moderate plaque was
identified on the left. This is homogeneous.

On the right, peak systolic velocities are 86, 58, 103 in the
ICA, CCA, ECA
respectively. The ICA to CCA ratio is 1.5. This is consistent
with less than
40% stenosis.

On the left, peak systolic velocities are 180, 68, 270 in the
ICA, CCA, ECA
respectively. The ICA to CCA ratio is 2.6. This is consistent
with a 60-69%
stenosis.

There is antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries.

IMPRESSION: Moderate left-sided plaque with a 60-69% carotid
stenosis. On
the right, there is a less than 40% stenosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**3-15**] and underwent cabg x3 (LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM, SVG
to PDA)/ and LV lead placement with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Transferred to
the CSRU in stable condition on epinephrine, nitroglycerin, and
propofol drips. Extubated that evening, and remained on insulin
and neo drips. These were weaned off and he was transferred to
the floor that evening. He began gentle diuresis and beta
blockade. Chest tubes were removed on POD #2. He failed to void
on POD #3 and his foley was reinserted ( leg bag). He was
followed by Dr.[**Name (NI) 10529**] urology service, and will need to see him
when discharged from rehab. The patient must also see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
from the EP service in a couple of weeks to schedule device
placement. Pacing wires were removed and he continued to make
good progress on the floor. He was cleared for discharge to
rehab on POD #4 in stable condition.
