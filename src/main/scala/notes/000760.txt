Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 38616**]
Chief Complaint:
Admission for allogenic stem cell transplant

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
allogenic stem cell transplant
Right subclavian central venous line placement and removal
Right internal jugular cental venous line placement
bronchoscopy
Bone marrow biopsy

History of Present Illness:
63 year old woman with AML progressing out of MDS.  She was
induced with 7+3 (daunorubicin and cytarabine) and achieved
remission.  She has received 1 cycle of MiDAC for consolidation
on [**2118-2-28**].

She is admitted in CR1 for allogenic transplant on protocol
07-384.  She reports feeling well, except for mild persistent
fatigue.  She was examined today by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3236**], NP and Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], who determined that she was OK to be admitted for
transplant today.

Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGY HISTORY:
- Panyctopenia noted on preop for excisional biopsy, CBC
revealed  a white blood count of 2.2, hematocrit of 34.2,
platelet count  of 116,000, and MCV of 101 at OSH.
- BM Bx at OSH on [**2117-12-7**] showed dyspoietic granulocytes and
13%
myeloblasts.  There was no immunophenotypic evidence for
lymphoproliferative disorder and the findings were most
suggestive of a clonal myeloid neoplasm thought to be MDS with
excess blasts.
- Referred to [**Hospital1 18**], repeat BM bx on [**1-13**] showed 15% blasts on

aspirate and translocation between chromosome 6 at band 6p23 and
 chromosome 9 at band 9q34
- s/p Idarubicin 7+3 induction Day 1: [**2118-1-21**] Cycle end:
[**2118-2-17**]. During her neutropenic period, she developed acute
fevers with focal erythroderm on her L forearm and distal L>R
leg. Prior to the hospitalization, she had a L parotidectomy for
what turned out to be parotiditis and sialadenitis with a large

retained duct stone. Ultimately, it became clear she had no
persistent infectious process in the parotid bed, but had
evolving carbapenem and cephalosporin erythroderm. Her rashes
improved dramatically with transition to from meropenem to
cefepime to aztreonam. Her course was further complicated by a
fever curve that had regular Tmax in the 101 range, resolving
while on vancomycin, aztreonam, clindamycin and micafungin, but

then recurred first low grade then becoming very hectic and high
 grade to 104 without any focal findings. The vancomycin was
stopped and she defervesced after 72 hours. She soon thereafter
recovered her counts and all antibiotics were discontinued when
her ANC approached 500.
- [**2118-2-28**] - MiDAC Consolidation

OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
-Osteoarthritis
-Left total knee replacement
-Remote cholecystectomy and appendectomy.
-Epilepsy with a history of grand mal seizures. Her last
seizure was four to five years ago. She is followed by a
neurologist in [**Hospital1 392**].
-Hypertension
-Anxiety.


Social History:
She has been married for 41 years. She is a retired post-office
worker. She has three daughters who all live locally. She is a
smoker who quit 26 years ago. She smoked one pack per week for
about 30 years. She does not drink any alcohol due to her
antiepileptic medications.


Family History:
Her mother died of heart complications. Her father died of
emphysema. She has a healthy brother. She has a daughter who was
diagnosed with colon cancer at age 29, currently in remission.
She has another daughter age 31 with a pituitary
tumor and she has a third daughter who is healthy.
