History of Present Illness:
This patient is an 85 year old male with a history of severe
coronary artery disease s/p myocardial infarction, congestive
heart failure, hypertension who presents with chronit
unremitting right lower extremity rest pain and a non-healing
right toe ulcer. The patient received an extensive coronary
work-up prior to presentation and was felt to be a poor
operative candidate given his other co-morbidities. This poor
candidate status was discussed at length with the patient and
his family, who remained quite insistent that, despite the high
risks, we procede with a limb-saving intervention

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and started on IV
antibiotics to treat his non-healing ulcer. Cultures were taken,
and ultimately grew out gram-positive cocci and gram-negative
rods. He was taken to the operating room on [**8-6**] for a right
femoro-peroneal bypass graft with lesser saphenous vein. The
patient initially tolerated this procedure well and was taken to
the vascular surgery ICU for recovery. On the morning of
post-operative day #2, the patient began to complain of chest
pain and was found to have a systolic blood pressure of 85 with
elevated pulmonary artery pressures of 60/30. This picture was
concerning for an active coronary event. The patient was
immediately transferred to the cardiovascular surgery ICU for
further monitoring and treatment. An electrocardiogram showed
new lateral precordial ST-segment elevation. Troponins were
checked and were found to be rising to 0.67. At 2:30am on
post-operative day #3, the patient was found to be tachypnic and
tachcardic. Lasix was given emperically, however, soon after the
patient became unresponsive and asystolic. ACLS protocol was
initiated and the patient was coded for 30 minutes without
return of cardiac function. The patient was pronounced deceased
at 3:57am.
