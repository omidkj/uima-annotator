Codeine / Protamine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4095**]
Chief Complaint:
hip fracture

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2117-1-16**] - Open reduction with internal fixation of right
intertrochanteric femoral fracture


History of Present Illness:
84 y/o male with history of dementia, atrial
fibrillation/flutter on coumadin, AVR/MVR, chronic kidney
disease (baseline cr 1.3), admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2117-1-13**] for
mechanical fall and hip fx.  Course was complicated by.
.
Reportedly, hx was largely obtained from daughter and review of
medical records given patient's baseline dementia. Per daughter,
patient had one fall in [**Name (NI) **], one fall in [**Month (only) **], and of late,
has had three falls in two days. There is no clear prodrome of
lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea, chest pain, or shortness of
breath prior to these falls.
.
on morning of [**2117-1-13**] patient reports that he was putting on
his pants, when he lost his balance, and fell nearby the bed.
Again, there did not appear to be a prodrome or any
cardiopulmonary symptoms prior to his fall.
.
In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, head CT was negative, but hip imaging confirmed
acute comminuted right intertrochanteric femoral fracture. He
was planned as the first case for [**Hospital1 24785**] of R femur on [**2117-1-14**].

.
Prior to procedure, however, he developed acute hypoxic resp
failure and hypotension with desaturations to 80s overnight
after eating a cookie. CXR was obtained revealing findings
consistent with pneumonitis in L mid and lower lung. Temperature
was 100.4, but he has since defervesced.
.
At baseline, per daughter, patient is not very active; however
he does ambulate with a cane. He does not get SOB with this
activity. He previously saw a cardiologist at the VA for his
atrial fibrillation/flutter, which has been stable per daughter.

.
Denies any history of chest pain and denies any shortness of
breath, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope.
.
On review of systems, patient and daughter deny any prior
history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary
embolism, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. There is no recent fevers, chills or rigors. There is no
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
ICU course: [**1-16**] melena + in setting of supratherapeutic INR.
Anticoagulation stopped, reversed with VitK, and transfused 2U
PRBC with appropriate increase in HCT.  Family did not want to
pursue endoscopy.  Pt Crit has since remained stable around 30.
On [**1-17**] pt had episodes of bradycardia to 30s.  Determined to
be secondary to AF with variable block [**2-18**] increased vagal tone.
 episodes have since resolved.  [**Month/Day (2) 24785**] was performed on [**2117-1-16**],
without complications.  [**Name (NI) **] pt was in significant pain,
requiring pain service consult and epidural catheter, which has
since been removed.  Pt also experienced worsening dyspnea
likely secondary to volume overload.  CXR showed vascular
congestion.  He was given 10mg Lasix 2pm on [**2117-1-17**] and diuresed
500ml.  He was +7L for LOS in ICU.
Last episode of melena was [**2117-1-16**].  Vitals on transfer -
afebrile, 134/80, 74, 20, 94% on 4L NC

[**2117-1-18**]
IMPRESSION:
1) Interval improvement in CHF findings.
2) Residual opacities in left greater than right lungs. While
this could
represent some residual CHF, the possibility of an underlying
infiltrate
cannot be entirely excluded.
3) Continued, but improved, left lower lobe collapse and/or
consolidation, and
probable small effusions.
4) Possible nodular opacity, right upper lobe. Close attention
to this area on followup films and, if indicated, further
assessment with CT would be recommended. However, this may be an
artifact related to the acute process, as there is no
corresponding abnormality on the film from [**2117-1-13**] at 11:48
a.m.

[**2117-1-19**]
CXR
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2117-1-14**] through [**2117-1-18**]:

Symmetric bilateral perihilar opacifications in the mid and
upper lung zones has improved since [**2117-1-17**] and previous
moderate right pleural effusion has decreased substantially. The
comparative changes are due to improved cardiac function.
Reviewing prior chest radiographs, this admission suggests a
preceding left lung pneumonia. Whether there is any contribution
of fat embolism syndrome to the edema, it would depend upon the
time course of therapy for the patient's long bone fractures.

Right jugular line ends in the mid SVC. No pneumothorax.

INDICATION: New nasogastric tube placement.

COMPARISON: [**2117-1-19**].

FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient
has received a nasogastric tube. The course of the tube is
unremarkable, the tip of the
