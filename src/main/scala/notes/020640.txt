History of Present Illness:
87 year old nonverbal female with history of steroid dependent
COPD (20mg) on home oxygen (2L), end-stage dementia, HTN, HL
with an indwelling foley presenting from [**Hospital **] rehab nursing
home with agitation.  Per the patient's daughter, [**Name (NI) 93604**] was more
restless and agitated last weekend, which was worse this week.
She noted an increase in arm movement and twitching overall.
The daughter denies any recent coughing or vomiting in her
mother.  [**Name (NI) **] daughter noted her mother's constipation and 10lb
weight loss over the past month.  In addition, she has had a
[**Name (NI) **] on her back which was thought to be yeast.  [**Hospital 100**] rehab
did blood work this week which revealed a sodium of 150 but
otherwise normal labs and a normal CXR.  Plan at that point was
to push oral hydration.  She was given morphine for agitation.
However, her restlessness continued and "she was not herself" so
her daugheter insisted that she be sent to the ED.
.
Upon arrival to the ED, initial V/S were: 104 74 104/74 36 98%
on 2L.  Her fever was 102 rectally.  Hyperglycemic to 616 and
received 2L of IVF.  It came down to 449 after IVF.  No insulin
given.  UA revealed UTI, so her chronic indwelling foley was
exchanged.  Urine and blood cultures sent.  CXR unremarkable
here per ED with the exception of an elevated left
hemidiaphragm.  Labs revealed a lactate of 4.4.  She was given
vanco/zosyn.  She was given a dose of fluconazole given
vulvovaginal candidiasis.  Looks well after fluids, better eye
contact.  V/S prior to transfer: 102.4 76 117/81 32 98% on 2L
after 1 gram rectal tylenol.  Osm 353.  Access 20G, working on
2nd PIV.

On the floor, she is nonverbal, but does not appear to be in any
discomfort.

Radiology:
Lower extremity ultrasounds: Bilateral deep venous thrombus,
right greater than left as detailed above. Left [**Hospital Ward Name 4675**] cyst as
well.

Video Swallow: With nectar-thickened liquids, there is
regurgitation following normal swallowing resulting in laryngeal
penetration, this is all the result of a prominent
cricopharyngeal bar. With thicker liquids, there is no evidence
of laryngeal penetration, though pooling in the vallecula and
piriform sinuses is seen.

CXR [**8-9**]: Compared with [**2195-8-4**], the cardiomediastinal silhouette
is stable. There is
patchy opacity at the left lung base. Though the previously seen
atelectasis
appears to have improved, the degree of patchy opacity has
increased. There
is minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle. There is
upper zone
redistribution, but I doubt overt CHF. Some parenchymal scarring
is likely
present in the right upper zone medially, but I suspect this
represents a
chronic finding. Otherwise, no focal infiltrate and no effusion
on the right
side.

Brief Hospital Course:
87 yo nonverbal female with end stage dementia, COPD on home O2,
and chronic indwelling foley who presents from rehab with fever
and agitation.

# Severe sepsis:  Patient presented with altered mental status,
found to have fever, leukocytosis with left shift, elevated
lactate, and renal dysfunction.  Differential for source
included urosepsis given +UA vs. pneumonia given spine sign.
This was felt most likely urosepsis given +leukocyte esterase
and +WBC on urinalysis, and Ucx with GNR which later speciated
to be Pseudomonas and Proteus with some likely Enterococcus as
well. Patient was initially covered with vanco/zosyn in
anticipation of resistant organisms as patient is nursing home
resident. She was fluid resuscitated and placed on stress dose
steroids for her hypotension, which resolved.  Her left shift
resolved and her U/A cleared. She was transitioned to Meropenem
and Vancomycin when it was discovered she had a history of ESBL
infections. She was treated for 8 days with Vancomycin to cover
HCAP and 14 days of Meropenem (until [**2195-8-15**]) to cover
complicated UTI given resistant organisms and chronic indwelling
Foley.

# Aspiration: Patient was noted to aspirate with oxygen
