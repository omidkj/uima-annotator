Service:  [**Doctor Last Name 1181**]-ME

IDENTIFYING DATA:  68 year old male with respiratory failure,
now resolved, and stable for transfer to Medical Floor.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 68 year old
male with a past medical history significant for tuberculosis
in [**2108**] treated for 15 months (medication unknown), who was
initially transferred from an outside hospital to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit in respiratory distress and hypotension.
The patient is now stable for transfer to the Medical Floor
([**2131-7-7**]).

Respiratory failure was thought secondary to supra infection
of underlying bronchiectasis.  The patient was intubated at
the outside hospital and extubated on [**6-30**] in the
Medical Intensive Care Unit at [**Hospital1 188**].  The patient had an open lung biopsy which was
performed by CT Surgery which revealed bronchiolitis
obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP).  The patient had
received a 14 day course of Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin.
The Ceftriaxone was thought to cause acalculous cholecystitis
but liver function tests have since then trended down.  The
patient is AFB smear times three negative and TB was ruled
out.

Percutaneous ultrasound guided gallbladder aspiration had
revealed no infection.  A chest tube on the right side was
removed on [**7-5**].  The patient continues on Prednisone for
BOOP.  The patient on transfer to the Medical Floor looked
well off antibiotics status post extubation and awaiting
Physical Therapy evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Tuberculosis in [**2108**] with no other past medical history,
previously healthy and on no prior medications.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Lopressor 25 mg p.o. twice a day.
3.  Prednisone 40 mg p.o. q. day.
4.  Reglan 10 mg intravenous q. six hours.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in [**Location 16843**] with his
family.  The patient has a heavy smoking history in the past
but quit six years ago; he apparently smoked for
approximately 20 years with five to six cigarettes per day as
per patient.  The patient is Pakistanian and immigrated to
the United States in [**2106**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  (On transfer) Vital signs afebrile,
blood pressure 132/66; heart rate of 84; respiratory rate of
17; O2 saturation 96% on one liter of nasal cannula.  General
appearance, in no acute distress, alert and awake in good
spirits, family present.  HEENT:  No jugular venous pressure.
Pupils equally round and reactive to light.  Extraocular
muscles are intact.  Normocephalic, atraumatic.
Oropharyngeal area clear with moist mucous membranes.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2
with no murmurs.  Lungs:  Coarse rhonchi at the lower
one-half on the right, quiet bilaterally at the bases and the
left side is clear.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended,
with normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities with no signs of
cyanosis, clubbing or edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 15.9, hematocrit
33.8, platelets 240.  Chem-7 as well as calcium, phosphorus
and magnesium are normal.  Gallbladder fluid culture with no
growth.

Liver function tests normalized.

Chest x-ray [**7-5**], no pneumothorax status post chest tube
removal.  History of TB, bilateral upper lobe volume loss,
multiple pleural and parenchymal abnormalities.

Lung biopsy [**6-26**], organized pneumonitis secondary to
viral/bacterial infection, superimposed with thromboembolic
findings.

Echocardiogram [**6-20**], normal atrium, ejection fraction of 50
to 55% with one plus mitral regurgitation.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient is a 68 year old
male admitted with respiratory failure and hypertension
admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit likely secondary
to super infection of underlying bronchiectasis found to have
BOOP (bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia) by
lung biopsy, now in stable respiratory condition and
transferred to the Medical Floor on [**7-7**].

1.  Pulmonary:  The patient had respiratory failure thought
to be secondary to super infection of underlying
bronchiectasis found to have BOOP by lung biopsy and was in
stable respiratory condition upon transfer to the Medical
Floor.  The patient had been extubated on [**6-30**], and O2
saturations were in the mid to upper 90s, weaned to room air.
The patient continues on Prednisone for BOOP and will be
discharged on a dose of 20 mg p.o. q. day.

The patient will have follow-up with Pulmonary Clinic upon
discharge.  The patient will be going to a rehabilitation
facility.

2.  Cardiovascular:  The patient was placed on Telemetry upon
transfer to the Floor.  There was a report of one transient
episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate in
which the patient was started on Lopressor on [**7-4**].  The
dose has currently been stable at 25 mg p.o. twice a day.  It
was not unusual that the patient was found to be in atrial
fibrillation in the setting of his respiratory failure.

In the long term, discontinuation of Lopressor should be
considered.  During the hospital stay, the patient was
otherwise hemodynamically stable.

On lung biopsy, thromboembolic findings were discovered and
anti-coagulation was considered although given the report of
guaiac positive stools with stable hematocrit, the patient
was not started on any anti-coagulation.  These findings on
lung biopsy should be followed up in Pulmonary Clinic to
reconsider the issue of anti-coagulation.

3.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient had increased in liver
function tests during his stay in the Medical Intensive Care
Unit which was thought to be secondary to acalculous
cholecystitis from treatment with Ceftriaxone.  The liver
function tests prior to discharge have since been resolved.
A gallbladder fluid aspirate was obtained and culture had
shown no growth.

4.  Follow-up:  The patient will have an appointment for
follow-up in Pulmonary Clinic.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:   Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehabilitation facility.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post respiratory failure now resolved, diagnosed
with bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia
(BOOP), by lung biopsy.
2.  Tuberculosis in [**2108**] treated with 15 months of
medications.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Prednisone 20 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q. day.
3.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q. day.
4.  Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day.
