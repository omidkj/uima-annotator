Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5831**]
Chief Complaint:
Seizures

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Lumbar puncture

History of Present Illness:
85 year-old woman with a history of a left frontal meningioma
and seizures, s/p recent cyberkife treatments completed [**2171-5-2**], who presents as a transfer from and outside hospital with
seizures.

The patient initially presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2171-1-4**] with finding herself down at home on the floor.  She was
apparently found by family and neighbors and taken to [**Name (NI) 5109**] for evaluation.  A left frontal lobe lesion was noted
on imaging and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation.  She was noted to have non-fluent speech and
preserved
comprehension here.  After stabilization and initiation of
Keppra, she was discharged in early [**Month (only) 956**].  She was followed
serially with scans and maintained on seizure medications.
[**Month (only) 958**] and [**Month (only) 116**] imaging showed stable size of the lesion, though
there was significant peritumoral edema.  However, she remained
seizure free on Keppra.   After a neurosurgical consult deemed
her a a
non-surgical candidate due to her age and the location of the
tumor (proximity
to the sagittal sinus), she underwent Cyberknife therapy from
[**4-30**]-29th and reportedly tolerated the procedure without
difficulties.

Today the patient was reportedly found "confused" by neighbors,
with  speech "difficulties", and seemed to be staring off at the
environment around her.  She was brought to [**Hospital3 **]
at ~2:30 pm.  A preliminary laboratory evaluation was performed,
and revealed a leukocytosis of 11.5 with left shift (77% PMN),
BUN 24, glucose 97.  Electrolytes and coagulation studies were
within normal limits.  Outside hospital scans reveal that the
lesion had not changed in size from [**2170-12-6**].  No hemorrhage
or mass effect was noted.  Chest x-ray was read as consistent
with [**Hospital1 **]-basilar atelectasis or scar, greater on the left than
right.  She was transferred to [**Hospital3 **] for further
evaluation.

Here, the patient was found to be febrile to 101.4 F.  She was
noted to have several episodes of fencer-like posturing to the
right.  She has thus far-received 2 mg lorazepam twice.
Broad-spectrum antibiotics (including vancomycin, ceftriaxone,
and ampicillin) and anti-virals (acyclovir) are being initiated.
 The patient has been given 10 mg dexamethasone.  However, the
CXR
is concerning for a patchy LLL opacity.

Past Medical History:
osteoporosis
basal cell carcinoma
glaucoma
s/p vertebral kyphoplasty


Social History:
Lives alone in an [**Hospital3 **] with functional capacity as
per HPI. Quit smocking in the [**2121**]. Ambulates independently.


Family History:
No siblings. Father died at 52 from unknown cancer and a "[**Last Name **]
problem"

Physical Exam:
Vitals: T 101.4 F  BP 104/93 P 65  RR 28  SaO2 91 on 3LNC,
improves to 100 on 5LNC
General: elderly woman, initially somewhat awake, but later
sleepy after lorazepam administered
HEENT: NC/AT, sclerae anicteric, MMM, no exudates seen in
oropharynx
Neck: no nuchal rigidity, no bruits
Lungs: poor effort, and decreased breath sounds bilaterally
CV: regular rate and rhythm, no MMRG
Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present
Ext: warm, no edema, pedal pulses appreciated

Neurologic Examination:
Mental Status:
Initially awake between episodes, but gets more sleepy as time
passes.   She does not speak or follow commands.

Cranial Nerves:
Optic disc difficult to see given miosis; appears to blink to
threat bilaterally.  Pupils equally round and minimally reactive
to light, at 1.5 mm bilaterally.  Looks left and right while
awake, but does not follow commands for vertical gaze.  Corneal
and nasal tickle intact bilaterally.  Appears to have a subtle
right facial droop, upper motor neuron pattern.  Gag intact.

Sensorimotor:
Fencer-like posturing to the right, associated with head and eye
deviation in that direction are noted as well.  She withdraws
minimally to noxious in any extremity, but does grimace
throughout.

Reflexes:
2's at the biceps, difficult to elicit elsewhere.  Toes were
upgoing on the right and downgoing on the left.

Coordination and gait: Unable to perform.


Pertinent Results:
CT chest/[**Last Name (un) 103**]/pelvis
1. No evidence for pulmonary nodule or mass.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis.
3. Mild biliary prominence likely secondary to prior
cholecystectomy.
4. No evidence for intra-abdominal malignancy. Mild splenomegaly
is of
uncertain significance.
5. Extensive degenerative changes in the thoracolumbar spine,
with
compression deformities of T6 and T7 vertebral bodies, status
post T6
vertebroplasty.
6. Hypoattenuating thyroid nodules. Correlation with ultrasound
is
recommended on a non-emergent basis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname **] is an 85 year-old woman with a history of left
frontal meningioma, s/p recent Cyberknife treatments, who
presented as a transfer from [**Hospital3 **] with seizures.
She was noted to have fencer-posturing toward the right.  On
examination, she had an expressive aphasia.  Comprehension and
repetition were preserved. There was concern for a possible
pneumonia based on the left lower lobe opacity, in addition to a
meningitis. Ms [**Known lastname **] was admitted overnight into the neuro
ICU service. She had a lumbar puncture in the unit, she was
covered with Ceftriaxone, Acyclovir and Vancomycin until her CSF
Gram stain results were negative. Since her CXR was suggestive
of a pneumonia, she was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn. Her
Vancomycin level prior to discharge was 19.5. However, on Zosyn
she developed a right focal motor seizure in her arm, so this
was discontinued, and she was started on Ceftazidine. Her
primary care physician was [**Name (NI) 653**], who mentioned that her
compliance was an issue, which is probably why she developed
seizures. She was initially loaded on Dilantin and then
maintained on Dilantin and Keppra. Once the therapeutic dose of
Keppra was obtained, a Dilantin taper was planned in the
outpatient setting. The Keppra dose was increased from 750 mg
[**Hospital1 **] to 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **], to try and stop the focal motor seizures. It
is however, not necessary to eliminate the focal motor seizures
completely with benzodiazepines because these agents may
compromise her airways.

On [**5-11**] the day she was planned to be discharged to rehab she had
sudden syncopal episode followed by respiratory decompensation
and subsequent cardiovascular collapse of unclear etiology.
Code Blue was called and she was not able to be resusitated
despite aggressive CPR measures.  She passed away at 9:47am on
[**2171-5-11**].

Medications on Admission:
DEXAMETHASONE -  (Dose adjustment - no new Rx) - 4 mg Tablet -
One Tablet(s) by mouth twice a day Take as directed, taper as
follows: Take 4 mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**5-2**] thru [**5-5**].  Take 4 mg QAM & take
2
mg QPM on
