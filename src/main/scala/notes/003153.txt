Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer for ERCP

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP [**2131-9-18**]

History of Present Illness:
84 year old male with a history of of coronary artery disease,
sick sinus syndrome s/p pacemaker, chronic kidney disease and
recent prolonged hospitalization for gangrenous cholecystitis
s/p open cholecystectomy complicated by bile leak requiring
external drainage in [**2131-8-1**].  The initial surgery was
performed on [**2131-8-11**].  On entering the abdomen he was noted to
have gangrenous cholecystitis.  He had extensive adhesions and
it was difficult to dissect the fascial planes.  It was not
possible to remove the entire gallbladder and the gallbladder
was instead divided 1 cm above the takeoff of the cystic duct.
He was ultimately discharged to Blueberry [**Doctor Last Name **] nursing home on
[**2131-8-24**].  Per notes his subhepatic drain was removed on [**2131-9-14**].

.
He represented to [**Hospital **] hospital on [**2131-9-16**] with right upper
quadrant pain and chills.  On arrival to [**Hospital **] hospital he was
afebrile with a HR of 78, BP of 98/57, O2 saturation 95% on RA.
WBC count on presentation was 20.4 with normal transaminases.
CT scan done on admission showed a distended gallbladder with
irregular contour and thickened wall and pericholecystic
inflammatory changes suspicious for acute cholecytsitits with
possible track from the gallbladder to the skin.  He was started
on IV antibiotics initially with Unasyn and then Zosyn.  He
underwent drainage of subhepatic fluid collection on [**2131-9-17**]
with removal of 50mL thicky cloudy bile and a 12 F catheter was
placed.  He was transferred to this hospital for ERCP and
internalization of his biliary drain.
.
He was transferred to the ERCP suite.  He was intubated
periprocedure.  The procedure was technically uncomplicated and
he had two plastic stents placed.  During the procedure his
blood pressure was labile ranging from the 60s to 130s systolic.
 He required treatment with neosynephrine at 0.5 mcg/kg.  He
received 1.5 L IVF and made 120 cc urine.  There was minimal
blood loss.  He was extubated in the PACU and transferred to the
medical ICU ([**Hospital Ward Name 332**]).

Neosynephrine was turned off on arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with blood
pressures in the 120s to 130s systolic. In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he
currently had no complaints.  He denied fevers, chills, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, hematuria, leg pain
or swelling.  He continued to endorse abdominal pain, worst in
the right upper quadrant.

Imaging:
CXR [**2131-9-18**]: Extremely low lung volumes may account for much of
the prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart.
Bibasilar atelectatic change without definite acute focal
pneumonia. Pacemaker device is in place. No evidence of
intubation on this study. Of incidental note is an apparent tube
in the right mid abdomen laterally.

Stomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal
Duodenum: Limited exam of the duodenum was normal
Major Papilla: Normal major papilla
Cannulation:  Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and

medium was injected resulting in partial opacification.
.
Biliary Tree: Extravasation of dye was noted at the gallbladder.
