Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1257**]
Chief Complaint:
Unresponsive

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
A Line [**1-27**]
Lumbar Puncture ([**1-27**], [**1-30**])

History of Present Illness:
51 yo Male with a history of HIV CD4 152 VL 1340, h/o bacterial
meningitis x2, and history of cerebral toxoplasmosis in [**2131**],
[**2132**], currently on treatment, and seizures, who presented to the
ED by EMS unresponsive.  EMS initially thought this was an
oxycontin overdose. Upon giving Narcan, his respiratory rate
went up from 4 to 40. He was reportedly alert but combative.

In the ED, initial vs were: T 101.9 P 137 BP 110/P R 30 O2 sat
73% on RA. Upon arrival to the ED, patient was febrile to T 102,
altered, combative and hypoxic to the low 70s on RA. He was
urgently intubated. On intubation, airways were notably full of
purulent secretions.

Patient was given 3L IV NS. Atropine, fentanyl, versed in the
setting of intubation. He was given Vanc, Ctx, Levofloxacin. He
received methylprednisolone 125mg x2. He was not given
Ampicillin b/c of allergy to PCN. Head CT showed 13 x 7 mm
hypodensity in the left medial cerebellar hemisphere with
surrounding edema. Thus, LP was not attempted. Neurosurgery was
consulted, but had not evaluated the patient prior to transfer
to the MICU. Acyclovir was ordered but not administered prior to
transfer. Tamiflu was also ordered.  Vitals prior to transfer:
HR 92 BP 106/60 RR 22 100% T 101.9.

On the floor, patient is intubated and sedated.

Per his partner, the patient went to see his primary care doctor
5 days prior to admission. He complained of coughing and
shortness of breath. He was not found to have a fever at that
time.

One day prior to admission, the patient went with his
significant other to see his therapist. He also saw his
psychiatrist and was sleepy at that time. When he got home
around 4pm, his significant other [**Name (NI) 28167**] him very sleepy, so she
let him sleep for several hours. He ate dinner afterwards. When
she fed him his drink she noticed that he spilt his drink on the
floor. She gave him another drink, and again he spilt it on the
floor. She noticed that he had poor movement of his R side.

After leaving the room for a few minutes, she found him on the
ground. She helped him to get up. He slept well overnight.   On
the morning of admission, he slept much longer than usual. When
his partner tried to wake him up around 11am, he didn't respond.
She called EMS thereafter.

Studies:
CT Head:
1. Hypodense lesion within the medial left cerebellar
hemisphere,
nonspecific, but may indicate an area of infection, chronic
infarct, or small mass with surrounding edema. MRI is
recommended for further evaluation. 2. No intracranial
hemorrhage. 3. Coarse calcifications within the left thalamus,
extending into the mid brain, likely due to sequela of prior
toxoplasmosis infection. 4. Extensive sinus opacification,
likely related to intubation. 5. Opacification of the left
mastoid air cells may suggest ongoing inflammation.

MRI Head:
Partially limited examination related to motion artifacts. The
pattern of
enhancement in the previously described lesion at the left mid
brain appears less conspicuous with no abnormal enhancement.
Persistent areas with high- signal intensity on T2 and FLAIR on
the left cerebellar hemisphere and left mid brain, no diffusion
abnormalities are detected or new lesions. Maxillary mucosal
thickening is noted, more significant on the left.

CT Head: 1. No intracranial hemorrhage. Unchanged size and
appearance of the ventricles. 2. Subtle
