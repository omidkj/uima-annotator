History of Present Illness:
41 year-old morbidly obese male with hx of progressively
worsening lymphadema, hx of abnormal LFT's, enlarged liver on CT
([**2149-12-4**]) who presented to the [**Hospital 1560**] clinic today for a
pre-op evaluation for possible gastric bypass surgery who was
referred to the ED after noted to have wheezing and dyspnea.  In
terms of lymphadema, he has gained 180lbs in the last 2 years.
He is being followed by [**Hospital 59973**] clinic.  He is able to
ambulate with assistance but spends most of his time sleeping
and watching TV.  In terms, of his LFT's an liver enlargment, he
was told that he has a fatty liver.  For his lymphadema, he was
taking Lasix 20-30 mg po qd until 15 days ago when he self-D/C'd
since it was not working.  Pt noticed SOB today and wheezing
today, and never had this before.  His wife also reports that he
has been bruising more easily.
.
In the ED, his CXR was noted to be in mild CHF, EKG with sinus
tach but no R-side strain.  He was afebrile, normotensive
140/70, and O2sat 97% RA.  D-dimer was 3425 but was unable to
get CTA due to orthopnea and also due to body habitus.  He got
albuterol and IV lasix 40 mg, and felt better after having
~800cc UOP.  He also received KCl 60 meq x 2, and Ceftriaxone.
Since the suspicion for PE was high, he was empirically started
on Heparin drip.  He was ordered for RUQ U/S and LENI but could
not get in the ED due to tenuous respiratory status.
.
He was transferred to the floor.  When he was carried from the
stretcher to the chair, he desaturated to 77% on RA and appeared
cyanotic.  He started to shake, but after giving him 100% NRB,
his O2sat immediately came up to 99% and was able to wean down
to 4LNC.  When he was transferred from the chair to the bed, he
again became cyanotic, unresponsive, and had a seizulre like
activity.  Code was then called.  He was given 100% NRB but
difficult to check the O2sat.  Initially, it was difficult to
palpate his pulse and measure his BP.  He was given up to 8 mg
ativan. Initially the team was unclear if a pulse was present.
There was also a delay of several minutes obtaining a blood
pressure as there were no appropriate sized cuffs. However SBP
subsequently noted to be in 180s. There was a concern for
bradycardia at one point (though per team in retrospect ?related
to lead displacement)--> received atropine 1 mg and epinephrine
1 mg with a HR response to 130s and SBP to 180s. An ABG showed
6.9/118/107 on unclear amount of O2 prior to intubation, which
was difficult. He then received 1 amp HCO3 for this acidosis. A
later ABG was 7.12/85/232 shortly after intubation. Stat cardic
echo showed no evidence of RV collapse or RH strain.


Past Medical History:
- morbid obesity
- chronic LE lymphedema
- hepatic mass
- chronic transaminitis: CT of liver described as "fatty" per pt


Social History:
Pt lives in [**Location **] with his wife (they have no children). They
have cats. He worked as a horticulturalist for [**Street Address(1) 59974**]
Service until [**2150-7-5**] when he stopped working because of his
worsening lymphedema. He smokes ?????? pack a day and has smoked for
20 years. He does not drink any alcohol anymore. He stopped
approximately six months ago when he found out he had a fatty
liver (he had been drinking a six pack a day). Pt has not used
any recreational drugs since he used marijuana and cocaine in
high school.


Family History:
Pt??????s father is 82. [**Name2 (NI) **] had an MI at 65 and has emphysema (even
though he only smoked for several months). Pt??????s mother is 80 and
she has asthma and arthritis. An aunt died of colon cancer. No
history of liver problems or lymphedema in family.

Brief Hospital Course:
ICU Course:
Patient was transferred to the MICU for respiratory failure. He
was intubated and wa empirically treated for CHF, pneumonia, and
possible PE. He was on Heparin gtt but was discontinued after
severe oral/tongue bleed. He got echo which showed enlarged LA,
EF 50-60%, mild symmetric LVH, dilated RV cavity. He started to
get diuresed with standing lasix and later to lasix drip. He is
negative 1.8 L during the ICU stay and his respiratory status
improved accordingly. He likely was volume overloaded as he
self-D/C'd po lasix at home, and had increased RV pressure ->
right side failure -> LV dysfuncton from interventricular septal
effect. He likely has chronic hypercarbia from OSA. He got right
IJ placed. In terms of vent, he was able to wean to PSV on [**5-15**],
did well on spontanenous breathing trial on [**5-16**], and self
extubated on [**5-16**]. He was stable on 2 L nasal canula when he was
called out to the floor.

Floor Course by System:

1)CHF: He likely has significant right side failure from obesity
and OSA.  The echo showed EF>55% but dilated RV and mild
symmetric LVH.  Pt got aggressive diuresis in the ICU.  When he
was getting IV lasix 60 mg [**Hospital1 **], he got diuresed total of 8 L.
Lasix regimen was eventually titrated to po Laix 60 mg [**Hospital1 **] which
he was able to diureses about [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1999**] ml/day.  He got an
intruction by the team and the nutritionist regarding the low
sodium diet and fluid restriction.  He was started on Metoprolol
25 mg [**Hospital1 **] and Lisinopril 5 mg qd for his heart failure.  He will
follow up with Pulmonary/Sleep [**Hospital **] clinic for his presumed
sleep apnea which is likely contributing to his right side heart
failure.  He tried BIPAP as well as CPAP on the floor and
tolerated well.  We have lended him a CPAP machine to be used at
home until he gets his own machine arranged after the sleep
study.  He was instructed to weigh himself daily but since he
weighs >400 lb, he does not have a big enough scale to measure
him.  He was told to return to the ED if he notices worsening LE
edema or SOB.  Prior to discharge, he was able to ambulate on
his own without oxygen.  His O2sat was 96-97% on RA at rest.

2)Fever: Pt had a new fever on [**5-18**]. Likely from line infection
as femoral line tip showed coag neg staph.  Both the femoral and
the IJ line were pulled.  He was initially on Vancomycin but as
the blood culture from [**5-18**] showed no growth, Vanc was
discontinued.  He continued to have intermittent low grade
temperature to 100.3.  CXR showed no pneumonia and UA was clean.
 He was discharged without any antibiotics and was told to come
back if he spikes a fever.

3)Lympahdema: Likely from his right side heart failure which has
been neglected for years.  He notes that he has gained about 200
lb over the last 2 years.  This is likely from his right side
failure in addition to high salt/fluid intake.  With his new
regimen of Lasix 60 mg [**Hospital1 **], hopefully he would gradually be able
to diurese his total excess body weight.

4)Pain: Pt with musculoskeletal pain on his right side, likely
from the code. Hip film negative for fracture or dislocation on
both hips.  He was given NSAIDS and morphine for pain.  He also
noted right side sciatic pain.  He has a chronic back pain and
he may have had worsening disc herniation during the code.  He
will have home PT.

5)Liver:  He carries a diagnosis of "fatty liver" and
hepatomegaly seen on the CT scan from [**Month (only) 404**].  His AFP was
elevated at 12 and LFT'
