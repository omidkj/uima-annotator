Brief Hospital Course:
By Problem

*)[**Name (NI) 104639**] Pt initially presented from NH to ED with fever and
malaise for 4d. On admision her temp was 105.8, HR 101, and BP
106/84.  Her SBP progressivley decreased to 90s in spite of 2L
of IVF.  A lactate was measured and found to be 5.6.  She was
admitted to the MICU, a central line was placed, and she was
started on ceftriaxone and pressors.  During her 3d MICU stay,
she remained hypotensive and blood cultures were positive for
proteus sensitive to ceftriaxone. SHe was gradually weaned of
pressors and transfered to the floor.  She has remained afebrile
and normotensive during her 6 days on the floor.  She was
continued on ceftriaxone for a total of 8 days and was switched
to keflex (cultures also sensitive)po on discharge. ON U/A she
did have funguria so she was started on a 5d course of diflucan.
Her UA was free of bacteria,yeast, and WBC at the time of
discharge.
*)Acute Renal Failure - Secondary to poor perfusion,
Mrs[**Doctor Last Name **] Cr rose to 1.8 form a baseline of 1.8.  This
responed to fluids/pressors and her Cr steadily decreased back
to baseline.
*)Hematuria - She has had microscopic hematuria for sometime.
DUring her hospital stay there was gross hematuria.  Urology was
consulted to a R renal mass seen on US and CT scan.  CT urogram
showed appearnce consitant with blood/protein in R renal pelvis.
Urine cytology was negative for malignant cells. Urology
recommended outpt f/u and appointment made for the begining of
[**Month (only) 216**].

*)Heart Failure - Pt received multiple liters of IVF during MICU
stay.  When she came to the floor, CWR showed no signs of heart
failure however physical exam had lots of wheezing unresponsive
to nebs.  She was gently diuresed with ethacyrnic acid and her
breathing imporved. COntinued on aldactone once hypotension
resolved.

*)Thrombocytopenia - Plts were low in the context of sepsis and
large spleen secondary to cirrhosis.  Her counts steadily
improved without intervention.  An HIT antibody was sent and was
negative.

*)Cirrhosis - NASH diagnosis.  Was not an issue during this
hospital stay.  Contiuned on lactulose for two BM per day.
