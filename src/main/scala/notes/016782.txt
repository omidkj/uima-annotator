Chief Complaint:
Abdominal and back pain for past few days after falling at home

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 25067**] is a 61yo female, current smoker with no other PMH who
presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED after falling several days ago at home.
She has had some pain in her shoulder. She was not complaining
of any abdominal pain in the ED. Workup in the emergency [**Hospital1 **]
documented leukocytosis acidosis and free air under the
diaphragm. Of note is that the patient had fairly significant
renal dysfunction with a creatinine of 3.5, as well as a
significant coagulopathy in the absence of anticoagulant
therapy. After antibiotics and a brief resuscitation
including fresh frozen plasma, the patient was brought to the
operating room for exploration with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST

Reason: 61 yo female sp gastric ulcer perforation now WBC 27
with lo
Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
61 yo female sp gastric ulcer perforation now WBC 27 with low
grade temperatures. Please vealutae for an abescess and if there
is a coillection please drain
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
61 yo female sp gastric ulcer perforation now WBC 27 with low
grade temperatures. Please vealutae for an abescess and if there
is a coillection please drain
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Status post gastric ulcer perforation, now with
white blood cell count of 27 and low-grade temperatures. Please
evaluate for abscess, and if there is a collection, please
drain.

COMPARISON: [**2195-2-4**].

PROCEDURE: The patient was placed supine on the CT table, and
initial axial MDCT images were obtained from the lung bases to
the pubic symphysis following the intravenous administration of
Optiray. Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were provided.

CONTRAST: Intravenous nonionic contrast was administered.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Since the
examination of [**2-4**], the degree of consolidation in the
right and left lower lobes has improved to some extent, as has
ground-glass opacity in the right middle lobe, although an area
of more dense atelectasis along the lateral aspect of the right
middle lobe with adjacent non-layering pleural effusion has
progressed. A right pleural effusion has increased. A left
pleural effusion is stable. The imaged portion of the heart and
pericardium appear within normal limits. Moderate ascites is
again present throughout the abdomen with peritoneal
enhancement, an unchanged finding. In the right mid abdomen, an
oblong collection with slightly more prominent peritoneal
enhancement measures 0.3 x 9.1 cm (2:36), slightly decreased in
size from [**2-4**], at which time it measured 1.6 x 9.3 cm. A
jejunostomy tube is in place in the left mid- abdomen, and
percutaneous gastrostomy tube is in place in the left upper
abdomen. Surgical staples are seen at the midline. The large and
small bowel loops are normal in caliber. The gallbladder is
distended to a similar degree as it was on [**2-4**].

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The uterus is
enlarged with a calcified fibroid at the fundus and with a
hypodense mass measuring 8.6 x 7.2 cm consistent with a
noncalcified fibroid. Posterior to the uterus, a pocket of fluid
measuring 7.4 x 2.8 cm, also with peritoneal enhancement, has
decreased in size slightly from [**2-4**], at which time it
measured 3.4 x 8.3 cm. A small focus of gas and fluid anterior
to the uterus on sagittal images is shown to represent the
fundus of the bladder and could be consistent with recent Foley
catheter placement. There are no pathologically enlarged
inguinal or pelvic lymph nodes.

BONE WINDOWS: Bone windows show no lesions worrisome for osseous
metastatic disease.

IMPRESSION:

1. Unchanged moderate ascites with peritoneal enhancement and
slight decrease in size of two focal collections in the right
flank and deep pelvis.

2. Distended gallbladder, an unchanged finding. Ultrasound could
be performed for further evaluation if there are referable
symptoms.

3. Worsening right pleural effusion and stable left pleural
effusion.

4. Improved pulmonary consolidation, but progression of right
middle lobe atelectasis with adjacent loculated effusion.

5. Fibroid uterus.

PROCEDURE: Despite a slight decrease in size of focal
collections in the pelvis and right flank, due to clinical
concern for untreated infection, aspiration of a right flank
collection was requested. The risks and benefits of the
procedure were explained to the patient, and written informed
consent was obtained. A pre-procedure timeout was performed
using two patient identifiers. After local anesthesia with 7 cc
of 1% lidocaine, and under direct CT guidance, a 4.5 French [**Last Name (un) 11097**]
catheter was advanced into the collection. However, no fluid
could be aspirated despite confirmation of the needle tip in the
collection. Therefore, a second pass was made into a slightly
more superior portion of the collection with similar results.
Following this, a 0.018 wire was advanced via the [**Last Name (un) 11097**] catheter
into the collection and the [**Last Name (un) 11097**] system was exchanged for a 4.5
French Microaccess catheter. Despite manipulation of the wire
and catheter within the collection, only approximately 1 cc of
serosanguineous material could be aspirated. Therefore, a 0.038
[**Last Name (un) 7648**] wire was advanced via the Microaccess catheter into the
collection and manipulated to achieve possible lysis of
loculations. The 4.5 French [**Last Name (un) 11097**] catheter was again placed over
the 0.038 wire and approximately 5 cc of serosanguineous
material was then aspirated, capped and sent to microbiology.
The wire and the [**Last Name (un) 11097**] catheter were removed. Post-procedural
scanning showed no evidence of complications at the procedural
site. The patient tolerated the procedure well, with no
complications evident at the time of the procedure, and remained
stable throughout her stay in the CT suite.

The attending radiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], was present and
supervising throughout, and performed portions of the procedure.

IMPRESSION: Technically successful access of a right flank
collection which yielded only 5 cc of serosanguineous material.
Sample sent to microbiology.
