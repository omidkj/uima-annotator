Admission Date:  [**2152-4-10**]     Discharge Date:  [**2152-4-19**]

Date of Birth:   [**2078-9-11**]     Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Respiratory distress.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 73-year-old female
with a history of coronary artery disease, status post
anterior wall myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock in
[**Month (only) 956**] of this year.  At that time, the patient had
underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and
stent of her left anterior descending with an ejection
fraction of 25% at [**Hospital3 **] Hospital.  She had required
balloon pump and pressors for cardiogenic shock and had been
transferred to the [**Hospital6 256**] post
catheterization for further evaluation.  She was discharged
on [**3-22**] on medical therapy to a Rehabilitation facility.
Patient had been discharged from the Rehabilitation facility
and was doing well at home until the morning of admission,
when she was found to be in respiratory distress by her
husband.  She was given three sublingual nitroglycerin
tablets without relief.  EMS was called.

On arrival, EMS found the patient to be pale in severe
respiratory distress with electrocardiogram demonstrating
complete heart block with junctional bradycardia at 20 beats
per minute.  The patient was given atropine times three and
external pacing was initiated.  The patient was intubated on
route to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital.  She was taken immediately to the
catheterization laboratory for acute cardiogenic shock.  In
the catheterization laboratory there, intraaortic balloon
pump and transvenous pacemaker were placed.  Her left heart
catheterization demonstrated total occlusion of the left
anterior descending which was stented.  In addition,
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was completed
on a D1 lesion with a 40% residual stenosis.  The patient
remained pacer and balloon dependent and was transferred to
the [**Hospital6 256**] for further
management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Hypercholesterolemia.
3.  Hypothyroidism.
4.  Diabetes mellitus Type II.  Controlled on oral agents.
5.  Coronary artery disease, status post anterior wall
    myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock in [**Month (only) 956**]
    of [**2152**].

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Lescol 20 mg po q.d., Levoxyl 175 mcg
po q.d., Metoprolol, Cardia, Demadex, potassium and Avandia 4
mg po q.d.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Intravenous heparin drip, Aggrastat
drip, dopamine drip, aspirin and Plavix.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with her husband and is
retired, she does not smoke or drink.  She has four children
near by.  The patient is full code.

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, the patient's
temperature was 100.4 degrees.  Heart rate was 70 and paced.
Blood pressure was 110/70.  Respiratory rate was 14-16.  Her
initial vent settings were assist controlled 700 x 14 with a
FIO2 of 50%, PEEP of 5.  In general, she is a well-nourished
white female intubated, not awake, and alert and
appropriately responding, via nodding and hand gestures.  Her
pupils were reactive.  Her sclera are anicteric.  Her
extraocular movements are intact.  She is intubated with
nasal packing secondary to significant epistaxis.  Trachea is
midline.  There is no lymphadenopathy.  Differential to
assess jugular venous distention secondary to body habitus.
Her lungs showed decreased breath sounds at the bases with
crackles bilaterally.  The heart is regular, S1, S2, without
murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen is soft and nontender
with normal active bowel sounds.  There is no rebound or
guarding.  There is no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities are
warm with 2+ pulses and trace of bilateral edema in the lower
extremities.
ADMISSION LABORATORIES:  CBC shows a white count of 15,
hematocrit of 31, platelets of 235,000.  Chem-7 showed sodium
136, potassium 4.5, chloride 103, bicarbonate 18, BUN 50,
creatinine 1.5, glucose 201.  Initial troponin was 25.5.  CKs
initially 630 with an MB of 48.  Peak CK was 1220.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Coronary
Care Unit with acute cardiogenic shock, status post second
myocardial infarction in two months.  She was initially
requiring intraaortic balloon pump and pressor support, but
gradually weaned off these.  Post myocardial infarction
course was notable for the following:

1.  Arrhythmia:  The patient initially presented with
complete heart block and junctional escape requiring
placement of transcutaneous pacing wire.  Post myocardial
infarction course was also notable for episodes of
nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, as well as paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.  For
these, temporary pacing wire was eventually replaced on [**4-17**]
with implantation of GEM3AT duel chamber implantable
cardioverter defibrillator with atrial and ventricular
therapies.  Secondary to this device, it was felt that she
could be discontinued on amiodarone.

2.  Anemia.  The patient was anemic on admission requiring
two units of transfusion with packed red blood cells.  She
had significant epistaxis on admission, and later had OB
positive stools throughout her course while on
anticoagulation.  Anticoagulation was discontinued on [**2152-4-18**]
status post implantation of the GEM3 ICD.  The patient's
hematocrit remained stable through the remainder of her
hospital course.  It was felt that she will need a further
work-up, likely including gastrointestinal work-up, at a
later date, once further out from her myocardial infarction.
Until that time, it was felt that the risks of
anticoagulation outweighed their benefit at this point.
However, should gastrointestinal work-up be pursued and be
negative in the future, she would be a candidate for
anticoagulation given her few episodes of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation and also her apical akinesis.

3.  On [**2152-4-11**], the patient's PA saturation was noted to be
elevated at 88%.  This was concerning for possible
ventricular septal defect in the setting of recent myocardial
infarction.  For this, the patient underwent an oxygen
saturation run which demonstrated consistently elevated PA 02
saturations at 80% throughout the right-sided [**Doctor Last Name 1754**] of her
heart and into the pulmonary artery.  Moreover,
echocardiogram demonstrated no evidence for SVD.
