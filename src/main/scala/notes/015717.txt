IMAGING:
[**9-6**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) **]: No ligamentous injury or signs of bony injury.
[**9-6**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) **]: Transverse fracture which appears to extend
through pedicles (Chance fracture). CT lumbar spine can help for
better assessment as clinically indicated. Edema in sacrum
indicates a fracture.
[**9-6**] CT R knee/prox tibia: Comminuted intraarticular fracture of
the proximal tibia with fracture lines extending into the medial
and lateral tibial plateaus (400, 45 and 50). The dominant
fracture line is transverse through the metaphysis and likely
involves the insertion of the patellar tendon. There is mild
impaction and postero-lateral displacement of the distal
fragment.Minimally displaced fracture of the proximal fibula
(401b, 19). Hemorrhagic knee effusion. Severe degenerative
changes and diffuse osteopenia.
[**9-6**] am CXR: The assessment of the lung films reveals no
interval development of new abnormalities besides the right
middle lobe atelectasis that is apparently new. Bilateral small
pleural effusions are better appreciated on the CT torso.
[**9-6**] pm CXR: No change from [**2136-9-6**]. Left basilar opacity is
likely
atelectasis, but supervening infection cannot be excluded.
[**9-8**]: pCXR no clear infiltrate
[**9-9**]: No pneumothorax is identified on the left. There are
bilateral
pleural effusions. There is increased pulmonary vascular
redistribution and alveolar infiltrates, predominantly in the
right lower lobe. There is dense retrocardiac opacity. The
overall impression is that of worsened fluid status.
[**9-10**] CXR: No evidence of pneumothorax. There is evidence of
elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Mild haziness of the lower
zones is consistent with small bilateral pleural effusions and
compressive atelectasis at the bases.
[**9-11**] CXR: Minimal left basal atelectasis. There is no evidence
of pneumothorax. The subtle parenchymal changes at the right
lung bases are constant.
[**9-13**] CXR: Unchanged bilateral parenchymal opacities, combined to
mild-to-moderate right pleural effusion and areas of bilateral
basal atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
On presentation, the OSH CT demonstrated a left retroperitoneal
hematoma with evidence of active extravasation. He was actively
resuscitated in the ED with 7u pRBC, 4u FFP and several liters
crystalloid and taken to IR for embolization. Blush was seen at
the inferior pole of the left kidney and was embolized at that
time.  He was transferred to the trauma ICU afterwards for close
monitoring.

His ICU course as follows:

N: He was intubated and weaned off sedation. He was following
commands and responding appropriately. His pain was controlled
with narcotics.

CV: He had short runs of ventricular tachycardia and on HD2 he
went into afib w/ RVR. He was started on an Amiodarone gtt and
he converted to sinus on HD 3. During that time, he was on some
neo, which was weaned off.

Pulm: He was intubated and sedated. he had a left chest tube in
place to suction for him  hemothorax. It was placed to water
seal. He had multiple rib fractures

GI: He was NPO and on IV fluids. He had an OGT in place
initially which was later removed, a Dobbhoff was placed and
tube feedings started.

GU: His urine output was monitored closely with Foley catheter
in place.

Heme: He required intermittent blood transfusions with packed
cells during his ICU stay. On HD 2, he was transfused 1u pRBC
for a hct of 24, which had decreased from 33. He also received
albumin and FFP.

MSK: He had multiple fractures in his ribs, spine, pelvis, and
RLE. His pelvic fractures were non-operative and he was weight
bearing as tolerated. However, he was on log roll precautions
for his L1 chance fracture. He underwent repair of his distal
right lower extremity fractures on [**9-11**] by Orthopedics and his
spine fracture was repaired by Orthopedic Spine Surgery on [**9-12**].

Once stabilized in the ICU he was transferred to the floor. He
was noted with rapid afib with hypotension within the first 24
hours after leaving the ICU. He was given several doses of IV
Lopressor which was effective. His daily scheduled beta blockers
were subsequently adjusted. His Afib was felt secondary to fluid
volume overload for which he received diuresis with IV Lasix
for. Since this initial episode of afib his heart rate has range
in 70-80's. At home he takes Metoprolol XL 100 mg twice a day -
his home dose was restarted at a lower dose to determine if his
blood pressure remains stable. Once at rehab and with continued
stable blood pressures his home regimen should be resumed.

He underwent a Swallow evaluation at bedside and passed allowing
his diet to be upgraded to regular with thin liquids. The
Dobbhoff was removed and tube feedings stopped. Supplements with
Ensure were initiated as well.

His home medications were resumed.

His Foley was removed on HD#13 and he is voiding without any
difficulties.

He was evaluated by Physical and Occupational therapy and being
recommended for rehab after his acute hospital stay.
