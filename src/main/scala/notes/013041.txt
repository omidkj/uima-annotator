Staph aureus Screen (Final [**2180-5-4**]):
      STAPH AUREUS COAG +.    RARE GROWTH.
Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during prolonged
therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates
may be warranted. This isolate is presumed to be resistant to
clindamycin based on the detection of inducible resistance .
