Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Chief Complaint:
s/p fall, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 61875**] is an 82 year old Portugese-speaking man admitted
on [**2174-6-6**] with shortness of breath and abdominal pain. He was
transferred here intubated and was found to have a WBC of 194k
and have hyperkalemia. He had a fever to 101.4 and was extubated
on [**6-8**]. CTA to assess for PE was negative.
.
Translated by the [**Hospital1 18**] portugese translator, he says that he
feels much better. He says that he originally fell while he was
trying to walk, but that he doesn??????t walk very much because he
gets ??????lightheaded?????? or ??????dizzy?????? but he could not clarify further.
He kept referring to ??????bronchitis?????? and that he worked in a plant
with a lot of dust exposure. Today he feels that he is not
having trouble breathing. His right arm swelling is new for him.
He expects his daughter to arrive soon who can explain more.

[**6-8**] CTA of Chest:
1) No pulmonary embolism.
2) Bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis of the right
upper and both lower lobes. Mediastinal and left hilar
lymphadenopathy.
3) Splenomegaly, with small amount of adjacent free fluid.

Echo [**6-7**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity   size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular   wall motion is normal.
Right ventricular chamber size is mildly dilated with   mild
free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No  aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally  normal. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is   seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is a   small circumferential pericardial effusion without
evidence of hemodynamic   compromise.

IMPRESSION: Preserved global and regional biventricular systolic
function.   Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild right
ventricular cavity   enlargement with free wall hypokinesis.
Small circumferential pericardial   effusion without hemodynamic
compromise.

Based on [**2166**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings   indicate a low risk (prophylaxis not
recommended). Clinical decisions   regarding the need for
prophylaxis should be based on clinical and   echocardiographic
data.

[**2174-6-12**]: Abdominal/Pelvis CT:
1. No evidence of lymphoma recurrence within the abdomen and
pelvis.
2. Enlarged lymph, in the part of cardiac region, large
bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left with
compressive atelectasis again seen. These are unchanged from
prior CTA obtained [**2174-6-8**].
3. 11.3 x 5.1 cm rectus sheath hematoma.
4. Splenomegaly.
5. Bilateral inguinal hernias.

ECG: Atrial fibrillation
Multifocal atrial rhythm
Since previous tracing of [**2174-6-7**], irregular supraventricular
rhythm seen

[**2174-6-13**] Cytology PLEURAL FLUID pending

CXR [**6-14**]: Compared with [**2174-6-13**] there is considerable interval
clearing of the pulmonary edema and the pulmonary vascular
engorgement. Residual right pleural effusion is seen causing
haziness at the right base. The lungs are better aerated.

Flow cytometry on peripheral blood:
The following tests (antibodies) were performed:  HLA-DR, FMC-7,
Kappa, Lambda, and CD antigens 3, 5, 10, 19, 20, 23, 45.

RESULTS:
Three-color gating is performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to
optimize lymphocyte yield.

Abnormal/lymphoma cells comprise 90% of total gated events.

B-cells demonstrate a monoclonal kappa light chain restricted
population.  They co-express pan-B cell markers CD19, 20
(bright) along with CD 23 and FMC7.  They do not express any
other characteristic antigens including CD10 or CD5.

T-cells express mature lineage antigens.

INTERPRETATION Immunophenotypic findings consistent with
involvement by: a kappa-restricted B-cell lymphoproliferative
disorder.

Cytogenetics (pending).


Brief Hospital Course:
82 year old man with CLL, COPD, HTN admitted s/p fall 3 days
prior to admission

1) Pulmonary: pt arrived from OSH intubated for tachypnea ?lung
collapse and airway protection per ED physician who evaluated pt
at [**Hospital3 15402**].  Pt has been fluid overloaded with anasarca and
right pleural effusion.  Thoracentesis done [**6-13**] around 2pm
which showed a transudative process consistent with CHF.  After
diuresis and thoracentesis, patient's respiratory status much
improved.

2) ID: s/p 10days of ceftriaxone/azithro/clinda for pneumonia.
Started on keflex for possible right wound infection, although
superficial wound culture was negative.  Pt still occasionally
spikes fevers but blood, urine and pleural fluid cultures have
been negative.  We feel that his intermittent fevers are due to
his leukemia.

3) Onc: Pt has chronic lymphocytic leukemia with extremely
elevated white blood count.  Pt was temporarily started on
allopurinol for possible tumor lysis, but this was discontinued.
The patient is noted to have an enlarged spleen.  Heme onc was
consulted, but they felt no acute interventions were indicated.
Abd/pelvis ct was performed for staging. Will f/u with Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 1557**] as outpt on [**7-18**].

4) Cardiovascular:
a) rhythm: intermittently tachycardic, EP curbside suggested
resolving systemic issues.  We considered adding beta-blockade
although there is some quetion of whether he also is in
wenckebach [**Date range (1) 61876**] although official ekg read as afib w/
multifocal atrial rhythm.

b) pump: echo shows normal ef, decreased E/A ratio == dialstolic
heart failure, pulmonary hypertension. Pulm effusions may in
part be due to CHF.

5) Neuro: history of parkinsons disease, continue cinemet.

6) F/E/N: Continue cardiac/salt-restricted diet. Creatinine is
1-1.1 at baseline.
We restarted home dose of lasix 40mg for [**6-14**] AM but increased
it to 60mg qd.  This should be decreased as an outpatient.
Please keep him in/out even, increase lasix as needed.

7) PPX: pneumoboots, heparin sc.
