ablation and AICD upgrade [**11-7**], dyslipidemia, and HTN who was
hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**10-27**] after his AICD fired found to be
consistent with monomorphic VT and underwent VT ablation on
[**10-29**]. At that time, the patient was taken to [**Hospital3 3583**]

8 seconds to 1.2 minutes. Almost all of the episodes were pace

his blood pressure at home and noted that his HR wavered between
80-148 bpm which prompted him to come to the ED.

At [**Hospital1 34**] he was given an amiodarone bolus of 150mg followed by an
amiodarone drip.

ablation and AICD upgrade [**11-7**], dyslipidemia, and HTN s/p
recent ablation on [**10-29**] presented with 4 episodes of VT.
Interrogation of his pacer confirmed VT.  He was initially on
amiodarone, which was held for EP study/ablation.  A total of 11
foci were found and ablated using a 4mm ablation catheter for a
total of 479 seconds.  He did have some ventricular ectopy
following ablation and so was reloaded on amiodarone and
discharged on it, with plan for serial pfts, lfts.  He was
discharged to cardiology, pcp [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
