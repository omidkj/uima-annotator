UA: normal.

ECHO [**2-11**]: Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is mild global left
ventricular hypokinesis. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic  Hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


IMPRESSION: Mild global left ventricular hypokinesis c/w diffuse
process
(tocxin, metabolic, multivessel CAD, etc.). Moderate mitral
regurgiattion. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild
aortic regurgitation.

CXR: : Left lower lobe opacity possibly representing atelectasis
or
pneumonia, Follow up PA and lateral study would be helpful in
further
evaluating this area.

[**2199-2-22**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Small left effusion. Hyperinflated
lungs. Left lower lobe atelectasis/consolidation.


Brief Hospital Course:
59y/o F with severe COPD on home O2 of 4L NC, DM2, Asthma,
Depression, recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] and intubated
([**Date range (2) 92815**]) for COPD exacerbation, discharged to [**Hospital1 1099**] then home, came in with increased sputum production,
cough and SOB.
.
# COPD/hypercarbic respiratory failure: In the ED, she was found
to be in respiratory distress, hypercarbic respiratory failure
with intubation on [**2-10**] in am.  Nasal aspirate notable for RSV
positive, neg dfa for other resp viruses. She was given
Azithromycin 500mg x1 then 250mg for 4 days. She was treated for
COPD exacerbation initially, but her ICU course was complicated.
 The primary complications included 1) Ventilator-associated PNA
and 2) paroxyms of atrial flutter while intubated.  She was
treated with Zosyn/Vanc for the PNA, and was initially
heparinized for A flutter and put on amiodarone instead of
diltiazem.  Her long-acting diltiazem was originally converted
to short acting b/c it could be crushed; this was felt to have
precipitated her atrial flutter thus she was put on amiodarone.
She progressively improved and was extubated [**2-21**]; this was in
the setting of many prior failed attempts to wean PS.  She
subsequently improved and was able to be extubated.  Pt was
transfered to the floor for further managment. The pt continued
to improved on the floor and came back to her baseline O2
requirement of 1-2L, and her prednisone was tapered slowly off.
.
## Tachycardia: Pt has history of MAT and has been on dilt.
During intubation, Dilt CR was changed to qid dosing.  The pt
was receiving frequent nebulizers, in addition, she was found to
be auto-peeping.  She developed a rapid, regular, narrow complex
tachycardia that was found to have underlying fib waves (atrial
fibrillation).  Diltiazem was pushed IV x 2 overnight and an
additional PO dose of 30 was given.  Initially, with
tachycardias c/w MAT, BP was stable, however, at a rate of 150,
BP began to decrease such that MAP's were in the 50's.  After
de-recruitment with ventilator detachment, the pt's BP returned.
Albuterol was held and the pt was started on Amiodarone instead
of Diltiazem for rate control. On the floor, she subsequently
had one more episode of hypotension with tachycardia in the
context of getting up for the first time. She responded well to
fluids and had no other hypotensive events. Amiodarone was
switched back to dilt over concern for lung toxicity given her
pre-existing lung disease. However, on [**2-26**] she had an episode
of atrial flutter for about 45 minutes and spontaneously
converted back to normal rhythm. An EP consult was requested for
management of her arrhythmia, and they recommended staying off
amiodarone and increasing the dose of dilt. This was deferred
over concern for her low EF seen on echo [**2-12**], however, and a
repeat echo was obtained, which still showed a depressed EF at
30-40%. Given that the etiology of this was unclear, cardiology
recommended a pMIBI which showed mild reversible defects on the
anterior and lateral walls. Because this likely indicates 3VD
given involvement of 2 distributions and the defects are mild,
cardiology did not recommend urgent cath, as this may be
deferred to the outpatient setting if the patient so desires.
The patient should follow up with a cardiologist and has an
appointment with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
.
## Anemia:  Low iron with normal TIBC and low normal Ferritin.
Component of anemia of chronic disease and iron deficiency. Iron
supplements as outpatient. However intially had hct drop 5
points from baseline most likely in the context of fluid
resuscitation for hypotension. Subsequently recovered without
transfusion and came back to baseline.
.
## Peripheral fluid overload: The patient was on 20mg PO Lasix
QD at home started during last admission. However, by [**2-24**], she
was autodiuresing and did not require any further Lasix. By day
of discharge, she was maintaining approximately even net fluid
balance on her own with baseline O2 sat in the mid-90s on 1-2L
O2 NC.
.
## DM2: Diabetes, usually controlled with diet, started on
Glyburide 1.25mg [**Hospital1 **] during last admission, last hemoglobin A1c
6.5. On FS QID while on steroids. Covered with ISSC while on
steroids, finger sticks were under control.
.
## Depression, Anxiety: Continue Seroquel, Trazadone, and Zoloft
at out-patient dose
