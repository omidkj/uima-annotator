He is on TPN. As his tumor has been responding to chemo, he has
has been able to eat more and more. He has G tube, has trouble
tolerating TF (increased residual) at times.
He needs intensive PT. His medical issues do not include his
extremeties. He is just incredibly deconditioned and weak

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 745**] is a 60 year old male with a history of invasive
squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and tongue who
intitially presented on [**2128-8-6**] after a syncopal episode at home
when standing from sitting position.  He fell to the ground
hitting his hands and knees.  There was no head trauma or loss
of consciousness.   There was no witnessed seizure like
activity.  There was no confusion or disorientation.  He felt
weak and shakey after he stood back up. Further history revealed
poor PO intake over the preceding few weeks since prior
discharge from the hospital on [**2128-7-28**].  It was during that
hospitalization that his cancer was diagnosed.

In the ED his initial vitals were T: 98.4, HR: 100, BP: 92/64,
RR: 17, O2: 96% room air. Orthostatics were not checked. He had
a CXR which showed hyperinflation but no acute cardiopulmonary
abnormalities and multiple compression fractures of vertebrae.
He had a CT of the head which was negative for acute process.
Knee films were negative for fracture or dislocation.  He
received aspirin 325 mg x1 and morphine 4 mg IV.  He was
admitted to the cardiology service given syncope and borderline
elevated troponins (0.5).

While on the cardiology service he was initially started on IVF
for hydration out of concern that his syncopal episode was
related to his poor PO intake and dehydration.  He was ruled out
for myocardial infarction and transferred to the oncology
service.  Given his poor oral intake he underwent PEG placement
on [**2128-8-12**].  He ws started on dexamethasone in preparation for
starting chemotherapy on [**2128-8-12**].  Also on [**2128-8-12**] the patient
was noted to complain of left lower quadrant abdominal pain with
hematuria.  He underwent CT of the abdomen and pelvis which did
not reveal etiology of his abdominal pain but did show debris in
the right lower lobe bronchus and right lower lobe air space
disease most likely atelectasis with small
bilateral pleural effusions. On [**2128-8-13**] he was started on a
morphine PCA for pain control secondary to jaw and back pain.
Per his wife in this setting he became more somnolent.
Overnight on [**2128-8-14**] he was noted to develop a new 2L oxygen
requirement.  He desaturated to 83-84% off oxygen.  CXR
performed in this setting was concerning for bilateral pleural
effusions and atelectasis.  He was treated with IV lasix with
good urine output but no improvement in his oxygenation status.
On the morning of [**2128-8-15**] he was noted to be requiring higher
levels of facemask oxygen up to 10L.  He was also noted to be
hypotensive in the high 80s systolic.  He underwent emergent CTA
which was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed right lower
lobe partial collapse, debris in the right lobe bronchus and
bilateral pleural effusions.

On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] he continues to have significant oxygen
requirement and complained of being short of breath.  Per
oncology notes he was also complaining of left sided chest pain
but he did not note this to ICU team.  Anesthesia and ENT were
emergently consulted given rapidly rising oxygen requirement and
lack of ability to orally intubate.  Decision was made to
proceed with nasotracheal intubation which proceded without
complication.  Periprocedure he was been on propofol with
decrease in his blood pressures to the 70s systolic requiring
levophed.

Past Medical History:
- Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the oropharynx and tongue
diagnosed in [**2128-7-17**].  Stage [**Doctor First Name 690**] disease, likely
non-resectable.  Primary oncologist is Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].  Now s/p
PEG tube for decreased PO intake secondary to pain and limited
mobility of oropharynx.
- Hypertension
- Hyperlipidemia

Diverticulitis s/p ileostomy [**2127-10-17**] (At [**Hospital1 **])
Depression
GERD


Social History:

sudden cardiac death; otherwise non-contributory.

Pertinent Results:
[**8-10**] CT Neck/Chest for re-staging:
Interval enlargement of a hyper-enhancing soft tissue mass in
the right oral cavity with a contiguous hyper-enhancing lesion
in the right lateral
oropharyngeal wall and supraglottic walls, the latter with a new
area of
central low density which may represent necrosis.

[**8-12**] CT abd/pelvis
1. Small locules of free air adjacent to the stomach and
anterior to the
ventral aspect of the liver likely attributed to recent G-tube
placement. No evidence of hemorrhage or intra-abdominal or
pelvic fluid collection.
2. Right lower lobe air space disease most likely atelectasis
with small
bilateral pleural effusions. Superimposed infection not
excluded.
3. Debris/mucoid impaction fills right lower lobe bronchi. This
may be from secretions or aspiration.

[**8-15**] CTA Chest
1. No pulmonary embolus or acute aortic abnormality.
2. Interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on
the right
and small on the left.
3. Considerable increased consolidation of the right lower lobe,
with
scattered ground glass opacities in other lobes bilaterally,
suggesting
pneumonia.
4. Unchanged right anterior fifth rib fracture and multilevel
thoracic
vertebral body compression deformities.

[**8-23**] CXR
There is a tracheostomy tube with tip 4.2 cm above the carina.
Bilateral pleural effusions and increased interstitial and
alveolar markings are again seen suggesting fluid overload. An
underlying infectious infiltrate cannot be excluded.
