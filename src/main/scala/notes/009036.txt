History of Present Illness:
69yo F with ESRD on HD, CAD, DM, HTN, CHF (EF 60-70%, 3+ MR),
who had HD on Friday and then came to ED today with c/o darker
stools. She went to HD on Friday and was told that her hct was
lower but did not recieve a tranfusion. This mornign she awoke
and had a BM which was dark and states there was blood in his
stool but could not provide mroe informaiton than that.
+LH/dizziness at all times. She said that there were multiple
dark sotols over the last several weeks. She deneis any chest
pain but did admit to chest pressure on the left side without
radiation which was reilieved with one ntg in the ED. No abd
pain. good appetite yesterday but none today; some nausea.
.
During her admission [**2153-12-26**], the pt received an EGD which
demonstrated GAVE (watermelon stomach) s/p APC (Argon Laser).
She received 2units of PRBCs during the previous admission. The
pt also has a history of colonic polyps from c-scope in [**2152**] s/p
polypectomy.
.
In the ED, 98.3, 112, 119/55, 16, 100% RA. Received 2 u PRBCS
for Hct drop to 22. Rectal dark brown/black stool G+, NG lavage
blood tinged, mild [**Year (4 digits) 13223**] and hypotension, also transient
EKG change w/ ST depression, given 1L IVF, txn'ed 2u RBC (1st
unit [**Unit Number **] mins, second unit over 2 hrs). First set of CE's
negative.
.
Admitted to MICU for further monitoring of hct in setting of
likely GIB. Pt was assessed in the MICU at 5 15. Pt extremly
conversant and wihtout any complaints


Past Medical History:
1. Type 2 diabetes mellitus complicated by nephropathy and
neuropathy.
2. ESRD on HD since [**November 2153**]
3. CAD: suspected by stress test in [**2153-5-22**], not reperfused.
4. CHF: TTE on [**2153-11-1**]. It showed a LVEF of 60 to 70% with 3+
MR and 2+ TR.
5. Anemia: Felt to be multifactorial from ESRD and also guiac
positive. Pt had a colonoscopy on [**2153-8-7**] significant for two
nonbleeding polyps in the sigmoid colon. She also had an EGD on
the same date which was significant for erythema, edema, and
erosion in the antrum compatible with gastritis in addition to
erythema in the proximal bulb compatible with duodenitis. No
bleeding was noted.  EGD has since demonstated GAVE on 2'[**53**].
6. Occult GI bleed [**7-/2153**] with studies as above

Imaging:
EGD [**2154-1-10**]:
Esophagus: Normal mucosa.
Stomach: Linear streaks of erythema of the mucosa with contact
bleeding and in a watermelon distribution was noted in the
antrum. These findings are compatible with GAVE. An Argon-Plasma

Coagulator was applied for hemostasis successfully.
Duodenum: Normal mucosa was noted from the duodenum to the
proximal jejunum. There were no blood or any bleeding lesions.
Impression: Erythema in the antrum compatible with GAVE s/p APC

.
EGD [**2154-1-22**]:
Impression: Erythema and congestion in the duodenal bulb
consistent with duodenitis. Erythema and congestion in the
antrum compatible with GAVE
Small angioectasias in the jejunum without evidence of bleeding

Recommendations: Protonix 40 mg Twice daily
Capsule endoscopy
.
Colonoscopy [**2154-1-22**]:
Impression: Scant stool mixed in with prep liquid in the colon
Findings do not explain bleeding.
Recommendations: Source of bleeding not identified, recommend
capsule endoscopy
.
ECG: Poor baseline. NSR @89 w/borderline QTC, nl axis. Compared
w/priors, ST depression in inferolateral distribution has
changed to .5mm ST elevation in aVL, 1mm ST elevation in V2-V6,
concering for anterolateral ischemia.
.
CXR [**2154-2-17**]: An endotracheal tube is present, with the tip in
the proximal right main stem bronchus. Right internal jugular
dialysis catheter is unchanged in position. The heart is normal
in size. There are new bilateral central alveolar opacities as
well as peripheral septal lines, consistent with pulmonary
edema.
Findings communicated by telephone to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on
[**2154-2-17**].
.
CXR [**2154-2-18**]: Moderately severe pulmonary edema has improved
since 6:30 p.m. on [**1-28**]. Heart size is normal and mediastinal
vasculature is no longer distended. Little if any pleural
effusion is present. ET tube is in standard placement. Tip of a
right supraclavicular dual channel central venous line project
over
the SVC. No pneumothorax.
.
CXR [**2154-2-20**]: There is interval resolution of the pulmonary
edema. A right-sided central venous catheter is seen with its
tip in the
