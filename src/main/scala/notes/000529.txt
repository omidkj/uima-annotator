Hypoxia

History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo M with COPD, PAF, dementia, with a recently
diagnosed bilateral PNA at nursing home who presents with
hypoxia. He was started on levofloxacin at the NH, changed to
CTX today. The pt was initially hypoxic to 80's on RA, placed on
4L NC, desated again to 80's, and then was placed on NRB satting
91% at NH.
.
In the ED the pts vitals were: T98 HR 110 BP 108/72 RR 20-26 Sat
95-100% on NRB. The pt was noted to have rhonchi on exam, rales
left base, otherwise speaking in short sentences, somewhat
labored breathing, sinus tachy. CXR showed dense confluent
airspace opacities, air bronchograms, butterfly distribution, no
significant cardiac enlargement, no vascular congestion. He
received 1 L NS, Ceftaz, Clindamycin, and Vanc in the ED. In
addition, he was noted to have an NSTEMI with CK 471, MBI 7.9,
and Tpn T 1.88. BNP was 25,131. His EKG however had no clear
changes. He was given ASA but no BB.

Past Medical History:

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the report of the prior study (images
not
available) of [**2196-1-25**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size. No
resting LVOT
gradient. No VSD.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Normal RV systolic
function.
Paradoxic septal motion consistent with conduction
abnormality/ventricular
pacing.

AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic sinus.

AORTIC VALVE: ?# aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened aortic
valve
leaflets. No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular
calcification. Mild (1+) MR. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of MR
may be significantly UNDERestimated.]

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: No PS.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.


Conclusions:
Sub-optimal image quality. The left atrium is normal in size.
There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
The [**Year (4 digits) **]
wall appears hypokinetic in some views (limited by poor image
quality).
Overall LVEF is probably preserved/mildly reduced. There is no
ventricular
septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Right
ventricular systolic function is normal. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at
the sinus level. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic
valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing,
the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.]
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of
[**2196-1-25**], the [**Year (4 digits) **] wall now appears hypokinetic. If
clinically indicated, a
repeat study with echo contrast (Definity) may better
characterize
regional/global LV systolic function.
.
CXR:
There are dense, confluent air space
opacities, with prominent air bronchograms, involving both
parahilar regions
and the medial aspect of the right lung base, in a somewhat
"butterfly"
distribution.  However, there is no significant cardiac
enlargement and no
pleural effusion or gross pulmonary vascular congestion is
identified.  There
are atherosclerotic changes involving the thoracic aorta.

IMPRESSION:  Multifocal air space process with overall
appearance more
suggestive of extensive pneumonic consolidation than pulmonary
edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 40370**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with COPD, PAF, dementia,
with a recently diagnosed bilateral PNA at nursing home who
presents with hypoxia and pneumonia vs. pulmonary edema and
found to have an NSTEMI.
.
1. Hypoxia: The patient's chest film findings were more
consistent with pneumonia than pulmonary edema. However, both
infection and heart failure were considered as etiologies for
his hypoxia. He initially required an non-rebreather for
adequate oxygenation.  He was given ceftriaxone and vancomycin
the emergency room and once in the MICU he was converted to
vancomycin and zosyn for broader coverage given his continued
hypoxia and hypotension.  He slowly improved and was weened down
to 4L NC.  Given his initially hypotension, he was given many
boluses of IVF and eventually developed pulmonary edema.  This
was treated with furosemide with good resolution. He was
discharged with a continued oxygen requirement of 3L nasal
cannula with oxygen saturation in the mid-90s%. Subsequent doses
of furosemide were not found to improve his oxygenation and
indeed may run the risk of dehydrating him. His hypoxia is
likely to resolve only as the pneumonia resolves. The patient
also was started on standing ipratropium nebulizer to improve
his respiratory status.
.
2. Pneumonia: As stated above, the patient was treated with
broad spectrum antibiotics on admission and in the ICU. His
blood cultures were negative, h
