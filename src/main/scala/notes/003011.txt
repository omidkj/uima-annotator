Pertinent Results:
 CT A/P [**5-25**] -
1. Marked wall edema of long segment of jejunum consistent with
areas of
mucosal hyperemia and some smaller areas suggesting relative
lack of mucosal enhancement, highly concerning for ischemia.
Infectious or inflammatory etiologies are in the differential,
but felt less likely. Surrounding perijejunal fat stranding.
Complex small amount of perihepatic and pelvic free fluid.
2. Right pleural effusion with mild enhancement of the adjacent
parietal
pleura may represent a chronic process; however, infection
cannot be excluded. Adjacent chronic atelectasis versus
infection (aspiration or pneumonia) should be considered.
3. Ectatic abdominal aorta.

[**2110-5-30**] KUB :
Diffusely dilated loops of large and small bowel likely
representing postoperative ileus. No evidence of any
intra-abdominal free
air.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 24770**] was evaluated by the Acute Care service in the
Emergency Room and his Abdominal CT was reviewed showing areas
if ischemic bowel along the jejunum. Based on his physical exam,
CT scan and elevated WBC of 16K, exploratory laparotomy was
recommended. He was transfused with 4 units of FFP as his INR
was 17.6 on admission and broad spectrum antibiotics were also
initiated.  After his INR decreased he was taken to the
Operating Room on [**2110-5-25**] and underwent an exploratory
laparotomy, small bowel resection and anterior enterostomy for
infarcted small bowel.  He tolerated the procedure well and
returned to the SICU in stable condition.  He maintained stable
hemodynamics and his pain was well controlled.

Following transfer to the Surgical floor his diet was advanced
on post op day #2 after his bowel function returned but
unfortunately he developed an ileus and returned to NPO.  His
BUN and creatinine peaked at 56 and 2.3 after receiving Lasix
and he required increased IV fluids for 24 hours.  He gradually
trended down to 27 and 1.4 and maintained adequate hemodynamics.


As his bowel function returned, he was restarted on a liquid
diet and gradually advanced to regular.  His abdomen was soft
and his incision was healing well. He was seen by the Physical
Therapy service who recommended a short term rehab prior to
returning to his [**Hospital3 **].

Of note, his daily lasix was not resumed and his Coumadin for
atrial fibrillation may resume on [**2110-6-2**].
