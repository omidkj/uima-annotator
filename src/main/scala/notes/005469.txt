AMS

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

Thoracentesis [**2164-3-13**]


History of Present Illness:
43F with history of alcoholic hepatitis recent admission
[**Date range (1) 45338**] for GI bleed without clear source, subsequently
developing c. diff (treated with IV flagyl and PO vanc taper),
SBP, and HCAP (treated with vanc/cefepime).  She was discharged
to nursing home yesterday, and now is transferred back to [**Hospital1 18**]
for AMS
.
By reports of EMS at [**Hospital 38**] Rehab, was febrile to 101.7
today, had a pCXR which was c/w PNA, went into SVT with rate
220's, transferred to [**Hospital1 **], given adenosine and verapamil
and a total of 3L NS, given APAP and Vanc and Zosyn and was
transferred here. Here in the ED she is afebrile and altered,
unable to answer questions.  Labs showed WBC of 12.5, with
stable Hct and Plt.  Electrolytes wnl, with exception of low Mg
at 1.5 and low Ca at 7.4.  Trop was 0.02, INR 3.0.  CT a/p
obtained to look for toxic megacolon which was negative for
this.  However it did show large new right pleural effusion
leading to atelectasis/near collapse of right lower lobe.  Also
with
Multifocal ill defined opacities in the LUL may reflect
infectious process. Also with splenomegaly and varices
signialying portal hypertension.  Diagnositc paraentesis
deferred due to elevated INR and low Plt and past IR
requirement.  She was given IV flagyl for possibility of toxic
megacolon.  She also received another 1L NS in the ED. SBPs
remained stable in the 110s-120s and HRs in the 100s
.

IMAGING:
# CT OF THE CHEST [**2164-3-12**]:
The aorta is normal in caliber without evidence of dissection.
The pulmonary artery appears well opacified without evidence of
perfusion defects to suggest acute pulmonary embolus. Great
vessels are unremarkable. The heart is mildly enlarged without
pericardial effusion. There is a large right pleural effusion of
intermediate density measuring up to 30 Hounsfield units in
attenuation, new since [**2164-3-4**] exam. The right lower lobe is
largely collapsed with surrounding pleural effusion. Segmental
branches of the right lower lobe bronchus appear narrowed.
Patchy opacity in the left lung base likely represents
atelectasis. Multiple ill-defined opacities in the left upper
lobe are also noted. There are scattered mediastinal lymph
nodes, which do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
There is no hilar lymphadenopathy. No pathologically e
