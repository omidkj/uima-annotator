CHF presents syncope [**12-25**] GI bleeding
.
# UGIB.  Most recent outpatient Hct was 36.3, down to 26 on
admission.  Dark brown, guiaic + stool.  Received 1u pRBC from
ED.  Lactate 0.9.  Given history of recent NSAID and prophylaxis
ASA use, most likely upper GI source.  Higher risk given history
of bariatric surgery.  GI performed endoscopy at the time of
patient's arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and found non-bleeding erosion in
the stomach and duodenum.  Epi was injected, but study was
aborted given his hypoxia.  He subsequently received 3 more unit
