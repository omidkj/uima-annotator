Service:  CT Surgery

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Increasing shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a postoperative
admission.  She had been worked up for mitral valve and
tricuspid repair as well as an atrial septal defect closure
in preadmission testing and will be a direct admission
following surgery.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Hypothyroidism.
3.  Chronic atrial fibrillation.
4.  Atrial septal defect repair in [**2085**].
5.  History of subdural hematoma.
6.  Recent increase in shortness of breath and dyspnea on
exertion; echocardiogram and cardiac catheterization revealed
mitral valve disease as well as tricuspid regurgitation;
cardiac catheterization showed no significant coronary artery
disease with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50%, 3+
mitral regurgitation and a left-to-right shunt at the atrial
level; echocardiogram showed a left ventricular ejection
fraction of 55% with aortic valve thickening, no aortic
insufficiency, 4+ mitral regurgitation and 4+ tricuspid
regurgitation.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Mavik 4 mg p.o.q.d., digoxin 0.125
mg p.o.q.d., Levoxyl 112 mcg p.o.q.d., Coumadin 5 mg p.o.q.
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday and
2.5 mg q. Monday.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin, sulfa and Macrodantin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in an [**Hospital3 **]
facility.  She denies tobacco or alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination prior to
admission, the patient had a heart rate of 76, atrial
fibrillation, blood pressure 128/68, respiratory rate 20,
height 5'6" and weight 142 pounds.  General:  In no acute
distress.  Skin:  Warm and dry.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat:  No dental caries, good dentition, pupils equal,
round, and reactive to light.  Neck:  Supple, no
lymphadenopathy, no jugular venous distention.  Chest:  Clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:  Irregular,
III/VI murmur.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended,
positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing
or edema, no varicosities.  Neurologic:  Nonfocal exam.
Pulses:  Femoral 1+ bilaterally, dorsalis pedis 1+
bilaterally, posterior tibialis 1+ bilaterally and radial 1+
bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  Electrocardiogram showed first degree A-V
block with a long QT.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2106-5-17**], the patient was admitted
to the Operating Room.  Please see the operative report for
full details and summary.  She had a mitral valve repair with
a #28 annuloplasty band, tricuspid valve repair with a #32
annuloplasty band and primary closure of her atrial septal
defect.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Her
bypass time was 98 minutes, crossclamp time 52 minutes.  She
was transferred from the Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit.  At the time of transfer, her mean
arterial pressure was 70.  She was A-V paced at 88 beats per
minute.  She had Neo-Synephrine at 1 mcg/kg/minute and
propofol at 10 mcg/kg/minute.

The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period.
Her anesthesia was reversed, she was weaned from the
ventilator and successfully extubated.  She remained
hemodynamically stable overnight.  She did, however, require
continuous Neo-Synephrine to maintain an adequate blood
pressure.  Also of note, the patient's underlying rhythm was
noted to be a nodal rhythm with a heart rate of 40.

On postoperative day number one, electrophysiology was called
to assess the need for a permanent pacemaker given the
patient's underlying rhythm.  She remained in nodal rhythm
for the next several days, during which time she was weaned
from her Neo-Synephrine and all tubes, lines and drains were
removed with the exception of her epicardial pacing wires.

On postoperative day number three, the patient was brought to
the electrophysiology laboratory, at which time she underwent
permanent pacemaker placement.  Please see the
electrophysiology note for full details.  In summary, the
patient had a permanent pacemaker placed with a VVI setting
of 60 beats per minute with a rate set at 60.

Over the next several days, the patient remained
hemodynamically stable.  Her activity level was increased
with the assistance of physical therapy and the nursing
staff.  On [**2106-5-24**], it was decided that the patient was
stable and ready to be discharged back to her [**Hospital3 **]
facility.

Physical examination on discharge:  Vital signs:  Temperature
98.4, heart rate 63, atrial fibrillation, blood pressure
143/67, respiratory rate 16 and oxygen saturation 93% in room
air.  Preoperative weight was 62.6 kilograms, 64.8 kilograms
at discharge.  Neurologic examination:  Alert and oriented
times three, moves all extremities, follows commands.
Respiratory:  Somewhat diminished in the left base, otherwise
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:
Irregular rate and rhythm, no murmur; sternum stable,
incision with Steri-Strips, open to air, clean and dry.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel
sounds.  Extremities:  Warm and well perfused with no edema.

Laboratory data:  On [**2106-5-23**], prothrombin time was 13.1
with an INR of 1.1; levels pending for [**2106-5-24**], the day
of discharge.  Potassium 4, BUN 16, creatinine 0.8.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Levoxyl 112 mcg p.o.q.d.
Warfarin 5 mg p.o.q. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,
Saturday and Sunday and 2.5 mg q. Monday.
Percocet 5/325 mg one to two tablets p.o.q.6h.p.r.n.
Milk of Magnesia p.r.n.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post mitral valve repair with a #28 annuloplasty
band, status post tricuspid valve repair with a #32
annuloplasty band and atrial septal defect repair with a
primary closure.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Hypothyroidism.
4.  Chronic atrial fibrillation.
5.  History of subdural hematoma.
6.  Status post permanent pacemaker placement.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is to be discharged to
[**Hospital3 **].
