primary physcian who sent him for a neurology consult at the [**Hospital1 **].  He was found to be hypotensive by the

Pertinent Results:
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST [**2152-6-23**]:
FINDINGS: There is a large frontal lobe mass identified
extending from corpus callosum to both frontal lobes with
central area of low T1 and high T2 signal with areas of low
signal on susceptibility images indicating small areas of
chronic blood products. There is an extensive enhancement
identified in the mass. The location and the appearance of the
mass are suggestive of a glioma or less likely a lymphoma.
Additionally, there is enhancement seen in the left frontal
sulci as well as in the basal cisterns and internal auditory
canals indicative of leptomeningeal spread of the neoplasm.
There is mass effect on the anterior horns of both lateral
ventricles. A prominent flow voids are identified adjacent to
the inferior aspect of the neoplasm indicative of hypertrophic
blood vessels or draining veins.

IMPRESSION: Large bifrontal neoplasm extending through the
corpus callosum
likely a primary neoplasm such as glioma or lymphoma.
Hypertrophic vessels
are visualized in the inferior aspect of the tumor, indicating
vascular supply and whatever the diagnosis of glioma.
Leptomeningeal extension of the neoplasm is identified through
the basal ganglia and internal auditory canal.

CT Torso [**2152-6-24**]:
FINDINGS:
CHEST: There are no pathologically enlarged thoracic lymph
nodes. There is
no pericardial or pleural effusion. There is mild dilatation of
the
esophagus. Lung windows demonstrate no nodules or masses. The
central
airways are patent, without endobronchial lesions. There are no
suspicious
osseous lesions.

ABDOMEN: The liver, spleen, kidneys, adrenal glands, pancreas,
and
gallbladder are normal. There are no pathologically enlarged
lymph nodes.
There is an umbilical hernia containing fat and small bowel,
without evidence of obstruction. There is no free fluid in the
abdomen. Delayed images demonstrate normal contrast excretion of
the kidneys bilaterally.

PELVIS: The bladder is decompressed with a Foley catheter. The
pelvic bowel loops are unremarkable. There is no free fluid.
There are no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes.

Bone windows demonstrate a lytic lesion in the posterior left
iliac bone with a thick sclerotic border. No other focal lesions
are identified. There are minimal degenerative changes of the
spine.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of mass in the chest, abdomen or pelvis.
2. Umbilical hernia containing fat and small bowel.
3. Nonaggressive-appearing lesion within the posterior left
iliac bone,
unlikely to represent a metastatic lesion.
4. Mild esophageal dilatation.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2152-6-25**]:
FINDINGS: Again noted is extensive hypodensity involving both
frontal lobes and the genu of the corpus callosum. There is
persistent mass effect on the bilateral frontal horns. Allowing
for differences in slice selection, there may be slight interval
increase in the diameter of the lateral ventricles. The left
lateral ventricle measures 14 mm compared to 10 mm previously
and the right lateral ventricle measures 14 mm compared to 12 mm
previously. There is no shift of normally midline structures or
evidence of uncal or transtentorial herniation. The 3rd and 4th
ventricles are preserved. There is no evidence of hemorrhagic
conversion. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is otherwise
preserved without evidence of infarction. The visualized portion
of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
No osseous abnormality is identified.

IMPRESSION: Extensive hypodense lesion in the bilateral frontal
lobes with
slight interval increase in the diameter of the lateral
ventricles. Third and fourth ventricles remain patent and
basilar cisterns preserved.
