chest pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
coronary catheterization with percutaneous coronary intervention


History of Present Illness:
This is a 63 [**Last Name (un) **] with PMH of HTN, fibromyalgia, and breast
cancer who was transferred from [**Hospital1 1474**] hypertensive crisis and
likely acute pulmonary edema. Per OSH notes, the patient
presented with moderate respiratory distress and complaining of
chest pressure that woke her from sleep. Electively intubated
for resp distress/hypoxia, given lopressor for HTN, Solumedrol
125 mg, tequin 400 mg. A chest CT ruled out dissection. Also
received vercuronium, vasotec, and lasix. CK 85, trop I 0.2.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], EKG showed NSR [**Company 64667**] wave inversions in I, II, L,
throughout the precordial leads, Q III, LVH. new T wave
inversions, also consistent with HOCM. Initially thought to be
endocardial ischemia from hypertension, not acute coronary
syndrome. She was started on nitro drip, propofol, plavix,
ceftriaxone, and azithromycin.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 63 year-old woman with a history of fibromyalgia,
HTN, PVD who was originally admitted to the MICU for
hypertensive crisis and likely acute pulmonary edema who then
developed an NSTEMI and ? tricuspid endocarditis. She was then
transferred to the CCU and the following issues were addressed
during her stay:
.
- CARDIAC
# Ischemia: While being treated in the MICU for acute pulmonary
edema, patient developed NSTEMI with peak CK 204 and Trop 0.17.
Patient was sent for coronary catheterization on [**11-16**] and
received 2 drug-eluting stents to LCx and D1. Patient received
Integrillin 18 hours post-cath and was maintained on Aspirin
325, Plavix 75, Metoprolol 50 [**Hospital1 **], Lisinopril 40 [**Hospital1 **] and
Atorvastatin 80.
.
# HTN: Patient with severe HTN, admitted in hypertensive crisis.
Patient's blood pressure remained difficult to control
initially, and several agents were required for control. Patient
could not tolerate increase in beta blocker due to HR in 50s,
and patient was discharged on Toprol XL 100, Lisinopril 40 [**Hospital1 **],
Norvasc 10, Hydralazine 50 PO q6h, Aldactone 25, Imdur 120 PO
qd, and Clonidine Patch. Patient received a renal MRI/MRA to
rule out stenosis, and this showed...
.
# PUMP: [**Hospital1 **] showed EF 35-40% 3+ TR or 1+ MR, e/a 0.45
indicative of LV diastolic dysfunction. Patient was started on
Lasix 20mg PO QD and Spironolactone 25mg PO qd. Beta blocker as
above. Patient to follow-up with PCP for electrolytes check.
.
# RHYTHM: While on the floor, patient developed Atrial
Fibrillation and Atrial Flutter that then reverted to sinus
rhythm under beta blocker. Patient was started on Coumadin and
maintained on Heparin drip until INR was therapeutic.
Electrophysiology team was consulted and advised EP study with
possible ablation; however, given concerns for endocarditis,
further management was deferred to outpatient follow-up. Patient
to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Cardiology and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
Electrophysiology. Patient was discharged home on [**Doctor Last Name **] of Hearts
for monitoring.
.
# RIGHT ATRIAL LESION (THROMBUS VS. VEGETATION): Seen on [**Doctor Last Name **]
[**11-15**] and [**11-16**] with ? of subacute endocardititis. Patient was
without clinical signs of endocarditis, however had 1/4 bottles
on [**2118-11-15**] grew Strep Viridans. Subsequent surveillance blood
cultures were negative (though on Antibiotics). Patient was
initially started on Vancomycin and gentamicin, and these were
changed to Penicillin once sensitivities were confirmed. Repeat
[**Date Range **] was done on [**11-22**], and mass/vegetation was thought not to
be endocarditis Patient had double-lumen PICC placed by
Interventional Radiology and will continue Antibiotics at home
for total 6 weeks.
.
# PFO: Small PFO seen on [**Month/Year (2) **] [**11-15**] and [**11-16**]. Patient received
bubble study on [**11-22**] which was unrevealing. PFOs seen in 20% of
the population, no further work-up necessary. Patient without
history of stroke.
.
- RESPIRATORY
# ACUTE PULMONARY EDEMA: Patient admitted to the MICU in
respiratory distress s/p intubation, thought to be secondary to
acute pulmonary edema. Diuresis improved pulmonary congestion on
CXR and patient was subsequently extubated. Initially, patient
received empiric course of Vancomycin given leukocytosis and
concern for underlying PNA, which was later discontinued given
lack of clinical and radiologic suspicion. Patient with wheezing
on exam maintained on inhaled steroids.
.
# LEUKOCYTOSIS: Patient with leukocytosis to 22.5 at [**Hospital1 18**] after
receiving stress-dose steroids at OSH. Multiple possible
etiologies including stress-response, steroids, ? endocarditis,
MI, ? other infection. Given concerns for endocarditis, patient
was treated as per above. Leukocytosis resolved with extubation,
NSTEMI intervention, and with Abx therapy. Patient was afebrile
throughout hospital course.
Repeat cultures negative.
.
# ASYMMETRIC PUPILS: Head CT done for concerns of possible ICH,
no mass effect or bleed seen. Later learned that patient has
history of cataract surgery.
.
# HYPERGLYCEMIA
Patient hyperglycemic on presentation with glucose of 325,
thought to be secondary to steroids administration.
Hyperglycemia covered with RISS, self-resolved. HgbA1C 6.1 on
[**11-17**]. SS susbequently dc'd and sugars stable off steroids.
