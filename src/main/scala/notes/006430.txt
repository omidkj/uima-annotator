Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 545**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
hpi: 71 yo Farsi- speaking female who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED
today complaining of SOB x 1 week, along with general malaise
and weakness.  History obtained through daughter as pt sleeping
and speaks limited english.  Daughter states that the VNA
recommmended she go to the hospital 4 days ago, but the patient
refused.  VNA was concerned as the patient was becoming
increasingly dyspneic and lethargic.  Daughter denies any new
cough, no fevers or chills.  No chest pain or pleuritic pain.
Worsening DOE, able to go from room to room in her apartment but
becomes winded.  States the urinary incontinence has happened in
the past, currently attributes this to recently increased lasix
dose.  The daughter is also wondering if her mother is worse
because of the increased oxygen that she was sent home on after
her last hospitalization (hospitalized for falls thought to be
secondary to mental status changes from hypercapnea).  Denies
any new or missed doses of her medications.  At baseline the
patient ambulates with a walker but very rarely leaves her home.
 Is still able to do ADLs/ independent ADLs including dressing
herself, bathing herself, does some of her own cooking.
.
In the ED the patient's vitals were 99.6/ bp 155/70/ hr 88/ 86%
on 4L NC. Chest x-ray was done, and the patient was given SL
nitro, combivent nebs, and lasix.  The patient was started on
BI-PAP for respiratory distress, ABG 7.28/ 84/ 70/41.  The
patient was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.

Studies:

Portable CXR ([**9-15**]) - Interval worsening of perihilar and upper
lung field vascular engorgement and cardiomegaly, suggesting
cardiac decompensation. Atelectasis of right lower lung.

Head CT ([**9-13**]):
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of intra- or extra-axial
hemorrhage. There is no mass effect, hydrocephalus, or shift of
the normally midline structures. Similar minimal prominence of
the ventricular system is noted. There are also unchanged
ill-defined areas of relative hypodensity in the white matter in
the frontal lobes, probably chronic small vessel infarcts. The
visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
The osseous structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Resolution of fluid in the right maxillary sinus. No
other change.


Brief Hospital Course:
1) Shortness of Breath
Likely secondary to hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient
has a history of hypercapnea, has been admitted numerous times
with CO2 in the 70-80's.  Admission ABG demonstrates a chronic
respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis.
However, BNP also significantly more elevated than prior, CXR
with B/L effusions, cardiomegaly suggestive of component of
heart failure. The patient was ruled out for an MI with 2 sets
of neg. cardiac enzymes, also with no significant EKG changes on
admission. Pt was continued on supplemental oxygen with BI-PAP
overnight on home settings ([**11-12**]) on HD1. She was diuresed
aggressively to neg. 5L and given standing nebs with improvement
in respiratory function. Patient is currently at goal CO2 (65-75
range) and O2sat (89-92%) with pH at 7.41.  On [**9-10**] she was
transitioned back to her home Lasix dose of 60mg PO and
transferred to the floor.  She was maintained on lasix 60mg
daily and given extra dose on [**9-11**] as thought mild overload.
Oxygen sats high 80's to low 90's on four liters.  Patient non
compliant with bipap at night and more somnolent over [**Date range (1) 28751**].
 Nursing unable to keep patient on bipap at night.  ABG by [**9-13**]
revealed hypercarbia. Transferred back to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for somnolence
with hypercarbia.
.
Transferred back to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] [**9-13**]: Patient diuresed another [**1-31**]
liters and BIPAP maintained.  Placed on steroids for possible
copd exacerbation.  By [**9-15**] patietn's pC02 down in 50's to 60's
and back to floor on [**9-15**] PM.
.
On [**9-16**] and [**9-17**] patient maintained on bipap at night with
restraints as needed for compliance as well as steroids.  Oxygen
saturation low 90's on 4 liters which is baseline.  Lasix dosing
to 60mg daily, outpatient dosing
.
On [**7-16**], prior to discharge, pt maintained her Oxygen
saturation in 90-93% range on 2-3L O2.
.
2) COPD
History of COPD, but no PFTs on record here.  Pt has upcoming
appt scheduled with pulmonologist.  As above, started on steroid
taper, plan two weeks given copd exacerbation, severe COPD.
Currently on Prednisone 30mg daily (started [**9-19**]).  Should
continue on this until [**9-22**].  Should then change to 20mg daily
for 4 days, then 10mg daily for 4 days, then 5mg daily for 4
days, then 2.5mg daily for 4 days, then off.
.
3) Cardiac
a. Vessels- history of CABG x4 in [**2119**], no acute issues. The
patient was continued on her home beta-blocker, aspirin, statin
b. Pump- history of CHF, preserved EF on echo in 5/[**2130**].  The
patient appeared somewhat volume overloaded on admission, which
improved with diuresis. She was continued on her home dose of
digoxin and beta-blocker.  Lisinopril 2.5mg was added on [**9-10**]
given patient's history of heart failure and diabetes.  This was
titrated to 5mg.  Patient diuresed 3-4 liters over course of
admission.  Lasix outpatient 60mg dosing re-started on [**9-15**].
Digoxin stopped on [**9-14**] in ICU, not re-started.  This could
potentially be restarted as an outpat
