HISTORY: A 57-year-old woman with PNH of stroke, evaluate for
acute CVA.

HEAD CT: Axial imaging was performed through the brain without
IV contrast.

COMPARISON: MRI brain [**2169-5-4**].

FINDINGS: In the medial aspect of the right cerebellar
hemisphere is a region
of hypodensity (2:12), but has not yet reached CSF density and
likely
represents an evolving subacute infarct. There are no areas
suspicious for
acute vascular infarct. Ventricles and sulci display minimal
prominence
likely age- related atrophy. There is no shift of normally
midline
structures. [**Doctor Last Name **]- white matter differentiation remains well
preserved. There
is no edema. The osseous structures appear intact. Paranasal
sinuses,
ethmoid and mastoid air cells are clear, which is an improvement
from [**2169**]
where the maxillary sinuses were partially opacified.

IMPRESSION:
1. Area of hypodensity in the medial aspect of the right
cerebellar
hemisphere, corresponding to the site of subacute infarct. No
regions
concerning for acute vascular territorial infarction. If there
is a
persistent concern, MRI is more sensitive for evaluation.
2. No hemorrhage.
3. Improvement in aeration of the maxillary sinuses.

NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: The right cerebellar lesion
appears to
represent atrophy, suggesting an old infarct, rather than a
subacute lesion.

Final Report
HISTORY: 57-year-old woman with infection of BK [**Doctor Last Name **] bypass
graft. Please
assess infrarenal to right lower extremity stump for arterial
blood flow.

CTA AORTA RUNOFF: Helical imaging was performed from the level
of the kidneys
through or below the level of the right below-knee amputation
prior without IV
contrast. Subsequently, after uneventful administration of
intravenous
contrast, helical imaging was again performed from the level of
the kidneys to
below the level of the right below-knee amputation. Coronal and
sagittal
reformats were prepared. Repeat imaging was performed in the
venous phase.

COMPARISON: CT pelvis from [**2173-8-25**].

FINDINGS: The partially visualized kidneys enhance symmetrically
with small
bilateral hypodensities too small to fully characterize. At the
origin of the
bilateral renal arteries are moderate-severe narrowing with
adjacent calcific
atherosclerotic plaque. There is hypoenhancement of the left
kidney, which is
slightly atrophic compared to the right.Tiny accessory left
renal artery
perfuses the upper pole. Small wedge-shaped peripheral areas of
hypoenhancement are likely infarcts. The hepatic vasculature
appears
conventional and the liver and gallbladder are unremarkable. The
partially
visualized spleen appears unremarkable. Abdominal loops of bowel
are normal in
their appearance.

Approximately 6 cm below the aortic bifurcation on the right is
a bypass graft
which demonstrates complete occlusive thrombus along its entire
length
extending into the right mid thigh. There are small collateral
arterial
vessels which flow into the right proximal thigh (5a:157). Right
popliteal
artery recionstitutes and is patent but diminuitive. Proximal
right AT and PT
are patent but not well assessed. Right peroneal appears
occluded In
addition, there is a bypass graft catheter from the left common
femoral artery
to the left above knee popliteal artery, which demonstrates
normal arterial
flow. The left popliteal artery is patent. The left anterior
tibial artery is
widely patent proximally. The left PT and peroneal arteries are
diminuitive
with significant disease not well assessed on this study.

The bladder, rectum, sigmoid colon and pelvic loops of small and
large bowel
appear normal. The bladder wall is mildly thickened but may be
due to
underdistension of the bladder. The uterus appears atrophic.
Adnexal
structures are not visualized. There is no free air in the
abdomen or pelvis.

BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious sclerotic or lytic
lesions. There are
mild degenerative changes of the lower lumbar spine. Patient is
status post
L4/L5 laminectomy.

IMPRESSION:
1. Complete occlusive thrombus along the length of the right
femoral bypass
graft. The left femoral bypass graft demonstrates normal
arterial flow. There
are small collateral arterial vessels which perfuses the right
lower extremity
with reconstitution of a diminutive politeal artery. there may
be occlusion of
the right peroneal artery and there is disease in the proximal
left PT and
peroneal arteries incompletely assessed on this study.

2. Moderate-severe bilateral renal artery stenosis with adjacent
calcific
plaque. Mild left renal atrophy and hypoenhancement indicates
worse stenosis
on the left. Possible small bilateral renal infarcts.

3. Status post L4/L5 laminectomy.

[**2175-8-4**]
HISTORY: Possible prior stroke.

FINDINGS: Calcific plaque involving the internal carotid
arteries
bilaterally. The peak systolic velocities on the right are 186,
145, 128, 108
and 133 cm/sec for the proximal, mid and distal ICA and CCA and
ECA
respectively. Similar values on the left are 73, 119, 77, 71,
and 80 cm/sec.
The ICA to CCA ratio is 1.7 on the right and 1.6 on the left.
There is
antegrade flow involving both verteb
