Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1974**]
Chief Complaint:
Diarrhea.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Sternotomy and drainage pericardial effusion.
Lymph node biopsy.


History of Present Illness:
30F with hypothyroidism and anemia history initially presented
to ED [**1-16**] w/ [**3-21**] day h/o fever and diarrhea. Patient was taking
stool softeners daily with her iron pills and she attributed her
watery diarrhea to overdose of the stool softener. She denied
hematochezia. In the ED, found to be hypotensive, responsive
initially to fluids, and febrile to 101. Patient was given
empiric vanco/levo/flagyl. CXR showed cardiomegaly and an ECHO
revealed a large pericardial effusion as well as intramural
hematoma in aorta. Emergent CTA of the chest showed a likely
type A aortic dissection. Of note, patient's initial INR was
elevated at 1.8 and PTT was elevated at 45 which was of unclear
etiology, thought potentially due to loss of bowel flora. She
received no heparin prior to when these values were drawn.

Pt was taken emergently to OR, revealing serous pericardial
effusion, per surgical team. The aorta showed calcifications and
inflammatory changes concerning for infectious process.
Therefore, no intervention of the aorta was undertaken.
Pericardium was stripped and left open.

[**Name (NI) **], pt failed to be weaned off of epinephrine drip.
Continued to spike temp to 102.2 on vancomycin started post-op.
CXR showed L pleural effusion and loculated fluid in the L
fissure. Levo added [**1-19**] for presumed pneumonia.

In the ICU, patient had deteriorating mental status and 1 day of
neck stiffness. Neuro was consulted but neck stiffness resolved.
CT and LP were both negative. Mental status improved [**1-22**],
extubated [**1-22**], now back to baseline. Mental status changes
presumed to be due to either SLE cerebritis or hypoperfusion.
WBC continued to be elevated and low grade fever persisted. ID
was consulted. All blood and stool cultures have been negative.
RPR was negative. ID determined that aortitis is unlikely of
infectious etiology. Patient was found to have low complement
levels and Rheum was consulted. Rheum suspected
lupus/takayasu/giant cell as the etiology of pericardial
effusion and aortitis. Patient was also found to have low
cortisol in the setting of hypotension. Endocrine was consulted.
MRIpit showed partially empty sella. Likely hypopituitary but
not panhypopit b/c FSH/LH levels were normal. Patient was
started on dexamethasone [**1-21**], switched to prednisone [**1-24**].
Upon arrival to the floor, she was found to have LUE edema. An
U/S was ordered and found a thrombus occluding L IJ and a
thrombus in the R cephalic vein.

Patient describes feeling better with her arrival to the floor.
She recalls none of the events that took place in the ICU. She
says that her diarrhea went away with discontinuation of the
stool softeners. She complains of fatigue, a mild cough, and
shortness of breath. She denies hematochezia, hematemesis,
abdominal pain, chest pain, wheezing, nausea, vomiting,
headache, dizziness, fevers, chills, dysuria, vision changes,
numbness and tingling in her extremities, joint pain, rashes,
and claudication.

[**Name (NI) **], pt failed to be weaned off of epinephrine drip (CVP 8,
PAD 14, PA mean 19). Continued to be CVP10 PA27/17,
thermodilution CI 1.8, SVO2 61. Continued to spike temp to 102.2
on vancomycin (given post-operatively), however, no additional
antibiotics added.

1. Iron deficiency anemia
2. Hypothyroidism - no current medications
3. Shortness of breath of unclear etiology (DOE)
4. History of leg cramps

pregnancies total.  Noted a history of irregular and heavy
menstrual periods.

CT CHEST/ADB ([**2189-1-16**]):
1. Findings consistent with ascending aorta circumferential
large intramural hematoma. A focal outpouching along the
anterior aorta just superior and to the right of the RCA origin
appears unchanged from prior studies in [**2187**]. This could be a
small pseudoaneurysm.
2. Large pericardial effusion with density greater than simple
fluid raises suspicion for bleeding into a pericardial effusion.
Right and left coronary arteries appear widely patent at their
origins.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
4. Right upper lobe 4 mm nodule again seen. New 3 mm nodule in
the right upper lobe ([**4-29**]). One-year followup is recommended to
document stability.
5. Replaced right subclavian artery.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  ([**2189-1-16**])
No evidence of hemorrhage or mass, appearance unchanged from
[**2186-7-18**].

CXR ([**2189-1-16**]):
Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette compared to [**2187**] may
represent cardiomegaly versus pericardial effusion. Prominence
of pulmonary vascularity noted bilaterally suggests mild
pulmonary edema.

ECHO ([**2189-1-16**]):
1. The right atrium is markedly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed.
3. The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated. There is
severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
3. The aortic root is mildly dilated. The anterior and posterior
walls of the aortic root are homogenous thickened (1 cm)
suggesting an intramural hematoma.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
5. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. Mild pulmonary
hypertension is present.
6. There is a large, circumferential pericardial effusion with
large amounts of fibrin/thrombus on the surface of the heart. No
clear evidence of tamponade is seen, but this may be due to
pulmonary hypertension.
7. Compared to the previous report of [**2187-8-24**], the pericardial
effusion is much larger.

MR PITUITARY W&W/O CONTRAST  ([**2189-1-23**])
Ventricles to have normal in size which is unchanged from the
previous CT examinations of [**2184-10-18**]. Empty sella without evidence
of pituitary
