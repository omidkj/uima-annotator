V tach

VT ablation


History of Present Illness:
47 year old man with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 30%), non
flow limiting CAD, HTN, hyperchol p/w SOB. Pt was having
exertional abdominal tightness and SOB for the past 8 weeks. His
outpt cardiologist Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] thought that this might be a
manifestation of angina. Hence pt was getting a stress MIBI test
to assess for coronary ischemia. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] also increased his
dose of metoprolol and added furosemide 20 qd. Pt says he felt
better with the furosemide for about a week after seeing Dr
[**Last Name (STitle) **] but again started to have similar symptoms. Today at the
stress test the pt was feeling SOB and was found to have a WCT
even before he started the stress test. He was also diaphoretic.
He received IV metoprolol 5 x 2 but did not slow down. Hence he
was sent to the ER.

In ED, initial vitals were 98.4 141 139/102 18 100%/RA. ECG
showed VT. Later he was hypotensive to 90s. He received amio 150
Iv x 1 and then went into sinus rhythm. He was thought to have
pulm edema and recd IV lasix x 1. After about 45 mins he again
went into VT with SBP down to 80s. He recd another bolus of IV
amio 150 x 1 and was started on amio drip at that time. He was
in VT at a HR of around 130 for a couple of hours and then went
back into sinus rhythm. He also recd metoprolol 5 Iv x 1 and
morphine 4 IV x1 for back pain.

On floor, patient was feeling fine. Denied SOB, CP, dizziness,
palpitations.

On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.  He endorsed dyspnea on
exertion. Has been using 2 pillows when sleeping at night.

ECG: Wide complex tach, likely V tach of fascicular origin at
150 bpm.

TTE: The left atrial volume is markedly increased (>32ml/m2).
The right atrium is markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the inferior and
inferolateral segments and hypokinesis of all other segments.
The anterior septum and anterior wall have relatively preserved
function.. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The number of
aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric, posteriorly
directed jet of mild to moderate ([**12-6**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2152-3-23**],
the left ventricle is more dilated and overall ejection fraction
is significantly lower. The inferior and inferolateral segments
were moderately hypokinetic and are now akinetic, the other
segments were mild hypokinetic and now are more severely
hypokinetic. The degree of mitral regurgitation has increased.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Wide complex tachycardia: Pt with first documented episode of
V tach. Has h/o non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and was having SOB
since past 2 months. Likely was having pulm edema causing SOB as
he did feel better after starting furosemide by his outpt
cardiologist. Patient required lidocaine boluses and lidocain
drip for night prior to VT ablation in order to keep him in
sinus rhythm. He underwent VT ablation [**2155-3-13**] after which he
remained in NSR aside from 10beat run of NSVT on telemetry
overnight. This run of NSVT was at a faster rate than his prior
episodes and was thought to be from a different focus. This
could be a result of his cardiomyopathy.

# Cardiomyopathy: On TTE this admission he had worsened EF and
WMA as compared to prior in [**2151**]. This may have been [**1-6**]
tachycardia from VT for several weeks, however, it may also be
from CAD. He will have a CMR as an outpatient to assess for
scar. He may also benefit from a viability study to ascertain
whether a cardiac cath and reperfusion could increase his pump
function. If his EF does not improve in the next few months
while he remains in NSR and is maximally medically managed if
his EF doesnt improve, he may need AICD in the future. Will
continue ACE, statin, aspirin, and beta blocker as outpatient.

# Hypertension: Continued home enalapril
