HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 64 year old
woman who was recently diagnosed with Wegener's
granulomatosis in [**2137-9-16**], who was readmitted in late
[**2137-10-17**], for dialysis graft clog and increased lethargy
and malnourishment.  The patient was discharged to short term
rehabilitation after workup for lethargy which included MR of
her head, lumbar puncture and electroencephalogram were
nondiagnostic.  She also had the dialysis catheter removed as
renal felt it was no longer necessary.

On presentation on [**2137-11-19**], the patient was noted to have
had three days of increased lethargy, confusion and abdominal
pain, nausea, vomiting.  Apparently the patient also had not
eaten at home.  Tube feeding had been proposed but the
patient refused.  She complained of occasional nausea, no
vomiting, no melena or bright red blood per rectum.  She did
complain of pain in multiple areas of her body especially in
her abdomen.

In the Emergency Department, the patient received one liter
of normal saline, Droperidol and Levofloxacin and Flagyl
intravenous for question of intra-abdominal processes.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Wegener's granulomatosis.
2.  Acute renal failure.
3.  Peripheral neuropathy.
4.  Bilateral otitis media.
5.  Basal cell carcinoma of the face.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Short term rehabilitation.  Also significant
for death of husband approximately one year ago.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Zoloft 50 mg q.d.
2.  Nystatin swish and swallow 5 cc q.i.d.
3.  Calcium Carbonate 1500 mg t.i.d.
4.  Neutra-Phos one packet t.i.d.
5.  Cytoxan 75 mg q.d.
6.  Prednisone 40 mg q.d.
7.  Epogen 6000 units subcutaneous each week.
8.  Potassium Chloride 40 meq q.d.
9.  Lasix 80 mg q.d.
10. Multivitamin q.d.
11. Iron 325 mg q.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient
is an ill appearing woman in no apparent distress.  Her vital
signs include a temperature 98.9, blood pressure 132/80,
heart rate 124, respiratory rate 22, oxygen saturation 94% in
room air.  The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light
and accommodation.  Her mucous membranes are dry and she has
oral thrush.  Her neck is supple with no jugular venous
distention.  Her heart is tachycardic with regular rhythm and
II/VI systolic murmur at the upper sternal border.  Her lungs
are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Her abdomen is soft
with good bowel sounds and diffuse tenderness.  Her
extremities showed 2+ pitting edema up to the thighs.
Neurologically, she is alert and oriented times one and
noncooperative and moves all four extremities spontaneously.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white count 12.1, hematocrit
33.5, platelets 113,000.  Differential showed 98% polys, no
lymphocytes, 1% monocytes, 1% eosinophils.  Chemistries
showed sodium 130, potassium 5.7, chloride 101, bicarbonate
18, blood urea nitrogen 75, creatinine 2.5  ALT 54, AST 49,
alkaline phosphatase 129, total bilirubin 0.4, albumin 2.6.
Prothrombin time 12.5, partial thromboplastin time 33, INR
1.1.  Urinalysis revealed trace protein, 0-2 red blood cells,
0-2 white blood cells and occasional bacteria.

Electrocardiogram - sinus tachycardia at 120 beats per
minute, T wave flattening in lead I, T wave inversion in lead
aVL, new since [**Month (only) **].

Chest x-ray showed question of thickening in the right major
fissure, no congestive heart failure, no effusions.

KUB revealed thickened hepatic flexure of the colon, no
obstruction and no free air.

CT of the abdomen without contrast - no obstruction, no
inflammatory process, no abscess, no free air.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 64 year old woman with a
prior diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis and associated
renal failure who presents with failure to thrive.  Her
hospital course was significant for an episode of hypotension
and acute hypoxia on hospital day two with desaturation to
the 80s and hypotension to the 80s.  She required
vasopressors and was intubated for hypoxic failure and
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further
care.

Prior to intubation, a VQ scan was performed to assess for
pulmonary embolus which was read as intermediate probability,
although the patient was unable to perform the ventilation
portion of the examination.  She was started on Heparin,
however, and the following day, the VQ scan was repeated
while the patient was intubated.  This examination was read
as high probability.

However, in the interim, the patient's partial thromboplastin
time became supratherapeutic on Heparin and the patient had a
drop in hematocrit from 32.0 to 17.0, also in the setting of
five liters of volume resuscitation.  The Heparin was
discontinued at this point and the partial thromboplastin
time was allowed to normalize.

There was also concern in the setting of her drop in
hematocrit and associated thrombocytopenia for DIC, and
hematology was consulted.  The hematologist felt that the
smear was not consistent with DIC and suggested that in the
setting of pulmonary embolus and probable gastrointestinal
bleed, the best course was to place an inferior vena cava
filter.

The placement of the filter was scheduled for the following
morning, however, that morning the patient was noted to not
be moving her right extremities.  She also was noted to have
a leftward gaze deviation and upgoing toe on the right.  CT
of the head was performed and revealed a 5.0 by 7.0
centimeter infarct in the left middle cerebral artery and ACA
region as well as infarction in the pons.  The stroke team
was consulted at this point but felt that there was no
additional intervention that could be offered.

Shortly thereafter, the patient's left pupil became fixed and
dilated.  CT scan was repeated which showed no significant
change and no evidence of uncal herniation.  At that point,
the inferior vena cava filter was placed by interventional
radiology.  Neurology was consulted to comment on the
patient's prognosis which was felt to be poor.

The patient's family was contact[**Name (NI) **] and requested that the
patient be kept on ventilatory support until an additional
family member could arrive from overseas.  The patient was
thus maintained on mechanical ventilation with additional
vasopressors.

In the interim, the patient's blood cultures grew out four
out of four bottles of coagulase negative Staphylococcus
aureus which was Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
 The patient had been started on Vancomycin and Ceftazidime
empirically prior to her transfer to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit.

With the arrival of the family member, support was withdrawn
and the patient passed away from respiratory failure
secondary to ischemic stroke and pulmonary embolus.  Time of
death on [**2137-11-26**], was 09:35 p.m.  An autopsy was requested
from the family and the decision was pending at this time.

At the suggestion of hematology service, laboratories for
hypercoagulability workup were sent prior to the patient's
death.  These are pending at this time.
