History of Present Illness:
This is a 79 year old male, s/p coronary bypass in [**2146-11-7**]
who presents with congestive heart failure secondary to severe
mitral regurgitation. His mitral regurgitation was caused by an

endocarditis in [**2146-12-8**] which has been successfully
treated with an extended course of antibiotics. He now is
limited by his dyspnea on exertion and continues to have [**2-8**]

replacement and tricuspid valve replacment/repair.

Pertinent Results:
Pre bypass: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left
atrial appendage. The right atrium is moderately dilated. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with septal and inferior
wall hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed (LVEF= 35-40 %). The right ventricular free
wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened.

Post bypass: Patient is on epi, milrinone, norepi. Inferior wall
function improved on ionotropes, sill mildly hypokinetic.
Septutm appears dyskinetic, even after discontinuatioin of av
pacing in favor of a pacing. LVEF 40%. Mitral prosthesis well
seated, no MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 31820**] leaks. Peak gradients [**7-18**], mean
6-8 mm Hg at cardiac outpu [**4-12**] lpm. Tricuspid annuloplasty ring
insitu with no TR or perivalular leaks. Peak gradient 3, mean 1
mm Hg,. Remaining exam unchanged. All findings discussde with
surgeons at the time of the exam.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital on [**2148-2-5**] for
pre-operative work-up.  Cardiac catheterization revealed three
vessel coronary artery disease with a patent LIMA and SVG-OM.
SVG-RCA with 70% ostial and distal anastomosis lesions.  Echo
revealed EF 45%, moderate to severe MR, moderate to severe
tricuspid regurgitation and severe pulmonary hypertension.
Non-invasive carotid exam reveals no stenoses bilaterally.

He was brought to the Operating Room on [**2148-2-7**] where the he
underwent redo sternotomy, mitral replacement and tricuspid
annuloplasty. he weaned from bypass with some difficulty on
Epinephrine, Vasopressin, Levophed, Milrinone and Propofol
infusions. Post operatively he was transferred to the CVICU for
recovery and invasive monitoring.  Vancomycin was used for
surgical antibiotic prophylaxis given the inpatient stay of
longer than 24hours.

POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  He was neurologically intact and
hemodynamically stable. He was weaned from inotropic support
over the next 24 hours. Diuresis was begun towards his
preoperative weight and beta blockers begun.

Physical Therapy was consulted for strength and mobilty
assistance.  Chest tubes and temporoary pacing wires were
removed according to protocol.  Diuretics were continued at
discharge for an indeterminate time.  A CT of the chest was
performed prior to discharge for further characterization of the
LLL pulmonary nodule which was likely unchanged allowing for
technique. . Arrangements were made for follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 68712**] from Thoracic Surgery in 6 months.

He developed brief, controlled rate atrial fibrillation and
Coumadin was begun with a goal INR of [**1-9**].5.  Diuresis and
pulmonary toilet improved his oxygenation. He was ambulatory and
wanted to go hoem rather than rehab.

Arrangements were made for his anticoagulation to be monitored
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] until dose stable then will transition to [**Hospital 197**]
clinic.  VNA will draw an INR on Monday, [**2-19**]. Patient to
take 2.5 mg of Coumadin 3/11,12,13,14.

Discharge medications, precautions and follow up were discussed
with him and his wife prior to leaving the hospital.
