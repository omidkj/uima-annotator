Chief Complaint:
Post-cardiac arrest, asthma exacerbation

Intubation
Removal of chest tubes placed at an outside hospital
R CVL placement


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 3234**] is a 36 year old gentleman with a PMH signifciant
with dilated cardiomyopathy s/p AICD, asthma, and HTN admitted
to an OSH with dyspnea now admitted to the MICU after PEA arrest
x2. The patient initially presented to LGH ED with hypoxemic
respiratory distress. While at the OSH, he received CTX,
azithromycin, SC epinephrine, and solumedrol. While at the OSH,
he became confused and subsequently had an episode of PEA arrest
and was intubated. He received epinephrine, atropine, magnesium,
and bicarb. In addition, he had bilateral needle thoracostomies
with report of air return on the left, and he subsequently had
bilateral chest tubes placed.  After approximately 15-20 minutes
of rescucitation, he had ROSC. He received vecuronium and was
started on an epi gtt for asthma and a cooling protocol, and was
then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation. Of note, the
patient was admitted to LGH in [**1-4**] for dyspnea, and was
subsequently diagnosed with a CAP and asthma treated with CTX
and azithromycin. Per his family, he has also had multiple
admissions this winter for asthma exacerbations.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, 35.3 102 133/58 100%AC 500x20, 5, 1.0 with an
ABG 7.16/66/162. He had a CTH which was unremarkable. He then
had a CTA chest, afterwhich he went into PEA arrest.
Rescucitation last approximately 10-15 minutes with multiple
rounds of epi and bicarb, with ROSC. He was then admitted to the
MICU for further management.
.
Currently, the patient is intubated, sedated, and parlyzed.

CXR (in MICU): Mr read - cardiomegaly, RIJ in SVC, ETT 4.5 cm
above carina. Blunting of costophrenic angles bilaterally with
low lung volumes. Loss of retrocardiac diagphragm and bilateral
opacities (L>R)
.
CXR:
1. NG tube at 7.2 cm above the carina. [**Month (only) 116**] consider advancing
for optimal placement.
2. Severe cardiomegaly with globular shape. In the absence of
prior
comparison, the differential is broad, including moderate
pericardial
effusion, mediastinal hemorrhage, or acute cardiac failure.
Recommend
clinical correlation.
.
CTH: My read, no acute bleed
.
CTA Chest:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism, although evaluation of
subsegmental branches is limited.
2. Moderate cardiomegaly without pericardial effusion.
3. Bilateral dependent atelectasis.
4. Multiple nondisplaced rib fractures on the right, some of
which are subacute. Also possible subtle nondisplaced fractures
of the left ribs.
5. Nondisplaced acute sternal fracture in addition to a subacute
nondisplaced sternal fracture.
.
TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. LV
systolic function appears depressed (ejection fraction ? 30
percent) with regional variation. There is considerable
beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection
fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats. The right
ventricular free wall thickness is normal. The right ventricular
cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
ECG (post-arrest):  Sinus with 1:1 conduction. LAA. LAD, RBBB,
LAFB. STD in V4-V6.
.
ECG (pre-arrest): Sinus with 1:1 conduction. LAD, bifascicular
block. No lateral STD.
.
ECG (OSH, unclear pre/post arrest): Sinus with 1:1 conduction.
Bifascicular (RBBB, LAFB) block. STD in V5-6.
.
EEG [**2-27**]
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG telemetry due to the
slow and
disorganized background of 6.5 Hz with bursts of generalized
slowing
that showed no clear reactivity. These findings indicate a
severe
encephalopathy. This may be consistent with the patient's
history of
anoxia; however, toxic/metabolic disturbances, infection, and
medication
effects are also among the most frequent causes of
encephalopathy. No
clear epileptiform discharges or seizures were seen.

LUMBAR SPINE [**2115-3-11**]

CLINICAL INFORMATION: Evidence of fracture, seizure, fall, low
back pain.

FINDINGS:

Three views of the lumbar spine demonstrate mild narrowing of
the left
femoroacetabular joint. There is mild scoliosis of the
thoracolumbar spine.  The ventricular lead of a pacemaker is
identified. No fracture of L2 through L5 is identified. However,
there is a compression fracture of L1, with compression of the
superior endplate, and a sclerotic fracture line. Given the
mechanism of fall, if there is acute pain referable to L1, then
this would be considered an acute finding. There is no apparent
retropulsion of the posterior margin of L1 into the spinal
canal. No other fractures are identified at this time. Facet
joints are aligned. There is early calcification of the aorta.
IMPRESSION: Compression fracture of L1 with anterior wedge
deformity, likely an acute finding. No other fractures
identified.
EKG: Normal sinus rhythm. Complete right bundle-branch block
with left anterior fascicular block. Diffuse ST-T wave changes
laterally.
CT Head:
COMPARISON: [**2115-2-22**].
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast axial images were obtained through the
brain.
FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, edema, or loss of
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white matter differentiation. Ventricles and sulci are
normal in size and configuration. The basilar cisterns are not
compressed. Paranasal sinuses demonstrate fluid in the sphenoid
air cells and right posterior ethmoid air cell, likely related
to prolonged hospitalization.  Mastoid air cells are well
aerated.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.
