ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at home with her husband.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  The
patient's temperature was 102.9, heart rate 130, blood
pressure 201/104 in the Emergency Room.  The patient was
having rigors on examination.  Chest: Clear to auscultation
bilaterally, tachycardiac but regular.  Abdomen:  Soft.
Incision was clean, dry, and intact.  No erythema.  No edema
in the extremities.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 6.7, hematocrit 26.7, platelets
253,000, BUN and creatinine 4 and 1.7.  Bicarbonate 13.

EKG was sinus tachycardia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was in the Emergency Room
having rigors and during the placement of a Foley, she
desaturated down to 80% and had to be placed on a
nonrebreather mask.  She complained of shortness of breath
and some chest pain.  A chest x-ray was obtained and was
consistent with congestive heart failure.  She was given 80
mg of Lasix, placed on a nitroglycerin drip for blood
pressure control, and started on a beta blocker.

After the initiation of this therapy, her respiratory
symptoms resolved.  Her saturations recovered to 100%.  Based
on this desaturation, cardiac enzymes were sent and were
found to be slightly elevated with a high troponin I of 5.0.

In the meantime, urinalysis and culture were sent which were
positive for E. coli and blood cultures sent were positive
for gram-negative rod bacteremia.  She was placed on
levofloxacin and Flagyl and then ultimately left on
levofloxacin for antibiotic coverage.

In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient remained stable.  She
was evaluated by Cardiology and the patient was placed on
oral medications for blood pressure control including
Lopressor and Norvasc.  She was weaned off the nitroglycerin
drip and was then transferred to the floor on hospital day
number five.

On the floor, the patient remained stable.  She had a
Persantine MIBI cardiac test which was negative for any
ischemia.  Her creatinine remained stable.  She continued to
make urine.  She defervesced and had no temperature spikes.
She has otherwise done well and is stable for discharge.

Of note, on the date of planned discharge, the patient left
the hospital against medical advice prior to the team's order
for discharge.  She was told that she would be at risk for
developing a further infection for putting her transplant and
her own health at risk if she was to leave prior to receiving
the appropriate discharge instructions.  She decided to leave
and there will be an attempt to make contact with her at home
to determine her needs and further follow-up regarding both
her renal transplant and the urosepsis.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Urosepsis.
2.  Congestive heart failure.
3.  Status post cadaveric renal transplant.
4.  Diabetes mellitus.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Hypercholesterolemia.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  Her admission medications with no
new medications since the patient left AMA.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable, but it is worrisome that the
patient did not receive the prescriptions for her antibiotic
and her antihypertensive medications.  She will be contact[**Name (NI) **]
at home by the Transplant Team.
