Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 1350**]
Chief Complaint:
Back Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2130-6-9**] Thoracotomy, placement of chest tube x 2. T5-T8
corpectomy.
[**2130-6-13**] PSIF T2-T11


History of Present Illness:
54 yoF w/ a h/o IDDM, CAD s/p CABG in [**2128**], CHF with an EF of
30% s/p ICD plcmt who initially presented to [**Hospital3 2568**] on [**4-24**]
with a complaint of R sided back pain (sudden onset, R mid back
pain, worsened with coughing) and shortness of breath, as well
as a few weeks of increasing lower extremity edema. Her BNP was
noted to be 2700 and the thought was this was a CHF exacerbation
(or possibly pneumonia given cough) so she was treated with
levaquin and diuresed. She was aggressively diuresed initially
to the point which her Cr increased from initiall normal to 4.9.
An initial CT of the chest showed mild angulation of the
thoracic spine as well as multilobar pneumonia, so the patient
was started on vanc in addition to her levaquin. Her admission
was complicated by MRSA bacteremia and the patient was started
on vancomycin. A repeat CT of the spine on [**5-20**] revealed major
thoracic kyphosis and compression, in addition she was noted to
have an fluid collection (possible abscess) extending along the
soft tissue pre vertebral surface from T7-T9. Of note this
abscess abuts the thoracic aorta.
.
The patient has since been in a TLSO brace and is ambulating
freely. Her VS are stable and she is being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further management / drainage of abscess.

On transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient has "severe" back pain to R of
midline of her mid back, it radiates to her abdomen. This has
been stably worsening for 5 weeks. She denies any other pain. no
paresthesias or anesthesia. She denies weakness in lower ext.
She had a foley place today, but prior had no urinary retention.
No bowel incontinence. No upper ext neurologic sx or other
complaints. No cough. No SOB. No chest pain. Denies F/C. States
home dry weight is 210.

PERTINENT STUDIES THROUGHOUT HOSPITAL COURSE

STUDY: CT of the thoracic spine. [**2130-5-24**]

Compression fracture of the vertebral body of T7 is visualized
without
evidence of retropulsion or spinal cord compression. Soft tissue
density and mass effect is visualized in the paravertebral soft
tissues at this level with some low-density areas suggesting
necrotic changes, the possibility of a paravertebral mass is a
consideration; however, an abscess cannot be completely
excluded, this is a limited examination without contrast.
Bilateral ground-glass opacities, pleural effusion, and
plate-like atelectasis are noted. Correlation with a dedicated
CT of the chest is recommended if clinically warranted.

CT THORACIC SPINE WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST [**2130-5-29**]

IMPRESSION:
1. Severe compression deformity of T7, with paravertebral
abscess,
surrounding the aorta, and possibly extending into the left
pleural space. The appearance of the abscesses is similar to
prior study of [**2130-5-20**]. The extent of bilateral pleural
effusions, partially loculated on the left as well as bilateral
parenchymal opacities have slightly increased, when compared to
the prior study.

2. Mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy.

3. Thickened appearance of the esophagus with an air-fluid
level.

CT MYELOGRAM T-SPINE [**2130-6-7**]
IMPRESSION:

Compression deformity with moderate-to-severe spinal stenosis
and borderline cord compression at the T7 vertebral level.
Additionally, there is extensive inflammatory soft tissue
changes at the T7 level with decreased contrast transit time
during real-time myelography. Please see report of the cervical
and lumbar spines for additional information.

PATHOLOGY
SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: Bone vertebral body T7.

by
[**2130-6-9**] [**2130-6-10**] [**2130-6-14**] DR. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]/axg

DIAGNOSIS:

Bone, vertebral body:
1.  Osteonecrosis without associated acute inflammation.
Histologic features of osteomyelitis are not seen.
2.   Bone with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis and marrow
fibrosis.
3.   Degenerated fibrocartilage.

EEG [**2130-6-14**]
FINDINGS:
ABNORMALITY #1: Throughout the recording the background rhythm
was of
very low voltage such that no definite activity of cortical
origin could
be seen. There were frequent bursts of generalized slowing that
usually
correlated with respiratory or swallowing artifact by video
observation.
There was also extensive muscle and other artifact obscuring
large
portions of the background.
HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Could not be performed.
SLEEP: No normal waking or sleeping morphologies were seen.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the profoundly

suppressed background rhythms such that no activity of
definitely
cortical origin could be seen. This suggests a severe
encephalopathy.
Anoxia is one possible cause. Major medication effect is
another. The
recording cannot be judged as completely without brain activity
because
of the prominent background artifact. No epileptiform features
were
evident.

ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2130-6-14**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 0-10mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %) with
global hypokinesis and infero-lateral/apical akinesis. There is
no ventricular septal defect. with depressed free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Mild
