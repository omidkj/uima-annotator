DEATH SUMMARY:

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 76-year-old female
transferred to the Coronary Care Unit here at [**Hospital1 346**] initially under the care of Coronary
Care Unit Medical Team with history of left lower lobe
infiltrate, elevated white count to 22,000, nausea, vomiting,
and hypotension.  At the outside hospital the patient was
noted to have elevated in troponin to 4.8 and EKG changes
such as elevations in inferior leads.  Transesophageal
echocardiogram showed ejection fraction at 30% to 35% with
prior study of [**2182-6-1**], noting ejection fraction of 50% to
55%.  She was heparinized and transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for catheterization and further
management.

On presentation, the catheterization was consistent with
cardiogenic shock, notable for 95% stenosis in the proximal
LAD, 70% stenosis in the lateral circumflex, with a right
dominant system.  The patient was unable to be stented.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination on presentation revealed
the vital signs as follows:  temperature 96.8, heart rate 87
to 113 and irregular, blood pressure 110/61 to 95/54,
breathing at 24, saturation 94% on four liters.  HEENT:
Examination was remarkable for positive JVD, heart
irregularly irregular, S1 and S2 no rubs, gallops, or
murmurs.  LUNGS:  Diffuse rhonchi and wheezing throughout.
ABDOMEN:  Guaiac positive, diffuse tenderness to palpation.
EXTREMITIES:  Notable for a 2+ pitting edema bilaterally.
NEUROLOGICAL:  Examination was difficult to assess.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, three vessel disease, refusing
catheterization or coronary artery bypass graft in the past.
2.  Increased cholesterol.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
5.  Chronic atrial fibrillation.
6.  History of triple A.
7.  Arthritis.




MEDICATIONS ON PRESENTATION:
1.  Aspirin.
2.  Lopressor.
3.  Norvasc.
4.  Zestril.
5.  Lipitor.
6.  Zantac.
7.  Imdur.
8.  Lasix.
9.  Levofloxacin.
10. Nitroglycerin.
11. Heparin IV.

EKG on presentation was notable for atrial fibrillation at
107 beats per minute with a right axis deviation, normal
intervals, 1.5-mm ST elevations in leads 2, 3, and AVF;
0.5 -mm ST depressions in 1 and AVL.  Chest x-ray was notable
for left lower lobe opacity and perihilar infiltrates.

On [**2183-9-21**] the Department of Surgery was consulted for
question of ischemic bowel.  Recommendations:  CT abdomen and
pelvis, optimizing hemodynamic parameters.  The patient was
intubated for airway protection and respiratory failure on
[**2183-9-21**].  She was begun on Dopamine and Levophed for
hypertension.  Electrical cardioversion was attempted, yet
failed.  The patient was switched from Levophed to Pitressin
and Digoxin was begun for rate control of rapid atrial
fibrillation.

On [**2183-9-22**], Infectious Disease consultation was obtained
for worsening right cavitary lesion on chest x-ray.
Recommendations were Ciprofloxacin, Flagyl, Ceftazidime, and
Fluconazole.

On [**2183-9-23**], the patient experienced worsening respiratory
status.  MICU evaluation was obtained.  Vasopressin was
discontinued and the patient was transferred to the MICU
service for further pulmonary management as pulmonary issues
were her main focus at that time.

On [**2183-9-24**], the patient was begun on TPN for nutrition
requirements.  From [**2183-9-25**] to [**2183-9-26**], the patient
experienced a rising white count from 20 to 33, respiratory
requirements worsened.  Serum lactic acid levels rose to a
high of 12.4 likely due to ischemic valve secondary to
hypoperfusion.

On [**2183-9-26**], the patient was noted to be quite tenuous in
terms of hemodynamic and respiratory requirements.  In
consultation with the patient's family, the patient was made
DNR/DNI.





On [**2183-9-26**], the MICU service was called for the patient
unresponsive in asystole with no pulse or heart rate.  The
patient was declared dead on [**2183-9-26**] and the family was
contact[**Name (NI) **].
