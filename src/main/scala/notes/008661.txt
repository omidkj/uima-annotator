Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1390**]
Chief Complaint:
GI bleeding

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Exploratory laparotomy with small-bowel resection and primary

History of Present Illness:
48 year old female with a history of recurrent GI bleeds felt to
be secondary to NSAID induced ulceration who presents with
increased fatigue and shortness of breath, found to be anemic.

Ms. [**Known lastname 32130**] was hospitalized in [**Month (only) **] for melena and acute
anemia with profound drop in hematocrit to 21 from unclear
baseline. Her presentation was in the setting of recent
prescription of meloxicam for lateral epicondylitis. An EGD
performed during that admission did not reveal a source of
bleeding, and a capsule study was attempted but terminated early
secondary to equipment malfunction. She also had a GI bleed in
[**2118**], thought to be secondary to NSAIDs.  EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] at that time
also did see a source of active bleeding, but noted a Schatzki
ring in distal esophagus and diverticuli in sigmoid colon.

Patient was discharged on protonix and iron supplementation.
She has not had any NSAIDs since discharge.  She drinks very
little alcohol, rarely has an espresso, and usually drinks black
tea.  She reports that one week prior to admission, she was
unable to get a refill of her lansoprazole as her pharmacy ran
out of it.  She also stopped her iron pills as she was concerned
to take them without the PPI.  She was able to get lansoprazole
again two days prior to admission.  She reports that on the
thursday prior to admission, she "wasn't feeling good",
reporting an upset stomach similar to discomfort with prior GI
bleeds.  She restarted her iron pills at this time.  She notes
that over the past two days she has become increasingly fatigued
and short of breath with activity.  She reports "feeling
anemic," as she has in the past when her hematocrit is low.  She
reports pain in the center of her stomach which is [**2-22**], "small
zaps" and like "champagne bubbles."  Pain is not associated with
nausea or vomiting, and she has had a normal appetite.  She
reports hunger today.  She has lost approximately 5lbs in the
last several months, mostly during her last hospitalization.
She has three bowel movements a day, which is her baseline.  She
notes dark/black stools since sunday, which are different than
her dark stools with iron.  She denies bright red blood per
rectum.

In the ED inital vitals were 99.4 100 123/70 14 97% RA. Physical
exam was significant for black guaiac positive stool. Her labs
were significant for Hct 18 (discharge Hct 31), WBC 11.3,
creatinine 0.6.  She refused an NG lavage. She was typed and
crossed for 4 units. Two 18 gauge PIVs were placed. She was
given 1L NS.  GI was notified of her admission. She was started
on a protonix gtt. Vitals on transfer were significant for BP
132/75 HR 90s.

On arrival to the ICU, vital signs were T 100.4, HR 105, BP
124/78, RR 16, 100% on RA.  Patient was comfortable, reporting
[**2-22**] central stomach pain, no lightheadedness, no chest pain or
shortness of breath.  First unit of pRBCs hanging on arrival.

CT Abd/Pelvis [**2121-1-2**]:
IMPRESSION:

1. Enhancing intraluminal and extraluminal bilobed mass within
the mid to
proximal jejunum, corresponding to the mass observed on
endoscopy. No masses are present in the duodenum. Numerous lymph
nodes within the mesentery, but none are pathologically
enlarged.
2. No active bleeding from this jejunal mass or elsewhere in the
GI tract.
3. Sigmoid diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
4. Free fluid in the deep pelvis may be due to a ruptured
hemorrhagic cyst in the right adnexa.
5. Endoscopy capsule in the cecum.
6. Small hiatal hernia.


Brief Hospital Course:
46 yo F with history of recurrent GI bleeds presenting with
fatigue and anemia.

# GIB, SB mass: Patient has not had any BRBPR,
hematochezia/coffee ground emesis, however, does report dark
black stools (while on iron), which were guaiac positive in the
ER.  High concern for GIB.  During last admission, no source was
located in the upper GI system, however capsule study was not
performed.  As recent EGD was negative and patient has no risk
factors for UGIB (no NSAID use, infrequent alcohol use), low
suspicion for esophageal or gastric source.  In addition,
colonoscopy in [**2118**] showed only diverticuli, which
