Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Lower extremity edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with h/o CAD, CHF (EF of 25-30% per
report in [**2168**]), who presents with a 2 week history of worsening
lower extremity edema.  Per the patient and his nephew, the
patient was in his normal state of health until approximately 1
month ago.  At this time, the patient developed progressive
lower extremity edema, DOE, and fatigue, and presented to
[**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**] on [**9-7**].  While there, the patient was diuresed
with 40 mg IV Lasix [**Hospital1 **] and discharged to home with physical
therapy.  Two weeks later, the patient again presented to OSH
with a similar presentation and was again diuresed and returned
home.  Since this time, the patient states that his legs have
been increasing in size, he has had DOE, and he overall feels
extremely fatigued.  The patient states that he is taking 60 mg
of Lasix twice daily, and he has been faithful in taking this
medication.  The patient also denies dietary indiscretion, but
does admit to eating quite a lot of soup at home.
.
In the ED, the patient's VS were T 97.0, P 63, BP 135/80, R 20,
O2 99% on RA.  The patient received 40 mg IV Lasix and diuresed
well.  Cardiac enzymes were drawn, which were within his normal
range.  CXR was performed which showed a LLL effusion.  The
patient was then admitted to CC7 for further workup and
evaluation.
.
On review of systems, the patient denies he denies any prior
history of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding
at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough,
hemoptysis.  He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He
denies exertional buttock or calf pain, chest pain, paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope. All of the other review of systems were negative.
He endorses a prior stroke, GI Bleed.
.
.
.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with h/o CAD, CHF
(EF 20%), and multiple admissions recently for lower extremity
edema, who presents with a 2-week history of lower extremity
edema.
.
#. Congestive Heart Failure:  The patient has a h/o CHF, with an
EF of 20%.  The patient has had multiple admissions over the
past month for lower extremity edema.  He is currently taking 60
mg PO Lasix [**Hospital1 **], and he states that he has been faithful with
this regimen.  He does, however, endorse dietary indiscretion,
which may in fact be unawareness of what a low-sodium diet
entails.  On physical exam, the patient has 4+ pitting edema up
to his hips bilaterally, scrotal edema, and elevated JVP.  The
patient is most likely having a CHF exacerbation secondary to
likely dietary indiscretion v. worsening cardiac function s/p MI
v. medication non-compliance.
 - Lasix 60 mg IV now
 - Continue to measure accurate I/O q4h
 - Low-sodium diet with 1200 cc fluid restriction
 - Nutrition C/S for dietary education
 - TEDs in order to optimize preload.
 - Consider TTE in am in order to assess for further cardiac
dysfunction.
.
#. Acute Renal Failure:  Patient presented with Cr of 1.8, which
is elevated from his baseline of 1.5.  The patient is still
making urine, and he diuresed well to 40 mg IV Lasix.  On his
last admission at [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**], the patient's Cr increased in
the setting of diuresis.  It appears that patient's acute on
chronic renal failure is most likely a pre-renal etiology in the
setting of CHF and poor forward flow v. obstruction v. ATN/AIN.
 - Lasix 60 mg IV now and continue with plan for CHF as outlined
above
 - Send urine Na, Cr, and Urea in light of diuretic use to
calculate FeUrea
 - Continue to trend Cr and UOP
.
#. Coronary Artery Disease:  The patient has a h/o CAD.  He is
not currently having any symptoms of chest pain.  Cardiac
enzymes were elevated in the ED, though they appear to be at his
baseline (0.10) and the patient does not have any significant
ECG changes on admission.  The patient's troponins are most
likely elevated in the setting of acute renal failure.
 - Continue to monitor patient clinically
 - Repeat ECG in the am
 - Continue home dose of Metoprolol, NTG, Simvastatin
.
#. Gout:  Patient has a history of gout.  He currently takes
Allopurinol 300 mg daily at home.  Given the patient's renal
function, this dose was changed to Allopurinol 100 mg daily.
 - Continue lower dose of Allopurinol given ARF.
.
#. GERD:  Continue patient's home dose of Ranitidine.
.
#. FEN: Heart-healthy, low sodium, 1200 cc fluid restriction
diet.  Replete K > 4.0 and Mg > 2.0
.
#. Access:  PIV
.
#. PPx:
 - DVT: Heparin SQ
 - GI: Colace and Senna daily
 - Pain: Tylenol prn
.
#. Code:  DNR/DNI (confirmed with patient and health care proxy)
.
#. Dispo:  To home v. rehab pending evaluation of above.
