Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2763**]
Chief Complaint:
dizziness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bedside drainage of perirectal abscess

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 45 year old male with a PMHx of metastatic RCC

(papillary vs clear cell) to lungs & L pleural effusions s/p
multiple chemo regimens (most recently cycle 10 of bevacizumab +

erlotinib on [**2158-4-13**]), presents after a recent admission to
[**Hospital1 18**] for PNA now with dizziness and lightheadedness.

The patient was recently admitted from [**2158-4-10**] to [**2158-4-14**] for

dyspnea. He was started on a 14-day course of unasyn &
doxycycline for post-obstructive pna but was ultimately
discharged on augmentin. He did not, however, complete a 14-day
course; opting to stop  antibiotics on [**4-18**] in hopes of being
considered for a clinical  trial. He was screened for a clinical
trial for a novel  anti-PDL1 antibody that required him to hold
his tarceva for 3  weeks. During this time, he appears to have
clinically  deteriorated.

Most recently, he was admitted again from [**2158-5-10**] - [**2158-5-16**]
for
respiratory failure due to post obstructive pneumonia and
progressive metastatic disease to the lungs, as well as the
pleural effusion. He was given vanc/cefepime switched to
Levofloxacin for a total of 8 day course. CT scan showed mild
colitis affecting the distal descending and sigmoid colon. Stool

studies were negative for C. Diff, but he was empirically
treated
with Flagyl and completed a 2 week course of treatment.

He was again admitted from [**5-22**] to [**5-26**] for hypotension. He was
initially started on vanco/zosyn/azithromycin out of concern for
possible sepsis (given patient has recent pneumonia requiring
intubation). Antibiotics were stopped given rapid improvement of
his hypotension and it was thought his hypotension/fever was
felt to be related to underlying RCC and immulogical response by
his primary outpatient oncologist. The patient was started on
Prednisone 40mg daily on discharge.

Since being discharged, he has had increased pain in his
perineum and was evaluated by a surgeon yesterday who
recommended aspiration of a potential abscess today. He has been
n.p.o. since midnight in anticipation of the procedure. He woke
this morning and developed some lightheadedness which he has had
previously with dehydration. He denies chest pain, shortness of
breath, palpitations. He denies fever, nausea, vomiting. He
called EMS and was on a blood pressure that was not palpable
peripherally and a heart rate in the 160s, he was given a 1.5 L
of fluid in the field with improvement of his blood pressure to
be 80s and his heart rate to the 120s.

In the ED, his VS were T 97.9 HR 120 BP 83/51 RR 16 SpO2 99%/4L.
Labs significant for WBC count of 11.9, with 94% neutrophils.
Lactate 2.4. INR 1.7. Colorectal surgery was called and
recommend a CT abdomen. CT showed diffuse colitis from cecum to
hepatic flexure and stable metastatic disease, no focal abscess.
 Blood and urine culutres were drawn. Given 5L NS IV.  Of note,
pt refused CVL.  Given Flagyl, will give CTX. Colorectal
following.  On transfer, VS were BP 107/59 HR 112.  No fevers
but immunosuppressed, on chemo.

On arrival to the ICU, pt is resting in bed, appears to be in
pain.  States she has pain in his lower abdomen, perineum.
Rates it [**7-9**].  States the Dilaudid IV that he got in the ED
helped but wore off.  Also, endorses diarrhea but not bloody or
dark stools.  Denies fevers.

Brief Hospital Course:
45 M w metastatic RCC (papillary vs clear cell) to lungs & L
pleural effusions s/p multiple chemo regimens (most recently
cycle 10 of bevacizumab + erlotinib on [**2158-4-13**]), presents after
multiple recent admissions to [**Hospital1 18**] for PNA, presented with
hypotension and evidence of colitis on CT found to be Cdiff
positive.
.
# Hypotension: Initially thought to be [**3-2**] poor PO vs
distributive physiology from cdiff infection/rectal abscess.
Also considered adrenal insufficiency given patient on
Prednisone taper and adrenal lesion on previous imaging. He
received stress dose steroids and was subsequently transitioned
back to his home dose prednisone.  Also, end-stage RCC could be
presenting with immunologic response that is causing this
hypotension. Patient??????s blood pressures remained in the 80s-100s
systolic despite fluid resuscitation and downtrending lactate.
Bedside echo did not show evidence of tamponade. His underlying
infection was treated with antibiotics.  In terms of his
tachycardia, patient remained tachycardic despite adequate fluid
resuscitation. His tachycardia is likely multifactorial from
pain, underlying infec
