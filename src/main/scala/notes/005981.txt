CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 70-year-old African
American male with extensive cardiac history including CABG
with redo CABG, and transferred from outside hospital for
acute coronary syndrome.  The patient presented to outside
hospital on [**2160-7-20**] after experiencing chest pain at rest
with only minimal relief from six sublingual nitroglycerins
and patient with associated diaphoresis and nausea.  He was
made pain free with IV nitroglycerin and Morphine.

While at outside hospital, however, his chest pain would
recur at rest with attempted titration of his nitroglycerin
drip.  He ruled in for myocardial infarction with peak
troponin of 4.89, peak CK 86, and received Integrilin for 24
hour duration.  Upon transfer, the patient was chest pain
free on nitroglycerin drip.  He stated no shortness of
breath, nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis.  He does complain
of loose stools [**2-5**]/day and decreased appetite.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease status post CABG in [**2145**].  Redo
CABG [**2150**] at [**Hospital1 69**].
Catheterization [**2157-9-30**] which showed three vessel coronary
artery disease, LMCA diffusely diseased, LAD and left circ
severely diseased and totally occluded proximally.  RCA
diffusely diseased and totally occluded proximally.
Saphenous vein angiography revealed patent graft to LAD,
which supplied collaterals to left circ and distal RCA and
patent graft to posterolateral branch.  Ejection fraction
approximately 40%.  Catheterization [**12-7**] at [**Hospital6 3426**] revealed only patent saphenous vein graft to LAD,
with collateral flow to lateral wall into distal right
circulation, ejection fraction approximated between 30-40%.
2. Cerebrovascular accident with residual right hemiparesis
in [**2150**].
3. Left leg claudication.
4. Diabetes mellitus type 2.
5. Diabetic nephropathy.
6. Asthma.
7. Low back pain.
8. Hypertension.
9. Adrenal adenoma.
10. Hypercholesterolemia.
11. Malaria in [**2110**].
12. Bayonet wound to right lower abdomen in Korean War.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Retired from the Air Force.  Aromatic
engineer, married, quit tobacco in [**2130**], and no alcohol use.

ALLERGIES:
1. Contrast dye requires premedication for catheterization.
2. Sulfa.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Acebutolol 200 mg [**Hospital1 **].
2. Imdur 120 mg q day increased to 150 mg q day at outside
hospital.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.4, blood pressure
100/50, heart rate 61, respiratory rate 14, sating 95% on 2
liters, 94-97% on room air.  In general, alert and oriented
times three in no acute distress.  Heart:  Regular, rate, and
rhythm with very distant heart sounds, 1/6 systolic murmur.
Jugular venous distention to earlobe.  Lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen is obese, soft, nontender,
normal bowel sounds.  Extremities:  1+ edema bilaterally, 1+
distal pulses bilaterally.  Left groin with soft bruit.

LABORATORIES:  White count 8.7, hematocrit 41.1, platelets
208, INR is 1.2.  Potassium 4.4, BUN 25, creatinine 1.3,
glucose 183, calcium 9, phosphorus 3.5, magnesium 1.8.
Troponin and CK trending down from outside hospital.

CHEST X-RAY:  No evidence of congestive heart failure.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Normal sinus rhythm, rate 60, left bundle
branch block present on prior electrocardiograms.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]
service after having failed medical management at outside
hospital.  He was continued on nitroglycerin drip and Heparin
drip.  Patient continued to have intermittent chest pain when
nitroglycerin drip was titrated down.  When he self
discontinued his nitroglycerin drip, he experienced 8/10
chest pain with dynamic changes on his electrocardiogram.
For this reason, he was started on Integrilin until
catheterization.

On [**2160-7-28**], catheterization revealed patent saphenous vein
graft to LAD graft with a 30% eccentric stenosis distal to
touchdown.  Site with collaterals to the left territory.
Patient also noted to have retrograde LAD filling to D1 and
several septal branches, mid LAD with a 90% stenosis had PTCA
done with a 20% residual and good flow to collaterals.

Patient was sent to CCU postcatheterization for a balloon
pump.  He remained chest pain free after intervention and was
successfully titrated off of nitroglycerin drip, and
transferred back to the floor.  His medical regimen was
optimized and he was discharged to home on [**2160-7-31**] after
consulting with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] regarding potential enrollment in
angiogenesis protocol.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Extensive coronary artery disease.
2. Acute coronary syndrome.
3. Successful percutaneous transluminal angioplasty to left
anterior descending artery.
