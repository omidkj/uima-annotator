Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2197-10-13**] where
the patient underwent mitral valve replacement with 25mm St.
[**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical prosthesis.  Overall the patient tolerated the
procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU
in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
Vancomycin was used for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis, as she
was inpatient for greater than 24 hours.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.
Heparin was initiated as a bridge to coumadin for mechanical
valve.  When INR was therapeutic, heparin was discontinued.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication.  She did develop a leukocytosis.  She remained
afebrile and was found to have [**Female First Name (un) **] vaginitis.  She was
treated with miconazole.  The patient was evaluated by the
physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD 5, the patient was
ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled
with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged to home wiht
VNA nursing and physical therapy services in good condition with
appropriate follow up instructions.
