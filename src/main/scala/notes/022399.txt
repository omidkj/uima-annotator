Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This is a 55 year old female with ICM (EF 20%), s/p AICD, STEMI,
CRI (Cr baseline 1.5), adrenal insufficiency, hemorrhagic
pancreatitis, recent complicated hospital course ([**8-2**] -[**10-19**])
after transfer from OSH with large pancreatic pseudocyst,
phlegmon and right flank fluid collection (VRE, pseudomonas,
strep viridans) s/p drainage and multiple abx, course c/b ARF
requiring CVVH, hypotension, VT, C diff, UTI, respiratory
distress with intubation, then trach, now presents from rehab
with abdominal pain. Pt is DNR/DNI. Her abdominal pain has been
similar in quality for several weeks but worsening yesterday. No
fevers/chills. Chronic diarrhea. C diff positive at rehab.
.
Please refer to recent discharge summary for detailed course of
her hospital stay from [**8-2**] to [**10-19**]. Of note, she has been
treated with Flagyl, then PO vanc for C diff colitis; with
linezolid, then daptomycin (b/o leukopenia on linezolid) for VRE
in fluid collection; with Zosyn, later aztreonam for
Pseudomonas; with meropenem for Pseudomonas and Klebsiella UTI
and Pseudomonas in her sputum.
.
At rehab, she has been on the vent (AC 500x10, FiO2 28%, PEEP of
5) with difficulties to wean due to hypoxia. No increased
secretions per verbal report from rehab. She has been maintained
on IV Flagyl for positive C diff in her stool. She was on
Imipenem until [**11-1**]. In adddition, she was started on Levaquin
on [**10-8**] for a 5 day course per rehab records. Her chronic
abdominal pain worsened on day of admission when it was decided
to reverse her DNH status.
.
In the ED, her VS were T95.6, HR76, BP 120/80, RR21, 100% on TM.
No rebound or guarding but tender to RUQ. Greenish stool that
was guaiac negative. General surgery was consulted. Next of [**Doctor First Name **]
was [**Name (NI) 653**], confirmed DNR/DNI but abx and lines okay. UA was
positive for infection. Lactate was 2.1. Cr 3.4 up from 1.7. WBC
18.2 with left shift. Normal pancreatic enzymes and AST, ALT. AP
of 489 and LDH of 405. Trop 0.76 but normal CK and MB. EKG
without acute changes. CXR and portable abdomen with no acute
findings.
.
30 minutes after she arrived in the ED, her BP dropped to 60s
systolic. A RIJ cordis was placed during which a NE gtt was
transiently infused. She received a total of approximately 7 L
IVF with stabilization of her BP in the 100s/60s. Pt received
one dose of Meropenem, Vanc and Aztreonam and was admitted to
the ICU for further management.

CT ABD & Pelvis:
ABDOMEN:  Small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent
atelectasis appear similar.  There is decreased patchy opacity
at both lung bases, suggesting interval improvement in pulmonary
edema.  Cardiac pacing wires remain.  A nasogastric tube is
coiled in the gastric fundus.

The liver, spleen, and adrenal glands appear grossly
unremarkable.  Dependent hyperdensity in the gallbladder suggest
small stones.  Punctate calcifications in both kidneys are
compatible with nonobstructing renal calculi.

There has been interval removal of a pigtail catheter from a
peripancreatic fluid collection, which now contains no air.  It
measures 8.2 x 5.1 cm, compared to 9.7 x 6.1 cm.  Again, normal
pancreatic parenchyma is difficult to separate from this fluid
collection, with only a small amount seen in the head region.

The perisplenic collection measures 5.4 x 3.9 cm, compared to
4.8 x 4.2 cm on the prior study.  A right flank collection
demonstrates near complete
collapse.  A left pericolonic collection is also smaller.  There
has been
interval increase in simple ascites in the abdomen and pelvis,
which is
moderate in degree. However, no new fluid collections are seen.

Scattered non-pathologically enlarged celiac axis,
retroperitoneal and
mesenteric lymph nodes appear similar, with unchanged moderate
stranding of the peripancreatic fat.  There is no bowel
dilatation to suggest obstruction. Atheromatous calcification of
the aorta is moderate, without aneurysm.

PELVIS:  A Foley catheter decompresses the bladder.  The uterus
is not well evaluated.  The rectum is within normal limits.
There are scattered sigmoid diverticula, without additional
findings to suggest diverticulitis.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES AND SOFT TISSUES:  There are no suspicious
lytic or blastic lesions. There is evidence of remote fracture
of the right inferior pubic ramus. Diffuse stranding of the
subcutaneous fat suggests anasarca.

Impressions:
1.  Overall, slight interval decrease in the peripancreatic and
additional
fluid collections, with slight interval increase in ascites,
which is moderate in amount.
2.  No evidence of superimposed acute process within the abdomen
or pelvis.
3.  Scattered nonobstructing renal calculi and sigmoid
diverticulosis, as
before.

CXR:
The tracheostomy is central with again demonstrated
over-inflated tracheostomy cuff.  The biventricular pacemaker
leads are in expected unchanged position.  The right PICC line
tip terminates in mid SVC.  The heart size is moderately
enlarged.  There is overall increase in vascular engorgement
suggesting worsening of pulmonary edema/fluid overload.  The
bilateral pleural effusions are present also slightly increased.


Impression:  Worsening of pulmonary congestion.
