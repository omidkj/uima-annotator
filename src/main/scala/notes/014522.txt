Brief Hospital Course:
40 YO F with history of HTN, EtOH pancreatitis s/p CCY,
alcoholic hepatitis, admitted for weakness, difficulty walking
and persistent hepatitis and hyperbilirubinemia.

# Altered Mental Status: On [**11-10**] patient was noted to be more
confused, with difficulty answering complex questions.  This was
different than the first 5 days of her admission.  Electrolytes
were checked and no evidence of infection was present.  Given
history of liver insufficiency, all sedating medications
(Clonazepam / Compazine) were discontinue and Lactulose was
increased.  On [**11-11**] AM she was noted to be minimally responsive
and with 0/5 strength in UE bilaterally.  Noncontrast CT head
was without acute abnormalities.  Neurology was consulted and
recommened EEG.  EEG revealed evidence of nonconvulsive status
epilepticus.  She was then loaded with Keppra and transferred to
the ICU. In the ICU she was taken off of all sedation to assess
mental status, but she showed no improvement.  She developed
edema and in brain noted on repeat CT scan.  Her sodium levels
increased to 160s was corrected and increased again, possibly
due to a central diabetes insipidus. On [**11-17**] around noon,
neurology evaluated her for brain death.  She had no cerebral
reflexes and was apneic.  She was declared brain dead. Family
consented to autopsy.

# Weakness:  Likely multifactorial etiology including chronic
anemia, malnutrition and possibly alcohol consumption. Also with
low blood pressure and reporting poor po intake resulting in
dehydration.  Elevated lactate and history of EtOH may indicate
underlying thiamine deficiency as well.  Exam nonfocal.  Initial
weakness attributed to malnutrition, vitamin deficiency and
phsyical decline.  Per discussion with primary care physician,
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] had been very diligent about taking vitamins until a
traumatic event in [**2133-1-6**] when she began drinking
alcohol.  She has had significant functional decline in the last
10 months.

# Hepatitis/hyperbilirubinemia: Current thinking is alcoholic
hepatitis vs. NASH. ALT/AST and AP lower now than on prior
admission, but bilirubin higher (6.8).  Labs suggest
cholestasis, but no ductal dilitation on prior cholangiogram.
[**Doctor First Name **], AMA, [**Last Name (un) 15412**] negative.  Hepatits A and C serologies negative,
Hep B surface antigen positive.  On last admission, evaluation
revealed patient had a biopsy steatosis, ballooning
degeneration, neutrophilic invasion, AST/ALT ratio ( ~ >2) and
history that supports the diagnosis of alcoholic
steatohepatitis. The patient denied heavy alcohol consumption.
Also with a history of a gastric bypass operation with severe
nutritional deficiency that corroborates a diagnosis of NASH.
Continue on Ursodial and Lactulose.  Also given Vitamin K po for
three days.
.
# Nutritional Deficiency: On last admission noted to have
atrophic
macroglossia, angular cheilitis, a macrocytic anemia and a
vitamin K responsive elevated INR. Supplemented with Thiamine,
Folate, Zinc, B-12 and a Multivitamin.

# Alcoholism: On last admission, Nutrition, SW and primary team
provided counseling on this issue, but patient deferred formal
assistance post-discharge.  Denied any alcohol use in month
since last admission.

# s/p Roux-en-Y: With history of malnutrition. Supplemented diet
as above.  Per discussion with primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
had been very dili
