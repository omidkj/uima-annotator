History of Present Illness:
70F with ESRD on hemodialysis (MWF) at [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name 9449**] Dialysis
Center who was at HD on day of admission when they noticed
difficulty with flow through her HD catheter. After receiving
tPA through her HD catheter she began to develop fevers to 103.5
and rigors. Blood cultures were drawn at HD; she was given 1g
Vanco, 650mg Tylenol, and 80mg IV Gentamicin and sent to the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED. Had 1 week of nonproductive cough, without any other
localizing infectious sx's. No odynophagia, N/V/diarrhea,
dysuria, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea. No CP, abd pain, SOB,
dyspnea, PND, orthopnea, LE edema.  In the ED, her VS were
102.2, 161/66, 100, 97%RA. She had blood cx's drawn peripherally
and was admitted to medicine for further w/u.

On the floor, 2/2 blood cultures grew out pan-sensitive
Enterobacter on [**9-19**]. Her HD line was d/c'ed on [**9-20**], and the
tip grew Enterobacter and pan-sensitive Serratia. She was
initially placed on vancomycin on [**9-19**], and received one dose
each of Levofloxacin 250mg IV and aztreonam 500mg IV qday when
blood cultures grew GNR. Once growth was speciated on [**9-21**],
vanc/aztreonam stopped, and Ciprofloxacin 400mg IV qday was
started. She received 7 days of PO/IV Cipro, and subsequent BCx
on [**9-21**] and [**9-27**] were negative. Her course was complicated by
positive HIT (platelets 86 at admission from baseline 189 [**6-28**]),
and had been on intermittent argatroban under the supervision of
hematology. Argatroban was held from [**9-23**] to [**9-26**] due to guaiac
positive brown stool mild hemoptysis, then restarted on [**9-26**]. A
serotonin release assay is pending. A head CT was done on [**9-24**]
for occipital HA, and was negative for bleed. On [**9-26**], a new
tunneled RIJ HD catheter was placed. She also started
experiencing increasing leukocytosis with worsening right knee
pain, abdominal pain, and throat pain. A KUB demonstrated no
free air, and a tap of the right knee by rheumatology was most
c/w OA (normal wbc count when adjusted for rbc, no crystals).
Ms. [**Known lastname 46452**] also began experiencing worsening delerium and
agitation. Out of concern by ID for Cipro-induced delerium, her
antibiotics were changed to gentamicin on [**9-28**]. Reglan was also
d/c'ed as possible contributing factor to delerium.

On the evening of [**9-28**], Ms. [**Known lastname 46452**] received a total of 7mg IV
Haldol for agitation. On the morning of [**9-29**], she was noted to
have increasing periods of witnessed apnea and desaturations to
mid-80s. Her sats climbed after reawakening, and responded to 2L
O2 NC. She also c/o R shoulder pain and could not move her
shoulder more than 30 degrees. Rheumatology recommended U/S of
the shoulder to assess for effusion, due to concern of septic
joint, though thought hematogenous seeding of the joint was
unlikely since all recent BCx have been negative. Due to
increasing delerium and nursing needs and episodes of apnea and
desaturations, she was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for observation.

In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was initially intubated for apnea and
respiratory distress. She was diagnosed with Ecoli pneumonia and
continued to have increasing thick tan secretions. Ceftriaxone
was d/ced on [**10-13**] and changed to Meropenem/Vanco Day 1 [**10-13**] due
to increasing secretions and fever spike to 102 on [**10-13**].

She was briefly extubated on [**2136-10-6**], but had to be reintubated
after 30 min because of stridor and respiratory distress. She
was found to have increased soft tissue vs upper airway edema,
CT neck showed soft tissue completely surrounding the ETT in the
upper airway. She is scheduled for trach on [**10-15**].

She was diagnosed with SVC syndrome, via CT venogram which
showed SVC clot and RIJ clot, and is s/p SVC stent placement
with improvement of upper extremity edema. Etiology of SVC
syndrome is unknown. Since patient is thought to be false
positive for HIT and does not have a true heparin allergy, she
is maintained on heparin gtt for SVC syndrome.
Hypercoagulability workup was planned as an outpatient.

Her mental status was last at baseline (walking, talking,
communicating clearly, socializing with family, very mild
dementia) three weeks ago and before initial intubation and [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
transfer, per daughters and son in law. CT head showed no
cerebral edema as repercussion of SVC syndrome, and no stroke,
but showed a lateral ventricle lesion of unclear significance.

Her blood pressure was very labile, ranging from SBP 70-200,
becoming hypertensive when sedation is low and hypotensive with
increased sedation, especially with propofol which was no longer
used. Zyprexa appeared to work well for agitation.

Pertinent Results:
Head CT [**9-19**]: No acute intracranial hemorrhage. Chronic small
vessel ischemia. Possible empty sella, correlate clinically.

CXR [**9-19**]:Overall unchanged appearance of the chest with faint
interstitial opacities in the lower lobes, which can be due to
atelectasis, however, mild edema cannot be totally excluded.
Slightly bent appearance of the distal catheter, which can be
positional, please check the patency of the line.

[**9-29**] portable CXR: Vascular catheter remains in standard
position.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable in
appearance.  No focal areas of consolidation are identified, but
standard PA and lateral views of the chest would be more
sensitive and may be helpful for more complete evaluation given
clinical suspicion for infection.

[**9-28**] Knee film: End-stage osteoarthritic changes involving
predominantly the medial compartment.  No acute bony injury.

[**9-27**] KUB: No evidence of obstruction.

[**9-25**] TTE: The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 60-70%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened, with focal
thickening of the right cusp. An aortic valve vegetation/ma
