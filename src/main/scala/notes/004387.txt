Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4765**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Cardiac catheterization with stent placement
2. Central line placement


History of Present Illness:
57 yo man with renal cancer metastatic to the lungs receiving
IL-2 therapy with multiple cardiac risk factors including
tobacco use, +FHx of MI by father in his 50s, possibly
uncontrolled cholesterol, HTN, and overweight developed acute
substernal CP the morning of admission. EKG showed Lateral ST
elevations in leads I & aVL along with a new Left IVCD.
Cardiology was called for urgent consultation. The patient had
an ECHO which only showed a mildly depressed EF of 40-45% but
had mild hypokinesis of inferior/lateral walls. Cardiology
initially felt that the patient is not a cardiac catheterization
candidate b/c of his low platelets and high creatinine. The
patient will be medically treated in the ICU to monitor for
ongoing CP & cardiac monitoring.

He was intially admitted on [**9-1**] for elective IL-2 infusions for
treatment of metastatic renal cell ca. He had a central line
placed by general surgery on [**9-1**], started IL-2 infusions, and
had 12 infusions over last few days, last given [**2188-9-5**] at 8 am.
His hospital course was complicated by temp to 102 on [**9-2**]
(thought to be infusion-related), ongoing diarrhea,
nausea/vomiting (given anzemet), and acute renal failure
(treated w/ fluids). He had an episode of hypotension the day
prior to admission (thought to be IL-2 related) and was briefly
on neo from [**12-20**] pm yesterday. Two doses of IL-2 were held [**1-16**]
hypotension. The morning of admission/transfer, he patient
complained of substernal chest pain and had EKG changes
described above. He was given 1 SL nitro, aspirin, with
alleviation of pain. Trop >7, CK pending.

In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient awoke with 2/10 CP ("fullness" more
than CP), nonradiating, pleuritic in nature. The pain was
previously worse and improved with SL NTG. He denied SOB, F/C,
N/V, abdominal pain, diaphoresis.

Past Medical History:

-- follow up CT [**5-18**] w/ slight but definitive increase in most
of his
lungs nodules since the previous study with the largest
increasing from ten millimeters to 13 mm
-- presented for onc eval here by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**6-17**], planned
for IL-2 this admission.
2. HTN
3. Hyperlipidemia

this admission. +50 pack yr hx of smoking. Weekend use of EtOH-
no Hx of abuse, no IVDU. Wife with patient in room (she is
emergency RN at OSH). Has 2 children.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment: 57 yo man with metastatic renal cancer to the lungs
s/p IL-2 treatment with STEMI s/p stenting of LAD and LCX
complicated by respiratory distress requiring intubation.

Hospital course is reviewed by problem:

1. STEMI vs. myocarditis: Initially it was unclear whether his
chest pain was secondary to an STEMI or myocarditis. However,
after the cardiac catheterization that showed LAD and LCx
disease, as well as the elevated cardiac enzymes and improvement
in chest pain with stents, this was most likely an STEMI.
Initially, this was medically managed due to high creatinine and
low platelets, but he continued to have chest pain. The patient
underwent stenting of the lesions in his LAD and LCx. He was
started on ASA and plavix, metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **], and pravastatin
20mg. This was initially held given a transaminitis, but after
discussion with the primary oncology team he was placed on the
statin. It is possible that the STEMI was a side effect of the
IL-2 therapy. This has been reported once in the past and is
thought to be secondary to the significant cytokine effect. As
such, he was determined to be a poor candidate for future IL-2
therapy.
.
2. Congestive heart failure: The patient initially was
transferred to the CCU with clinical volume overload. He was
able to autodiurese and did not need to be continued on lasix.
He had an ECHO which showed an EF of 30-35% with new anterior
wall hypokinesis.
.
3. Respiratory distress: He was noted to be in respiratory
distress and needed to be intubated. This was likely secondary
to volume overload, and he was shortly extubated. He was off any
oxygen at discharge.
.
4. Hypotension: He had several episodes of hypotension while in
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. He initially needed to be treated with pressors, but
this eventually resolved and he was taken off the drips. The
hypotension was thought to be secondary to decreased SVR.
Etiology could have been sepsis - his sputum cx grew GNRs. Blood
and urine cx negative. He was not treated with any antibiotics,
but his hypotension resolved.
.
5. Acidosis: He was noted to have a nongap acidosis, which
resolved. This was thought to be secondary to a renal cause.
.
6. Renal cell cancer: He was treated with IL-2 therapy, then
supportive care once he was post-chemo. He was followed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1729**], who decided that they would not continue any more
iterations of IL-2, given that it may have precipitated his MI.
The patient was discharged with oncology outpatient follow-up.
.
7. Acute renal failure: He was noted to have an elevation in his
creatinine, with the peak at 3.4. This was likely secondary to
IL-2, and it fell after treatment to 1.3 on discharge.
.
8. Acute liver failure: This was also thought likely secondary
to IL-2 or shock-liver from an MI. His LFTs trended down after
his catheterization, with significantly lower values at
discharge (ALT 64, AST 36, LDH 673, AP 139, TBili 2.8 from 128,
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 64407**], 155, 7.3 respectively).
.
9. Elevated amylase and lipase - amylase and lipase were
elevated to 172 and 641. This may have been secondary to
pancreatitis from low flow state to pancreas during MI. During
the hospitalization, he denied nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
and did not have any difficulty with po intake.
.
10. Thrombocytopenia: Likely secondary to IL-2. Plt count
dropped to 21 but were in the 90s at discharge.
.
11. Leukocytosis: He was noted to
