Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Aspirin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7760**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain, acute abdomen, Meckel diverticulitis.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Exploratory laparotomy, ileal and cecal resection
and gastrostomy tube
Exploratory laparotomy with abdominal wash-out
Flexible bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 87-year-old male who presented to the [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with complaints of abdominal pain. He
was found to have small
bowel thickening and free-fluid. Because of his physical exam
findings and radiographic evidence, surgery was indicated. He
had evidence of a Meckel diverticulum with surrounding small
bowel wall thickening. The diagnosis of a possible perforated
Meckel's versus small bowel ischemia given his atrial
fibrillation were discussed with the patient. In [**Location (un) 620**], he was
difficult to intubate resulting in hemorrhage from his upper
airway. There was a large amount of clot that almost completely
occluded his endotracheal tube, and for this reason he required
tracheostomy in order to secure the airway. This was performed
in [**Location (un) 620**]. Because of the concern for impending airway
obstruction, he was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for thoracic
surgical consultation
and further surgical treatment.

Past Medical History:
Coronary artery disease, CABG status post stent, atrial
fibrillation, dyslipidemia, BPH, negative colonoscopy more than
10 years ago per patient.  History of upper GI bleeding in
[**2130-1-2**] secondary to esophageal ulceration/[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]

[**8-24**] Pathology: Ileum and cecum:
Ischemic bowel with Meckel's diverticulum.
Resection margins viable

[**8-25**] CTA Chest: FINDINGS: There is mild asymmetry with mild
thickening of the right true vocal cord. Soft tissue hypodense
material anterior to the vallecula and posterior to the hyoid
displaces the airway towards the left side. This could represent
pooling of secretion and/or edema. The cricoid, thyroid and
hyoid cartilage are intact. Tracheostomy tube is in place. There
is pooling of secretion superior to the tracheostomy cuff. There
are increasing number of prevascular and mediastinal lymph nodes
in all the stations. Individually none of them measure more than
1 cm. The aorta is normal in caliber. Cardiac size is normal.
Dense coronary calcifications are in the LAD, left circumflex
arteries. Mild calcification is in the aortic valve. Transvenous
pacemaker leads terminate in standard position in the right
atrium and right ventricle. There is a trace of pericardial
fluid. There are bilateral layering small pleural effusions
greater in the left side. Relaxation atelectases are in the left
lower lobe. Extensive pneumonic consolidation is in the right
lower lobe. A smaller peribronchial consolidation is also
present in the right middle lobe.
OG tube tip is in the stomach. There is a small quantity of
ascites. Imaged portions of the liver, spleen, adrenal glands
and right kidney are unremarkable. In the upper pole of the left
kidney an exophytic hypodense lesion is too small to be
characterized.
A hypodense nodule in the left lobe of the thyroid measures 17
mm.
There are compression fractures in lower vertebral bodies.
IMPRESSION:
Multifocal pneumonia.
Mediastinal lymphadenopathy likely reactive.
Coronary calcifications.
Asymmetry with thickening of the right true vocal cord likely
due to edema, but direct inspection may be helpful if warranted
clinically.
Edema and/or pooling secretions anterior to the vallecula
displacing the airway towards the left side as described.
Bilateral pleural effusions.

[**8-25**] Abd Duplex U/S: FINDINGS:  No comparison is available.  The
study is limited secondary to overlying bowel gas, but the
origin of the SMA is identified and Doppler color flow
demonstrates patency and normal waveform morphology with brisk
systolic upstroke and normal diastolic flow.  The velocity could
not be obtained secondary to the inability to adequately
angle-adjust. The [**Female First Name (un) 899**] could not be identified.  The celiac
artery was not evaluated.
IMPRESSION:  Patent proximal superior mesenteric artery.

[**8-29**] ECHO: Findings:
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement. No LA mass/thrombus (best
excluded by TEE).
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. A catheter
or pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV. The
patient is mechanically ventilated. Cannot assess RA pressure.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global
systolic function (LVEF >55%). No resting LVOT gradient.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Normal RV systolic
function.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in
aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter.
AORTIC VALVE: Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets.
Minimally increased
gradient c/w minimal AS. Mild (1+) AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets. No MVP. Mild mitral
annular
calcification. Mild (1+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild to
moderate [[**1-3**]+] TR.  Moderate PA systolic hypertension.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No left atrial mass/thrombus
seen (best  excluded by transesophageal echocardiography). Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall motion. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is minimal
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Minimal aortic valve stenosis. Mild aortic
regurgitation. Mild mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Right ventricular cavity
enlargement with preserved systolic function.
This constellation of findings is suggestive of an acute
pulmonary process (e.g., pulmonary embolism, pneumonia,
bronchospasm).

[**8-29**] CTA Torso: CONCLUSION:
1.  Interval increase in the bibasilar effusions and pulmonary
atelectasis
along with new confluent ground glass opacities in both lungs is
in keeping with the known recent pulmonary hemorrhage.
2.  Intrathoracic mediastinal lymphadenopathy is unchanged since
the prior
examination.  No abdominal pelv
