Admission Date:  [**2177-9-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2177-9-30**]


Service: NEUROSURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**]
Chief Complaint:
87 yo  F w/ enlarging R frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tracheostomy
PEG
subclavian CVC with change over wire x1
arterial line
bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
The pt is an 87 year-old female who initially presented on
[**2177-9-16**] to an outside hospital after her family noticed a change
in her mental status, aphasia, and incontinence. Records
indicate that the patient was "confused" upon arrival to OSH,
but noted to be oriented to name although unable to verbally
answer questions, and unable to follow commands. A CT scan of
the head at the OSH
revealed a right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with
midline
shift. Also noted was a 1.2cm basilar artery aneurysm unrelated
to bleed. The
patient was intubated for airway protection at this point and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

Past Medical History:
-hypertension
-COPD
-Osteoarthritis
-Hypothyroidism

Social History:
The patient lives alone.
She is independent in ADLs.


Family History:
[**Name (NI) 1094**] mother died of mesentery thrombosis.
No h/o malignancy.
No h/o stroke.

eyes to painful stimuli.
-Cranial nerves: PERRL 3 to 2 mm directly and consensually, EOM
intact to oculocephalic maneuver, corneal reflexes present
bilaterally.  No obvious facial asymmetry.

bilaterally.


Pertinent Results:
CT Head ([**2177-9-16**]):
Large right frontal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage, which has
enlarged since the prior examination performed 3 hours earlier.
There is now intraventricular blood. There is associated mild
subfalcine herniation. There is a large 1-cm basilar artery
aneurysm.

CT Head ([**2177-9-17**]):
1. Persistent large right intracranial frontal hematoma, with
mass effect and shift of normally midline structures, associated
with subfalcine herniation.
2. blood in the left sylvian fissure, which may be
redistribution of
subarachnoid blood previously present. No evidence of new
hemorhage..
3. New area of low density in the left occipital lobe,
representing new left posterior cerebral artery infarction. This
may be due to compression of PCA due to mass effect from the
above mentioned hematoma, or alternatively, thromboembolic event
due to basilar aneurysm.
4. 8 mm dilatation of the basilar aneurysm, representing
thrombosed and
calcified aneurysm as described previously.

CT Head ([**2177-9-18**]):
Again noted is a large right frontal parenchymal hemorrhage,
which is
unchanged in appearance since the previous study.  There is a
left occipital lobe infarction, which extends to the midline.
This
is unchanged in extent compared to the previous study .

Brief Hospital Course:
The pt is an 87 year-old female with a history of hypertension
who presented to OSH with altered mental status and was
discovered to have a large right frontal intraparenchymal
hemorrhage with intraventricular extension and incidental left
basilar anuerysm unrelated to IPH on intial head CT.  A CT scan
was performed on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] which revealed that the area
of hemorrhage had enlarged since the
prior examination performed at the OSH 3 hours earlier. It was
also noted that there was intraventricular extension of the
bleed and associated mild subfalcine herniation. There was also
note of a large 1-cm basilar artery aneurysm. Repeat CT scan on
the next hospital day demonstrated stable size of the hemorrhage
but an area of low density in the left occipital lobe,
representing likely left posterior cerebral artery infarction.
In a meeting with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the ICU team, the patient's
family decided not to proceed with surgery. Neurology was
consulted for likelyhood of recovery from the IPH, reporting
that they thought prognosis would be poor. The patient was
closely monitored in the ICU and slowly progressed, noted to
have a slightly improving mental status.

On [**9-21**] HD#6 patient spiked a fever, urine culture showed E
coli, and the patient was placed on ciprofloxacin for a 3 day
course.  She became febrile again on [**9-24**] and was pan cultured.
A bilateral lower extremity doppler study was negative for DVT.
Chest x-ray was suspicious for a left lower lobe pneumonia and a
sputum sample obtained on [**9-21**] at this point was noted to grow
haemophilus influenza sensitive to ampicillin, therefore she was
started on ampicillin.  On [**9-25**] the antibiotic regimen was
changed to vancomycin and zosyn when a blood culture was
reported as coag negative staph.  Flagyl was added on [**9-27**].
Urivne culture on [**9-24**] showed no growth.

The patient had a tracheostomy placed [**9-25**] and was weaned to
trach mask over the course of her stay.  Assay for C diff was
negative on [**9-28**].  She received a PEG tube on [**9-29**].  LENIS on
[**9-30**] were negative bilat for DVT.

[**2177-9-30**] Pt discharged to [**Hospital **] Rehab hospital in fair
condition.
