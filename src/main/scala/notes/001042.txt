CXR ([**2145-1-13**]): Aside from slightly lower lung volumes, there is
no significant interval change in the appearance of the
end-stage sarcoidosis as previously documented.
.
CXR ([**2145-1-24**]): Comparison with the previous study done
[**2145-1-20**]. There are extensive parenchymal and pleural changes
consistent with end-stage
sarcoidosis as before. An endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube
remain in
place. Allowing for differences in technique, there is no
significant change. No significant interval change.
.
CXR ([**2145-2-3**]): Previously questioned retrocardiac nodular
infection has cleared, presumably representing secretions
resolved from a region of cystic lung. In all other respects the
radiographic appearance of these severely scarred and
bronchiectatic lungs, as well as bilateral pleural abnormalities
are unchanged over the long-term. There are no findings to
suggest acute pneumonia or pulmonary edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
76 yo male with end stage sarcoidosis presenting with dyspnea.
.
# HYPERCARBIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt presented to the ER with
increased shortness of breath over 24hrs, tachycardia, and
generalized fatigue. Similar prior presentations were felt to be
related to sarcoid flares. CXR showed end stage pulmonary
fibrosis but no other abnormalities. It was felt his sx likely
represented pneumonia in setting of severe underlying fibrotic
lung disease. Pt was unable to sustain high minute ventilatory
rate, evidenced by a rising pCO2 and thus required emergent
intubation shortly after arrival to ICU. The patient was treated
for presumed pneumonia with levofloxacin and meropenem given
leukocytosis and dyspnea. Infectious work-up including multiple
blood cultures and viral cultures were negative.  The patient
was not given steroids since it was felt that his sx were
related to an infectious process rather than a flair of his
sarcoid lung disease. The patient was made DNR after talking
with the son. IP consult was sought for trach placement given
the patient's inability to wean off the ventilator with
subsequent placement of tracheostomy and PEG on [**1-26**] and [**1-27**]
