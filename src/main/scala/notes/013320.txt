Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation

History of Present Illness:
8 yo h/o COPD, HTN, HL who presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED the early
morning of [**2144-7-1**] with respiratory distress. T 96.8, BP 118/54,
HR 70, RR 18 on BiPAP 5/5. Found to have WBC 21 with 4%
bandemia, Cr 2.1 (baseline 0.9), lactate 3.3, trop <0.01. CXR
showed a RML pneumonia. She received vancomycin and
levofloxacin. Given her respiratory distress, she was started on
BiPAP, improved, and was taken off BiPAP. However, around 7 a.m.
on [**2144-7-1**] her respiratory status worsened with ABG 6.98/81/159.
Extremities were cool. She was intubated.
.
About 1 hour after intubation, she went into PEA arrest,
requiring epi x 2 and atropine x 2 and 4 minutes of CPR. A right
IJ sepsis line was placed. IVF, ceftriaxone, and pip-tazo were
given. She was also started on norepinephrine for hypotension,
with SBP improving to 110s. A bedside u/s showed no PTX and no
pericardial effusion. Repeat ABG was 6.75/112/227/18; tidal
volume was increased, paralytics given, a-line placed. SBP
continued to drop, and phenylephrine and then vasopressin were
started. SBP transiently improved with disconnection from the
ventilator and manual bagging. Got total of 8 L of NS. Got
methylpred 125 x 1.
.
Admitted to MICU.
.
ROS not obtained as patient was intubated.

Past Medical History:
emphysema
hypertension
hyperlipidemia

Social History:
tobacco abuse per OMR, not obtained as patient is intubated

Family History:
Mother dies of a brain tumor of unknown type in her 50's and
father died of massive MI in his 60's. No other hx of DMII, CAD,
CAD or emphysema in the family



Physical Exam:
General: intubated elderly woman
HEENT: NC/AT, sclera anicteric, ET in place
Neck: JVP not elevated
Lungs: Coarse breath sounds bilaterally from anterior
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs,
gallops
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present,
no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly
Ext: Cool, weak pedal pulses, no edema

.
Echo [**2144-7-1**]:
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is unusually small. There is moderate global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %). Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2142-4-30**],
biventricular systolic dysfunction is new.
.
CXR [**2144-7-1**]: Severe emphysema with new right lower lung
consolidation since
[**2144-5-18**], likely representing pneumonia. Nodular densities also
noted, more
prominent than that seen on CT of [**2144-5-18**]; given rapid growth,
these likely are
infectious/inflammatory in etiology, however malignancy cannot
be excluded.
Given these abnormalities, CT chest is recommended to exclude
right hilar
mass.

Brief Hospital Course:
Upon arrival to MICU, patient was intubated, and despite weaning
off of sedatives, she was unresponsive with fixed, dilated
pupils. Her BP dropped and she required up to 4 pressors. The
patient expired after a few hours with family by her bedside.
