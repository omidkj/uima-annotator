CT- Angiogram Abdomen: 1. No evidence of aortic dissection,  2)
Large pericardial effusion, 3) Extensive atherosclerotic disease
within the abdominal aorta with short- segment occlusion of the
proximal superior mesenteric artery with distal reconstitution.
The [**Female First Name (un) 899**] is not seen and the proximal celiac axis appears patent.
No secondary signs of bowel ischemia. 4) Bilateral renal artery
stenosis. Patent aortic pypass graft. 5). Left-sided pleural
effusion with associated atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital on [**2138-10-15**].  She was
taken emergently to the operating room for an exploratory
laparotomy where an acute closed loop small bowel
obstruction with bowel infarction and chronic superior
mesenteric artery thrombosis were found.  Postoperatively she
was admittd to the ICU and treated with broad spectrum
antibiotics.  In the perioperative period, she had a significant
fluid requirement.  Given her ESRD, she was started on CVVH, but
effective dialysis was not possible secondary to hemodynamic
instability.  She developed A-Fibb. chemical cardioversion was
successful with Amiodarone and esmolol.  She underwent
angiography on [**2138-10-17**] with SMA stenting.  Over the ensuing 12
day, the patient was gently dialyzed on CVVH and kept
approximately 1 liter negative a day.  Vasopressor support was
gradually weaned and completely stopped by the evening of
[**2138-10-29**].  Her ventiliatory support was gradually weaned to CPAP
w/ PS with excellent gases.  Despite her continued slow
improvement, the patient developed sudden onset asystole at
approximately 1615 on [**2138-10-30**].  The patient was resuscitated
according to ACLS protocol.  Despite exhaustive efforts to
resuscitate the patient, all efforts proved futile with the
development of persistent asystole.  Death was declared at
16:57.
