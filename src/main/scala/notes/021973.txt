Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2201-5-15**], he underwent kidney and liver transplant. Surgeon was
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. Please refer to operative note for details.
He was sent to the SICU for management. Postop duplex of liver
and kidney demonstrated patent vasculature, no hydro or biliary
ductal dilatation. He was hypotensive on postop day 1 and
required IV hydration and blood products. Hct remained stable.
LFTs and creatinine improved daily. Urine output was excellent.
JP drainage was non-bilious.

He developed an ileus. NG remained in place until [**5-22**] when
ileus resolved. Diet was slowly advanced and tolerated. Pain
medication was switched to oral Dilaudid. Lateral JP drain was
removed on [**5-23**] and medial on [**5-25**].

Generalized anasarca improved daily and he only required  only
Lasix x1. Weight decreased to 85.8 (down 10 kg from admission
wt). In fact, he developed orthostatic hypotension. Midodrine
was started with improvement.

Heparin drip was started for h/o IVC thrombus. A few days later,
Coumadin was started a 1mg daily. Dose was increased to 2mg
[**5-24**]. On [**5-25**], INR was 1.4. Dose was increased to 3mg and
patient was instructed to get PT/INR done as an outpatient on
[**5-27**] and [**5-30**].

PT worked with him and recommended home PT. VNA Care of [**Location (un) 4368**] was arranged. He was ambulating with a walker.

He tolerated steroid taper to 20mg daily, cellcept [**Hospital1 **] and
prograf dosing. Prograf levels increased to 15.2 on [**5-24**]. Dose
was held and decreased to 1mg [**Hospital1 **].

He will go to stay at his sister's home in [**Location (un) 50909**] RI with f/u
on [**5-28**]. Of note, a TTE was done when he was in SICU for
hypotension. Mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with hypokinesis of the distal half of the anterior
septum and anterior walls, distal septum were noted with EF of
50%. Cardiology recommended ASA, BB and statin. Given
orthostatic hypotension, metoprolol was stopped on [**5-22**]. ASA was
on hold as patient was switched from IV heparin to Lovenox on
day of discharge to home. A f/u cardiology appointment was
scheduled for [**5-29**].

He will also f/u with hematology given h/o IVC thrombus. He was
found to have  60% activity of antithrombin III. Recommendation
was to continue anticoagulation and follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6944*
