HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76 year old
gentleman presenting to [**Hospital1 69**]
emergency department on [**2166-8-12**] complaining of 24 hours of
dizziness, shortness of breath, cough, fever and respiratory
distress.  Patient was noted to have a significant past
medical history of upper GI bleed and was status post one
episode of coffee ground emesis the night prior to admission.
Patient was found to be in mild respiratory distress with
bilateral rhonchi, hypoxia and hypercapnia.  Patient became
significantly more hypoxic and hypercapnic and anesthesia was
called for potential difficult airway and patient was
successfully intubated.  Patient remained hemodynamically
stable.  In the emergency department patient was noted to
have a temperature of 101.9, blood pressure 118/50, heart
rate 119, O2 sat 77%, respiratory rate between 30 and 35.
Patient received sublingual nitroglycerin times one, noted
drop in blood pressure to systolic of 77 over diastolic of
54.  Given 5 liters IV fluids.  Subsequent ABG of 7.48, 38,
39 in room air.  Given 100% nonrebreather and increased O2
sat to 85%.  Patient was then electively intubated.  Chest
x-ray showed predominantly CHF with bilateral pneumonia
consistent with aspiration pneumonia.  Subsequent ABG was
7.36, 45, 96.  Patient was put on assist control 14/400, PEEP
12, 100%.  Patient was noted to have bloody sputum with
suctioning.  No acute GI bleed.  Patient received CAT scan of
head which showed no bleed.  Patient was subsequently
admitted to the medical ICU.  Patient subsequently received
FFP times two units and one bag of platelets.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Head and neck squamous cell cancer in
[**2158**] status post XRT and radical neck dissection.  CVA in
[**10-10**].  Recent admission for GI bleed and hemoptysis.
Thrombocytopenia.  Ulcerative colitis.  Basal cell cancer of
the scalp.  Status post head injury in the [**2103**] status post
metal plate insertion.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  Prednisone taper which ended [**2166-8-3**], Protonix
40 q.day, Fioricet p.r.n., hydrocortisone enema 100 q.h.s.
p.r.n., Colace 100 b.i.d., sulfasalazine 1000 mg t.i.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Distant tobacco history.  Patient currently
nonsmoker.  Nondrinker.  Past history of ETOH abuse.  No
illicit drugs.  Patient recently widowed.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for prostate cancer in father
and uterine cancer in sister.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On presentation to medical ICU
temperature was 101.9, pulse 101, blood pressure 116/69,
respiratory rate 12, 96%.  Patient was intubated, sedated and
unresponsive.  Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light.
Mucous membranes moist.  Right IJ placed in E.D. in place.
Regular rate S1, S2, 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.  Lungs
showed diffuse crackles with occasional rhonchi.  ET tube in
place with some diffuse bloody secretions.  Abdomen distended
with decreased bowel sounds.  Extremities were warm, 1+
distal pulses, 1+ pitting edema [**1-12**] way up patient's calves.

LABORATORY DATA:  Subsequent EKG showed sinus tach at 110, 0
axis, right bundle branch block, slight [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depression in
4 and 5.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to MICU with the
diagnoses of severe hypoxia, bilateral pneumonia, CHF versus
aspiration pneumonia, resolving hemoptysis, fever and
elevated white count at 21.0.  Patient was started on
levofloxacin and Flagyl, pan cultured.  Was given propofol
for sedation.  Patient's chest x-ray day subsequent to
admission was consistent with aspiration pneumonia.  Gram
positive cocci.  Was continued on Levaquin and Flagyl.
Vancomycin was added for coverage.

Pulmonary.  Bilateral pneumonia persisted right worse than
left.  He was continued on Levaquin, Flagyl and vancomycin.
Medical ICU team had difficulty oxygenating patient further
contributing to patient's respiratory failure from aggressive
volume depletion in the emergency department and early ICU
course.  Patient was in excess of 18 liters positive.
Patient was placed on assist control, tidal volume 500, PEEP
16, pressure support 25, FIO2 50%.  Patient slowly making
gradual decrease in FIO2 to 40%.  Patient had decrease in
PEEP to 14.  Patient continued on course of antibiotics for
aspiration pneumonia.  Patient was noting to continually
desat with decrease in PEEP requiring increase in ventilatory
support.  Patient received moderate benefit from aggressive
chest P.T. and recruitment maneuvers.  At or around hospital
day 16 patient was switched from assist control to pressure
support of 10, PEEP 16, FIO2 40%.  Patient continued to have
thick yellow secretions, coarse breath sounds bilaterally.
Chest x-ray slowly improving.  Right interstitial
consolidations.  Patient eventually tolerated decrease of
pressure support to 12, PEEP 12, continuing to wean.  Patient
was deemed slow to wean from vent settings and ENT was
consulted to do an O.R. trach for patient secondary to
patient's neck dissection and XRT for skin cancer.  On or
around [**9-4**] patient was at pressure support of 12,
PEEP 7 [**12-11**], FIO2 40%, remaining extremely sensitive to
changes in pressure support.  Drops from pressure support of
14 to 13 would make patient tachypneic pulling low tidal
volumes.  Patient remained slow to wean.  Patient was
decreased on his sedation of Ativan and fentanyl drips and
slowly began to wean from pressure support of 12 to eventual
goal of pressure support of 8 over a period of 12 days.  On
[**2166-9-10**] patient was decreased to pressure support of 8.5 and
40% and was started on trach collar trial for one hour.
Patient continued at pressure support of 8.5 and 40% for
multiple hours without previous tachypnea episodes.  Patient
was gotten out of bed to chair and had multiple successful
trach collar trials ranging from 15 minutes to 1 1/2 hours.
Patient was aggressively diuresed with Lasix with a goal of
0.5 to 1 liter net negative on fluid balance per day.
Diuresis was somewhat limited secondary to recurrent bouts of
hypotension with systolic in the 90s, thus delaying diuresis.
Over the course of the hospital stay from [**8-12**] to
today, [**9-12**], patient is now net only 1.5 liters positive
in fluids and responding to Lasix.

Infectious disease.  Throughout his hospital course patient
continued to have low grade fevers in the range from 100 to
101.0.  Patient occasionally spiked fevers as high as 102.8.
Patient was put on ceftriaxone and vancomycin.  Patient's
white counts were in the high teens and subsequently
decreased.  All cultures, blood and urine, were negative.
Further all cath tips sent for culture were negative.
Patient was given abdominal CT and sinus CT to look for
source.  Sinus CT was positive for right maxillary sinusitis.
Abdominal CT was negative for infectious source.  Patient was
continued on antibiotics.  ENT was consulted for sinusitis
and suggested increase head of bed, intranasal spray, no
acute management necessary at this time.  On or around
[**9-2**] patient was found to be C.diff positive in the
stool.  Patient was started on Flagyl.  All blood cultures,
wound cultures and sputum cultures remained negative.
Patient without any new elevations in white count or
temperature spikes for the 10 days prior to discharge.

Patient's hematocrit ranged from the high 20s in the
beginning of his hospital stay and began to very slowly drift
down throughout the hospital course.  Patient had no source
of obvious bleeding, although he was noted to have OB
positive stool.  Patient was transfused two units of blood
with an inappropriate bump in patient's hematocrit.
Patient's hematocrit only increased from 23 to 25 status post
two units.  Patient's hematocrit tended to be stable with
slight decrease.  Patient eventually trended down from
hematocrit of 26 to a slow decrease over subsequent days to
hematocrit of 23.  Patient was transfused two additional
units of blood, bringing patient's hematocrit to an
appropriate bump. Patient's hematocrit was noted to be 31.
