History of Present Illness:
38yo M w/ ESRD on HD, h/o PTLD, bipolar disorder, and recent
bout of sepsis and Cdiff, p/w fevers and altered mental status.
The patient is minimally interactive, though awake and [**Last Name (LF) 3584**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
her husband [**Name (NI) **] provides the majority of her history. Prior to
her last hospitalization, her husband noticed that she was more
weak and had more of a flat affect. That was noted by both her
husband and the primary team throughout her last
hospitalization, but it was attributed to her illness. Upon
discharge, her husband noted that her affect continued to be
flat and her mentation was slow. She was verbalizing irrational
fears to her family. Several days later she became
nonresponsive, rigid, and reluctant to walk/move. Husband notes
that she was exhibiting "fleeting clarity", as if she were
delirious with changed sleep patterns and increasing anorexia.
On the day prior to admit, she saw her psychiatrist who
recommended admission given changing psychiatric picture and
continued low grade fevers.  The family favored waiting to see
if stopping ativan and initiating zyprexa would help. She then
went to HD and was noted to be minimally responsive after HD.
Overnight she had fever to 100.6 and the morning or admit she
states that she felt SOB and had a cough. At the ED she
complained of abdominal pain, but denied nausea.
.
Pt presented to the ED with VS: T 99.9, BP 114/84, HR 100, RR
20, sats of 97% on 2L. She was noted to be awake, [**Name (NI) 3584**], but
nonverbal. She was following commands and denied any pain.
Work-up revealed a new LLL infiltrate on CXR and resolving
colitis on CT abdomen/pelvis.  She was given CTX and vancomycin.
On return from the radiology suite, she had a desaturation event
to 89% on RA but recovered with supplemental oxygen. On arrival
to the floor, she was minimally interactive answering few
questions and responding to a few commands. She specifically
denies pain everywhere, except for her stomach.
.
Of note, pt was just discharged on [**2202-7-28**] after a week long
hospital course that was notable for sepsis, requiring a central
line, fluid resuscitation and IV pressors in the ICU and
complicated by C.Dif colitis.

STUDIES:
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2202-8-5**] 9:10 PM
There is a posterior segment left lower lobe infiltrate
consistent with pneumonia. The remainder of the lungs is clear.
Dual-lumen dialysis catheter is stable in course and position.
No effusion or pneumothorax is appreciated.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2202-8-5**] 9:50 PM
Advanced global parenchymal atrophy related to patient's stated
age. Differential diagnostic considerations are broad.
Nonetheless, finding is consistent with remote head MRI dated
[**2196-11-12**].
.
CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS  W/O CONTRAST; Study Date of [**2202-8-5**] 9:50 PM
As best can be determined due to limitations in technique, no
significant interval change with the exception of likely
improved wall edema suggesting healing colitis.  There is
relatively stable amount of ascites,
predominantly in the upper abdomen, particularly in the
perihepatic  distribution. Given lack of source for fever,
spontaneous bacterial
peritonitis cannot be excluded. There has been interval
worsening of body wall edema and anasarca.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2202-8-22**] 1:17 PM
1.  Improvement of left retrocardiac atelectasis.
2.  Subpulmonic effusion vs ascites.
.
CT Abdomen/PELVIS W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2202-8-30**] 12:43 PM
1.  Moderate to large pericardial effusion with thickened and
questionably
hyperenhancing pericardium as detailed above.
2.  Slight increase in size in right-sided pleural effusion.
3.  Stable volume of ascites with areas suggestive of
loculation.
4.  Significant improvement in the patient's previously
described colitis.
.
ECHO Study Date of [**2202-8-30**]
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2202-8-12**],
the pericardial effusion is much larger and the heart rate is
higher.
.
C.CATH Study Date of [**2202-8-31**]
1. Pericardial tamponade.
2. Successful pericardiocentesis with aspiration of 480 cc of
bloody
fluid.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2202-9-6**] 6:01 PM
Interval increase in size of left pleural effusion and decrease
in the right pleural effusion. Right lower lobe atelectasis and
left retrocardiac opacity.
.
MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2202-9-7**] 9:29 AM
No acute intracranial abnormalities, although the evaluation is
limited due to the lack of gadolinium.
.
ECHO Study Date of [**2202-9-9**]
Small echodense pericardial effusion.  Compared with the prior
study (images reviewed) of [**2202-9-1**], the effusion is smaller,
with less free pericardial fluid. The other findings are
similar.
.
CXR [**2202-9-21**]:
IMPRESSION:

No acute cardiopulmonary process with near complete resolution
of previously
identified effusions.

.
U/S Lower extremities [**2202-9-24**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  No DVT.
2.  Diffuse soft tissue swelling.

.


Cardiac transthroacic echo [**2202-9-22**]:
Conclusions:
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The
estimated right
atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size,
and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
tech
