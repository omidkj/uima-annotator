Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization
PICC Line placement

History of Present Illness:
61 year old spanish-speaking female with CAD s/p recent RCA bare
metal stent [**1-2**], DM, HTN presented to OSH with chest pain. By
report, the chest pain has been intermittent for at least a
month, but she did not tell her family about it until this week.
 She presented to [**Hospital6 3105**] On [**5-15**] for
increased severity of this pain.  She describes the pain as a
"sharp" pain starting in left shoulder blade and radiating
around to left anterior chest associated with some shortness of
breath. Pain is worse with exertion and improves w/ rest.  By
report, she also has been having left shoulder pain and started
on percocet at [**Hospital6 5016**].  At [**Hospital3 **], she
had nausea with emesis x 3 (non-bloody).  She initially received
sl NTG.  First set two sets of cardiac enzymes were negative; on
eve of [**5-16**], however, by report new TW in precordial leads and +
TnT --> started on heparin gtt and transfered to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
Currently denying active chest pain or shortness of breath,
though endorses mild nausea.
.
ROS: On review of symptoms, denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. Denies
recent fevers, chills or rigors. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
*** Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.  Reports worsened ability
to do stairs (stops frequently), but unable to quantify it
exactly.

ECHOCARDIOGRAM  [**2126-5-18**]
Mild left ventrical apical aneurysm with severe global systolic

dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD or other diffuse process. Right
ventricular  free wall hypokinesis. Mild mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary artery  systolic hypertension.

.
LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)  [**2126-5-19**] 12:35 PM
Very mildly echogenic liver consistent with questionable fatty
infiltration. Portal vein is patent and gallbladder has been
removed.
.
[**2126-5-20**] Cardiac Catheterization:
1.  Coronary angiography showed severe three vessel coronary
artery disease.  The left main coronary artery had moderate
calcification but no angiographically apparent flow limiting
stenoses.  The LAD was diffusely calcified with a proximal
stenosis of 90% followed by another 90% stenosis in mid segment.
 The LCX was nondominant vessel with modest calcification.  The
RCA was a large dominant vessel with severe instent restenosis
proximally. 2.  Arterial conduit angiography revealed a robust
patent LIMA with no lesions. 3.  Limited resting hemodynamics
revealed severely elevated left sided filling pressures (LVEDP
was 32 mm Hg).  Systemic arterial pressures were severely
elevated (aortic pressure was 179/83 mm Hg).  There was no
significant gradient across the aortic valve upon pullback of
the catheter from the left ventricle to the ascending aorta.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severely elevated left sided filling pressures.
3. Severely elevated systemic arterial pressure.
.
[**2126-5-21**]  Myocardial Viability Study: 1. Severe resting perfusion
defects of the apex, distal inferior wall and the mid and basal
inferoseptal walls.  This is consistent with poor probability of
recovery of function after revascularization. 2. Mild resting
perfusion defects of the inferior wall and distal ventricle and
normal perfusion of the mid and basal anterior and anterolateral
walls, consistent with high probability of recovery of function
after revascularization. 3. Inreased right ventricular uptake,
consistent with global reduction in left ventricular perfusion.
4. Increased left ventricular cavity size.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the OR on [**2126-5-29**] for CABG X 4 (LIMA>LAD,
SVG>OM, SVG>Diag, SVG>PDA) and ASD closure.  Post-op, she was
taken to the CSRU on epinephrine, milrinone, norepinephrine
drips.  She remained on mechanical ventilation for the first few
post-operative days, while improving hemodynamically and weaning
off vasopressors and inotropes.  She was extubated on POD # 3.
She went in to rapid atrial fibrillation, which was treated with
metoprolol and amiodarone.  The electrophysiology service was
consulted, and followed her for this.  For the next few days,
her rhythm varied from bradycardia (junctional and sinus) in the
30's to rapid AFib.  She remained in the ICU due to continued
need for pacing (via her epicardial wires). For this reason, she
underwent permanent pacmaker palcement on [**2126-6-6**].  Her
epicardial wires were removed. Anticoagulation for AFib was
initiated with warfarin, with a target INR 2.0-2.5.  This will
be dosed by the pt's PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] once discharged from rehab.
She has remained stable hemodynamically, and is ready to be
discharged to rehab on [**2126-6-12**].  She has progressed slowly from
a mobility standpoint, and should continue with physical
therapy.
