Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Aspirin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspne a on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
teeth extraction [**2137-2-10**]. 2,13,20


History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 83 y.o. female with pmh significant for CHF [**2-2**]
3+TR and 3+ MR, HTN, pulmonary HTN, presenting with increased
lower extremity edema and severe dyspnea on exertion. The
patient has had CHF and DOE for years, but has been experiencing
severe worsening of symptoms over the past month. She presented
in mid [**Month (only) 404**] with peripheral edema and acute on chronic renal
failure. During this admission she administered fluids and her
creaitnine improved. She also underwent right heart
catheeterization which showed an elevated wedge pressure of
35mmHg, and elevated PA pressures of 46mmHg. Her pulmonary
pressures were decreased with NO, and so she was placed on
nifedipine to treat any reversible aspect of her pulmonary
hypertension. On discharge her metolazone, spironolactone, and
lisinopril were discontinued. She was discharged on lasix 80mg
dialy. After she returned home, she progressively gained weight,
had increased peripheral edema, and became more dyspneic on
exertion.  Her lasix dose was increased over these past two
weeks from 80mg daily to 120mg PO twice daily, without
resolution of symptoms.

Pertinent Results:
Echo [**2137-2-8**]: The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right
atrium is markedly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 10-15mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF 60-70%) There
is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with depressed free wall contractility. There is
abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. There is a minimally increased
gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**1-2**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
supporting structures of the tricuspid valve are
thickened/fibrotic. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The
main pulmonary artery is dilated. The branch pulmonary arteries
are dilated. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2136-12-14**], the findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs [**Known lastname 70502**] was admitted on [**2-4**] for CHF management, secondary to
4+TR and 3+MR, including cardiac surgery. She was placed on
lasix drip the evening of [**2-4**] beginning at 6mg/hr. The drip was
titrated up to 10mg/hr on [**2-5**] to maintain fluid status 1-2L
negative. The patient reported symptomatic relief by [**2-5**]. On [**2-7**]
the lasix drip was decreased from 10 to 8, because her
creatinine increased from 1.0 to 1.1. On [**2-9**] the lasix drip was
decreased from 8 to 6 because her creatinine increased from 1.1
to 1.2.  The patient's lasix drip has been on 6mg/hr from [**2-9**]
through [**2-13**], and the patient's fluid status maintained 1-2L
negative. The patient also underwent tooth extraction on [**2-10**],
in preparation of her valve replacement surgery. The patient had
three teeth extracted and was begun on clindamycin to prevent
systemic spread of oral flora. The patient underwent valve
replacement surgery on [**2-13**]. She was brought to the CVICU
sedated and ventilated in critical but stable condition. She was
extubated overnight and weaned off from her Inotropic [**Doctor Last Name 360**]. On
POD2 she was transfused 2 units of PRBC for HCT of 22, her chest
tubes were removed. On POD4 she was transferred to F6 for
further management. [**Last Name (un) **] service was consulted for her glucose
management and she was further diuresed. She began lasix and
zaroxolyn for diuresis. On POD6 her Lasix was increased to 120mg
TID and she was started on Spironolactone on based on her CXR
that showed heart failure. She was started on coumadin for
atrial fibrillation. On [**2-21**] she was seen by ENT for several
hours of epistaxis, a vessel was cauterized and absorbable
packing was placed. On [**2-25**] Natrecor was started for diuresis.
Her natrecor was then dc'd and she was started on viagra, a
lasix drip, and IV diuril.  Her diuresis improved. She developed
stridor which improved with continued diuresis and cool nebs.
She remained in the hospital for diuresis. Her diuretics were
switched to PO, and she continued to diurese well. She was ready
for discharge to rehab on POD #20.
