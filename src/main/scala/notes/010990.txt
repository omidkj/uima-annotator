Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Exertional chest pain and shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2182-6-27**] Five Vessel CABG(LIMA to LAD, vein graft to diagonal,
vein graft sequential to ramus and obutse marginal, vein graft
to PDA)


History of Present Illness:
This is a 57 year old male with known history of coronary artery
disease. He underwent previous PCI of his LAD in [**2173**] and most
recently PCI of his obutse marginal in [**2181-1-30**]. He presents
now with exertional angina and dyspnea on exertion. A recent
Myoview imaging study was notable for ischemia. Subsequent
cardiac catheterization revealed 80% LAD lesion after the stent;
90% stenosis of the first obtuse marginal and a totally occluded
mid right coronary artery. Based on the above results, he was
referred for surgical revascularization. Prior to surgery, an
echocardiogram was performed which showed an LVEF of 30%. There
was only 1+ mitral regurgitation and trace aortic insufficiency.
The ascending aorta and aortic root were mildly dilated,
measuring 3.9 cm and 3.7 cm respectively.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted and underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 914**]. The operation was uneventful and
he was transferred to the CSRU for invasive monitoring. Within
24 hours, he awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. He
maintained stable hemodynamics and transferred to the SDU on
postoperative day two. Heart failure therapy which included
Coreg, ace-inhibition and diuretics were started. He remained
fluid overloaded and initially required aggressive diuresis with
intravenous Lasix. The [**Last Name (un) **] Center was consulted to assist in
the managment of his diabetes mellitus. Given his poorly
controlled blood sugars, insulin therapy was eventually
initiated. He maintained stable hemodynamics but was noted to
have occasional non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. He
remained asymptomatic. Given his low ejection fraction, the EP
service was consulted to evaluate the need for an AICD. A
postoperative echocardiogram on [**7-1**] showed slightly worsening
LVEF of 25% with slightly worsening MR. It was recommended to
optimize his CHF regimen and reassees his LVEF in [**2-4**] months. An
AICD was not recommended at this time. Over several days,
medical therapy was optimized. He experienced less ventricular
ectopy and continued to make clinical improvements with
diuresis. He was noted to have moderate amount of sternal
drainage which was treated with intravenous Vancomycin and
betadine dressing changes. By discharge, his sternal drainage
resolved but he will continue oral antibiotics and additional
dressing changes given risk for sternal wound infection(diabetes
mellitus). The remaineder of his hospital course was uneventful
and he was medically cleared for discharge on postoperative day
11.
