Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from [**Hospital3 10377**] Hospital for treatment of
tracheomalacia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
placement of G-J tube by interventional radiology
placement of Y stent in trachea
stoma revision and placement of tracheal stent w/ foam cuff


History of Present Illness:
53F with hx of severe spina bifida, kyphoscoliosis and chronic
atelectasis who is chronically vented who was transferred from
[**Hospital3 417**] for a rigid bronchoscopy. Pt was admitted to [**Hospital 64898**] in [**9-25**] for a trach change after it was
found that it was difficult to pass the suction catheter. A
bronchoscopy at that time showed granulation tissue causing a
30-40% obstruction of the posterolateral wall so she had a new
trach placed. On [**2165-12-25**], pt had a fiberoptic bronchoscopy with
another change of her tracheostomy tube. Apparently the ideal
length of trach tube was not available at the time so a #7
Shiley with a length of 88mm was placed. On [**12-29**], pt noted to go
into acute resp distres with decrease in her mental status. She
was placed on an ambu bag and brought to [**Hospital3 **] Med Ctr. There
an ABG revealed 7.16/115/281. She underwent an urgent
bronchoscopy which showed mucous plugging and granulation tissue
in and around the trachea. The granulation tissue was measured
at 3-44mm above the carina, obstructing the airway. The tube was
advanced through the obstruction and now rests 3cm above the
carina. Her ABG improved to 7.38/64/239 following the procedure.
Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for rigid bronchoscopy and possible
trach repositioning.
.
Of note, pt has sputum from [**12-26**] growing acinetobacter [**Last Name (un) 36**] only
to amikacin and sputum from [**12-29**] growing morganella [**Last Name (un) 36**] to
amikcain, gentamicin and imipenem. She also had a urine cx from
[**12-29**] growing MRSA. It appears that she has been on Amikacin since
[**12-31**] and Vancomycin since [**1-1**]

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Tracheal stenosis and malacia: Pt had developed granulation
tissue from chronic trach tube leading to periods of obstruction
and resp distress. On [**1-3**] pt underwent rigid bronchoscopy,
stoma revision, and placement of foam cuff.  Unfortunately,
shortly thereafter there was occlusion due to significant
malacia and an ulcer on her posterior trachea causing collapse.
Because of this, on [**1-14**] pt was taken back to the OR for rigid
bronchoscopy, and had a Y stent placed.  Since then, respiratory
status has remained stable on her chronic vent settings of AV
400x14x4x40%. Most recent bronchoscopy on [**1-22**] revealed some
thin secretions and otherwise clear airways and stent in good
position.
.
2. PNA: Pt was growing acinetobacter, MRSA and morganella in her
sputum [**Last Name (un) 36**] to mainly amikacin and had been started on amikacin
the week prior to admission at her rehab facility due to a
fever. Amikacin was discontinued on her arrival due to lack of
fever and leukocytosis. It was felt that pt is likely colonized
by these organisms.  After a period
