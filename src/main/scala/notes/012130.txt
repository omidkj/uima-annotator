Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath, stridor

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Nasotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 57-year-old man with history of type II DM,
hypertension,  status post CABG that was complicated by
perioperative arrhythmias, stroke, and subglottic stenosis
(after multiple intubations), CHF with the EF of 35%-40% on
echo, who presented to the ED with shortness of breath &
stridor.  Recent history includes tracheal dilation procedure 2
days ago at Mass Eye & Ear.  Pt went home following the
procedure.  He noted post-procedure hoarseness & throat/neck
pain.  Also, may have had some neck discomfort.  He developed
SOB & increasing stridor & presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further
eval.
.
In the ED, initial VS were 98.7, 93, 176/114, 32, 98% on nrb.
He was reportedly A&Ox3, though working hard to breathe &
appearing very uncomfortable.  He was stridorous and noted to
have signif swelling in anterior neck.  He was given Decadron
10mg IV for swelling.  He was intubated by anesthesia while
awake via fiberoptic nasotracheal intubation.  ENT was
consulted.  Per their note, there was "no supraglottic or
glottic edema/ertyhema appreciated, no pus or masses, unable to
appreaciate subglottic stenosis before ETT passed easily into
trachea."  Imaging revealed mult ground glass opacities
(possible multi-focal pneumonia) and neck CT showed 3.8 x 1.2 cm
collection anterior to the thyroid cartilage with adjacent
soft-tissue stranding (not drainable collection per radiology).
He got Unasyn, CTX, and levofloxacin for tx of his PNA &
possible neck infection.  He is being admitted to the ICU for
further

Brief Hospital Course:
57-year-old man with history of DM, hypertension, status post
CABG complicated by CVA and subglottic stenosis (after multiple
intubations), CHF with the EF of 35%-40% on echo, who presented
to the ED with shortness of breath & stridor and was found to
have a fluid collection in anterior neck s/p tracheal dilation
two days prior as well as probable multi-focal PNA.
.
# Airway compromise/Anterior Neck Collection: Patient presented
with stridor and respiratory distress that required nasal
intubation in the Emergency room and he was admitted to the ICU.
He has history of subglottic stenosis s/p multiple intubations
since CABG in [**2176**] with stridor since that time. He had been
started on prednisone 10mg daily for stridor that was to be
continued until the tracheal dilation procedure.  Underwent
tracheal dilation at Mass Eye & Ear on [**7-27**] w/ Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
and developed increasing respiratory distress after the
procedure, eventually presenting to the ED 3 days after
procedure. The initial suspicion was that acute compromise in
airway is related to procedure; however, no clear findings on
fiberoptic imaging while intubating. On exam, he has an anterior
neck mass approximately 5 cm x 0.5 cm with induration and
overlying erythema. He was started on empiric antibiotics with
Unasyn and Clindamycin on admission for concerns of infectious
etiology. A neck CT characterized the mass and a chest CT
revealed multifocal consolidations concerning for pneumonia. His
coverage was broadened to Vancomycin and Zosyn. Given the
concerns for pneumonia, a BAL was performed that was negative
and his antibiotic coverage was narrowed to Zosyn alone. He was
extubated successfully and transferred to the floor. An
ultrasound guided drainage of the anterior neck fluid collection
showed frank blood with a negative gram stain and culture,
consistent with hematoma. Clinical exam was much improved after
drainage. Patient will be continued on oral clindamycin for 5
days after discharge to complete a total of 14 days of
appropriate antibiotic coverage for possible superinfection of
anterior neck collection. He will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from
ENT after discharge. On admission he was continued on steroids
because the indication for steroids was unclear at that time.
Steroids were tapered and he was discharged without steroids.
.
# Fevers: reportedly up to 102 in ED and was >101 on arrival to
ICU.  Suspect fevers are infectious in etiology given probable
PNA on imaging & possible infectious collection in neck. Fevers
improved although patient continued to spike night-time fevers
until 3 days prior to discharge.
.
# Melena: During the course of the hospitalization, he had an
episode of melena confirmed guaiac positive that was not
associated with drop in hematocrit or a change in hemodynamic
stability. Concern was for upper GI bleed given chronic steroid
use. A colonoscopy performed 2 months prior to admission was
without gross abnormality. GI was consulted for possible
endoscopy, however deferred intervention until outpatient given
hemodynamic stability and recent respiratory distress and airway
compromise. On day of discharge he had another episode of melena
with some bright red blood streaking attributed to chronic
hemorrhoids associated with 4 point drop in hematocrit
overnight. He was again hemodynamically stable with no change in
vital signs and asymptomatic. An outpatient GI appointment for
possible EGD had already been scheduled for early [**Month (only) **]
therefore a CBC was ordered for [**Last Name (LF) 766**], [**8-10**] to reassess
and determine if earlier intervention is warranted.
.
# Hematuria: Patient had an episode of hematuria described by
nurses as blood tinged urine. In the setting of recent Foley
catheterization this was attributed to urethral trauma. However,
given concurrent melena and hemoptysis, concern was for more
systemic bleeding diathesis. No further episodes of hematuria
were described.

# Hemoptysis: Patient had several episodes of blood tinged
sputum that had resolved at time of discharge.
.
# Dysphagia: After extubation, a bedside speech and swallow
[**First Name3 (LF) 2742**] was performed followed by a video swallow study that
showed diffuse deficits with no laryngeal elevation. Patient was
continued on NPO status given high risk of aspiration. A repeat
video swallow several days later after ultrasound guided
drainage and clinical improvement in neck exam and handling of
secretions showed improvement and patient was started on soft
diet with thickened liquids. He was discharge
