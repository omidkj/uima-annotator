Imaging:
1. Fracture of the T10 vertebral body with small anterior
hematoma within the posterior mediastinum. This is an unstable
fracture, and although there is no obvious protrusion of
fragments or hematoma into the spinal canal, would recommend MRI
for further evaluation.
2. Sacral fracture with associated small presacral hematoma.
3. Interlobular septal thickening and ground-glass opacities in
the bilateral lungs are likely secondary to fluid overload.
4. Cardiomegaly.
5. Multiple pulmonary nodules, likely related to pulmonary
edema, although if clinically indicated, could repeat scan when
patient is more euvolemic to assess for resolution.
6. Gallbladder sludge without evidence of cholecystitis.
7. Mild thickening of the left adrenal gland.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 92207**] was admitted to the Trauma ICU for further
evaluation and management.  Her traumatic injuries were limited
to a T10 vertebral body fracture and an oblique mid-sacral
fracture.  The spine service was consulted for these injuries.
She was also in a severe CHF exacerbation, which was severely
impairing her respiratory mechanics.  After discussion with the
patient and her family, and in keeping with her expressed
wishes, she was made DNR/DNI.  She did have a brief period of
Bipap, and was weaned to a non-rebreather mask with 100% O2.
Despite aggressive management of her CHF, she was unable to wean
off oxygen and vasopressors.  Another family meeting was held on
[**11-11**], as her respiratory status was worsening, and she was
likely going to require intubation.  At which time the family
decided to make her comfort measures only.  All aggressive
interventions and monitoring were discontinued at 3pm on [**11-11**],
and she passed away at 1922pm on [**2190-11-11**].
