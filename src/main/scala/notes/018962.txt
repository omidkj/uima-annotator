Chief Complaint:
Left lower lobe squamous cell carcinoma of lung

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2193-4-10**]:
1. Left thoracotomy and lower lobectomy.
2. Partial bronchoplasty
3. Buttressing of bronchial suture line with intercostal
   muscle.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known firstname 2491**] [**Known lastname 84879**] is a 69 year old male with history of heavy
smoking and asbestos exposure history with ESKD on HD undergoing
transplant evaluation, who presented repeated episodes of mild
hemoptysis, which prompted a CT chest that
showed a LLL endobronchial lesion. Mr. [**Known lastname 84879**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**]
bronchoscopy with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2193-2-6**] with bronchial brushing
and TBNA LLL revealed NSCLC consistent with squamous cell
carcinoma.  Further workup with PET CT revealed sub-cm
intra-luminal lesion in the left lower lobe superior segment
bronchus is FDG avid (Suv max =13). No definite FDG-avid
metastatic disease. Mild FDG uptake also in lateral left 7th rib
with no corresponding osseous abnormality on CT whcih is
nonspecific. Head MRI did not demonstrate evidence of metastatic
disease. Cervical mediastinoscopy 4L/4R biopsies failed to
detect malignant spread to these lymph nodes.  He presents now
for surgical resection.

MICROBIOLOGY: MRSA screen NEGATIVE

RELEVANT IMAGING:

CXR [**2193-4-13**]: There is no appreciable evidence of pneumothorax.
Subcutaneous air appears to be slightly decreased in the left
chest wall. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable. Right basal
atelectasis is unchanged.

PATHOLOGY: PENDING


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the thoracic surgery service on
[**2193-4-10**] and had an open left lower lobectomy, partial
bronchoplasty.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was
admitted to the SICU postoperatively secondary to patient's
multiple medical comorbidities.  He was admitted to the SICU
with an epidural, L chest tube to suction and a foley catheter.

Neuro: Preoperatively, the patient had an epidural catheter
placed.  Post-operatively, the epidural functioned well with
adequate pain control. On POD2, patient had episode of
agitation/combativeness during which he self-d/c'd his epidural.
 This episode required restraints and IM haldol following which
patient was coherent and cooperative throughout remainder of
admission.  When tolerating oral intake, the patient was
transitioned to oral pain medications.  Patient refused po
narcotics and reported adequate pain control with tylenol.

CV: Preoperatively, plavix was held but ASA continued.  On POD1
patient had new onset afib refractory to IV lopressor 5mg x 4
doses.  Amiodarone bolus and gtt were initiated after which
patient converted to NSR.  Amiodarone was transitioned to po and
metoprolol dose was changed to 100 [**Hospital1 **].  Patient instructed to
discontinue metoprolol succinate at home in favor of metoprolol
tartrate 100mg [**Hospital1 **].  At time of discharge patient is in NSR.
Plavix restarted POD2.  Vital signs were routinely monitored.

Pulmonary: Patient had left chest tube placed at time of
surgery.  Tube was placed to suction postop.  Changed to water
seal 4am on POD1 and subsequently removed later that day.  Post
pull CXR demonstrated no PTX.  Pulmonary toilet including
incentive spirometry and early ambulation were encouraged.  On
day of discharge, patient with SaO2 96%RA at rest and 90-92 with
deep breathing on ambulation.  Vital signs were routinely
monitored.

GI/GU: Post-operatively, the patient was given IV fluids until
tolerating oral intake.  His diet was advanced from clears to
renal regular diet on POD0. He was also started on a bowel
regimen to encourage bowel movement. Patient on hemodialysis and
oliguric at baseline.  Renal followed throughout admission.
Foley was removed on POD#1. Patient was taken for hemodialysis
on POD1 and POD3 which he tolerated well.  Intake and output
were closely monitored.

ID: Patient was given preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis with
ancef. The patient's temperature was closely watched for signs
of infection.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during
this stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as
possible.

At the time of discharge on POD#4, the patient was doing well,
afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a renal regular
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well
controlled.
