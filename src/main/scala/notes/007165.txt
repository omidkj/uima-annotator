Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 66473**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] Trauma ICU.  Blood,
sputum, uring, and stool cultures were sent, and emperic

positive for 2+ GPC which grew from sputum.  These were never
speciated.

During his hospitalization he had several episodes of SVT and
atrial fibrillation with rapid ventriccular response.  He was
always hemodynamically stable and no episode persisted for more
than 24 hours.  He was stabilized on a regiment of propafenone
and verapamil.

Mr. [**Known lastname 66473**] required significant amounts of IV hydration
during his first days of this hospitalization.  He was diuresed
with a lasix drip and is now stable on 40 mg IV TID.

WBC has normalized, and tolerating tube feeds at goal.  He
should do well at rehabiliation.
