Admission Date:  [**2126-3-5**]     Discharge Date:  [**2126-3-11**]

Date of Birth:   [**2083-1-21**]     Sex:  F

Service:  Cardiothoracic

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 43-year-old
female with type I diabetes and chronic renal insufficiency
on peritoneal dialysis with new onset of dyspnea on exertion
and a positive exercise treadmill test, referred from the
cardiology service post cardiac catheterization for coronary
artery bypass grafting.  The patient is a type I diabetic
since the age of 12.  She has developed retinopathy,
neuropathy, and chronic renal failure as a result of her
diabetes.  Has no cardiac history until [**Month (only) **] of last year
when she was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] with congestive heart
failure.  Initial electrocardiogram showed T wave inversions
laterally with normal ventricular function.  She ruled out
and was discharged home.  She had a follow-up exercise
treadmill test which revealed ST depressions in V5 and V6 and
inferior ischemia.  An echocardiogram revealed mildly
depressed left ventricular function.

The patient was catheterized on [**2-7**].  Please see
catheterization report for full details.  The catheterization
showed a total occlusion of the right coronary artery with
good left-to-right collaterals and a tubular mid left
anterior descending artery lesion of 80% with severe disease
of D1, and an ejection fraction of 40%.  The patient was
discharged post catheterization and returned to preadmission
testing on [**3-1**].

ALLERGIES:  The patient stated that she was allergic to
BETADINE and PENICILLIN.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  At that time she was found to be a
43-year-old woman in no acute distress.  Her skin was warm
and dry.  Pupils were equally round and reactive to light
with extraocular movements intact.  She was anicteric and
noninjected.  Mucous membranes were moist with no erythema
and no lesions.  Neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy and
no thyromegaly, and no jugular venous distention.  Chest
sounds were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart sounds
revealed a regular rate and rhythm, somewhat tachycardic,
S1/S2.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdomen was soft,
nontender, and nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  Insulin
catheter in the right lower quadrant with a well-healed
incision at the left umbilicus.  Tenckhoff catheter also in
the left lower quadrant.  Extremities were warm and well
perfused.  Neurologic examination revealed alert and oriented
times three.  Moved all extremities and followed commands.
Cranial nerves II through XII were grossly intact.  A
nonfocal examination.

Vital signs at [**Hospital **] clinic included a heart rate of 104, blood
pressure 194/108, respiratory rate of 16.  Weight at that
time was 62 kg.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient returned to [**Hospital1 346**] on [**3-5**] for coronary artery
bypass grafting.  Please see the operative report for full
details.

In summary, the patient underwent coronary artery bypass
graft off pump times two with a LIMA to the left anterior
descending artery and a saphenous vein graft to the posterior
descending artery.  The patient tolerated the procedure well
and was transferred from the operating room to the
cardiothoracic intensive care unit.  At the time of transfer,
the patient had an arterial line, a Swann-Ganz catheter,
ventricular and apical pacing wires, two mediastinal and one
left pleural chest tubes.  Her mean arterial blood pressure
was 72, central venous pressure was 10, and her heart rate
was 61 in sinus rhythm.  She was maintained with
Neo-Synephrine at 1 mc/kg per minute and on insulin at
2 units per hour.

The patient did well postoperatively and was extubated on the
day of her surgery.  Her Neo-Synephrine was also able to be
weaned off immediately post surgery.  She remained
hemodynamically stable overnight and was transferred to the
floor postoperative day one for continued postoperative care
and cardiac rehabilitation.  The patient's chest tubes were
left in place until after peritoneal dialysis was resumed in
order to allow us to assess for leakage of the peritoneal
dialysate into the chest cavity.  Peritoneal dialysis was
resumed on postoperative day one.

The patient continued to do well except for one episode of
hypotension following dialysis on postoperative day two.  The
patient did well over the next several days increasing her
activity and dietary intake and managing her own peritoneal
dialysis; however, she did remain on an insulin infusion
throughout postoperative day five.

On postoperative day six, the patient was deemed stable and
ready to be discharged to home.  At the time of discharge,
her physical examination revealed vital signs with a
temperature of 96.1, heart rate 86, blood pressure 120/68,
respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturation 99% on room air.
Weight preoperatively was 64.2 kg; on discharge 72.7 kg.

Laboratories on [**3-8**] revealed a sodium of 132,
potassium 4.5, chloride 105, bicarbonate 19, BUN 46,
creatinine 4.1, glucose 184.  Calcium 6.4, magnesium 2.4,
phosphate 2.9.  White blood cell count 9, hematocrit 26.4.
PT 12, INR 1.

Physical examination revealed alert and oriented times three
and moved all extremities and followed commands.  Respiratory
revealed breath sounds were somewhat diminished in the bases;
otherwise, clear to auscultation.  Coronary revealed a
regular rate and rhythm, S1/S2.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Sternum was stable.  Incision with Steri-Strips, open to air,
clean and dry.  Abdomen was soft, nontender, positive bowel
sounds.  Tenckhoff was intact as was insulin infusion pump.
Extremities were warm and well perfused with 1 to 2+ edema
bilaterally.
