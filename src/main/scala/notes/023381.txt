[**8-17**] Head CT
 No evidence for intracranial hemorrhage.
.
[**8-17**] CXR
Partial collapse of the right middle lobe; no definite
underlying pneumonia, but considering the clinical presentation
and severe leukocytosis, a chest CT could be performed to
exclude both pneumonia and an endobronchial lesion.
.
[**8-20**] CXR - improved pneumonia, No evidence of layering effusions
on either side. The previously noted right pleural effusion on
the study of [**2136-8-19**] has resolved.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 49yo female with extensive psych history, who is s/p a
sexual assault three days ago, who is admitted on sepsis
protocol with RLL/RML pneumonia.
.
1. Pneumonia/Sepsis: Likely that sepsis was secondary to
patient's severe pneumonia.  Patient presented with temp 101.9,
HR 130s, lactate 6.3, WBC of 28.6, and 96% on RA (100% on NRB).
CXR showed partial collapse of the right middle lobe and
recommended CT scan for better evaluation of what caused the
collapse (likely a pneumonia). CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis
identified a RLL pneumonia but no abscess or other foci of fever
in pelvis.   Had right pleural effusion, most likely a
para-pneumonic effusion.   Abdominal CT and urinalysis were
negative for other fever sources and urine cx is negative at
time of discharge.   Blood cultures x2 were obtained and are
negative at time of discharge.  Pt complained of achiness all
over, stiff neck, photophobia and a fever, so an LP was
performed to r/o meningitis. Gram stain of her CSF showed no
microorganisms and only 1 WBC, 3 RBC on cell count. Glu and
protein were normal. Once her CSF was normal, abx were narrowed
down to IV levaquin.  CSF cx was negative at time of discharge.
.
She was treated initially with IV levofloxacin.  Her fever broke
and she felt much better over the next two days.  She was
changed to po levofloxacin and remained afebrile with good
oxygenation on room air for the rest of the admission.  CXray on
[**8-20**] demonstrated improvement of her pneumonia and complete
resolution of the pleural effusion.  She will need to have 10
more days of oral levofloxacin to complete her treatment.  No
further imaging is required.
.
2. Psych/Benzo/EtOH withdrawal: Pt was placed on a CIWA scale
with diazepam 5-10mg IV q2-4h prn for CIWA >10.  She was
continued on the CIWA scale for the first 4 days of her
admission requiring valium.  SHe remained hemodynamically
stable.  Currently the patient is hallucination free.  She has
severe anxiety and has been medicating herself with benzos, and
further self medicating with EtOH.  She was also evaluated by
psych who felt she was appropriate for an inpatient psych
facility.
.
3) Pain - Patient reports "total body pain".  The pain is not
localized to any anotomical cause.  This is likely a functional
pain and does not have a specific medical cause as evidenced by
her normal labs, abd/pevis CT, and lumbar puncture.  Opoids are
not the treatment of cho
