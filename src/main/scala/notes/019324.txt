History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 14738**] is a 61 y/o F with hx of mild dHF, HTN, bicuspid AV,
s/p mechanical AVR on coumadin (INR 2.4 on admission), severe
asthma (on prednisone) who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for [**Hospital 16186**] after presenting there for syncope.  She has a hx of
severe asthma and has been on prednisone for the last 6-7 years
with inability to wean due to increased wheezing and SOB.  She
states that over the last 6 months she has had more frequent
episodes of "blacking out" that seem to occur after using her
asthma inhalers.  During each episode she denies CP, SOB, but
has some nausea.  Yesterday, while at her daughter's house she
was sitting on the couch and blacked out on two separate
occasions lasting a few seconds and then she came two.  She was
hospitalized [**2184-7-5**] year ago for similar c/o and was
monitored continuously on Tele, with no events detected.

At OSH, VS 98.8, 121/48, 48, 21 98%RA.  EKG obtained at OSH was
c/w CHB with infranodal escape with RB at 43BPM.  She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.  Upon transfer in
the ED she had another syncopal episode and was apparently in
Sinus tachy to 110 at this point.  EKG at this time showed sinus
tachycardia with RBBB.  EP was called and was told to give
Metop, but it was not given.  They repleted his K and sent
admitted him to the CCU.

Upon admission to the CCU, initial EKG showed sinus tachycardic
with 1st degree AVB with a LBBB pattern.  During initial
evaluation, the patient had a 9 second pause on tele during
which time the patient reported "blacking out".  Her rhythm
returned spontaneously and repeat EKG at this time showed CHB
with RBBB pattern.  After which, emergent temporary pacer was
placed in the right ventricle via a right IJ Cordis.  The wires
are situated in the posterior RV, placement confirmed by CXR
post-procedure. She is currently being paced at 50bpm, MA 5mV.

Brief Hospital Course:
61 y/o F with hx of mild dHF, HTN, bicuspid AV, s/p mechanical
AVR on coumadin (INR 2.4 on admission), severe asthma (on
standing prednisone) who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH after
presenting with syncope found to be in CHB and 9-sec pause on
tele.
.
# SYNCOPE - likely due to arrhythmia septal disease in the area
involving the bundle of His, potentially exacerbated by
increased albuterol use (increased heart rate inducing prolonged
pausing at AV node). Initially had temporary pacer placed on
admission. Permanent pacermaker placed by EP on [**8-9**]. We started
metoprolol 25mg PO Q8H. Post op we started Vancomycin and then
switched to PO Clindamycing 450 q8 x 48 hours for prophylaxis.
Pt set up with EP follow up.
.
-------
CHRONIC
-------
# HTN - pt normotensive during admission. We continued losartan
50mg po daily, added metop 25mg PO Q8H for control of
arrhythmia.
.
# AV Replacement: Mechanical AVR in [**2175**] for bicuspid AV, recent
Echo ([**6-/2185**]) showed that valve with well seated with no
evidence of dehiscence. We continued Warfarin at home dose (4mg
PO daily)
.
#  ASTHMA: Patient has severe asthma in setting of possible mold
contamination in her home.  She has been on prednisone for last
6-7 years with inability to wean. We continued prednisone 10mg
PO daily, Ipratroprium/Budesonide nebs, Albuterol PRN
.
#  DM Type 2 vs Steroid Induced: Last A1C (7%, [**2185-7-28**]) not
currently on any home DM medications. We treated with Insulin SC
