Radiology
[**1-18**] CXR: An area of consolidation has developed within the left
lower lobe, consistent with pneumonia. Given the focal
distribution, bacterial pneumonia is considered most likely. The
lungs are otherwise clear, and there is no definite
lymphadenopathy. Heart size remains normal.

[**1-22**] CXR: Interval improvement in left lower lobe consolidation.
Suggestion of a thin-walled bulla in the left lower lobe.
Attention to this area on followup examination is recommended.


Brief Hospital Course:
42 year old male with HIV presents with productive cough, fever,
and hypotension, admitted to ICU for septic shock secondary to
bacterial pneumonia

1) Septic shock/bacterial pneumonia: The patient was admitted to
the ICU, where he was fluid resuscitated, covered with broad
antibiotics (Zosyn/levofloxacin), and treated with pressors to
maintain a MAP >65. He responded well and was transferred to the
general medical floor on Zosyn/azithromycin. Given continued
fevers and history of MRSA (although sputum culture with only
oropharyngeal flora), vancomycin was added to his regimen with
rapid improvement in symptoms. He completed a 5 day course of
azithromycin and was discharged on cefpodoxime and vancomycin
(PICC line placed [**1-24**]). Blood cultures had no growth to date at
the time of discharge and urinalysis was negative.

2) HIV: Most recent office visit note [**5-/2171**] noted CD4 count of
645 and undetectable VL. He was continued on Lopinavir-Ritonavir
and Combivir.

3) Anemia: The patient's hematocrit dropped to a nadir of 28 on
[**1-19**] from 38. Iron studies were not consistent with iron
deficiency and vitamin B12/folate were normal. The hematocrit
drop was most likely due to sepsis-related marrow suppression
and hemodilution in the setting of volume resuscitation. The
patient's hematocrit gradually rose and was 36 on discharge.

4) Depression: The patient was continued on fluoxetine.
