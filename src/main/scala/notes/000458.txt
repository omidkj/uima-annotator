Pertinent Results:
[**2166-6-26**] Echocardiogram: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
akinesis of the basal to mid inferolateral wall, hypokinesis of
the anterolateral wall. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %). Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

[**2166-6-26**] Chest CTA: 1. Acute pulmonary embolus in the left
descending pulmonary artery, extending in the lingula, and basal
truncus, involving more than half of the vessel lumen. No
evidence of right heart strain. 2. No pneumonia. No evidence of
active, or chronic granulomatous disease.

[**2166-6-26**] Lower Extremity Ultrasound: No evidence of deep vein
thrombosis in either leg.

[**2166-6-26**] Carotid Ultrasound: Right ICA with no stenosis. Left ICA
with no stenosis.

[**2166-6-27**] Intraop TEE: PRE-CPB: 1. The left atrium is mildly
dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage. No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. 2.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. 3. There
is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %). There is
moderate lateral hypokinesis. 4. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. 5. The ascending, transverse
and descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of
atherosclerotic plaque. There are simple atheroma in the aortic
arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. 6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. 7. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The pericardium may be thickened. **Prior to
bypass, there was an episode of hypotension with EKG changes.
TEE showed severe hypokinesis of the anterior and anteroseptal
walls, with an LVEF of 10 %. CPR was initiated and the patient
emergently placed on cardiopulmonary bypass.** POST-CPB: On
infusions of vasopressin, Epi, Norepinephrine, Milrinone. In
sinus rhythm. Improved anterior wall on inotropic support, with
LVEF now 35%. MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] remain trace. There is no change in the
aortic contour post decannulation.

[**2166-7-1**] Head CT Scan: 1. Limited study due to patient motion. A
small hypodensity in the right parieto-occipital lobe is of
indeterminate age, likely chronic. No acute intracranial
hemorrhage or acute major vascular territorial infarction. 2.
Marked paranasal sinus disease as above.

[**2166-7-2**] EEG: This is an abnormal video EEG study because of
severe diffuse background slowing and disorganization. These
findings are indicative of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction,
which is etiologically non-specific. There were no epileptiform
discharges or electrographic seizures.

[**2166-7-2**] MRI Head/Brain: 1. Innumerable punctate foci of signal
on the diffusion-weighted images, many of which are also bright
on FLAIR suggestive of multiple acute, likely embolic, infarcts.
A more confluent area of FLAIR signal abnormality in the right
posterior temporal lobe could be another area of older infarct.
2. Scattered punctate foci of susceptibility artifact could
represent areas of microhemorrhage or calcification.

[**2166-7-6**] Abd Ultrasound: Limited view of pancreas. No evidence of
cholelithiasis or intra-or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.

Final Report
INDICATION: Evaluate for aspiration in patient with history of
aspiration.
FINDINGS: Barium passes freely through the oropharynx without
evidence of
obstruction. The patient demonstrates a slow oral phase and weak
swallow with weak pharyngeal muscle contraction. There is
penetration and aspiration of thin barium without penetration or
aspiration of nectar or thick barium. The patient does sense the
aspiration and coughs appropriately. He has an increased residue
in both the valleculae and piriform sinuses, which spills over
in between swallows. For more details please see the speech and
swalllow division note in OMR.
There is again noted an opacity projecting over the tracheal air
column that likely represents an endoluminal lesion, possibly
tracheal polyp or other mass lesion. Recommend further
evaluation with direct visualization or Neck CT.
IMPRESSION:
1. Aspiration of thin barium without aspiration of thick or
nectar barium
which represents some improvement from the prior study.
2. Lesion projecting over the trachea that may represent
tracheal polyp or
other mass lesion. Recommend further evaluation with dedicated
CT of trachea or direct visualization for further evaluation.
