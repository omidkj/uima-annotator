Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
72-year-old male with AChR +ve myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], Duodenal
angiomas, asthma, diastolic CHF and AF who presented following a
4 day hx of fever, chills, and generalized weakness. Patient
felt hot with chills past 2 nights for which he did not take his
temperature but took acetamionophen for this. He noticed
increasing wheeze past 2 days and did feel more SOB yesterday
with no cough, sputum or hemoptysis. Since last night noted
palpitations with an associated "funny feeling" in the chest.
THis was a mild chest pressure which lasted 2 minutes and
subsided. He had further sweating, fever, palpitations and chest
discomfort (again which was self-limiting lasting 2 minutes per
pt) and called an ambulance. Upon EMS arrival the patient was in
a rapid AF with a heart rate about 130, O2 sat was approximately
95% on 4 L. Patient denies any chest pain, but noted mild
difficulty breathing and mild nausea. Of note, he had missed his
diltiazem this am. He denied emesis or abdominal pain. No recent
hospital admissions.
.
In the ED, patient was noted to have a low grade temp 100 and
was in fast AF with rate 130's and 94% 3L NC. CXR showed
multifocal pneumonia. Labs demonstrated WBC 13 pt received,
acetaminophen, IV levoflox/vancomycin and 2L NS and his SBP was
110's. No rate control was given. ECG showed fast AF with no
ischemic changes. Vitals on transfer were 120 139/93 27-30 97%
3L NC.
.
Regarding myasthenic sx pt noted increased generalised weakness
past 4 days with no diplopia or blurred vision and no swallowing
problems. [**Name (NI) **] did not take any of his myasthenia meds until in
the [**Hospital Unit Name **] which may account for his significant dysarthria
although patient denies diplopia.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] vitals were T 99.6 123/91 HR 143 RR 19
sO2 97% 2.5L O2. Patient was complaining of soem SOB and mild
wheeze and otherwise not disturbed by tacycardia.

ROS: The patient denies any weight change, nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, melena, hematochezia,
orthopnea, PND, lower extremity oedema, cough, urinary

focal weakness, vision changes, headache, rash or skin changes.

Radiology

XR CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2192-12-2**] 12:25 PM
FINDINGS: There is a rounded opacity in the right upper lobe.
There is left
basilar atelectasis. Lung volumes are slightly low. The cardiac
silhouette,
hilar and mediastinal contours appear within normal limits.
There is no
pneumothorax or pleural effusion.

IMPRESSION: Right upper lobe consolidative opacity worrisome for
pneumonia.
Recommend repeat chest radiograph after appropriate treatment to
assess for
resolution. Left basilar atelectasis.
.
XR CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2192-12-3**] 5:07 AM
Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed in comparison to
[**2192-12-2**].

The right upper lobe rounded opacity appears to be slightly
bigger than on the prior study and might be consistent with
gradual progression of infectious process. Left retrocardiac
consolidation is unchanged. Right basal atelectasis is
unchanged. Cardiomediastinal si
