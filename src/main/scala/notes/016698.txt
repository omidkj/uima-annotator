Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2356**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Cath
Placement of Tunelled IJ Catheter and initiation on Dialysis


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 69 yo M with a history of CAD (cardiac cath [**2180**]),
pacer ([**2186**]) and renal failure who presented to an OSH with
dyspnea. Per OSH records the patient had increased DOE (+/-
chest pain) who was found to have elevated trop (>17),
creatinine (7.1) with ST depressions. While at the outside
hospital he was found to have persistent hypoglycemia and at
times required a dextrose drip and was in the ICU. He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catherization with dialysis.
.
On presentation the patient describes having a "diabetic
seizure" at home ([**8-14**] or [**8-15**])that caused him to call 911. He
reports being at home and becoming itchy and sweaty. He then
awakened and found that he had fallen from his couch. He reports
initial disorientation and found things thrown around (as is
typical when he has had seizures). He reports that in the days
prior to admission he had shortness of breath with bending over
and occasional orthopnea (may be frequent) that has persisted
for the last 2-3 months. He was also recently admitted (end of
[**Month (only) **]) and was treated with increased dose of lasix (40 mg) and
ruled out for MI and had stopped taking it prior to that
admission. He denies any chest pain except for the pain at his
rib fractures.
.
On review of symptoms, he has occasional cough denies any prior
history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary
embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, joint pains,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers,
chills or rigors. All of the other review of systems were
negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or palpitations (none since
pacer).

IMAGING:
Admission CXR:FINDINGS: Dual lead pacemaker is unchanged. The
heart is mildly enlarged. There is pulmonary vascular
redistribution with hazy bilateral vasculature suggesting fluid
overload/CHF. There is a more focal area of consolidation at
right lower lobe that could be due to asymmetric pulmonary edema
but an infectious infiltrate cannot be totally excluded.

IMPRESSION: CHF

Cardiac Catherization:
1.  Coronary angiography in this left dominant system
demonstrated three
vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had a 20% stenosis at
its
origin. The proximal LAD was slightly aneurysmal. There was a
50%
in-stent restenosis. The high diagonal (near ramus) was
diffusely
diseased to 50%. The D2 was diffusely diseased. The proximal LCX
had no
angiographycally apparent disease. The OM3 was diffusely
diseased to 80%
proximally. The LPL had a 90% proximal stenosis. The proximal
RCA had no
angiographycally apparent disease. The AM had a 90% lesion with
diffuse
disease beyond.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed systemic systolic hypertension
of
159/63 mmHg.
3.  Left ventriculography revealed no non-ectopic mitral
regurgitation.
The LVEF was calculated to be 35-40% with apical akinesis,
severe
inferobasal hypokinesis, high lateral severe hypokinesis, and
global
hypokinesis elsewhere.
4.  Successful balloon angioplasty of the LPL with a 2.0 x 10 mm

balloon. Final angiography revealed a 40% residual stenosis,
with no
angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI grade III flow
(see PTCA
comments)

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Systemic systolic arterial hypertension
3. Moderate LV systolic heart failure.
4. Normal LV diastolic function.
5. Successful PTCA of the LPL.


Brief Hospital Course:
69 YO m with a history of CAD, CKD, presenting with renal
failure and NSTEMI.

1)NSTEMI: Patient with know CAD and history of stenting that
presented  with persistent ST depressions and troponin elevation
at OSH (troponin peak 17). However, he remains asymptomatic. His
CKMB appears to be downward trending and ST changes are not
progressing.  He was kept on heparin gtt until he was able to
get a cardiac catherizatio which showed 3 vessel disease with a
tight LPL that was stented.  After this he was kept on reopro
post catherization.  He had downward trending of CKs and no
episod
