Brief Hospital Course:
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], a CT angiogram was performed on arrival
here and this showed an occlusion of the aorta and the entire
iliac system starting just distal to the renal arteries. There
was reconstitution of the common femoral arteries in the groin
with profunda femoris runoff as the only obvious vessels. She
has COPD and has been ill for several days, recently had
pneumonia and was advised to have an axillary [**Hospital1 **]-femoral graft.

She underwent bypass and, post-operatively, she did relatively
well, although she was in rate controlled atrial fibrillation
and her left leg was quite ischemic. She was stable enough to be
transferred to the VICU on POD#2. A CT angiogram was performed
on [**9-13**], and this showed a tight SMA stenosis with
reconstituted distal blood flow, along with chronic celiac/[**Female First Name (un) 899**]
narrowing. Based on these findings, she was taken to the
operating room on [**9-13**] and an SMA stent was placed to restore
flow.

On [**2146-9-14**], the patient suffered respiratory failure, was
intubated and was transferred back to the CVICU. She was noted
to have a distended abdomen and bowel gas pattern consistent
with ileus; her lactate level was 2.0. Out of concern for
mesenteric ischemia, the patient was taken to the operating room
on [**9-14**] for an exploratory laparotomy. Intra-operatively, her
bowel was viable and there were no signs of ischemia/infarct.
Afterward, she was noted to be quite fluid avid, but hypotensive
despite aggressive fluid resuscitation. She was administered
pressors and a pulmonary artery catheter was placed. Her peak
inspiratory pressures were in the 40s. The resulting clinical
picture revealed abdominal compartment syndrome, and the patient
was again taken to the operating room on [**9-16**]. Her intestines
were again found to be viable, and her abdomen was left open.

The remainder of her hospital course was characterized by a
waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] course during which she remained on pressors,
and her limbs remained ischemic. With increasing doses of
pressors, her limb ischemia would worsen, and perfusion would
improve as doses were lowered. She also was noted to have
steadily rising liver function tests, and she was increasingly
coagulopathic.

On [**9-27**], she took a turn for the worse when, for the first time
in her hospital course, she was noted to be oliguric. Her
pressor requirement began to increase as well. She was notably
more cyanotic and was reverted to full ventilatory support due
to tachypnea. An urgent family meeting was called, and the 3
children, one of whom was designated health care proxy, made the
decision to make the patient "DNR". Over the next 2 days, she
steadily worsened in her hemodynamics, and expired on [**2146-9-29**] at
14:52. Family declined autopsy.
