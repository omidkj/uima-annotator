HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 40-year-old
female with a history of C3-C4 quadriplegia, chronic adrenal
insufficiency and history of Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia presenting to the Emergency
Room with mental status changes.  Of note, she had recently
been admitted for hypoxia and similar symptoms.  At
rehabilitation, the patient was found to be very lethargic
with O2 saturations at 80% and she was sent to the Emergency
Room where she received Narcan and immediately improved with
her mental status.  She complained of pain all over and was
given 4 mg of morphine and became unresponsive again and was
once again improved with Narcan.  She was noted to have left
basilar opacity and left pleural effusion on chest x-ray.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  C3-C4 spinal cord injury, status post secondary to motor
vehicle accident in [**2139**]
2.  Quadriplegia
3.  History of gastroesophageal reflux disease
4.  History of depression
5.  Chronic adrenal insufficiency
6.  Chronic pain
7.  History of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus
pneumonia

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN AND SULFA

Of note, the patient has been intubated multiple times over
the past several months and required hospital admissions for
this.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
VITAL SIGNS:  The patient presented to the Emergency Room
with a temperature of 98.9??????, heart rate 70, blood pressure
100/52, respiratory rate 90, oxygen saturation 90% on room
air.
GENERAL:  She initially was responsive to voice.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Pupils equal, round and
reactive to light.  Extraocular muscles were intact.  Neck
was supple.
LUNGS:  Diffusely rancorous bilaterally.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, slightly distended with guaiac negative
stools.
EXTREMITIES:  Lower extremities were without any edema.  The
patient had two notable ulcers.  The first was fourth degree
pressure ulcer over the sacral region which is approximately
2 inches deep and 4 inches wide with mostly granulation
tissue covering the wound surface.  There is no appreciable
fluctuance or a closed cavity.  There is no area of
surrounding cellulitis.  The patient's left shoulder had a
second degree pressure ulcer with an eschar over it.

ADMISSION LABS:  The patient had white count of 7.2 with 73%
neutrophils, 19% lymphocytes.  Hematocrit was 38.6 and
platelets were 309.  Chem-7 was within normal limits.
Admission chest x-ray showed the presence of a left basilar
opacity which was new as well as a small left pleural
effusion.  Urinalysis showed large blood, positive nitrites,
6 to 10 red blood cells and greater than 50 white blood
cells.  Admission head CT was negative for intracranial
hemorrhage.  Admission abdominal KUB showed there was no
evidence of intestinal obstruction or fecal impaction.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1.  Pulmonary:  The patient presented with history of C3-C4
quadriplegia presenting with decreased oxygen saturations.
The decrease oxygen saturation is likely secondary to causes
including oversedation due to her pain medications as causing
decreased respiratory drive as well as left lower lobe
pneumonia.  The patient has had a sputum culture during this
hospital admission which grew out coagulase positive
Staphylococcus.  The Staphylococcus was resistant to
oxacillin.  Therefore, the patient was treated with a 14 day
course of vancomycin.  Aggressive chest physical therapy was
continued during her hospital admission.  Also of note on the
patient's pain regimen, she was responsive without episodes
of oversedation.

2.  Endocrine:  The patient has a history of adrenal
insufficiency and was treated with high doses of
hydrocortisone in the Emergency Room and her prednisone was
continued throughout the hospital admission.

3.  Infectious disease:  The patient has etiologies of
infection including pneumonia given chest x-ray.  Also, the
patient had a urinalysis which was notable for greater than
50 white cells.  However, her Foley was changed on the [**5-31**].  The repeat urinalysis was unremarkable and the
cultures for the urinalysis showed no growth.  The patient
also had wound swabs which were performed and the wound swabs
were notable for 1+ polymorphonuclear leukocytes as well as
2+ gram negative rods.  The gram negative rods grew out
greater than four colonial morphologies.  The wound culture
also grew out Pseudomonas which was sensitive to cefepime and
intermediate to ceftazidine.  The patient is to complete a
seven day course of antibiotics for the Pseudomonas.  The
patient during the hospital admission was hemodynamically
stable and afebrile.

4.  Pain:  The patient was seen by the pain control services
during this admission.  They recommended a possible trial of
baclofen intrathecal injection in the future.  In addition,
the patient's pain medications including the OxyContin,
oxycodone and Neurontin were continued.  The patient's
baclofen was continued and Zanaflex was added to the
patient's anti-muscle spasm medication.  The patient has a
follow up with the pain clinic on [**8-31**] for a trial of
the baclofen injection.

5.  Wound ulcers:  The patient has a history of the sacral
decubitus ulcer as well as the grade 2 ulcer on the right
chest wall.  She was seen by the plastic surgery team during
this admission.  The plastic surgery team felt that there is
no acute evidence of cellulitis and there is not a need for
debridement or reconstruction at the time.  However, she may
follow up as needed for future consideration for possible
reconstructive measures in the plastic surgery clinic.  They
recommended continuing current wet to dry dressing changes,
as well as preventing pressure with frequent position
changes.

DISPOSITION:  Patient to return to [**Hospital3 20374**].  The patient's
