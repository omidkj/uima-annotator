Brief Hospital Course:
NEURO: Pain controlled with methadone, oxycodone & fentanyl.
Lethargic & nonreponsive postop. Neurology consult obtained.
Negative EEG, CT, LP, MRI head/spine. Most recently, much
improved, alert and oriented. Pain medications weaned off.
Restlessness controlled on Ativan 2mg qid. Restarted on psych
medications (venlafaxine, olanzapine). Psychiatry service
following.

CV: HTN controlled with lopressor & diltiazem. Echo WNL.

RESP: Prolonged respiratory failure, percutaenous tracheostomy
[**4-14**]. Then weaned fairly rapidly off the vent to trach collar.

FEN: Postoperatively fluid overloaded, diuresed with lasix &
diamox, now approaching admission weight and euvolemic. TPN
postoperatively but quickly changed to enteral feedings.

HEME: Found to be HIT+ on POD2, started on lepirudin drip.
Started coumadin after trach on [**4-14**], but developed blood loss
anemia requiring transfusion on [**4-19**]. Guaiac positive, but hct
responded to transfusion & NG lavage was negative for blood or
coffee grounds. Lepirudin & coumadin restarted. Coumadin

ENDO: Initially insulin drip, no adrenal insufficiency,
recently, BS well controlled on minor insulin sliding scale.

WOUND: Left open postop to prevent compartment syndrome & allow
