Chief Complaint:
fatigue, Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**8-8**] Right Heart Cath; swan placement
[**8-10**] Right Subclavian PICC line placement

History of Present Illness:
HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS: 80 year old male with a history
of coronary artery disease status post 2 prior CABG operations
(in [**2128**] and [**2138**]) and multiple prior myocardial infarctions
resulting in infarct related cardiomyopathy with a LVEF of 15%,
Biventricular ICD, mitral regurgitation status post
bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement in [**2155**], atrial
fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, hypertension and
hyperlipidemia, who has had a steady decline in his functional
status over the last few months.

He was last seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**2160-4-13**].  At that visit
he was noted to be grossly volume overloaded in the setting of
omitting lasix doses while caring for his sick wife.  His dose
of lasix was increased with significant improvement in his
symptoms.

He notes that over the last 3-4 weeks, however, he has been in a
slow functional decline. Overall his symptoms are now closer to
NYHA class III than NYHA class II than they were in [**Month (only) 1096**]
[**2159**].
 - No longer has any appetite, lost ~ 6 lbs since the end of
[**Month (only) **]/begining of [**Month (only) 205**] (weight this morning was 139.5 lbs).
 - He feels tired and fatigued (often has to take naps
throughout the day); he is having difficulty sleeping due to
"racing thoughts" and difficulty finding a comfortable position,
but states that he is not having orthopnea or PND.  His
breathing has been feeling "wheezy" at times.
 - He has been feeling "shaky" and "unsteady", and notes that
although this has been chronic, it may now be slightly worse. He
feels very weak and notes that although he does not have any
shortness of breath at rest, when he walks across the street to
get the mail he feels profound fatigue and does get dyspnic.  He
is also feeling more unsteady on his feet, and has had about 3
minor mechanical falls in the last month. but has not had any
other neurologic symptoms.

He saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3321**] on [**7-9**] who thought the patient's symptoms
might improve with a higher heart rate.  His Toprol XL 50 mg
twice daily was discontinued, and his pacemaker lower rate was
increased from 60 to 75 bpm.  He was also started on sertraline
on the chance that his symptoms of fatigue and insomnia were
realted to depression.  Despite this change, the patient's
symptoms did not significantly improve.

He was seen in the heart failure clinic on [**8-8**] where he
appeared significantly volume overloaded on exam today, with
prominent elevation in his JVP.  Addtionally his severe fatigue,
loss of appetite and a resultant loss of body mass, difficultly
sleeping, and severe dyspnea on exertion were felt to be from
low cardiac output.  Therefore he was admitted to CCU for
diureisis, placement of swan and possible initiation of
milrinone if he has low CI.

Review of systems is otherwise negative in detail: he has no
chest pain, palpitations, lightheadedness, presyncope, syncope,
focal neurologic symptoms, bleeding on coumadin, fevers, chills,
abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting.  Review of systems is
otherwise unremarkable.

.
Office EKG ([**8-8**]) reveals A-V sequential biventricular pacing at
75 bpm with a markedly prolonged QRS of ~200 milliseconds.  This
is unchanged from prior.
.
Right Heart Cath: [**2160-8-8**]
COMMENTS:
1.  Limited resting hemodynamics showed elevated right sided
filling
pressures with an LVEDP of 17 mmHg and severely elevated left
sided
filling pressures with a mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure
of 44
mmHg.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Markedly elevated left and right sided filling pressures.
2.  Recommend diuresis and inotropes.
.
CXR Port Line Placement: [**2160-8-8**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  Right internal jugular vascular sheath in standard position
with no
visible pneumothorax.
2.  Congestive heart failure with interstitial edema and small
effusions.
.
CXR [**2160-8-10**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  Right internal jugular sheath unchanged in position.  A
left-sided
pacemaker also unchanged.  Status post median sternotomy for
CABG.  The heart  continues to be enlarged and has a globular
configuration which could reflect cardiomegaly, although a
pericardial effusion should also be considered.  There is a
persistent but improved vascular congestion.  There is
persistent retrocardiac opacity which may reflect patchy
atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entire
