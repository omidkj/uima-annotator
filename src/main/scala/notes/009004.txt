Service:  ICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75 year old with
history of congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, who was originally
admitted with pneumonia to the Medical service and
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for respiratory
failure.  The patient saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] one week prior to
admission complaining of five weeks of progressive dyspnea on
exertion without fevers or sputum.  Chest x-ray showed no new
disease.  Given his response to steroids in the past, he was
started on 60 mg of Prednisone.  Three days prior to
admission he had worsening shortness of breath and also had
some brown sputum and was started on Levaquin. Despite this,
he had a fever of 101 and came into the Emergency Department.
He denied any chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis,
increased wheezing from baseline or episodes of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea.

He was admitted to the general medical service and started on
Ceftazidime and Azithromycin for concern about pseudomonas,
but he continued to have dyspnea and progressive
desaturation.  He had thick increased secretions starting the
day prior to Intensive Care Unit transfer but was able to
bring them up.  The a.m. of transfer, he was noted to be
obtunded, cyanotic and tachypneic and he was then intubated.
Vital signs were temperature of 97, pulse 112, respiratory
rate 30s and oxygen saturation of 98% on 100% nonrebreather.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease with a history of congestive
heart failure, ejection fraction of 20%.  Mild pulmonary
hypertension.  Moderate global right ventricular hypokinesis
with a myocardial infarction and catheterization showing
three vessel disease, status post VF arrest approximately
five years ago, status post ICD placement.
2.  Severe bullous emphysema with last FEV1 36% of predicted
and FVC of 27% predicted on home oxygen four to five up to
ten liters.  On chronic Prednisone 7.5 mg once daily.
Question of some interstitial lung disease from Amiodarone.
3.  Mild renal insufficiency.
4.  Question of transient ischemic attack.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin which caused hives.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1.  Flovent.
2.  Albuterol.
3.  Serevent.
4.  Insulin sliding scale.
5.  Ceftazidime and Azithromycin.
6.  Ultram.
7.  Tylenol.
8.  Singulair.
9.  Lipitor.
10. Prednisone.
11. Zantac.
12. Plavix.
13. Aspirin.
14. Subcutaneous Heparin.
15. Quinaglute.
16. Digoxin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Immediately after intubation, this is
a well developed, well nourished elderly man in no acute
distress.  The neck was supple with visible jugular venous
distention lying flat.  His lungs were coarse bilaterally,
decreased at the bases.  He was tachycardia with a regular
rhythm, I/VI systolic murmur.  He had positive bowel sounds,
nontender, nondistended.  He had some bluish discoloration
over his shins and no palpable pulses. Extremities were cool.
He withdrew to painful stimuli.

LABORATORY DATA:  Electrocardiogram showed tachycardia to 119
with some PR prolongation, right bundle branch block and left
anterior fascicular block similar to prior electrocardiogram.

Complete blood count with a white blood cell count of 10.0,
hematocrit 35.0, platelet count 234,000.  Coagulation studies
were within normal limits.  Creatinine increased to 2.0 from
baseline of 1.5.  Initial cardiac enzymes were negative.

INTENSIVE CARE UNIT COURSE:  His respiratory failure was
hypercarbic with initial pH of 7.2, 83, and 88, thought to be
possibly from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as he had
significant obstruction and thickened amount of auto PEEP.
Initially his antibiotics were changed to Ceftriaxone given
the gram positive cocci in sputum and Vancomycin was also
added.  Extremity noninvasive studies were negative for deep
vein thrombosis and he was unable to tolerate CTA secondary
to renal function.  Immediately after intubation, he became
hypotensive.  He was bolused with some fluid and started on
pressors.  His acute renal failure was suspected from
hypotension and respiratory arrest.

Over the course of the next 24 hours, he spiked a temperature
to 102 and then up to 105 with a progressive hypotension and
progressive worsening hypoxia with no clear change in his
chest x-ray. Cardiac enzymes returned positive with troponin
greater than 50.  He became oliguric and then anuric and had
hyperkalemic bradycardic event which responded to Atropine
and treatment of his hyperkalemia.  As he continued to
decline the next morning, discussion was held with his family
members, his wife, son and two daughters, and decision was
made especially in light of his recently declining health and
poor quality of life for the resuscitation efforts.  Several
hours later, the pressors were withdrawn and the patient
expired.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Septic shock from community acquired pneumonia.
2.  Myocardial infarction.
3.  Acute renal failure.
4.  Respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease.
