History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 6330**] is a 65 yo woman with DM2, CHF, diverticulosis, and
recent hospitalization at [**Hospital 8**] Hospital for aspiration
pneumonia c/b C diff colitis and LGIB, and several
hosptalizations/rehab stays for last 4 months. She was sent to
[**Hospital 8**] Hospital ED this a.m. from [**Hospital1 **] with hematochezia
and LLQ tenderness x 4 days. Pt did not see hematochezia herself
but was told by nursing staff that this was present. Hct there
was 26 and she was transfused 2uPRBC ([**1-14**] 35). Transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further management d/t no capacity for embolization or
surgery. NG lavage in the ER revealed bile only, no evidence of
blood. The GI team saw pt in the ER and recommended tagged RBC
scan. In the ER the pt had stable vital signs except tachycardia
to 120s. She received 4 units PRBC's in ED (although 2 of these
may have included [**Name (NI) 8**] [**Name (NI) **] - unclear), 3.5 L of NS.
.
Pt recently in [**Hospital 8**] hospital [**1-27**] with pneumonia treated
with Zosyn and developed Cfdiff, treated with PO flagyl. Had
some GI bleeding at that time and did not perform c-scope given
her infection. Also had some CP during that stay with negative
cardiac w/u including persantine mibi, and was started on dilt
and asa at that time. Has been in rehab for 5 days since
discharge from [**Hospital1 8**].
.
The patient presented to the MICU after tagged red cell scan was
completed. She complains of her usual back pain in the setting
of known spinal stenosis and rectal pain in setting of loose
stools/hematochezia. She has occasional abdominal pain, crampy,
that has been present since her last admission to [**Hospital 8**]
hospital and is no better or worse. Not exacerbated by food. No
recent NSAID use (allergic to ibuprofen). No fevers, chills,
nausea, vomiting. Last colonoscopy 5 yrs ago with
diverticulosis.
.
ROS: no fevers, chills, + cough with greenish sputum, improving,
no sore throat, congestion, HA, diploplia, chest pain, SOB. +
whole body pain and fatigue. occ. dysuria with foley catheter
chronically in place.

DIAGNOSTICS:
.
TAGGED RBC'S [**2198-2-11**]: Passage of blood clots with tagged RBCs
confirms active GI bleeding; localization is difficult but
appears likely in the sigmoid colon (first focus appears in the
first 5 minutes of the scan).
.
Emergency mesenteric angiography via left transfemoral approach
[**2198-2-11**]:
1.  No active bleeding demonstrated angiographically.
2.  Nonvisualization of the inferior mesenteric artery.
3.  Unremarkable celiac axis and superior mesenteric artery
branches.
.
CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS [**2198-2-14**]:
1.  Markedly limited examination due to patient's body habitus.
No definite CT evidence of colitis.
2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar airspace
disease.
.
UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US LEFT  [**2198-2-15**] 6:34 PM
No evidence of left upper extremity deep venous thrombosis. Left
brachial vein PICC line.
.
FLEX SIGMOIDOSCOPY:
Ulceration, friability and erythema in the rectum compatible
with ulcerative colitis, although Crohn's colitis possible
(biopsy). Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to rectum

Brief Hospital Course:
65yo woman with MMP including DM, recent pneumonia with Cdiff,
presents with hematochezia and tachycardia, transferred from
MICU to general medicine floor on [**2-16**], Hct and hemodynamics
stable.
.
#. GI Bleed:
Hematochezia with stable BP/tachycardia suggestive of likely
lower GI source. Differential includes diverticular bleed, AVM,
Cdiff colitis, ischemic colitis. Appreciate GI seeing pt in ER.
Normal lactate not suggestive of ischemia, unlikely to have this
degree of hematochezia from Cdiff, although possible, pt with
known diverticulosis making this leading differential. Last
scope 5 years ago was reportedly clean so malignancy less likely
but possible. Stool cultures for hemorrhagic bacterial
infections were negative. Tagged red cell scan positive. Patient
transfused total of 4 units in MICU and 1 unit platelets with
eventual stabilization of Hct. Angio could not localize
bleeding. Colonospcopy [**2198-2-13**] showed large blood and clots up to
20 cm from anus and therefore limited study. Repeat CTA of
abdomen/pelvis performed at request of GI for evaluation of
colon wall and source of bleed. CTA limited secondary to body
habitus but no contrast extravasation or frank colitis. Femoral
line discontinued [**2-14**], tip culture no growth. Due to limited
studies and uncertainty regarding location of bleeding, patient
had a flex sigmoidoscopy on [**2198-2-19**]. It revealed ulceration,
friability and erythema in the rectum compatible with ulcerative
colitis, although Crohn's colitis possible (biopsy). Pt remained
hemodynamically stable on general medicine floor.
- mesalamine enema qHS, suppository qAM
- await biopsy results
- Hct stable, monitor daily
- on PPI
- hold anticoagulation, including ASA
.
#. Pneumonia at OSH, now resolved:
LLL infiltrate with GNR in sputum diagnosed on [**1-27**] at OSH.
Patient was s/p 10 day course of zosyn (ended [**2-6**]). Upond
arrival to MICU, patient continued to have leukocytosis and
sputum production. CXR without infil
