HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient had largely unremarkable
hospital course.  The patient was originally admitted into
the intensive care unit, but was discharged upon repeat CT
which revealed the SAH to be stable.  The patient had no
neurological deficits on exam.  However, the patient
continued to have notable confusion and amnesia regarding
event.  The patient was transferred to the floor in stable
condition.

Behavioral neurology was consulted.  Upon evaluation, it was
noted that the patient did seem to have more confusion than
what would be expected from the mechanism of the trauma.
Therefore, the patient was to be discharged to rehab for
supervision, as 24-hour supervision would not be available at
home.  However, medically the patient's humerus fracture was
reduced by orthopedics and put in a cast.  In an attempt to
reduce patient agitation and clear-up mental status, efforts
were made to rectify the reverse of patient's sleep-awake
cycle.  At the time of discharge to rehab, the patient was in
stable condition with no new medical issues.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehab.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient will have follow-up at Trauma Clinic,
as well as neurosurgery, and orthopedics.  Please see
