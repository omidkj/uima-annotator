Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 287**]
Chief Complaint:
hematemesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Therapeutic paracentesis x2
EGD


History of Present Illness:
Patient doing well after discharge and was started on xeloda by
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].  However he noticed that he had 3 episodes of mild
coffee ground emesis over the past week.  The day of admission
he had an episode of emesis with 1 cup of bright red blood which
prompted him to come to the ED.  Since admission he has had [**3-24**]
episodes of hematemesis with only mild amounts of blood.
.
The patient was transfused 1 unit pRBC in the ED and transfered
to the MICU for urgent EGD.  The scope demonstrated portal
gastropathy but no bleeding or varices.  His Hct remained stable
and he was transferred to oncology.
.
On arrival to the floor the patient felt well.  He denied
nausea, diarrhea, hematochezia, melena, chest pain, shortness of
breath, numbness, tingling, confusion, or change in
vision/hearing.  He did complain of some abd pain consistent
with his swelling from ascites.

Past Medical History:
1) Hepatoma (likely due to HCV) diagnosed in [**3-23**] with
involvement of portal vein and spread to lung. Originally
treated with DENSPM (N1, N11-Diethylnorspermine) a polyamine
analog. This was stopped secondary to liver toxicity. He was
then treated with four cycles of cisplatc/gemcitibine. His
cancer progressed though this and he was started on adriamycin
with last chemo [**2158-9-25**].
2)IV drug abuse
3)hepatitis C for at least six years
4) back surgery


Social History:
He does not drink any alcohol. Smokes ~10 cigarettes per day.
IVDU - last use several weeks ago; enrolled in methadone clinic


Family History:
Mother with breast cancer and
skin cancer, grandfather with [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer, grandfather on the
other side with [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer, uncle with prostate cancer, and
grandmother with liver cancer.

Physical Exam:

neg per ED
Ext - w/wp, +1 edema bilat
Neuro - no asterixis


Pertinent Results:
Abd U/S w/ doppler [**10-13**]:
Continued thrombosis of left portal vein. Main portal vein
appears patent. Background ascites and chronic liver disease.
.
AP CXR [**10-13**]:
A right internal jugular vascular sheath has been placed in the
interval, terminating in the right brachiocephalic vein. Cardiac
silhouette is normal in size. Again visualized are diffuse
bilateral pulmonary nodules. Superimposed discoid atelectasis is
noted at the right lung base, and there is mild elevation of the
right hemidiaphragm. There are innumerable bilateral pulmonary
nodules involving all lobes of both lungs, reportedly due to
metastatic disease from hepatocellular carcinoma.
.
CT abdomen w/ contrast [**10-15**]:
1. Dramatic increase in size and number of innumerable pulmonary
metastases.
2. Bilateral subsegmental and segmental pulmonary emboli.
Presumably, these are new.
3. New ascites. The size of the left lobe hepatoma appears to
have increased, though accurate measurements are difficult to
obtain. There is also subtle area of hypo attenuation within
segment 5, which is of unclear significance, but may represent
new disease. There is no biliary dilation.
4. Stable appearance of portal vein thrombosis. The splenic vein
remains patent.

Brief Hospital Course:
52 yo M with HCV, HCC s/p recent admission for enterococcal line
infection presents with recent hematemesis and acute on chronic
liver failure.
.
1) Hematemesis - Noted to have 1 cup bright red blood, then
received 1U PRBC in ED and admitted to MICU for emergent EGD on
[**10-13**].  The scope did not show varices or other obvious source
of bleed.  The pt has continued to have 5-6 episodes of emesis
but w/ only mild amount of blood.  Patient with stable Hct and
hemodynamically stable for the remainder of his admission.  Has
been having some emesis but without bleeding.  Last Hct was 40.
Nausea was controlled w/ compazine, reglan and anzemet, morphine
2-4mg iv q4prn and ativan iv prn
.
2) Liver Failure - Patient with HCV cirrhosis, progressive
metastatic HCC, and portal vein thrombosis.  On this admission,
found to have acutely increasing bilirubin.  AFP significantly
increased to 23,868 from 14,066 on [**2158-9-25**].  Obtained CT abdomen
w/ contrast which showed increased size of hepatoma and increase
in size and number of pulmonary mets, as well as bilateral PEs.
 There was no biliary dilatation to suggest obstruction, but
increased infiltration of the tumor may be causing some
intrahepatic cholestasis.  These findings were shared with the
patient and his family and informed them of how this may affect
his prognosis.  Liver service was consulted, but given the
progression of his disease there was nothing further they could
offer.  Gave lasix/aldactone and started lactulose for
asterixis.  Performed paracentesis x2 for symptomatic relief w/
removal of 4.5L w/ 1st tap.  No additional labs were drawn as pt
had difficult access, and there was nothing further to be gained
by following his liver function tests.  Pt decided to be DNR/DNI
w/ transition to [**Date Range **] care.
.
3) PE - CT suggested bilateral subsegmental and segmental PE
which is new.  However, because of recent hematemesis, did not
start anti-coagulation.  His Hct was stable with no further
episodes of bleeding; breathing well on RA.
.
4) IVDU: on methadone. Verified with [**Doctor Last Name 35660**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 60410**]. Last use of heroin was a few months ago.
.
5) Back pain: heating pads. avoid NSAID/APAP.
- if has pain can give oxycodone
.
6) s/p line infection: abx complete, CIS.
.
7) FEN: regular, as tolerated
.
8) PPx: PPI [**Hospital1 **], pneumoboots, no heparin given bleed, head of
bed at 30 degrees for aspiration ppx
.
9) Dispo:  home w/ [**Hospital1 **] care
.
10) Code: DNR/DNI - sister [**Name (NI) 6818**] [**Name (NI) 60411**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 60412**]
