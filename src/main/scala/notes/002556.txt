skin is mostly unremarkable with multiple healed scars
throughout his body.  HEENT examination revealed extraocular
movements are intact.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to
light.  Oropharynx is benign.  His neck is supple, full range of
motion without any JVD.  His lungs are clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Cardiac examination revealed regular rate and
rhythm with a soft murmur of mitral regurgitation.  His abdomen
is soft, nontender, and nondistended with positive bowel sounds.
Extremities are warm and well perfused with no edema.
Neurologically, he is grossly intact, alert, and oriented x3,

Pertinent Results:
[**2161-4-20**] Echo: 1. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. 2. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed (LVEF= 35-40 %)with hypokinesia of the mid
and apical portions of the inferior, inferolateral and
inferoseptal walls. There is moderate global RV free wall
hypokinesis. 3. The ascending, transverse and descending
thoracic aorta are normal in diameter. There are simple atheroma
in the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta. 4. There are
three aortic valve leaflets. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no aortic stenosis. 5. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate/severe mitral valve prolapse
of the A2 and A3 scallops. The P2 portion is mildly restricted
in movement. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve annulus measures 3.7 cms with the anterior leaftlet
measuring 3.47 cm and the posterior leaflet measuring 1.35 cm.
The Csept distance is 3.57 cm. 6. There is no pericardial
effusion. 7. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results
during the procedure on [**2161-4-20**] at 820 am. POSTBYPASS: 1. The
patient is on phenylephrine, epinephrine, milrinone infusions
and AV paced. 2. RV function is improved compared to the
prebypass study. 3. LV function is worse than prebypass, now
with EF of 30%. Inferior, inferoseptal, and inferolateral walls
are akinetic. 4. An annuloplasty ring is noted in the mitral
postion. It appears well seated. There is trivial mitral
regurgitation. Peak gradient is 6 mm Hg and the mean gradient is
3 mmHg across the mitral valve. 5. Aortic contour is smooth
after decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was a same day admit and on [**4-20**] he was brought to
the operating room where he underwent a mitral valve repair.
Please see operative report for surgical details. Following

wires and chest tubes were removed per Cardiac surgery protocol.
CXR without pneumothorax. Patient transferred from the ICU to
the floor. Patient experienced post op afib and was started on
Amiodarone and betablockade was increased and converted back to
sinus rhythm.
Patient was evaluated by physical therapy and cleared for d/c to
home.
