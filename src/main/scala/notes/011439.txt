INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA. Dilated LA. No spontaneous echo
contrast or
thrombus in the LA/LAA or the RA/RAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Left-to-right
shunt across
the interatrial septum at rest. Small secundum ASD.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thicknesses and cavity size. Low
normal LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta
diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. Focal calcifications in
aortic arch.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Abnormal aortic
valve.
Moderate-sized vegetation on aortic valve. No aortic valve
abscess. Mild AS
(AoVA 1.2-1.9cm2). Severe (4+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate
to severe (3+)
MR. Eccentric MR jet.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the

anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. The patient appears
to be in sinus
the patient.

Conclusions:
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is elongated and dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the
body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at
rest suggestive
of a small secundum atrial septal defect.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall global
left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).

Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.

There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The
aortic valve is abnormal with a perforated left coronary
leaflet. There is a
moderate-sized vegetation on the aortic valve c/w with previous
diagnosis of
vegetation.. No aortic root abscess is seen. There is mild
aortic valve
stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation is
seen with
leaflet perforation as etiology.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet is eccentric
c/w with
etiology ofposterior leaflet retraction.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Post_bypass:
Normal right ventricular systolic function. Patient is on
milrinone and
levophed infusions.
There is a bioprosthesis sitting in the aortic position. It is
well seated and
functioning well. There is a trace central aortic
insuffriciency.
There is prosthesis seen in the native mitral position and is
stable c/w with
mitral ring which was placed. There is no residual mitral
regurgitation.
Aortic contour is intact.

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: evaluate effusion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
62 year old woman with s/p AVR
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate effusion
PA AND LATERAL CHEST [**2106-5-18**] AT 0837 HOURS.

HISTORY: Status post aortic valve replacement.

COMPARISON: Multiple priors, the most recent dated [**2106-5-14**].

FINDINGS: Lung volumes have mildly improved with no
consolidation or superimposed edema evident. There are small
bilateral pleural effusions left greater than right. Left
basilar atelectasis is evident in the retrocardiac left lower
lobe. Evidence of prior median sternotomy and both aortic and
mitral valve replacements are noted. The visualized osseous
structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Small bilateral pleural effusions left greater than
right with left basilar atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**5-10**] and pre-op workup with repeat MRI completed. ID
re-consulted and then underwent AVR/MV repair/PFO closure with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**5-12**]. Transferred to the CSRU in stable condition
on levophed, epinephrine, milrinone, and propofol drips.
Extubated that evening and transferred to the floor on POD #2 to
begin increasing her activity level. Gentle diuresis continued
and she made good progress. IV antibiotics continued via PICC
line. Cleared for discharge to home with services on POD #6. Pt.
