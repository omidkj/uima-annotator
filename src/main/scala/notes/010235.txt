PERTINENT STUDIES
[**10-20**] CT HEAD
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage, edema, mass
effect, or
recent infarction. The ventricles and sulci are normal in size
and
appearance. No concerning osseous lesion or fracture is seen.
There are
multiple air-fluid levels throughout the visualized paranasal
sinus, commonly seen with intubation. The mastoid air cells are
clear.
IMPRESSION: No CT evidence of acute intracranial process.
.
[**10-20**] CT Spine
FINDINGS: No acute fracture or malalignment is seen. The
atlantoaxial and
atlanto-occipital articulations are preserved. The prevertebral
soft tissues are within normal limits. The patient is intubated
and a nasogastric tube is noted in the esophagus. Air-fluid
level in the right maxillary sinus is compatible with
intubation. The mastoid air cells are clear. Within the
visualized portions of the lung apices, opacities of the right
lung are partially imaged, better seen on radiograph of the same
date.
IMPRESSION: No acute fracture or malalignment.
.
[**10-20**] CXR portable
IMPRESSION:
1. Diffuse opacification of the right lung, and to a lesser
extent within the left perihilar region. Findings may represent
multifocal pneumonia,
aspiration, or possibly hemorrhage.
2. Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tubes in standard
positions.
.
[**10-23**] ECHO
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
