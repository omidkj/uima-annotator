Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2751**]
Chief Complaint:
A.Fib RVR, hemodynamically unstable s/p mediastinoscopy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
mediastinoscopy

History of Present Illness:
62 year old female with history of HTN, CAD s/p DES to LCx/LAD
in [**10/2177**], severe PAH, biventricular diastolic dysfunction, and
mediastinal lymphadenopathy electively admitted to thoracic
surgery s/p mediastinoscopy yesterday with persistent hypoxia
and lactic acidosis.
.
Right and left heart cath in [**10/2177**] showed pulmonary artery
pressures of 67/23/46. Nuclear stress last month showed
uninterpretable ECG for ischemia due to abnormal baseline, with
appropriate hemodynamic response to Persantine. No anginal type
symptoms, a fixed mild decrease in septal activity may be
related to LBBB. Normal LV wall motion and systolic function,
with hyperdynamic LVEF of 85%.
.
During this admission, she was noted to have an oxygen
saturation of 90% in pre-op and was hypotensive during the case,
to the 60s systolic, and required ephedrine and neo to maintain
her BPs. Bronchoscopy showed clear secretions. In the PACU she
was extubated and continued to have low O2 sats 88-90% on 3
liters N/C, although both the patient and her daughter explained
that this is her baseline and she does not use home oxygen. She
reported taking her home lisinopril and atenolol the morning of
the mediastinoscopy. She did not take her Lasix. She was also
unable to void in the PACU and when a foley was placed she
urinated 200cc. Her urine output in PACU reached a low of 17
cc/hour but averaged 20-30 cc/hour overnight. She had an initial
VBG that was 7.29/35/26 and a lactate of 5. On repeat VBG four
hours later it was 7.30/34/43 and lactate was 5 again. She was
transferred to Medicine for management of her lactic acidosis
and hypoxia.

MICRO:

IMAGING:
[**2178-9-3**] CXR - Lungs are well expanded. Compared to prior
radiograph, there is decrease in interstitial markings, upper
vascular redistribution and hilar engorgement. A right lower
lung radiopacity likely due to aspiration
pneumonia persists. Small bilateral pleural effusions are
present, no evidence of pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contour
is stable with a dilated pulmonary artery, unchanged from prior
radiograph
.
[**2178-9-7**] RUQ ultrasound
1. Mild intra-abdominal ascites.
2. Gallbladder wall thickening and pericholecystic fluid, likely
secondary to 3rd spacing and underlying cardiac disease. No
cholelithiasis or evidence of acute cholecystitis.
3. Limited evaluation of the pancreas and abdominal aorta due to
overlying
bowel gas.

PATHOLOGY
[**2178-9-3**] LN biopsy: FRAGMENT OF LYMPH NODE WITH REACTIVE FEATURES,
INCLUDING FOLLICULAR HYPERPLASIA, FOCAL PARACORTICAL HYPERPLASIA
AND SINUSOIDAL HISTIOCYTOSIS. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF LYMPHOMA.
Non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic
immunophenotypic features of involvement by non-Hodgkin B-cell
lymphoma are not seen in specimen. Correlation with clinical
findings and morphology is recommended. Flow cytometry
immunophenotyping may not detect all lymphomas as due to
topography, sampling or artifacts of sample preparation.

Brief Hospital Course:
62 yo F with hx of severe of pulm HTN and CAD s/p DES to Lcx/LAD
in [**10/2177**] prior CVA s/p b/l CEA's, PVD who was transferred to
medicine after mediastinoscopy complicated by hypotension,
hypoxia, and lactic acidosis in the immediate post op period. In
brief, she came to medicine service on [**2178-9-4**] with lactic
acidosis and hypoxia, and was transferred to the medical ICU
early on [**2178-9-5**] after triggering for hypoxia and atrial flutter
with rates to 170s. On review, she had experienced 1-2 months of
progressive shortness of breath, > 20 lb weight gain, and
worsening lower extremity edema, likely representing worsening
congestive heart failure.

# Hypotension:
She was hypotensive during the mediastinoscopy, to the 60s
systolic, and required ephedrine and neo to maintain her BPs.
She reported taking her home lisinopril and atenolol the morning
of the mediastinoscopy. Her pressures recovered in the PACU.
Home beta blocker and lisinopril were held. Echo ([**2178-9-4**]) showed
signs of severe pulmonary artery hypertension with right
ventricle dilatation and moderate global free wall hypokinesis,
and septal motion consistent with increased RV pressures. On
exam, she had evidence of RHF including elevated JVP, pulsatile
liver, and bilat lower extremity edema. Thus, it was assumed
that intraoperatively she had poor forward flow from RV overload
and impairment of LV filling. Because of concern for
intraoperative MI, troponins were sent, which were initially
elevated and peaked to 0.67, but trended down, consistent with
demand ischemia. On [**2178-9-5**], she went into atrial flutter with
rates to the 170s and was transferred to the unit (see below).
Her rate was initially controlled on esmolal drip, with
subsequent hypotension to MAPS 50s with HR 100s. A RIJ was
placed and she was supported on neosyn. The esmolal drip was
stopped and she was loaded with amiodarone; her pressures
quickly responded and she was taken off of neosyn after a few
hours. Her SBPs have since been greater than 90.

# Lactic acidosis:
Post-op, VBG was 7.29/35/26 and on repeat 4 hrs later
7.30/34/43. Lactate was 5, attributed to hypotension and poor
forward flow during the procedure, with potential contribution
of Metformin. Her home metformin was held and she was started on
Lasix 20 mg IV bid. The metabolic acidosis quickly improved over
the post op day 1.

# Hypoxia:
In retrospect, was likely multifactorial with components of
pneumonia, pulm
