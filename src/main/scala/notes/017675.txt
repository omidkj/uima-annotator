CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 86 year old female
who has had recent multiple admissions to the hospital for
shortness of breath who was admitted on [**2140-1-16**], from
rehabilitation with listlessness and a blood pressure in the
low range of 100/60.  She also had an oxygen saturation of
88% on two liters.  The patient's primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) 3357**], assessed the patient and she was sent to [**Hospital1 346**] Emergency Department for evaluation
for congestive heart failure.  She had some wheezes on
examination and was given Albuterol and Ipratropium
nebulizers and Lasix 40 mg intravenously.  Her blood pressure
on admission to Emergency Department triage was approximately
80/60 which was lowered to 74/23.  Dopamine drip was started
for blood pressure support and the patient was admitted to
Intensive Care Unit and given two liters of normal saline.
She was noted to be 88% in room air and got antibiotics for
possible pneumonia.  She was placed on an eight liter face
mask and had an arterial blood gases of 7.30 with a pCO2 of
47 and a pO2 of 58.  She was in the Intensive Care Unit for
three hospital days and was transferred out to the Medicine
floor after it was determined that she was likely dehydrated
and went into renal failure due to dehydration and possible
over diuresis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Multi-infarct dementia.
2.  Coronary artery disease, status post pacer for complete
heart block.
3.  Diabetes mellitus.
4.  Depression.
5.  Congestive heart failure.
6.  Status post radial fracture.
7.  Bilateral knee arthroplasty.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Colace.
2.  Vitamin D.
3.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. once daily.
4.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. once daily.
5.  Lopressor 50 mg p.o. twice a day.
6.  Imdur 90 mg p.o. once daily.
7.  Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. once daily.
8.  Ultram 50 mg p.o four times a day.
9.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. once daily.
10. Lasix 20 mg p.o. once daily.
11. Zyprexa 10 mg p.o. twice a day.
12. Effexor 75 mg p.o. once daily.
13. Effexor XR 150 mg p.o. q.h.s.
14. Neurontin 300 mg p.o. twice a day.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon presentation to Medicine,
temperature is 96.9, blood pressure 103/63, heart rate 86,
respiratory rate 27, oxygen saturation 96% in room air.  In
general, she is sitting in bed, bright and alert.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat examination reveals moist mucous
membranes with a clear oropharynx.  The lungs show slight
crackles at the left base and no audible wheezes.
Cardiovascular reveals a regular rate and rhythm with distant
heart sounds.  Abdomen is soft, obese, nontender,
nondistended with positive bowel sounds.  Extremities show no
pedal edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  Upon presentation to Medicine, white blood
cell count was 9.1, hematocrit 35.6, platelet count 326,000.
Creatinine 1.1, blood urea nitrogen 27, potassium 5.2,
glucose 171.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Dyspnea, hypoxia - She was much improved after getting
fluids in the Intensive Care Unit without any diuresis.  It
was determined by chest x-ray that she was dry and had
possible infiltrate and was treated with antibiotics,
Levofloxacin, Flagyl, Vancomycin.  The Vancomycin was
discontinued, however, she remained on Levofloxacin and
Flagyl for concern of aspiration pneumonia.  Intensive Care
Unit team also felt that the patient had reactive airways and
started steroids p.o. along with continuing nebulizers.  She
had a negative infectious workup to date. Of note, she has
not had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or
asthma in the past.  Upon transfer to the Medicine floor, she
was found the next day to be in significant respiratory
distress requiring respirator care and nebulizers.  She
seemed to do better after this.  Chest x-ray was obtained and
showed progressive heart failure over the past four days in
the hospital.  She was given 20 mg intravenous Lasix and had
good urine output and was saturating well.  She then became
very lethargic and was given intravenous fluids as it is
noted in the past the patient responds very well to
intravenous fluids, becoming more alert and aware of her
environment.  Also of note, the patient had a transthoracic
echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 55% and
E:A ratio of 0.82, however, this did not meet criteria for
diastolic dysfunction.  She also had a very poor quality
echocardiogram which limited our evaluation of whether she
has systolic dysfunction in addition to diastolic
dysfunction. A heart failure consultation was obtained by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] and it was determined that it was difficult to tell
whether she had pure diastolic dysfunction.  It was
recommended that the patient start Diltiazem for rate control
without using beta blockers to exacerbate any potential
bronchospasm.  The patient did well on Diltiazem and was
continued only on Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. once daily. Her
previous Imdur and Lopressor were discontinued.

2.  Hypotension - It was unclear whether the patient was
overmedicated with blood pressure medications upon admission
or was over-diuresed.  Her previous hospital stay had
actually cut down her previous Lasix dose so it is unclear
whether this had anything to do with her hypotension.
However, while in house, the patient's blood pressure
remained well without Lopressor or Lisinopril at 20 mg.  At
the reduced Lisinopril dose as well as the Diltiazem, the
patient did well.  She was restarted on her Lasix 20 mg p.o.
Once daily.

6.  Status post radial fracture.
7.  Bilateral knee arthroplasty.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
