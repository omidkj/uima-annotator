Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**]
Chief Complaint:
Status post arrest at home.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
- ICD placement [**2105-5-22**].
- Placement and removal of right internal jugular central venous
line.
- Placement and removal for right-sided PICC line through
interventional radiology.
- Placement and removal of left radial arterial line.


History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 80 year old man with history of coronary artery
disease status post CABG and stent, systolic congestive heart
failure, and stage 4 chronic renal insufficiency who was
admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit after presenting to
the emergency room after cardiac arrest.  He was at home today
when his wife heard a loud thump, and he was found down
unresponsive in the kitchen with the refrigerator door open with
his Procrit in his hand.  The wife [**Name (NI) 653**] 911 and then called
her daughter who lives close by. His daughter is CPR certified
and arrived within 5-10 minutes and started CPR. EMS arrived a
few minutes later. The patient was pulseless, and leads attached
demonstrated monomorphic VT. He was cardio-verted with a shock,
with return of a pulse. He was intubated in the field and
lidocaine drip was started. A systolic blood pressure in the
70's was recorded.
.
In the emergency room he was initiated on the Arctic Sun cooling
protocol. A right internal juglar central venous line was
placed. He was hypotensive with a systolic pressure in the 70's,
and dopamine 5mcg/kg/min was started. He was reportedly
minimally responsive with some movement at that time.

EKG/TELEMETRY ON ADMISSION: atrial fibrillation. Telemetry strip
from EMS shows VT, post shock there is a period of asystole,
followed by a slow wide complex rhythym (approximately 40),
followed by an accelerated wide complex rhythym, which then
converts to Atrial Fibrillation with a narrow QRS complex.
.
[**2105-5-12**]: Transthoracic Echo:
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis
(LVEF = 30-40 %). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with depressed free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent
with minimal aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to
moderate ([**12-3**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2105-1-13**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is
slightly lower.
.
[**2105-5-14**]: CT C-Spine without contrast
IMPRESSION:
Moderately severe DJD. No definite fracture. If there is concern
for
ligamentous injury, MRI is recommended. There is a 6.6-mm
possible nodule in the left lung apex which is only seen on one
image. Recommend further evaluation with CT of the chest.
.
[**2105-5-16**] Renal Ultrasound:
RENAL SON[**Name (NI) **]: The right kidney measures 10.4 cm. The left
kidney measures 11.0 cm. No stone, hydronephrosis, or mass is
identified. There is a simple cyst within the lower pole of the
left kidney measuring approximately 1.5 cm, not significantly
changed from [**2105-1-15**].
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis
.
[**2105-5-21**] Chest X-Ray
IMPRESSION:
1. Cardiomegaly and upper zone redistribution but no overt
pulmonary edema.
2. Apparent elevation of right hemidiaphragm, probably due to
subpulmonic
right effusion, but right lateral decubitus chest radiograph may
be considered for confirmation if warranted clinically.
Persistent small left effusion.
.
[**2105-5-23**] CHEST PA AND LATERAL
Pacer/ICD device has been placed with leads terminating in the
right atrium and right ventricle, and no pneumothorax. Right
PICC line has been withdrawn, and now terminates in the superior
right axillary region lateral to the right second rib. Cardiac
silhouette remains enlarged, and a moderate-sized right pleural
effusion appears slightly larger. Small left pleural effusion is
unchanged. Upper zone vascular redistribution is present, but no
overt pulmonary edema is evident. Atelectatic changes persist in
the right mid and both lower lung zones.
