Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**]
Chief Complaint:
Recurrent SOB and Cough.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1) Intubation and Mechanical Ventilation.
2) Cardiac Catheterization.


History of Present Illness:
80M recently emigrated from [**Country 3992**] admitted here [**Date range (1) 39348**] for
dyspnea, productive cough, and profuse sweats. Dx with
multi-lobar community acquired PNA, treated with levofloxacin.
Pt returned 3 days after discharge on [**3-7**] with [**Month/Year (2) 9140**]
productive cough, SOB, anorexia. No fever/chills/chest pain. Per
son, patient also with increased frequency of urination, but no
dysuria, hematuria. No sick contacts.

Patient's recent hospitalization from [**Date range (1) 39348**] complicated by
mild CHF, Zoster on his right buttock, and acute gout of the
right knee. He was also placed in isolation and had 3 successive
negative smears for AFB due to concern for MTB infection (CT
showed apical scarring and evidence of granulomatous disease).
AFB cultures were still pending at the time of his discharge,
but his PPD had been negative.

ED Course: Upon admission on [**3-7**] patient was found to be
signficantly hypoxic (80% RA) and was intubated in the ED. He
was also hyponatremic to 119 which was thought [**1-29**] pulmonary
SIADH from infection, and was corrected with 3% hypertonic
saline.

Past Medical History:
Possible Prior Pulm TB, Severe AI, HTN, CHF (EF 35-40% in
[**11-30**]), "Other Heart Condition" (Dx in [**Country 3992**] and cured with
Chinese Herbs), "Stomach Problem", Gout, Asbestosis, Recent
Hyponatremia (Likely Via Pulm SIADH).

intubated)
GEN - intubated and sedated
HEENT - Pupils 2mm bilat, minimally reactive. Frothy secretions
at mouth., ETT in place
RESP - Coarse breath sounds at left/mid lung.  Decreased breath
sounds at base.  No wheezes.
CV - RR. III/VI diastolic murmur at USB.
ABD - Soft/NT/ND. bowel sounds present
EXT - 1+ pitting edema LE bilaterally, hands/feet are cool/dry
skin- patches of redness (from "coining") over shoulders and

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 59697**], who recently returned from [**Country 3992**] and had a recent
[**Hospital1 18**] admission (treated for CAP) was initially readmitted this
hospital with impending respiratory failure and multifocal
pneumonia by chest imaging. He was intubated, started on
mechanical ventilation (MV), and admitted to the ICU. He was
again treated for infectious pneumonia with broad-spectrum
antibiotics and was eventually weaned off mechanical ventilation
and then did well on room air.

1) Hosp-Acquired PNA (HAP): As above, the patient had a
pneumonia (and required mechanical ventilation on admission)
which was treated as HAP as above: Vancomycin and Zosyn. He had
four successive negative AFB sputum samples on his previous
admission, but the time of this admission, the cultures had
grown out AFB (which were eventually isolated as MAC, and not
TB). Thus, given his chronic lung disease, the MAC was believed
to be only a colonizer of his lungs and not contributing the
acute process. Nevertheless, before AFB organism identification
returned, he was empirically treated for tuberculosis with
mutli-drug therapy. Although preliminary lab data indicated MAC,
the final results would not return for several months. Thus, he
was discharged on multi-drug therapy for empiric TB treatment.
Of note, given his recent travel to [**Country 3992**] and the new history
of direct chicken exposure, there was an initial concern for
Avian influenza. After speaking with the ID team, this concern
was later put to rest. Upon extubation, the patient required
low-level supplemental oxygen and eventually was stable on room
air.

2. Aortic Regurgitation/HTN: The patient had known severe AR and
a depressed EF. Per his family, he did not want to know the
extent of his heart disease, despite the possibilty of
benefiting form AVR. He was continued on afterload reduction and
BP control with Lisinopril, Amlodipine, and Metoprolol. Of note,
the patient had new anterior ST elevations while in the ICU, on
MV. He was urgently taken to for cardiac catherization and had
multiple sets of negative cardia enzymes. Cardiac cath showed
clean coronary arteries and confirmed his noted heart findings
(re: AI) as on ECHO.

5. Anemia: His HCT was stable in the low 30's. He had a few
episodes of heme-positive stool during this hospital stay and
reported chronic loose stools. Outpatient colonoscopy was
recommended. The etiology of the anemia was likely acombination
of iron deficiecny (iron was 12), inflammatory anemia and
possible chronic low-level hemolysis given severe AI. He was
started on Folic Acid empirically.

6. Hyponatremia: The patient had low serum sodium on his
previous admission, which was consistent with pulmonary SIADH.
Again, on admission he had low serum sodium (119). This improved
with fluid restriction and the treatment of his pneumonia.
