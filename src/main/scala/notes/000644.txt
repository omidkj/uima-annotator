Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Normal LV wall thickness. Moderately
dilated LV cavity. Normal regional LV systolic function. Overall
normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. No atheroma in ascending aorta. Normal
descending aorta diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Partial mitral leaflet flail. Torn mitral chordae.
Severe (4+) MR. [**Name13 (STitle) 15110**] to the eccentric MR jet, its severity may be
underestimated (Coanda effect).

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient.
Conclusions
Prebypass

The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Instirinsic function is depressed given the degree
of regurgitation. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. There is
partial mitral anteriorleaflet flail. (A3) Torn mitral chordae
are present. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to
the eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be
significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was
notified in person of the results on [**2143-3-19**] at 830am.

Postbypass

Patient is in sinus rhythm amd receiving an infusion of
phenylephrine. LVEF is 45%. Globally reduced LVEF. RV function
is normal.

Annuloplasty ring seen in the mitral position. Appears well
seated. Trivial MR and there is NO [**Male First Name (un) **]. Peak gradient across the
mitral valve is 7mm Hg.

Aorta intact post decannulation.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
operating room on [**2143-3-19**] for surgical intervention of his mitral
regurgitation. He underwent mitral valve repair, including a
32mm annuloplasty ring and reimplantation of ruptured chordae.
See operative note for further details.  Overall the patient
tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in critical but stable condition for
further monitoring and recovery.  By POD 1 the patient was
extubated and vasoactive drips were weaned.  He was
neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable and transferred
to the telemetry floor on POD 1.  His chest tubes were
discontinued on POD 2 without complication.  He was progressing
toward discharge but developed a fever 102 and his WBC rose from
4,000 to 11,000. Infectious disease was consulted and he was
placed on broad spectrum IV antibiotics.  His fevers abated and
WBC decreased to 6,000 on this regimen.  The atelectasis vs
pneumonia on his chest radiograph improved. Although his sputum
was not final by the time of discharge, it preliminarily
revealed normal flora.  Blood and urine cultures were negative.
His hematocrit was 26.9 at the time of discharge and he was
placed on iron.  He was discharged on post-operative day 9 to
home with a peripherally inserted central catheter and IV
antibiotics to be administered by a visiting nurses association.
 These antibiotics will continue until [**2143-4-2**] and surveillance
labs will be followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 438**] of Infectious
Disease.  He was encouraged to make follow-up appointments as
listed in the discharge summary.
