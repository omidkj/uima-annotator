##
CT orbit [**12-15**]
IMPRESSION: Multiple fractures as described above including
right skull base fracture, temporal bone fracture extending to
the nasopharynx.
ADDENDUM: There may be a fracture fragment extending to the
right jugular foramen.
##
XR extremity and pelvis [**12-15**]
IMPRESSION: 1. Left lateral tibial plateau fracture.
2. Fracture proximal left tibia.
3. Fracture left superior and inferior pubic rami.
##
CT Cspine [**12-15**]
IMPRESSION: No visualized cervical spine fractures. Small bubble
of air adjacent to the anterior arch of C1 and in the right
parapharyngeal space, likely related to adjacent injuries,
though there is no clear explaination of these findings on the
given images. Motion at C4-5, if this is an area of concern a
repeat scan could be performed.
##
CT head [**12-15**]
IMPRESSION: Left subdural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and
right epidural hemorrhage. Brain edema and mass effect on
basilar cisterns. Occipital, parietal, and temporal bone
fractures on the right with fluid/hemorrhage in the right
mastoid and other sinuses. Pneumocephalus. These findings were
discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 955**] at 10 PM.
Fracture extends across the jugular foramen and near the right
carotid canal, as well ad through the skull base, and
angiography may be warranted to evaluated for vascular injury.
##
CT Cerbral Angio [**12-16**]
IMPRESSION: Traumatic dissection of the right internal carotid
artery at the carotid bifurcation with a small raised intimal
flap compromising approximately 40 to 50% of the cross-sectional
luminal area. These findings were discussed with the trauma
team. Recommendations were made for repeat imaging with CT
angiography or cerebral angiography.
##
IVC filter [**12-17**]
IMPRESSION
1. Normal-appearing IVC without evidence of intraluminal
thrombus or extrinsic compression.
2. Uncomplicated placement of an IVC retrievable filter into the
infrarenal position. This filter can be retrieved at any time
when the patient is no longer at risk for possible pulmonary
embolism.
##
EEG [**12-18**]
IMPRESSION: This is an abormal portable EEG due to the presence
of a
low-voltage background rhythm, somewhat more so over the left
hemisphere. These findings suggest diffuse subcortical
dysfunction
consistent with a severe encephalopathy, and may be secondary to
a
medication affect from pentobarbital. The voltage asymmetry
suggests
the left hemisphere is more affected and could suggest a
structural
abnormality such as an increased recording distance as can be
seen with
extra axial blood or scalp edema. No epileptiform abnormalities
were
seen.
##
MRI brain MRA head [**12-24**]
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute infarct. Left frontal and
temporal contusions. Thin rim of left-sided subdural collection.
Right-sided frontoparietal fracture with associated soft tissue
changes. Extensive soft tissue changes in the mastoid air cells
and in the paranasal sinuses including blood products. The basal
cisterns are patent without evidence of herniation.
IMPRESSION: Flow signal is seen in the arteries of anterior and
posterior circulation without evidence of occlusion.
##
Repeat CT head [**12-26**]
IMPRESSION:
1) Evolving left frontal contusion with interval decrease in
subarachnoid blood.
2) Collapse, slit-like left lateral ventricle.
3) Increased fluid in the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air
cells.
##
OR Tib/fib [**12-28**]
CLINICAL HISTORY: Tibial plateau fracture. Three fluoroscopic
images from the operating room are provided during ORIF of a
tibial plateau fracture, side nonspecified. Radiologist was not
present. Lateral buttress plate with screws is present. There is
also a fibular metaphysis fracture.
##
CT head/CTA [**12-29**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No hydrocephalus. Interval re-expansion of the left lateral
ventricle status post removal of the ventricular drainage
catheter on that side.
2. Stable appearance of complex right temporal bone fracture.
3. No significant change in size and appearance of the
previously seen dissection at the origin of the right internal
carotid artery in the neck.
##
RUQ US [**12-29**]
IMPRESSION:
1) Normal appearing gallbladder; no evidence of cholecystitis.
2) Simple cyst in the mid/upper pole of the right kidney.
3) Otherwise normal abdominal ultrasound

Brief Hospital Course:
35yo F pedestrian struck by MVA traveling @ unknown speed,
interactive at first then decreasing mental status. R ear, nose
bleeding. Taken to [**Hospital 3597**] hosp, intubated, FFP for INR 1.4, tx to
[**Hospital1 18**]. Found to have R EDH, L SDH, SAH, pneumocephalus, R
temporal fracture, occipital fracture, and skull base fracture.
Went to OR with Neurosurgery from ED for emergent craniotomy and
epidural evacuation after which she was admitted to TSICU for
neuro checks and further management. Further imaging
demonstrated a R ICA intimal dissection, a L superior and
inferior pubic rami fractures and a L tibial plateau fracture.
##
NEURO: Over HD [**1-11**] pt remained with poor neurologic status, then
began to recover some baseline function of right sided extremity
movement, and eye opening.  Brain scan HD 7 demonstrated no
evidence of brain death.  Extubated on HD 12 which she tolerated
well, and transfered to floor on HD 14.  Repeat CTA head/neck
demonstrated stable intimal dissection of [**Country **] therefore
neurosurgery recommended aspirin 325QD and followup for repeat
imaging 1 month which also demonstrated stable flap wi
