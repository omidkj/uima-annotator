History of Present Illness:
78-year-old woman transferred by medical air ambulance from the
[**Hospital6 8283**]. The patient had fallen from a height
at approximately 2 p.m. on the day of admission, and brought to
the [**Hospital6 8283**] after an apparent loss of
consciousness. There she was thought to have a fracture of
the C2 cervical body. She appeared to be neurologically intact,
although, her mental status appeared to be depressed. A torso CT
scan performed there was otherwise unremarkable. She had a
hematocrit of 40 and apparent stable vital signs until the
decision was made to transfer her here. With the arrival of the
helicopter, her blood pressure apparently fell to the 80s and
she was started on a dopamine infusion. She was intubated
electively prior to transfer.

Pertinent Results:
CT head ([**2179-6-9**]): IMPRESSION:
1.  Left frontal/parietal subdural hematoma.  Subdural hematoma
within the
falx cerebri and layering over the tentorium.
2.  Small left parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
3.  Right frontal/parietal subgaleal hematoma.  Left parietal
subgaleal
hematoma.
4.  Paranasal sinus mucosal thickening and air-fluid levels
within the
maxillary sinuses.
.
CT C-spine ([**2179-6-9**]): IMPRESSION:
1.  Type 3 dens fracture with comminuted fracture involving the
anterior arch and left lateral mass of C2.
2.  Minimal widening of the left C2/3 inferior facet joint.
Given
irregularity of articular surfaces, chronic degenerative changes
favored
however given trauma mechanism, difficult to exclude injury.
.
CT chest/abd/pelvis: IMPRESSION:
1.  Mild bibasilar consolidation/aspiration.
2.  L3 superior endplate deformity age indeterminate.
3.  Chronic bilateral pars defects at L5 resulting in grade II
anterolisthesis of L5 on S1.
4.  Abnormal articulation of the left sternoclavicular joint.
Clinical
correlation is requested.
5.  Three sub 5 mm pulmonary nodules.  Follow-up CT can be
performed in one year if there is a history of smoking.
.
Plain x-ray of knee ([**2179-6-9**]): IMPRESSION:
1. No acute fracture.
2. Prepatellar soft tissue swelling.
3. Hardware in the right proximal tibia, with irregularity along
the lateral tibial plateau suggestive of prior injury.
.
MRA head and neck ([**2179-6-10**]): IMPRESSION:  Normal MRA of the head
and neck
.
MRI head ([**2179-6-10**]): IMPRESSION:
1.  Persistent subdural hematoma along the falx cerebri, left

Brief Hospital Course:
78-year-old woman transferred by medical air ambulance from
the [**Hospital6 8283**]. The patient had fallen from a
height earlier in the afternoon, at approximately 2 p.m., and
brought to the [**Hospital6 8283**] after an apparent loss

of consciousness. There she was thought to have a fracture of
the C2 cervical body. She appeared to be neurologically intact,
although, her mental status appeared to be depressed. A torso CT

scan performed there was otherwise unremarkable. She had a
hematocrit of 40 and apparent stable vital signs until the
decision was made to transfer her here. With the arrival of the
helicopter, her blood pressure apparently fell to the 80s and
she
was started on a dopamine infusion. She was intubated electively

prior to transfer.

Upon arrival here, the patient was on 5 mcg of dopamine per
kilogram per minute with a heart rate of 130 and a blood
pressure
of approximately 120 systolic. Her pupils were dilated,
presumably secondary to her intubation medications. She appeared

to ventilate easily. She had an ecchymosis overlying her right
knee but the knee itself appeared to be stable. She had no other

obvious external signs of trauma. The chest was clear with
bilateral breath sounds. Her cardiovascular examination was
unremarkable. Her neck veins were not distended. The abdomen
was soft and without masses or tenderness. She had no obvious
long bone fractures. Her pelvis was stable. Her peripheral
pulses were full.

We obtained a new CT scan of the head and torso. She appears to
have a left frontal subdural hemorrhage and a type III dens
fracture. No abnormalities were seen in the chest or abdomen.
Plain films of the right knee showed no obvious abnormality.

The dopamine was weaned off after approximately one hour. Her
blood pressure remained approximately 120 systolic and her heart
rate fell to the 80s. A
