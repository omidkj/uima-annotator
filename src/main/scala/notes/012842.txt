HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 36950**] is referred
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  The patient is a 74-year-old gentleman
who had an outpatient cardiac catheterization for anginal
symptoms and a positive stress test.  The patient's history
is such that he complained of chest pain below the chin,
while he was on his roof blowing leaves.  He was admitted to
[**Hospital3 3583**] on [**2110-11-25**] for rule out MI protocol.  The
CKs subsequently were negative, but the troponin I peaked at
.18.  He ultimately got a stress test and had 3.2 minutes of
the [**Doctor First Name **] protocol stopped secondary to his shortness of
breath, claudications in the bilateral lower extremities.
the EKG on the [**Doctor First Name **] Protocol showed inferolateral changes.
As a consequence, he was referred for cardiac catheterization
here at the [**Hospital1 69**] on
[**2110-12-2**].  The patient's previous cardiac workups, included
echocardiogram on [**2110-4-21**], which at that time showed
mild-to-moderate aortic sclerosis, no significant aortic
stenosis, 1+ MR, 2+ TR, and 1+ PR.  He had evidence of
[**Hospital1 **]-atrial enlargement at that time and EF measured at 40% to
45%.  Additionally, the patient had an EKG, which showed
atrial fibrillation at rate of 83.  There were Q waves seen
in leads 3 and AVF.  There were no ST or T changes seen.
Given this profile, the patient was subsequently referred for
cardiac catheterization.

Other medical history:  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which
the patient underwent cardioversion two years ago.  He
suffered from paroxysmal atrial fibrillation times three
years.  He had a history of congestive failure,
hypothyroidism, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, and
inguinal hernia on the left.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  History includes bilateral vein
ligations, hemorrhoid operation, as well as a tonsillectomy
and adenoidectomy.  He had no history of TIA, no history of
stroke, no history of melena or GI bleeding.  Cardiac risk
factor profile is notable for hypertension, 65 to 70 pack
year smoking history, and hyperlipidemia.  He has no history
of diabetes mellitus.  He has had a borderline hypertension.

LABORATORY DATA:  Labs, prior to cardiac catheterization on
[**2110-12-2**] revealed a hematocrit of 39, white count of 7,000,
platelet count of 219,000.  Chemistries were notable for BUN
creatinine of 24 and 1.5.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  History was remarkable for the patient being
recently widowed in [**2110-9-6**] and certainly has events
of clinical depression.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to DRAMAMINE.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Amiodarone 200 mg p.o.q.d.
2.  Levoxyl 75 mcg p.o.q.d.
3.  Nitropaste q 6 hours p.r.n.
4.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o.q.d.
5.  Zestoretic 10/12.5 mg q.a.m.
6.  Lipitor 20 mg p.o.q.d.

On [**2110-12-2**], the patient underwent cardiac catheterization
when he was admitted to the [**Hospital1 188**] which showed an EF  of 55%.  He had mild inferior
hypokinesis.  There is evidence of the left main coronary
artery being long and serpiginous in nature.  There was an
80% proximal right coronary artery lesion and 80% proximal
LAD lesion and serial 40% and 60% stenoses seen in the left
circumflex artery.  Given the patient's significant
three-vessel coronary artery disease and subjective symptoms
of exertional angina increasing in frequency, he was admitted
for unstable angina, cardiac consultation and ultimately for
assessment for elective coronary artery bypass graft.

He was admitted to the C-Med Service and in the first couple
days of his admission, he had the development of chest pain
requiring IV nitroglycerin and heparinization.  Consultation
was carried out to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] of the Cardiothoracic
Surgery Service for an elective CABG, who assessed the
patient as appropriate candidate.  However, given his
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and hypercholesterolemia and
hypothyroidism history, preoperative workup including chest
x-ray was completed, which showed the diffuse reticular
nodular infiltrate, chronic in nature, certainly evidentiary
changes for COPD also seen, but no significant
pneumothoraces, no bullae identified, and no failure seen.

EP consultation was obtained.  Their recommendations
preoperatively were that the patient should be anticoagulated
and have beta blockers and Amiodarone utilized for rate
control.  Heparin was to be continued with Coumadin
postoperatively, particularly given this, since the left
atrial diameter was about 4.9 as previously measured by
echocardiogram in [**2108-4-5**].  Additional preoperative
workup included a bilateral carotid ultrasound, which showed
no significant disease, stenoses less than 40%.  The patient
has never had a history of TIA.  Given the previously
mentioned workup, the patient was brought to the operating
room on [**2110-12-5**], where he underwent a CABG times three
including a LIMA graft to the LAD, right less saphenous vein
graft to the right coronary artery and a right radial artery
graft to the oblique marginal I.  Because of the
electrophysiology consultation obtained two days
preoperatively, it was agreed upon between Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] and
the EP Service that a left atrial cryoablation and Mays
procedure would be carried out, which was also done
intraoperatively.

Postoperatively, the patient was intubated on propofol drip
and Neo-Synephrine for blood pressure support.  He was
brought to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit, where he
remained intubated.  He was transfused one unit of packed red
blood cells, postoperatively for a hematocrit of 25 and low
filling pressures of 10.  The BUN and creatinine were noted
to be 31 and 1.4.  He was being maintained at this time on a
milrinone drip at .5, Neo-Synephrine drip of 3.2,
nitroglycerin drip of .5 for the radial artery graft, as well
as a propofol drip of 10.

The patient was kept in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit.  The
patient was noted, on postoperative day #2, to go in atrial
fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.  This was
controlled using IV Amiodarone a 1 mg per minute.  The
Milrinone drip was at .5 mcg per hour, Neo-Synephrine drip
was at 3.75 mcg per kilo per minute.  The Nitroglycerin drip
was still at 1.5 and the propofol was utilized for sedation.
Ultimately, he was retransfused two packed cells on
postoperatively day #7 for hematocrit of 26.  By
postoperative day #3, the patient's FIO2 was weaned as
tolerated and the chest tubes were removed due to the
patient's poor oxygenation.  He was kept intubated.  He was
given DVT prophylaxis and started on Heparin therapy and
maintained on Amiodarone for the atrial fibrillation issues.
He had no evidence of clinical bleeding at this time.

By postoperative day #4, he was hemodynamically stable.
However, he continued to have a slight respiratory and
metabolic acidosis.  He was started on Lopressor for rate
control.  He was maintained on Amiodarone as well.  He was
switched over from the Nitroglycerin drip to Imdur for his
radial artery graft.  Ultimately, he was transferred one unit
again on postoperative day #4 for hematocrit of 27, with goal
of 30.  Repeat chest x-rays were done during this time.
Because of the patient's inability to wean from the
ventilator, it was seen that he had bilateral fluffy
infiltrates with the reticular nodular infiltrates as well,
which looked like an acute and chronic process.  Certainly,
the patient had elements of obstructive pulmonary disease by
his failure to wean and this made it difficult for him to
progress postoperatively.  As a consequence, SICU
consultation was obtained on postoperative day #6.
Bronchoscopy was carried out, which showed very thick
secretions.  He is a smoker.  He did grow out evidence of a
Hemophilus species, which were ultimately treated with a
two-week course of Levofloxacin.

He was noted to have some low-grade temperatures on
postoperative day #7, where sputum cultures, chest x-ray,
urine cultures, blood cultures, were sent.  White count at
this time was 13.6, hem
