Admission Date:  [**2160-2-19**]     Discharge Date:  [**2160-2-24**]

Date of Birth:   [**2095-10-21**]     Sex:  M

Service:  EP SERVICE

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Syncope.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 64-year-old man with
an extensive cardiac history including coronary artery
disease, status post myocardial infarction times two, status
post multiple interventions, congestive heart failure with an
ejection fraction less than 20%, ventricular tachycardia,
status post AICD placement in [**2157**], who presented to the
Emergency Department after syncopal episodes and AICD firing.
The patient noted three days prior to admission, feeling of
palpitations especially when lying down for bed.  On the day
of admission, the patient became lightheaded a while, bending
down to tie his shoes and felt some palpitations.  He then
felt a shock from his ICD.  He, thereafter, awoke on the
floor.  Over the course of the day, he had three more
episodes, a feeling of palpitations, and lightheadedness
followed by a shock and then losing consciousness.

In the Emergency Department, the patient was observed to have
an irregular wide complex tachycardia consistent with atrial
fibrillation in the setting of his underlying left bundle
branch block.  While in the Emergency Department, he
developed transient regular wide complex tachycardia to
approximately 170 beats per minute.  His ICD fired during
this rhythm and was subsequently degenerated into a
ventricular fibrillation, prompting the ICD to fire again,
recovering the rhythm back to atrial fibrillation.  An
amiodarone load was begun and the patient appeared to
spontaneously convert to sinus rhythm with left bundle branch
block.  The ICD settings were increased while the patient was
in the Emergency Department so that the first shock
administered was increased from 12 to 24 joules.  The patient
was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for continued
intravenous amiodarone loading and further evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease, status post
myocardial infarction in [**2136**] and [**2150**].  He is status post
multiple percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and
stents.  Last catheterization on [**11/2159**] showed an ejection
fraction of 15% with anterolateral apical and inferior
akinesis.  He had 2+ mitral regurgitation.  He had a 40%
distal left main lesion, left anterior descending flow was
occluded.  He had a 90% lesion at the left circumflex OM1
bifurcation.  He had 50% R-PLV.  Left circumflex was stented
with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of a
jailed OM1.  Congestive heart failure, his last
echocardiogram was [**2155**] with ejection fraction of 20% with
global hypokinesis, akinesis.  He has mild to moderate mitral
regurgitation, ventricular tachycardia, status post single
lead AICD in [**2157**], hypercholesterolemia, hypertension,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep
apnea with a CPEP machine at home.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Flovent 220 mcg 2 puffs b.i.d.,
Procainamide 1500 mg po t.i.d., Captopril 50 mg po t.i.d.,
Lopressor 37.5 po b.i.d., Lipitor 20 mg po q.h.s., Lasix 60
mg po b.i.d., potassium chloride, Isordil 10 mg po t.i.d.,
aspirin 325 mg po q.d., Wellbutrin 100 mg po b.i.d.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a retired policeman and works as a
private investigator.  He has a 60-70 pack year smoking
history and quit in [**2155**].  He uses alcohol infrequently.  He
is married, but separated, and has two children.

FAMILY HISTORY:  His father for hypercholesterolemia and
coronary artery disease.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Temperature of 98.1.  Pulse 82.
Respiratory rate of 16. Blood pressure 120/74.  O2 saturation
of 96% on room air.  On general exam, he is ruddy appearing,
awake, alert, conversive white male in no acute distress.  On
head, eyes, ears, nose and throat exam, he is normocephalic,
atraumatic.  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.
Sclerae are anicteric.  His mucous membranes were moist.  His
neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly and no
carotid bruits.  Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
On cardiovascular exam, he had a regular rate and rhythm with
normal S1, S2, soft systolic murmur at the upper sternal
border with no rubs or gallops.  His abdomen was soft, obese,
nontender, nondistended with normal active bowel sounds.  He
had no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities had no edema.  Rectal
exam, guaiac negative brown stool per Emergency Department
report.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count of 12.8,
hematocrit of 44, platelets of 176, sodium of 137, potassium
4.3, chloride of 100, bicarbonate of 25, BUN of 20,
creatinine of 1.2, glucose of 96, CK of 47, magnesium of 2.1,

Electrocardiogram showed regular wide complex tachycardia
rate 116 with a leftward axis and left bundle branch block.

Chest x-ray showed ICD in place in the left chest with some
cardiomegaly, mild pulmonary vascular redistribution.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted from the Emergency
Department and was loaded on amiodarone intravenous in the
Coronary Care Unit.  The patient was brought to the EP
laboratory for further evaluation of his dysrhythmias.  The
Procainamide was discontinued.  In the EP laboratory, both
atrial fibrillation and aflutter were found and the aflutter
was ablated.  The patient was also found to have ventricular
tachycardias and these were not amenable to ablation.  On the
following day, the patient also underwent an upgrade of his
ICD to a DDD pacemaker.  The ICD was upgraded to a
GEM3-AT7276 with [**Company 1543**] 5076 in the [**Company 1543**] 6937 with
leads to the SVCRA junction and the RA appendage as well as
to the right ventricle.  The patient remained in stable
condition throughout his hospital course.  He did have
occasional episodes of very brief tachycardia that were
asymptomatic and with the upgrade of the ICD and pacemaker,
any future episodes should be able to be recorded to
distinguish between a ventricular versus a supraventricular
cause of his tachycardia.

The patient is being discharged to continue his Amiodarone
load at 400 mg b.i.d. for one week, then 600 mg q.d. for
three weeks and then to 200 mg q.d.  The patient will
continue with antibiotic prophylaxis, his Keflex for a total
of 48 hours.  He is also being started on a very low dose of
Coumadin with follow-up INR within the next two days.  The
patient will have follow-up with the [**Hospital **] Clinic on the week
after discharge and he will also follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
the following week.  He is instructed not to drive or use his
left arm until further instructions.  Furthermore, he is
instructed not to drive due to the issue of the syncope.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Amiodarone as described above.
2.  Keflex 500 mg po q. 6. for another three doses.
3.  Coumadin 2.5 mg q.h.s. until further notice.
4.  Captopril 50 mg po t.i.d.
5.  Lasix 60 mg po q.d.
6.  Isordil 10 mg po t.i.d.
7.  Aspirin 325 mg po q.d.
8.  Wellbutrin 100 mg po b.i.d.
9.  KCL as further directed.
