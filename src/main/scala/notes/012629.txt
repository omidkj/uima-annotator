RADIOLOGY:
[**4-21**] CXR: There is new postoperative mediastinal widening and
mild enlarged cardiac silhouette. Perihilar haziness is new
consistent with fluid overload. There are no sizeable pleural
effusions or pneumothorax. There is a left chest tube. Mild
subcutaneous emphisema is in the left lower chest wall.

[**4-22**] CXR: Lower lung volumes, particularly on the right, may
explain the greater radiodensity of both lungs but I think there
is a component of new, mild pulmonary edema. Marked widening of
the postoperative mediastinum on [**4-21**], compared to [**4-12**],
is unchanged and while some of this may be due to both lower
lung volumes and volume overload and acute cardiomegaly, the
findings are concerning for hemorrhage either in the pericardium
or mediastinum or both. There is no appreciable left pleural
collection; however, a solitary left pleural drain runs along
the upper mediastinal contour superior to the aortic arch.

[**4-23**] CXR: A left chest tube has been removed and there is no
evidence for PTX. Left hemidiaphragm is elevated and there is
some density at the left base consistent with an effusion and
associated atelectasis. A retrocardiac pneumonia cannot be
excluded. The right lung is clear.

[**4-23**] CTA: No evidence of pulmonary embolus or thoracic aortic
dissection. Postoperative changes within the left upper lobe
consistent with resection of previously identified nodule.
Atelectasis along the medial aspect of the left lung and
bilateral lung bases.

[**4-24**] CXR: Central paramediastinal and left retrocardiac opacity
shows slight interval improvement with associated slight
increase in volume in the left lung, likely due to improving
postoperative atelectasis in this patient status post recent
left upper lobe resection. Small pleural effusion on the left is
unchanged. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable in
appearance. Mild interstitial edema is present.

[**4-25**] CXR: There is worsening opacification in the left
hemithorax with only a small amount of residual aerated lung in
the left apex and left perihilar region. Associated worsening
volume loss is present with further elevation of the left
hemidiaphragm. Lung volumes are low. Perihilar haziness has
developed in the right lung. Left pleural effusion is again
demonstrated with apparent new area of loculation laterally.

[**4-26**] CXR: Compared with previous examination, there is better
aeration of the left apex, with remaining degree of of
opacification of left hemithorax, most likely due to effusion
and underlying lung atelectasis. There is no significant change
in the degree of aeration of the right lung, considering
differences in techniques.

[**4-27**] Chest ultrasound: Dynamic ultrasound examination was
performed with inspiration, expiration, and sniffing. There is
absent diaphragmatic movement on the left with inspiration and
expiration and paradoxical elevation of the left hemidiaphragm
with the sniff test. Right diaphragmatic motion is normal. At
the left base, there is a combination of consolidated lung with
some residual hemothorax. No hypoechoic fluid is identified to
suggest transudative effusion.

[**4-27**] ECHO: Preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. No right-to-left
intracardiac shunt identified.  Compared with the report of the
prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2167-5-5**],
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is now identified.

[**4-28**] CXR: Opacification in the left lower lung zone may be a
combination of effusion and atelectasis, and remains stable
since the prior radiograph. Right lung field is clear. Moderate
cardiomegaly and pulmonary congestion in the left upper lobe
persists. Overall, no change from the prior radiograph two days
ago.

[**4-29**] CXR: Right PICC terminates in the proximal right atrium and
should be retracted approximately 4 cm to ensure location in the
SVC. The chest is otherwise unchanged in appearance with
opacification of the left lower lung zone due to a large pleural
effusion and atelectasis. Right lung remains clear. Moderate
cardiomegaly and pulmonary congestion of the left upper lobe
persists.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 9220**] was admitted and taken to the operating theater,
where she underwent a VATS, left upper lobe wedge resection,
mediastinal lymph node dissection, and flexible bronchoscopy.
Her operating room course was uncomplicated. She had a pleural
