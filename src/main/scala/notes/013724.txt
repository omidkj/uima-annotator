Intracardiac defibrillator placement


History of Present Illness:
83 YO gentleman with a history of HTN, DLD, DM and aortic
aneurysm repair in [**2093**] transferred from [**Hospital3 **] post-v
fib arrest. Patient was backing out of his daughter's driveway
earlier the day of admission when he became non responsive and
backed his car into the ditch at low speed (2mph). Trauma films
negative. Neighbor (EMT) responded to daughter's screams and
began compressions within 5-6 min of patient's loss of
consciousness. EMT's arrived shortly and initiate
defibrillation. He was shocked 4 times and regained spontaneous
circulation. Was transported to [**Hospital3 7569**] and was
subsequently airlifted to [**Hospital1 18**] where the arctic sun cooling
protocol was intiated.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 34.7 HR 66 BP 130/100 RR 14 [**Last Name (un) **]
100% on mechanical ventilation. ET tube placement was confirmed
by CXR. C-spine film was reported negative so his collar was
removed. Cooling was continued with the Arctic Sun protocol,
sedation with propofol.
Upon arrival to the floor the patient was intubated, sedated and
cooled. He was found to be bradycardic to the high 36's with
systolic pressures int he 150-160. Head CT from OSH was read as
negative. Rhythym initially appeared to be complete heart block
versus Wenkebach. EP was consulted and under their direction 1
mg of atropine was administered to discern between AV nodal
block and infranodal block. His rate increased to 50-60s with
1:1 conduction and fixed prolonged PR interval.
The cooling team was consulted as well an in the setting of his
bradyarrhythmia the decision was made to terminate cooling
protocol and rewarm the patient.
.
Per his daughter: Cardiac review of systems is notable for
absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, orthopnea.

Pertinent Results:
[**10-11**] Cardiac Cath:
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system
demonstrated
branch [**Month/Day (4) 12425**] disease. The LMCA had no angiographically apparent

disease. The LAD had a mid-[**Month/Day (4) 12425**] 50% stenosis. The LCx had no
angiographically apparent disease. The RCA had a 50% stenosis in
the
mid-[**Last Name (LF) 12425**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 80% stenosis in the R-PDA and a 50% stenosis in
the R-PL.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right- and left-sided
filling
pressures, with an RVEDP of 18 mm Hg and a PCWP of 20 mm Hg.
There was
mild pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension. The cardiac index
was
preserved. The systemic arterial blood rpessure was normal.
There was no
gradient upon pullback of the catheter from the left ventricle
to the
aorta.
3. Left ventriculography revealed mild global hypokinesis, with
more
prominent hypokinesis of the inferior wall. The calculated
ejection
fraction was 58%.
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Branch [**First Name3 (LF) 12425**] coronary artery disease.

[**10-11**] Echo:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal (abnormal septal motion). Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right
ventricular chamber size is mildly increased with normal free
wall motion. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The ascending aorta and descending thoracic aorta are
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent
fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with low normal
left ventricular systolic function without regional dysfunction.
Mild right ventricular cavity enlargement with normal free wall
motion. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Dilated
ascending aorta. Mild mitral regurgitation.

Brief Hospital Course:
83 YO gentleman s/p v fib arrest of unknown etiology. Admitted
to the CCU to initiate Arctic Cooling protocol.
.
# Cardiac Arrest: Unclear etiology of patient's VF/VT cardiac
arrest. Patient had thorough workup including cardiac cath,
which did not reveal a culprit lesion; echo, which showed
preserved EF 50% and no regional dysfunction; EP study, which
was not able to elicit an arrhythmia. Pt received a DD-Pacer for
his bradycardia and ICD to protect against future VF arrest.
Please see page 1 for activity restrictions regarding his ICD.
.
# CORONARIES: No signs of acute ischemia on EKG, only LBBB.
Biomarkers mildly elevated in setting of demand ischemia and
defibrillation. Arctic cooling protocol was initiated and then
stopped after 11 hours due to bradycardia. Cardiac Cath showed
no culprit lesion, and no intervention was performed. He did,
however, have CAD: the LAD had a mid-[**Month/Day/Year 12425**] 50% stenosis, the
LCx had no apparent disease, the RCA had a 50% stenosis in the
mid-[**Last Name (LF) 12425**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 80% stenosis in the R-PDA and a 50% stenosis in
the R-PL. The patient was started on 80mg atorvastatin and
aspirin, and his metoprolol was continued. He has chest pain
with coughing, thought to be secondary to CPR. Oxycodone can be
used for pain control.
.
# PUMP: Echo showed EF 50-55%, Normal biventricular cavity sizes
with low normal left ventricular systolic function without
regional dysfunction. Mild right ventricular cavity enlargement
with normal free wall motion. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hy
