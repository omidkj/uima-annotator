ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:  Pneumonia.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  MSSA line infection.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Right upper quadrant pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 4410**] is an 82-year-old
male with history of end stage renal disease on hemodialysis,
atrial fibrillation, peptic ulcer disease, hypertension, SVT
and triple A who presented with right upper quadrant pain,
right flank pain, nausea, retching and decreased appetite.
Three days prior to admission after his routine dialysis, he
noted some shakes and later that day he noted some right
upper quadrant pain that was intermittent.  Associated
symptoms included right flank pain, nausea, retching and
decreased appetite with poor oral intake.  The pain was not
associated with eating or position.  He describes no previous
episodes that were similar to this.  At his scheduled
dialysis on the day of admission, the dialysis center was
unable to access his catheter.  Of note, on [**2111-6-29**] he was
admitted to [**Hospital1 2025**] for line sepsis with MSSA and treated with
Vanc and Gent and then switched to Nafcillin for 6 weeks,
despite a TEE that was negative for vegetation.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for headache, visual changes,
chest pain, shortness of breath, PND, orthopnea, diarrhea,
change in color of stool, rashes or skin changes.  He does
complain of chronic constipation and longstanding decreased
sensation in his lower extremities.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, BPH, end stage renal
disease on hemodialysis, SVT, CVA, PVD with severe
claudication in left leg, status post left transmetatarsal
amputation, gastritis and esophagitis, atrial fibrillation,
triple A 4.3 cm in 12/98, 4.6 cm in 3/00, right inguinal
hernia, GI bleed [**2111-6-5**] while hospitalized at [**Hospital1 2025**] for line
sepsis.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  Amiodarone 200 mg q day, Nephrocaps one mg q
day, Phos-Lo 667 mg, three tablets tid, TUMS 500 mg three

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother, renal failure.  No diabetes,
hypertension, coronary artery disease or cancer.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Positive for tobacco, two packs per day for
65 years, occasional alcohol, no drugs.  He is a retired iron
worker.  He has three children and lives alone.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission temperature 99.0, pulse
76, respirations 18, blood pressure 116/70, 88% on room air
to 93% on two liters.  General, lying in bed in no apparent
distress.  HEENT:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light,
extraocular movements intact.  Oropharynx clear.  Moist mucus
membranes.  CV, quiet heart sounds, regular rate and rhythm,
no murmurs.  Pulmonary clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen soft, non distended, mild right upper quadrant
tenderness to deep palpation, no rubs or gallops, normoactive
bowel sounds.  Back, no CVA tenderness.  Extremities, no
edema, nontender, left transmetatarsal amputation, unable to
palpate DP pulses bilaterally but feet were warm.  Neuro,
alert and oriented times three, cranial nerves II through XII
grossly intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 13.2, 83 polys, no bands, 10
lymphs, 6 monos, hematocrit 41.5, platelet count 182,000, PT
13.4, INR 1.3, PTT 30.2, sodium 141, potassium 5.2, chloride
94, CO2 27, BUN 69, creatinine 10.5, glucose 87, blood
cultures were sent.  Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly and
small bilateral pleural effusions, septal line consistent
with mild interstitial edema.  Cannot rule out left lower
lobe pneumonia.  CT, triple A measures 4.8 cm maximum,
unchanged from [**3-/2110**], no appendicitis or diverticulitis, small
right pleural effusion, bibasilar consolidation, gallstones
right inguinal hernia without obstruction or strangulation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  While in the Emergency Room the patient's
symptoms greatly improved.  He was tolerating po in the
Emergency Room.  He had eaten a hamburger and has very little
pain.  The patient was admitted for further evaluation of
this right upper quadrant pain.  Blood culture quickly grew
out gram positive cocci which later were found to be MSSA.
The patient was started on Vanc 1 gm IV q day.  On hospital
day #2 the patient began to complain of dyspnea and pleuritic
chest pain.  He desatted to 87% on three liters which came
out to 90% on 100% non rebreather face mask.  His temperature
was 101.7.  ABG showed PO2 of 72, PCO2 41, PH 7.9.  The EKG
showed atrial fibrillation.  He was given 2 mg of Morphine
for the pain and they attempted to wean the patient off the
non rebreather.  However, he became hypotensive with blood
pressure 80's/50's, pulse 100-140.  He began to become
somnolent and did not respond to a 250 cc IV fluid bolus and
was transferred to the MICU.  While in the ICU the antibiotic
coverage was broadened to include Ceftriaxone and Flagyl.
The patient's pressures were supported with Neo and the
catheter was changed to a right groin Quinton catheter.  The
patient was stabilized and transferred back to the floor on
hospital day #4.  On hospital day #5 a TTE was performed that
showed a mildly dilated left atrium and a small mass or
artifact seen on the aortic valve in the LV outflow tract.
At this point the patient had grown out 6 bottles of
Oxacillin sensitive staff.  The patient's antibiotic coverage
was now changed to Oxacillin and Gentamycin.  The goal was
Oxacillin for six weeks and Gentamycin for two weeks.
Throughout the stay the patient received hemodialysis three
times a week without complications.  On hospital day #8 a
repeat chest x-ray was done that showed an increase in the
pleural effusion on the right with an appearance of
loculation.  After prolonged discussions with the patient,
the patient declined to have the effusion tapped.  The
patient continued to have difficulty with access throughout
his stay and MR venogram was performed and the venogram
showed complete SVC occlusion above the azygous, right
brachiocephalic, right subclavian and right IJ occlusion and
partial clot in the left brachiocephalic.  At this time it
was felt that it was unlikely to be able to get a PICC line
in the patient.  So after discussion with ID, antibiotic
coverage was now going to be changed to Oxacillin while an
inpatient and Vancomycin dosed at hemodialysis as an
outpatient, again for total treatment of 6 weeks.  On
hospital day #10 the patient developed diarrhea, the diarrhea
was non bloody, had no abdominal pain, it was sent for C.
diff and as of hospital day 12, one sample had come back
negative.  On hospital day #9, also the right groin Quinton
was removed without complication and on hospital day 11 a
tunneled groin cath was placed by IR.  This tunneled groin
cath was to be used for hemodialysis only.  Discussions with
transplant surgery were begun and the plan is for an AV
fistula after completion of the antibiotics.  Discussions
were also begun as to option for central access besides groin
line.  On hospital day #11, it was felt that the patient was
appropriate for acute rehab.  He was seen by case management
and referrals were placed.  The total antibiotic therapy was
started on [**11-12**] and the end date is [**12-23**].  He will receive
Oxacillin while an inpatient which will be changed to
Vancomycin dosed at hemodialysis as an outpatient.
