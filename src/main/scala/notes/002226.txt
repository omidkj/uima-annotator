Chief Complaint:
Exertional dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2112-6-27**] Aortic valve replacement (23mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Regent mechanical
valve)

History of Present Illness:
69 year old gentleman with a complex past medical history who
has known coronary artery disease status post angioplasty and
aortic stenosis followed by serial echocardiogram. He has
recently noticed increased dyspnea on exertion. Echo earlier
this year showed severe aortic stenosis with [**Location (un) 109**] 0.76cm2. He was
referred for a cardiac catheterization which revealed no
significant coronary disease and mild aortic stenosis. He
presents now to see if his dyspnea is related to his aortic
valve disease and if he should proceed with surgery. Of note,
pulmonary function testing and a chest CT scan were not
suggestive of any disease process which may be responsible for
his exertional dyspnea.

Pertinent Results:
[**2112-6-27**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The remaining
left ventricular segments contract normally. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
was notified in person of the results on this patient before
surgical incision.
POST-BYPASS: Intact thoracic aorta. Normal RV systolic function.
LVEF 50%. No oovious wall motion abnormalities withl imited
Midesophageal suboptimal views. The aortic valve is stable in
position, both leaflets open and the residual mean gradient is 8
mm of Hg.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 410**] was admitted the day before surgery for pre-operative
work-up and to be started on Heparin for history of atrial
fibrillation. On the following day he was brought to the
operating room where he underwent an aortic valve replacement.
Please see operative note for surgical details. Following
surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring
in stable condition. Later this day he was weaned from sedation,
awoke neurologically intact and extubated. He was started on
betablockers, statin therapy, ASA and ace-inhibitor and diuresed
toward his pre-operative weight. He was transferred tot he
stepdown unit for ongoing post-operative care. His chest tubes
and temporary pacing wires were removed per protocol. His
couamdin therapy was resumed for atrial fibrillation. On POD#5
he was cleared for discharge to home and all appointments and
instructions were advised.
