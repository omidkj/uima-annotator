brownish. Denies any chest pain, nausea, vomiting, sweating.
.
ED vitals were 98.3, irregular at 58, 116/58, 18, 96%/4L. CXRAY
showed atypical PNA. Was started on Azithromycin and
Levofloxacin. He was also hyperkalemic to 6.4. He got Calcium
gluconate, Insulin, D50 amp, Kayexalate. His potassium came down
to 5.6.

Past Medical History:

Physical Exam:
Vitals: 96.7, 95%/2L, 110/D, 82, 28
GEN: AOx3
HEENT: unremarkable
Neck: JVD to around 8 cms
HEART: S1/S2, irregular rate, no murmurs appreciable
LUNGS: transmitted coarse breath sounds, no crackles
ABDOMEN: soft/NT/ND
EXT: 2+ pedal edema (chronic)


Pertinent Results:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2148-5-26**]
Slightly limited examination secondary to very low lung volumes.
Bibasilar atelectasis and ill-defined fluffy, patchy opacities
present in the right lung apex could be reflective of an
underlying multifocal process. Atypical infections should be
considered given the right apical finding.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
89 yo M with CAD, CHF admitted for community acquired pneumonia
and hyperkalemia; hospital course also complicated by CHF/volume
overload and hypotension requiring short MICU stay.
.
# Hypotension: Following treatment of his pneumonia (see below),
the patient was aggressively diuresed for persistent volume
overload and peripheral edema.  During his diuresis, he began to
experience generalized weakness and fatigue.  He also developed
acute onset of fever to 103 and hypotension with altered mental
status.  He was bolused with fluids and antibiotics were
started.  Cultures were also taken.  During the acute event he
was intubated for airway protection (altered mental status) and
extubated approximately 12 hours later.  His MICU stay was less
than 48 hours.  The differential for this acute episode included
sepsis vs. overdiuresis/dehydration.  The episode was also
shortly following a traumatic foley insertion for urinary
retention.  No source of infection was found (U/A and culture
clean, CXR not showing infiltrate and sputum negative, blood
cultures negative).  He had been getting aggressive diuresis
(weight decreased 10 lbs since admission) and it could be
attributed to this.  Given no source, his broad spectrum
antibiotics were discontinued.  His volume status is currently
stable.
.
# Community acquired PNA: he presented with cough with sputum,
CXR consistent with atypical pneumonia.  Levofloxacin course was
completed.  He also has some wheezing of unclear chronicity and
was treated with some nebulizer treatments. He will be sent home
with a prescription for albuterol MDI if needed.  Oxygen
saturations remained adequate on room air and with ambulation.
A Legionella urinary antigen was also sent and was negative.
.
# Congestive heart failure: presented with elevated JVP to
around 8 cms and [**1-6**]+ bilateral pedal edema.  However he showed
no signs of pulmonary edema by exam and CXR.  He was
aggressively diuresed as above, leading to hypotension and acute
renal failure.  The aggressive diuresis was thus discontinued
and he was stable with continued asymptomatic volume overload
(no pulmonary edema or dyspnea).   His med changes included: d/c
of amiodarone and cardizem, start of digoxin.  His ACE inhibitor
is also on hold but will likely be restarted as an outpatient as
blood pressure allows.  He will be seeing his cardiologist on
Friday to make further medication changes if needed.
.
# CAD: Toprol was continued.  Also on statin and nitro patch.
He is not on a daily aspririn, perhaps because he is on
coumadin-this is unclear.
.
# Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter: rate controlled.
Amiodarone and cardizem were discontinued; metoprolol and
digoxin continued.  He is anticoagulated with coumadin.
.
# Renal Failure: baseline creatinine is 1.3 (on NEBH records),
elevated to maximum 2.2 during diuresis which came down with
fluid resuscitation.  1.1 on day of discharge.
.
# Hyperkalemia: K was elevated at admission without significant
ECG changes.  He received kayexalate, calcium gluconate, insulin
and glucose.  Serial K levels showed improvement and he did not
require further treatment.  Most likely this was due to ARF.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: Lipitor was continued.
