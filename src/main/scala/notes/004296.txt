Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**]
Chief Complaint:
Chronic cholecystitis with  gallstones and common bile

Open cholecystectomy
Ventral Hernia Repair with mesh buttress and component
    separation.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 75-year-old gentleman who recently presented with
gallstone pancreatitis over a month ago. He was cared for  by my
associate Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
[**Name (STitle) **] and at that time he received an endoscopic
sphincterotomy for his common bile duct stone disease. He
recovered well from this but required a cholecystectomy for his
demonstrated gallstone disease. Furthermore, it was a
clear to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] that the patient had a significant ventral
hernia problem from a prior abdominal aortic aneurysm repair
many years ago.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2118-12-30**] 7:09 AM
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
75 year old man with acute asthma attack.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please evaluate for fluid in airway, aspiration, possible cause
of SOB
Lung volumes are appreciably lower than they were on [**12-23**], a finding that does not correspond to bronchospasm. Mild
cardiomegaly is worse. There is no pulmonary vascular
congestion. The asymmetric vascular distribution, with
deficiency in the right lung is longstanding.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2118-12-31**] 5:56 AM
Reason: ? RESPIRATORY DISTRESS
FINDINGS: Again noted are diminished lung volumes, which are
stable relative to [**12-30**], but represent acute change
relative to [**12-23**]. These findings are not consistent with
an asthma attack. No focal consolidation is identified. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. The visualized osseous
structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Stable examination with low lung volumes and no
superimposed consolidation.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2119-1-2**] 8:36 AM
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
75 year old man with scattered rales and scattered rhonchi
The heart size is mildly enlarged but stable. The mediastinal
contours, width and position are unremarkable. The bibasilar
atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusion is unchanged
within the limitation of the apical projection of this film.
On [**1-4**] the patient continue to have respiratory distress.
Whent to xray, and in the wiating room, coded.
Massive PE was discovbered. the patient had 20 of pulseness
electrical activity.
CTA
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli as described above.
2. Patchy opacities in the left upper lobe, right upper lobe,
right lower
lobe, and left lower lobe.
3. Postoperative changes of the abdominal wall.
4. Mildly dilated loops of small bowel with no obvious
transition point. C/W
ileus.
5. Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with maximal AP
dimension of
approximately 4.1 cm.
6. Snall amount of fluid within the gallbladder fossa, likely
postoperative

Admitted to icu. No neuro response after. Hypotensive an in PEA
for 20 minutes. Neurology consulted:
CC: seizures

HPI: The patient is a 75yo R-handed man with COPD, s/p AAA
repair, who was admitted [**12-28**] for an open CCY/Ventral
herniorrhaphy. He was brought to the TSICU w/ acute respiratory
distress, ARF, oliguria on POD#1 ([**12-30**]). He improved and was
sent to the floor. On POD#7 ([**1-4**]), he was sent for CXR where
was found down. A code was called after about one minute. He did

not have a pulse and did not breath. CPR was started and he was
intubated at the site. Monitor showed PEA. After atropine and
CPR
for 20 minutes, he developed a pulse.

Workup revealed a saddle embolus and R-popliteal embolus. He is
maintained on a heparin drip.

Since the code he has been remained intubated. His exam off
propofol per team showed intact bs reflexes, but otherwise no
response to noxious. When lowering the propofol in the evening
of
[**1-5**], head and bilateral arm jerking was seen, with eyes rolled

backwards. This activity continued until the propofol was
increased. A CT head was obtained which did not show a
hemorrhage
or acute pathology. He was loaded on an AED at that time.

Sputum cultures grew enterobacter and pseudomonas for which he
is
being treated with cipro.

We are now called to further assist in management and workup of
seizures. No further seizure activity has been noted (but he has

remained on propofol).
