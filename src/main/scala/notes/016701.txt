Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain resulting in inferior myocardial
infarction with cardiogenic shock.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old man with a
past medical history significant for inferior MI 2-3 years,
who was admitted from an outside hospital for cardiac
catheterization status post ST elevation inferior MI.  The
patient developed dizziness, lightheadedness, chest pain, and
diaphoresis on the afternoon of admission after awaking from
a nap.  The patient briefly passed out and was found by his
wife, who activated EMS.  The patient was transported to
[**Hospital1 **], who found him with a heart rate in the 40s and SBP
in the 70s.  The patient received 0.5 mg of atropine in the
field and then another 0.5 mg.

In the ED, the patient had a SBP of 100 and chest pain that
was nearly gone.  EKG showed bradycardia with ST elevations
in leads II, III, and aVF.  The patient received aspirin, IV
nitroglycerin, IV fluids, Heparin, and Integrilin, and
transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for
emergent cardiac catheterization.

On route in helicopter, the patient had a VF arrest with
temporary pacing pads placed.  Systolic blood pressure in the
40s.  When arrived to the Catheterization Laboratory,
systolic blood pressure remained in the 40s.  The patient
received CPR and temporary pacing wires were placed with RV
pacing.  The patient had placement of an intra-aortic balloon
pump.  Angiography relieved a right dominant system with
single vessel disease.  The left main with no angiography
apparent flow limiting disease.  LAD and left circumflex with
mild disease.  The RCA was a large and totally occluded
proximally with no flow and was stented.  Patient underwent
cardiogenic shock and repeated arrest during catheterization.
Cardioversion and wide open dopamine, Levophed, Epinephrine,
vasopressin, and dobutamine were started.  The patient was
bolused with amiodarone and started on the drip.

Cardiac catheterization revealed a RA pressure of 36.  RV of
44/24.  PA of 43/38.  Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of
35.  Cardiac output of 4.3.  Cardiac index of 2.2, SVR of
540.

Patient was intubated in critical condition and transferred
to CCU for further care.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Status post MI three years ago.
2. Hypercholesterolemia.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  None recorded.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure 85/56, pulmonary artery
pressure 46/28, heart rate 106.  Patient was ventilated on AC
with a tidal volume of 800 with a respiratory rate of 30,
FIO2 of 0.7, and a PEEP of 5.  Generally: Unresponsive,
intubated.  Cardiac:  Regular, rate, and rhythm.  Pulmonary:
rhonchi bilaterally.  Coarse breath sounds.  Abdomen:  Obese,
soft, nontender, nondistended, decreased bowel sounds.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema, 1+ distal
pulses.  Neurologic:  Pupils fixed and dilated.  Corneal
reflexes absent.  Absent doll's eyes.  No gag.  No response
to noxious stimuli.

LABORATORIES OF SIGNIFICANCE:  White count of 16.8,
hematocrit 36.6, PTT of 150, INR of 1.9, D/dimer 1,000-2,000.
Potassium 2.8, BUN 13, creatinine 1.3, glucose 798, free
calcium 0.77, troponin-T 0.25.  ABG:  7.03 pH, pCO2 42, pO2
340, lactate 11.

CHEST X-RAY:  Consistent with CHF.

ECG outside hospital:  Sinus bradycardia at approximately 45
beats per minute, axis, consistent with right ventricular
hypertrophy, ST elevations in leads II, III, and aVF.

ECHOCARDIOGRAM:  No tamponade and no right ventricular
movement.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular:
Coronaries:  The patient is status post inferior MI
complicated by cardiogenic shock and asystole with resuscitation
and stent of RCA.  The patient was maintained on aspirin and
Plavix. Beta blockers and ACE inhibitors were held off as patient
was on multiple pressors.

Rhythm: AV sequential pacing continued initially but sinus
rhythm restored on day 2.

Pump: There was severe right heart failure with mild LV systolci
dysfunction.

Blood pressure:  Patient on multiple drip pressors from
Catheterization Laboratory is currently maintained on
dobutamine, dopamine, Epinephrine, Levophed, and
Neo-Synephrine.  Epinephrine was weaned off on hospital day
#2.

2. Renal:  The patient had an elevated creatinine unknown
baseline level, likely acute renal failure due to
underperfusion with low SBPs.

3. Heme:  The patient was anticoagulated with Heparin without
bleeding complications.

4. Endocrine:  The patient had elevated sugars on admission
as when maintained on an insulin drip, and was able to
titrate his sugars down to 200 on hospital day two.

5. Neurologic:  There was no recovery of consciousness and exam
showed dilated pupils without light reactivity and corneal
reflexes were absent.

6. Acid base:  The patient with severe metabolic acidosis
with very high lactate and question diabetic ketoacidosis.
Patient was running with respiratory alkalosis with a
respiratory rate of 30 to blow off the CO2.

7. Pulmonary:  Patient had an oxygen saturation that was
stable on ventilation with high minute volumes to help
compensate for severe metabolic acidosis.

8. Prophylaxis:  The patient was maintained on
anticoagulation for DVT prophylaxis and proton-pump inhibitor
is maintained for GI prophylaxis.

9. Code:  Upon initial discussion with the family on hospital
day one, the family was adamant about having full code, but
however, on hospital day two with further discussion with the
family, the family decided to make the patient DNR/DNI, and
to withdraw the pacing wires.

Throughout the day, the patient was still maintained on the
five pressors, however, on hospital day two, the patient
began to have some bradycardia to the 70s, and subsequently
within an hour of DNR/DNI, had an asystolic event that
eventually led to the patient's death.  The patient was
pronounced dead at 19:20 hours on [**2120-9-1**].

The patient's family was called, and the patient's family
declined postmortem examination.  Attending was notified of
this event.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Patient is deceased.
