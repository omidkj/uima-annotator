History of Present Illness:
This patient is a 72-year-old woman who presented with cardiac
tamponade following perforation which occurred during dialysis
catheter change. She has a history of end-stage renal disease,

Pertinent Results:
[**2197-7-10**] ECHO
There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is unusually small. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets
are mildly thickened with at least trace aortic regurgitation
(limited view). The aortic valve is not well seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened; mitral regurgitation not
detected in limited parasternal view. There is a moderate sized
pericardial effusion. The effusion is partially echo dense,
consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.There are
bubbles in the right atrium consistent with bubbles from
intravenous fluid.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2194-11-10**],
left ventricular cavity size is now significantly smaller. Right
ventricular systolic function appears less vigorous.

[**2197-7-10**] ECHO
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 50 %). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is a small to moderate sized pericardial
effusion. The effusion appears loculated. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was
notified in person of the results on [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] at 9pm.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2197-7-10**] for hemodialysis
and exchange of her hemodialysis catheter. In the afternoon, she
became acutely hypotensive. An echo revealed tamponade and the
cardiac surgical service was consulted. Pericardiocentesis was
performed which revealed fresh blood. She was taken emergently
to the operating room where she underwent a mediastinal
exploration with a bruised area at the junction of the SVC and
the right atrium was sutured. Postoperatively she was taken to
the intensive care unit for monitoring. She later awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. She was transferred to
the floor on POD # 2. She was transfused. She required extensive
pulmonary toilet and was started on nebulizers. Her lung exam
improved. She was cultured for fever, all cultures were
negative. She was dialyzed on Monday [**7-17**] and she was ready for
return to Presentation Manor.

Of note, her current dialysis catheter was used under emergent
conditions, however there are no signs or symptoms of exit site
infection and it currently should not be changed.
