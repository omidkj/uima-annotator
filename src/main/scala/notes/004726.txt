History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 103353**] is a 62 yo man with h/o CAD s/p early MI,
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, smoking who [**Last Name (un) **]
at 11:45 he was walking with his sisters after getting a cup of
coffe and he collapsed on his face approximately at 11:50 (wife
spoke with patient at 11:45 on cell phone).  911 was called; per
the family approximately 5-10 minutes elapsed prior to the
arrival of 1st responders and initiation of CPR.  EMS arrived
shortly thereafter and he was found to be in VT.  First EMS
strip is 11:54 and appears to be sinus bradycardia with very
wide QRS and PR.  Subsequent strips by EMS show VT at 12:01,
12:04, 12:05, 12:06.  Multiple VT morphologies and cycle
lengths.  He was shocked 4 times; "post shock" rythm shows
resoration of sinus rhythma with very prolonged intervals.
There are numerous rhythm strips showing VT at variable cycle
lengths and morphologies.  He also received 3mg epi, 2mg
atropine, and lidocaine.
.
Upon further history taking, he was in his usual state of health
until a few days ago when he began complaining of feeling
generally unwell.  As per wife, no specific complaints of chest
pain, palpitations, dyspnea.  Speaking with his primary care
year.  He was seen mid-[**Month (only) **] where his Hgb A1c was found to be
10, his Cr 2.4, and K 5.9 on lisinopril 5mg po daily.  His
hyperkalemia was managed by holding his ACE inhibitor.  He was
seen in clinic on [**4-25**] and he was started on lisinopril 10mg
po daily + lasix 40mg po daily without repeating a potassium
measurement.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**] ED he was found to be in VT again, received 2 shocks
and 300mg amiodarone bolus, heparin bolus, 1mg epi x 2, 1mg
atropine, aspirin, versed, and dopamine drip.  In the cath lab
he was found to have what appeared to be chronic occlusions of
his LAD and RCA.  He had no PCI but did have an IABP placed.  In
the cath lab he had inumerable episodes of VT and was probably
shocked 30 times.  He received 2g calcium chloride, 4mg
atropine, amiodarone 1mg drip, epinephrine 4mg bolus and
epinephrine 3mcg/min bolus, levophed drip at 1mg/min, lidocaine
200mg bolus, 2g magnesium, 150mEq bicarbonate, 2mg versed,
insulin + bicarbonate.  Peri-code it was discovered that his K
was 6.9; the VT appeared to respond most favorably to
insulin/dextrose & bicarbonate.  Upon arriving to the CCU he
immediately went into VT again and was coded for about 15
minutes with numerous shocks, several rounds of epi/atropine,
amio bolus.  He returned to NSR.
.
Around 5pm he was noted to have rhythmic tongue twitching.
slightly decreased with ativan.

STUDIES:
ECHOCARDIOGRAM: [**2160-5-6**]
The left ventricular cavity is dilated. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %) with some relatively
improved contractility in the basal inferior and anteroseptal
walls. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
severe global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve is not
well seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Severe biventricular
systolic dysfunction.
.
C CATH [**2160-5-6**]: report pending.
.
EEG [**2160-5-7**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to
a slow and
disorganized background indicative of a moderate encephalopathy.

Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the
most
common causes. Anoxia is another possibility. There are no areas
of
focal slowing although encephalopathies can obscure focal
findings.
There were no epileptiform features noted.
.
CT HEAD: [**2160-5-7**]
1. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or major
territorial infarct is apparent. Of note, MRI with
diffusion-weighted sequences are more sensitive for evaluation
of acute ischemia.
2. Extensive sinus disease.
.
CT CHEST: [**2160-5-7**]
1. Complete collapse of the left lower lobe and partial collapse
of the right lower lobe, likely secondary to secretions. Small
bilateral pleural
effusions.
2. Diffuse stranding around the body and tail of the pancreas
which is
concerning for pancreatitis. Clinical correlation is
recommended. If there
is clinical concern for pancreatitis, a CT of the abdomen may be
obtained for further characterization.
3. Bilateral indeterminate low-density lesions within the
kidneys bilaterally
which statistically most likely represent renal cysts. An
ultrasound may be obtained for further characterization.
4. Multiple right-sided rib fractures involving ribs one through
five
anteriorly and possible fracture of rib nine posteriorly which
are attributed to recent CPR.
.
LENI: [**2160-5-8**]: Negative for DVT bilaterally.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 67006**] is a 62 yo man with CAD, CKD, DM who presented
with cardiac arrest and fall.
.
# Cardiac arrest:  After further history and evaluation it was
felt that his cardiac arrest was most likely a primary
arrhythmic event from metabolic derangement (most likely
hyperkalemia) given the numerous morphologies of his VT from the
EMS & the wide intervals of his sinus rhythm EKG.  However,
given that the patient's first set of labs were drawn after
several cycles of CPR, it is impossible to know whether his
hyperkalemia on admission was the primary problem or secondary.
He was taken to the cath lab and found to have multiple chronic
appearing occulsions of the coronary arteries with good
colateral circulation.  There was no evidence of an acute
coronary occulsion. During the next few hours, the patient
continued to have VT/VF which was refractory to aggressive
therapy.  He was shocked over 30 times on the day of admission
and he received repeated cycles CPR, his electrolyte abnorm
