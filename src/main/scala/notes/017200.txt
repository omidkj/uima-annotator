Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10323**]
Chief Complaint:
Pre-syncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 55 yo woman with progressive metastatic RCC s/p IL2,
s/p cardiac arrest earlier this year, CHF with EF 35-40%, who
presents weakness and an episode of syncope earlier today. She
describes that she felt tired yesterday and got up and attempted
to go to work this morning. On the way to work she felt very
tired and dizzy and then when she was in the elevator at work
fell over. She denies any preceding palpitations or chest pain,
and denies every feeling confused. No incontinence. She did hit
her head but does not think that she lost consciousness.
.
She does state that in retrospect she had some urgency with
urination over the last few days but no increased frequency or
dysuria. No hematuria. Otherwise, she has been in her normal
state of health. No fevers or chills at home. Has had a dry
cough for the past few weeks, non-productive.
.
In ED she was mentating well throughout but with systolic BPs in
the 50s. She received 4L NS with transient rise in SBP to low
100s, then dropped again to 70s. CVL was placed and
norepinephrine was started. Labs were significant for WBC 16.9,
lactate 3.2, UA moderate bacteria, 13 WBC, small leuk, negative
nitrites. Given concern for urosepsis; she was given
levofloxacin 750mg x1 and BCx were drawn. She had a CTA that was
negative for PE. Head CT was not done given no focal findings.
Of note, the patient's oncologist was notified in the ED.
.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was recently admitted the the hospital at the beginning
of [**Month (only) 404**] for high dose IL2 biotherapy. She developed
hypotension and [**Last Name (un) **] in the setting of high-dose IL-2 biotherapy
initiation. She was transferred to the MICU after she devloped
IL-2 myocarditis and ventricular tachycardia that progressed to
pulseless VT. She was resuscitation but her post arrest ECHO
showed depressed global left ventricular systolic function. She
was started on Amiodarone prior to discharge. Of note, she was
also treated for a pansensitive Klebsiella and E.Coli UTI during
that admission with Cetriaxone and then Cefpodoxime.
.
Since discharge, she has been following with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 622**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 17265**]; she is not currently on chemo but has plans to
start a clinical trial. She has also been following with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]; they discontinued her
amiodarone because of transaminitis and she was started on
Toprol 3 days ago and her cardiolgists are considering ICD.
.
On arrival to the ICU, the patient was comfortable, without any
pain or complaints. She was initially on oxygen but this was
easily weaned off.

IMAGING:
[**2118-3-7**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Allowing for differences in technique,
mild interval increase in the known largest metastatic nodule in
the right lung base.

[**2118-3-7**] CT-A:
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism.
2. Interval increase in the size and number of multiple
metastases.

[**2118-3-8**] ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is moderate to severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] The right ventricular free wall thickness is
normal. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. An
eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the
regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly
underestimated (Coanda effect). Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**2118-3-10**] CXR:
IMPRESSION: Slight increase in size of small right-sided pleural
effusion
with new consolidation at the base of the right lower lobe which
could
represent pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.


Brief Hospital Course:
54 year-old female with a history of metastatic renal cell
carcinoma who presented after a pre-syncopal event and
hypotension in ED.

[**Hospital Unit Name 13533**]:
# Hypotension: Initially thought to be urosepsis and exacerbated
by recent initiation of B-blocker. On initial presentation, she
briefly required a pressor, but SBPs resolved. Admission lactate
3.2, which improved with IVF.  Of note, other possible
explanations could be adrenal tumor invasion knowing metastatic
RCC, but recent CT of Ab/Pelvis did
