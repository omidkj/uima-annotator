Service:  GENERAL SURGERY

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73-year-old
gentleman who is a nursing home resident with hypertension,
dementia, and atypical psychosis who was found to have a
fever and mental status depression at his nursing home on
[**2177-11-15**].  He was transferred to the [**Hospital6 1760**] for further evaluation.

On arrival, he was tachycardiac to the 120s and hypotensive
to a blood pressure of 60.  He was fluid resuscitated and
cultures were drawn.  A chest x-ray showed evidence of
bilateral lower lobe pneumonia.  With 2.5 liters of
intravenous fluid, his blood pressure came up to the 100
range but he was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
for further evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Dementia.
3.  Atypical psychosis.
4.  Tremor disorder thought to be Parkinsonian in nature but
this has not been evidently sorted out.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The patient was somewhat
somnolent but was arousable to voice and to noxious stimuli.
His vital signs included a temperature of 103.6, heart rate
120, blood pressure 60/30 that improved to 100/50 with volume
infusion.  His examination was notable for coarse breath
sounds at the bilateral lower lobe bases and some abdominal
distention.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit with sepsis thought to possibly be due to
underlying pneumonia; however, the patient had an enormous
volume requirement of approximately 15 liters over the
subsequent two days and began having copious diarrhea which
suggested possible fulminant C. difficile colitis.  Indeed, a
stool sample did come back early in his hospital course that
was positive for C. difficile.

On hospital day number four, the surgical team was consulted
and we reviewed his CT scan which showed evidence of
pancolitis.  His history and hospital course were consistent
with fulminant colitis for which it seemed that surgery
really was the only option as he had been on intravenous
Flagyl for the first four days of his hospital course as part
of his treatment for sepsis.

However, the patient had already been started on Pressors
including Levophed.  Thus, surgery was deemed to be high
risk.  We met with the family and discussed the treatment
options including additional and alternative medical
interventions as well as surgery which would specifically be
total abdominal colectomy with an end-ileostomy.  We told the
family that surgery would be high risk but they felt that
since this really represented his only chance of recovery
that they wanted us to proceed.

Thus, on [**2177-11-18**], we took the patient to the
Operating Room and performed a total abdominal colectomy.  We
found a large distended colon with extensive intra-abdominal
ascites.  The pathology on the specimen did indeed show
pseudomembranous colitis.

At the end of the case, we were manipulating the nasogastric
tube and this created a splenic capsular tear which we
attempted to control with Surgicel and electrocautery.
However, the bleeding continued so we ended up performing an
expeditious splenectomy.

Postoperatively, the patient did respond initially to
continued aggressive resuscitation with some improvement in
his hemodynamics.  However, his postoperative course remained
somewhat [**Male First Name (un) 3928**] and he was diagnosed with E. coli pneumonia
which was likely due to preoperative aspiration.  In
addition, he had evidence of ARDS by chest x-ray and
ventilator mechanics.  He also was found to have a persistent
contractable colitis of his rectal stump which retreated in
consultation with Gastroenterology with a single dose of IV
Ig and in consultation with ID with vancomycin enemas in his
rectal stump.

The patient did improve after these interventions but he
really had some difficulty weaning off the pressors.  He was
thus tested for adrenal insufficiency which was found to be
positive.

Two weeks into his postoperative course, however, the patient
remained on the ventilator and was still rather unstable from
a respiratory standpoint with continued ARDS from his
underlying aspiration E. coli pneumonia and massive fluid
overload from his perioperative resuscitation.  Thus, at this
point, the family expressed desires to withdrawal care and
make him comfort measures only.

This was instituted on the evening of postoperative day
number 18.  The patient expired shortly thereafter.  An
autopsy was declined by the family.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Fulminant C. difficile colitis, status post total
abdominal colectomy and incidental splenectomy on [**2177-11-18**].
2.  E. coli pneumonia.
3.  Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome.
4.  Pseudomembranous proctitis.
5.  Adrenal insufficiency.
6.  Hypertension.
7.  Delirium.
