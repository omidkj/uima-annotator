History of Present Illness:
72M with a history of DM, CHF, and newly diagnosed NSCLC stage
IIIB cycle 1 day 9 of [**Doctor Last Name **]/taxol + XRT who presented to the ED
for a sensation of his pills getting stuck in his throat. He
reports that he has been tolerating his first cycle of
chemoradiation well, but has had some reflux / gastritis
symptoms lately. He is also getting XRT to his chest with
esophageal exposure. He does not take any H2 blockers or PPIs,
but has been taking tums. After his XRT today he took compazine,
magnesium supplement, and a calcium supplement, and they got
stuck in his throat. He drank 3 cups of water to try to wash
them down, without avail. He then ate 2 muffins to wash them
down, also without any success. He called in to Oncology to
report his problem, and ultimately came in to the ED for further
evaluation.
.
In the ED initial vital signs were 97.7  130/63  81  16  98% on
RA. A CXR was done and did not visualize any pills in the
esophagus or mediastinal air. GI was consulted and agreed to
perform an EGD on the patient in the AM. He was admitted to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for EGD in the AM.
.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] he is able to eat and drink. He has persistent
discomfort especially with swallowing. He denies F/C/Sw. He is
able to tolerate his secretions.


Past Medical History:
- NSCLC IIIB (T2N2M0): Initially noted to have a right middle
lobe lung nodule on chest x ray done for pneumonia in [**2173-4-19**]
with subsequent chest CT on [**2173-5-8**] showing a 2.4 x 1.6 cm right
middle lobe nodule as well as bibasilar infiltrates and
mediastinal lymphadenopathy (1.9 x 1.3 cm left paratracheal and
1.8 x 0.8 cm subcarinal). Repeat chest CT on [**2173-7-28**] was
interpreted as persistent right middle lobe nodule grossly
unchanged to slightly larger in size with the mediastinum
commented as stable. On [**2174-5-2**] a repeat chest CT showed an
increase in size to 4 x 2.3 cm of the spiculated nodule abutting
the hemidiaphragm without mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.
Subsequent PET/CT on [**2174-5-5**] showed FDG-avid uptake in the
nodule with peak SUV 7.3 as well as in a small right hilar lymph
node with peak SUV 4.8 without other areas of abnormal uptake
identified. Underwent cervical mediastinoscopy and bronchoscopy
with bronchoalveolar lavage on [**2174-5-16**] with pathology positive
for adenocarcinoma in level 7 lymph nodes (CK7 positive, CK20
and TTF negative). Lymph nodes from levels 2R, 4L, and 4L were
negative for malignancy. Cytology from bronchoalveolar lavage
from the right middle lobe was also positive for adenocarcinoma.
Started definitive chemoradiation on [**2174-6-16**] with weekly
carboplatin and taxol and XRT.
- COPD, [**5-10**] PFTs with mild obstructive disease and mild gas
exchange abnormality
- Diverticulosis and diverticulitis

Brief Hospital Course:
72M with a history of DM, CHF, and newly diagnosed NSCLC stage
IIIB cycle 1 day 9 of [**Doctor Last Name **]/taxol + XRT who presented to the ED
for a sensation of his pills getting stuck in his throat.

# Globus sensation: Pt reports the acute sensation that some
pills are stuck in his throat. He was able to tolerate both
liquids and solids, making a true FB in the throat unlikely.
While in the ICU, he was started on a clear liquid diet, as well
as pantoprazole 40mg IV, and Maalox/lidocaine for the
sticking/painful sensations in his throat. A CXR of the patient
revealed an unchanged right lower lobe mass and no radiopaque
foreign body. The patient's painful swallowing was improved with
these measures. In the AM the patient was able to tolerate a
full diet, and and it was decided to send him home on a PPI,
Maalox, and in addition attempt to convert as many of his
medications as possible to forms which could be crushed, a list
of which was given to him.

# CHF: No acute events within the hospital setting. We continued
his home medications of Digoxin 125 mcg PO daily, Furosimide 80
mg PO QAM and 40 mg PO QPM, Quinapril 10 mg PO daily,
Spironolacone 25 mg PO daily, and Metolazone 6.125 mg daily PRN
LE edema. While he was in the hospital we decreased his home ASA
to 81 mg PO daily, but discharged him on his home regimen of 162
mg, to be further discussed with his PCP.

# COPD:  No acute events within the hospital setting. We
continued his home nebs and Advair.

# BPH:  No acute events within the hospital setting. We
continued his Dutasteride 0.5 mg PO daily and Tamsulosin 0.4 mg
PO daily

# Diabetes: The patient's blood sugars remained controlled int
he hosptial setting. We held the patient's metformin, and
started him on a Humalog Insulin Sliding Scale; we discharged
him home on his home regimen of metformin.
