Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
Anterior ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Cypher Stent to proximal LAD
Intra-aortic balloon pump insertion, and removal



History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 64 y.o. male w/ pmh CAD, s/p inferior STEMI in
[**2134**] treated with BMS to left CX with known occluded RCA, who
awoke from sleep at 1am with with crushing substernal chest
pain. The patient called EMS, was transported to [**Hospital1 **], where he was found to have an anterior STEMI. He V-Fib
arrested in the ED, was defibrillated, given amiodarone 300mg,
placed on lidocaine gtt, and intubated. Total code time was
20-30 minutes. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on lidocaine gtt.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], he received aspirin and plavix, and was
started on heparin and integrellin. He was hypotensive and so
was started on a dopamine drip. Left heart cath at [**Hospital1 18**]
revealed occlusion of prox LAD, LAD w/ 40-50% occlusion, RCA
with total occlusion and with left to right collateralls. He
received a cypher stent to the LAD. The patient had a swan
placed which revealed elevated wedge pressures to 26. He was
given lasix 80mg IV. Patient also became acidotic 7.01 w/
elevated CO2 73. Given his proximal LAD lesion, along with
marginal blood pressures on dopamine, a balloon pump 40cc was
inserted 1:1.
.
patient is intubated and unable to provide ROS.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for chest pain

EKG [**2143-2-4**]:

Sinus rhythm. Left atrial enlargement. Low limb lead voltage.
Prior
anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Compared to the previous
tracing
of [**2134-10-6**] the rate has increased. There is variation in
precordial
lead placement. The previously recorded early precordial R wave
transition is
no longer in evidence. There are now Q waves in leads V1-V2
consistent with
interim anteroseptal infarction. The limb lead voltage has
diminished.
The rate has increased and there are ST-T wave changes. Followup
and clinical
correlation are suggested.

Cardiac Catheterization [**2143-2-4**]:

1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
3 vessel disease with an acute proximal LAD lesion.  The LMCA
had no
angiographically apparent flow limiting disease.  The LAD had an
acute
lesion of 99% stenosis in the proximal segment.  The first
diagonal had
80% stenosis.  The LCX had 40% hazy stenosis at the mid segment.
 The
RCA was chronically totally occluded at the proximal segment and
was
filled by left to right collaterals.
2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated markedly elevated right
sided
filling pressures (RVEDP 26 mm Hg) and markedly elevated left
sided
filling pressures (PCWP 25 mm Hg).  There was mild PA
hypertension (PA
40/27 mm Hg).
3.
4.  Stenting of very proximal LAD with Cypher 3x18mm stent
posted to
3.25mm in setting of STEMI.
5.  IABP inserted for cardiogenic shock.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Mild diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Acute anterior myocardial infarction, managed by acute ptca.
 PTCA of  vessel.

Transthoracic Echo [**2143-2-4**]:

The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
moderate to severe hypokinesis of the septum. The anterior wall
may be hypokinetic also. The inferolateral wall may be slightly
hypokinetic but suboptimal image quality limits certainty. The
right ventricular cavity is dilated. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The number of aortic valve leaflets
cannot be determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat
pad.

IMPRESSION: Symmetric LVH with moderate to severe septal
hypokinesis. The anterior wall is probably hypokinetic but is
not well seen. The RV is dilated and probably hypokinetic but
image quality limits interpretation. No significant valvular
abnormality seen. Large anterior fat pad.


Brief Hospital Course:
64M w/ pmh CAD p/w chest pain, found to have anterior STEMI,
complicated by V-fib arrest s/p defibrillation, now s/p cypher
stent to prox LAD.

# ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction: Cardiac catheterization
revealed a totally occluded RCA with Left to right collaterals,
99% stenosis of proximal LAD, and 40% stenosis of LCx.  He
receiving a cypher stent to his proximal LAD and was admitted to
the CCU.  During catheterization he was hypotensive, requiring a
dopamine drip and an intraaortic balloon pump. He was intubated
prior to arrival at [**Hospital1 18**].  During the catheterization he was
vomiting and concern was raised for aspiration. he was initially
acidotic, with a pH of 7.01 and elevated lactate to 2.9. He was
started on aspirin and plavix and atorvastatin, and his IV
heparin was continued while he was still on the IABP. He
underwent the arctic sun cooling protocol as well. he was also
started on an insulin drip to keep his blood glucose under 180.
Echo on [**2-5**] showed an LVEF of 30% with septal and anterior
hypokinesis.  His RV was also dilated. After several days his
blood pressure stabilized and his dopamine was discontinued on
[**2-6**].  His balloon pump was removed [**2-6**].  He was extubated on
[**2142-2-6**]. He was started on carvedilol and lisinopril, which were
initially held given his hypotension. His carvedilol was
switched to metoprolol and he was found to have better rate
control with metoprolol. His enzymes were trended and found to
peak at CK 2742, troponin 5.15.  Given his septal and anterior
wall hypokinesis, the patient was bridged wit
