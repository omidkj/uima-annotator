Brief Hospital Course:
73 yo female w/ pmhx sig for anxiety and hypertension who p/w
atrial myxoma for removal. Pt had Cardiac Cath on [**2194-3-28**] with
clean coronaries followed by a TEE on [**2194-3-29**] (see pertinent
results). Pt. had dental consult on [**3-30**] secondary to poor
dentition (see consult note). Pt was scheduled for surgery on
[**3-31**], but had to be cancelled due to elevated temperature (101)
and WBC (16.9). Pt started on clindamycin for periodontitis and
cont. on admission ABX. Blood, urine, stool, sputum, and pleural
fluid were obtained for cultures (see lab results). On [**4-1**], pt.
again had increased fever and WBC. ID consulted, dental
extraction recommended but OM FS felt it was unlikely to be
source of infection. Pt. also had neuro consult secondary to
possible Horner's syndrome/CVA due to left eye droop and unequal
pupils. MRI/MRA was negative for acute ischemia and they then
recommenced ophthalmology consult, chest CT, and check ACh-R ab.
On [**4-2**], pt's WBC decreased to 13 (18 yesterday) and was
afebrile, therefore she was brought to the operating room. Pt.
underwent a resection of left atrial myxoma with a Dacron patch
closure of intra atrial septum. Pt. tolerated the procedure well
with a CPB time of 82 minutes and XCT time of 55 minutes. Pt.
was brought to CSRU in stable condition with a HR of 92 A-Paced,
MAP 76, CVP 14, PAD 25, [**Doctor First Name 1052**] 37 and being titrated on Neo and
propofol. Later that day, propofol was weaned, NMB reversed and
pt. became awake. Pt was moving all extremities, following
commands, and then extubated without incidence. He was alert,
awake, and neurologically intact.
POD #1 - Pt. stable, Neo weaned. Chest tubes removed. ABX cont.,
cont. to check cultures, and pt. transferred to telemetry floor.
POD #2 Pt. hemodynamically stable. WBC 12.8. Cont. ABX until ID
further recommendation. Pacing wires removed. Pt. went into
rapid A. Fib (190) overnight and was converted to SR in 80's
following Lopressor and to Amio bolus x 2. Amio drip then
started along with Mg given.
POD #3 - Pt. still in SR (77). Right arm had non-tender palpable
cord. Heat pack applied and check after pack comes off.
POD #4 - Coumadin and heparin started. RUE likely to be
phlebitis.
POD #5 - Vanco started for phlebitis and pt. still receiving 7
day course of Levo/Clinda. Vascular consulted for RUE.
POD #6 - Pt. had pruritis with Vanco. D/C vanco and Benadryl
given. Heparin and Coumadin d/c'd. Pt. hemodynamically stable
and encouraged to get OOB and ambulate.
POD #7 - RUE erythema reducing. Blood cultures obtained today.
VS stable.
POD #[**9-10**] - RUE phlebitis improving/almost resolved. Ace wrap
and warm compress continued. ABX changed to PO prior to D/C on
[**4-12**]. All labs and vs were stable and cultures negative. Pt. was
d/c'd home with VNA services.
