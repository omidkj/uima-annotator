History of Present Illness:
62 yo F h/o CAD s/p CABG x3 ([**2195**]), DESx3 to RCA ([**2199**]), and DES
to RPDL and PDL ([**2-8**]) on [**Month/Year (2) **] + [**Month/Year (2) **], s/p AVR ([**2195**]) on
coumadin, diastolic heart failure p/w substernal chest pain
starting this morning, found to have 11 point HCT drop, guaiac
positive dark stool, and inferior ST changes on EKG.
.
Patient was in her usual state of health until one week ago,
when she noted increased weakness and dyspnea on exertion (no
PND or orthopnea). Three days ago, she woke up around 3:00 AM
with substernal CP consistent with her typical anginal systems.
She took 1 NTG and pain resolved. Yesterday morning, she woke
with the same pain, this time also noticed new weakness and
dyspnea on exertion. She took 2 NTG and 1 [**Year (4 digits) **] 325mg and pain
resolved. This morning, she awoke with severe [**9-7**] substernal
CP radiating to arm and jaw. Pain was unremitting and worsened
greatly on exertion. She also had one dark stool this AM (has
been on iron pills for past week), unsure if tarry or foul
smelling. Endorsed nausea, but no vomiting or hematemesis, no
gross BRBPR. Over course of the AM she took 6 NTG and 4 325mg
[**Month/Year (2) **] pills, with improvement in pain to [**1-8**]. She called her son
who drove her to [**Name (NI) **].
.
In the ED, initial SBP was 88. Vital signs checked subsequently
were Pulse: 102, RR: 20, BP: 134/63, O2Sat: 100% 2L NC (98% RA).
Labs were significant for hematocrit of 18.6 from baseline 29.5.
 INR was 4.6.  White blood cell count was 10.7K.  Potassium was
3.2.  Anion gap was 16. Creatinine was 1.3 and is at baseline.
Troponin was <0.01.   She received IV morphine 5 mg x 1. ECG
showed inferior ST depressions. Cardiology was consulted and
recommended no acute intervention. Patient was going to be
started on IV heparin with bolus, but then rectal exam showed
guaiac positive dark stool. Two PIVs were placed, she was given
pantoprazole 40mg IV x1, 2 units pRBC ordered (not given), and
she was transported to MICU for treatment of suspected UGIB.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient is hemodynamically stable. Her
chest pain is improved since morphine, now [**3-8**]. Denies dyspnea,
nausea, abdominal pain.

[**2208-4-29**] CT abdomen/pelvis w/o contrast: IMPRESSION:  No evidence
of pathology to explain patient's symptoms on this limited
non-contrast CT evaluation.

AP CXR: FINDINGS:  The heart size is mildly enlarged and there
is mild pulmonary vascular re-distribution with perihilar haze
that is worse when compared to the prior study.  There are small
bilateral pleural effusions with increased opacity at both bases
which likely represents volume loss, although early infiltrate
cannot be excluded.  The overall impression is that of CHF.

RUQ U/S: IMPRESSION:  Unremarkable right upper quadrant
ultrasound.

EGD [**2208-5-2**]: Normal mucosa in the esophagus. Food in the stomach.
No stigmata of any recent bleeding in the visualized area of the
stomach
Normal mucosa in the duodenum. Otherwise normal EGD to third
part of the duodenum
Colonoscopy [**2208-5-3**]: Polyps in the sigmoid colon and rectum. (No
biopsies taken).

EGD [**2208-5-3**]: Esophagus: Normal esophagus.
Stomach: Normal stomach.
Duodenum: Normal duodenum

Video capsule study [**2208-5-4**]:
1. Two lymphangiectasias in the middle of small bowel.
2. No active bleeding was seen in the small bowel.
3. Sub-optimal bowel prep in the proximal and distal small bowel


Brief Hospital Course:
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
[ ] INR CHECKS, pt has VNA following and will be checking INR on
[**5-14**] and [**5-15**].
[ ] Isosorbide and Olmesartan held on discharge, will need to be
restarted when pt's BP is improved
[ ] monitor BUN/creatinine
================================

62 yo F h/o CAD s/p CABG x3 ([**2195**]), DESx3 to RCA ([**2199**]), and DES
to RPDL and PDL ([**2-8**]) on [**Month/Year (2) **] + [**Month/Year (2) **], s/p AVR ([**2195**]) on
coumadin, diastolic heart failure p/w substernal chest pain
starting this morning, found to have 11 point HCT drop, guaiac
positive dark stool, and inferior ST changes on EKG. Her
supratherapeutic INR of 4.2 was reversed with FFP and she was
given 6 units of pRBCs total during this hospitalization. No
source of bleeding was found but patient's HCT was stabilized so
her coumadin was restarted. She was discharged when her coumadin
was therapeutic.

# ACUTE ON CHRONIC ANEMIA FROM BLOOD LOSS: On admission, patient
reported one week of increased weakness and DOE, and increasing
chest pain (anginal equivalent)
