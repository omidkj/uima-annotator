Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 984-year-old
male who presented to [**Hospital1 69**] on
[**2108-2-12**], status post a fall.  He reported a decreased
stability over the past 10 months.  A magnetic resonance
imaging showed a large mass behind his odontoid compressing
C1 and C2.  He received surgery for an anterior cervical
decompression on [**2108-3-12**].  The mass was found to be
from pseudogout.

He was transferred to the Medicine Service on [**2108-3-20**]
for management of respiratory difficulties.  He was suspected
to have pneumonia (possibly from aspiration).  He was started
on ceftazidime, vancomycin, and Flagyl.  He was also started
on ciprofloxacin to double cover for pseudomonas.

On the afternoon of [**2108-3-23**], he was found to be in his
room unresponsive and pulseless.  Cardiopulmonary
resuscitation was started, during which he received 3 amps of
atropine, 3 of epinephrine, and 2 of bicarbonate.  He was
intubated.  He had pulseless electrical activity for 15
minutes during the code before regaining his pulse.  He was
intubated.  He was started on dopamine for hypotension.

He was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for
further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Gout.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Coronary artery disease (100% left anterior descending
artery lesion).
4.  Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction
of 20%.
5.  Status post myocardial infarction in [**2085**].
6.  Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine
of 1.9 to 2.3.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  After the patient was transferred to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit he continued to require
ventilator support and also to require blood pressure support
with dopamine.

The etiology of his pulseless electrical activity was
unclear; although, this could have been from a combination of
his poor baseline cardiac status, possible hypoxia from
pneumonia, as well as possible hypovolemia/sepsis from his
pneumonia.  In addition, he had chronic pain and was on high
doses of pain medications which could also have contributed
to the pulseless electrical activity.

After arriving in the Medical Intensive Care Unit he failed
to regain consciousness.  He was not responsive to verbal or
to painful stimuli.  He was evaluated by his neurosurgeon,
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1338**], who concurred that the patient's prognosis for
recovery would be extremely poor.

Given these circumstances, the family opted to withdraw care.
The pressor dopamine was stopped on [**2108-3-25**], and the
patient subsequently expired at 8:43 p.m.

CAUSE OF DEATH:  Immediate cause of death was coronary artery
disease and congestive heart failure.
