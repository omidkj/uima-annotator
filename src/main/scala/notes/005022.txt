Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4654**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p cardiac arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubated

History of Present Illness:
66M with PMH notable for DM2, AVRx2, tracheobronchomalacia s/p
tracheal Y stenting earlier this year presents with witnessed
PEA arrest at friend's workplace. Per family, friend reported
that patient "appeared to be asleep." This did not immediately
raise concern because the patient falls asleep frequently during
the day, even in social situations. His wife notes that he was
more somnolent than usual this morning; he had a hard time
getting out of bed. He went to breakfast with friends as per his
usual routine, and he actually fell asleep at the restaurant as
well. Once he slumped forward EMS was called. He was down for
approximately four minutes prior to initiation of CPR.
Apparently, his initial rhythm on EMS arrival was PEA, and he
received 1 mg epinephrine and 1 mg atropine. He also received
300 mg amiodarone but it is unclear whether this was given first
or subsequent to other medications. On tracings from EMS,
appears that patient is intermittently paced which is wide
complex and this may have been mistaken for VT. Reportedly, he
had return of pulses after 6 minutes of CPR. Two IVs were placed
and the patient was intubated in the field. Unfortunately, the
actual EMS documentation is no longer with his chart. He was
initially cooled in the field by report. [**Hospital **]hospital EKG also
concerning for inferior STEMI, but on my review, this appears
only on paced beats with ST elevations in II and III and ST
depressions in I.
.
On arrival to the ED, the patient's initial vitals were T 95.1,
HR 60 (paced), BP 80/40, O2 100%. Blood pressures decreased to
the 60s; cooling was stopped. Right femoral CVL was placed for
IV access. He was placed on dopamine gtt with persistent
hypotension and levophed was added. FAST exam was negative. He
also required epinephrine gtt to maintain blood pressures in the
90s systolic. CT head/neck/chest/abdomen/pelvis revealed
bilateral lower lobe infiltrates concerning for aspiration
versus pneumonia. He received IV ceftriaxone 1 g X 1 (but not
vancomycin which was also ordered in the ED). A left radial
arterial line as placed. On CT scan, his ETT was noted to be
anterior to his tracheal stent. IP and anesthesia/critial care
were called to the bedside where bronchoscopy was used to
reposition the tube; the ETT is now located within the stent
about 2.5 cm above the carina. Cardiology was consulted from the
ED; they did not feel that his presentation was consistent with
acute STEMI. ECHO performed at the bedside showed preserved EF
(> 55%) with no regional wall motion abnormalities.
.
On arrival to the ICU, the patient is not sedated but is
intubated and unresponsive to voice and painful. On further
questioning, the patient's wife notes that the patient has had a
cough productive of sputum for the past few months; he has been
treated intermittently with antibiotics for this. She reports no
recent fevers at home. The patient did not have any other
particular complaints in the past few days. As above, he was
more somnolent on the morning of this incident. Overall, the
patient's family admits that they know little about his medical
history because the patient did not share his medical problems.
The most recent medication list that the patient's wife can find
is from 9/[**2175**].
