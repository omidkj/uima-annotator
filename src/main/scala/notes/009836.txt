This is a re-dictation of a discharge summary in a somewhat
delayed fashion following nothing able to be located.  Mr.
[**Known lastname 9449**] was a 78-year-old gentleman status post extended
right colectomy on early [**Month (only) 956**] with an ileum to left colon
anastomosis at an outside hospital.  There, postoperatively
he developed a troponin leak and acute renal insufficiency
which was thought to be prerenal and atrial fibrillation.  He
then was transferred at the request of the surgeon there with
an essentially an acute abdomen, respiratory at failure
requiring urgent intubation.  After initial stabilization and
resuscitation, and evaluation in the ICU, he was taken to the
OR for exploratory laparotomy with a leak at the ileocolonic
anastomosis was identified and feculent peritonitis.  He
underwent resection of the anastomosis with an end ileostomy
and [**Last Name (un) **] gastrostomy.  The placement of a G-tube additionally
.
Subsequent to that, he had a long course with many issues
with wound care requiring ultimately complicated vac and a
variety of pouches, multiple debridements of the wound care.
With retention sutures in place, the wound was more difficult
to manage and he did develop skin erosions as well during
this time.  Postoperatively, he also developed a leak from
his G-tube site requiring with leaking from the JP requiring
a long period of being n.p.o.  He was on TPN.  He had a
prolonged ICU stay with intubation because of his risk for
respiratory status.  He was ultimately extubated from that
but continued to be not mentating at his preoperative level.
He then in early [**Month (only) 547**] developed acute arterial ischemia of
the right lower extremity and required a right femoral
embolectomy and repair of the right common femoral artery by
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1391**] and following that, he required continued
intubation and because of his long course, family discussions
were held in which he was ultimately made a CMO on [**2143-5-8**] and he expired on [**2153-5-8**] at 3:50 p.m. as noted
already on the Fulmar chart.  His family was appropriately
notified.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Expired.
