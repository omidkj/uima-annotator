CXR [**6-16**]:  FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**5-17**], there is
little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs. There
are some bilateral areas of opacification most likely
representing atelectasis. In the appropriate clinical setting,
the possibility of pneumonia would have to be considered.
Continued mild cardiomegaly. The port-A-Cath remains in place.
Definite
vascular congestion. Central catheter.
.
EKG [**6-25**]: Sinus tachycardia. Non-specific ST-T wave
abnormalities. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2197-6-2**] heart
rate has increased and Q-T interval prolongation is no longer
seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 61 year old male with PMH of SCC of the pryiform sinus
s/p C2 of TPF (taxotere, cisplatin, 5-FU) on [**5-30**] presenting
with cough and confusion and found to have a possible RLL PNA on
imaging, worsening of his known chronic SIADH hyponatremia, and
anemia with a Hct=19.8.
.
# Pyriform sinus squamous cell carcinoma: # Stage [**Doctor First Name 690**] squamous
cell carcinoma of the right piriform sinus: S/p Cycle 2 of TPF
(taxotere, cisplatin, 5-FU) on [**5-30**]. Due to patient's
hyponatremia, confusion and generally complex medical condition,
he stayed in-house for his third cycle of TPF once his cough,
confusion and anemia had improved. He required special
preparations of his 5-FU with normal saline, not D5W given his
hyponatremia. Discontinued dexamethasone 2 days early given
steroid psychosis. He completed the cycle with no significant
complications, although he did have some emotional lability with
the steroids. The patient was discharged with antibiotic
prophylaxis (Cipro) as well as Emend.
.
# Anemia: His hematocrit was down to 19.8 on [**6-16**] from 31.9 on
[**6-13**].  He reports 2 days of BRBPR.  He may have GI oozing
secondary to mucositis or underlying diverticulosis which may be
amplified by aggressive fluid repletion.  His hematocrit was
trended closely and he received 2 unit of pRBCs.
.
# Hyponatremia: The patient has a long history of hyponatremia
which has been extensively evaluated by renal and found to be
consistent with SIADH with unclear underlying cause, possibly
due to his malignancy and worsened in the past (and this
admission) with chemotherapy session. Cisplatinum chemo is also
known to worsen hyponatremia and therefore the patient has been
repeatedly admitted for hyponatremia. During his last admission,
he was treated with lasix, salt tabs, and fluid restriction. On
admission his sodium was 119 and he was last discharged with a
Na=120.  He was once again treated with Lasix, salt tabs, and
fluid restriction (although patient occasionally found drinking
fluids in the nutrition room with que
