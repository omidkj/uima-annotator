Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5827**]
Chief Complaint:
lethargy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
R PICC placement

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]M with h/o CRI, CAD, dementia, presented to the ED from
[**Hospital3 2558**] with 1 day of lethargy. Labs showed BUN/Cr 67/2.3
and glucose 748. WBC was 21.5 [**4-1**], down to 13.3 on day of
admission. CXR was read as negative, but he was given
levofloxacin at the NH for empiric treatment of pneumonia. He
was brought to the ED for further evaluation given his lab
abnormalities and altered mental status.

In the ED, VS were T 99 (rectal), HR 81, BP 105/63, RR 21, O2sat
95% 10L, FSBG critically high. CXR showed bibasilar infiltrates,
UA dirty. CT head with only chronic microvascular changes. He
was given Humalog 7U IV, then started on an insulin gtt. He was
also given vancomycin 1g IV and Flagyl 500mg IV. He was
transferred to the MICU for further management.

EKG: NSR 73, RBBB, LAFB, PRWP.
.
CT Head [**2186-4-2**] 7:16 PM:
1. No hemorrhage or mass effect.
2. Moderate-to-severe chronic periventricular white matter
hypodensities consistent with chronic microvascular ischemia.
3. Chronic lacunar infarcts.
4. Air-fluid level in the right maxillary and left sphenoid
sinuses
consistent with acute sinusitis.
MRI with diffusion-weighted images is more sensitive in the
detection of acute infarction.
.
CXR [**2186-4-2**] 7:00 PM: Cardiomegaly. Probable COPD and pulmonary
hypertension. Increased retrocardiac density - - question
collapse and/or consolidation versus hiatal hernia. Patchy
opacity right mid zone - - question scarring versus infiltrate.

Compared with [**2184-5-19**], the right cardiophrenic opacity is new
and therefore more likely to represent an infectious infiltrate
or aspiration. The degree of retrocardiac opacity is also worse.
At least, part of this may relate to a tortuous aorta.
Imaging:
CXR [**2186-4-4**] 2:52 PM: Persistent atelectasis and/or
consolidation left lung base. Possible subtle parenchymal
infiltrate in right lower lung.
.
Video Speech and Swallow Evaluation [**2186-4-7**]:
Pt demonstrates a mild oropharyngeal dysphagia characterized by
reduced bolus formation and control, prolonged mastication of
all
textures, mild swallow initiation delay, and reduced valve
closure.  Pt appreciated to aspirate cup sips, but straw sips of
thin liquid were safe for PO intake.  As such, I recommend the
pt's PO diet include thin liquids, pureed solids, and PO meds
crushed in puree.  Pt will require 1:1 assistance with meals to
maintain aspiration precautions as listed below.  Please
reconsult if pt's performance improves such that upgrade to
regular solids might be reasonable and a repeat swallow
evaluation can be completed at that time.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. PO diet: thin liquids, pureed solids, PO meds crushed in
puree.
2. 1:1 assistance with meals to maintain aspiration precautions
including:
   a) Pt MUST use straws for thin liquids
   b) Pt should only take one sip at a time from straw
3. Please reconsult if pt's performance improves such that
upgrade to regular solids might be reasonable and a repeat
swallow evaluation can be completed at that time.



Brief Hospital Course:
He received 2L NS. He temporarily required NRB, but was quickly
weaned down to 6LNC. His EKG was thought to have slight changes
in the STE V1-V3 and troponin was slightly elevated at 0.08--
Cardiology reviewed his EKG and felt there was no significant
change.


On arrival to MICU required NRB, but titrated to 6LNC. In the
MICU, treated w/ vanco/levo/flagyl, given insulin gtt and fluid
resuscitated. Ultimately, sodium was brought to 140s over the
course of five days, pt completed 5d of antibiotics (planned
course of ten, vanco discontinued), converted to SC insulin
regimen, and felt stable for transfer to floor.


Per signout from MICU team, major new issue has been an issue of
aspiration. Although pt apparently passed bedside swallow w/
nectar thickened, pt has continued to have evidence of
aspiration while eating/drinking/meds. MICU team therefore
recommended video swallow eval.

ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
[**Age over 90 **]M with h/o CRI, CAD, dementia, initially admitted to MICU for
HONC (FSBS 700s), severe hypernatremia (174), UTI and PNA
treated w/ vanco/levo/flagyl.  Commpleting a 10 day course of
levo/flagyl.  Hypernatremia resolved, blood glucose in better
control and transitioned to subq heparin.
.
# SEPSIS: The patient presented from NH with elevated WBC and
dirty U/A and started on levoquin.  He received 2L NS. He
temporarily required NRB, but was quickly weaned down to 6LNC.
He was continued on levofloxacin and started on vancomycin and
flagyl.  All of his cultures here have been negatiave, although
he was started on antibiotics prior to his arrival.  Vancomycin
was discontinued after a 5 day course as urine and blood
cultures were negative.  Plan for levofloxacin and flagyl to be
continued to complete a 10 day course.  At the time of
discharge, he is afebrile, hemodynamically stable and breathing
without O2 supplementation.
.
# HYPERNATREMIA/ELECTROLYTES: Appeared to have nongap acidosis,
probably initially related to dehydration and later attributed
to NS given for fluid rescuscitation. Fluids were changed to
slow fluids w/ LR instead.  By the time of discharge, his sodium
level was within normal limits.
.
# ASPIRATION: There was evidence of clinical aspiration. A video
swallow examination was perfromed and showed that the patient is
able to take thin liquids with a straw and pureed food with 1:1
meal assist.  After discussion with the family and nutrition,
will hold off on PEG placement and reevaluate in nursing home.
Will continue 1:1 assist diet per nutrtion recs.
.
# CHF: Systolic CHF with EF 25% and grossly volume overloaded by
exam plus O2 requirement likely [**3-10**] fluid administration for
sepsis.  He responded well to diuresis and by the end of his
hosptial course, no longer had an O2 requirement.
.
# DM: The patient presented with elevated blood glucose in the
700s, he was initially started on an insulin drip and
transitioned to insulin subq.  He did not previously have a
diagnosis of diabetes, but on review of CCC shows multiple
hyperglycemic episodes while here, so probably undiagnosed DM.
Hgb A1C at admission 8.3  He will be discharged on his inpatient
insulin regimen and will need to follow up with his primary care
for further management.
.
# CAD:
- started on ASA and metoprolol
.
# DEMENTIA: As above, Aricept and namenda were initially hel
