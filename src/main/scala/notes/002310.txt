History of Present Illness:
79 year old Female who presents with femoral trochanteric
fracture after sustaining a fall in the bathroom. She states she
was cleaning her bathroom when she is unsure exactly what
happened, but she fell after getting her walker. Her husband
found her, and believes she fell over a cleaning bottle with her
walker. The patient denies fainting or loss of consciousness.

Her husband called EMS where plain film [**Name (NI) 108380**] revealed left
intertrochanteric femur fracture. Ortho-Trauma was consulted and
recommended operative repair. In addition, cervical spine films
were concerning for cervical vertebral subluxation, so the
patient was placed in a Cervical Hard-Collar pending orthospine
clearance.

Of note the patient was recently admitted here at [**Hospital1 18**] for
workup of cryptogenic cirrhosis with a significant variceal
bleed, requiring ICU admission with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2125-5-28**] 1:37 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute fracture or prevertebral soft tissue swelling.
2. Anterolisthesis at C6-C7 is of unknown chronicity in the lack
of prior
comparisons, though likely degenerative given presence of
additional extensive degenerative change. If there is high
concern for ligamentous injury, an MRI may be performed for
further characterization.
3. Extensive cervical spondylosis, as described above, causing
multilevel
neural foraminal narrowing and moderate canal stenosis from C3
through C5,
which predisposes the patient to cord injury. MRI should be
considered for
further evaluation of cord injury if clinically indicated.
4. Right pleural effusion.


CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2125-5-28**] 1:37 PM
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
Final Attending Comment:
There is a small hyperdense focus( 2:13) in the right frontal
lobe which could represent a small acute bleed versus
calcification.There is no significant edema. Findings conveyed
to the clinical team.


KNEE (AP, LAT & OBLIQUE) LEFT Study Date of [**2125-5-28**] 2:12 PM
Intertrochanteric fracture of left proximal femur. Findings
conveyed to the referring physician via [**Name9 (PRE) **].


HIP (UNILAT 2 VIEW) W/PELVIS (1 VIEW) Study Date of [**2125-5-28**]
2:12 PM
IMPRESSION:
Intertrochanteric fracture of left proximal femur. Findings
conveyed to the referring physician via [**Name9 (PRE) **].


CHEST (PRE-OP AP ONLY) Study Date of [**2125-5-28**] 2:12 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Significant interval decrease in right-sided pleural effusion
which is now small. No left pleural effusion.
2. Lucency at the right lung base may be related to loculated
fluid, however, basilar pneumothorax cannot be excluded.
Recommend followup radiograph for further evaluation.
3. Stable cardiomegaly and prominent main pulmonary artery
suggestive of
pulmonary hypertension.


CHEST (SINGLE VIEW) Study Date of [**2125-5-28**] 6:42 PM
FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the
degree of
blunting of the right costophrenic angle consistent with a small
right
effusion is unchanged. Lucency at the right lung base again is
suggestive of basilar pneumothorax. Progressive followup of this
area is again suggested. Stable cardiomegaly with prominence of
the central pulmonary arteries consistent with pulmonary
arterial hypertension. Central catheter position is unchanged.



Brief Hospital Course:
1. Intratrochanteric Femoral Fracture due to Fall in Bathroom
 Patient was evaluated by orthopedics in the ED and was
scheduled for femur repair in OR. She was dialyzed first then
sent to the OR. She underwent successful repair of her femur and
post-op had a short stay in the ICU for hypotension but then was
transferred to the floor without further complications. Patient
required DVT prophylaxis after surgery however she was unable to
receive heparin products given her history of HIT and could not
be on fondaparinux given her renal disease so was started on
argatroban gtt and bridged to coumadin. she should continued
coumadin for ONLY ONE MONTH and then it should be discontinued.
Given her increased risk of GIB and fall risk coumadin is not a
good long term drug for her.

2. PREOPERATIVE CARDIAC ASSESSMENT : Patient was deemed to be at
moderate risk by ESRD, CHF (Diastolic) which is compensated,
Diabetes, Atrial Fibrillation for a intermediate risk procedure
(ORIF). Patient was already beta-blocked with Nadolol. Patient
is a type 2 diabetic, so could be off insulin during operation,
however good glucose control post-operative was important for
wound healing. Patient has a history of COPD, so used a
prolonged I:E ratio to prevent air trapping.

3. Chronic Diastolic CHF - Chronic. Remain
