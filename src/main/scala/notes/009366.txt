Admission Date:  [**2143-5-7**]       Discharge Date:  [**2143-5-13**]

Date of Birth:   [**2077-3-6**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Near syncope.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 66-year-old female
with multiple medical problems who was brought to the
Emergency Room after complaining of fatigue and slumping over
in the chair, although reportedly not losing consciousness
per her family.

She was last dialyzed on Saturday, and upon reaching the
Emergency Room, the patient was found to be in wide complex
bradycardia without discernable P-waves, question of complete
heart block with an increased potassium.  She was treated
with Glucagon Insulin, D50, Bicarbonate, Atropine, and
Calcium Gluconate.

At the time of initial presentation, her heart rate was in
the 30s with a blood pressure of 70/30.  After treatment, she
returned to narrow complex atrial rhythm at a rate of 50.
Her blood pressure remained low.  Chest x-ray showed
congestive heart failure.  Dopamine was started.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Coronary artery disease status
post coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2132**] with LIMA to
left anterior descending and saphenous vein graft to
posterior descending artery.  She is also status post
catheterization with a stent to the left circumflex in [**2135**],
and is status post catheterization in [**2140**] showing patent
grafts.  Most recent cardiac catheterization in [**2143-3-28**]
showed elevated right and left-sided filling pressures with
prominent V-wave and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure
tracing, preserved cardiac output, left main coronary artery
with a 95% hazy lesion extending into the proximal left
circumflex.  It also showed secondary pulmonary hypertension,
hemiballismus.  2.  History of ventricular tachycardia for
which Amiodarone was started.  3.  Left ventricular thrombus.
4.  Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of
25-30% which was recently decreased to 15%.  Question of
apical akinesis as well.  5.  Hypertension.  6.
Hyperlipidemia.  7.  Severe mitral regurgitation.  8.
End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis times two months.
She is dialyzed Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.  9.  History
of cerebrovascular accident with questionable residual right
upper extremity weakness in the presence of hemiballismus in
the acute setting.  Reportedly the cerebrovascular accident
is a 3 cm left parietal infarction.  10.  Chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease.  11.  Diabetes mellitus, dependent on
Insulin.  12.  Meniere's disease.  13.  Osteoarthritis.

ALLERGIES:  ASPIRIN, CAPTOPRIL; THE PATIENT CANNOT REMEMBER
HER REACTIONS TO THESE MEDICATIONS.  MORPHINE SULFATE
REPORTEDLY CAUSES ANAPHYLAXIS.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She has a 60 pack-year of tobacco; the
patient has quit.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  On admission temperature
was 97.1??????, blood pressure 93/48, respirations 17, pulse 64,
oxygen saturation 97% on 2 L nasal cannula.  General:  The
patient was somnolent but arousable, barely coherent.
Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate and rhythm.  Barely audible
heart sounds.  No peripheral edema.  Positive jugular venous
distention.  Pulmonary:  Lungs coarse with diffuse rales.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.  Neurological:  No
focal or neurological deficits.  Somnolent but arousable.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 10.1, hematocrit
33.8, platelet count 258; INR 2.8; potassium 5.0, this
potassium was obtained after treatment for a hemolyzed
potassium of 7.9, creatinine 10.1, BUN 66, glucose 194,
magnesium 2.7, calcium 9.2, sodium 135, CK 42, MB not
applicable.

Electrocardiogram showed non-sinus atrial rhythm.

Chest x-ray showed congestive heart failure with bilateral
effusions.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Arrhythmia:  His bradycardia and
hypertension was attributed to a combination of Amiodarone
and beta-blocker used in the setting of end-stage renal
disease with hyperkalemia.  Withholding of Amiodarone and
beta-blocker together with treatment of hyperkalemia and
dialysis allowed the patient to return to normal sinus
rhythm.
Dopamine was initially required to maintain a heart rate
greater than 50 and to maintain an adequate blood pressure.
It should be noted that the patient has had in the recent
past a subclavian to subclavian graft constructed in her left
upper pectoral/anterior deltoid region.  This anatomy results
in a falsely low blood pressure in the left arm, both by
manual cuff and by arterial line.  Manual blood pressure
taken on the right arm is consistently about 20 points
systolic higher than a blood pressure taken on the left and
correlates better with clinical status.  It is recommended
that in the future, the right arm be used for blood pressure
readings.

After return of heart rhythm to normal sinus at a normal
rate, the patient still required Dopamine for blood pressure
support.  It is unclear how much of this blood pressure
support was necessary given that the story behind the blood
pressure discrepancy had not yet been discovered, and the
patient was likely in early sepsis, as described below.

After a couple of days of antibiotics and monitoring of her
blood pressure in the right arm, the patient was able to be
weaned off Dopamine without problem.  Amiodarone and
beta-blocker were held throughout the hospitalization, and
she remained in sinus rhythm at a normal rate for the rest of
the duration of the hospitalization.

2.  Fluid status:  The patient is essentially aneuric.  She
became hypoxic on the morning after admission secondary to
pulmonary edema failure.  She was briefly intubated, both for
airway protection and to provide adequate oxygenation until
she can be dialyzed.  After dialysis, she was weaned to
pressure support and extubated.  She was continued on
hemodialysis while in-house every other day with removal of
2.0-2.5 L of fluid by ultrafiltrate at each dialysis session.

She was followed by Nephrology while in-house and was
continued on Nephrocaps while her Remegel was increased to
t.i.d. with meals, and she was also started on PhosLo.  She
was also eventually placed on a 2 g sodium diet with a 1500
cc/day fluid restriction.  She did have one other episode
prior to her dialysis on [**2143-5-11**], where she became very
dyspneic just prior to her dialysis.  Dialysis with removal
of fluid allowed for complete resolution of these symptoms.

3.  Sepsis:  After the patient was able to maintain herself
in sinus rhythm at a normal rate, she required Dopamine for
blood pressure support as indicated above.  During this time,
she spiked a temperature to 104?????? and developed a leukocytosis
to 18.  She was empirically started on Vancomycin and
Levaquin, both dosed renally.

After about five days, her Vancomycin was discontinued, and
she was continued on Levaquin.  There was marked clinical
improvement after 48 hours on antibiotics.  A respiratory
source was suspected, as blood cultures remained negative,
urine cultures remained negative, and one respiratory culture
showed rare growth of ..................  She will be
continued on renally dosed Levaquin through [**2143-5-18**], to
complete a 10-day course.

4.  Anticoagulation:  The patient is maintained on Coumadin
as an outpatient for her left ventricular thrombus.  When
started on Levaquin, her INR became supratherapeutic.  Her
Coumadin was intermittently held to allow return of her INR
to a therapeutic range.

On the day of discharge after holding her Coumadin for two
out of the three previous nights, her INR was still 4.1.  She
is following up in two days with her primary care physician.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] Coumadin will be held at discharge, an
