Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
CHIEF COMPLAINT: OSH transfer for gram positive bacteremia

REASON FOR CCU ADMISSION: NSTEMI with persistent chest pain
despite nitro gtt


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
status post transesophageal echocardiogram
cardiac catheterization with 5 drug eluting stents to the left
circumflex artery


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 64793**] is a 61 y/o man with a history of CAD, s/p CABG and
AVR x 2 (details below) and on coumadin. In [**2139-1-22**] he
was in [**Country 32814**] racing speed boats and had a syncopal episode.
He was transferred to [**Location (un) 2848**] where he was diagnosed with severe
AS and was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 112**] where he underwent
AVR and CABG x2 (SVG to OM, SVG to RCA, 25 mm CE pericardial
valve). He underwent redo AVR/CABG at [**Hospital1 18**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
(St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] 21 mm mechanical AVR, SVG to PDA) in [**2147**] due to
cardiac cath showing occluded SVG to RCA, EF 51%, [**Location (un) 109**] 0.4 cm2,
peak AV gradient 70, LAD 20%, CX 50%, distal RCA 80%.

He initially presented to [**Location (un) 11248**] on [**2151-5-4**] with fevers
followed by chills and rigors. He thought he had the flu. Of
note, he had 2 rigorous dental cleanings about three weeks ago
without Abx coverage. On admission there, his WBC was 16 and his
INR was 4.6. U/A and Ucx were negative. Blood cx was positive
for gram positive cocci in chains and clusters, which turned out
to be penicillin sensitive strep viridans.

On the [**Hospital1 1516**] service, the patient underwent treatment with
penicillin and gentamicin. The patient underwent 2 TEEs which
were negative for any significant vegetation or abscess. The
aortic valve also looked normal. The patient's blood and urine
cultures remained negative, as did a c diff toxin. The patient
underwent a CT head which was negative for any evidence of
embolic disease, however, on a CT abdomen/pelvis he was noted to
have a splenic infarction. CT surgery evaluated the patient and
felt that there was no need for surgery at this time. On
[**2151-5-12**], the patient developed substernal chest pain that
radiated to the left arm and shoulder along with significant
diaphoresis. The EKG revealed ST elevations in aVR and ST
depressions in the precordial and lateral leads, along with STD
in I and aVL. The pain was refractory to nitro gtt and therefore
was admitted to the CCU for pain management and further
monitoring.

In the CCU, the patient claims his pain is only [**1-31**] after nitro
gtt and morphine. The patient is also complaining of
simultaneous acute on chronic back.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
He denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
black stools or red stools. He denies current fevers, chills or
rigors. All of the other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope. He also denies exertional
angina or prior MI.

Pertinent Results:
REPORTS:

ECHO [**2151-5-6**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in
the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta. A mechanical
aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis
leaflets appear to move normally. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
[The amount of regurgitation present is normal for this
prosthetic aortic valve.] The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. An eccentric, anteriorly
directed jet of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

IMPRESSION: No vegetations seen. Normal appearing mechanical
aortic valve. Moderate eccentric, anteriorly directed mitral
regurgitation.

CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS [**2151-5-15**]:
1. No evidence of abscess.
2. Area of hypoenhancement within the spleen, concerning for
splenic infarct.
3. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.

CTA HEAD [**2151-5-8**]
CONCLUSION: Normal study. No evidence of hemorrhage, infarction,
or
aneurysm.

ECHO [**2151-5-12**]:
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the aortic arch and descending thoracic
aorta to 40 centimeters from the incisors. The aortic valve
prosthesis leaflets appear to move normally. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic valve
abscess is seen. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is
seen on the mitral valve. An eccentric jet of mild to moderate
([**1-23**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a small echodensity
measuring approximately 0.2 cm x 0.6 cm on the tricuspid valve
that is likely consistent with thickened/torn chordae, but
cannot rule out vegetation. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Preserved left ventricular systolic function. Normal
functioning mechanical aortic valve without evidence of
vegetation or abscess. Small echodensity on the tricuspid valve,
likely thickened chordal structure, but cannot exclude
vegetation.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2151-5-6**],
the tricuspid valve echodensity is better visualized on the
current study (was probably prsent on the prior). All other
findings are similar.

[**2151-5-24**]: CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION

1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated
three vessel disease. The LMCA had diffuse 50% stenosis. The LAD
had
mild diffuse disease with moderate disease in the 1st diagonal
branch.
The LCx was occluded as was the ramus intermedius. The RCA had
serial
70% stenoses.
2.  Arterial conduit angiography demonstrated occluded SVG-OM
and
SVG-RCA grafts. The LIMA and RIMA as well as both subclavian
arteries
were patent and without stenoses.
3.  Successful PCI of the native LCx into the OM1 branch with a
