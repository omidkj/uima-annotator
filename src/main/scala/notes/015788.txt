Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 84 y/o M with PMH of CAD (MI [**1-3**] and [**3-4**])
transferred from rehab for chest pain starting this AM. He notes
that the pain started this AM but denies any associated sx.  He
notes that he has not eaten or drank well for some time.
Upon presentation to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, he was noted to have EKG
w/TWI in V2-V5 in the ED and was hypotensive to 70's/50s in the
ED which was responsive to fluid. Through the ED resident's
discussion with the HCP, the plan was for conservative
management of pt's sx.  They did not want cardiac
catheterization. However, they did feel that if pt's hypotension
required pressors or central line, they would be agreeable.
Thus, he was transferred to the CCU.
He was afebrile sating well on RA, his CP resolved w/heparin IV.

Pertinent Results:
MEDICAL DECISION MAKING
EKG demonstrated new TWI in V3-V5 compared with prior dated
[**2147-3-11**]
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2147-3-9**] demonstrated: A moderate
sized apical thrombus in LV. The clot is mural and not mobile.
LV systolic function appears moderately-to-severely depressed
(ejection fraction 30 percent) secondary to akinesis of the
anterior septum and anterior free wall, with extensive apical
dyskinesis. RV WNL. Mild mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) MR.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired
relaxation.
.
CXR: No acute intrathoracic pathology is noted however the study
is
moderately limited due to patient rotation to the right side.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 84 yo man with PMH of CAD (MI [**1-3**] and [**3-4**]) admitted with
c/o chest pain in the setting of two recent anterior MI s/p PCI
to LAD and recent medical management.
.
#. CAD - Pt s/p PCI with BMS to mid and distal LAD [**1-3**] and
recent anterior STEMI which was managed medically. Pt is CP free
after IV hydration and improved BPs.  Initially with TWI in
V2-V5, trops at BL 0.14, CK-MBs negative.  For medical
management of this event (which was not felt to represent
recurrent ACS given low-grade and flat elevations of troponin
alone) he was continued on ASA, statin, and plavix initially,
though plavix was discontinued during his stay for 4 days in
preparation for Gtube placement on [**2147-3-29**].  This was restarted
after his procedure.  Metoprolol was held as patient was
hypotensive and bradycardic to high-40s even while awake.  He
should follow-up as an outpatient for possible reinitiation of
bblocker.
.
#. Pump - TTE [**3-4**] - EF 30% secondary to akinesis of the
anterior septum and anterior free wall, with extensive apical
dyskinesis consistent with known CAD. His Ace-I was held because
of relative hypotension. [**Name2 (NI) **] should follow-up as outpatient for
possible reinitiation of ace-I.
.
#. Rhythm - h/o atrial fibrillation but in NSR during his stay.
Bblocker was continued as above.
.
#. Hypotension - hypotension improved with IVFs and was thought
to be due to chronic poor PO intake and volume depletion.  There
was no evidence of infection.  This likely represented volume
depletion as pt has very poor PO intake.  Discussed recent
speech and swallow evaluation with speech pathologist at [**Hospital **]
rehab which showed patient aspirated all consistencies (but did
best with honey-consistency).  Risks and benefits of enteral
feeding discussed with patient who felt that gastric feeding was
the only Gastric tube was placed by surgery given patient'
.
#. Leukopenia w/relative lymphocytosis and Thrombocytosis -
currently improved
.
#. Anemia - near baseline HCT of 31
.
#. Ulcerative Colitis - continued outpatient regimen
.
#. Severe Malnutrition: aspiration precautions for h/o
dysphagia, spoke with rehab where he had S&S which showed
aspiration of all liquids.  Continue honey-thickened liquids,
pureed diet.  pt. currently favoring G-tube as longer-term
solution to poor nutrition an PO.  spoke with HCP sister as well
sa [**Hospital **] who agree.  GI on board for outpatient gtube
placement.  Plavix held in preparation, will need to be
restarted after procedure.  He was given d51/2NS for calories
during his stay and should continue getting that until he can be
fed enterally.
.
#. Prophylaxis: heparin SC, PPI, bowel regimen
.
#. Code: DNR/DNI
