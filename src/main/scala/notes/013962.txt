Service: NEUROSURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**]
Chief Complaint:
Left sided chronic loculated subdural hematoma with significant
mass effect, and right sided acute and chronic septal hematoma
with mass
effect.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left sided bur hole evacuation of left sided chronic subdural
hematoma, membrane lysis, evacuation of cystic fluid, and right
sided bur hole evacuation of acute and chronic subdural
hematoma.


History of Present Illness:
86yoM with h/o Anemia, Afib off anticoagulation, CAD, bi
ventricular CHF (EF 30%), hypothyroidism, transferred from
nursing facility.  Patient was admitted in [**12/2193**] with
decompensated heart failure, and again in [**1-/2194**] with a low
hematocrit.  He has been worked up for hematocrit (presumed GI
bleed)however
colonscopy did not find a source.  He had required near weekly
transfusions, now stable on procrit.  His family reports a fall
approximately 3 weeks ago while on Coumadin.  The coumadin has
subsequently stopped the coumadin due to low crits and fall
risk.  Approximately 1 week ago he was noted to have near
complete paralysis of his RUE and dragging right leg. His family
has noted that it has improved over the last week to the point
where he can lift his right arm now.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2194-3-14**] for bilateral
subdural hematomas.  A CT of his head from that date confirmed
the presence of large bilateral subdural hematomas, with chronic
and acute components.  A carotid ultrasound deomnstrated less
than 40% bilateral carotid stenosis.  A medicine consult was
obtained on HD 2 because of his significant comorbidities.  They
declared him at is at low-moderate risk of developing
cardiovascular complications during his anticipated surgery and
recommended continuing current care.  The following day, the
patient underwent a left sided bur hole evacuation of left sided
chronic subdural hematoma, membrane lysis, evacuation of cystic
fluid.  In addition, he also had a right sided bur hole
evacuation of acute and chronic subdural hematoma.  The
operation was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and it went well with no
complictions (please see operative note for details).  A
post-operative CT demonstrated stable appearance of bilateral
subdural hematomas with chronic and acute components causing
flattening of both cerebral hemispheres. It also showed interval
development of moderate pneumocephalus, most prominently seen at
the frontal lobes with increasing mass effect.  After reviewing
this scan, the patient was given 100% FiO2 and kept flat for 48
hours.  He was given perioperative ancef as well as morphine for
pain.  He was also give dilantin 100mg TID.  He was transferred
to step down in stable condition on POD 1.  On POD 2, he was
noted to be alert and oriented to self, but not totally
cooperative.  His pupils were reactive but sluggish.  He was
able to follow commands.  He was transfused one unit of RBCs for
blood loss anemia.  His 100% O2 was discontinued.  On POD 3, he
was still not quite strong enough to be discharged back to his
rehabilitation center.  His metoprolol was increased for
tachycardia.  That night, he sustained sudden and unexpected
cardiopulmonary arrest.  His nurse found him unresponsive and
not breathing.  She proceeded to call a "code blue."  Several
physicians responded and proceeded to resuscitate the patient.
He was intubated emergently and treated with epinepherine,
atropine, chest compressions, and ultimately cardioversion.  We
were able to obtain a sinus rhythum.  A right groin line was
placed for access.  He was transferred to the ICU for further
monitoring.  Due to the extremely grave nature of his prognosis,
his daughter subsequently decided to declare him DNR.  He was
treated with a morphine drip for comfort and died at 3:30am on
POD 4.
