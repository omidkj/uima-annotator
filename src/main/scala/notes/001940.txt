Service:  MEDICAL

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 78 year old woman with
a history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
ulcerative colitis, status post ileostomy in [**2097**], aortic
stenosis, status post valvuloplasty in [**2097**], and then aortic
valve replacement with a porcine aortic valve in [**2098**], and a
left below the knee amputation in [**2065**], who has had one week
of cough and sputum production that was treated with Levaquin
and Flagyl.

Two days prior to admission, the patient developed nausea and
vomiting and stopped taking her Flagyl but still had nausea.
She stopped being able to eat well and had some respiratory
distress and had diarrhea.  She was sent to the Emergency
Department for evaluation.  She denied any chest pain, denied
any blood in the diarrhea, denied any blood in her vomit,
denied fever, chills.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On arrival in the Emergency
Department, the patient's examination revealed she was an
uncomfortable dyspneic woman on oxygen via nasal cannula who
had to pause while speaking secondary to her dyspnea.   She
was afebrile.  Her blood pressure was 116/60 with a pulse of
86, respiratory rate 20s with oxygen saturation of 95% in
room air.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat - She was
normocephalic and atraumatic with no icterus.  Her mucous
membranes were dry.  She had no jugular venous distention.
Her chest had basilar crackles bilaterally, diffusely
decreased breath sounds.  The heart was regular.  She had a
III/VI midsystolic murmur.  Her abdomen was obese, soft,
nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly.  The ileostomy bag was in
place.  Her extremities revealed status post left below the
knee amputation.  Her right lower extremity was cool with
chronic erythema and venous stasis changes and trace edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white count 13.9, hematocrit
42.5, platelets 308,000. INR 2.1.  Chem7 revealed a sodium of
136, potassium 5.7, chloride 111, bicarbonate 6, blood urea
nitrogen 120, creatinine 3.0, glucose 110.  A troponin was
less than 0.3.  Urinalysis had 30 protein, specific gravity
of 1.016, three white cells, two red cells and a few
bacteria. ALT was 8, AST 20, alkaline phosphatase 102, total
bilirubin 0.4, amylase 111, CK 53.

Her chest x-ray showed no congestive heart failure and no
pneumonia.  Arterial blood gases at that time revealed pH
7.21, pCO2 22, pO2 153.

Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at 90 beats per minute.
Q wave in III, aVF and V2, 1.[**Street Address(2) 2811**] depressions in
II, V3 through V6.  T wave inversions in I, II, aVL, V4
through V6 and biphasic in V3.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit for correction of her metabolic acidosis and acute
renal failure and for ruling out acute myocardial infarction.

1.  Metabolic acidosis - She was given three amps of
bicarbonate in one liter of fluid.  She had blood cultures
drawn.  She was treated with oxygen.  Calcium, phosphorus and
magnesium levels were drawn and found to be low.  She was
repleted with those intravenously and her acidosis responded
so that on the day of transfer to the floor, her bicarbonate
was 19 and she was able to tolerate p.o.

2.  Acute renal failure - She had a creatinine of 3.0 when
her baseline is 1.1.  This responded well to intravenous
fluid hydration so that on the day of transfer to the floor
her creatinine was 1.8 and on the day of discharge from the
hospital her creatinine was 1.3.

It was thought that both metabolic acidosis and the acute
renal failure were secondary to severe volume depletion from
diarrhea and decreased p.o. intake.  She has responded well
to intravenous rehydration and repletion of her electrolytes.

3.  Rule out myocardial infarction - Serial CKs were done
which were negative.  Her troponin was always less than 0.3.
Despite the changes on the electrocardiogram, she was found
not to have had a myocardial infarction.  It was thought that
these changes were secondary to some ischemia probably
induced by the volume depletion.

4.  Respiratory - She began to have some increasing shortness
of breath on the day of transfer to the floor and stated that
at home she takes Albuterol nebulizer twice a day.  These
were started on the floor and her breathing improved.  She
continued on her normal respiratory medications, inhalers and
was continued on b.i.d. nebulizers.

5.  Gastrointestinal - The patient presented with nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea and decreased p.o. intake.  Over her
hospital stay, the diarrhea decreased and her stools became
more formed.  She was able to tolerate p.o. and hydrate
herself and replete her electrolytes through p.o. Amylase and
lipase were within normal limits throughout her hospital
stay.

6.  Infectious disease - The patient was diagnosed with
pneumonia prior to admission and stopped her antibiotics
during her illness.  No consolidation was seen on chest x-ray
but it was decided to treat her with Levaquin and Flagyl.
Flagyl was discontinued two days prior to discharge and she
will be continued on Levaquin for a total of ten days and
will stop her course on [**2104-9-1**].  Her blood cultures have
been negative throughout as has a urine culture and she has
been afebrile since her transfer from the Medical Intensive
Care Unit.

7.  Hematology - Her INR was 2.1 on admission and it was
subsequently checked and found to be 1.9.  Her liver function
tests were normal and it was felt that this was due to
Vitamin K depletion from poor nutrition. She was given
Vitamin K p.o. for three days and her INR will be checked
again as an outpatient.

She will follow-up with her regular primary care physician
when she gets home.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  She will be discharged to a rehabilitation
facility for further assistance with her activities of daily
living, respiratory status and her p.o. repletion.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers b.i.d.
2.  Atrovent MDI two puffs b.i.d.
3.  Vanceril MDI four puffs b.i.d.
4.  Humibid 600 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5.  Zantac 150 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Isordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d.
7.  Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
8.  Levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. q.d. to finish on [**2104-9-1**].
9.  Heparin 5000 units subcutaneous q.d.
10. Magnesium Oxide 420 mg p.o. t.i.d.
11. Elavil 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n.
12. Calcium Carbonate one gram p.o. q.d.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2.  Ulcerative colitis, status post ileostomy.
3.  Left below the knee amputation.
4.  Aortic stenosis, status post porcine aortic valve
    replacement.
5.  Acute renal failure which is resolving.
