Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 77690**] was admitted to Dr.[**Name (NI) 10946**] general surgery
service for his acute on chronic cholecystitis.  He was kept NPO
with IVF and given IV cipro and flagyl.  He was seen by
cardiology for consultation given his prior cardiac history.
They recommended continuing therapy with b-blocker, ACE-I, and
high dose statin, continuing ASA but holding Plavix, obtain TTE
and prior cardiac records.  A repeat RUQ ultrasound on HD4 was
unchanged.  Subjectively he felt decreased pain and was started
on a clear diet.
A HIDA scan was done on HD 5 indicating gallbladder not filling;
likely acute cholecystitis. The patient was pre-op'd and
consented and taken to the OR for a lap converted to open CCY.
He was transferred to the ICU post-op secondary to failed
spontaneous breathing trial, had desat to 80s in early
afternoon, felt to be [**3-3**] autopeep, hypotension to SBP 80s-90s,
also thought to be related to autopeep, changed to AC
ventillation. He was successfully extubated on POD 1 and
transferred to the floor.
He was maintained as NPO with PCA/Foley/O2 to maintain O2 sats
between 90-93. Pt is on home O2 2Liters via NC with baseline
sats in the low 90's. He was diuresed with IV lasix.
With the return of bowel function and flatus his diet was slowly
advanced as tolerated. Chest pt was done every 1-2 hrs, the pt
will need aggressive respitory care at rehab.
