ALLERGIES:  The patient had an allergy to penicillin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient was a retired custodian.  He had
a distant history of tobacco use.  He used alcohol
occasionally.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on admission
revealed a tachypneic gentleman in mild respiratory distress.
He had a temperature of 98.2??????F, a pulse of 70, a blood
pressure of 113/63, a respiratory rate of 24 and an oxygen
saturation of 96% on room air.  On head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat examination, the sclerae were anicteric.  The pupils
were equal, round and reactive to light.  The extraocular
movements were intact.  The oropharynx was clear.  The mucous
membranes were moist.  The neck was supple with no jugular
venous distention or lymphadenopathy.

The lungs revealed decreased breath sounds at the bases
bilaterally.  He had fine rales, left greater than right.
The cardiac examination revealed distant heart sounds, but a
regular rate and rhythm with a laterally displaced point of
maximal impulse.  He had a II/VI systolic murmur heard best
at the left lower sternal border radiating out to the axilla
and a positive S3.  The abdomen was soft, nontender and
nondistended with positive bowel sounds.  He had hepatomegaly
three finger-lengths below the rib cage.  The extremity
examination revealed 3+ pitting edema to the thighs
bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  Significant laboratory data on admission
included a white blood cell count of 5000, hematocrit of
35.4, platelet count of 122,000, INR of 3.1, partial
thromboplastin time of 44.8, sodium of 126, potassium of 4.9,
chloride of 85, bicarbonate of 25, BUN of 82, creatinine of
2.8 and glucose of 112.

RADIOLOGY:  The chest x-ray revealed cardiomegaly with
bilateral left greater than right pleural effusions.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  The electrocardiogram was
atrioventricularly paced at a rate of 70 without change from
the prior electrocardiogram of [**2189-4-28**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the medical
service with the presumptive diagnosis of worsening
congestive heart failure of unclear etiology.  He was ruled
out by cardiac enzymes and had no evidence of acute ischemic
heart disease.  He was diuresed with intravenous Lasix on the
floor for several days with good response until hospital day
#5, when his creatinine once again began to rise despite the
clinical assessment that the patient remained significantly
fluid overloaded.  Laboratory data including a sodium of 119
and a potassium of 6.0 with a BUN of 67 and creatinine of 3.1
seemed to indicate that the patient was having forward
cardiac failure leading to renal insufficiency and
hyponatremia.

For this reason, he was transferred to the cardiac care unit
for milrinone treatment guided by pulmonary artery
catheterization measurements.  The heart failure team was
consulted and helped the cardiology team diurese the patient
over the next several days with the titration of milrinone.
Over the next several days, the patient diuresed
significantly, several liters of fluid.  His renal function
improved to a creatinine of 1.6 and his sodium level
corrected to a level of 130.  During this time, his Coreg
medication had been continued and, after several days at the
recommendations of the heart failure team, his Coreg dose was
gradually increased to a level of 6.25 mg b.i.d.  His ACE
inhibitor and spironolactone were again added to his regimen
and maintained while the milrinone was titrated to off.

After weaning of the milrinone and discontinuation of the
pulmonary catheterization, the patient was once again
transferred to the cardiology step-down unit, where his
afterload reduction with ACE inhibitors continued to be
titrated up and his laboratory data and renal output were
followed closely.  Although he experienced a slight rise in
his creatinine again after discontinuation of the milrinone,
his renal function remained stable with a creatinine of 2.5
and he continued to maintain a good urine output with
markedly improved breathing from admission.

During his hospitalization, workup for his heart failure was
conducted.  An echocardiogram revealed no significant
differences with a continued poor ejection fraction of
15-20%.  A TSH level was found to be elevated and so his
Synthroid dose was increased.  He also received a nutrition
consultation and education regarding a low salt cardiac diet
to continue on after discharge.

Alternative treatments for his heart failure including
Digoxin therapy were entertained, but the decision was made
not to begin Digoxin therapy at this time.  A discussion also
revolved around maintenance of the patient on 400 mg of daily
amiodarone, given the possible pulmonary toxicity at this
dose and worsening of his subjective shortness of breath.
However, given the extensive ectopy in the past on mexiletine
and low dose amiodarone, it was felt advisable to continue
him on both mexiletine and higher dose amiodarone.

He did experience an exacerbation of his gout, which was
treated with colchicine successfully.

DISPOSITION:  On [**2189-6-26**], the patient was markedly improved
from a respiratory standpoint and was deemed stable for
discharge to rehabilitation.  He is being actively screened
at this time and can be transferred to rehabilitation upon
availability of a bed.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery disease.
2.  Severe congestive heart failure.
3.  Rheumatic heart disease.
4.  History of ventricular ectopy.
5.  Hypothyroidism.
6.  Electrolyte abnormalities.
7.  Acute renal failure.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient will be discharged to rehabilitation.
He will require follow up with the heart failure service in
three to four weeks.  At rehabilitation, it will be important
to continue to monitor his electrolytes, BUN and creatinine
as well as his INR level daily.  It will also be important to
check daily weights before breakfast every day in order to
monitor his fluid status or to monitor intakes and outputs as
accurately as possible.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Zestril 2.5 mg p.o. q.d.
Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.
Coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. h.s.
Coreg 6.25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
Lasix 120 mg p.
