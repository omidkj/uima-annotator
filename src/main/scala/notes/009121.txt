Admission Date:  [**2141-10-29**]     Discharge Date:  [**2141-11-7**]

Date of Birth:   [**2101-12-11**]     Sex:  M

Service:  O-MED

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a is 39-year-old
gentleman with a history of human immunodeficiency virus
(with a CD4 count of 244 and a viral load of 16,200 on
[**9-28**]), Hodgkin's disease (stage IVB), status post
Adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine; status post
one cycle of British MOPP; and status post one cycle of
Adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine who completed
his second dose of the first cycle of his Adriamycin,
bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine on [**2141-10-17**].

History is complicated now by neutropenia, and the patient
was given G-CSF on [**2141-10-24**].  One to two days after
receiving G-CSF the patient experienced increasing nausea and
vomiting with fevers.  The patient's temperature was 101
degrees Fahrenheit orally.  In addition, the patient has been
having loose watery stools; however, this is baseline for
him.  He denies any headache, cough, sinus pain, ear pain,
sore throat, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, neck pain,
dysuria, or back pain.  He has no history of trauma.

The patient came to the Emergency Department after several
days of the above-mentioned symptoms with a temperature of
104.8 degrees Fahrenheit and an absolute neutrophil count of
0.  In the Emergency Department the patient was started on
cefepime.  However, the patient's blood pressure began to
drop, and the patient was started on dopamine and
vasopressin.  He was subsequently transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit requiring intravenous fluids and
norepinephrine and vasopressin.  After the patient's blood
pressure increased, he was weaned off of pressors in the
Intensive Care Unit; however, his fevers continued.  The
patient was found to be Clostridium difficile positive.

At that point, the patient was transferred to the floor to
the O-MED Service.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed the patient's temperature was 102.4 degrees
Fahrenheit, his heart rate was 108, his blood pressure was
113/62, his respiratory rate was 20, and his oxygen
saturation was 97% on room air.  On general examination, the
patient was a young-appearing male who was mildly
diaphoretic.  He was lying in bed comfortably.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose, and throat examination revealed the mucous
membranes were moist.  The oropharynx was clear.  Pupils were
equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  The
neck was supple.  There was no evidence of lymphadenopathy.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular examination revealed the patient was
tachycardic but otherwise a regular rate and rhythm.  No
murmurs, rubs, or gallops were appreciated.  Abdominal
examination revealed a left-sided scar.  The abdomen was
nontender and nondistended.  Bowel sounds were audible.  The
patient had no evidence of guarding.  Back examination
revealed no midline tenderness.  Genitourinary examination
revealed no evidence of lesions.  The patient had a Foley
catheter without any evidence of erythema, or exudate, or
pain.  On external rectal examination, there was no evidence
of lesions or exudate.  On neurologic examination, the
patient was alert and oriented times three.  There were no
focal deficits.  The patient had a left subclavian line which
was clean, dry, and intact with no evidence of exudate.
There was mild pedal edema.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   A chest x-ray showed

pneumonia.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  On admission to the O-MED
Service, the patient was given Neupogen injections
subcutaneously.  This therapy was continued until his
absolute neutrophil count was greater than 1000 for two days.

Cultures were drawn on the patient including stool and blood
cultures on days [**10-29**] to [**11-2**], and urine cultures
from days [**10-29**] to [**10-31**].  All of these cultures
were negative with the exception of Clostridium difficile.

On [**10-31**], the patient underwent a computed tomography
with contrast of the abdomen which showed no evidence of
intra-abdominal abscess or bowel wall thickening.  However,
there was some evidence of bilateral pleural effusions.

A possible pneumonia was considered as a source of fevers;
however, it was thought that the abnormalities seen on a
recent computerized axial tomography were secondary to fluid
overload during aggressive resuscitation in the Intensive
Care Unit and nodular opacities from his malignancy.

The patient was diagnosed with Clostridium difficile on
[**10-29**] and was subsequently placed on intravenous Flagyl.
The patient was continued on this regimen secondary to emesis
until [**11-3**] when he was able to tolerate  medications.
At that time, he was changed to  Flagyl.  The patient
continued to have diarrhea throughout the hospital course.

On [**10-30**], the patient developed a warm erythematous
region; roughly one foot in diameter about the umbilicus.
This was thought to be a cellulitis, and the patient was
started on vancomycin on [**10-30**].

On [**11-2**], the patient developed a superficial abscess
left of the umbilicus.  At this time, the Infectious Disease
Service was consulted.  On [**11-3**], the abscess
self-perforated.  Swabs were performed of the exudate which
grew Staphylococcus aureus sensitive to oxacillin.  On
[**2141-11-6**], the vancomycin was discontinued and the
patient was changed to dicloxacillin.  At this time, the
cellulitis had resolved.  Cefepime was discontinued on
[**2141-11-4**]; as per the Infectious Disease request, as
it was thought that this was contributing to the Clostridium
dif
