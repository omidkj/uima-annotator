.
EKG [**8-18**] demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with no significant
ST-T changes.  EKG from [**8-17**] signficant for complete heart
block.  Prior EKG unavailable for examination.
.
TELEMETRY demonstrated:   no legitimate alars
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2149-12-26**] demonstrated:
EF 65% Concentric LVH, preserved LV systolic function,
calcification of mitral annulus with minimal MR, aortic
sclerotic changes, and normal pulmonary artery pressures.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Cardiac
a. Rhythm
Bradycardia:
The patient presented with complete heart blcok, with a rhythm
that appeared to have been CHB with junctional escape given the
narrow complex and the fact that the QRS is similar to when the
pt is in SR. Unclear what the primary process was causing the
bradycardia, hypoxemia vs sepsis vs primary cardiogenic.
Medication effect of Toprol and verapamil likely playing a large
role as well. After the day of admission, the patinet remained
in sinus rhythm with 1:1 conduction throughout hospitalization.
The patinet had a transvenous pacer wire placed upon admission.
The patient remained without continued bradycardia, and
temporary pacer was removed.  Given unknown etiology of block,
patient had a permanent pacemaker placed without complication
set at VVI.  The patient was restarted on low-dose metoprolol
given history of atrial fibrilltion and hypertension while
hospitalized and tolerated well.
.
b. CAD:
Patient with unclear history of CAD, though known risk factors
of CVA, dm2.  The patient was continued on ASA and BB.
.
c. Pump:
Patient was hypotenison upon admission, in the setting of
bradycardia, and was supported on dopa/levophed.  After initial
event, patient was hypertensive during hospitalization, and
placed on hydralazine, low dose metoprolol, and HCTZ with
adequate control.

2. Respiratory failure:
The patient presented with respiratory failure, and was
intubated in the emergency room.  Unclear etiology. PNA vs CHF
vs PE. Mental status may have precipitated intubation as well,
unclear from the records. PE is a possibility as well, though
INR was 1.9 on admission.  Patient had an elevated WBC to 21,
and was started on vanc/zosyn for suspected aspiration
pneumonia, was titrated to levo, and completed the course.  CTA
was performed which had an equivical read of possible PE, and
patient was started on heparin.  Upon discharge, patient still
not therapeutic on coumadin, and will be sent on lovenox (PPx
dose given recent PPM placement) and coumadin.  The patient was
extubated on third day of admissison without difficulty, and had
remained comfortable.
.

# Neuro:
Mental status changes at rehab likely [**1-23**] hypotension and
metabolic disturbances. Also with head CT revealing hypodensity
in the left parietooccipital region in which acute stroke,
possibly watershed infarct cannot be ruled.  Patient showed
myoclonic movements at admission, and neuro was consulted to
evaluate non-convulsive status vs. anoxic brain injury.  EEG not
c/w NCSE.  Patient was extubated, and showed deficit compared to
baseline.  Neuro started keppra for seizure ppx, which should be
titrated up 250mg each week until at goal of 1000mg [**Hospital1 **].
- serial neuro exams
- consider neuro consult
- consider MRI if more stable tomorrow

.
# ARF:
Patient presented with Cr 1.7 from baseline of Cr 0.7.  Improved
with hydration, and beleived to be secondary to dehydration
coupled with hypoperfusion w/ bradycardia/hypotension.
.
