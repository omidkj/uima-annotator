Service:  Trauma Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 68-year-old male with
past medical history significant for congestive heart failure
and atrial fibrillation on Coumadin anticoagulation status
post left hip replacement, who presented as a trauma transfer
from [**Hospital3 26615**] Hospital status post a fall early on the
afternoon of [**11-16**].  Patient fell down 13 stairs, hit
his head, and had a questionable loss of consciousness.

He initially presented as a walk-in to the Emergency
Department at [**Hospital3 26615**] Hospital with an alcohol level of
355 on admission.  He had a head CT at the outside hospital,
which indicated a left subarachnoid hemorrhage in the sylvian
fissure.  Initial imaging suggested no mass effect or shift.
The patient denied any headache or neck pain at the time, but
did have some nausea and vomiting.  He had C spine plain
films at [**Hospital3 26615**], which were negative.  He arrived at
[**Hospital1 69**] in a C collar at time of
transfer.  His initial INR was 2.1 at the outside hospital,
and he had been given 1 unit of FFP as well as vitamin K to
reverse his anticoagulation.

Initial vitals:  Temperature of 94.5 degrees.  Heart rate of
101.  Blood pressure of 118/74.  Respiratory rate of 16 and a
pulse oximetry of 100.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On initial examination, he was [**Initials (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2611**] coma score of 13-14, E4, V4, M6.  Pupils were equal
and reactive at 2 to 3 mm with extraocular motions intact.
Left periorbital ecchymosis was noted as well as a laceration
on the left zygomatic arch.  The patient had no step-offs or
tenderness in the midline neck and back.  Cardiac examination
revealed an irregularly, irregular heart beat and some
tachycardia.  Chest was clear to auscultation and belly was
soft and nontender.  Rectal examination revealed normal tone
and guaiac negative stool.  He had a right knee hematoma with
no obvious deformities or dislocations and a left knee
abrasion.  He was moving all extremities, had 5/5 strength
bilaterally and had grossly intact sensory examination.

INITIAL LABORATORY WORK:  CBC revealed a white count of 7.4,
hematocrit of 36.9, and a platelet count of 85.  His Chem-7
revealed a sodium of 143, potassium of 4.9, chloride of 106,
CO2 of 32, BUN of 17, creatinine of 1.1, and a glucose of
155.  His initial coags were a PT of 16.5, PTT 31.7, and INR
of 1.8.  Alcohol level at [**Hospital3 **] was measured at 265.
Lactate level was 3.5, fibrinogen was 227, amylase was 121.
Venous blood gas was obtained which was 7.35 pH, pCO2 of 55,
pO2 48, bicarb of 32, and base access of 2.  U tox was
negative.

[**Hospital **]HOSPITAL MEDICATIONS:
1. Coumadin.
2. Digoxin.
3. Spironolactone.

ALLERGIES:  He has no known allergies to medications.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was initially admitted to the
Trauma SICU with an intent to keep his INR below 1.3.  He was
transfused 6 units of FFP as well as Lasix to prevent fluid
overload.  He was given platelet transfusion with a goal of
keeping his platelets above 100.  In the ICU, he received
q.1h. neuro checks for the first part of his admission.
Blood pressure goal was to keep a systolic below 160.

He was started on Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis, and the
SAH was followed with serial head CT.

Patient was transferred to the floor after serial head CT
showed stable subarachnoid hemorrhage.  His mental status
continued to improve and the C collar was removed after
clinical clearance of the C spine.  Seizure prophylaxis was
D/C'd.  He was given additional FFP on the floor to maintain
an INR below 1.3 as well as three days of vitamin K.

Patient received multiple imaging studies while being
evaluated on the Trauma Service.  He had a CAT scan of the C
spine which was negative, a CT abdomen and pelvis which was
negative, right knee plain films that were negative, right
shoulder plain films that were negative, and a negative chest
x-ray.  Patient continued to do well on the floor, but was
noted to be slightly unsteady on his feet when gotten out of
bed, so a Physical Therapy evaluation was ordered.  PT
evaluation felt the patient was not safe to be discharged to
his home and felt that a short stay in rehab would facilitate
a return to baseline functional status.

Case management was involved in order to locate a rehab
facility that would be appropriate for his physical therapy
goals.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehab facility.
