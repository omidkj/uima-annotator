INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA
and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal regional LV systolic
function.
Overall normal LVEF (>55%). No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta
diameter. Simple atheroma in ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch
diameter.
Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. Normal descending
aorta diameter.
Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Filamentous strands
on the aortic
leaflets c/with Lambl's excresences (normal variant). No AS. No
AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MS.
Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.

PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the
procedure. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Results
were personally

Conclusions:
Prebypass

1.No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.

2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Regional
left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function
is normal (LVEF>55%).

3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.

4.There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the
descending thoracic aorta.

5.There are three aortic valve leaflets. There are filamentous
strands on the
aortic leaflets consistent with Lambl's excresences (normal
variant). There is
no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.

6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.

7.There is a small pericardial effusion.

POSTBYPASS

1. Patient is being AV paced and receiving an infusion of
phenylephrine.

2. Biventricular systolic function is unchanged.

3. Mild mitral regurgitation persists.

4. Aorta is intact post decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**4-6**] and underwent cabg x4 with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**].
Transferred to the CSRU in stable condition on titrated
propofol, phenylephrine and nitroglycerin drips. Extubated that
evening and remained in the CSRU for 2 days requiring titrated

results were negative. Chest tubes removed without incident on
