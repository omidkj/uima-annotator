Discharge Instructions:
--Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
Adhere to 2 gm sodium diet

--The operation you have experienced is a "scraping" operation;
that is to say, the bladder tumor or biopsy sample was "scraped"
off the bladder wall. Bleeding was controlled with
electrocautery which will produce a "scab" in the inside bladder
wall. About 1-2 weeks after the operation, pieces of the scab
will fall off and come out with the urine. As this occurs,
bleeding may be noted which is normal. You should not worry
about this. Simply lie down and increase your fluid intake for a
few hours. In most cases, the urine will clear. Because of this
tendency for bleeding, aspirin (or Advil) must be avoided for 2
weeks following your operation (Tylenol is okay). If bleeding
occurs or persists for more than 12 hours or if clots appear
impairing your stream, call your urologist.

If you develop a fever over 101??????, or have chills, call your
urologist. Although not common, this may indicate infection that
has developed beyond the control of the antibiotics that you
have taken.

It will take 6 weeks from the date of surgery to fully recover
from your operation. This can be divided into two parts -- the
first 2 weeks and the last 4 weeks. During the first 2 weeks
from the date of your surgery, it is important to be "a person
of leisure". You should avoid lifting and straining, which also
means that you should avoid constipation. This can be done by
any of 3 ways: 1) modify your diet, 2) use stool softeners which
have been prescribed for you, and 3) use gentle laxatives such
as Milk of Magnesia which can be purchased at your local drug
store. It is important for you to avoid prolonged sitting. You
should avoid sexual activity during this time. Also, avoid
driving. The danger is not so much the driving, but it may delay
you from urinating if you have the urge; and, "holding" urine
may cause bleeding. If you return to work before 2 weeks, you
may feel fatigued and require a decreased work load.

During the second 4 week period of your recovery, you may begin
regular activity, but only on a graduated basis. For example,
you may feel well enough to return to work, but you may find it
easier to begin on a half-day basis. It is common to become
quite tired in the afternoon, and if such occurs, it is best to
take a nap! Also, you may begin to drive as well as lift objects
such as a briefcase, etc. If you are a golfer, you may begin to
swing a golf club at this time. Sexual activity may be resumed
during this time, but only on a limited basis. In general, your
overall activity may be escalated to normal as you progress
through this second time period, such that by 6-8
