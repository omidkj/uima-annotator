Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Attempted biventricular upgrade of ICD


History of Present Illness:
57 year old male with CAD s/p MIx4, CABG, DM2, HLD, HTN, CHF,
CVA  p/w with chief complaint of substernal chest & back pain
with diaphoresis which occurred around 10am in [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] lobby.
Pt. took 2 sl NTG AT 10:15AM & again 10:30 AM (O.6MG). Came up
to [**Hospital Ward Name **] 7 for cardiology appt with more substernal/back pain
withdiaphoresis. Given 2 more sl NTG at 11am with relief. Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 437**] evaluated pt. EKG LBBB morphology which is wider, SR.
BP122/80 [**Last Name (un) **]/STANDING, AFTER NTG 114/80, HR 86-90. No N/V/SOB.
Feels some indigestion. Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 437**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 95937**] requested CTA to
rule out aortic dissection & PE, ? cath.
.
In the ED, he had no further chest pain (initially). A CXR with
No ACP and no mediastinal widening. Per ED, it was discussed
with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] and he was put into Obs for two sets and a
stress. He ruled in on the second set with a trop of 0.13. He
received ? 1-2L of NS for unclear reasons and an amiodarone
bolus for 5 beat run of NSVT. The ED then found him c/o chespt
pain with radiation to back and tachycardic and believed that he
was in Afib with RVR. He developed a new O2 requirement with 91%
on 5L and a CXR was apparently c/w pulmonary edema. He received
0.125 mg Digoxin, zofranm large doses of morphine,was placed on
bipap, ntg drip, heparin drip with resolution of his chest pain.
His EKG was c/w SR with apcs and vpcs. After CCU admission was
requested, he then received 5 mg of IV metoprolol and 50 mg of
Lopressor for HR 130. His rate fell to 80's. He also received 60
mg of IV lasix.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Other Studies
- ECG:  SR at 120 with APC and VPC, LBBB
.
- ECHO [**2176-7-31**]:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF <20
%). The estimated cardiac index is borderline low
(2.0-2.5L/min/m2). The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**2-11**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe left ventricular dilation with severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis. Mildly dilated right ventricle
with moderate global hypokinesis. Mild to moderate mitral
regurgitation.
.
CXR [**2176-7-31**]
Stable chest x-ray examination with no acute pulmonary process
identified. The tracheal deviation in the course of the
contiguous [**Month/Day/Year 26418**] lead is in keeping with a large left thyroid
lobe which grossly is stable.
CXR [**2176-7-31**]
1. New mild pulmonary edema.
2. Intact [**Month/Day/Year 26418**]/pacemaker lead in standard position.
3. Stable rightward tracheal deviation due to known thyroid
mass.


Brief Hospital Course:
57 year old male with CAD s/p MIx4, CHF, CVA  p/w with chief
complaint of substernal chest & back pain found to have NSTEMI
who was not a candidate for interventional therapy so received
medical management.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# NSTEMI: Pt presented with CP and found to have NSTEMI by
enzymes. Previous cath suggested pt would benefit best from
medical management. Started on nitroglycerin drip, heparin gtt x
48 hrs, [**Month/Day/Year **] (allergy was previous GI bleed) and [**Month/Day/Year 4532**]. Nitro
drip d/c'ed on [**8-1**] and pt re-started on home imdur. Pt
experienced another episode of CP while undergoing PT, though no
EKG changes were noted. Amlodipine 10mg was added to help
improve pt's CP. Max dose of Crestor was added in place of
atorvastatin for suboptimal lipid control. Also started o
