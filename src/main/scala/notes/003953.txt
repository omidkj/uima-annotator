History of Present Illness:
This patient is a 61 year old female who is transferred from
outside hospital for dyspnea with known [**Doctor Last Name 27210**] syndrome and
known MR. History is very limited due to her acuity and is
mostly from EMS and outside hospital. The patient presented with
acute onset dyspnea, tachycardia, and was very tachypneic. Upon
arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER she was intubated and admitted tothe
MICU. An ECHO was done this morning revealing 4+ Mitral regurg
w/ flail leaflet.  She is presently  acidotic in cardiogenic
shock, intubated, sedated on  Levophed and Neo. Cardiac surgery
was consulted for emergent MVR.

[**2183-7-19**] preop echo
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The right ventricular cavity
is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2).
No aortic regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of aortic regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is mitral valve prolapse. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. At least moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] Due to the eccentric nature of the regurgitant
jet, its severity may be significantly underestimated (Coanda
effect). The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Small, hyperdynamic left ventricle. Dilated and
hypokinetic right ventricle. Mitral valve prolapse with at least
moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate aortic stenosis.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2178-2-16**], severity of mitral regurgitation has
probably worsened and right ventricle is now hypocontractile.
This study might be significantly UNDERestimating the severity
of eccentric mitral regurgitation and if there is clinical
concern for acute severe mitral regurgitation, a transesophageal
study is recommended.

[**2183-7-19**] Chest CT
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.

2. Cardiomegaly with marked left atrial enlargement. Bilateral
diffuse ground
glass opacity and interlobular and intralobular septal
thickening suggests
severe pulmonary edema. More consolidative areas within the
lower lobes
bilaterally may be due to pneumonia or atelectasis.

3. Small to moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions, left
larger than
right.

[**2183-7-19**] cardiac cath
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Anomolous coronary arteries with no hemodynamically
significant
2. Severely elevated left- and right-sided filling pressures.
3. Successful placement of intra-aortic balloon pump.

[**2183-7-20**] intra-op echo
Prebypass

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] with severe global RV free
wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve is bicuspid. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. Significant aortic stenosis is present (not
quantified). Unable to calculate gradients and [**Location (un) 109**] due to poor
doppler alignment in the deep transgastric views. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are myxomatous.
There is partial mitral leaflet flail. Torn mitral chordae are
present. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the
eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be
significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person
of the results on [**2183-7-20**] at 1500 hours.

Post bypass

Patient is in sinus rhythm and receiving an infusion of
norepinephrine, epinephrine and milrinone. RV function is
slightly improved. LVEF= 35%. The inferior and inferoseptal
walls are hypokinetic.

Bioprosthetic valve seen on the aortic position. Valve appears
well seated and the leaflets move well. Trace central aortic
insufficiency present. There is a strut seen in the LVOT.

There is a bioprosthetic valve seen in the mitral position. This
valve appears well seated and the leaflets move well.

Aorta appears intact post decannulation.

Intraaortic balloon pump tip seems to be in good position.

Echo [**2183-7-31**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
