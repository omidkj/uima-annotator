Imaging:

EGD: Erythema and erosion in the gastroesophageal junction
Mild friability and erythema in the stomach
Polyps in the fundus
Gastric mass
Normal mucosa in the duodenum
Small hiatal hernia
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
Recommendations: Serial hcts. Allow clears. Prep for [**Last Name (un) **]
tomorrow. Should have repeat egd in [**5-8**] weeks to evaluate lesion
in the stomach body as well as the GE junction. [**Hospital1 **] PPI.

[**2194-12-22**] Small Bowel Enteroscopy:
Impression: Diverticula in the proximal jejunum and mid jejunum
(injection)
The presence of jejunal diverticuli and the CT angiographic
findings are highly suggestive, but not diagnostic, of small
bowel diverticular bleeding.


[**12-23**] Small bowel enteroscopy:
Impression: Multiple large divertiula noted in the mid jejunum.
Multiple small ulcers noted between diverticula and on
diverticular edges
No active bleeding or bleeding site noted
The point of maximum reach of the enteroscope was tattooed
Otherwise normal small bowel enteroscopy to mid jejunum

Brief Hospital Course:
74 y/o gentleman with the h/o diverticular disease, GERD and
Parkinson disease presents with melena and weakness that led to
a fall.
.
# GI Bleed: The patient had a history of dark stools/melena for
3 days. On rectal exam, he has brown stool with black specks. We
initially suspected lower GI bleed due to diverticulosis and
given painless nature, however upper GI bleed thought possible
too. Hct dropped from baseline 44 in [**3-/2194**] to 25.0 on
admission. Patient required massive transfusion protocol for
first 2 days in the ICU.  GI was consulted. Started on IV PPI,
electively intubated for EGD, which was negative for bleed.
Given the multiple transfusions without appropriate increase in
Hct, CTA performed to attempt localization of bleed. CTA of the
abdomen noted blush in mid-jejunum, suspicious for jejunal
source of bleed.  Attempted IR embolization failed.  Push
enteroscopy showed multiple diverticula in the small bowel
without active bleeding. Patient then had a balloon enteroscopy,
which again showed many jejunal diverticula with some
ulceration/friability the edges but did not have any active
bleeding.  Colorectal surgery was consulted and recommended
laparoscopic small bowel resection as a possible definitive
treatment, however his bleeding appeared to be stabilized at
that time, so this was not pursued urgently.  Bleeding slowed on
the hospital days 4 and 5, allowing for transfer to the medical
floor.  Colonoscopy performed, showed large internal hemorrhoids
with stigmata of recent bleeding were noted [overlying clot].
Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and descending colon,
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum.  Hct remained stable.  He
was continued on a PPI.  He should follow up in colorectal
surgery for evaluation of hemorrhoidectomy.
