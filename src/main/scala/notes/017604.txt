History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 85375**] is an 87 year old woman with hearing impairment,
atrial fibrillation, and recent hip fracture. She was in her
usual state of health yesterday. This morning she appeared
confused and was unable to communicate. Early this morning her
son noted that she left the water on in the bathroom and walked
back to bed. She normally asked for assistance in walking to the
bathroom. Her son noted a rapid heart rate and then called EMS.

.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 103 P 150 BP 150/102 R 40s. She
was 92% on RA. She was in atrial fibrillation with RVR, but her
blood pressure medications were hold because of concern for
sepsis. She was given vancomycin, cefepime, aspirin, and
tylenol. In the ED she was arousable, but unable to communicate.
She had 2 PIVs.
.
VS prior to transfer were 120 117/91 30 100% on NRB. When she
arrived on the floor the history was partially obtained from the
patient who communicates by writing and [**Location (un) 1131**] lips. The
majority of the history was obtained through the son. The
patient's husband who is also hearing impaired. He notes that
she has had a cough recently that has been non-productive. She
has had 1-2 episodes of urinary incontinence over the couple of
months since her hip surgery. She has had episodes of
diarrhea/constipation that are typical for her. She has not been
complaining of pain. Her overall appetite has been slowly
decreasing, but not acutely.

Imaging
[**2126-5-7**] Transthoracic Echo
The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
>55%). Diastolic function could not be assessed. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function. Mild aortic and mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary
hypertension. Normal estimated systemic venous pressures.

Study unable to adequately assess diastolic LV function in the
setting of what appears to be atrial fibrillation.
[**2126-5-4**] CT Head
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage. Extensive small vessel
ischemic
disease. In case of clinical concern for acute infarction, an
MRI can be
obtained if not contra-indicated.
2. Right nasal polypoid lesion (2:4), arising from the nasal
septum. This can be further evaluated with direct visualization.

.
[**2126-5-4**] Chest Xray
IMPRESSION:
1. Large left pleural effusion and left basilar opacity,
possibly represent atelectasis, but infection is not excluded.
Please note that a left hilar mass cannot be excluded and a CT
chest with IV contrast can be otained for further evaluation.
2. Small right pleural effusion.
3. Apparent air-fluid level overlying the cardiac silhouette in
the right
lung base. Dedicated PA and lateral is recommended for further
evaluation.
.
[**2126-5-4**] Chest CT
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right with
mediastinal
shift towards the right. Atelectasis of the left lung with only
minimal
aeration of the left upper lung zone. No evidence of underlying
mass lesion.
2. Left atrial enlargement.
3. Subcentimeter AVM in the left lobe of the liver.
4. Vascular calcifications.
.
[**2126-5-5**] Thoracentesis Fluid
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Abundant neutrophils, mesothelial cells and histiocytes
.
[**2126-5-5**] Chest Xray
Moderate volume of left pleural effusion persist after large
volume left
thoracentesis. No pneumothorax. Moderate right pleural effusion
is larger.
The cardiac silhouette is now more reliably imaged, moderately
enlarged. Mild pulmonary edema may be present. Left lower lobe
is largely airless and the left lower lobe bronchus opacified
which could be due to obstruction or at least retained
secretions. Followup advised.
.
[**2126-5-6**] Chest Xray
Moderate bilateral pleural effusion, left greater than right, is
roughly
unchanged since [**5-5**], but difficult to compare because of
variations in
patient position. Left lower lobe remains collapsed and the
lower lobe
bronchus is airless, although it should be noted that
intervening chest CT
showed no mass or endobronchial obstruction. The lower lobe
bronchus could be malacic or otherwise collapsed due to the
persistent left pleural effusion and/or chronic atelectasis.
Moderate cardiomegaly improved. Left perihilar opacification is
probably mild residual edema related to recent reexpansion.

Labs on discharge:

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 85375**] is an 87 year old woman with hearing impairment,
atrial fibrillation, and large left sided pleural effusion. She
presented with altered mental status, tachycardia, and fevers.
.
Fevers: Patient was febrile to 103 in ED but remained afebrile
througout the rest of her hospitalization. She initially
received vancomycin and cefepime in the ED. Her U/A looked
positive initially, but urine cultures had no growth. Blood
cultures have remained no growth to date. LP was negative.
Pulmonary infection thought the most likely process given
possible consolidation/collapsed lung on CT scan. She was placed
on community acquired pneumonia coverage with  vancomycin,
ceftriaxone, and azithromycin (d# 1 = [**2126-5-4**]) for CAP.  She
completed a seven day course.
.
Altered mental status: CT of the head showed no clear evidence
of hemorrhage. Altered mental status likely multifactorial to
fever, hypoxia, CHF, and ICU delirium. Patient improved
significantly when transferred ou
