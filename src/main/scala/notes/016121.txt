Cardiac Catheterization
Hemodialysis


History of Present Illness:
66F ESRD s/p DCD renal transplant ([**2160**]) and hx of AFib s/p
cardiversions X 2 (On Coumadin), CAD with stress test in [**Month (only) **]
[**2165**] showing some anterior apical attenuation with possible
peri-infarct ischemia, diastolic heart failure (Echo at OSH
showed anteroapical akinesis with an LVEF of 45%, decreased from
60% in [**3-5**], marked pulmonary HTN, estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure was 74, 1+ MR) and PVD transferred today from
OSH with a NSTEMI with plans for cardiac cath who presents to
the CCU with signficant abdominal pain. Of note, the patient was
admitted for severe abdominal pain in [**3-5**] and constipation (no
BM x 7days) and was much improved after bowel cleansing. She has
a history of alternating constipation/diarrhea, and had a
colonscopy in [**3-5**] that was wnl.
.
History per the patient's daughter and OSH notes. The pt
recently had been seen at [**Hospital6 33**] and by her PCP.
.
The pt presented to OSH last weekend with a one week history of
lightheadedness and low heart rate. She was believed to have
tachybrady syndrome and cardiology was consulted to evaluate
patient for pacemaker placement. She was monitored, her cardiac
enzymes were wnl at the time. Her symptoms did not seem to be
associated with the bradycardia, as they persisted with a normal
HR, and a PM was not thought to be necessary. She was
subsequently d/c'd on Monday evening. On Tuesday morning,
however, she went to her PCP for SOB, he was concerned that she
had an infection and started her on levaquin and perscribed home
oxygen.
.
She presented to [**Hospital3 **] again the next morning ([**7-22**]) with
fever (100.5), multiple arthralgias and abdominal pain, denying
chest pain. VS on admission (66 18 119/41). Her EKG showed
normal sinus rhythm, LVH, poor R-wave progession, question of an
old anteroseptal infarct and lateral T-wave inversions in I, avL
and V5 and V6. Her CE on admission: CPK - 585, CPK-MB - 40.9,
troponin - 5.09. BNP - 22,864. She was not thought to need an
urgent cath, and was treated with a heparin gtt, low dose BB,
Repeat enzymes were (CPK - 490, 449, troponins 4.68, 4.72, CK-MB
- 27.9, 24.1). Her abdominal pain was evaluated by CT which
showed a distended gb as the only pathology with subsequent RUQ
US showing a small amount of gb sludge, moderately distended gb,
but no pericholecystic fluid, with mild dilatation of the CBD to
8mm.
.
Also at the hospital, her Cr was from 2.5-2.9, which is close to
her baseline of [**12-30**] since [**2164-12-27**]. She was transferred to the
[**Hospital1 **] with a NSTEMI for possible cath in the setting of severe
renal disease as her renal transplant team is here, and accepted
by CCU with severe abdominal pain and positive CEs.
.
On transfer to CCU, pt complaining of diffuse abdominal pain.
The pain is associated with nausea, distension, and bowel
urgency. It has been getting progressively worse in severity
since Wednesday morning. The patient's daughter reports a few
episodes of non-bloody emesis at the OSH, patient had a large
normal bowel movement yesterday morning. She has been having
flatus.
.
Patient hypertensive to SBP in 160s on arrival to the floor and
was started on a nitro gtt. She was started on a heparin gtt in
light of elevated CEs at OSH, and abdominal pain as a possible
anginal equivalent. A stat CT abd w/o contrast was ordered [**12-29**]
to poor renal function, and surgery was consulted. CT did not
reveal any obvious cause for her pain. Patient given soap suds
enema, had large BM, mostly watery stools with one large, hard
piece with minimal improvement in abdominal pain.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA,  cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for minimal exertional
activity at baseline, patient uses wheelchair [**12-29**] LE ulcer,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, [**12-30**] pillow orthopnea,
lightheadedness, denies chest pain, ankle edema, palpitations.
