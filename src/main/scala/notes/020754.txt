Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the vascular surgery service on
[**2199-7-19**] for chest pain rradiating to his back, with a known
history of descending thoracic dissection.

Neuro: the patient received adequate pain control throughout his
hospitalization.

CV: The patient was transferred from an OSH where he underwent a
CTA of his chest, hich showed no acute aortic dissection with
unchanged focal type A dissection as in [**2192**], as well as an
interval thrombosis of the majority of the previous Type B
thoracic dissection, with increase in size and tortuosity of the
descending aorta to 5.5cm. There was no pulmonary embolus seen
on CTA. His blood pressure on arrival to the OSH was 178/92 and
169/89 in the right and left arms; he received morphine and
labetalol at that time for blood pressure control. He was
subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Cardiac surgery was consulted at the time, which recommended
vascular surgery consultation as well as blood pressure
management. While on the vascular surgery service, his systolic
blood pressure was tightly controlled with anti-hypertensives
within the SBP 90-120mmHg range. He was placed on his home
anti-hypertensive medications at the same dosages on the day of
discharge and tolerated it well by maintaining  blood pressures
in the 90s-110s and baseline HR in the low 50s. The patient
remained asymptomatic while sitting up and ambulating.

Pulmonary: The patient was stable from a pulmonary standpoint;
vital signs were routinely monitored. There was no pulmonary
embolus seen on the CTA. Upon discharge, the patient was
oxygenating well on room air.

GI/GU: Post-operatively, the patient was given IV fluids until
tolerating oral intake. His diet was advanced appropriately,
which was tolerated well. His foley was removed on hospital day
4. Intake and output were closely monitored.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during
this stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as
possible.

At the time of discharge on hospital day 4, the patient was
doing well, stable vital signs with good blood pressures in the
90s-120smmHg, tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding
without assistance, with well-controlled pain.

Discharge Disposition:
Home

Discharge Diagnosis:
Enlarging thoracic aortic dissection, Type B


Discharge Condition:
Mental status: alert, oriented. Cooperative with plan of care
Ambulatory status: ambulating independently.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for evaluation of your thoracic aortic
dissection in light of your back pain symptoms. You underwent a
CT-scan of your chest, which showed an increase in the
dissection. You were managed with blood-pressure lowering
medications to keep your systolic blood pressure range between
90-120mmHg.

There were no interventions performed during your hospital stay,
and a discussion regarding endovascular stenting did take place.
However, evaluation for this was deferred at this time given
your wishes to avoid further intervention.

You will be sent home on your home medications with the same
dosages previous to admission. They are listed in your
post-discharge medication list.



Followup Instructions:
Please follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 2
weeks; you may call his clinic at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1393**] to schedule an
appointment.

Please follow-up or call your PCP within the next two weeks to
discuss your recent hospitalization.
