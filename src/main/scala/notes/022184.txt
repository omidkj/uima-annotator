Service:  Medicine

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old
female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, peripheral vascular disease, and a history of a left
lung nodule admitted from an outside hospital Intensive Care
Unit ([**Hospital3 **]) with hypotension, fever, and recurrent
pneumonia.

In brief, the patient has a long history of recurrent
bronchitis and periodic episodes of pneumonia.  She was
admitted to an outside hospital approximately a few week
prior to the current presentation with pneumonia and was
treated with an unknown antibiotic.  Unfortunately, she
returned to the outside hospital's Emergency Department on
[**1-13**] with fever, rigors, dizziness, and weakness.
When her blood pressure could not be obtained in her upper
extremities, she was started on dopamine and transferred to
the Intensive Care Unit and underwent a CT of the abdomen to
rule out abdominal aortic aneurysm, which was negative.
Chest x-ray revealed right lower lobe pneumonia, and the
patient was placed on vancomycin, gentamicin, and Zosyn.
Additionally, chest x-ray showed left lung nodule (old) and
right hilar mass.  She was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 1444**] medical intensive care unit
on [**1-15**] on dopamine.

On arrival to the [**Hospital1 69**] her
blood pressure (via the right thigh cuff) was 127/60, whereas
arm pressures were considerably lower at 60/20 in right arm
and 40/20 in the left arm.  Arm pressures were though
secondary to subclavian disease, and dopamine was
successfully weaned based on thigh blood pressures.
Antibiotics were changed from vancomycin, gentamicin, and
Zosyn to levofloxacin and Flagyl.  The patient has been
saturating well on nasal cannula oxygen while in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.  Chest CT scheduled to further evaluate
left lung nodule and right hilar mass.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic smoker
with recurrent bronchitis and pneumonia times five in the
last 10 years.
2.  Peripheral vascular disease, bilateral subclavian
stenosis, bilateral carotid disease (50% on the right and 80%
on the left), arm claudication.  Negative cardiac
catheterization in [**2118**].
3.  Left lung nodule (about 4 cm).
4.  Cluster headaches times 18 years.
5.  Hyperlipidemia.
6.  Glaucoma.
7.  Status post partial hysterectomy.

ALLERGIES:  IODINE (anaphylaxis).

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  Medications in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] included
enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., prednisone 40 mg
p.o. q.d., albuterol meter-dosed inhaler, Atrovent
meter-dosed inhaler, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor,
levofloxacin, and Flagyl.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives with son.  Smoking history times 55
years; one and a half to two packs per day, quit in [**2121-12-2**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On admission vital
signs were afebrile, blood pressure 151/83, pulse of 106,
respiratory rate of 22, oxygen saturation of 92% to 96% on 3
liters nasal cannula.  General appearance revealed alert, in
no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
revealed pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.
Oropharynx was clear.  Extraocular movements were intact.
Neck was supple, no bruits.  Lungs revealed decreased breath
sounds at the right base.  Heart was mildly tachycardic, a
regular rhythm.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended, normal active bowel sounds.  Extremities
revealed no edema.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory data
included white blood cell count of 11.3, hematocrit of 41.2,
platelets of 449.  Chem-7 was normal.  INR of 1.  Legionella
urine antigen negative.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Chest CT revealed two suspicious lung
nodules identified in the left lung; one at the left apex
measuring 2.7 cm in greatest dimension with features
characteristic of adenocarcinoma with bronchoalveolar
features.  The second lesion is in the left lower lobe
measuring about 1 cm in diameter and located at the
bifurcation of the posterior and lateral segment bronchi.
This could reflect either a second primary lung cancer; or,
given its location at the bifurcation of the bronchi, a
carcinoid tumor.  In addition, the CT revealed ill-defined
peribronchial nodules in the right lower lobe with associated
small airway disease, likely due to resolving pneumonia.
Additionally, there were small nodules in the right upper
lobe which could also be an inflammatory/infectious, but tiny
fossae of metastatic disease were not excluded.  A direct
comparison to outside CT will be most helpful.  This CT also
revealed thickening of the posterior wall of the right upper
lobe bronchus, possibly related to reactive lymph nodes given
other findings in the right lung but comparison to outside
study would be helpful.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 76-year-old female with a
history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peripheral
vascular disease, left lung nodule, and a long history of
tobacco use presenting with pneumonia and hypotension, likely
secondary to subclavian vascular disease and was stable for
transfer to the medical floor from the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

The patient was treated with levofloxacin and Flagyl for her
pneumonia for a total course of 10 days.  Her chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease was treated with albuterol, and
Atrovent, and prednisone taper.

Pulmonary was consulted and recommended a CT-guided biopsy of
the left lung nodule which was concerning for bronchogenic
carcinoma.  The patient agreed to CT-guided biopsy but was
currently on aspirin.  The patient was then scheduled for
outpatient biopsy of lung nodule for the following week.  The
patient was to stay off aspirin until biopsy date and will be
n.p.o. after midnight the day prior to biopsy.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Pneumonia.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Prednisone taper.
2.  Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d. (total 10-day course).
3.  Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. (total 10-day course).
