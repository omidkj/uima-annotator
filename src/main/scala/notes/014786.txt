Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC placement

History of Present Illness:
81F with h/o severe bronchiectasis, followed in pulmonary clinic
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], admitted with dyspnea.
.
Pt notes increasing dyspnea over past week, along with chronic
cough, no frank change in sputum production, but increased
cough.  She uses 2-3L home O2, but has been using up to 4L
recently.  She was seen by chest PT, which has been her daily
routine, and today was noted to be markedly tachypneic and more
hypoxic (90%4L, usually mid 90s%4L by report).  She declined
referall to the ED, and was therefore direct admitted to the
medicine floor.
.
Upon arrival to the medical floor, VS notable for fever 100.8,
RR 45-50 (my count).  she is tachypneic, speaking in [**12-20**] word
sentences, and admits to dyspnea, worse than baseline.  Lung
exam is roncherous, with green/yellow sputum.   She denies chest
pain, orthopnea, lower extremity edema, but beleives her weight
has been increasing over the past few days.  She has been taking
her lasix daily, but does not know her dry weight.  CXR showed
no focal infiltrate, but was reveiewed with her pulmonary
fellow, and felt c/w bronchiectasis.  No significant pulmonary
edema.  ECG is paced, with negative sgarbossa criteria (h/o afib
s/p av ablation, s/p PM).  JVP was elevated 10-12cm at 90
degrees.
.
She was treated with albuterol nebulizers x 2, atrovent x1,
without improvement.  ABG was obtained 7.45/44/55 on 4-5L O2.
Given toxic appearance, she was given iv cefepime, and ordered
for vanco/levo after disscussion with pulmonary fellow, though
sputum cultures in past have always shown psuedomonas always
sensitive to levaquin.  She also received 20mg iv lasix, and
foley was ordered placed.  Code status was reviewed with the
patient, and her son, and she confirmed DNR/DNI status, but
would consider BiPaP.  MICU consult was obtained, and although
she had improved slightly (now speaking in [**2-19**] word sentences),
given her tenuous pulmonary status, tachypnea, she was brought
to the MICU.

STUDIES:
[**2139-4-1**] CXR:
CHEST, PA AND LATERAL: The lungs are again hyperexpanded, with
diffuse
bronchiectasis. Globally increased reticulonodular markings
likely represent acute exacerbation of disease, with mucoid
impaction of small airways. Right atrial and ventricular
pacemaker courses in expected position. The cardiomediastinal
silhouette and hilar contours are normal, with changes of CABG
and tricuspid annuloplasty. There are no pleural effusions or
pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Acute on chronic bronchitis.

CXR:
FINDINGS: Radiodense guidewire of right PICC terminates just
below the
expected cavoatrial junction. Widespread areas of bronchiectasis
and
bronchiolitis are again demonstrated as well as developing areas
of
superimposed consolidation, particularly in the right upper and
both lower
lobes. This could reflect an acute bacterial pneumonia
superimposed upon the
patient's reported history of chronic MAC infection.
Asymmetrical hilar
enlargement, right greater than left, is in keeping with known
lymphadenopathy
detected on prior chest CTA which also demonstrated evidence of
mediastinal
lymphadenopathy.

Brief Hospital Course:
81F with h/o systolic CHF, severe bronchiectasis, on 2L O2 at
baseline, admitted from chest PT with tachypnea, hypoxia, and
fever.

initial concerning was for infection given fever, roncherous
breath sounds, and underlying severe pulmonary disease.  ddx
also included systolic congestive heart failure, given initially
elevated JVP, and patient's report of increased weight over past
few days (last recorded weight 98 lb in [**12-28**] cardiology note, pt
reports baseline weight 90s, currently 105.7lbs on admission),
and less likely PE given above exam.

upon arrival to the medical floor, pt was febrile to 101,
tahypneic to 40s-50s, speaking in 1 word sentences, using
accessory muscles, and in distress.  ABG notable for hypoxemia
in setting of 4-5L O2 (PO2 55), but more cocerning for PCO2 44
in setting of RR=40-50.  she was not a significant chronic
