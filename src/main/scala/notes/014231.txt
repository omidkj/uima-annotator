Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2840**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Arterial line placement [**2195-4-19**]

History of Present Illness:
87 yo F wtih a history of COPD on chronic steroids, Dementia
(nonverbal baseline), and recent admission for pneumonia
requiring intubation, influenza and UTI who was BIBA from [**Hospital 100**]
Rehab for worsening dyspnea and productive cough. Duration is
unclear, and patient unable to provide history. Today she was
found to be 87% on 4L at 10 pm, and came up to 98% on NRB. She
was given atrovent neb, albuterol neb, and morphine 4 mg SL
without much effect. Prior to transfer VS were 99.8 (rectal),
118/76, 104, 42, 95% RA.
.
On arrival to the ED, patient was intubated. Patient had a CXR
consistent with interstitial edema versus infection, stable
since prior study. She was treated with vancomycin, and ordered
for zosyn but this was not given prior to transfer. She received
propafol, etomidate 30 mg IV x1 and succinylcholine 120 mg IV x1
peri-intubation. After intubation she was started on fentanyl
and versed drips. On transfer, VS were 98.4, 99, 99/61, with
vent settings of TV 450 cc, RR 16, PEEP 5, 100% FiO2.  EKG
showed sinus tachycardia with peaked t waves, but K was normal.
WBC was elevated at 22.  She received 1litres of fluid. Prior to
transfer, VS were 98.4, 101, 92/58, 14, 100%.
.
Of note, patient was admitted [**4-6**] to [**4-13**] with influenza, hcap
and UTI. She required intubation in the ICU and was treated with
oseltamivir, azithro, vanco and meropenem. During this hospital
stay family was reluctant to change code status because
daughter/hcp was away on vacation.
.
In the MICU, patient is intubated and sedated.
.
Review of systems:
limited by patient being on ventilator. appears comfortable

   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2195-4-22**]):
      RARE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
      Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an
abbreviated
      workup will be performed appropriate to the isolates
recovered from
      this site.
      YEAST.    SPARSE GROWTH.
      STAPH AUREUS COAG +.    SPARSE GROWTH.
         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.
      GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).    RARE GROWTH.
