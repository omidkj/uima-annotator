HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 35121**] is a 50-year-old
gentleman status post MVA in [**2123**] with a left carotid injury.
The patient is status post carotid reimplantation.  Previous
operative records are unavailable for this procedure.  The
patient was referred to thoracic clinic two weeks prior to
admission complaining of worsening hoarseness, new onset left
arm numbness and tingling.  CT scan at outside hospital
showed a large mediastinal mass.  MRI on [**8-6**] showed a
complex pseudoaneurysm rising from the anterior aspect of the
ascending aorta with deviation of the trachea and superior
vena cava to the right.  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 1444**] for evaluation of the
pseudoaneurysm.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Status post CVA in the distribution
of left MCA after initial carotid surgery with residual right
hemiparesis.  2) Status post MVA in [**2123**].  3) Status post
left carotid repair in [**2123**].  4) Status post right knee
surgery in [**2130**].  5) Status post appendectomy.  6) History of
seizure disorder.  7) History of depression.  8) History of
remote ETOH abuse.  9) Two year history of weight loss.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin 200 mg po bid q o d alternating with
200 mg po q a.m. and 300 mg po q p.m. q o d, Klonopin 0.5 mg

Patient's weight on admission noted to be 43 kg.  White blood
count 8.8, hematocrit 39, platelet count 311,000, sodium 136,
potassium 3.7, chloride 96, CO2 27, BUN 6, creatinine 0.9.
Echocardiogram showed preserved LV function without
significant valvular pathology.

HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Intensive
Care Unit for strict blood pressure control.  The patient was
started on Esmolol drip.  Arterial catheter was placed for
blood pressure monitoring.  On [**8-7**] the patient underwent a
thoracic aortogram which showed a pseudoaneurysm arising from
the interior ascending aorta.  The left subclavian artery
filled via cross net collaterals.  The left internal carotid
arteries filled retrograde via the circle of [**Location (un) 431**]. There
was an occluded origin of the left common carotid artery and
the left subclavian artery.   On hospital day #4 vascular
surgery was consulted for a possible left femoral axillo
bypass to restore flow to the left upper extremity.  On
hospital day #5 the patient underwent a thoracic and
abdominal aortogram to assess patency of lower extremity
vasculature.  The thoracic aortogram showed a 2 cm
pseudoaneurysm arising from the ascending aorta.  The
abdominal aortogram showed fusiform aneurysmal dilatation of
right common iliac with diffuse ectasia of left common iliac
artery, left femur bony abnormality which was likely myositis
ossificans and no significant lower extremity atherosclerotic
disease.  After patient returned from the test, the patient
was transferred to the floor.  On [**8-11**] the patient was taken
to the operating room for a left femoral axilla bypass graft
by vascular surgery.  Please see operative note for further
details.  The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care
Unit after the procedure in stable condition with palpable
radial and dorsalis pedis pulses.  On hospital day #7, [**8-12**], a
GI consult was obtained for placement of a PEG secondary to
patient's poor nutritional status.  The patient's albumin at
that time was noted to be 3.0 and he was 62% of his ideal
body weight.  On [**2151-8-13**] a PEG was placed without difficulty
by GI service.  At that time a biopsy of the second portion
of duodenum was obtained and sent.  That specimen was within
normal limits.  The EGD showed a normal esophagus, normal
stomach and normal duodenum.  After placement of the PEG, the
patient was transferred to the floor.  Tube feeds were
started via the PEG and patient was started on high caloric
po intake.  Repair of the pseudoaneurysm was postponed until
later that month to improve patient' nutritional status.
Physical therapy was consulted to work with patient, increase
ambulation.  During the two weeks that the patient remained
in the hospital, inspite of full nutritional support,
patient's weight remained flat between 43 and 45 kg.  On [**8-30**]
the patient was transferring himself from the bed to the
chair and sustained a fall, subsequently complained of a
headache with a non focal neurologic exam.  CAT scan was
obtained of his head secondary to the fall.  The CAT scan
showed no evidence of an acute bleed or acute process and a
large left side region of encephalomalacia corresponding to a
large old infarct in the distribution of the left MCA.  On
[**8-31**] the patient was taken to the operating room for repair
of his ascending aortic pseudoaneurysm by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].
Please see operative note for further details.  The patient
was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit intubated and in
stable condition after the procedure.  Cultures were taken in
the operating room from the area of the pseudoaneurysm which
were negative for any growth.  Portions of the pseudoaneurysm
were sent for pathology evaluation which showed fragments of
organized thrombus with chronic inflammation, otherwise
negative.

The patient was weaned and extubated on postoperative day #1,
hemodynamically stable.  Chest tubes were removed on
postoperative day #2.  The patient remained in the Intensive
Care Unit for diuresis and blood pressure control.  The
patient was transferred to the floor on postoperative day #3.
Postoperative day #4 the patient had a witnessed tonic clonic
seizure lasting between 1 and 3 minutes.  The patient was
given Valium, intubated and transferred to the SICU where he
had another tonic clonic seizure, again lasting between 1 and
3 minutes.  The patient was administered Ativan at this time.
Patient's Dilantin level upon admission to the Intensive Care
Unit was 8.7.  A bolus of Dilantin was given and a neuro
consult was obtained.  The patient was weaned and extubated
on the evening of postoperative day #4.  The patient was
transferred to the floor on postoperative day #5 with a
Dilantin level of 14.  The patient was restarted on his tube
feeds and physical therapy was resumed.  The patient was
reported to be intermittently more lethargic but easily
arousable and oriented.  On [**9-9**], postoperative day #8, the
patient again with a witnessed tonic clonic seizure, again
patient was intubated and transferred to the SICU after being
treated with Ativan and given extra Dilantin.  The patient
was easily weaned and extubated later that day.  Neurology
consult recommended resuming patient's preoperative dosing of
Dilantin which was done and resuming patient's preoperative
Klonopin to control breakthrough seizures.  The patient was
transferred to the floor later that day.  On postoperative
day #9 the patient fell, getting himself out of a chair and
subsequently complained of right knee pain.  An orthopedic
consult was obtained.  X-ray of his right knee was obtained
which showed a patellar defect and avulsion of the proximal
medial pole.  Orthopedics felt that no treatment was
necessary since the patient was subsequently asymptomatic and
the patient had a history of previous right knee trauma.  On
postoperative day #11 in the early morning the patient was
noted to have increased work of breathing and a decreased
oxygen saturation.  Chest x-ray was obtained which showed
moderate t
