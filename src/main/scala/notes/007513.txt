Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
pancreatitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation x 2
extubation x 1
tracheostomy placement

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 77 yo woman with a history of ovarian cancer
who presented to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital on [**2193-2-26**] with left chest
pain/COPD exacerbation. A chest CT on admission showed a large
complex mass between the stomach and pancreas. She was receiving
treatment for a COPD flare (cetriaxone, azithromycin,
prednisone, alb/atrov nebs/morphine) with a plan for outpatient
evaluation of this mass when she developed a sudden onset of
severe abdominal pain on hospital day 4, with a lipase >[**2181**].
She has had several CT scans and an MRI which show that the mass
is complex, and from what they can see, doesn't seem to be the
source of pancreatitis. Most recent CT continues to show severe,
necrotizing pancreatitis. They are unable to biopsy mass due to
pancreatitis. GI there thinks she needs an EUS to evaluate the
mass and to see if it is somehow implicated in this severe
pancreatitis.  She has no history of ETOH abuse, and no
gallstones. She has been afebrile and has not received
antibiotics. She had a PICC placed for initiation of TPN.

Of note, her hospital course has been complicated by a fall,
resulting in an anculated and displaced wrist fracture. She
underwent a closed reduction of the wrist fracture under local
anesthetic. She was transferred here for a possible EUS for
further evaluation of pancreatic mass in the setting of acute
necrotizing pancreatitis.

PERTINENT IMAGING STUDIES:
[**2193-3-8**] CXR: No previous images. Left subclavian PICC line
extends to at least the upper portion of the SVC where it is
difficult to assess in the
mediastinum. Low lung volumes may account for some of the
prominence of central vessels.  However, there is some increased
opacification in the retrocardiac region on the left with poor
definition of the hemidiaphragm. This raises the possibility of
lower lobe pneumonia and possible effusion.
.
[**2193-3-11**] CTA Torso: 1. Peripancreatic fluid collections and
inflammation consistent with a known underlying pancreatitis
with no significant pancreatic necrosis identified. High-density
material is present within a "pseudocyst" projecting off the
pancreatic tail into the lesser sac and is consistent with
internal hemorrhage. The amount of blood within the cyst is
essentially unchanged dating back to [**2193-2-27**] exam and
would not account for recent hematocrit drop. There is
suggestion of a possible small residual pseudoaneurysm off the
splenic artery measuring 3-4 mm. This may self thrombose, but
depending on patient's clinical status a dedicated angiogram
could be performed (would recommend waiting until at least
tomorrow given the high contrast dose of current exam). The
vasculature remains patent without any thrombosis.
2. Interval increase in size to moderate left and small right
pleural
effusions result in near complete atelectasis of the left lower
lobe and
partial atelectasis of the right lower lobe. Interval increase
in amount of intra-abdominal and pelvic ascites as well as
degree of soft tissue anasarca.
3. Bilateral hypoattenuating renal lesions, some of which are
too small to
characterize and others which are clearly simple cysts,
unchanged from outside exams.
4. Tip of OG tube within the gastric antrum.
.
[**2193-3-13**] LENIs: Limited examination due to soft tissue edema and
swelling. Among the calf veins, only the left posterior tibial
veins were seen. No DVT seen within visualized vessels.
.
[**2193-3-13**] RUQ U/S: No ultrasound evidence of cholecystitis.
.
CXR [**2193-3-15**]: Dense opacification at the left lung base is
probably due to a combination of small left pleural effusion and
substantial left lower lobe atelectasis, given leftward
mediastinal shift, rather than pneumonia. Mild cardiac
enlargement is stable. Upper lungs are clear of consolidation,
but there is still mild residual left perihilar edema, and the
hilar vasculature is still dilated. ET tube and right internal
jugular line, left PIC catheter are in standard placements.
Nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view. No
pneumothorax.
.
[**2193-3-18**] Wrist x-ray: In comparison with study of [**3-5**], overlying
cast greatly obscures detail. There appears to be some increased
bone formation about the previously described fracture of the
distal radius with continued separation of the ulnar styloid
process.
.
[**2193-3-18**] Head CT:  No evidence of an acute intracranial
abnormality.
.
[**2193-3-18**] CT Torso:
1. Interval development of large right lateral abdominal
wall/flank
extraperitoneal hematoma. Active extravasation cannot be
assessed without
