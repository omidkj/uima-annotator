OM and the PDA.  Cross-clamp time was 84 minutes, total
bypass time 113 minutes.  She was transferred to the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit on Neo-Synephrine, dobutamine, and
propofol.

She had a stable postoperative night, she was extubated.  Her
dobutamine was weaned off.  Then she remained on
Neo-Synephrine.  This was weaned off on postoperative day
two, and her chest tubes were discontinued.  She did slowly
progress, but she got very confused and agitated and was
delirious.  She required Haldol.  She eventually became
reoriented, and she also had epicardial pacing wires
discontinued on postoperative day #3.
