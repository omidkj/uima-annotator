History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 724**] is a 72 year old Cantonese-speaking male brought in
from rehab for respiratory distress. History is limited as the
patient is cantonese speaking only. In the ED, his vital signs
were stable, and he was maintaining adequate oxygen saturation,
but he was intubated for increased work of breathing and a NG
tube was placed for feeding. A CXR was performed whichi showed
no signficant signs of infiltrate or edema. The patient was
given solumedrol and combivent inhalers for possible COPD flare.
Lactate was within normal limits, there was no leukocytosis, and
the first set of cardiac enzymes were negative. The patient was
also given a dose of Levaquin for UTI on UA. The family was not
able to be contact[**Name (NI) **] in the [**Name (NI) **].
.
On review of his chart, notes from the rehab indicate that the
patient was noted to be congested and SOB, with O2 sats 87-94%
on 2 liters NC. The patient coughed up copious secretions as
well. He recently completed 5 day course of Ceftriaxone for UTI.
The patient was recommended for transfer to the ED for further
evaluation, also noted to be full code.
