Service:  [**Company 191**] MEDICINE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80-year-old woman
initially admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] from [**11-1**] through [**11-6**] on [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service following transfer from outside hospital for
evaluation of chest pain, ST elevation myocardial infarction, and
positive troponin. Catheterization on [**11-4**] showed three-
vessel coronary artery disease, severe systolic and diastolic
dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 27% (global
hypokinesis), and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.  CT
surgery was consulted at that time.  The patient deemed not a
surgical candidate secondary to co-morbidities.  A repeat cath on
[**11-6**] was performed with stenting of RCA.  The patient
was medically managed and was discharged to [**Hospital **] Rehab on
[**11-6**].

The patient did well by report for 10 days after discharge, when
she was found dyspneic on day of [**Month (only) **].  She was initially
thought to be in failure and received IV lasix, Nitro paste and
ativan for agitation.  EKG at that time was without changes, and
her blood pressure was 200/100.  The patient's oxygen saturation
was 76% on room air and 85% on a nonrebreather mask.  She was
intubated in the field for this respiratory distress and hypoxia,
and was reported to have aspirated during this intubation.  By
report, she also had a change in mental status and was
unresponsive for 2 hours. Blood pressure following intubation was
reported as 40/18 on arrival to the Emergency Department.  She
was started on a dopa drip and propofol for sedation.  The
patient was started on treatment for pneumonia, as well, with
Levaquin, and was given fluid resuscitation.

Hematocrit 38.1, platelets 276.  Potassium 3.5, bicarbonate
34, creatinine 1.1, BUN 22.  Glucose 111.  Rest of
chemistries were normal.  ALT 104, AST 118, alk phos 126,

small blood, positive nitrites, trace protein, trace glucose,
trace leukocyte esterase, 0-2 red blood cells, [**7-2**] white
blood cells, moderate bacteria, 0-2 epithelial cells.  Blood
gas on intubation--settings stated above - pH 7.51, PCO2 39,
PO2 122, lactate 1.0.  Microbiology - urine and blood
cultures drawn.  Head CT showed age-related atrophy, chronic
microvascular infarction, no bleed, or acute changes.  Chest
x-ray showed diffuse patchy right-sided opacities, loss of
right hemidiaphragm, and small left pleural effusion.  EKG -
normal sinus rhythm at 85 beats per minute, normal axis,
right bundle branch block, Q waves in II, AVF and V5/V6.  T
wave inversions II, III, AVF.  No ST segment changes, PVC.
These were not significant changes from [**11-7**] EKG.

The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was 20 days long.  She was
initially admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 12573**] Intensive Care Unit on
[**11-17**] and was transferred to the medical floor on
[**11-20**] with return to the [**Hospital Ward Name 12573**] ICU on [**11-25**],
transferred to [**Company 191**] Medicine service on [**12-4**], and
discharged on [**12-6**].

HOSPITAL COURSE - 1) RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Etiologies of hypoxia
and respiratory failure were thought to be aspiration
pneumonitis, pneumonia (community acquired/aspiration), versus
flash pulmonary edema.  The patient was weaned within 2 days off
of the ventilator, and was stabilized on nasal cannula oxygen.
Upon transfer to the floor, the patient initially remained
stable, however, had intermittent hypoxic episodes with
hypercarbia.  A blood gas on [**11-24**] showed a pH of 7.32, PCO2
81, PO2 127, and serum bicarbonate in the high-30s.  It was
unclear why the patient was hypercarbic, and a repeat head CT was
obtained with no acute changes.  The patient was closely
monitored throughout the day, and a repeat blood gas later on
[**11-24**] indicated improvement, with a pH of 7.37 and a PCO2 of
65.  However, later that evening the patient was found in her
room by the RN hypoxic and cyanotic with oxygen saturation in the
50s on nasal cannula.  A code blue was called, and the patient
was intubated by anesthesia on site, and was transferred to the
[**Hospital Ward Name 12573**] Intensive Care Unit.  Blood gas at that time showed a
pH of 7.13, PCO2 92, PO2 152 with a lactate of 3.9.  This was
prior to intubation.  Postintubation blood gas showed pH
7.34, PCO2 71, PO2 112.  Etiology of worsened respiratory
status thought to be likely due to recurrent aspiration and
hypoventilation.  Please see below for pneumonia course.

The patient was slowly weaned off of ventilator for this second
intubation during this hospitalization, and was extubated on
[**12-3**], on day prior to floor transfer. During last days of
[**Month (only) **], the patient was stable on 3 liters nasal cannula with
good oxygen saturations greater than 95%.

2) PNEUMONIA:  The patient thought to initially have presented
with community acquired pneumonia with likely aspiration, as
reported by EMS team upon arrival.  The patient was treated with
21 days of Levofloxacin during this [**Month (only) **].  In addition, she
received 10 days of clindamycin for aspiration.  On [**11-27**],
the patient was started on vancomycin treatment for a sputum that
grew out MRSA.  On day of discharge, the patient was on day [**11-5**]
of vancomycin course.

The patient's blood and urine cultures during [**Month/Year (2) **] were
persistently negative.  Her initial presentation with sepsis and
hypotension quickly resolved with the ability to wean pressor
support within initial 24 hours of [**Month/Year (2) **].  The patient never
required pressors throughout the rest of her hospital stay.  The
patient is at constant risk for aspiration, as determined by two
swallow evaluations performed during this [**Month/Year (2) **].  The patient
has a silent aspiration with decreased ability to cough.  The
patient is at risk for further aspiration pneumonias and
precautions should be taken upon discharge.

3) CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  Echocardiogram was performed twice
