Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1406**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Aortic valve replacement with a 25-mm St. [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 923**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4041**]
    tissue valve, reference number [**Serial Number **],  serial number
    [**Serial Number 83899**].

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 83900**] who is an 86-year-old male with past medical
history of atrial fibrillation, First and second-degree
Wenckebach AV block, severe aortic valve stenosis, systolic
congestive heart failure, presents with worsening dyspnea on
exertion and need of tissue AVR scheduled for [**2127-4-21**] presenting
to CCU for aspirin desensitization. His history of aspirin
"allergy" was from >40 yrs ago where he reports ?shortness of
breath, but unclear if had true anaphylaxis- regardless he was
told not to ever take the drug again. From an AS standpoint, he
was not deemed high enough surgical risk for Core Valve and thus
given his progression of symptoms with dyspnea with minimal
exertion, decision was made to proceed with AVR. Cardiac surgery
was consulted for evaluation of aortic valve replacement.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Moderate 2 vessel coronary artery disease with diffuse
atherosclerosis.
2. Mild pulmonary arterial hypertension.
3. Reinforce secondary preventative measures against CAD.
4. Additional plans per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Doctor Last Name 171**].
5. Would advocate ASA desensitization in CVICU post-AVR so that
patient
can be discharged on aspirin 81mg daily rather than clopidogrel.

6. F/U with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 171**].
.
[**4-21**] CXR:
Since the prior study, there is interval progression of
bilateral interstitial opacities most likely representing
chronic interstitial lung disease, potentially fibrosis. Heart
size and mediastinum are unchanged including cardiomegaly. No
pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The lung volumes are
low. Assessment of the patient with chest CT for precise
characterization of the severity and extent of pulmonary
abnormalities might be considered.

[**4-27**] CXR:
The left lower chest tube has been removed. The left upper chest

tube is still in place. There is a small left apical
pneumothorax, similar in size compared to the study from the
prior day. Mild pulmonary vascular
redistribution and volume loss in both lower lobes. Sternal
wires are again visualized.

[**4-28**] CXR:


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 83900**] presented to CCU on [**2127-4-21**] for aspirin
desensitization. On [**2127-4-23**] he was taken to the operating room
and underwent the following:Aortic valve replacement with a
25-mm St. [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 923**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4041**] tissue valve,Coronary artery bypass
grafting times 1 with left internal mammary artery to left
anterior descending artery.CROSS-CLAMP TIME: 85 minutes. PUMP
TIME: 98 minutes. He tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred to the CVICU intubated and sedated in critical but
stable condition. He was initially requiring Phenylephrine with
sedation. He awoke neurologically intact and was weaned to
extubation early on POD#1. Pressor support was weaned off and
gentle diuresis begun. No beta-blockers initiated due to the
patient's history of first and second degree AV block. Pacing
wires were removed on POD#2 and he was started on coumadin for
pre-op a-fib. He was transferred to the floor on POD#2 with
chest tubes in place.  A PICC line was placed for intravenous
access.  On post-operative day number 3, the patient remained
hemodynamically stable with pAF. Coumadin therapy was continued.
 The foley catheter was discontinued and the patient was started
on Cipro for a positive UA, urine culture was pending ([**4-26**]
results showed yeast). The patient sternal incision showed a
small amount of seroud drainage, and he was started on Kefzol.
Chest tubes were discontinued on post-op day 4 without
complication.  Decreased steranl drainaeg, the Kefzol was
discontinued.  The urine culture only showed yeast, and the
Cipro was also discontinued.  Lopressor was discontinued for
intermittent Type II heart block.  Continue to hold beta
blockers.

The patient INR is 2.2 today ([**2127-4-28**]), and he is
hemodynamically stable.  He will be dischared on Lasix 80mg IV
BID x 7 days for his CXR and peripheral edema.  Follow-up in
wound clinic in one week.  The PICC line will remain in place
upon discharge to rehabilitation, the rehab center will be
advised to discontinue the PICC line once the course of IV Lasix
is complete.  It is felt that he is safe to be discharged to New
[**Hospital 83901**] rehabilitation center in [**Location (un) 246**] on POD #5.
