.
Cardiac Cath [**2-5**]
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal left and right ventricular diastolic function.
3. Moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension.
4. Successful bifurcation stenting of the LAD and D1 with
Culotte
technique with Endeavor DES
.
Echo [**2-6**]
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened with trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Low normal left
ventricular systolic function. Preserved right ventricular
systolic function.
.
CT Head [**2-7**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No CT evidence of acute vascular territorial infarction. If
this is of significant clinical concern, further evaluation with
MRI with diffusion- weighted imaging is suggested as this is
more sensitive for ischemia.
2. Opacification and fluid levels of the paranasal sinuses may
be related to intubation.
.
CT neck [**2-7**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Presence of the endotracheal tube which somewhat distorts
normal anatomy of the airway, limits evaluation for airway
narrowing, although none is definitely seen.
2. Dependent consolidation of both upper lungs may represent
aspiration or pneumonia.
3. Extensive atherosclerotic calcification of the aortic arch


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient presented with respiratory distress and was nasally
intubated in the field, no reported chest pain, however
concerning for ACS given positive cardiac enzymes.  She was
taken to the cardiac cath lab where she had bifurcation stenting
of the LAD and D1.  Medical treatment included aspirin, plavix,
heparin drip, and statin.  She was not given a beta-blocker
because of bradycardia.  Echocardiogram did not show
significantly depressed cardiac function.
  In the setting of nasal intubation patient had nasopharyngeal
bleeding.  ENT was consulted and she was changed to oral
intubation with nasal packing.  Plans for extubation were
complicated by lack of consistent cuff leak.  She was given
steroids and had a CT scan of the neck which was difficult to
interpret with the ET tube in place.  After course of steroids,
she was extubated successfully but family chose to make patient
DNR/DNI understanding the risk of not reintubating patient.
Soon after she was made CMO.  She was maintained on mask oxygen
and was initially hypoxic after extubation however O2 sat
recovered.  In the evening after extubation patient became
asystolic and passed away.
  While patient intubated as well as post-extubation, patient
exhibited right-sided hemiparesis.  This was concerning for CVA.
 A head CT without contrast and CT neck did not show hemorrhage
or large ischemia to explain these findings.  An MRI was not
pursued given patient's clinical instability and lack of
therapeutic options.
