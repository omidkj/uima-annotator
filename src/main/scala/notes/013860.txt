Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2127-3-12**] for surgical
management of her coronary artery and aortic valve disease. She
was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner. Vein mapping was
obtained which did show some varicosities however there was
usuable vein. On [**2127-3-14**], she was taken to the operating room
where she underwent coronary artery bypass grafting and
replacement of aortic valve. Please see operative note for
details. In summary she had:
1. Aortic valve replacement [**Street Address(2) 6158**]. [**Hospital 923**] Medical Biocor tissue
valve.
2. Coronary artery bypass grafting x2 left internal mammary
artery graft to the marginal branch and reverse saphenous vein
graft to the posterior descending artery.
Her bypass time was 120 minutes with a crossclamp of 94 minutes.

Postoperatively she remained intubated and on epinephrine,
nitroglycerin and propofol and was taken to the intensive care
unit for ongoing post-operative management and monitoring. Due
to hemodynamic instability and friable aorta she was not weaned
from ventilator support. Sedation was lightened to assess
neurologic status and she was neurologically intact and
re-sedated to maintain hemodyanamic stability. She was noted to
have frequent APC's and later afib and was given IV amiodarone.
On POD#1 she was weaned to CPAP but became hyperdynamic
requiring nicardipine. She was re-sedated and placed back on
full vent support. She had low u/o and was volume resusitated
with crystalloid and colloid. On POD#2 CXR revealed volume
overload and was aggressively diuresed with a lasix drip. NGT
was noted to have coffee ground emesis and [**Hospital1 **] protonix was
started. Unable to wean pressors or wean f
