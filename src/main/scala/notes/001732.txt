Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1257**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation and mechanical ventilation
Trach placement
Bronchoscopy x2

History of Present Illness:
This is a 72-year-old gentleman with a history of HTN, DMII, CAD
s/p CABG in [**2154**] complicated by wound infection, repeat surgical
interventions requiring tracheostomy. The patiet developed
tracheal stenosis and now is status post cervical tracheal
resection and reconstruction that was subsequently complicated
by anastomotic necrosis and dehiscence, requiring reoperation
and t-tube placement. T-tube was removed and tubular silicone
y-stent placed with external fixation.  He was recently admitted
to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 20494**]/10 for a similar complaint of respiratory
distress. At that time, bronch revealed distal migration of the
stent exposing his areas of tracheal stenosis, resulting in
dyspnea. This was corrected with rigid bronch in the OR on [**3-4**]
with immediate resolution of symptoms.

Patient presented to the [**Location (un) **] ER on day of admission for 1
day of worsening SOB c/w previous stent migrations.  He did
report some difficulty bringing up secretions.  No fever, chest
pain, n/v, or diarrhea.  At the OSH ED, pation was observed to
be in respiratory distress with report of stridor.  He was given
nebs without improvement.  CXR showed left lung white-out.  He
was sedated and then intubated by anesthesia through his trach
stoma with a 7.0 ETT with improvement in his respiratory status.
 He was transferred here for further work-up by IP.

In the ED, initial VS were: T97.5, 155/59, 77, RR 20-24, O2sat
100% on PS 10/5, FiO2 60%.  Pt was in NAD, perhaps mild
increased WOB.  Coarse BS b/l.  Trach site draining
serosanguinous mucous.  Exam otherwise unremarkable.  Labs
notable for WBC 14, Creat 2.1 (baseline), CXR without obvious
consolidations, U/A neg with Foley in place.  EKG at baseline.
ETT slightly deep but aerating lungs well.  As unclear where
tracheal stenosis is, decided not to pull back.  IP aware and
plans to bronch on day after admission; patient admitted to MICU
overnight for monitoring.  On transfer, VS: afebrile, BP 158/68,
P 70, RR 12-16, O2sat 100% on PS 10/5, FiO2 50% with ABG
7.38/51/227/31.

In the ICU Mr. [**Known lastname 13144**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] bronchoscopy, with IP
performing stent removal during which a large amount of
inflammation/necrotic tissue thought secondary to intubation
through stoma with button hole which had pushed through tissue.
#7 tracheostomy tube placed.  He was subsequently weaned off the
vent on [**4-14**] AM and is now on humidified air through trach and
doing well. Of note, he did have moderate growth of MRSA on his
respiratory culture and started a course of vancomycin on [**4-13**],
which will go for a total of 8 days.
.
On arrival to the floor patient denied any SOB.  Only complaints
was sore throat from constant coughing and abdominal pain from
muscle strain (also from coughing).

ECG [**2155-4-11**]: Sinus rhythm with prolonged A-V conduction. Prior
inferior myocardial infarction. Possible prior anteroseptal
myocardial infarction. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2155-2-22**] there is no significant change.

Portable CXR [**2155-4-11**]: FINDINGS: Consistent with the given
history, tracheostomy tube is in place.  Subsegmental
atelectasis is seen in the left lung base. No focal
consolidation or superimposed edema is noted. There is calcified
plaque at the aortic arch. The cardiac silhouette is grossly
stable in size. No definite effusion or pneumothorax is noted.
Degenerative changes are seen throughout the thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION: Subsegmental left base atelectasis. No definite
consolidation or superimposed edema. Tracheostomy as above.

Portable CXR [**2155-4-13**]: FINDINGS: Comparison is made to previous
study from [**2155-4-11**].  Tracheostomy is identified. There is
tortuosity of thoracic aorta. There are no pneumothoraces or
focal consolidation. There is atelectasis at the left base.
Small left-sided pleural effusion is also seen and this is
unchanged.
