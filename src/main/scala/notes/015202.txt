EKG: sinus tach, NAD, LAE, no ST-seg changes

CXR [**9-10**]: Unchanged appearance of left pleural effusion.
Bibasilar atelectasis. No pneumothorax.

CT angio [**9-10**]: CTA CHEST W/O&W CONTRAST: Examination of the
pulmonary arterial tree failed to detected any intraluminal
filling defect that would suggest a pulmonary embolus. The heart
size is unchanged. Three vessel coronary artery and aortic
atherosclerotic calcifications are noted. There is no
pericardial effusion. Scattered mediastinal nodes are present in
the prevascular, AP window, paratracheal and subcarinal regions.
They are more prominent than in the prior study and measure up
to 1 cm in the short axis. A prominent right hilar node measures
up to 1.4 cm in the short axis. Post operative changes
compatible with left upper lobectomy are again noted. New
consolidations have developed in the left lower, right middle
and right lower lobes. There is no pleural effusion or
pneumothorax. There is no significant axillary lymphadenopathy.
Densely calcified nodules in the left breast remain similar in
appearance. The overlying skin thickening is similar in
appearance. The visualized upper abdominal viscera are
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:  1) No pulmonary embolus detected. 2) Bilateral
pneumonia. 3) The previously identified nodule in the right
lower lobe is obscured by the consolidation. The small nodule
along the right major fissure and the small nodule in the right
upper lobe have not significantly changed. 4) Left breast
calcification and skin thickening unchanged.

CXR [**9-11**]: Pneumonia increased since prior day.

CXR [**9-12**]: Increading bibasilar patchy LL infiltrates.  [**Month (only) 116**] be
secondary to poor inspiratory effort.

CXR [**9-13**]: PA and lateral chest radiographs again demonstrate
parenchymal opacities involving the right lower lobe and left
upper lobe. These are unchanged since the prior study. There is
improved technique on the current examination. There is no
evidence of failure. There are stable postoperative changes of
the left hemithorax and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.
IMPRESSION: Persistent consolidations in the right lower lobe
and left upper lobe not significantly changed from the exam of
one day prior.


Brief Hospital Course:
60 year old female with history of squamous cell lung ca s/p LUL
resection, breast cancer s/p lumpectomy/XRT, presented with SOB
x 5 days s/p trip to tahoe [**State **], associated with
fevers/chills, found to have a L pleural effusion and bilateral
consolidations.

1) ICU course: In the ED, RR 46, 93% 5L NC. Gvien cipro 500 mg,
insulin 5 U, KCL 40 meq, tyelenol, ceftriazxone 1 g, azithro 500
mg.  She was admitted to the ICU on [**2151-9-11**] for worsening
tachypnea with an ABG of 7.32/41/117 on NRB mask. She was also
noted to have an increased AG of 19 and blood sugars in the
300s, ketonuria, and was placed on an insulin drip. She was
started on BIPAP with aggressive pulmonary toilet. Urine
legionella was found to be positive. She was also given lasix
for her hypoxia. She was started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin
[**9-11**] to cover for CAP as well as legionella. She was also
started on prednisone for a suspected COPD component.

Repeat ABG on [**9-12**] was 7.31/49/110, however her respiratory
status was clinically improved (transitioned to NC) and she was
hemodynamically stable, therefore transferred to floors on
[**9-12**].

2) Pneumonia:  On the floors she continued to saturate around
95% on 2L O2 via NC.  We continued her ceftriaxone and zithromax
for treatment of legionella/community-acquired pneumonia, which
should be continued IV for another 8 days in order to complete a
14 day course.  We continued her steroids for the scheduled 3
doses, and then terminated them given the fact that her PFTs in
the past had been restrictive, and we didn't feel that COPD was
playing a significant role in her shortness of breath (her ABG
was indicative of acute CO2 retention rather than chronic, with
restrictive PFTs).  We did, however, continue nebulizer
treatments, as she said they help her.  She should have a repeat
chest x-ray in 3 weeks to assess resolution of her pneumonia.

3) Lung nodules:  She is known to have lung nodules on CT scan.
A repeat CT scan in house demonstrates that they are unchanged
since previous CT scan of [**8-23**] - being followed radiologically.
Continue outpatient follow up.

4) DM2:  Her diabetes was poorly controlled while in house,
probaby partially from the 3 doses of prednisone which has since
been discontinued.  We continued her metformin 1000mg qAM, 500
mg qPM, as well as her Pioglitazone 45 mg qday.  We discontinued
her glyburide and started lantus at night.  She is being
discharged on 12 U qhs, however this should be titrated up by 2
Units every 3 days as necessary so that she will not need more
insulin than the pm lantus on discharge.  She can be covered
with a sliding scale while at rehab.  She will follow up with
her endocrinologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital 882**] hospital as an
outpatient.

5) Anemia:  Her hematocrit was found to range from 32-36.  It
was stable.  She should have an outpatient colonoscopy and fecal
occult blood cards, as well as iron studies
