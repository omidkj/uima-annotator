Chief Complaint:
syncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization and placement of Bare Metal Stent in LAD


History of Present Illness:
In brief pt is 86F with COPD, diastolic CHF, DVT, RA and
multiple admissions in the past for syncope, who presents after
a syncopal episode. She was at the laundromat at the day of
admissoon when she experienced the usual prodrome, which is
weakness and lightheadedness,. She usually manages to sit down,
however this time she passed out and found her self surrounded
by EMS. She endorses progressive weakness and lightheadedness
over the past few weeks. She has not been evaluated by a
cardiologist and has not had a holter. Initially she denied CP
but lateron admitted to some chest pressure since her admission,
SOB.
.
In the ED was noted to be initially hypotensive to 80/40 wth
pulse 60 though the BP came up and remained stable for the
duration of the ED course. The patient was noted to be somnolent
and was intubated for airway protection as she was vomiting. CT
head, neck, abdomen, and pelvis WNL. No PE. X-Ray showing
Lateral malleolar fracture, seen by ortho to be conservatively
managed. Patient was than transferred to ICU, respriratory
function remained stable, blood pressure responded to fluids
(1.5 liter +) and did not require any further intervention.
During ICU stay patient had mild troponin elavation with normal
CK, new diffuse T wave inversions with old LBBB, and echo
suggestion new global systolic dysfunction. Patient called out
to floor, for further managment and evaluation of syncope.

[**2162-7-13**] - Right Ankle XR - Lateral malleolar fracture.
[**2162-7-13**] - CT C spine - No fracture or acute alignment
abnormality. These findings were posted to the ED dashboard at
approximately 2:30 p.m. on [**2162-7-13**].
[**2162-7-13**] - CT Head - 1. No fracture, hemorrhage, or evidence of
acute injury.
2. Chronic small-vessel ischemic disease.
3. Age-related involutional changes.
[**2162-7-13**] - CTA Chest/Abd/Pelvis -
1. No evidence of traumatic injury to the chest, abdomen, or
pelvis.
2. Stability over time of left adnexal cystic lesion favors a
benign etiology, although clinical correlation is advised.
3. No evidence of pulmonary embolus or aortic dissection.
[**2162-7-14**] - Echo
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with hypokinesis of the distal septum and apex. No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad.
Cardiac Catheterization - [**2162-7-16**]
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated single vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA was
patent.
The LAD had a 70% stenosis in the mid vessel. The LCX was
patent. The
RCA had a 50% stenosis in the mid vessel.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics were performed. The systemic
arterial
pressures were elevated measuring 177/78mmHg.
3. Successful PTCA/stent to mid LAD with a 2.5x18mm MiniVision
stent
deployed at 14atms. Excellent result with normal flow down
vessel and no
residual stenosis.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Elevated systemic arterial pressures.
3. Successful PTCA/stent to mid LAD with bare metal stent.
[**2162-7-17**] - RUQ US
No evidence of cholelithiasis or cholecystitis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 102770**] is an 86F with COPD, diastolic CHF, remote h/o DVT,
and RA who presents following an episode of chest tightness and
syncope found to have new wall motion abnormality and EKG
changes c/w ischemia, as well as an elevated troponin, now s/p
cardiac cath and placement of a BMS to LAD.

1)NSTEMI - She has had chest pressure intermittently during this
admission with dynamic T wave changes consistent with myocardial
ischemia. She also had an echocardiogram which showed new wall
motion abnormality.  She was taken to the cardiac cath lab for
further evaluation which showed a 70% LAD lesion which was
treated with a BMS.  She did well following cardiac
catheterization with no elevation of CK post cath.  She did have
a right groin hematoma post cath that was stable with no bruit
on exam.  She was continued on plavix, aspirin, atorvastatin and
metoprolol post cardiac cath.

2)Syncope: She has had multiple episodes of syncope over the
past several years with significant prodrome of nausea, vomiting
diaphoresis, blurry vision/lightheadedness. Most likely cause is
vasovagal syncope given her significant and predictable
prodrome.  DDX also include cardiac arrhythmia such as VT/VF or
bradyarrhythmia however this has not been seen on telemetry
during her current or prior admissions. No evidence of severe AS
or obstructive cardiomyopathy on Echo. Vertebrobasilar
insufficiency also possible as is adrenal insufficiency however
less likely given her normal electrolyte profile and normal CTA
head/neck in [**2161**]. In addition, she has not had any recent
changes in her prednisone dose.

3)Right ankle fracture: s/p fall, has been followed by
orthopedics with no current plan for surgery.  She has an
aircast splint and can weight bear as tolerated.  She has follow
up scheduled with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in clinic.  She was continued on
lovenox for VTE prophylaxis given that she is relatively
immobilized in the aircast splint.  She was discharged to rehab.


4)RUQ/R sided chest pain - Following her cardiac cath she had
several episodes of severe [**11-19**] pain on the R side of her chest
and upper abdomen bilaterally with associated nausea.  Given her
recent cath this was initially concerning for instent
thrombosis, however there was no evidence to support this on
EKG, vital signs remained stable, no pulsus paradoxus, CK
stable. Pain was reproducible with palpatin or RUQ/right lower
ribs. Pain/chest heaviness may also be due to volume overload in
setting of her diastolic dysfunction. She had LFT's that were
normal, RUQ ultrasound which did not show evidence of
cholelithiasis or cholecystitis. No evidence of RLE dvt. She is
also constipated with no BM in one week.  She was started on
protonix (given that she is on asa and prednision),
maalox/lidocaine and her bowel reg was titr
