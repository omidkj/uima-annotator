Chief Complaint:
hypotension, bacteremia

History of Present Illness:
53 year old male with history of chronic hepatitis C cirrhosis
complicated by variceal bleeding (grade [**1-9**]), ascites, and
refractory hepatic hydrothorax s/p TIPS who presented to OSH
with volume overload and abdominal pain and was found to be
hypotensive with positive blood cultures.  He presented to
[**State 20192**] Center [**2131-4-30**] with 25lb weight
gain despite reported compliance with diet and diuretics (lasix
had been discontinued on previous hospital admission due to
hypotension).  He also reported increasing pain in right upper
quadrant, midepigastric, and right chest as well as SOB and
abdominal distention.  He also reported subjective fevers and
chills.  Labs were significant for Cr 1.6 that peaked at 1.9;
WBC 12.2 that peaked at 17 with 20% bands; Hct 30.8, plts 80,
INR 1.4, Tbili 7.7 that peaked at 14.4, AST 144, ALT 61, albumin
1.6.  CXR showed opacified right hemithorax.  Abdominal
ultrasound showed cirrhosis with splenomegaly and ascites and
gallstones without evidence of ductal dilatation.  He underwent
paracentesis on [**2131-4-30**] with removal of 1100mL fluid removed
that was negative for SBP (WBC 140, 21% neuts, 60% lymphs, 48%
monocytes, 15% mesothelials).  Blood cultures from [**2131-4-30**] and
[**2131-5-1**] grew 3/4 bottles with GPCs in clusters for which he was
started on vancomycin.

Pt had recent complicated hospital course from [**Date range (3) 29730**]
for hepatic hydrothorax.  He initially presented to [**Hospital 28448**] Center where he was given IVFs for acute
kidney injury and underwent thoracentesis and paracentesis.  He
developed progressive SOB despite tx for presumed HCAP and was
found to have reaccumulation of hepatic hydrothorax and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for TIPS.  At [**Hospital1 18**], repeat paracentesis
was performed with 6L removed; repeat thoracentesis was
complicated by pneumothorax [**2-8**] trapped lung requiring chest
tube placement.  TIPS was performed on [**2131-3-15**] complicated by
failure to wean off mechanical ventilation immediately following
surgery.  He was extubated the following day and discharged on
home oxygen.  He was readmitted [**Date range (3) 29731**] for right sided
chest pain and hypotension worse than baseline.  He was [**Date range (3) 20003**]
out for ACS and referred for outpatient stress testing.  Since
then, he has had follow up with transplant for work-up of liver
transplant candidacy.

On arrival to the MICU, pt states that he feels generally well
but has RUQ/right chest pain.  States that he has had this pain
for 8-9months but it has gotten worse recently.  ROS also
positive for fevers (states he was febrile to 103 at home), mild
productive cough, weight gain of 25lbs, headache,
lightheadedness, rhinorrhea, diarrhea (4-5BMs daily on
lactulose), SOB.  He also notes some increasing confusion today.

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2131-5-2**]
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is
massive
progression of the previously extensive right pleural effusion.
The effusion now occupies the entire right hemithorax and to
displacement of the heart and the mediastinum to the left. No
ventilated lung parenchyma is visible in the right hemithorax.

On the left, there might be a small area of left perihilar
atelectasis.
Otherwise, the left lung parenchyma is unremarkable. There is no
left pleural effusion. No pulmonary edema or pneumonia is seen.
.
WRIST(3 + VIEWS) RIGHT PORT Study Date of [**2131-5-2**]
FINDINGS: There is mild irregularity of the radial styloid
process with
well-corticated margins, which likely represents old trauma.
Subtle linear lucency in the distal radius extending to the
radiocarpal articular surface, seen on 2 views, may represent a
nondisplaced fracture. Mineralization is slightly reduced about
the wrist. Alignment is anatomic. No significant soft tissue
swelling or definite joint effusion.

IMPRESSION: Possible nondisplaced distal radial fracture.
.
CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2131-5-3**]
CT THORAX: There is a massive right pleural effusion causing
complete
collapse of the right lung and shift of mediastinal structures
to the left.  The peripheral ground-glass opacity noted on CT on
[**2131-3-18**] is no longer visualized. However, there is now a
multifocal opacity involving the left upper lobe (2:20). The
left lung bronchi are patent to the subsegmental level.

There is no supraclavicular, axillary, or mediastinal
lymphadenopathy.
Evaluation of hilar lymphadenopathy is limited due to large
pleural effusion and lack of intravenous contrast. Several
coronary artery calcifications are noted (2:31). The heart and
great vessels are otherwise unremarkable.  Gynecomastia is seen
in the soft tissues of the thorax.

CT ABDOMEN: The liver is small, nodular, and a TIPS is in place,
consistent with known cirrhosis. There is a small amount of
ascites. Splenomegaly is unchanged. There is a large gallstone
(2:71), unchanged from [**2130-3-11**]. The stomach and small bowel are
unremarkable. The pancreas and adrenal glands are normal. There
is no evidence of hydronephrosis. There is a 15-mm cyst arising
from the lower pole of the left kidney. There is no free air.
Diffuse anasarca is seen in the soft tissues of the entire
torso.

CT PELVIS: The appendix is normal (2:94). There are several
sigmoid
diverticula without evidence of diverticulitis. A foley catheter
terminates in the bladder, which is collapsed. The rectum,
seminal vesicles, and prostate are unremarkable. There are tiny
fat-containing inguinal hernias.  There is no pelvic
lymp
