History of Present Illness:
This is a 57 year-old female with PHM of Still's disease who
presented initially to [**Location **] [**Location **] on [**1-14**] with
purpura, bleeding and found to be thrombocytopenic. Shee states
that prior to presentation, she noted a 5 day history of fever
and salmon colored rash. She had a biopsy on this rash on [**1-14**],
The fevers have been over 102 degrees, and have required around
the clock use of Motrin for control. There was also some report
of arthralgias similar to an occurrence of Still's disease that
she had 15 years ago which has generally been inactive since (is
NOT on any steroids). The day prior to admission to OSH, had an
episode of diarrhea, which later became melenic, and on the day
of admission she developed gross hematuria and epistaxis and
bleeding from her mouth.
.
ROS: Has noted progressive SOB and DOE. There has been, NO sore
throat, neck stiffness, abdominal pain, chest pain, and no
gynecologic symptoms. She has been on Zyprexa and Effexor at the
current doses for a long time. There has been no out of state
travel over the past 6 months or more. She lives with 2 cats and
has no close ill contacts, but does have a lot of contact with
the public working as a receptionist in a dentist's office (no
heavy metal exposure).
.
On her admission to OSH, patient was noted to be afebrile
(97.8), HD stable BP 112/54, heart rate of 89. On exam she was
noted to have a generalized petechial rash and guaiac stool
positive. Initial CBC was found to have a hematocrit of 30.4,
and plat of 94. She was given CTX 2 gm IV, Vancomycin 1 gm IV,
Hydrocortisone 100 mg IV, The patient was given 2 liters of
normal saline. She received a 5 pack of platelets.Initial count
went from 4 to 77, and on a second transfusion of platelets, she
went from 4 to 80.

IMAGING:
EKG [**1-15**]:
Baseline artifact
Sinus rhythm
Low precordial lead QRS voltage with late precordial QRS
transition - is
nonspecific and probably within normal limits
No previous tracing available for comparison

CT HEAD [**1-16**]: IMPRESSION: No CT evidence of intracranial
hemorrhage or other acute process.
.
Bronchial washings:  C/W DAH on bronch.  Path shows no malignant
cells.  Bronchial epithelial cells, macrophages, lymphocytes and
neutrophils present.
.
CT HEAD [**1-20**]:
PRELIMINARY IMPRESSION:
1) Likely no acute intracranial hemorrhage. There is suggestion
of hyperdensity in an isolated sulcus in the right superior
parietal lobe, which appears likely to be artifactual. However,
a follow-up CT could be obtained to reevaluate if the clinical
suspicion is high. Findings discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 106257**].
2) Sphenoid sinusitis and opacification of several ethmoid air
cells, new from the prior study.

FINAL READ:  IMPRESSION:
1) Suspect subarachnoid hemorrhage right parietal convexity.
Findings discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 106257**].
2) Sphenoid and ethmoid sinus opacification, likely secondary to
intubation.

CT HEAD [**1-21**]:
IMPRESSION: Small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage along the
right parietal convexity is less prominent than on the prior
day's study.

CT CHEST [**1-22**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Right mainstem bronchus intubation.
2. Cardiomegaly and probable mild pulmonary edema. Small
bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.
3. Small right middle lobe atelectasis versus small pneumonia.
4. No pathologically enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.

EEG:
FINDINGS:
ABNORMALITY #1: Throughout the recording the background rhythm
was slow
and disorganized, typically reaching a [**6-4**] Hz maximum in any
given area.
There were additional faster frequencies superimposed.
ABNORMALITY #2: There were occasional bursts of generalized
mixed
frequency slowing.
HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Could not be performed.
SLEEP: No normal waking or sleeping morphologies were seen.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to the slow and disorganized
background
and occasional bursts of generalized slowing. These findings
suggest a
moderate encephalopathy affecting both cortical and subcortical
structures. Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection
are
among the most common causes. There were no areas of focal
slowing
although encephalopathies may obscure focal findings. There were
no
epileptiform features.

MRI/A [**1-23**]:
Findings: There is no evidence of hemorrhage or infarction. The
MRA examination appears normal. The mastoid air cells are
largely opacified. The paranasal sinuses are partially
opacified. Images of the b
