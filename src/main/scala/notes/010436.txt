History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 30984**] is a 70F with a PMH s/f severe COPD, chronically
trach-dependent with chronic pseudomonas colonization and
recurrent pulmonary infections. She has had multiple recent ICU
admissions for respiratory failure, and was recently discharged
on [**2158-3-1**] after presenting with respiratory failure secondary
to severe PNA, c/b intubation, and a VAP. She was unfortunately
unable to be extubated at that time, and required tracheostomy
placement during that admission. Today she presents from her
rehabilitation facility where she was found to be transiently
"lethargic" by the pulmonologist rounding in the MACU. At that
time, she was hypoxic to 70% on SIMV (FiO2 35, TV 450, RR 12 PS
14, PEEP 5) with increased secretions, BP 98/50. She was
non-verbal and not following commands, afebrile, ABG showed
7.32/73/82. EKG unchanged. Of note, the patient had been
complaining of epigastric pain on [**3-10**]. She was taken off her
Aspirin that day, EKG was wnl.
.
In the ED, her initial vital signs were T=103.6, BP=100/palp,
HR=119, RR=20, O2sat=99% on trach/vent. On exam she was noted to
be rhonchorous, R>L, with melena in her diaper, PEG lavage did
not show any bleeding. A RIJ was placed for access. Labs were
notable for a WBC count of 13, a HCT of 22 (baseline 30),
relatively normal coags, a chronically elevated bicarbonate at
baseline, mild troponin elevation to 0.02 in the absence of
renal failure, and a positive UA. A CXR showed some new
multifocal opacities concerning for PNA. The patient was given
1L NS, vancomycin, zosyn, levaquin, 125mg IV solumedrol, one
unit of pRBCs, and IV pantoprazole. A gastroenterology
consultation was called. Unfortunately, the patient experienced
a pneumothorax during CVL placement.

Final Report
INDICATION: Assessment for interval change.
EXAMINATION: Chest radiograph.
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph of [**2158-3-19**], there is no relevant change. Minimal right apical
pneumothorax without signs of
tension. Unchanged multifocal bilateral opacities consistent
with the history of multifocal pneumonia. No evidence of newly
occurred focal parenchymal opacities.



Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 30984**] is a 70F with a PMH s/f severe, steroid and
trach-dependent COPD, with chronic pseudomonas colonization and
recurrent pulmonary infections, who presents with fevers,
altered mental status, hypoxia, and a GIB.
.
Hospital course by problem:
.
#. Hypotension/Pseudomonas Pneumonia: On admission the
differential diagnosis included sepsis, gastrointestinal bleed,
and tension pneumothorax. The patient was febrile, tachycardic
with a leukocytosis, with increasing respiratory distress
(hypoxia), increased secretions from her tracheostomy and a
chest x-ray concerning for multifocal pneumonia. The pt had a
history of chronic pseudomonal colonization and tracheostomy
dependence (since [**2-13**]) which were concerning for another
ventilator-associated pneumonia. However, she did have dark,
guaiac positive stools, with a hematocrit drop from 22.6 to 20
despite getting part of the first transfusion she received on
admission. Initially the pt was started on vancomycin and zosyn
for VAP, and was double covered for pseudomonas with gentamycin.
Then, per the infectious disease consult ser
