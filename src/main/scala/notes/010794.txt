[**2164-12-5**] Carotid Series
Severe MR was noted on echo.

[**2164-12-5**] ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left ventricular cavity
size is top
normal/borderline dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is
mildly depressed. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function
may be more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Resting regional wall motion abnormalities
include inferior and inferolateral akinesis. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet is eccentric. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

[**2164-12-6**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Mild mitral regurgitation.
3. Normal ventricular function.
4. Placement of IABP

[**2164-12-13**] CXR
Satisfactory findings on postoperative chest examination.
Further followup to document clearance of left lower lobe
atelectasis and residual pleural effusions is recommended.

[**2164-12-7**] EKG
Normal sinus rhythm, rate 88. Inferior myocardial infarction of
indeterminate age, possibly acute. Abbreviated P-R interval.
Non-specific lateral repolarization changes. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2164-12-6**] atrial ectopy is no longer evident.

[**2164-12-11**] ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the basal
2/3rds of the inferior wall/mild basal dyskinesis, and severe
hypokinesis of the septum. There is mild global hypokinesis of
remaining segments. The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic
root and ascending aorta are mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic
mitral valve prosthesis is present. The mitral prosthesis
appears well seated, with normal leaflet motion and
transvalvular gradients. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a trivial
pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2164-12-4**] via transfer from
[**Hospital6 33**] for further management of his coronary
artery and mitral valve disease. Intravenous heparin and
nitroglycerin were continued. He was worked-up by the cardiac
surgical service in the usual preoperative manner including a
carotid duplex ultrasound which did not reveal any significant
stenosis. An echocardiogram was obtained which showed a mildly
depressed ejection fraction of 40-45%, 3+ mitral regurgitation
and 1+ aortic insufficiency. On [**2164-12-6**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] became short
of breath with chest pain. He was taken to the cardiac
catheterization lab where an intra-aortic balloon pump was
placed. He was then taken to the operating room where he
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to three vessels and a
mitral valve replacement. Postoperatively he was taken to the
cardiac surgical intensive care unit for monitoring. Mr. [**Known lastname **]
was agitated pulling at his tubes. He required pressors
initially for hypotension. On postoperative day two, he was
extubated. His chest tubes were removed without issue. Mr. [**Known lastname **]
developed atrial fibrillation which was treated with beta
blockade and amiodarone. Coumadin was started for
anticoagulation as he remained in atrial fibrillation. He was
gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. The physical
therapy service was consulted for assistance with his
postoperative strength and mobility. On postoperative day four,
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to the cardiac surgical step down unit
for further recovery. He continued to work well with physical
therapy. Mr. [**Known lastname **] continued to make steady progress and was
discharged home on postoperative day seven. He will follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his cardiologist and his primary care
physician as an outpatient. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] will manage his coumadin
dosing for an INR of 2.0-2.5.
