CT TRACHEA W/O C W/3D REND  [**2196-2-9**]

Secretions are demonstrated within the trachea. The diameter of
the trachea is difficult to assess in the presence of the stent,
although at least the diameter of the new stent which is about
13 mm. The right main bronchus, bronchus intermedius and right
lower lobe bronchus are patent during the inspiration. Narrowing
of the orifice of the right middle lobe bronchus is
demonstrated, although it is patent during inspiration. The left
upper and left lower lobe bronchi are patent during inspiration.
The dynamic expiration series demonstrate significant decrease
of the diameter of the right main bronchus, from 7.7 to less
than 3 mm with right middle lobe and right lower lobe origins
almost collapsed on end-inspiration as a collapsed segmental
bronchi in both lower lobes and right middle lobe with
subsequent significant widespread areas of air trapping, most
likely attributed to this dynamic airway collapse.

The evaluation of the lung parenchima demonstrate multiple
rounded opacities, in the right apex, 7:25, in right upper lobe,
7:33, 7:36, extensive areas of centrilobular ground-glass
opacities and more rounded consolidations in right middle lobe
and right lower lobe as well as in the left lung to a lesser
extent, findings which are consistent with widespread
infection/aspiration. There is no pleural or pericardial
effusion. Several mediastinal lymph nodes do not meet the size
criteria for lymphadenopathy ranging up to 8 mm in right lower
paratracheal, 10 mm in subcarinal and 5 mm in the aortopulmonic
window. The heart size is mildly enlarged, stable compared to
the previous studies.

IMPRESSION:

1. Severe bronchomalacia as described, bilateral. The presence
of the endotracheal stent prevents the evaluation of malacia.
The newest internal stent is most likely broken. Narrow lumen
left in left main bronchus.

2. Extensive areas of rounded consolidations, ground-glass
opacities and centrilobular nodules are consistent with
widespread infection/aspiration. Differential diagnosis might
include parenchymal hemorrhage in the appropriate clinical
setup.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2196-2-20**] 1:23 PM
FINDINGS: Compared to the film from earlier the same day there
continues to be bilateral lower lobe volume loss with question
infiltrate in the right and left lower lobes. The tracheal and
left mainstem stents are unchanged. The left subclavian line is
unchanged.


UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US RIGHT  [**2196-2-23**] 12:37 AM
RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and Doppler
son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right internal jugular, subclavian, axillary
veins were performed. The basilic and cephalic veins were not
visualized. There is partially occlusive thrombus within a [**2-21**]
cm segment of the right internal jugular vein. There is an
additional larger partially occlusive thrombus within a 2-3 cm
segment of the right axillary vein.
IMPRESSION: Partially occlusive thrombi within the right
internal jugular and right axillary vein.

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS  [**2196-2-24**] 8:49 AM
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.










Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] underwent flexible bronchoscopy to evaluate stent
placement and airway.  On HD#2 she was taken to the operating
room and underwent flexible and rigid bronchoscopy, foreign body
(stent) removal and bronchoalveolar lavage.  She was transferred
to the intensive care unit intubated for airway management.  She
was started on intravenous antibiotics for her aspiration
pneumonia.  On POD #1 a central line was placed for access and
intravenous antibiotics.  She remained stable and on POD#3 was
taken for a flexible bronchoscopy to further evaluate her
airway.  She was taken back to the surgical intensive care unit
and was unable to extubate secondary to agitation.  On [**2196-2-18**]
she was taken back to the operating room for flexible and rigid
bronchoscopy with silicone stent placement.  She tolerated the
procedure well and was extubated on [**2-19**] without difficulty.
She transferred to the floor in stable condition.  She was
restarted on her home medications.  A clear liquid diet was
started and advanced as tolerated.  On [**2-22**] she found to have
right upper arm edema and a right upper extremity ultrasound was
positive for a partially occlusive thrombi within the right
internal jugular and right axillary vein.  She was started on
Lovenox and Coumadin.  On [**2-23**] she complained of bilateral
breast tenderness and warmth.  She was placed on Keflex for
possible mastitis.  Given her history of past DVTs a lower
extremity ultrasound was negative for DVT.  On [**2-24**] bilateral
breast ultrasound revealed a small left-sided fluid collection
which was drained for 1.5 cc of serous fluid.  Cultures were
sent and results are pending.
