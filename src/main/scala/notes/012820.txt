History of Present Illness:
58 year old male with widely metastatic melenoma unresponsive to
IL-2, s/p cycle 1 dacarbazine [**5-11**], being transferred from OSH
for management of worsening dyspnea and ongoing UGI bleed. Prior
to transfer he was ruled out for pulmonary embolism, and the day
of transfer he vomited guaiac positive emesis.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented to OSH [**5-24**] with nausea, vomiting and dyspnea.
He reports over the last two days worsening nausing and new
onset of vomiting. Also constipation for 2 days. He reports
baseline dyspnea that over the past 3 days has worsened such
that he can only walk 10 feet until he has to stop and rest. No
dyspnea at rest, no orthopnea, no chest pain, no diaphoresis. He
was hospitalized one week ago for recieve 2 units pRBCs for his
slow UGI bleed.

Review of sytems:
(+) Per HPI. + drenching night sweat last night with chills. +
weight loss. + sharp/stabbing RUQ pain. + 1 day of urinary
hesistancy +severe fatigue
(-) Denies fever, chills. Denies headache, sinus tenderness,
rhinorrhea or congestion. Denied cough. Denied chest pain or
tightness, palpitations. Denied diarrhea. No urinary or fecal
incontinence. No dysuria. States no black stools for 1 week.

Past Medical History:
HTN
COPD - used albuterol inhaler
Metastatic Melenoma: symptoms [**12-29**] melena
DX:[**2-4**] after UGI Bleed when endoscopy showed gastric mass, 2
moles on back bx and confirmed as melenoma.
STAGING: CT Torso - multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules with a
dominant mass in the LLL. LLL mass biopsy c/w melanoma. PET-CT
on [**2101-2-21**] was notable for FDG-avid adenopathy in the mediastinum

pre-existing right lung metastasis.

collapse with pleural effusion. No evidence of pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
In the MICU:  58 year old male with widely metastatic melenoma
admitted from OSH, determined to be hemodynamically stable,
treated with supportive care for his worsening dyspnea, fatigue,
RUQ pain from liver metastasis, and new onset nausea and
vomiting in setting of ongoing slow UGI bleed. Patient evaluated
by interventional pulmonary and transferred to the floor for
ongoing medical management and potential placement of stent in
left bronchus.

On the floor:
#. Dyspnea: He had progressive worsening dyspnea felt to be due
to metastatic melanoma.  He underwent bronchoscopy and was found
to have a left mainstem endobronchial tumor.  It was debridement
as possible but stents were not able to be put in.  His
follow-up chest xray showed increased aeration of the left lower
lobe and the patient had subjective improvement in his dyspnea,
although still had difficulty walking or exerting himself
without become short of breath.

#. UGI Bleed: He has a known melenoma metastasis eroding into
his stomch lining.  He had ongoing guaiac positive melenotic
stools during this admission.  He had a slow hematocrit drop
felt to be a very slow upper GI bleed.  He remained
hemodynamically stable.  He was given 1 unit of PRBC's prior to
discharge.  He was continued on his home PPI.

#. Nausea/Vomiting: He had intermittent nausea and vomiting felt
to be irritation from his bleeding in his stomach or possibly
other tumor irritation.  He was given prn zofran and compazine.

#. Urinary Hesistancy: He reported urinary hesitancy
intermittently that was felt to be related to narcotic use.  It
resolved without intervention.
