Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
Acute blood loss anemia
Retroperitoneal bleeding
Elective cardiac cath and post-procedure significant
retroperitoneal bleeding presents post embolisation and coiling
of right inferior epigastric artery

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catherization [**8-10**]
 Balloon tamponade of  R EIA and coiling of R inferior
epigastric artery.

History of Present Illness:
 52 y/o with CAD, s/p RCA stent [**2139**], PVD, s/p celiac and AA
stenting presented for elective cardiac catheterisation to
evaluate progressive anginal symptoms and abnormal ETT. At cath
on [**8-10**] the plan was to open her chronically occluded RCA but
this was unsuccessful. The cath lab team were also unable to
wire the vein for RHC, even under fluoroscopic guidance and the
procedure was stopped. RCA was visualised with 2 layers of prior
stents - they were able to wire across lesion but unable to
deliver the balloon. Pt had a lot of pain and tenderness to
palpation at the venous site.

Cath findings: LMCA - no sig stenosis, LAD - diagonal 50%, LCx
prox 60%, RCA long total occlusion in prior stent with
collaterals L>R.

She received heparin post initial catheterization and went to
floor. At 12:20 ,post-procedure, she complained of severe right
groin/RLQ abdominal pain which also radiated into her legs. She
was given fentanyl 50mcg x2 IV for her pain and when her ACT was
checked, her HCt was noted to have dropped from 40.9 ([**2146-7-28**]
from OSH results) to 22.7. She then proceeded to a stat CT
[**Last Name (un) 103**]/pelvis which showed a sizeable retroperitoneal bleed. She
developed hemodynamic instability in the context of a vagal
event when her sheath was being pulled at 14:00 and dropped to
SBP 50 and HR 40 with associated light-headedness and was given
atropine with good result.

Following this, her vitals normalised with HR 73 and BP 110/64.
She was subsequently taken emergently to the cath lab at 3:30pm
where angiography confirmed a bleeding point at the right
femoral site in the inferior epigastric branch. During the
procedure she received a Dopamine infusion, further fentanyl
25mcg x3 and she remained hemodynamically stable during the
procedure. They performed a balloon tamponade of the right
external iliac artery and eventually coil occluded the right
inferior epigastric artery and hemostasis was achieved. Received
3 units of PRBCs during the procedure. Pt was admitted to the
CCU for further monitoring. Her BP remained stable post her
second cath and she returned to the CCU for monitoring. In total
she received contrast 140+395ml for both caths.
.
On arrival to the CCU at 19:00 vitals were T 97.9, HR 59, RR10,
BP 111/51, sO2 98% RA. She was complaining of tnedreness and
sharp pains in both groins in addition to some lower back pain.
She also noted pain which radiated down both legs. On review at
22:00, these symptoms had considerably eased following tramadol
and morphine and her back/leg pain had resolved with changing
posture. In addition she noted mild constant chest heaviness
which she noted had been present all day but was not troublesome
and was a frequent occurrence.

.
Symptoms provoking cath: patient reported almost constant mild
substernal chestpressure that worsens with activity. Her cehst
pain can last from a few minutes to several hours and is
relieved by Nitroglycerin. She has also noticed a decline in her
exercise tolerance with intermittent wheezing and shortness of
breath with limited activity including walking 5 minutes and leg
fatigue with what sounds like claudication at 500ft in both
calves. She also notes rest pain left worse than right in her
calves which is noticeable when she goes to bed. Of additional
note, she had a short-lived, severe episode of abdominal pain
that lasted approximately one minute before resolving. Patient
reports this to feel similar to what she experienced prior to
her aortic and celiac stenting. Last celiac imaging [**2145**].

ROS:
CVS: CP with Nausea and claudication as above with occasional
palpitations. She denied orthopnea and PND.
RS: SOB and wheezing as above, no cough or sputum.
GIS: [**Last Name (un) **] pain as above,with ntermittent abdominal pain felt to
the left of the umbilicus, occasionally worse with eating. Last
[**Last Name (un) 103**]/celiac study was in [**2144**]. No constipation/dairrhea.
CNS: No weakness/numbness/fits but did note light-headedness as
above
ES: No fevers, sweats, tremors
Urinary: Nil. Pt now catheterised
