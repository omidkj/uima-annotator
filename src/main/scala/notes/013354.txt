History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year-old female with [**Age over 90 1291**], A fib and sinus tach with HR in
120s, dCHF, CABG, HTN, and right leg cellulitis x1 month who was
admitted for cellulitis, diarrhea (bloody), and was found to
have c diff.  Yesterday in afternoon she had an episode of chest
pain that resolved with no intervention and ekg was
unremarkable. At 3 am she became tachypnic to the 30s with SBP
in the 170s.  An EKG was done showing sinus tach with PACs.  The
pt had crackles on exam R>l.  A CXR was done which concerned the
overnight team for pulmonary edema.  She got lasix 40 IVx 1 at
3:45 am and put out 1100cc of urine. ABG was done (we think on
room air) and showed 7.41/37/67/24.  Lytes were checked and
showed a bicard of 24 with a gap of 24.  She also had a new 2L
oxygen requirement this Am with sats in the 80s. Her HR was 105
this AM and she received 5IV lopresor.  CBC this AM was
concentrated with increased WBC (19.5 ->28.6) and HCt also
elevated. She had several episodes of cp this AM and got 3 SL
nitro approx every hour. She was started on ASA. Given concern
for possible PE she was started on a heparin gtt.
.
Of note pt reports weakness and feeling poor for 1 wk prior to
admission and with new onset lose stools in the setting of being
on abx x1 month for.
.
On the floor, prior to transfer to ICU vital signs were BP156/93
RR38 HR 102 97% on 2L. Pt reported she was feeling fine.

Pertinent Results:
EKG ([**2129-12-23**]):  Sinus rhythm. Diffuse T wave flattening that is
non-specific. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2129-11-10**] there
is no significant diagnostic change.

EKG ([**2129-12-24**]):  Resting sinus tachycardia. P-R interval 200
milliseconds. Left atrial abnormality. Relative low lateral
precordial voltage. Non-specific ST-T wave change. Compared to
the previous tracing of [**2129-12-23**] heart rate is faster and
voltage criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy are not seen.

LENI ([**2129-12-25**]):  No evidence of DVT in the bilateral lower
extremities.

CTA chest ([**2129-12-26**]):
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
2. Increased in size of right pulmonary artery. Please
clinically correlate for signs of pulmonary artery hypertension.
3. Probable mild pulmonary edema.
4. Multiple stable vertebral compression deformities.
5. Stable bilateral adrenal thickening most compatible with
hyperplasia.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year-old female with mild diastolic heart failure, PAF, CAD,
and hypertension admitted with C. difficile colitis. Hospital
course was as follows:

1. C. difficile colitis:  In context of antibiotic use for
treatment of RLE cellulitis. On discharge, diarrhea improved. No
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever. Leukocytosis resolved.
Good PO intake. Although patient qualified for severe C.
difficile infection given age and initial leukocytosis, given
good response to metronidazole did not transition to oral
vancomycin. Metronidazole should be continued for total 14 day
course (stop date [**2130-1-6**]).

2. Decompensated diastolic heart failure:  Grade I noted by TTE
in [**2128**]. Previous severe aortic stenosis, now s/p bioprosthetic
[**Year (4 digits) 1291**]. Transferred to MICU on [**2129-12-25**] for new oxygen requirement
in context of HR 120-130s, SBP to 170s. Heart failure was
thought to be leading cause after patient was ruled out for PE
(negative CTA chest and lower extremity doppler studies) and
ACS. She received modest amount of IVF prior to onset of
symptoms. On transfer back to medical floor, patient began to
autodiurese with improvement in oxygen saturation on room air.
Furosemide restarted per home regimen on discharge.

3. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation:  Continued amiodarone 100mg
PO daily and aspirin 81mg PO daily per home regimen. CHADS2
score is 3. Patient with long-standing PAF per review of OMR. On
review of OMR, was anticoagulation in [**2123**], but not during
several recent hospitalizations. Decision to withhold
anticoagulation with coumadin not stated in records, although
may be related to age/fall risk.

4. Hypertension:  On review of OMR, previously treated with
lisinopril and metoprolol. No mention is made in OMR of why/when
medications were stopped, but per recent discharge summaries,
blood pressure well-controlled off of antihypertensives. During
this hospitalization, sBP 170s prior to transfer to MICU. On
transfer back to medical floor, sBP elevated on occasion despite
overall clinical improvement. No evidence of hypertensive
emergency/end-organ damage on medical floor. Was briefly on
labetalol 100mg PO BID, although this drastically decreased
blood pressure. On discharge, furosemide restarted at home dose.
Blood pressure should be monitored in rehab. If systolic BP
persistently elevated >150, would recommend starting low-dose
ACE inhibitor (was previously on lisinopril).

5. CAD:  s/p 3V CABG ([**2123**]). Continued simvastatin 20mg PO
daily, ASA 81mg PO daily (briefly 325mg PO daily with concern
for ACS, as above) per home regimen.

6. Depression:  Continued venlafaxine XR 75mg PO daily per home
regimen.

7. Right lower extremity wound:  Previously w
