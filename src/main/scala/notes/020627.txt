Service: MEDICINE

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea, cough starting at 7 a.m. on [**2195-1-12**], in the setting of
similar episodes during the past 3-4 days

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
63yo woman with history of COPD presented with subacute
worsening of shortness of breath and non-productive cough for
3-4 days prior to admission. This was initially responsive to
inhaler treatments, but not on admission. She endorsed
increasing dyspnea and non-productive cough. Otherwise, did not
have any fever/chills. She had no chest pain, arm/jaw pain,
nausea/vomiting, or diaphoresis. She did endorse some left
infra-mammary chest wall pain after bouts of coughing, which was
not present at rest.
.
In the ED, her vitals were initially T 98.3, 118, 28, 165/56,
96% on 6L nasal canula. She remained normotensive throughout
fluctuating between 95/58 to 123/63 thereafter. She had
peripheral access established. She had an EKG which demonstrated
sinus tachycardia at 114bpm, Nl axis/intervals, TWI in aVL, and
TW flattening in V2 (unchanged compared to prior). Chest xray
demonstrated hyperinflation, but no acute findings. She was
given solumedrol 125mg, several rounds of combivent nebs, and
empirically given levaquin 500mg. Over her ED course, her
dyspnea was improved.
.
On the medical floor, she was continued on solumedrol 80mg IV
q8h, levaquin, and atrovent nebs q4h. Albuterol was held given
her marked sinus tachycardia. She was also found to have
CK/MB/MBI/trop elevation and had evolving lateral precordial
lead TWI. She was seen by cardiology who felt that this was
demand ischemia in the setting of COPD exacerbation and
tachycardia. Her tachycardia initially resolved, trending down
to 80's in early AM, but then around 10am she again became
increasingly distressed with marked tachypnea to 20-30's,
visibly distressed with poor air movement and accessory
respiratory mm. use, and tachycardic to 140's-150's. ABG was
done: 7.38/31/66, lactate 7.7 (from prior gas of 7.37/38/98).
EKG was sinus tachy with evolving TWI in lateral precordial
leads. Her vitals on evaluation on the floor were 98.9, 98.3,
160/90, 140, 28, 94% on 4L NC. She continues to report left
inframammary muscular pain with cough, but otherwise denies any
substernal pain, n/v, diaphoresis, or jaw/arm pain.
.
Pt transferred to the MICU for respiratory compromise, intubated
and underwent cardiac catherizartion which was normal. Based on
cardiopulmonary workup, respiratory distress appeared to be
primarily COPD exacerbation resulting in cardiac demand
ischemia, complicated by Takatsubo syndrome from physiologic
stress and pt's anxiety in setting of hypoxia. Resolution of
mixed AG metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis.
.
Pt seen and evaluated by medicine admitting team on the wards.
No complaints of SOB, chest pain. Pt was started on coumadin on
[**1-15**] secondary to hypokinetic LV on echo to prevent thrombus
formation. However, DC'd on [**1-17**] due to supratherapeutic INR.
She has had two episodes of hemoptysis which is likely secondary
to post-intubation airway irritation. Hemondynamically stable
with stable Hct.

Flovent. No PFT's on record.
