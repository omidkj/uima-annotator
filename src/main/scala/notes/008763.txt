History of Present Illness:
HPI: Pt is a 50 y/o female with multiple medical problems
including
orthostatic hypotension, adrenal insufficiency, h/o DVT/PE s/p
filter, s/p gastric bypass with chronic malnutrition, ICH s/p
fall [**1-25**] who was sent to the ED from her nursing home to have
her G-tube evaluated [**2-22**] reports of clotting. On arrival to the
ED, she was noted to be unresponsive (clearly a change from how
she left the NH).
Per report obtained by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**], she was given her usual
dose of methadone (15mg) prior to leaving in the ambulance at
which time she was alert and oriented x 3. Per EMS reports, the
pt became progressively more somnolent en route to [**Hospital1 18**]. At the
time of arrival, she was minimally responsive to sternal rub per
the ED staff. After discovering that the pt had received
methadone, the ED staff administered Narcan at which point the
pt began to become somewhat more responsive (although minimally
per ED staff). Shortly thereafter, the pt experienced a 10
second episode of rigid extension of both legs with shivering
movements of her upper extremities. There was no history of
clonic movements after this episode of rigidity. There was
discrepancy between some members of the ED team as to whether
this event could have been seizure activity. She was given
intravenous lorazepam. She was subsequently intubated for airway

protection.
.
Per the notes, there is no history of antecedant fever, chills,
or focal complaints prior to transfer from the [**Hospital1 1501**] to the [**Hospital1 18**].

EEG:

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 50yo female with an extensive PMH who presented to the ED
for G-tube clotting, but then developed ? seizure-like activity
resulting in intubation for protection of her airways.
.
1. ? Seizure activity/unresponsiveness: Possible etiologies for
her unresponsiveness included toxic/metabolic derangements
(uremia, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, medication overdose, etc),
seizure activity, infection, or an intracranial event. CT of her
head was normal. An EEG was performed, and a preliminary read
showed bifronal delta frequency slowing with sharp features
(however, no clear epileptiform features, no current seizure
activity). LFTs, BUN, and glucose were normal. She was
hyponatremic with Na of 127, but that did not seem like enough
of a shift in Na to cause unresponsiveness. Glu was 94, so
hypoglycemia was not an issue. Despite a normal WBC and afebrile
condition, the patient did have a urine culture positive for
enterococcus. Blood cultures were negative. Given that she was
loaded with methadone just prior to leaving in the ambulance,
which is when she became somnolent, perhaps she received too
much methadone and became overly sedated and unresponsive. Tox
screen (serum and urine) were both negative, even for methadone.
The most likely explanation is a combination of factors,
including the UTI, hypovolemia from dumping syndrome, and
narcotic use, leading to an altered mental status/state of
unresponsiveness.
.
2. UTI: Pt found to have urine cultures positive for
enterococcus, sensitivities pending. In the past ([**5-25**]), she had
a similar urine culture, which was sensitive to vancomycin and
nitrofurantoin. She was given one dose of vancomycin and
switched to nitrofurantoin upon discharge.
.
3. Respiratory status: Pt was intubated and extubated
uneventfully. No further respiratory distress during admission.
.
4. Metabolic alkalosis on admission: Likely due to dumping
syndrome after her gastric bypass procedure, as she is
hypochloremic and hyponatremic in the setting of an elevated
bicarb.
.
5. Hyponatremia: Resolved with NS. Most likely due to
hypovolemia in addition to her adrenal insufficiency.
.
6. Glycemic control: Pt was initially hyperglycemic in the ICU.
This was controlled with SSI and resolved.
.
7. FEN: G-tube had been
