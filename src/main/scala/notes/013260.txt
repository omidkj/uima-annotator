Brief Hospital Course:
Transferred in from outside hospital and underwent preoperative
workup.  On [**2148-5-22**] he was brought to the operating room and
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x5 with left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending artery and reverse
saphenous vein graft to the first and second obtuse margin
artery and sequential reverse saphenous vein graft to the
posterior descending artery and the posterior
left ventricular branch artery.  See operative note for full
details.  Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. POD 1 found the
patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.
The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable
on no inotropic or vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was
initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward the
preoperative weight.  The patient was transferred to the
telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing
wires were discontinued without complication.  His Foley
catheter was left in as he has a history of benign prostatic
hypertrophy and the is awaiting TURP.  He is to be discharged
with a leg bag home. The patient was evaluated by the physical
therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility.  He
was started on FeSO4 for a hematocrit of 23.9 at the time of
discharge.  He was asymptomatic and is to have visiting nurses
check hematocrit in [**2-28**] days and call results in to his PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
the time of discharge on POD 4 the patient was ambulating
freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral
analgesics.  The patient was discharged home in good condition
with appropriate follow up instructions.
