History of Present Illness:
This is a 39 yom with h/o C5 quadriplegia, MDS, and recurrent
UTIs who was transferred from OSH for assessment of altered
mental status. He was admitted to [**Location (un) 620**] from [**2169-10-5**] to
[**2169-10-9**] with lethargy and was diagnosed with a Klebsiella UTI.
He was initially treated with ertapenem and subsequently
switched to ciprofloxacin for a seven day course. At the time of
discharge the patient was continuing to feel weak. At baseline
he can unscrew a bottle cap, drive a car and drive his
wheelchair. He returned to [**Location 620**] on [**2169-10-14**] with progressive
weakness in his upper extremities and lethargy. His temperature
was "running low" but he had no fevers, chest pain, difficulty
breathing, nausesa, vomiting, headaches, neck stiffness, head
trauma or diarrhea but was having some mild cough and
congestion. Initial vitals were notable for a temperature of
92.7. Initial urinalysis was positive and he was started on
ertapenem for presumed urinary tract infection. Subsequent
culture has been negative. He had a head CT which showed
possible blood in the third ventricle. He was transfered to this
hospital for further management.
.
On arrival to our emergency room his initial vs were: T 96.2 P:
61 BP: 120/71 R: 14 O2 sat 96%RA. He was seen by neurosurgery
who felt he should have platelets given but no surgery was
indicated. Patient was given 6 units of platelets (1 bag) and
transferred to the floor.
.
On admission the patient was noted A&O x 3 but per his family
was more lethargic than usual. Upper extremity strength was
documented as as 4-/5. On [**2169-10-15**], pt had a generalized tonic
clonic seizure with hypoxia of 88% on RA. He was treated with IV
ativan and was subsequently post-ictal. He was placed on
continuous oxygen monitoring and four liters nasal cannula with
saturations in the mid 90s. There was concern for aspiration
during this event secondary to increased secretions requiring
deep suctioning. He was started on IV Keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **].  EEG
showed left mid to posterior temporal theta slowing. On [**2169-10-17**]
he had a second generalized tonic clonic seizure lasting one
minute. He was given IV ativan and subsequently was noted to
have hypoxia to 85% on 4L nasal cannula and his respiratory rate
was [**5-1**] with periods of apnea. CPAP was tried, but hypoxia
persisted.  He was placed on NRB.
.
Complicating his hospital course was a multifocal pneumonia
noted on CXR, with low grade temps.  He was cotninued on
meropenem for UTI although cultures subsequently returned as
negative.
.
MICU course: Pt was somnolent but arousing to voice.  He did not
respond to questions but would track when aroused.  He did not
withdraw to painful stimuli in the upper extremtities or respond
to questions.  Pt is noted to have episodes of bradycardia
associated with hypothermia.  ECG shows no apparent heart block.
 Antibiotic coverage was broadened to include anaerobes with
Flagyl.  Pt was continued on Keppra and Dilantin.
.
Currently, pt feels well.  Denies any complaints.  He denies any
discomfort with his breathing.
.
ROS: Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, rhinorrhea,
congestion, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain,
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia,
dysuria, hematuria.

[**10-15**] EEG:  This is an abnormal portable EEG due to intermittent
left
mid to posterior temporal theta slowing that, at times, appears
monomorphic and more suspicious for epileptiform activity. These

findings suggest possible subcortical dysfunction in this area.
Anatomic correlation is indicated. A repeat study with
sphenoidal
electrodes may be performed to help clarify the above findings.
.
[**10-15**] CXR:   Bibasilar pneumonia.
.
[**10-15**] CT Head:
CONCLUSION: No definite sign of an intracranial hemorrhage. See
above report for requested potential prior outside studies and
their reports.

COMMENT: Seen on the lateral scout radiograph are two screws
overlying the mid cervical spine and a possible intervening
wire. Please provide information as to whether this finding
constitutes some form of prior surgical treatment. At least the
more cephalad screw was likely visible on the prior sagittal
T1-weighted scans as an area of susceptibility.

.
[**10-17**] CXR (portable): Newly developed, slightly asymmetrical
pulmonary edema with new right pleural effusion, which is small
to moderately large
.
[**10-18**] MRI Head:  1. Motion artifact degrades image quality.
Areas of apparent T2 hyperintensity in the right temporal lobe
may be artifactual related to the patient motion. The parenchyma
is otherwise grossly unremarkable. If there is focal semiology
and further clinical concern, repeat MRI of the brain as per the
seizure protocol may be helpful if the patient is able to better
tolerate the procedure without movement.
2. Stable prosthesis in the right orbit.
3. Fluid within the right mastoid air cells and paranasal
sinuses, improved since the prior study.
.
[**10-18**] CXR:  Previous mild pulmonary edema has resolved.
Opacification in the right lower lung and accompanied downward
displacement of the hilus indicates that previous area of
consolidation has now collapsed.
