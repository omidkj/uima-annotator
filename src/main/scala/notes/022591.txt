History of Present Illness:
88 M h/o laryngeal ca (XRT), s/p laryngectomy, DM, HTN,
hyperlipidemia, CVA (R parietal), s/p R CEA, prostate ca s/p XRT
c/b proctitis, recently d/c'd from [**Hospital1 **] for increased sputum
production, was in his USOH until ~12:15AM [**2116-11-27**]. Pt was
sitting in a chair, then noted by his sister to slump over and
become unresponsive. No preceding evidence of chest pain, SOB,
n/v, palpitations or seizure activity.
.
Pt was pulseless for ~15minutes until EMS arrivated, and was
found to be in asystole by AED. He was intubated through
existing stoma, (right mainstem intubation), received 3 rounds
of epi, 1 round of atropine, with return of pulse after ~36
minutes.
.
Upon arrival @ [**Hospital1 18**] ED, 96.4 SBP 110/70, HR 130. R FEMORAL TLC
placed sterily as BPs dropped to 70s, and pt started on [**Last Name (un) **]
gtt. EKG= sinus tach, RBBB, STD laterally, CXR revealed R
mainstem intubation, RT placed trach, and tube withdrawn. CTA
was negative for PE. CT HEAD negative for acute bleeding or
herniation. Pupils noted to be unequal (R 2.5, L 5mm), though
?[**12-26**] atropine. Bedside USN of heart w/o obvious effusion per ED.
FAST u/s negative for intraabdominal bleed.
.
.
EKG shows retrograde p-waves, ?junctional tachy, diff STD, 1,

STUDIES:
[**2116-11-27**] TTE:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy (at least moderate). The left
ventricular cavity is small. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to hypokinesis of
the apex. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Right
ventricular systolic function appears depressed (possibly
severe). The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
Significant aortic stenosis is present (not quantified). Mild to
moderate ([**11-25**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The aortic
regurgitation jet is eccentric, directed toward the anterior
mitral leaflet. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. There is severe mitral annular calcification. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The supporting structures of the tricuspid
valve are thickened/fibrotic. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2114-2-13**], apical hypokinesis of the left
ventricle and global hypokinesis of the right ventricle are now
present.
.
.
[**2116-11-27**] CT HEAD:
1. No acute intracranial pathology including no evidence of
hemorrhage.

2. Old infarct of the right parietal lobe with associated
encephalomalacic
changes as described.

3. The junction of C1-C2 shows severe degenerative disease.
.
.
[**2116-11-27**] CTA CHEST:
1. No pulmonary embolism.
2. Moderate bilateral pleural effusion, right greater than left
with reactive atelectasis. Diffuse ground-glass opacities at
lung bases, increased interstitial markings and reflux of
intravenous contrast into the IVC suggest cardiac dysfunction.
3. Trachestomy tube extends into the right mainstem bronchus.
4. Focal areas of consolidative changes in the lung apices and
right lower lobe are suggestive of aspiration or pnuemonia.
5. Anterior dislocation of the left shoulder and left clavicular
fracture.
.
.
[**2116-11-27**] CT CSPINE:
1. No fracture is noted. Mild grade 1 anterolisthesis of C4 over
C5 is
visualized with mild thecal sac compression.

2.Diffuse degenerative disease of the cervical spine.


Brief Hospital Course:
88 M no known h/o CAD, dCHF (EF>55%), DM, HTN, hyperlipid, R
CVA, h/o laryngeal ca s/p laryngectomy, prostate ca presenting
after witnessed asystole carduac arrest x 15min, with ROC after
36min.
.
The patient was transferred to the CCU with stable BP in normal
sinus rythym on EKG.
.
In the setting of prolonged asystolic cardiac arrest with
minimal neurologic function upon neurologic exam at time of CCU
evaluation, discussion between the CCU team the patient's
family, and ultimately palliative care, resulted in agreement
that the goals of care for the patient comfort measures only.
.
Prior to final decision, neurology consult obtained, and as
pupils were fixed and non-responsive, there was loss of most
brain stem reflexes, loss of response to painful stimuli, and
myoclonic jerking which indicate severe anoxic brain injury with
an extremely poor prognosis for meaningful recovery, it was felt
that there was no role for further imaging, EEG, labs,
hyperventilation or steroids at that time.
.

Pt was treated with fentanyl and midazolam gtt.  He remained
intubated until [**2113-11-29**] as per family req
