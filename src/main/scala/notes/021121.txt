Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1936**]
Chief Complaint:
laryngeal edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tracheostomy, percutaneous.


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Hospital1 99965**] is a 59F homeless woman with DM h/o alcoholism
and polysubstance abuse who is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for question
of laryngeal edema and difficulty weaning from the ventilator.
.
She reportedly had a recent hospitalization at [**Hospital1 2177**] for housing
placement and ?cellulitis. She was then referred to [**Hospital **]
Healthcare for further care and placement in an apartment. The
day of planned discharge [**4-23**] pt was noted to be increasingly
anxious. She was given diazepam without improvement. She became
confused. Vitals were obtained showing HR in 40's, BP 100/60 and
"low O2" which improved to 96% on unknown amount of supplemental
O2.
.
In the [**Hospital1 **] ER, she was "somnolent" and given narcan x1 due to
concern for narcotics overdose (she had been taking oxycontin).
She subsequently became agitated and was intubated for airway
protection. Admission labs were notable for acute renal failure
with Cr of 2.5 (reportedly in 1's previously), K of 7.4, ABG
7.28/56/379 on 3L NC prior to intubation. CXR showed mild
pulmonary edema. CT head showed no CNS bleed, but evidence of an
orbital floor fracture thought to be old. Vitals on presentation
to the ICU were 98.4 P 39-42 BP 79/40-96/37 O2 100% on AC FiO2
0.6.
.
She was able to wean off the ventilator rapidly. Extubation was
attempted on [**4-25**], but within an hour she developed stridor that
responded poorly to nebs, epinephrine, and lasix. On
reintubation she was thought to have laryngeal edema. Seen by
ENT who felt she would need extubation attempt in OR with setup
ready for emergency crich. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management given lack of 24h ENT coverage at [**Hospital1 **].
.
She has been getting morphine and versed drips for sedation. Has
been difficult to wean down sedation because she becomes
agitated when sedation is lightened. She continued to have
bradycardia in the 30's, though this improved when he morphine
drip was lightened. It was thought that there might be a vagal
component as well and KUB was performed day of transfer to
evaluate for a GI process that might be contributory. She had
been on lisinopril in the past but this was HELD during her
hospitalization and was not given prior to her extubation. CXR
post re-intubation raised question of RLL infiltrate and she
briefly received vancomycin and zosyn. This infiltrate rapidly
cleared however and antibiotics were discontinued.

STUDIES:
CT head [**4-23**] no bleed, suspected L orbital floor blowout
fracture (thought to be old)
.
CXR [**4-29**] There are bilateral right more than left perihilar and
lower lobe opacities with the most significant one patchy
consolidation seen in the right infrahilar area. The findings
may represent pulmonary infection, asymmetric pulmonary edema or
aspiration. Hemorrhage is another possibility. The retrocardiac
consolidation is noted that might represent the area of
atelectasis to be similar to the rest of the findings.
.
EKG sinus bradycardia @31bpm, nl axis, poor R wave progression
with TWI in V1-V3. QTc 500.
.
CT chest [**4-29**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Limited assessment of the airways due to intubated status;
however, no
mass, fluid collection, or hematoma is evident as cause for
extrinsic
compression of the airway.
2. Bibasilar air space opacities concerning for aspiration or
infection.
3. Incidentally noted medialized internal carotid arteries.
4. Coarse calcification noted in left thyroid lobe. If not
previously
assessed, ultrasound may be performed on an outpatient basis.
.
CT neck [**4-29**]:

.
Chest CXR [**5-3**]:
.
Left lower lobe aeration has improved. Marked cardiomegaly is
unchanged.
Tracheostomy tube is in the standard position. Right IJ catheter
tip is in
the lower SVC. There is no pneumothorax or enlarging pleural
effusion.
.
CT sinuses [**5-7**]-
.
IMPRESSION:
1. Left medial and inferior wall orbital fractures appear
chronic. Small
amount of herniated fat is present through both defects, but
this is well
marginated, and there is no surrounding inflammatory stranding,
hematoma, or blood within the sinuses.
2. Globular appearance of the left inferior rectus muscle could
suggest
sequela of prior trauma, possibly resolving/chronic hematoma.
3. Comminuted nasal bone fractures, which also appear
subacute/chronic.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Hospital1 99965**] is a 59 F homeless woman with DM, CAD, CHF,
COPD, OSA h/o alcoholism and polysubstance abuse who was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for question of laryngeal edema and
difficulty weaning from the ventilator.  She was intubated at
[**Hospital3 **] due to altered mental status/hypoxemia and
hypercarbia, subsequently weaned off ventilator at OSH rapidly.
Her extubation on [**4-25**] failed as pt. was reportedly found with
stridor, responded poorly to nebs, epinephrine, and lasix. She
was reintubated and noted to have laryngeal edema on
reintubation.  Her course was complicated by ARF, hyperkalemia
and sinus bradycardia. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation of laryngeal edema and tracheostomy. She had been on
lisinopril in the past but this was held during her
hospitalization and was not given prior to her extubation.  She
reports prior episodes of intubations requiring tracheostomy
placement.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**] she was noted to have larygeal edema with no cuff leak,
CT neck was not
