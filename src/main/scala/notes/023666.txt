Allergies:
Heparin Agents

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 398**]
Chief Complaint:
 s/p left hip fxr repair with failure to extubate.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation and extubation

History of Present Illness:
81-year-old female, with a history of COPD on home O2, severe
MS, PAF, PVD, who sent to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Location (un) 620**] on [**7-27**]. She
initially presented to [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**] [**2129-7-22**] with cough. She was
admitted and treated for a COPD exacerbation with a steroid
taper and ceftriaxone and Z-Pak for empiric coverage of acute
bronchitis. She was also noted to have renal failure thought
secondary to dehydration. From the DC summ, she was also felt to
be volume overloaded later in the stay. She was evaluated with
an echo which showed high filling pressures, mild MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] of
50%. Cardiology recommend restarting her Lasix on [**7-26**] at
20mg/day (had been on 120) and her Cr decreased with this. Plan
was to titrate up her Lasix dose as her Cr would tolerate. Her
HCTZ was restarted on [**7-26**] as well.
.
On [**7-27**], she was scheduled to be transfered to rehab and had a
mechanical fall at [**Location (un) 620**]. Xrays showed left complex acetabular
fracture. Decision was made to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for a surgical
repair. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2637**] accepted the patient, however upon arrival
to the floor, it was felt that the complexity of the patient
necisitated a transfer to the medicine team.
.
Treated on medicine until [**7-29**] when taken to OR. Post-op, unable
to extubate patient secondary to respiratory distress so sent to
MICU for furhter care.

.
Imaging:
CT LLE [**7-27**]:
1. Complex, comminuted fracture of left acetabulum involving
anterior and posterior columns and acetabular roof. Comminuted
complex fracture of left iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**] extending into the left
sacroiliac joint. Complex fracture of left inferior pubic ramus.
2. Associated hematoma at fracture site and extending into
retroperitoneal space superiorly, the pelvic sidewall medially,
and involving adjacent iliopsoas and gluteus musculature.
3. Focal low density structure adjacent to the left femoral
artery. Consider correlation with ultrasound to exclude the
possibility of pseudoaneurysm or hematoma.
.
RENAL U/S [**7-28**]: Limited study. No hydronephrosis. Bilateral
non-obstructing renal stones.
.
P-mibi [**7-29**]:
The image quality is good.  Left ventricular cavity size is
normal.
Rest and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake
throughout the left ventricular myocardium. Gated images reveal
normal wall motion.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 74%.
.
LENI [**7-31**]: No evidence of DVT involving the left lower extremity
.
PICC placement [**7-31**]: 40 cm right brachial vein [**Last Name (un) **] catheter
terminating in the SVC. The catheter is ready for use.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 81 yof with MMP s/p hip fracture repair, failed exutbation
in PACU.
.
1. Respiratory failure: Pulling TV of 1000+ on [**6-18**]. RSBI 25. ABG
7.33/40/140. Suspect failure to extuabte post-op was anesthesia
related. She does not appear fluid overloaded on exam. Nothing
concerning for PNA. Was extubated successfully the night of
[**7-29**].  Her COPD exacerbation was successfully treated with
steroids, nebulizer treatments, and 1 week of CTX.  Her wheezing
greatly improved and she was transitioned to prednisone 20mg
daily at time of discharge.  She should continue this for 2 more
days, then decrease to prednisone 10mg daily for three days.
Her Advair, Spiriva and nebs should be continued.
.
2. Hip fracture: s/p acetabular fracture repaire through groin.
Ortho took her to the OR on [**7-29**] and performed a left acetabular
ORIF.  She was given 1 week of post-op antibiotics empirically.
She was initially on Lovenox once daily for DVT ppx given her
hip fx, but this was converted to fondaparinux 2.5mg SC qD given
concern for HIT (see below).  This should be continued until her
HIT Ab returns negative, and then may be transitioned back to
Hep SC tid.  She is to f/u with orthopedics in 2 weeks after
discharge.  Her dressings are to be changed as needed as these
have been draining serous discharge from her wound.  On day of
discharge, orthopedics evaluated the would who felt there was no
infxn present.  She is to be touch-down weight baring on her
Left leg until cleared by orthopedics to advance.
.
3. Decreasing Plts
There was a concern for HIT given drop in plts >50% in 4 days
from 360->140.  Her Lovenox SC qD was switched to Fondaparinux
2.5mg SC qD and a HIT Antibody was sent out.  This was pending
at day of discharge and should be followed up.  If this returns
negative, she may be re-challenged with Hep SC tid and her
platelets should be closely monitored.
.
4. DM:
She was on an aggressive Insulin sliding scale given FS in teh
300s while on the steroids for her COPD exacerbation.  Given her
elevated BS, she was started on NPH 7 units qAM and 4 units qhs
along with her Humalog SS tid with meals.  Please follow up on
her BS and adjust her scale accordingly as she is tapering off
of the steroids over the next week.
.
4. ARF:
Developed anuria in the first 24 hours post-op.  Likely ATN
given extensive intra-op blood loss of 2L.  Cr peaked at 3.3 on
[**7-31**] and slowly trended back down to 1.6 on day of discharge.
Her nephrotoxic meds were held and all other meds were renally
dosed.  Please continue to monitor her Creatinine daily or every
other day until her creatinine returns to baseline (1.1-1.2).
.
5. CHF: Currently appears euvolemic. Will hold her Lasix for now
until ARF resolves.  Please restart Lasix 40mg once daily once
her creatinine returns to normal.
.
6. Rhythm: History of afib; currently vpaced. Off coumadin prior
to admission. No plans to restart now given fall risk and
dementia.
.
7. COPD flare:
