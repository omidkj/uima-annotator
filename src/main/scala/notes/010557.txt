HOSPITAL COURSE:

The patient was admitted to the hospital for known esophageal
cancer (T3N1MO) s/p portacath placement and J-tube placement in
[**2162-4-8**], followed by neoadjuvant chemo (F5U/cisplatin) and
radiation for an esophagectomy with cervical anastomosis
([**Last Name (un) 62523**] procedure).

Postoperatively he went into acute renal failure and was seen by
the nephrology service.  He was also seen to develop loculated
pleural effusions, and so he had a pigtail placed on [**8-25**]; CXR
post placement revealed a right lung fluid in new loculated
effusion/ hydropneumothorax towards apex with the left effusion
unchanged.  THe patient then had a chest tube placed on the left
for drainage of that effusion.  When drainage had decreased
significantly and there were no signs of pneumothorax, the
patient's left and then right pigtails were removed, which he
tolerated well.

He remained on the ventilator and had a tracheostomy placed on
[**9-24**], which he tolerated well.

On [**9-7**] the patient went into septic shock and was transferred
to the CVICU.  He triggered 6x on the floor for dyspnea and
hypotension. Pressures noted to be in the 70s. Pt given albumin
for volume expansion transiently resulting in an increase in BP
into the 90s. Pt was noted to have a burst of SVT with HR in
160s which improved with carotid massage. [**1-9**] overwhelming
nursing concern, transient hypotension, concern for worsening
hypercarbia, decrease in mental status, pt transferred to ICU
for further management. Placed US guided L AC 18 gauge. Pt
intubated for hypercarbia and for fluid management concern as
latest cxr revealed volume overload versus underlying pna(no
fevers)

[**9-8**] - Pt self-extubated in AM, reintubated in CVICU, was
hypotensive, femoral a-line and RIJ triple lumen placed. Pt
taken back to OR for ~5hr exploration as to acute
decompensation, bronchoscopy unrevealing, on ex-lap multiple
loculated abscesses found and drained, JPs left in place,
anastomosis no leak. Pt hypotensive during abdominal closure -->
asystolic arrest, CPR initiated, epi/atropine given --> Vtach,
defib into sinus rhythm. Abd left open. Then had episode of SVT
during transfer from OR table to bed -Afib w/ RVR w/
hypotension, cardioverted back to sinus. Overnight in CVICU had
a slight dropoff of UOP and mild hypotension, responded to fluid
bolus. Remains sedated on fent/midaz, with slow weaning of
levophed. postop hct 33 --> Midnight Hct 30, INR 1.5, lytes wnl,
ABGs improving - last 7.54/34/110/30/+7.

[**9-9**]-off pressors, excellent urine output, transfused 1UPRBC,
continues on TPN, started on lasix gtt to augment diuresis for
possible closure, vanc trough appropriate

[**2162-9-10**]-Transfused 1 unit of PRBC's with goal of keeping patient
above goal of 30. Diuresed to goal of 100cc/hour of urinary
output with a CVP greater than 10 and an SBP > 100.

[**9-11**] - likely washout on Sunday or Monday with closure;
autodiuresis >2L, off lasix. 4am RN noticed slightly uneven
pupils and less reliable response to voice/command on neuro
check. Communicated with primary service which will decide on
course in AM as per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].

[**9-12**] washout Monday with closure; diuresis augmented with lasix
gtt and diamox, rate increased to blow off more co2, TPN
concentrated, non contrast head and chest shot, negative 3+L
over 24h

[**9-13**]-Pt to OR for attempted closure. Failed. Had Left chest tube
placed for pleural collection. 300cc's of yellow serous fluid
drained from site. Pt still not on pressors making 50-80cc's
hour.

[**9-14**] - albumin added in attempt to decrease edema, lasix bolus
to [**Male First Name (un) **] albumin as neg balance reaching even. diamox d/c'ed.

[**9-15**] lasix boluses d/c'ed in favor of lasix gtt, [**State **] patch
tightened, IR/CT guided drainage deferred to tomorrow AM,
vivonex 20cc/hr to be held at midnight started.

[**9-16**] - stool for guaiac, search for source of anemia. For IP
drainage of right apical effusion today, if drainage successful
chest tube to be d/c'ed by thoracic.
[**9-17**]- maintained negative, R chest tube removed by thoracic
surgery
[**9-18**] - Continue to make 1/2L negative, follow BUN/Cr, daily CXR
[**9-19**]-started vanc--goals remain similar as yesteday.
[**9-20**] - TPN reordered, lasix gtt to continue per thoracic,
titrate to goal 0-1L negative. CVL displaced in PM, new RIJ CVL
placed. Also noted to be jaundiced - LFTs elevated, TB 4.7,
AST/ALT in 80s, primary team requests to repeat LFTs in AM.
Post-line CXR - small line near left heart border, rads resident
read as possible pneumomediastinum, again line on repeat CXR.
Possible pneumomediastinum unlikely related to line placement,
pt w/ esophagectomy, ?air tracking from open abdomen or surgical
site, pt remain hemodynamically stable overnight. Discussed with
primary team, agree to plan to monitor and manage conservatively
until repeat CXR in AM or further plan by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Plan for OR
[**9-21**] for possible abdominal closure.
[**9-21**]: Unable to take back to OR, will go back [**9-22**] for closure
of negative pressure therapy, d/c'ed versed gtt in favor of
intermittent ativan with minimal requirement of usage, TF off
after MN/NPO p MN for OR [**9-22**].
[**9-22**] Went back to OR today, DC left chest tubes, dc both JP
drains, DC ng tube, placed bovine pericarial matrix on superior
portion of wound, and closed the infraumbilical portion.
Attached vac dressing to superior portion. For vac change on the
18th
