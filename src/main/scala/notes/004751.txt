History of Present Illness:
Pt is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F with a h/o Afib/flutter, CHF(diastolic dysfxn),
HOCM who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**12-15**] with episode of chest pain
radiating to her back, shoulders, and abdomen. Per the pt's
daughter, patient had gone back into afib about 3 weeks ago.
Since that time she has had problems with CHF and fatigue. She
was recently started on diltiazem for rate control and coumadin
for anti-coagulation. Patient was doing okay until the day of
admission when the daughter gave her mother some Mg citrate for
constipation. After taking this she became acutely ill with
nausea and abdominal pain. She was nauseous all day and could
not tolerate PO's and had significant diarrhea. Per the daughter
the patient was not complaining of any chest pain during the

Brief Hospital Course:
Upon arrival to the hospital, in the ED, she was initially
hypotensive and dropped her pressures into the 70's/80's. She
was given 2 L of IVF and went into acute pulmonary edema. At
this time she also became hypertensive. She was given lasix and
started on nitro gtt. Her BP and respiratory status gradually
improved, but she was intubated in anticipation of MRI/A to rule
out aortic dissection. In the MR machine she became transiently
hypotensive. She was given fluid bolus and since then her BP
recovered. She was found to have an elevated WBC and was
empirically given levo/flagyl.
.
MICU course was significant for empiric Abx (discontinued on
transfer to the floor since no clear infection), diuresis, rate
control with BB, CCB. Had one day of  stridor thought secondary
to airway edema post-extubation that resolved after a dose of
racemic epi.  Was started on 240mg dilt and has became brady to
high 30's -> thus dilt was readjusted to 120mg daily.
.
On transfer to the floor:
# Respiratory [**Name (NI) 13115**] Pt had decreasing O2 requirements from 4L
to 2L via NC on the floor. Continued O2 requirement was
attributed due to pleural effusion and atelectasis. She was
gently diuresed with a goal of 500-1L negative w/ 20 po lasix
daily. The pt was thoug
