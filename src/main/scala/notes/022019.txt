History of Present Illness:
54 yr old quadraplegic from MVA with suprapubic catheter, CRI,
recurrent UTI's, hx of seizures. Presenting from NH after
episode of unresponsiveness x three minutes. Documented as non

RA, 118/64. Was two days into Macrobid treatment for UTI.
Brought to [**Hospital1 18**] though receives most of care at [**Hospital1 59561**].

In ED AOx 3, denies episode or mental status change. Initially
120/60, 93% then to 89% RA- 98% 5L (patient and brother reports
NC 2 liters at baseline for COPD), 99.8 axillary. AO x 3 on
arrival. Audible breath sounds and upper respitory sounds.
Erythema, swelling right thigh. EKG NSR 73, ST depressions v1-v2
no comparison, but in ED reported as no change from prior. WBC
9.1, Cr 1.5, Hct 35 unknown baseline.  CXR with no evidence of
infiltrate. 3L NS given, vancomycin 1 gram, Zosyn 4.5 grams
given. Right IJ placed. Admitted for further work up. Patient
reported feeling fine, no worsening SOB from baseline, and
alert. No diarrhea, no BM x 2 days.  Reportedly denied abdominal
pain, fevers, chest pain, SOB. + chills.  Given patient with
waxing MS, admitting resident obtained an ABG PH 7.26/86/81.
lactate to 3.4.
.
Stat MICU consult for transfer, concern for impending
hypercarbic respiratory failure. Mixed disturbance perhaps in
the setting of lactic acidosis from sepsis of several sources,
urine, abdomen, lung. Did not receive any narcotics, benzos.
When arrived in room patient unresponsive. Abdomen increasingly
distended.  Code called stat. Patient with pulse but
respirations to [**4-7**]/minute.  BP stable, 85% on 6L. Non
rebreather, labs with ABG repeat at 7.27/86/50. Lytes stable.
Crit to 30 (down 5pts from prior). Immediately prior to
intubation patient intermittently awoke and was conversant but
then would quickly become somnolent. EKG unchanged. Decision
made with anesthesia to intubate given waxing and waining mental
status. Patient intubated and transferred to the unit. Discussed
with brother via phone. Patient is full code.
.
Upon arrival to the MICU, VS 96.1, 113/56, 70, 17 on 100% on CMV
ventilation, FIO2 100%.  Patient is intubated and sedated.
Bloody mucous is being suctioned from airway.  No obvious pain

CT abdomen/pelvis
1. Increasing abdominal distention likely related to severe
constipation and possible fecal impaction. No CT findings on
this non-contrast study to
suggest ischemia.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions and left greater than right
airspace
consolidation, likely atelectasis.
3. Medullary and caliceal calcifications involving atrophic and
scarred
kidneys bilaterally, suggestive of underlying medullary
nephrocalcinosis.
Bilateral hypoattenuating renal lesions are not fully
characterized on this non-contrast study but likely represent
benign cysts.
4. Gluteal, pelvic, and psoas musculature wasting as well as
multiple
decubital ulcerations extending to the bony surfaces. Regions of
sclerosis
are noted within the adjacent upper sacrum and right ischial
tuberosity which likely reflect changes from subacute or chronic
osteomyelitis. Acute
osteomyelitis cannot be completely excluded and should be
correlated with
clinical exam.

Brief Hospital Course:
54yoM C6 quadraplegic with suprapubic catheter, recurrent UTIs
(h/o ESBL EColi), pseudoseizures, CRI, schizophrenia, and COPD
admitted for hypercarbic respiratory failure and sepsis.

# Acute Hypoxic Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Patient
intubated on the floor for hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory
failure thought to be due to a combination of COPD exacerbation,
pneumonia, and poor pulmonary reserve from quadriplegia.
patient was started on steroids & nebs & antibiotics.  extubated
shortly thereafter with mental status much improved.  His
steroids were tapered and he should complete a 14-day course of
meropenem & vancomycin for health-care associated pneumonia.
started albuterol & atrovent with improvement in wheezing.

# Pneumonia: improving on vancomycin & meropenem.  should finish
14-day course with last day of admit [**12-6**].

# atrial fibrillation: developed combination of atrial fib, a
flutter, ? a tach in setting of frequent nebulizer treatments.
this responded to diltiazem boluses and he was maintained in
sinus rhythm for 18 hours prior to d/c.  He should continue
diltiazem 60mg qid until PCP or medical director decides to
taper.

# Altered mental status: probably from hypercarbic/hypoxic
respiratory failure.  Resolved in the hospital.  He was somewhat
sleepy (although very oriented and appropriate).  His providers
could consider tapering his sedating psychiatric medications in
the future.

#h/o sacral decubitus ulcer: Chronic, 6mo long issue. Denied
pain during admission although sensation questionable
considering quadraplegia. CT showed multiple decubital ulcers
extending to bony surfaces with ?subacute/chronic OM. wound
looks clean and pt has had recent MRI.  PCP to decide [**Name9 (PRE) 80494**]
further work-up for osteomyelitis.

# C6 quad: Restarted spasticity meds, baclofen 10mg PO QID,
after patient was extubated.

# Renal failure: Resolved wtih IVF

# Psychiatric history: ?Paranoid Schizophrenia. After patient
was extubated, began to have paranoid ideation of "people
looking at him" Continued home doses of Risperdal, trazadone,
and Amitriptyline.
