CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis
CT OF CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The soft tissue window
demonstrates shotty mesenteric and hilar nodes, none of which
meet the CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
.
The heart and great vessels appear unremarkable except for
calcifications within the coronary arteries and aorta. No
pericardial effusion is seen. Small bilateral pleural effusion
is noted. On the right side, there are also mild atelectatic
changes at lung base. There is consolidation of the left lower
lobe that has the appearance of the pneumonic infiltrate. There
is also another pneumonic infiltrate noted within the left upper
lobe which also demonstrates air bronchogram. No pulmonary
nodules are seen. Esophagus appears unremarkable.
.
CT OF ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver, gallbladder, spleen,
adrenal glands, kidneys are unremarkable. The pancreas appears
normal. Mild extrahepatic bile duct dilatation is noted with the
common bile duct measuring 8 mm. No dilated bowel loops are
noted. Changes consistent with Billroth type II procedure are
present. No free air or fluid noted in the abdomen. The patient
has well-formed jejunocutaneous fistula. No evidence of an
underlying abscess. Stomach is surgically absent. Shotty
mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes are noted, none of
which meet the CT criteria for pathologic enlargement. Multiple
surgical clips are noted along the retroperitoneum and lateral
pelvic side walls consistent with the patient's history of lymph
node dissection. Severely calcified abdominal aorta is noted.
.
CT OF PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid colon,
urinary bladder, distal ureters are unremarkable. The uterus and
adnexa are not visualized. No free air or fluid noted within the
pelvis. No fluid collection is identified. Surgical clips are
noted within the anterior abdominal wall and anterior pelvis
consistent with the patient's prior surgery.
.
BONE WINDOWS: No concerning lytic or sclerotic lesion is
identified.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. Consolidative change of the left lower lobe and lingular
segment of the left upper lobe suggestive of presence of
multifocal pneumonia. Small bilateral pleural effusions are
present. Mild atelectatic changes are noted at the right lung
base.
2. No pathology is identified within the abdomen to explain the
patient's fever. No abscess cavity is identified. No
cholecystitis is noted.
3. Chronic jejunocutaneous fistula is noted within the left
lower quadrant.
4. Status post lymphadenectomy with multiple surgical clips
noted within the abdomen and pelvis. The patient is also status
post Billroth type II.
.
Echo:
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).  Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging
are consistent with Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic
dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.
.
Barium Swallow:
IMPRESSION:
1. No ring or stricture or mass lesion was noted within the
esophagus however the 13- mm barium tablet was held up in
midesophagus and reproduced the patient' symptoms of dysphagia.
2. No gastroesophageal reflux was noted. No hiatal hernia was
detected. The study was performed in the semi-upright position
since the patient was unable to comply with standup and prone
position.
.
PA and lateral upright chest radiograph compared to [**2174-5-29**], and CT torso from [**2174-5-30**].

The heart size is normal. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
There is no evidence of congestive heart failure.

There is worsening of the basal atelectasis with increased left
pleural effusion which might represent ongoing or even worsened
infectious process in both bases, especially in the left lower
lobe. The previously demonstrated left upper lobe consolidation
is unchanged compared to [**2174-5-29**], but decreased compared to
torso CT from [**2174-5-30**]. Th
