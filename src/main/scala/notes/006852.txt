History of Present Illness:
27 yo male with pmh significant for ETOH abuse and peptic ulcer
who was admitted to the [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital on [**2162-4-22**] for
abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. He was found to have
pancreatitis with lipase  at 2946 at presentation. He was
initially treated on medicine floor with IV fluids and pain
meds. He then became hypotensive and tachycardic. They thought
this was related to ETOH withdraw there was a question of
aspiration and SIRs. There was concern for airway protection and
he was intubated. Initially thought to have evolving ARDS. He
was given fluids and pressors. He self extubated on [**4-28**] and
was placed on bipap intermittently. He had ABD CT studies that
showed extensive swelling of the pancreas with extensive fluid
in the peripancreatic tissue.

He was initially febrile and was started on vanco, flagyl,
imepenem. As per notes he has not been febrile in the last few
days. He had increase abdominal distention consistant with
ascitis and had a paracentesis on [**4-28**] which showed
greenish/brownish fluid with amylase 68, glucose of 132, LDH
1585, which were concerning for necrotizing pancreatitis. There
is no diff of the peritoneal fluid. Both blood and peritoneal
cultures are still pnd. As per discharge summary pt was
hemodynamically stable with BP 130/90, RR 24 and 100% on non
rebreather prior to discharge. Today's his amylase is 47, lipase
80, GGT 289, t.bili 1.6 Na 137, K 4.5, Creatine of 0.6. His WBC
23,000, Hct 30, plts 307K. He also developed [**Doctor First Name 48**] with creatine
3.4 which has improved.

On arrival, he was A+O x3 very anxious with increase WOB, RR
40s, o2 sat 100% on non-rebreather. HR 120 Sinus tachy, BP
142/88, temp 99.7.
He was then intubated due increase work of breathing. During
intubation he desated for a few seconds to 50s% and quickly
