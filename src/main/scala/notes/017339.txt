CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST0 [**2176-8-5**] 12:56 AM
FINDINGS: There is a large acute right subdural hematoma,
measuring 1.3 cm at its maximal thickness which is causing mass
effect on the right cerebral hemisphere, compression of the
right lateral ventricle, 1.4 cm of midline shift to the left,
and subfalcine herniation. There is both a convexity and a
parafalcine component. No other hemorrhages are identified.
Examination is limited by motion, however grossly, the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-
white matter differentiation is preserved throughout. The
surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
The visualized paranasal sinuses show minimal mucosal thickening
within the left maxillary sinus, however, the remaining
paranasal sinuses are well aerated.

IMPRESSION: Large right acute subdural hemorrhage with mass
effect, compression of the right lateral ventricle, midline
shift of 1.4 cm, and subfalcine herniation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and after evaluation was emergently
taken to OR. She did receive FFP and dilantin load at OSH and
another 2 units FFP here. Under general anesthesia she had a
right craniotomy with evacuation of subdural hematoma. Post op
she remained intubated and was brought to CT scan which showed
good evacuation of clot without reaccumulation and then to ICU.
On first post op morning she had spontaneous movement on the
right and withdrew to pain on left. Her SBP was maintained 120
to 140. Incision was clean dry intact. By post op day 2 she was
following commands and was extubated. She did have wheezing and
was started on nebulizers.  Feeding tube was placed. CT of neck
showed no fractures or misalignment and the cervical collar was
removed. CXR were follwed which showed small infiltrate vs
atelectasis in right middle lobe that did not progress. By post
op day 4 she was much more alert.  She did pass a speech and
swallow eval but did better with thick fluids.  She was
transferred out of ICU to neuro step down unit. PT and OT began
to work with patient. Her pre op meds were started. Feeding tube
remained until patient could maintain nutrition and hydration
via POs. She was strted on levofloxacin for UTI.
