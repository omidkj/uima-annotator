Pertinent Results:
Date/Time: [**2170-5-3**] Test Type: TEE (Complete)
Left Ventricle - Septal Wall Thickness:  *0.5 cm  0.6 - 1.1 cm
Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness:  *0.5 cm  0.6 - 1.1 cm

Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension:  *8.6 cm  <= 5.6 cm
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  15% to 20%  >= 55%
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA. All four
pulmonary veins identified and enter the left atrium.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. A catheter or
pacing wire is seen in the RA. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Normal LV wall thickness. Severely
dilated LV cavity. Severely depressed LVEF. LV dysnchrony is
present.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderately dilated RV cavity. Severe global RV
free wall hypokinesis.
AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Normal descending aorta
diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened
aortic valve leaflets. No AS. No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis (MVR).
Thickened MVR leaflets.. Moderate mitral annular calcification.
Moderate thickening of mitral valve chordae.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. No
TS. Moderate [2+] TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or
left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF=15-20
%). Left ventricular dysnchrony is present. The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe global free
wall hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened . There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic
mitral valve prosthesis is present. The prosthetic mitral valve
leaflets are thickened. There is moderate thickening of the
mitral valve chordae. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is no pericardial effusion.

CXR:
[**2170-5-4**]:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**5-3**], there has been
removal of the endotracheal and nasogastric tubes. The Swan-Ganz
catheter also has been removed. Continued enlargement of the
cardiac silhouette without substantial vascular congestion. The
monitoring leads are otherwise intact. There has been
substantial clearing of the opacification in the region of the
aberrant nasogastric tube.

The left chest tube appears to have been removed. No evidence of

pneumothorax. Some subcutaneous gas is seen along the left
lateral chest
well.


Brief Hospital Course:
On [**5-3**] Mr. [**Known lastname 38315**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a lead placement.  Please see the
operative note for details.  He tolerated the procedure well and
was transferred in critical but stable condition to the surgical
intensive care unit.  He was extubated and his chest tubes were
removed.  He progressed well and was transferred to the step
down floor.  [**Company 1543**] ICD interrogated with normal device
funtion.  A 7 day course of antibiotics was started [**2170-5-4**].
He will follow-up in the Device clinic in 1 week. His warfarin
was restarted [**2170-5-5**] and he will follow-up with his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) 104795**] as an outpatient for further coumadin management.
Physical therapy saw him and deemed him safe for home. By
post-operative day 3 he was ready for discharge to home.  All
follow-up appointments were advised.
