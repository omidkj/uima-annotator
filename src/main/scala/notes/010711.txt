Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC placement


History of Present Illness:
68 year-old man with history of COPD (home O2, only using O2 at
night) and hepatocellular carcinoma who initially present
[**Hospital 6783**] hospital with shortness of breath and cough.
Information was gatherered from patient and OSH notes.

States symptoms began suddenly on [**3-12**] at noon. Had associated
nonproductive cough in the setting of reduced PO intake but
denied any fevers, chills, chest pain or palpitations. Of note
patient was recently admitted and treated for PNA in [**10/2116**] and
states that he has not quite the same ever since. States that he
has been in and out rehab since then, last discharged in
12/[**2116**].

On arrival to OSH, initial VS were BP 169/53 HR 88 RR 32 and
initial ABG revealed respiratory acidosis with PCO2 in 80s.
Dyspnea reportedly improved on BiPAP and bronchodilators. CXR
was suggestive of pneumonia and he was started on Vancomycin and
Ceftazidime there. He was continued on continuous nebs and
started on solumedrol 125mg IV x 1. Also received a full dose
aspirin. Given need for BiPAP, patient was to be admitted to the
ICU. However because there were no available ICU beds, patient
was tranferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. VS prior to
admission were BP 105/47 HR 62 RR 24 SpO2 97% on BiPAP (FiO2
60%).

On arrival to the ICU, patient states that his breathing feels
somewhat improved however continues to have significant
difficulty with breathing. Denied orthopnea or PND.

EKG [**3-13**]:
Baseline artifact. Sinus tachycardia. Inferior and precordial ST
segment
depressions with T wave abnormalities. Since the previous
tracing of [**2115-4-11**] the rate is faster. ST-T wave abnormalities
are now more prominent.

CXR [**3-13**]:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. Mild generalized interstitial thickening, combined to
mild distention of the pulmonary vessels, likely to be caused by
a combination of COPD and fluid overload. The size of the
cardiac silhouette is at the upper range of normal. No newly
appeared focal parenchymal opacities, no larger pleural
effusions.

CXR [**3-14**]:
1. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Left subclavian
PICC line
remains in place having its tip in the mid superior vena cava.
There
continues to be a diffuse interstitial abnormality with more
focal changes at the right base which are felt to likely be
post-inflammatory. No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. No large
pleural effusions. The lungs are somewhat hyperinflated with
flattened diaphragms, which could reflect an underlying
component of emphysema. Clinical correlation is advised.

EKG [**3-16**]:
Sinus rhythm. Since the previous tracing there is more baseline
artifact, the rate is somewhat faster. T wave abnormalities in
lead aVF are less prominent

CXR [**3-16**]:
IMPRESSION: Persistent diffuse interstitial abnormality, most
prominent in
the right lung base demonstrates interval regression from
[**2117-3-14**]. No new
focal consolidation or opacity.

ECHO:
Very suboptimal image quality. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF 70%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve is not
well seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. Tricuspid regurgitation may be present but cannot be
quantified. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
prominent fat pad.

HEAD CT [**3-18**]:
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Two small hypodense lesions in the left pons that may
represent old
lacunar infarcts. This is unchanged compared to study on [**5-24**], [**2114**].
3. Sulci and ventricles are mildly prominent consistent with
atrophy.

CTA CHEST [**3-19**]:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
2.Diffuse bronchial wall thickening, bronchial fluid and/or
mucus plugging involving the bilateral lower lobes, with
intralobular septal thickening and centrilobular ground-glass
nodular densities in right and left lower lobes and lingula.
Findings are suggestive of aspiration and/or superimposed
atypical infection.
3. New nodules in the right upper and superior segment of right
lower lobe
measuring 5 and 7 mm are worrisome for metastases in the setting
of
hepatocellular carcinoma. However, given a possible superimposed
infectious process, short-interval followup is recommended with
CT within three months.
4. Limited imaging of the known treated HCC within the liver.
5. Findings consistent with subacute fractures of the right
seventh and
eighth ribs.
6. Emphysema.

UPPER EXTREMITY U/S [**3-20**]:
No evidence of hematoma in
