Brief Hospital Course:
#Sepsis: Ms [**Known lastname **] was hypotensive and hypoxic on admission and was
intubated and required pressors.  Lactate was 9.1.  She was
treated empirically for hospital-acquired pneumonia with
cefepime and vancomycin; this was narrowed to cefepime after
sputum cultures returned positive for pseudomonas aeruginosa.
UA was positive and culture also grew pseudomonas.  A 14-day
course of cefepime was planned.

For some concern of c. diff colitis she was initially treated
with PO vancomycin, but this was discontinued after toxin assays
returned negative.  Other sources of infection considered
included her various decubitus ulcers, her burn-related ulcer,
and her necrotic great toe.

Pressors were weaned after 48 hours; her BP remained stable
throughout the remainder of her hospitalization.   Her
ventilator settings were gradually weaned and she was extubated
on HD#7, which she tolerated.

She was discharged with the plan to continue her IV antibiotics
via PICC for a 14-day course.

#Left upper extremity DVT: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was noted to have an
edematous left arm during hospitalization in the setting of a
left internal jugular catheter.  Ultrasound demonstrated a
cephalic vein DVT.  Heparin was begun and changed to lovanox on
HD#7, but it was then decided that the risks of anticoagulation
exceed the benefits, and this was discontinued.

#Nutrition: Ms. [**Known lastname 87266**] gastric tube was clogged after her son
administered a tube feeding.  The tube then fell out when it was
flushed.  It was then replaced by a gastrojejunal tube, selected
to decrease aspiration risk, which was sutured into place.

#[**Last Name (un) **]: Ms. [**Known lastname **] originally had a creatinine of 1.2 on admission
which was attributed to prerenal factors.  Creatinine decreased
to 0.4 with blood pressure support and fluids.

#Anemia: Hct trended down from 30 to 26, where it stabilized,
during hospitalization.

#DM: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was managed on an ISS, which was decreased on HD#3
following an episode of hypoglycemia.  On discharge, she was
returned to her home regimen of metformin.

#Goals of care: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was eventually made DNR/DNI after
discussions with her sons, and was discharged to home with
hospice services.
