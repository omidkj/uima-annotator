HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 47-year-old
female with multiple medical problems admitted to [**Hospital3 418**] Hospital on [**2195-3-1**] with abdominal pain, nausea,
and vomiting, found to have a UTI with leukocytosis, felt to
be pyelonephritis, treated with levofloxacin and gentamicin.
Despite this treatment, her renal function has been
declining.  Her most recent creatinine was 1.1 in [**2189**], but
on admission there, it was 2.4.  It has risen to 8.3.  She is
transferred here for further care.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hepatitis C.

Esophageal varices.

Diabetes.

Chronic renal insufficiency.

Substance abuse.

History of gallstones.

ALLERGIES:  CODEINE.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1. Insulin.
2. Compazine.
3. Klonopin.
4. Heparin subcutaneous.
5. Prevacid.
6. Vistaril.
7. Demerol.
8. Methadone.
9. Risperdal.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature was 96.2,
blood pressure 110/54, pulse 92, respiratory rate 20,
saturating 95 percent on room air.  In general, she is an
obese black female in no acute distress.  HEENT was
unremarkable.  Cardiac exam was within normal limits.
Abdomen was soft, obese, nontender.  Lower extremities
revealed 2 plus edema.  Skin was warm and weeping.
Neurologic was oriented times 3 but somewhat inattentive.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Included a
creatinine of 8.2, BUN of 98, white blood count of 10.6,
hematocrit 30.3, platelets of 180.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
medical floor but subsequently developed respiratory distress
requiring intubation.  She was therefore transferred to the
ICU.  She was continued on antibiotics for a presumed
diagnosis of pyelonephritis.  Despite aggressive treatment
with antibiotics, we were unable to control her white blood
cell count, which continued to be elevated.  After several
weeks in the hospital, she developed positive blood cultures
for candidemia.  She was treated with antifungals.  All lines
were changed but despite this, the candidemia persisted.  She
subsequently underwent hemodynamic compromise requiring
multiple pressors.  After several days, intubated on multiple
pressors, discussion was held with the family.  It was deemed
to make the patient DNR/DNI due to the fact that CPR would
likely be unsuccessful.  On [**2195-5-9**], the patient
subsequently expired.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Expired.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Expired.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  None.

FOLLOW-UP PLAN:  None.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Pyelonephritis.

Acute renal failure.
