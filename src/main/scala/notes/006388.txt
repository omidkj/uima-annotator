Brief Hospital Course:
Sepsis: On arrival to the floor, she became hypotensive which
was unresponsive to IVF and she was transferred to the ICU. She
received a few hours of IV dopamine but was then weaned off with
spontaneous improvement in her blood pressures. While in the
unit, [**2-28**] blood culture bottles grew out GPCs in pairs and
clusters. She was continued on vanco for presumed recurrent MRSA
line infection. Her tunnelled HD line was removed for a line
holiday, then replaced by interventional radiology once repeat
blood cultures were negative for growth. Patient currently on
DAY [**7-8**] of treatment with Vancomycin. She will need to complete
a full course for 14 days and then have blood cultures checked a
few days later to ensure resolution of the infection.
.

Elevated transaminases: Pt was also noted to have elevated
transaminases and direct bilirubin, likely due to cholestasis.
Pt was very itchy without jaundice. PBC was ruled out as
anti-mitochondrial antibody was negative. RUQ u/s ruled out
cholelithiasis/cholecystitis. Pt was symptomatically treated
with benadryl with improvement of symptoms.
.

CHF: The importance of ACE inhibitors and beta blockers as a
part of her heart failure regimen was discussed with patient but
pt refused to take lisinopril. Beta blockers were not started
because of pt's low-normal blood pressure. These medications
should restarted as tolerated at rehabilitation facility.
.

Diarrhea: Pt developed diarrhea while receiving Vancomycin for
her line infection. Stool was checked for C. diff toxin and was
negative x 2.
.

Diabetes: Pt's blood sugars were labile throughout her hospital
stay. We are discharging her on Insulin NPH 8 units in the
morning and Insulin Lispro sliding scale. Her insulin regimen
should be titrated up or down at the rehabilitation facility
according to her finger sticks, and she should be kept on a
consistent diet.
