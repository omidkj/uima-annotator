Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6075**]
Chief Complaint:
found unresponsive by family

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation and mechanical ventilation
External ventricular drain placed [**2105-5-5**]
Cerebral angiography [**2105-5-7**]

History of Present Illness:
75 year old man with a history of hypertension was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] after being found unresponsive by wife.

Per family, patient had been shopping throughout the morning
with his wife.  They currently live in an apartment and are
selling their house. They stopped by the house ~11am to check on
it, and pt went around to back deck to make sure back door was
locked. Wife waited in the car. She reports that he got out of
the car slowly and with difficulty and then seemed to walk fine.
3-4 minutes later when he had not returned, she drove car around
and saw him laying face up on the back deck. She reports that
his eyes were open and at midline gaze, but he was unresponsive.

EMS was immediately activated and found the patient with "agonal
breathing and no gag reflex."  He was subsequently sedated with
versed and intubated in the field and brought to [**Hospital3 60734**]. There a head CT uncovered a subarachnoid hemorrhage
and he was noted to be in atrial fibrillation on EKG (no
previous history of afib).  He was then transferred emergently
to [**Hospital1 18**] ER for neurosurgical evaluation.  He arrived here at
2:20 pm.  He was treated with flagyl, levaquin, dilantin, and
tylenol (febrile to 101.8).  The neurosurgery service did not
feel an intervention was warranted and requested evaluation by
neurology at 5 pm.

According to family, he has history of gait difficulties and
moving "slowly." About 3 months ago, pt was evaluated for ?NPH
by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10132**] in Neurology at [**Hospital3 **] with lumbar
puncture. Family reports some improvement in gait after tap.
Repeat LP was planned for early [**Month (only) **] to re-evaluate and
determine if diagnosis of NPH was correct. Family reports that
for the last ~3 weeks his gait had again started to worsen, with
him moving more slowly, especially getting in and out of car.

Review of systems largely unobtainable since pt intubated and
unresponsive. Family does reports that pt complained of
"dizziness" last week. He had not told them of any other
problems.

He had been moving about "slow" all morning, and in fact for the
last few weeks per his son.

Head CT/CTA ([**5-2**]): Extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage in the
quadrigeminal cistern, right sylvian fissure, right occipital
[**Doctor Last Name 534**], right frontal horns, bilateral posterior parietal regions,
around the posterior interhemispheric fissure and along the
falx. These findings are suspicious for traumatic subarachnoid
hemorrhage. Hemorrhagic dural metastasis is a possibility but
considered very less likely. Bifrontal subdural hygroma is noted
of uncertain clinical significance. Punctate hemorrhage in the
pons, which may represent a tiny shear injury. Hemorrhage is
also noted adjacent to the interhemispheric fissure in the right
lateral ventricle. CT angiogram demonstrates good flow in the
anterior and posterior circulation. No definite aneurysms or
vascular malformation.


Brief Hospital Course:
75M h/o HTN found unresponsive by wife and neurological exam
with comatose mental status, and few lateralizing focal
deficits. Head CT with multiple intraparenchymal and
subarachnoid hemorrhages. Pt was admitted to the neurology ICU
for further management.

1. Neuro: Etiology of subarachnoid bleeds is unclear, though
most likely related to trauma as pt was found down, lying on his
back. Alternative possibilities included aneurysm or vascular
malformation in the brainstem that bled, resulting in fall which
then caused traumatic SAH. The somewhat nodular appearance on CT
of the bleeds also suggested possible dural metastases as
etiology.  MRI with contrast showed no evidence of dural
metastases or other enhancing lesions. CSF cytology was negative
for malignant cells. Neither MRA nor CTA showed aneurysm, but
MRI with contrast did have some enhancement in the brainstem
near the intraparenchymal bleed, so vascular malformation was
still possible. On [**2105-5-7**] (day #5 since SAH) a cerebral
angiogram was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in Interventional
Neuroradiology. Angiogram showed no evidence of aneurysm,
vascular malformation or vasospasm. Thus, most likely etiology
of bleed is traumatic as result of fall backwards onto deck.
Etiology of fall is somewhat unclear. Two most likely
possibilities are secondary to patient's gait disorder, or could
be due to sinus pauses on conversion from afib back to sinus
rhythm (see below for more details).

Patient remained minimally responsive for the first 14 days in
the hospital. He was started on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis
given the likely closed-head injury and the subarachnoid blood.
An EEG was performed to ensure that he was not having
subclinical, nonconvulsive seizures as the cause of his
decreased alertness. It showed rare blunt and sharp waves over
the right posterior quandrant, no epileptiform activity, and
generalized delta frequency slowing suggesting a moderate to
severe encephalopathy.


--still with minimal resposiveness
--nimodipine 60 q4h and dilantin for SAH
--EEG prelim read with no epileptiform and mod-severe
encephalopathy
--Repeat CT [**5-5**] with more blood around midbrain/pons and
worsening hydrocephalus, so neurosurg put vent drain in
--MRI and CT of C-spine with no injury-->d/c'd hard collar
--neurosurg following
--angio [**5-7**]--no aneurysm, no AVM seen, no vasospasm either. All
looked good. Will keep SBP 110-140s where its been

-nimodipine and dilantin/keppra eventually discontinued as
patient showed no evidence of seizure activity or vasospasm

2. Pulm: Intubated, vented. Had been doing well on FiO2 0.30
with PO2 ~100 but on [**5-5**] had PO2 ~60 and had to increase FiO2
to 0.40. Has PNA--see ID below
3. ID: Has been persistently febrile (101-102), unclear
[**Name2 (NI) **]--SAH vs infection. WBC still normal, but on [**5-5**] had
incr'd O2 requirement and thick yellow sputum. Sputum from [**5-4**]
with Serratia. Started CTX on [**5-5**]. CXR [**5-6**] with RLL opacity and
right effusion. Changed abx to levoflox on [**5-7**] as Serratia tends
to become resistant to cephalosporins per lab, on [**5-21**] found to
be cipro resistant, so then switched to meropenum
.
4. CV:
a) Afib with RVR: on night of [**5-3**] starting having afib/RVR (no
history of such, though ?found by EMS in afib per son) and
started on amio IV load A
