Brief Hospital Course:
pt was admitted to the interventional pulmonology service.  She
was initially stablized and her respiratory status monitored.
This was done in the ICU.  On HD 3 she underwent transbroncheal
biopsy of suspicious looking cat scan findings, the pathology of
which is still pending.  After her biopsy however, her condition
improved without any direct intervention.  Her oxygen
requirement improved, as did her objective examination.  She had
been started on prednisone as well, which appeared to help, she
will continue this as a taper as an outpt.  On HD 5 she was
doing well, but due to social circumstances, had to stay until
HD 6, when she was d/c'ed home.
