Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered Mental Status, Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
lumbar puncture
CVL placement

History of Present Illness:
42F OSH transer with severe lupus with cryoglobulinemia
vasculitis (on Cellcept, Prednisone, recently being tx for a
flare), CAD 3VD s/p multiple MI's and stenting (EF 20%) s/p V
Fib arrest (date unknown) with AICD, trace MR, chronic pain (on
Methadone) that presents altered mental status and hypoxia.
.
The patient was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2108-12-21**] for
"dehydration and change in mental status". Per [**Hospital3 **]
Records, the pt presented following 2-3 days of nausea,
vomitting, decreased POs and confusion. No fevers, headache.
.
Initial vitals at OSH: 97 105 130/80 20 (no 02 sat given). Exam
notable for PERRLA, supple neck, normal cardiopulmonary exam ,
RLE ulcerations, not oriented with intact cranial nerves. Labs
notable for WBC 6.7, Hb 9.2, Na 147, BUN 25, Cr 0.9, UA with
15-20 WBCs, negative nitrites, leuk esterase, +ketones. Initial
impression at OSH was that patient potentially had a UTI, and
given her poor IV access, was admitted for IVF resusciation via
CVL and treated for a UTI with Levaquin 500mg IV. Non-Contrast
Head CT unrevealing.
.
On [**2108-12-22**] the pt was noted to have 1 episode of hemoptysis and
subsequently underwent a non-contrast chest CT that was
unrevealing for any infiltrates or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Lungs were noted to have subsegmental atelectasis.
.
OSH evaluation by Cardiology on [**2108-12-22**] for sinus tachycardia
(rate 160-180s) and mild troponin bump (0.4, 0.5), recommended
patient be transfused for Hct of 30. Pt received 1pRBC on
[**2108-12-22**]. The pt was given IV Lopressor and a Diltazem gtt. BP
remained stable. Troponins at OSH were noted to be 0.4 ([**2108-12-21**])
-> 0.5 ([**2108-12-22**]). CVP 6-10, noted to be +2.3L (2600:I, 300:O).
ABG 7.41/23/73.
.
OSH evaluation by Pulmonology on [**2108-12-23**] for hypoxia and
question signs of pneumonitis, however at the time the pulmonary
team felt the pt to be in decompensated systolic CHF (given CXR
finding of pulmomary edema), and recommended diuresis. The pt
was subsequently diureses with Bumex 3mg IV x1.
.
At the OSH the patient remained delerious and confused noted to
be "rhyming words". OSH team felt believed some of her symptoms
may have been secondary to narcotic and/or benzo withdrwal (as
evidence by flushing and diaphoresis) and thus, she was also
receiving Morphine IV and Valium q6H. Given a concern of sepsis
in a patient with MS changes and tachycardia the pt was given
Vancomycin 1gm IVx1 and Zosyn 3.375mg IVx1 on [**2108-12-23**] (nursing
report listed Cefepime 2gm IV however no record seen in med
rec). The pt remained afebrile while at [**Hospital3 **] with all
cultures NGTD. In addition the pt's prednisone was changed to
Methylprednisolone 125mg IV q8H (unclear if pt received dose).
.
The patient was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.
.
Further history from the patients family revealed that the
patient was last in her usual state of health five days ago. At
baseline she cannot walk secondary to severe OA of the hips and
vasular ulcers and pressure ulcers of the feet.  She developed
N&V x4d prior to presentation and stopped taking her medications
(including ativan and methadone).  She had diarrhea x 2.
.
According to the family she did not have fevers, chills, chest
pain, difficulty breathing or abdominal pain.  She was not
having dysuria but they did notice increased urinary frequency.
She noted discomfort in her left arm but it is unclear whether
this was pain or weakness. She noted difficulty [**Location (un) 1131**] (?
visual changes) but no headaches or neck pain.  On Wednesday,
[**2108-12-19**] she was noted to be confused and not speaking in full
sentences.  Since that time her mental status has waxed and
waned but she has not been conversant.  She has no recent
medication changes with the exception of the addition of a beta
blocker.  She takes chronic xanax and methadone.  She has an
allergy to IV contrast but the allergy is unknown.  She does not
take coumadin.
.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the patient is unable to speak
conherently but is alert, but unable to accurately follow
commands.

FINDINGS:
ABNORMALITY #1: There is a moderate to marked amount of artifact
in
local and generalized fashion making much of this recoding
uninterpretable. In those portions of the record that could be
read,
there was slowing and disorganization of the background rhythm.
