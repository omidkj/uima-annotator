Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
Esophageal Variceal Hemorrhage

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation, Mechanical Ventilation, EGD Without Intervention,
IVC Filter Placement.


History of Present Illness:
55 yo man with hx of alcoholism, admitted with GI bleed to OSH,
with gelatinous bright red blood emesis, and weakness, found to
be unresponsive, BP 68/38, HR 130s, HCT 19 at [**Hospital3 7569**].
He was then was intubated for airway protection, given 2uPRBC
and 2-3L NS, SBP came up to 100. Pt transferred here to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further evaluation.  In the MICU, he received 9 units pRBC,
4 units FFP (for coagulopathy that has since resolved).  He was
seen by GI who did multiple EGDs; these showed no active
bleeding, grade 2 esophageal varices, and portal gastropathy.
No intevention was performed.  He was also seen by neuro for
some ?myoclonic jerks that were thought to be [**2-25**] etoh
withdrawal vs. anoxic brain injury vs. hepatic encephalopathy.
His hct stabilized and he had no more episodes of active
bleeding.  He was extubated on [**4-9**], but his MS continues to wax
and wane.  He is currently completing a 10 day course of
Vancomycin for ?GPC in sputum. He also completed an 8 day course
of Levo/flagyl for SBP ppx given his ascites.

Also during the MICU course, abdominal US showed diffusely
coarsened and heterogeneous hepatic echotexture, consistent with
cirrhosis. No focal lesions identified. Small amount of
perihepatic ascites. Patent portal veins, with flow in the
appropriate direction. He had a TTE that showed only mild MR.
[**Name13 (STitle) **] jad a swam placed; numbers did not implicate a primary
cardiac cause for his initial hypotension.  Abd CT showed showed
mesenteric edema, some diverticuli. MRI of head showed mild to
mod age-inappropriate brain atrophy.

He was transferred to the floor when hct was stable; MS is still
waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**], and he is still not able to adequately take
PO's.

Pertinent Results:
ABD U/S ([**2133-3-31**]): IMPRESSION: 1) Diffusely coarsened and
heterogeneous hepatic echotexture, consistent with cirrhosis. No
focal lesions identified. Small amount of perihepatic ascites.
2) Patent portal veins, with flow in the appropriate direction.

EGD ([**2133-3-31**]): Impression: Grade II varices were noted in the
lower esophagus but last 4 cm of esophagus appeared fibrotic
with no varices, consistent with possible prior endoscopic
therapy. No bleeding noted from the esophagus. Mostly old, and
some fresh blood in the stomach - ?bleeding from proximal
stomach. Erythema and congestion in the whole stomach compatible
with portal gastropathy and hypoalbuminemia. Otherwise normal
egd to second part of the duodenum.

L LE U/S ([**2133-4-19**]): IMPRESSION: There is a crescenteric-shaped
thrombus within the left common femoral vein, which is only
partially occlusive. Acuity of this can not be determined, and
this may be an acute thrombus. These correspond to the findings
on recent CT scan.

CT TORSO/PELVIS ([**2133-4-18**]): IMPRESSION: 1) 3.4-cm aneurysm
arising from the proximal left common iliac artery. 2) Apparent
peripheral filling defect within the left superficial femoral
vein. While this could represent artifact, an ultrasound could
be performed to evaluate for the presence of thrombus in this
patient with history of left femoral vein catheterization. 3)
Diverticulosis with no CT evidence of diverticulitis. 4) Sludge
and stones within a nondistended gallbladder. 5) Moderate amount
of intra-abdominal ascites with a nodular liver contour,
findings suggestive of cirrhosis. 6) Small bilateral pleural
effusions with associated atelectasis. 7) Emphysema. 8)
Bilateral low-attenuation lesions within both kidneys, likely
representative of simple cysts. A focal area of dense
calcification is also present adjacent to a cystic area of low
attenuatiuon within the posterior right kidney.
