History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness: 83F with hx of COPD on 2L home O2,
pulm HTN, and [**Hospital **] transferred from BIDN and admitted to the MICU
for hypotension and SOB concerning for cardiogenic shock. Pt
presented to BIDN ED with dehydration and, per report, has been
having poor PO intake over the last few weeks due to low
appetite and was found to be hypotensive to as low as the 70's
systolically with [**Last Name (un) **] (Cr of 1.4 from prior baseline of 0.9).
She was otherwise asymptomatic and this was assessed as severe
dehydration and was given 5L of fluid without response to blood
pressure. Patient was started on dopamine became tachycardic to
130s without much improvement in blood pressure, he was switched
to phenylephrine and patient was transferred for further workup.
Arrived to our ED without central access. Of note, patient has
noticed dark stools for the last 2 days but denies bright red
blood per rectum and was guaiac positive at OSH ED with crit of
25.9 down from prior baseline of high 30's. UA negative, UCx and
BCx sent. She also describes some nausea and a 10 pound
unintentional weight loss in the last month. She otherwise
denies fevers, chills, chest pain, abdominal pain, vomiting,
diarrhea, urinary symptoms, or localized numbness, weakness, or
tingling.
.
ED Course:
In the ED, initial vitals were: T 98.8, HR 83, BP 90/48, RR 16,
SvO2 93% 10L NRB.
-BP's in the 70-80's systolically on neosyneprhine
-CVL RIJ placed
-Started on norepinephrine with good response
-Given stress dose hydrocort
-CXR with b/l pleural effusions and fluid overload
-BNP 3800
-CVP 12
-EKG with new q-waves
-Trop of 0.11 (0.139 @ OSH)
-WBC 15.9, PLT 618, INR 1.4, Cr 1.2
-Lactete 3.2 -> 1.8
-Bedside echo with good squeeze per report
-Cardiology consulted and saw patient in ED, discovered that [**12-26**]
weeks ago she had moderate chest pressure that woke her from
sleep 2 nights in a row for which she did not seek medical care.
Reviewed her EKG which demonstrated NSR @ 97, NA, NI, new
inferior Q waves, late transition with anterior Q waves, and
anterolateral ST and T changes consistent with old MI. Recs for
plavix load, high dose atorva, serial enzymes, urgent bedside
TTE, and intervention as soon as possible or in case of
mechanical complication.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS: Afebrile, 96, 91/53, 18,
94% 10L NRB. Patient feels comfortable and is pleasant but SOB.
She confirms the above history.

   MRSA SCREEN (Pending):
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2108-4-5**] 9:24 PM
IMPRESSION: Opacification of the lower lungs, greater on the
right than left, probably reflecting pleural effusions and
associated atelectasis, although an infectious process is hard
to exclude. Regular lung markings and architecture suggesting
there may be emphysema.

Portable TTE (Focused views) Done [**2108-4-6**] at 1:00:00 AM
FINAL
Conclusions
Poor image quality. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is probably preserved (LVEF>50%).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
ventricular septal defect. RV with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

EKG: NSR @ 97, NA, NI, Q waves in II, III, TWI's in I, V5, V6,
poor r-wave progression


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 83F with hx of COPD, HTN, Pulm HTN, and
remote smoking hx admitted to the MICU with GIB, evidence of
recent inferior MI, pneumonia and hypotension/septic shock
requiring pressor support.
.
# Pneumonia/septic shock/Hypoxia: Patient presented with hypoxia
and left lower lobe consolidation. She was started on broad
spectrum antibiotics and pressors for blood pressure support.
Sputum cultures grew Staph Aureus which had been appropriately
covered by vancomycin. However, she continued to require
pressors and continued to clinically deteriorate. Multiple
discussion were held regarding goals of care. Initially the goal
was to wean her off pressors so that she could go home with
hospice. However she was not able to be weaned off. SHe was then
made CMO and her pressors and antibiotics were stopped. She was
started on morphine drip for comfort and she passed away shortly
after.
.
# Recent Inferior MI c/b Cardiogenic Shock: She had evidence of
a new inferior MI
on her EKG. Because of her hypotension it was initially thought
that she had a component of cardiogenic shock. An echo was
performed which showed preserved LVEF, in conjunction with low
central venous pressure makes cardiogenic shock highly unlikely.
.
# Concern for UGIB: Patient's hematocrit
