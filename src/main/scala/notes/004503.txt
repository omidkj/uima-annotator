Brief Hospital Course:
IABP was placed in the cath lab. She was taken emergently to the
operating room where she underwent a CABG x 3. While in the
operating room she also underwent endoscopy which showed
esophagitis, clotted blood and duodentitis, but no active
bleeding, and her right femoral vein was repaired. She was
transferred to the ICU with her chest open on milrinone,
epinephrine, levophed, vasopressin and amiodarone. She was given
vanocmycin perioperatively for her open chest. Her pressors were
weaned slowly. She was seen by ID to evaluate need for
antibiotics. She was taken back to the operating room on [**12-3**]
where her chest was closed. HIT antibody was negative. IABP was
weaned and removed and epi was weaned to off on [**12-4**]. Her
ventilator was weaned but she had no cuff [**Last Name (LF) 3564**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she remained
intubated, was given steroids, and was extubated to BiPAP on
[**12-6**]. She developed serous sternal drainage, and remained on
vancomycin. She developed atrial fibrillation and was started on
amiodarone and coumadin. She developed a small area of necrosis
at the distal end of her incision. She developed a fever,
increased white count and hypotension, her antibiotic coverage
was broadened to vanco and zosyn and her sternal incision was
opened and packed at the distal end. She was restarted on
levophed. A line tip culture grew yeast and she was started on
fluconazole. She was seen by opthamology and there were no signs
of fungal eye infection. A VAC dressing was placed to her
sternal wound. On [**12-14**] she fell after attempting to get out of
bed herself. Head CT was negative. She continued to require
BiPAP. A dobhoff was placed for tube feeding. Sternal wound grew
[**Female First Name (un) **]. On [**12-19**] she was reintubated for respiratory failure and
left lung collapse. Bronchoscopy showed mucous plug in left main
bronchus. She was again extubated to BiPap on [**12-21**]. She again
required` intubation but refused despite repiratory distress.
She eventually agreed to bronchoscopy on [**12-24**] which showed
malacia and tenacious secretions that plugged bronchoscope, and
she required intubation to clear secretions. During intubation
her blood pressure dropped and she lost her pulse. She was
resuscitated.  She failed spontaneous breathing trial.
Thoracentesis on [**12-28**] for 1 liter serosnaguinous fluid. Seen by
thoracic surgery for ? of hemothorax. Chest tube was placed for
400 cc old blood. Tracheostomy and PEG tube placed on [**1-4**]. She
was started on a lasix drip and then transitioned to IV laasix
and zarozolyn. Bronchoscopy on [**1-8**] ahowed thick clear
secretions bilaterally. BAL sent at that time gram stain
negative. Patient was changed back to pressure support
ventilation after bronchoscopy. She remained hemodynamically
stable and on [**1-10**] was transferred to rehab at [**Last Name (un) 8612**] in
