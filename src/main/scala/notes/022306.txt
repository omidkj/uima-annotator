Pertinent Results:
Echo [**2143-9-2**]: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the right atrium or right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There
is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
akinetic mid anterior/septal/lateral/inferor walls and apex.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 10-15%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. POST OP
CABG: No change in [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular systolic function. MR is still
mild.
CXR [**2143-9-3**]: There is no pneumothorax or appreciable pleural
effusion following removal of midline and pleural drains. Slight
interval increase in cardiomediastinal diameter is a normal
development after tracheal extubation, accompanied by slightly
lower lung volumes. Right jugular sheath is now sharply kinked
in the portion projecting over the left neck, while the tip is
at the level of the junction of the brachiocephalic veins. Lungs
are grossly clear. No appreciable pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI Mr. [**Known lastname 73763**] was admitted prior to
surgery for further work-up and cardiology (heart failure)
consult. Following work-up and being cleared by cardiology he
was brought to the operating room where he underwent an off-pump
coronary artery bypass graft x 2. Echo in OR revealed only mild
MR and therefore this was not repaired. Please see surgical
report for details. Following surgery he was transferred to the
CVIICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. Within 24
hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact
and extubated. He required Neo for two days post-op and once
weaned beta blockers were started. He was also started on
diuretics and gently diuresed towards his pre-op weight. On
post-op day one his chest tubes were removed. On post-op day two
he was transferred to the SDU for further care. On post-op day
three his epicardial pacing wires were removed. By POD 6 Mr
[**Known lastname 73763**] had met all the PT goals, he remained hemodynamically
stable and it was determined he was ready for discharge to home.
