History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 71F with a history of COPD, DM, CAD, and multiple other
medical problems presenting with a two-day history of increasing
dyspnea, marked decrease in functional capacity, and increased
wheezing and cough productive of whitish-clear sputum.  The
patient states that this episode was very similar to COPD flares
the patient has experienced in the past, and the patient did not
want to go to the hospital but felt she had to.  The patient
denies fevers, but does note occasional chills that appear to be
recurrent.  Significantly, the patient reports that in the days
prior to the onset of the patient's symptoms, she noted that she
felt that she was "coming down with something." The patient
admits to chest tightness while coughing, but denies other CP,
palpitations, and nausea/vomiting.  Of note, the patient admits
to a previous, but less severe, COPD exacerbation for which she
was seen on [**2171-7-30**] by her PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was given an 8 day
prednisone taper and her symptoms rapidly resolved.

.
CXR Admission: PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained.
There are no new parenchymal abnormalities in the lungs. Areas
of probable scarring are noted in the left lower lung. No
evidence of CHF or pneumonia. No pleural effusion or
pneumothorax is seen. Relative upper [**Name2 (NI) 3630**] lucency and splaying
of bronchial vasculature is again noted, likely related to
underlying COPD. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Left
humeral head prosthesis is again noted. Osseous structures
appear stable. Clips are noted in the right upper quadrant.
.
KUB [**2171-8-28**]: Dilated loops of colon with no air seen in the
rectum suggestive of colonic ileus or possible toxic megacolon.
Early distal obstruction cannot be excluded secondary to paucity
of air noted in the rectum.
.
CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST [**2171-8-28**]: Liver appears normal. No
evidence of intra- or extra-hepatic bile duct dilation. Patient
is status post cholecystectomy. Pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands
and kidneys appear normal. There is a 1.6 cm parapelvic cyst in
the interpolar region of the right kidney. The tip of the
nasogastric tube is in the stomach. No evidence of mesenteric or
retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Right renal artery stent
unchanged in appearance. Small bowel is unremarkable.

Scattered sigmoid diverticula without evidence of
diverticulitis. There is
gaseous distention of the colon from the cecum through the
sigmoid colon where it tapers gradually to the decompressed
rectum. No evidence of volvulus, pneumatosis, a transition point
or obstructing mass lesion. The ascending colon is dilated up to
approximately 10 cm.

Note is made of an anterior midline healed surgical scar.

CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Bladder is distended and appears
normal. Uterus is unremarkable. No evidence of pelvic or
inguinal lymphadenopathy.

BONE WINDOWS: Multilevel degenerative changes are seen in
