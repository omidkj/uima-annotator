HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary
artery disease status post a recent two-vessel coronary
artery bypass graft on [**2124-2-17**], diabetes, hypertension, and
a recently noted right upper lobe lung nodule on prior CT
scan, who presents to the hospital on [**2124-3-3**] for wheezing
and dyspnea noted by VNA at home.  He was initially admitted
to Surgical Intensive Care Unit when found to have a sodium
of 112 in the Emergency Department.  He was also noted to
have bilateral crackles and evidence of some congestive heart
failure on initial chest x-ray.

Patient had previously had an uneventful postoperative course
on his prior admission except for some hyponatremia which had
been evaluated, admit by the medical consult team.  Most
recently the patient's sodium had been 126 on [**2124-2-20**], and he had been sent home with a presumptive diagnosis
of chronic hyponatremia, possibly SIADH, and prescribed
sodium tablets.  He was planned to followup for workup of his
right upper lobe lung nodule.

On [**2124-3-3**], he was noted to be dyspneic with some wheezing
at home per the VNA.  The patient was admitted to the MICU
where he received 3% hypertonic saline.  Was placed on 1
liter fluid restriction and given prn Lasix.  Over the next
72 hours, his sodium improved from 112-126.  The patient
denied feeling dyspneic or having other complaints such as
chest pain at home.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
The patient had a cough for approximately one week productive
of some clear sputum.  He denied any fevers, chills, or
sweats.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Type 2 diabetes.
2. Hypertension.
3. History of an enlarged prostate/prostate cancer, the
details of which the family was uncertain.
4. Lung nodule as noted on prior CT scan.
5. Hyponatremia as noted on prior admission.  The family
states that patient has had a low sodium for approximately
four years.
6. Coronary artery disease status post two-vessel coronary
artery bypass graft on [**2124-2-17**].
7. Prior cerebrovascular accident found incidentally on head
CT scan.
8. Echocardiogram report.  Pre-CABG was noted to have an
ejection fraction of 60-79% with 3-4+ MR.  Cardiac
catheterization pre-CABG by report:  Ejection fraction of
35%.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT TIME OF TRANSFER FROM THE INTENSIVE
CARE UNIT:
Vitals:  Temperature 99.5, pulse 72-83, blood pressure
109-132/44-50, respiratory rate 19-20, and pulse oximetry is
95-98% on 2 liters nasal cannula.  General appearance:  The
patient was awake, alert, jovial, and somewhat inappropriate
on his affect.  HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive
to light.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Sclerae were
anicteric.  Mucous membranes moist.  Cardiovascular:
Regular, rate, and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs.  Chest
is notable for healing sternotomy scars.  Lungs:  Scattered
wheezes bilaterally with decreased breath sounds at the bases
bilaterally.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with
active bowel sounds.  Extremities show no edema.  There is an
incision in the left groin secondary to prior intervention
with no obvious erythema or drainage.

LABORATORY STUDIES:
White blood count 8.2, hematocrit 27.5, platelets 598,000.
Sodium 126, potassium 4.9, chloride 97, glucose 79, magnesium
2.0, free calcium 1.11, cortisol 8.6.

Chest x-ray on [**2124-3-3**] showed an interval increase in the
patient's small right pleural effusion with adjacent
increased opacity in the posterior basilar segment of the
right lower lobe, question of atelectasis versus pneumonia.
There is also evidence of a small left pleural effusion.

From prior admission, chest CT scan on [**2124-2-16**] noted
bilateral small effusions with adjacent atelectasis, an
addition consolidation in the superior segment of the left
lower lobe, atelectasis, versus aspiration, versus pneumonia.
A 5 mm ill-defined density in the right upper lobe malignancy
versus scarring.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular.  The patient was status post recent
coronary artery bypass graft.  His scars showed good evidence
of healing.  He was maintained on his prior cardiac regimen
of aspirin, Lopressor.  In the setting of some mild
congestive heart failure, he was also started on an ACE
inhibitor.

For congestive heart failure, the patient was continued on
his standing dose of po Lasix and given daily prn Lasix
typically 20-40 mg IV q day to keep the patient approximately
500 cc negative/day.  Repeat chest x-ray after the patient
was transferred to the floor showed additional interval
increase in the patient's right sided pleural effusion which
was thought to be possibly associated with a right lower lobe
consolidation.  Given the patient's history of right upper
lobe nodule on CT scan however, possibility of a malignant
effusion was also considered possible.  Given the patient's
mild congestive heart failure, it was also felt that his
congestive heart failure was contributing to the effusion.
The patient was also continued on Plavix 75 mg po q day as
per CT Surgery recommendations during this hospitalization.

The patient was diuresed as noted above to keep him at least
500 to a liter negative each day.  The patient had no
complaints of chest pain and actually denied shortness of
breath throughout his hospitalization.  He was also followed
daily by the Cardiothoracic Surgery team and will be
following up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] in the clinic shortly after his
discharge.

2. Pulmonary.  As noted, the patient is noted to have an
interval increase in the size of a right sided pleural
effusion compared to last chest x-ray from prior admission
and even an additional interval increase during the first
several days of his hospitalization here.  It was thought to
be secondary to congestive heart failure versus pneumonia
versus possible malignant effusion.  The patient was
complaining of a dry cough.  Was noted to have a low grade
temperature early on his hospitalization and chest x-ray did
suggest the possible associated right lower lobe
consolidation.

On [**2124-3-7**] the patient underwent thoracentesis which drained
approximately 1 liter of serous fluid slightly turbid
appearing.  Fluid analysis was consistent with exudative
effusion.  There were 1+ polys, no organisms noted on the
Gram stain, and bacterial cultures were negative.  Fluid was
also sent for cytology, which was notable only for some
reactive mesothelial cells.  Given the exudative nature of
the fluid, this is still possible to be a malignant origin,
and will be monitored for reaccumulation as an outpatient.
The Pleural Service followed the patient as an inpatient and
will review the case.  Their feeling was that if the patient
had significant reaccumulation of fluid or became symptomatic
over the next several weeks, they would consider
reintervention such as pleuroscopy to look for evidence of
pleural malignant involvement and do biopsy if necessary.
The patient will be following with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1151**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2146**] in
Pulmonary as well.

For concern for pneumonia, the patient was treated with a
10-day course of Levaquin.  The combination of some mild
diuresis and the removal of the fluid and antibiotic coverage
