Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 949**]
Chief Complaint:
jaundice, BRBPR

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endoscopy x 2 with variceal banding


History of Present Illness:
35F with long history of etOH abuse (last drink 10 PTA), s/p
gastric bypass, 4 days BRBPR, and new jaundice. She also reports
abdominal bloating but denies pain, F/C/NS or melena prior to
admission. She intially presented to [**Hospital **] hospital where she
was found to have a HCT 21 and TBili 17. NG lavage was negative.
She recieved 2U pRBCs, 6U FFP, and levofloxacin for a preseumed
UTI. She was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
In the ED her VS were T99.0 P101 BP99/53 R18 95% on RA. She was
comfortable but jaundiced on exam with a distended, nontender
abdomen. Exam was notable for appreciable fluid in abdomen and
mild to moderate ascites by bedside US. Her intitial HCT here
was 23 so she received an additional 2U pRBCs. She was initially
admitted to the MICU for management of her acute alcoholic
hepatitis and presumed GIB.
.
In the MICU she started on IV PPI, octreotide, and ciprofloxacin
for UTI. She was seen by the hepatology team who did an EGD
which revealed 3 cords of grade I and 1 [**Last Name (un) 4782**] II varices and a
colonscopy which revealed melena and medium grade 2 external
hemorrhoids. An ECHO was performed for low voltage EKG and
peripheral edema to rule out pericardial effusion and dilated
cardiomyopathy, which was negative. A CT abdomen was performed
which showed an 18cm distended gall bladder for which surgery
was consulted.

DUPLEX DOP ABD/PEL LIMITED Study Date of [**2104-4-2**] 9:35 PM
FINDINGS: The liver is diffusely echogenic consistent with fatty
infiltration. While no focal hepatic lesion is identified,
evaluation is limited by difficult son[**Name (NI) 493**] penetration.
There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. While portal
venous flow is intermittently identified in the left portal and
extrahepatic main portal vein, reliable color flow is not
acheived in the intrahepatic or right portal venous system. The
common bile duct measures 5 mm. The gallbladder is significantly
distended with sludge, but there are no gallstones,
pericholecystic fluid or wall thickening, and the onographic
[**Doctor Last Name **] sign is negative. Small ascites is present. The spleen
appears normal though the pancreas is not well seen. There is no
right hydronephrosis. IMPRESSION: 1. Diffusely echogenic liver
may be consistent with fatty infiltration. However, other forms
of liver disease and more advanced liver disease (i.e.,
significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis) cannot be excluded. 2.
Reliable intra-hepatic portal venous color flow is difficult to
achieve and thrombosis cannot be completely excluded. CT is
recommended for further evaluation. 3. Distended gallbladder
with sludge, but no evidence for cholecystitis. 4. Small
ascites.
.
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2104-4-3**] 4:10 PM CT ABDOMEN:
Small effusions are associated with relaxation atelectasis.
There is no consolidation or nodule in the lung bases. Heart
size is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. Diffusely
enlarged fatty liver has patchy enhancement in all phases. The
SMV, splenic and portal veins are patent. There are gastric and
splenic varices. The celiac and superior mesenteric arteries are
patent. Replaced right hepatic artery arises from the SMA. The
pancreas and adrenals are unremarkable. The gallbladder is
markedly distended, measuring 18 (CC) x 6 (AP) x 7 (ML) cm. The
spleen remains mildly enlarged, measuring 12.7 cm. Post-gastric
bypass changes are noted. The imaged intra- abdominal loops of
large and small bowel are unremarkable without evidence of
pneumatosis, free air or obstruction. There is no mesenteric or
retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Moderate ascites tracks along
the paracolic gutters into the pelvis. Diffuse subcutaneous
stranding represents anasarca. Bone windows demonstrate no
evidence of lesion that is suspicious for metastasis or
infection.  IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of SMV, splenic or portal
thrombosis. 2. Diffuse anasarca and moderate ascites. 3.
Enlarged fatty liver with heterogeneous perfusion reflects
cirrhosis. 4. Markedly enlarged gallbladder without evidence of
gallstones or cholecystitis. 5. Moderate bilateral pleural
effusions. 6. Gastric and splenic varices.
.
MRCP (MR ABD W&W/OC) Study Date of [**2104-4-5**] 6:11 PM FINDINGS:
The gallbladder is significantly distended and there are some
folds seen within. There is small amount of sludge within the
gallbladder and the wall is not appreciably thickened. The
cystic duct does not appear dilated. The common bile duct is
normal in caliber without evidence of stones. There is no
intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. No pancreatic ductal
dilatation. The liver is enlarged measuring 26 cm in length. The
liver is significantly fatty showing signal dropout on the
out-of-phase images. There is a small amount of ascites. There
are also minimal bilateral pleural effusions and subcutaneous
edema and fluid is also seen in the left pararenal space. There
is atelectasis of the bilateral lung bases. Sutures are seen in
the stomach, probably
